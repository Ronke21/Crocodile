<text>The United States Coast Guard Auxiliary (USCGAUX, CGAux, or USCG Aux) is the uniformed, civilian volunteer component of the United States Coast Guard. Congress established the unit on 23 June 1939, as the United States Coast Guard Reserve. On February 19, 1941, the entity was renamed the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary. The Auxiliary&#x27;s purpose is to bolster all USCG undertakings both at sea and in the sky, with the exception of tasks necessitating &quot;direct&quot; law enforcement or military actions. As of 2022, the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary boasted around 21,000 members.

The Auxiliary collectively dedicates over 4.5 million service hours annually and has accomplished close to 500,000 missions in aid of the Coast Guard. Annually, members of the Auxiliary are instrumental in saving around 500 lives, aiding 15,000 mariners in distress, performing over 150,000 recreational vessel safety checks, and imparting boating safety knowledge to over half a million learners. Collectively, the Coast Guard Auxiliary&#x27;s efforts save taxpayers several hundred million dollars every year.

==History==

The advent of the single-operator motorboat, followed by the introduction of the outboard engine in the early 20th century, led to a surge in recreational boating on U.S. federal waters. By the time 1939 rolled around, over 300,000 personal watercraft were in use. In the preceding year, the Coast Guard had been alerted with 14,000 assistance requests and had addressed 8,600 situations where boaters were &quot;in peril.&quot;


===Prior to World War II===
The U.S. Congress enacted the Coast Guard Reserve Act in 1938, establishing a volunteer reserve unit for the United States Coast Guard. Their primary duties included promoting maritime safety, enhancing boating proficiency among Americans, assisting in legal awareness and adherence, and supporting the active-duty members of the Coast Guard. Boat owners were grouped into flotillas distributed across Coast Guard districts throughout the U.S. These flotillas undertook safety and security patrols and played a role in enforcing the Federal Boating and Espionage Acts of 1940. Commandant Russell Waesche and Commodore Malcolm Stuart Boylan are credited as the founders.

In 1941, just two years after its creation, Congress passed legislation to reorganize the Coast Guard Reserve. From that point onward, the Coast Guard would maintain two reserve entities. The original volunteer group was rebranded as the Coast Guard Auxiliary. Concurrently, a new Coast Guard Reserve was established, endowed with military and law enforcement duties.

===During World War II===
During World War II, the Coast Guard recognized a distinct class of reservist known as the &quot;Temporary Reservist.&quot; Many of these individuals came from the ranks of the Auxiliary. These Temporary Reservists were uniformed and armed but served without pay, akin to a home guard. Additionally, Coast Guard Headquarters set forth directives permitting certain Auxiliarists and their vessels to bear arms. In 1941 the Coast Guard, Coast Guard Reserve, and Coast Guard Auxiliary were transferred from the United States Treasury Department to the United States Department of the Navy and in 1942 the Coast Guard Auxiliary was authorized to wear military uniforms.

During World War II, Auxiliarists played a pivotal role in assisting the Coast Guard with the recruitment and training of active-duty members. In 1942, due to the escalating threat posed by German U-boats, the U.S. Navy sought the acquisition of &quot;as many civilian craft as feasible that were capable of undertaking voyages at sea under fair weather conditions for a duration of at least 48 hours.&quot; A significant portion of vessels, both owned and navigated by Auxiliarists and crewed by Coast Guard reservists, constituted the primary American coastal defense against submarines during the initial stages of World War II, forming what was known as the &quot;Corsair Fleet.&quot;

However, as newly built war vessels began assuming these roles, the Coast Guard phased out the use of these civilian crafts in anti-submarine warfare. Despite the fact that these 2,000 civilian vessels, equipped with deck-stowed depth charges, never succeeded in sinking a submarine, they did manage to rescue several hundred survivors from torpedo-stricken merchant ships. From 1942 onward and for the remainder of the war, both Auxiliarists and Coast Guard reservists were integral to local Port Security Forces, ensuring the protection of the maritime shipping sector.

===Post World War II activities===
In 1950, Bert Pouncey was elected as the National Commodore, leading to the establishment of the National Board for the Coast Guard Auxiliary. By 1955, Auxiliarists began to engage in initiatives aimed at supporting the recruitment of prospective candidates for the United States Coast Guard Academy.

The North American Boating Campaign was originally known as &quot;Safe Boating Week,&quot; observed by the Coast Guard Auxiliary as a courtesy examination weekend in Amesbury, Massachusetts in June 1952. This tradition continued until 1957 when an official National Safe Boating Week observation took place sponsored by the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary in various parts of the country. As a result, the U.S. Coast Guard prepared a Resolution, and on 4 June 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed PL 85-445, to establish National Safe Boating Week as the first week starting on the first Sunday in June.

In the early part of 1973, due to budgetary constraints, seven Coast Guard stations on the Great Lakes were shut down. Responding to the appeals of the impacted communities, Congress mandated the reopening of these stations, placing them under the operation of the Auxiliary. Local division captains stepped up to manage these stations, ensuring that Auxiliary vessels were constantly on standby to aid vessels in distress. Subsequently, the Auxiliary assumed control of an additional seven stations located on the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers.

In 1976, the Coast Guard initiated a comprehensive assessment of the Auxiliary through a private research entity, the University Sciences Forum of Washington. After conducting interviews with pivotal figures from both the Coast Guard and the Auxiliary and scrutinizing questionnaires completed by approximately two thousand Auxiliarists, the researchers deduced that the Auxiliary was thriving. Their conclusion was succinct: &quot;In summary,&quot; they stated, &quot;we view the Auxiliary as the most cost-effective asset readily accessible to the COGARD. Its performance is exemplary, and its members stand out as some of the most dedicated and professional volunteers in the country.&quot;

===Enhanced role for the auxiliarist===
In 1996, a legislative act by Congress broadened the Auxiliary&#x27;s scope, permitting its members to aid in any mission sanctioned by the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard. However, present policies prohibit Auxiliary members from holding deputized law enforcement powers or participating in military combat tasks. By 2004, the Coast Guard Auxiliary consisted of 35,000 members, together contributing a total of 2 million hours of service each year.

===Under the Department of Homeland Security===
In 2003 the Coast Guard, Coast Guard Reserve and Coast Guard Auxiliary were realigned to be under the United States Department of Homeland Security. As of 2004, the Coast Guard Auxiliary had 35,000 members who collectively provided 2 million man hours of service annually.

On 19 June 2009, the Commandant of the Coast Guard awarded the Coast Guard Unit Commendation to Auxiliary members for &quot;performance ... nothing short of stellar&quot; from the period of 24 June 1999, to 23 June 2009. On the 75th anniversary of the USCG Auxiliary, 23 June 2014, the Commandant awarded another Coast Guard Unit Commendation ribbon to all Auxiliarists.

On 24 June 2014, the Commandant of the Coast Guard ADML Paul F. Zukunft awarded the Coast Guard Unit Commendation to the Coast Guard Auxiliary for &quot;exceptionally meritorious service from June 24, 2009 to June 23, 2014, while providing unprecedented levels of dedicated public service and operational support to the U. S. Coast Guard&#x27;s missions&quot;.

On 16 May 2019, the Commandant of the Coast Guard ADMLKarl Schultz awarded a third Coast Guard Unit Commendation for &quot;exceptionally meritorious service from June 24, 2014 to June 23, 2019 while providing extraordinary levels of public service and support to the United States Coast Guard&quot;.

On 25 May 2024, the Commandant of the Coast Guard ADML Lisa Fagan awarded the Coast Guard Unit Commendation to Coast Guard Auxiliary for &quot;exceptionally meritorious service from June 24, 2019, to June 23, 2024, while providing extraordinary levels of public service and support to the United States Coast Guard&quot;.

==Awards and decorations==

==Programs and missions==

The Auxiliary primarily acts as a force enhancer for the Coast Guard. Auxiliarists are dedicated to fostering safety, security, and aid for the citizens of the United States, whether it&#x27;s in harbors, seaports, along the coasts, on the country&#x27;s canals, rivers, or even in the skies. The task of promoting and enhancing recreational boater safety has been fully entrusted to the Auxiliary by the USCG. Furthermore, the Auxiliary actively aids both active-duty members and reservists in executing a range of missions, including search and rescue, marine safety, management of waterways, environmental preservation, and various duties related to homeland security.

===Missions===

===Recreational Boating Safety===

The Auxiliary&#x27;s most prominent role is promoting recreational boating safety (&quot;RBS&quot; in Auxiliary parlance). The Auxiliary has several distinct programs that support this mission, most visibly:
* Providing free Vessel Safety Checks (formerly &quot;Courtesy Marine Examinations&quot;) to recreational boaters;
* Delivering a Public Education (or &quot;PE&quot;) program, which consists of a range of courses on boating-related topics such as seamanship, knots, laws and regulations related to boating, weather, and navigation; and
* Acting as a liaison to local businesses/organizations (such as marinas, boating clubs, civic clubs, etc.) through RBS Partnership Program Visitors (formerly &quot;Marine Dealer Visitors).

===Surface and Air Operations===

The Coast Guard Auxiliary participates in both surface and aerial activities, termed &quot;AUXAIR,&quot; to bolster the Coast Guard&#x27;s efforts in areas like search &amp; rescue, marine safety/security, environmental protection/response, and to some degree, tasks related to law enforcement and national defense. Auxiliarists who possess boats and aircraft have the option to provide them for Coast Guard use, designating them as Auxiliary &quot;facilities.&quot; Auxiliarists qualified as boat crewmen, coxswains, pilots, air crew, and air observers can take part in these activities. Beyond their primary roles, Auxiliary aircraft can also serve as official modes of transportation for active-duty members when commercial travel options are either impractical or not suitable.

===Auxiliary University Programs===

The Auxiliary University Programs (AUP) is a Coast Guard Auxiliary-managed initiative established in 2007. Presently, AUP comprises almost 200 members distributed across 11 units, representing over 30 academic institutions throughout the United States. AUP, or Auxiliary University Programs, is designed to groom undergraduate and graduate students for prospective roles in public service, both within the Coast Guard Auxiliary and beyond. Drawing inspiration from ROTC (Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps) programs, AUP offers students insights into Coast Guard career paths without mandating a service obligation. Broadly, the program imparts knowledge on seamanship and leadership while promoting the ethos of public service. AUP has a positive track record of getting a large number of its graduates into Coast Guard Officer Candidate School and also offers an Internship Program.

===Augmentation===

In addition to employing vessels and aircraft owned and operated by Auxiliarists, the Coast Guard leverages individual Auxiliarists to directly support active-duty operations. It&#x27;s common to find Auxiliarists taking on a variety of roles such as manning radio stations, aiding in boat upkeep, handling administrative tasks, cooking, acting as morale officers, and fulfilling other supportive roles at various Coast Guard units, especially at small boat stations. On rarer occasions, Auxiliarists might be stationed aboard cutters, serving as cooks, interpreters for foreign languages, or other similar auxiliary capacities. The Auxiliary also trains and provides members on an as-needed basis in areas such as emergency management. 

The Coast Guard, equipped with only a singular regular military band and color guard, occasionally calls upon Auxiliarists to step into these roles for significant occasions like ship christenings and change-of-command ceremonies. Moreover, the United States Coast Guard Pipe Band comprises members from both the Coast Guard Reserve and the Coast Guard Auxiliary.

Auxiliarists with expertise in health care, legal assistance, financial counseling, or clergy roles can leverage their professional qualifications and experience to support active duty/reserve Coast Guard personnel and their families, whether on a continuous or as-needed basis. For instance, health care professional Auxiliarists might offer their services at Public Health Service clinics catering to the Coast Guard community. Likewise, Auxiliarists with legal expertise often assist Coast Guard members in navigating insurance claims, addressing landlord-tenant disagreements, and managing other civil issues.

Auxiliarists are sometimes also dispatched to support the missions/activities of other federal, state, and local agencies, and civic organizations such as the Civil Air Patrol. For example, Auxiliarists have voluntarily deployed in support of disaster relief operations (notably Hurricane Katrina) and to provide support to Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the U.S.-Mexico border.

==Organization==

The organizational structure of the Coast Guard places the Coast Guard Auxiliary within the Office of Auxiliary and Boating Safety (CG-BSX), specifically in the Auxiliary Division (CG-BSX-1). This is nested under the purview of the office of the Deputy Commandant for Operations (CG-DCO) at Coast Guard Headquarters. Further down the chain, CG-DCO supervises the Assistant Commandant for Marine Safety, Security, and Stewardship (CG-5). CG-5 then oversees the Director of Prevention Policy (CG-54), who subsequently supervises CG-542.

The Coast Guard Auxiliary boasts units spread across all 50 U.S. states, as well as in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and Guam. Functioning under the direct jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security through the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, the Auxiliary&#x27;s internal operational structure is delineated into four primary organizational tiers: Flotilla, Division, District, and National.
* Flotillas: A Flotilla stands as the foundational unit of the Auxiliary. A flotilla is ideally composed of a minimum of 10 members, but many flotillas can boast memberships exceeding 100 individuals. The bulk of the Auxiliary&#x27;s routine operations are executed at the flotilla level. Every member enters the Auxiliary through a flotilla and directs their annual membership fees to this foundational unit. Typically, flotillas convene on a monthly schedule, and they often welcome both visitors and those interested in joining.
* Divisions: At least four (4) flotillas form a Division, which provides leadership, direction, and staff assistance to the flotillas so that their programs can run effectively.
* Districts/Regions: There are several divisions in a District. The District provides leadership and staff assistance to the Divisions. Each Auxiliary District is supervised by a Director of the Auxiliary who is an Active Duty Coast Guard officer usually holding the rank of Commander. Auxiliary Districts generally coincide with Coast Guard Districts.
* Areas: Three Deputy National Commodores are responsible for three geographic areas: Atlantic East, Atlantic West, and Pacific Area, respectively.
* National: The Auxiliary&#x27;s governance structure is overseen by national officers who, in collaboration with the Commandant, manage its administration and overarching policy determinations. Central to this architecture is the National Executive Committee (NEXCOM). This includes the Chief Director of Auxiliary (CHDIRAUX) — an active-duty officer, the National Commodore (NACO), the Immediate Past National Commodore (IPNACO), the Vice National Commodore (VNACO), and four Deputy National Commodores (DNACOs). These figures are part of the broader National Staff Operating Committee (OPCOM). OPCOM, in its entirety, consists of twenty-nine members: the eight members from NEXCOM as outlined, an additional eight from the National Executive Staff which includes Assistant National Commodores (ANACO), and a set of fourteen Directorate Directors (DIR). This cohesive structure ensures the effective operation and leadership of the Auxiliary at the national scale. The aforementioned individuals, combined with their specific teams in the different national directorates, constitute the Auxiliary Headquarters organization. The Chief Director, a senior officer within the Coast Guard, oversees the administration of the Auxiliary, basing decisions on policies set by the Commandant. The overarching management of the Auxiliary falls to the Deputy Commandant for Operations (CG-DCO), who directly reports to the Commandant (CCG).

==Leadership and staffing==
District Commodores and District Chiefs of Staff are elected to a two-year term. Division Commanders, Division Vice Commanders, Flotilla Commanders, and Flotilla Vice Commanders are elected annually to provide overall organizational leadership. Staff officers are appointed by these elected officers to oversee various program areas.

The Coast Guard Auxiliary does not have a military chain of command; it does, however, have a similar concept called the &quot;Chain of Leadership and Management&quot; (or &quot;COLM&quot;). Auxiliarists are expected to adhere to the COLM when issuing instructions and seeking direction/guidance on policy matters. There are actually two COLMs. Staff officers at each level report to both their own elected unit leader and to the staff officer in the equivalent position at the next highest level of the organization (this is known as &quot;parallel staffing&quot;). For example, a Flotilla Staff Officer (FSO) overseeing the flotilla&#x27;s public education program (the &quot;FSO-PE&quot;) reports to both his/her own Flotilla Commander (through the Flotilla Vice Commander) and the division Staff Officer for public education (the &quot;SO-PE&quot;).

===National officers===
The national leadership is elected once every two years. National officer positions include the following:

* The National Commodore (NACO) of the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary is the most senior and principal officer of the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary. The NACO represents the Auxiliary and reports to the Commandant of the Coast Guard through the Vice Commandant of the Coast Guard. Additionally, the NACO represents the Auxiliary with all Coast Guard flag officers and flag officer equivalent civilians at Coast Guard headquarters on Auxiliary matters. The NACO functions to support the Commandant&#x27;s strategic goals and objectives and serve auxiliarists.
* Vice National Commodore (VNACO) – The VNACO is the chief operating officer of the Coast Guard Auxiliary and reports to the National Commodore (NACO). Additionally, the VNACO represents the Auxiliary at the direction of the NACO with all Coast Guard Flag officers and Flag officer equivalent civilians at Coast Guard Headquarters on Auxiliary matters.
* Deputy National Commodore (DNACO) – The Auxiliary has four Deputy National Commodores (DNACO) who report to the Vice National Commodore. Three are elected (Mission Support, Operations, and Recreational Boating Safety), and one is appointed (Information Technology and Planning). Each DNACO has a specific set of operational areas of responsibility to include one or more of the appointed Assistant National Commodores (staff officers). Additionally, each of the three elected DNACOs are the reporting point for approximately one third of the 16 District Commodores, grouped by geographical area, who are elected every two years to lead their local membership.
* Assistant National Commodore (ANACO) – Eight Assistant National Commodores form the National Executive Staff and are appointed to either lead multiple national directorates or perform specialized roles (such as Chief Counsel or Diversity). They are expected to consult and coordinate with appropriate Coast Guard Flag officers and program managers in coordination with the Chief Director to determine requirements for Auxiliary resources used within their areas of responsibilities and develop and manage Auxiliary programs consistent with Coast Guard needs and objectives.
* Immediate Past National Commodore (NIPCO) – The NIPCO is the most recent predecessor of the National Commodore office and serves on the National Executive Committee.
* Director (DIR) – Appointed top officers of the Auxiliary&#x27;s various National Directorates: Government &amp; Public Affairs (A); RBS Outreach (B); Computer Software &amp; Systems (C); Public Education (E); Human Resources (H); International Affairs (I); Performance Management (M); Prevention (P); Emergency Management &amp; Disaster Response (Q); Response (R); Strategic Planning (S); Training (T); IT User Support &amp; Services (U); Vessel Examination &amp; RBS Visitation (V), and Cybersecurity (Y). 
* Deputy Director (DIRd) – Appointed aide officers of the Auxiliary&#x27;s various National Directorate Directors. They are the second-highest appointed officers within a Directorate and lead alongside the Directors.
* Division Chief (DVC) – The DVCs manage a broad program sector within each directorate under the director and deputy director.
* Branch Chief (BC) – The BCs oversee specialized functions and programs on the National Staff, and are directly responsible for carrying out many of the National Staff functions within their Directorate. They work under the direction of the Division Chief.
* Branch Assistant (BA) – The BAs serve as support staff under a Branch Chief, carrying out national-level tasks and duties provided by their respective BC.

===District officers===
* District Director of the Auxiliary (DIRAUX) – An active duty Coast Guard officer, usually a commander, who is dedicated full-time to Auxiliary functions in his or her district. The DIRAUX has sole responsibility for enrolling a new member or for disenrolling an existing member. The DIRAUX is also the final authority in all matters related to his or her Auxiliary district. Each DIRAUX has small staff of active duty members, Auxiliarists, and civilian employees to assist with these functions.
* District Commodore (DCO) – The highest elected officer within the district, elected by the Division Commanders, the District Commodore supervises all Auxiliary activities within his or her district.
* District Chief of Staff (DCOS) (formerly District Vice Commodore [VCO]) – The district&#x27;s Chief of Staff and Assistant to the District Commodore. Elected by the Division Commanders in the district.
* District Captains (DCAPT) (formerly District Rear Commodore [RCO]) (two or more per district) – Elected by all Division Commanders and usually supervise a group of divisions in a district. They may also have programmatic responsibilities.
* District Directorate Chiefs (DDC) – Some districts appoint DDCs based on the three major areas of Auxiliary activity (i.e., Prevention, Response, and Logistics). They are appointed by the DCO and approved by DIRAUX.
* District Staff Officers (DSO) – Manage the district&#x27;s departments and programs; appointed by the DCO and approved by DIRAUX.
* Assistant District Staff Officers (ADSO) – Assist with the management of district departments under the direction and guidance of the DSO; appointed by the DCO with concurrence of DCOS. DSO&#x27;s report to the DCOS (through a DDC, where applicable).

===Division officers===
* Division Commander (DCDR) (formerly Division Captain) – The highest elected Auxiliary leader within a division. Elected by the Flotilla Commanders in a Division.
* Division Vice Commander (VCDR) (formerly Division Vice Captain) – Division Chief of Staff and assistant to the Division Commander. Elected by the Flotilla Commanders in a division.
* Division Staff Officers (SO) – Manage the division&#x27;s departments and programs; appointed by the DCDR.

===Flotilla officers===
Titles and duties of flotilla officers are dictated by the Auxiliary Manual.
* Flotilla Commander (FC) – The highest elected Auxiliary leader within a flotilla. He/she is elected by the members of a flotilla. Recommends new members for enrollment to the DIRAUX.
* Flotilla Vice Commander (VFC) – The flotilla&#x27;s Chief of Staff and assistant to the Flotilla Commander. Elected by the members of a Flotilla.
* Flotilla Staff Officers (FSO) – Responsible for managing the flotilla&#x27;s departments and programs; appointed by the FC.
* Detachment Leader (DL) – Serves as the leader for a DIRAUX approved flotilla detachment. This officer is appointed by the FC and wears the insignia of an FSO.

===Staff officers===
To effectively execute the Auxiliary program, Division Commanders (DCDRs) and Flotilla Commanders (FCs) have the authority to appoint staff officers at the flotilla and division levels. At the district level, the District Commodore (DCO) is responsible for appointing district staff officers. The designations for these roles vary based on their level within the organization: at the flotilla level, the abbreviation is FSO; for the division level, it&#x27;s SO; and at the district level, DSO is used. For instance, the term SO-CS denotes the Division Communications Services officer.

The list of staff officers, with their official abbreviations, is:
* Aviation (AV) &quot;(district level only)&quot;
* Culinary Assistance (CA)
* Communications (CM)
* Communication Services (CS)
* Diversity (DV)
* Finance (FN)
* Flight Safety Officer (DFSO) &quot;(district level only)&quot;
* Food Service (FS) &quot;(division level and above)&quot;
* Human Resources (HR)
* Information Services (IS)
* Legal/Parliamentarian (LP) &quot;(district level only)&quot;
* Marine Safety and Environmental Protection (MS)
* Materials (MA)
* Member Training (MT)
* Navigation Systems (NS)
* Operations (OP)
* Public Affairs (PA)
* Publications (PB)
* Public Education (PE)
* Recreational Boating Safety Visitation Program (PV)
* Sea Scouts (&quot;AUXSCOUT&quot; program) (AS)
* Secretary/Records (SR)
* Vessel Examination (VE)

==Uniforms and insignia==

===Uniforms===
While joining the Auxiliary doesn&#x27;t mandate Auxiliarists to acquire uniforms, specific activities and missions do necessitate wearing them. Each auxiliary uniform is identical to a Coast Guard officer&#x27;s uniform, with the exception that the buttons and stripes on dress jackets and shoulder boards are silver in color, rather than gold. On dress uniforms, appointed staff officers wear insignia with a red &quot;A&quot; and elected officers wear insignia with either a silver or a blue &quot;A&quot;, while black &quot;A&quot;s are worn on insignia by both elected and appointed officers on the ODU uniform. Auxiliarists are typically held to similar uniform standards as regular and reserve Coast Guard officers. However, there are certain leniencies in the guidelines. For instance, unlike their regular and reserve counterparts, Auxiliarists are permitted to sport beards.

In scenarios where Auxiliarists are supplementing Coast Guard personnel in an operational setting, such as acting as an interpreter on a cutter at sea, the military-style officer insignia representing an Auxiliary position is typically removed. Instead, the generic &quot;member&quot; insignia is adorned. This adjustment ensures that there&#x27;s no misconception, especially when interacting with foreign military entities or potential adversaries, that the Auxiliarist holds any command power over the vessel.

===Auxiliary insignia, titles, and military etiquette===

Auxiliarists wear military rank-style insignia that signify their leadership position (e.g., a Flotilla Commander wears insignia similar to a USCG lieutenant) but do not hold substantive military ranks and are not typically addressed by their position title. Members of the Coast Guard Auxiliary are typically referred to as &quot;Auxiliarist&quot; (with the abbreviation &quot;AUX&quot;), with the exception of those who occupy or have occupied senior leadership roles equivalent to flag officers (Admirals). These members are addressed as &quot;Commodore&quot; (shortened to &quot;COMO&quot;). Notably, the title associated with the office, such as &quot;Commodore,&quot; is placed before the name only for those who are or were Commodores. For instance, &quot;Commodore Lucy Jones&quot; would be the appropriate address for someone who currently holds or once held a position like National Commodore, Deputy National Commodore, Assistant National Commodore, or District Commodore.

For other elected or appointed roles, such as District Chief of Staff, District Captain, and leaders at the division or flotilla levels, the title follows the name. Examples include &quot;Mr. Sam Rosenberg, District Captain,&quot; &quot;Ms. Marion Lewis, Division Staff Officer,&quot; or &quot;Mr. James Chun, Flotilla Commander.&quot;

Auxiliarists typically don&#x27;t engage in military customs like saluting when interacting with each other, though there&#x27;s no rule against it. However, they are expected to begin salutes and demonstrate other suitable courtesies to military officers who rank higher than the equivalent office insignia that the Auxiliarist wears. Additionally, they are anticipated to uphold correct flag etiquette and similar protocols. While enlisted personnel, Warrant Officers, and Commissioned Officers of the Coast Guard aren&#x27;t obligated to salute Auxiliarists, they might occasionally do so. In such instances, Auxiliarists should reciprocate by returning the salute.

The rank-style insignia sported by Auxiliarists doesn&#x27;t denote authority in a military sense but rather identifies an individual&#x27;s position within the Auxiliary. It&#x27;s also a means of acknowledging the duties associated with elected and appointed leadership positions as well as those of staff officers. If these leaders have served at least half of the term of their designated role, they are allowed to continuously wear the insignia corresponding to the highest office they&#x27;ve held. However, once an Auxiliarist is no longer in the role represented by their insignia, they must adorn a &quot;Past Officer Device&quot; on the right pocket flap of their uniform shirt or service dress jacket to signify their past position.

==== Office title and insignia ====
====Pledge====
Auxiliarists ascribe to the following pledge during induction:

:&quot;I, (your name), solemnly and sincerely pledge myself, to support the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary, and its purposes, to faithfully execute my duties, and to abide by the governing policies, established by the Commandant, of the United States Coast Guard.&quot;

===Medals, awards, and citations===

====Qualification badges====
Qualification Badges of the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary are sanctioned and distributed by the United States Coast Guard&#x27;s DIRAUX. These badges are awarded to auxiliarists who attain specific qualifications during their tenure in the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary. While Auxiliarists have the permission to display qualification badges or insignia obtained from their previous military service, they must adhere to the uniform standards set by the Coast Guard. Specifically, only two such badges are permitted on service uniforms, and just one on Operational Dress Uniforms (ODU&#x27;s). The following are the qualification badges that the Coast Guard bestows upon Auxiliarists:

=====Qualification insignia=====

====Service identification badges====
All auxiliarists currently on the National Staff may wear the National Staff Badge. Auxiliarists who volunteer in recruiting offices and satisfy certain requirements may be authorized to wear the Coast Guard Recruiting Badge. Auxiliarists who meet the requirements of the Academy Admissions Partner Program and are approved by the Superintendent of the United States Coast Guard Academy may also be entitled to wear the Coast Guard Academy Admissions Recruiting Badge.

==Benefits==

The United States Coast Guard Auxiliary offers a number of benefits and fellowship opportunities. Auxiliarists are allowed access to the Coast Guard Exchange and have opportunities for training, awards, and uniforms. Some expenses incurred by the auxiliarist may be tax deductible. Auxiliarists are allowed access to the Coast Guard Mutual Assistance Program. Auxiliary Flotillas are also supported by the Coast Guard Foundation.

If an Auxiliarist is injured or killed in the line of duty while executing official orders, they might be eligible for compensation at a monthly pay rate commensurate with that of a GS-9 on the General Schedule Pay scale.

===Identification Card===
Auxiliarists are issued an official identification card from the U.S. Coast Guard by their local Director of Auxiliary (DIRAUX) only after the USCG Security Center completes a Personnel Security Investigation and issues a favorable suitability-for-service determination. The card also serves as an identification that the Auxiliarist falls under the protocols of the Geneva Conventions (specifically the Fourth Geneva Convention).

===Coast Guard Auxiliary Association===

Based in St. Louis, Missouri, the Coast Guard Auxiliary Association (CGAuxA) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Established in 1957, as per its website, the association fundraises and contributes financially to bolster the auxiliary&#x27;s outreach efforts. It aids the Auxiliary in promoting Recreational Boater Safety, organizing fundraising events, and supplying necessary resources. Additionally, members of the Auxiliary Association can access the services of the Pentagon Federal Credit Union and the Navy Federal Credit Union. The Coast Guard Auxiliary has also established a number of national partnerships for discounts on office supplies, hotels, rental cars, prescriptions, and insurance. The Auxiliary Association is led by a ten-member Board of Directors that receives no compensation. Auxiliarists are automatically extended a free membership to the Auxiliary Association.

==Eligibility for Membership==
Applicants should be a U.S. citizen, be at least 17 years old, and if they have previously served in the U.S. Armed Forces, they must demonstrate they were discharged under honorable conditions at the very least. Furthermore, they should not have a felony on their record and must possess a valid social security number. Sea Scouts may be eligible to join at age 14, under an exception granted by agreement between both organizations. Although many believe the auxiliary primarily appeals to boat owners and veterans of the armed forces, neither is a prerequisite for joining, and such notions are widespread misconceptions.

==Status level qualifications==
To be eligible for membership, an individual must submit an application and undergo fingerprinting. As a first step, the prospective member has to complete the new member course and clear the new member examination. Once they pass, they will receive a new member ID number. However, they will be designated as &quot;approval pending&quot; (AP) until their Personnel Security Investigation (PSI) is finalized. As of 1 February 2018, new auxiliarists in AP status are required to clear the Basic Qualification Course II, encompassing seven test modules derived from the Auxiliary Manual, before they can advance to a higher status.

If the PSI yields a positive outcome, the auxiliarist might qualify for the &quot;initially qualified&quot; (IQ) status. However, an unfavorable PSI result will lead to their disenrollment from the Auxiliary. Members holding IQ status cannot attain &quot;basically qualified&quot; (BQ) status until they complete all mandatory training. Once they fulfill these training requirements, they transition to BQ status. Being in BQ status, often seen as &quot;full membership,&quot; is typically a prerequisite for holding elected or appointed positions and for seeking qualifications in most fields. From there, the auxiliarist can aim for the &quot;operational auxiliarist&quot; (AX) qualification, which includes coursework in areas like seamanship, meteorology, radio communications, leadership, and so on.
==Training==

Those Auxiliarists with prior military service typically find a seamless integration into their flotilla, quickly aligning with the current responsibilities and military traditions of the Coast Guard Auxiliary. Any insignia, badges, ribbons, and devices earned during their tenure in the United States Armed Forces can potentially be adorned on the Auxiliary uniform, contingent upon the stipulations laid out in the Auxiliary Manual.

===Operational Auxiliarist===

The &quot;Operational Auxiliarist&quot; (often termed &quot;AUXOP&quot;) represents the pinnacle of Auxiliary membership statuses. Achieving this requires members to undergo advanced training in specialized areas that enhance operational proficiency. This program has been in existence since 1952 and was established under leadership of National Commodore Bert Pouncey. The AUXOP designation was established to help the Coast Guard address specific skill gaps and support its operational missions more effectively. To earn the Operational Auxiliarist title, one must accumulate seven credits from a trio of course categories: Core, Leadership, and Electives. Specialty courses in weather, seamanship, and communications are required in the core curriculum that are all good for a credit each. An additional four credits are required under the leadership and elective course types. Once the training program is successfully finished, the Auxiliarist earns the privilege to don the AUXOP Device. Moreover, this advanced AUXOP training enhances the Auxiliarist&#x27;s capacity and capability to provide more substantial support during the Coast Guard&#x27;s operational missions.

===Core training===
Within their inaugural year of joining the organization, Auxiliarists must undergo six essential training courses. Subsequently, they need to retake these courses every half-decade. These courses encompass topics like Security Fundamentals, Suicide Prevention, Privacy, Prevention of Sexual Harassment &amp; Assault, and Civil Rights Awareness. Furthermore, Auxiliarists are obligated to complete training in influenza and ethics awareness at least once during their tenure, utilizing the Coast Guard Auxiliary Learning Management System.

Failure to complete the mandatory training may make the auxiliarist ineligible to participate in Coast Guard Auxiliary exercises, drills, or response events.

==== Incident Command System training recognized by the Coast Guard Auxiliary ====
The Coast Guard Auxiliary requires auxiliarists to take mandatory Incident Command System (ICS) courses. Four of the Incident Command System (ICS) courses are offered through FEMA&#x27;s Emergency Management Institute (EMI) and another course if offered through the Auxiliary Learning Management System. Auxiliarists are expected to take courses that will help them to understand the Incident Command System&#x27;s organization, basic terminology and common responsibilities. Auxiliarists are required to acquire the skills necessary to perform in an ICS support role. Officers, certified coxswains, pilots, or those in a leadership role may need to take additional EMI courses pertaining to the National Incident Management System and/or the National Response Framework. As part of ICS Training, all auxiliarists must respond immediately to emergency response alerts and participation in mandatory.

===== FEMA courses =====
*IS-100: Introduction to the Incident Command System
*IS-200: Basic ICS for Single Resources and Initial Response
*IS-700: An Introduction to the National Incident Management System
*IS-800: National Response Framework, an Introduction

Note: IS-100 and IS-700 are part of the Mandatory Training requirement.

===C-School Training===
The Coast Guard offers over 15 specialized advanced training courses for auxiliarists through C-Schools. Given the limited slots, gaining a spot in a C-School is a competitive process, targeting those auxiliarists aiming for higher roles of responsibility. To participate in a C-School course, an auxiliarist needs endorsement from their DIRAUX, who will subsequently provide the official orders. While attending a C-School, the Coast Guard typically covers the auxiliarist&#x27;s lodging and daily expenses. Among the C-School training opportunities are three-tiered leadership programs: AUXLAMS (Leadership and Management), AMLOC (Mid-Level Officer course), and AULOC (Upper-Level Officer course).

===Center for Homeland Defense and Security Courses===
Auxiliarists have the opportunity to enroll in self-study courses provided by the Naval Postgraduate School&#x27;s Center for Homeland Defense and Security. As of 2023, there are over 30 online courses on offer.

==Legal protection==
When on federal duty, auxiliarists are deemed federal employees in the context of civil liability. This designation shields individual auxiliarists from direct lawsuits in numerous cases related to torts, property, and injuries that stem from their official responsibilities. Furthermore, during wartime, Coast Guard auxiliarists fall under the protocols of the Geneva Conventions (specifically the Fourth Geneva Convention).

===Employment protection===
Several states provide limited job protection for auxiliary members who assist in emergency response after a disaster or attend to auxiliary-related duties.

* For instance, in Missouri, auxiliarists employed by the state are granted up to fifteen days of leave annually, with the cap being lifted if they&#x27;re responding to a state or nationally declared disaster or emergency. Not only are they safeguarded against job termination due to their absence, but they&#x27;re also ensured against any deduction in pay, loss of regular leave, diminished efficiency ratings, or any other potential disadvantages related to their rights or benefits.
* In Arkansas, auxiliarists working for the state, city, or county governments are granted up to fifteen days of leave each year to respond to emergencies. During this period, they&#x27;re shielded from any reductions in seniority rights, performance ratings, promotional status, retirement benefits, and life and disability insurance benefits, along with any other employment-related perks. Moreover, these public employees aren&#x27;t compelled to use their vacation days to account for this absence.
* In New Jersey, auxiliarists employed by the state, city, or county have the right to a leave of absence to attend state or national conventions organized by the Coast Guard Auxiliary. The first five days of this leave are paid. Additionally, their position is assured upon their return.

<doc id="765705" wikidata="Q1627876" url="?curid=765705" title="Horace Henderson">
<text>Horace W. Henderson (November 22, 1904 – August 29, 1988), the younger brother of Fletcher Henderson, was an American jazz pianist, organist, arranger, and bandleader.

Henderson was born in Cuthbert, Georgia, United States. While later attending Wilberforce University he formed a band called the Collegians, which included Benny Carter and Rex Stewart. This band was later known as the Horace Henderson Orchestra and then as the Dixie Stompers. Henderson left it to work with Sammy Stewart, then in 1928 organized a new band called the Collegians. Don Redman took over this band in 1931; Henderson continued to work as the band&#x27;s pianist and arranger before leaving to work for his brother.

Fletcher Henderson&#x27;s book contained about as many of Horace&#x27;s arrangements as of Fletcher&#x27;s. Although Horace worked continually, led bands, arranged, recorded, and composed into the 1980s, and although he is considered by many the more talented and skillful of the Henderson brothers, Fletcher remained more popular and accomplished more in the field.

Horace Henderson arranged for many other jazz musicians of the era. Among his other clients for arrangements were Charlie Barnet, the Casa Loma Orchestra, Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Earl Hines, and Jimmie Lunceford. His best-known arrangements were of his own &quot;Hot and Anxious&quot; (part of which became the main theme of &quot;In The Mood&quot;) and &quot;Christopher Columbus&quot;, of which he was one of the writers (but never received credit). He also wrote another popular instrumental of the big band era titled &quot;Big John&#x27;s Special&quot;. These were three important compositions of the period.

At different times in his career, Horace was pianist and musical director for both Lena Horne and Billie Holiday.

<text>Dominic Salvatore &quot;Don&quot; Gentile (December 6, 1920 – January 28, 1951), was a World War II RAF and USAAF pilot who achieved fame as he came close to surpassing Eddie Rickenbacker&#x27;s World War I record of 26 downed aircraft. He later served in the post-war U.S. Air Force.
==Early life==
Gentile was born in Piqua, Ohio, the son of Italian immigrants Patsy and Josephina Gentile, who immigrated in 1907. After a fascination with flying as a child, his father provided him with his own plane, an Aerosport Biplane. He managed to log over 300 hours flying time by July 1941, when he attempted to join the US Army Air Corp.

==Royal Canadian Air Force==
The U.S. military required two years of college for its pilots, which Gentile did not have, so he enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force and was posted to the UK in Dec 1941 as a Pilot Officer. Gentile flew the Supermarine Spitfire Mk V with No. 133 Squadron, one of the three famed RAF &quot;Eagle Squadron&quot;s beginning in June, 1942. His first kills (a Ju 88 and Fw 190) were on August 19, 1942, at Dieppe during Operation Jubilee.

==4th Fighter Group==
In September 1942, the Eagle squadron pilots transferred to the USAAF, becoming the nucleus of the 4th Fighter Group. Gentile became a flight leader in September 1943, now flying the P-47 Thunderbolt. Having flown Spitfires, Gentile and some of the other pilots of the 4th were displeased when they transitioned to the heavy P-47C in April 1943. On 16 December 1943, Gentile claimed one third-share of a destroyed Ju 88. On 5 January 1944, he claimed a Fw 190 west of Tours. Two Fw 190s were claimed on 14 January and a single 190 on 25 February.

By late 1943, future Group Commander Col. Don Blakeslee pushed for re-equipment with the lighter, more maneuverable P-51 Mustang. After conversion to the P-51B at the end of February 1944, Gentile built a tally of 15.5 additional aircraft destroyed between March 3 and April 8, 1944.

His first victory flying the P-51 was on 3 March, when he claimed a Do 217 in the Wittenberg area.

Together with his occasional wingman John T. Godfrey, they were known as &#x27;Captains Courageous&#x27;, &#x27;The Two-Man Air Force&#x27;, and &#x27;Damon and Pythias&#x27;. On a March 8, 1944 mission near Berlin, Gentile and Godfrey teamed up to claim six Bf 109s between them. Gentile was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for that mission.
After downing three more planes on April 8, he was the top scoring 8th Air Force pilot when he crashed his P-51, &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, on April 13, 1944, while buzzing the 4th FG&#x27;s Debden airfield for a group of assembled press reporters. Blakeslee immediately grounded Gentile as a result, and he went back to the US for a planned tour selling war bonds. In 1944, Gentile co-wrote with well-known war correspondent Ira Wolfert &quot;One Man Air Force&quot;, an autobiography and account of his combat missions.

Gentile&#x27;s initial claim of 30 aircraft destroyed (including 7 on the ground) was later reduced to a final tally of 19.83 aerial victories and 3 damaged, with 6 ground kills, in 350 combat hours flown plus the two victories claimed while with the RAF Eagle Squadron.

==Post war==
After the war, he stayed with the Air Force, as a test pilot at Wright Field, as a Training Officer in the Fighter Gunnery Program, and as a student officer at the Air Tactical School. In June 1949, Gentile enrolled as an undergraduate studying military science at the University of Maryland.

==Death==
On January 28, 1951, he was killed when he crashed in a T-33A-1-LO Shooting Star trainer, AF Ser. No. &quot;49-0905&quot;, in Forestville, Maryland, leaving behind his wife Isabella Masdea Gentile Beitman (deceased October 2008), and sons Don Jr., Joseph and Pasquale.

Gentile was buried with full military honors in Saint Joseph Cemetery in Lockbourne, Ohio.

Gentile&#x27;s awards and decorations include:
===Distinguished Service Cross citation (1st Award)===

:Gentile, Dominic S.
:Captain (Air Corps), U.S. Army Air Forces
:336th Fighter Squadron, 4th Fighter Group, 8th Air Force
:Date of Action: March 08, 1944

:Citation:

The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Captain (Air Corps) Dominic &quot;Don&quot; Salvatore Gentile, United States Army Air Forces, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy while serving as Pilot of a P-51 Fighter Airplane in the 336th Fighter Squadron, 4th Fighter Group, Eighth Air Force, in aerial combat against enemy forces on 8 March 1944, in the European Theater of Operations. On this date Captain Gentile, while leading a section of Fighter Aircraft on a bomber escort mission to targets in the vicinity of Berlin, Germany, saw a flight of bombers being attacked by approximately fifty enemy fighters. With only his wing man as support and without regard to the overwhelming odds against him, Captain Gentile immediately attacked the enemy formation and by extremely courageous flying and skillful gunnery destroyed three enemy planes and broke up the threat against the bombers. Continuing with his wing man, they destroyed three more enemy fighters. By this time the wing man had expended his ammunition and Captain Gentile&#x27;s supply was very low. Despite this fact, they picked up a straggling bomber and escorted it to friendly territory. Captain Gentile&#x27;s outstanding courage and determination to destroy the enemy on this occasion set an example of heroism which will be an inspiration to the Armed Forces of the United States.

===Distinguished Service Cross citation (2nd Award)===

<text>Florian Biesik (March 4, 1849 in Wilamowice – March 13, 1926 in Trieste) created a literary standard for Vilamovian, trying to prove it did not derive from German, but possibly Frisian, Anglo-Saxon or Dutch.

An Austro-Hungarian civil servant, he was sent to the Adriatic port of Trieste, where he spent most of his professional life as the director of the local post office. After retiring, he moved to the village of Aurisina near the coastal resort of Duino, where he frequented the cultural circles of the local Slovene community.

<text>Charles Delaunay (18 January 1911 – 16 February 1988) was a French author, jazz expert, co-founder and long-term leader of the Hot Club de France.

==Biography==
Born in Paris, France, the son of painters Robert Delaunay and Sonia Delaunay, Charles Delaunay was one of the founders of the Hot Club de France. Together with Hugues Panassié he initiated the Quintette du Hot Club de France with Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grappelli. He also organised concerts, for example with Benny Carter, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, among others.

In 1935, together with Panassié he founded &quot;Le Jazz Hot&quot;, one of the oldest jazz magazines. From 1937, Delaunay shared artists and repertory responsibilities with Panassié on a new record label, Disques Swing (&quot;Swing Records&quot;). As well as the Hot Club ensemble, he has been the manager of French jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, and issued recording by visiting Americans such as Dicky Wells and Coleman Hawkins, as well as Carter. It was among the first record labels dedicated exclusively to jazz. &quot;Jazz hot&quot; ceased publication in summer 1939, being revived in March 1945. During World War II, Delaunay was a member of the Resistance, but continued leading the Hot Club. In 1948, Delaunay founded the record label Disques Vogue and was one of the first people to introduce bop into France, but Panassié did not even consider the new music to be jazz. Delaunay was the author of &quot;Hot Discography&quot; which ran to five editions in England, France and the US (the first jazz discography) and also worked as an artist.

Delaunay died in Vineuil Saint Firmin (Oise, France) of Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 1988.

<doc id="765762" wikidata="Q17108877" url="?curid=765762" title="Local marketing agreement">
<text>In North American broadcasting, a local marketing agreement (LMA), or local management agreement, is a contract in which one company agrees to operate a radio or television station owned by another party. In essence, it is a sort of lease or time-buy.

Under Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations, a local marketing agreement must give the company operating the station (the &quot;senior&quot; partner) under the agreement control over the entire facilities of the station, including the finances, personnel and programming of the station. Its original licensee (the &quot;junior&quot; partner) still remains legally responsible for the station and its operations, such as compliance with relevant regulations regarding content. Occasionally, a &quot;local marketing agreement&quot; may refer to the sharing or contracting of only certain functions, in particular advertising sales. This may also be referred to as a time brokerage agreement (TBA), local sales agreement (LSA), management services agreement (MSA), or most commonly, a joint sales agreement (JSA) or shared services agreement (SSA). JSAs are counted toward ownership caps for television and radio stations. In Canada, local marketing agreements between domestic stations require the consent of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), although Rogers Media has used a similar arrangement to control a U.S.-based radio station in a border market.

The increased use of sharing agreements by media companies to form consolidated, &quot;virtual&quot; duopolies became controversial between 2009 and 2014, especially arrangements where a company buys a television station&#x27;s facilities and assets, but sells the license to an affiliated third-party &quot;shell&quot; corporation, who then enters into agreements with the owner of the facilities to operate the station on their behalf. Activists have argued that broadcasters were using these agreements as a loophole for the FCC&#x27;s ownership regulations, that they reduce the number of local media outlets in a market through the aggregation or outright consolidation of news programming, and allow station owners to have increased leverage in the negotiation of retransmission consent with local subscription television providers. Station owners have contended that these sharing agreements allow streamlined, cost-effective operations that may be beneficial to the continued operation of lower-rated and/or financially weaker stations, especially in smaller markets.

In 2014 under chairman Tom Wheeler, the FCC began to increase its scrutiny regarding the use of such agreements—particularly joint sales—to evade its policies. On March 31, 2014, the commission voted to make joint sales agreements count as ownership if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time for its partner, and to ban coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the top four stations in a market. Wheeler indicated that he planned to address local marketing and shared services agreements in the future. The change in stance also prompted changes to then-proposed acquisitions by Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcast Group, who, rather than use sharing agreements to control them, moved their existing programming and network affiliations to digital subchannels of existing company-owned stations in the market, or a low-power station (which are not subject to ownership caps), and then relinquished control over the original stations by selling their licenses to third-parties, such as minority-owned broadcasters.

==History and background==
Due to the FCC&#x27;s limits on station ownership at the time (which prevented the common ownership of multiple radio stations), local marketing agreements in radio, in which a smaller station would sell its entire airtime to a third-party in time-buy, were widespread between the 1970s and early 1990s. These alliances gave larger broadcasters a way to expand their reach, and smaller broadcasters a means of obtaining a stable stream of revenue. In 1992, the FCC began allowing broadcasting companies to own multiple radio stations in a single market. Following these changes, local marketing agreements largely fell out of favor for radio, as it was now possible for broadcasters to simply buy another station outright rather than lease it – consequentially triggering a wave of mass consolidation in the radio industry. However, broadcasters still used local marketing agreements to help transition acquired stations to their new owners.

The first local marketing agreement in North American television was formed in 1991, when the Sinclair Broadcast Group purchased Fox affiliate WPGH-TV in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As Sinclair had already owned independent station WPTT (now MyNetworkTV affiliate WPNT) in that market, which would have violated FCC rules which at the time had prohibited television station duopolies, Sinclair decided to sell the lower-rated WPTT to the station&#x27;s manager Eddie Edwards, but continued to operate the station through an LMA (Sinclair eventually repurchased the station – then assigned the call letters WCWB – outright in 2000, after the Federal Communications Commission began permitting common ownership of two television stations in the same market, creating a legal duopoly).

Sinclair&#x27;s use of local marketing agreements would lead to legal issues in 1999, when Glencairn, Ltd. (since restructured as Cunningham Broadcasting) announced that it would acquire Fox affiliate KOKH-TV in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma from Sullivan Broadcasting; Glencairn subsequently announced plans to sell five of its 11 existing stations that were operated by Sinclair under LMAs to that company outright. As the family of Sinclair Broadcast Group founder Julian Smith controlled 97% of Glencairn&#x27;s stock assets (which remains the case under its Cunningham structure) and the company was to be paid with Sinclair stock in turn for the purchases, KOKH and Sinclair-owned WB affiliate KOCB would effectively constitute a duopoly in violation of FCC rules. The Rainbow/PUSH coalition (headed by Jesse Jackson) filed challenges against the sale with the FCC, citing concerns over a single company holding two broadcast licenses in a single market and argued that Glencairn was masquerading as a separate minority-owned company (Edwards, who served as Glencairn&#x27;s president, is African American) when it was really an arm of Sinclair that the company used to gain control of the stations through LMAs. After the FCC updated its media ownership rules to allow a single company to own two television stations in the same market in August 1999, Sinclair restructured the deal to acquire KOKH outright. In 2001, the FCC issued a $40,000 fine against Sinclair for illegally controlling Glencairn.

In 1999, the FCC modified its media ownership rules to count LMAs formed after November 5, 1996 that cover more than 15% of the broadcast day toward the ownership limits for the brokering station&#x27;s owner. Even still, the related joint sales and shared services agreement structures became increasingly common during the 2000s; these outsourcing agreements proliferated between 2011 and 2013, when station owners such as Sinclair and the Nexstar Broadcasting Group began expanding their portfolios by acquiring additional stations in an effort to drive scale as well as to gain leverage in retransmission consent negotiations with cable and satellite television providers.

==Uses==
===Consolidation===
The most common use of an LMA in television broadcasting is to create a &quot;virtual duopoly&quot;, where the stations operated under the agreement are consolidated into a single entity. The operations of the stations can be streamlined for cost-effectiveness through the sharing of resources, such as facilities, advertising sales, personnel and programming. Many broadcasters that engage in the practice believe that such agreements are beneficial to the survival of television stations – especially in smaller markets, where the overall audience reach is considerably less than that of markets that are centered upon densely populated metropolitan areas, and the cost savings achieved through the consolidation of resources and staff may be necessary to fund a station&#x27;s continued operation.

Sharing agreements may also be used as a loophole to control television stations in situations where it is legally impossible to own them outright. For instance, FCC regulations only allowed a single company to own more than one full-powered television station in a given market if there are at least eight distinct station owners, and also prohibits the ownership of two or more of the four highest-rated stations (based on total day viewership) in a market. An LMA or similar agreement does not affect the ownership of the station&#x27;s license, meaning that they do not require the approval of the FCC to establish, and the two stations are still legally considered separate operations from a licensing standpoint. Both Tribune Media and the Gannett Company were required to use shared services agreements as a similar loophole to take control of certain stations in their respective 2013 purchases of Local TV and Belo, as they did not have exemptions to the FCC&#x27;s newspaper cross-ownership restrictions in the affected markets. Both companies have since spun out their publishing arms as independent companies; the Tribune Publishing Company and Gannett Company. Tegna, who holds the former Gannett&#x27;s broadcasting and digital media properties, re-acquired the licenses for most of the affected stations following the split. On November 16, 2017, under the Trump administration, the FCC voted in favor of removing the requirement for a market to still have eight distinct station owners in order to allow duopolies, but the prohibition of owning two of the top four stations in a market remains.

Broadcasters could also collect carriage fees for the stations they operate under sharing agreements on behalf of their owner, often bundling its carriage agreements with those of stations they own outright. This could, especially in LMAs between two stations affiliated with the &quot;major&quot; networks, allow the broadcaster to charge higher fees for retransmission consent to television providers for carrying the stations, which could result in smaller cable companies not being able to afford the higher fees imposed. Cable television providers advocated barring sharing agreements between television stations for this particular reason. In the United States, the FCC no longer allows broadcasters to collude with one another in negotiating retransmission consent fees.

===Operation on behalf of a third-party owner===
Although the majority of LMAs involve the outsourcing of one television station&#x27;s operations to another, occasionally, a company may operate a station under an LMA, JSA or SSA even if it does not already own a station in that market. One example occurred in December 2013, when the Louisiana Media Company (owned by New Orleans Saints and New Orleans Hornets owner Tom Benson) entered into a shared services agreement with Raycom Media to run the former company&#x27;s Fox affiliate in New Orleans, Louisiana, WVUE-DT; while Louisiana Media Company retained the station&#x27;s ownership and license, other assets were assumed by Raycom, which owns stations in markets adjacent to New Orleans (including Baton Rouge, Jackson, Biloxi, Lake Charles and Shreveport) but not within New Orleans itself. Benson had received offers from Raycom and others to buy the station, but was not prepared to sell WVUE outright. On April 4, 2017, Raycom acquired the station for $51.8 million.

===Foreign control of broadcast outlets===

LMAs can also allow companies to control foreign stations from outside of their respective country; Canadian media company Rogers Media used a joint sales agreement to operate Cape Vincent, New York radio station WLYK as a station targeting the nearby Canadian market of Kingston, Ontario, where it owns CKXC-FM and CIKR-FM. Rogers owned a 47% stake in WLYK&#x27;s licensee, Border International Broadcasting. In 2022, the principal owners of My Broadcasting Corporation acquired Border International Broadcasting via 1234567 Corporation, and assumed operations in February 2023.

Similarly, Entravision Communications Corporation controls XHDTV-TDT, a Tijuana, Mexico-based station owned by Televisora Alco, which operated as an English-language station serving the border market of San Diego.

==Effects of LMAs==

Public interest organizations have disapproved of the use of LMAs for virtual duopolies that circumvent the FCC&#x27;s rules due to their effects on the broadcasting industry, particularly the results of consolidation through the irregular use of LMAs. In markets where duopolies are not legally possible, a company may elect to form one by purchasing a station&#x27;s &quot;non-license&quot; assets (such as their physical facilities, programming rights, and other intellectual property), and selling the license itself to a third-party &quot;sidecar&quot; company (which is often affiliated with the purchaser), which in turn, enters into an LMA or a similar agreement with the senior partner. The FCC only recognizes ownership of television stations by the ownership of their license and facility ID, and not by the ownership of these &quot;non-license&quot; assets; this means that the senior partner becomes the &quot;de facto&quot; owner and operator of the station, but the sidecar is still the legal owner. Although the FCC determines a sidecar firm to be an independent entity from the company using it to outsource station operations for licensing purposes, the Securities and Exchange Commission does not make such a designation, requiring reports on sidecars to be included in a broadcaster&#x27;s financial statements.

Both Sinclair and Nexstar became infamous for their frequent use of sidecars as part of their expansion and consolidation tactics, partnering with companies like Cunningham Broadcasting, Deerfield Media, Mission Broadcasting, and even each other in the case of former virtual duopolies in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania between Sinclair-owned CBS affiliate WHP-TV and Nexstar-owned CW affiliate WLYH-TV (which ended in 2015 amid Sinclair&#x27;s acquisition of Allbritton Communications, which saw WHTM-TV sold to Media General to avoid conflicts with WHP, and WYLH&#x27;s license sold to Howard Stirk Holdings), and Rochester, New York between Nexstar-owned CBS affiliate WROC-TV and Sinclair-owned Fox affiliate WUHF (which ended in January 2014 after Deerfield Media acquired ABC affiliate WHAM-TV).

While not to the same, wide extent as Sinclair and Nexstar, some broadcasters have similar business relationships with specific sidecar companies as partners for these agreements:
* Raycom Media had a similar business relationship with American Spirit Media in markets such as Toledo, Ohio (where American Spirit Media purchased Fox affiliate WUPW from LIN Media in 2012, with that station&#x27;s operations being taken over by CBS affiliate WTOL), On the other hand, two Raycom-owned Fox stations, WFLX in West Palm Beach and KNIN-TV in Boise, are managed by Scripps&#x27; WPTV and KIVI-TV respectively.
* Gray Television is affiliated with the sidecar Excalibur Broadcasting – owned by former Gray executive Don Ray. Gray acquired Raycom Media in 2019, giving it control of the American Spirit Media stations. There were exceptions, including WUPV and KYOU-TV—which Raycom acquired outright in advance of the purchase, WUPW/Toledo—whose SSA was included in the sale of parent station WTOL to Tegna due to Gray&#x27;s existing ownership of WTVG, and WFXG/Augusta—which was sold to Lockwood Broadcast Group due to Gray&#x27;s existing WRDW-TV/WAGT-CD duopoly.
* Granite Broadcasting operated virtual duopolies in Fort Wayne, Indiana and Duluth, Minnesota with the sidecar Malara Broadcast Group. The stations were later sold to Quincy Media and SagamoreHill Broadcasting, with Quincy temporarily operating SagamoreHill&#x27;s stations under an SSA. In Fort Wayne, Quincy acquired the previous junior partner, Malara&#x27;s ABC affiliate WPTA, with SagamoreHill taking NBC affiliate WISE-TV instead. 
* News-Press &amp; Gazette Company is affiliated with the sidecar VistaWest Media for stations such as KIDK (which was previously taken over by NPG under Fisher Communications ownership) and KCOY-TV (under Cowles Publishing Company ownership). Both companies are based in St. Joseph, Missouri.

===Effects on programming===
The stations partnered through a sharing agreement may also consolidate their programming operations: local newscasts on the junior partner in the LMA, if it operated a separate news department before the LMA&#x27;s formation, may be rescheduled or scaled back to prevent direct competition with newscasts airing on the station acting as the senior partner (the latter aspect is less common with LMAs involving only stations affiliated with one of the four largest broadcast television networks). The stations may share news-gathering resources, but maintain separate news telecasts that are differentiated by their on-air presentation, anchors, and overall format, with varying degrees of autonomy; in these cases, a seemingly separate newscast on the brokered station in the duopoly may ultimately consist of repackaged news content from the other station. Alternatively, the stations may consolidate their news programming under a single joint brand.

Redundant staff members are often laid off as part of the consolidation process, and the sharing of news content reduces the number of unique editorial voices in the market. This in particular is one of the caveats of pushes to ban outsourcing agreements by media consolidation critics, who also suggest that LMAs result in a decreased amount of local news coverage on the brokered station.

Depending on how the outsourcing agreement is structured, as well as how the brokered station is programmed, how the stations are consolidated and the amount of news programming featured on the brokered station may vary, for example:
* In October 2008, Tribune Broadcasting and Local TV LLC consolidated the operations of their respective CW and Fox affiliates in Denver and St. Louis, resulting from a groupwide management agreement between both companies. In Denver, CW affiliate KWGN-TV moved into Fox affiliate KDVR&#x27;s facilities in the Speer neighborhood; while in St. Louis, Fox affiliate KTVI – despite being the senior partner in the LMA with CW affiliate KPLR – moved into the latter station&#x27;s Maryland Heights studios. Both cities were (and still are) top-25 markets, making Denver and St. Louis the largest where any English-language stations were involved in an LMA; however, both cities had enough stations to allow a legal duopoly (this was not possible with KPLR and KTVI as both were among the four highest-rated stations in St. Louis at the time, placing ahead of ratings-challenged ABC affiliate KDNL-TV), and were large enough to support at least four television news operations (Denver had five and St. Louis had four news-producing stations prior to the formation of the LMA).
:KWGN and KPLR moved The CW&#x27;s primetime lineup one hour later (to 8:00 p.m.) than the network-recommended timeslot, and shifted their evening newscasts to 7:00 p.m. (weekend editions of the evening newscasts were discontinued with the move; KPLR has since expanded its 7:00 p.m. newscast to Saturday and Sunday evenings) to avoid competing with KDVR and KTVI&#x27;s 9:00 p.m. newscasts; KWGN retained its weekday morning newscast (which competes directly with KDVR&#x27;s morning newscast), but canceled its 5:30 p.m. – and later, 11:00 a.m. – newscasts. In contrast, KPLR (which had run a primetime newscast for much of its history) eventually added hour-long midday and late afternoon newscasts. The two LMA arrangements became legal duopolies in December 2013, once Tribune finalized its acquisition of Local TV.
* In 2009, Raycom Media (owner of Honolulu-based NBC and MyNetworkTV affiliates, KHNL and KFVE) announced it would take over the operations of local CBS affiliate KGMB (then owned by MCG Capital Corporation), giving it control of three of the television stations in Hawaii. The deal was a complex arrangement which involved trading the non-license assets of KFVE (such as its call sign, programming, and network affiliation) for those of KGMB (effectively placing the station under Raycom ownership, but using KFVE&#x27;s license, signal, and virtual channel 5), and taking over KFVE (which moved to the channel 9 license owned by MCG Capital) under a shared services agreement. Due to its nature, the swap was not a transaction that would require the intervention of the FCC, aside from the changing of call signs. The three stations were then folded into a shared news operation branded as &quot;Hawaii News Now&quot;. An estimated 68 positions from a total of 198 from the three stations would be eliminated as part of the agreement. On November 20, 2013, MCG Capital filed to sell KFVE to the aforementioned American Spirit Media. Following the acquisition of Raycom by Gray Television, KFVE&#x27;s license was sold to Nexstar, who relaunched the station as a sister to its Fox affiliate KHON-TV.
* In 2010, the operations of Schurz Communications-owned NBC affiliate WAGT in Augusta, Georgia were taken over by Media General-owned ABC affiliate WJBF-TV. Both stations were consolidated into new, high-definition capable facilities constructed on the site of a former Barnes &amp; Noble store, with separate studios for each station, and a third, shared studio. Despite the consolidation, the two stations aimed to maintain some autonomy from each other: both WAGT and WJBF maintained their own on-air identities, newsrooms, and sales departments within the facility. While the newscasts on both stations did share some &quot;factual&quot; video content, they were otherwise produced independently of each other. However, upon the consolidation, most of WAGT&#x27;s managerial staff were dismissed and other employees were reassigned to different positions. The agreement was unwound after Gray&#x27;s purchase of the station, but briefly reinstated following legal action by Media General. After the injunction was struck down, Gray re-assumed control of WAGT on March 28, 2016, adding 5:30 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. newscasts exclusive to the station, with the remainder simulcast from WRDW.
* In 2010, Nexstar announced a new joint news operation under the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; title for its consolidated cluster in Utica/Rome, New York, which consists of Nexstar-owned Fox and MyNetworkTV affiliates WFXV and WPNY-LP, and Mission-owned ABC affiliate WUTR. Unlike the other examples, neither station had a pre-existing newscast at the time; WUTR&#x27;s original news department was closed in 2003 by previous owner Clear Channel Communications as a cost-saving measure, and WFXV had never aired local news programming at all. Its slate included early and late evening newscasts on WUTR, an encore of WUTR&#x27;s evening newscast on WPNY, and a 10:00 p.m. newscast on WFXV with a fast-paced format targeting younger demographics. The station&#x27;s executive vice president, Steve Merren (who had come from NBC affiliate WKTV, which had the sole television news operation in the market prior to the formation of Nexstar&#x27;s news operation) believed that it &quot;[was] important that the community has another source of news. We have one newspaper and one news station and the community could benefit from another voice.&quot;
* In Evansville, Indiana, Mission Broadcasting acquired then-independent station WTVW (now a CW affiliate) in 2011 with its former owner Nexstar Broadcasting retaining operational duties under an SSA. WTVW consolidated news operations with ABC affiliate WEHT, for which Nexstar traded WTVW to Mission in exchange for acquiring WEHT from Gilmore Broadcasting Corporation, and had its newscast output reduced through the reductions of its weekday morning newscast from four hours to two and its 6:00 p.m. newscast – except on Sundays, where it remained one hour – from one hour to 30 minutes (leaving only a two-hour morning newscast, half-hour noon and 6:30 p.m. newscasts and an hour-long newscast at 9:00 p.m.). Both stations were then folded into a shared news operation branded as &quot;Eyewitness News&quot;.
* In November 2011, in the Tucson, Arizona, market, Belo relinquished the operations of its Fox and MyNetworkTV duopoly KMSB and KTTU to Raycom Media. Operations of the two stations, along with production of KMSB&#x27;s 9:00 p.m. newscast, were assumed by Raycom&#x27;s CBS station KOLD-TV. Belo Media Operations president Peter L. Diaz touted that the consolidation would result in &quot;better produced, increased news programming for the Tucson market,&quot; citing Raycom&#x27;s addition of a locally produced morning newscast to KMSB, and the upgrade of KMSB&#x27;s news programming to high definition as part of the transition. Although ruling out the need to do so in other markets, Diaz noted that the agreements &quot;[allowed] us to increase our news product that we couldn&#x27;t afford to do otherwise.&quot; The consolidation resulted in layoffs for almost all of the two stations&#x27; employees, aside from advertising sales staff, which remained employed by Belo but worked from KOLD&#x27;s facilities. The acquisition of Belo by Gannett in 2013 had few effects on the virtual triopoly; although the stations&#x27; licenses were sold to third-parties to satisfy newspaper cross-ownership restrictions, Raycom still operates the stations, but their sales departments remained operated by Gannett. The licenses were, in turn, sold to Tegna—the spin-out of Gannett&#x27;s broadcasting division, in December 2015.
* The 2012 sale of Newport Television led to the formation of two full-power virtual quadropolies. In Little Rock, Arkansas, Nexstar and Mission Broadcasting formed a virtual quadropoly consisting of two duopolies; NBC station KARK-TV and MyNetworkTV station KARZ-TV (owned by Nexstar), along with Fox station KLRT-TV and CW station KASN (owned by Mission, operated by Nexstar under a local marketing agreement). All four stations were consolidated into KARK&#x27;s facilities; 30 employees were laid off as part of the consolidation. As a result, KLRT reduced its weeknight 5:00 p.m. newscast from one hour to 30 minutes (limiting it to the 5:30 half-hour) and dropped its 10:00 p.m. newscast, while adding a two-hour weekday morning newscast and retaining its existing hour-long newscast at 9:00 p.m. 
:Sinclair formed a similar arrangement in Mobile, Alabama between its existing Pensacola duopoly of ABC affiliate WEAR-TV and MyNetworkTV affiliate WFGX, and the newly acquired Mobile duopoly of NBC affiliate WPMI and independent station WJTC (owned by Deerfield Media). However, the stations were not consolidated, and maintain their own studio facilities, news departments and staff. WEAR and WPMI also produce competing 9:00 p.m. newscasts for their respective duopoly partners.

==Reaction and government action==
In February 2001, Clear Channel Communications subsidiary Citicasters was fined $25,000 for its use of time brokerage agreements and litigation for unlawfully controlling Youngstown, Ohio area radio station WBTJ (101.9 FM, now WYLR); the company had also been the target of complaints for using KFJO (FM) to rebroadcast KSJO after it had nominally sold KFJO to minority-owned interests.

In 2009, the Media Council of Hawaii complained to the FCC about Raycom&#x27;s &quot;Hawaii News Now&quot; operation, stating that it would &quot;directly reduce the diversity of local voices in a community by replacing independent newscasts on the brokered station with those of the brokering station.&quot; In response, the FCC stated it would begin to investigate into the matter.

In 2011, after temporarily losing its Fox affiliation for WFFT-TV to a subchannel of WISE-TV due to a reverse compensation dispute, Nexstar (ironically, given its use of similar practices in other markets) filed an antitrust lawsuit against the station&#x27;s managing partner, Granite Broadcasting, arguing that it had built a monopoly on local advertising sales by having effective control of the outlets for four major networks (ABC and MyNetworkTV on WPTA, and NBC, Fox, and The CW on WISE-TV; owned by Malara Broadcast Group and operated under agreements by Granite). The lawsuit was settled in February 2013 via mutual agreement, after which the Fox affiliation was given back to WFFT.

===Acquisitions===
====Gannett acquisition of Belo====

Gannett Company&#x27;s 2013 acquisition of Belo was opposed by organizations such as the American Cable Association and Free Press, due to Gannett&#x27;s plans to use LMAs and two shell companies owned by former Belo and Fisher Communications executives (respectively, Sander Media and Tucker Operating Co.) to dodge FCC newspaper cross-ownership restrictions in Louisville, Phoenix, Portland, Oregon and Tucson. Although Gannett contended that the arrangements were legal, Free Press president Craig Aaron stated that &quot;the FCC shouldn&#x27;t let Gannett break the rules. Media consolidation results in fewer journalists in the newsroom and fewer opinions on the airwaves. Concentrating media outlets in the hands of just a few companies benefits only the companies themselves.&quot; The deal would have given Gannett a virtual triopoly in Phoenix, consisting of its NBC station KPNX, independent station KTVK and CW affiliate KASW. In Tucson, Fox affiliate KMSB and MyNetworkTV affiliate KTTU were already operated by Raycom Media&#x27;s CBS affiliate KOLD-TV under a shared services agreement established under Belo ownership, but Gannett would still handle advertising sales for the stations.

In December 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice blocked Gannett from using an agreement with Sander Media to operate CBS affiliate KMOV in St. Louis alongside its own NBC station KSDK, and ordered Gannett to sell KMOV. Even though Gannett planned to operate KMOV separately from KSDK, the Department ruled the agreement to be a violation of antitrust law, as it would reduce competition for advertising sales. Following the closure of the Belo purchase, Meredith Corporation announced a deal to purchase KMOV, along with KTVK and KASW. As Meredith would have a duopoly between KTVK and its Phoenix CBS affiliate KPHO-TV, KASW was to be sold to SagamoreHill Broadcasting and operated by Meredith under an LMA. As a result of the FCC&#x27;s scrutiny on any new station sharing agreements, on October 23, 2014, Meredith would backtrack on this plan and instead sell KASW to the Nexstar Broadcasting Group, which would operate the station independently of KTVK and KPHO.

Following Gannett&#x27;s split into independent broadcasting and publishing companies, Tegna, Inc.—the owner of Gannett&#x27;s stations following the split, bought back the licenses to the Sander Media stations, placing them back under its full control.

====Sinclair acquisition of Allbritton====
As part of its planned acquisition of Allbritton Communications, Sinclair originally planned to sell its existing stations in three markets – Charleston, South Carolina, Birmingham, Alabama and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania – where Allbritton already owned stations, but continue to operate them under local marketing agreements. WABM and WTTO in Birmingham and WHP-TV in Harrisburg were to be sold to Deerfield Media, and WMMP in Charleston was to be sold to Howard Stirk Holdings–a broadcasting company owned by conservative pundit Armstrong Williams. Howard Stirk Holdings was first established in 2013 with its acquisition of two conflicting stations in Sinclair&#x27;s earlier acquisition of Barrington Broadcasting.

In December 2013, FCC Video Division Chief Barbara Kreisman sent a letter demanding information from the Sinclair Broadcast Group on the financial aspects of its &quot;sidecar&quot; operations, and warned that in the three aforementioned markets, &quot;the proposed transactions would result in the elimination of the grandfathered status of certain local marketing agreements and thus cause the transactions to violate our local TV ownership rules.&quot; It was asserted that the deal might only be legal if the affected stations were operated under shared services agreements. Sinclair restructured the deal in March 2014, choosing to sell WHP-TV, WMMP and WABM, and terminate an SSA with the Cunningham-owned Fox affiliate WTAT in Charleston to acquire the Allbritton-owned stations in those markets (WCIV, WHTM-TV and WBMA-LD, while also creating a new duopoly between the ABC and CW affiliates in Birmingham), as well as foregoing any operational or financial agreements with the buyers of the stations being sold to other parties.

In May 2014, Sinclair disclosed in an FCC filling that it was unable to find buyers for the three affected stations, requiring changes to its transaction. In Harrisburg, Sinclair chose to retain WHP-TV, and divest WHTM to Media General. However, in Charleston and Birmingham, the company proposed to shut down stations entirely (rather than selling them to other buyers that would also handle their operational responsibilities) so it could maintain legal duopolies; surrendering the licenses for WCIV and the full-powered repeaters of WBMA-LD (WJSU and WCFT), and moving their ABC programming to Sinclair&#x27;s existing stations WMMP and WABM respectively – which would shift their existing MyNetworkTV programming to digital subchannels. After nearly a year of delays, Sinclair&#x27;s deal to acquire Allbritton was approved by the FCC on July 24, 2014.

==== Nexstar acquisition of Tribune ====
Nexstar Media Group acquired Tribune Media in 2019; to meet ownership limits, it divested 21 stations to the E. W. Scripps Company, Tegna Inc., and Circle City Broadcasting. The divested stations included Tribune&#x27;s New York City flagship WPIX; the station was sold to Scripps, but with a $75 million option for Nexstar to buy it back between March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021. Nexstar transferred this option to Mission Broadcasting, who subsequently exercised it in August 2020 (the following month, Scripps announced its intent to acquire Ion Media, including its New York station WPXN-TV). In October 2022, Nexstar would acquire a majority ownership in that station&#x27;s network affiliation, The CW.

In March 2024, the FCC fined Nexstar and Mission $1.2 million and $612,395 respectively, and ordered Mission to sell WPIX within twelve months; the FCC found that Mission&#x27;s agreements with Nexstar to operate WPIX amounted to an &quot;unauthorized transfer of control&quot; of the station, thus exceeding the FCC&#x27;s 39% market share limit for broadcasters. Nexstar must either divest other stations so it can legally own WPIX, or Mission must sell the station to a third-party. Mission Broadcasting also scrapped its planned acquisition of Detroit&#x27;s MyNetworkTV station WADL (which briefly became Detroit&#x27;s new CW affiliate in September 2023 after CBS News and Stations dropped long-time affiliate WKBD) after the FCC imposed conditions on Nexstar&#x27;s involvement in the station. WADL had dropped The CW in late-October following demands that it be compensated for its &quot;transitional&quot; carriage of the network while the acquisition pended; independent station WMYD would carry the network for the remainder of the television season, before ultimately returning to WKBD.

===FCC limits on joint sales agreements for television stations===
In response to criticism of the virtual duopolies and sharing agreements, the FCC began to consider potential changes to address these loopholes. In March 2013, the Commission first tabled a proposal that would make joint sales agreements count the same as ownership.

In January 2014 town hall meeting, FCC chairman Tom Wheeler disclosed that he planned to place more scrutiny on the use of LMA-style agreements and shell companies, stating that &quot;there were a couple of references in a couple of recent decisions in which we&#x27;ve said that we&#x27;re going to do things differently going forward on what were called these shell corporations.&quot; Later that month, it was reported that the FCC had placed all pending acquisitions involving the use of shell companies on hold, so the Commission could discuss changes to its policies. Among the deals affected by this decision included the aforementioned Sinclair/Allbritton purchase.

On March 6, 2014, the FCC announced that it would hold a vote on March 31 on a proposal to ban joint sales agreements involving television stations outright, making them attributable to FCC ownership limits if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time of a competing junior partner station in the JSA; the ban applies to both existing sharing agreements under such a structure as well as pending station transactions that include a JSA. Station owners would be given a two-year grace period to unwind or modify joint sales agreements in violation of the policy; coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market would also be barred under the proposal. Wheeler also proposed an expedited process to review joint sales agreements on a case-by-case basis, granting a waiver of the rules if a broadcaster can prove a particular joint sales agreement arrangement serves the public interest.

On March 12, 2014, the FCC Media Bureau released a notice that it would further analyze television station transactions that include sharing agreements, particularly those that include a purchase option that &quot;may counter any incentive the licensee has to increase the value of the station, since the licensee may be unlikely to realize that increased value.&quot; Under the new provisions, broadcasters must demonstrate in their transaction applications as to how such deals would serve the public interest. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) – which, along with station groups such as Sinclair Broadcast Group, have disapproved of the proposal to ban JSAs – presented a compromise proposal, in which the brokered licensee in a sharing agreement would retain control over at least 85 percent of the station&#x27;s programming, maintain at least 70 percent of ad sales revenue and &quot;maintain at least 20 percent of station value in the license itself&quot;. FCC commissioner Ajit Pai, and Gordon Smith, president of the NAB, were also opposed to the new rules on joint sales agreements, believing that they would discourage the ownership of television stations by minority-owned companies. Tom Wheeler, however, proposed the restrictions in the hopes of encouraging more women and minorities to own stations, due to the ongoing consolidation in the television industry through company mergers and sharing agreements.

On March 31, 2014, the FCC voted 3–2 to approve the proposed ban on joint sales agreements and voted 5–0 to approve the proposed ban on coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the four highest-rated stations within a given market; the JSA ban went into effect on June 19, 2014. Under the restrictions, the FCC would rule on waivers to maintain select existing JSAs within 90 days of the application&#x27;s filing. The FCC also began a request for comment on policies to address other agreements, such as shared services agreements. The prohibition on television JSAs had been proposed as early as 2004, a year after the FCC voted to treat JSAs between radio stations as duopolies. Despite this fact, broadcasting companies criticized the ban, accusing the Commission of using it as a move to encourage participation in a spectrum incentive auction then set to occur in 2015, and stating that the ban would place them at a disadvantage during retransmission consent negotiations with pay television providers.

On December 19, 2015, as a rider to the federal budget, the grace period for unwinding or modifying existing JSAs was extended to 10 years. On May 25, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit struck down the restrictions on joint sales agreements, ruling that the FCC cannot manipulate its ownership rules without &quot;[in] the previous four years, [fulfilling] its obligation to review [the] rule and determine whether it is in the public interest&quot;. On November 16, 2017, under the Trump administration, the FCC voted in favor of no longer having JSAs attributable to ownership.

===Divestment and subchannel consolidation of stations===
The increased scrutiny being imposed by the FCC regarding local marketing, shared services, and joint sales agreements have led to more drastic measures by broadcasting companies attempting to use them in acquisitions; in 2014, two broadcasting companies declared intents to shut acquired stations down entirely and consolidate their programming onto existing stations through multicasting, rather than attempting to use sidecars and sharing agreements or selling them to other parties that would assume full responsibility of their day-to-day operations.

In May 2014, Sinclair informed the FCC that it was unable to find buyers for WABM or WMMP – the company&#x27;s MyNetworkTV stations in Birmingham, Alabama, and Charleston, South Carolina, that it planned to sell in its purchase of Allbritton Communications. In Birmingham, the company proposed surrendering the licenses of WCFT-TV and WJSU-TV – the two full-powered satellites of ABC affiliate WBMA-LD, converting WABM into a full-powered satellite of WBMA-LD – and moving its existing MyNetworkTV programming to a digital subchannel of WABM (although the WBMA-LD simulcast was placed on WABM&#x27;s subchannel instead while MyNetworkTV programming was retained on its main channel). Similarly, in Charleston, Sinclair planned to surrender WCIV&#x27;s license and move its ABC affiliation and programming to WMMP. In both cases, Sinclair believed that its own stations had superior technical facilities than those of the stations it intends to surrender. Sinclair was able to retain WBMA-LD in any event as the FCC does not impose any ownership limits on low-power stations.

On June 13, 2014, Gray Television announced that it would shutter six stations and consolidate existing programming onto subchannels of Gray-owned stations in their respective market. Unlike Sinclair, however, Gray stated that it would sell the licenses of the shuttered stations to minority-owned broadcasters in collaboration with the Minority Media and Telecommunications Council – under the condition that they would operate them independently from other stations in the market, and without the use of any sharing agreements. All six of the stations were owned by companies other than Gray, but their non-license assets are either owned by Gray, or were operated by stations now owned by Gray under agreements. Gray would operate the affected stations under LMAs until the sales and consolidation are complete. Aside from one, most of the stations involved in these changes were related to Gray&#x27;s acquisition of stations from Hoak Media. Three of these stations were immediately shut down the same day, while the remainder remained operated by Gray until the sales were completed. Gray announced buyers for the stations on August 27, 2014.

The six stations affected by Gray&#x27;s move included:
* KHAS-TV (Hastings/Lincoln, Nebraska), previously owned by Hoak. On June 13, 2014, KHAS-TV was shut down and its NBC programming was moved to the primary channel of KSNB-TV (channel 4). Gray had bought KSNB under a failing station waiver to form a duopoly with CBS station KOLN/KGIN, and operated the station as a MyNetworkTV/MeTV affiliate with local programming focused on central Nebraska; this existing programming was moved to KSNB-DT2 upon the transition. On August 27, 2014, the station was sold to Legacy Broadcasting. On May 21, 2018, Gray agreed to acquire KNHL from Legacy Broadcasting for $475,000, becoming a satellite station of KSNB-TV.
* KNDX/KXND (Bismarck/Minot, North Dakota), owned by Prime Cities Broadcasting, which asked the FCC to dismiss the sale of the stations to Excalibur Broadcasting (a sidecar owned by former Gray executive Don Ray), which would have made them sisters to the NBC North Dakota chain being acquired from Hoak by Gray. Gray acquired the stations&#x27; non-license assets on May 1, 2014; both stations were then taken off the air on June 13, 2014, with Fox programming being moved to subchannels of the NBC North Dakota stations (KMOT, KQCD-TV and KFYR-TV). On August 27, 2014, the stations were sold to Legacy Broadcasting.
* KXJB-TV and KAQY (Fargo, North Dakota and Columbia/Monroe, Louisiana–El Dorado, Arkansas), both owned by Parker Broadcasting and operated by Hoak (now Gray) stations. Both were originally to be sold to Excalibur Broadcasting. On August 27, 2014, KXJB-TV was sold to Major Market Broadcasting, and KAQY to Legacy Broadcasting.
* KJCT (Grand Junction, Colorado), acquired by Excalibur in August 2013 from News-Press &amp; Gazette Company, and taken over by Gray-owned KKCO following the acquisition. On August 27, 2014, the station was sold to Chang Media Group, and was later re-launched as Cozi TV station KGBY.

Following the approval of Sinclair&#x27;s purchase of Allbritton, commissioner Ajit Pai further criticized the FCC&#x27;s new policies and its endorsement of Sinclair&#x27;s proposal to shut down stations to comply with them. Describing the three Allbritton stations as being &quot;victims&quot; of the &quot;crackdown&quot; against joint sales agreements, he stated regarding WCIV that &quot;apparently the Commission believes that it is better for that station to go out of business than for Howard Stirk Holdings to own the station and participate in a joint sales agreement with Sinclair. I strongly disagree. And so too, I&#x27;ll bet, would consumers in Charleston.&quot; In September 2014, Sinclair backtracked on its original plans, and reached deals to sell WCIV, WCFT and WJSU&#x27;s license assets to Howard Stirk Holdings for $50,000 each and lease them studio space, pending FCC approval. Unlike Howard Stirk Holdings&#x27; other stations, they are operated and programmed independently, and Sinclair did not enter into any agreements to operate the stations on Stirk&#x27;s behalf.

In Quincy Newspapers&#x27; acquisition of Granite Broadcasting&#x27;s remaining stations, the acquisition was briefly re-structured to have Malara Broadcast Group—which served as a virtual duopoly partner for Granite with WISE-TV (NBC) Fort Wayne and KDLH-TV Duluth (CBS), retain the stations and their current agreements with WPTA and KBJR-TV in lieu of having them sold to SagamoreHill Broadcasting. The acquisition was restructured in July 2015 to, again, have SagamoreHill Broadcasting acquire the two stations, but have their current SSAs wound down within nine months. Following the end of the SSA, the two stations retained The CW as independently run stations, with their remaining affiliations moved to subchannels of KBJR and WPTA. Quincy similarly wound down an SSA in Peoria, Illinois with Sinclair-owned WHOI by trading its South Bend Fox affiliation (previously held by WSJV-TV) to Sinclair (where it moved to a subchannel of WSBT-TV), in exchange for WHOI&#x27;s ABC and CW affiliations, which moved to subchannels of WEEK-TV. In 2018, Quincy re-purchased WISE and KDLH, under an assertion that both stations were not within the top 4 of their respective markets.

===WAGT dispute===

In February 2016, Gray Television acquired Schurz Communications&#x27; stations, including Augusta, Georgia&#x27;s WAGT. As Gray could not own both WAGT and its existing CBS affiliate WRDW-TV as a legal duopoly, Gray proposed the sale of WAGT&#x27;s broadcast spectrum during the incentive auction, and for WAGT to go silent upon completion of the deal so the company would not be running more than one of the top four stations in the market. Gray also requested special temporary authority for WAGT&#x27;s signal to be replaced on its existing technical facilities and UHF channel 30 by the co-owned low-power station, WRDW-CD; low-power stations are not subject to ownership caps and restrictions on duopolies.

The FCC, however, required that Gray continue to operate WAGT as a separate station through the end of the auction, and not enter into any joint sales agreements. Upon the closure of the sale, Gray unwound the shared services and joint sales agreements that Schurz had established with WJBF-TV and Media General, and replaced its previous news programs with simulcasts from WRDW. Gray also accused WJBF of &quot;[refusing] to agree to a smooth transition of personnel [from WAGT]&quot;, as WAGT&#x27;s employees fall under the employment of Media General due to the SSA.

On February 26, 2016, Media General obtained a preliminary injunction against Gray for violating the SSA and JSA, which required that Gray return control of WAGT to Media General, and forbade Gray from selling WAGT in the spectrum incentive auction. The company accused Gray of using the spectrum auction and sale of the station to exit the agreements illegitimately, as they were to last through 2020, and apply to any future owner of WAGT. Gray attempted to block the injunction by arguing that its actions were required in order to comply with the FCC&#x27;s prohibition of joint sales agreements, but was denied. Media General took back control of WAGT on March 7, 2016.

On March 10, 2016, FCC Deputy General Counsel David Gossett announced that the Commission would investigate Media General&#x27;s actions as possibly being in violation of Section 310(d) of the Communications Act. Gossett argued that by legally blocking Gray&#x27;s participation in the spectrum auction, Media General had &quot;[sought] injunctive relief that interferes with a licensee&#x27;s ultimate control of a station&quot;. He also stated that the FCC could consider a license revocation hearing against Media General under Section 312 of the Communications Act. On March 23, 2016, the Supreme Court of Georgia struck down the injunction without addressing the litigation, and Gray took back control of WAGT. On July 13, 2016, Media General was issued a $700,000 fine by the FCC. WAGT&#x27;s spectrum sold for $40,763,036.

=== DirecTV lawsuit ===
In March 2023, DirecTV sued Nexstar Media Group, alleging that it was conspiring with the sidecar companies Mission Broadcasting and White Knight Broadcasting to manipulate retransmission fees for its stations. The company, which had been in a carriage dispute with Mission and White Knight since October 2022, stated that the companies &quot;effectively relinquished decision-making authority to Nexstar, which has served as the ringleader of a conspiracy to harm competition and violate the antitrust laws.&quot;

==Internationally==
===Canada===
Local marketing agreements are effectively prohibited under the regulations of the CRTC, which require that all broadcast undertakings be &quot;operated in fact by the licensee itself&quot;. Rogers Media and Newcap Broadcasting maintained a joint sales agreement pertaining to CHNO-FM in Sudbury, Ontario, but community interests and the lobby group Friends of Canadian Broadcasting presented substantial evidence to the CRTC that in practice, the agreement was a &quot;de facto&quot; LMA, going significantly beyond advertising sales into program production and news-gathering. In early 2005, the CRTC ordered the agreement to cease.

For a time, CKEY-FM in Fort Erie, Ontario had a JSA with Citadel Communications to handle advertising sales for the station under a revenue sharing agreement, integrating it with its cluster in nearby Buffalo, New York. In an associated agreement, the station also contracted Citadel employees to produce some of its programming. Due to the structure of this JSA, and because the aforementioned programming was overseen by local producers, the CRTC deemed that the agreement did not equate to a transfer of &quot;effective control&quot; of the station to Citadel, and thus complied with its regulations (taking greater issue with the amount of locally-reflective programming carried by the station).

Rogers Media holds a time-brokerage agreement with CBC Television to air &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; on the network as part of its exclusive rights to the National Hockey League, in order to maintain the long-running franchise and the league&#x27;s presence on CBC. In exchange for assigning commercial advertising time to Rogers, the CBC does not pay a rights fee, and also receives advertising time for its own programming during &quot;Hockey Night&quot; broadcasts. The CBC also initially received payments for use of some of its staff and its Toronto studios. To legally assign responsibility to Rogers, the broadcasts are considered to be the programming of a CRTC-licensed television network owned by Rogers&#x27; Sportsnet subsidiary, which has an affiliation with all of CBC Television&#x27;s stations. Despite the legal nature of this arrangement, the broadcasts still contain CBC Television continuity and branding.

===Philippines===
In 2008, the Filipino Associated Broadcasting Company leased its airtime to the Malaysian media conglomerate Media Prima (through the local subsidiary MPB Primedia) similar to an LMA – with MPB Primedia providing entertainment programming, and ABC handling news programming and operations. Soon afterward, ABC and Media Prima were sued by rival media company GMA for attempting to use the partnership to skirt laws requiring domestic ownership of broadcasters. In response, ABC&#x27;s media relations head Pat Marcelo-Magbanua reiterated that the subsidiary was a Filipino company which was self-registered and Filipino-run. The concerns became moot in 2010, when Media Prima announced it would divest its ownership in the network to PLDT&#x27;s broadcasting subsidiary MediaQuest Holdings.

Throughout the last week of June 2011, several plugs with the statement &quot;Si Pangga, Dreaming!&quot; were heard on the then-Interactive Broadcast Media-owned DWET-FM (106.7 mHz, then licensed in Quezon City), which had just ended its broadcast under the previous smooth jazz format &quot;Dream FM&quot;. Later on, it was revealed that Ultrasonic Broadcasting System, a radio network owned by the SYSU Group of Companies, has started operating the station under LMA as contemporary MOR &quot;Energy FM on Dream 106.7&quot; (later changed to &quot;106.7 Energy FM&quot; once the station&#x27;s eventual sale to UBS was completed).

The term &quot;airtime lease&quot; is also used by other media entities, particularly those from larger media companies that has a lack of obtaining its broadcast franchise from the Congress (for example, ABS-CBN Corporation leased the airtime from GMA Network, AMBS&#x27; All TV and Globe Telecom&#x27;s BEAM TV), while others are owned by various herbal supplement manufacturers. Only Brigada Mass Media Corporation and Bandera News Philippines operate a handful of radio stations under the same method.

<text>Anat (, ), Anatu, classically Anath (; &quot;ʿnt&quot;; &quot;ʿĂnāṯ&quot;; ; ; Egyptian: &quot;&quot;) was a goddess associated with warfare and hunting, best known from the Ugaritic texts. Most researchers assume that she originated in the Amorite culture of Bronze Age upper Mesopotamia, and that the goddess Ḫanat, attested in the texts from Mari and worshiped in a city sharing her name located in Suhum, should be considered her forerunner. 

In Ugarit, Anat was one of the main goddesses, and regularly received offerings, as attested in texts written both in the local Ugaritic language and in Hurrian. She also frequently appears in myths, including the &quot;Baal Cycle&quot; and the &quot;Epic of Aqhat&quot;. In the former, she is portrayed as a staunch ally of the weather god Baal, who assists him in his struggle for kingship, helps him with obtaining the permission to obtain a dwelling of his own, and finally mourns and avenges his death at the hands of the personified death, Mot. The precise nature of the relation between Anat and Baal is uncertain, and the conventional views that they were lovers, siblings or both remain a matter of dispute among researchers. Another deity who frequently appears alongside her is Ashtart. Interactions between Anat and the sun goddess Shapash and moon god Yarikh are described in myths as well. In Hurrian ritual texts, she appears alongside deities such as Šimige, Aštabi and Nupatik. Elsewhere in the Levant and in nearby regions of inland Syria, Anat&#x27;s status apparently was not equally high, though she is nonetheless attested in Emar, Hazor and elsewhere.

At some point in time in the Bronze Age, either during the reign of Hyksos or shortly after its end, Anat was introduced to Egypt, and achieved a degree of prominence during the reign of Ramesses II, whose devotion to her is well attested. Evidence for Egyptian worship of Anat is also available from various sites in Palestine which were controlled by the pharaohs in the Bronze Age. She remained a part of the Egyptian pantheon as late as in the Roman period. In the first millennium BCE, she also continued to be worshiped in Suhum in Mesopotamia. She is also attested in a number of Phoenician inscriptions. Most of them come from Cyprus. They indicate that on this island an association developed between her and the Greek goddess Athena based on their similar character. The only references to Anat in the Hebrew Bible are indirect, and are limited to toponyms and theophoric names, which is presumed to indicate that she was not commonly worshiped in the Kingdom of Israel.

Anat was characterized as a fertility goddess associated with human sexuality in early scholarship, but despite the occasional modern support, this view is no longer the consensus among experts. Proposed etymologies of her name and interpretations of texts she appears in are a subject of criticism. The view that goddesses of Ugarit and other nearby areas were interchangeable and had no individual traits, which often shaped early publications about Anat, is also no longer accepted.

==Origin==
According to Wilfred G. Lambert, Anat should be identified with the goddess Ḫanat (a transcription without the breve below the first consonant, Hanat, is also in use) known from the texts from Mari, and originally worshiped further south, in Suhum. While Jean-Marie Durand argues against this connection, and his view has also been adopted by Lluís Feliu, Lambert&#x27;s theory has been accepted by a number of other researchers, including Wilfred G. E. Watson, Gebhard J. Selz, Volkert Haas and Daniel Schwemer. Multiple Assyriologists, including Andrew R. George and Julia M. Asher-Greve, outright refer to the goddess from Suhum, still worshiped there in later periods, simply as Anat, and it has been pointed out that her name, while originally rendered as Ḫanat in documents pertaining to this area, is written as &quot;an-at&quot; in inscriptions of local origin from the first millennium BCE. 

In the light of Lambert&#x27;s theory, Anat, like her presumed forerunner Ḫanat, would be an Amorite deity in origin.

Multiple etymologies of Anat&#x27;s name have been proposed. While none have been conclusively proven, the view it is a cognate of the Arabic word &quot;‘anwat&quot;, &quot;force&quot; or &quot;violence,&quot; is considered plausible. Peggy L. Day notes that this proposal and the view that Anat and Ḫanat are analogous &quot;dovetail&quot; each other. Lambert assumed that Ḫanat&#x27;s name could refer to the Ḫanaeans (Ḫana), an Amorite group. Similarly, Durand derives it from &quot;ḫana&quot;, which he considers to be a label analogous to Bedouin. However, Ḫanat&#x27;s homonymous cult center apparently was not located in the lands considered the territory of the Ḫanaeans.

===Older theories===
A number of proposals regarding the origin of Anat&#x27;s name are no longer considered plausible in modern scholarship due to relying entirely on incorrect past evaluations of her character. One such example is Ariella Deem&#x27;s suggestion that it was derived from a purely hypothetical root &quot;*’nh&quot;, &quot;to make love.&quot; While in the past scholarship Anat was described as a &quot;patroness of wanton love,&quot; or as a &quot;fertility goddess,&quot; these views started to be challenged in scholarly publications in the 1990s and are no longer accepted today by most researchers. Sometimes similar labels can nonetheless be found even in more recent publications. 

Jo Ann Hackett notes that the connection between fertility and female deities has been historically exaggerated in the studies of religions of the Ancient Near East and considers such a characterization an example of perceiving women &quot;in terms of biological functions&quot; formed largely based on contemporary speculation, rather than on the available ritual texts and other primary sources. Julia M. Asher-Greve notes this category is one of the examples of terms which should be considered &quot;innovations of early modern work in the study of comparative religion&quot; rather than an accurate reflection of religion in antiquity. It has been pointed out by other authors that in Anat&#x27;s case, alleged references to a connection with fertility depend on dubious translations of hapax legomena and filling of lacunae. According to Theodore J. Lewis, one such attempt is Edward Lipiński&#x27;s treatment of the text KTU 1.96, meant to present her as a sexually active &quot;fertility&quot; goddess Michael C. Astour remarked critically that Lipiński&#x27;s translation explained &quot;practically every noun by &#x27;penis&#x27;&quot; to accomplish this. More recent research revealed that the text does not mention Anat at all.

==Ḫanat in the Mari texts==
The worship of Ḫanat is well attested in texts from Old Babylonian Mari. She was particularly venerated in the land of Suhum, where a city named Ḫanat (later Anat) was located. Its name could be written with the dingir sign preceding it (&quot;dḪa-na-atki, Bit dḪa-na-atki&quot;), which indicates it was directly named after the goddess. It has been identified with modern Anah in Iraq. One of the Mari texts mentions a temple of Ḫanat, presumed to be located in the city named after her. Later documents from Suhum indicate that a temple dedicated to the local goddess bore the ceremonial Sumerian name E-šuzianna, &quot;house, true hand of heaven.&quot; The tradition of assigning such names of houses of worship originated in southern Mesopotamia among the Sumerians and Akkadians, but it outlived the decline of Sumerian as a vernacular language, and spread to other areas within the Mesopotamian cultural sphere, including Assyria and the basin of the Diyala River in the north, the kingdom of Mari and the city of Harran in the west and to a smaller degree Elam in the east. Hammurabi of Babylon patronized the temples of the city of Ḫanat according to a later inscription of Ninurta-kudurri-usur, son of the local ruler Šamaš-reš-uṣur known from a stele found in Babylon.

In an offering list from the reign of Zimri-Lim, Ḫanat appears as the recipient of two sheep. The same document lists a number of other deities worshiped in Mari, such as Numushda, Ishara and Ninkarrak. Oil offerings to Ḫanat were apparently made by women from the royal palace. She is the last of the eight deities mentioned in a list presumed to document this custom. The formula &quot;Dagan and Ḫanat are well&quot; occurs in a letter from Buqāqum, a royal official active in Ḫanat. A legal text mentions that a certain Pulsī-Addu from Sapīratum (a settlement in Suhum) after losing a lawsuit meant to establish the ownership of a patch of land was obliged to swear an oath by a group of deities including Ḫanat, as well as Dagan and Itūr-Mēr, and by king Zimri-Lim to guarantee that he will not attempt to press the same claims again. Ḫanat&#x27;s presence in this text most likely simply reflects the fact that she was associated with the area which was the object of the conflict, while Dagan and Itūr-Mēr were respectively the head of the local pantheon and the god most commonly invoked in oaths.

Ḫanat is also mentioned in a letter from Šamaš-nasir, an official from Terqa, to Zimri-Lim, in which he relays an oracular declaration of Dagan to the king. Its subject is a verdict pronounced by the local god for Tishpak, the god of the kingdom of Eshnunna, after Yakrub-El relays to him that Ḫanat is threatened by the latter&#x27;s actions. The interactions between the gods reflect the political situation of the period, with Dagan representing Mari and Yakrub-El and Ḫanat respectively Terqa and Suhum, while Tishpak stands for Eshnunna, whose troops presumably were a threat for the latter of the two dependencies of Zimri-Lim&#x27;s kingdom.

Ḫanat appears in four types of theophoric names of women and ten types of names of men in the Mari texts. Some of the attested bearers of such names were deportees from the area roughly between Mount Abdulaziz and the Sinjar Mountains. A certain Ḫabdi-Ḫanat was at one point tasked with manufacturing a throne for Dagan in Mari itself. An individual bearing the name Ummi-Ḫanat is also attested outside this corpus, but it is presumed that the text, even though it mentions Eshnunna, pertains to Suhum.

==Anat in the Ugaritic texts==
Anat was one of the main goddesses in the pantheon of Ugarit, a city located in the north of modern Syria on the Mediterranean coast whose religion was closely related to that of Mari. According to the Ugaritic texts, Anat resides on a mountain known under the name ‘Inbubu, whose location remains unknown. An association between her and Mount Saphon, while also known, is infrequently attested. In the standard Ugaritic list of deities, she is placed between Athirat and Shapash. In the analogous text written in syllabic cuneiform, her name is rendered as &quot;da-na-tu4&quot;.

In Ugarit Anat was regarded as a warrior goddess, though she was not the only deity cast in this role. She is described using both a sword and a bow. Additionally, sources such as KTU 1.114 and KTU 1.22 attest that she was portrayed as a huntress as well. However, Theodore J. Lewis points out that due to relying on an incorrect collation of the tablet KTU 1.96, a number of older publications overestimated the degree to which Anat was portrayed as belligerent by ascribing cannibalistic tendencies to her. Lewis&#x27; conclusion is also accepted by other researchers today. In reality, as discovered during the digitalization of Ugaritic texts currently stored in Damascus, the text does not mention the goddess at all, as it is not plausible that &quot;‘nn&quot; is a mistake for &quot;‘nt&quot;. The older reading was based not on inspection of the object itself, but rather on an old photo which from a modern perspective is &quot;washed out and epigraphically useless.&quot; While the meaning of the rest of the text remains uncertain, Gregorio del Olmo Lete suggests that it might be an incantation against the casting of an evil eye (&quot;‘nn hlkt&quot;). This proposal is also accepted by Gebhard J. Selz.

It has been pointed out by multiple authors, including Peggy L. Day and Mark Smith, that the fact that Anat engages in pursuits which in Ugaritic culture were viewed as typically masculine, namely warfare and hunting, constitutes &quot;gender inversion&quot; of the roles human women were expected to take in society. Less formally, Dennis Pardee labeled her as a &quot;tomboy goddess,&quot; a characterization also employed by Izak Cornelius. In response to her threat, El describes Anat so: &quot;I know you, my daughter, that you are a manly sort, and that none are emotional as you.&quot;

It has been suggested that Anat was also regarded as a &quot;mistress of animals,&quot; in part based on pendants from Ugarit showing a goddess depicted in the pose associated with this archetypal motif, but this view is not universally accepted. 

Textual sources describe Anat as winged and capable of flight, which is commonly employed to identify possible depictions of her among the works of art from Ugarit. One possible example is a cylinder seal showing a winged goddess in a helmet decorated with horns and a knob, standing on a bull and holding a lion. However, it cannot be established with certainty that every winged goddess depicted on a seal found in modern Syria is necessarily Anat. It is possible that due to the influence of iconography of Mesopotamian Ishtar, other local goddesses could be depicted with wings too. Some researchers, among them Silvia Schroer, employ terms such as &quot;Anat-Astarte type&quot; when describing figures depicted in art to mitigate this problem.

===Epithets===
It has been postulated that the character of Ugaritic deities is well reflected in the epithets applied to them. In Anat&#x27;s case the most frequently occurring one is &quot;btlt&quot;, which is also overall the second best attested divine epithet in the entire Ugaritic corpus, after &quot;‘ali’yn b’l&quot; (&quot;aliyn Baal&quot;; &quot;Baal the mighty&quot;). As of 2008, it has been identified in a total of forty nine passages. Its exact translation was a subject of scholarly controversy in the past, though today it is most commonly rendered as &quot;maiden&quot; in English. Other proposals include &quot;virgin,&quot; &quot;girl&quot; and &quot;adolescent.&quot; However, it is now agreed that the term, even if translated as &quot;virgin,&quot; does not refer to virginity in the modern sense, but simply designates her as young and nubile. The proposal that &quot;btlt&quot; had a more precise meaning, &quot;young woman who did not yet bring forth male offspring,&quot; is considered baseless. An Akkadian cognate, &quot;batultu&quot;, occurs chiefly in legal contexts, and it has been pointed out that while it does refer to a woman&#x27;s age, it appears to be used &quot;without prejudice to her sexual or marital status.&quot; Aicha Rahmouni points out that while the Akkadian evidence does imply a woman referred to as a &quot;batultu&quot; would likely be expected to be chaste according to social norms of the period, there is no indication that Ugaritic deities were bound by identical norms. She proposes that the use of &quot;ardatum&quot;, similarly conventionally translated as &quot;maiden&quot; (in order to refer to various goddesses in Mesopotamia), offers a close semantic parallel. 

A further well attested epithet of Anat is &quot;ybmt l’imm&quot;, known from ten passages, but there is no consensus regarding its translation. The element &quot;l’imm&quot; is usually interpreted as a common noun meaning &quot;peoples&quot; or &quot;nations,&quot; though Dennis Pardee treats it as the name of a deity, analogous to Lim which is known from theophoric names from Mari. However, according to Alfonso Archi the element &quot;lim&quot;, while theophoric, should be treated simply as a religious understanding of the concept of the clan or similar traditional social structure. Its persistence in known sources might only reflect a pastoralist lifestyle (or memory of it) which relied on the social bonds denoted this way. References to Lim are uncommon in Ugaritic texts, and the presumed deity shows no apparent connection to Anat. 

A single passage in the text KTU 1.108 refers to Anat as &quot;gṯr&quot;, possibly &quot;the powerful.&quot; According to Rahmouni &quot;gṯr&quot; is most likely a scribal mistake for the feminine form &quot;gṯrt&quot;, while Dennis Pardee proposes that in this case it is an otherwise unattested noun, &quot;power,&quot; instead of the adjective well known from other texts. An entire sequence of otherwise unknown epithets is listed in the following verses of the same tablet: &quot;the mistress of kingship&quot; (&quot;b’lt mlk&quot;), &quot;the mistress of dominion&quot; (&quot;b’lt drkt&quot;), &quot;the mistress of the high heavens&quot; (&quot;b’lt šmm rmm&quot;) and &quot;the mistress of the &quot;kpṯ&quot;&quot; (&quot;b’lt kpṯ&quot;), whose enumeration is a poetic parallelism and is meant to highlight the position and authority of the goddess in the local pantheon. The &quot;mlk-drkt&quot; word pair is also known from other poetic contexts. It has also been suggested that the parallelism of the terms &quot;drkt&quot; and &quot;šmm rmm&quot; might be reflected in the names Derketo and Semiramis known from late antique sources. Gebhard J. Selz remarks that despite one of these epithet associating her with the heavens, Anat was never regarded as an astral deity. Rahmouni suggests the word &quot;kpṯ&quot; is most likely a cognate of Akkadian &quot;kupšu&quot;, a type of headdress which is also mentioned in divine epithets. Gregorio del Olmo Lete instead argues that its probable meaning is &quot;firmament&quot;, based on the parallel with &quot;šmm rmm&quot;, and that its Akkadian cognate would be &quot;kabāsu&quot;, &quot;to trample.&quot; Rahmouni argues the latter proposal is improbable because parallel epithets do not need to be semantically analogous, and additionally because Ugaritic &quot;ṯ&quot; typically corresponds to Akkadian &quot;š&quot;, not &quot;s&quot;, making both the translation and the proposed cognate difficult to accept. This view is also supported by Dennis Pardee, who additionally remarks that Anat&#x27;s association with the &quot;kpṯ&quot;, which he vocalizes as &quot;kupṯu&quot;, might mirror her link to the atef crown in Egyptian sources.

===Worship===
In an offering list described as &quot;Sacrifice to the gods of Mount Saphon,&quot; which possibly documents rites which took place over the course of the two months following the winter solstice, &quot;‘Iba’latu&quot; and &quot;Ḫiyyāru&quot; (roughly corresponding to the period between the 21st of December and the 20th of February according to Dennis Pardee), Anat is the recipient of rams, similar to many other deities listed, such as Shapshu, Arsay, Išḫara and Kinnaru. Another ritual text mentions the sacrifice of multiple bulls and rams to Anat. Additionally, a burnt offering of a bull and a ram to &quot;Anat of Ṣaphon&quot; is singled out near the end of the tablet. Anat of Saphon receives the same offering according to another source, listing the sacrifices made to her, as well as Ilib, El, Baal and Pidray, in the temple of Baal. In the same source she is also the recipient of a bull and a ram as a peace offering, in this passage appearing alongside Ilib, two Baals (of Ugarit and of Aleppo), Yarikh, Pidray and Dadmiš. In an entry ritual (an Amorite practice well known from Mari) of Ashtart, which took place over the course of multiple days, Anat received the snout and neck of an unidentified animal following the offerings of gold and silver to Shapash, Yarikh and Gaṯaru on the second day. However, there is no indication that the label &quot;Gaṯarūma&quot; (which appears to describe the other three deities) also applied to her.

Seventeen individuals bearing theophoric names invoking Anat have been identified in known Ugaritic texts, one among them being a king of nearby Siyannu. This makes her the second most popular goddess in that regard after Shapash, present in the names of sixty-six individuals. The element &quot;ʾilat&quot; (&quot;goddess;&quot; attested as an epithet of both Athirat and Anat) occurs more often, with a total of twenty-two attestations, but it is not certain if it refers to a specific deity. At the same time, Wilfred H. van Soldt remarked that Anat appears in theophoric names much less frequently than her importance in myths would indicate. 

====Hurrian ritual texts====
Anat is also present in Hurrian offering lists from Ugarit, according to Daniel Schwemer, possibly because she had no close equivalent among the Hurrian deities, unlike other well-attested members of the local pantheon. In one of them, she receives a ram after Aštabi (a warrior god) and Šimige (the sun god). In another similar list she is instead preceded by Nupatik. She also appears in a Hurrian ritual dealing with the anointing of deities, which otherwise only mentions members of the Hurrian pantheon.

Texts from Ugarit attesting to the worship of Ugaritic deities such as Anat, alongside Hurrian ones, have been argued to indicate that the two traditions functionally merged and that the religious life of the city was &quot;transcultural.&quot;

===Attested and proposed associations with other deities===
It is agreed that a close connection existed between Anat and Baal, but its nature continues to be disputed. Past scholarship is commonly criticized for speculation about her presumed status as his wife. No evidence exists for a spousal relationship between Anat and any other deity in the Ugaritic texts, while possible indications of sexual relations with other deities, or lack of them, are not interpreted uniformly. Daniel Schwemer accepts the possibility that individual texts might allude to sexual encounters between Baal and Anat, but concludes that the weather god &quot;did not have a wife in any real sense.&quot; Mark Smith argues that while there is no direct evidence for these two deities being viewed as a couple in the Ugaritic texts, the matter should be left open due to the scarcity of sources and possible evidence from other Northwest Semitic-speaking areas (postdating the period covered by the Ugaritic corpus) and Egypt, though a skeptical approach should be retained. Regardless of Anat&#x27;s relation to Baal, there is no evidence that she was ever regarded as the mother of his daughters attested in Ugartic tradition (Pidray, Tallay and Arsay). Ugaritic texts also refer to Anat to as Baal&#x27;s sister, though Aicha Rahmouni notes that it has been called into question if they were envisioned as biologically related. She points out that there is evidence, including an epithet directly referring to that relation, that Baal was regarded as the son of Dagan, who never occurs in association with Anat. She is consistently called a daughter of El instead, with Athirat being presumed to be her mother. If the disputed role of Baal and Anat as lovers is accepted, the words &quot;sister&quot; and &quot;brother&quot; might be used in a figurative sense to refer to them in that capacity. It is also possible that all members of the Ugaritic pantheon were referred to as siblings in a less direct sense, as members of a single social group.

Ashtart frequently appears in Ugaritic texts alongside Anat, and the pairing of these two goddesses has been described as &quot;fairly standard.&quot; An incantation against snakebite refers to them together as Anat-wa-Ashtart and states that both of them resided on the mountain Inbubu (&quot;inbb&quot;), otherwise associated only with Anat, while Ashtart was instead believed to dwell in Mari. Another similar text similarly invokes them together, after the pairs Baal and Dagan and Yarikh and Resheph. The importance of Ashtart is considered secondary compared to Anat in these sources and in the broader corpus of Ugaritic texts. However, Dennis Pardee stresses that while closely associated, the goddesses were not fused together.

The trilingual Sumero-Hurro-Ugaritic version of the Weidner god list from Ugarit treats Anat, whose name is repeated in both of the latter columns, as analogous to the Mesopotamian god Saĝkud, who belonged to the circle of either Ninurta or Anu. The name of this deity might be derived from an ordinary Sumerian noun, which possibly referred to a type of official, specifically a tax collector. Modern researchers often compare Anat to deities such as the Mesopotamian Inanna and Annunitum and the Hurrian Šauška. However, Jo Ann Hackett critically evaluated presenting the character of Anat and Inanna as identical.

It has been suggested that Ba’alat Bahatīma, &quot;lady of the houses&quot; (or &quot;of the temple,&quot; &quot;of the palace&quot;), might be an epithet of Anat. However, it has also been proposed that she was a distinct deity. The meaning of the name was possibly analogous to Mesopotamian Belet Ekallim. Ba’alat Bahatīma might have also been a title of a different Ugaritic goddess, possibly Pidray or Athirat. 

A further deity sometimes argued to be identical with Anat is Rahmay, known from KTU 1.23, a myth about Shahar and Shalim. However, evidence in favor of this theory is absent from any known Ugaritic texts. 

A minor deity named &quot;ṯmq&quot;, who might correspond to Mesopotamian Sumuqan, is described as &quot;warrior of Anat&quot; (&quot;mhr ‘nt&quot;) in two passages.

===Mythology===
Anat appears in multiple Ugaritic myths, where she is typically portrayed as the main ally of Baal. Theodore J. Lewis based on these texts has characterized her as &quot;without doubt the most vivid of the Ugaritic goddesses.&quot; 

====&quot;Baal Cycle&quot;====

Anat is portrayed in her usual role in the &quot;Baal Cycle&quot;, a well known Ugaritic narrative poem preserved on the tablets KTU 1.1–6. Sometimes, labels such as &quot;Baal-Anat cycle&quot; are used to refer to this work. 

Anat is first mentioned when El summons her to perform a ritual whose precise character is uncertain, but which according to John Gibson might have been meant to prevent her from actively supporting Baal. Later, when Yam, Baal&#x27;s rival for the position of king of the gods, sends his messengers to the divine assembly, Anat and Ashtart prevent the weather god from harming them. She seizes his right hand (KTU 1.2 I 40), while the other goddess - seizes his left hand. This passage is one of the multiple identified examples of poetic parallelism, employing the names of Anat and Ashart side by side.

Subsequently Anat appears in the section of the story focused on Baal striving to be granted a permission to have a palace built for himself. She apparently confronts a human army in a passage which remains poorly understood. Afterwards, the messengers of Baal, Gapnu (also spelled Gupan) and Ugar, approach her, which makes her worried if a new enemy is challenging Baal&#x27;s authority, prompting her to recall battles she took part in previously (KTU 1.3 III 36 - 47). Among the enemies she lists are Yam, listed twice (once under his main name and once as Nahar), Tunnanu (a sea serpent), further serpentine sea monsters (&quot;bṯn ‘qltn&quot;, &quot;the twisting serpent&quot; and &quot;šlyṭ d šb ‘t r’ašm&quot;, &quot;the dominant one who has seven heads&quot;), Arsh (&quot;‘arš&quot;; possibly also a sea monster), Atik (&quot;‘tk&quot;, the &quot;calf of El&quot; or alternatively the &quot;divine calf,&quot; Ḏabību (&quot;ḏbb&quot;; described as a daughter of El and presumed to be demonic in character), and Ishatu (&quot;&#x27;išt&quot;, flame, a female demon described as dog-like, possibly representing a concept analogous to dogs of individual deities known from Mesopotamian god lists such as &quot;An = Anum&quot;). Wayne T. Pitard points out that the inclusion of Yam among Anat&#x27;s defeated adversaries is difficult to explain, as a well known section of the narrative focuses on Baal, rather than her, defeating the sea god. According to Pitard, the reference might indicate the existence of a separate tradition which is otherwise not preserved in known texts.

After learning that the source of Baal&#x27;s anguish is not a new enemy but the lack of his own dwelling, Anat disrespectfully attempts to pressure El to grant Baal the permission to have a palace built for himself (KTU 1.3 V 27–32). She fails in this effort. Subsequently she assists the latter god in convincing Athirat to act as a mediator on his behalf. On the way to the sea shore where Athirat can be found, they apparently discuss an event during which Baal was dishonored in some way, possibly by Yam. The details are unclear and parts of the text are missing. When Athirat notices that they are approaching, she reacts with fear or anger (KTU 1.4 II.12–21); the scene has been summarized as &quot;a stereotyped response to bad news.&quot; However, her mood improves when she realizes that Anat and Baal bear gifts for her, and do not intend to smite her or any other deities. Anat asks her on Baal&#x27;s behalf to implore El to grant the permission she was herself unsuccessful at obtaining earlier (KTU 1.4 III 33-36). She then seemingly joins Athirat and her servant Qodesh-wa-Amrur in their journey to El&#x27;s dwelling. This interpretation has been questioned in the past, but the fact that Anat knows about the decision before Baal and later relays it to him is regarded as evidence in its favor. It is still possible that Anat is not present when the verdict itself is pronounced by El. 

After Baal&#x27;s death at the hands of Mot, Anat mourns him. She also shows concern about the fate of the people (KTU 1.6 I 6). Shapash, the sun goddess, is the first to notice her despair when she discovers the body of Baal, and helps her bring the deceased weather god to Mount Saphon for his burial. Afterwards, Anat announces Baal&#x27;s death to El, who decides that it will be necessary to appoint a substitute king. She also remarks that the situation will make Athirat rejoice (KTU 1.6 I 39-43), either due to the presumed antagonism between her and Baal or because she will be able to display her authority by appointing a different god to fill his place. The surviving sections pose a problem for interpreters, as apparently even though Anat has previously buried Baal, she is actively looking for him afterwards. It has been suggested that she only buried a substitute, rather than the real Baal. When the story resumes after the coronation of a temporary king, Attar, followed by a large lacuna (estimated to be around 30 lines), Anat threatens Mot. She kills him, and subsequently threshes his remain with a blade, winnows them with a sieve, burns them in a fire, grinds them with a millstone, and finally scatters them for birds to eat. It has been argued that this scene reflected an annual agricultural ritual. According to John Gibson this is unlikely, as Anat&#x27;s actions are simply meant to illustrate that the destruction of Mot was complete and thorough.

In a later section of the myth, when El learns in a dream that Baal is alive, he tells Anat to call Shapash to look for him. The sun goddess reassures Anat that she will try to find him, and receives a blessing in return. The rest of the column is missing. In the final surviving fragment of the text, which establishes that Baal gained El&#x27;s favor and his position was no longer threatened, Anat is mentioned by Mot (resurrected after their earlier confrontation)), who complains to the weather god about his treatment at her hands.

====&quot;Epic of Aqhat&quot;====

Another long Ugaritic narrative work, the &quot;Epic of Aqhat&quot; (KTU 1.17-19), also features Anat, though for the most part it focuses on humans rather than gods. Many details of the plot are uncertain due to the state of preservation of the tablets. The eponymous character is the son of a legendary king, Danel. At an early point in the narrative, Danel&#x27;s son receives a bow from the craftsman god Kothar-wa-Khasis. Anat apparently desires to obtain it and asks the human to give it to her, but she is rebuked. It is not clear if Aqhat&#x27;s reaction to her demand (&quot;ht tṣdn tỉnṯt&quot;; KTU 1.17 VI 40) should be interpreted as a question (&quot;now do womenfolk hunt?&quot;) or an ironic remark (&quot;now womenfolk hunt!&quot;). Anat demands permission to punish him for what she perceives as impiety from El, which the senior god grants her. She invites Aqhat to a hunt, but in secret she orders a certain Yatipan (described as a &quot;Sutean warrior&quot;) to kill him. However, as a result of his assault the bow is broken, which enrages Anat further. Aqhat&#x27;s body is subsequently devoured by birds of prey, and unnamed messengers inform Danel that Anat is complicit in his disappearance. The rest of the narrative apparently deals with Aqhat&#x27;s burial and the revenge of his sister Pughat against Yatipan, who at one point mistakes her for Anat and starts boasting about his recent endeavors. Surviving fragments indicate that Anat herself does not face repercussions.

====Other myths====
Due to the presence of the word &quot;btlt&quot;, which is a very common epithet of Anat, it has been proposed that a verse from &quot;Epic of Keret&quot; (KTU 1.15 II 27) refers to her as a wetnurse of Yaṣṣib, the eponymous king&#x27;s son, but the name of the goddess is only a restoration of a lacuna. In the past, it was proposed that Shapash or one of the Kotharat might be meant instead. Steve A. Wiggins calls the evidence mustered in favor of the former view &quot;compelling,&quot; and notes that the only problem is the lack of other texts where the sun goddess is described as a &quot;btlt&quot;. The same composition is also one of the texts attesting that Anat was regarded as beautiful. Comparisons to her appearance could be employed to praise the beauty of literary characters, in this case Huray, a mortal princess. The term usually employed to highlight this quality of Anat is &quot;n’mt&quot;, a superlative form of &quot;n’m&quot;, which can mean &quot;good&quot; or &quot;beautiful&quot; depending on context. This term was also applied to the moon god Yarikh (&quot;n’mn ‘lm&quot;, &quot;most handsome of the gods;&quot; &quot;n’mn&quot; is the masculine form of the same word).

Anat appears alongside Ashtart in KTU 1.114. During a banquet organized by El, Yarikh, who in this composition behaves like a dog, possibly due to engaging in alcohol consumption, receives pieces of meat from her and Ashtart. The goddesses are subsequently rebuked by a nameless servant of El, who complains that they offer choice cuts of meat to a dog. Anat and Ashtart are also referenced again in one of the final lines of the tablet. According to Mark Smith&#x27;s interpretation. the reference presumably indicates that they are seeking the ingredients needed to cure El&#x27;s hangover caused by his drunkenness. The drunkenness is described in the same myth.

==Egyptian reception==

It is commonly assumed that Anat was introduced to Egypt by the Hyksos, who settled there during the Second Intermediate Period. They ruled the Nile Delta for approximately one century, with Avaris serving as their capital. Richard H. Wilkinson cites the name of the ruler Anat-her as evidence for the Hyksos worshiping Anat. However, according to Christiane Zivie-Coche, the attestations of this goddess tied to the Hyksos are limited to a single theophoric name. She suggests that available evidence instead indicates that foreign deities from the north, such as Anat, only came to be commonly worshiped in Egypt during the subsequent reign of the Eighteenth Dynasty. She proposes that recovering the former Hyksos territory increased the frequency of interactions with various cultures of the Mediterranean coast and the broader Ancient Near East, among them Ugarit. This in turn led to more foreign influences finding their way into Egyptian religion, culture and language. As of 2011, there was no material evidence for the presence of Anat in religious contexts before the reign of Ramesses II. Other deities sharing her origin, such as Resheph and Haurun, had already appeared in records dating further back, to the times of Amenhotep II. 
In the past, it was often argued that the worshipers of foreign deities were chiefly prisoners of war brought to Egypt, but textual sources instead indicate that the pharaohs, the clergy of Ptah and ordinary citizens could all be involved in their veneration. Two temples dedicated to Anat have been identified in Egypt, one in Tanis (part of the temple complex of Mut) and another as the Temple of Hibis in the Kharga Oasis. The Egyptians also built a temple dedicated to her in Beisan during the reign of Ramesses III. Izak Cornelius additionally lists a festival of Anat celebrated in Gaza alongside the attestations connected to the Egyptian reception of this goddess It is known from an Egyptian ostracon dated to the thirteenth century BCE, a copy of a letter from a scribe named Ipuy to a certain Bak-en-amun, a garrison host commander. It describes the state of affairs in the area under his supervision, but details of the festival of Anat are not preserved. While a further Egyptian artifact presumed to come from Gaza is connected to the worship of Anat, it might not be authentic. It is a situla mentioning Anat in an inscription. Egyptian theophoric names invoking her are also known, one example being Anat-em-heb, &quot;Anat in her festival&quot;, constructed in an analogous way to similar names invoking native deities such as Amun or Horus.

Anat is characterized as warlike in Egyptian sources, similar to Ugarit. She was also called &quot;the mistress of heaven.&quot; It has been argued that this title might be related to her epithet known from the Ugaritic text KTU 1.108, &quot;b’lt šmm rmm&quot;, &#x27;mistress of the high heavens.&#x27; In visual arts, she was portrayed wearing the atef, a type of crown associated with Upper Egypt, and wielding either a spear and a shield, a fenestrated battle axe, or possibly the was-scepter. However, this utensil is better attested in association with Ashtart. It has been pointed out that ancient Egyptians typically depicted deities introduced from other areas according to local norms, and their attributes more directly reflected their character rather than their origin. 

The pharaoh Ramesses II was particularly devoted to Anat, according to Wilkinson, because of her warlike character. He referred to himself as the &quot;beloved&quot; of this goddess and called her his mother. His inscriptions generally assign warlike traits to her rather than motherly ones. A statue from his reign depicts Anat with her hand placed on his shoulder. It comes from a temple located in Tanis. Both the goddesses and the pharaoh are identified in an accompanying inscription. He also named one of his daughters (Bint-Anat, &quot;daughter of Anat&quot;), his war hound (&quot;Anat is strength&quot;) and his sword after the goddess. One of his successors, Ramesses III, referred to Anat as the goddess responsible for protecting him in battle.

Anat retained her role in the Egyptian pantheon through the first millennium BCE, up to the period of Roman rule. She is also among the deities depicted in the Dendera Temple complex from the Roman period. She also appears on a stele in Greco-Roman style alongside Khonsu and Mut.

===Anat, Ashtart and Qetesh===
The association between Anat and Ashtart is well attested in Egypt, and it is presumed that it was a direct adaptation of northern ideas about these two goddesses. Both of them could be regarded as daughters of Ra or Ptah. However, they are not always explicitly described as sisters. The myth &quot;Contest of Horus and Set for the Rule&quot;, dated to the period of the New Kingdom, is assumed to refer to both Anat and Astarte as prospective brides of Set. This interpretation has been questioned in Egyptology since the 1970s. Objections to the translation were also raised in Ugaritic studies: Neal H. Walls suggested in 1992 that interpreting this text might involve a misunderstanding. According to Mark Smith, as of 2014, no evidence has been provided to settle the academic dispute in favor of this view.

Anat and Ashtart appear alongside a third goddess, Qetesh, in the inscription on the so-called &quot;Winchester College stele&quot;, which depicts only one figure, despite three names being listed. This object has been used to argue that Qetesh, like the other two deities, had to be a major goddess in a similar area of ancient Syria. In particular, attempts were made to identify her with Athirat based on the incorrect view that she, Anat, and Ashtart were the three major goddesses of Ugarit. This theory disregards the position of Shapash in the city&#x27;s pantheon. Additionally, while Anat and Ashtart do appear together in Ugarit, there is no parallel group that would also include Athirat. A different proposal is to treat the three goddesses equally. However, Peggy L. Day points out that before the Hellenistic period, there is no other evidence for the merging of Anat with other goddesses in the Egyptian tradition. The evidence is limited to this single work of art, which she considers to be unusual. Christiane Zivie-Coche rejects the view that Qetesh was a hypostasis of Anat (or Ashtart), or even a goddess of Syrian origin at all. She instead agrees with the proposal that Qetesh was a goddess who developed in Egypt, even though her name is derived from a root known from Semitic languages, &quot;qdš&quot;. Izak Cornelius characterizes the importance assigned to the stela in past scholarship as &quot;exaggerated&quot;. Additionally, as early as 1955, at the time of its original publication, it has been pointed out that the inscription would indicate that the author was not fully familiar with the hieroglyphic script. This led Cornelius to tentatively propose that the inscription might be a forgery. The provenance of the stela remains unknown, and it is now lost.

==Other Bronze Age attestations==
Anat was worshiped in Emar, a city located on the banks of the Euphrates in modern Syria, though her importance there was small, especially in comparison with her status in Ugarit. The earliest academic survey of the deities mentioned in the corpus recovered from this site was prepared by Gary Beckman and published in 2002. It did not include Anat at all, though in 1996 there was identified a possible reference to a toponym derived from her name. The proposal that a theophoric name invoking her, Anat-ummī, in present the text Emar 216:6 (and passim) is also accepted today. Mark Smith notes that the nature of the Emar corpus needs to be taken into account when evaluating the prominence of deities in the local system of beliefs, as relatively few genres of texts are represented among tablets from the site.

William W. Hallo and Hayim Tadmor identified a possible reference to Anat in theophoric names in a lawsuit from Tel Hazor with the element ḫa-nu-ta. The text has been dated to the period between the eighteenth and sixteenth centuries BCE. A single theophoric name, Anati, is also known from Byblos. Furthermore, a document from the reign of Ramesses II mentions a man from an unspecified location in modern Syria. He bore the name &quot;bn ‘nt&quot;, and served as a ship captain.

In April 2022, media reports referred to an uninscribed head of a statue discovered by a farmer in the Gaza Strip as a depiction of Anat. However, it has been noted in past scholarship that while she, Ashtart and Athirat are &quot;often taken to be possible candidates when a new representation was found it should (...) be kept in mind that there were also other goddesses.&quot; The identification of individual deities of the region in art is considered difficult without accompanying inscriptions, in part due to lack of documents providing information about the composition of the local pantheon of a given location, even for well known sites like Megiddo. The only representation of Anat from the Levant directly identified as such by an accompanying inscription follows Egyptian artistic conventions and dates back to the twelfth century BCE.

===The logogram dNIN.URTA as a representation of Anat===
In 1990, Nadav Na&#x27;aman suggested that in the Amarna letters, the logogram dNIN.URTA, which appears in the entire corpus only four times and has been a subject of scholarly debate, designates Anat. He points out that despite her well attested role in religions of the second millennium BCE, no logographic writing of her name has been otherwise identified, with the exception of pseudo-logographic dIGI-&quot;at&quot; from Ugarit, even though logographic writing of other major deity names is well attested in other western text corpora from the late Bronze Age. He argues that the shared character of Anat and Ninurta as warlike deities would make such an association easy to accept in antiquity. This conclusion is also supported by Gebhard J. Selz. Na&#x27;aman assumes that the difference of gender might have not been obvious to the western theologians due to the presence of the sign NIN in many feminine theonyms of Sumerian origin. An earlier proposal was that dNIN.URTA refers to Hauron in this context, but according to Na&#x27;aman this is implausible, as this god was associated with incantations and exorcisms, rather than war. Hauron&#x27;s position in known pantheons was typically low, and he is entirely absent from theophoric personal names from the discussed time period unlike dNIN.URTA. Based on Na&#x27;aman&#x27;s theory, it has subsequently been proposed that the temple of dNIN.URTA , where Abdi-Ashirta mustered his troops according to the Amarna letter number 74, line 36, should be understood as belonging to Anat. Na&#x27;aman himself also proposed that a king of Siyannu attested in a single Ugaritic text, Abdi-dNIN.URTA , was the same person as the better known Abdi-Anati, a contemporary of Niqmepa. 

Peggy L. Day, also relying on Na&#x27;aman&#x27;s proposal, argues that the deity designated as dNIN.URTA in texts from Emar might also be Anat. However, in a more recent summary of plausible proposals regarding the identity of this presently anonymous deity, Gary Beckman only lists Resheph, who he considers a likely (though nonetheless speculative) option himself due to his presence in many theophoric names and his warlike character. Joan Goodnick Westenholz proposed that a uniquely local deity, known as Il Imari (or Ḫamari), &quot;the Emariote god,&quot; is the one indicated. Both DINGIR (to be read as &quot;Il&quot;) &quot;i-ma-ri&quot; and &quot;dḪa-ma-ri&quot; are attested in Emariote sources. Michael P. Streck does accept the view that Anat was regarded as analogous to Ninurta in Amurru and further south, in Canaan. He considers the identity of the Emariote dNIN.URTA uncertain, citing Westenholz&#x27;s Il Imari proposal and the Mesopotamian Ninurta, but not Anat, as possibilities. Yoram Cohen considers Resheph, Il Imari and Attar, suggested by Daniel Arnaud, to be plausible identification proposals.

===The Elkunirša myth===

According to Daniel Schwemer, it is sometimes assumed that a goddess designated by the logogram dIŠTAR in the myth of Elkunirša (CTH 342) which is known from Hittite archives might be Anat (or perhaps Ashtart). This proposal is not universally accepted, and according to Steve A. Wiggins there is no indication that the characters present in it necessarily match these known from Ugaritic mythology. Mary R. Bachvarova recently pointed out that the goddess&#x27; name appears to actually be dIŠTAR-&quot;iš&quot;, which according to her would suggest that Hittite Anzili is meant. The origin of this text itself is also a matter of scholarly dispute. Daniel Schwemer considers it to be unknown. Bachvarova points out a reference to a person from the kingdom of Amurru, and presumes that the origin can be broadly attributed to a West Semitic literary milieu. Wiggins assumes that even if it originated in a Canaanite area, it likely went through a number of changes during its transmission. Itamar Singer argued that it was formed in a &quot;cultural koinē consisting of an intricate fusion of Semitic and Hurrian elements.&quot; The role of dIŠTAR in the tale is to inform a weather god that the eponymous deity (whose name might be derived from an epithet of the Ugaritic god El) and his wife, Ašertu (Athirat), are plotting against him. Both Ugaritic Baal and Hittite Tarḫunna have been proposed as the identity of the weather god.

==First millennium BCE attestations==
===Mesopotamian sources===

The city of Anat is attested as the main cult center of Anat in Mesopotamia based on sources from the eighth century BCE. The E-šuzianna temple, according to later inscriptions already patronized by the Old Babylonian king Hammurabi, remained in use. While the surrounding area, still known as Suhum, came under the control of Assyria, local culture and religion in the first millennium BCE were instead influenced by Babylonia. Next to Anat, the main deity of her city was Adad, but it is not known how the relation between them was conceptualized. Daniel Schwemer points out that the role of Adad&#x27;s wife was most likely played by the weather goddess Shala, rather than Anat. The relationship between Adad and Shala is attested elsewhere in Mesopotamia.

A stela found in Babylon inscribed with the name of Šamaš-reš-uṣur, who served as the governor of Suhu around 760 BCE, is presumed to depict Anat alongside other deities following a proposal of Antoine Cavigneaux and Bahija Khalil Ismail from 1990. The fragment of the inscription referring to her is damaged, and the image itself is also damaged. The other two deities are identified as Ishtar and Adad. All three of them are depicted in feathered crowns and robes decorated with rondels, following the Babylonian artistic convention of the period. It has been proposed that a fourth deity was originally depicted on a section which has since broken off, but this remains speculative. The deities are accompanied by a smaller depiction of Šamaš-reš-uṣur himself, who unlike them is instead dressed in typically Assyrian manner. Also included are symbols of Marduk (spade), Nabu (stylus) and Sin (crescent). The similarity of the artwork on this stele to the &quot;kudurru&quot; (boundary stone) of Nabu-shuma-ishkun has been noted.

Ninurta-kudurri-usur, the son of Šamaš-reš-uṣur, at one point renovated the E-šuzianna temple. His inscription referring to this event describes Anat as &quot;the perfect lady, most exalted of the goddesses, most powerful of the goddesses, greatest of the Igīgu gods, august lady whose godhead is splendid, splendid lady whose valour is not equalled by (that of any of) the (other) goddesses.&quot; He also asserts that at an unspecified point prior to his reign, the Assyrians desecrated a statue of Anat, took away its ornaments, and then hid it somewhere, where it remained until he recovered it. Like his other inscriptions, this text in written in the Babylonian dialect of Akkadian, though it shows Assyrian and Aramaic influence as well. The name of Anat is written as &quot;an-at&quot;. Among the other gods mentioned are Shamash, Marduk, Adad, Apladad and Misharu.

===Phoenician sources===
Anat&#x27;s position in Phoenician religion is a topic of debate among researchers. Reconstruction of Phoenician religious beliefs is difficult due to the scarcity and the laconic nature of available sources. Cultural continuity with Ugaritic religion cannot be established. It has been argued that the small number of theophoric names invoking Anat and the lack of much other evidence pertaining to her cult might be an indication that Anat&#x27;s worship in the west had declined compared to her status in the second millennium BCE. Izak Cornelius goes as far as arguing that she outright disappeared from many of the local pantheons, but Peggy L. Day argues against this conclusion.

Four inscribed votive objects dedicated to Anat have been discovered in Idalion on Cyprus. Since two of them are a horse binder (dated to the seventh century BCE) and a spearhead (dated to the fifth or early fourth century BCE), it is assumed that Anat had retained her warlike nature (which is known from Ugaritic sources) in Phoenician religion as well. A bilingual Phoenician-Greek inscription, the Anat-Athena bilingual has also been found in Larnakas tis Lapithou. The Greek version refers to &quot;Athena Soteria Nike&quot; instead of Anat, presumably due to the shared marital nature and, according to Peggy L. Day, the characterization of both as &quot;non-sexually active, non-reproductive goddesses.&quot; Comparisons between Anat and Athena have also been made by modern researchers of Greek religion, such as Walter Burkert, who highlighted the similarities in iconography of martial deities excavated in Greece (especially statuettes referred to with the term Palladion) and Syria. The goddess referred to as Athena by Philo of Byblos has also been argued to be Anat. Philo states that Athena&#x27;s sister was Persephone, who might be simply the Greek goddess in this case, as she was worshiped in Samaria; a connection with Ugaritic Arsay cannot be proven. However, as noted by Richard J. Clifford, from the 1980s onwards commenters on Philo&#x27;s work point out that while at least some elements of his account are a reflection of authentic Phoenician beliefs, it should be understood primarily as Hellenizing and heavily influenced by Greek mythology, rather than Phoenician mythology, and therefore not entire reliable for the study of earlier periods. 

The identification of the deity &quot;dA-na-ti ba-a-ti&quot; DINGIR.MEŠ, possibly to be read as Anat-Bayt’el, in the treaty between Esarhaddon and king Baal of Tyre with Anat is considered implausible. Day notes that while such proposals are present in scholarship, the name might also be an unrelated compound noun. While it is conventionally assumed that Anat-Bayt’el was one of the main deities of Tyre, Karel van der Toorn has called into question if the name has Phoenician origin at all due to the lack of other attestations from this city and nearby areas. He proposes that was derived from Aramaic instead.

The assertion that Tanit, worshiped in Carthage, was the same deity as Anat can be found in older literature, for example in the publications of William F. Albright. According to Steve A. Wiggins, such assertions should be treated cautiously. It cannot necessarily be assumed that Tanit corresponds to any major goddess from the second millennium.

===Hebrew Bible===
The only certain references to Anat in the Hebrew Bible are the theophoric name Shamgar ben Anat (Judges 3:31), and the place names Beth-Anath (Joshua 19:38 and Judges 1:33) Two further possible examples are the toponym Anathoth (Jeremiah 1:1) and the homophonous name Anathoth (Nehemiah 10:20). Steve A. Wiggins based on available evidence concludes that Anat was only &quot;vestigially present&quot; in the Kingdom of Israel. Karel van der Toorn reaches a similar conclusion.

Most researchers agree that the single verse which mentions Shamgar ben Anat and his victory over six hundred Philistines was a late addition to the Book of Judges, and that it most likely represents an entirely fictitious account, possibly inspired by better known feats attributed to Samson or soldiers of David. Nili Shupak suggests that &quot;ben Anat&quot; should be interpreted as a cognomen designating its bearer as a warrior from a troop dedicated to Anat due to her well-known character as a war deity. Shupak points out that multiple examples of similar theophoric names of soldiers are known. The analogous name &quot;bn ‘nt&quot; is known from an inscribed arrowhead dated to the eleventh century BCE and from a seal with a Hebrew inscription of unknown provenance dated to the eight or seventh century BCE. An alternate proposal, originally formulated by William F. Albright, is that ben Anat simply indicates that Shamgar was born in Beth Anat. This option is considered unlikely by Shupak. 

The proposal that &quot;‘annôt&quot; in the Masoretic Text of Exodus 32:18 should be reinterpreted as a reference to Anat is considered implausible. It relies on the incorrect assumption that Anat was a fertility goddess associated with human sexuality, and as such can be associated with the described licentious behaviour pertaining to the worship of the golden calf. Furthermore, the idol constructed by the Israelites is described as a young bull (&quot;‘gl&quot;), while a representation of a female deity would be more likely referred to as a heifer (&quot;‘glh&quot;) instead. The proposal that the Queen of Heaven from the Book of Jeremiah (7:18, 44:17) might be Anat, while reliant on well attested Ugaritic and Egyptian epithets, is also considered implausible.

===Disputed proposals===
Two possible theonyms with Anat as an element have been identified in Aramaic texts from the fifth century BCE Elephantine, ‘ntyhw and ‘ntbyt’l. However, in both cases the element &quot;‘nt&quot; might instead be a common noun. It has been argued that they are genitival constructs, respectively &quot;Anat of Yahu&quot; and &quot;Anat of Bethel,&quot; the latter possibly corresponding to the deity Anat-Bayt’el known from the treaty between Esarhaddon and king Baal of Tyre. Bayt’el or Bethel might have been the eponymous god of the settlement Bethel, tentatively identified with modern Bet Laha, located west of Aleppo. The element Yahu is presumed to correspond to Yahweh, the national god of the Israelites. It has been argued that both &quot;‘ntyhw&quot; and &quot;‘ntbyt’l&quot; should be understood as consorts of the male gods mentioned in their names. However, it was already questioned in the 1990s if the names should be translated as &quot;Anat, consort of Yahu&quot; and &quot;Anat, consort of Bethel,&quot; and according to Susan Ackerman, the current majority view is that the name Anat-Yahu instead should be understood as a hypostasis of Yahu. The first element of the name is a common noun meaning &quot;providence&quot; or &quot;sign.&quot;

An Aramaic inscription from Egypt mentioning a priest of Anat is known, but its authenticity has been called into question by Ackerman. It is a part of the Michaelides collection, multiple objects from which are known for repeated documentational irregularities. The irregularities suggest that they might be inauthentic. 

It is sometimes argued that the goddess Atargatis, worshiped in modern Syria in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, represented a fusion of Anat and Ashtart. This proposal is based on William F. Albright&#x27;s assertion that Atta might be an Aramaic form of Anat&#x27;s name, and that therefore the name of Atargatis can be plausibly explained as a combination of Anat&#x27;s and Ashtart&#x27;s. This view has been criticized by Peggy L. Day, who, following an earlier study by Jo Ann Hackett, points out that the popularity of such theories in past scholarship is tied to the notion that goddesses were interchangeable and had no discernible individual traits. She suggests that the proposal requires &quot;critical reassessment.&quot;

===Comparative scholarship===
In the 1960s it has been argued that the Hindu goddess Kālī, who is first attested in the 7th century CE, shares some characteristics with some ancient Near Eastern goddesses, such wearing a necklace of heads and a belt of severed hands like Anat, and drinking blood like the Egyptian goddess Sekhmet and that therefore that her character might have been influenced by them. A myth describes how Kali became ecstatic with the joy of battle and slaughter while killing demons, and refused to stop until she was pacified by her consort, Shiva, who threw himself under her feet. Marvin H. Pope in 1977 asserted that this myth exhibits parallels to the Ugaritic myth in which Anat started attacking warriors, which describies the goddess as gloating and her heart filling with joy and her liver with laughter while attaching the heads of warriors to her back and girding hands to her waist until she is pacified by a message of peace sent by Baal.

===Use of the name in present-day Israel===

&quot;Anat&quot; (ענת) is commonly used as a female first name in present-day Israel (see list of people so named in Anat (disambiguation). This is one of the Biblical names introduced by the Zionist Movement and not attested among earlier Jewish communities.

<text>The Intelligence Bureau ( ; IB) is an intelligence and security agency in Pakistan, focused primarily on non-military intelligence. Established in 1947, the IB is Pakistan&#x27;s oldest intelligence agency. It is led by the Director General (DG IB), who is usually an officer from the Police Service of Pakistan.

The government of Pakistan elevated the Intelligence Bureau status from a semi-autonomous agency to a Division, upgrading it to the equivalent of a Federal Ministry, under oversight of a federal secretary. Appointments and supervision of its operations are authorized by the Prime Minister of Pakistan.

==History==
The Intelligence Bureau traces its origin to the Central Special Branch, established on 23 December 1887 by the British government in India to gather intelligence on political unrest. Its creation followed Secret Dispatch No. 11, dated 25 March 1887, in which R. A. Cross, the Secretary of State for India, sanctioned the proposal by Lord Dufferin, the Viceroy of India, to create a system for the &quot;collection of secret and political intelligence in India&quot;.

Dufferin proposed utilizing the police forces in British India and political officers in princely states for the &quot;collection of intelligence on political, social and religious movements&quot;. He recommended the establishment of &quot;special agencies&quot; at both central and provincial headquarters. The Provincial Special Branches, under local government control, were tasked with sharing intelligence with the Central Special Branch. Dufferin modelled the agency after the Third Section of Imperial Russia. To reduce expenses, the agency shared the manpower and facilities of the existing Thuggee and Dacoity Department. The General Superintendent of the Department was entrusted with the supervision of the Central Special Branch. The Provincial Special Branches were attached to the offices of either the Inspector General of Police or the chief secretary of the respective provinces.

In 1904, based on the recommendations of the Indian Police Commission (1902 – 1903) chaired by Andrew Fraser, the Central Criminal Intelligence Department—also known as the Department of Criminal Intelligence (DCI)—was established. This reorganization led to the abolition of the Thuggee and Dacoity Department and the merger of the Central Special Branch into the DCI. Additionally, Criminal Investigation Departments (CID) were created in the provinces. Initially, Provincial Special Branches were incorporated into the CIDs, but they were later separated as their functions evolved.

Section 40(2) of the Government of India Act 1919 stated that &quot;the Intelligence Bureau should keep the Government posted with matters relating to the security of the Indian Empire.&quot; Reflecting this directive, the DCI was renamed the Intelligence Bureau in 1920, a year before the Act formally came into force in 1921.

In the aftermath of the independence of Pakistan by the British Crown, the IB, like the armed forces was partitioned, with a Pakistan IB created in Karachi. Since, the IB is the oldest intelligence community; others being the Military Intelligence (MI) of Pakistan&#x27;s military. The IB was initially Pakistan&#x27;s only and main intelligence agency with the responsibility for strategic and foreign intelligences, as well as counter-espionage and domestic affairs.

Its poor performance with the MI and unsatisfactory detailing of the war with India in 1947 was however considered less than exemplary. Due to the fact, IB was concerned with internal security matters, and was not set up for foreign intelligence collection. These considerations ultimately led to the creation of the ISI in 1948 as it quickly took the charge of gathering strategic and foreign intelligence at all levels of command.

Appointment for IB&#x27;s Director-General are made by the Prime Minister but the appointment has to be confirmed by the President. The IB is a civilian intelligence agency, and its DG have been appointed from the civil bureaucracy and the police; as well as retired military officials have also served as DG IB.

===Operations===
Since the 1950s–1980s, the IB was running active operations to monitor politicians, political activists, suspected terrorists, and suspected foreign intelligence agents. Right after Dhaka Fall in 1971, the IB apprised the then Prime Minister of Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto of coup discussions between the Commander-in-Chief, Gul Hassan Khan and Air Chief Marshal Abdul Rahim Khan. Bhutto and his close aides, including Ghulam Mustafa Khar, in a counter-coup invited both Generals to the President House under false pretenses and obtained their resignations. The IB keeps tabs on political operatives from countries it considers hostile to Pakistan&#x27;s interests. In the 1990s, the IB gained international reputation when its agents had successfully infiltrated many of the terrorist organizations.

In 1996, the IB was granted control of government censorship programs, controlling information dissemination via mail, wire, or electronic medium. In the 1990s, the IB remained actively involved to curb sectarianism and the fundamentalism in the country. Many of its operations were directed towards infiltration, conducting espionage, counterespionage, and providing key information on terrorist organizations. After the disastrous 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States, the IB played its role as a stakeholder of the government. IB&#x27;s successful infiltration techniques has led to the capture and detainment of many of high-profile terrorists and sectarian militants. Moreover, it has been instrumental in efforts to break terrorist networks and organised crime rackets throughout the country especially Karachi through its sophisticated human and technical intelligence apparatus. The agency had also been blamed for its belligerent role in Operation Clean-up at Karachi in 1991–92 and 1994–96.

The IB is considered to be a main tool of the government to pacify opposition elements and is sometimes viewed as a government toppling machine. One case under discussion in the Supreme Court of Pakistan is for the alleged involvement of the agency in destabilizing the Punjab Government in 2008.

In 2019 after Indian airstrikes in Pakistan&#x27;s Balakot, IB managed to bust whole ring of local informers that mapped and provided crucial operations to Indian RAW which helped IAF in locating its targets.

In January 2021, the IB caught a former militant, Salimullah, filming a strategic military installation in Kashmir for RAW.

IB successfully foiled ISIS-K plan to assassinate President Arif Alvi during president&#x27;s Sibi visit in 2022.

RAW&#x27;s nefarious plan to infiltrate spies into prominent military installations of Pakistan was countered by IB in 2022. The IB unmasked 25 Indian agents and successfully thwarted India&#x27;s attempt to infiltrate Pakistan security apparatus.

In yet another highly secretive and successful operation, a retired-Rangers commando, Muhammad Ali who was working as a hitman for RAW by running an assassination cell within Pakistan that aimed to eliminate prominent Kashmiri militants was nabbed along with his accomplices in 2023. His entire cell was dismantled by IB. Later, it was revealed that Muhammad Ali was tasked by Indian agencies to eliminate Hafiz Saeed and other Kashmiri militant leaders residing inside Pakistan after RAW&#x27;s failed assassination bid to eliminate Hafiz in 2021.

==Constitutionality and powers==
The IB agents have no formal arrest powers, and its suspects are often apprehended and interrogated by the FIA agents at the request of the IB officials.

The IB also passes on intelligence gained through infiltration between other Pakistan&#x27;s intelligence community, police, and other Law enforcement units. The Bureau also grants the necessary security clearances to Pakistani diplomats and judges before they take the oath. Powers granted by the government, the IB also intercepts and opens regular mails and letters on a daily basis.

<doc id="765782" wikidata="Q2996100" url="?curid=765782" title="Circumcision controversies">
<text>Male circumcision has been a subject of controversy for a number of reasons including religious, ethical, sexual, and medical.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, in a rapidly changing medical and surgical world, circumcision rose in popularity as a means of prophylaxis in the Anglosphere. Its primary justification was to promote cleanliness, as well as reducing and preventing the incidence of disease. Many medical professionals and advocates of the procedure also believed that it would reduce pleasure and the urge to masturbate, which was considered a social ill of the era, although their belief is considered false in modern times.

Traditional proponents say that circumcision reduces the risks of a range of infections and diseases and confers sexual benefits. By contrast, the majority of modern opponents, particularly of routine neonatal circumcision, question its preventive efficacy and object to subjecting non-consenting newborn males to a procedure that is potentially harmful with little to no benefit, as well as violating their human rights and possibly negatively impacting their sex life.

In Classical and Hellenistic civilization, Ancient Greeks and Romans posed great value on the beauty of nature, physical integrity, aesthetics, harmonious bodies and nudity, including the foreskin (see also Ancient Greek art), and were opposed to circumcision, an opposition inherited by the canon and secular legal systems of the Christian West and East that lasted at least through to the Middle Ages, according to Frederick Hodges. 

Traditional branches of Judaism, Islam, Coptic Christianity, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, and the Eritrean Orthodox Church still advocate male circumcision as a religious obligation.

==Religious and cultural conflicts==
===Ancient Near East===
The Book of Genesis explains circumcision as a covenant with God given to Abraham, In Judaism it &quot;symbolizes the promise of lineage and fruitfulness of a great nation,&quot; the &quot;seal of ownership and the guarantee of relationship between peoples and their god.&quot; Some scholars look elsewhere for the origin of Jewish circumcision. One explanation, dating from Herodotus, is that the custom was acquired from the Egyptians, possibly during the period of enslavement. An additional hypothesis, based on linguistic/ethnographic work begun in the 19th century, suggests circumcision was a common tribal custom among Semitic-speaking peoples (Jews, Arabs, and Phoenicians).

The Jewish and Islamic traditions both see circumcision as a way to distinguish a group from its neighbours. The Bible records &quot;uncircumcised&quot; being used as a derogatory reference for opponents and Jewish victory in battle that culminated in mass post-mortem circumcision, to provide an account of the number of enemy casualties. Jews were also required to circumcise all household members, including slaves – a practice that would later put them into collision with Roman and Christian law (see below).

===Classical civilization===
In 167 BCE Judea was part of the Seleucid Empire. Its ruler, Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175–165 BCE), smarting from a defeat in a war against Ptolemaic Egypt, banned traditional Jewish religious practices, and attempted to forcibly let the Jews accept Hellenistic culture. Throughout the country Jews were ordered, with the threat of execution, to sacrifice pigs to Greek gods (the normal practice in the Ancient Greek religion), desecrate the Shabbat, eat unkosher animals (especially pork), and relinquish their Jewish scriptures. Antiochus&#x27; decree also outlawed Jewish circumcision, and parents who violated his order were hanged along with their infants. According to Tacitus, as quoted by Hodges, Antiochus &quot;endeavoured to abolish Jewish superstition and to introduce Greek civilization.&quot;

According to rabbinical accounts, he desecrated the Second Temple of Jerusalem by placing a statue of Olympian Zeus on the altar of the Temple; this incident is also reported by the biblical &quot;Book of Daniel&quot;, where the author refers to the statue of the Greek god inside the Temple as &quot;abomination of desolation&quot;. Antiochus&#x27; decrees and vituperation of Judaism motivated the Maccabean Revolt; the Maccabees reacted violently against the forced Hellenization of Judea, destroyed pagan altars in the villages, circumcised boys, and forced Hellenized Jews into outlawry. The revolt ended in the re-establishment of an independent Jewish kingdom under the Hasmoneans, until it turned into a client state of the Roman Republic under the reign of Herod the Great (374 BCE).

Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman culture found circumcision to be cruel and repulsive. In the Roman Empire, circumcision was regarded as a barbaric and disgusting custom. The consul Titus Flavius Clemens was condemned to death by the Roman Senate in 95 CE for, according to the Talmud, circumcising himself and converting to Judaism. The Emperor Hadrian (117138) forbade circumcision. Overall, the rite of circumcision was especially execrable in Classical civilization, also because it was the custom to spend an hour a day or so exercising nude in the &quot;gymnasium&quot; and in Roman baths, therefore Jewish men did not want to be seen in public deprived of their foreskins.

As for the anti-circumcision law passed by Hadrian, it is considered by many to be, together with his decision to build a Roman temple upon the ruins of the Second Temple and dedicate it to Jupiter, one of the main causes of the Bar Kokhba revolt (132135 CE), which was brutally crushed; according to Cassius Dio, 580,000 Jews were killed and 50 fortified towns and 985 villages razed. He claimed that &quot;Many Romans, moreover, perished in this war. Therefore, Hadrian, in writing to the Senate, did not employ the opening phrase commonly affected by the Emperors: &#x27;If you and your children are in health, it is well; I and the army are in health.&#x27;&quot; Because of the great loss of life in the war, even though Hadrian was victorious, he refused a triumph.

Hadrian&#x27;s policy after the rebellion reflected an attempt to root out Judaism: he enacted a ban on circumcision, all Jews were forbidden to enter Jerusalem upon pain of death, and the city was renamed &quot;Aelia Capitolina&quot;, while Judea was renamed &quot;Syria Palaestina&quot;. Around 140, his successor Antoninus Pius (138-161 CE) exempted Jews from the decree against circumcision, allowing them to circumcise their sons, although they were forbidden to do the same on their slaves and proselytes. Jewish nationalists&#x27; (Pharisees and Zealots) response to the decrees also took a more moderate form: circumcisions were secretly performed, even on dead Jews.

However, there were also many Jews, known as &quot;Hellenizers&quot;, who viewed Hellenization and social integration of the Jewish people in the Greco-Roman world favourably, and pursued a completely different approach: accepting the Emperor&#x27;s decree and even making efforts to restore their foreskins to better assimilate into Hellenistic society. The latter approach was common during the reign of Antiochus, and again under Roman rule. The foreskin was restored by one of two methods, that were later revived in the late 20th century; both were described in detail by the Greek physician Aulus Cornelius Celsus in his comprehensive encyclopedic work &quot;De Medicina&quot;, written during the reign of Tiberius (14-37 CE). The surgical method involved freeing the skin covering the penis by dissection, and then pulling it forward over the glans; he also described a simpler surgical technique used on men whose prepuce is naturally insufficient to cover their glans. The second approach, known as &quot;epispasm&quot;, was non-surgical: a restoration device which consisted of a special weight made of bronze, copper, or leather (sometimes called &quot;Pondus Judaeus&quot;, i.e. &quot;Jewish burden&quot;), was affixed to the penis, pulling its skin downward. Over time, a new foreskin was generated, or a short prepuce was lengthened, by means of tissue expansion. Martial also mentioned the instrument in &quot;Epigrammaton&quot; (Book 7:35).

The Apostle Paul referred to these practices in his letters, saying: &quot;Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised.&quot; But he also explicitly denounced the forcing of circumcision upon non-Jews, rejecting and condemning those Judaizers who stipulated the ritual to Gentile Christians, labelling such advocates as &quot;false brothers&quot; (see below). In the mid-2nd century Rabbinical Jewish leaders, due to increasing cases of foreskin restorations in Roman Empire, introduced a radical method of circumcision, the &quot;periah&quot;, that left the glans totally uncovered and sew the remaining skin. The new method became immediately the only valid circumcision procedure, to ensure that a born Jew will remain circumcised for all his life and to make mostly impossible restoring the foreskin. Operations became permanent and irreversible like today.

Under the first Christian emperor, Constantine, the two rescripts of Antoninus on circumcision were re-enacted and again in the 6th century under Justinian. These restrictions on circumcision made their way into both secular and Canon law and &quot;at least through the Middle Ages, preserved and enhanced laws banning Hebrews from circumcising non-Hebrews and banning Christians or slaves of any religious affiliation from undergoing circumcision for any reason.&quot;

===Christianity===

Circumcision has also played a major role in Christian history and theology. While the circumcision of Jesus is celebrated as a feast day in the liturgical calendar of many Christian denominations.
There was debate in the early Church on whether Gentiles needed to be circumcised in order to join the communities; some Jewish Christians insisted that it was necessary. As such, the Council of Jerusalem (50 CE) was held, which decreed that male circumcision was not a requirement for Gentiles, which became known as the &quot;Apostolic Decree&quot;. This was one of the first acts differentiating Early Christianity from Judaism. Covenant theology largely views the Christian sacrament of baptism as fulfilling the Israelite practice of circumcision, both being signs and seals of the covenant of grace.

Today, many Christian denominations are neutral about ritual male circumcision, not requiring it for religious observance, but neither forbidding it for cultural or other reasons. While in some African and Eastern Christian denominations (such as the Coptic, Ethiopian, and Eritrean Orthodox Churches) male circumcision is an established practice, and require that their male members undergo circumcision shortly after birth as part of a rite of passage.

Male circumcision is widely practiced among Christian communities in the Anglosphere countries, Africa, Oceania, the Middle East, South Korea and the Philippines. The United States and the Philippines are the largest Christian countries in the world to extensively practice male circumcision. While countries with majorities of Christian adherents in Europe and South America have low circumcision rates.

===Islam===
In the early 7th century, Muhammad welded together many Semitic tribes of the Arabian peninsula into the kernel of a rapidly expanding Muslim movement. Male and female circumcision were already well established among these tribes, and probably had been for more than 1,000 years, most likely as a fertility rite. Herodotus had noticed the practice among various Semite nations in the 5th century BCE, and Josephus had specifically mentioned circumcision as a tradition among Arabs in the 1st century CE. There are some narrations attributed to Muhammad in which he approves of female circumcision; many scholars believe that these narrations are weak and lack authenticity.

The practice of circumcision is sometimes characterized as a part of &quot;fitrah&quot; as mentioned in the &quot;hadith&quot; (Prophetic narrations).

===Judaism===
Around 140 CE, the &quot;Tannaim&quot; made circumcision requirements stricter, in order to make the procedure irreversible.

During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries many Jewish reformers, doctors, and physicians in Central and Eastern Europe proposed to replace circumcision with a symbolic ceremony, while others sought to ban or abolish circumcision entirely, as they perceived it as a dangerous, barbaric and pagan ritual of genital mutilation that could transmit infectious diseases to newborns. The first formal objection to circumcision within Judaism occurred in 1843 in Frankfurt. The Society for the Friends of Reform, a group that criticized traditional Jewish practices, said that &quot;brit milah&quot; was not a &quot;mitzvah&quot; but an outworn legacy from Israel&#x27;s earlier phases, an obsolete throwback to primitive religion. With the expanding role of medicine came further opposition; certain aspects of Jewish circumcision such as &quot;periah&quot; and &quot;metzitzah&quot; (drawing the blood from the circumcision wound through sucking or a cloth) were deemed unhygienic and dangerous for the newborns. Later evidence that syphilis and tuberculosis – two of the most feared infectious diseases in the 19th century – were spread by mohels, caused various rabbis to advocate &quot;metzitzah&quot; to be done using a sponge or a tube. Among the secular, non-observant Jews who chose to not circumcise their sons there was also Theodor Herzl.

Ephron reports that non-Jews and also some Jewish reformers in early 19th-century Germany had criticized ritual circumcision as &quot;barbaric&quot; and that Jewish doctors responded to these criticisms with defences of the ritual or proposals for modification or reform. By the late 19th century some Jewish doctors in the country defended circumcision by saying it had health advantages. Today the Rabbinical Council of America, the largest group of Modern Orthodox rabbis, endorses using a glass tube as a substitute of &quot;metzitzah&quot;.

However, a growing number of contemporary Jews and Intactivist Jewish groups in the United States and Israel, both secular and religious, started to question overall long-term effects, psychological and psychophysical consequences of trauma caused by circumcision on Jewish children, and choose not to circumcise their sons. They are assisted by a small number of Reform, Liberal, and Reconstructionist rabbis, and have developed a welcoming ceremony that they call the &quot;Brit shalom&quot; (&quot;Covenant [of] Peace&quot;) for such children, also accepted by Humanistic Judaism.

===Middle Ages to the 19th century===
====Judaism and Christianity====
Thomas Aquinas in his &quot;Summa Theologica&quot; questioned why, if under Jewish doctrine circumcision removed original sin, Jesus was circumcised – as Jesus had no original sin. Steve Jones suggests there is a theological tradition that Jesus regained his foreskin at the Ascension. &quot;Had he failed to do so, the Saved would themselves have to be operated upon in Paradise so as not to be more perfect than their Saviour.&quot;

The Jews were expelled from England by Edward I in 1290, ostensibly over social tensions concerning usury. But the public imagination had been gripped by blood libel since at least the 12th century: &quot;So pervasive was the belief that Jews circumcised their victims ... that Menasseh ben Israil, the Dutch Rabbi who sought from Cromwell the readmission of the Jews in 1656, had to dwell at considerable length in his &quot;Vindiciae Judaeorum&quot; at refuting the claim.&quot;

In 15th-century Spain, most Jews and Muslims were expelled and the Spanish Inquisition monitored and prosecuted converts to Christianity to ensure they were not secretly practising Judaism, consorting with Jews or engaging in Jewish practices such as circumcision.

====Mesoamerican cultures====

In 1521, Cortés defeated the Aztec empire in Mesoamerica, which was followed by a large influx of Spanish clergy, whose writings provide most of information about pre-conquest Aztec life and customs largely assembled from interviews with those who survived the invasion and subsequent epidemics, and their descendants. Diego Durán, a Dominican friar, was convinced that the Aztecs were one of the lost tribes of Israel, with a crucial piece of supporting evidence being that they had practised circumcision.

So influential was this notion that 300 years later Bancroft in his monumental &quot;Native Races&quot; began his discussion of circumcision by writing: &quot;Whether the custom of circumcision, which has been the great prop of argument in favor of the Jewish origin of the Aztecs, really obtained among these people, has been doubted by numerous authors,&quot; concluding that it probably existed in a &quot;certain form among some tribes&quot; (p278). The key being &quot;a certain form&quot;, since Bancroft makes clear in a footnote that the majority of his sources, including Clavigero, Ternaux-Compans, Carbajal Espinosa, Oviedo y Herrera, and especially Acosta, believed Durán and others &quot;confounded the custom of drawing blood from the secret organs with circumcision&quot;, and &quot;the incision on the prepuce and ear to have been mistaken for circumcision&quot;, adding that this blood-letting rite was &quot;chiefly performed upon sons of great men&quot; (p279). The case was not helped by the fact no reports of seeing a circumcised adult Aztec existed in the literature. Remondino says it is &quot;a matter of controversy&quot; whether the foreskin had actually been removed (p46).

In regard to the Mayans, Bancroft says that in 1858 Brasseur de Bourbourg reported finding &quot;traces&quot;
 of circumcision in the sources, despite Cogolludo having reported that &quot;circumcision was unknown to the Indians of Yucatan&quot; (pp279, 679). But in 1864 Brasseur published his French translation of Diego de Landa&#x27;s recently recovered 1556 ethnographic manuscript, which decisively rejected the notion of Mayan circumcision, and in a footnote he acknowledged there had probably been a &quot;mistake&quot;, an admission that never found its way into the English-language literature although modern ethnography has long since understood the nature of these rituals. However, the Aztecs and Mayans are included by many authors from other disciplines among the list of pre-modern people who practised circumcision. Examples of such sources include UNAIDS, Kaplan, and Weiss.

====Later times====
Countries that do not circumcise have often held antipathy for those that do. Being circumcised was often seen as a sign of disgrace. According to Darby, it was also seen as a serious loss of erogenous tissue: &quot;During the Renaissance and 18th century the centrality of the foreskin to male sexual function and the pleasure of both partners was recognised by anatomists Berengario da Carpi, Gabriello Fallopio and William Harvey, in popular sex manuals like Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;master-piece&quot;, and by physicians like John Hunter, who also appreciated the importance of the foreskin in providing the slack tissue needed to accommodate an erection.&quot;

In 1650, English physician John Bulwer in his study of body modification, &quot;Anthropometamorphosis: Man Transform&#x27;d, or the Artificial Changeling&quot;, wrote of the loss in sexual pleasure resulting from circumcision: &quot;the part which hangeth over the end of the foreskin, is moved up and down in coition, that in this attrition it might gather more heat, and increase the pleasure of the other sexe; a contentation of which they [the circumcised] are defrauded by this injurious invention. For, the shortnesse of the prepuce is reckoned among the organical defects of the yard, … yet circumcision detracts somewhat from the delight of women, by lessening their titillation.&quot; The English historian Edward Gibbon, author of &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, referred to the practice as &quot;a painful and often dangerous rite&quot;, and a &quot;singular mutilation&quot; practiced only by Jews and Turks.

==Modern debates==

===Tengrism===
Tengri Turks, a neo-paganist term for Turks who practice the ancient faith of Tengrism, categorically oppose male circumcision. Fathers who are circumcised themselves no longer have their sons circumcised, since it is not an original old Turkish tradition, but has found its way through Islam.

===Ethics===
The ethical view of circumcision varies by country. In the United States, which has a high circumcision rate, the American Medical Association stated in 2011 that they &quot;will oppose any attempts to intrude into legitimate medical practice and the informed choices of patients&quot;. In 2012, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a technical report and a policy statement on non-therapeutic infant circumcision, stating that preventive health benefits of elective circumcision of male newborns outweigh the risks of the procedure, although the health benefits are not great enough to recommend routine circumcision for all male newborns, and that parents ultimately should decide whether circumcision is in the best interests of their male child.

After the release of the position statement, a debate appeared in the journal &quot;Pediatrics&quot; and the &quot;Journal of Medical Ethics&quot;. In 2013, a group of 38 Northern European pediatricians, doctors, surgeons, ethicists, and lawyers co-authored a comment stating that they found the AAP&#x27;s technical report and policy statement suffered from cultural bias, and reached recommendations and conclusions different from those of physicians in other parts of the world; in particular, the group advocated instead a policy of no-harm towards infants and respect for their rights of bodily integrity and age of consent. Two authors stated that, in their view, the AAP&#x27;s 2012 analysis was inaccurate, improper, and incomplete. The AAP received further criticism from Intactivist groups that oppose circumcision.

The American Academy of Pediatrics responded that because about half of American males are circumcised and half are not, there may be a more tolerant view concerning circumcision in the US, but that if there is any cultural bias among the AAP taskforce who wrote the Circumcision Policy statement, it is much less important than the bias Frisch et al. may hold because of clear prejudices against the practice that can be found in Europe. The AAP then explained why they reached conclusions regarding the health benefits of circumcision that are different from the ones reached by some of their European counterparts.

In 2017, the American Medical Association&#x27;s &quot;Journal of Ethics&quot; published two articles challenging the morality of performing non-therapeutic infant circumcision.

===History===
Circumcision spread in several English-speaking nations from the late 19th century, with the introduction of anesthesia and antisepsis rapidly expanding surgical practice. Doctors such as Sir Jonathan Hutchinson in England wrote articles in favour of the procedure on medical and social grounds, popularizing it in his home country, as well as the Anglosphere. Peter Charles Remondino, a San Diego physician, wrote &quot;History of Circumcision from the Earliest Times to the Present: Moral and Physical Reasons for Its Performance&quot; (1891), to promote circumcision. Lewis Sayre, a prominent orthopedic surgeon at the time, was another early American advocate and is generally credited with popularizing the procedure in the United States. However, the theories on which many early claims were made, such as the reflex theory of disease and the alleged harmful effects of masturbation, have long since been abandoned by the medical profession.

An early British opponent of circumcision was Herbert Snow, who wrote a short book called &quot;The barbarity of circumcision as a remedy for congenital abnormality&quot; in 1890. But as late as 1936, L. E. Holt, an author of pediatric textbooks, advocated male and female circumcision as a treatment for masturbation. The first serious questioning of the practice did not occur until late 1949, when the Scottish neonatologist and pediatrician Douglas Gairdner published &quot;The Fate of the Foreskin&quot; in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;; according to Wallerstein, this began to significantly affect the practice of circumcision in the United Kingdom.

According to Darby and Cox, the persistence of circumcision in the US has led to more vigorous protest movements. A 1980 protest march at the California State Capitol was reported in an Associated Press article. The National Organization of Circumcision Information Resource Centers (NOCIRC) was formed by Marilyn Milos, R.N., in 1985. The organization&#x27;s stated objective is to secure the birthright of male, female, and intersex children and babies to keep their sex organs intact. Protest rallies have been held in the US and other areas. NOCIRC have consistently criticised the American medical community&#x27;s circumcision guidelines. According to Milos and Donna Macris, &quot;The need to defend the baby&#x27;s right to a peaceful beginning was brought to light by Dr. Frederick Leboyer in his work, &quot;Birth Without Violence&quot;&quot;.

This period also saw the formation of anti-circumcision organizations in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and South Africa. Activists began creating websites in the mid-1990s, and this process has continued. One such organization distributed questionnaires to men who felt harmed by their circumcisions. The complaints included prominent scarring (33%), insufficient penile skin for comfortable erection (27%), erectile curvature from uneven skin loss (16%), and pain and bleeding upon erection/manipulation (17%). Psychological complaints included feelings of mutilation (60%), low self-esteem/inferiority to intact men (50%), genital dysmorphia (55%), rage (52%), resentment/depression (59%), violation (46%), or parental betrayal (30%). Many respondents reported that their physical/emotional suffering impeded emotional intimacy with their partner(s), resulting in sexual dysfunction. Prominent men known to be unhappy about being circumcised include Sigmund Freud, A. E. Housman, W. H. Auden, Geoffrey Keynes and his brother John Maynard Keynes, the economist. In 1996 the British Medical Journal published a letter by 20 men saying that &quot;we have been harmed by circumcision in childhood&quot;; they argued that &quot;it cannot be ethical for a doctor to amputate normal tissue from a normal child&quot;. Dr. Benjamin Spock (1903 – 1998), whose &quot;Baby and Child Care&quot; is the biggest selling American single-author book in history, originally supported circumcision but changed his mind near the end of his life.

=== Medical controversies ===
====United States medical view====

In the United States, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), which collaborated to produce the 2012 statements issued by the AAP, position paper as of 2012 stated:

In cases such as the decision to perform a circumcision in the newborn period (where there is reasonable disagreement about the balance between medical benefits and harms, where there are nonmedical benefits and harms that can result from a decision on whether to perform the procedure, and where the procedure is not essential to the child&#x27;s immediate well-being), the parents should determine what is in the best interest of the child. In the pluralistic society of the United States, where parents are afforded wide authority for determining what constitutes appropriate child-rearing and child welfare, it is legitimate for the parents to take into account their own cultural, religious, and ethnic traditions, in addition to medical factors, when making this choice.

===Genital integrity===
The term &quot;genital integrity&quot; refers to the condition of having complete and unaltered genital organs. Genital integrity is the norm in Latin America and the Caribbean, all European states except for three countries in the Balkans with large Muslim populations: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo, and in most Asian countries.
T Hammond (1999) is of the view that every person has a right to a whole intact body and that, where minors are concerned, &quot;the unnecessary removal of a functioning body organ in the name of tradition, custom or any other non-disease related cause should never be acceptable to the health profession.&quot; He opines that such interventions are violations of individual bodily rights, and &quot;a breach of fundamental medical ethics principles&quot;.
Many opponents of circumcision see infant circumcision as unnecessary, harmful, and unethical; some want the procedures prohibited.

Others also see the genital cutting of children as a human rights and children&#x27;s rights issue, opposing the genital modification and mutilation of children, including circumcision, female genital mutilation (FGM), and intersex genital surgeries; a number of anti-circumcision organizations oppose sex assignment surgeries on infants with ambiguous genitalia.

Current laws in many countries, and both United States federal law as well as laws in several U.S. states, prohibit the genital modification and mutilation of female minors, with some exceptions based on medical need. Opponents of male circumcision assert that laws against genital modification and mutilation of minors should apply equally to males and females.

However, linking male circumcision to FGM is highly controversial. Organizations involved in combating FGM have been at considerable pains to distinguish the two, as this UNICEF document explains: &quot;When the practice first came to be known beyond the societies in which it was traditionally carried out, it was generally referred to as &#x27;female circumcision&#x27;. This term, however, draws a direct parallel with male circumcision and, as a result, creates confusion between these two distinct practices.&quot; This stance has been largely echoed by Western medical and political authorities. A Royal Dutch Medical Association viewpoint says that the form of female genital mutilation that resembles non-therapeutic circumcision the most is rejected unanimously throughout literature. The Association also says &quot;FGM takes many forms. There is the most severe form, infibulation, in which the inner and outer labia are stitched together and the clitoris is removed. However, there are also much milder forms of FGM, in which only the foreskin of the clitoris is removed.&quot;

In the United States, the organization MGMbill.org has sent a proposed bill to the US Congress and 15 state legislatures every year since 2004 in order to extend the prohibition on genital modification and mutilation of minors to include male and intersex children.

===In U.S. politics===

Though the issue of infant circumcision is generally not discussed by U.S. politicians, circumcision controversies have occasionally arisen in the U.S. political system.

In 2011, anti-circumcision activists in San Francisco gathered over 12,000 signatures to put a measure on the city&#x27;s ballot in November that would ban circumcisions of males under 18. Proponents of the ban argued that circumcision is not medically necessary and that the choice should be left up to the child rather than the parents, while opponents of the ban, such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Jewish Committee, argued that circumcision is a recognized medical procedure with clear health benefits and that the measure would violate religious freedoms and cause unnecessary religious strife. The measure was ultimately removed from the ballot, as a court ruled that it would violate a state law leaving the regulation of medical procedures up to the state rather than cities. Following this, California governor Jerry Brown signed a law preventing localities in California from banning circumcision.

In 2019, then-candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination Andrew Yang declared himself &quot;[a]gainst the practice&quot; of routine infant circumcision. This received coverage from several outlets, as major politicians discussing circumcision has been rare, with Yang being the only candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination to talk about it. Though Yang said he would push for giving parents more information about this decision if elected, he also stated that he supported the parents&#x27; choice to have their child circumcised for religious or cultural reasons, and would not support a ban on the practice. Intact America&#x27;s Georganne Chapin speculated that Yang&#x27;s support of parental choice was likely a result of political pressure.

===Other contemporary controversies===
====Controversy in Israel====
Opposition to circumcision exists among Jews in Israel. Protests for children&#x27;s rights have occurred there. Even though there is often pressure from family on parents to circumcise their sons, &quot;more and more families&quot; are preferring to abstain from circumcision.

====Controversy in South Africa====
In the Xhosa areas of South Africa, the large death toll from traditional circumcision provides a constant source of friction between traditional leaders, who oppose medicalised procedures, and health authorities. In 2009 in the Eastern Cape Province alone, 80 boys died and hundreds were hospitalized after attending initiation schools. The controversy looked set to spread in 2010 to the Zulu, whose present-day king Goodwill Zwelithini has called for the reintroduction of customary circumcision after it was banned by Zulu king Shaka in the 19th century. Similar issues, though on a smaller scale, have arisen with traditional circumcision of Aborigines in remote areas of central Australia.

====Controversy in Germany====
On 26 June 2012, a court in Cologne, Germany, ruled that circumcision was &quot;inflicting bodily harm on boys too young to consent&quot;, deciding that the practice contravenes the &quot;interests of the child to decide later in life on his religious beliefs&quot;. The decision was based on the article &quot;Criminal Relevance of Circumcising Boys. A Contribution to the Limitation of Consent in Cases of Care for the Person of the Child&quot; published by Holm Putzke, a German law professor at the University of Passau. The court&#x27;s decision that a child&#x27;s right to physical integrity trumps religious and parental rights applied only within the jurisdiction of that court, the city of Cologne. The ruling was condemned by Jewish and Muslim groups in Europe. A broad majority of German lawmakers passed a resolution asking Angela Merkel&#x27;s government to clarify the ruling so as to allow Jews and Muslims to continue to practice their religion. On 12 December 2012, following a series of hearings and consultations, the Bundestag adopted a law explicitly permitting non-therapeutic circumcision to be performed under certain conditions by a vote of 434–100, with 46 abstentions.

== Anti-circumcision movement ==

Some anti-circumcision activists, sometimes called intactivists (a portmanteau of &quot;intact&quot; and &quot;activist&quot;), consider circumcision to be genital mutilation, and celebrate the foreskin as a natural, beneficial, and functional part of the penis. Various organisations have been set up specifically for the purpose, and other organisations have stated their support for the movement.

<text>The Kokoda Track or Trail is a single-file foot thoroughfare that runs overland – in a straight line – through the Owen Stanley Range in Papua New Guinea (PNG). The track was the location of the 1942 World War II battle between Japanese and Allied – primarily Australian – forces in what was then the Australian territory of Papua.

The track runs from Owers&#x27; Corner in Central Province, east of Port Moresby, across rugged and isolated terrain which is only passable on foot, to the village of Kokoda in Oro Province. It reaches a height of as it passes around the peak of Mount Bellamy. The track travels primarily through the land of the Mountain Koiari people.

Hot, humid days with intensely cold nights, torrential rainfall and the risk of endemic tropical diseases such as malaria make it a challenging trek. Hiking the trail normally takes between four and twelve days; the fastest recorded time is 16 hours 34 minutes.

== History ==
The track was first used by European miners in the 1890s to access the Yodda Kokoda goldfields. Between July 1942 and November 1942, a series of battles, afterwards called the Kokoda Track campaign, was fought between the Japanese and Australian forces. This action was memorialised in the newsreel documentary &quot;Kokoda Front Line!&quot;, filmed by cameraman Damien Parer, which won Australia&#x27;s first Academy Award for its director Ken G. Hall in 1942.
After the war, the track fell into disuse and disappeared in many places. John Landy, the long-distance runner, set a record of four days for the crossing using carriers and guides during the 1950s. In 1964, Angus Henry, the art teacher at Sogeri High School, with two of his students, John Kadiba and Misty Baloiloi, set a new record which was to stand until after the millennium by completing the journey in three and a quarter days without guides, carriers or any signposts or bridges.

In 2006, the Owen Stanley Ranges and Kokoda Track was included on the Tentative List for World Heritage along with three other sites from PNG. The 1.5 million hectare property is a mixed cultural and natural site covering a significant proportion of the Owen Stanley Ranges and including the Kokoda Track, Managalas Plateau and Mount Victoria and Mount Albert Edward region. The World War II battle sites were a key reason for cultural listing along with the unique cultures of the Koiari peoples. The Owen Stanley Ranges, through which the Kokoda Track passes, is one of the most biologically important areas in the Asia Pacific with over 4000 plant species and many endemic bird and animal species.

The Kokoda Track Foundation, established in 2003, helps villages along the track with education and healthcare. There is a proposal to turn the track into an Australian heritage destination on a par with ANZAC Cove at Gallipoli. Creation of the heritage area, is in part a response to the issue of an Australian gold mining company wanting to mine on or near the track. , the idea was backed by the Australian government and Papua New Guinea&#x27;s foreign minister.

In November 2007, Australian mining firm Frontier Resources announced plans to divert a section of the track to make way for a copper mine. The plan has the support of the local landowners and the Papua New Guinean government but has been criticised by trekking operators.

The track has been closed numerous times by villagers along the route in response to various grievances. In May 2009, villagers at Kovelo – near Kokoda village – blocked the track after complaints that money collected from trekking fees was not being distributed fairly.

=== Popularity and deaths ===

Since 2001, there has been a rapid increase in the number of people walking the track (see table at right). Six Australian trekkers have died from hyponatremia while attempting to walk the track. Four of those deaths occurred in 2009, with two in the same week in April and another two 8 days apart in September and October. The deaths have sparked calls for mandatory fitness tests for all walkers before starting.

As the trail&#x27;s popularity increased, there were calls for more regulation of trek operators, with some operators taking as many as 150 walkers in a group. In response, the Kokoda Track Authority announced that from the beginning of 2010, tour operators would require a commercial licence.

In August 2009, a group of trekkers were killed when their light plane, Airlines PNG Flight 4684, crashed en route to Kokoda Station. All 13 people on board, including 9 Australian trekkers, were killed in the crash. As a result, the Australian Government committed $1.8 million to improve the safety of airstrips at Kokoda, Menari, Kagi, Melei, Efogi, and Naduri, villages located along the track. A second radio channel was also installed to deal with emergencies and maintenance work.

In October 2009, Don Vale became the oldest Australian (at 83) to successfully complete the Kokoda Track.

In November 2009, Australian paralympian Kurt Fearnley (born without the lower section of his spine) completed the track, crawling north to south, in 11 days. A multiple paralympic gold medalist (T54 Marathon in Athens and Beijing), he used customized shin pads and wrist guards. His journey was to raise awareness of men&#x27;s health issues and was inspired by the story of Corporal John Metson, who crawled the track for three weeks, refusing the assistance of a stretcher on the grounds it would burden his comrades.

== Nomenclature ==

There has been much debate in Australia about whether it should be called the &quot;Kokoda Trail&quot; or the &quot;Kokoda Track&quot;. The monument at Owers&#x27; Corner uses both terms: &quot;Track&quot; on one side and &quot;Trail&quot; on the other. The earliest mention of the route in an Australian newspaper may be in The Argus on Wednesday 29 July 1942 in a map when it refers to &quot;the Buna Kokoda-Moresby track&quot;. &quot;Kokoda Trail&quot; was gazetted as the official name of the route by the Australian administration of Papua New Guinea in 1972.

According to historian Stuart Hawthorne, before World War II, the route was referred to as &quot;the overland mail route&quot; or &quot;the Buna road&quot;. He states that &quot;Kokoda Trail&quot; became common because of its use in Australian newspapers during the war, the first known instance being in Sydney&#x27;s &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; on 27 October 1942. However, all three terms Kokoda Track, Kokoda Trail and Buna-Kokoda road were commonly used during World War II in Australian newspapers from September 1942.

The diary of the Australian Army&#x27;s 2/33rd Battalion records the route being officially designated as the &quot;Kokoda Trail&quot; in September 1942. The Australian Army has used &quot;Kokoda Trail&quot; as a battle honour since 1957. The Australian War Memorial (AWM) says that &quot;trail&quot; is probably of United States origin but has been used in many Australian history books and &quot;appears to be used more widely&quot;.

Despite the historical use of &quot;Trail&quot;, &quot;Track&quot; gained dominance in the 1990s, with the Australian &quot;Macquarie Dictionary&quot; stating that while both versions were in use, Kokoda Track &quot;appears to be the more popular of the two&quot;.

== Trekking ==

The track can be walked from either direction. It can take up to 12 days to complete, depending on fitness and rest time involved. Locals are renowned for being able to regularly complete it in 3 days. There are a number of guesthouses located along the way, some at villages and others at traditional rest spots. The main villages passed through (from Owers&#x27; Corner) are Naoro, Menari, Efogi Creek 1 &amp; 2, Kagi or Naduri (if shortcut is taken), Alolo, Isurava, Hoi, Kovolo. Villagers are increasingly taking part in the commercial opportunities created by the growing number of tourists; in October 2006, some were known to be selling cans of soft drink and beer at double the price payable in Port Moresby.

The Kokoda Track Authority (the PNG Special Purpose Authority with responsibility for managing the Track) requires tour operators to hold a Commercial Operators Licence to lead treks along the Kokoda Track and purchase a trek permit. Licensed operators carry first aid kits, undertake first aid training, carry radios or satellite phones, respect the people who live along the Track and ensure their porters and guides are treated in a professional manner. A list of licensed operators is available on its website. Trekkers walking with unlicensed operators will be stopped by the KTA rangers and the local people.

== Kokoda Challenge Race ==
The Kokoda Challenge Race is an endurance running race that was revived on 27 August 2005. The race originally ran in 1975 but stopped before becoming an annual event.

The Kokoda Challenge inaugural race commenced in 2005. The current race record holder in both directions is Brendan Buka, with a best time of 16:34.05 in 2008 from Owers Corner to Kokoda and a time of 17:20 in the direction of Kokoda to Owers&#x27; Corner via Naduri.


=== 2005 ===
The inaugural race of 27 August 2005 was won by John Hunt Hiviki, who completed it in 22 hours, one minute and 14 seconds.

=== 2006 ===
On 27 August 2006, Brendan Buka, a 22-year-old Papua New Guinean trekking porter from Kokoda, conquered the trail from Owers&#x27; Corner to Kokoda in a winning time of 17 hours, 49 minutes and 17 seconds. A Sydney engineer, Damon Goerke, 32 became the first Australian to run the track in under 24 hours, coming third in the 2006 challenge with a time of just under 19.5 hours.

=== 2007 ===
The race record was again broken by Buka in the 2007 event when he completed the track in 17 hours 20 minutes on 26 August 2007, running in the reverse direction from Kokoda to Owers&#x27; Corner. The 2007 event also featured runners running from Owers&#x27; Corner to Kokoda and a winning time of 19 hours 9 minutes was set in this direction by Tom Hango. Megan Davidson, a trek leader with Back Track Adventures, was the first Australian female to run the track in 36 hours, coming 12th overall.

=== 2008 ===
On 31 August 2008, Buka once again set a new record, with a time of 16:34:05. The conditions were the worst that they had been in the three years that Buka had competed in the event. Wayne Urina, claiming second place, is currently the second fastest man to complete the crossing of the Kokoda Trail with a time of 18:34:06. Cyprian Aire came third with 19:11:40.

=== 2011 ===
In 2011, the Kokoda Challenge Race was run on 27 August. The race started from Owers&#x27; Corner and finished at the new Kokoda Archway. The race was organised and sponsored by Kokoda Trekking. Brendan Buka once again won the race in a time of 17:50:33 but did not break his 2008 record.

=== 2012 ===
The Kokoda Challenge Race in 2012 was run on 25 August. The race began from the Kokoda Archway and went for the first time via Kagi Village to Owers&#x27; Corner. The race was once again sponsored by Kokoda Trekking. The winner was trail porter Ramsy Idau of Kokoda, with a time of 18:28:00. Prize money was set at K10,000 PNG Kina. The race saw for the first time two Japanese runners competing against the eight Australians and 22 Papua New Guineans, on the 70th anniversary of the Kokoda Campaign. The two Japanese runners, Makoto Yoshimoto and Yukiya Higuchi finished in a time of 42:56:36.

<text>The Coast Salish languages, also known as the Central Salish languages, are a branch of the Salishan language family. These languages are spoken by First Nations or Native American peoples inhabiting the Pacific Northwest, in the territory that is now known as the southwest coast of British Columbia around the Strait of Georgia and Washington State around Puget Sound. The term &quot;Coast Salish&quot; also refers to the cultures in British Columbia and Washington who speak one of these languages or dialects.

== Geography ==
The Coast Salish languages are spoken around most of the Georgia and Puget Sound Basins, an area that encompasses the sites of the modern-day cities of Vancouver, British Columbia, Seattle, Washington, and others. Archeological evidence indicates that Coast Salish peoples may have inhabited the area as far back as 9000 BCE. What is now Seattle, for example, has been inhabited since the end of the last glacial period (c. 8,000 BCE—10,000 years ago).

In the past, the Nuxálk language (also known as Bella Coola) of British Columbia&#x27;s Central Coast has also been considered Coast Salish. This language shares at least one phonological change with Coast Salish (the merger of the Proto-Salish pharyngeal approximants with the uvular fricatives), but it also displays certain similarities to the Interior Salish languages. If it is indeed a member of the Coast Salish branch, it was the first to split off from the rest.

== Classification ==
The Coast Salish languages can be classified in anywhere from one to three branches. The Tsamosan and Tillamook languages are often considered by linguists to be independent branches under the Salishan language family, and not part of the Coast Salish branch.

<text>Cuno Hoffmeister (2 February 1892 – 2 January 1968) was a German astronomer, observer and discoverer of variable stars, comets and minor planets, and founder of Sonneberg Observatory.

Born in Sonneberg in 1892 to Carl and Marie Hoffmeister, Cuno Hoffmeister obtained his first telescope in 1905 and became an avid amateur astronomer. After his father lost most of his money in 1914, Hoffmeister had to leave school in 1916 to start an apprenticeship in his father&#x27;s company. During this time he continued to study spherical mathematics and trigonometry. In April 1915 he had the opportunity to substitute as the assistant of Ernst Hartwig at &quot;Remeis Observatory&quot; in Bamberg while the current holder of the position was drafted, mainly working on observations of meteors and variable stars. He held this position until the end of the war and then moved back to Sonneberg, where he made his Abitur in 1920.

After studying at the University of Jena, while at the same time continuing to work in his job as a tradesman, Hoffmeister obtained his doctorate in 1927. During this time he had already started building what was to become Sonneberg Observatory. After his PhD, he moved back to Sonneberg and started expanding the observatory. Hoffmeister remained at the observatory until his death, even though the observatory lost most of its equipment after World War II and he was disowned as the observatory became part of East Germany&#x27;s academy of sciences. Hoffmeister served as the director of the observatory until his death. During his life he played a leading role in supporting amateurs in observations of noctilucent clouds, aurorae, and nightglow.

== Discoveries ==
During his active life as an astronomer, Hoffmeister discovered approximately 10,000 variable stars on the more than 100,000 photographic plates taken at Sonneberg Observatory. The Minor Planet Center credits him with the discovery of 5 asteroids between 1938 and 1963. He also co-discovered C/1959 O1, a hyperbolic comet, in 1959.

== Honors ==

The lunar crater &quot;Hoffmeister&quot; and the two minor planets 1726 Hoffmeister and 4183 Cuno were named in his honor (). Also Hoffmeister&#x27;s star in Cassiopeia (V442 = Sonneberg 9484) and Hoffmeister&#x27;s cloud at 20h47m/-42°.

<text>William Claire Menninger (October 15, 1899 – September 6, 1966) was a co-founder with his brother Karl and his father of The Menninger Foundation in Topeka, Kansas, an internationally known center for treatment of behavioral disorders.

==Life and career==
===Early life and education===
Menninger was born on October 15, 1899, in Topeka, Kansas, the son of Florence Vesta (Kinsley) and Charles Frederick Menninger. He had two older brothers: Karl and Edwin. Menninger graduated from Washburn University in 1919 and went on to follow his father and brother into medicine. In 1924 he graduated from the Cornell University College of Medicine in New York State. After completing a two-year internship at Bellevue Hospital, he studied psychiatry at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C., in 1927.

===Marriage and family===
Menninger married Catherine Wright on December 11, 1925. They had three sons together: Roy W. Menninger, Philip B. Menninger, and W. Walter Menninger. They later each became active in the Boy Scouts, reaching the rank of Eagle Scouts, and each receiving the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.

===Psychiatry===
In 1927 Menninger returned to Topeka, where he joined his father and brother Karl in their medical practice. By that time, they had already begun to specialize in psychiatry, a relatively new field in the United States. With his contributions, the Menninger Clinic evolved into the Menninger Sanitarium. Together they developed the Menninger Foundation. This non-profit organization has provided clinical services to both in- and out-patients, and engages in research, education, and social outreach.

Menninger was an early innovator and advocate for the use of bibliotherapy in treating mental illness. Along with his brother Karl, Menninger utilized bibliotherapy at the Menninger Clinic. Following the success of Karl&#x27;s book, &quot;The Human Mind&quot;, Menninger presented a paper to the American Psychiatric Association in 1937.

===Boy Scouts===
Menninger was involved with the Boy Scouts of America&#x27;s Sea Scouts program in the 1930s. He was skipper of the S.S.S. &quot;Kansan&quot;, which was the National Flagship for 1931 and 1933. The skipper&#x27;s manual which he wrote for the Kansas Sea Scouts was later used as the basis for the BSA&#x27;s &quot;Handbook for Skippers&quot;. Menninger was also a member of the National Sea Scout Committee during this time. Each of his three sons later became active in the Scouts, attaining the rank of Eagle Scout.

===Second World War===
At the outset of World War II, Menninger left the family foundation for an appointment as the director of the Psychiatry Consultants Division in the office of the Surgeon General of the United States Army. He chaired the committee which produced document &quot;Medical 203&quot;, a major revision of existing US classification of mental disorders. It was adopted by all the armed services.

Following the war, this document strongly influenced the first mental disorders section of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases published in 1949. Its influence could be seen even more on the first &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,&quot; published in 1952. Menninger attained the rank of brigadier general (O-7) in the U.S. Army.

<text>Segfault (1998–2001) was a popular humor website that posted fake news reports on hacker-related topics on a near-daily basis. The range of topics was approximately the same as that covered and regularly discussed on the Slashdot — including free software, Internet phenomena, computer programming, and technology in general. The name &quot;segfault&quot; refers to the segmentation fault, a computer software error.

Most stories were written and submitted by the site&#x27;s readers. The site itself was run by Scott James Remnant, who later went on to work on Ubuntu and ChromeOS, and Leonard Richardson. One famous name in the contributor list is Peter Norvig, who submitted the story &quot;Songwriters, Publishers Sue Themselves&quot;.

In late 2001, the site shut down after losing its web server. Attempts to relocate the site to a new host failed, as it turned out that the database containing all the stories had been lost and that there were no backups available. The segfault.org domain has subsequently shown messages about the site&#x27;s status; some have indicated a resurrection attempt being in progress, but nothing appears to have happened.

Some of the content has been recovered and is available via the Internet Archive.

==Stories==
The following is an excerpt from the Segfault story &quot;Man clicks Internet banner ad&quot;:
Another Segfault story, &quot;Microsoft Supercomputer Discovers New Integer Between 5 and 6&quot;, reported the following:

==Trolling==
Many of the Slashdot trolling phenomena posts started out on Segfault. During its earlier days, Segfault would allow anybody viewing the site to comment upon the stories therein. Such comments were visible to any other visitors to the site, and initially tended to expand upon the themes within the story and add to the humor. However, as time went on more of the posts were troll posts (such as &quot;naked and petrified&quot; posts) which added little to the site. However, Segfault lacked any mechanism to remove trolls and their posts – unlike Slashdot and its moderation system, or Wikipedia&#x27;s system of peer review.

As a result, the comments became ever more offensive. Eventually the operator of Segfault was forced to disable the comment feature.

<doc id="765800" wikidata="Q830054" url="?curid=765800" title="Saint Sophia Cathedral, Kyiv">
<text>Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv, Ukraine, is an architectural monument of Kievan Rus&#x27;. The former cathedral is one of the city&#x27;s best known landmarks and the first heritage site in Ukraine to be inscribed on the World Heritage List along with the Kyiv Cave Monastery complex. Aside from its main building, the cathedral includes an ensemble of supporting structures such as a bell tower and the House of Metropolitan. In 2011 the historic site was reassigned from the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Regional Development of Ukraine to the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine. One of the reasons for the move was that both Saint Sophia Cathedral and Kyiv Pechersk Lavra are recognized by the UNESCO World Heritage Program as one complex, while in Ukraine the two were governed by different government entities. The cathedral is a museum.

The complex of the cathedral is the main component and museum of the National Reserve &quot;Sophia of Kyiv&quot; which is the state institution responsible for the preservation of the cathedral complex as well as four other historic landmarks across the nation.

==History==
The cathedral is named after the 6th-century Hagia Sophia (&quot;Holy Wisdom&quot;) cathedral in Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), which was dedicated to the Holy Wisdom rather than to a specific saint named Sophia. The first foundations were laid in 1037 or 1011, but the cathedral took two decades to complete. According to one theory, Yaroslav the Wise sponsored the construction of the Saint Sophia Cathedral in 1037 to celebrate his decisive victory over the nomadic Pechenegs in 1036 (who thereafter were never a threat to Kyiv). According to Dr. Nadia Nikitenko, a historian who has studied the cathedral for 30 years, the cathedral was founded in 1011, under the reign of Yaroslav&#x27;s father, Grand Prince of Kievan Rus, Vladimir the Great. This has been accepted by both UNESCO and Ukraine, which officially celebrated the 1000th anniversary of the cathedral during 2011. The structure has 5 naves, 5 apses, and (quite surprisingly for Byzantine architecture) 13 cupolas. It is surrounded by two-tier galleries from three sides. Measuring , the exterior used to be faced with plinths. On the inside, it retains mosaics and frescos from the 11th century, including a dilapidated representation of Yaroslav&#x27;s family, and the Orans.

Originally the cathedral was a burial place of the Kievan rulers including Vladimir Monomakh, Vsevolod Yaroslavich and the cathedral&#x27;s founder Yaroslav I the Wise, although only the latter&#x27;s grave survived to this day (see picture).

After the pillaging of Kyiv by Andrei Bogolyubsky of Vladimir-Suzdal in 1169, followed by the Mongol invasion of Rus&#x27; in 1240, the cathedral fell into disrepair. It was greatly rebuilt in its modern splendor in the 16th century, when the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was trying to unite Catholic and Orthodox churches. Following the 1595–96 Union of Brest, the Cathedral of Holy Sophia belonged to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church which commissioned the repair work and the upper part of the building was thoroughly rebuilt, modeled by the Italian architect Octaviano Mancini in the distinct Ukrainian Baroque style, while preserving the Byzantine interior, keeping its splendor intact. The work continued under the Cossack Hetman Ivan Mazepa until 1767. During this period around Holy Sophia Cathedral a bell tower, a monastery canteen, a bakery, a &quot;House of Metropolitan&quot;, the western gates (Zborovski gates), a Monastic Inn, a Brotherhood campus and a bursa (seminary) were all erected. All of these buildings, as well as the cathedral after the reconstruction, have distinctive features of Ukrainian Baroque.
After the October Revolution of 1917 in Russia and during the Soviet anti-religious campaign of the 1920s, the government plan called for the cathedral&#x27;s destruction and transformation of the grounds into a park &quot;Heroes of Perekop&quot; (after a Red Army victory in the Russian Civil War in Crimea). The cathedral was saved from demolition (the opposite St. Michael&#x27;s Golden-Domed Monastery was blown up in 1935) primarily with the effort of many scientists and historians. Nevertheless, in 1934, Soviet authorities confiscated the structure from the church, including the surrounding 17th–18th-century architectural complex and designated it as an architectural and historical museum.
Since the late 1980s, Soviet, and later Ukrainian, politicians promised to return the building to the Orthodox Church. Due to various schisms and factions within the Church the return was postponed as all Orthodox and the Greek-Catholic Churches lay claim to it. Although all the Orthodox churches have been allowed to conduct services at different dates, at other times they are denied access. A severe incident was the funeral of Patriarch Volodymyr of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kyiv Patriarchate in 1995 when riot police were forced to prevent the burial on the premises of the museum and a bloody clash took place. After events such as those no religious body has yet been given the rights for regular services. The complex now remains a secular museum of Ukraine&#x27;s Christianity, with most of its visitors being tourists.

On 21 August 2007, the Holy Sophia Cathedral was named one of the Seven Wonders of Ukraine, based on votes by experts and the internet community.

In September 2023, Kyiv was listed as a World Heritage “in danger” because of Russia’s war in Ukraine. This move by the United Nations was an effort to produce aid and protection for the site.

<text>Beangrowers are a Maltese three-piece indie rock band consisting of Alison Galea (vocals, guitar and keyboard), Mark Sansone (bass guitar) and Ian Schranz (drums and noise). All three were born in 1977 in St. Julian&#x27;s, Malta. The members of the band are also songwriters, resulting in their albums reflecting diverse influences, including indie rock, punk, and goth.

==History==
Schranz (known by the stage name Bark Bark Disco) and Sansone were childhood friends and later started playing music together. They were joined by friend Galea. According to the band&#x27;s website, the name &#x27;Beangrowers&#x27; was given by a fan when a promoter demanded a name for posters. Galea provides a distinctive British-accented voice to Beangrowers songs.

The Beangrowers recorded demo tapes in early 1996 when the members were aged 18. Early recordings featured sounds from 1950s science fiction movies and computer-generated noise. Within a year they travelled to play in German clubs. The Beangrowers record mainly in English, but are best known in the German-speaking world. In 1999 their first single made the top 20 of the Deutsche Alternative Charts, an alternative rock sales ranking in Germany. Their single &quot;José Clemente&quot; from their album &quot;Beangrowers&quot; reached No. 7 on New Zealand charts.

Their single, The Priest, was featured on the soundtrack of Wim Wenders&#x27; 2004 movie Land of Plenty featuring Michelle Williams. Galea also sang for the Wim Wenders&#x27; soundtrack for the 2011 biopic &quot;Pina&quot; 2011. They also worked on the soundtrack for the movie 2012 movie Love Me, by Rick Bota.

Schranz, and his brother, bought Hole in the Wall, described as the oldest bar in Sliema, on a dare, in 2015, and made it a venue for live music.

==Musical style==

The group is influenced by alternative groups like the Violent Femmes, Joy Division, and the Pixies. The band notes that &quot;all the greats essentially wrote pop songs, like The Cure, Nirvana, Depeche Mode etc.&quot; Many of Beangrowers&#x27; songs, such as &quot;Teen Titans&quot; with repeating lyrics &quot;We never listen to the radio&quot; seem to reference the band&#x27;s own obscure indie status.

<doc id="765803" wikidata="Q734607" url="?curid=765803" title="A House of Pomegranates">
<text>A House of Pomegranates is a collection of fairy tales written by Oscar Wilde, published in 1891. It is Wilde&#x27;s second fairy tale collection, following &quot;The Happy Prince and Other Tales&quot; (1888). He said of the book that it was &quot;intended neither for the British child nor the British public&quot;.

==Influences==
Wilde&#x27;s fairy tales were heavily influenced by the Brothers Grimm as well as Hans Christian Andersen. He also derived his dialectic technique of paradox and the notion of pederastic code from Plato. Furthermore, Wilde was heavily influenced by Walter Pater; he called Pater&#x27;s &quot;The Renaissance: Studies in the History of Art and Poetry&quot; his &quot;golden book&quot;, declaring he never went anywhere without it. He also called it &quot;...the very flower of decadence; the last trumpet should have sounded the moment it was written&quot;. The aesthetics suggested by Pater guided Wilde in creating the worlds within &quot;A House of Pomegranates&quot;, each respective story reflecting decadent subjects and delving into their own senses of sensuality.

Despite this collection being similarly defined by decadent themes which &quot;...encode and express a pederastic ethos through the particular focus on sensual experience and moral enlightenment&quot;, he also preaches an orthodox Christian morality and pagan joys. While facing critique that his fairytales were not suited for children, he wrote that he &quot;had about as much intention of pleasing the British child as [he] had of pleasing the British public&quot;. Regardless, Wilde pulls readers away from rigid innocence and introduces new pleasures within his fairytales, offering an idealistic kind of sensuality.

===The Young King===
Nearing death, an old king reveals his secret grandson, who lived with a poor family, is next in line for the throne. The old king&#x27;s servants bring the son back. The son is thrilled with the change of lifestyle and admires all the riches he is surrounded by. He sends orders for more art, jewels and riches to be brought to him. Falling asleep, he dreams about the royal workshop, filled with malnourished workers. The young king asks one of the workers who their master is and the worker explains that the master is a man just like them, save for the fact that he lives a rich person&#x27;s life while the workers toil and suffer. The young king realizes they are working to make him a robe. He then has another dream, where a young worker dies collecting pearls for the king&#x27;s scepter. There is a third dream where Death and Avarice fight over the workers mining for the young king&#x27;s crown. Waking up, the young king refuses to wear the robe, crown and scepter. At first the people antagonize him for this, but soon they realize the king&#x27;s justness. 

===The Birthday of the Infanta===
A princess in Spain is celebrating her twelfth birthday; performers are invited to entertain the princess and she takes a liking to the dancing dwarf. Yet, nobody in the court wants to be near the dwarf because of his physical appearance. Later on, the princess gives the dwarf a white rose, with him thinking that this means she&#x27;s in love with him. They start to dance in the forest and the dwarf starts to dream of running away with the princess. However, he realizes why people shun him, as he sees his own reflection in a mirror and initially mistakes himself for a monster. The dwarf is miserable, having realized that the princess was only interested in mocking him. Shortly afterwards the princess walks in, demanding the dwarf to dance for her and he doesn&#x27;t respond, as he is dead from a broken heart. The princess then tells herself she will not play with people who have hearts from now on.

===The Fisherman and His Soul===
A fisherman catches a mermaid; he thinks she&#x27;s very beautiful and tries to keep her, but she pleads that he lets her go. He agrees on the condition that whenever he calls she comes and sings so he can catch fish. He falls in love with the mermaid and asks her to marry him; she explains she can&#x27;t unless he has no soul. The fisherman sees a young witch who agrees to help him get rid of his soul if he dances with her at the Witches&#x27; Sabbath. She tells the fisherman he can be free of his soul if he cuts his shadow away from his feet. Before they are separated, his soul asks the fisherman not to let him out without a heart, but the fisherman refuses. The soul promises to return every year and call for the fisherman. Over the next two years the soul brings tales of wisdom and riches, but the fisherman rejects all of these over love. The third year, the soul invites the fisherman to join him on his journey, but he tricks the fisherman into killing a merchant because the soul does not have a heart. He tries to return to the mermaid but she does not come back. Two years later the mermaid&#x27;s dead body washes ashore and the fisherman&#x27;s heart breaks, allowing him and the soul to completely merge as one. The fisherman drowns himself and dies.

===The Star-Child===
A poor lumberjack finds a baby and decides to take him home, raising the child as his own. The baby grows up to be a handsome young boy, but he is cruel and goes around torturing animals and people. One day he throws a stone at an old woman, with the lumberjack demanding him to stop. The old woman gasps, as she recognizes the little boy as the child she had birthed ten years ago. The boy is disgusted and refuses to believe that she is his mother. He runs off to play with his friends, but they refuse to play with him because he looks like a toad. He runs to the river and sees he has the face and scales of a toad. Realizing that this transformation is because he rejected his mother, he sets off to find her and gain her forgiveness. He wanders the world for three years; nobody will help him, and he is sold to an old man as a slave. The old man asks the boy to find three bars of white, yellow, and red gold. Yet, whenever he finds a bar of gold, he gives it to a beggar asking for money, choosing to suffer the old man&#x27;s cruel punishments. By the third time he helps the beggar, he is rewarded and honored by the entire city. He learns that his parents are in fact the king and queen, and eventually takes over the throne himself.

==Themes==

===Aestheticism===
Wilde&#x27;s detailed descriptions of beauty, separated from their traditional notions of virtues and &quot;social mores&quot; found in other fairy tales, become its perfection and end. &quot;The Young King&quot; features a main character who seeks beautiful things, even if it as the expense of others. In &quot;The Birthday of the Infanta&quot;, the ideals of beauty are ultimately shallow as the titular princess who is deemed the ideal beauty, is cruel. The third story, &quot;The Fisherman and His Soul&quot;, contains a quest that signifies the perilous nature of aesthetic obsession. The final story of the collection, &quot;The Star-Child&quot;, features detailed descriptions of beauty, and like the Infanta, the child is arrogant and proud despite his appearance—his looks are useless as they don&#x27;t determine his character.

===Judeo-Christian Imagery===
The collection&#x27;s title evokes Judeo-Christian imagery with the understanding of pomegranates associated with fertility, suffering, and the resurrection. Pomegranates also symbolize beauty in Judean understandings. Both heritages also view pomegranates as an &quot;aesthetic object&quot;. The pomegranate is also placed as a symbol of decadence, luxury and sumptuousness, fitting for the great detail and descriptions found in the stories regarding luxury and aesthetics.

In &quot;The Young King&quot; the titular character has a &quot;Christlike appeal&quot; and undergoes a spiritual transformation where he &quot;receives and projects the light of God&quot; into the room and in front of his subjects. Raised by and as a peasant, the young king becomes a Christian, crowned by God, and enters &quot;a new aesthetic realm...[where] Christianity...is the highest form of aestheticism&quot;. &quot;The Fisherman and His Soul&quot; portrays a similar exploration of Christian imagery while touching on themes of temptation, love, suffering and sin while being &quot;told in a manner reminiscent of the Holy Bible&quot;. The soul who drinks the &quot;sweet juices&quot; (1) of the pomegranates further descends into sin and temptation. At the end of the tale, the fisherman &quot;becomes a Christian&quot;, receiving God&#x27;s mercy and love at his grave, &quot;prompting a change in the wrathful priest, who speaks of all-embracing love and blesses all of God&#x27;s creatures&quot;.

===Greek mythology===
In Greek myth, pomegranates allude to blood and violence and life coming from death as well. In Ancient Greece, pomegranates are most prominent in the myth of Persephone, who consumed pomegranate seeds which required her to spend some time in the underworld and on land during specific seasons of the year. This cycle is attributed to the temptation and consumption of pomegranates. A similar allegorical exploration of the use of pomegranates in the Greek myth is featured in &quot;The Fisherman and His Soul&quot;. The repetition of pomegranate imagery in the story is used to reflect temptation, luxury and threat as the places the soul travels to: the Street of Pomegranates and the garden of pomegranates. The soul&#x27;s drinking of the pomegranate juices parallels Persphone&#x27;s consumption of the seeds and also &quot;serves as a signal that the places through which the soul passes can be seen to constitute a moral underworld&quot;. The ending of the story can also refer to the cycle of life and death in the myth of Persephone—the barren graves and the Sea-folk who left.

<text>Frank Youell Field was a football stadium on the west coast of the United States, located in Oakland, California. It was the home of the Oakland Raiders of the American Football League for four seasons, from 1962 through 1965.

The stadium was a temporary home while Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum was being built; it seated 22,000 and cost $400,000 to build. The facility was named for Francis J. Youell (1883–1967), an Oakland undertaker, owner of the Chapel of the Oaks, city councilman, and sports booster.
It was located at 900 Fallon Street, on the grounds of what is now part of Laney College, next to the channel which connects Lake Merritt to the Oakland Estuary and adjacent to the Nimitz Freeway. The site was formerly part of the &quot;Auditorium Village Housing Project&quot;, one of several temporary housing tracts built by the federal government in the San Francisco Bay Area for the thousands of workers who poured into the region during World War II to work in war industries, especially, in shipyards such as the Kaiser Shipyards. 

During their first two seasons, the Raiders played their home games in San Francisco, at Kezar Stadium (1960) and Candlestick Park (1960, 1961). They played their first regular season game at Frank Youell Field in 1962 on September 9 against the New York Titans and the Raiders lost, 28–17, the first of thirteen consecutive losses that season. The final game at the stadium in December 1965 was also against New York, renamed the Jets, and the Raiders won, 24–14.

Frank Youell Field remained in operation for several years and hosted some high school football games after the Raiders moved into the Coliseum in 1966; it was demolished in 1969 to make way for extra parking for Laney College.

<text>The Kia Forum, also known as Los Angeles Forum and formerly Great Western Forum, is a multi-purpose indoor arena in Inglewood, California, United States, adjacent to Los Angeles. Located on West Manchester Boulevard, with Pincay Drive to the south and between Kareem Court and Prairie Avenue to the east and west, it is north of SoFi Stadium and the Hollywood Park Casino, and about east of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).

The Forum opened on December 30, 1967. Architect Charles Luckman&#x27;s vision was realized by engineers Carl Johnson and Svend Nielsen. It was a groundbreaking structure without extensive internal support pillars that was unique in an indoor arena the size of the Forum.

From 1967 to 1999, the Forum was home to the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL) before both teams joined the NBA&#x27;s Los Angeles Clippers at the Crypto.com Arena, then known as the Staples Center. From 1997 to 2001, the Forum was also the home of the WNBA&#x27;s Los Angeles Sparks until they moved to Crypto.com Arena as well.

Alongside Madison Square Garden in New York City, the Forum was once one of the best-known indoor sports venues in the U.S., largely due to the Lakers&#x27; success and the Hollywood celebrities often seen there. It was the site of the 1972 and 1983 NBA All-Star Games, the 1981 NHL All-Star Game, 1984 Olympic basketball, and the Big West Conference (from 1983 to 1988) and 1989 Pacific-10 Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournaments. The venue also hosted tennis and boxing matches, as well as major music concerts and political events.

In 2000, the Forum was acquired by the Faithful Central Bible Church, which used it for occasional church services and leased it for sporting events, concerts, and other events. In 2012, the Forum was purchased by the Madison Square Garden Company (MSG), for $23.5 million; MSG announced plans to renovate the arena as a world-class concert venue. On September 24, 2014, the Forum was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. On March 24, 2020, Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer purchased The Forum from MSG for $400 million.

The Forum has previously been known as the Great Western Forum, and was nicknamed &quot;the Fabulous Forum&quot; by long-time Lakers play-by-play announcer Chick Hearn. It is also known informally as the LA Forum to distinguish it from other places with the name &quot;Forum&quot;.

== History ==
=== 1960s and 1970s ===
On the site of a former golf course, the &quot;fabulous&quot; Forum (as it was colloquially known to locals) was built in 1967 by Jack Kent Cooke (owner of the Lakers and founding owner of the Kings). The Canadian Cooke, who enjoyed ice hockey, was determined to bring the National Hockey League (NHL) to Los Angeles. In 1966, the NHL announced that it was adding six new franchises for 1967, and Cooke prepared a bid. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission, which operated the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, supported a competing bid headed by Los Angeles Rams owner Dan Reeves—who already had a hockey team at the Arena, the Western Hockey League&#x27;s Los Angeles Blades. The Commission told Cooke that if he won the franchise, he would not be allowed to use the facility.

In response, Cooke planned to build a new arena in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood. Nearly 30 years later, Cooke told &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; sportswriter Steve Springer that he remembered &quot;one official representing the commission laughing at him&quot; when Cooke said he would build in Inglewood. Cooke won the franchise, paying $2 million for the Los Angeles club, which he called the Kings. According to Springer, &quot;Cooke went to Inglewood and built the Forum. Goodbye, Lakers. Goodbye, Kings.&quot; The round, $16 million building was designed by Los Angeles architect Charles Luckman to be &quot;reminiscent of Roman coliseums.&quot; The arena seats 17,505 for basketball, 16,005 for hockey and up to 18,000 for musical concerts; although it has no luxury suites, it had 2,400 club seats for events. More than 70% of the seats are between the goals, and no seat is more than from the playing surface.

During the Cooke era, the Forum hosted five NBA Finals in its first six years (1967–73). The Boston Celtics celebrated both the and championships in the arena, the latter of which marked the final games Bill Russell ever played. The Lakers won the 1972 NBA Finals at the Forum in Game 5, while the New York Knicks&#x27; second and most recent championship was also clinched in a Game 5 at the same venue the following season.

Cream played two shows during the band&#x27;s farewell tour, on October 18–19, 1968, with Deep Purple as the opening act. The band&#x27;s show of October 19 produced the live tracks on their farewell LP, &quot;Goodbye&quot;. Deep Purple also recorded their part of the show, which was later released as a live album entitled &quot;Inglewood – Live in California&quot;. The Jimi Hendrix Experience performed at the Forum for the first time on April 26, 1969. A soundboard recording of this concert has been officially released: &quot;Los Angeles Forum: April 26, 1969&quot; (Live). Opening acts for this sold-out concert were Cat Mother and Chicago. The Experience later performed there again the following year on April 25, 1970, as part of their final U.S. tour. The concert has been widely circulated thanks to 3 available bootleg audience recordings. Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young recorded shows in June and July 1970, including at the Forum. Some of them ended up on their 1971 live album, &quot;4 Way Street&quot;. The Rolling Stones performed at the Forum during their 1969, 1972 and 1975 North American tours. Steppenwolf played there during their &quot;At Your Birthday Party&quot; tour on July 14, 1969, with Three Dog Night as the opening act. Three Dog Night recorded their set, which was later released as a live album entitled &quot;Captured Live at the Forum&quot;.

Queen played a total of 12 concerts from 1977 to 1982, including their final U.S. performance with Freddie Mercury on September 15, 1982. David Bowie played concerts here on April 3, 4, and 6, 1978. Chicago played two long sets in front of nearly 18,000 people as the headline act on April 24, 1971. This performance was two weeks after their historic week-long sellout at Carnegie Hall where they played eight shows in six days from April 5 to 10, 1971. The Grateful Dead performed at the Forum during their vaunted Spring 1977 tour, as well as three-night runs in February and December 1989. Between 1970 and 1977, Led Zeppelin performed 16 times at the Forum, including a run of six sold-out dates in 1977. Part of their live album, &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;, was recorded at the arena. The band&#x27;s first 1977 show is the source of the bootleg &quot;Listen to This Eddie&quot;. Another bootleg from the Forum shows, &quot;For Badgeholders Only&quot;, contains one of the last live performances by Keith Moon on drums, with his surprise performance there. The Jackson 5 performed numerous times at the Forum between 1970 and 1981. The 1970 show broke attendance records, with 18,675 paid admissions and a gross income of $105,000 (when the Jackson 5 had released two albums and three singles). By 1972, they had released seven albums on Motown, in addition to Michael and Jermaine Jackson&#x27;s solo albums. Both shows were recorded and released as &quot;Live at the Forum&quot;.

On November 14, 1970, Elvis Presley played afternoon and evening shows, with 18,700 and 18,698 paid admissions. He returned for two more sold-out shows on May 11, 1974, with 18,500 paid admissions each. The Osmonds performed two shows on December 4, 1971, which were recorded and released as &quot;The Osmonds Live&quot;. Barbra Streisand performed on April 15, 1972, during Four for McGovern, a fundraiser for George McGovern&#x27;s presidential campaign. Although ticket prices ranged from $5.50 to $100 and the event grossed $300,000, after expenses were deducted McGovern&#x27;s campaign received only $18,000. During her set, Streisand asked the audience to choose between &quot;Second Hand Rose&quot; and &quot;Stoney End&quot; for her next song; the latter was the overwhelming choice. Her performance was recorded and released as &quot;Live Concert at the Forum&quot;.

Bob Dylan&#x27;s live album &quot;Before the Flood&quot; with The Band was compiled from songs performed at the Forum over the course of three shows on February 13 and 14, 1974. The only song on the album not recorded at the Forum was &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;, which was recorded in New York City. Jethro Tull played five sold-out shows in a seven-day stretch in 1975, here at The Forum. The dates were February 3+4, 8–10.

Kiss had their debut there in 1976 on February 23 for two consecutive nights, three days after getting their footprints outside Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood and played three more consecutive nights shows the following year, 1977, on August 26–28 (the first of these shows sold out), with live tracks from these 1977 shows included on their second live album, &quot;Alive II&quot;, released in October of that same year. On June 21, 1976, Paul McCartney and Wings began a three-night stand at the Forum during their Wings Over the World tour. The shows were McCartney&#x27;s first live performances in Los Angeles since he played at the Hollywood Bowl in 1964 and 1965 with the Beatles. Some songs played at the Forum appeared on the &quot;Wings Over America&quot; live LP released later that year and re-released in 2013.

The Eagles performed three shows during their &quot;Hotel California&quot; tour on October 20–22, 1976. The shows were recorded, with some songs appearing on &quot;Eagles Live&quot;. The Bee Gees appeared at the Forum during their &quot;Children of the World&quot; tour on December 20, 1976; the show was recorded and released as &quot;Here at Last... Bee Gees... Live&quot;. Parliament-Funkadelic recorded half of their live album, &quot;&quot;, at the arena on January 19, 1977. Alice Cooper brought his big productions of &quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot;, &quot;Welcome To My Nightmare&quot; and &quot;Mad House Rock&quot; to the Forum.

The Los Angeles Strings of the World Team Tennis league played home matches at the Forum from 1975 to 1978, led on the court by Chris Evert. The team was owned by Los Angeles businessman Jerry Buss. The Forum hosted several boxing fights, most notably the second Muhammad Ali vs. Ken Norton on September 10, 1973. Several events featured Latin American fighters like José Nápoles, Chucho Castillo, Rubén Olivares, Carlos Zárate Serna and Alfonso Zamora. In 1979, Cooke sold the Forum, the Lakers and the Kings to Buss for a then-record $67.5 million.

=== 1980s ===

The Lakers were successful during the 1980s with their Showtime era, winning five NBA championships and making the NBA Finals every year except 1981 and 1986. They won the , and championships at the Forum. The Philadelphia 76ers and Detroit Pistons were the only visiting teams to win a championship at the Forum during this period; both teams clinched the title in a Game 4 sweep in and respectively. The Lakers&#x27; owner, Jerry Buss, also purchased the Los Angeles Strings expansion franchise of the second incarnation of TeamTennis (the original team and league having folded in 1978) and appointed his 19-year-old daughter Jeanie Buss as the tennis team&#x27;s general manager, with all home matches played at the Forum.

In 1981, Diana Ross filmed the concert portion of her &quot;Diana&quot; television special at the Forum, entering the arena through the audience and singing her 1980 Billboard top-five hit &quot;I&#x27;m Coming Out&quot;. Guests included Quincy Jones (who conducted a performance of &quot;Home&quot; from &quot;The Wiz&quot;) and Michael Jackson, who joined Ross onstage for a performance of her 1980 number-one song &quot;Upside Down&quot;. The special began with Ross in a photo session atop the Forum in a silver lamé bodysuit with large, silver-lamé wings. On December 10, 1981, Devo performed at the Forum during their New Traditionalists tour. In April 1982, the Forum was the site of the &quot;Miracle on Manchester&quot;, in which the Kings overcame a 5–0 deficit in a first-round Stanley Cup playoff game against the Edmonton Oilers to win 6–5 in overtime. With additional upset wins in Games 1 and 5 of the five-game series, the Kings eliminated the heavily favored Oilers to reach the second round.

In September 1982, on their Hot Space Tour, Queen played their final U.S. concert ever at the Forum. Fleetwood Mac played two shows during its &quot;Mirage&quot; tour on October 21–22, 1982, with Dave Mason opening. The shows, originally scheduled for October 4–5, were postponed when Stevie Nicks developed walking pneumonia. They were recorded for the band&#x27;s tour video, which was televised in 1983. In 1984, the Forum hosted the basketball tournaments and the men&#x27;s handball finals of the 1984 Summer Olympics. The arena hosted Amnesty International&#x27;s June 6, 1986 A Conspiracy of Hope benefit concert, headlined by U2 and Sting and featuring Bryan Adams, Jackson Browne, Peter Gabriel, Lou Reed, Joan Baez and the Neville Brothers.

Sting played the Dream of the Blue Turtles Tour on June 6, 1986, and the Nothing Like the Sun Tour on March 21 and 22, 1988. Genesis played five consecutive sold out concerts at the Forum from October 13 to 17, 1986, during the first leg of their Invisible Touch Tour. On September 30, 1987, former Pink Floyd member Roger Waters played the Forum on the US leg of his Radio K.A.O.S (tour). Iron Maiden performed on July 12, 1988. Rock bands AC/DC and Cinderella performed on November 13, 1988. Mexican boxer Julio César Chávez fought at the venue against Ruben Castillo in 1995, Vernon Buchanan in 1988 and Roger Mayweather in 1989. In 1989, Neil Diamond set the all-time attendance record at the Forum by surpassing his already leading record of seven sold-out shows (in 1983) with 10 sold-out shows. For doing so, Diamond was presented with a gold plaque, stating his accomplishment(s).

=== Great Western era ===

On December 5, 1988, it was announced that Jerry Buss sold the arena&#x27;s naming rights to Great Western Savings &amp; Loan, coinciding with the arrival in Los Angeles of hockey star Wayne Gretzky. The building exterior was repainted blue, replacing its original &quot;California sunset red.&quot; It was renamed the Great Western Forum; the name was retained for several years, even after Great Western was acquired by Washington Mutual (now Chase) and ceased to exist. Although naming-rights agreements are now commonplace in major American sports, they were rare at the time of Buss&#x27;s deal with Great Western. There was some initial criticism of the name change, and local residents continued to call the arena &quot;the Forum.&quot; Adverse reaction was eventually muted; Great Western Forum sounded like a natural name because of the arena&#x27;s location in the western United States.

=== 1990s ===
Before the 1991–92 NBA and NHL seasons, a new scoreboard was installed, replacing the one in use since the building opened in 1967. The original scoreboard, designed by All American Scoreboards in Pardeeville, Wisconsin, had a two-line message board on each side (the third electronic message board in the NHL, and the second in the NBA). The new scoreboard, designed by Daktronics, kept the two-line message boards and added a Sony Jumbotron scoreboard on each side.

The Forum hosted the 1991 NBA Finals and was the site of the Chicago Bulls&#x27; first NBA championship victory. It also hosted Games 3 and 4 of the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals between the Kings and Montreal Canadiens, the only time the Stanley Cup Finals was held at the arena. Coincidentally, Montreal&#x27;s home rink at the time was also called the Forum.

By the middle of the decade, the Great Western Forum was considered too small; it lacked luxury boxes and had insufficient retail and commercial space. Los Angeles officials, seeking to redevelop the city center, began planning a new downtown sports arena and entertainment complex and hoped to attract the Lakers and Kings from Inglewood.

The Kings&#x27; owners, who were real-estate developers, agreed to develop the complex; Buss agreed to move the Lakers into the new arena as co-tenants with the Kings and a third tenant, the NBA&#x27;s Clippers, who would move there from the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. The new Staples Center (now Crypto.com Arena) opened on October 17, 1999; as part of the deal, Buss sold the Great Western Forum to the L. A. Arena Company (which was controlled by the Kings&#x27; owners).

=== Final games ===
The Kings played their final regular season NHL game at the Forum, a 3–2 loss to the St. Louis Blues, on April 18, 1999. Coincidentally, Wayne Gretzky, who had previously played for both teams, played his final NHL game (as a member of the New York Rangers) on the same day. The Kings&#x27; final game at the Forum was an 8–1 preseason win over the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim on September 20, 1999. As the Staples Center had not yet opened, the Kings played their remaining preseason home games at the San Diego Sports Arena and the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. The Lakers&#x27; 118–107 playoff loss to the NBA champion San Antonio Spurs on May 23, 1999, was their last postseason game played at the Forum. The Lakers played two preseason games at the Forum before the 1999–2000 season before moving to the Staples Center.

=== 2000s ===
The Los Angeles Sparks played their 2000 season at the arena before following the Lakers and Clippers to Staples Center. The Great Western Forum hosted live events, offices and training facilities for the 2000–2001 Women of Wrestling season.

Faithful Central Bible Church, with a congregation of over 12,000, purchased the Great Western Forum at the end of 2000 and began holding church services there on Sunday mornings. Unlike Houston&#x27;s Lakewood Church, which converted the former Summit into their church, Faithful Central representatives said that they never intended to convert the arena for religious purposes; in 2009, the church discontinued their regular use of the Forum for services.

During the Faithful Central ownership, the arena was available for concerts, sporting events and other activities requiring a large venue. It was owned by the church&#x27;s for-profit entity, Forum Enterprises, which accommodated secular and pop-music artists. The church influenced the approval of performers, however; in 2005 and 2009 the Forum refused to allow performances by heavy metal band Lamb of God, whose former name was Burn the Priest.

On February 14, 2003, Phish began their first post-hiatus tour at the Forum. A fan jumped onstage during &quot;AC/DC Bag&quot;, and they performed a cover of Dr. Hook &amp; the Medicine Show&#x27;s &quot;The Cover of Rolling Stone&quot; after appearing on the magazine&#x27;s cover.

In 2003, Great Western&#x27;s naming-rights contract on the building expired (despite being bought by Washington Mutual in 1997, their name had been retained in the interim), and Forum Enterprises changed the venue&#x27;s name back to &quot;the Forum&quot;. The Great Western corporate logo and the words &quot;Great Western&quot; remained on portions of the exterior, including the roof (with a logo visible to planes landing at LAX), and were slowly removed over time. The roof, which was the last part of the building to contain the &quot;GW&quot; logo and &quot;Great Western Forum&quot; name, would not be repainted until the MSG remodeling, when it was overlaid with the new &quot;Forum Presented by Chase&quot; logo.

In 2004, Madonna premiered the Re-Invention World Tour at the Forum, which was filmed for the documentary &quot;I&#x27;m Going To Tell You A Secret&quot;.

The Forum was made available for film use, including interior shots for the 2002 film &quot;Like Mike&quot;. The Foo Fighters used the building as a setting for the music video for &quot;All My Life&quot; in 2003, featuring the building&#x27;s exterior in its opening and closing shots. In 2008, a scene for the 2009 film &quot;Hannah Montana: The Movie&quot; and the video for Weezer&#x27;s &quot;Troublemaker&quot; (from their 2008 &quot;Red Album&quot;) were filmed outside the Forum.

Iron Maiden appeared during their Somewhere Back in Time World Tour on February 19, 2008, with Lauren Harris their opening act. Their live version of &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; was included on the documentary &quot;Iron Maiden: Flight 666&quot;.

In May and June 2009, Michael Jackson rehearsed at the Forum for his This Is It concert series in London. After Jackson died on June 25, 2009, footage of these rehearsals and those at Staples Center became part of &quot;Michael Jackson&#x27;s This Is It&quot;.

On October 9, 2009, the Lakers returned to the Forum for a preseason game against the Golden State Warriors to celebrate the team&#x27;s 50th season in Los Angeles; the Lakers lost, 110–91.

=== 2010s: MSG era ===
In 2011, Prince began a 21-show run at the Forum. After acquiring the arena in June 2012, the Madison Square Garden Company announced plans for a $50 million renovation. The City of Inglewood made an $18 million commercial-rehabilitation loan, contingent on MSG&#x27;s $50 million investment. The arena was renamed &quot;The Forum, presented by Chase&quot; to reflect its sponsor, Chase Bank (which had incidentally purchased Great Western&#x27;s legal successor, Washington Mutual, a few years earlier), and its exterior returned to the original red. New features also included new lighting, new seating, LED video systems and HD screen and new retail.

On May 16, 2015, Gennady Golovkin defeated Willie Monroe Jr. during a live broadcast on HBO Boxing. Golovkin returned the following year on April 23, 2016, to battle Dominic Wade, which resulted in a second-round KO.

=== 2020s: Acquisition by Steve Ballmer ===

On March 24, 2020, Clippers owner Steve Ballmer announced that he had agreed to acquire the Forum from MSG for $400 million. The acquisition was needed in order to enable the construction of the Clippers&#x27; new Intuit Dome in Inglewood; the Clippers accused MSG of using litigation to block construction of the new arena, which they feared would cannibalize the Forum&#x27;s live events business.

The venue was closed from March 2020 to July 31, 2021, due to COVID-19. The Forum reopened on July 31, 2021, hosting Bellator 263. A concert by the Foo Fighters on July 17, 2021, was originally scheduled to be its first event, but it was postponed due to COVID-19 cases within the band&#x27;s staff.

<text>The Greensboro Complex, formerly known as the Greensboro Coliseum Complex, is an entertainment and sports complex located in Greensboro, North Carolina. Opened in 1959, the complex holds eight venues that includes an amphitheater, arena, aquatic center, banquet hall, convention center, museum, theatre, and an indoor pavilion. It is the home of the UNC Greensboro Spartans men&#x27;s basketball team, the Greensboro Swarm of the NBA G League, the Carolina Cobras of the National Arena League, the Greensboro Gargoyles of the ECHL, as well as the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) with their men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball tournaments.

It has hosted the Men&#x27;s ACC Tournament twenty-three times since 1967 and the Women&#x27;s ACC Tournament twelve times since 2000. Other notable sporting events include the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament Final Four in 1974 and the East Regionals in 1976, 1979, and 1998. More recently, the Coliseum has hosted the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in 2011, 2015, and 2020.

It is also the former home of several professional hockey teams including the Greensboro Generals and Greensboro Monarchs of the East Coast Hockey League (ECHL) and the National Hockey League&#x27;s Carolina Hurricanes.

The complex has hosted the &quot;Central Carolina Fair&quot; since 1999.

==History==

The complex was first proposed in 1944 by the city&#x27;s mayor. The idea was to create a war memorial to honor veterans of World War I and World War II. The building was approved by city officials in 1956, followed by a groundbreaking in January 1958. With its opening in 1959, the complex held four venues: War Memorial Auditorium, Town Hall Auditorium, The Blue Room and the Greensboro Coliseum. The complex opened on October 29, 1959, for historic show, &quot;Holiday on Ice&quot;. Shortly after its opening, the Coliseum began to scout for a hockey team. Partnering with the EHL, the city formed the &quot;Greensboro Generals&quot;. The team&#x27;s first match was November 11, 1959, against the Washington Presidents. The Generals won the game 4–1. The Generals would go on to win the EHL Championships.

Over the years, the complex hosted several conventions, sporting and musical events. The Coliseum was part-time home of the Carolina Cougars of the American Basketball Association from 1969 to 1974 after the Houston Mavericks moved to North Carolina in 1969. The Cougars were a &quot;regional franchise,&quot; playing &quot;home&quot; games in Charlotte (Bojangles&#x27; Coliseum), Greensboro (Greensboro Coliseum), Winston-Salem Memorial Coliseum and Raleigh (Dorton Arena and Reynolds Coliseum). Hall of Fame Coach Larry Brown began his coaching career with the Cougars in 1972. Billy Cunningham was the ABA MVP for the Cougars in the 1972–73 season. Despite a strong fan base the Cougars were sold and moved to St. Louis in 1974.

To meet demands, the Coliseum expanded its seating to 15,000 in 1972. Six years later, the complex expanded to include an exhibition center, known at the time as the Greensboro Coliseum Complex Exhibition Building (shortened to Exhibition Building). The building&#x27;s first event was &quot;Super Flea&quot;, a flea market for the Triad area. In 1991, the Coliseum&#x27;s manager (Jim Evans) proposed an additional expansion of the complex. This expansion would raise the seating capacity of the Coliseum an additional 8,000 (adding a third tier) to 23,000; however, this capacity would later be lowered to around 20,000 after renovations in the late 2010s. It would also see The Blue Room demolished to make way for a small arena in the Exhibition Hall (now called the Special Events Center).

The venue reopened on December 28, 1993, for the &quot;Reunion Classic&quot;, a men&#x27;s basketball game between the UCLA Bruins and NC State Wolfpack. This game was met with controversy as the Coliseum was not fully complete at the time of the game. City officials paid $200,000 to have firefighters on stand by during the game. The Coliseum and the newly expanded exhibition hall did not meet state and city building codes nor fire regulations, because of incomplete construction. Additionally, the Coliseum did not hold the permits to host the event. This decision resulted in city council firing both the Coliseum manager and its contractors, Huber, Hunt and Nichols, Inc. (known for the Spectrum Center, BB&amp;T Center and the PPG Paints Arena). It was later determined it would take an additional ten months to have the complex comply with regulations. The city added an additional $20 million to the budget to renovate the Coliseum and the auditorium.

Additional expansion came in 2003 when the complex added Novant Health Fieldhouse (formerly the GCC Pavilion). Two years later, the complex renovated the old Town Hall Auditorium into the smaller Odeon Theatre. In 2011, the complex added three additional venues: the White Oak Amphitheatre, the Greensboro Aquatic Center, and the ACC Hall of Champions. Since its opening, the complex has been visited by nearly 57 million people and hosts over 800 events per year. In September 2014, the War Memorial Auditorium closed its doors.

Oak View Group became the operator of the Complex on July 1, 2024, after winning a bid to take over management of the Complex from the City of Greensboro in early 2024. In October 2024, the City of Greensboro and Oak View Group made a 10-year naming rights deal with First Horizon Bank to rename the coliseum the First Horizon Coliseum. This deal does not affect the other venues at the complex.

==Facilities==
===First Horizon Coliseum===
One of the original four buildings of the complex, the Coliseum (also called Coliseum Arena) is one of the oldest buildings on the property. Construction began on the venue in 1958 and was completed in September 1959. Known originally as the &quot;Greensboro Memorial Coliseum&quot; (until 1980), the arena hosted its first event on October 29, 1959. At the time, the Coliseum held 7,100 seats, becoming one of the largest arenas on the East Coast.

Through the years, the Coliseum has hosted several sporting events, most notably basketball (see below). The Coliseum has also hosted concerts for over 40 years. During the 1960s and 1970s, the Coliseum was frequented by rock and R&amp;B performers. The first major concert held at the Coliseum was by The Monkees. Elvis Presley played a concert at the Coliseum on April 14, 1972; the footage was used for his final film, entitled &quot;Elvis on Tour&quot;. Presley performed the Coliseum again on April 21, 1977, one of the final venues of his tour, before his death on August 16. Casting Crowns recorded their live album, entitled &quot;Until the Whole World Hears... Live&quot;, at the Coliseum on April 24, 2010. Rock band Phish set the attendance record for a concert at the Coliseum on March 1, 2003, with 23,642 attendees.

The arena has also hosted WJMH&#x27;s SuperJam from 1997 to 2014. The music festival has featured prominent artists in the hip hop community including LL Cool J, Soulja Boy, Ludacris, Ja Rule, Plies, Nas, Lil Jon &amp; the East Side Boyz, Travis Porter and the Ying Yang Twins.

The Coliseum was also the site of auditions for &quot;American Idol&quot;, Season 5 on October 3, 2005. Between Sunday, July 8 and Tuesday, July 10, 2012, it played host to the Greensboro audition stages in the second season of the Fox singer search program &quot;The X Factor&quot;. In October 2024, the coliseum officially changed its name to the First Horizon Coliseum after a 10-year naming deal with First Horizon Bank.

===War Memorial Auditorium===
One of the original four buildings of the complex, the War Memorial Auditorium was one of the oldest buildings on the property, until it was closed in 2014. Along with the original concept, the venue opened in 1959 to house performing arts events. Playing predominantly to an African American audience, the auditorium became a notable venue on the Chitlin&#x27; Circuit. James Brown, Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin were among the many performers who played the auditorium during the 1960s. The Rolling Stones played the auditorium during the band&#x27;s 1965 North American Tour on November 12, 1965. The venue was primarily used for town meetings, theatrical events, religious meetings and concerts. Presidential candidate Barack Obama held a town hall meeting on March 26, 2008, to a full house. Guilford County native Fantasia Barrino gave her first concert, in her home state, during her Back to Me Tour on November 18, 2010.

The auditorium was torn down in October 2014, and the site was replaced with a premium parking lot. It&#x27;s replacement the Steven Tanger Center for the Performing Arts, opened in downtown in September 2021. A closing ceremony took place September 4. An O&#x27;Jays concert September 5 was the last event, and items from the auditorium were auctioned off the next week.

===Special Events Center===
Originally known as the &quot;Exhibition Building&quot;, the exhibition center opened in 1978. Its purpose was to host business conferences and conventions. The venue was primarily used by &quot;Super Flea&quot;, the flea market for the Triad area. In 1993, the center was expanded, converting the old Blue Room into a mid-sized arena known as &quot;Hall C&quot; or the &quot;East Wing&quot;. In its current state, the center &quot;includes three exhibition halls, a 4,500-seat mini-arena and eight meeting rooms...&quot; The arena is often used for musical performances during the Central Carolina Fair. It is also utilized by Greensboro College men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball home games. Other sporting events include boxing and UFC matches. The arena will often host concerts and comedy shows.

===Odeon Theatre===
Opening in 1958 as the &quot;Town Hall Auditorium&quot;, the Odeon Theatre is a small venue primarily used for community events. The original auditorium housed 1,000 seats. In 2004, the auditorium was converted to the smaller theatre and reopened in March 2005.

===White Oak Amphitheatre===
The newest addition to the complex, the White Oak Amphitheatre is the first outdoor venue for the Triad area. The venue was originally proposed in 2007 along with the aquatic center. The city purchased the nearby Canada Dry bottling plant to allow space for the amphitheatre. Construction began in 2010 and was completed in June 2011. The first concert for the venue was by The Beach Boys on June 5, 2011, to a crowd of 4,000 spectators. The amphitheatre is expected to operate from April to October, hosting community, comedy and musical events. The project cost $946,000 to construct.

While campaigning for the 2016 United States presidential election, Barack Obama held a rally here for Hillary Clinton on October 11, 2016, and Donald Trump held a rally on October 14, 2016.

===Novant Health Fieldhouse===
The Novant Health Fieldhouse is a standalone exhibition hall adjacent to the Special Events Center. The space opened in March 2003 as the &quot;GCC Pavilion&quot;. The project was designed by SKA Consulting Engineers. In 2016, the Novant Health Fieldhouse became the home of the Greensboro Swarm, the NBA Development League (later called the NBA G League) affiliate of the Charlotte Hornets. To accommodate the team, the Novant Health Fieldhouse was renovated with a permanent roof, locker room, and seating for 2,118. In December 2022, the Greensboro Swarm extended its lease with the Greensboro Coliseum Complex and entered into a naming rights partnership with Novant Health, with the official name of the venue changing to Novant Health Fieldhouse at the Greensboro Coliseum Complex.

===Greensboro Aquatic Center===
Another expansion project for the complex is the new aquatic center. The center features three main pools including a warm-up and training pool. The main pool is used for events by nearby high schools, colleges, and USA Swimming events, and can hold eight 50-meter (long course) lanes or 20 short course competition lanes plus a warmup pool. The complex also includes springboard and platform diving facilities and hosts meets for USA Diving. The facility has an available classroom and a 24&#x27;×19&#x27; video screen, as well as a concessions stand and swim store. The venue hosts events in competitive swimming and diving, synchronized swimming and water polo up through USA National competition levels. It also hosts the National Mermaid Convention . Paid parking is available. The project began in 2010 along with the amphitheatre and cost $18.8 million to build. The City of Greensboro provided a live cam feed to watch the progress of the construction. The venue has hosted the 2012 U.S. Masters Swimming Spring National Championship., the 2015 NCAA Women&#x27;s Division I Swimming and Diving Championships, and other tournaments as well.

===ACC Hall of Champions===
To commemorate its legacy with the ACC tournaments, the complex opened a museum in 2011 to show the history of the ACC. The venue celebrates the past, present and future of the ACC. It features numerous exhibits including an interactive broadcast booth, memorabilia, a video globe and school mascots.

===The Terrace===
Opened in March 2011, The Terrace is one of new expansions for the complex. Its main purpose is a banquet hall and will be used for speaking events as well as weddings. The Terrace is an indoor venue located in between the auditorium and Coliseum.

==Sports==
===Hockey===
The hockey history of Greensboro began in 1959, when the Greensboro Generals of the Eastern Hockey League arrived and competed until the league folded in 1973. The team moved to the Southern Hockey League for four seasons until it too ceased operations in January 1977.

Greensboro hockey&#x27;s modern era began with the establishment of the Greensboro Monarchs of the East Coast Hockey League, who played from 1989–90 to 1994–95. When the American Hockey League expanded southward in 1995, it invited Greensboro to join; the new team took the Monarchs nickname, but attempted to draw a more regional fan base by labeling themselves the Carolina Monarchs.

When the Hartford Whalers announced their move to Raleigh, North Carolina, in 1997 as the Carolina Hurricanes, they leased the Coliseum for two years while waiting for the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena (now Lenovo Center) in Raleigh to be completed. Subjected to ticket price increases and unwilling to support a team that was destined for Raleigh, Greensboro hockey fans rarely filled the arena for Hurricane games. Meanwhile, Triangle fans were unwilling to make the hour-long drive across Interstate 40 to Greensboro. As a result, the Hurricanes played in front of some of the smallest NHL crowds since the 1950s. During the 1998–99 season, the team curtained off most of the upper deck for home games in an effort to artificially create scarcity in the ticket market, force would-be attendees to purchase higher-priced tickets, and hide what national media mocked as &quot;green acres&quot; of empty seats.

Once the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena was completed and the Hurricanes moved out, the plan was that the Monarchs, who spent those two years in New Haven, Connecticut, as the Beast of New Haven, would move back into the venue as a Hurricanes affiliate. Monarchs owner Bill Black tried to bring the Monarchs back to Greensboro, but the Hurricanes refused to claim the Monarchs as their affiliate. After the deal fell through, Bill Black tried to sell shares to the public in a final attempt to bring the Monarchs back to Greensboro.

Rather than leave the Coliseum without a hockey team for the first time in more than 10 years, a new hockey team was founded, the Greensboro Generals, returning the city to the East Coast Hockey League. The Generals competed in the arena until 2004, when they were terminated by the ECHL due to poor performance and lackluster support from the community. Increased operating expenses from the ECHL Players Union and overhead costs as a result of recent Coliseum renovations significantly affected the Generals&#x27; ability to promote within the community. It was revealed that after the team folded, nearly all of the money used to support the team over and above ticket revenues, could have been covered by Coliseum advertising revenue that was purchased as a direct result of the hockey team&#x27;s presence.

After the Generals folded, the complex saw a significant revenue drop in local advertising and to this day, the Coliseum operations must be supplemented with nearly $2 million a year from the city government. 20 years later a new ECHL team was announced for Greensboro. The Greensboro Gargoyles will begin play for the 2025–26 season.

===Basketball===

The Carolina Cougars of the American Basketball Association played a majority of their home games at the Greensboro Coliseum during their tenure in North Carolina from 1969 to 1974, before moving to St. Louis and becoming the Spirits of St. Louis. The Greensboro City Gaters played their first and only season as a charter franchise of the Global Basketball Association minor league in 1991–1992 in the Greensboro Coliseum.

The Greensboro Coliseum has played host to many college basketball tournaments. The Atlantic Coast Conference has held their men&#x27;s basketball tournament at the Coliseum 26 times since 1967, the most of any venue. This is in part because the arena was within seven hours&#x27; drive of the conference&#x27;s original footprint, and is within an hour of most of the fanbases of the conference&#x27;s heartland in North Carolina. The most recent event was in 2023, and will return in 2027. The Greensboro Coliseum also hosted the Big Four Tournament from 1971 to 1981. It has also hosted the MEAC men&#x27;s basketball tournament ten times.

It has played host to 14 Men&#x27;s NCAA Tournaments, most notably the 1974 Final Four and Lehigh&#x27;s upset of Duke in 2012. It most recently hosted the NCAA Tournament in 2023, when it served as a first and second round site. It was the host of the Southern Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament from 1996 to 1999. The Coliseum has been the home for the ACC women&#x27;s basketball tournament since 2000, and is contracted through 2015. It hosted the Greensboro Regional in the Women&#x27;s NCAA tournament in 2007 and 2008. The Coliseum is the first arena to host three basketball tournaments in consecutive weeks. The Coliseum has also hosted NBA basketball, high school basketball, and the Harlem Globetrotters.

From 1959 to 1989, the Wake Forest Demon Deacons basketball team played a portion of its home schedule at the Coliseum, usually games against popular opponents that could not be accommodated in the smaller Winston-Salem Memorial Coliseum. In practice, Wake Forest played most of its ACC games during this period at the Coliseum. From the 1960s to the 1980s, North Carolina, Duke and North Carolina State frequently played neutral-site games at the Coliseum, as it was the state&#x27;s largest arena at the time. The Tar Heels still occasionally play a neutral-site game here, as late as 2012. Between its service as Wake Forest&#x27;s de facto primary home court and its many neutral-site and postseason games, the Coliseum has hosted many of the most important basketball games in North Carolina&#x27;s history.

Since 2010, the UNC Greensboro Spartans men&#x27;s basketball team has played at the Coliseum, having moved there from the smaller Fleming Gymnasium on the campus of UNCG. For Spartans games, most of the upper level is curtained off.

In October 2015, the Charlotte Hornets chose Greensboro for the location of their new NBA G League team the Greensboro Swarm. The Swarm began play at the Novant Health Fieldhouse in the 2016–17 season.

On October 6, 2016, the Hornets played a preseason game against the Boston Celtics at the Coliseum.

During the 2021–22 NBA G League season, the Coliseum served as one of the temporary home arenas for the Capitanes de Ciudad de México during their inaugural season at the NBA G League despite also being temporarily stationed at Fort Worth, Texas at the time due to the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Arena football===
The Coliseum first saw an arena football team when the Greensboro Prowlers of the af2 league played in the Coliseum from 1999 until 2004. The team folded due to a poor record and lack of fan support. The Greensboro Revolution of the National Indoor Football League played here in 2006 and 2007. The team ceased operations on January 23, 2008.

In 2018, the Coliseum began to host the Carolina Cobras, an expansion team of the National Arena League. The Cobras went on to win the league championship, going 10–5 in the regular season and winning their two playoff games, both hosted at the Coliseum. They defeated the Columbus Lions with a final score of 66–8. The team is still in operation today and has played for the championship in 4 of the last 5 seasons.

==Other events==

The Coliseum has hosted many events over time, including Monster Jam, Arenacross, the PBR, High School Musical: The Concert, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, and large-scale religious gatherings.

Former North Carolina senator Kay Hagan held her Senate Victory Party at the Special Events Center on November 4, 2008. The Greensboro Coliseum has also hosted the National Figure Skating Championships twice.

In addition, its neighboring auditorium and special events center have hosted concerts, trade shows, broadway theatre shows, and similar events. The auditorium, which was not included in the 1993 renovation of the complex, will soon be renovated to include a banquet hall. In 2002, the 1st Annual King of the Concrete indoor go-kart race was held at this facility. In February 2016, The Coliseum hosted the 2016 US Olympic Table Tennis Trials.

In 2016, the arena hosted the Kellogg&#x27;s Tour of Gymnastics Champions.

Greensboro Coliseum has had a wide history with hosting professional wrestling going back to the territorial days of Jim Crockett Promotions. It has hosted a number of NWA and WCW events through the years, including the first four Starrcade events in 1983, 1984, 1985, and 1986, Clash of the Champions I in 1988, as well as the 1990 WrestleWar event. WWE has also held events at the Greensboro Coliseum, including in 1998, the 1999 King of the Ring and the 2001 Survivor Series when Team WWF defeated Team Alliance and the Alliance was forced to disband. Most recently WWE revived the Starrcade event and held it at the Coliseum on November 25, 2017.

On March 3, 2024, All Elite Wrestling (AEW) held Revolution at the Coliseum. Sting wrestled his retirement match at this event where he and Darby Allin retained the AEW World Tag Team Championships. It was also the first wrestling pay-per-view at the Coliseum in over 20 years.

<doc id="765860" wikidata="Q3735235" url="?curid=765860" title="Menninger Foundation">
<text>The Menninger Foundation was founded in 1919 by the Menninger family in Topeka, Kansas. The Menninger Foundation, known locally as Menninger&#x27;s, consists of a clinic, a sanatorium, and a school of psychiatry, all of which bear the Menninger name. Menninger&#x27;s consisted of a campus at 5800 S.W. 6th Avenue in Topeka, Kansas which included a pool as well as the other aforementioned buildings. In 2003, the Menninger Clinic moved to Houston. The foundation was started in 1919 by Dr. Charles F. Menninger and his sons, Drs. Karl and William Menninger. It represented the first group psychiatry practice. &quot;We had a vision,&quot; Dr. C. F. Menninger said, &quot;of a better kind of medicine and a better kind of world.&quot;

==History==

The Menninger Clinic, also known as the C. F. Menninger Memorial Hospital, was founded in the 1920s in Topeka, Kansas. The Menninger Sanitarium was founded in 1925. The Menninger Clinic established the Southard School for children in 1926. The school fostered treatment programs for children and adolescents that were recognized worldwide. In the 1930s the Menningers expanded training programs for psychiatrists, psychologists, and other mental health professionals.

The Menninger Foundation was established in 1941. The Menninger School of Psychiatry was established in 1946. It quickly became the largest training center in the country, driven by the country&#x27;s demand for psychiatrists to treat military veterans.

Menninger announced its affiliation with Baylor College of Medicine and The Methodist Hospital in December 2002. The concept was that Menninger would perform treatment while Baylor would oversee research and education.

===Moves===
The Menninger Clinic moved in June 2003 from Topeka, Kansas to Houston, Texas. The Menninger Clinic again moved to its new location at 12301 S. Main St., Houston, Texas, 77035 in May 2012.

===Current facilities===
As of May 2012, The Menninger Clinic offers: Adolescent Treatment Program, a Professionals Program, the Compass Program for Young Adults, the Comprehensive Psychiatric Assessment &amp; Stabilization Program, an Assessments Service and the Hope Program for Adults.

==Revolution in psychiatric education==
The Menninger School of Psychiatry and the local Veterans Administration Hospital represented the center of a psychiatric education revolution. The Clinic and the School became the hub for training professionals in the bio-psycho-social approach. This approach integrated the foundations of medical, psychodynamic, developmental, and family systems to focus on the overall health of patients. For patients, this way of treatment attended to their physical, emotional, and social needs.

Dr. Otto Fleischmann, head of the psychoanalytic institute from 1956 to 1963, was doing psychotherapy behind a one-way vision screen, in full view of all the students.

In 1960 Otto Kernberg joined the Clinic and later became its director until 1965.

===Karl Menninger===

Dr. Karl Menninger&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Human Mind&quot; (1930), became a bestseller and familiarized the American public with human behavior. Many Americans also read his subsequent books, including &quot;The Vital Balance&quot;, &quot;Man Against Himself&quot; and &quot;Love Against Hate&quot;.

===Will Menninger===

Dr. Will Menninger made a major contribution to the field of psychiatry when he developed a system of hospital treatment known as milieu therapy. This approach involved a patient&#x27;s total environment in treatment. Dr. Menninger served as Chief of the Army Medical Corps&#x27; Psychiatric Division during World War II. Under his leadership, the Army reduced losses in personnel due to psychological impairment. In 1945, the Army promoted Dr. Menninger to brigadier general. After the war, Dr. Menninger led a national revolution to reform state sanitariums. In 1948, &quot;Time&quot; magazine featured Dr. Menninger on its cover, lauding him as &quot;psychiatry’s U.S. sales manager.&quot;

==Activities==
At the Menninger Clinic, staff proceeded to launch new treatment approaches and open specialty programs. The Menninger Foundation gained a reputation for intensive, individualized treatment, particularly for patients with complex or long-standing symptoms. The treatment approach was multidimensional, addressing a patient&#x27;s medical, psychological, and social needs. Numerous independent organizations recognized the Menninger Foundation as a world leader in psychiatric and behavioral health treatment. 

In 2020, &quot;US News &amp; World Report&quot; listed Houston’s Menninger Clinic #5 in Psychiatry on their annual list of best hospitals. 

The Menninger Clinic remains one of the primary North American settings supporting psychodynamically informed research on clinical diagnosis, assessment, and treatment. It has organized efforts around the construct of mentalizing, a concept integrating research activities related to attachment, theory of mind, internal representations, and neuroscience.

In the 1960s the Menninger Clinic studied Swami Rama, a noted yogi, specifically investigating his ability to exercise voluntary control of bodily processes (such as heartbeat) which are normally considered non-voluntary (autonomous) as well as Yoga Nidra. It was part of Gardner Murphy&#x27;s research program into creativity and the paranormal, funded by Ittleson Family Foundation.

<doc id="765883" wikidata="Q204436" url="?curid=765883" title="Sorcerous Stabber Orphen">
<text>is a Japanese light novel series written by Yoshinobu Akita. It was adapted into manga, two anime television series and a .

As of December 2019, the novels had over 14 million copies in circulation.

==Plot==

The young man Orphen engages in money lending activities in the back streets of the commercial city of Totokanta. Once, he was known as one of the Tower of Fang&#x27;s most promising black sorcerers. One day, Orphen was approached by Volkan and Dortin, who had a very profitable money-making scheme set up. Under the guise of wealthy merchants, they set forth toward the Everlasting household to partake in a marriage fraud. But, there was one problem: Volkan&#x27;s plan was full of holes, leading one of the sisters to find out about their plan too. Then suddenly, a huge monster attacks the mansion. Among all the commotion, one name rings out: Azalie. This monster was what he was looking for for five years: his older sister Azalie who transformed into a dragonic monster. Between those who seek to kill the monster and Orphen, giving everything to protect it, his peaceful days are at an end. Trying desperately to transform his sister, Azalie, back to her true form leads to a treacherous journey that, ultimately, allows Orphen to learn the vast secrets of his world.

==Media==
===Light novels===
After publishing an award-winning Japanese-style fantasy novel &quot;Inside a Sparkle from the Snow&quot; Yoshinobu Akita, who possessed deep admiration for European and American literature, started his work on a European-style fantasy about the magically created world of Orphen inhabited by characters with deep personalities that make a reader empathize with them.

The series &quot;Orphen&quot; came about when author Akita, with Yuuya Kusaka as illustrator, created a series of light novels called &quot;Sorcerous Stabber Orphen: The Wayward Journey&quot;. It consists of 20 novels which were first published by Fujimi Shobo under their Fujimi Fantasia Bunko label in the &quot;Monthly Dragon Magazine&quot; between 1994 and 2003, and was the basis for the first anime and manga series. In November 2019, a light novel known as the &quot;Sorcerous Stabber Orphen Anthology&quot; was also released. It features a collection of original stories written by Akita, as well as guest writers such as Hajime Kanzaka, Yutaka Kono, Koushi Tachibana, Miya Kazuki, and Yomi Hirasaka. Ryo Mizuno was in charge of commentary while the illustrations and cover were drawn by Kusaka.

Two years after the beginning of the main novel series, Yoshinobu Akita created a second series called &quot;Sorcerous Stabber Orphen: The Reckless Journey&quot;, which is a collection of side-stories that depicted more light-hearted and comedic adventures that took place during Orphen&#x27;s journey, and chronologically set before the events of the main series. The novel series spanned 13 volumes between 1996 and 2003, which were published the same way as the first series. In 2009, he published an additional chapter for the novel on Akita Yoshinobu&#x27;s Sadami BOX, the author&#x27;s personal website. In 1997, he released &quot;Sorcerous Stabber Orphen: Detour&quot;, a short light novel series that consisted of side stories that took place during the first half of Orphen&#x27;s journey with Claiomh and Majic. The novels spanned two volumes.

In September 2011, T.O Entertainment released a brand new series of the &quot;Orphen&quot; novels known as &quot;Sorcerous Stabber Orphen: New Wayward Journey&quot;, which takes place more than two decades after the original series. Orphen is now older and is married to Claiomh Everlasting, both of whom give birth to three daughters that become Sorcerers. Majic is a Sorcerer lecturer at the new school that Orphen runs. Orphen is known as the &quot;Demon King&quot; due to his exploits in the original novels. The main protagonist of the new series is Mayor MacCredy, who is the son of Leticia MacCredy and Forte Puckingham. The novel series originally spanned into 10 volumes between 2011 and 2015. In September 2019, Yoshinobu Akita announced that in commemoration of the series&#x27; 25th anniversary, he would be writing a new novel for the main novella series titled &quot;Sorcerer Stabber Orphen: Comicron&#x27;s Plan&quot;, a prequel that takes place four years after Orphen departed the Tower of Fangs to search for Azalie, which was released on December 25, 2019. It is tentatively referred to as the &quot;Gap Edition&quot; in the author&#x27;s afterword which will fill in gaps within the main series&#x27; timeline with new stories, with three new volumes currently being planned. The books are published in a standard version and also a special edition version which comes with a behind the scenes booklet about the book and a Drama CD which is based on the new novel series itself. The original &quot;Orphen&quot; novel series received a reprint as well.

The &quot;Slayers vs Orphen&quot; novel was a special collaborative novel between Yoshinobu Akita and Hajime Kanzaka and was published in 2005. It was later reprinted in 2013.

During their panel at Anime Expo 2018, J-Novel Club announced that they had licensed the light novels.

===Manga===
The manga adaptation was created by writer Yoshinobu Akita and artist Hajime Sawada. The manga is split into two separate series: &quot;Majutsushi Orphen Haguretabi&quot;, which is six volumes long, and the two volume side story known as &quot;Majutsushi Orphen MAX&quot;. The first volume of the manga series was released in English in March 2005 by ADV Manga.

A doujinshi collection was released called &quot;Sorcerous Stabber Orphen Special Parody&quot; (&quot;Majutsushi O-fuen Haguretabi Spesharu Paarodi&quot;).

A new manga adaptation based on the main novels (the &quot;Stray Journey&quot; arc) was created and released by Yoshinobu Akita and illustrator Muraji from March 2017 to November 2018 and collected in five volumes. In July 2018, Seven Seas Entertainment announced their acquisition of the manga&#x27;s license for English distribution. They released the first two volumes in 2019.

In August 2018, a manga adaptation based on the light novel spin-off series, &quot;Sorcerous Stabber Orphen: The Reckless Journey&quot; (&quot;Majutsushi Orphen: Mubouhen&quot;), was released. It is written and illustrated by Yu Yagami (The author of &quot;Those Who Hunt Elves&quot;).

<text>The setter is a type of gundog used most often for hunting game such as quail, pheasant, and grouse.

In the UK, the four setter breeds, together with the pointers, usually form a subgroup within the gundog group as they share a common function. However, the setter breeds each have subtle differences in head, bone and substance.

The American and Canadian Kennel Clubs classify these breeds within the Sporting Group. Setters from show lines are usually considered to be heavier and larger than those from &#x27;working&#x27; lines.

== Function ==
A setter silently searches for game by scent; hunting is done systematically and methodically. When prey is encountered, the dog becomes motionless rather than chasing after the game. Setters get their name from their distinctive stance; a sort of crouch or &quot;set&quot; upon finding their quarry. Once the dog has indicated where the birds are by freezing on point, the birds are then flushed so the following guns can get a shot. In earlier times before guns were used, a net would be used to trap the birds.

The scent of game birds is airborne, so to sense it, the setter carries its head high and should never follow foot scent. Most setters are born with a natural proclivity to hunting. Dogs which show excitement and interest in birds are described as being &quot;birdy&quot;, and trainers look for puppies that show this particular trait. Training is usually done with quail as a first choice or domesticated pigeons.

== Attributes ==
This group of dogs combines beauty, brains and bird sense; the early setter breeds are believed to have been developed as far back as the 15th century in the UK. The ancestors of modern setters probably originated in Spain and were bred from spaniel stock. Later, these dogs were exported to France and England where the breeds were developed into today&#x27;s varieties.

They are fast, stylish game-finding dogs with a unique history and evolution for the single purpose of finding game birds. Writing in 1576 Dr Johannes Caius states &quot;There is also at this date among us a new kind of dogge brought out of Fraunce, and they bee speckled all over with white and black, which mingled colours incline to a marble blewe&quot;. Argue speculates this may be a description of the blue belton colour found in English setters.

== Early shows and field trials ==
The first official dog show held in the UK was at Newcastle-on-Tyne in June 1859 and entry was restricted to setters and pointers. There were 36 setters and 23 pointers entered. The show was organised by John Shorthose and William Pape. Mr Jobling&#x27;s Black and Tan Setter, Dandy, won the first prize for setters. The class for pointers was judged by Mr Jobling who awarded the prize to a pointer owned by a Mr Brailsford, who helped judge the setters. This raised some criticism.

The prize awarded to each winner was a double barrelled gun worth around £15 to £20.

There was uncertainty as to how setters would be classified at early shows. Three classes were usually scheduled in 1862 dividing setters into three categories: English, Black/Tan and Irish. These became official breed classifications when The Kennel Club was founded in 1873.

During 1806 in the UK there was a sale of setters. A black setter bitch called Peg was sold for 41 guineas while the price for setter dogs called Punch, Brush, Bob, Bell, Bounce and Sam varied from 17 to 32 guineas each. No colours were specified for the dogs.

The first recorded field trial in the UK was held in April 1865 on the estate of Samuel Whitbread (MP) at Southill, Bedfordshire. It was only open to setters and pointers. All the setters entered were black and tans (Gordons).

In 1879, the Western Hemisphere held its first recorded show. This was also restricted to setters and pointers. It was four years after this that the first American Field trial was held.

== More recent competitions ==
The Kennel Club has four champion titles available to be achieved by setters competing in the UK. These are:
* Show Champion (Sh Ch), awarded to dogs who have won three Challenge Certificates (CCs) under three different judges with at least one CC won after 12 months of age
* Champion (Ch), gained by dogs which have won a Sh Ch title plus a field trial award, Diploma of Merit or a Show Gundog Working Certificate
* Field Trial Champion (Ft Ch), dogs which won a pointer or setter open stake or two first prizes at two different stakes under two different A Panel judges; there must be no less than 16 runners entered.
* Dual Champion, the highest award available to setters, a dog which has achieved the titles of Show Champion and Field Trial Champion.

Challenge Certificates were first introduced by the Kennel Club in December 1900. Prior to 1958, a gundog could not claim to be a champion no matter how many CCs it won until it had gained a qualifier in the field as well. When the Show Champion title was instigated in 1958, it was agreed this could be applied retroactively.

The first ever gundog to attain the title was an English Setter. Since the Second World War only two dogs have achieved Dual Champion status in the UK. The first was a Pointer and the second was a Gordon Setter, the only Gordon to ever achieve this accolade.

Setters have been Best in Show at Crufts seven times. The award was secured by Irish Setters in 1981, 1993, 1995 and 1999. English Setters were best in show in 1964, 1977 and 1988. The Irish Setter Best in Show of 1981 was already a Field Trial Champion, proving that she had brains as well as beauty.

At the Westminster show in America an English Setter won the Best in Show title in 1938. He was only 11 months old and at his very first show. This was before entry to the show was restricted to Champions in 1992. He is the only setter to achieve Best in Show at Westminster.

== Registrations ==
In January 2006, the Kennel Club identified a number of British native breeds registering 300 or fewer puppies each year; it labelled these breeds as &#x27;Vulnerable Native Breeds&#x27;. Initially, the list included the Irish Red and White Setter and the Gordon Setter but Gordons were re-classified as viable in January 2007 after consultation with the breed clubs. English Setters were added for the first time in 2012.

To give an indication of how the UK registrations have changed, English Setter registrations were 568 in 2002, Gordons were 250 and Irish Red and Whites were 99, but Irish registrations totalled 1,225. However, by 2011 the figures for English Setters dropped to 234 puppy registrations; Gordons had a slight increase to 306; Irish Red and Whites had a slight drop to 83; and Irish decreased to 869 puppy registrations.

In contrast, in a comment about registration figures and popular breed rankings, the American Kennel Club stated that 2011 was the &quot;year of the setters, with all four making big jumps over the past year&quot;. English Setters had ranked at 101 in 2010 but moved up to 87 in 2011; Irish had shifted from ranking at 77 in 2010 to 70 in 2011; Irish Red and Whites went up three places having been 150 in 2010 and 147 in 2011; and Gordons improved its 2010 position of 98 to be ranked at 94.

On January 1, 2009, the Irish Red and White Setter became eligible for American Kennel Club registration and was thereafter able to compete in the Sporting Group at its shows.

== Coat ==
Most setter breeds have long smooth, silky coats that require maintenance. While Gordon, Irish and English Setters usually undergo some trimming for presentation in the show ring, Irish Red and White Setters do not require as much work, because they have lighter coats.

== Temperament ==
Setters have a tendency to be happy, playful dogs and are usually very friendly both to people and other dogs. They have a great deal of energy and require daily exercise.

== Setter breeds ==
The breeds making up this subgroup are:
*English Setter
*Gordon Setter
*Irish Setter (a.k.a. Irish Red Setter)
*Irish Red and White Setter

<text>Harvard Stadium is a U-shaped college football stadium in the Allston neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. The Stadium is one of only four athletic facilities that are considered National Historic Landmarks. The stadium is owned and operated by Harvard University and is home to the Harvard Crimson football program. In its current form, Harvard Stadium seats just over 25,000 spectators.

Built in 1903, it was a pioneering execution of reinforced concrete in the construction of large structures. Because of its early importance in these areas, and its influence on the design of later stadiums, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987. The stadium is the nation&#x27;s oldest permanent concrete structure dedicated to intercollegiate athletics. It seated up to 57,166 in the past, as permanent steel stands (completing a stadium shape) were installed in the stadium&#x27;s northeast end zone in 1929. They were torn down after the 1951 season, due to deterioration and reduced attendance. Afterward, there were smaller temporary steel bleachers across the stadium&#x27;s open end until the building of the Murr Center (which is topped by the new scoreboard) in 1998.

Harvard Stadium hosted one Boston Patriots season in 1970. It was their first season in the NFL after the AFL–NFL merger and their last before becoming the New England Patriots. The team moved to Schaefer Stadium in Foxborough the following season.

==History==

Harvard Stadium was constructed on of land known as Soldiers Field, donated to Harvard University by Henry Lee Higginson in 1890 as a memorial to Harvard men who had died in the Civil War The structure, similar in shape to the Panathenaic Stadium, was completed in just months, costing $310,000. Much of the funds raised came from a 25th reunion gift by Harvard&#x27;s Class of 1879. It is the home of Harvard&#x27;s football team. The stadium also hosted the Crimson track and field teams until 1984 and was the home of the Boston Patriots during the 1970 season, until Schaefer Stadium opened the following year to fulfill post-AFL–NFL merger minimum seating requirements requiring a 50,000+ seat venue. Harvard Stadium was the largest concrete stadium in the nation until the construction of Syracuse University&#x27;s Archbold Stadium in 1907.

Lewis Jerome Johnson, professor of civil engineering at Harvard, was a consultant to the design team for the stadium. It is historically significant that this stadium represents the first vertical concrete structure to employ reinforced structural concrete. Prior to the erection of the stadium in 1902, reinforced structural concrete was used in horizontal, that is flooring, sidewalks, etc., design only. Johnson was the engineer of note responsible for incorporating the concept into the vertical structure of the stadium design. There is a plaque dedicating the stadium to his honor on the east end wall outside the stadium.

Harvard installed both FieldTurf and lights in 2006. In 2007, Harvard played its first night game at the stadium, winning 24–17 over Brown University on September 22.

===Influence on American football===
In the early 20th century, American football was an extremely violent sport; 18 players died and 159 were seriously injured in 1905 alone. There was a widespread movement to outlaw the game but U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt intervened and demanded the rules of the game be reformed. In 1906, Roosevelt met with representatives from 62 colleges and universities and formed the Intercollegiate Football Conference, the predecessor of the NCAA. The committee&#x27;s purpose was to develop a uniform set of rules and regulations to make the game safer. A leading proposal, at the time, was widening the field to allow more running room and reduce serious collisions. While it was popular among committee members, Harvard objected. Their recently completed stadium could not accommodate a larger field. Because of the permanent nature of Harvard Stadium, the proposal was rejected and the forward pass was legalized in April 1906. Harvard Stadium led to the creation of two of the most fundamental aspects of modern American football: standard field dimensions and the legal forward pass.

===Other events===
Early in its existence two ice rinks were built on the stadium during the winter months for the men&#x27;s ice hockey team. The Stadium served as the home for the hockey team until World War I.

Harvard Stadium was the site of the U.S. Olympic Trials for men&#x27;s track and field in 1912, 1920, 1924, and 1928.

It is also the host of music festivals like the Amandla Festival, where Jamaican reggae legend Bob Marley performed a historic concert in 1979. Janis Joplin performed her last show at the stadium in 1970, shortly before her death. Other concerts included those by Miles Davis, Ray Charles, Van Morrison, The Band, B.B. King, Ike &amp; Tina Turner, James Taylor, Joan Baez, Sly and the Family Stone, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, The Supremes, Mountain, Ten Years After and Johnny Mathis. During the 1984 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles, the stadium hosted several soccer preliminaries. In 2007, the Boston Cannons, a professional lacrosse team for Major League Lacrosse, moved their home site to the stadium. They previously played at Boston University&#x27;s Nickerson Field. They have since moved to Quincy, Massachusetts.

Harvard installed FieldTurf and lights in 2006.

Beginning on April 11, 2009, Harvard Stadium became the home field of the Boston Breakers of the Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer (WPS) league when they beat Saint Louis Athletica 2–0.

==Location==

Although most of Harvard&#x27;s campus is in Cambridge, the stadium and most other intercollegiate athletic facilities, along with Harvard Business School, lie to the south, across the Charles River, in the nearby Allston neighborhood of Boston. Several donations of land from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, his family, and friends beginning in 1870 on the Brighton/Allston side of the Charles River through to an 1890&#x27;s gift from Henry Lee Higginson, which gave the tract the name &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Field&quot;, determined the location of the athletics complex.

The stadium is the most iconic piece of the Soldiers Field athletic complex, which also includes the baseball stadium, outdoor track, an artificial turf field hockey/lacrosse field, two soccer stadiums including Jordan Field, pools, Beren Tennis Center (outdoor), the Gordon Indoor Track, Dillon Fieldhouse, Lavietes Pavilion, and Bright Hockey Center. Newell Boathouse, home of Harvard&#x27;s men&#x27;s crew, lies across Soldiers Field Road on the banks of the Charles. The stadium&#x27;s horseshoe opens to the northeast, towards the river, and the press box is at the top of the northwest sideline&#x27;s grandstand.

The running track has been removed; it was non-standard, with long straights and tight turns, and the outside lanes were very near the stadium walls.

<text>The term &quot;Year One&quot; in political history usually refers to the institution of radical, revolutionary change. This usage dates from the time of the French Revolution. After the official abolition of the French monarchy on 21 September 1792, the National Convention instituted the new French Revolutionary Calendar. It declared the day after abolition – 22 September, redesignated as 1 Vendémiaire – to be the first day of the Republic and the beginning of Year I. The Maoist dictator Pol Pot (&quot;Saloth Sâr&quot;) was educated in Paris, France to join the French Communist Party as a student which was inspired by the French Revolutionary Calendar of Year One as well as the works of Robespierre and the Reign of Terror. The Cambodian Civil War had led the various campaigns of Operation Menu, Chenla Two and the Fall of Phnom Penh which declared the new revolutionary calendar as Year Zero on 17 April 1975, which the Queen Sisowath Kossamak fled to Beijing and Lon Nol heading to exile in Hawaii and then California. On 5 January 1976, Pol Pot who became (&quot;Brother Number One&quot;) renamed the country from the Khmer Republic to Democratic Kampuchea established by Angkar.

<text>The Siletz (pronounced SIGH-lets) were the southernmost of several divisions of the Tillamook people speaking a distinct dialect; the other dialect-divisions were: Salmon River on the Salmon River, Nestucca on Little Nestucca River, Nestucca River and Nestucca Bay, Tillamook Bay on the Tillamook Bay and the mouths of the Kilchis, Wilson, Trask and Tillamook rivers, and Nehalem on Nehalem River. The name &quot;Siletz&quot; comes from the name of the Siletz River on which they live. The origin of the name is unknown (perhaps Oregon Athabaskan? variants: Salǽˑtʃʼɪtʃʽ, Sai-lĕtc-́ĭc qûn-nĕ, and Sii-lee-ch&#x27;ish) 

Their eastern neighbors the Central Kalapuya tribes called them Tsä Shnádsh amím.

In Chasta Costa and Euchre Creek-Tututni and Chetco-Tolowa they were known as Shii-lee-ch&#x27;ish, the Naltunne-Tututni name was Sai-lĕtc-́ĭc me-́t̟ûn-nĕ (all with reference to the Siletz River) and the Upper Coquille-Tututni name ʃɪllǽˑttʃʼɪʃmæ̽-dɜnhæ or Sii-lee-ch&#x27;ish- dv-ne (&quot;Siletz River People&quot;).

Today they are a constituent band of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, and the group from which the confederation received its name. In 1856 following the Rogue River Wars in southern Oregon, people from among more than 27 Native Tribes and Bands, speaking 10 distinct languages: Alsea/Yaquina, chinuk wawa (also known as Chinook Jargon), Coos, Kalapuya, Molala, Shasta, Siuslaw/Lower Umpqua, Takelma, Tillamook, and a broad group of Athapascans speaking groups of SW Oregon, including Upper Umpqua, Coquille, Tututni, Chetco, Tolowa, Galice and Applegate River peoples who by treaty agreements and force were removed by the United States to the Coast Indian Reservation, later known as the Siletz Reservation.

Over generations the Siletz people have faced brutal federal policies which resulted their 1.1 million acre reservation being illegally taken from them. Congress passed the Western Oregon Termination Act, ending the government to government relationship with the Siletz Tribes. The Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians was successful in lobbying Congress to repeal the Termination Act as applied to the Siletz and again was federally recognized as of November 18, 1977. Today their members are enrolled in the federally recognized tribe of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians.

The only native language still spoken on the reservation is Siletz Dee-ni, which is a combination of all Athbaskan dialectic variant vocabularies spoken by several of the original reservation tribes. In cooperation with the National Geographic Society and the Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages, the tribe produced a &quot;talking dictionary&quot; of Siletz Dee-ni in 2007 to aid in preservation and teaching.

==History==
Traditionally, the Siletz were believed to be a Salishan-speaking group; they inhabited an area along the central coast of Oregon near the Siletz River until the middle of the 19th century. The tribe was considered the southernmost group of the larger Coast Salish culture, which was centered near the Strait of Georgia and Puget Sound in what are now British Columbia, Canada, and Washington, United States.

The Siletz were closely related in language and culture to the Tillamook tribe to their north along the Oregon Coast. During or after the Rogue River Wars of 1855–1856, which extended to areas of northern California, members of the tribe were moved by the United States government to the Coast Indian Reservation, later called the Siletz Reservation.

The Tillamook and peoples of more than 20 other small tribes, including the Tolowa people of northern California, were also removed to the reservation. It is located along the Siletz River in the Central Oregon Coast Range, 15 miles northeast of Newport, which is on the coast in Lincoln County.

==Population==

==Language==
The Siletz are believed to have spoken the &quot;Siletz dialect&quot; or &quot;Southern Tillamook&quot; of the Tillamook (Hutyéyu) language, which was part of the Coast Salish languages. Tillamook was declared extinct when its last native speaker died in 1970.

What is now known as the Siletz Dee-ni language was restricted historically to speakers in &quot;a small area on the central Oregon coast.&quot; Linguists have concluded that Siletz is not related to Tillamook at all, but is a form of Tolowa, an Athabaskan language rather than a Salishan language. The Tolowa people were one of the 20 Native American groups whose descendants comprise the Confederated Tribes of Siletz.

In the 21st century, Siletz Dee-ni was the only native language still spoken on the reservation. Realizing that their language was endangered, the Consolidated Siletz tribe have taken actions to preserve and teach it. Also called Tolowa Dee-ni, the language has been studied by several groups. Members of the tribe have worked with a variety of linguists to document the language. Their work is &quot;a comprehensive attempt to include the similarities and the differences of the known dialects of the Southwest Oregon / Northwestern California Athabaskan Language.&quot;

The Siletz have taken part in an international effort by the National Geographic Society, the Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages, and linguists such as K. David Harrison of Swarthmore College to save languages that are threatened with extinction. Alfred &quot;Bud&quot; Lane, among the last fluent native speakers of Siletz on the reservation, has recorded 14,000 words of the Siletz Dee-ni language. Lane and other Siletz had decided they wanted to work to preserve and revive the language.

Lane&#x27;s work was used to help produce a Siletz talking dictionary, one of eight dictionaries produced for endangered languages in this project, as reported at the annual meeting in 2012 of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). The bilingual dictionary, in English and Siletz Dee-ni, with illustrations, will be used to teach the dialect to tribal members in the Siletz Valley. Such digital tools and social media can help small groups communicate. Professor Harrison said, &quot;a positive effect of globalisation is that you can have a language that is spoken by only five or 50 people in one remote location, and now through digital technology that language can achieve a global voice and a global audience.&quot;

<text>Alphonse Joseph Georges (; 15 August 1875 – 24 April 1951) was a French army officer. He was commander in chief of the North East Front in 1939 and 1940. Opposing the plan by supreme commander Maurice Gamelin to move the best Allied forces into the Low Countries, he was overruled. Georges tried to allow as much initiative to his subordinates as possible to improve operational flexibility.

== Early career==
Georges entered the École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr and graduated third in his class in 1897. He served in French Algeria with a &quot;tirailleur&quot; regiment.

== First World War ==
He served in the French Army during the First World War and was seriously wounded while he was leading his battalion in 1914. He was then assigned to the general staff of the army, where he remained for the rest of the war.

== Interwar Period ==
In 1918 Georges served under General Ferdinand Foch as operations chief. He was also chief of staff under Marshal Henri-Philippe Pétain in French Morocco during the 1920–1926 Rif War and as a division commander in Algeria (1928–1932).

Georges was appointed to the Supreme War Council in November 1932. Based in Paris, he witnessed the assassination of French Foreign Minister Louis Barthou and King Alexander I of Yugoslavia in Marseilles on 9 October 1934. Seriously wounded, Georges had a long recovery but was expected to succeed General Maxime Weygand as head of the French Army in 1935. The Prime Minister, however, thought he was too right-wing and appointed General Gamelin instead.

== World War II ==
Georges was appointed as Gamelin&#x27;s deputy, but they had a mutually-hostile relationship. On the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Georges became commander of all French field armies. Gamelin and Georges assured Daladier that France had the greatest army in the world and were shocked when the Allied front was broken through at Sedan by the Wehrmacht. According to the memoirs of Captain Andre Beaufre, after the front was broken, the feeling was rife in Georges&#x27;s headquarters staff that the battle with the Germans had been lost, with Beaufre himself witnessing Georges breaking into tears. On 19 May 1940, both Gamelin and Georges were both dismissed, and General Weygand returned as head of the French Army.

Once Marshal Pétain took power after the fall of France and the collapse of the French Third Republic, Georges refused to play any significant role in the new Vichy France government. Winston Churchill wanted Georges to become commander of French forces in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia after the invasion of North Africa in November 1942. In that aim, Churchill was unsuccessful. Franklin Roosevelt insisted for the post go to General Henri Giraud instead.

In January 1943, Giraud and General Charles de Gaulle became co-presidents of the French Committee of National Liberation (CFLN). Georges was appointed minister without portfolio, but well before the end of the year, he, like Giraud, was ousted by de Gaulle. Thereafter he took no part in politics. He died in 1951.

<text>James Watson Gerard III (August 25, 1867 – September 6, 1951) was a United States lawyer, diplomat, and justice of the New York Supreme Court.

==Early life==
Gerard was born in Geneseo, New York. His father, James Watson Gerard Jr., was a lawyer and Democratic Party politician in New York. and his grandfather, also James Watson Gerard, was a noted trial lawyer and civic reformer in New York.

He graduated from Columbia University (A.B. 1890; A.M. 1891) and from New York Law School (LL.B. 1892).

==Career==
Gerard was chairman of the Democratic campaign committee of New York County for four years. He served on the National Guard of the State of New York for four years. He served through the Spanish–American War (1898) on the staff of General McCoskry Butt. From 1900 to 1904, he was quartermaster, with the rank of major, of the 1st Brigade of the Guard. He was elected to the New York Supreme Court in 1907, where he served as a judge until 1911.

===U.S. Ambassador to Germany===
Under President Woodrow Wilson, Gerard served as the American Ambassador to Germany from 1913 to 1917.

In 1914, Gerard was the Democratic (Tammany Hall) candidate for U.S. Senator from New York. He defeated the Anti-Tammany candidate, Franklin D. Roosevelt, in the Democratic primary, but lost the election to James W. Wadsworth, Jr.

At the outbreak of World War I, in 1914, Gerard assumed the care of British interests in Germany, later visited the camps in which British prisoners were confined, and did much to alleviate their condition. His responsibilities were further increased by the fact that German interests in France, Britain, and Russia were placed in the care of the American embassies in those countries, which made the American embassy in Berlin become a sort of clearing house. From first-hand knowledge, he settled the question, much disputed among the Germans themselves, as to the official attitude of the German government toward the violation of Belgian neutrality.

At the request of Gottlieb von Jagow, after the fall of Liège, Gerard served as intermediary for offering the Belgians peace and indemnity if they would grant passage of German troops through their country. On August 10, 1914, the Kaiser placed in Gerard&#x27;s hands a telegram addressed personally to Wilson that declared that Belgian neutrality &quot;had to be violated by Germany on strategical grounds.&quot; At the request of a high German official, the telegram was not made public as the Kaiser had wished but was sent privately to the President. After the sinking of the &quot;RMS Lusitania&quot; with many U.S. residents on board, on May 7, 1915, Gerard&#x27;s position became more difficult.

The German government asked him to leave the country in January 1917. Diplomatic relations were broken off on February 3, and he left Germany. He was detained for a time because of rumors that the German ambassador in America was being mistreated and that German ships had been confiscated. When the rumors were disproved, he was allowed to depart. He retired from diplomatic service in July 1917.

===Later career===
He took up the practice of law in New York City. The George H. Doran Company of New York City published two books Gerard wrote on his experiences, &quot;My Four Years in Germany&quot;, released in 1917, and the following year, &quot;Face to Face with Kaiserism&quot;. &quot;My Four Years in Germany&quot; was filmed in 1918.
Gerard was of major incidental importance in the rise of Warner Brothers movie producers as his book &quot;My Four Years in Germany&quot; was the source of the Warner&#x27;s first nationally syndicated film of the same name.

Gerard once said in a speech, &quot;The Foreign Minister of Germany once said to me &#x27;your country does not dare do anything against Germany, because we have in your country five hundred thousand German reservists [emigrants] who will rise in arms against your government if you dare to make a move against Germany.&#x27; Well, I told him that that might be so, but that we had five hundred thousandand onelamp posts in this country, and that that was where the reservists would be hanging the day after they tried to rise.&quot;

Upon returning to the U.S., Gerard went back to practicing law. He remained heavily involved in Democratic politics. He was the treasurer for the Democratic National Committee (1924–1932) and played a leading role in the nomination of Roosevelt for president in 1932. After an unsuccessful campaign for U.S. president in 1920, Gerard ceased active pursuit of elected office but accepted a central role in U.S. Democratic Party politics as a public speaker, fundraiser, consultant, and mass media contributor.

In 1933, Gerard reviewed Adolf Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; for &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;. His critique occupied the entire front page of the section and continued inside. &quot;Hitler is doing much for Germany,&quot; Gerard began, citing &quot;his unification of the Germans, his destruction of communism, his training of the young, his creation of a Spartan State animated by patriotism, his curbing of parliamentary government, so unsuited to the German character; his protection of the right of private property,&quot; which he said &quot;are all good&quot;. But he went on to condemn Hitler&#x27;s anti-Semitism. &quot;We have all of us a right to criticize, to boycott a nation which reverts to the horrible persecutions of the Dark Ages, we have a right to form a blockade of public opinion about this misguided country,&quot; he wrote. Gerard concluded, &quot;It is with sadness, tinged with fear for the world&#x27;s future, that we read Hitler&#x27;s hymn of hate against that race which has added so many names to the roll of the great in science, in medicine, in surgery, in music and the arts, in literature and all uplifting human endeavor.&quot;

Gerard&#x27;s final book was an autobiography, &quot;My First Eighty-Three Years in America&quot; (1951).

==Personal life==
Gerard&#x27;s wife, the former Mary Augusta Daly (called “Molly”), was the daughter of copper magnate Marcus Daly, head of the Anaconda Copper Mining Company that developed the mines of Butte, Montana, and built the town of Anaconda, Montana. They had no children. After both of Mary&#x27;s parents died, she was one of the heirs to the Daly ranch, the Bitter Root Stock Farm, north of Hamilton, Montana, where the couple had frequently visited. Gerard oversaw a number of the legal interests of the Daly family, and he purchased a cattle ranch of his own in the area. Today the University of Montana holds his collected papers.

Gerard died on September 6, 1951, aged 84, in Southampton, New York. He was interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York City.

<text>James Norman Hall (22 April 1887 – 5 July 1951) was an American writer best known for &quot;The Bounty Trilogy&quot;, three historical novels he wrote with Charles Nordhoff: &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1932), &quot;Men Against the Sea&quot; (1934) and &quot;Pitcairn&#x27;s Island&quot; (1934). During World War I, Hall had the distinction of serving in the militaries of three Western allies: Great Britain as an infantryman, and then France and the United States as an aviator. His awards include the Croix de Guerre, the Médaille Militaire, the Légion d&#x27;Honneur and the Distinguished Service Cross. After the war, Hall spent much of his life on the island of Tahiti, where he and Nordhoff wrote a number of successful adventure books, many adapted for film. He was also the father of Conrad L. Hall, regarded as one of the ten most influential cinematographers in film history.

==Biography==
Hall was born in Colfax, Iowa, where he attended the local schools. His early home is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Hall graduated from Grinnell College in 1910. He wrote the song &quot;Sons of Old Grinnell&quot;, which is part of the college songbook.

After graduation, he became a social worker in Boston for the Society for Prevention to Cruelty to Children while trying to establish himself as a writer and studying for a master&#x27;s degree from Harvard University.

Hall was on vacation in the United Kingdom in the summer of 1914, when World War I began. Posing as a Canadian, he enlisted in the British Army, serving in the Royal Fusiliers as a machine gunner during the Battle of Loos. He was discharged after his true nationality was discovered, and he returned to the United States. Hall&#x27;s first book, &quot;Kitchener&#x27;s Mob&quot; (1916), recounts his wartime experiences. &quot;Kitchener&#x27;s Mob&quot; sold moderately well in America following its publication and after a speaking tour to promote the book, Hall returned to Europe in 1916 on assignment with &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; magazine. He was to have written a series of stories about the group of American volunteers serving in the Lafayette Escadrille, but after spending some time with the American fliers Hall himself became caught up in the adventure and enlisted in the French Air Service. By then the original Escadrille had been expanded to the Lafayette Flying Corps, which trained American volunteers to serve in regular French squadrons.

During his time in French aviation, Hall was awarded the Croix de Guerre with five palms and the Médaille Militaire. When the United States entered the war in 1917, Hall was made a captain in the Army Air Service. There he met another American pilot, Charles Nordhoff. After being shot down over enemy lines on 7 May 1918, Hall spent the last months of the war as a German prisoner of war. After his release he was awarded the French Légion d&#x27;Honneur and the American Distinguished Service Cross.

After the war, Hall spent much of his life on the island of Tahiti, where he and Nordhoff, who had also moved there, wrote a number of successful adventure books (including the &quot;Bounty&quot; trilogy). In addition to the various &quot;Bounty&quot; films, other film adaptations of his fiction include &quot;The Hurricane&quot; (1937), which starred his nephew Jon Hall; &quot;Passage to Marseille&quot; (1944), featuring Humphrey Bogart; and &quot;Botany Bay&quot; (1953), with Alan Ladd.

In 1940, Hall published a book of poems with the title &quot;Oh Millersville!&quot; It appeared under the pseudonym Fern Gravel, and the poems were written in the voice of a girl of about 10 years of age. The book was critically well received, and the hoax was not exposed until 1946, when Hall published an article entitled &quot;Fern Gravel: A Hoax and a Confession&quot; in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;. He wrote that he had been inspired by a dream in which he saw himself back in his Iowa childhood with a group of children, among whom was a girl named Fern who wanted her poems written down. When he awoke, Hall wrote Fern&#x27;s poems, which are simply worded but nicely detailed first-person observations of small-town life.

In 1925, Hall married Sarah (Lala) Winchester, who was part-Polynesian. They had two children: the Academy Award winning cinematographer Conrad Hall (1926–2003) and Nancy Hall-Rutgers (born 1930). Hall died in 1951 in Tahiti and is buried on the hillside property just above the modest wooden house he and Lala lived in for many years. His grave bears a line of verse he wrote in Iowa at the age of 11: &quot;Look to the Northward stranger / Just over the hillside there / Have you ever in your travels seen / A land more passing fair?&quot;

Hall&#x27;s papers, including manuscripts and wartime correspondence, are housed in the Grinnell College Special Collections and Archives. The government of Tahiti restored Hall&#x27;s home in Arue, French Polynesia, which is now a historic house museum that includes Hall&#x27;s 3,000-volume library and personal effects on loan from the Hall family. &quot;The house itself is neither large nor prepossessing; it was built for comfort and practicality,&quot; wrote author and screenwriter Peter Benchley. &quot;It&#x27;s what&#x27;s inside the house that I found most fascinating: paintings, photographs, artifacts and anecdotes from Hall&#x27;s preliterary life.&quot;

<doc id="765924" wikidata="Q161062" url="?curid=765924" title="Togoland">
<text>Togoland, officially the Togoland Protectorate (; ), was a protectorate of the German Empire in West Africa from 1884 to 1914, encompassing what is now the nation of Togo and most of what is now the Volta Region of Ghana, approximately 90,400 km2 (29,867 sq mi) in size. During the period known as the &quot;Scramble for Africa&quot;, the colony was established in 1884 and was gradually extended inland.

At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, the colony was invaded and quickly overrun by British and French forces during the Togoland campaign and placed under military rule. In 1916 the territory was divided into separate British and French administrative zones, and this was formalised in 1922 with the creation of British Togoland and French Togoland.

==History==
The colony was established towards the end of the period of European colonisation in Africa generally known as the &quot;Scramble for Africa&quot;. Two separate protectorates were established in 1884. In February 1884, the chiefs of the town of Aného were abducted by German soldiers and forced to sign a treaty of protection. In the Lomé region, the German explorer, medical doctor, imperial consul and commissioner for West Africa Gustav Nachtigal was the driving force toward the establishment of the West African colonies of Togoland as well as Kamerun. From his base on the Spanish island possession Fernando Po in the Bight of Biafra he traveled extensively on the mainland of Africa. On 5 July 1884 Nachtigal signed a treaty with the local chief, , in which he declared a German protectorate over a stretch of territory along the Slave Coast on the Bight of Benin. With the small gunboat at anchor, the imperial flag was raised for the first time on the African continent. Consul Heinrich Ludwig Randad Jr., resident agent of the firm C. Goedelts at Ouidah, was appointed as the first commissioner for the territory.

In 1899, Germany and Great Britain traded territory in the Samoan Islands for the Northern Solomon Islands and control in Tonga, using the Togoland Neutral Zone (Yendi) and the Volta Triangle as bargaining chips.

==Economics and growth==
Germany gradually extended its control inland. Colonial administrators and settlers brought scientific cultivation to the country&#x27;s main export crops (cacao, coffee, cotton). The total number of German officials in the colony was only 12 in 1890. The colony&#x27;s infrastructure was developed to one of the highest levels in Africa. Colonial officials built roads and bridges toward the interior mountain ranges and three rail lines from the capital, Lomé: along the coast to Aného in 1905, to Palime (modern Kpalimé) in 1907, and the longest line, the Lomé–Blitta railway, or Hinterlandbahn, to Atakpamé and Blitta by 1911. By 1914, over 1,000 km of roads had been constructed by the colonial office.
Organized in 1888 with 25 Hausa infantry, the &quot;Polizeitruppe&quot; was used to enforce colonial authority over the hinterland of Togo. Expanded to 144 members in 1894, it conducted operations against Kpandu, and &quot;a number of towns in central Togo which had resisted the government was attacked and razed to the ground, the property of the inhabitants confiscated and the people fined sums ranging from 200 marks to 1,110 marks.&quot; Over the remainder of the decade, an additional 35 expeditions were authorized by the colonial government.

In 1895 the capital Lomé had a population of 31 Germans and 2,084 natives. By 1913 the native population had grown to 7,042 persons together with 194 Germans, including 33 women, while the entire colony had a German population of 316, including 61 women and 14 children. In the years just before World War I, Lomé had grown into the &quot;prettiest town in West Africa&quot;. Because it was one of Germany&#x27;s two self-supporting colonies, Togoland was acknowledged as a small but treasured possession. This lasted until the outbreak of World War I.

==World War I occupation and beyond==

After calling on the German colony to surrender on 6 August 1914, French and British troops invaded unopposed the next day. No military personnel were stationed in the protectorate. The police force consisted of a commander and deputy commander, 10 German sergeants, 1 native sergeant and 660 Togolese policemen deployed throughout the territory. The &quot;Entente&quot; forces occupied Lomé, then advanced on a powerful new radio station near Kamina, east of Atakpamé. The colony surrendered on 26 August 1914 under governor Hans Georg von Doering after the German technicians who had built the radio installation destroyed the station during the night of 24/25 August. In the weeks before the destruction, Kamerun, German Southwest Africa, German East Africa and 47 ships on the high seas were sent reports of Allied actions, as well as warnings of trouble ahead. On 27 December 1916, Togoland was separated into French and British administrative zones. After the end of World War I, members of the newly established Czechoslovakia government considered acquiring the colony as Czechoslovak Togo, but the idea never proceeded past creating a flag. Following the ratification of the Treaty of Versailles, on 20 July 1922, Togoland formally became a League of Nations Class B mandate divided into French Togoland and British Togoland, covering respectively about two-thirds and one-third of the territory.

The British area of the former German colony was integrated into Ghana in 1957 after a May 1956 plebiscite in which 58% of British-area residents voted to join Ghana upon its independence, rather than remaining under British-administered United Nations Trusteeship.

The French-ruled region became the Republic of Togo in 1960 and is now known as the Togolese Republic. In 1960, the new state invited the last German governor of Togoland, Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg, to the country&#x27;s official independence celebrations.

==Governors==
== Planned symbols for Togoland ==
In 1914 a series of drafts were made for proposed Coat of Arms and Flags for the German colonies. However, World War I broke out before the designs were finalized and implemented and the symbols were never actually taken into use. Following the defeat in the war, Germany lost all its colonies and the prepared coat of arms and flags were therefore never used.

<text>Hilltop Park was a ballpark in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. It was the home of the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball from 1903 to 1912 when they were known as the &quot;Highlanders&quot;. It was also the temporary home of the New York Giants during a two-month period in 1911 while the Polo Grounds was being rebuilt after a fire.

The ballpark&#x27;s formal name, as painted on its exterior walls, was American League Park. Because the park was located on top of a ridge of Manhattan Island, it was nicknamed Hilltop Park, and its team was most often called the New York Highlanders (as well as the Americans and the Yankees). This &quot;Highland&quot; connection contrasted with their intra-city rivals, the Giants, whose Polo Grounds was just a few blocks away, in the bottomland under Coogan&#x27;s Bluff.

Hilltop Park sat on the block bounded by Broadway, 165th Street, Fort Washington Avenue, and 168th Street. The structure consisted of a covered grandstand stretching from first base to third base and uncovered bleacher sections down the right and left field lines. Originally built in just six weeks, the park sat 16,000, with standing room for an additional 10,000 or so. The bleachers were covered in 1911, and also bleachers to seat an additional 5,000 fans were built in 1911 (partially to accommodate Giants fans, who were temporary tenants after the Polo Grounds fire) in center field.

The field was initially huge by modern standards — to left field, to center field and to right field. An inner fence was soon constructed to create more realistic action. Both the park and the nickname &quot;Highlanders&quot; were abandoned when the American Leaguers left, at the beginning of the 1913 season, to rent the Polo Grounds from the Giants. The Polo Grounds had a far larger seating capacity, and by that time was made of concrete due to the 1911 fire. Hilltop Park was demolished in 1914.

==History==

American League baseball came to New York City in 1903 when gambler Frank J. Farrell and former New York City Police Chief William S. Devery bought the Baltimore Orioles franchise for $18,000, equal to $ today. They established the team at Hilltop Park, a hastily constructed wooden park seating about 16,000 fans, on the west side of Broadway between 165th and 168th streets. It was catty-corner to the New York School for the Deaf, which at that time was located at 99 Fort Washington. The land was acquired via a ten-year lease, arranged by the New York Institution for the Blind.

The block was effectively parkland, with many trees to be cut down and an artificial lake to be drained and filled in. In mid-April, the owners announced that the new ballpark was to be officially known as American League Park.

Between that fact and the club president Joseph Gordon being fancifully linked by sportswriters to the Gordon Highlanders, the team nickname &quot;Highlanders&quot; followed logically. Opening Day came on April 30, 1903, when the New York Highlanders played the Washington Senators.

The ballpark site was quite large for its time ( or nearly double the size of many ballpark sites of that era), and the south portion of the land plot was used for the parking of first carriages and later automobiles. The shape of the land plot was a large trapezoid with right angles at the site&#x27;s northeast and southeast corners. The left field foul line ran mostly North to South and was parallel to Fort Washington Road (the western boundary of the park). The left field foul line would, if extended about 20 additional feet, have intersected 168th Street at less than 90°. The right field foul line would, if extended, have intersected Broadway (the eastern boundary of the park) at more than 90°. The ballpark site was thus trapezoidal in shape and large for the Deadball Era.

The seating capacity of 16,000 was also rather large for this time period. Capacity in the dead-ball Era was a flexible concept. In accordance with the practices of the day, overflow crowds were allowed to stand in the perimeter of the outfield. In addition, for &quot;big&quot; games, additional standees were allowed down the foul lines and between home plate and the backstop. Thus the effective overall capacity of the park was closer to 25,000, although even when stuffed to the gills, it fell well short of the normal capacity of the Polo Grounds.

The original 1903 construction of Hilltop Park cost about $200,000, more than two-thirds of which was spent for rock blasting and excavations; and the groundskeeper of the Highlanders, Phil Schenck, laid out the playing field. The ballpark consisted of a covered grandstand of three sections, although it was not actually roofed until June 1 that season. Two sections of the grandstand were parallel to the foul lines and the third section was a short intermediate diagonal, which formed the backstop. The grandstand extended a short way past both first and third bases, and a clubhouse was located behind the center field fence. Single-deck bleachers that extended down both foul lines reached from the grandstand almost to the fences. The third base bleachers were not finished until June 1903. These first and third base bleachers angled towards the foul lines reducing the foul area at the fences to about 15 feet. A modest-sized scoreboard was in fair territory down the left field foul line. The main entrance to the park was on Broadway and a ramp led up to the top of the first base grandstand. Unlike many of the other contemporary wooden ballparks-this one never burned.

Hilltop Park was not in good condition when it opened. There was a swamp in right field that had yet to be filled with rock, the outfield had no grass, the grandstand had not been completed, and players had to dress at their hotel rooms because the clubhouse was not completed. When Hilltop Park was finally completed, a single-tier wooden covered grandstand extended from the third base dugout to homeplate, and around to the first base dugout. Uncovered grandstands extended to both foul poles. From behind homeplate, fans could see scenic views of the Hudson River and New Jersey Palisades.

The ball club continued work on the outfield. Prior to the 1904 season, it was reported, &quot;the rather deep hollow at right field has been nearly obliterated, which will increase the playing space of that portion of the park many feet.&quot;

After the Polo Grounds burnt down in 1911, the Highlanders/Yankees offered to share their facility with the New York Giants, and the grateful National Leaguers took up temporary residence in Hilltop Park. The Highlanders added a bleacher section in deep center field, painted black to serve as a batter&#x27;s eye screen. After two more seasons, the lease expired and the American Leaguers moved a few blocks east and south into the rebuilt Polo Grounds to sub-lease from the Giants. At that point the nickname Highlanders was dropped as the team was now strictly &quot;the Yankees&quot;. The last big league game played at Hilltop Park was on October 5, 1912.

Although the Yankees were done at the Hilltop, other events were staged there in the fall of 1912, including high school football and Auto polo. The park was demolished in 1913.

== 1904 ==

The Highlanders / Yankees were not particularly successful during their stay at the Hilltop. There was no hint that the club would eventually become baseball&#x27;s greatest dynasty. Their best season was 1904, when they were in a tight race with Boston all summer. The season ended on October 10, with the Hilltop hosting a doubleheader against Boston, who led by 1 1/2 games. A sweep by the home team would have won the league championship for New York. However, Boston won the first game by scoring a tie-breaking run in the top of the ninth inning. With a Boston runner on third, New York pitcher Jack Chesbro threw a spitball that got away and sailed over the catcher&#x27;s head. The runner on third easily came across the plate with what proved to be the pennant-clinching run.[&quot;Boston Globe&quot;, October 11, 1904, p. 11] The &quot;Globe&quot; giddily called the game &quot;The greatest victory ever won in outdoor sport.&quot;

Although the Highlanders failed to win the league title, their unexpected presence in the pennant race ultimately led to the stabilization of the modern World Series. The Giants were on their way to winning the National League flag, and they announced ahead of time that they had no intention of playing against their cross-town rivals in a post-season World Series. Although Boston prevailed in the American League race, the Giants stuck with their plan, and no Series was played. The resulting public outcry spurred the Giants&#x27; owner to organize a committee and establish rules for how future Series were to be conducted.

==Cy Young and Walter Johnson==

Two Hall of Fame pitchers had good outings at Hilltop Park in 1908.
*On June 30, 1908, Cy Young pitched a no-hitter against New York, winning handily 8-0. This was the third and final no-hitter in Young&#x27;s illustrious career. The game coverage by &quot;The New York Times&quot; the following day, along with a summary of Young&#x27;s career, is noteworthy in that the locals were referred to as the &quot;New York Yankees&quot; or &quot;Yanks&quot; throughout the article, demonstrating how common the nickname was by then, and with no reference at all to &quot;Highlanders&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; also consistently referred to the Hilltop by its formal name, &quot;the American League Park&quot;. (&quot;The Complete Book of Baseball: A New York Times Scrapbook History&quot;, Arno Press, Bobbs-Merrill, 1980, p. 8)
*One of the more impressive pitching performances of all time took place at the Hilltop. On September 4, 1908, 20-year-old Walter Johnson of the Washington Senators/Nationals shut out the Highlanders 3-0 with a five-hitter. The next day, Johnson again blanked the Yankees, 6-0, on a three-hitter. The city&#x27;s &quot;blue law&quot; prevented a game on Sunday. On Monday, September 7, Senators manager Joe Cantillon again gave Johnson the ball and he improved again, this time hurling a two-hit, 4-0 victory over the Hilltoppers, his third shutout in the space of four days.

==Ty Cobb==

Detroit outfielder Ty Cobb, &quot;The Georgia Peach&quot;, made many a mark on the game of baseball, some famous and some infamous. At least one of each happened at the Hilltop:
*In a game &quot;sometime in 1909&quot; according to photographer Charles M. Conlon (the actual date has been determined as July 23, 1910 ), Conlon snapped a photo of Cobb sliding into third base, stealing the base and spilling Highlanders&#x27; third baseman Jimmy Austin. This photo became one of the most famous and widely circulated baseball photos ever.
*On May 15, 1912, after being heckled for several innings, Cobb leaped the fence and attacked his tormentor. He was suspended indefinitely by league president Ban Johnson, but his suspension was eventually reduced to 10 days and $50. The Tigers went on a one-game strike for the next game, at Philadelphia, but rather than forfeit, the Tigers owners filled the lineup with a makeshift group of ex-college players and whoever else could be found. Coincidentally, one of the substitutes, Billy Maharg, would become involved behind the scenes in the Black Sox Scandal seven years later.

==Hilltop Park site now==

The site where Hilltop Park once stood remained vacant until the land was purchased by Edward S. Harkness for the express purpose of building the world&#x27;s first academic medical center. Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center opened in 1928 and is now called NewYork-Presbyterian / Columbia University Irving Medical Center.

Some of the buildings visible in the background of ballpark photos still stand. They include a trio of six-story buildings at the northwest corner of Broadway and 168th (behind center field); and the Fort Washington Avenue Armory (behind left field), which was built in 1911. Those buildings also appear in pictures of the tabernacle built for Billy Sunday on the ballpark site. :File:SundayNYCTabernacle.gif

The site of the hearing-impaired institution to the southwest is now a parking lot for the Medical Center. Most of the other buildings visible in ballpark photos are gone, including the five-story Public School 169, behind right-center field.

On September 30, 1993 a plaque was placed on the hospital grounds to mark the former location of home plate in Hilltop Park. The plaque was donated to the hospital by the New York Yankees to commemorate the exact location of where home plate rested in Hilltop Park. The plaque is bronze and is the same size and shape as a regulation home plate. The text on the plaque reads,

&quot;Dedicated to Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center and the community of Washington Heights by the New York Yankees to mark the exact location of home plate in Hilltop Park, home of the New York Highlanders, from 1903 to 1912, later renamed the New York Yankees.&quot;

<doc id="765928" wikidata="Q1681179" url="?curid=765928" title="J. Thomas Heflin">
<text>James Thomas Heflin (April 9, 1869 – April 22, 1951), nicknamed &quot;Cotton Tom&quot;, was an American politician who served as a United States representative and United States senator from Alabama.

==Early life==
Born in Louina, Alabama, he attended the Agriculture and Mechanical College of Alabama (now Auburn University). He never graduated, but independently read law and was admitted to the bar in 1893, practicing law in LaFayette, Alabama.

==Early career==
Heflin first rose to political prominence as a delegate who helped to draft the 1901 Constitution of Alabama. Heflin argued, successfully, for completely excluding Black Alabamians from voting, stating, &quot;God Almighty intended the negro to be the servant of the white man.&quot; As Secretary of State in 1903, Heflin was an outspoken supporter of men put on trial for enslaving black laborers through fraudulent convict leasing. As detailed in Douglas A. Blackmon&#x27;s book, &quot;Slavery by Another Name&quot;, the practices were a brutal, post-emancipation form of slavery in which African Americans were often falsely convicted of crimes and then sold to farmers or industrialists. Heflin explicitly used white supremacist rhetoric to mobilize support for the defendants. He argued before a group of Confederate veterans that forcing blacks to labor was a means to hold them in their proper social position.

==House years==
In 1904, Heflin was elected to the House of Representatives as a Democrat in a special election to fill the vacancy left by the death of Charles Winston Thompson. He defeated five other candidates in the election, including future Florida governor Sidney Johnston Catts. Four years later, while he was a member of the House, he shot and seriously wounded a black man who confronted him on a Washington streetcar. Heflin threw the victim, Lewis Lundy, off the streetcar and shot at him through the streetcar window. Lundy received a wound to the head, and reports vary on whether it was due to pistol-whipping by Heflin, by the fall from the streetcar, or by a bullet wound. A white bystander, Thomas McCreery, was wounded by a stray bullet fired by Heflin. Although indicted, Heflin had the charges dismissed. In subsequent campaigns, he bragged of the shooting as one of his major career accomplishments.

On May 10, 1913, Heflin introduced House Resolution 103 requesting President Woodrow Wilson, members of his Cabinet, the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and other federal officials to don white carnations, &quot;or some other white flower,&quot; to honor mothers for being &quot;the greatest source of our country’s strength and inspiration.” The tradition of wearing white carnations (and later red carnations) spread across the nation. The Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C., adorned its lobby with vases of white carnations, as did many restaurants in the capital city. With the positive response to the 1913 resolution, Heflin introduced formal legislation in 1914, designating the second Sunday in May, Mother’s Day. Heflin’s 1914 resolution made no mention of carnations, but requested that the U.S. flag be displayed at government offices, homes, and businesses across the country, “as a public expression of our love and reverence for the mothers of our country.” After quickly passing the House and being directed through the Senate by former Representative Morris Sheppard of Texas, the bill went to the President’s desk on May 8, and became law that same day.

==Senate years==
Heflin continued to serve in the House until 1920, when he was elected to the Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of John H. Bankhead. In the 1920s, he expressed strong hostility to the Knights of Columbus. In 1928, Heflin further expressed outrage that Al Smith was the party&#x27;s nominee and inveighed against Catholic influences on the Democratic Party; he attacked Smith and the pope on the Senate floor, and &quot;embarked on a nationwide speaking tour, partially funded by the KKK.&quot; Instead of Smith, he supported Republican Herbert Hoover for President and is sometimes credited with coining the term &quot;yellow dog&quot;.

The Democrats thus did not renominate Heflin for the Senate in 1930. He ran as an independent candidate, losing decisively to John H. Bankhead II. Returning to Washington to serve out his term, Heflin initiated a Senate investigation of voting fraud to try to overturn Bankhead&#x27;s election. The inquiry lasted 15 months and cost $100,000.

In the same year, Heflin officially protested in the Senate against New York&#x27;s legalization of racial intermarriage between a black man and a white woman. New York Senator Royal S. Copeland reacted angrily to Heflin, who replied that if Copeland went someday to the South on a presidential campaign, he would be lynched and hanged by the population.

In April 1932, with Heflin&#x27;s term expired and Bankhead seated, the Senate prepared to vote on a committee recommendation against Heflin. He delivered a five-hour oration, punctuating his remarks with vehement gestures and racist jokes. As he thundered to a conclusion, the gallery audience, packed with his supporters, jumped to its feet with a roar of approval. They were ordered out of the chamber. Two days later, the Senate voted by a wide margin to dismiss Heflin&#x27;s claim.

Heflin was suspected of being a member of the Ku Klux Klan. In 1937, the Imperial Wizard, Hiram Wesley Evans, told the press that Heflin had joined the secret order in the late 1920s.

==Later life==
After his defeat, Heflin was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the House and Senate on several occasions. Later, he was appointed special representative of the Federal Housing Administration under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He died in 1951 in LaFayette.
==Legacy==
Heflin was the nephew of Robert Stell Heflin, a congressman from Alabama. His own nephew, Howell Heflin, was also later elected U.S. senator from Alabama and served from 1979 to 1997.

<text>Outlive () is a real-time strategy video game developed and produced by Brazilian studio Continuum Entertainment. It is a mission-based real-time strategy game where the player controls either the human military or robot forces and attempts to eliminate all opposing forces. It was initially released in 2000 in Brazil (2001 for the rest of the world), and was the second and most successful product of Continuum. The game was one of the few Brazilian games to be published by a mainstream AAA publisher back in the early 2000s. It was published in the United States and Europe by Take-Two Interactive.

==Plot summary==

===Human Campaign===
The increase of terrorist activity around the globe (the terrorist organizations had merged, creating large conglomerates whom the strongest and most feared was the Liberty Army) and the rapidly dwindling natural resources of the planet had forced the world&#x27;s most powerful nations to take decisive measures. April 17, 2035 saw the creation of the World Council. The Council saw humanity&#x27;s survival in interplanetary supply of resources mined on other celestial bodies. They sent out a large group of probes to nearly every planet and moon of the Solar System. After a lengthy search, they had found that the richest object is Titan. The Council started the Outlive Project: constructing three starships which would carry the initial colonists there. However, there was a problem: Titan&#x27;s atmosphere was toxic to humans, and the climate was not so friendly either.

Two groups had arisen to solve the problem. One of them, led by Dr. Joseph Taylor, had tried to create genetically modified creatures to do the initial work. The other group, led by Dr. Mary-Anne Harley and sponsored by Mechatronics Inc., would combine robotics with sophisticated AI, making them suitable to do anything without the need for human supervision. Due to the shortage of time, the World Council gave both teams one Earth year to create working prototypes of the respective projects.

As the Outlive project neared completion, Dr. Taylor was ordered to relocate to a new research base after an unsuccessful attempt on his life. Prior to the transfer, all staff and equipment was stored in a military outpost. As LA forces held the sector, the newly created Special Counter-Terrorist Group and its leader, Brad Maxwell, had to clear a safe way for the convoy to the lab. Maxwell was a little angry at Taylor, as the impatient scientist had gone to the lab already when he reached the outpost. However, shortly after their arrival, a breakout of the unstable beings known as Abominables occurred. They had destroyed the base, scattering the staff. Taylor had been found and evacuated. Because of the accident, the World Council had terminated Taylor&#x27;s contract, much to his protest, declaring that the three Outlive ships will have a robotic crew. However, the Liberty Army had occupied Mechatronics.

Maxwell had cleared them out, using some of the Mechatronics&#x27; head, Carl Eberhardt&#x27;s prototype battle robots. Even though the LA has been pushed out, Maxwell became suspicious of Mechatronics&#x27; motives, as materials used for weapons had been found in the facility. One of his subordinates, Lieutenant Peter Mackenzie, accompanied him to the Experimental City, where they believed Mechatronics trained their robots as soldiers. Although General Kaminski told them to don&#x27;t care with this subject, they found hard proof in the Technology Center. Kaminski promised them a complete investigation after the Outlive mission was away.

The three ships were finally completed, but the launch was halted by news of two AA-artilleries recently installed by Pablo Morales, leader of the Liberty Army, very close to the launching sites. As both of them had been destroyed by Maxwell, the mission was finally launched. However, there were a third artillery, hidden in an underground base. SCTG forces quickly destroyed it, but the damage has been done: the rocket hit &quot;Outlive-1&quot;. Upon reentry, the ship broke into 3 larger pieces. &quot;Outlive-2&quot; had reported of a contact with something then connection was lost. &quot;Outlive-3&quot; reported they had safely landed on Titan and started mining operations as per orders.

The World Council received reports that Liberty Army forces were on their way to the crash site. As Maxwell and Mackenzie arrived in the sector, Kaminski told them that he was allied with Mechatronics, and ordered all of their units to execute them. But he had been interrupted by Mackenzie who told Maxwell that he is an operative to the Liberty Army; Morales had known of the World Council&#x27;s corruption and their affiliation with Mechatronics; that was the reason why he attacked the corporation&#x27;s facility and tried to prevent the launch. Infuriated, Maxwell willingly joined the Army to make Kaminski pay for his betrayal. Both were rescued by Morales, who told them that the robots from the downed ship had started to establish a base and mine, as if they were really on Titan. To prevent the council from utilizing them, the three destroyed the camp and their commander, Procyon.

Utilizing information acquired by an agent, they have discovered that the council had built ICBMs, missiles packed with nuclear warheads of a large yield. They plan to use it against the Liberty Army&#x27;s encampments around the world. Mackenzie successfully disarmed all silos, however the last were booby-trapped: when Mackenzie went inside to work on that, the multi-megaton warhead exploded.
After a long-lasting and bloody battle, the Liberty Army bested both the most elite forces of the World Council and the well-armed support troops of the Mechatronics. The council had collapsed, and the Army had formed the Confederation.

===Robot Campaign===
When the &quot;Outlive-2&quot; got out of contact, they had been secretly recalled to Earth to help the World Council against the Liberty Army. However, the war was already over when they had landed. Commander of the ship, Argus, had set &quot;his&quot; first objective of contacting Eberhardt. When &quot;he&quot; reached the base, it was in bad condition because of a surprise attack. Eberhardt fled, but was found. After destroying the nearby Confederate outpost, Eberhardt revealed his plans to Argus: &quot;he&quot; would have to construct and protect a portal to Titan, from which additional help in the form of Draco, leader of &quot;Outlive-3&quot; and his minions will emerge. With this newfound help, they had recaptured Mechatronics.

Some time after this, Eberhardt has been contacted by Kaminski. The Russian offered info for a meeting. As Eberhardt did not trust him, Argus was sent. His instincts were right, as it was a trap. Kaminski said that Maxwell had granted him protection if he manages to capture a commander. Draco was enraged, and leveled the base, but Argus was already shipped to another. &quot;He&quot; was rescued this time, with Kaminski personally killed by Draco.

Draco received intelligence of a secret base in a valley, where Dr. Harley is experimenting with robots. When the base was destroyed, the two commanders went through the valley in search for more enemies. They had been surprised by a large number of troops and Dr. Harley, who congratulated Argus for a good job. It turns out that she altered Argus&#x27; programming so that he would obey and sell Draco out. The latter obviously did not want to go through this and had gone berserk. However, the troops gained the upper hand and left him for dead. &quot;He&quot; was rescued by Eberhardt.

The two had learned about Harley&#x27;s experiments and that she needed a cache of microprocessors to power up her own robots. They had prevented the cargo from reaching the destination, and even destroyed the Confederate forces in a large-scale attack.

===Cooperation campaign===
Mechatronics had taken control of the planet and the last remnants of the Confederacy is being hunted by robotic execution squads. Maxwell has been captured, Morales and Argus are on the run. The remaining forces of the Liberty Army and the Robots loyal to the Confederacy had formed the Resistance. Argus and Pablo had formed a base of both humans and Robots which had been attacked by two different Robotic bases, from both the North (Blue base) &amp; from the South (Cyan base). Then the Campaign has a twist, if you destroy the Blue base, Argus and Pablo go to rescue Maxwell which is protected by a Robotic Stronghold and a strong Robotic army which was led by a Robotic Commander named Sentinel. But if you destroy the Cyan base, Argus &amp; Pablo alone go to save Dr. Marry Anne Harley which was attacked by Robots.
When Argus &amp; Pablo go to save Maxwell, they first have to destroy Sentinel for &quot;he&quot; was the only Al in the army &amp; if &quot;he&quot; was destroyed, the Robotic Army would shut down. When Sentinel was destroyed, Argus &amp; Pablo had destroyed the Robotic Stronghold &amp; rescued Maxwell. The Resistance had also taken the remaining Robots and reprogrammed them to serve the Resistance.
When Argus &amp; Pablo alone went to rescue Dr. Mary Anne Harley, they had to destroy the AA-Artillery, which wasn&#x27;t easy for they had to sneak pass the Robots which were well armed and had set up a large base. When Argus &amp; Pablo destroyed the AA-Artillery, the Resistance Air-Force could come and destroy the Robots, thus rescuing Dr. Mary Anne.
After these 2 missions, Argus and Pablo gather the Men and Robots of the Resistance and destroy the Mechatronics base in a large scale battle. The Resistance won, thus bringing the end to the harsh rule of Mechatronics. Carl had escaped, but the New Confederation had been formed, with Brad Maxwell as its leader, and an era of peace had begun.
Little did they know, that Carl had escaped from Earth and hidden himself in a space station, somewhere not far from Earth. It was at that moment that it was discovered that Carl Eberheart was working for an alien race that wishes to bring Earth to ruin. Carl was executed by the Alien Leader for his failure. Then a massive fleet of Alien UFOs appear, heading towards Earth.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;mixed&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

<text>Erskine College is a private Christian college in Due West, South Carolina, United States. It is an undergraduate liberal arts college and a graduate theological seminary. The college was founded in 1839 by the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. Its sports teams compete in NCAA Division II as a member of Conference Carolinas.

==History==
Erskine College was founded by the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church in 1839. Prior to this time the church had established an academy for men in Due West, S.C., in 1835, and a seminary in 1837. The academy became Erskine College, the first four-year church-related college in South Carolina. It was named for Ebenezer Erskine, a pastor and one of the founders of one of the antecedent bodies of the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. Erskine had led a group of separatists from the Church of Scotland to found an Associate Presbytery.

Erskine began to admit women in 1894 and officially became coeducational in 1899. In 1927, it merged with Due West Female College, founded in 1859. In 1929, Bryson College closed and merged with Erskine College.
A planned merger of the college, the seminary, and the Due West Woman&#x27;s College paved the way for accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges in 1925. By 1927 the three schools had merged into one institution called Erskine College, with the seminary serving as its graduate theological school.

During World War II Erskine served as a cadet training school for the United States Army Air Corps. A substantial enrollment effort in the late 1950s brought Erskine&#x27;s undergraduate enrollment to over 700 students throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s. In 2014, Erskine celebrated 175 years as a Christian academic community, and in the 2022–2023 school year, enrollment was at an all-time high of 830 undergraduate and 137 graduate seminary students.

On March 11, 2014, a website article on Outsports detailed the coming out of two gay male players on the college&#x27;s volleyball team. On February 27, 2015, Erskine College released a statement that students are expected to &quot;follow the teachings of scripture concerning matters of human sexuality.&quot;

=== Accreditation issues ===
Erskine was placed on &quot;warning&quot; status by its accreditor, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, following its decennial accreditation review in December 2013. The college&#x27;s status was reviewed in December 2014, and the sanction was then escalated to &quot;Probation&quot; status, due to continued failure to comply with accreditation standards related to fiscal stability and institutional effectiveness in student learning outcomes. SACSCOC removed all accreditation sanctions and reaffirmed Erskine&#x27;s regional accreditation in December 2015.

In 2023, Erskine was once again placed on &quot;warning&quot; status following review. SACS cited financial issues and board control as determining factors. Steve Adamson, president of Erskine, said he fully expected &quot;to have the warning lifted in December 2023 and the institution’s reaffirmation granted.&quot; However, in December 2023, Erskine was continued on warning status.

=== Charter schools ===

In 2017, Erskine College began sponsoring charter schools in South Carolina through the Charter Institute at Erskine. The president of Erskine College serves as the chairman of the institute, while Cameron Runyan serves as superintendent and CEO.
The Charter Institute attracted media attention in 2024, when it formed Teach Right USA, a nonprofit which shares leadership with the institute and sought to found charter schools sponsored by the institute. Through the nonprofit, leaders of the institute explored starting charter schools in Tennessee. State legislators requested information to determine of state funds or hours were used in the endeavor.

In 2021, Erskine College loaned one million dollars to a for-profit charter school management organization, which defaulted on their loan, ultimately only repaying $35,000. The transaction was not made public until 2024, when Erskine filed a lawsuit seeking to recover the full amount.

==Academics==

Erskine College offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees. Minors are offered in several fields of study. A Christian Education concentration is offered within the Bible and Religion major and special minors are offered in Family Studies, Computer Science, Non-Western Studies, and Information Technology. The college also offers pre-professional programs in medicine, law, pharmacy, and dentistry. The student to faculty ratio is 15:1.

Erskine is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

==Athletics==

The Erskine College&#x27;s athletics teams, nicknamed the &quot;Flying Fleet&quot; participate in NCAA Division II sports as a member of Conference Carolinas.

Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, track and field, and volleyball; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, beach volleyball, cheerleading, cross country, dance, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, track and field, and volleyball. Co-educational sports include bass fishing, e-sports, and rodeo.

===Flying Fleet football===

In 1896, Erskine College began its first American football team. They had successful seasons between 1917 and 1921. During those seasons they had wins against Wofford, Presbyterian, South Carolina, Clemson, and the Citadel. Notably, it was during a game against Furman University in 1929 that Erskine was first referred to as &quot;The Flying Fleet&quot;, a nickname given to them by a Greenville reporter who was impressed by their passing performance. On October 18, 1948, they defeated Florida State 14–6. The Flying Fleet ended their football program in 1951.

In 2018, Erskine College announced the return of the football program for the 2020 season competing as an Independent in NCAA Division II. In 2021, The Flying Fleet played its first football game in 70 years.

<text>Hornet Flight is a Second World War-based spy thriller written by British author Ken Follett. It was published in 2002 by Macmillan in the UK and Dutton in the US.

==Plot introduction==
By late June 1941, the United Kingdom alone stood against Nazi Germany on the Western Front. In the East, the Soviet Army was feeling the full force of Operation Barbarossa. To show solidarity among the unlikely capitalist-communist Alliance, Winston Churchill and Bomber Command planned a massive aerial bombardment of German territories. Unfortunately and inexplicably, Bomber Command&#x27;s planes were getting shot down in record numbers.

Meanwhile, 18-year-old Danish schoolboy Harald Olufsen grows increasingly dissatisfied with his country&#x27;s cooperation with the German invaders. His resentment of the Wehrmacht leads him to discover the truth about a hidden military installation, a truth known to only a select few in the Nazi organization. Running from the German authorities and an old family enemy, Copenhagen police detective Peter Flemming, Harald knows that he must get to Britain. But to do so in time to save the bombers, Harald has one option: flight.

==Historical background to the novel==

&quot;Hornet Flight&quot; is a fictionalized retelling of actual events. Follett&#x27;s website states that his inspiration for the story came from Leo Marks, a former Special Operations Executive employee, who wrote a brief account in his book, &quot;Between Silk and Cyanide: A Codemaker&#x27;s Story 1941-1945&quot; about two young Danes who found a derelict de Havilland Hornet Moth biplane, repaired it, and flew it to Britain. While that event inspired the use of two teen-aged Danes as his primary characters, the story of the photographing of the German radar station and flying the film to Britain was actually that of Thomas Christian Sneum, a Flight Lieutenant in the Danish Naval Air Service, who made the flight to Britain on 21 June 1941 in a Hornet with Keld Peterson, the mechanic who helped him rebuild it. Sneum was arrested as a suspected double agent before being returned to Denmark as an agent, from which he escaped again in 1942 by crossing the ice to Sweden with a fellow naval aviator.

The German radar installations causing the havoc with the British bombers are historical. The Freya radar that Harald investigates was part of the Kammhuber Line, the German night air defense system along the North Sea. The Freya radar, with a range of 100 miles, was used to detect any incoming bombers at long-distance. Then 2 modified &quot;Würzburg Riese&quot; (&quot;Würzburg Giant&quot;) radars tracked a single British bomber and a German night fighter to bring them together. The RAF tactically countered the line by concentrating all its bombers through a single radar sector in a &quot;bomber stream&quot;, allowing the bulk to escape interception because the system could only concentrate on one bomber at a time.

However the actual events alluded to in &quot;Hornet Flight&quot; occurred a year later than in the novel, and without connection to the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The &quot;Himmelbett&quot; structure of radar installations did not become operational until late 1941. RAF bomber losses increased by 50% in the first months of 1942, but the trend was reversed with the first &quot;thousand bomber raid&quot; on Cologne on 30 May 1942. The concept of the bomber stream was not the result of espionage by Resistance operatives in any occupied country, but resulted from statistical analysis of British operations.

The strict Protestant community in which Harald Olufsen grew up and against which he rebels in the earlier part of the book is typical of those dominated by the religious movement known as &quot;The Church Association for the Inner Mission in Denmark&quot;, of which West Jutland is a stronghold.

==Complex characters and loose-ends==

Unlike formulaic action thrillers, the German characters in &quot;Hornet Flight&quot; are generally decent and honourable. Harald&#x27;s nemesis, Danish Police Detective Peter Flemming, is a childhood acquaintance, formerly his older brother&#x27;s best friend, he had turned into bitter enemy after an earlier falling out between the families. Flemming, though generally an obnoxious monster, does not lack psychological depth. An authoritarian personality leads him to regard policework as more than a job. For it becomes an obsession. In the conditions of 1941 Denmark, this fervor leads him to become a Nazi collaborator, indeed often showing more zeal than the German occupiers themselves.

The struggle which Harald and his friends wage, making enormous sacrifices, is morally ambiguous: they are, in essence, willing to lay their lives on the line so that the British will be able to bomb German cities. Only the vital need to bring down Hitler&#x27;s monstrous and genocidal regime can justify their actions. Follett brings home the point by having the RAF set out to bomb Hamburg using the intelligence obtained by Harald and Karen. Hamburg was described as the home of Harald&#x27;s beloved Jewish aunt and cousin. At the book&#x27;s conclusion Harald is left with the gnawing doubt he may have caused their deaths - and, while not making him doubt the rightness of his actions, he is less than jubilant at the results.

Follett introduces a number of innocent Danish characters who would predictably be subject to persecution by the occupying Nazis: the brain-damaged wife of a Danish police detective, prominent Jews and their families, and homosexuals. However, Follett leaves the fates of these characters unresolved.

==Controversy==
The publication of &quot;Hornet Flight&quot; generated some controversy when a Royal Air Force veteran residing in Zimbabwe wrote to Follett about a character mentioned only in the prologue, &quot;Charles Ford&quot; - a black RAF officer. The veteran claimed that there had been no black officers in the RAF, and accused Follett of including the character as a &quot;sop&quot; to black people. Ulric Cross, a black former RAF squadron leader and the man on whom the character of Charles Ford was based, refuted Frampton&#x27;s claims in an article published in the &quot;Trinidad Express&quot;. Over 250 Trinidadians alone served in the RAF during World War II.

<text>Alvanley Johnston (12 May 1875 – 17 September 1951) was a Canadian / American locomotive engineer who became head of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE), a union that covered the United States and Canada, holding the title of Grand Chief Engineer from 1925 to 1950. During his tenure the Brotherhood recovered from financial problems, weathered the Great Depression and World War II, and held out for shorter hours and higher wages in a nationwide strike in 1946.

==Early years==

Alvanley Johnston was born on 12 May 1875 in Seeley&#x27;s Bay, Ontario. The county borders on New York State.
His parents were David and Annie (Jarrell) Johnston, both citizens of the United States. He attended elementary school in Seeley&#x27;s Bay, then in 1888 his parents took him to the United States. In 1890 he returned to Ontario to attend business college at Brockville. He left the college in 1891.
On 18 September 1892 he was hired by the Great Northern Railway as a callboy.
He also worked as a wiper, and then was a locomotive engineer from 1897 to 1909.
From 1909 to 1918 he was general chairman of the Great Northern Division of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE).

At the brotherhood&#x27;s triennial convention in June 1924 the new office of President was created, and the former grand chief engineer Warren Stanford Stone was elected to this position. He was succeeded as grand chief engineer by L. G. Gritting. William B. Prenter was made first vice-president in charge of finance and H. T. Dougherty was made second vice-president in charge of insurance and pension departments. Stone remained overall leader of the Brotherhood.
Stone died in 1925 and was succeeded by Prenter.
In the reshuffle, Johnston became grand chief engineer.

Around this time an audit found that the Brotherhood&#x27;s cooperative bank in New York had about $1 million of &quot;doubtful paper&quot; and other investments were also in poor shape. The executives decided to attempt a high-risk investment to make good the losses before the 91,000 union members learned of the problem.
After some hesitations, they agreed to buy of land in Venice, Florida, for $4 million, planning to develop it as a profitable resort.
Much work was done, but the project and others launched at that time drained funds and forced the Brotherhood to sell valuable assets.

In March 1927 Prenter was warned by the Brotherhood&#x27;s attorneys that &quot;There has been no estimate of the amount needed for expenditures in the Florida venture ... no provision that it is properly financed.&quot; Prenter ignored calls to take immediate action. At the triennial convention in Cleveland on 6 June 1927 the delegates learned of the mismanagement and losses and threw Prenter and other members of the executive out of office.
Johnston was selected to replace Prenter.

==Union leader==

Johnston became the sole leader of the union in 1927, with the titles of president, vice president, and secretary eliminated.
Through his efforts the Brotherhood&#x27;s finances were set in order and eventually the union again became solvent.

In the spring of 1929 industrial production began to decline in the United States, signalling the start of the ten-year-long Great Depression. 
The economy continued to contract for several years. Banks closed and many workers lost their jobs.
Freight traffic decreased and there was a steady drop of employment on the railroads. Daniel Willard, President of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, met with other leaders of his industry who agreed that the Interstate Commerce Commission had to approve higher freight rates and the unions had to accept wage cuts if the railroads were to stay solvent.
In October 1931 Willard arranged for Johnston and the heads of the other main railroad operating brotherhoods to dine with him and the presidents of three railroads in Manhattan. He found the labor leaders willing to talk about the possibility of wage cuts.

In October 1932 Johnston was a member of a Presidential committee that endorsed President Herbert Hoover&#x27;s New Deal program to stimulate the economy, and called for additional spending on public works.
In 1934 Johnston was convicted of mishandling the funds of the Standard Trust Bank of Cleveland, which had failed. 
The bank was partly owned by the BLE and he was the chairman.
Johnston&#x27;s conviction was overturned on appeal on the grounds that he was not aware of what was being done.

Johnston and Alexander F. Whitney, head of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, often worked together.
They backed Harry S. Truman in his 1940 Senate race, putting up most of the money for his campaign,
and in Chicago in 1944 campaigned to make him vice-presidential candidate in Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s campaign for re-election.
Truman was a long-time friend of Whitney but disliked Johnston, whom he called a &quot;damned Republican.&quot;
In 1943, during World War II (1939-1945), the government seized the railroads.
Johnston and Whitney were made labor consultants.
Johnston also represented the railroad union of the Combined War Labor Board.

Johnston was a Republican. He endorsed Thomas E. Dewey for President in 1944 and 1948 for his welfare program and opposition to communism.
In 1950 he endorsed Senator Robert A. Taft, co-author of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, for reelection, citing his opposition to Truman and to communism. Most union leaders were against Taft because of his position on Labor.

Towards the end of 1945 Johnston and the leaders of the other main railroad unions demanded pay increases and a forty-hour work week from the railroad companies, in line with other industries. Negotiations stalled in January 1946. Three of the unions were willing to suspend their demands, but Johnston and Whitney called a strike of the Engineers and Trainmen to start on 16 March 1946. President Truman set up a board to hear the grievances and make recommendations. 
Negotiations broke down in April, and Johnston and Whitney set 18 May 1946 as the strike date.
Whitney&#x27;s union represented 211,000 trainmen and the BLE represented 78,000 engineers. 
They could halt all railway traffic nationwide.
Truman felt betrayed, writing on 17 May 1946 &quot;Lewis, Whitney, Johnston, Murray and all other labor leaders made me certain promises when I took over. 
They all lied to me.&quot;

The day before the walkout was due Truman seized the railroads by executive order. Johnston and Whitney again agreed to postpone the strike for five days. 
However, after hearing Truman&#x27;s compromise pay offer their members voted to go on strike on 23 May 1946.
The strike stranded travelers, prevented movement of perishable goods and caused concern that many people in war-devastated Europe would starve if grain shipments were delayed. 
Truman broadcast an appeal to the strikers to return to work, saying &quot;It is inconceivable that in our democracy any two men should be placed in a position where they can completely stifle our economy and ultimately destroy our country.&quot; He threatened to call out the army to end the strike.
On 25 May Truman was addressing Congress, calling for drastic anti-strike legislation, 
when word came that the strikers had accepted his terms and the strike had ended.

==Retirement==

<text>Jules Eugène Louis Jouvet (; 24 December 1887 – 16 August 1951) was a French actor, theatre director and filmmaker.

== Early life ==
Jouvet was born in Crozon. He had a stutter as a young man and originally trained as a pharmacist. He received an advanced degree in pharmacy in 1913, though he never actually practiced, instead pursuing a career in theatre.:91

== Career ==
Jouvet was &#x27;refused three times by the &quot;Conservatoire&quot;&#x27; in Paris before being accepted to Jacques Copeau&#x27;s Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier as a stage manager in 1913.:345 Copeau&#x27;s training included a varied and demanding schedule, regular exercise for agility and stamina, and pressing his cast and crew to invent theatrical effects in a bare-bones space. It was there Jouvet developed his considerable stagecraft skills, particularly makeup and lighting (he developed a kind of accent light named the &quot;jouvet&quot;). These years included a successful tour to the United States.

While influential, Copeau&#x27;s theater was never lucrative and Jouvet left in October 1922 for the Comédie des Champs-Élysées (the small stage of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées). He was made director of the theatre in 1924. In December 1923 he staged his single most successful production, the satire &quot;Dr. Knock&quot;, written by Jules Romains.:92 His characterization of the manipulative crank doctor was informed by his own experience in pharmacy school. It became his signature and his standby; he produced it &#x27;almost every year until the end of his life&#x27;. Jouvet remained at the Comédie until 1934, when he moved to the Théâtre de l&#x27;Athénée due to the high overhead of running a theatre troupe at the Comédie.:92 He served as director of the Théâtre from 1934 through his death in 1951.:92

In 1927, he formed &quot;Le Cartel des Quatre&quot; [The Cartel of Four] with Charles Dullin, Gaston Baty (1885–1952), and Georges Pitoëff.:80 The Cartel was &#x27;an artistic and economic alliance in opposition to academic and commercial theatre&#x27;,:178 and the directors did not share a specific &#x27;aesthetic movement&#x27;.:80

In 1928 he began an ongoing collaboration with playwright Jean Giraudoux, beginning with a radical streamlining of Giraudoux&#x27;s &quot;Siegfried et le Limousin&quot; (1922). Their work together included the first staging of &quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot; in 1945.

Jouvet starred in some 34 films, including two recordings of &quot;Dr. Knock&quot;, once in 1933 and again in 1951. He was professor at the French National Academy of Dramatic Arts.

== Death ==
He died 16 August 1951 in his dressing room at the Théâtre de l&#x27;Athénée after having a heart attack. Jouvet is buried in the Montmartre Cemetery in Paris. The Athénée theatre now bears his name.:92

== Relatives ==
French-Argentine actor Maurice Jouvet (1923–1999) was his nephew.

British actor Peter Wyngarde has claimed Jouvet as his maternal uncle, but Jouvet&#x27;s immediate family tree does not confirm this.

== Legacy ==
Pixar paid homage to Jouvet by basing the appearance of the character Anton Ego in &quot;Ratatouille&quot; (2007) on him.

== Theatre ==
* 1931: original production of &quot;Judith&quot;, written by Jean Giraudoux, at the Théâtre Pigalle
* 1935: original production of &quot;The Trojan War Will Not Take Place&quot;, written by Jean Giraudoux, starring Jouvet as Hector, also starring Madeleine Ozeray, at the Athénée in Paris
* 1947: directed the première of Jean Genet&#x27;s &quot;The Maids&quot; at the Athénée in Paris on 17 April.
* 1951: directed the première of Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s &quot;The Devil and the Good Lord&quot; at the Théâtre-Antoine in Paris on 7 June.

<doc id="765962" wikidata="Q230159" url="?curid=765962" title="Jane Darwell">
<text>Jane Darwell (born Patti Woodard; October 15, 1879 – August 13, 1967) was an American actress of stage, film, and television. With appearances in more than 100 major movies spanning half a century, Darwell is perhaps best remembered for her poignant portrayal of the matriarch and leader of the Joad family in the film adaptation of John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, for which she received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early life==
Born to William Robert Woodard, president of the Louisville Southern Railroad, and Ellen Booth Woodard in Palmyra, Missouri, Darwell originally intended to become a circus rider, then later an opera singer. Her father, however, objected to those career plans, so she compromised by becoming an actress, changing her name to Darwell to avoid sullying the family name.

The Jane Darwell Birthplace was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

Some sources give Darwell&#x27;s birth name as Patti Woodward.

==Career==

Darwell studied voice culture and the piano, followed by dramatics. At one point, she decided to enter a convent, then changed her mind and became an actress. She began acting in theater productions in Chicago and made her first film appearance in 1913. She appeared in almost 20 films over the next two years, then returned to the stage. After a 15-year absence from films, she appeared in &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; (1930), and her career as a Hollywood character actress began. Short, stout and plain, she was quickly cast in a succession of films, usually as the mother of one of the main characters. She also appeared in five Shirley Temple films, usually as the housekeeper or grandmother.

She won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress as Ma Joad in &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1940), a role she was given at the insistence of Henry Fonda, the film&#x27;s star. A contract player with 20th Century Fox, Darwell was memorably cast in &quot;The Ox-Bow Incident&quot;, and occasionally starred in B movies and played featured parts in scores of major films.

Darwell had noted appearances on the stage as well; in 1944, she was popular in the stage comedy &quot;Suds in Your Eye&quot;, in which she played an Irishwoman who had inherited a junkyard.

By the end of her career, she had appeared in more than 170 films, including &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; (1931), &quot;Jesse James&quot; (1939), &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; (1941), &quot;The Ox-Bow Incident&quot; (1943), and &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; (1946).

On the television front, Darwell was among the guest stars on an episode of &quot;Faye Emerson&#x27;s Wonderful Town&quot;, a variety series that aired on CBS from 1951 to 1952 in which hostess Faye Emerson visits a different city each week to accent the local music. In 1954, Darwell appeared with Andy Clyde in the episode &quot;Santa&#x27;s Old Suit&quot; of the series &quot;The Pepsi-Cola Playhouse&quot;. This same episode was re-run the following Christmas 1955 on &quot;Studio 57&quot;. In 1959, she appeared with child actor Roger Mobley in the episode &quot;Mr. Rush&#x27;s Secretary&quot; on &quot;Buckskin&quot;, starring Tom Nolan and Sally Brophy. That same year she appeared in the TV Western series &quot;Wagon Train&quot; as “Mrs. Anderson” in the S2E23 episode “The Vivian Carter Story”. She guest starred on John Bromfield&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Sheriff of Cochise&quot;.

On July 27, 1961, Darwell appeared as Grandmother McCoy in an episode of the sitcom &quot;The Real McCoys&quot;. In the story, the series characters played by Walter Brennan, Richard Crenna, and Kathleen Nolan return to fictitious Smokey Corners, West Virginia for Grandmother McCoy&#x27;s 100th birthday gathering. Darwell was 15 years older than &quot;son&quot; Walter Brennan. Pat Buttram and Henry Jones appeared in this episode as Cousin Carl and Jed McCoy, respectively.

On February 8, 1960, Darwell received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to the motion-picture industry; it is located at 6735 Hollywood Boulevard. 

In her mid-eighties, Darwell was semi-retired from acting, other than a rare television guest appearance. She had recently moved into the Motion Picture Country Home because of her advanced age and feebleness. When Disney offered her the role of the Bird Woman in &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964), Darwell declined the role. Walt Disney, still insistent, personally drove to the retirement home to plead with her and she agreed to take the part. 
But it was her last acting role. In this pivotal scene in the movie, the Bird Woman at the steps of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral Square sells bags of bread crumbs to passers-by to feed the pigeons. The &quot;poignant&quot; song &quot;Feed the Birds&quot; was sung by Julie Andrews, as a hymn-like lullaby.

==Death==

3 years after &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; was released, during her last years, Darwell was in poor health. She died on August 13, 1967, at the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital from a myocardial infarction at the age of 87.

<text>Stanley King (May 11, 1883 – April 28, 1951) was the eleventh president of Amherst College. He held that position from 1932 to 1946.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Stanley N. King was born at Troy, Rensselaer County, New York on May 11, 1883, the son of Judge Henry Amasa King (Amherst College, 1873 and Columbia Law School, 1877) a justice of Superior Court of Massachusetts and Maria Lyon Flynt. He died on April 28, 1951, at his summer home on Chilmark, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Dukes County, Massachusetts, and is buried in Amherst, Massachusetts. He was the grandson of Dwight King and Martha Vinton and William N. Flynt and Eudocia Carter Converse. He had two siblings. A sister, Carrie, born on March 15, 1885, was a graduate of Miss Porter&#x27;s School in 1904. She died on December 25, 1921. Ames King, Stanley&#x27;s brother, was born on June 10, 1892, and lived for only a few days.

===Education===
King graduated from Springfield High School in Springfield, Massachusetts. He entered Amherst College in 1900 graduating summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1903. He was a brother of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Sigma chapter) at Amherst. He graduated from Harvard Law School (completing the course in the abnormally short space of two years), and was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar in 1906.

===Marriage and family===
He married on December 12, 1906, at Springfield, Massachusetts, Gertrude Louisa Besse, the daughter of Lyman Waterman Besse and Henrietta Louisa Segee. She was born on 22 Apr 1881 at Bridgeport, Connecticut, and died on April 10, 1923, at Boston, Massachusetts. She was a 1903 graduate of Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York and received her Master of Arts Degree from Radcliffe College in 1910. Her father, Lyman Waterman Besse, owned an extensive chain of clothing stores in the Northeast known as &quot;The Besse System.&quot;

Stanley and Gertrude were the parents of three children: Richard King (1913–1994), Amherst College Class of 1935; Harvard Law School 1935–1936. He married as his first wife, Elinor Stewart Gates, the granddaughter of Frederick Taylor Gates; He married his second wife Alice Gillette Epps Hotchkiss. She had 2 sons from her previous marriage. She survived him. Gertrude King (1916–1969), Vassar College class of 1938, married Roger Wolcott Toll Jr., son of mountaineer and former Yellowstone National Park superintendent Roger Wolcott Toll, June 25, 1952. They had two children. They divorced Feb 22, 1962. and Margaret King (1917–1923).

After his first wife Gertrude&#x27;s death, Stanley married in 1927 Mrs. Margaret Pinckney Jackson-Allen, who married as her first husband, Arthur Moulton Allen of Providence, Rhode Island. She died in 1967.

Gertrude Louisa Besse&#x27;s sister, Florence Foster Besse, a 1907 Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Wellesley College married Kingman Brewster Sr., a 1906 Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Amherst College and a 1911 graduate of the Harvard Law School. He was a direct lineal descendant of Elder William Brewster (pilgrim), (c. 1567 – April 10, 1644), the Pilgrim colonist leader and spiritual elder of the Plymouth Colony and a passenger on the Mayflower. They were the parents of Kingman Brewster, Jr., (June 17, 1919 – November 8, 1988) an educator, president of Yale University, and American diplomat.

===Career===
After graduating from Harvard Law School, he was employed as secretary and a director of the W. H. McElwain Co., a shoe manufacturer in Boston, Massachusetts; he was made vice-president of the company in 1919.

He was a member of the Committee on Supplies on the Council of National Defense in 1917. He was a special assistant to Secretary of War, Newton Diehl Baker, Jr. in 1917. He was elected Director of the Boston Chamber of Commerce, serving for 2 years. in 1919 he became secretary of President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Industrial Conference Board working directly with Herbert Hoover and Owen D. Young. He was elected a trustee of Amherst College in 1922.

From 1922 to 1927 he was Eastern Manager and Director of the International Shoe Company, Boston. In 1927 he retired from business. In 1932, after traveling extensively for several years, King was appointed the 11th President of Amherst College – the first in the institution&#x27;s history to have been neither a minister nor educator.

===Amherst years===
The following said about Stanley King after being appointed president: Said Newton D. Baker: &quot;Stanley King&#x27;s love of life, his knowledge of youth, his happiness and integrity are all qualities which will make him a great example as a college president. . . . The highest qualification for a college presidency is that the students should desire to be like the president. I can imagine few people whom it would be more wholesome to be like than him.&quot;

Said President Ernest Martin Hopkins of Amherst&#x27;s rival, Dartmouth College: &quot;My respect has continued and grown for the scope of his intellectual interest and for the quality of his thinking in regard to political and social problems.&quot;

As President of Amherst, King was instrumental in developing the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C., into one of the most important libraries of its kind. He also took a great interest in the buildings and grounds of the Amherst campus: the College recovered from the destruction caused by a major hurricane in 1938 by the introduction of new landscaping and the unprecedented construction of new buildings.

Under King&#x27;s administration the campus saw the addition of such buildings as Alumni Gymnasium, Valentine Hall, Memorial Field, Kirby Theatre, James and Stearns dormitories, and the Mead Art Building. These new buildings reflected King&#x27;s vision of the dimensions of education and college life. In fact his vision encompassed the establishment of a school to address the educational needs of the children of the Faculty; he solicited a benefaction from his friend and Amherst graduate, James Turner (Class of 1880), for the construction of The Little Red Schoolhouse
. In the 1930s, President King led the College through the crisis of the Great Depression by achieving financial solutions that enabled Amherst to avoid annual deficits or reductions in salary. The disruptions of World War II, 1941–1945, were handled with similar effectiveness with a long-range focus on developing a &quot;New Curriculum&quot; for the College to meet modern post-war needs.

After retiring as President in 1946, he was President Emeritus until his death in 1951. The Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College holds his papers.

<text>Joseph Palmer Knapp (May 14, 1864 – January 30, 1951) was an American publisher and philanthropist. He was Chairman of the Board and principal shareholder of the Crowell-Collier Publishing Company. Knapp has also been credited with the invention of the multi-color six-cylinder press.

He was the son of Joseph Fairchild and Phoebe Palmer Knapp. His father was a past president of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and his mother was a hymn writer, credited with over 500 hymns, most notably &quot;Blessed Assurance&quot; with Fanny Crosby.

He was educated at Columbia College, matriculating with the class of 1884, but left after a year to become a member of the board in his father&#x27;s company.

In 1892, Knapp founded the American Lithographic Co., which became a leading printer of Sunday magazines for newspapers. (The company later became Publication Corporation, which eventually owned a number of Knapp publishing properties.)

Knapp published the &quot;Associated Sunday Magazine&quot; from 1903 to 1905.

In 1906, Knapp and partner George Hazen purchased the Crowell Publishing Company of Springfield, Ohio, incorporating it in New Jersey. Crowell published the family magazines &quot;Farm &amp; Fireside&quot; and &quot;Woman&#x27;s Home Companion&quot;.

Knapp&#x27;s &quot;Every Week&quot;, published between 1915 and 1918, reached a circulation of more than 550,000.

In 1919, Knapp acquired P.F. Collier &amp; Son, a New York-based publisher of books and magazines, including Collier&#x27;s. He merged P.F. Collier &amp; Son with the Crowell Publishing Company in 1939, and served as chairman of the merged firm, the Crowell-Collier Publishing Company, until 1946.

Knapp was publisher of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune Sunday Magazine&quot; in 1935 when he changed its name and began to syndicate it to other newspapers as the Sunday supplement &quot;This Week&quot;. In the early 1950s, it accompanied 37 Sunday newspapers. (After Knapp&#x27;s death, at its peak in 1963, &quot;This Week&quot; was distributed with the Sunday editions of 42 newspapers for a total circulation of 14.6 million.)

Knapp owned a hunting lodge in North Carolina known as Mackay Island. This property is now national wildlife refuge.

== Philanthropy ==
Knapp was interested in game bird conservation, and in 1937 founded the More Game Birds in America Foundation (with others including J. P. Morgan), which today is known as Ducks Unlimited.

He contributed greatly to the Currituck County Schools in North Carolina and to the University of North Carolina. Currituck County dedicated one of their public schools to Knapp. This school is currently the J.P. Knapp Early College High School, which was founded in 2008.

<text>A water dog is a type of gundog bred to flush and retrieve game from water. Water dogs are considered the progenitors of most modern retriever dog breeds.

==Description==

Water dogs are usually medium-sized, active dogs; their most distinctive feature are their tight waterproof coats and their strong desire to swim. Traditionally many long haired water dogs breeds have their coats clipped with a bare midriff and hindquarters to assist in swimming by reducing drag, whilst retaining a long coat around their torso to prevent thermal shock when jumping into freezing water. This classic clip is seen to this day in dog shows with some breeds such as Poodles retaining a variation of this clip. Paintings by artists like Francisco Goya and Albrecht Durer in the 15th century depict early Standard Poodles, which were used for retrieving bird games from water. 

==History==
Water dogs are an ancient type of dog, used by ancient mariners to retrieve objects lost overboard as well as to pass messages between boats, they were known to the Romans who called them &quot;lion dogs&quot; after the distinctive clipping of their coats. Water dogs continued to be seen aboard ships until modern times. They were known to be prevalent in the Spanish Armada and could still be seen through to the 20th century aboard fishing vessels, particularly in the waters around Spain and Portugal.

In addition to their roles as ships&#x27; dogs, in Medieval Europe water dogs were used quite widely by hunters to retrieve ducks from water that had been shot with a bow and arrows, as well as the arrows and bolts that had missed their mark.

With the invention of modern firearms the need for dogs to retrieve arrows disappeared and many of the European water dogs breeds became predominantly ornamental, such as the poodle, whilst others adapted into modern gundogs, like the Wetterhoun. It is believed that water dogs were used, along with other types, in the breeding of most modern retriever breeds.

<doc id="765970" wikidata="Q5252320" url="?curid=765970" title="Dehn twist">
<text>In geometric topology, a branch of mathematics, a Dehn twist is a certain type of self-homeomorphism of a surface (two-dimensional manifold).

==Definition==
Suppose that &quot;c&quot; is a simple closed curve in a closed, orientable surface &quot;S&quot;. Let &quot;A&quot; be a tubular neighborhood of &quot;c&quot;. Then &quot;A&quot; is an annulus, homeomorphic to the Cartesian product of a circle and a unit interval &quot;I&quot;: 

:formula_1

Give &quot;A&quot; coordinates (&quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) where &quot;s&quot; is a complex number of the form formula_2 with formula_3 and . 

Let &quot;f&quot; be the map from &quot;S&quot; to itself which is the identity outside of &quot;A&quot; and inside &quot;A&quot; we have

:formula_4

Then &quot;f&quot; is a Dehn twist about the curve &quot;c&quot;. 

Dehn twists can also be defined on a non-orientable surface &quot;S&quot;, provided one starts with a 2-sided simple closed curve &quot;c&quot; on &quot;S&quot;.

==Example==

Consider the torus represented by a fundamental polygon with edges &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;

:formula_5

Let a closed curve be the line along the edge &quot;a&quot; called formula_6.

Given the choice of gluing homeomorphism in the figure, a tubular neighborhood of the curve formula_6 will look like a band linked around a doughnut. This neighborhood is homeomorphic to an annulus, say 
:formula_8

in the complex plane.

By extending to the torus the twisting map formula_9 of the annulus, through the homeomorphisms of the annulus to an open cylinder to the neighborhood of formula_6, yields a Dehn twist of the torus by &quot;a&quot;.

:formula_11

This self homeomorphism acts on the closed curve along &quot;b&quot;. In the tubular neighborhood it takes the curve of &quot;b&quot; once along the curve of &quot;a&quot;.

A homeomorphism between topological spaces induces a natural isomorphism between their fundamental groups. Therefore one has an automorphism

:formula_12

where [&quot;x&quot;] are the homotopy classes of the closed curve &quot;x&quot; in the torus. Notice formula_13 and formula_14, where formula_15 is the path travelled around &quot;b&quot; then &quot;a&quot;.

==Mapping class group==

It is a theorem of Max Dehn that maps of this form generate the mapping class group of isotopy classes of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of any closed, oriented genus-formula_16 surface. W. B. R. Lickorish later rediscovered this result with a simpler proof and in addition showed that Dehn twists along formula_17 explicit curves generate the mapping class group (this is called by the punning name &quot;Lickorish twist theorem&quot;); this number was later improved by Stephen P. Humphries to formula_18, for formula_19, which he showed was the minimal number. 

Lickorish also obtained an analogous result for non-orientable surfaces, which require not only Dehn twists, but also &quot;Y-homeomorphisms.&quot;

<text>Coker University is a private university in Hartsville, South Carolina, United States. It was founded in 1908 and is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Coker&#x27;s sports teams, nicknamed the Cobras, compete in NCAA Division II.

==History==
Coker University began in 1894 as &quot;Welsh Neck High School&quot;, founded by a local businessman and American Civil War veteran, Major James Lide Coker. In 1908, when South Carolina created a statewide public school system, Coker led the effort to convert the school to &quot;Coker College for Women&quot;. Davidson Hall and Memorial Hall are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Coker was once affiliated with the South Carolina Baptist Convention, but has been non-denominational since 1944. It officially became co-educational in 1969, although men had attended since World War II&#x27;s end.

The South Carolina Governor&#x27;s School for Science and Mathematics was located on the Coker campus from its founding in 1988 until 2003 when it moved to a purpose-built campus nearby.

Effective July 1, 2019, Coker College adopted the name Coker University.

===Presidents===
*James Lide Coker
*E. V. Baldy (1909–1911)
*Arthur Jackson Hall (1911–1914)
*Howard Lee Jones (1914–1915)
*E. Walter Sikes (1916–1925)
*Carlyle Campbell (1925–1936)
*C. Sylvester Green (1936–1944)
*Donald C. Agnew (1944–1952)
*Joseph C. Robert (1952–1955)
*John A. Barry, Jr. (1955–1959)
*Fenton Keyes (1960–1968)
*Wilfrid H. Callcott (1968–1969)
*Gus Turbeville (1969–1974)
*C. Hilburn Womble (1975–1980)
*James D. Daniels (1981–2002)
*B. James Dawson (2002–2009)
*Robert L. Wyatt (2009–2019)
*Natalie Harder (2020- )

==Academics==

Coker refers to the academic program for the four-year undergraduate degree as the Trans4mations Program, with the first year being foundational, the second year requiring service and attendance at cultural events, the third year requiring at least two weeks of study off-campus, and the final year called a &quot;capstone&quot;. The Liberal Arts Studies Program (LASP) is divided into Core Skills, Knowledge of the Arts, Knowledge of the Behavioral Sciences, Knowledge of the Humanities, Knowledge of the Natural Sciences, Knowledge of the United States, and Knowledge of the Wider World.

Coker offers 29 majors and 23 minors of study. The college also offers individual majors and double majors, self-designated degree programs, specializations, and pre-professional programs.

==Campus==

The main campus contains mostly Georgian-style brick buildings, some of which (such as Davidson Hall, home to the college&#x27;s round table classrooms) are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Alumni House (Drengaelen), The President&#x27;s House, The Dean&#x27;s and President&#x27;s Offices (David and May Coker House), and The Registrar&#x27;s Offices (Lawton-Wilson House) are all located in old mansions along the northern edge of campus.

Hartsville and Coker University owe much to the generosity of the Coker family, founders of Sonoco and Coker&#x27;s Pedigreed Seed Company. The Coker family&#x27;s patronage of the college has led to the vast majority of buildings on campus having Coker somewhere in the name. Students often joke to freshmen or visitors that they&#x27;ll meet them &quot;in the Coker&quot; building as a way to gently initiate newcomers to campus.

===Residence halls===

On-campus residence halls include Memorial (1914), Belk (1916), Coker (1916), Grannis (1969), and JLC (2009). Coker University’s Village at Byerly Place, consisting of George and Sullivan Halls opened in 2013. In 2011, Coker opened the Coker Downtown Lofts and in 2012 the Downtown Flats, both located in downtown Hartsville.

===Library===
In January 2008, the Charles W. and Joan S. Coker Library-Information Technology Center opened. The library was built using donations from a capital campaign. The former James Lide Coker Memorial Library is now a residence hall.

==Athletics==
Adjacent to the main campus is a athletics complex with baseball, softball, soccer, and tennis facilities. Near the athletics complex is the DeLoach Center, which contains a 1,908-seat gymnasium, an auxiliary gym, interactive classrooms, a student-athlete-only weight room, a fitness center, athletic offices, and more.

Coker has 21 varsity athletics programs, which primarily compete in The South Atlantic Conference. Sponsored programs include baseball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, women&#x27;s field hockey, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, softball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track and field (indoor and outdoor) women&#x27;s volleyball, and men&#x27;s wrestling. The Cobras also host a spirit squad.

In the 2013 season, the Coker baseball team won the Conference Carolinas Tournament title, earned the team&#x27;s first-ever postseason bid, won the NCAA Southeast Regional, and advanced to the NCAA DII Baseball National Championship. They finished the year with a record of 38–16.

<text>sRGB is a standard numerical encoding of colors, based on the RGB (red, green, blue) color model, for use on monitors, printers, and the World Wide Web. It was initially proposed by HP and Microsoft in 1996 and became an official standard of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) as IEC 61966-2-1:1999. It is the current defined standard colorspace for the web, and it is usually the assumed colorspace for images that are neither tagged for a colorspace nor have an embedded color profile.

The sRGB standard uses the same color primaries and white point as the ITU-R BT.709 standard for HDTV, but a different transfer function (or gamma) compatible with the era&#x27;s CRT displays, and assumes a viewing environment closer to typical home and office viewing conditions.

The sRGB color space is also the basis of the [[sYCC]] color encoding, which is a remapping of the R, G, and B components of sRGB to a luminance (brightness) value formula_1 and two chroma channels similar to those of the CIE YCbCr encoding.

== sRGB definition ==

===Gamut===
The sRGB standard defines the chromaticities of the red, green, and blue primaries, the colors where one of the three channels is nonzero and the other two are zero. The gamut of chromaticities that can be represented in sRGB is the color triangle defined by these primaries, which are set such that the range of colors inside the triangle is well within the range of colors visible to a human with normal trichromatic vision. As with any RGB color space, for non-negative values of R, G, and B it is not possible to represent colors outside this triangle.

The primaries come from HDTV (ITU-R BT.709), which are somewhat different from those for older color TV systems (ITU-R BT.601). These values were chosen to reflect the approximate color of consumer CRT phosphors at the time of its design. Since flat-panel displays at the time were generally designed to emulate CRT characteristics, the values also reflected prevailing practice for other display devices as well.

=== Transfer function (&quot;gamma&quot;) ===


The sRGB standard specifies a non-linear encoding of physical brightness values (proportional to luminous power emitted per unit of area) into the integer R, G, and B values that are to be stored in computer memory or image files. This transfer function commonly called gamma encoding, is the combination of a linear function at low brightness values and a displaced power law for the rest of the range.

Specifically, let formula_2 be the encoded R, G, or B value, assumed to be an integer ranging from 0 (meaning no light) to some maximum formula_3 (meaning the maximum displayable intensity of that channel). Typically formula_3 is 255 when formula_2 as an 8-bit integer, or generally formula_6 for an formula_7-bit integer. The physical intensity represented by formula_2 is defined as formula_9, where the decoding function formula_10 is defined as
:formula_11
The result is 0 for no light, and 1 for the maximum intensity. The value formula_9 is sometimes called the &quot;linear value&quot; or &quot;linear-light value&quot; corresponding to the encoded sample formula_2.
Conversely, given a value formula_14 between 0 and 1 that is proportional to the physical R, G, or B intensity to be displayed, the encoded integer intensity will be formula_15, where encoding function formula_16 is defined as
:formula_17
These sRGB encoding and decoding functions formula_10 and formula_16 above are similar in form to those of BT.709, but the values are noticeably different. Because of the rounding of the parameters, they have small discontinuities at the transition between the linear and non-linear part, on the order of 10−8 — which are too small to matter in most practical situations.

For medium and large values of the argument formula_20, the decoding function formula_10 is actually quite close to a pure power law with exponent (gamma) of 2.2. However, for low values (around and below the breakpoint formula_22) the difference is perceptible.

If needed, the encoding and decoding functions formula_10, formula_16 can be used for arguments greater than 1. They are also extended to negative values by the identities formula_25, formula_26.

In practice, there is still debate and confusion about the formulas used for encoding and decoding image colors from or into &quot;sRGB&quot; files. Also, programmers may choose use the &quot;pure&quot; power law formula_27 instead of the correct piecewise formulas above, for the sake of code simplicity or efficiency, but that would introduce some issues near black. Also, some operating systems and programs may directly send sRGB encoded images to monitors which actually have a different effective decoding function, such as pure power law with 2.2 exponent, this is further complicated by the standard saying that reference CRT display should use 2.2 gamma.

===Correspondence to CIE XYZ stimulus===

The sRGB standard specifies also the colors and relative intensities of the three primaries R, G, and B, by defining the mapping between these values (in linear brightness scale, before the gamma encoding) and the CIE XYZ perceptual color coordinates. This mapping is the same specified by the BT.709 standard; in matrix notation,

:formula_28

These coefficients should be considered exact and assume the 2° standard colorimetric observer for CIE XYZ. In particular, the second row of this matrix specifies the computation of the BT.709-2 luma (brightness) value from the linear R, G, and B values. (BT.709-1 had a typo in these coefficients.)

The inverse conversion, from from CIE XYZ to (linear) sRGB, can be obtained by inverting the matrix above to a suitable numerical accuracy. The 1999 standard provides the matrix
:formula_29
which is not the exact inverse of the sRGB to XYZ transformation, but was expected to be accurate enough for 8-bit encoded samples (with formula_30).

The 2003 amended version of the sRGB standard points out that higher accuracy is needed when the samples are encoded with more than 8 bits. It provides the matrix
:formula_31.
which is claimed to be sufficiently accurate for samples with formula_32 bits (formula_33).

For these formulas, the &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot; values must be scaled so that the &quot;Y&quot; of D65 (&quot;white&quot;) is 1.0 (&quot;X&quot; = 0.9505, &quot;Y&quot; = 1.0000, &quot;Z&quot; = 1.0890). This is usually true but some color spaces use 100 or other values (such as in CIELAB, when using specified white points).

=== Viewing environment ===
The sRGB specification assumes a dimly lit encoding (creation) environment with an ambient correlated color temperature (CCT) of 5003 K:

The assumed ambient CCT differs from that of the BT.709 standard illuminant (D65), which is still retained for the screen white point. Using D50 for both would have made the white point of most photographic paper appear excessively blue. The other parameters, such as the luminance level, are representative of a typical CRT monitor.

For optimal results, the ICC recommends using the encoding viewing environment (i.e., dim, diffuse lighting) rather than the less-stringent typical viewing environment.

==The bg-sRGB space==

Annex G of the 2003 amendment of the sRGB standard describes an alternative encoding of color values, called bg-sRGB, that is recommended when the number of bits per channel formula_7 is 10 or more.

In this alternative encoding, an integer encoded sample value formula_2 and the corresponding linear R, G, or B value formula_14 are related by the formulas
:formula_37
and
:formula_38 
where the formula_10 and formula_16 functions are the same as in the sRGB space. The standard specifies formula_41 and formula_42 for formula_43, and generally 
:formula_44 
for formula_45.
In the bg-sRGB color space, the null intensity formula_46 is encoded as the integer formula_47, and the maximum displayable intensity formula_48 is encoded as the integer formula_49. This encoding is useful for color space manipulations (like the conversion from sYCC) that can generate values formula_14 that are negative or greater than 1.

==History==

The non-linear encoding of physical data samples is a common digital signal processing technique that aims to make better use of the bits available for the encoded signal, taking into account the non-linear way human senses perceive physical stimuli. Using smaller increments for smaller signals reduces the quantization artifacts.

This principle was incorporated into the digital-to-analog converters and the analog circuitry of early computer monitors, resulting in an effective decoding function (the mapping from digital sample values to the displayed intensity) which was roughly a power law with an exponent between 2 and 3. The exponent was commonly denoted with the letter formula_51, hence the common name &quot;gamma correction&quot; (or similar) for this function. This mapping initially varied according to CRT manufacturers, but was normalized in 1993 for use in HDTV systems, as the ITU BT.709 standard The BT.709 standard specified a decoding function with a linear section near zero, transitioning to a shifted power law with exponent 1/0.45 ≈ 2.2222...

The sRGB encoding was created a few years later by Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft. It was meant to describe the decoding function of most CRT computer monitors used with Windows operating systems at the time, which was still different from that assumed by BT.709. The first draft of the standard was published in 1996. A fourth draft, still incomplete, is available online. Like the BT.709, the sRGB decoding function was defined as a linear section near zero that transitions to a shifted power law 

=== Justification for the formulas ===

In theory, the parameters of the encoding and decoding functions should be chosen so that the transition from the linear section to the power law section is continuous (without a sudden step) and smooth (without a sudden change of slope).

To derive the decoding function, one considers that the general formula for a linear function, whose graph is a straight line that passes through , is formula_52, and a shifted power law curve that passes through is formula_53

To obtain a seamless transition between the two functions when formula_54 has a value formula_22, we must have

:formula_56

To avoid a sudden change of slope where the two segments meet, the derivatives must be equal at this point:

:formula_57

Solving the two equations for formula_22 and formula_59 we get
:formula_60

=== Parameter values ===

The first draft of the sRGB standard initially set the parameters at formula_61 and formula_62 so that the resulting decoding function formula_10 closely resembled a pure power law with exponent (gamma) 2.2, assimed to be typical of computer monitors at the time. This choice implies a breakpoint formula_64 and a linear coefficient formula_65. These values, rounded to formula_66 and formula_67 are still incorrectly given in some publications. However, the value of formula_59 was rounded to formula_69 already in the sRGB draft standard, resulting in a small discontinuity in the curve.

The first official version of the standard was defined and published by the IEC in 1999. In this version, the rounded value of formula_70 was retained, but the breakpoint formula_22 was redefined as formula_72 to make the curve approximately continuous. With these values, there is still a discontinuity in the slope, from formula_73 just below the intersection to formula_74 just above it. The final standard also corrected some small rounding errors present in the draft.

The 1999 IEC standard was amended in 2003. The sRGB to CIE XYZ matrix was retained, but the inverse transformation above was replaced by a more accurate version, with seven decimal fraction digits. The amended standard also included the definition of the sYCC encoding, using brightness (Y) and two chroma coordinates (CC) instead of R, G, and B coordinates, and a bg-sRGB encoding for 10-bit components which allows some component values outside the 0-1 range.

==Usage==
Due to the standardization of sRGB on the Internet, on computers, and on printers, many low- to medium-end consumer digital cameras and scanners use sRGB as the default (or only available) working color space. However, consumer-level CCDs are typically uncalibrated, meaning that even though the image or device is being labeled as &quot;sRGB&quot;, one cannot assume that the encoded values or the colors of displayed images are accurate as specified by the standard. Recently that changed and smartphones and TVs have very good calibration out of the box.

If the color space of an image is unknown and the R, G, and B samples are encoded with 8 bits each, the sRGB encoding usually the assumed default.

As the sRGB gamut mostly meets or exceeds the gamut of a low-end inkjet printer, an sRGB image is often regarded as satisfactory for home printing. The sRGB color space is sometimes avoided by high-end print publishing professionals because its color gamut is not big enough, especially in the blue-green colors, to include all the colors that can be reproduced in CMYK printing. Images intended for professional printing via a fully color-managed workflow (e.g. prepress output) sometimes use another color space such as Adobe RGB (1998), which accommodates a wider gamut and CMYK color space like Fogra39. Such CMYK and sRGB images used on the Internet may be converted to sRGB using color management tools that are usually included with software that works in these other color spaces.

===Programming interface support===

The two dominant programming interfaces for 3D graphics, OpenGL and Direct3D, have both incorporated support for the sRGB gamma curve. OpenGL supports textures with sRGB gamma encoded color components (first introduced with EXT_texture_sRGB extension, added to the core in OpenGL 2.1) and rendering into sRGB gamma encoded framebuffers (first introduced with EXT_framebuffer_sRGB extension, added to the core in OpenGL 3.0). Correct mipmapping and interpolation of sRGB gamma textures has direct hardware support in texturing units of most modern GPUs (for example nVidia GeForce 8 performs conversion from 8-bit texture to linear values before interpolating those values), and does not have any performance penalty.

===ICC profiles===

A lookup table may be used to efficiently convert sRGB to other color spaces. The International Color Consortium (ICC) has published color profiles for this purpose, which are widely used. There are several variants, including ICCmax, version 4, and version 2.

Version 4 is generally recommended, but version 2 is still commonly used and is the most compatible with other software including browsers. However, inconsistencies have been pointed out between those ICC profiles and the IEC sRGB standard. In particular, version 2 of the ICC profile specification does not implement the piecewise parametric curve encoding (&quot;para&quot;) as specified by the IEC sRGB standard, and has to implement the linear spline using 1DLUT. What is worse in some cases &quot;simplified sRGB&quot; is used which is just 2.2 gamma.

== The sYCC color space ==
Amendment 1 to IEC 61966-2-1:1999, approved in 2003, includes the definition of a Y′Cb′Cr′ color representation called sYCC. Although the RGB color primaries are based on BT.709, the equations for transformation from sRGB to sYCC and vice versa are based on BT.601. The sYCC standard specifies 8 bits for the encoded components, and the matrices result in a range of approximately 0–1 for Y; -0.5–0.5 for C.

As this conversion can result in sRGB values outside the range 0–1, the amendment describes how to apply the gamma correction to negative values, by applying when is negative (and is the sRGB↔linear functions described above). This is also used by scRGB.

<text>Frederick Alton Jewell (May 28, 1875, in Worthington, Indiana – February 11, 1936, in Worthington, Indiana), was a prolific musical composer who wrote over 100 marches and screamers, including:

&lt;br&gt;Fred Jewell

* &quot;Battle Royal&quot; (1909)
* &quot;Floto&#x27;s Triumph&quot; (1906)
* &quot;Quality Plus&quot; (1913)
*&quot;The Outlook&quot; (1913)
* &quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot; (1917)
* &quot;Supreme Triumph&quot; (1920)
* &quot;The Screamer&quot; (1921)
* &quot;The Old Circus Band&quot; (1923)

At the age of 16, Jewell ran away from home and joined the Gentry Bros. Dog &amp; Pony Show as a euphonium player. He also played the calliope.

After making excellent impressions with successful circus officials, Jewell rose through the ranks. He eventually landed himself as the leader of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus band (like Karl King, another successful American composer of his time). He also played in or directed the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus and the Sells-Floto Circus.

Jewell retired from circuses in 1918. He traveled to Iowa and took leadership of the Iowa Brigade Band. From there he began his own publishing company and moved back to his hometown, Worthington, and served as high school band director, as well as a steady composer of band music. He directed other local bands in Florida and Indiana also.

Frederick Jewell died in 1936 at the age of 61 in Worthington.

The Adobe RGB (1998) color space encompasses roughly 30% of the visible colors specified by the CIELAB color space – improving upon the gamut of the sRGB color space, primarily in cyan-green hues. It was subsequently standardized by the IEC as IEC 61966-2-5:1999 with a name opRGB (optional RGB color space) and is used in HDMI.

==Historical background==
Beginning in 1997, Adobe Systems was looking into creating ICC profiles that its consumers could use in conjunction with Photoshop&#x27;s new color management features. Since not many applications at the time had any ICC color management, most operating systems did not ship with useful profiles.

Lead developer of Photoshop, Thomas Knoll decided to build an ICC profile around specifications he found in the documentation for the SMPTE 240M standard, the precursor to Rec. 709 (but not in primaries: 240M also defined EOTF and thus was display referred, sRGB was created by connecting BT.470 PAL and SMPTE C). SMPTE 240M&#x27;s gamut is wider than that of the BT.709 gamut and the same as BT.470 NTSC (System B, G). However, with the release of Photoshop 5.0 nearing, Adobe made the decision to include the profile within the software.

Although users loved the wider range of reproducible colors, those familiar with the SMPTE 240M specifications contacted Adobe, informing the company that it had copied the values that described idealized primaries, not actual standard ones (in a special annex to the standard). The real values were much closer to sRGB&#x27;s, which avid Photoshop consumers did not enjoy as a working environment. To make matters worse, an engineer had made an error when copying the red primary chromaticity coordinates, resulting in an even more inaccurate representation of the SMPTE standard. On the other hand red and blue primary are the same as in PAL and green is the same as in NTSC 1953 (blue is the same as in BT.709 and sRGB).

Adobe tried numerous tactics to correct the profile, such as correcting the red primary and changing the white point to match that of the CIE Standard Illuminant D50 (though that will also change the primaries and is thus pointless), yet all of the adjustments made CMYK conversion worse than before. In the end, Adobe decided to keep the &quot;incorrect&quot; profile, but changed the name to &quot;Adobe RGB (1998)&quot; in order to avoid a trademark search or infringement.

==Specifications==

===Reference viewing conditions===
In Adobe RGB (1998), colors are specified as [&quot;R&quot;,&quot;G&quot;,&quot;B&quot;] triplets, where each of the &quot;R&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, and &quot;B&quot; components have values ranging between 0 and 1. When displayed on a monitor, the exact chromaticities of the reference white point [1,1,1], the reference black point [0,0,0], and the primaries ([1,0,0], [0,1,0], and [0,0,1]) are specified. To meet the color appearance requirements of the color space, the luminance of the monitor must be 160.00 cd/m2 at the white point, and 0.5557 cd/m2 at the black point, which implies a contrast ratio of 287.9. Moreover, the black point shall have the same chromaticity as the white point, yet with a luminance equal to 0.34731% of the white point luminance. The ambient illumination level at the monitor faceplate when the monitor is turned off must be 32 lx.

As with sRGB, the &quot;RGB&quot; component values in Adobe RGB (1998) are not proportional to the luminances. Rather, a gamma of approximately 2.2 is assumed, without the linear segment near zero that is present in sRGB. The precise gamma value is 563/256, or 2.19921875. In coverage of the CIE 1931 color space the Adobe RGB (1998) color space covers 52.1%.

The chromaticities of the primary colors and the white point, both of which correspond to the CIE Standard Illuminant D65, are as follows:
The corresponding absolute &quot;XYZ&quot; tristimulus values for the reference display white and black points are as follows:
Normalized &quot;XYZ&quot; tristimulus values can be obtained from absolute luminance &quot;XaYaZa&quot; tristimulus values as follows:
:formula_1
:formula_2
:formula_3
where &quot;XKYKZK&quot; and &quot;XWYWZW&quot; are reference display black and white points in the table above.

The conversion between normalized XYZ to and from Adobe RGB tristimulus values can be done as follows:

:formula_4

:formula_5
As was later defined in the IEC standard opYCC uses BT.601 matrix for conversion to YCbCr, that can be full range matrix and limited range matrix. Display can signal YCC quantization range support and sink can send either one.

===ICC PCS color image encoding===
An image in the ICC Profile Connection Space (PCS) is encoded in 24-bit Adobe RGB (1998) color image encoding. Through the application of the 3x3 matrix below (derived from the inversion of the color space chromaticity coordinates and a chromatic adaptation to CIE Standard Illuminant D50 using the Bradford transformation matrix), the input image&#x27;s normalized &quot;XYZ&quot; tristimulus values are transformed into &quot;RGB&quot; tristimulus values. The component values would be clipped to the range [0, 1].

:formula_6

The &quot;RGB&quot; tristimulus values are then converted to Adobe RGB &quot;R&#x27;G&#x27;B&quot;&#x27; component values through the use of the following component transfer functions:

:formula_7 formula_8 formula_9

The resulting component values would be then represented in floating point or integer encodings. If it is necessary to encode values from the PCS back to the input device space, the following matrix can be implemented:

:formula_10

==Comparison to sRGB==

===Gamut===

sRGB is an RGB color space proposed by HP and Microsoft in 1996 to approximate the color gamut of the (then) most common computer display devices (CRTs). Since sRGB serves as a &quot;best guess&quot; metric for how another person&#x27;s monitor produces color, it has become the standard color space for displaying images on the Internet. sRGB&#x27;s color gamut encompasses just 35% of the visible colors specified by CIE, whereas Adobe RGB (1998) encompasses slightly more than 50% of all visible colors. Adobe RGB (1998) extends into richer cyans and greens than does sRGB – for all levels of luminance. The two gamuts are often compared in mid-tone values (~50% luminance), but clear differences are evident in shadows (~25% luminance) and highlights (~75% luminance) as well. In fact, Adobe RGB (1998) expands its advantages to areas of intense orange, yellow, and magenta regions.

Although there is a significant difference between gamut ranges in the CIE &quot;xy&quot; chromaticity diagram, if the coordinates were to be transformed to fit on the CIE &quot;u′v′&quot; chromaticity diagram, which illustrates the eye&#x27;s perceived variance in hue more closely, the difference in the green region is far less exaggerated. Also, although Adobe RGB (1998) can &quot;theoretically&quot; represent a wider gamut of colors, the color space requires special software and a complex workflow in order to utilize its full range. Otherwise, the produced colors would be squeezed into a smaller range (making them appear duller) in order to match sRGB&#x27;s more widely used gamut.

===Bit depth distribution===
Although the Adobe RGB (1998) working space clearly provides more colors to utilize, another factor to consider when choosing between color spaces is how each space influences the distribution of the image&#x27;s bit depth. Color spaces with larger gamuts &quot;stretch&quot; the bits over a broader region of colors, whereas smaller gamuts concentrate these bits within a narrow region.

A similar, yet not as dramatic concentration of bit depth occurs with Adobe RGB (1998) versus sRGB, except in three dimensions rather than one. The Adobe RGB (1998) color space occupies roughly 40% more volume than the sRGB color space, which concludes that one would only be exploiting 70% of the available bit depth if the colors in Adobe RGB (1998) are unnecessary. On the contrary, one may have plenty of &quot;spare&quot; bits if using a 16-bit image, thus negating any reduction due to the choice of working space.

<text>Dallas Burton Phemister (; July 15, 1882 – December 28, 1951) was an American surgeon and researcher who gave his name to several medical terms. During his career, he was the president of the American Surgical Association and the American College of Surgeons, and was a member of the editorial board of the journal &quot;Annals of Surgery&quot;.

== Career ==
Phemister attained his MD from Rush Medical College in 1904, before conducting post-graduate study in Europe.

From its inception in 1920, he was involved with the Codman Registry of Bone Sarcoma, the oldest tumor registry in the United States. After its founder, Ernest Amory Codman, he was its second chair.

He was the first full-time professor and chairman of the Department of Surgery at the University of Chicago, which he led from 1925 to 1947. Early in his tenure there, he appointed Lester Dragstedt as an associate professor of surgery. In 1927, he invited Charles Brenton Huggins to join the University of Chicago faculty, specializing in urology. He also served as a mentor for orthopedic surgeon Lent C. Johnson. In 1938, William Adams and Phemister carried out a pioneering esophageal resection surgery. That same year, he was elected as the president of the American Surgical Association.

In the 1950s, several musculoskeletal investigators expressed a desire to have a forum for presenting their work and receiving constructive criticism. This idea gained unanimous support from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons at their Annual Meeting in 1951. Phemister agreed to take on the role of chairman of the new organization, named the Orthopaedic Research Society, but died unexpectedly at the age of 69 before he could take up the position. He died at the Billings Hospital in Chicago of appendicitis.

== Eponyms ==
Phemister&#x27;s name has been given to several medical techniques and signs. Most prominent among these is the Phemister graft, a technique for transplanting bone in cases of bone fractures with delayed union. The Phemister triad refers to three features typically seen in tuberculous arthritis: &quot;juxta-articular osteopenia or osteoporosis, peripheral osseous erosions, and gradual narrowing of joint spaces... present in any large joint including the knee, hip, and shoulder.&quot;

Dallas B. Phemister Hall, a student residence building at the University of Chicago built in 1958, was named for him. It was demolished in 2000 to make room for the Interdivisional Research Building.

<text>William Neal Reynolds (March 22, 1863 – September 10, 1951) was a U.S. sportsman and businessman with R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which was founded by his brother R. J. Reynolds.

==Early life==
Born in Patrick County, Virginia, Reynolds went to work for his brother in Winston-Salem, North Carolina in 1881 as he worked himself through Trinity College (later Duke University). From 1890 to 1940, Reynolds served as a director of Reynolds Co. He served as the first vice-president of the company until he took over the presidency in 1918.

==Chief executive of R.J. Reynolds==
Always called &quot;Mr. Will,&quot; Reynolds took over the presidency of the company after his brother&#x27;s death from cancer in 1918; he turned the presidency over in 1924 to Bowman Gray Sr. The company then turned from &quot;the dominance of its founder into the less personal sphere of corporate life.&quot; Reynolds became the first chairman of the board of directors of Reynolds Co. in 1924 until 1931 and then served as chairman of the board&#x27;s executive committee until 1941.

==Personal life==

Reynolds married Kate G. Bitting in 1889.

Reynolds was the first president of the Forsyth Country Club and commissioned a nine-hole golf course to be built. After eight years, in 1921, he brought in famed golf course designer Donald Ross to design an 18-hole course. In 1925, Reynolds founded another golf course, Roaring Gap, about an hour away from Winston-Salem and also designed by Ross.

R.J. Reynolds&#x27; widow Katharine died in 1924, and their four children were then raised by William Reynolds and his wife, Kate. Reynolds and Kate had no children of their own.

The youngest Reynolds child, Zachary Smith Reynolds, called &quot;Smith,&quot; was seven when his mother died. Smith died mysteriously of a gunshot wound to the head at his parents&#x27; estate, Reynolda House, on July 6, 1932. His pregnant wife, broadway starlet Libby Holman, and best friend Albert Walker were indicted for the murder, in a sensational case that garnered national attention. Reynolds contacted the district attorney and asked for the charges against his nephew&#x27;s alleged killers to be dropped; the prosecutor eventually did so for lack of evidence, and no trial on the matter was ever held. The Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation was established in Smith Reynolds&#x27; name by Smith Reynolds&#x27; siblings and by Reynolds. The foundation lured Wake Forest University away from its location away in Wake Forest, North Carolina, to establish a new campus on the grounds of Reynolda House and receive an annual endowment from the foundation.

Reynolds also built a hospital in Winston-Salem specifically for African-Americans, named the Kate Bitting Reynolds Memorial Hospital in honor of his wife. In honor of his mother, he founded the Nancy Reynolds School in Stokes County, North Carolina, and the Hardin Reynolds School in Patrick County, Virginia, to honor his father. The Kate B. Reynolds Trust uses one-fourth of the income collected each year from its more than two million shares of R.J. Reynolds Co. stock to help the &quot;poor and needy&quot; in Winston-Salem.

The Reynolds family donated $100,000 towards the construction of a coliseum at North Carolina State University. Because of this gift, it was named Reynolds Coliseum in his honor.

==Tanglewood==
Reynolds built a country estate on the Yadkin River near Winston-Salem, Tanglewood Park Arboretum and Rose Garden, and moved into it in 1921. Reynolds owned and bred Standardbred harness racing horses at Tanglewood for competition. In the racing season of 1909 to 1910, one of Reynolds&#x27; horses won 15 of 17 races conducted. He also owned interests in horse farms in Lexington, Kentucky, and Florida. Reynolds was active in the harness racing industry and was a member of the Grand Circuit, the Hambletonian Society, and a founding member and trustee of the Hall of Fame of the Trotter. In 1958 he was inducted as an Immortal into the Hall of Fame.

He eventually donated Tanglewood to Forsyth County for use as a park. Today, Tanglewood has three golf courses: an 18-hole par 3 course, the Reynolds Course, and the Championship Course, which hosted the 1974 PGA Championship and was the site of a Champions Tour event from 1987-2002. Tanglewood also has horseback riding, bicycling, swimming and boating.

<text>Samuel Doyle Riddle (July 1, 1861 – January 8, 1951) was an American businessman and racehorse owner. He was born in Glen Riddle, Pennsylvania, a small town in Delaware County southwest of Philadelphia, given the family name by his father Samuel Riddle. Samuel D. Riddle owned and operated a woolen mill started by his father, but is best known as a sportsman.

His father Samuel Riddle was born in Ireland and arrived in America in 1825. His mother was Lydia Doyle.

Samuel D. Riddle had a brother, Leander W. Riddle. His sisters were Lydia Maud Riddle (who married Donald C. Haldeman, general manager for Great Britain and Ireland of the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York) and Charlotte Buffington Riddle, member number 25516 of the Daughters of the American Revolution (who married Homer Lee of Mansfield, Ohio, founder of the Homer Lee Bank Note Company in New York City). Homer and Charlotte Lee&#x27;s children were Leander Lee and Homer Lee, Jr. 

Riddle married Elizabeth &quot;Lizzie&quot; Dobson in 1883. She was the daughter of John Dobson, who with his brother owned a mill in East Falls, Philadelphia. The couple had no children, but raised Elizabeth&#x27;s niece, Sarah Dobson Fiske, the daughter of Elizabeth&#x27;s sister, also named Sarah Dobson Fiske.

==Thoroughbred racing==
The owner of Glen Riddle Farm, Riddle bred and raced Thoroughbred race horses. His most famous horses were Man o&#x27; War and his son, U.S. Triple Crown winner War Admiral.

In partnership with Walter M. Jeffords, Sr., the husband of niece Sarah, Samuel D. Riddle purchased and operated Faraway Farm on Huffman Mill Pike near Lexington, Kentucky, where they stood Man o&#x27; War. In 1939, Riddle turned down an offer of a then-unheard-of $1 million for Man o&#x27; War.

Upon his death in January 1951, Riddle&#x27;s will stipulated that his estate was to be used to provide a hospital for the community of Media, Pennsylvania, the nearest town to Glen Riddle. With the $2.5 million and the of land provided by Riddle, fronted by Baltimore Pike, a charter for the hospital was granted on November 29, 1956. Riddle Memorial Hospital opened in February 1963, on of the land, with the balance of the land reserved for some manner related to the health and well-being of the community. 

The Riddlewood residential housing development in Middletown Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, is named for Riddle and its streets are named for the horses he owned.

<doc id="766007" wikidata="Q1585917" url="?curid=766007" title="Harold Ross">
<text>Harold Wallace Ross (November 6, 1892 – December 6, 1951) was an American journalist who co-founded &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine in 1925 with his wife Jane Grant, and was its editor-in-chief until his death.

==Early life==
Born in a prospector&#x27;s cabin in Aspen, Colorado, Ross was the son of Scots-Irish immigrant miner George Ross and schoolteacher Ida ( Martin) Ross. When he was eight, the family left Aspen because of the collapse in the price of silver, moving to Redcliff and Silverton, Colorado, then to Salt Lake City, Utah. In Utah, he worked on the high school paper (&quot;The West High Red &amp; Black&quot;) and was a stringer for &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot;, the city&#x27;s leading daily newspaper. He dropped out of school at 13 and ran away to his uncle in Denver, where he worked for &quot;The Denver Post&quot;. Though he returned to his family, he did not return to school, instead getting a job at the &quot;Salt Lake Telegram&quot;, a smaller afternoon daily newspaper.

By the time he was 25 he had worked for at least seven different papers, including the &quot;Marysville, California&quot; &quot;Appeal&quot;; the &quot;Sacramento Union&quot;; the &quot;Panama&quot; &quot;Star and Herald&quot;; the &quot;New Orleans&quot; &quot;Item&quot;; the &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot;; the &quot;Hudson Observer in&quot; Hoboken; the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot;; and the &quot;San Francisco Call&quot;.

In Atlanta, Georgia, he covered the murder trial of Leo Frank, one of the &quot;trials of the century&quot;. During World War I, he enlisted in the United States Army&#x27;s 18th Engineer Regiment in 1917. In France, he edited the regimental journal and went to Paris to work for the &quot;Stars and Stripes,&quot; serving from February 1918 to April 1919. He claimed to have walked 150 miles from officer&#x27;s training school at Langres, France to reach Paris to write for &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;, where he met Alexander Woollcott, Cyrus Baldridge, Franklin Pierce Adams, and Jane Grant, who would become his first wife and helped back &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

After the war, he returned to New York City and assumed the editorship of a magazine for veterans, &quot;The Home Sector&quot;. It folded in 1920 and was absorbed by the &quot;American Legion Weekly&quot;. He spent a few months at &quot;Judge&quot;, a humor magazine.

==&quot;The New Yorker&quot;==
Ross envisioned a new journal of metropolitan sensibilities and a sophisticated tone. This led him to co-found &quot;The New Yorker&quot; with his wife Jane Grant. The first issue was dated February 21, 1925. In partnership with yeast heir Raoul Fleischmann, they established F-R Publishing Company to publish it.

Ross was an original member of the Algonquin Round Table. He used his contacts in &quot;The Vicious Circle&quot; to help get &quot;The New Yorker&quot; started. Ross, said by Alexander Woollcott to resemble &quot;a dishonest Abe Lincoln&quot;, attracted talent to his new publishing venture, ultimately featuring writers such as Woollcott, James Thurber, E. B. White, John McNulty, Joseph Mitchell, Katharine S. White, S. J. Perelman, Janet Flanner, Wolcott Gibbs, St. Clair McKelway, John O&#x27;Hara, Robert Benchley, Dorothy Parker, Vladimir Nabokov, Sally Benson, A. J. Liebling, and J. D. Salinger.

The original prospectus for the magazine read, &quot;The &quot;New Yorker&quot; will be the magazine which is not edited for the old lady in Dubuque.&quot; Thurber noted the prospectus does not read or sound like Ross, summarizing Ross&#x27;s goals so:

[Casuals] was Ross&#x27;s word for fiction and humorous pieces of all kinds ... [it] indicated Ross&#x27;s determination to give the magazine an offhand, chatty, informal quality. Nothing was to be labored or studied, arty, literary, or intellectual.

Ross forbade sex as a subject, checking all art and articles for off-color jokes or double entendre and rejected advertisements thought unsuitable. Ross disliked fatalistic pieces and sought to minimize &quot;social-conscious stuff,&quot; calling such articles &quot;grim.&quot;

During the Second World War, the &quot;New Yorker&quot; ran on a skeleton staff after many contributors joined the war effort. Ross and his assistant William Shawn would put in six to seven days a week. To cultivate relationships, they published some PR works from the United States Department of War. &quot;Survival&quot;, John Hersey&#x27;s profile of future president John F. Kennedy, was also submitted to the department before receiving clearance. Kennedy&#x27;s father Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. was disappointed that the story had gone to the &quot;New Yorker&quot;, which he deemed too small and niche. An irritated Ross, who saw his magazine as an underdog competing against the larger powerhouses, relented into allowing a reprint of the story in the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. Hundreds of thousands of copies would be distributed during the younger Kennedy&#x27;s eventual campaigns for the U.S. House of Representatives and later the presidency.

Ross worked long hours and ruined all three of his marriages as a result. He was a careful and conscientious editor who strove to keep his copy clear and concise. One famous query to his writers was &quot;Who he?&quot; Ross believed the only two people were recognizable to everyone in the English-speaking world were Harry Houdini and Sherlock Holmes. 

Quite aware of his limited education, Ross treated &quot;Fowler&#x27;s Modern English Usage&quot; as his Bible. He edited every issue of the magazine from the first until his death—a total of 1,399 issues. He was notorious for overusing commas. Ross designated Shawn as his preferred successor, which Fleischmann confirmed after Ross died.

James Thurber quotes the reminiscences of many colleagues of both men in his 1959 memoir, &quot;The Years with Ross&quot;, citing his former chief&#x27;s pranks, temper, profanity, anti-intellectualism, drive, perfectionism, and an almost permanent social discomfort, and how these all shaped &quot;The New Yorker&quot; staff. Ross and his magazine slowly became famous among literati and newspapermen. Thurber quoted John Duncan Miller, the Washington, D.C., correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot; of London, after meeting Ross in 1938:During the first half hour, I felt that Ross was the last man in the world who could edit the &quot;New Yorker&quot;. I left there realizing that nobody else in the world could.
 He kept up a voluminous correspondence, which is preserved at the New York Public Library.

==Death==
Ross died of heart failure in Boston, Massachusetts in December 1951, during an operation to remove a lung after it was discovered his bronchial carcinoma had metastasized.

<doc id="766011" wikidata="Q1475956" url="?curid=766011" title="Melmoth the Wanderer">
<text>Melmoth the Wanderer is an 1820 Gothic novel by Irish playwright, novelist and clergyman Charles Maturin. The novel&#x27;s titular character is a scholar who sold his soul to the devil in exchange for 150 extra years of life, and searches the world for someone who will take over the pact for him, in a manner reminiscent of the Wandering Jew.

The novel is composed of a series of nested stories within stories, gradually revealing the story of Melmoth&#x27;s life. The novel offers social commentary on early 19th-century England, and denounces Roman Catholicism in favour of the virtues of Protestantism.

==Background==
The structure of the book as a series of short stories joined reflects its initial conception as such. In reality, Maturin was under pressure from his publisher to fulfil a contractual obligation, which goes some way to explaining the &quot;chaotic and haphazard process by which (he) wrote&quot;. Maturin spent many hours researching the novel in Marsh&#x27;s Library, Ireland&#x27;s first public library (opened in 1707), which was a short distance from his home on York Street and place of work on Aungier Street. In the library, Maturin took inspiration from many sources, including the King James Bible, the Anglican liturgy, the works of William Shakespeare, Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, polemical books and pamphlets of the English Revolution of the mid-17th century, and various literature and theatre from the 16th and 17th centuries. Maturin spent so much time reading in Marsh&#x27;s each day that he eventually constructed a special desk for himself there.

==Synopsis==
John Melmoth, a student in Dublin, visits his dying uncle. He finds a portrait of a mysterious ancestor called &quot;Melmoth&quot;; the portrait is dated 1646. At his uncle&#x27;s funeral, John is told an old family story about a stranger called Stanton, who arrived looking for &quot;Melmoth the Traveller&quot; decades earlier.

A manuscript left by Stanton describes his first finding Melmoth laughing at the sight of two lovers who have been struck by lightning, and hearing of a wedding at which Melmoth was an uninvited guest: the bride died and the bridegroom went mad. Stanton&#x27;s search for Melmoth is deemed to be madness and he is sent to a madhouse. Melmoth visits him there, and offers to free him, but Stanton refuses and escapes.

Following his uncle&#x27;s wish, John burns the Melmoth portrait. He is visited by Melmoth in a dream, and later sees Melmoth laughing at a shipwreck. John tries to approach him, but slips and falls into the sea. He is saved from drowning by the sole survivor of the wreck, a Spaniard named Alonzo Monçada.

Alonzo Monçada tells his story (The Tale of the Spaniard), in which his family confines him to a monastery. He is mistreated by the monks, and his brother Juan arranges for him to escape with the help of a fellow monk, a parricide. The escape plan is a trap and Juan is killed. Monçada is taken to the prison of the Inquisition. There he is visited in his cell by Melmoth, who says he will help him escape. A fire breaks out, and in the confusion Monçada escapes. He meets a venerable Jewish scholar, Adonijah, who lives in a secret chamber decorated with the skeletons of his own family. In exchange for food and shelter, Adonijah compels Monçada to transcribe a manuscript for him: the Tale of the Indians.
The Tale of the Indians tells of an island in the Indian Ocean which is rumoured to be haunted by a white goddess named Immalee. In reality, Immalee is a castaway who grew up alone on the island, isolated from humanity. She is visited by Melmoth, who tells her he comes from &quot;the world that suffers&quot;. He tries to destroy her innocence, showing her the shortcomings of human societies and religions. She falls in love with him and begs him to stay with her, but he departs. Three years later, Immalee, now named Isidora, has been restored to her family in Madrid. Melmoth reappears and he and Isidora elope by night; he leads her to a remote chapel where they are married by an undead hermit.

Isidora&#x27;s father encounters a stranger at an inn who tells him the Tale of Guzman&#x27;s Family. Guzman is a wealthy Spanish merchant whose sister marries a poor German musician, Walberg. Guzman decides to make Walberg&#x27;s family his heirs, but his will leaves everything to the church, and the family sinks into poverty; almost insane, Walberg decides to end their poverty by killing them all – but before he does so news arrives that the true will has been found and the family is saved. By this point in the story, Isidora&#x27;s father has fallen asleep, and wakes to find the stranger at the inn replaced by Melmoth.

Melmoth tells him the Lovers&#x27; Tale, about a young woman in Yorkshire named Elinor, who is jilted at the altar and is subsequently tempted by Melmoth, but refuses his help.

The Tale of the Indians resumes: Isidora returns to her family, but she is pregnant with Melmoth&#x27;s child. She has a presentiment that she will not live, and gets Melmoth to promise that the child will be raised as a Christian. Isidora&#x27;s father finds a husband for her, but in the middle of the wedding celebrations, Melmoth tries to abduct Isidora. Her brother tries to intervene, and Melmoth kills him. Isidora falls senseless and Melmoth escapes. Isidora reveals that she is already married, to Melmoth. She gives birth, but she and her baby daughter are imprisoned by the Inquisition. The inquisitors threaten to take away the child, but find that it is already dead. Isidora, dying of grief, remembers her island paradise, and asks if &quot;he&quot; will be in the heavenly paradise.

Monçada and John are interrupted by the appearance of Melmoth himself. He confesses to them his purpose on Earth, that his extended life is almost over, and that he has never been successful in tempting another into damnation: &quot;I have traversed the world in the search, and no one to gain that world, would lose his own soul!&quot; Melmoth has a dream of his own damnation, and of the salvation of Stanton, Walberg, Elinor, Isidora and Monçada. He asks John and Monçada to leave him alone for his last few hours of mortal existence. They hear terrible sounds from the room, but when they enter, the room is empty. They follow Melmoth&#x27;s tracks to the top of a cliff, and see his handkerchief on a crag below them. &quot;Exchanging looks of silent and unutterable horror&quot;, they return home.

==Reception==
Honoré de Balzac wrote a follow-up story (&quot;Melmoth Reconciled&quot;) and considered Maturin&#x27;s novel worthy of a place among Molière&#x27;s &quot;Dom Juan&quot;, Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; and Lord Byron&#x27;s &quot;Manfred&quot; as one of the supreme icons of modern European literature.

Oscar Wilde, during his travels after release from prison, called himself Sebastian Melmoth, deriving this pseudonym from the title character in his great-uncle&#x27;s novel and from Saint Sebastian.

The historian of English literature Walter Raleigh, in his book &quot;The English Novel&quot; (1905), stated &quot;in &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Melmoth the Wanderer&quot;, the Romantic orgy reached its height&quot;. The novel was described by H. P. Lovecraft as &quot;an enormous stride in the evolution of the horror-tale&quot;, and Maurice Richardson also wrote an essay for &quot;Lilliput&quot; magazine praising &quot;Melmoth&quot;. &quot;Melmoth the Wanderer&quot; was cited by Karl Edward Wagner as one of the 13 best supernatural horror novels. Thomas M. Disch placed &quot;Melmoth the Wanderer&quot; at number four in his list of classic fantasy stories. Devendra P. Varma described &quot;Melmoth the Wanderer&quot; as &quot;the crowning achievement of the Gothic Romance&quot;. Michael Moorcock has described &quot;Melmoth the Wanderer&quot; as &quot;one of my favourites&quot;.

The literary critic John Strachan notes the fact that much of the novel is set in contemporary Ireland and Spain is not surprising, considering the extent to which both countries haunted Maturin&#x27;s imagination. Ireland, despite its adherence to Catholicism, at least had the perceived &quot;benefit of the Union and the blessings of a free or mixed government to prevent it sliding into tyranny and oppression&quot;, whereas Spain &quot;had no such good fortune and was a country where the untrammelled efforts of Catholicism were displayed&quot;.

==Commemorations==
Marsh&#x27;s Library held an exhibition celebrating the bicentenary of the book in 2020, entitled &quot;Ragged, Livid &amp; On Fire: The Wanderings of Melmoth at 200&quot;.

<doc id="766014" wikidata="Q2704282" url="?curid=766014" title="Ruffini's rule">
<text>In mathematics, Ruffini&#x27;s rule is a method for computation of the Euclidean division of a polynomial by a binomial of the form &quot;x – r&quot;. It was described by Paolo Ruffini in 1809. The rule is a special case of synthetic division in which the divisor is a linear factor.

==Algorithm==
The rule establishes a method for dividing the polynomial:
:formula_1
by the binomial:
:formula_2
to obtain the quotient polynomial:
:formula_3

The algorithm is in fact the long division of &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) by &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;).

To divide &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) by &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;):

# Take the coefficients of &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and write them down in order. Then, write &quot;r&quot; at the bottom-left edge just over the line:
#:formula_4
# Pass the leftmost coefficient (&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;) to the bottom just under the line.
#:formula_5
# Multiply the rightmost number under the line by &quot;r&quot;, and write it over the line and one position to the right.
#:formula_6
# Add the two values just placed in the same column.
#:formula_7
# Repeat steps 3 and 4 until no numbers remain.
#:formula_8

The &quot;b&quot; values are the coefficients of the result (&quot;R&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) polynomial, the degree of which is one less than that of &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). The final value obtained, &quot;s&quot;, is the remainder. The polynomial remainder theorem asserts that the remainder is equal to &quot;P&quot;(&quot;r&quot;), the value of the polynomial at &quot;r&quot;.

==Example==
Here is an example of polynomial division as described above.

Let:
:formula_9
:formula_10

&quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) will be divided by &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) using Ruffini&#x27;s rule. The main problem is that &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is not a binomial of the form &quot;x&quot; − &quot;r&quot;, but rather &quot;x&quot; + &quot;r&quot;. &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) must be rewritten as
:formula_11
Now the algorithm is applied:

So, if &quot;original number&quot; = &quot;divisor&quot; × &quot;quotient&quot; + &quot;remainder&quot;, then
:formula_12, where

:formula_13 and formula_14

==Application to polynomial factorization==
Ruffini&#x27;s rule can be used when one needs the quotient of a polynomial by a binomial of the form formula_15 (When one needs only the remainder, the polynomial remainder theorem provides a simpler method.)

A typical example, where one needs the quotient, is the factorization of a polynomial formula_16 for which one knows a root :

The remainder of the Euclidean division of formula_16 by is , and, if the quotient is formula_18 the Euclidean division is written as
:formula_19

This gives a (possibly partial) factorization of formula_20 which can be computed with Ruffini&#x27;s rule. Then, formula_16 can be further factored by factoring formula_22

The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every polynomial of positive degree has at least one complex root. The above process shows the fundamental theorem of algebra implies that every polynomial can be factored as 
:formula_23
where formula_24 are complex numbers.

==History==
The method was invented by Paolo Ruffini, who took part in a competition organized by the Italian Scientific Society (of Forty). The challenge was to devise a method to find the roots of any polynomial. Five submissions were received. In 1804 Ruffini&#x27;s was awarded first place and his method was published. He later published refinements of his work in 1807 and again in 1813.

<text>A gunsmith is a person who repairs, modifies, designs, or builds guns. The occupation differs from an armorer, who usually replaces only worn parts in standard firearms. Gunsmiths do modifications and changes to a firearm that may require a very high level of craftsmanship, requiring the skills of a top-level machinist, a very skilled woodworker, and even an engineer. Gunsmiths perform factory-level repairs and renovations to restore well-used or deteriorated firearms to new condition. They may make alterations to adapt sporting guns to better fit the individual shooter that may require extensive modifications to the firearm&#x27;s stocks and metal parts. Repairs and redesigns may require fabrication and fitting of unavailable parts and assemblies constructed by smiths themselves. Gunsmiths may also renew metal finishes or apply decorative carvings or engravings to guns. Many gun shops offer gunsmithing service on the premises.
==Overview==

Gunsmiths may be employed in:

*armories by military or law-enforcement agencies,
*sporting goods stores, or
*small gunsmith shops, as either the owner, or as one of a handful of employees.

To pursue the entirety of this trade, a gunsmith must possess skills as a parts fabricator, a metalworker or blacksmith, a woodworker and an artisan; be knowledgeable in shop mathematics, ballistics, chemistry, and materials engineering; be knowledgeable in the use and application of a variety of hand, power, and machinists tools and measuring devices. Those who are (self-) employed in small gunsmith shops must also possess skills as small business operators; work effectively with a wide variety of customers; and remain abreast of, and comply with federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, and requirements.

Due to the great breadth of subject matter to be mastered, many gunsmiths specialize in only a few of the skills required of the general gunsmith. Alternatively, some gunsmiths learn many of the skills of the trade but only apply them to a few weapon types (e.g., only pistols, only shotguns, only specific brands or models).

==Responsibilities==

The primary responsibility of a gunsmith is to ensure that guns work and function safely. Gunsmiths accomplish this by always properly observing and demonstrating gun safety in their handling procedures, both in their own actions and the actions of their customers and the people around them.

They accomplish that task secondly by inspecting guns to ensure safe mechanical operation. Gunsmiths use their in-depth knowledge of firearms and manufacturer&#x27;s gun schematics to guide inspections: repairing deficiencies, notifying customers of unsafe conditions, or preventing catastrophic failures.

Some of the conditions a gunsmith looks for when inspecting a firearm brought to them for repairs are improper assembly, missing parts, cracks, bore obstruction, improper headspace, improper timing, safety malfunctions, worn sear edges, and deformed firing pin tips, among other problems.

*Gun schematics, also referred to as firearm schematics, are technical diagrams that display a firearm&#x27;s internal workings and parts. These schematics usually feature detailed illustrations of significant components like the barrel, receiver, trigger assembly, and magazine. They are often used by gun enthusiasts, manufacturers, and gunsmiths to diagnose and fix problems that may arise with the firearm.

==Common tasks==

(listed in approximate, but not exact, order of increasing difficulty)
* Disassemble, clean, inspect, lubricate and reassemble.
* Remove corrosion and touch-up finish.
* Repair burred or damaged parts with files and stones.
* Replace defective parts with factory-made replacements, hand-fitting as necessary.
* Add after-market customizations:
** sling-swivels
** recoil-pads
** iron-sights
** scopes
** grip caps
** butt plates
* Repair and re-finish wooden stock parts.
* Checker or re-checker grip areas.
* Deepen or clean up worn or damaged engravings and markings.
* Re-crown damaged muzzles on a lathe.
* Repair dented shotgun barrels.
* Install (solder) or repair rib on shotgun barrels, or repair double-barrel assemblies.
* Measure and correct head-space dimensions.
* Check for excessive bore erosion.
* Troubleshoot and repair feeding, ejecting and firing problems.
* Test-fire guns with conventional loads to ensure proper operation.
* Fabricate wooden stocks to customer specifications and body dimensions. Fit same to existing receiver and barrel.
* Glass-bed actions to stocks to improve accuracy.
* Remove existing metal finish, and re-blue metal parts.
* Fabricate replacement parts from metal stock.
* Modify trigger-pull weight through careful stoning of trigger mechanism parts.
* Fire proof-loads through weapons to ensure sufficient strength of parts under over-load conditions.
* Replace worn barrels, which have fired so many rounds that they are no longer of the specified caliber (which leads to loss of accuracy).
* Change caliber or cartridge of existing rifle, by changing barrel, and modifying receiver.
* Re-cut rifling and change caliber of existing barrel.
* Design and build complete rifles by fitting stock barrels to stock receivers; fabricating or purchasing additional parts as needed, and fitting same to rifle. Fitting custom stock to the same.
* Design and build a complete rifle, shotgun, or combination gun from start to finish.

Top-end custom gunmaking:

A good example of a firearm type requiring the skills of a Master Gunsmith is a Combination Gun, commonly referred to as a &quot;Drilling&quot;. These are highly complex hand-made long guns with several joined barrels. These are firearms that combine both rifle and shotgun barrels sharing a common breech and buttstock. Since these are completely hand crafted by Master Gunsmiths, these can be made in almost any combination of rifle calibers and shotgun gauges. The most popular arrangement is a Side-by-Side shotgun with a high-power rifle barrel underneath with various firing mechanisms housed in a common breech.

Another firearm type demanding the highest skill levels is the completely custom-made Side-by-Side or Over and Under double barrel shotgun. These &quot;Doubles&quot; are referred to in the British Gunmaking trade as &quot;Bespoke&quot; firearms and are referred to as &quot;Best Guns&quot;. Their starting prices are commonly in the $150,000.00 (US) {2024 pricing} range, with customer-specified changes adding to the cost. Close examination of any examples of these rarified firearms by one knowlegable in this field will show why these firearms are priced in this range. It is some of the highest level of wood gunstock blank selection, shaping, and fitting combined with flawless metal crafting. These firearms are commonly also hand engraved to a level of artistic design, layout, and execution that rivals (or surpasses) the finest printing plates used in currency printing. These firearms overall are time intensive in their execution and demand the highest quality workmanship as the customers purchasing these arms are invariably highly knowledgeable and communicate within their select group. Less than the finest work will become quickly known and this customer base will abandon any future business with that gunmaker. 
The highest level of custom-made firearms usually start out as several pieces of blank steel stock or rough forged parts, a slab (stock blank) of walnut; steel tubes with rifled or smooth holes (&quot;bores&quot;) drilled their length. Many smaller detail parts are fabricated in-house and are fitted by the maker. The highly skilled gunsmiths that craft these masterpieces commonly use nothing more than an occasional lathe or milling machine for roughing the parts to their final fitting stages plus a heat treating furnace for making springs, hardening parts to the proper hardness, and color case hardening. But the majority of roughing, fitting, and finishing is done completely by hand using files, scrapers, abrasive paper and cloth, woodcarving chisels and rasps.

==Specializations==

While some gunsmiths are general practitioners in this trade, some of the more important specializations are:

===Custom builder/designer===
Builds guns to customer&#x27;s specification, from raw materials and shelf parts. Gunsmiths specializing in custom areas can be called upon by professional target-shooters, avid sports shooters, or anyone that wants custom attributes added to their firearm to create highly accurate or custom looking firearms. A Custom Gunsmith also builds high-end firearms for hunters and shooters with needs and desires that cannot be served by standard catalogued firearms offered by gun manufacturers. They may work in partnership with engravers and other specialized artists to produce unique finishes and decorations not possible on regular mass-produced firearms. Some highly specialized gunsmiths can complete all firearm modifications without anyone else in the industry helping them. This is likely the most highly skilled of gunsmiths, as they are required not only to have proficiency in the other areas of gunsmithing, but must also be well educated in firearm finishing and machining, in order to manufacture the individual components and even springs before assembly takes place.

===Finisher===
Applies various chemical processes (browning, bluing, Parkerization, among others) to the metal parts of guns to develop corrosion resistant surface layers on the steel. They may also apply case hardening to low carbon steel parts. Case hardening is a combined chemical and heat-treatment process which introduces carbon into the surfaces of low steel alloys that does not contain sufficient carbon to allow total (&quot;through&quot;) heat treatment. This carbon rich surface is then heat treated resulting in a thin, very hard surface layer with a tough, malleable core. This process can be done solely for the mechanical properties (hardness and toughness) it imparts, or, by packing the parts in bone charcoal and other chemicals and heating in a heat treatment furnace for varying time periods, it is possible to introduce rich colors into the carbonized surface. This type of case hardening, known as color case hardening, and is prized for its rich mottled blues, purples, browns and grey tones. It is possible, with highly skilled craftsmen using proprietary processes, to control the hues and patterns so closely that one familiar with high grade custom firearms can usually recognize the maker of another shooter&#x27;s firearm solely by the colors and patterns on its parts; an important distinction on extremely costly firearms of the highest grade. Typically, its use is usually restricted to receivers and non- stressed small parts. Although providing corrosion resistance, the colored surface layers are subject to wear and may also fade with time. Antique firearms for sale frequently note the specific percentage of the factory original case coloring remaining on the receiver and lockplates. Renewing this color case hardening to the specific patterns of the firearm when it was new has become an important sub-area of the gunsmithing field.

===Stockmaker===
Carves gun stocks from wood (usually walnut; although birch, maple, and apple wood, among others, are frequently seen). Fits stocks to the metal parts of the gun (receiver and barrel), as well as to customer&#x27;s body dimensions. With custom made shotguns, the fit to the individual shooter is vital, as the shot cloud&#x27;s impact is largely determined by the way the stock fits the shooter. Very high grade firearms may have stocks fashioned from very costly blanks, mostly of one of the walnut varieties, specially chosen for its rare and highly figured grain. The fashioning of high end gunstocks calls for an extremely high level of skill and craftsmanship, as the finished product must be pleasing aesthetically, fit the shooting customer like an orthopedic device, all the while having the ability to withstand high levels of recoil from the firing of many thousands of rounds. Wood gunstocks may be fashioned with automated machinery (for production firearms) while high end gunstocks are hand made using saws, chisels, gouges, rasps, and files. The surfaces are then finished by sanding, scraping, staining, oiling, or lacquering.

===Checkerer===
 (This specialization is frequently combined with that of the Stockmaker) Uses checkering tools to create an ornate pattern of small raised diamonds in the wood surfaces which are to be gripped. The checkering tools are in effect tiny saws, designed to leave a v-shaped groove (of approximately 60 to 90 degrees) in the surface of the wooden gunstock. Special checkering tools consisting of two saw blades in parallel are used to set the spacing, usually between 16 and 24 lines per inch (1.0 mm to 1.6 mm line width). The area to be checkered is covered by one set of such grooves parallel to each other. A second set of parallel grooves is then executed across the first set, at approximately a 30-degree angle, leaving the area covered with small, pointed diamonds. The edges of the checkered area are frequently ornamented with simple bas-relief wood carving, frequently variations on the fleur-de-lis.

===Gun engraver===
 Uses hand-gravers or die-sinker&#x27;s chisels to cut designs or pictures into the metal surfaces of the gun, primarily the receiver. The firearms engraver must first be a highly gifted and capable artist that can first compose the desired design freehand on paper. In many cases, the customer must be consulted and must approve the design. In some cases, the engraving may incorporate a favorite scene, a revered hunting dog, or even family members and residences. The engraver must have a thorough knowledge of human and animal anatomy, perspective, botany, and composition. The smallness and geometry of the parts must also be considered, and harmony between all these factors must artistically agree.

These designs must then be cut freehand into the tough hardened steel surfaces of the firearm. Pneumatically driven engraving systems, such as the Gravermeister, developed by GRS Tools, may be used to replace or supplement hand-powered engraving, but the guiding of these powered tools is still provided by the artist. Other metals (especially gold and silver) may be inlaid and engraved to further the design. Designs usually consist of elaborate scroll-work based upon Acanthus leaves or vines, or may be of purely abstract spirals. Before the development of corrosion resistant surface treatments for steel, gun surfaces were engraved to retain more oil to prevent rust. In modern usage, guns are engraved purely for artistic reasons. Top grade engraving is very expensive but well executed, tastefully designed engraving always adds significantly to the value of quality firearms. Many of the world&#x27;s foremost art museums have highly decorated firearms in their collections because of the high artistic merit and craftsmanship of their engraved, chiseled, and carved decoration. Many books exist on the subject of highly decorated firearms, with detailed illustrations showing their &quot;art in steel&quot;.

===Pistolsmith===
Specializes in work on pistols and revolvers. Pistolsmiths should be proficient in a range of skills such as woodworking, checkering, machining, metal finishing and metalworking. They must have an excellent understanding of the mechanical characteristics and function of the guns they work on. Often a pistolsmith is called on for extensive customization of a handgun making it better suited for its intended purpose. A good example of this is changing the factory sights for new front and rear sights more suited to the purposes of the user. A wide variety is available as aftermarket parts. Target pistols usually start out as standard models but receive extensive reworking by skilled pistolsmiths resulting in a firearm that is capable of much greater accuracy than the standard versions of the same arm. A more advanced job a pistolsmith may called on to perform is to construct a completely hand fitted target arm using a serial numbered frame as the base (as required by law) with the rest of the parts supplied with excess metal in certain areas by specialist manufacturers so the pistolsmith can fit these parts together to exacting tolerances. Using these methods, the pistolsmith can build highly accurate firearms that greatly exceed the usual accuracy of standard models of the same model.

===Manufacturer===
Some gunsmiths used their experience and skills to become small-operation manufacturers, specializing in making only a few types of gun parts, for sale to other gunsmiths and gunmakers. Some of the more important part categories are barrels, trigger assemblies, receivers, and locks.

==Training and education==

In general, gunsmiths develop and expand their skills through years of experience.

Some common ways to get started in gunsmithing include:
* Community colleges and correspondence courses offer various courses of study (less than two years long) leading to a degree or a certification. Well-known schools offering training in the trade include the Murray State College gunsmithing program, the Pennsylvania Gunsmith School, the Trinidad State Junior College Gunsmithing program, and the Yavapai College Gunsmithing School
* Military training: This is usually at the &quot;Armorer&quot; level, but some, notably the Army Marksmanship Unit (AMU) may have individuals specializing in Sniper or Service Match (Target Competition) arms. These highly gunsmithed (&quot;Accurized&quot;) rifles and pistols are derived from standard service models and are used in target shooting and combat marksmanship roles.
** The United States Army trains and employs &quot;MOS 45B&quot; – Small Arms Repairmen. (was redesignated MOS 91F in Spring of 2004)
** The U.S. Air Force trains and employs Combat Arms Instructors (Firearms instructors and small arms repairers)AFSC(MOS) 3P0X1B.
** The U.S. Marine Corps trains and employs &quot;MOS 2111&quot; and &quot;MOS 2112&quot;.
** The United States Navy trains and employs gunner&#x27;s mates (GM).
* Apprenticeships, learning directly from professional gunsmiths:
* The National Rifle Association of America offers short courses in many common tasks and skills of professional gunsmithing. It also sponsors educational programs such as the one at Lassen College in Susanville, CA, and most notable at Trinidad State Junior College in Trinidad CO.

Basic machinist skills, while not limited to gunsmithing, are of great help to aspiring gunsmiths. These may include both machine and hand-tool operations, such as metal turning, drilling, filing, stoning or polishing.

News of the most highly skilled and talented gunsmiths typically spreads by word of mouth, based on the quality of their work. The very best and most talented gunsmiths command premium prices for their services, and may have waiting lists booked for several years in advance.

==Legal requirements==

In many countries of the world, the possession and ownership of firearms by civilians is highly restricted or outright illegal. The practice of gunsmithing is therefore typically restricted, licensed or regulated. In some circumstances the only legal firearms-related repairs are by individuals trained and employed by the military or police. These individuals are known as armorers. Typically, their skill level is usually far below that of the private or artisan gunsmith. Where the gunsmith frequently has to design, manufacture and fit parts ranging from small internal parts and assemblies, the armorer usually only has to replace standard interchangeable parts belonging to only one type, series, or family of military-related firearms. They typically are furnished a large inventory of standard parts that are known to wear and cause malfunctions in the weapons they will encounter, and they are simply trained to replace these items until satisfactory function is restored.

In the regions where ownership is permitted but limited or restricted to those individuals able to afford the costs of acquiring and owning a firearm, the firearms that are allowed tend to be fewer in number and possess levels of craftsmanship and decoration that approach that of an art object instead of simply a device to expel a projectile. Gunsmithing in these regions (as in Germany and Britain) is concerned with the hand-crafting of completely custom-made firearms tailored to the requirements of the owner.

===Federal Republic of Germany===

Germany has a tradition of hunting, but this is generally a complicated undertaking that limits its participation. Firearms possession is highly regulated by the police, and most hunters own only one long gun and perhaps a single pistol. One of Germany&#x27;s more distinctive firearm developments is the drilling, a multi-barrel gun that may incorporate a double-barreled shotgun above with a high-powered single-shot barrel below. These typically have highly sophisticated breech mechanisms, precise fitting, and are hand-engraved by artists specializing in this work. The stocks are usually fitted to the individual and are very expensive wood with highly figured grain. 

===Italy===

Firearms ownership in Italy is regulated by the Italian government but private ownership of various types and numbers of firearms is allowed after proper vetting of the prospective purchaser. Italy has a hunting tradition dating back several centuries. It is the location of some of the finest upland (game bird) hunting in the world. Italy also has a rich history of gunmaking and gunsmithing going back several hundred years with the production of matchlock, flintlock, and caplock rifles and pistols. The city of Brescia, Italy and specifically its suburb of Gardone Val Trompia is historical home to a number of firearm manufacturers and gunsmiths. Italy is noted as one of the world&#x27;s leading manufacturing centers of custom-made highly crafted double shotguns. The city of Gardone is the home of several manufacturing firms that sell their products worldwide, with Pietro Beretta (founded in 1526) being the largest and best known. Italian shotguns are noted for their precise fitting, their precision craftsmanship, and the higher grades feature exquisite hand engraving. The Brescia area has several training facilities for the education of apprentices gunsmiths for the crafting of high grade shotguns and rifles. There is also a training academy for engravers and many freelance engravers are located in this area.

===Japan===
During the Tokugawa period in Japan, starting in the 17th century, the government imposed very restrictive controls on the small number of gunsmiths in the nation, thereby ensuring the almost total prohibition of firearms. Japan, in the postwar period, has had gun regulation which is strict in principle. Gun licensing is required, and is heavily regulated by the National Police Agency. The weapons law begins by stating &quot;No one shall possess a firearm or firearms or a sword or swords&quot;, and very few exceptions are allowed. In recent times, there been moves to recruit more legally licensed and trained hunters to help control feral pigs. These animal&#x27;s proliferation and their feeding characteristics has had negative effects on food crop planting and production. 

Japan has many small companies that have undertaken the manufacture of hunting arms for many U.S. retailers. Browning Arms, some models of Winchester firearms, and the Weatherby rifle line are currently manufactured in Japan. Their products are known for very good craftsmanship, excellent material quality, and affordable pricing.
===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom makes some of the most expensive hand-crafted firearms in the world, despite a highly restrictive ownership environment. Decoration of these arms, typically double-barreled shotguns, is on par with the plates used to mint currency and is priced about the same. Several of the other European countries follow this pattern, as in Italy, where the art of the gunsmith has also reached a high level of sophistication. These craftsmen may specialize as in the case of the gun engraver and stockmaker. Generally, these craftsmen serve long apprenticeships under master gunmakers. They may also be members of Guilds which set up apprentice programmes (often sponsored by the Governments in these countries as highly crafted firearms are important items in the export trade), supervise training, and conduct exams where the journeyman-level gunsmiths submit sample firearms of their own work in order to be admitted the Guild membership. Many of these can only be regarded as &quot;gunmakers&quot; instead of gunsmiths, and do repairs only on the very highest grade firearms. Many are able to make a substantial livelihood.

===United States===

In the United States, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is the primary federal agency overseeing all legitimate businesses that deal with firearms, with the exception of firearms made before January 1, 1899, or muzzle loading firearms. The ATF is in charge of the licensing of all legitimate firearms dealers and gunsmiths in the US that engage in business with the public. The issuance of a Federal Firearms License (FFL) involves a thorough background investigation and an inspection of the gunsmith&#x27;s premises by an Agent of the ATF. The ATF requires all gunsmiths to record all repairs, noting the serial numbers, type of firearm, caliber or gauge, and full particulars of the owner, with an accepted form of Identification ID to be presented and recorded. Gunsmiths are required to maintain these records in a permanent, non-alterable form.

The ATF inspects the premises of all licensed gunsmiths with unannounced visits at periodic intervals. The ATF is granted the power by the U.S. government to initiate the prosecution in U.S. federal court of gunsmiths that wilfully omit or violate these provisions. Punishment can range from losing their FFL (and therefore the privilege to engage in any firearms-related business), to fines and in severe cases, such as conspiring to supply the criminal element with black market weaponry, imprisonment in a federal prison.

Gunsmiths who lack sophisticated machine shop capabilities must understand the law. Enlisting an unlicensed machine shop (one without an FFL) to create gun receivers can be illegal. Other common parts such as grips, barrels, triggers, sights, magazines, recoil springs, and stocks can be manufactured freely, but all receiver development work does require licensing.

Generally, gunsmiths cannot undertake the repair of a firearm they believe is illegally held by a person not permitted to own a firearm (a convicted felon, for instance) or one that otherwise violates the laws where the owner resides. The ownership of firearms in the US is governed by local laws. These laws and regulations vary greatly from state to state, county to county, city to city, and potentially across all jurisdictional lines.

Additionally, modifications to firearms made by gunsmiths are restricted as well. The ATF specifies what modifications are permitted or not permitted and to which firearms that may or may not be applied.

<text>Bulakan, officially the Municipality of Bulakan (), is a municipality in the province of Bulacan, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 81,232 people.

Bulakan, which is one of the oldest towns in the Philippines, became the &quot;encomienda&quot; or capital of the &quot;Provincia de la Pampanga&quot;, and later became the first capital of the Province of Bulacan before it was moved to Malolos early during the American occupation.

With regards to whether to use the letters &quot;c&quot; or &quot;k&quot; to refer to the municipality of Bulakan, the New Provincial Administrative Code of Bulacan (Ordinance no. C-004) of 2007 states on Chapter 2, Section 15 that the word &quot;Bulakan&quot; stands for the municipality and first capital of the province while &quot;Bulacan&quot; refers to the province itself.

==Etymology==
The town got its name is from the Tagalog word &quot;bulak&quot;, which means &quot;cotton&quot; in the English language. It was named &quot;Bulakan&quot; due to the abundance of cotton plant growing in the region.

==History==

=== Foundation ===
The Augustinians founded Bulakan as one of the &quot;visitas&quot; of Convento de Tondo in 1575 under its minister Fray Alonzo Alvarado, OSA. In 1578, it became a town Parish and Convent dedicated it under the patronage of Nuestra Señora de la Asunción with Caluya (now Balagtas, became town in 1599) and Guiguinto (became town in 1641) as its &quot;visitas&quot;. According to local records, Father Agustin del Alburqueque, OSA is the first Prior of the Town.

In a census of June 1591, the Province of Bulacan had 1,200 tributes or 4,800 persons, one Augustinian convent, one &quot;Gobernadorcillo&quot; and one &quot;alcalde mayor&quot; (present day governor) who had jurisdiction over the towns of Bulakan (then capital) Malolos, Calumpit, Guiguinto, Caluya and Meycauayan.

In the heart of the town stands the centuries-old adobe church of Our Lady of the Assumption &quot;(Nuestra Señora de la Asunción)&quot;. In front of the church stands the municipal hall and a park named &quot;Plaza del Pilar&quot;, which is dedicated to Revolutionary General Gregorio del Pilar who hailed from Barangay San Jose, Bulakan.

The Parish Church of Our Lady of the Assumption is the second oldest Roman Catholic church in the province and the longest and widest in terms of aisle length and span respectively. It has a baptismal book entry as early as 1578. On the first page of the book, written was the name of the barrio of the town of Bulacan, Bagio, Bulacan (Camino Real), Daan Estacion, Matungao, Cupang, Banban, Dapdap, Parian, Balubad, Pitpitan, Maysantor, Acsajo, Paniqui, San Nicolas, Nagdasig, Calungusan, Taliktik and Sta Ana.

After 400 long years, changes have been made to the old &quot;barrios&quot; that consist of the town. Bagio became part of Bagumbayan in 1731, Tibig exist in 1735, Dapdap was renamed Santa Ana in 1741, Nagdasig become part of Tab-Ang in 1744 and now San Francisco, Parian was renamed Santa Inez in 1765, Bulacan (Camino Real), Daan Estacion, Paniqui and Calungusan was created into one barrio and was named San Jose, Barrio Pitpitan occupied Acsajo, Cupang was joined to Maysantor now Maysantol, Banban became Bangbang and now Bambang, Perez exists as separate &quot;barrio&quot; of Taliktik (now Taliptip), and with the same old name of &quot;barrios&quot; San Nicolas, Matungao and Balubad.

The early Bulaqueños, the residents of Bulakan, were engaged in farming, fishing and handicrafts, especially weaving.

The town of Bulakan, being the first capital of the province, gave the name to the province as customary to the other provinces of the early Philippines (like Cavite, Cavite; Tayabas, Tayabas (now Quezon Province) or Batangas, Batangas). It was the hub of economic activities and the inhabitants enjoyed excellent trade with Manila, primarily due to its proximity to the city and accessibility through its wide and navigable river.

=== British invasion of Bulacan ===
Bulakan was also the scene of battle between the Spaniards led by Simón de Anda y Salazar and the British led by Captain Slay during the short British occupation of Manila. The British sent an expedition of 400 British, 300 Malabar Negroes and 2,000 Chinese allies. The Spaniards, with the natives of Bulacan, made a gallant stand but were defeated. Captain Slay eventually took over the town but did not last long.

A huge group of about 8,000 Filipino guerillas led by Spanish Jose Pedro de Busto made a nine long days battle in front of the church up to the foot bridge against Captain Slay. They made Captain Slay to retreat to Manila. On this fight, Bulaqueños have shown for the first time an extraordinary martyrdom. The British attempt of conquering the rest of the country was gone astray because of the marvelous fight made by Bulakeños. 

=== Bulakan Church ===
The Church of Nuestra Señora de la Asuncion is the birthplace of Flores de Mayo, a feast for the Virgin Mary, held throughout the Philippines in the month of May. It is also the birthplace of the traditional song &quot;Dalit&quot;, a poetic chant for the patrons of a certain &quot;barrio&quot; or town. For centuries, the Church of the Our Lady of the Assumption served as the bastion of the Catholic faith all over the province. It served as the central church: a cathedral-like church serving as a primus inter pares among the Poblacion churches of Bulakan. After the erection of the Diocese of Malolos, its former glory slowly faded as the focus turned to the cathedral of the neighboring town Malolos: a church erected 2 years later in 1580. As the former capital of the secular rule, as well as the fortress of Christianity, it is due to give honor to this century-old church. Thus, the faithful along with the incumbent parish priest, Rev. Fr. Manuel Manicad, petitioned a request to the bishop, Jose Francisco Oliveros, Bishop of Malolos, to declare the church as a Diocesan Shrine. On November 28, 2020 the fifth bishop of Malolos, Most Rev. Dennis Villarojo D.D. elevated the parish as a Diocesan Shrine, on the same day, the venerated image of Nuestra Señora de la Asuncion received the Solemn Episcopal Coronation. The town still enjoys trade and commerce with the neighboring towns and Manila with whom she shares a coastline, a place that is replete with historical and glorious past.
