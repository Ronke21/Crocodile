<text>Hedcut is a term referring to a style of drawing associated with &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; half-column portrait illustrations. 

The newspaper staff uses the stipple method of many small dots and the hatching method of small lines to create an image, and are designed to emulate the look of woodcuts from old-style newspapers, and engravings on certificates and currency. The phonetic spelling of &quot;hed&quot; may be based on newspapers&#x27; use of the term &quot;hed&quot; for &quot;headline&quot;.

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; adopted the current form of this portraiture in 1979 when freelance artist Kevin Sprouls approached the paper with some ink-dot illustrations he had created. The front-page editor felt that the drawings complemented the paper&#x27;s classical feeling and gave it a sense of stability. Additionally, they are generally more legible than photographs of the same size would be.

Sprouls was subsequently hired as a staff illustrator and remained there until 1987. Today, there are five hedcut artists employed by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

Each drawing takes between three and five hours to produce. First, a high-quality photograph must be obtained. This photograph is then converted to grayscale and the contrast is adjusted in Photoshop. The altered photograph is printed out, placed on a light table, and overlaid with tracing vellum. The illustrators then trace directly over this image with pens, recreating the source photo using specific dot and line patterns. The final tracing is then scanned back into Photoshop where it can be colorized if needed or otherwise adjusted. These drawings are traditionally created at 18 by 31 picas (), and then later reduced to fit the column size. 

Women are sometimes more difficult to depict than men as they tend to have more complicated haircuts, which are often cropped for simplicity. This allows the women&#x27;s portraits to fit into the same size frame as the men&#x27;s without reducing the relative scale of the women&#x27;s faces.

In 2002, the Smithsonian Institution acquired 66 original hedcut drawings and have put them on permanent display in the National Portrait Gallery.

A March 18, 2010, video produced by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; shows the artists at work.

In 2019, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; began developing a proprietary application that generated custom hedcut portraits using machine learning trained by on a dataset of over 2,000 hedcut drawings and photographs. In December 2019, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;&#x27;s R&amp;D Chief Francesco Marconi announced that hedcuts published in the newspaper would continue to be created by human artists, but that the AI-driven tool would be offered to all its members in order to &quot;democratize&quot; the illustrations and create an ongoing repository of photos for the app to continue to learn from in order to better refine its results.

<text>Airbus Military was a business unit of Airbus, which was part of European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) from 2009 to 2013.

The company was formally created in April 2009 by the integration of the former Military Transport Aircraft Division (MTAD) and Airbus Military Sociedad Limitada (AMSL) into Airbus. In January 2014, former EADS divisions Airbus Military, Astrium, and Cassidian merged to form Airbus Defence and Space.

==History==
The predecessor company, headquartered in Blagnac, was established in January 1999 as Airbus Military Company SAS, to manage the Airbus A400M project, taking over from the Euroflag consortium. In May 2003, the company was restructured as Airbus Military Sociedad Limitada (AMSL) prior to the contract being awarded and its headquarters moved to Madrid, Spain.

The Military Transport Aircraft Division (MTAD) was a division of EADS which designed, manufactured and sold EADS-CASA light and medium transport aircraft, headquartered in Madrid, Spain.

On 16 December 2008, EADS announced that MTAD and AMSL would be integrated into Airbus as part of &quot;Airbus Military&quot;.

In February 2009, Domingo Ureña-Raso was appointed chair and CEO of Airbus Military.

On July 31, 2013, parent company EADS announced its reorganization as the Airbus Group. Airbus Military, Astrium, and Cassidian were merged and reorganized to form a new division: Airbus Defence and Space, marking the end of the Airbus Military corporate entity. Airbus Group&#x27;s two other divisions are Airbus and Airbus Helicopters

<doc id="771974" wikidata="Q313556" url="?curid=771974" title="Charles Garnier (architect)">
<text>Jean-Louis Charles Garnier (; 6 November 1825 – 3 August 1898) was a French architect, perhaps best known as the architect of the Palais Garnier and the Opéra de Monte-Carlo.

==Early life==

Charles Garnier was born Jean-Louis Charles Garnier on 6 November 1825 in Paris, on the Rue Mouffetard, in the present-day 5th arrondissement. His father, Jean André Garnier, 1796–1865, who was originally from Sarthe, a department of the French region of Pays de la Loire, had worked as a blacksmith, wheelwright, and coachbuilder before settling down in Paris to work in a horse-drawn carriage rental business. He married Felicia Colle, daughter of a captain in the French Army.

Later in life Garnier would all but ignore the fact that he was born of humble origins, preferring to claim Sarthe as his birthplace.

==Education==

Garnier became an apprentice of Louis-Hippolyte Lebas, and after that a full-time student of the École royale des Beaux-Arts de Paris, beginning during 1842. He obtained the Premier Grand Prix de Rome in 1848 at age twenty-three. The subject of his final examination was titled:&quot;&quot;Un conservatoire des arts et métiers, avec galerie d&#x27;expositions pour les produits de l&#x27;industrie&quot;.&quot; 

He became a pensioner of the Académie de France à Rome from 17 January 1849 to 31 December 1853. 
He traveled through Greece providing him the subject of his fourth year submission, presented at the Paris Salon in 1853. He visited Greece with Edmond About and Constantinople with Théophile Gautier. He worked on the Temple of Aphaea in Aegina where he insisted on polychromy.
He was named in 1874 member of the Institut de France in the architecture section of the Académie des Beaux-Arts.

==Paris Opera==

On 30 December 1860 the Second Empire of Emperor Napoleon III announced a competition for the design of a new, state-funded opera house. The old opera house, located on the and known as the Salle Le Peletier, had been constructed as a temporary theatre in 1821. Street access to that theatre was greatly constricted; and after an attempted assassination of Napoleon III at the theatre&#x27;s entrance on 14 January 1858, it was decided to build a new opera house with a separate, more secure entrance for the head of state.

Applicants were given a month to submit entries. There were two phases to the competition, and Garnier was one of about 170 entrants in the first phase. He was awarded the fifth-place prize and was one of seven finalists selected for the second phase. The second phase required the contestants to revise their original projects and was more rigorous, with a 58-page program, written by the director of the Opéra, Alphonse Royer, which the contestants received on 18 April. The new submissions were sent to the jury in the middle of May, and on 29 May Garnier&#x27;s project was selected for its &quot;rare and superior qualities in the beautiful distribution of the plans, the monumental and characteristic aspect of the facades and sections&quot;.

Garnier&#x27;s wife Louise later wrote that the French architect Alphonse de Gisors, who was on the jury, had commented to them that Garnier&#x27;s project was &quot;remarkable in its simplicity, clarity, logic, grandeur, and because of the exterior dispositions which distinguish the plan in three distinct parts—the public spaces, auditorium, and stage ... &#x27;you have greatly improved your project since the first competition; whereas Ginain [the first-place winner in the first phase] has ruined his.&#x27;&quot;

Soon the thirty-five-year-old and relatively unknown Garnier began work on the building, which eventually would be named for him, the Palais Garnier. Many people had difficulty in deciding exactly what style he was trying to portray. When asked by Empress Eugénie in what style the building was to be done, he is said to have replied: &quot;Why Ma&#x27;am, in Napoleon Trois, and you complain!&quot;

Construction began in the summer of 1861, though setbacks would delay it for another fourteen years. During the first week of excavation, an underground stream was discovered, rendering the ground too unstable for a foundation. It required eight months for the water to be pumped out, though enough was left in the area which eventually became the fifth cellar for operating the hydraulic stage machinery above. Garnier&#x27;s double-walled and bitumen-sealed cement and concrete foundation proved strong enough to withstand any possible leakages, and construction continued.
The defeat of the French army by the Prussians at the Battle of Sedan in 1870 resulted in the end of the Second Empire. During the Siege of Paris and the Paris Commune in 1871, the unfinished Opera was used as a warehouse for goods, as well as a military prison.

The opera house was finally inaugurated on 5 January 1875. Many of the most prestigious monarchs of Europe attended the opening ceremony, including the President of France&#x27;s new Republic, Marshal MacMahon, the Lord Mayor of London, and King Alfonso XII of Spain.

The people who entered the massive building, spanning nearly , were generally awed by its immense size and extensive ornamentation. Claude Debussy described it as resembling a railway station on the outside, and that the interior could easily be mistaken for a Turkish bath.

Garnier&#x27;s works represent a Neo-Baroque-inspired style, popular during the Beaux-Arts period in France. He was influenced by the Italianate styles of Renaissance artisans such as Palladio, Sansovino, and Michelangelo, perhaps the result of his many visits to Greece and Rome during his lifetime. He was also a pioneer of architectural beauty as well as function; his opera was built on a framework of metal girders, unprecedented at the time. Aside from being fireproof, steel and iron was much stronger than wood, allowing it to successfully withstand the countless heavy tons of marble and other materials heaped upon it without breaking.

==Later work==

In 1872 and 1873 Garnier built a vacation home on the Italian Riviera, the Villa Garnier in Bordighera. He was one of the first to build there after the arrival of the railroad in 1871 and later contributed various private and public buildings to the town until his death in 1898. Other architectural contributions include the Grand Concert Hall of the Monte Carlo Casino (1876/79–1879, since remodeled as the Opéra de Monte-Carlo) and the Salle de Jeu Trente-et-Quarante (1880–81), both on the Place du Casino in Monte-Carlo; the Nice Astronomical Observatory (1879–88); the 117 boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris (1878–80); the Hôtel Hachette, 195 boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris (1878–1881); the Panorama Marigny in Paris (1880–82); now the Marigny Theatre); and his last work, the Magasin (storehouse) de Décors de l&#x27;Opéra on the rue Berthier in Paris (1894–95; now the Ateliers Berthier of the Odéon-Théâtre de l&#x27;Europe).

==Death==
Garnier retired from his private architectural practice in 1896, but continued to serve on juries for architectural competitions and to appear at official functions. He suffered a first stroke at 4 o&#x27;clock in the morning on 2 August 1898 while at home in Paris, and a second stroke the following evening, dying at 8 o&#x27;clock in the evening. He was interred in the Montparnasse cemetery. After his death a public monument (completed in 1902 to designs by Jean-Louis Pascal and crowned with a copy of the bust of Garnier, which had been created by Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux in 1869) was erected west of the Rotonde de l&#x27;Empereur of the Palais Garnier. The huge ornate granite pedestal was created in Aberdeen by Alexander McDonald &amp; Co.

==Quotations==

*In 1851 alors qu&#x27;il est pensionnaire à la Villa Médicis à Rome et à l&#x27;occasion d&#x27;un voyage à Athens, Garnier s&#x27;exclame en découvrant le Parthenon : &quot;Il n&#x27;y a pas à choisir entre les arts, il faut être Dieu ou architecte.&quot;
*&quot;Les ingénieurs ont de fréquentes occasions d&#x27;employer le fer en grandes parties, et c&#x27;est sur cette matière que plus d&#x27;un fonde l&#x27;espoir d&#x27;une architecture nouvelle. Je lui dis tout de suite, c&#x27;est là une erreur. Le fer est un moyen, ce ne sera jamais un principe.&quot;

<doc id="771980" wikidata="Q29042997" url="?curid=771980" title="Double-barrelled name">
<text>A double-barrelled name is a type of compound surname, typically featuring two words (occasionally more), often joined by a hyphen. Notable people with double-barrelled names include Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Beyoncé Knowles-Carter.

In the Western tradition of surnames, there are several types of double surname (or double-barrelled surname). If the two names are joined with a hyphen, it may also be called a hyphenated surname. The word &quot;barrel&quot; possibly refers to the barrel of a shotgun, as in &quot;double-barreled shotgun&quot; or &quot;double-barreled rifle&quot;.

In British tradition, a double surname is heritable, usually taken to preserve a family name that would have become extinct due to the absence of male descendants bearing the name, connected to the inheritance of a family estate. Examples include Harding-Rolls, Stopford-Sackville, and Spencer-Churchill.

In Spanish tradition, double surnames are the norm and not an indication of social status. People used to take the (first) surname of their fathers, followed by the (first) surname of their mothers (i.e., their maternal grandfathers&#x27;s surname). In Spain (since 2000) and Chile (since 2022), parents can choose the order of the last names of their children, with the provision that all children from the same couple need to have them in the same order; the double surname itself is not heritable. These names are combined without hyphen (but optionally using &quot;y&quot;, which means &quot;and&quot; in Spanish). In addition to this, there are heritable double surnames (&quot;apellidos compuestos&quot;), which are mostly but not always combined with a hyphen. Hyphenated last names usually correspond to both last names of one of the parents, but both last names can be hyphenated, so some Hispanics may legally have two double-barrelled last names corresponding to both last names of both parents. Many Spanish scholars use a pen name, where they enter a hyphen between their last names to avoid being misrepresented in citations.

In German tradition, double surnames can be taken upon marriage, written with or without hyphen, combining the husband&#x27;s surname with the wife&#x27;s (more recently, the sequence has become optional under some legislations). These double surnames are &quot;alliance names&quot; (&quot;Allianznamen&quot;).

==British tradition==
===Unhyphenated double-barrelled names===
Many double-barrelled names are written without a hyphen, causing confusion as to whether the surname is double-barrelled or not. Notable persons with unhyphenated double-barrelled names include politicians David Lloyd George (who used the hyphen when appointed to the peerage) and Iain Duncan Smith, composers Ralph Vaughan Williams and Andrew Lloyd Webber, military historian B. H. Liddell Hart, soldier and translator C. K. Scott Moncrieff, evolutionary biologist John Maynard Smith, astronomers Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Robert Hanbury Brown, actresses Kristin Scott Thomas and Helena Bonham Carter (the last of whom has said the hyphen is optional, and indeed several of her relatives use it in their names), footballer Emile Smith Rowe, musician Romy Madley Croft, and comedian Sacha Baron Cohen (whose cousins, psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen and film-maker Ash Baron-Cohen, use the hyphen in their names).

In Wales, many families have double-barrelled surnames. The preponderance of only a few surnames (such as Jones, Williams, and Davies) led to the usage of double-barrelled names in Wales to avoid confusion of unrelated but similarly named people.

===Double-barrelled surnames===
Many British noble or gentry families have double-barrelled surnames, examples of which include Bowes-Lyon, Bulwer-Lytton, Cavendish-Bentinck, Chetwynd-Talbot, Crichton-Stuart, Douglas-Hamilton, Douglas-Home, FitzAlan-Howard, Gascoyne-Cecil, Gathorne-Hardy, Gordon-Lennox, Hely-Hutchinson, Innes-Ker, Monckton-Arundell, Petty-Fitzmaurice, Pleydell-Bouverie, Sackville-West, Scudamore-Stanhope, Spencer-Churchill, and Windsor-Clive. An example of an unhyphenated double-barrelled surname is that of the Holmes à Court family, which includes the Barons Heytesbury.

===Triple-barrelled surnames===
A few British noble or gentry families have triple-barrelled surnames, examples of which include Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe, Baillie-Hamilton-Arden, Cave-Browne-Cave, Douglas-Scott-Montagu, Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, Lyon-Dalberg-Acton, Pelham-Clinton-Hope, Smith-Dorrien-Smith, Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Venables-Vernon-Harcourt, and Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes. These indicate &quot;prima facie&quot; the inheritance of multiple estates and thus the consolidation of great wealth. They are sometimes created when the legator has a double-barrelled name and the legatee has a single surname, or vice versa. Nowadays, such names are almost always abbreviated in everyday usage to a single or double-barrelled version. For example, actress Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe calls herself Isabella Calthorpe. There is at least one instance of an unhyphenated triple-barrelled surname: that of the Montagu Douglas Scott family, to which the Dukes of Buccleuch belong.

===Quadruple- and quintuple-barrelled surnames===
There are even a few quadruple-barrelled surnames. These include Cameron-Ramsay-Fairfax-Lucy, Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis, Hovell-Thurlow-Cumming-Bruce, Lane Fox Pitt-Rivers, Montagu-Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie, Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, and Stirling-Home-Drummond-Moray. The surname of the extinct family of the Dukes of Buckingham and Chandos was the quintuple-barrelled Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville.

==Traditions on Iberian Peninsula==

In Spain, surnames are strictly regulated by the Civil Code and the Law of the Civil Registry. When a person is born, the law requires them to take the first surname of the father and then the first surname of the mother. Thus, when D. Julio Iglesias de la Cueva and Dª Isabel Preysler Arrastía had a son named Enrique, he legally was Enrique Iglesias Preysler. On the other hand, actual double-barrelled names exist (called &quot;apellidos compuestos&quot;), such as Calvo-Sotelo or López-Portillo. For example, Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo y Bustelo is the son of Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo and Mercedes Bustelo Vázquez. Such names may reflect the attempt to preserve a family name that would be lost without this practice. The creation of such names must be approved by request to the Ministry of the Interior.

Spain&#x27;s hidalgo families often used double-barrelled names in conjunction with the nobiliary particle &quot;de&quot; (of). Toponymic family such as the surnames García de las Heras, Pérez de Arce, or López de Haro combine a regular family name with the branch of the family. For example, the &quot;López&quot; branch hailing from the Rioja town of Haro, La Rioja. Surnames associated with Spanish nobility follow the same custom, such as Álvarez de Toledo, Ramírez de Arellano, or Fernández de Córdoba. In these cases, the first surname indicates the original name of the family, whereas the second surname denotes the nobiliary fief of that family. In this context, the conjunction &quot;de&quot; (of) reflects that the family used to be the feudal lords of that place. Thus, the Ramírez were the lords of the village of Arellano, in Navarra.

In Portugal, where most of the population have two to four surnames (&quot;apelidos de família&quot;), the practice of using a double combination of surnames is very common. The person can either use a paternal and a maternal surname combined (Aníbal Cavaco Silva) or use a double last name that has been passed down through one of the parents (António Lobo Antunes). The last surname (normally the paternal one) is usually considered the &quot;most important&quot;, but people may choose to use another one, often favouring the more resonant or less common of their surnames in their daily or professional life (such as Manuel Alegre or José Manuel Barroso, who is known in Portugal by his double surname Durão Barroso). The use of more than two surnames in public life is less common, but not unusual (see Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen). Combined surnames of two gentry families from Portugal are also prevalent, such as Nogueira Ferrão.

One historic early aviator, Alberto Santos-Dumont, is known to have not only often used an equal sign (=) between his two surnames in place of a hyphen but also seems to have preferred that practice, to display equal respect for his father&#x27;s French ethnicity and the Brazilian nationality of his mother.

==Germanic tradition==

In Germany, a double surname () is generally joined with a single hyphen. Other types of double surnames are not accepted by German name law. However, exceptions are made for immigrants and for marriages where the double surname was already the official name of one partner before marriage. A 1993 law forbids surnames with more than two components. Prior to this, it was permitted for adults (e.g., Simone Greiner-Petter-Memm and formerly Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann-Maier-Leibniz), but their children would not inherit the name. The 1993 ban was upheld by the Constitutional Court in 2009. The crew members of the World War I light cruiser were allowed to add the name &quot;Emden&quot; with a hyphen to their surname as a special honour after the war. There is the possibility that one partner can combine both names with a hyphen. Thus, one of them then bears a double name (Doppelname). (Herr Schmidt and Frau Meyer-Schmidt (or Frau Schmidt-Meyer); if there are children, the family has to decide for one family name for all of the children (Meyer or Schmidt)). Only one partner can take this option, making it impossible for both partners to have Doppelnamen (thus, there would be no Herr Meyer-Schmidt and Frau Meyer-Schmidt). Until the late twentieth century, it was only possible for a woman to add her maiden name onto that of her husband, not the other way round, therefore Ms. Schmidt would become Mrs. Meyer-Schmidt. This tradition has continued for the most part.

In Switzerland, double surnames are traditionally written with a hyphen and combine the surnames of a married couple, with the husband&#x27;s surname in first place and the wife&#x27;s second. This double name is called &quot;alliance name&quot; (). The first name as such, however, is the official family name, which will be inherited by their legitimate children. So, for example, if Werner Stauffacher is married to Gertrud Baumgarten, both can use the name Stauffacher-Baumgarten. Their children, however, bear only the surname Stauffacher. Prominent bearers of an alliance name are Micheline Calmy-Rey (former Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs), Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf (former Federal Minister for Finance), and Johann Schneider-Ammann (former Federal Minister for the Economy). While it is traditional for the family name to be that of the husband, either name may be chosen, with the person who changes their surname being allowed to add a hyphen to their original name. Alternatively, both partners may keep their own name and choose which of the surnames is passed on to children upon the birth of their first child.

Doubling of surnames is also practised by the Dutch. An example is the name of footballer Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, his name derives from &quot;the 17th century, when two farming families in the Enschede area of the Netherlands intermarried. Both the Vennegoor and Hesselink names carried equal social weight, and so – rather than choose between them – they chose to use both. &quot;Of&quot; in Dutch translates to &quot;or&quot;, which means that a strict translation of his name reads Jan Vennegoor or Hesselink.&quot; Some of these Dutch surnames also survive in South Africa, for example, the rugby player Rohan Janse van Rensburg&#x27;s surname is Janse van Rensburg, not just van Rensburg (which is itself an existing surname). In addition, it was common for a wife to be known by her husband&#x27;s surname (first) and her original/birth name (second) hyphenated. Nowadays, couples can choose any combination of surnames for official use (although their legal name will remain unchanged). It remains most prevalent for the wife either to use a hyphenated surname or her original/birth name. Few husbands use a hyphenated surname. All children of a couple need to go by the same surname (either their father&#x27;s or their mother&#x27;s) and will not normally have a hyphenated surname.

==Scandinavia==

Denmark has a tradition of double surnames originating in the 19th century. This was a result of two naming acts obliging commoners to adopt heritable surnames, passed first for the Duchy of Schleswig in 1771 and then for Denmark proper in 1828. Most people chose their patronymic as their heritable surname, resulting in an overwhelming dominance of a few surnames.

To reduce the risk of mistaken identity, many Danes started using their mothers&#x27; original/birth names as a heritable middle name (similar to the Russian or Hispanic system), rather than as a second given name (as in the English system). One example is three successive prime ministers of Denmark all sharing the same last name, Rasmussen, so they are usually referred to by their middle name: Nyrup, Fogh, and Løkke.

Currently, the Danish order of names invariably places the patronymic &quot;-sen&quot; at the end, regardless of whether that name has been passed down by the father or mother, or adopted through marriage. Unlike the Russian or Hispanic systems, this surname-style middle name is not considered a proper last name in official documents, unless hyphenated into one compound name.

==Poland==

In Poland, a double surname (, &quot;complex surname&quot;) is generally joined with a hyphen. Polish surnames (, singular), like those in most of Europe, are hereditary and generally patrilineal, i.e., passed from the father to his children. A married woman usually adopts her husband&#x27;s name. However, other combinations are legally possible. The wife may keep her original/birth name (, literally: &quot;maiden surname&quot;) or add her husband&#x27;s surname to hers, thus creating a double name (&quot;nazwisko złożone&quot;). A married man can also adopt his wife&#x27;s surname, or add it to his. Polish triple-barreled surnames are known to exist: an example is the one borne by , a university professor and writer living in Canada.

==Russia==
In Russia, double-barreled surnames are somewhat uncommon, but normal and accepted practice, often associated with some families of note wishing to preserve both of their lineages. Federal law #143-FZ &quot;On Civil State Acts&quot; explicitly allows double-barreled names in its Article 18 but limits such compound surnames to two parts only.
Статья 18. Запись фамилии, имени и отчества ребенка при государственной регистрации рождения

1. При государственной регистрации рождения фамилия ребенка записывается по фамилии его родителей. При разных фамилиях родителей по соглашению родителей ребенку присваивается фамилия отца, фамилия матери или двойная фамилия, образованная посредством присоединения фамилий отца и матери друг к другу в любой последовательности, если иное не предусмотрено законами субъектов Российской Федерации. Не допускается изменение последовательности присоединения фамилий отца и матери друг к другу при образовании двойных фамилий у полнородных братьев и сестер. Двойная фамилия ребенка может состоять не более чем из двух слов, соединенных при написании дефисом.

Article 18. Recording a child&#x27;s surname, first name, and patronymic during state registration of birth

1. During state registration of birth, the surname of the child is recorded according to the surname of his parents. With different surnames of the parents, by agreement of the parents, the child is assigned the surname of the father, the surname of the mother, or a double surname formed by joining the surnames of the father and mother to each other in any sequence, unless otherwise provided by the laws of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation. It is not allowed to change the sequence of joining the surnames of the father and mother to each other when forming double surnames for full brothers and sisters. The double surname of the child may consist of no more than two words, connected when written with a hyphen.

==Turkish tradition==
Turkish tradition offers options to couples for naming conventions after marriage. Renewing the national identity card to reflect the changes presents two options: one is to use the man&#x27;s surname for the newly formed family surname, the second is to use two surnames for the family, noting that one is the bride&#x27;s original/birth surname, the latter is the groom&#x27;s surname.

==French Canadian tradition==
Until the late 19th century, some French Canadian families had a &quot;nom-dit&quot; tradition. This was a family nickname (literally a &quot;said name&quot;). The origins of the noms-dits were various. Some noms-dits were the war-name of the first settler, while he was a soldier: Hébert dit Jolicœur (&quot;pretty heart&quot;, cf. &quot;Braveheart&quot;), Thomas dit Tranchemontagne (&quot;mountain chopper&quot;). Some denoted the place of origin of the first settler: Langevin (&quot;Anjou&quot;), Barbeau dit Poitevin (&quot;Poitou&quot;). Others denoted a characteristic of the person or of his dwelling: Lacourse (&quot;the run&quot;), Lépine (&quot;the thorn&quot;), Larivière (&quot;the river&quot;).

==China==
Most Chinese surnames are a single character. However, in modern times, some families have combined the surnames of both parents to create new names. Some examples of double-barrelled surnames include the Changchien (張簡) clan in Taiwan, being a combination of the surnames Zhang and Jian. This practice is different from having a Chinese compound surname, where more than one character is used in a surname.

In 2007, Chinese officials suggested that parents should be encouraged to create two-syllable (two-character) surnames for their children by combining their parents&#x27; (one-syllable) surnames; this could make people&#x27;s names more unique and &quot;could help solve the problem of widely recurring names&quot;.

==Nigeria==
In Nigeria, a double-barrelled surname is adopted when an aristocratic woman marries a lower-ranked man. It also occurs when a ruling family adopts the forename of their patriarch as part of their surname to distinguish themselves from others who might share their surname. An example of the former is that of the Vaughan-Richards family, a branch of the Nigerian royal-turned-American emancipated slave Prince Scipio Vaughan, who maintain their mother&#x27;s last name as well as their father&#x27;s. An example of the latter is that of the royal family of King Adeniji Adele of Lagos, who are distinguished from their numerous Adele cousins by the use of the double-barrelled name &quot;Adeniji-Adele&quot;.

==Philippines==
The Filipino naming tradition is derived from the Hispanic system but was influenced by the American (Anglo-Saxon) naming tradition when the Philippines became a United States colony in 1901.
A child will customarily carry the mother&#x27;s original/birth name as the middle name and carry the father&#x27;s surname. When a woman marries, she keeps her original/birth surname and adds the husband&#x27;s surname, but does not typically hyphenate it. So, when Maria Santos Aguon marries José Lujan Castro, her name becomes Maria Aguon Castro, and their children will typically carry the middle name Aguon and the surname Castro.

The use of the maternal surname as a middle name derives from American influence, with Filipinos adopting English naming customs, when they once used Spanish naming customs, which use two surnames (paternal and maternal) joined with the particle &quot;y&quot; (or &quot;e&quot; before ). This still remains in use but is restricted to formal purposes, police records, and legal proceedings. In the original Spanish naming system, the middle name corresponds to the paternal surname, not the maternal one. In the Philippines, this middle name (or the maternal surname) is often abbreviated to a middle initial. Thus, a person with the full name Juan Santos Macaraig may become Juan S. Macaraig, whereas according to the Spanish naming system, they would be Juan Macaraig y Santos.

However, the maternal surname may not always be the middle name. In some cases, a second given name may be abbreviated instead, as is the case for Jose P. Laurel.

==Recent developments==
Since the late 20th century, increasingly permissive legislation on the inheritance of surnames in Western countries has led to the emergence of non-traditional or &quot;ad hoc&quot; combined surnames.
For example, Hispanic American politician Antonio Villar and his wife Corina Raigosa adopted the &quot;blended&quot; surname &quot;Villaraigosa&quot; upon their marriage in 1987.

In Belgium and Germany, member states of the European Union, courts have refused to register children under the surname given according to a foreign naming tradition.

In France, a practice abolished in 2010 was to use two consecutive hyphens (--) (not the same as a &quot;long hyphen&quot; or dash, or with a double hyphen) to distinguish between recently formed double surnames and ancient hyphenated family names (). The use of double surnames is legal but not customary. Children traditionally take on their father&#x27;s surname (or, more recently, optionally their mother&#x27;s).

In Canada, especially Quebec, it is common for children born since the 1970s to bear both parents&#x27; surnames, with no established rules as to whether the father&#x27;s or mother&#x27;s name should come first. (In Quebec, under the provisions of the Civil Code enacted in 1980, both spouses must retain their original surnames upon marriage.) This situation was frequent enough that naming laws had to be amended in the early 1990s, when those with double surnames began to marry and wished to give their children double surnames. In such cases, any combination involving at most two elements of the father&#x27;s or the mother&#x27;s surname is permitted.

In Italy, a 2016 court ruling held that the previous law, under which children automatically took their father&#x27;s surname as long as the parents were married or the father recognised the child, was discriminatory; the government therefore clarified that the mother&#x27;s surname could also be added if both parents so desired, providing that it followed the father&#x27;s surname. A further court case in 2022 found that this latter requirement was also discriminatory. Consequently, parents have since been able to give their children one or both of their surnames, in any order.

Finland liberalised their name law in 2017, allowing double surnames in some cases, either hyphenated or as such. A double name can be formed when marrying or having children, combining the surnames of the parents. Double names can be combined by taking one part of each. Either spouse or both can take a double name. Based on a family&#x27;s foreign name tradition, children can also get surnames based on a grandparent&#x27;s surname. The former law, from 1985, allowed either taking a spouse&#x27;s surname and optionally continuing using one&#x27;s own surname as a hyphen-joined prefix, but formally, a person did not get a double surname, and their children got the spouse&#x27;s surname.

With the rise of same-sex marriage, many same-sex couples have hyphenated each other&#x27;s names upon marriage. For instance, American attorney and former chair of the Libertarian National Committee Joe Bishop-Henchman changed his surname from Henchman upon marriage to his husband Ethan Bishop, who also changed his surname to Bishop-Henchman at that time.

<text>Hans Erasmus Aßmann, Freiherr von Abschatz (4 February 1646 – 22 April 1699) was a German statesman and poet from the second Silesian school.

==Life==

Abschatz was born at Würbitz (Wierzbnica) in Lower Silesia in the Bohemian crown lands of the Holy Roman Empire. Even though his parents died early, Abschatz attended college in Liegnitz and then studied law at the universities of Strasbourg and Leyden. This was followed by a three-year travel to Belgium, France, and Italy. Returning to Silesia at the age of 23, he assumed the administration of his estate and married Anna von Hund in 1669. His financial condition was favourable and his private life fortunate, only disturbed by the death of few close relatives.

With the death of the last Silesian Piast (Duke George William) and the annexation of Silesia to Austria, the talent he showed in the administration of his manors led Abschatz to enter political life. He was twice a representative to the imperial court at Vienna: the first time as a syndic for the Duchy of Liegnitz, the second time as a representative for all Silesian lands. Emperor Leopold I made him a baron (&quot;Freiherr&quot;). In 1679, Abschatz was elected to be a permanent deputy of Legnica to the diet of the Silesian sovereigns (the so-called &quot;Fürstentage&quot; in Breslau).

Through his public service, he gained the respect of his fellow countrymen and acquired what he once claimed to be the highest tribute to a life&#x27;s work — an inscription on his tombstone saying &quot;he was an honest man in his fatherland&quot;.

== Poet ==
Abschatz is considered to be a member of the school of poetry called &quot;second Silesian school&quot; (&quot;Zweite Schlesische Schule&quot;), together with writers such as Daniel Casper von Lohenstein, Andreas Gryphius, Gottfried Benjamin Hancke and Christian Hoffmann von Hoffmannswaldau. He was a close friend of Lohenstein. Abschatz was also an accurate translator, translating &quot;Il pastor fido&quot;.

Today, Abschatz is notable by the very fact that he — a nobleman — was interested in poetry at all. At that time, it was seen as a sign of change in the attitude towards literature and signaled that Germany could keep pace with the literary development of France and England. He also alluded to his hopes in this direction. He is quoted that:

<text>Jonathan Dimbleby (born 31 July 1944) is a British presenter of current affairs and political radio and television programmes, author and historian. He is the son of Richard Dimbleby and younger brother of television presenter David Dimbleby.

==Education==
Dimbleby was educated at Charterhouse, a boys&#x27; independent school in Surrey. He later studied farm management at the Royal Agricultural College and graduated in 1965. He then studied philosophy at University College, London. He was later elected an honorary fellow but resigned in 2015 in protest at the forced resignation of Tim Hunt as an honorary fellow.

In July 2007 he received an honorary degree from the University of Exeter. He is an Honorary Fellow of Bath Spa University (2006) and holds an Honorary Doctorate from the University of the West of England (2018).

==TV and radio career==
Dimbleby began his career at the BBC in Bristol in 1969. In 1970 he joined &quot;The World at One&quot; as a reporter, where he also presented &quot;The World This Weekend&quot;. In 1972 he joined ITV&#x27;s flagship current affairs programme &quot;This Week&quot; and over the following six years reported on crises in many parts of the world. His coverage of the 1973 Ethiopian famine, &quot;The Unknown Famine,&quot; was followed by TV and radio appeals which raised a record sum nationally and internationally. His report, for which he won the SFTA Richard Dimbleby Award, was used by the incoming regime to justify the overthrow of the Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie.

In 1978 he wrote and presented the ITV series &quot;Jonathan Dimbleby in South America&quot;. In 1979 he joined Yorkshire Television, where he wrote and presented three ITV network series: &quot;Jonathan Dimbleby In Search of the American Dream&quot; (1976), &quot;The Bomb&quot; (1979), &quot;The Eagle and The Bear&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Cold War Game&quot; (1981). He also presented the ITV documentary series &quot;First Tuesday&quot;. In 1985 he joined TV-am as presenter of &quot;Jonathan Dimbleby on Sunday&quot;. In 1986 he returned to ITV as presenter of &quot;This Week&quot;. 

In 1988 he joined the BBC to present the new flagship political programme &quot;On the Record&quot; (1988–1993). He wrote, presented and co-produced two documentary series: &quot;The Last Governor&quot; (BBC1 1997) about the final five years of British rule in Hong Kong, and &quot;&quot; (ITV 1994), in which (the then) Prince Charles spoke about his first marriage and his relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles, now his wife and Queen of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth Realms.

From 1994 to 2006 he presented ITV&#x27;s political programme, &quot;Jonathan Dimbleby&quot;. He anchored ITV&#x27;s general election coverage in 1997, 2001 and 2005. He wrote and presented &quot;Russia with Jonathan Dimbleby&quot; (BBC2, 2008), &quot;An African Journey with Jonathan Dimbleby&quot; (2010), and &quot;A South American Journey with Jonathan Dimbleby&quot; (2011). In 2013 he wrote and presented &quot;Churchill&#x27;s Desert War&quot; (BBC2) based on his book, &quot;Destiny in The Desert&quot;. In 2015 he wrote and presented the two-part series &quot;The BBC At War&quot; (BBC2).

From 1987 to June 2019 he presented &quot;Any Questions?&quot; on BBC Radio 4. He presented &quot;Any Answers?&quot; from 1989 to 2012. From 2016 to 2019, he was the main presenter of the BBC World Service monthly series &quot;World Questions&quot;.

In April 2020, Dimbleby wrote and presented the ITV documentary &quot;Return to Belsen with Jonathan Dimbleby&quot; about the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.

In 2022, following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, Dimbleby wrote and presented the documentary &quot;Charles, the Monarch and the Man&quot;, which aired on ITV on 13 September 2022.

==Other work==
Dimbleby wanted to be a farmer when he left school and worked on the Royal Farm, Windsor, trained as a professional showjumper and studied at the Royal Agricultural College (now University) at Cirencester. From 1993 until 2004 he ran an organic farm near Bath, Somerset.

He is a past president of Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO), of the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), of the Soil Association and of the RSPB. He is chair of the Richard Dimbleby Cancer Fund, the charity established in 1966 in memory of his father. He was chairman of the Index on Censorship&#x27;s Board of Trustees from 2008 until 2013, when he was succeeded by David Aaronovitch. He is patron of several other charities.

==Family==
Dimbleby is the son of the Second World War war correspondent Richard Dimbleby, who was later to become presenter of the BBC TV current affairs programme &quot;Panorama&quot;. His elder brother David Dimbleby is also a commentator on current affairs and presenter of BBC programmes. Jonathan wrote a biography of his father in 1975.

Dimbleby married author, journalist, and broadcaster Bel Mooney in 1968. They have two children: Kitty, a journalist; and Daniel, a television producer. In May 2003, Dimbleby began a relationship with the soprano Susan Chilcott, with whom he lived until her death from breast cancer in September 2003. Later that year Dimbleby and Mooney separated, and in 2006 they were divorced. In 2007 Dimbleby married Jessica Ray. They have two daughters, Daisy and Gwendolen, and live in Bristol.

<doc id="771986" wikidata="Q949302" url="?curid=771986" title="Skin condition">
<text>A skin condition, also known as cutaneous condition, is any medical condition that affects the integumentary system—the organ system that encloses the body and includes skin, nails, and related muscle and glands. The major function of this system is as a barrier against the external environment.

Conditions of the human integumentary system constitute a broad spectrum of diseases, also known as dermatoses, as well as many nonpathologic states (like, in certain circumstances, melanonychia and racquet nails). While only a small number of skin diseases account for most visits to the physician, thousands of skin conditions have been described. Classification of these conditions often presents many nosological challenges, since underlying causes and pathogenetics are often not known. Therefore, most current textbooks present a classification based on location (for example, conditions of the mucous membrane), morphology (chronic blistering conditions), cause (skin conditions resulting from physical factors), and so on.

Clinically, the diagnosis of any particular skin condition begins by gathering pertinent information of the presenting skin lesion(s), including: location (e.g. arms, head, legs); symptoms (pruritus, pain); duration (acute or chronic); arrangement (solitary, generalized, , linear); morphology (macules, papules, vesicles); and color (red, yellow, etc.). Some diagnoses may also require a skin biopsy which yields histologic information that can be correlated with the clinical presentation and any laboratory data. The introduction of cutaneous ultrasound has allowed the detection of cutaneous tumors, inflammatory processes, and skin diseases.

== Layer of skin involved ==
The skin weighs an average of , covers an area of about , and is made of three distinct layers: the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue. The two main types of human skin are glabrous skin, the nonhairy skin on the palms and soles (also referred to as the &quot;palmoplantar&quot; surfaces), and hair-bearing skin. Within the latter type, hairs in structures called pilosebaceous units have a hair follicle, sebaceous gland, and associated arrector pili muscle. In the embryo, the epidermis, hair, and glands are from the ectoderm, which is chemically influenced by the underlying mesoderm that forms the dermis and subcutaneous tissues.

=== Epidermis ===
The epidermis is the most superficial layer of skin, a squamous epithelium with several strata: the stratum corneum, stratum lucidum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale. Nourishment is provided to these layers via diffusion from the dermis, since the epidermis is without direct blood supply. The epidermis contains four cell types: keratinocytes, melanocytes, Langerhans cells, and Merkel cells. Of these, keratinocytes are the major component, constituting roughly 95% of the epidermis. This stratified squamous epithelium is maintained by cell division within the stratum basale, in which differentiating cells slowly displace outwards through the stratum spinosum to the stratum corneum, where cells are continually shed from the surface. In normal skin, the rate of production equals the rate of loss; about two weeks are needed for a cell to migrate from the basal cell layer to the top of the granular cell layer, and an additional two weeks to cross the stratum corneum.

=== Dermis ===
The dermis is the layer of skin between the epidermis and subcutaneous tissue, and comprises two sections, the papillary dermis and the reticular dermis. The superficial papillary dermis with the overlying rete ridges of the epidermis, between which the two layers interact through the basement membrane zone. Structural components of the dermis are collagen, elastic fibers, and ground substance also called extra fibrillar matrix. Within these components are the pilosebaceous units, arrector pili muscles, and the eccrine and apocrine glands. The dermis contains two vascular networks that run parallel to the skin surface—one superficial and one deep plexus—which are connected by vertical communicating vessels. The function of blood vessels within the dermis is fourfold: to supply nutrition, to regulate temperature, to modulate inflammation, and to participate in wound healing.

=== Subcutaneous tissue ===
The subcutaneous tissue is a layer of fat between the dermis and underlying fascia. This tissue may be further divided into two components, the actual fatty layer, or panniculus adiposus, and a deeper vestigial layer of muscle, the panniculus carnosus. The main cellular component of this tissue is the adipocyte, or fat cell. The structure of this tissue is composed of septal (i.e. linear strands) and lobular compartments, which differ in microscopic appearance. Functionally, the subcutaneous fat insulates the body, absorbs trauma, and serves as a reserve energy source.

== Diseases of the skin ==
Diseases of the skin include skin infections and skin neoplasms (including skin cancer).

== History ==

In 1572, Geronimo Mercuriali of Forlì, Italy, completed (&#x27;On the diseases of the skin&#x27;). It is considered the first scientific work dedicated to dermatology. 

== Diagnoses ==
The physical examination of the skin and its appendages, as well as the mucous membranes, forms the cornerstone of an accurate diagnosis of cutaneous conditions. Most of these conditions present with cutaneous surface changes termed &quot;lesions,&quot; which have more or less distinct characteristics. Often proper examination will lead the physician to obtain appropriate historical information and/or laboratory tests that are able to confirm the diagnosis. Upon examination, the important clinical observations are the (1) morphology, (2) configuration, and (3) distribution of the lesion(s). With regard to morphology, the initial lesion that characterizes a condition is known as the &quot;primary lesion&quot;, and identification of such a lesions is the most important aspect of the cutaneous examination. Over time, these primary lesions may continue to develop or be modified by regression or trauma, producing &quot;secondary lesions&quot;. However, with that being stated, the lack of standardization of basic dermatologic terminology has been one of the principal barriers to successful communication among physicians in describing cutaneous findings. Nevertheless, there are some commonly accepted terms used to describe the macroscopic morphology, configuration, and distribution of skin lesions, which are listed below.

== Lesions ==
=== Primary lesions ===
* Macule: A macule is a change in surface color, without elevation or depression, so nonpalpable, well or ill-defined, variously sized, but generally considered less than either 5 or 10 mm in diameter at the widest point.
* Patch: A patch is a large macule equal to or greater than either 5 or 10 mm across, depending on one&#x27;s definition of a macule. Patches may have some subtle surface change, such as a fine scale or wrinkling, but although the consistency of the surface is changed, the lesion itself is not palpable.
* Papule: A papule is a circumscribed, solid elevation of skin, varying in size from less than either 5 or 10 mm in diameter at the widest point.
* Plaque: A plaque has been described as a broad papule, or confluence of papules equal to or greater than 10 mm, or alternatively as an elevated, plateau-like lesion that is greater in its diameter than in its depth.
* Nodule: A nodule is morphologically similar to a papule in that it is also a palpable spherical lesion less than 10 mm in diameter. However, it is differentiated by being centered deeper in the dermis or subcutis.
* Tumor: Similar to a nodule, but it is larger than 10 mm in diameter.
* Vesicle: A vesicle or &quot;bleb&quot; is a small blister, a circumscribed, epidermal elevation generally considered less than either 5 or 10 mm in diameter at the widest point.
* Bulla: A bulla is a large blister, a rounded or irregularly shaped blister equal to or greater than either 5 or 10 mm, depending on one&#x27;s definition of a vesicle.

* Pustule: A pustule is a small elevation of the skin usually consisting of necrotic inflammatory cells.
* Cyst: A cyst is an epithelial-lined cavity.
* Wheal: A wheal is a rounded or flat-topped, pale red papule or plaque that is characteristically evanescent, disappearing within 24 to 48 hours. The temporary raised skin on the site of a properly delivered intradermal (ID) injection is also called a welt, with the ID injection process itself frequently referred to as simply &quot;raising a wheal&quot; in medical texts.
* Welts: Welts occur as a result of blunt force being applied to the body with elongated objects without sharp edges.
* Telangiectasia: A telangiectasia represents an enlargement of superficial blood vessels to the point of being visible.
* Burrow: A burrow appears as a slightly elevated, grayish, tortuous line in the skin, and is caused by burrowing organisms.

=== Secondary lesions ===
* Scale: Dry or greasy laminated masses of keratin, they represent thickened stratum corneum.
* Crust: Dried sebum usually mixed with epithelial and sometimes bacterial debris
* Lichenification: Epidermal thickening characterized by visible and palpable thickening of the skin with accentuated skin markings
* Erosion: An erosion is a discontinuity of the skin exhibiting incomplete loss of the epidermis, a lesion that is moist, circumscribed, and usually depressed.
* Excoriation: A punctate or linear abrasion produced by mechanical means (often scratching), usually involving only the epidermis, but commonly reaching the papillary dermis.
* Ulcer: An ulcer is a discontinuity of the skin exhibiting complete loss of the epidermis and often portions of the dermis.
* Fissure is a lesion in the skin that is usually narrow but deep.
* Induration is dermal thickening causing the cutaneous surface to feel thicker and firmer.
* Atrophy refers to a loss of skin, and can be epidermal, dermal, or subcutaneous. With epidermal atrophy, the skin appears thin, translucent, and wrinkled. Dermal or subcutaneous atrophy is represented by depression of the skin.
* Maceration: softening and turning white of the skin due to being consistently wet.
* Umbilication is formation of a depression at the top of a papule, vesicle, or pustule.
* : A tubercle on any external part of the body, such as in phymatous rosacea

=== Configuration ===
&quot;Configuration&quot; refers to how lesions are locally grouped (&quot;organized&quot;), which contrasts with how they are distributed (see next section).

* Agminate: in clusters
* Annular or circinate: ring-shaped
* Arciform or arcuate: arc-shaped
* Digitate: with finger-like projections
* Discoid or nummular: round or disc-shaped
* Figurate: with a particular shape
* Guttate: resembling drops
* Gyrate: coiled or spiral-shaped
* Herpetiform: resembling herpes
* Linear
* Mammillated: with rounded, breast-like projections
* Reticular or reticulated: resembling a net
* Serpiginous: with a wavy border
* Stellate: star-shaped
* Targetoid: resembling a bullseye
* Verrucous or Verruciform: wart-like
=== Distribution ===
&quot;Distribution&quot; refers to how lesions are localized. They may be confined to a single area (a patch) or may be in several places. Some distributions correlate with the means by which a given area becomes affected. For example, contact dermatitis correlates with locations where allergen has elicited an allergic immune response. Varicella zoster virus is known to recur (after its initial presentation as chicken pox) as herpes zoster (&quot;shingles&quot;). Chicken pox appears nearly everywhere on the body, but herpes zoster tends to follow one or two dermatomes; for example, the eruptions may appear along the bra line, on either or both sides of the patient.
* Generalized
* Symmetric: one side mirrors the other
* Flexural: on the front of the fingers
* Extensor: on the back of the fingers
* Intertriginous: in an area where two skin areas may touch or rub together
* Morbilliform: resembling measles
* Palmoplantar: on the palm of the hand or bottom of the foot
* Periorificial: around an orifice such as the mouth
* Periungual/subungual: around or under a fingernail or toenail
* Blaschkoid: following the path of Blaschko&#x27;s lines in the skin
* Photodistributed: in places where sunlight reaches
* Zosteriform or dermatomal: associated with a particular nerve

<text>Bocholt () is a city in the north-west of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, part of the district Borken. It is situated 4 km ( miles) south of the border with the Netherlands. Suderwick is part of Bocholt and is situated at the border annex to Dinxperlo.

==Geography==
The northern border of the city of Bocholt is the German border with the Netherlands. Bocholt borders the district of Wesel, in the administrative region of Düsseldorf, in the southwest.

Bocholt is bordered in the north by the Dutch municipalities of Aalten and Winterswijk, in the east by the city of Rhede, in the south by the city of Hamminkeln, and in the west by the city of Isselburg.

The climate in the region of Bocholt and West Münsterland is temperate with distinct maritime influences, with very mild winters in comparison to other German regions because of the proximity to the ocean and the low elevation. Summers are moderately warm. The average temperature in January is 2.7 °C (37 °F) and in July 18.4 °C (65 °F).

In the average year there are 12 days of snow cover, about 31 sunny days (high temperature of 25 °C; 77 °F or higher) and 6 hot days (30 °C; 86 °F or higher) on average. In the average year there is about 750 mm (30&quot;) of precipitation, with June (78 mm; 3&quot;) and April (41 mm; &quot;) being the driest months.

==History==
Bocholt was first written about in 779, when Charlemagne won a battle against the Saxons nearby. However the settlement was probably much older. Bishop Dietrich III von Isenburg from Münster gave Bocholt city rights in 1222.

In the 15th century the city flourished. The engraver Israhel van Meckenem lived and worked in the city.

Between 1803 and 1810 Bocholt was the capital of the Principality of Salm. The Principality of Salm was governed by the prince of Salm-Salm and the prince of Salm-Kyrburg.

During the Second World War the city survived generally unscathed until an Allied bombing raid on 22 March 1945 which destroyed most of the city. The city was then captured by the British a week later on 28 March. The city was the site of the Stalag VI-F POW camp.

In 1975 the former municipalities Barlo, Biemenhorst, Hemden, Holtwick, Liedern, Lowick, Mussum, Spork, Stenern and Suderwick were merged into Bocholt.

==Economy==
Bocholt is a manufacturing town. It was centered on the textile industry for most of the 19th and 20th centuries. Today there are still several successful textile manufacturers in town, but the importance of the textile industry has greatly declined. The major employers today in Bocholt are Gigaset (Communications) and Mechanical Drives (formerly Flender) (Siemens) - a leading manufacturer of transmissions, especially for wind energy plants. Most of Bocholt&#x27;s industries are smaller and manufacture highly specialized products. Some of them are international leaders in their particular fields - A Good example is the bicycle company ROSE Bikes. Local industries profit from cooperation with the University of Applied Sciences (Fachhochschule) also located in Bocholt as well as with similar institutions in the region.

Bocholt is also a regional centre for shopping in the West-Münsterland area and draws consumers from the neighbouring rural and small town areas of the Netherlands. The town features an attractive old town shopping area as well as a popular new shopping mall.

<doc id="772003" wikidata="Q1388702" url="?curid=772003" title="Keith Wood">
<text>Keith Wood (born 27 January 1972) is an Irish former rugby union player who played as a hooker at international level for Ireland, and the British &amp; Irish Lions. He also played at club level for Garryowen, Harlequins and Munster. He was nicknamed &#x27;The Raging Potato&#x27; because of his bald head, and as &#x27;Uncle Fester&#x27; due to his resemblance to the character in &quot;The Addams Family&quot;. Wood is considered by many to have been the best hooker in rugby union during his era, winning the inaugural World Rugby Player of the Year award, and to be among the best hookers in the history of the game.

==Early life==
Wood was born in Killaloe, County Clare, and educated at St Munchin&#x27;s College, Limerick. His father, Gordon Wood, played prop 29 times for Ireland.

==Club career==
Wood started his career with Garryowen who he helped to All Ireland titles in 1992 and 1994 before moving to Harlequins. He returned to play with Munster in the 1999–2000 season and played in the European Rugby Cup final that Munster lost to Northampton Saints 9-8 in Twickenham Stadium before returning to Harlequins.

Having returned to Harlequins in 2000 he started the 2000–01 Challenge Cup final beating Narbonne 42–33 in the final helping the club to become the first English club ever to win the tournament.

==International career==
Wood made his international debut in 1994 against Australia. He was capped 58 times for Ireland and five times for the Lions. Never the most accurate player in the set piece his real strength was in leadership and open play where he dominated the world XV&#x27;s hooker spot.

He played on the 1997 and 2001 Lions tours, and was the inaugural winner of the IRB International Player of the Year award in 2001. He played a part in the Lions&#x27; 2-1 series victory over the Springboks in 1997. Wood captained Ireland.

He scored four tries in one game in the 1999 World Cup, in the pool stage against the USA. Ireland were later eliminated from the tournament when they lost to Argentina in the quarter-final play-off.

Wood retired from playing after the 2003 World Cup. He was succeeded as Ireland captain by Brian O&#x27;Driscoll.

==Honours==
=== Individual ===
IRB player of the Year - 2001
===Club===
====Harlequins====
European Challenge Cup - 2001

==Legacy==
Wood was inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame in 2005, and to the IRB Hall of Fame in 2014.

Wood&#x27;s total of 15 full international test tries was, at his international retirement, the record for a hooker, or indeed any player in the tight five. The previous record for international tries by hookers (or players at any position in the tight five) was 12, set by Sean Fitzpatrick of the New Zealand All Blacks. Wood&#x27;s record has since been beaten for tight-five players by current USA front-rower Joe Taufete&#x27;e. Taufete&#x27;e to date has scored 22 tries as a hooker and one as a prop.

==Media work==
Wood has appearances on the BBC as a regular pundit and in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as a freelance journalist.

==Personal life==
Wood used to play hurling, and was a member of the Clare GAA side that played in the inaugural Nenagh Co-op hurling tournament in 1988. In 2018, Wood opened a café and restaurant on the main street in his native Killaloe with business partner Malcolm Bell, called Wood &amp; Bell.

<doc id="772007" wikidata="Q1766475" url="?curid=772007" title="Richard J. Daley Center">
<text>The Richard J. Daley Center, also known by its open courtyard Daley Plaza and named after longtime mayor Richard J. Daley, is the premier civic center of the City of Chicago in Illinois. The Center&#x27;s modernist skyscraper primarily houses offices and courtrooms for the Cook County Circuit Courts, Cook County State&#x27;s Attorney and additional office space for the City and the County. It is adjacent to the neoclassical City Hall-County Building, also on the plaza. The open granite-paved plaza used for gatherings, protests, and events is also the site of the Chicago Picasso, a gift to the city from the artist.

Situated on Randolph Street and Washington Street between Dearborn Street and Clark Street, the Richard J. Daley Center, with its &quot;majestic&quot; interior spaces, is considered a significant example of modernist Chicago architecture. The main building was designed in the International Style of the Second Chicago School by Jacques Brownson of the firm C. F. Murphy Associates as supervising architects, with Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill and Loebl, Schlossman, Bennett &amp; Dart as associated architects, and was completed in 1965. At the time it was the tallest building in Chicago, but only held this title for four years until the John Hancock Center was completed. Originally known as the Chicago Civic Center, the building was renamed for Mayor Daley on December 27, 1976, seven days after his death in office. The , thirty-one story building features Cor-Ten, a self-weathering steel. Cor-Ten was designed to rust, actually strengthening the structure and giving the building its distinctive red and brown color. The Daley Center has 30 floors above its double height lobby, and is the tallest flat-roofed building in the world with fewer than 40 stories (a typical building, the height of Daley Center, would have 50–60 stories).

==Building features==
The Richard J. Daley Center houses more than 120 court and hearing rooms as well as the Cook County Law Library, offices of the Clerk of the Circuit Court, and certain court-related divisions of the Sheriff&#x27;s Department. The building also houses office space for both the city and Cook County, of which the City of Chicago is its seat of government. The windows are cor-ten steel and bronze/white tinted.

==Daley Plaza==
Daley Plaza is the courtyard adjacent to the building, occupying the southern half of the block occupied by the building.

The plaza is dominated by an untitled Cor-ten steel sculpture by Pablo Picasso (usually called &quot;The Picasso&quot;). Completed in 1967, it was a gift to the City of Chicago from the artist. Though controversial for its abstract form, it quickly became a Chicago landmark. The plaza also features an in-ground fountain and an eternal flame memorial to the dead from World War I, World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War.

The plaza serves as a location for many civic functions including weekly farmers&#x27; markets in the summer, regular ethnic festivals, and the meeting place for Chicago&#x27;s Critical Mass ride.

The plaza was used extensively in the climactic scenes of the 1980 film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;. The interior of the building, as well as the plaza, the Picasso, and the neighboring James R. Thompson Center are also featured in the 1993 film &quot;The Fugitive&quot; and in 2006&#x27;s &quot;The Lake House&quot;. While filming the movie &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, instead of using the Chicago Board of Trade Building as the location for the headquarters of Wayne Enterprises as in &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, film director Christopher Nolan used the Richard J. Daley Center.

Farhad Khoiee-Abbasi, a public protester, is a frequent fixture at the southwest corner of the plaza, near City Hall. Khoiee-Abbasi has been photographed here many times, with his well-dressed appearance, his odd signs, and his general refusal to speak or acknowledge those around him making him a minor celebrity.

==Adjacent buildings==
Adjacent to the Richard J. Daley Plaza is the landmark City Hall-County Building. Declared a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it houses offices for the Mayor of Chicago, alderpersons of Chicago&#x27;s various wards, and chambers for the Chicago City Council. Directly south of the Daley Center is the Cook County Administration Building which is full of office space for County employees. Block 37 containing 108 North State Street is to the east.

<text>A steering wheel (also called a driving wheel, a hand wheel, or simply wheel) is a type of steering control in vehicles.

Steering wheels are used in most modern land vehicles, including all mass-production automobiles, buses, light and heavy trucks, as well as tractors and tanks. The steering wheel is the part of the steering system that the driver manipulates; the rest of the steering system responds to such driver inputs. This can be through direct mechanical contact as in recirculating ball or rack and pinion steering gears, without or with the assistance of hydraulic power steering, HPS, or as in some modern production cars with the help of computer-controlled motors, known as electric power steering.

==History==
Near the start of the 18th century, many sea vessels appeared using the ship&#x27;s wheel design. However, historians are unclear when that approach to steering was first used. The first automobiles were steered with a tiller, but in 1894, Alfred Vacheron took part in the Paris–Rouen race with a Panhard 4 hp model which he had fitted with a steering wheel. That is believed to be one of the earliest employments of the principle.

From 1898, the Panhard et Levassor cars were equipped as standard with steering wheels. Charles Rolls introduced the first car in Britain fitted with a steering wheel when he imported a 6 hp Panhard from France in 1898. Arthur Constantin Krebs replaced the tiller with an inclined steering wheel for the Panhard car he designed for the 1898 Paris–Amsterdam–Paris race which ran 7–13 July 1898.

In 1898, Thomas B. Jeffery and his son, Charles T. Jeffery, developed two advanced experimental cars featuring a front-mounted engine and a steering wheel mounted on the left-hand side. However, the early automaker adopted a more &quot;conventional&quot; rear-engine and tiller-steering layout for its first mass-produced Ramblers in 1902. The following year, the Rambler Model E was largely unchanged, except that it came equipped with a tiller early in the year that was changed to a steering wheel by the end of 1903. By 1904, all Ramblers featured steering wheels. Within a decade, the steering wheel had entirely replaced the tiller in automobiles.

At the insistence of Thomas B. Jeffery, the driver&#x27;s position was also moved to the left-hand side of the car during the 1903 Rambler production. Most other car makers began offering cars with left-hand drive in 1910. Soon after, most cars in the US converted to left-hand drive.

==Passenger cars==


Steering wheels for passenger automobiles are generally circular. They are mounted to the steering column by a hub connected to the outer ring of the steering wheel by one or more spokes (single spoke wheels being a relatively rare exception). Other types of vehicles may use a modified circular design, a butterfly shape, or some other shape, such as a yoke. On some Tesla models, the steering control is through a yoke rectangle shaped with rounded edges and two pistol grips. The C8 Corvette includes a square-type steering wheel with rounded corners, described as a &#x27;squircle&#x27;. The objective of the flat bottom is to ease diver egress while the flattened top enhances the line of sight when driving. General Motors applied for a US patent for a modular steering control that can be updated with components or changed in shape ranging from a traditional circle to a yoke.

In countries where cars must drive on the left side of the road, the steering wheel is typically on the right side of the car (right-hand drive or RHD); the converse applies in countries where cars drive on the right side of the road (left-hand drive or LHD).

In addition to its use in steering, the steering wheel is the usual location for a button to activate the car&#x27;s horn. Modern automobiles may have other controls, such as cruise control, audio system, and telephone controls, as well as paddle-shifters, built into the steering wheel to minimize the extent to which the driver must take their hands off the wheel.

The steering wheels were rigid and mounted on non-collapsible steering columns. This arrangement increased the risk of impaling the driver in case of a severe crash. The first collapsible steering column was invented in 1934 but was never successfully marketed. By 1956, Ford came out with a safety steering wheel that was set high above the post with spokes that would flex, but the column was still rigid. In 1968, United States regulations (FMVSS Standard No. 204) were implemented concerning the acceptable rearward movement of the steering wheel in case of a crash. Collapsible steering columns were required to meet that standard. Before this invention, the Citroën DS incorporated a curved and off-center single-spoke steering wheel designed to deflect the driver from the steering column in case of a crash.

Power steering affords the driver reduced effort to steer the car. Modern power steering has almost universally relied on a hydraulic system, although electrical systems are steadily replacing this technology. Mechanical power steering systems were introduced, such as on 1953 Studebakers. However, hydraulically assisted systems have prevailed.

While other methods of steering passenger cars have resulted from experiments, for example, the &quot;wrist-twist&quot; steering of the 1965 Mercury Park Lane concept car was controlled by two rings, none have yet been deployed as successfully as the conventional large steering wheel.

Passenger automobile regulations implemented by the U.S. Department of Transportation required the locking of steering wheel rotation (or transmission locked in &quot;park&quot;) to hinder motor vehicle theft; in most vehicles, this is accomplished when the ignition key is removed from the ignition lock. See steering lock.

===Other designs===
The driver&#x27;s seat and steering wheel are centrally located on certain high-performance sports cars, such as the McLaren F1, and most single-seat racing cars.

As drivers may continuously have their hands on the steering wheel for many hours, these are designed with ergonomics in mind. However, the most crucial concern is that the driver can effectively convey torque to the steering system, especially in vehicles without power steering or in the rare event of a loss of steering assist. A typical design for circular steering wheels is a steel or magnesium rim with a plastic or rubberized grip molded over and around it. Some drivers purchase vinyl or textile steering wheel covers to enhance grip and comfort or simply as decoration. Another device used to make steering easier is the brodie knob.

A similar device in aircraft is the yoke. Water vessels not steered from a stern-mounted tiller are directed with the ship&#x27;s wheel, which may have inspired the concept of the steering wheel. The steering wheel is better than other user interfaces and has persisted because driving requires precise feedback that is provided by a large interface.

Early Formula One cars used steering wheels taken directly from road cars. They were normally made from wood. Without interior cabin packaging constraints, they tended to be made as large a diameter as possible to reduce the effort needed to turn. As cars grew progressively lower and driver&#x27;s areas more compact throughout the 1960s and 1970s, steering wheels became smaller to fit into the interior space.

===Spokes in steering wheel===
The number of spokes in the steering wheel has continuously changed. Most early cars had four-spoke steering wheels.

A Banjo steering wheel was an option in early automobiles. They predate power steering. The wire spokes were a buffer or absorber between the driver&#x27;s hands and the vibration transmitted from the road surfaces. Most were three- or four-spokes made of four or five wires in each spoke, hence the name &quot;Banjo&quot;.

==Adjustable steering wheels==
===Tilt wheel===
Edward James Lobdell developed the original tilt wheel in the early 1900s. A 7-position tilt wheel was introduced by the Saginaw Division of General Motors in 1963 for all passenger car divisions except Chevrolet which received the tilt wheel in 1964. This tilt wheel was also supplied to the other US automakers (except Ford). Originally a luxury option on cars, the tilt function helps to adjust the steering wheel by moving the wheel through an arc in an up and down motion. Tilt Steering Wheels rely upon a ratchet joint located in the steering column just below the steering wheel. The wheel can be adjusted upward or downward by disengaging the ratchet lock while the steering column remains stationary below the joint. Some designs place the pivot slightly forward along the column, allowing for a fair amount of vertical movement of the steering wheel with slight actual tilt. In contrast, other designs place the pivot almost inside the steering wheel, allowing adjustment of the angle of the steering wheel with nearly no change in its height.

===Adjustable steering column===
An adjustable steering column allows the steering wheel height to be adjusted with only a small, useful change in tilt. Most of these systems work with compression locks or electric motors instead of ratchet mechanisms; the latter may be capable of moving to a memorized position when a given driver uses the car or automatically moving up and forward to ease egress.

===Telescope wheel===
Many pre-war British cars offered telescoping steering wheels that required loosening a locknut before adjustment, many using the Douglas ASW (Adjustable Steering Wheel). In 1949, the Jaguar XK120 introduced a new steering wheel supplied by Bluemel that was driver-adjustable by loosening a sleeve around the column by hand. The 1955-1957 Ford Thunderbird had a similar design with of total travel. In 1956, the travel was restricted to . A patent was filed regarding a telescoping steering wheel in July 1942 by Bernard Maurer of the Saginaw Steering Gear Division of General Motors (now Nexteer Automotive). Nevertheless, GM would not offer a telescoping wheel of their own until the debut of the optional telescopic wheel on the 1965 Corvette and Corvair, and the optional tilt/telescope wheel on 1965 Cadillacs. The GM column was released by twisting a locking ring surrounding the center hub and offered a range of adjustment.

===Swing-away steering wheel===
A swing-away steering column was introduced in the 1961 Ford Thunderbird and made available on other Ford products during the 1960s. The swing-away steering wheel allowed the steering wheel to move to the right when the transmission selector was in the &quot;park&quot; position to make the driver&#x27;s exit and entry easier.

===Tilt-away steering wheel===
A tilt-away wheel was introduced by Ford in 1967 after updates to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards requirements. Though it was an update to the swing-away steering wheel, which did not meet updated safety standards, it offers limited movement but added convenience due to the automatic pop-over function over its predecessor.

===Quick release hub steering wheel===
Some steering wheels can be mounted on a detachable or a quick-release hub. The steering wheel can be removed without using tools by pressing a button. The system is often found in narrow-spaced racing cars to facilitate the driver getting in and out, as well as in other cars as an anti-theft device. The quick-release connector is often brand-specific, with some makes being interchangeable. The most common mounting pattern is 6×70 mm, which denotes a bolt circle pattern with six bolts placed along a circle 70 mm in diameter. Other examples of common bolt patterns are 3×, 5×, 6×74 mm and 6×. The quick release itself is often proprietary.

==Usage==
The steering wheel should be used with strategic movements of the hand and wrist in spinning motions. Caution and care should be used to ensure the safety of the extremities. The constant motions used must be performed with caution. &quot;Proper posture of the hand-arm system while using hand tools is essential. As a rule, the wrist should not be bent, but must be kept straight to avoid overexertion of tissues like tendons and tendon sheaths and compression of nerves and blood vessels.&quot;

Turning the steering wheel while the vehicle is stationary is called dry steering. It is generally advised to avoid dry steering as it strains the steering mechanism and causes undue wear to the tires.

==Buttons and controls on the steering wheel==
The first button added to the steering wheel was a switch to activate the car&#x27;s electric horn. Traditionally located on the steering wheel hub or center pad, the horn switch was sometimes placed on the spokes or activated via a decorative horn ring, which obviated the necessity of moving a hand away from the rim. Electrical connections are made via a slip ring. A further development, the Rim Blow steering wheel, integrated the horn switch into the steering wheel rim.

In 1966, Ford offered the Highway Pilot Speed Control option with steering wheel pad-mounted rocker switches, on its Thunderbird. Uniquely, the Thunderbird also lightly applied the brakes and illuminated the stop lamps when the Retard was continuously depressed with the cruise control on, but not engaged.

In 1974, Lincoln added two rocker switches on the steering wheel to activate various cruise control functions on the Continental and Continental Mark IV. In 1988, Pontiac offered a steering wheel with 12 buttons controlling various audio functions on the Trans-Am, 6000 STE and Bonneville. 
In the 1990s, a proliferation of new buttons began to appear on automobile steering wheels. Remote or alternate adjustments could include vehicle audio, telephone, and voice control navigation. Scroll wheels or buttons are often used to set volume levels or page through menus and change radio stations or audio tracks. These controls can use universal interfaces, wired or wirelessly.

==Other uses==

==Arcade steering wheels==

Game controllers are available for arcade cabinets, personal computers, and console games that are designed to look and feel like a steering wheel and intended for use in racing games. An early example is the Telstar Arcade, which featured a wheel in 1977 for use in the Road Race game that came packaged with it. Some modern video game steering wheels employ haptic technology to simulate the feedback a real driver feels from a steering wheel, as well as buttons to allow for more inputs.

<doc id="772022" wikidata="Q1142789" url="?curid=772022" title="Miki Fujimoto">
<text>(born February 26, 1985), professionally known by her birth name of , and nicknamed Mikitty, is a Japanese actress, singer and YouTuber. After failing the audition to join girl group Morning Musume with the fourth generation members, Fujimoto debuted as a solo artist within Hello! Project in 2002 with the single &quot;Aenai Nagai Nichiyōbi&quot;. Fujimoto later joined Morning Musume in 2003 along with the sixth generation and eventually became the leader of the group in 2007.

==Early life==

Fujimoto was born and raised in the Takikawa area of Hokkaidō, Japan. She is the youngest of four children: she has an older brother (who won a defamation case alongside Fujimoto in 2009), and two older sisters. Her father died on November 10, 2010.

== Career ==
===Early work: 2002–2003===
Fujimoto originally started out as a solo singer in 2002 under the idol family Hello! Project, becoming the first of six members to debut under Hello! Project after losing a Morning Musume audition. She is often called by fans as Aya Matsuura&#x27;s rival, but in fact, they are the best of friends. After a successful performance on the music program on New Year&#x27;s Eve, &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot;, producer Tsunku added her to Morning Musume as a sixth generation member in 2003. 

Although unintended, Fujimoto began a very brass and frigid image (which Fujimoto herself attributed to her unhappiness for being added to the group long after having been built up as a solo act). At this point in her career, she was given the nickname &quot;Miki-sama&quot; &quot;(美貴様、Miki the Great)&quot; by fans and the media alike due to her new image as someone who spoke her mind with a sharp tongue, even in the face of her seniors and instructors.

She sang many of the lead lines in Morning Musume songs, especially after Natsumi Abe&#x27;s graduation. She and fellow Morning Musume member Asami Konno were also lent to Country Musume, a group that features &quot;Country Girls from Hokkaidō&quot;, such as Miki and Asami (the group has been known, however, to include members not from the rural island—such as former featured singers Rika Ishikawa and Miuna Saito).

In October 2002, she was placed in the one-shot unit, Gomattou with two other prominent pop soloists under Hello! Project, Maki Goto (a former Morning Musume member), and Aya Matsuura. She was also in Hello! Project Shuffle groups Odoru 11, 11Water, H.P. All Stars and Sexy Otonajan.

In 2003, when Morning Musume was split into two groups, she was placed in Morning Musume Otomegumi.

On June 15, 2006, it was announced that Fujimoto and Aya Matsuura would join in a new Hello! Project duo called GAM. Their debut single was released on September 13, 2006, and after two other singles, their debut LP was released on May 23, 2007.

On May 6, 2007, after the graduation of then-leader Hitomi Yoshizawa, Fujimoto took her place as the fifth leader of Morning Musume.
== Controversy ==
On May 24, 2007, Fujimoto was featured in the Japanese gossip magazine &quot;Friday&quot; pictured walking with Tomoharu Shōji, a member of the comedy duo Shinagawa Shōji. &quot;Friday&quot; explained that they had a two-hour dinner together, drove to Fujimoto&#x27;s apartment, then went to the sauna, returning to Shōji&#x27;s apartment just after midnight. It soon became apparent that she was to be involved in a scandal that would jeopardize her position in Morning Musume. Up-Front Agency&#x27;s initial response to the article was that they had no intention to deal with the situation since there was no proof of them dating. 

On the May 26, 2007 edition of &quot;Young Town Doyōbi&quot; (a radio show with Ai Takahashi, Fujimoto and Sanma Akashiya), she confirmed that the pictures were of her, and confirmed her relationship with Shōji. Fujimoto was later called by the head of Up-Front Agency, Naoki Yamazaki, about the situation. Instead of ordering her to end the relationship, the agency left the decision to Fujimoto. Since she had no desire of ending the relationship, and she did not want to further betray the staff, fellow members, and her fans, she decided the best course of action would be to immediately resign from the group. 

On June 1, 2007, Fujimoto announced her immediate resignation from Morning Musume. However, she remained with GAM (finishing their tour in progress at the time) and remained contracted with Hello! Project and Up-Front Agency. 

Fujimoto&#x27;s tenure as leader of Morning Musume of just 25 days remains a record within Hello! Project, and has become a source of notoriety within Japanese media.

== Marriage and personal life ==
In March 2009, Fujimoto announced her engagement to Shōji and graduated from Hello! Project. They married on July 3, 2009, at a ceremony held in Hawaii. The couple have three children: a son born in 2012, and two daughters born in 2015 and 2020.

== Later career ==
On April 23, 2008, Fujimoto released a collaboration kayōkyoku single, , featuring Takao Horiuchi. Later that year, Fujimoto played the part of Rizzo in the fall musical, &quot;Grease&quot;. 

In 2011, Fujimoto took part of the special revival unit Dream Morning Musume, though her concert and television appearances were limited, due to her concurrent pregnancy (with her first child).

Fujimoto had a brief stint as an owner of a chain of yakiniku restaurants in Japan: &quot;Yakiniku Mikitei (焼肉美貴亭)&quot;. The first location opened on her 26th birthday, February 26, 2011, to much success. Three more restaurants were opened. The restaurant chain, however, was short-lived, and closed on June 29, 2012, following various incidents.

In 2017, Fujimoto appeared in the film &quot;Kamen Rider Ex-Aid the Movie: True Ending&quot;.

In October 2019, Fujimoto opened her YouTube channel: &quot;Hello! Mikitty&quot;&quot;.&quot; Her husband often appears in her videos, with frequent appearances by former Hello! Project members, and her three children.

On March 12, 2023, in celebration of her 21st Debut Anniversary, Fujimoto held a 20 Complete Years Anniversary Live Concert at Huric Hall Tokyo, featuring Asami Konno and Reina Tanaka as special guests, with surprise appearances by Maki Goto and Ichiro Ito (of Every Little Thing).

<doc id="772026" wikidata="Q845698" url="?curid=772026" title="Blepharitis">
<text>Blepharitis, sometimes known as granulated eyelids, is one of the most common ocular conditions characterized by inflammation, scaling, reddening, and crusting of the eyelid. This condition may also cause swelling, burning, itching, or a grainy sensation when introducing foreign objects or substances to the eye. Although blepharitis by itself is not sight-threatening, it can lead to permanent alterations of the eyelid margin. The primary cause is bacteria and inflammation from congested meibomian oil glands at the base of each eyelash. Other conditions may give rise to blepharitis, whether they be infectious or noninfectious, including, but not limited to, bacterial infections or allergies.

Different variations of blepharitis can be classified as seborrheic, staphylococcal, mixed, posterior or meibomitis, or parasitic. In a survey of US ophthalmologists and optometrists, 37% to 47% of patients seen by those surveyed had signs of blepharitis, which can affect all ages and ethnic groups. One single-center study of 90 patients with chronic blepharitis found that the average age of patients was 50 years old. The word is .

==Signs and symptoms==
Blepharitis is characterized by chronic inflammation of the eyelid, usually at the base of the eyelashes. Symptoms include inflammation, irritation, itchiness, a burning sensation, excessive tearing, and crusting and sticking of eyelids. Additional symptoms may include visual impairment such as photophobia and blurred vision. Symptoms are generally worse in the mornings and patients may experience exacerbation and several remissions if left untreated. It is typically caused by bacterial infection or blockage of the meibomian oil glands. Diseases and conditions that may lead to blepharitis include rosacea, herpes simplex dermatitis, varicella-zoster dermatitis, molluscum contagiosum, allergic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, staphylococcal dermatitis, demodicosis and phthiriasis palpebrarum.

The parasite &quot;Demodex folliculorum&quot; (&quot;D. folliculorum&quot;) causes blepharitis when the parasite is present in excessive numbers within the dermis of the eyelids. These parasites can live for approximately 15 days. The parasites (both adult and eggs) live on the hair follicle, inhabiting the sebaceous and apocrine gland of the human lid. Direct contact allows this pathogen to spread. Factors that allow this pathogen to multiply include hypervascular tissue, poor hygienic conditions, and immune deficiency. In treating blepharitis caused by &quot;D. folliculorum&quot;, mechanical cleaning and proper hygiene are important towards decreasing the parasite&#x27;s numbers. 
===Associated symptoms===
* Watery eyes – due to excessive tearing.
* Red eyes – due to dilated blood vessels on the sclera.
* Swollen eyelids – due to inflammation.
* Crusting at the eyelid margins/base of the eyelashes/medial canthus, generally worse on waking – due to excessive bacterial buildup along the lid margins.
* Eyelid sticking – due to crusting along the eyelid margin.
* Eyelid itching – due to the irritation from inflammation and epidermis scaling of the eyelid.
* Flaking of skin on eyelids – due to tear film suppressed by clogged meibomian glands.
* Gritty/burning sensation in the eye, or foreign-body sensation – due to crusting from bacteria and clogged oil glands
* Frequent blinking – due to impaired tear film from clogged oil glands unable to keep tears from evaporating.
* Light sensitivity/photophobia
* Misdirected eyelashes that grow abnormally – due to permanent damage to the eyelid margin
* Eyelash loss – due to excessive buildup of bacteria along the base of the eyelashes.
* Infection of the eyelash follicle/sebaceous gland (hordeolum)
* Debris in the tear film, seen under magnification (improved contrast with use of fluorescein drops)

Chronic blepharitis may result in damage of varying severity and, in the worst cases, may have a negative effect on vision. This can be resolved with a proper eyeglass prescription. Long-term untreated blepharitis can lead to eyelid scarring, excess tearing, difficulty wearing contact lenses, development of a stye (an infection near the base of the eyelashes, resulting in a painful lump on the edge of the eyelid) or a chalazion (a blockage/bacteria infection in a small oil gland at the margin of the eyelid, just behind the eyelashes, leading to a red, swollen eyelid), chronic pink eye (conjunctivitis), keratitis, and corneal ulcer or irritation. The lids may become red and may have ulcerate, non-healing areas that may lead to bleeding. Blepharitis can also cause blurred vision due to a poor tear film. Tears may be frothy or bubbly, which can contribute to mild scarring along the eyelids. Symptoms and signs of blepharitis are often erroneously ascribed by the patient to &quot;recurrent conjunctivitis&quot;.

=== Subtype symptoms ===

General symptoms include a foreign body sensation, matting of the lashes, and burning. Collarette around eyelashes, a ring-like formation around the lash shaft, can be observed. Other symptoms include loss of eyelashes or broken eyelashes. The condition can sometimes lead to a chalazion or a stye. Chronic bacterial blepharitis may also lead to ectropion. Posterior blepharitis or &quot;rosacea-associated&quot; blepharitis is manifested by a broad spectrum of symptoms involving the lids including inflammation and plugging of the meibomian orifices and production of abnormal secretion upon pressure over the glands.

== Mechanism ==
The mechanism by which the bacteria causes symptoms of blepharitis is not fully understood and may include direct irritation of bacterial toxins and/or enhanced cell-mediated immunity to &quot;S. aureus&quot;.

Staphylococcal blepharitis is caused by an infection of the anterior portion of the eyelid by Staphylococcal bacteria. In a study of ocular flora, 46% to 51% of those diagnosed with staphylococcal blepharitis had cultures positive for Staphylococcus aureus in comparison to 8% of normal patients. Staphylococcal blepharitis may start in childhood and continue into adulthood. It is commonly recurrent and it requires special medical care. The prevalence of &quot;S. aureus&quot; in the conjunctival sac and on the lid margin varies among countries, likely due to differences in climate and environment. Seborrheic blepharitis is characterized by less inflammation than Staphylococcal blepharitis; however, it causes more excess oil or greasy scaling. Meibomian gland dysfunction is a result of abnormalities of the meibomian glands and altered secretion of meibum, which plays an imperative role in lagging the evaporation of tear films and smoothing of the tear film to produce an even optical surface. Posterior blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelids, secondary to dysfunction of the meibomian glands. Like anterior blepharitis, it is a bilateral chronic condition and may be associated with skin rosacea. There is growing evidence that, in some cases, it is caused by demodex mites.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis of the condition is done via a physical examination under a slit lamp. Cultures of debris are occasionally collected for bacterial or fungal testing.

=== Examination ===
In all forms of blepharitis, optometrists or ophthalmologists examine the tear film, which is the most efficient method in determining instability. The most frequently used method is to measure tear production via tear break-up time (TBUT), which calculates the duration interval between complete blinks. This serves as a primary indication of regional dryness in the pre-corneal tear film after fluorescein injections. If TBUT is shorter than 10 seconds, then this suggests instability.

Staphylococcal blepharitis is diagnosed by examining erythema and edema of the eyelid margin. Patients may exhibit alopecia areata of eyelashes and/or growth misdirection, trichiasis. Other signs may include telangiectasia on the anterior eyelid, collarettes encircling the lash base, and corneal changes. Seborrheic blepharitis is distinguished by less erythema, edema, and telangiectasia of the eyelid margins. Posterior blepharitis and Meibomian gland dysfunction are frequently associated with rosacea and can be seen during an ocular examination of the posterior eyelid margin. The Meibomian glands may appear caked with oil or visibly obstructed.

=== Procedures ===
Cultures of the eyelid margins can be a clear indicator for patients who have recurrent anterior blepharitis with severe inflammation, in addition to patients who are not responding to therapy. Measurements of tear osmolarity may be beneficial in diagnosing concurrent dry eye syndrome (DES), which may be responsible for overlapping symptoms and would allow the physician to decipher between conditions and move forward with the most beneficial protocol for the patient. Consequently, the measurement of tear osmolarity has various limitations in differentiating between aqueous deficiencies and evaporative dry eye. Microscopic evaluation of epilated eyelashes may reveal mites, which have been evident in cases of chronic blepharoconjunctivitis. A biopsy of the eyelid can also determine the exclusion of carcinoma, therapy resistance, or unifocal recurrent chalazia.

=== Related conditions ===
== Prevention ==
Blepharitis is a result of bacteria and inflammation from congested meibomian oil glands at the base of each eyelash. Routine washing of the eyelids helps subdue symptoms and prevent blepharitis. Washing each eyelid for 30 seconds, twice a day, with a single drop of hypoallergenic soap (e.g. baby shampoo) and ample water can help. The most effective treatment is over the counter lid scrubs used twice a day. Some doctors may recommend using a hypochlorous acid treatment depending on the severity.

== Treatment ==
Blepharitis is a chronic condition causing frequent exacerbation, thus requiring routine eyelid hygiene. Hygienic practices include warm compresses, eyelid massages, and eyelid scrubs. A Cochrane Systematic Review found topical antibiotics to be effective in providing symptomatic relief and clearing bacteria for individuals with anterior blepharitis. Topical steroids provided some symptomatic relief, but they were ineffective in clearing bacteria from the eyelids. Lid hygiene measures such as warm compresses and lid scrubs were found to be effective in providing symptomatic relief for participants with anterior and posterior blepharitis.

Lotilaner (Xdemvy) was approved for medical use in the United States in July 2023, for the treatment of &quot;Demodex&quot; blepharitis.

== Prognosis ==
Blepharitis is a chronic condition that has periods of exacerbation and remission. Patients should be informed that symptoms can frequently improve but are rarely eliminated. Infrequently, severe blepharitis can result in permanent alterations in the eyelid margin or vision loss from superficial keratopathy, corneal neovascularization, and ulceration. Patients with an inflammatory eyelid lesion that appears suspicious of malignancy should be referred to an appropriate specialist.

== Research ==
A study conducted in November 2017 detected a correlation between blepharitis and early-onset metabolic syndrome (MetS). To investigate the relationship between blepharitis and MetS, researchers used the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database in Taiwan. Results indicated that hyperlipidaemia and coronary artery disease were significantly correlated with the prior development of blepharitis. Therefore, blepharitis was shown to be significantly related to MetS and can serve as an early indication of the condition.

In another study, the presence of &quot;Demodex&quot; mites was shown to be a common cause of blepharitis. However, the pathogenesis of demodicosis is still unclear. In this study, researchers provided a diagnosis of the disease and proposed diagnostic criteria for &quot;Demodex&quot; blepharitis.

There is inadequate evidence to draw conclusions about the use of oral doxycycline in the treatment of blepharitis. According to very low certainty data, oral doxycycline may help with symptoms like itchiness, burning, or watery eyes, but may induce more side effects.

A review of treatments showed that the anti-mite drug ivermectin can be an effective treatment for reducing symptoms.

Eye drops or ointments containing corticosteroids are frequently used in conjunction with antibiotics and can reduce eyelid inflammation.

The supplement n-acetylcysteine may be effective for blepharitis.

<text>is a Japanese pop singer and model. She is a former member of the Japanese pop group Morning Musume. She joined in late 2003 as a sixth generation member along with Miki Fujimoto, Sayumi Michishige, and Reina Tanaka. She graduated on December 15, 2010, in Yokohama Arena along with Junjun and Linlin.

== Career==

Kamei was born in Arakawa, Tokyo. She was selected from the Morning Musume Love Audition 2002 to join Morning Musume as a member of the sixth generation. She first appeared on the single &quot;Shabondama&quot; and her first album was &quot;Ai no Dai 6 Kan&quot;.

Towards late 2004, Kamei is thought to have opened up after receiving her own segment on the Japanese variety show Hello! Morning, where she had been a regular since her debut. In the segment, known as , she, along with her co-host Yuko Nakazawa, and most often several guests promote the latest products from the Hello! Project. Her segment was removed from the show in the winter of 2005, but she still stars in the rest of the show as a regular.

In 2004, Kamei appeared in the 2004 Hello! Project shuffle units unit H.P. All Stars. She was also involved in Morning Musume Sakuragumi when Morning Musume was split into two groups.

In 2009, Kamei was put in the group Tanpopo as the fourth generation along with fellow Morning Musume member Aika Mitsui, Berryz Kobo member Yurina Kumai and Cute member Chisato Okai.

On August 8, 2010, Kamei&#x27;s graduation from Hello! Project was announced by Tsunku on his blog and at that day&#x27;s Hello! Project concert. Along with Junjun and Linlin they graduated at the end of Morning Musume&#x27;s 2010 Fall Concert. Kamei performed Haru Beautiful Everyday as her graduation song.

<doc id="772031" wikidata="Q6554389" url="?curid=772031" title="Linkless embedding">
<text>In topological graph theory, a mathematical discipline, a linkless embedding of an undirected graph is an embedding of the graph into three-dimensional Euclidean space in such a way that no two cycles of the graph are linked. A flat embedding is an embedding with the property that every cycle is the boundary of a topological disk whose interior is disjoint from the graph. A linklessly embeddable graph is a graph that has a linkless or flat embedding; these graphs form a three-dimensional analogue of the planar graphs. Complementarily, an intrinsically linked graph is a graph that does not have a linkless embedding.

Flat embeddings are automatically linkless, but not vice versa. The complete graph , the Petersen graph, and the other five graphs in the Petersen family do not have linkless embeddings. Every graph minor of a linklessly embeddable graph is again linklessly embeddable, as is every graph that can be reached from a linklessly embeddable graph by YΔ- and ΔY-transformations. The linklessly embeddable graphs have the Petersen family graphs as their forbidden minors, and include the planar graphs and apex graphs. They may be recognized, and a flat embedding may be constructed for them, in .

==Definitions==

When the circle is mapped to three-dimensional Euclidean space by an injective function (a continuous function that does not map two different points of the circle to the same point of space), its image is a closed curve.
Two disjoint closed curves that both lie on the same plane are unlinked, and more generally a pair of disjoint closed curves is said to be unlinked when there is a continuous deformation of space that moves them both onto the same plane, without either curve passing through the other or through itself. If there is no such continuous motion, the two curves are said to be linked. For example, the Hopf link is formed by two circles that each pass through the disk spanned by the other. It forms the simplest example of a pair of linked curves, but it is possible for curves to be linked in other more complicated ways. If two curves are not linked, then it is possible to find a topological disk in space, having the first curve as its boundary and disjoint from the second curve. Conversely if such a disk exists then the curves are necessarily unlinked.

The linking number of two closed curves in three-dimensional space is a topological invariant of the curves: it is a number, defined from the curves in any of several equivalent ways, that does not change if the curves are moved continuously without passing through each other. The version of the linking number used for defining linkless embeddings of graphs is found by projecting the embedding onto the plane and counting the number of crossings of the projected embedding in which the first curve passes over the second one, modulo 2. The projection must be &quot;regular&quot;, meaning that no two vertices project to the same point, no vertex projects to the interior of an edge, and at every point of the projection where the projections of two edges intersect, they cross transversally; with this restriction, any two projections lead to the same linking number.
The linking number of the unlink is zero, and therefore, if a pair of curves has nonzero linking number, the two curves must be linked. However, there are examples of curves that are linked but that have zero linking number, such as the Whitehead link.

An embedding of a graph into three-dimensional space consists of a mapping from the vertices of the graph to points in space, and from the edges of the graph to curves in space, such that each endpoint of each edge is mapped to an endpoint of the corresponding curve, and such that the curves for two different edges do not intersect except at a common endpoint of the edges.
Any finite graph has a finite (though perhaps exponential) number of distinct simple cycles, and if the graph is embedded into three-dimensional space then each of these cycles forms a simple closed curve. One may compute the linking number of each disjoint pair of curves formed in this way; if all pairs of cycles have zero linking number, the embedding is said to be linkless.

In some cases, a graph may be embedded in space in such a way that, for each cycle in the graph, one can find a disk bounded by that cycle that does not cross any other feature of the graph. In this case, the cycle must be unlinked from all the other cycles disjoint from it in the graph. The embedding is said to be flat if every cycle bounds a disk in this way. A flat embedding is necessarily linkless, but there may exist linkless embeddings that are not flat: for instance, if &quot;G&quot; is a graph formed by two disjoint cycles, and it is embedded to form the Whitehead link, then the embedding is linkless but not flat.

A graph is said to be intrinsically linked if, no matter how it is embedded, the embedding is always linked. Although linkless and flat embeddings are not the same, the graphs that have linkless embeddings are the same as the graphs that have flat embeddings.

==Examples and counterexamples==

As showed, each of the seven graphs of the Petersen family is intrinsically linked: no matter how each of these graphs is embedded in space, they have two cycles that are linked to each other. These graphs include the complete graph &quot;K&quot;6, the Petersen graph, the graph formed by removing an edge from the complete bipartite graph &quot;K&quot;4,4, and the complete tripartite graph &quot;K&quot;3,3,1.

Every planar graph has a flat and linkless embedding: simply embed the graph into a plane and embed the plane into space. If a graph is planar, this is the only way to embed it flatly and linklessly into space: every flat embedding can be continuously deformed to lie on a flat plane. And conversely, every nonplanar linkless graph has multiple linkless embeddings.
An apex graph, formed by adding a single vertex to a planar graph, also has a flat and linkless embedding: embed the planar part of the graph on a plane, place the apex above the plane, and draw the edges from the apex to its neighbors as line segments. Any closed curve within the plane bounds a disk below the plane that does not pass through any other graph feature, and any closed curve through the apex bounds a disk above the plane that does not pass through any other graph feature.

If a graph has a linkless or flat embedding, then modifying the graph by subdividing or unsubdividing its edges, adding or removing multiple edges between the same pair of points, and performing YΔ- and ΔY-transformations that replace a degree-three vertex by a triangle connecting its three neighbors or the reverse all preserve flatness and linklessness. In particular, in a cubic planar graph (one in which all vertices have exactly three neighbors, such as the cube) it is possible to make duplicates of any independent set of vertices by performing a YΔ-transformation, adding multiple copies of the resulting triangle edges, and then performing the reverse ΔY-transformations.

==Characterization and recognition==
If a graph &quot;G&quot; has a linkless or flat embedding, then every minor of &quot;G&quot; (a graph formed by contraction of edges and deletion of edges and vertices) also has a linkless or flat embedding. Deletions cannot destroy the flatness of an embedding, and a contraction can be performed by leaving one endpoint of the contracted edge in place and rerouting all the edges incident to the other endpoint along the path of the contracted edge. Therefore, by the Robertson–Seymour theorem, the linklessly embeddable graphs have a forbidden graph characterization as the graphs that do not contain any of a finite set of minors.

The set of forbidden minors for the linklessly embeddable graphs was identified by : the seven graphs of the Petersen family are all minor-minimal intrinsically linked graphs. However, Sachs was unable to prove that these were the only minimal linked graphs, and this was finally accomplished by .

The forbidden minor characterization of linkless graphs leads to a polynomial time algorithm for their recognition, but not for actually constructing an embedding. described a linear time algorithm that tests whether a graph is linklessly embeddable and, if so, constructs a flat embedding of the graph. Their algorithm finds large planar subgraphs within the given graph such that, if a linkless embedding exists, it has to respect the planar embedding of the subgraph. By repeatedly simplifying the graph whenever such a subgraph is found, they reduce the problem to one in which the remaining graph has bounded treewidth, at which point it can be solved by dynamic programming.

The problem of efficiently testing whether a given embedding is flat or linkless was posed by . It remains unsolved, and is equivalent in complexity to unknotting problem, the problem of testing whether a single curve in space is unknotted. Testing unknottedness (and therefore, also, testing linklessness of an embedding) is known to be in NP but is not known to be NP-complete.

==Related families of graphs==

=== Graphs with small Colin de Verdière invariant ===

The Colin de Verdière graph invariant is an integer defined for any graph using algebraic graph theory. The graphs with Colin de Verdière graph invariant at most μ, for any fixed constant μ, form a minor-closed family, and the first few of these are well-known: the graphs with μ ≤ 1 are the linear forests (disjoint unions of paths), the graphs with μ ≤ 2 are the outerplanar graphs, and the graphs with μ ≤ 3 are the planar graphs. As conjectured and proved, the graphs with μ ≤ 4 are exactly the linklessly embeddable graphs.

=== Apex graphs ===
The planar graphs and the apex graphs are linklessly embeddable, as are the graphs obtained by YΔ- and ΔY-transformations from these graphs. The &quot;YΔY reducible graphs&quot; are the graphs that can be reduced to a single vertex by YΔ- and ΔY-transformations, removal of isolated vertices and degree-one vertices, and compression of degree-two vertices; they are also minor-closed, and include all planar graphs. However, there exist linkless graphs that are not YΔY reducible, such as the apex graph formed by connecting an apex vertex to every degree-three vertex of a rhombic dodecahedron. There also exist linkless graphs that cannot be transformed into an apex graph by YΔ- and ΔY-transformation, removal of isolated vertices and degree-one vertices, and compression of degree-two vertices: for instance, the ten-vertex crown graph has a linkless embedding, but cannot be transformed into an apex graph in this way.

=== Knotless graphs ===
Related to the concept of linkless embedding is the concept of knotless embedding, an embedding of a graph in such a way that none of its simple cycles form a nontrivial knot. The graphs that do not have knotless embeddings (that is, they are &quot;intrinsically knotted&quot;) include &quot;K&quot;7 and &quot;K&quot;3,3,1,1. However, there also exist minimal forbidden minors for knotless embedding that are not formed (as these two graphs are) by adding one vertex to an intrinsically linked graph, but the list of these is unknown.

One may also define graph families by the presence or absence of more complex knots and links in their embeddings, or by linkless embedding in three-dimensional manifolds other than Euclidean space. define a graph embedding to be triple linked if there are three cycles no one of which can be separated from the other two; they show that &quot;K&quot;9 is not intrinsically triple linked, but &quot;K&quot;10 is. More generally, one can define an &quot;n&quot;-linked embedding for any &quot;n&quot; to be an embedding that contains an &quot;n&quot;-component link that cannot be separated by a topological sphere into two separated parts; minor-minimal graphs that are intrinsically &quot;n&quot;-linked are known for all &quot;n&quot;.

==History==
The question of whether &quot;K&quot;6 has a linkless or flat embedding was posed within the topology research community in the early 1970s by . Linkless embeddings were brought to the attention of the graph theory community by , who posed several related problems including the problem of finding a forbidden graph characterization of the graphs with linkless and flat embeddings; Sachs showed that the seven graphs of the Petersen family (including &quot;K&quot;6) do not have such embeddings. As observed, linklessly embeddable graphs are closed under graph minors, from which it follows by the Robertson–Seymour theorem that a forbidden graph characterization exists. The proof of the existence of a finite set of obstruction graphs does not lead to an explicit description of this set of forbidden minors, but it follows from Sachs&#x27; results that the seven graphs of the Petersen family belong to the set. These problems were finally settled by , who showed that the seven graphs of the Petersen family are the only minimal forbidden minors for these graphs. Therefore, linklessly embeddable graphs and flat embeddable graphs are both the same set of graphs, and are both the same as the graphs that have no Petersen family minor.

 also asked for bounds on the number of edges and the chromatic number of linkless embeddable graphs. The number of edges in an &quot;n&quot;-vertex linkless graph is at most 4&quot;n&quot; − 10: maximal apex graphs with &quot;n&quot; &gt; 4 have exactly this many edges, and proved a matching upper bound on the more general class of &quot;K&quot;6-minor-free graphs. observed that Sachs&#x27; question about the chromatic number would be resolved by a proof of Hadwiger&#x27;s conjecture that any &quot;k&quot;-chromatic graph has as a minor a &quot;k&quot;-vertex complete graph. The proof by of the case &quot;k&quot; = 6 of Hadwiger&#x27;s conjecture is sufficient to settle Sachs&#x27; question: the linkless graphs can be colored with at most five colors, as any 6-chromatic graph contains a &quot;K&quot;6 minor and is not linkless, and there exist linkless graphs such as &quot;K&quot;5 that require five colors. The snark theorem implies that every cubic linklessly embeddable graph is 3-edge-colorable.

Linkless embeddings started being studied within the algorithms research community in the late 1980s through the works of and . Algorithmically, the problem of recognizing linkless and flat embeddable graphs was settled once the forbidden minor characterization was proven: an algorithm of can be used to test in polynomial time whether a given graph contains any of the seven forbidden minors. This method does not construct linkless or flat embeddings when they exist, but an algorithm that does construct an embedding was developed by , and a more efficient linear time algorithm was found by .

A final question of on the possibility of an analogue of Fáry&#x27;s theorem for linkless graphs appears not to have been answered: when does the existence of a linkless or flat embedding with curved or piecewise linear edges imply the existence of a linkless or flat embedding in which the edges are straight line segments?

<doc id="772040" wikidata="Q3229646" url="?curid=772040" title="Leon Lloyd">
<text>Leon David Lloyd (born 22 September 1977 in Coventry) is a retired English rugby union footballer who played wing or outside centre for Leicester Tigers between 1996 and 2007, spending his final 2007/8 season at Gloucester.

== Background ==

Leon Lloyd was born in Coventry in the Midlands where he grew up and attended Coundon Court School. He played for England Schools, England Colts, England U21s, Eng 7s and the Barbarians and was a successful try scorer for the Tigers Youth XV and Development XV. Lloyd made his debut at Leicester in 1996 at the age of 17 and soon after played for England U21 before going on to gain his first two caps for England in 2000 against South Africa.

== Rugby career ==

Lloyd made his debut at Leicester Tigers in 1996, displaced ageing England international Rory Underwood from the side. That same year Lloyd was part of the squad that won the Madrid Sevens and in the following year was a substitute in the 1997 Heineken Cup Final, which Leicester lost 28–9 to Brive.

Under backs coach Joel Stransky, Lloyd was shifted inside from the wing to outside centre.

Lloyd played for England U21, England 7s, the Barbarians England Colts and England Schools and prior to making his début for the Tigers first team, was a successful try scorer for the Tigers Youth XV and Development XV before a serious car accident sidelined him for six months.

Lloyd was included as an injury replacement in England&#x27;s 1999 World Cup squad but didn&#x27;t feature in any matches. He went on to gain his first two caps the following season as a replacement against South Africa in 2000, but concern was raised about his discipline as he was seen punching a Springbok player.

He played in the England side during 2001 tour to North America, where he played in three tests and scored two tries. Unfortunately he suffered a shoulder injury that required surgery and kept him out of the Tigers squad for the start of the 2001/02 season and ultimately cost him his place in the England team.

However, he recovered well and scored two tries, including the match-winner in Tigers&#x27; 2001 Heineken Cup Final, only to be injured again when Leicester retained the trophy in May 2002. That injury also ruled him out of the England Sevens squad for the Commonwealth Games in Manchester.

Lloyd agreed a deal to leave Leicester Tigers for Guinness Premiership team Gloucester Rugby. in 2007 where he scored five tries in just six games. However, his playing career was cut short in 2008 after he suffered a career-ending knee injury during a game against the Ospreys.

== Business career ==

In 2009 Lloyd was appointed foundation director for Oakham School, a private school in the Midlands, where he used his contacts to help raise funds for the school, ensuring its continued success and financial security.

Lloyd is a Director of social enterprise Switch the Play, an organisation that supports athlete transition through and beyond sport.

His book, Life After Sport &#x27;From Boot Room to Board Room&#x27; talks about the rigours of post-sport life and Lloyd&#x27;s own transition from rugby to business.

<doc id="772042" wikidata="Q276014" url="?curid=772042" title="Delano family">
<text>In the United States, members of the Delano family include U.S. presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Ulysses S. Grant and Calvin Coolidge, astronaut Alan B. Shepard, and writer Laura Ingalls Wilder. Its progenitor is Philippe de Lannoy (1602–1681), a Pilgrim of Walloon descent, who arrived at Plymouth, Massachusetts, in the early 1620s. His descendants also include Eustachius De Lannoy (who played an important role in Indian history), Frederic Adrian Delano, Robert Redfield, and Paul Delano. Delano family forebears include the Pilgrims who chartered the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, seven of its passengers, and three signers of the Mayflower Compact.

==De Lannoy family in Europe==

Philippe de Lannoy was baptized in Leiden on December 7, 1602, of religious refugee parents Jan Lano, born Jean de Lannoy in 1575 at Tourcoing, and Marie Mahieu of Lille, Spanish Netherlands, both now in northern France. His parents were betrothed in the Leiden Walloon Church on January 13, 1596. His father died in 1604 at Leiden. Philippe&#x27;s grandfather, Guilbert de Lannoy of Tourcoing, was born Roman Catholic but apparently became an early Protestant. He left the mainland with his family for England probably in the late 1570s and then, in 1591, moved to Leiden, a safe harbor for religious dissidents. The Mahieu family arrived in Leiden around the same time, having earlier been at Armentières, near Lille. The family name de Lannoy may derive from the town of Lannoy (that results from the agglutination of the definite article &quot;le&quot; &quot;the&quot; and &quot;annoy&quot; &quot;alder plantation&quot;, Picard variant form corresponding to Modern French &quot;aulnaie&quot; &quot;alder plantation&quot;) also near Lille.

There is evidence to suggest that the Delano family are descendants of the noble House of Lannoy.

===Migration to America===
Arriving from England, Philippe de Lannoy&#x27;s ancestors affiliated with the Leiden Walloon Church, which held services in French, indicating they probably spoke French or Picard. The timing and extent of his contact with the John Robinson Pilgrim congregation in Leiden is unknown but Philippe eventually joined the voyage Robinson organized to the American continent. The Leiden Pilgrims bought the &quot;Speedwell&quot; for the voyage. Although his name is not on the passenger list, Philippe is believed by &quot;Mayflower&quot; scholar Jeremy Bangs to have joined his maternal uncle Francis Cooke (husband of his mother&#x27;s sister, Hester Mahieu) and young cousin John Cooke on the &quot;Speedwell&quot; voyage from Delfshaven to Southampton to meet the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. It is possible that Philippe went separately to England rather than aboard &quot;Speedwell&quot;. They gathered in England with other Pilgrims and hireling colonizers to stage the onward voyage with the two ships. The &quot;Speedwell&quot; proved unseaworthy and eleven of its passengers were able to join the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. It is unknown if the twenty (including Robert Cushman and Phillipe de Lannoy) who could not sail on the &quot;Mayflower&quot; returned to Leiden or remained in England. The &quot;Mayflower&quot; proceeded solo with a combined company of 103, leaving Southampton on September 6, 1620, arriving Cape Cod Harbor on November 11, 1620. The &quot;Fortune&quot; eventually substituted for the &quot;Speedwell&quot;, sailing for Plymouth Colony in early July 1621, arriving on November 9, 1621, with Philippe among its passengers.
===Life in America===
Philippe de Lannoy joined and resided with his uncle Francis Cooke and cousin John, who had arrived on the &quot;Mayflower&quot; the year before. In 1623, he received a land grant in Plymouth but sold this property in 1627 and moved to Duxborough. In 1634, at Plymouth, Massachusetts, he married Hester Dewsbury. Their children: 1. Mary Delano, b. abt 1635; 2. Philip Delano, b. abt 1637; 3. Hester or Esther Delano, b. abt 1640; 4. Thomas Delano, b. 21 March 1642; 5. John Delano, b. 1644; 6. Jonathan Delano, b. 1647–1648, prob. Duxbury, Massachusetts. Delano prospered and was part of the group that organized the construction of highways and bridges around the village. Hester died after 1648. Before 1653 he married the widowed Mary Pontus Glass, b. abt 1625, by whom he had three children: 1. Jane Delano; 2. Rebecca Delano; 3. Samuel Delano.&quot;.
He served in the Pequot War of 1637 as a volunteer. In 1652, he joined with 35 other colonists to purchase trading goods in what was then called Dartmouth Township from Massasoit, the leader of the Wampanoag, who drew the boundaries. It was sold to the Religious Society of Friends or Quakers, who wished to live outside the stringent religious laws of the Puritans. Philippe gave his portion of the acquisition, amounting to 800 acres (3.2 km2), to his son Jonathan Delano. He died on August 22, 1681, in Bridgewater, Massachusetts. A great many of his offspring would become prominent mariners, whalers, and shipbuilders. The later commercial success of some Delanos was such that they would become part of the Massachusetts aristocracy, sometimes referred to as one of the Boston Brahmins (the &quot;First Families of Boston&quot;).

==Descendants==
Philippe de Lannoy&#x27;s sixth son Jonathan (about 1648–1720) married Mercy Warren, granddaughter of &quot;Mayflower&quot; passenger Richard Warren; among their direct descendants are the author Laura Ingalls Wilder, President Ulysses S. Grant, President Calvin Coolidge, anthropologist Robert Redfield, astronaut Alan B. Shepard, journalist Hunter S. Thompson, entertainer Martina McBride and the poet Conrad Potter Aiken.

Over time, family members migrated to other states, including Pennsylvania, Utah, Georgia, Michigan, Maine, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Virginia, Vermont and as far away as Chile, where today descendants of Captain Paul Delano are numerous and prominent. From the New York clan, Sara Delano married James Roosevelt and their only child, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, became President of the United States.

;Delano family in America:
* Amasa Delano (1763–1823), master mariner, shipbuilder and author Amasa Delano was a 19th-century American sea captain and trader who is best known for his role in several maritime adventures, including an encounter with a group of shipwrecked slaves that later became the basis for a famous novella. Amasa Delano was born on February 22, 1763, in Duxbury, Massachusetts, USA. He came from a seafaring family and grew up with a strong connection to the maritime world. Delano began his maritime career as a sailor, eventually rising through the ranks to become a ship captain.He engaged in various trading voyages and was involved in the lucrative sealing industry, which involved hunting seals for their valuable fur and oil in remote regions, including the South Pacific and South America. One of the most notable events in Delano&#x27;s life occurred in 1805 when he encountered the Spanish schooner Tryal near the coast of Chile.Delano&#x27;s ship, the Perseverance, came across the Tryal, which appeared to be in distress. Delano boarded the Spanish vessel to offer assistance. What he found was a grim scene. The Tryal was a slave ship, and the slaves on board had revolted against their captors. Delano and his crew were initially unaware of this fact. Delano and some of his crew were eventually taken captive by the rebelling slaves, but they managed to escape. Delano later returned with reinforcements and subdued the revolt. This incident and Delano&#x27;s account of it became the basis for Herman Melville&#x27;s novella &quot;Benito Cereno&quot;, which was published in 1855. After his maritime adventures, Amasa Delano returned to the United States.He continued to be involved in the shipping and trading business. Amasa Delano died on May 13, 1823, in Fairhaven, Massachusetts.

===Warren Delano Jr.&#x27;s career smuggling opium into China===
Warren Delano Jr. made a large fortune trading opium in Canton (now Guangzhou), China. Delano first went to China at age 24 to work for Russell &amp; Company, which had pioneered trading with China. John Perkins Cushingalso a Russell &amp; Company partnerhad preceded Delano and initiated a close relationship with a Chinese official called Howqua. The two men had established an offshore basean anchored floating warehousewhere Russell &amp; Company ships would offload their opium contraband before continuing up the Pearl River Delta to Canton with their legal cargo.

By early 1843, Delano had spent a momentous decade in the China trade. He had achieved his financial competence and risen to become the head partner of the biggest American firm dealing with China. He had witnessed the destruction of the hated Canton system, the humiliation of the Chinese government, and the creation of New Chinas.

<doc id="772047" wikidata="Q837397" url="?curid=772047" title="Polish Cup">
<text>The Polish Cup in football ( ) is an annual knockout football competition for Polish football clubs, held continuously since 1950, and is the second most important national title in Polish football after the Ekstraklasa title. Due to mass participation of teams, the tournament is often called &quot;The Cup of the Thousand Teams&quot; ( ).

Participation is open to any club registered with the Polish FA, regardless of whether it competes in any league in the national pyramid or not. Reserve and veteran teams are also eligible, with reserve teams reaching the final on two occasions (and winning it once). The Cup is popular among lower-level teams, as it gives them a chance to play better known sides. In some cases, the underdogs have even reached the final, with the most famous example being Czarni Żagań, who were playing in the third division, when they reached the 1964–65 final, eventually won by Górnik Zabrze.

Lower league clubs have to enter regional qualification rounds and the winners of these join the teams from the first and second division in the competition proper. The regional qualifications are played in the preceding season, so that one edition of Polish Cup for lower ranked clubs can last two seasons. Each tie is decided by a single game which is held at the lower league side&#x27;s stadium. The final used to be a single match, but 2002–2006 it was contested over two legs. Since 2007, the Cup has returned to the single-game final.

The first edition of the Polish Cup took place in 1926, but it was quickly abandoned. In the late 1930s, the President of Poland&#x27;s Football Cup was organized, which featured teams of the Polish Football Association&#x27;s regional districts.

The reigning champions are Wisła Kraków, who defeated Pogoń Szczecin 1–2 after extra time in the final of the 2023–24 edition, becoming the fifth team to win the competition while playing in the second division. Raków Częstochowa hold the record for most consecutive tournament game wins (16) between 2020 and 2023, winning the cup in 2021 and 2022.

<doc id="772048" wikidata="Q3351509" url="?curid=772048" title="Ollie Smith (rugby union, born 1982)">
<text>Oliver James Smith (born 14 August 1982) is a former English rugby union international and domestic head coach, having had a spell with Esher RFC. During his playing career, he played for Harlequin F.C. Rugby Club, Montpellier Hérault Rugby, Leicester Tigers, England and the British &amp; Irish Lions before a knee injury forced him to retire. He was a specialist outside centre but also occasionally played inside centre or wing.

==Early career==
Born 14 August 1982 in Leicester, Smith was educated at John Cleveland College, Hinckley and went on to do a PE &amp; Sports Science degree at Loughborough University. He started playing junior rugby union with Old Bosworthians and then joined Market Bosworth at U14 level. As a boy he attended Tigers matches with his father and had his first season ticket at Welford Road at age seven. He joined Leicester Academy in 1999 after attending a trial. He was an unused replacement aged 17 before making his Leicester debut in September 2000 against London Irish after his 18th birthday, at the time he was the youngest player to feature in the Zurich Premiership. His age and ability led to comparisons with former Tigers&#x27; centre Paul Dodge who did make his debut aged 17 and was to be his mentor. Smith started the victorious 2002 Heineken Cup Final for Leicester.

==International career==
He played for England U18 &#x27;A&#x27; in 1999/00 and the next season became a member of the England U19 team, progressing to the U21 side during 2001/02. Smith then gained his first senior cap as a replacement against Italy in the 2003 Six Nations Championship. England went on to win the Grand Slam. However, shortly after his international debut he picked up a shoulder injury which ruled him out for the rest of that season. His next competitive game was the pre World Cup warm up match versus Wales, and then started his first game for England against France shortly afterwards. Due to lack of game time Smith was to miss out on inclusion in the 2003 Rugby World Cup.

With injuries to other centres Mike Tindall and Will Greenwood, Smith was tipped by amongst others former centre Jeremy Guscott to take his place in the 2005 Six Nations side. However, Smith was overlooked in favour of Newcastle centres of Mathew Tait and Jamie Noon. Tait, aged only 18, played poorly in his debut against Wales and was substituted by Olly Barkley who played in the remaining matches. Noon was solid, if unspectacular and retained his place. Some good performances from Smith in club games saw him come onto the bench for the games against Ireland, Italy and Scotland, gaining two more caps against Italy and Scotland.

Smith was then named to the British &amp; Irish Lions squad for the tour of New Zealand ahead of Noon and Barkley. Shortly after this announcement, his father died. He played in the warm-up test against Argentina scoring a try. This game was later granted test status by the IRB.
In 2008 there was a great disappointment for Smith because he did not get into the England squad for the mid-year tour to New Zealand.

==2006 onwards==
Following a disappointing 2005/6 season, Smith went to Brisbane, Australia to train with the Brisbane Broncos rugby league team, apparently in an effort to rediscover his form. Smith then regained a regular starting position in the Leicester team with many tries to his name in the 2006/07 season. That year Leicester won the Premiership, with Smith starting the final as Leicester defeated Gloucester.

Smith openly admitted to having talks with other clubs over a move for this season. He signed for Montpellier after playing over 180 games for the Tigers.

In March 2010, Harlequins announced that they had signed Smith from the start of the 2010/11 season. Smith said after returning to England from a stint with French club Montpellier: &quot;I am really looking forward to coming back to England and joining such a prestigious club, and one which has so much history. It boasts an exciting and young group of English players, some of whom I have been lucky enough to have played with during my time in the Saxons and the Churchill Cup. Quins is a team which is going in the right direction and I want to be a part of it.

&quot;I will be joining Quins a year before the World Cup, and I am not afraid to say that one of the reasons I have returned to England is so I can push for a position in next year’s World Cup squad, and I believe Quins, with the players and coaching structure that they have in place, will allow me to achieve that aspiration&quot;. The news comes very soon after Quins had announced that David Strettle, one of Quins&#x27; best wingers would be leaving to Saracens.

==Injury, Retirement and Transition to Coaching==

After just 11 games for Harlequins, Smith severely injured his knee during a clash against Saracens F.C. at Vicarage Road. It proved to be an injury he was unable to recover from, and he spent much of the 2011/2012 season in the position of Backs Coach for Esher RFC, who played in the RFU Championship at the time. Following their relegation, a coaching reshuffle took place and Smith was announced as Head Coach for the 2012/2013 season. However, after just one season in charge, Smith decided to stand down as head coach.

<text>The City Hall-County Building, commonly known as City Hall, is a 12-story building in Chicago, Illinois, that houses the seats of government of the City of Chicago and Cook County. The building&#x27;s west side (City Hall, 121 N. LaSalle St.) holds the offices of the mayor, city clerk, and city treasurer; some city departments; offices of alderpersons of Chicago&#x27;s 50 wards; and the Chicago City Council&#x27;s chambers. The building&#x27;s east side (County Building, 118 N. Clark St.) houses offices of the Government of Cook County, including the Cook County Board of Commissioners&#x27; chambers.

The building spans a city block bounded by Randolph Street to the north, Washington Street to the south, Clark Street to the east, and LaSalle Street to the west. It is the seventh building to serve as Chicago&#x27;s city hall, the fourth built at its location, and the third shared by the governments of Chicago and Cook County. Its location has served as the seat of the city and county governments since 1853, except for a period from 1871—when the Great Chicago Fire destroyed the building—to 1885.

The building was designed by the architectural firm Holabird &amp; Roche in the classical revival style. Its two sections were finished three years apart: the county building (east) was completed in 1908; the city hall (west) was completed in 1911. It was officially dedicated on February 27, 1911.

The &quot;fifth floor&quot; is sometimes used as a metonym for the office and power of the mayor, whose office is located on the fifth floor of the building.

==History==

=== Past Buildings (1837-1908) ===
The first Chicago City Hall in 1837 was in leased chambers in the Saloon Building on the corner of Lake and Clark Streets. The city next leased space in a building owned by Nancy Chapman, from 1842 until 1848, when Old Market Hall was constructed in LaSalle Street. The city owned market hall held city council business on its second floor, with shops below until 1853. A new combined city hall and county courthouse was then constructed in the public square made by Randolph, LaSalle, Washington, and Clark Streets (this building, which later burned, is sometimes referred to as, &quot;Old Chicago Courthouse&quot;). President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s body lay in state at the old courthouse city hall prior to his burial in Springfield in 1865. The courthouse bell was rung in 1871 to raise the alarm during the Great Chicago Fire before the hall burned to the ground.

A hastily constructed hall nicknamed the &#x27;old rookery&#x27; was built around a water tank that survived the fire at LaSalle and Adams streets—today, that site houses the Rookery Building (built 1888). In 1885, the city and county completed construction of a new combined building in the French Empire style at the present site (and the site of the old courthouse). This building was demolished and replaced in 1905 by the present and larger classical revival structure.

=== Holabird &amp; Roche Building (1908-present) ===
The city and county jointly sponsored an architectural competition that Holabird &amp; Roche won by unanimous vote. Construction of the county building (east wing) began in 1905, and by 1907 some county offices were already beginning to move in. Construction of city hall (the west wing) was delayed until 1909 because the city had to wait for the State to increase its borrowing authority. Despite the delay, the two wings were easily linked together because the builders of the first wing arranged all necessary steel structural connections on its westernmost wall (where the wings meet) in anticipation of the second wing. Four construction workers died during the demolition of the old building and construction of the new one.

The building is distinguished by its colossal, 118 feet-tall, 9 feet-wide Woodbury granite Corinthian orders - among the largest ever built. The columns are hollow and were built in 5 feet-high segments. Altogether, the outer walls and orders are clad in 180,000 cubic feet of granite weighing 30 million pounds.

The ground floor lobby is clad in solid polished Botticino marble.

The exterior cornice was removed in 1948 and on March 21, 1957, a fire destroyed the original, Italian Renaissance-style City Council Chamber, which featured murals by Frederick Clay Bartlett and oak paneling imported from England. A completely remodeled, contemporary-style chamber reopened in 1958.During a major renovation project initiated in 1967, seventy-five percent of the interior of the building from basement to roof was renovated, including new suspended ceilings, partitions, flooring, lighting, wall finishes, bathrooms and boilers. The renovation was overseen by the Office of the City Architect with Holabird &amp; Root serving as consulting architect.

The adjacent Richard J. Daley Center was constructed as an annex in the 1960s as the city and county governments outgrew the city hall-county building.

Holabird &amp; Roche (later known as Holabird &amp; Root) also designed the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. building at 720 E Wisconsin Avenue in Milwaukee. The Northwestern Mutual Life Building, which opened in 1914, bears striking similarity to Chicago City Hall, particularly its five-story colonnade and three grand entryways.

==Features==

=== Entrance Reliefs ===
The main (west) City Hall entrance features four reliefs sculpted by John Flanagan. Each of the panels represents one of four principal concerns of city government: playgrounds, schools, parks, and water supply.

The main (east) County Building entrance features four additional high reliefs: a man studying a scroll; a man holding a sailing ship and fishing net; and two near-identical reliefs depicting an older version of the county seal flanked by two young men.

===Green Roof===
In 2001, roof gardens were completed atop the west wing serving as a pilot project to assess the impact green roofs would have on the heat island effect in urban areas, rainwater runoff, and the effectiveness of differing types of green roofs and plant species for Chicago&#x27;s climate. Although the rooftop is not normally accessible to the public, it is visually accessible from 33 taller buildings in the area. The Garden consists of 20,000 plants of more than 150 species, including shrubs, vines and two trees. The green roof design team was headed by the Chicago area firm Conservation Design Forum in conjunction with noted &quot;green&quot; architect William McDonough. With an abundance of flowering plants on the rooftop, beekeepers harvest approximately of honey each year from hives installed on the rooftop. Tours of the green roof are by special arrangement only. The Chicago City Hall Green Roof won the Merit Design Award of the American Society of Landscape Architecture (ASLA) competition in 2002.

==In media==
The exterior and parts of the interior of the building were featured in the climax of the 1980 comedy film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, in which the titular characters, Jake and Elwood Blues, race to the building to beat a property tax deadline while being chased by police officers, firefighters, and the U.S. Military.

The building&#x27;s interiors of were featured in the 1993 blockbuster movie &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, where Richard Kimble (played by Harrison Ford) is chased down the stairs by U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones), until spilling into the lobby, where Kimble narrowly escapes being apprehended by Gerard and his men.

<text>The Left Democratic Front (LDF) is an alliance of left-wing political parties led by Communist Party of India (Marxist) in the Indian state of Kerala. It is the current ruling political alliance of Kerala, since 2016. It is one of the two major political alliances in Kerala, the other being Indian National Congress-led United Democratic Front, each of which has been in power alternately for the last four decades. LDF has won the elections to the State Legislature of Kerala in the years 1980, 1987, 1996, 2006, 2016 and had a historic re-election in 2021 where an incumbent government was re-elected for first time in 40 years. LDF has won 6 out of 10 elections since the formation of the alliance in 1980. The alliance consists of CPI(M), CPI and various smaller parties.

LDF has been in power in the State Legislature of Kerala under E. K. Nayanar (1980–1981, 1987–1991, 1996–2001), V. S. Achuthanandan (2006–2011), Pinarayi Vijayan (2016–current). E. K. Nayanar served as the Chief Minister of Kerala for 11 years and later became the longest serving Chief Minister of Kerala.

The alliance led by Pinarayi Vijayan returned to power in 2016 Assembly Election winning 91 out of 140 seats and further increasing its tally to 99 seats in the 2021 Assembly Election. Pinarayi Vijayan became the first Chief minister of Kerala to be re-elected after completing a full term (five years) in office after a historic election in 2021 where an incumbent government was re-elected for the first time in 40 years.
== History ==
=== Early years (1957–1979) ===

The political scenario in Kerala (1957–1980) was characterized by continually shifting alliances, party mergers and splits, factionalism within the coalitions and within political parties, and the formation of a numerous splinter groups. 1957 Kerala Legislative Assembly election was the first assembly election in the Indian state of Kerala. The Communist Party of India won the election with 60 seats. The election led to the formation of first democratically elected communist government in India. A Communist-led government under E. M. S. Namboodiripad resulted from the first elections for the new Kerala Legislative Assembly in 1957, making him the first communist leader in India to head a popularly elected government. It was the second ever Communist government to be democratically elected, after Communist success in the 1945 elections in the Republic of San Marino, a microstate in Europe. The coalition politics of Kerala began with second election held to the state legislative assembly in 1960. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) first came into power in Kerala in 1967, under Seven party front, which was an alliance of CPI(M), CPI, IUML, and four other parties. In 1970&#x27;s, the major political parties in the state were unified under two major coalitions, one of them led by Indian National Congress and Communist Party of India and the other by CPI(M).

=== Formation of LDF (1979) ===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, two main pre-poll political alliances were formed: the Left Democratic Front (LDF), led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Communist Party of India and the United Democratic Front (UDF), led by the Indian National Congress. These pre-poll political alliances of Kerala have stabilized strongly in such a manner that, with rare exceptions, most of the coalition partners stick their loyalty to the respective alliances (Left Democratic Front or United Democratic Front).

=== Left Democratic Front (1980–present) ===

LDF first came into power in 1980 election under the leadership of E. K. Nayanar sworn in as the Chief Minister of Kerala on 26 March 1980 for the first time in 1980. He formed government with the support of Congress (A) under A. K. Antony and Kerala Congress under K. M. Mani, Nayanar later became the longest serving Chief Minister of Kerala, ever since 1980 election, the power has been clearly alternating between the two alliances till the 2016. LDF has won 6 out of 10 elections since the formation of the alliance in 1980. Since 1980, none of alliances in Kerala has been re-elected till the 2016. The 1987, 1996 elections led E. K. Nayanar, and the 2006 elections led by V. S. Achuthanandan formed governments and completed their full terms but were not re-elected. In 2016, LDF won the 2016 election led by Pinarayi Vijayan and had a historic re-election in 2021 election where an incumbent government was re-elected for first time in 40 years. Pinarayi Vijayan is the first Chief minister of Kerala to be re-elected after completing a full term (five years) in office.

<doc id="772062" wikidata="Q17079481" url="?curid=772062" title="Scholarly method">
<text>The scholarly method or scholarship is the body of principles and practices used by scholars and academics to make their claims about their subjects of expertise as valid and trustworthy as possible, and to make them known to the scholarly public. It comprises the methods that systemically advance the teaching, research, and of a scholarly or academic field of study through rigorous inquiry. Scholarship is creative, can be documented, can be replicated or elaborated, and can be and is peer reviewed through various methods. The scholarly method includes the subcategories of the scientific method, with which scientists bolster their claims, and the historical method, with which historians verify their claims.

==Methods==
The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians research primary sources and other evidence, and then write history. The question of the nature, and indeed the possibility, of sound historical method is raised in the philosophy of history, as a question of epistemology. History guidelines commonly used by historians in their work require external criticism, internal criticism, and synthesis.

The empirical method is generally taken to mean the collection of data on which to base a hypothesis or derive a conclusion in science. It is part of the scientific method, but is often mistakenly assumed to be synonymous with other methods. The empirical method is not sharply defined and is often contrasted with the precision of experiments, where data emerges from the systematic manipulation of variables. The experimental method investigates causal relationships among variables. An experiment is a cornerstone of the empirical approach to acquiring data about the world and is used in both natural sciences and social sciences. An experiment can be used to help solve practical problems and to support or negate theoretical assumptions.

The scientific method refers to a body of techniques for investigating phenomena, acquiring new knowledge, or correcting and integrating previous knowledge. To be termed scientific, a method of inquiry must be based on gathering observable, empirical and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning. A scientific method consists of the collection of data through observation and experimentation, and the formulation and testing of hypotheses.

<text>Beaumont and Fletcher were the English dramatists Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher, who collaborated in their writing during the reign of James I (1603–25).

They became known as a team early in their association, so much so that their joined names were applied to the total canon of Fletcher, including his solo works and the plays he composed with various other collaborators including Philip Massinger and Nathan Field.
The first Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1647 contained 35 plays; 53 plays were included in the second folio in 1679. Other works bring the total plays in the canon to about 55. While scholars and critics will probably never render a unanimous verdict on the authorship of all these plays—especially given the difficulties of some of the individual cases—contemporary scholarship has arrived at a corpus of about 12 to 15 plays that are the work of both men. (See the individual pages on Beaumont and Fletcher for more details.)

==Works==

The plays generally recognised as Beaumont/Fletcher collaborations:

*&quot;The Woman Hater,&quot; comedy (1606; printed 1607)
*&quot;Cupid&#x27;s Revenge,&quot; tragedy (c. 1607–12; printed 1615)
*&quot;Philaster, or Love Lies a-Bleeding,&quot; tragicomedy (c. 1609; printed 1629)
*&quot;The Maid&#x27;s Tragedy,&quot; tragedy (c. 1609; printed 1619)
*&quot;A King and No King,&quot; tragicomedy (1611; printed 1619)
*&quot;The Captain,&quot; comedy (c. 1609–12; printed 1647)
*&quot;The Scornful Lady,&quot; comedy (c. 1613; printed 1616)
*&quot;Love&#x27;s Pilgrimage,&quot; tragicomedy (c. 1615–16; 1647)
*&quot;The Noble Gentleman,&quot; comedy (licensed 3 February 1626; printed 1647).

Beaumont/Fletcher plays, later revised by Massinger:

*&quot;Thierry and Theodoret,&quot; tragedy (c. 1607?; printed 1621)
*&quot;The Coxcomb,&quot; comedy (1608–10; printed 1647)
*&quot;Beggars&#x27; Bush,&quot; comedy (c. 1612–13?; revised 1622?; printed 1647)
*&quot;Love&#x27;s Cure,&quot; comedy (c. 1612–13?; revised 1625?; printed 1647).

Due to Fletcher&#x27;s distinctive pattern of contractional forms and linguistic preferences (&quot;&#x27;em&quot; for &quot;them&quot;, &quot;ye&quot; for &quot;you&quot;, etc.), his hand can be fairly readily distinguished from Beaumont&#x27;s in their collaborative works. In &quot;A King and No King&quot;, Beaumont wrote Acts I, II, and III in their entirety, plus scene IV, iv and V, ii and iv, while Fletcher wrote only the first three scenes in Act IV (IV, i-iii) and the first and third scenes of Act V (V, i and iii). The play is more Beaumont&#x27;s than it is Fletcher&#x27;s. Beaumont also dominates in &quot;The Maid&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;, &quot;The Noble Gentleman,&quot; &quot;Philaster&quot;, and &quot;The Woman Hater&quot;. In contrast, &quot;The Captain&quot;, &quot;The Coxcomb&quot;, &quot;Cupid&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, &quot;Beggars&#x27; Bush&quot;, and &quot;The Scornful Lady&quot; contain more of Fletcher&#x27;s work than Beaumont&#x27;s. The cases of &quot;Thierry and Theodoret&quot; and &quot;Love&#x27;s Cure&quot; are somewhat confused by Massinger&#x27;s revision; but in these plays too, Fletcher appears the dominant partner.

Critics and scholars debate other plays. Fletcher clearly wrote the last two quarters of &quot;Four Plays in One&quot;, another play in his canon—and he clearly didn&#x27;t write the first two sections. Many scholars attribute the play&#x27;s first half to Nathan Field—though some prefer Beaumont. Given the limits of the existing evidence, some of these questions may be unresolvable with currently available techniques.

<text>Paulista Avenue (Avenida Paulista in Portuguese, &quot;Paulista&quot; being the demonym for those born in the state of São Paulo) is one of the most important avenues in São Paulo, Brazil. It stretches and runs northwest to southeast. Its northwest point is Praça Marechal Cordeiro de Farias (pt) at its intersection with Rua da Consolação and its southeast point is Praça Oswaldo Cruz (pt) at its intersection with Treze de Maio, Bernardino de Campos, Desembargador Eliseu Guilherme, and Dr. Rafael de Barros avenues. Major crossroads on the street are Rua Augusta, Rua Haddock Lobo (pt) and Avenida Brigadeiro Luis Antonio (pt). Parallel to it are Cincinato Braga, Joaquim Eugenio de Lima on the Bela Vista/Paraíso side and Alameda Santos and Coronel Oscar Freire on the Jardins side. Paulista Avenue crosses sections of the neighborhoods of Paraíso, Bela Vista (pt), Jardim Paulista, Cerqueira César (pt) and Jardim América (pt), ending in Higienópolis.

The headquarters of many financial and cultural institutions are located on Paulista Avenue. As a symbol of the center of economic and political power of São Paulo, it has been the focal point of numerous political protests beginning in 1929 and continuing into the 21st century. It is also home to an extensive shopping area and to South America&#x27;s most comprehensive fine-art museum, the São Paulo Museum of Art. Being one of the highest points in São Paulo, it is clustered with radio and television masts, most notably that of TV Gazeta. Paulista Avenue is a major hub of the subway and bus lines of the city.

==Overview==
===Construction===
Paulista Avenue was constructed in 1891 by Joaquim Eugênio de Lima (1845-1902), a Uruguayan-Brazilian civil engineer. Once a residential neighbourhood thoroughfare flanked by lavishly ornate mansions with Arabesque and European themes of the city&#x27;s coffee barons and industry entrepreneurs such as the Matarazzo family. Paulista Avenue Number One belonged to the Von Bülow family, founders and operators of the Antarctica brewery. It became the first paved street in São Paulo in 1909. Asphalt was imported from Germany to complete the project.

A master plan for the avenue titled &quot;Plano de Avenida&quot; (English: Avenue Plan) was devised by Mayor Francisco Prestes Maia in 1930 during the regime of President Getúlio Vargas. It was based on David Burnham&#x27;s master plan for Chicago, and attempted to control urban growth of São Paulo. The plan promoted the decentralization of urban areas, development of automobile routes, and construction low-cost and high-density housing. The first multi-story building on the avenue was a seven-story structure at the corner of Paulista and Frei Caneca constructed in 1939. The most important of the ones which still stand to this day is Casa das Rosas, near Praça Osvaldo Cruz in the very beginning of the long avenue. It was turned into a cultural center in the late 1980s. The house has oil/hydraulic heat radiators, a luxury only the millionaire could afford.

===Modernization===

Paulista Avenue underwent a massive renovation and verticalization effort beginning in the 1950s, a trend that followed president Juscelino Kubitschek&#x27;s vision of rapid economic expansion of Brazil. Developers pressured legislators to allow for the removal of Neoclassical, Hindu-style and Middle Eastern structures along the street. These and other buildings were torn down overnight to avoid popular resistance. The avenue became home to financial institutions and it became a symbol of the economic power of the State of São Paulo. The concentration of commerce on Paulista Avenue in the 1950s attracted a new population of middle class residents in the area, both at the expense of the city&#x27;s historic downtown area. The change in economic, social, and cultural status of São Paulo, as exemplified by Paulista Avenue, attracted migration from poorer areas of Brazil and the subsequent appearance of favelas at the perimeter of the city.

Paulista Avenue again underwent significant structural renovation in 1972. The &quot;Novo Paulista&quot; (English: New Paulista) master plan of Mayor José Vicente Faria Lima significantly increased the vehicle capacity from 20,000 vehicles per day to more than 100,000 at present. All trees along the avenue, numbering 182 on the right and 140 on the left, were declared eyesores and the trees were removed to accommodate the increase in transportation routes. Current trees on the avenue, which are in number 390, are the result of replanting between 2007 and 2008.

==Transportation==

It is estimated that more than 800,000 commuters transit Avenida Paulista daily. The avenue is served by the city&#x27;s subway system, with the Line 2 (Green Line) of the &quot;Metrô&quot; (São Paulo&#x27;s Metro system) running underneath the avenue from one end to the other. This line connects the East and West sides of the metropolis having transfers to the Line 1 (Blue Line), the Line 4 (Yellow Line), the Subway Line 5 (Lilac Line) to the south side, the train Line 10 (Turquoise Line) and the monorail line 15 (Silver Line).

==Points of interest==

Paulista is home to a small native forest park, the Parque Siqueira Campos (English: Siqueira Campos Park), commonly called &quot;Trianon&quot;, and to the São Paulo Museum of Art (MASP - Museu de Arte de São Paulo). MASP is known not only for its excellent collection of European and national paintings, sketches, and sculptures by Renoir, Picasso and Modernist Brazilian authors, but also for the modern architecture of its building, whose exhibition room is made of a single block of concrete and glass windows suspended and supported by two vertical concrete columns so the view of 9 de Julho Avenue and the Cantareira mountain range north of here is not spoiled. The empty space or vault covered by cobblestones is used by the Feira de Antiguidade—Antique fair—every Sunday, open movie projections and other cultural and public events. Dedicated in 1968 by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, MASP is, due to conformity, a city landmark.

The São Paulo Gay Pride Parade in May/June, the largest in the world, and the Saint Silvester Road Race on New Year&#x27;s Eve take place on this avenue annually. Celebrations of local soccer teams, World Cup championships and political demonstrations also have Paulista as a stage.

The avenue is also renowned for excellent private schools such as Maria Imaculada school for girls; the Anglican Saint Paul&#x27;s school; Dante Alighieri private school, Alumni English Language Institute, São Luis University and School, Casa di Cultura Italiana, and Objetivo Preparatory School. The Rodrigues Alves public school, in front of Hospital Santa Catarina, is housed in a yellow neo-classic building.

Numerous cultural centers line Paulista Avenue. The Centro Cultural Itaú near Casa das Rosas in Paraiso, is an exhibition space; Centro Cultural FIESP/CIESP is an exhibition space of arts and crafts. Centro Cultural FIESP/CIESP also houses the Teatro Brasileiro de Comedia, which distributes free tickets for its weekly performances. Some of the São Paulo&#x27;s best hospitals are located in the Paulista Avenue area; they include Hospital Alemão Osvaldo Cruz, Paulistano, Clínicas, Emilio Ribas and Beneficência Portuguesa. Large-scale shopping malls on the street, some of which are now designated historic buildings, include Center Três, Conjunto Nacional, Grande Avenida, Gazeta, Top Center and Shopping Pátio Paulista. They are noted for their coffee shops, internet facilities, restaurants, luncheonettes, shops, and movie theaters. Some of the remaining historic mansions and banks are decorated during the Christmas season, and draw crowds for picture taking.

<text>A disco ball (also known as a mirror ball or glitter ball) is a roughly spherical object that reflects light directed at it in many directions, producing a complex display. Its surface consists of hundreds or thousands of facets, nearly all of approximately the same shape and size, and each has a mirrored surface. Usually, it is mounted well above the heads of the people present, suspended from a device that causes it to rotate steadily on a vertical axis, and illuminated by spotlights, so that stationary viewers experience beams of light flashing over them, and see myriad spots of light spinning around the walls of the room.

Miniature glitter balls are sold as novelties and used for several decorative purposes, including dangling from the rear-view mirror of an automobile or Christmas tree ornaments. Glitter balls may have inspired a homemade version of the sparkleball, the American outsider craft of building decorative light balls out of Christmas lights and plastic cups.

==History==
What are now usually called &quot;disco balls&quot; were first widely used in nightclubs in the 1920s. They were patented in 1917. An early example can be seen in the nightclub sequence of &quot;&quot;, a German silent film from 1927. From the 1960s to the 1980s, these devices were a standard piece of equipment in discothèques, and by the turn of the millennium, the name &quot;disco ball&quot; had grown quite popular. 

A Louisville, Kentucky company known as Omega Mirror Products claims to have made 90% of the disco balls used in the United States during the disco craze and remains a supplier.

==Popular culture==
The 1942 movie &quot;Casablanca&quot; featured a disco ball in a flashback sequence.

The 1967 movie &quot;To Sir, with Love&quot; featured a disco ball in the dance scene.

The English rock band Yes used a variant of the disco ball in their 1972 &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; tour. This was a slowly spinning vertical mirror disk mounted atop a tall ladder, with a single spotlight aimed at it, used for the opening and closing birds/waterfall-sounds sequences of the title song Close to the Edge.

The Grateful Dead featured a disco ball in the band&#x27;s 1977 concert documentary &quot;The Grateful Dead Movie&quot;. The film includes several sequences where glittery reflections from a disco ball fill San Francisco&#x27;s Winterland Ballroom during a series of 1974 performances. &quot;A twirling mirror ball overhead also adds some visual flash to the image,&quot; notes a reviewer.

U2 also featured a lemon-shaped disco ball on their 1997 - 1998 PopMart Tour. The band entered the lemon disco ball at the end of the main set and emerged from the lemon disco ball at the start of their encore. The band also released promotional disco balls to promote the band&#x27;s album &quot;Pop&quot;, the single &quot;Discothèque&quot;, and lead singer Bono also sported the alter-ego of &quot;Mirror Ball Man&quot; during their 1992 tour Zoo TV Tour.

Introducing disco balls to a new concert demographic, the pop-punk band Paramore showcased dozens of spinning disco balls in 2014 as a glittering stage backdrop during the band&#x27;s 37-city US Monumentour. The same disco ball backdrop was used that year at the UK Reading and Leeds Festivals, where the band co-headlined.
The UK television series &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; and its US counterpart &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; award competition winners a &quot;Glitter Ball Trophy&quot;.

==Records==
English rock band Pink Floyd used a glitter ball on their A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour of 1987 and The Division Bell Tour of 1994. The glitter ball used on the former was somewhat larger than normal but nowhere near as large as the glitter ball used on the 1994 tour. This particular glitter ball is one of the largest in the world: 4.90 metres in diameter, it rises to a height of 213 metres before opening to a width of 7.3 metres, revealing a 12 kilowatt Phoebus HMI lamp. Both can be seen on the video of each tour, &quot;Delicate Sound of Thunder&quot; and &quot;Pulse&quot;, during the song &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;.

American singer-songwriter Madonna has used glitter balls in several of her tours. During The Girlie Show in 1993, she descended while sitting on one before performing &quot;Express Yourself&quot;, and later in 2006, she used a 2-ton glitter ball that was embellished by 2 million dollars worth of Swarovski crystals, which used a hydraulic system to open like flower petals for her entrance during her Confessions Tour.

Despite claims that the world&#x27;s largest disco ball can be found on the promenade in Blackpool, United Kingdom, it is smaller than the Guinness World Record holder. The ball was made for the 2014 Bestival event in England and is in diameter.

<doc id="772089" wikidata="Q2636296" url="?curid=772089" title="Alabaster Caverns State Park">
<text>Alabaster Caverns State Park is a state park approximately south of Freedom, Oklahoma, United States near Oklahoma State Highway 50. The park attracted 24,706 visitors in FY 2016, The lowest count of the three parks in its part of Oklahoma. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot;, the park previously attracted about 40,000 visitors per year. It is home to the largest natural gypsum cave in the world that is open to the public. The gypsum is mostly in the form of alabaster. There are several types of alabaster found at the site, including pink, white, and the rare black alabaster. This black alabaster can be found in only three veins in the world, one each in Oklahoma, Italy and China. Another form of gypsum can be found in the many selenite crystal formations.

The state is currently considering closing Alabaster Caverns State Park for budgetary reasons.

==History==
Over 200 million years ago, during the Permian Age, this part of North America was covered by an inland sea. The water eventually evaporated, leaving behind huge deposits of alabaster and other minerals. Upheavals of the earth raised the gypsum bed close to the surface. Over time, water streams tunneled caverns through the formation, which contains an abundant quality of selenite crystals, white and pink gypsum as well as deposits of rare black alabaster.

There is no official record of discovery for Alabaster Caverns, even though they were known to have been used as hideouts by outlaws in the 19th century. The first documented exploration of the caves occurred in 1898, shortly after Hugh Litton homesteaded the area in 1893. Several individuals leased land around them during the 1920s and 30s, and allowed limited tours of the caverns, which they called &quot;bat caves.&quot; In 1939, an Englishman named Charles Grass bought the land. began renovating the caves, and opened them for public tours. It was Grass who gave them their current name. Grass was in failing health in 1952 when a group of five businessmen from Freedom, Oklahoma, the nearest community, and members of the Waynoka Railroad Labor League began lobbying for the U.S. state of Oklahoma to buy Grass&#x27; land. The state purchased from Grass on September 1, 1953, for $34,000, then reclassified the purchase as a state park in 1956, under the jurisdiction of the Oklahoma Planning and Resources Board.

In the mid-1950s the caves served as a nuclear fallout shelter with a capacity of approximately 3000 people.

==Geology==
Alabaster Caverns State Park is underlain by Permian age sedimentary rocks (~300 to 250 million years old). The main cavern extends into the formation, is about wide and high. The cavern branches into boulder formations and smaller caves. A small perennial stream now flows through the cavern, fed by various lateral tunnels and seepage from the roof. In the geologic past, the river was once capable of completely filling the cavern, as the cave walls and gypsum formations show evidence of sculpting by rapidly flowing water. The air temperature ranges from 52˚F to 58˚ year round in the cavern. In October 2018, high rainfall led to a cave in of 2200 tons of rock, which blocked the entrance of the cavern and viewing of the black gypsum vein. Tours are now return trips from the original exit. The estimated cost of restoring the blocked section is $6.5M (2023).

==Wildlife==
The cavern is home to five different species of bat. Some are solitary while others are colonial. The cavern provides roosting sites that serve as daytime shelter and a place for the non-migrating bats to hibernate during the winter months. Mexican free-tailed bats migrate to Alabaster Caverns from Mexico in the spring to bear their young. They then return to Mexico in the fall. During the winter months large colonies of bats are visible throughout the cave, although they are rarely seen during summer months.

The bat species found in the cave are the cave myotis, Western big-eared bat, eastern pipistrelle, Western big brown bat, and the Mexican free-tailed bat.

Alabaster Caverns State Park personnel made a count of the bats in the caverns in January 2024 and reported over 12,000. In 2016, the count reported about 16,000. The cave system is surveyed yearly for white nose syndrome, and as of 2024 none has been detected.

==Visitor activities==

Beside guided cave tours, wild caving, camping, hiking trails, and recreational facilities such as horseshoe pits and volleyball courts are available to visitors.

Tours are conducted every hour on the hour and last about 45 minutes, and are limited to 40 persons each. The caves are lighted and have plenty of handrails. However, the walking tour is about long and visitors must climb up or down about 330 stairsteps. This tour is not recommended for people with mobility or respiratory problems, heart conditions or claustrophobia.

==Filming==

The cave was used as a filming location for the 2019 movie &quot;The Bygone.&quot; The 2023 film, &quot;The Quest for Tom Sawyer&#x27;s Gold&quot; was also partially filmed in the caves.

==Proposed park closure in 2018==
In March 2017, the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation published a list of 16 state parks that may be closed to help offset a reduction in its budget for 2018. Alabaster Canyon State Park is on this list. This list represents approximately one-half of the parks remaining after the department closed seven parks in 2011.

Founded in 1906, it was the oldest sports car racing event, part of the World Sportscar Championship between 1955 and 1973. While the first races consisted of a whole tour of the island, the track length in the race&#x27;s last decades was limited to the of the Circuito Piccolo delle Madonie, which was lapped 11 times.

After 1973, it was a national sports car event until it was discontinued in 1977 due to safety concerns. It has since been run as Targa Florio Rally, a rallying event, and is part of the Italian Rally Championship.

== History ==

The race was created in 1906 by the wealthy pioneer race driver and automobile enthusiast, Vincenzo Florio, who had started the Coppa Florio race in Brescia, Lombardy in 1900. The Targa also claimed to be a world event not to be missed. Renowned artists, such as Alexandre Charpentier and Leonardo Bistolfi, were commissioned to design medals. A magazine was initiated, &quot;Rapiditas&quot;, which aimed to enhance, with graphic and photographic reproductions of the race, the myth of the car and the typical character of modern life, speed.

One of the toughest competitions in Europe, the first Targa Florio covered 3 laps of a 92 mile (148 km) circuit, totaling , traversing through winding bends and multiple hairpin curves on treacherous mountain roads, with around 2,000 corners per lap and over of elevation change, at heights where severe changes in climate frequently occurred. Alessandro Cagno won the inaugural 1906 race in nine hours, averaging 30 miles per hour (50 km/h).

By the early to mid-1920s, the Targa Florio course had been shortened to 67 miles (108 km) and had become one of Europe&#x27;s most important races, as neither the 24 Hours of Le Mans nor the Mille Miglia had been established yet. Grand Prix races were still isolated events, not a series like today&#x27;s F1.

The wins of Mercedes (not yet merged with Benz) in the 1920s made a big impression in Germany, especially that of German Christian Werner in 1924, as he was the first non-Italian winner since 1920. Rudolf Caracciola repeated a similar upset win at the Mille Miglia a couple of years later. In 1926, Eliska Junkova, one of the great female drivers in Grand Prix motor racing history, became the first woman to ever compete in the race. The 1931 race saw a one-off return to the &quot;Grande&quot; course after roads and bridges specifically unique to the &quot;Medio&quot; course near Polizzi Generosa had been destroyed by landslides during severe rainstorms; the 1932 course saw the first use of the &quot;Piccolo&quot; course after a road connecting Caltavuturo and Collesano was constructed on the direct orders of Benito Mussolini himself by request of Florio.

In 1953, the FIA World Sportscar Championship was introduced. The Targa became part of it in 1955. Mercedes had to win 1-2 with the Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR in order to beat Ferrari for the title. They had missed the first two of the 6 events, Buenos Aires and the 12 Hours of Sebring, where Ferrari, Jaguar, Maserati and Porsche scored points. Mercedes appeared at and won in the Mille Miglia, then pulled out of Le Mans as a sign of respect for the victims of the 1955 Le Mans disaster, but won the Tourist Trophy at Dundrod. Despite a number of incidents, the Stirling Moss/Peter Collins and Juan Manuel Fangio/Karl Kling cars finished minutes ahead of the best Ferrari and secured the title. In 1958 the race again became a round in the Championship replacing the discontinued Mille Miglia as the Italian round of the Championship.

===Course variants===

Several versions of the track were used. It started with a single lap of a circuit from 1906-1911 and 1931. From 1912 to 1914 a tour around the perimeter of Sicily was used, with a single lap of , lengthened to from 1948 to 1950. The 146 km &quot;Grande&quot; circuit was then shortened twice, the first time to , the version used from 1919-1930, and then to the circuit used from 1932 to 1936 and 1951 to 1977. From 1951-1958, the long coastal island tour variant was used for a separate event called the Giro di Sicilia (&quot;Lap of Sicily&quot;).

The start and finish took place at Cerda. The counter-clockwise lap lead from Caltavuturo and Collesano from an altitude over down to sea level, where the cars raced from Campofelice di Roccella on the Buonfornello straight along the coast, a straight that was even longer than the Mulsanne Straight at the Circuit de la Sarthe in Le Mans. The longest version of the circuit went south through Caltavuturo (whereas the shortest version of the open-road circuit went east just before entry into Caltavuturo, through a mountainous section directly to Collesano) through an extended route through elevation changes, and climbed uphill through the nearby towns of Castellana, Sottana, Madonnuzza and Miranti, twisting around mountains up to the highest point- at Geraci Siculo, dropping down into Castelbuono, twisting around more mountains and passing through Isnello and the village of Mongerrati and then rejoined the most recent version of the track at Collesano. The second version of the track also went south through Caltavuturo and took a shortcut starting right before Castellana to Collesano via the town of Polizzi Generosa. There was a closed circuit called Favorita Park in the Sicilian capital of Palermo used from 1937-1940. All the roads used for all the variations of the circuits are still in use and can be driven on today. Originally a narrow 2-lane country road, the Buonfornello straight became a lot wider in the late 1960&#x27;s thanks to the development of the Autostrade motorways all over Italy.

The challenge of the Targa was unprecedented in its difficulty and the driving experience of any of the course variants was unlike any other circuit in the world other than perhaps that of the Nurburgring in Germany and (for motorcycles) and the much faster but similar Snaefell Mountain Course on the Isle of Man. All of the variants had 18 to 23 corners per mile (11 to 14 corners per kilometer)- the original &quot;Grande&quot; circuit had in the realm of 2,000 corners per lap, the &quot;Medio&quot; had about 1,300-1,400 corners per lap and the final iteration of the course, the &quot;Piccolo&quot; circuit had about 800-900 corners per lap. To put that into perspective, most purpose-built circuits have between 12 and 18 corners, and the longest purpose-built circuit in the world, the 13-mile Nurburgring, has about 180 corners. So learning any of the Targa Florio courses was extremely difficult and required, like most long circuits, at least 60 laps to learn the course- and unlike the purpose-built Nurburgring, the course had to be learned properly in public traffic, and one lap of even the &quot;Piccolo&quot; course would take about an hour to do in a road car- if there was little to no traffic. To even finish this punishing race required a very reliable car- and it being a slow, twisty circuit it was very hard on the gearbox, brakes and the suspension of a car. Some manufacturers and entrants, particularly non-Italian ones would sometimes outright skip the Targa because of the difficulty of learning the layout and were unsure if their cars could stand the brutal pace there.

===Lap speeds===
Like a rally event (and events like the Isle of Man TT and the Mille Miglia), the race cars were started one by one every 15 seconds for a time trial, as a start from a full grid was not possible on the tight and twisty roads.

Although the public road circuit used for the Targa was extremely challenging- it was a very different kind of circuit and race from any other race on the sportscar calendar. All of the circuit variations of the Targa had so many corners that lap speeds at the Targa never went higher than 80 mph (128 km/h), as opposed to Le Mans in France, where cars would average 150+ mph (240+ km/h) or the Nürburgring, where cars would average 110 mph (176 km/h). Helmut Marko set the lap record in 1972 in an Alfa Romeo 33TT3 at 33 min 41 s at an average of during an epic charge where he made up 2 minutes on Arturo Merzario and his Ferrari 312PB. The fastest ever was Leo Kinnunen in 1970, lapping in the Porsche 908/3 at or 33 min 36 seconds flat.

Due to the track&#x27;s length, drivers practised in the week before the race in public traffic, often with their race cars fitted with license plates. Porsche factory drivers even had to watch onboard videos, a sickening experience for some. The lap record for the 146 km &quot;Grande&quot; circuit was 2 hours 3 min 54.8 seconds set by Achille Varzi in a Bugatti Type 51 at the 1931 race at an average speed of . The lap record for the 108 km &quot;Medio&quot; circuit was 1 hour 21 min 21.6 seconds set by Varzi in an Alfa Romeo P2 at an average speed of at the 1930 race. The fastest completion around the short version of the island tour was done by Giovanni &quot;Ernesto&quot; Ceirano in a SCAT at the 1914 race, completed in 16 hours, 51 minutes and 31.6 seconds from May 24–25, 1914. The fastest completion of the long version of the island tour was by Mario and Franco Bornigia in an Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 Competizione, completed in 12 hours, 26 minutes and 33 seconds flat at the 1950 race at an average speed of .

=== 1970s, safety and demise ===

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, race cars with up to 600 hp (450 kW) such as Nino Vaccarella&#x27;s Ferrari 512S raced through small mountain villages while spectators sat or stood right next to, or even on, the road. Porsche, on the other hand, did not race its big and powerful 917K, but rather the smaller and nimbler 908/3 Spyders.

Due to safety concerns, especially by Helmut Marko, who called the race &quot;totally insane&quot;, the last Targa Florio run as an FIA World Sportscar Championship race was in 1973. During the 1973 event, there were an unusually high number of accidents, two of which were fatal; one which privateer Charles Blyth crashed his Lancia Fulvia HF into a trailer at the end of the Buonfornello straight and was killed; and another where an Italian driver crashed his Alpine-Renault into a group of spectators, killing one. There were several other accidents during practice in which a total of seven spectators sustained injuries. The event was won by a Porsche 911 Carrera RSR as the prototypes such as Jacky Ickx&#x27;s Ferrari suffered crashes or other troubles. 

The Targa&#x27;s international demise was compounded by widespread concern about the organizers&#x27; inability to properly maintain the race on such a massive circuit. There were not enough marshals, most spectators sat too close to the roads, and also the international automotive governing body, the FIA, mandated safety walls on all circuits that hold FIA-mandated events from 1974 onwards. The length of combined public roads made this impracticable, especially from a financial standpoint. The sport&#x27;s growing professionalism was something the Targa&#x27;s organizers simply could not keep up with. One example of this concern was when Briton Brian Redman crashed his Porsche 908/03 during the 1971 event 20 miles into the first lap. The steering on his car broke, and it hit a stone wall and caught fire. Redman had second-degree burns all over his body and it took 45 minutes for any medical help to reach Redman (while he was attended to by spectators who were trying to keep him cool by waving objects). The Porsche team did not know where he was for 12 hours until teammates Pedro Rodriguez and Richard Attwood found him in a local clinic in Cefalu. Also during this race Alain de Cadenet in a Lola was going down the Buonfornello straight and a piece of bodywork flew off a car in front of him and hit him on the head. He was knocked out cold and the Lola went off the road and crashed into a nearby wall, and caught fire. de Cadenet&#x27;s life was saved not by marshals, but by an active Italian military serviceman watching the race from a location close to de Cadenet&#x27;s crash, and he pulled him out of the wreck. de Cadenet was taken to the same clinic in Cefalu where Redman was, where he was badly burned and had lost the use of his left eye.

The Targa was continued as a national event for some years, before a crash in 1977 where hillclimbing specialist Gabriele Ciuti went off the road and crashed at the fast curves at the end of the Buonfornello straight after some of the bodywork flew off his BMW-powered Osella prototype. This accident killed 2 spectators and seriously injured 5 others (including Ciuti, who went into a coma, but survived), and effectively sealed the race&#x27;s fate. After this accident the race was forcibly taken over by local police and was stopped on the 4th lap, and it also saw 2 other drivers having serious accidents; one of them was critically injured, but survived.

Although the Targa Florio was a rally-type race that took place on closed-off public mountain roads with (aside from straw bales and weak guardrails at some of the turns, the latter were installed by the island&#x27;s government) practically no safety features, only 9 people – including spectators – died at the event over the 71 year and 61 race history using a total of 6 circuit configurations. This number is relatively small compared to other open road races like the Mille Miglia, where over a period of 30 years and 24 races 56 people lost their lives, and the Carrera Panamericana, where over a period of 5 years and 5 races 25 people were killed. This is probably due to the fact that the very twisty nature of the mountain roads used kept average lap speeds very low, never going above
, even with the very long straight at the northernmost end of the track. In comparison, most road circuits had average speeds anywhere between and .

== Legacy ==
After winning the race several times, Porsche named the hardtop convertible version of the 911 after the Targa. The name &quot;targa&quot; means &quot;plaque&quot; or &quot;plate&quot;, see targa top.

The Australian-made Leyland P76 had a special version named Targa Florio to commemorate victory by journalist-rallyist Evan Green on a Special Stage of the 1974 London-Sahara-Munich World Cup Rally which was held on the Targa Florio course.

Since 1992 the event has lent its name to a modern recreation, staged half-a-world away in the form of the famous road rally Targa Tasmania held on the island state of Tasmania, off the Southern coast of Australia. There are also the Targa New Zealand since 1995, the Targa Newfoundland since 2002 and Targa Great Barrier Reef since 2018 where it is held in the Far North section of Queensland.

2017 will celebrate the 101st Anniversary of the Targa Florio and the first time the event has left Italy. This is an amazing attraction for Victoria, Australia and all car enthusiasts. The event, tours Victoria’s coast and countryside from November 29 to December 3 and features over 150 of the world’s most admirable cars and is expected to attract fans, celebrities and media from across the globe.

The Targa Florio Australian Tribute (TFAT - https://www.targaflorioaustralia.com/) is a regularity event for classic cars produced in the years between 1906 and 1976. Cars competed over 4 days on Victoria’s open roads at regulated speed. As part of the event there were 56 trials across the 4 days. The inaugural event was a huge success and was repeated in 2018. The 3rd Targa Florio Australian Tribute 2019 will be held in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, from 27 November to 1 December 2019.

==Winners==


Races between 1955 and 1973 were part of the World Championship, with the 1957 race not a race but a regularity test following the Mille Miglia accident.

<doc id="772097" wikidata="Q355341" url="?curid=772097" title="Mana (Japanese musician)">
<text>is a Japanese musician, songwriter, record producer, and fashion designer, best known as guitarist of the visual kei rock band Malice Mizer from their formation in 1992 until their indefinite hiatus in 2001. A year later, Mana formed the gothic metal band Moi dix Mois as his solo project.

Mana founded the independent record label Midi:Nette (French for &quot;starry-eyed girl&quot;) in 1994. In addition to signing electronic music duo Schwarz Stein, it has released the majority of Malice Mizer&#x27;s musical output and all of Moi dix Mois&#x27; material as well as 2 albums and 2 singles by Kanon Wakeshima. His clothing label, Moi-même-Moitié, was established in 1999 and is credited with helping popularize the Gothic Lolita fashion movement.

== Early life ==
Mana was born in Hiroshima. At an early age, he was introduced to classical music by his parents, who were both music teachers. Mana started making music when he was in high school, inspired by Mötley Crüe, and he learned to play the drums because of Tommy Lee. As a teen he had an aversion to all things &quot;girly&quot; and he described himself as a &quot;macho&quot; with a destructive attitude.

== Career ==
Mana&#x27;s real name is not known publicly. His stage name, sometimes written with the kanji , reads &quot;evil name&quot; or &quot;devil&#x27;s name&quot;. His fans refer to him as Mana-&quot;sama&quot;.

Mana&#x27;s first known band was the underground Ves.tearge in 1986. He later joined the punk rock group Girl&#x27;e, which was active from 1988 until 1990. He was known in both Ves.tearge and Girl&#x27;e by the stage name Serina, and was also a guitarist for both bands as well. Mana then played bass for , which was active from 1990 until 1992. After leaving them in April 1992, Mana and Matenrou guitarist Közi founded Malice Mizer in August. Mana was the band&#x27;s lead guitarist, chief songwriter, choreographer and overall artistic director. After Malice Mizer went on an indefinite hiatus in 2001, Mana founded his solo project, Moi dix Mois in 2002. He composes all of the music, writes the lyrics, produces, directs and designs the members&#x27; stage costumes.

Mana founded the independent record label Midi:Nette in 1994 for the release of Malice Mizer&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Memoire&quot;. In addition to most of Malice Mizer&#x27;s work, and most of Moi dix Mois&#x27; work, Midi:Nette has also released music by the electronic visual kei duo Schwarz Stein. Signed to the label in 2002, Mana also produced for them. Despite their growing success, Schwarz Stein disbanded in March 2004.

In 1999, Mana created his own clothing label, Moi-même-Moitié, which features two lines of designs named &quot;Elegant Gothic Lolita&quot; and &quot;Elegant Gothic Aristocrat&quot;. He regularly appears in the scene&#x27;s top publication, the &quot;Gothic &amp; Lolita Bible&quot;, modeling his own designs and giving updates on his various other projects. He is recognized internationally for his fashion endeavors; in 2007, British author Philomena Keet included him as one of seven designers in her Tokyo Look Book. Several other books dealing with Japanese fashion and culture have featured him, like &quot;Style Deficit Disorder&quot;. Moi-même-Moitié clothes and apparel were also sold in boutiques in Paris and the Netherlands, as well. As of October 2019, its collection is sold exclusively online.

In 2004, Mana started to branch out internationally by opening his fan club to overseas members (a rarity amongst Japanese musicians) and setting up international distribution channels for his music and fashion. He played his first concerts with Moi dix Mois outside Japan in March 2005 in Munich, Germany and Paris, France, during which he was interviewed and featured on the cover of European music magazines, such as the German goth magazine &quot;Orkus&quot;.

At the end of 2007 Moi dix Mois returned to Europe, performing in France (a DVD of the concert was released on January 30, 2008), Germany, Finland, Sweden, Spain and Italy.

In 2012, Moi dix Mois announced their first Latin America tour titled &quot;Tetsugaku no kakera - Chapter Six ～ Latin América Tour&quot;. The band planned to visit Brazil, Chile, Argentina and Mexico. Later, the tour was canceled. In 2013, Mana was featured in the music video for Kamijo&#x27;s single &quot;Louis ~Enketsu no La Vie en Rose~&quot;.

Mana has also produced solo vocalist and cellist Kanon Wakeshima, who debuted in May 2008 on Sony Defstar Records.

== Musical style ==
Mana&#x27;s composing style is very feeling-oriented. He refuses to learn music theory as he wants to create melodies and harmonies unlike other bands and finds regular song progressions dull. He composed based on the story he first creates, choosing the sound suitable for the story, using mainly guitar and keyboard. He believes in a natural flow of composing, and thus &quot;his compositions often change rhythm or key, have multiple melodies and are generally unpredictable&quot;.

==Public image==

Since the days of Malice Mizer, Mana rarely speaks in public. Although it was not a conscious decision at the beginning, he did latch onto the idea when the band&#x27;s direction became apparent. He speaks normally in printed interviews, but in his filmed interviews he whispers into the ear of a band member or confidante, who then relates his words back to the interviewer. He has also been known to simply look at the camera as subtitles appear, as well as using Yes/No cards and expressing himself in mime or through musical instruments.

He has, however, spoken on a few occasions. In a 1996 Malice Mizer interview on the TV show &quot;Hot Wave&quot;, he quietly replied with his name and his position in the band when introduced. But throughout the rest of the interview, Mana whispered in Gackt&#x27;s ear. He has also offered his vocals to the song, &quot;Kyomu no Naka de no Yuugi&quot;. Mana has stated on Twitter that his vocals were not distorted for this song when he sung it live, but he did whisper the lyrics.

Mana is known for wearing &#x27;female&#x27; clothes. Mana himself has said that he wanted to be the ultimate &quot;onnagata&quot;. English-language Japanese music website JaME said he started discovering his &quot;feminine side&quot; before Malice Mizer. His lack of speaking, combined with his commitment to &#x27;feminine&#x27; dress, led to people believing he was actually female. Japanese music website Barks stated that after Mana and Malice Mizer, the number of visual kei bands with &quot;onnagata&quot; members increased.

<doc id="772101" wikidata="Q724321" url="?curid=772101" title="Basso continuo">
<text>Basso continuo parts, almost universal in the Baroque era (1600–1750), provided the harmonic structure of the music by supplying a bassline and a chord progression. The phrase is often shortened to continuo, and the instrumentalists playing the continuo part are called the &quot;continuo group&quot;. 
==Forces==
The composition of the continuo group is often left to the discretion of the performers (or, for a large performance, the conductor), and practice varied enormously within the Baroque period. At least one instrument capable of playing chords must be included, such as a harpsichord, organ, lute, theorbo, guitar, regal, or harp. In addition, any number of instruments that play in the bass register may be included, such as cello, double bass, bass viol, or bassoon. In modern performances of chamber works, the most common combination is harpsichord and cello for instrumental works and secular vocal works, such as operas, and organ and cello for sacred music. A double bass may be added, particularly when accompanying a lower-pitched solo voice (e.g., a bass singer).

In larger orchestral works, typically performers match the instrument families used in the full ensemble: including bassoon when the work includes oboes or other woodwinds, but restricting it to cello or double bass if only strings are involved; although occasionally individual movements of suites deviate from this at the musical director&#x27;s discretion (e.g. bassoon without oboes). Harps, lutes, and other handheld instruments are more typical of early 17th-century music. Sometimes instruments are specified by the composer: in &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; (1607) Monteverdi calls for an exceptionally varied instrumentation, with multiple harpsichords and lutes with a bass violin in the pastoral scenes followed by lamenting to the accompaniment of &quot;organo di legno&quot; and &quot;chitarrone&quot;, while Charon stands watch to the sound of a regal. Contrabassoon is rare as a continuo instrument, but is often used in J. S. Bach&#x27;s Johannespassion which calls for &quot;bassono grosso&quot;.

The keyboard (or other chord-playing instrument) player &quot;realizes&quot; (that is, adds in an improvised fashion) a continuo part by playing, in addition to the notated bass line, notes above it to complete chords, either determined ahead of time or improvised in performance. The figured bass notation, described below, is a guide, but performers are also expected to use their musical judgment and the other instruments or voices (notably the lead melody and any accidentals that might be present in it) as a guide. Experienced players sometimes incorporate motives found in the other instrumental parts into their improvised chordal accompaniment. Modern editions of such music usually supply a realized keyboard part, fully written out in staff notation for a player, in place of improvisation. With the rise in historically informed performance, however, the number of performers who are able to improvise their parts from the figures, as Baroque players would have done, has increased.

==Notation==
Chord-playing continuo instrument parts are often written in figured bass. A part so annotated consists of a bass line in notes on a musical staff plus numbers and accidentals (or in some cases (back)slashes added to a number) beneath the staff to indicate what intervals above the bass notes should be played, and therefore which inversions of which chords are to be played.

The phrase &quot;tasto solo&quot; indicates that only the bass line (without any upper chords) is to be played for a short period, usually until the next figure is encountered. This instructs the chord-playing instrumentalist not to play any improvised chords for a period. The reason &quot;tasto solo&quot; had to be specified was because it was an accepted convention that if no figures were present in a section of otherwise figured bass line, the chord-playing performer would either assume that it was a root-position triad, or deduce from the harmonic motion that another figure was implied. For example, if a continuo part in the key of C begins with a C bass note in the first measure, which descends to a B in the second measure, even in the absence of figures, the chord-playing instrumentalist would know to play a first inversion V chord (spelled B–D–G, from bottom note of the chord to the top).

==History==
Basso continuo, though an essential structural and identifying element of the Baroque period, continued to be used in many works, mostly (but not limited to) sacred choral works, of the classical period (up to around 1800). An example is C. P. E. Bach&#x27;s Concerto in D minor for flute, strings and basso continuo. Examples of its use in the 19th century are rarer, but they do exist: masses by Anton Bruckner, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Franz Schubert, for example, have a basso continuo part that was for an organist.

<text>The Chicago City Council is the legislative branch of the government of the City of Chicago in Illinois. It consists of 50 alderpersons elected from 50 wards to serve four-year terms. The council is called into session regularly, usually monthly, to consider ordinances, orders, and resolutions whose subject matter includes code changes, utilities, taxes, and many other issues. The Chicago City Council Chambers are located in Chicago City Hall, as are the downtown offices of the individual alderpersons and staff.

The presiding officer of the council is the Mayor of Chicago, who is usually non-voting, except in rare cases, such as to break a tie. The secretary is the City Clerk of Chicago. Both positions are city-wide elected offices. In the absence of the mayor, an alderperson is elected to the position of President Pro Tempore serves as the presiding officer.

Originally established as the Common Council in 1837, it was renamed City Council in 1876. The Council assumed its modern form of 50 wards electing one alderperson each in 1923.

==Composition==

The most recent city council election was the 2023 Chicago aldermanic elections. The current term began on May 15, 2023.

Alderperson elections are officially nonpartisan; party affiliations below are informational only. Council members also self-organize into caucuses, or blocs that address particular issues. Active caucuses include the Black Caucus, Democratic Socialist Caucus, Latino Caucus, LGBT Caucus, and Progressive Reform Caucus.

== Standing committees ==
The city council is internally organized into subject-specific standing committees. Once proposed legislation is drafted, it is assigned to a specific standing committee. After a hearing and deliberation process, the committee votes on whether to report the proposed legislation to the full council, along with recommendations.

The committees are created, and their leaders and members are selected, through a resolution passed by the whole council. Historically, mayors have played a central role in selecting committee chairs. 

As of May 2023, a majority of incoming City Council members after the 2023 election had agreed to a plan for the following subcommittees and chair assignments:

== History ==


Chicago has been divided into wards since 1837, beginning with 6 wards. Until 1923, each ward elected two members to the city council. In 1923, the system that exists today was adopted with 50 wards, each with one council member elected by the ward. In accordance with Illinois state law, ward borders must be shifted after every federal census. This law is intended to give the population of the ward equal representation based by the size of the population of Chicago.

Chicago is unusual among major United States cities in the number of wards and representative alderpersons that it maintains. It has been noted that the current ward system promotes diverse ethnic and cultural representation on the city council.

In June 2021, the State of Illinois adopted a statute that changed the title of City Council members to &quot;alderperson&quot; (plural: &quot;alderpersons&quot;), replacing the gendered term &quot;aldermen&quot;. However, some members of City Council continue to use the term &quot;alderman&quot; or instead use &quot;alderwoman&quot; or &quot;alder&quot;.

===Corruption===
Chicago City Council Chambers has long been the center of public corruption in Chicago. The first conviction of Chicago alderpersons and Cook County Commissioners for accepting bribes to rig a crooked contract occurred in 1869. Between 1972 and 1999, 26 current or former Chicago alderpersons were convicted for official corruption. Between 1973 and 2012, 31 alderpersons were convicted of corruption. Approximately 100 alderpersons served in that period, which is a conviction rate of about one-third.

Fourteen of the Chicago&#x27;s City Council&#x27;s nineteen committees routinely violated the Illinois Open Meetings Act during the last four months of 2007 by not keeping adequate written records of their meetings. Chicago City Council committees violated the Illinois Open Meetings Act and their own rules by meeting and taking actions without a quorum at least four times over the same four-month span.

Over half of elected Chicago alderpersons took illegal campaign contributions totalling $282,000 in 2013.

==Election==

Chicago alderpersons are elected by popular vote every four years, on the last Tuesday in February in the year following national mid-term elections. A run-off election, if no candidate garners more than fifty percent of the vote, is held on the first Tuesday in April. The election is held on a non-partisan basis. New terms begin at noon on the third Monday in May following the election.

==Authority and roles==
The council, in conjunction with the Mayor of Chicago, hears recommendations from the Commission on Chicago Landmarks and then may grant individual properties Chicago Landmark status. The Council also has the power to redraw ward boundaries, resulting in the heavily gerrymandered map seen today.

===Law===
The &quot;Journal of the Proceedings of the City Council of the City of Chicago&quot; is the official publication of the acts of the City Council. The &quot;Municipal Code of Chicago&quot; is the codification of Chicago&#x27;s local ordinances of a general and permanent nature. Between May 18, 2011, and August 2011, the first 100 days of the first term of Mayor Rahm Emanuel, 2,845 ordinances and orders were introduced to the Council.

=== Aldermanic privilege ===
Chicago&#x27;s alderpersons are generally given exceptional deference, called &quot;aldermanic privilege&quot; or &quot;aldermanic prerogative&quot;, to control city decisions and services within their ward. This is an unwritten and informal practice that emerged in the early 20th century and gives alderpersons control over &quot;zoning, licenses, permits, property-tax reductions, city contracts and patronage jobs&quot; in their wards. Political scientists have suggested that this facilitates corruption. The system has been described as &quot;50 aldermen serving essentially as mayors of 50 wards.&quot;

<doc id="772110" wikidata="Q1219817" url="?curid=772110" title="The Four Musketeers (tennis)">
<text>The Four Musketeers, () named after a 1921 film adaptation of Alexandre Dumas&#x27; novel, were French tennis players who were top competitors of the game during the second half of the 1920s and early 1930s, winning 18 Grand Slam singles titles and 13 Grand Slam doubles. They also led France to six straight Davis Cup wins, 1927–32, in an era when Cup matches enjoyed a prestige similar to today&#x27;s FIFA World Cup finals. At its creation in 1927, the men&#x27;s French Open trophy was named the &quot;Coupe des Mousquetaires&quot; in honour of the quartet.

==The Musketeers==
The Musketeers were:
*Jean Borotra (1898–1994)
*Jacques Brugnon (1895–1978)
*Henri Cochet (1901–1987)
*René Lacoste (1904–1996)

While Brugnon was primarily a doubles specialist, Borotra, Cochet, and Lacoste won many singles titles. Among them, they won three United States Championships at Forest Hills, six consecutive Wimbledon titles from 1924 through 1929, and 10 titles in 11 years at the French Championships from 1922 through 1932 (up to and including 1924, though, the tournament was only open to members of French tennis clubs, therefore wasn&#x27;t a major tournament until 1925). From 1926 until 1930, either Lacoste or Cochet was ranked No. 1 in the world, and in 1926 and 1927 all four musketeers were ranked in the top-10. The only player capable of challenging their dominance was the great American Bill Tilden (world number-one from 1920 until 1926, when Lacoste took over the position). The Musketeers were finally eclipsed by the arrival of Ellsworth Vines, Fred Perry and Jack Crawford on the international tennis scene in the first half of the 1930s.

==Legacy==
The success of The Four Musketeers in winning the 1927 Davis Cup against the United States was directly responsible for the decision by the French Tennis Federation to build the Roland Garros venue at Porte d&#x27;Auteuil. The four men were national icons in France and all of them lived to be at least 83 years old, basking in glory for many years after their retirement from tennis. They were simultaneously inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1976.

The New Musketeers, (&quot;Nouveaux Mousquetaires&quot; or &quot;néo-Mousquetaires&quot;) was first used to refer to the group of players in the 1980s and &#x27;90s who enjoyed the country&#x27;s greatest success since the end of World War II. Yannick Noah won the French Open in 1983, Henri Leconte reached the final of the same tournament in 1988, and the two teamed up to win the men&#x27;s doubles at Roland Garros in 1984. Leconte and Guy Forget then won France&#x27;s first Davis Cup for almost sixty years in 1991, captained by Noah.

A second group of New Musketeers, as coined in &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; and adopted by the French press, refers to the 21st century squad of star players headlined by Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Gaël Monfils, Richard Gasquet and Gilles Simon. In 2008, France boasted four Top 20 players, a feat never before achieved since computer rankings were established in 1973. This configuration of the same four players in the Top 20 has been reproduced in mid-2011, in early 2012 and early 2016.

<text>Kevin Jeffrey Clash (born September 17, 1960) is an American puppeteer, director and producer best known for puppeteering Elmo on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; from 1985 to 2012. He also performed puppets for &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, &quot;Dinosaurs&quot;, &quot;Oobi&quot;, and various Muppet productions.

Clash developed an interest in puppetry at an early age and, in his teen years, performed for local television children&#x27;s shows in his hometown of Baltimore, Maryland. He joined the cast of &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; in the early 1980s and began performing on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in 1984. He was the fifth puppeteer to perform Elmo, who became his signature character, and he also served as an executive producer and director for the show. Clash worked in various productions with The Jim Henson Company and occasionally on other projects. Clash&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;My Life as a Furry Red Monster&quot;, was published in 2006; he was later the subject of the documentary &quot;Being Elmo: A Puppeteer&#x27;s Journey&quot; (2011).

Clash resigned from &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in 2012 after allegations of sexual impropriety with minors, all of which he denied and were later dismissed due to expiration of the statute of limitations. Clash returned to puppeteering as a supporting performer in the adult comedy &quot;The Happytime Murders&quot; (2018).

==Early years==
Clash was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on September 17, 1960, the third of four children born to George Clash, a flash welder and handyman, and Gladys Clash, who ran a small daycare center in their two-bedroom, one-bath home in the Turner Station area of Dundalk, Maryland. Clash developed an interest in puppetry at an early age, inspired by children&#x27;s shows like &quot;Kukla, Fran and Ollie&quot; and &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. He made his first puppet, a version of Mickey Mouse, at the age of 10. When he was twelve, he made a monkey puppet out of the lining of his father&#x27;s coat. His first performances were for his mother&#x27;s daycare children.

By the time he was a teenager, he had built almost 90 puppets, which he based upon commercials, popular music, and his friends. While still in high school, Clash performed at venues throughout Baltimore, including schools, churches, fundraisers, and community events. While appearing at a neighborhood festival, Clash was discovered by Baltimore television personality Stu Kerr, who became Clash&#x27;s first mentor and hired him to perform in the children&#x27;s show &quot;Caboose&quot; at Channel 2. Clash also built puppets for the &quot;Romper Room&quot; franchise. When he was 17, he contacted and met puppeteer Kermit Love, who became Clash&#x27;s mentor, after seeing Love featured in an episode of the children&#x27;s educational television series &quot;Call It Macaroni&quot;. In 1979, on Love&#x27;s recommendation, Clash appeared as Cookie Monster in the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; float during the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade and met Jim Henson, who later became his boss, mentor, and good friend.

When he was 19, Clash became a puppeteer for &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;, initially as a guest performer, in which he also made occasional on-camera appearances. The producers of &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; used some of Clash&#x27;s puppet creations for the show. In 1984, Clash had to turn down Henson&#x27;s offer to work on his film &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; because he was working on two TV shows at the same time, &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; and Love&#x27;s syndicated program &quot;The Great Space Coaster&quot;, in which he was producer for the first time.

==Career==
&quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; was canceled in 1984 after 29 seasons, and &quot;Great Space Coaster&quot; ended, freeing up Clash to work on projects with Henson such as the film &quot;Labyrinth&quot; and &quot;Sesame Street.&quot; Clash started working at &quot;Sesame Street&quot; for ten episodes in 1983, mostly performing nondescript, stand-in puppets known as Anything Muppets. Some of his earliest characters included the saxophone-playing Hoots the Owl (based on Louis Armstrong), the infant Baby Natasha, and inventor Dr. Nobel Price. He worked on the 1985 feature film &quot;Follow That Bird&quot;. After 1985, Elmo, a furry red monster, became his main character. Three puppeteers, including Richard Hunt, had performed Elmo previously, but it was Clash&#x27;s development, with a falsetto voice, that established the character. He based Elmo&#x27;s character on the preschool children that attended his mother&#x27;s daycare in Baltimore and upon his own personality and the personality of his parents. Clash followed the advice of fellow puppeteer Frank Oz, who told Clash to always &quot;find one special hook&quot; for each character. Clash decided that the central characteristic for Elmo should be that he &quot;should represent love&quot;.
After the height of Elmo&#x27;s popularity, especially the &quot;Tickle Me Elmo&quot; craze in 1996, Clash&#x27;s responsibilities at &quot;Sesame Street&quot; increased. He recruited, auditioned, and trained its puppeteers, and became the senior Muppet coordinator, a writer, director, and co-producer of the &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; segment of the show. Clash worked with and mentored the puppeteers of &quot;Sesame Street&#x27;s&quot; international co-productions. He found working with the co-productions &quot;a lot of fun&quot; and &quot;very rewarding&quot;. In 2007, he was promoted to senior creative adviser for the Sesame Workshop. Until 2011, he was the sole performer as Elmo in all his public relations appearances, making his schedule, as he called it, &quot;crazy&quot;. Cheryl Henson, president of the Jim Henson Foundation, called him &quot;essential&quot; to the show.

Clash worked on the first film version of &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, in 1990 and the sequel, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze&quot;, which was dedicated to Henson, in 1991, voicing Master Splinter. He performed in several productions with Jim Henson Productions, including as the Muppet Clifford in &quot;The Jim Henson Hour&quot; (1989), and performing the puppetry for Frank Oz&#x27;s characters (Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Sam the Eagle, and Animal) in &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot; (1996). Clash performed in the films &quot;Muppets from Space&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Muppets&#x27; Wizard of Oz&quot; (2005), and the TV series &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot; (1996–1998), in which he reprised Clifford, who served as the show&#x27;s host. He performed characters and worked behind the scenes on the sitcom &quot;Dinosaurs&quot;.

In 2006, Clash published his autobiography, co-written by Gary Brozek and Louis Henry Mitchell, entitled &quot;My Life as a Furry Red Monster: What Being Elmo Has Taught Me About Life, Love and Laughing Out Loud&quot;. His life was featured in the 2011 documentary &quot;Being Elmo: A Puppeteer&#x27;s Journey&quot;.

After a hiatus of several years, Clash returned to performing with the film &quot;The Happytime Murders&quot; (2018), directed by Brian Henson and co-produced through Henson Alternative. He later puppeteered in the 2019 Netflix series &quot;The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance&quot;, which serves as a prequel series to the 1982 Jim Henson film &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;.

==Personal life==
Clash has stated that although children ignore him and speak directly to Elmo, black adults tend to be surprised when they meet him. He has stated in interviews that his racial identity was pertinent to his work, and that it came through in his performances.

Clash was married for 17 years and has a daughter who was born in 1993.

In November 2012, Clash publicly revealed his homosexuality in response to the allegations that led to his resignation from Sesame Workshop, stating, &quot;I am a gay man. I have never been ashamed of this or tried to hide it, but felt it was a personal and private matter.&quot;

In 2015, Clash moved to Los Angeles to work on other Jim Henson Company productions, including &quot;The Happytime Murders&quot; and &quot;The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance&quot;, performing Lyle and Mr. Bumblypants in the former and Aughra in the latter.

===Abuse allegations===
In November 2012, 23-year-old Sheldon Stephens alleged that he had been in a sexual relationship with Clash that began when Stephens was 16, which would be a felony under New York law that declares illegal any sexual relationship with individuals under 17 years of age, whether consensual or not. Sesame Workshop had initially been presented with the allegation in June, and its investigation found the allegation to be unsubstantiated. Clash acknowledged that he had been in a relationship with the accuser; however, he said the relationship was between two consenting adults. Stephens later recanted his accusation, but two weeks later, another accuser, Cecil Singleton, accused Clash of sexually abusing him when he was 15 years old, and lawsuits were filed by attorney Jeffrey Herman against Clash.

Clash resigned from Sesame Workshop on November 20, 2012, and released a statement saying, &quot;Personal matters have diverted attention away from the important work &#x27;Sesame Street&#x27; is doing and I cannot allow it to go on any longer. I am deeply sorry to be leaving and am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately&quot;. Sesame Workshop also released a statement: &quot;Unfortunately, the controversy surrounding Kevin&#x27;s personal life has become a distraction that none of us want, and he has concluded that he can no longer be effective in his job and has resigned from &#x27;Sesame Street&#x27;.&quot; They stated that other puppeteers had been trained to serve as Clash&#x27;s understudy and would take over his roles on the show.

In July 2013, the three cases against Clash were dismissed because it was ruled that the claims were made more than six years after each man reasonably should have become aware of Clash&#x27;s alleged violations during the three years after each turned 18. Clash&#x27;s lawyers expressed his hope that the ruling would allow him to restore his personal and professional life. Lawyers for the plaintiffs appealed the ruling, alleging that the psychological effects of the abuse were not fully realized until 2012. In April 2014, the decision to dismiss the three lawsuits was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals. Months after the other alleged victims made legal accusations, Stephens filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania against Clash, but it was ultimately dismissed in June 2014 because the statute of limitations had passed.

<doc id="772114" wikidata="Q551473" url="?curid=772114" title="Thomas Quasthoff">
<text>Thomas Quasthoff (born 9 November 1959) is a German bass-baritone. Quasthoff has a range of musical interest from Bach cantatas, to lieder, and solo jazz improvisations. Born with severe birth defects caused by thalidomide, Quasthoff is , and has phocomelia.

==Early life and career==
Quasthoff was born in Hildesheim with serious birth defects caused by his mother&#x27;s exposure during pregnancy to the drug thalidomide, which was prescribed as an antiemetic to combat her morning sickness.

Quasthoff was denied admission to the Hochschule für Musik, Theater und Medien Hannover, owing to his physical inability to play the piano, rather than a lack of skill required for entry to the conservatory. In the early stages of his education as a singer, Quasthoff was promoted by Sebastian Peschko. Thus, he chose to study voice privately. He also studied law for three years. Prior to his music career, he worked for six years as a radio announcer for NDR. He also did voice-over work for television.

==Music career==
Quasthoff&#x27;s music career was launched in 1988 when he won the ARD International Music Competition in Munich, earning praise from the baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. His performance of lieder was appreciated for its detail, directness and his vocal range and colour. In 1995, he made his American debut at the Oregon Bach Festival at the invitation of artistic director Helmuth Rilling; in 1998, he was one of the soloists for the festival&#x27;s world premiere of Penderecki&#x27;s Credo, the recording of which won a Grammy Award for best choral recording. In 2003, he made his staged operatic debut as Don Fernando in Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot; at the Salzburg Festival, conducted by Simon Rattle. In 2004 he performed Amfortas in &quot;Parsifal&quot; with the Vienna State Opera.

Quasthoff recorded for Deutsche Grammophon (DG). In addition to recordings of classical repertoire, he released his first jazz album for DG in 2007, &quot;The Jazz Album: Watch What Happens&quot;, with Till Brönner, Alan Broadbent, Peter Erskine, Dieter Ilg, and Chuck Loeb.

For the 2006/2007 concert season, Quasthoff was one of Carnegie Hall&#x27;s &quot;Perspectives&quot; artists. However, illness forced him to cancel his first two appearances in that capacity.

As artist-in-residence at the Barbican Hall, London, Quasthoff invited some of his favourite fellow artists in a series under the title (The Voice, also the name of his autobiography) which marked his 50th birthday. Quasthoff was a guest of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in February 2009.

In January 2012, Quasthoff announced his retirement from public performance. He cited various reasons such as illness, the strains of touring, and the death of his brother Michael from lung cancer.

He later returned to performance. This included appearing in concert in 2016, notably as the speaker in Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Gurre-Lieder&quot;. He performed as Feste in the play &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. He also performed with his jazz quartet and with a spoken role in a semi-staged opera at the Edinburgh International Festival in 2021.

Quasthoff is also a voice professor. He previously taught at the Hochschule für Musik Detmold, Germany. He is currently a professor at the Hanns Eisler School of Music in Berlin.

He led development of &quot;Das Lied&quot;, a biennial international song competition that started in 2009.

==Awards==
Quasthoff has received three Grammy awards during his career to 2021. He won the Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Performance in 2000, for his recording with Anne Sofie von Otter of Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot;, along with the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by Claudio Abbado. His recordings of the songs of Brahms, Liszt and Schubert accompanied by pianist Justus Zeyen were nominated for the Grammy in 2000 and 2001. He won the Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Performance for the second time in 2004. It was for &quot;Schubert: Lieder with Orchestra&quot; which Quasthoff performed with von Otter and the Chamber Orchestra of Europe conducted by Abbado. Quasthoff won the Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Performance for the third time in 2006 with Rainer Kussmaul, the Berlin Baroque Soloists and the RIAS Chamber Choir in their recording of &quot;J. S. Bach: Cantatas&quot;. In 2008, he was a soloist on the Grammy-winning recording of Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Ein Deutsches Requiem&quot; (Simon Rattle, conductor; Simon Halsey, chorus master) on EMI Classics.

In 2005, Quasthoff received Germany&#x27;s Great Cross of Merit.

In 2009, he was awarded the Herbert von Karajan Music Prize. That same year he was awarded the gold medal for outstanding musicianship by the Royal Philharmonic Society.

==Personal life==
In 2006, Quasthoff married Claudia Stelzig, a German TV journalist.

In a 2003 interview, Quasthoff revealed that he is an active political thinker, is a socialist, and was opposed to the Iraq War. He also expressed regret that the Israeli–Palestinian conflict could not be resolved via compromise.

<doc id="772116" wikidata="Q1342606" url="?curid=772116" title="Gordon Bennett Cup (auto racing)">
<text>In automobile racing, the Gordon Bennett Cup was an annual competition which ran from 1900 to 1905. It was one of three Gordon Bennett Cups established by James Gordon Bennett, Jr., millionaire owner of the &quot;New York Herald.&quot;

In 1899, Gordon Bennett offered the &quot;Automobile Club de France&quot; (ACF) a trophy to be raced for annually by the automobile clubs of the various countries. The competition was held until 1905, after which the ACF held the first Grand Prix motor racing event at a road course near Le Mans.

The 1903 event in Ireland possibly gave rise to the birth of British Racing Green.

== The Cup ==
The trophy given to the winner was a sculpture of a Panhard racing car driven by the Genius of Progress with the Goddess of Victory as passenger.

== Rules ==
Competition was intended to be between national automobile clubs, or nations, and not individuals. The first contestants were France, Great Britain, the United States, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, and Italy. Each club was required to pay a Fr3000 entry fee. Each could send up to three cars; drivers had to be members of the entrant club.

A race, once scheduled, had to be held between 15 May and 15 August, with a total distance of between . Participating clubs shared the cost of running the event.

The cars themselves had to have two seats, side by side, with driver and riding mechanic (who were to weigh no less than each). Cars were to weigh at least empty, and had to be built entirely in the country under whose colours they ran.

==Gordon Bennett races==
The Gordon Bennett Cup auto races drew entrants from across Europe, including future aviator Henry Farman, and competitors from the United States such as Alexander Winton driving his Winton automobile. Under the rules, the races were hosted in the country of the previous year&#x27;s winner. As the races were between national teams, it led to the reorganisation and standardisation of national racing colours. Count Eliot Zborowski, father of inter-war racing legend Louis Zborowski, suggested that each national entrant be allotted a different colour. Britain had to choose a different colour from its usual national colours of red, white and blue, as these had already been taken by USA, Germany, and France respectively.

Reputedly as a concession to Ireland where the 1903 Gordon Bennett Cup race was run (racing was illegal on British public roads), the British adopted shamrock green which became known as British racing green, although the winning Napier of 1902 had already been painted olive green, and green was well-established as an appropriate colour for locomotives and machinery, in which Britain had led the world during the previous century.

===1900 Gordon Bennett Cup===

The international motor car race from Paris to Lyons for the Gordon Bennett Cup took place on 14 June 1900. The start from Paris was made at 3 o&#x27;clock in the morning and Charron was the first to reach Lyons, arriving at 12:23 p.m. M. Girardot finished second at 2 o&#x27;clock.

===1901 Gordon Bennett Cup===

In 1901 the Gordon Bennett Cup race was run in conjunction with the Paris-Bordeaux race on 29 May over a distance of 527.1 km. The race was won by Henri Fournier driving a Mors with a time of 6h 10m 44s. The first of the Gordon Bennett Cup contestants was Leonce Girardot, driving a Panhard with a time of 8h 50m 59s.

===1902 Gordon Bennett Cup===

The 1902 Gordon Bennett Cup was run over a distance of 565 km from Paris to Innsbruck in conjunction with the Paris-Vienna motor car race. The race started in Paris on 26 June. Competing were 30 heavy cars, 48 light cars, six voiturettes, three motorcycles, and three motorcyclettes. Each nation was allowed to nominate up to three cars to compete for the Gordon Bennett Cup, but only six entries were received, three French and three British. The Automobile Club of Great Britain announced that car No. 160 driven by Mr White, and car No. 45, made by Napier &amp; Son of London with Dunlop tyres, driven by Mr Edge would represent the club. The Times announced on June 30 that Edge had won the Gordon Bennett Cup. It was announced in Vienna on 1 July that M. Marcel Renault had won the Paris-Vienna race, with M. Henri Farman second.

===1903 Gordon Bennett Cup===

On Thursday, 2 July 1903 the Gordon Bennett Cup was the first international motor race to be held in Ireland, an honorific to Selwyn Edge who had won the 1902 event in the Paris-Vienna race driving a Napier. The Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland wanted the race to be hosted in the British Isles, and their secretary, Claude Johnson, suggested Ireland as the venue because racing was illegal on British public roads. The editor of the &quot;Dublin Motor News&quot;, Richard J. Mecredy, suggested an area in County Kildare, and letters were sent to 102 Irish MPs, 90 Irish peers, 300 newspapers, 34 chairmen of county and local councils, 34 County secretaries, 26 mayors, 41 railway companies, 460 hoteliers, 13 PPs, plus the Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin, Patrick Foley, who pronounced himself in favour. Local laws had to be adjusted, ergo the &#x27;Light Locomotives (Ireland) Bill&#x27; was passed on 27 March 1903. Kildare and other local councils drew attention to their areas, whilst Queen&#x27;s County declared &quot;That every facility will be given and the roads placed at the disposal of motorists during the proposed race.&quot; Eventually Kildare was chosen, partly on the grounds that the straightness of the roads would be a safety benefit. As a compliment to Ireland the British team chose to race in Shamrock green which thus became known as British racing green although the winning Napier of 1902 had been painted Olive green.

There was considerable public concern about safety after the 1901 Paris-Bordeaux Rally, in which at least eight people had been killed, and severe crashes during the 24 May 1903 Paris-Madrid race where more than 200 cars competed over a distance of but which had to be halted at Bordeaux because there had been so many fatalities. To allay these fears, the 1903 race was held over a closed course which had been carefully prepared for the event, and was marshalled by 7,000 police officers assisted by troops and club stewards, with strict instructions to keep spectators off the roads and away from corners. The route consisted of two loops that comprised a figure of eight, the first was a 52-mile loop that included Kilcullen, The Curragh, Kildare, Monasterevin, Ballydavis (Portlaoise), Stradbally, Athy, followed by a 40-mile loop through Castledermot, Carlow, and Athy again. The race started at the Ballyshannon cross-roads () near Calverstown on the contemporary N78 heading north, then followed the N9 north; the N7 west; the N80 south; the N78 north again; the N9 south; the N80 north; the N78 north again.

The official timekeeper of the race was Mr. T. H. Woolen of the Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland. Ninety one Chronographs for timing the race were supplied by the Anglo-Swiss firm Stauffer Son &amp; Co. of La Chaux-de-Fonds and London. Competitors were started at seven-minute intervals and had to follow bicycles through the &#x27;control zones&#x27; in each town.
The race was won by the famous Belgian Camille Jenatzy, driving a Mercedes in German colours.

===1904 Gordon Bennett Cup===
&quot;The Times&quot; reported the 1904 Gordon Bennett motor race took place in Germany on 17 June over , consisting of four laps of a course in the neighbourhood of Homburg. From Saalburg the course ran north to Usingen, where there was a control point (an inhabited or built up area where the cars had to travel slowly under the supervision of course officials) then through Graefenwiesbach to Weilburg, where there was a second control point, then past Allendorf and Obertiefenbach to Limburg. This section was reported to be the best part of the course for high speed and in practice some cars travelled at . At Limburgh there was another control, then the course ran through Kirberg to Neuhof, where there was a very bad turn, and then to Idstein where there was another control. It then ran through Glashuetten to Koenigstein (control), then via Friedrichshof and Oberursel (control) to Homburg (control) and back to Saalburg.

Officiating were Baron von Molitor of the German Automobile Club, the official starter, and M. Tampier of the French Automobile Club who was timekeeper. The chronographs for timing the event were supplied by the Anglo-Swiss firm of Stauffer Son &amp; Co. Officials from the other competing countries were also present.

There were 18 starters including three British entrants. The first car started from Saalburg at 7 a.m. The winner was Théry of France, who accomplished the four laps in , an average speed of . Jenatzy was second, driving a Mercedes. The only British competitor placed was Sidney Girling driving a Wolseley. Australia&#x27;s S. F. Edge, the 1902 winner who again drove a Napier, was reported to have held a good position during the first two laps, but was disqualified on lap three after receiving outside assistance due to tyre problems.

===1905 Gordon Bennett Cup===

In 1905, &quot;The Times&quot; reported on the last of the six Gordon-Bennett Cup Races, which took place in France on 5 July over a 137 km mountainous circuit in the Auvergne near to Clermont-Ferrand. After four circuits of the course, a total of 548 km, which he completed in 7hr 2min 42sec, an average speed of 77.78 km/h, the Frenchman Léon Théry on a 96 hp Richard-Brasier won for the second year in a row. Lancia on a FIAT for Italy was fastest over the first two laps, but broke down with radiator problems during his third lap. Théry eventually came in first ahead of Nazzaro, also on a FIAT, who finished in 7hr 19min 9sec.

Chronographs for timing for the event were again supplied by Stauffer Son &amp; Co.

The race took place on the doorstep of the Clermont-Ferrand headquarters of Michelin, and cars fitted with Michelin tyres took the first four places.

==Notes==

a. According to &quot;Leinster Leader&quot;, Saturday, 11 April 1903, Britain had to choose a different colour to its usual national colours of red, white, and blue, as these had already been taken by Italy, Germany, and France respectively. It also stated red as the color for &quot;American&quot; cars in the 1903 Gordon Bennett Cup.

<text>A household deity is a deity or spirit that protects the home, looking after the entire household or certain key members. It has been a common belief in paganism as well as in folklore across many parts of the world.

Household deities fit into two types; firstly, a specific deity typically a goddess often referred to as a hearth goddess or domestic goddess who is associated with the home and hearth, such as the ancient Greek Hestia.

The second type of household deity is not one singular deity but a type or species of animistic, which usually has lesser powers than major deities. This type was common in the religions of antiquity, such as the lares of ancient Roman religion, the gashin of Korean shamanism, and cofgodas of Anglo-Saxon paganism. These survived Christianisation as fairy-like creatures existing in folklore, such as the Anglo-Scottish brownie and Slavic domovoy.

Household deities were usually worshipped not in temples but in the home, where they would be represented by small idols (such as the teraphim of the Bible, often translated as &quot;household gods&quot; in Genesis 31:19 for example), amulets, paintings, or reliefs. They could also be found on domestic objects, such as cosmetic articles in the case of Tawaret. The more prosperous houses might have a small shrine to the household god(s); the lararium served this purpose in the case of the Romans. The gods would be treated as members of the family and invited to join in meals or be given offerings of food and drink.

== Types==

In ancient and modern religions, a god would preside over the home.

Certain species, or types, of household deities existed. An example of this was the Roman Lares.

Many European cultures retained house spirits into the modern period. Some examples of these include:

* Brownie (Scotland and England) or Hob (England) / Kobold (Germany) / Duende y Trasgu (Spain and Portugal) / Goblin / Hobgoblin
* Domovoy (Slavic)
* Nisse (Norwegian or Danish) / Tomte (Swedish) / Tonttu (Finnish)
* Húsvættir (Norse)

Although the cosmic status of household deities was not as lofty as that of the Twelve Olympians or the Aesir, they were also jealous of their dignity and also had to be appeased with shrines and offerings, however humble. Because of their immediacy, they had arguably more influence on the day-to-day affairs of men than the remote gods did. Vestiges of their worship persisted long after Christianity and other major religions extirpated nearly every trace of the major pagan pantheons. Elements of the practice can be seen even today, with Christian accretions, where statues to various saints (such as St. Francis) protect gardens and grottos. Even the gargoyles found on older churches could be viewed as guardians partitioning a sacred space.

For centuries, Christianity fought a mop-up war against these lingering minor pagan deities, but they proved tenacious. For example, Martin Luther&#x27;s &quot;Tischreden&quot; have numerous quite serious references to dealing with kobolds. Eventually, rationalism and the Industrial Revolution threatened to erase most of these minor deities until the advent of romantic nationalism rehabilitated them and embellished them into objects of literary curiosity in the 19th century. Since the 20th century, this literature has been mined for characters for role-playing games, video games, and other fantasy personae, not infrequently invested with invented traits and hierarchies somewhat different from their mythological and folkloric roots.

== Origins in animism and ancestor worship ==

=== Shinto as an exemplar of development ===
The general dynamics of the origin and development of household deities over a considerable span may be traced and exemplified by the historically attested origins and current practices of the Shinto belief system in Japan. As the Japanologist Lafcadio Hearn put it:

Drawing the picture with broader strokes, he continues:
Furthermore,

Many Japanese houses still have a shrine (&quot;kamidana&quot;, kami shelf) where offerings are made to ancestral kami, as well as to other kami.

=== Cultural evolution and survival ===
Edward Burnett Tylor, one of the main founders of the discipline of cultural anthropology, spoke of &quot;survivals&quot;, vestiges of earlier evolutionary stages in a culture&#x27;s development. He also coined the term animism. Tylor disagreed with Herbert Spencer, another founder of anthropology, as well as of sociology, about the innateness of the human tendency towards animistic explanations, but both agreed that ancestor worship was the root of religion and that domestic deities were survivals from such an early stage.

==== Animism and totemism ====
In contradistinction to both Herbert Spencer and Edward Burnett Tylor, who defended theories of animistic origins of ancestor worship, Émile Durkheim saw its genesis in totemism. This distinction is somewhat academic since totemism may be regarded as a particularized manifestation of animism, and a synthesis of the two positions was attempted by Sigmund Freud. In Freud&#x27;s &quot;Totem and Taboo&quot;, both totem and taboo are outward expressions or manifestations of the same psychological tendency, a concept which is complementary to, or which rather reconciles, the apparent conflict. Freud preferred to emphasize the psychoanalytic implications of the reification of metaphysical forces but with particular emphasis on its familial nature. This emphasis underscores, rather than weakens, the ancestral component.

=== Domestic deities and ancestor worship ===

==== Jacob Grimm (1835) ====

European folklorist Jacob Grimm did not hesitate to equate the Roman lar familiaris to the brownie. He explains in some detail in his &quot;Deutsche Mythologie&quot;:
==== Thomas Keightley (1870) ====

To underscore the equivalence of brownie, kobold, and goblin, consider the words of the English historian and folklorist Thomas Keightley:

==== MacMichael (1907) ====
MacMichael elaborated his views on the folkloric belief complex as follows:
==== &quot;New International Encyclopaedia&quot; ====
Demonstrating that this evolution and functional equivalence has generally come to be accepted and that their nature is indeed that proposed by Grimm, one may refer to the early twentieth century &quot;New International Encyclopaedia&quot;:
and also
=== Origin of ancestor worship in animism ===

==== Hearn (1878) ====
William Edward Hearn, a noted classicist and jurist, traced the origin of domestic deities from the earliest stages as an expression of animism, a belief system thought to have existed also in the neolithic and the forerunner of Indo-European religion. In his analysis of the Indo-European household, in Chapter II, &quot;The House Spirit&quot;, Section 1, he states:
In Section 2, he proceeds to elaborate:
==== George Henderson (1911) ====
George Henderson elaborated on the presumed origin of ancestor worship in animism:

<text>Paul Henry Pilgrim (October 26, 1883 – January 8, 1958) was an American runner. He competed at the 1904, 1906 and 1908 Olympics and won three gold medals in 1904 and 1906.

At the 1904 Summer Olympics, Pilgrim failed to complete the 400 m and 800 m events, and finished sixth in the four mile team run, aiding the New York Athletic Club (NYAC) to win the gold medal.

In 1906, Pilgrim traveled to Athens on his own, missing the wave that washed over the deck of the American team&#x27;s ship in Gibraltar. The wave injured about half-dozen athletes aboard the deck, including one of the favorites in the 400 m, Harry Hillman. Pilgrim advanced to the final in the 400 m, and was third before the final straight. On that stretch, he passed Wyndham Halswelle of Great Britain and Nigel Barker of Australia to win in time of 53.2 seconds. In the 800 m, Pilgrim passed James Lightbody on the final lap and won by two feet. This medal does not appear in results or tables published by the International Olympic Committee, which retroactively downgraded the 1906 Summer Olympics and does not consider them to have been true &quot;Games of the Olympiad.&quot;

Following his success in 1906 Pilgrim never won a major competition. At the 1908 Summer Olympics he failed to reach the final of the 400 m event. He worked the rest of his career at NYAC, where he served as Athletic Director from 1914 to 1953.

<text>Zagłębie Sosnowiec () is a Polish professional football club based in Sosnowiec. They compete in II liga in the 2024–25 season, following relegation from the 2023–24 I liga.

The club was established in 1906. It won Polish Cup four times (1962, 1963, 1977, 1978), and also was four times Polish runner up (1955, 1964, 1967, 1972). Apart from football, the organization of Zagłębie has other departments, such as ice-hockey (KH Zagłębie Sosnowiec; five times Polish champion: 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985) and men&#x27;s basketball (twice Polish champion: 1985, 1986).

==History==
The history of Zagłębie Sosnowiec dates back to 1906, when the city of Sosnowiec belonged to Congress Poland, Russian Empire. In that year, a group of young workers of the Milowice Steelworks formed a sports organization. Their activities were mostly concentrated on playing football at suburban meadows. In 1908, local activist Aleksander Rene was arrested by the Okhrana, and accused of forming an illegal Polish sports organization. Imprisoned in Łódź, he sent a letter to a Russian Governor, who resided in Piotrków Trybunalski, asking for permission to form a Sosnowiec branch of the Union Sports Club from Sankt Petersburg. He was denied, so he wrote again, to the Union headquarters. With the permission of the Sankt Petersburg club, Rene, after leaving prison, formed the team of Union Sosnowiec, which in the first half of the 1910s played several friendly games against local teams.

During World War I, sports activities were cancelled in Sosnowiec. In 1918, Sports Association Victoria was formed. Among its players was famous singer Jan Kiepura. In 1919, Sports Association Sosnowiec was formed by Aleksander Reine. After 12 years, in 1931, both clubs merged to create the team called Unia Sosnowiec. The new team was among the best sides in the region of Zagłębie Dąbrowskie, which in the 1930s had its own regional league, the Zagłębie A-Class.

In 1933, Unia Sosnowiec won the league, qualifying to the Ekstraklasa playoffs, where it lost to Naprzód Lipiny. In 1934, Unia again turned out to be the regional winner, and again it lost the playoffs, this time to Śląsk Świętochłowice. Third attempt at the Ekstraklasa promotion came in 1939. Again Unia, the regional champion, lost the playoffs to both Śląsk Świętochłowice and Fablok Chrzanów. Among the players of Unia&#x27;s youth teams was Wieslaw Ociepka, who later became chairman of the Polish Football Association (PZPN).

During World War II, Unia played unofficial, conspirational games against local rivals. In 1945, officials and players of Unia formed a team called RKS Sosnowiec, which was soon renamed into RKU Sosnowiec. Its chairman was Major Marian Rodza, military commandant of the city. First postwar manager was Józef Słonecki, who in the 1920s was a player of Pogoń Lwów. In 1946, RKU qualified to the Ekstraklasa playoffs. In the 1/8 finals, it beat Gedania Gdańsk 6–2, to lose 0–4 to AKS Chorzów in the quarterfinals. During the game, which took place in Chorzów, clashes erupted between supporters of both teams, and the game was cancelled. In 1947, RKU was in Group Two of the Ekstraklasa qualifiers. This group was won by AKS Chorzów, RKU was the fourth team, behind AKS, Cracovia and Rymer Radlin.

In 1949, after changing its name into Stal Sosnowiec, the team qualified to the Second Division, remaining there until 1954, when it was finally promoted to the Ekstraklasa. In the 1955 Ekstraklasa, Stal Sosnowiec was a sensation, as it was the runner up, finishing the season in the second spot, only behind CWKS Warsaw. Stal had 27 points, while CWKS had only one point more. In 1956, Stal was the 10th team (out of 12), in 1957, 7th, and was relegated in 1958, to return to the Ekstraklasa in 1960. Stal remained in the top league until 1974, finishing as the runners-up thrice (1964, 1967, 1972).

Meanwhile, in 1962, Stal changed name into GKS Zagłębie . In the mid-1960s, the team from Sosnowiec was among the best Polish sides, as it once won Polish silver, three times bronze, and two times the Polish Cup: in 1962, after beating 2-1 Górnik Zabrze, and in 1963, after beating 2–0 Ruch Chorzów. In 1964, Józef Gałeczka was Ekstraklasa&#x27;s top scorer. Among other notable players of that time was Andrzej Jarosik, twice Polish top scorer (1970, 1971). Furthermore, Włodzimierz Mazur was the top scorer in 1977.

In 1977 and 1978, Zagłębie twice won the Polish Cup, and in 1979, Wojciech Rudy was named Best Polish Player of the Year.

In 1986, Zagłębie, after 11 years, was relegated to the Second Division. It remained there until June 1989, when Zagłębie returned to the Ekstraklasa. Among its top players were Marek Bęben, Ryszard Czerwiec and Maciej Mizia. After promotion, the games of Zagłębie were attended by thousands of people, with the record, 28,000, watching the match against Górnik Zabrze.
After the 1991 season, Zagłębie avoided relegation in the playoffs, in which it beat Jagiellonia Białystok 0–2, 2–0, and 4–2 in the penalty shootout. In 1992, Zagłębie was relegated, even though among its players was Marek Koniarek. Due to financial problems, the team was soon relegated to the third level. The club was then dissolved.

In 1995, Zagłębie returned in the 5th division, and soon qualified to the fourth, and then third division. In 2000, Zagłębie won promotion to the second level. In 2001, with a new Italian sponsor ERGOM, Zagłębie planned to win promotion back to the top league. Instead, the team was relegated.

In 2004, Zagłębie won promotion to the Second Division. Finally, after the 2006–07 season, Zagłębie returned to the Ekstraklasa. Among its top players were Jacek Berensztajn, Jakub Wierzchowski and Adrian Mierzejewski. The 2007–08 Ekstraklasa season was a failure, as Zagłębie gathered only 16 points, and was relegated again. Among its players at that time was Patryk Małecki.

<text>Vigorish (also known as juice, under-juice, the cut, the take, the margin, the house edge or the vig) is the fee charged by a bookmaker for accepting a gambler&#x27;s wager. In American English, it can also refer to the interest owed a loanshark in consideration for credit. The term came to English usage via Yiddish slang () which was itself a loanword from Russian ().

As a business practice it is an example of risk management; by doing so bookmakers can guarantee turning a profit regardless of the underlying event&#x27;s outcome. As a rule, bookmakers do not want to have a financial interest creating a preference for one result over another in any given sporting event. This is accomplished by incentivizing their clientele to wager offsetting amounts on all potential outcomes of the event. The normal method by which this is achieved is by adjusting the payouts for each outcome (collectively called the line) as imbalances of total amounts wagered between them occur.

Within the mathematical disciplines of probability and statistics this is analogous to an overround, though the two are not synonymous but are related by the connecting formulae below. Over round occurs when the sum of the implied probabilities for all possible event results is above 100%, whereas the vigorish is the bookmaker&#x27;s percentage profit on the total stakes made on the event. For example, an overround of 20% results in 16.% vigorish. The connecting formulae are
:formula_1
where represents vigorish and represents over round.

== Proportionality ==

It is simplest to assume that vigorish is factored in proportionally to the true odds, although this need not be the case. Under proportional vigorish, a &quot;fair odds&quot; betting line of 2.00/2.00 without vigorish would decrease the payouts of all outcomes equally, perhaps to 1.95/1.95, once it was added. More commonly though, disproportional vigorish will be applied as part of the efforts to keep the amounts wagered balanced, such as 1./2.00, making the outcome with fewer dollars wagered appear more attractive due to the larger payout.

== Example ==

In the context of betting, two individuals may choose to place a wager on opposite outcomes of an event, agreeing on &quot;fair odds&quot; or evens. This arrangement involves each party risking an equal amount, such as $100, with the potential to win the same amount. The arrangement is made directly between the individuals, bypassing a bookmaker. Consequently, the winner is entitled to the total amount staked by both parties, while the loser forfeits their stake. This direct betting approach implies that both parties accept the counterparty risk, acknowledging the possibility that the losing party may not honor the payment upon the event&#x27;s conclusion, a risk typically mitigated by a bookmaker through the payment of vigorish. 

When using a sportsbook with the odds set at 1./2.00 (10 to 11) with vigorish factored in, each person would have to risk or lay $110 to win $100 (the sportsbook collects $220 &quot;in the pot&quot;). The extra $10 per person is, in effect, a bookmaker&#x27;s commission for taking the action. This $10 is not in play and cannot be doubled by the winning bettor; it can only be lost. A losing bettor simply loses his $110. A winning bettor wins back his original $110, plus his $100 winnings, for a total of $210. From the $220 collected, the sportsbook keeps the remaining $10 after paying out the winner.

== Theory versus practice ==

Vigorish can be defined independent of the outcome of the event and of bettors&#x27; behaviors, by defining it as the percentage of total dollars wagered retained by the bookmaker in a risk-free wager. This definition is largely theoretical in practice as it makes the assumption that the bookmaker has balanced the wagers perfectly, such that they make equal profit regardless of the contest result.

For a two-outcome event, the vigorish percentage, v is

: formula_2

where the p and q are the decimal payouts for each outcome.
This should not be confused with the percentage a bettor pays due to vigorish. No consistent definition of the percentage a bettor pays due to vigorish can be made without first defining the bettor&#x27;s behavior under juiced odds and assuming a win-percentage for the bettor. These factors are discussed under the debate section.

For example, 1./2.00 pricing of an even match is 4.55% vigorish, and 1.95/1.95 pricing is 2.38% vigorish.

Vigorish percentage for three-way events may be calculated using the following formula:

: formula_3

where , and are the decimal payouts for each outcome. For comparison, for over round calculation only the upper part of the equation is used, leading to slightly higher percentage results than the vigorish calculation.

== Other kinds of vigorish ==

=== Casino games ===
More generically, vigorish can refer to the bookmaker/casino&#x27;s theoretical advantage from all possible wagers on any game they offer. The term may also refer, and be applied in specific ways, to particular casino games.
* Baccarat, in the house-banked version of baccarat (also mini-baccarat) commonly played in North American casinos, vigorish refers to the 5% commission (called the &quot;cagnotte&quot;) charged to players who win a bet on the banker hand. The rules of the game are structured so that the banker hand wins slightly more often than the player hand; the 5% vigorish restores the house advantage to the casino for both bets. In most casinos, a winning banker bet is paid at even money, with a running count of the commission owed kept by special markers in a commission box in front of the dealer. This commission must be paid when all the cards are dealt from the shoe or when the player leaves the game. Some casinos do not keep a running commission amount, and instead withdraw the commission directly from the winnings; a few require the commission to be posted along with the bet, in a separate space on the table.
* Backgammon, the recube vig is the value of having possession of the doubling cube to the player being offered a double.
* Craps, vigorish refers to the 5% commission charged on a buy bet, where a player wishes to bet that one of the numbers — 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 — will be rolled before a 7 is rolled. The commission is charged at the rate of $1 for every $20 bet. The bet is paid off at the true mathematical odds, but the 5% commission is paid as well, restoring the house advantage. For many years, this commission was paid whether the bet won or not. In recent years, many casinos have changed to charging the commission only when the bet wins, which greatly reduces the house advantage; for instance, the house advantage on a buy bet on the 4 or 10 is reduced from 5% to 1.67%, since the bet wins one-third of the time (2:1 odds against). In this case, the vig may be deducted from the winnings (for instance, a $20 bet on the 4 would be paid $39 – $40 at 2:1 odds, less the $1 commission), or the player may simply hand the commission in and receive the full payout. This rule is commonplace in Mississippi casinos, and becoming more widely available in Nevada.
* Roulette: odds are calculated out of 36 numbers, but the wheel has one or two extra pockets (zero and double zero).
* Slot machines - the payouts and winning combinations available on most slot machines and other electronic gambling systems are often designed such that an average of between 0.1% to 10% (varying by machine and facility) of funds taken in are not used to pay out winnings, and thus becomes the house&#x27;s share. Machines or facilities with a particularly low percentage are often said to be loose.
* Poker
** In pai gow poker, a 5% commission charged on all winning bets is referred to as vigorish. Unlike baccarat, the commission is paid after each winning bet, either by the player handing in the amount from his stack of chips, or by having the vig deducted from the winnings.
**In table poker, the vigorish, more commonly called the rake, is a fraction of each bet placed into the pot. The dealer removes the rake from the pot after each bet (or betting round), making change if necessary. The winner of the hand gets the money that remains in the pot after the rake has been removed. Most casinos take 5-10% of the pot, typically capping the total rake at $3 or $4.

===Other uses===

* In investment banking, &quot;vig&quot; is sometimes used to describe profits from advisory and other activities.
* In sports, Pittsburgh Pirates announcer Bob Prince coined the term &quot;hidden vigorish&quot; to describe an underdog&#x27;s ability to beat the odds in a given situation.
* The term is also used in reference to an auction house&#x27;s buyers and sellers fees.

<text>Stal Rzeszów is a Polish football club based in Rzeszów, Poland, as part of a multi-sports club. They currently compete in the I liga, the second tier of Polish league football.

== History ==

The history of Stal Rzeszów dates back to November 1944, when a group of sports enthusiasts, working at &quot;WSK PZL Rzeszów&quot; (&quot;Transport Equipment Enterprise&quot;) decided to form a &quot;Sports Circle&quot;. With support of the &quot;Youth Organization of the Association of Workers University&quot; (&quot;Organizacja Mlodziezy Towarzystwa Uniwersytetu Robotniczego, OM TUR&quot;), the new club was managed by Bronislaw Szczoczarz.

In March 1945, football team of &quot;PZL OM TUR&quot; was formed, under manager Jan Polak. In its first game, OM TUR faced &quot;Szturmowiec (Walter) Rzeszów&quot;, the match ended in a 2–2 draw. By the summer of 1945, OM TUR played several friendly games, facing Sokol Rzeszów (4–6), Czuwaj Lancut (2–6), and in June 1945, it played in the City of Rzeszów Cup tournament, losing in the final 1–3 to Resovia.

In the autumn of 1946, a series of playoffs took place, in order to find best teams for the newly created &quot;Rzeszów A-Class&quot;. PZL OM TUR managed to qualify to the league, together with such teams, as Legia Krosno, Nafta Krosno, Orzel Gorlice, Sanoczanka, Cukrownia Przeworsk, Resovia, Sokol Rzeszów, Czuwaj Przemysl and Polonia Przemysl. By 1955, however, the team did not have its own field, and had to use the fields of other clubs. On 26 June 1955, the first game took place at the newly built PZL Rzeszów stadium, at Hetmanska Street. The reserve team of Poland B faced Bulgarian reserves (1–1). In the second game of the day, Stal Rzeszów, the host, tied 1–1 with Poland U-19 team.

On 15 February 1948 the name of the club was changed into &quot;Union Sports Club of Metal Workers PZL Rzeszów&quot; (&quot;Zwiakzkowy Klub Sportowy Metalowców PZL w Rzeszowie&quot;). The club was overseen by the &quot;Central Union of Metal Workers&quot;, based in Katowice. By 1949, PZL Rzeszów had six departments: boxing (since 1944), football (since 1945), track and field (since 1945), chess (since 1947), table tennis (since 1948), speedway (since 1949). Finally, in May 1949, the name of the club was changed into &quot;Union Sports Club&quot; (&quot;Zakładowy Klub Sportowy&quot;) Stal Rzeszów.

In 1953, Stal qualified to the semifinal of the Polish Cup, where it lost 3–4 to AKS Chorzów. In 1956, Stal won regional games of Rzeszów League (III level of Polish football tier), qualifying to the Second Division playoffs, where it faced Piast Gliwice (2–2, 1–0), and Arkonia Szczecin (0–2, 2–0)

After the promotion, several players joined Stal for the upcoming 1957/58 season of the Second Division. Before the games, Polish Football Association decided to form two groups of the second level. Stal was in Group South, among such sides, as Cracovia, Garbarnia Kraków, Wawel Kraków, Piast Gliwice, Concordia Knurow, Bron Radom, Stal Mielec, AKS Chelmek, Naprzod Lipiny, Szombierki Bytom, AKS Chorzów.

In its first game, Stal faced Szombierki, beating the opponent 2–1. After the first round, Stal was in the 8th position, and after the whole season, Stal had 22 points, with goals 40–30, which made it the 6th team of the group. 
In mid-1958, Tadeusz Hogendorf became new manager of Stal. By the end of the season, Stal was very lucky to avoid relegation. In 1960, Stal was 8th; in 1961, 5th; and in 1962, 9th. Before the 1962 season, PZPN divided the Second Division into two groups: A and B. Stal was in Group A, which consisted of 8 teams (Unia Racibórz, Unia Tarnów, Naprzód Lipiny, Piast Gliwice, MZKS Krosno, Polonia Bydgoszcz, Slavia Ruda Slaska), and won the games, qualifying to the Ekstraklasa. The decisive game took place on 21 June 1962 in Rzeszów, vs. Piast Gliwice. With the attendance of 25,000, Stal won 2–1.

In July 1962, Stal went on a summer camp in Finland. First Ekstraklasa game took place on 12 August 1962: Stal lost 0–1 at home to Lechia Gdańsk. In the second game, Stal lost in Kraków to Wisła Kraków (0–2). First, historic victory took place in the third round, when Stal beat at home 3–0 ŁKS Łódź.

Stal remained in the Ekstraklasa for ten years, until 1972. It was regarded as an average team, without major successes. Its top player at that time was Jan Domarski, who capped for Poland 17 times.
In 2012 a joint-stock company was established which took over the original club. Stal played in the II liga. From April 2018, the main sponsor of the team is Fibrain – a Polish manufacturer of fiber optic solutions.

On 27 April 2022 Stal gained promotion to the I liga following Ruch Chorzów&#x27;s draw against Wisła Puławy. On 1 May 2022, after a 4–1 away win against Pogoń Siedlce, Stal secured the II liga title with 3 games left.

<text>Hugues Aubriot (born 13XX in Dijon; died c. 1391 in Dijon) was a French administrator and heretic. Aubriot was Provost of Paris under Charles V. He built the Bastille in 1370-1383. He was a capable administrator who built the first sewers in Paris, and strengthened the city&#x27;s fortifications. He was on very poor terms with both the Church, and the University of Paris, which was dominated by the Clergy. During the course of disturbances, in Paris, after the death of Charles V in 1380, he arrested citizens who had harassed the city&#x27;s Jews. For this, he was placed on trial, and a variety of trumped-up charges were brought against him, including heresy, sodomy, and extortion. However, he was a strong supporter of Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, who was able to prevent him from being executed. He was instead sentenced to life imprisonment on bread and water. In subsequent disturbances in Paris, he was released by a mob who were rioting against excessive taxation, and sought his support. Prudently, he took the opportunity to flee from the city of Bastille after that.

==Overview==
In Basara&#x27;s post-apocalyptic setting, Japan has been controlled by a succession of corrupt and oppressive rulers of Saffron Clan. The current one is the Golden Emperor, a sovereign so obsessed with maintaining his power that he has had most of his children killed. He later appointed territories to the remaining children, allowing them to rule as subordinate kings and expend their energies in rivalries among each other, instead of trying to dethrone him. As a result, most of the Kings neglect the people they rule.

Though the peasants have been downtrodden for decades, they have not completely lost their rebellious spirit. Four swords named for the gods of the Four Symbols—Byakko, Suzaku, Seiryū and Genbu—forged for fallen rebel leaders two generations past, are the symbols of underground resistance groups across Japan. The sword of Byakko is kept in Byakko Village, and according to a prophet, a child of fate who will lead a revolution will be born there. When twins are born—a girl and a boy—the prophet says that one of them is the child of destiny. Villagers believe the boy, Tatara, is the child of destiny, but ultimately the girl, Sarasa, is the leader. When the local ruler, the Red King, destroys her village and has her brother beheaded, she assumes his name and duty to lead her people in rebellion.

Sarasa undergoes psychological strain over having to pretend to be a boy. As such, she often visits hot springs to &quot;let her hair down.&quot; During these visits, she runs into a mysterious young man named Shuri, and they fall in love with each other.

Unknown to Sarasa, Shuri is really the Red King, upon whom she has sworn revenge for destroying her village and killing her family. The Red King is likewise unaware that Sarasa, in her alter ego, is the rebel leader he is trying to kill. As the story progresses, the pair&#x27;s relationship deepens even as their struggle becomes more bloody.

==The fans==

Śląsk fans are one of the largest supporter movements in Poland. In the early 1970s, they were one of the pioneers of football supporters groups. The Śląsk supporters call themselves Nobles from Wrocław (). Notable Śląsk fans include: Waldemar Kasta, a rapper and ring announcer KSW, that also created fan songs for Śląsk, Hubert Hurkacz, a Polish tennis player. 

===Friendships===
They have a friendship with Lechia Gdańsk with which the two clubs fans have had a friendship since 1977, and have had friendly relations since 1967. This is the oldest fan friendship in Polish football. During the 2017–18 season, the two sets of fans celebrated their 40th Friendship Anniversary. Games between the two are often called &quot;the friendship match&quot;.

The fans have also had a friendship with Motor Lublin dating back to the 1990s. Due to the clubs&#x27; long friendship, Śląsk were invited to play a friendly in 2015 in Lublin to celebrate Motor&#x27;s 65th anniversary.

Despite the clubs&#x27; close proximity, Śląsk also hold friendly relations with Miedź Legnica. The fans also have friendships with fans from both SFC Opava, from the Czech Republic, and Ferencvárosi TC, from Hungary.

===Rivals===
Their biggest rivals are Zagłębie Lubin, with the games between the two known as the &quot;Lower Silesian Derby&quot; (Polish: Derby Dolnego Śląska). The two teams are the largest in the Lower Silesia region, with Śląsk representing Wrocław (the capital of Lower Silesia) and Zagłębie representing Lubin, a traditionally industrial and copper mining city. Both teams have won the twice, Śląsk in 1977 &amp; 2012, and Zagłębie in 1991 &amp; 2007. They also hold a big rivalry with Legia Warsaw, due to both clubs having military roots. There also is a rivalry with Widzew Łódź, traditionally only due to competitive reasons, however, after the murder of a 17 year old Śląsk fan by a group of Widzew hooligans in Walichnowy, the rivalry became more heated than ever, and it still holds this status.

The fans of Lechia and Śląsk formally had a friendship with the Wisła Kraków fans, creating the &quot;Three Kings of Great Cities&quot; () coalition. Wisła fans left the coalition in 2016. Since 2016 Wisła Kraków itself has since turned into a rivalry.

Arka Gdynia, Lech Poznań and Cracovia are rivals dating back to the time with their alliance with Wisła. This was due to the two largest fan coalitions in Poland, &quot;Three Kings of Great Cities&quot; (Śląsk, Lechia, Wisła) and &quot;The Great Triad&quot; (Lech, Arka, Cracovia) with any of the opposite coalition teams playing each other resulting in a big and hotly contested match.

==Stadium==

The Wrocław Stadium is the highest fourth category football (soccer) stadium built for the 2012 UEFA European Football Championship. The Stadium is located on aleja Śląska in the western part of the city (Pilczyce district). It is the home stadium of the Śląsk Wrocław football team playing in the Polish PKO Ekstraklasa. The stadium has a capacity of 42,771 spectators, all seated and all covered. The Municipal Stadium in Wroclaw is the largest arena in Ekstraklasa and the third largest in the country (after National Stadium and Silesia Stadium). Stadium construction began in April 2009 and was completed in September 2011. Stadium opening took place at 10 September 2011 with boxing fight between Tomasz Adamek and Vitali Klitschko for WBC heavyweight title. The inaugural football match was held on 10 October 2011, between Śląsk Wrocław and Lechia Gdańsk. Śląsk won 1–0, with Johan Voskamp becoming the first goalscorer on the new stadium.

<doc id="772150" wikidata="Q8214677" url="?curid=772150" title="Degenerate bilinear form">
<text>In mathematics, specifically linear algebra, a degenerate bilinear form on a vector space &quot;V&quot; is a bilinear form such that the map from &quot;V&quot; to &quot;V&quot;∗ (the dual space of &quot;V&quot;&amp;hairsp;) given by is not an isomorphism. An equivalent definition when &quot;V&quot; is finite-dimensional is that it has a non-trivial kernel: there exist some non-zero &quot;x&quot; in &quot;V&quot; such that

:formula_1 for all formula_2

==Nondegenerate forms==
A nondegenerate or nonsingular form is a bilinear form that is not degenerate, meaning that formula_3 is an isomorphism, or equivalently in finite dimensions, if and only if
:formula_4 for all formula_5 implies that formula_6.

The most important examples of nondegenerate forms are inner products and symplectic forms. Symmetric nondegenerate forms are important generalizations of inner products, in that often all that is required is that the map formula_7 be an isomorphism, not positivity. For example, a manifold with an inner product structure on its tangent spaces is a Riemannian manifold, while relaxing this to a symmetric nondegenerate form yields a pseudo-Riemannian manifold.

==Using the determinant==
If &quot;V&quot; is finite-dimensional then, relative to some basis for &quot;V&quot;, a bilinear form is degenerate if and only if the determinant of the associated matrix is zero – if and only if the matrix is &quot;singular&quot;, and accordingly degenerate forms are also called singular forms. Likewise, a nondegenerate form is one for which the associated matrix is non-singular, and accordingly nondegenerate forms are also referred to as non-singular forms. These statements are independent of the chosen basis.

==Related notions==
If for a quadratic form &quot;Q&quot; there is a non-zero vector &quot;v&quot; ∈ &quot;V&quot; such that &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;v&quot;) = 0, then &quot;Q&quot; is an isotropic quadratic form. If &quot;Q&quot; has the same sign for all non-zero vectors, it is a definite quadratic form or an anisotropic quadratic form.

There is the closely related notion of a unimodular form and a perfect pairing; these agree over fields but not over general rings.

==Examples==
The study of real, quadratic algebras shows the distinction between types of quadratic forms. The product &quot;zz&quot;* is a quadratic form for each of the complex numbers, split-complex numbers, and dual numbers. For &quot;z&quot; = &quot;x&quot; + ε &quot;y&quot;, the dual number form is &quot;x&quot;2 which is a degenerate quadratic form. The split-complex case is an isotropic form, and the complex case is a definite form.

The most important examples of nondegenerate forms are inner products and symplectic forms. Symmetric nondegenerate forms are important generalizations of inner products, in that often all that is required is that the map formula_7 be an isomorphism, not positivity. For example, a manifold with an inner product structure on its tangent spaces is a Riemannian manifold, while relaxing this to a symmetric nondegenerate form yields a pseudo-Riemannian manifold.

==Infinite dimensions==
Note that in an infinite-dimensional space, we can have a bilinear form ƒ for which formula_3 is injective but not surjective. For example, on the space of continuous functions on a closed bounded interval, the form 
:formula_10 
is not surjective: for instance, the Dirac delta functional is in the dual space but not of the required form. On the other hand, this bilinear form satisfies 
:formula_11 for all formula_12 implies that formula_13
In such a case where ƒ satisfies injectivity (but not necessarily surjectivity), ƒ is said to be &quot;weakly nondegenerate&quot;.

==Terminology==
If &quot;f&quot; vanishes identically on all vectors it is said to be totally degenerate. Given any bilinear form &quot;f&quot; on &quot;V&quot; the set of vectors

:formula_14

forms a totally degenerate subspace of &quot;V&quot;. The map &quot;f&quot; is nondegenerate if and only if this subspace is trivial.

Geometrically, an isotropic line of the quadratic form corresponds to a point of the associated quadric hypersurface in projective space. Such a line is additionally isotropic for the bilinear form if and only if the corresponding point is a singularity. Hence, over an algebraically closed field, Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz guarantees that the quadratic form always has isotropic lines, while the bilinear form has them if and only if the surface is singular.

<text>Idiom Neutral is an international auxiliary language, published in 1902 by the International Academy of the Universal Language () under the leadership of Waldemar Rosenberger, a St. Petersburg engineer.

== History ==
The Academy had its origin as the (literally &#x27;International Academy of the World Language&#x27;) at a congress in Munich in August 1887, was set up to conserve and perfect the auxiliary language Volapük. Under Rosenberger, who became the Academy’s director in 1892, the group began to make considerable changes in the grammar and vocabulary of Volapük, changing its nature into an entirely different language. The vocabulary was almost completely replaced by words more closely resembling those used in Western European languages, and a number of grammatical forms unfamiliar to Western Europeans were discarded. It was understood that the changes effectively resulted in the creation of a new language, which was named (which means “the neutral idiom” or “the neutral language”).

The name of the Academy was changed to in 1898 and the circulars of the Academy were written in the new language from that year. Those who continued to use Volapük re-formed the International Academy of Volapük, retaining its name (with a spelling change) as &quot;Kadäm Bevünetik Volapüka&quot;.

Dictionaries of Idiom Neutral including an outline of the grammar were published in several European languages in 1902 and 1903.

The language, sometimes referred to as “Neutral” or “the Neutral language” by English-speaking writers, created interest among international language enthusiasts at the time. Rosenberger published a periodical in the language called . In 1907 Neutral was one of the projects considered by a committee of scholars which met in Paris to select an international auxiliary language (what the committee actually decided upon is disputed; see Ido and its external links for more information).

In 1908 the which had created Idiom Neutral effectively chose to abandon it in favor of Latino sine flexione, a simplified form of Latin developed by Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano. Peano was appointed the director of the , and its name was changed to . Peano&#x27;s language was also called , not to be confused with the better-known Interlingua presented in 1951 by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA).
In 1912 Rosenberger published a reformed version of Neutral called .

== Grammar ==

The following is a rough sketch of Idiom Neutral grammar. It does not lay out every detail of grammar worked out for the language. The simple grammar of Idiom Neutral is similar to Interlingua&#x27;s.

=== Writing and pronunciation ===
Twenty-two letters of the Latin script are used to write Neutral; the letters q, w, x, and z do not occur. The five vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are pronounced roughly as in Spanish. Vowels which appear next to each other are pronounced separately, not as a diphthong. The consonants have the same values as in English, except that c is pronounced like English &quot;ch&quot; in &quot;church&quot;, g is always like the &quot;g&quot; in &quot;gate&quot;, and j is pronounced as the &quot;s&quot; in &quot;measure&quot;. The combination sh is pronounced like English &quot;sh&quot;.

The stress falls on the vowel that precedes the last consonant. If no vowel precedes the last consonant (e.g. via &quot;way&quot;) the stress is on the first vowel. In a few cases the vowel at the end of a word is stressed; these vowels are marked with an acute accent (e.g. idé &quot;idea&quot;). Such accents are the only diacritics used in writing Neutral words.

===Nouns and adjectives===

Unlike Esperanto and Ido, nouns can end in any letter. There is no inflection for case. The plural is formed by adding the letter i at the end of the word.

Adjectives can also end in any letter. They normally appear after the nouns they modify and do not agree in number with their nouns, e.g. kaset grand &quot;big box&quot;, kaseti grand &quot;big boxes&quot;.

Comparison of adjectives (and adverbs) is with plu ... ka (&quot;more ... than&quot;), tale ... kuale (&quot;as ... as&quot;) and leplu (&quot;most, -est&quot;).

===Verbs===

Verbs are conjugated as follows. Examples are shown for the verb amar &quot;to love&quot; in the active voice; the endings do not change for person or number, except in the imperative.

Infinitive: amar &quot;to love&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Present: mi am &quot;I love&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Imperfect: mi amav &quot;I loved, I was loving&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Future: mi amero &quot;I shall love&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Present perfect: mi av amed &quot;I have loved&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Pluperfect: mi avav amed &quot;I had loved&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Future perfect: mi avero amed &quot;I shall have loved&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Conditional: mi amerio &quot;I would love&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Past conditional: mi averio amed &quot;I would have loved&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Imperative second person singular: ama! &quot;Love!&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Imperative second person plural: amate! &quot;Love!&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Imperative first person plural: amam! &quot;Let&#x27;s love!&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Active participle: amant &quot;loving&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Passive participle: amed &quot;loved&quot;

The passive voice is formed with the verb esar &quot;to be&quot; and the passive participle: mi es amed &quot;I am loved&quot;, mi averio esed amed &quot;I would have been loved&quot;, etc.

There is no inflection for a subjunctive or volitive. In expressions of desire etc., the present tense is used e.g. mi volu ke il am &quot;I want him to love&quot;; ila demandav ke vo lekt it &quot;she asked you to read it&quot;.

===Other parts of speech===

There is no definite or indefinite article. Adverbs can be formed from adjectives by adding e. Some prepositions are formed from other words by adding u e.g. relativu &quot;relative to&quot; from relativ &quot;relative&quot; (adj.).

== Sample texts ==

:The apparatus must be addressed to the chief of the St. Petersburg station and must be insured by you and by your account; if the apparatus or parts of them are ruined or lost in the voyage, you must send others immediately in place of the apparatus and parts ruined or lost.

:The publication of Idiom Neutral will interest your son, who collects postage stamps, because this idiom is a practical language for correspondence with collectors in other countries.

<doc id="772173" wikidata="Q11666" url="?curid=772173" title="Maria Sharapova">
<text>Maria Yuryevna Sharapova (, ; born 19 April 1987) is a Russian former professional tennis player. She was ranked as the world No. 1 in women&#x27;s singles by the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA) for 21 weeks. Sharapova won 36 WTA Tour-level singles titles, including five major titles, as well as the 2004 WTA Tour Championships. She is one of ten women to achieve the career Grand Slam in singles. Sharapova is one of the most successful players of her generation.

A teen sensation, Sharapova broke through to the top of the sport by winning the 2004 Wimbledon Championships as a 17-year-old, upsetting two-time defending champion Serena Williams. She then won the 2004 Tour Finals, and became the world No. 1 for the first time in August 2005 at the age of 18, the first Russian woman to top the singles rankings. Continued success over the following years, including titles at the 2006 US Open and 2008 Australian Open, was accompanied by recurring injuries, and Sharapova dipped in and out of the top 10 around the turn of the decade. After a career-long struggle with success on clay courts, Sharapova claimed the 2012 French Open to complete the career Grand Slam, briefly returning to the No. 1 position, and shortly after won an Olympic silver medal in women&#x27;s singles at the 2012 London Olympics. She won a second French Open title in 2014 for her fifth major championship.

Sharapova failed a drug test at the 2016 Australian Open, testing positive for meldonium, a substance that had been banned (effective 1 January 2016) by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). On 8 June 2016, she was suspended from playing tennis for two years by the International Tennis Federation (ITF). On 4 October 2016, the suspension was reduced to 15 months, starting from the date of the failed test, as the Court of Arbitration for Sport found that she had committed &quot;no significant fault&quot; and that she had taken the substance &quot;based on a doctor&#x27;s recommendation... with good faith belief that it was appropriate and compliant with the relevant rules&quot;. She returned to the WTA Tour in April 2017 at the Stuttgart Open. Sharapova retired from the sport in 2020.

Sharapova has been featured in a number of modeling assignments, including a feature in the &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot;. She has appeared in many advertisements, including those for Nike, Prince, and Canon, and has been the face of several fashion houses, most notably Cole Haan. Since February 2007, she has been a United Nations Development Programme Goodwill Ambassador, concerned specifically with the Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme. In June 2011, she was named one of the &quot;30 Legends of Women&#x27;s Tennis: Past, Present and Future&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; and in March 2012 was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest of All Time&quot; by Tennis Channel. According to Forbes, she was the highest-paid female athlete in the world for 11 consecutive years and earned 285 million (including prize money) since she turned professional in 2001. In 2018, she launched a new program to mentor women entrepreneurs.
==Early life==
Maria Yuryevna Sharapova was born on 19 April 1987, in Nyagan, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union. Her parents, Yuri Sharapov and Yelena, are from Gomel, Byelorussian SSR. Concerned about the regional effects of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident, they left their hometown shortly before Maria was born.

===Introduction to tennis===
In 1990, when Sharapova was three, the family moved to Sochi, Russia. Her father, Yuri, befriended Aleksandr Kafelnikov, whose son Yevgeny would go on to win two Grand Slam singles titles and become Russia&#x27;s first world No. 1 ranked tennis player. Aleksandr gave Sharapova her first tennis racquet in 1991 when she was four, whereupon she began practicing regularly with her father at a local park. Maria took her first tennis lessons with veteran Russian coach Yuri Yutkin, who was instantly impressed when he saw her play, noting her &quot;exceptional hand-eye coordination&quot;.

===Start of professional training===
In 1993, at the age of six, Sharapova attended a tennis clinic in Moscow run by Martina Navratilova, who recommended professional training with Nick Bollettieri at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida. Bollettieri had previously trained players such as Andre Agassi, Monica Seles, and Anna Kournikova. With money tight, Yuri Sharapov borrowed the sum that would enable him and his daughter, neither of whom could speak English, to travel to the United States, which they did in 1994. Visa restrictions prevented Sharapova&#x27;s mother from joining them for two years. Arriving in Florida with savings of US$700, Sharapova&#x27;s father took various low-paying jobs to fund her lessons until she was old enough to be admitted to the academy. Initially, she trained with Rick Macci. In 1995, however, she was signed by IMG, which agreed to pay the annual tuition fee of $35,000 for Sharapova to stay at the academy, allowing her to finally enroll at the age of 9.

==Tennis career==
===Junior and early career===
Sharapova first hit tennis fame in November 2000, when she won the Eddie Herr International Junior Tennis Championships in the girls&#x27; 16 division at the age of just 13. She was then given a special distinction, the Rising Star Award, awarded to players of exceptional promise. Sharapova made her professional debut in 2001 on her 14th birthday on 19 April, and played her first WTA tournament at the Pacific Life Open in 2002, winning a match before losing to Monica Seles. Due to restrictions on how many professional events she could play, Sharapova went to hone her game in junior tournaments, where she reached the finals of the girls&#x27; singles events at the Australian Open and Wimbledon in 2002. She was the youngest girl ever to reach the final of the Australian Open junior championship at 14 years and 9 months.

Sharapova reached No. 6 in the ITF junior world singles ranking on 21 October 2002. In all, she won three junior singles tournaments and was runner-up at five, including two junior Grand Slam events. Her win–loss record in junior competition was 47–9. Her best results in the Junior Grand Slam tournaments were the finals of the 2002 Australian Open, finals of the 2002 Wimbledon Championships, third round of the 2002 French Open, and second round of the 2001 US Open.

===2003: First tournament titles===
From 2003, Sharapova played a full season and made a rapid climb into the top 50 by the end of the year. She made her debuts at both the Australian Open and the French Open, but failed to win a match in either. Then, as a wildcard at Wimbledon, she defeated 11th seed Jelena Dokić, her first win over a top-20 player, to reach the fourth round, where she lost in three sets to Svetlana Kuznetsova.
By the end of September, Sharapova had already captured her first WTA title at a smaller event, the Japan Open Tennis Championships, before winning her second in her final tournament of the season, the Bell Challenge in Quebec City. To cap off her first full season as a professional, she was awarded the WTA Newcomer of the Year honor.

===2004: Wimbledon glory and rise to fame===

Sharapova was defeated in the third round of the Australian Open by sixth seed Anastasia Myskina. She later reached the semifinals at the Cellular South Cup, where she lost to eventual champion Vera Zvonareva.

During the spring clay-court season, Sharapova entered the top 20 on the WTA world rankings as a result of reaching the third round of the Qatar Telecom German Open and the Internazionali BNL d&#x27;Italia, both of which were Tier I events. At the latter event, she defeated a player ranked in the top 10 for the first time with a straight-sets win over world No. 10 and 2004 French Open finalist Elena Dementieva. Later that clay-court season, she went on to make the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam for the first time at the French Open, losing there to Paola Suárez.
Sharapova won the third title of her career at the Wimbledon warm-up DFS Classic, defeating Tatiana Golovin in the final. Seeded 13th and aged 17 at Wimbledon, she reached her first Grand Slam semifinal by defeating Ai Sugiyama. There, she defeated fifth seed and former champion Lindsay Davenport. In the final, Sharapova upset top seed and defending champion Serena Williams to win her first Grand Slam singles title, and become the third-youngest woman to win the Wimbledon title, behind only Lottie Dod and Martina Hingis. Sharapova also became the second Russian woman (after Anastasia Myskina had won the year&#x27;s previous major at Roland Garros) to win a Grand Slam singles title. The victory was hailed by the media as &quot;the most stunning upset in memory&quot;, with other writers commenting on her arrival as a serious challenger to the Williams&#x27; dominance at Wimbledon. She entered the top 10 in the rankings for the first time as a result of the win.

Following her Wimbledon win, attention and interest in Sharapova in the media greatly increased, a rise in popularity dubbed &quot;Maria Mania.&quot; She won three of six matches in her preparations for the US Open. At the US Open itself, she reached the third round, before being eliminated by Mary Pierce. In order to regain confidence, Sharapova played and won consecutive titles in Asia in the fall, the Hansol Korea Open Tennis Championships and the Japan Open Tennis Championships.

In October, Sharapova defeated Venus Williams en route to making the final of a Tier I event for the first time at the Zurich Open, losing in the final to Alicia Molik. She then made her debut at the year-ending WTA Tour Championships. There, she won two of her three round-robin matches (including a win over US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova) in order to advance to the semifinals, where she defeated Myskina. In the final, she defeated an injured Serena Williams, after trailing 4–0 in the final set.

===2005: World No. 1===

Sharapova started the year at the Australian Open, where she defeated fifth seed Svetlana Kuznetsova to reach the second Grand Slam semifinal of her career. Sharapova held three match points in the third set of her semifinal match, before losing to eventual champion Serena Williams. In February, Sharapova won back-to-back tournaments, the Toray Pan Pacific Open and the Qatar Total Open, allowing her to reach number 3 in the world rankings for the first time.

In the semifinals of the Tier I Pacific Life Open, Sharapova was defeated by Lindsay Davenport, the first time she had failed to win a game in a match. She defeated former world No. 1 players Justine Henin and Venus Williams to reach the final at the Tier I NASDAQ-100 Open, where she lost to Kim Clijsters.

Sharapova made the semifinals of a clay-court tournament for the first time at the Italian Open, where she lost to Patty Schnyder. Sharapova would have become world No. 1 for the first time had she won the tournament. Sharapova then reached the quarterfinals of the French Open for the second consecutive year, before losing to eventual champion Henin. On grass, Sharapova won her third title of the year when she successfully defended her title at the DFS Classic, defeating Jelena Janković in the final. As the defending champion at Wimbledon, Sharapova reached the semifinals without dropping a set and losing a service game just once, extending her winning streak on grass to 24 matches. However, she was then beaten by eventual champion Venus Williams.

Sharapova had far fewer points to defend, and so she became the first Asian and Russian woman to hold the world No. 1 ranking on 22 August 2005. Her reign lasted only one week, however, as Davenport reclaimed the top ranking after winning the Pilot Pen Tennis tournament.

As the top seed at the US Open, Sharapova lost in the semifinals to Kim Clijsters, meaning she had lost to the eventual champion in every Grand Slam of the season. However, she once again leapfrogged Davenport to take the world No. 1 ranking on 12 September 2005. She retained it for six weeks, but after playing few tournaments while injured, she again relinquished the ranking to Davenport.

===2006: US Open champion===
Sharapova started 2006 by losing in the semifinals of the Australian Open in three sets to Henin, also losing a rematch several weeks later at the Dubai Tennis Championships, having defeated former world No. 1 Martina Hingis and world No. 3 Lindsay Davenport in earlier rounds of the tournament. Sharapova claimed her first title in nine months at the Tier I tournament in Indian Wells, defeating Hingis in the semifinals and Elena Dementieva in the final. She reached the final in Miami before losing to Kuznetsova.

Sharapova returned for the French Open. There, after saving match points in defeating Mashona Washington in the first round, she was eliminated by Dinara Safina in the fourth round. On grass, Sharapova was unsuccessful in her attempt to win in Birmingham for the third consecutive year, losing in the semifinals to Jamea Jackson. Despite that, she was among the title favorites at Wimbledon, where the eventual champion Mauresmo ended up beating her in the semifinals.

Sharapova claimed her second title of the year at the Tier I Acura Classic, defeating Clijsters for the first time in the final. As the third seed at the US Open, Sharapova defeated top seed Mauresmo for the first time in the semifinals, and then followed up by beating second seed Justine Henin to win her second Grand Slam singles title.

That autumn, Sharapova won titles in back-to-back weeks at the Zurich Open and the Generali Ladies Linz. By winning all three of her round-robin matches at the WTA Tour Championships, she extended her win streak to 19 matches, before it was snapped in the semifinals by eventual champion Henin. Sharapova would have finished the season as world No. 1 had she won the event. As it was, she finished ranked world No. 2, her best year-end finish yet.

===2007: Return to No. 1, shoulder injury and fall from the Top 5===
Sharapova was the top seed at the Australian Open due to top-ranked Justine Henin&#x27;s withdrawal. After being two points away from defeat in the first round against Camille Pin, she went on to reach the final of the tournament for the first time, but was routed there by Serena Williams who was ranked world No. 81 at the time. After reaching the final, Sharapova recaptured the world No. 1 ranking. She held it for seven weeks, surrendering it back to Henin after failing to defend her title at the Pacific Life Open, instead losing in the fourth round to Vera Zvonareva after struggling with a hamstring injury. The following fortnight, she defeated Venus Williams in the third round of the Sony Ericsson Open, before being beaten again by Serena Williams.

A shoulder injury forced Sharapova to miss most of the clay-court season for the second consecutive year, resulting in her only tune-up for the French Open being the İstanbul Cup, where she lost in the semifinals to Aravane Rezaï. She reached the semifinals of the French Open for the first time in her career, before losing to Ana Ivanovic. On grass, Sharapova was runner-up to Jelena Janković at the DFS Classic. Following that, she experienced her earliest Wimbledon loss since 2003 by losing in the fourth round to eventual champion Venus Williams.

Sharapova clinched the US Open Series by defending her title at the Acura Classic, her only championship of the year, and reaching the semifinals in Los Angeles. In her US Open title defense, Sharapova was upset in her third-round match by 30th seed Agnieszka Radwańska, making it her earliest exit at a Grand Slam singles tournament since the 2004 US Open, where she lost in the same round.

Following the US Open loss, Sharapova did not play again until the Kremlin Cup in October, where she lost her opening match to Victoria Azarenka. Shortly after this, she fell out of the top 5 in the world rankings for the first time since 2004. She qualified for the eight-woman year-end Sony Ericsson Championships because of a withdrawal by Venus Williams before the start of the tournament. Despite having not previously won a match in two months, Sharapova topped her round-robin group at the tournament, after winning all three of her matches, defeating Svetlana Kuznetsova, Ana Ivanovic, and Daniela Hantuchová. She then defeated Anna Chakvetadze in the semifinals. In the final, she lost to world No. 1 Henin in a match that lasted 3 hours and 24 minutes. Sharapova reached the top 5 again to end the year.

===2008: Australian Open champion, No. 1 and second shoulder injury===

Sharapova was seeded fifth at the Australian Open, but was not considered a favorite. Nevertheless, she defeated former world No. 1 Lindsay Davenport in the second round, and then world No. 1 Henin in the quarterfinals, ending the latter&#x27;s 32-match winning streak. She proceeded to the finals by defeating Jelena Janković in the semifinals, and defeated Ana Ivanovic in the final to win her third Grand Slam title, having not dropped a set all tournament.

After the Australian Open, Sharapova extended her winning streak to 18 matches. This run encompassed two wins including at the Tier I Qatar Open. Her winning streak was ended in the semifinals of the Pacific Life Open by Kuznetsova. In April, Sharapova won the Bausch &amp; Lomb Championships, having survived her longest-ever match, at 3 hours and 26 minutes long, in the third round against Anabel Medina Garrigues. The following week, at the Family Circle Cup, she lost in the quarterfinals to Serena Williams, her fourth consecutive loss to the American.

In May, Sharapova regained the world No. 1 ranking because of Henin&#x27;s sudden retirement from professional tennis and request to the WTA that her own ranking be removed immediately. As the top-seeded player at the French Open, Sharapova was within two points of being knocked out by Evgeniya Rodina in the first round, before eventually winning. As a result of losing to eventual finalist Dinara Safina in the fourth round (after serving for the match), she relinquished her No. 1 ranking. Her dip in form continued at Wimbledon, where she lost in the second round to world No. 154 Alla Kudryavtseva. This was her earliest loss at Wimbledon, and at any Grand Slam in almost five years.

Sharapova withdrew from the Rogers Cup tournament in August following a shoulder injury. An MRI scan revealed that she had been suffering from a rotator cuff tear since April, forcing her out of all tournaments for the rest of the season, including the Beijing Olympics, the US Open, and the WTA Tour Championships. In spite of that, she still finished the year ranked world No. 9. In October, after a failed attempt to rehabilitate the shoulder, Sharapova had surgery to repair the tear.

===2009–2010: Shoulder surgery, rehabilitation, comeback and struggles with form===

Sharapova did not attempt to defend her Australian Open title, as she continued to recover from surgery. She returned to the sport in March, in the doubles tournament at the Indian Wells Open, but she and partner Elena Vesnina lost in the first round. After this, Sharapova withdrew from further singles tournaments, resulting in her standing in the world rankings being severely affected. She dropped out of the top 100 for the first time in six years in May, the nadir being world No. 126.
Playing her first singles tournament in nearly ten months, Sharapova made the quarterfinals of the clay-court Warsaw Open in May, losing to finalist Alona Bondarenko. The following week, in her first Grand Slam appearance since her surgery, she reached the quarterfinals of the French Open, before her run was ended by Dominika Cibulková.

During the summer grass-court season, Sharapova played in Birmingham, losing in the semifinals to Li Na. Sharapova then played at Wimbledon as the 24th seed. She was upset in the second round by Gisela Dulko in three sets.

Sharapova enjoyed considerable success in the summer months, reaching the quarterfinals at the Bank of the West Classic, the semifinals at the LA Women&#x27;s Championships, and finishing runner-up at the Rogers Cup to Elena Dementieva. At the US Open, Sharapova was seeded 29th. She found her way into the third round, defeating Tsvetana Pironkova and Christina McHale, all in straight sets. She was stunned in the third round by American teenager Melanie Oudin. It was the second time in Sharapova&#x27;s career that she lost to a teenager at a Grand Slam tournament, having lost to Agnieszka Radwańska during the same event in 2007. The loss made Sharapova&#x27;s ranking go down to No. 32.

The final stretch of the season brought Sharapova her first title of the year in Tokyo, after opponent Jelena Janković retired after being down 2–5 to Sharapova in the final. By virtue of that result, she was the recipient of a bye at the China Open, but failed to capitalize on it, losing to Peng Shuai in the third round. She ultimately finished the season at world No. 14, having improved from No. 126 when she started her comeback from injury.
After playing two exhibition tournaments in Asia, Sharapova officially began her season at the Australian Open, where she was upset in her first-round match against Maria Kirilenko. The loss meant that for the first time since 2003, Sharapova had lost her opening match at a Grand Slam event. She then rebounded by winning a smaller American event, the Cellular South Cup, her 21st career WTA title and first of the year.

At the Indian Wells Open, Sharapova lost in the third round to Zheng Jie, aggravating a bruised bone on her right elbow in the process, which resulted in her eventual withdrawal from the Sony Ericsson Open and the Family Circle Cup.

Returning at the Madrid Open, Sharapova lost in the first round to Lucie Šafářová. She continued her French Open preparation at the Internationaux de Strasbourg as a wildcard, advancing to the final, where she beat Kristina Barrois. This was her first title on red clay and 22nd overall title. At the French Open, Sharapova&#x27;s brief clay season culminated with a third-round loss to four-time champion Justine Henin.

Sharapova began her preparations for Wimbledon at the Aegon Classic. She advanced to the final for the fourth time, where she lost to Li Na. As the 16th seed at Wimbledon, Sharapova lost in the fourth round to world No. 1 and eventual champion Serena Williams, despite having three set points in the opening set. The match was seen as another encouraging performance for Sharapova, with some stating their belief that she was approaching the form that would see her contending for Grand Slams once more, and Sharapova herself stating that she felt that she was &quot;in a much better spot than I was last year.&quot;

During the US Open Series, Sharapova made two straight finals, losing to Victoria Azarenka at the Bank of the West Classic, and to Kim Clijsters at the Western &amp; Southern Open. In the latter match, Sharapova held three match points while leading 5–3 on Clijsters&#x27;s serve late in the second set, but could not convert them. At the US Open, Sharapova was the 14th seed. She made it to the fourth round, where she played top seed and 2009 finalist Caroline Wozniacki and lost.

Sharapova&#x27;s last two tournaments of the season ended in disappointment. She played in the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, where she was upset in the first round by 39-year-old Kimiko Date-Krumm. Her last tournament of the year was the China Open, where she lost in the second round to fellow Russian Elena Vesnina. She ended the year at number 18 in the world.

===2011: Return to the top 10===
It was announced that Sharapova would bring in Thomas Högstedt as a coach for the 2011 season, joining Michael Joyce. On 5 December, Sharapova won an exhibition match against world No. 2 Vera Zvonareva in Monterrey, Mexico. In Sharapova&#x27;s first official Australian Open warm-up tournament at the Auckland Open, she was top-seeded. She lost to the Hungarian veteran and eventual champion, Gréta Arn, in the quarterfinals. After that, Sharapova decided to split up with Joyce, ending a successful cooperation that brought her two Grand Slam victories and the world No. 1 ranking.

Sharapova participated in the first Grand Slam of the season at the Australian Open, where she was the 14th seed, but lost to Andrea Petkovic in the fourth round. She also had to pull out of the Dubai Championships and the Qatar Open because of an ear infection. Sharapova returned to the tour in March by taking part in the 2011 BNP Paribas Open, where she was seeded 16th. She defeated former world No. 1, Dinara Safina, in the fourth round en route to the semifinal, where she lost to world No. 1, Caroline Wozniacki. At Key Biscayne, Sharapova defeated 26th seed Alexandra Dulgheru in the quarterfinals, in a match lasting 3 hours and 28 minutes. In the semifinals, Sharapova took her Australian Open reprisal on Andrea Petkovic by defeating her. In the final, she was defeated by Victoria Azarenka, despite a late comeback in the second set. With this result, Sharapova returned to the top 10 for the first time since February 2009.

During the clay-court season, Sharapova participated in the Madrid Open, where she lost to Dominika Cibulková in the third round, and the Italian Open, where she was seeded seventh.

She then lost to sixth seed and eventual champion, Li Na, in the semifinals, ending her clay season with a win–loss record of 12–2.

At the Wimbledon Championships, Sharapova had not dropped a set entering the final, before losing to eighth seed Petra Kvitová, in straight sets. This marked her first final in over three years at a Grand Slam event. Sharapova started her summer hard-court season at the Bank of the West Classic in Stanford, California. In a highly anticipated match, Sharapova lost to the eventual champion Serena Williams in the quarterfinals. In her next event at the Rogers Cup in Toronto, Sharapova lost to Galina Voskoboeva in the third round, marking her 100th career loss.
Sharapova then contested the Cincinnati Open. As the fourth seed, she received a bye into the second round. On the way to her fourth final of the year, she beat Anastasia Rodionova, 14th seed Svetlana Kuznetsova, tenth seed Samantha Stosur, and 2nd seed Vera Zvonareva. In the final, she defeated fellow former world No. 1 Jelena Janković, in 2 hours and 49 minutes, making it the longest WTA tour final of the year. She subsequently moved up to world No. 4, her highest ranking since August 2008 and the highest since her comeback from her shoulder injury.

Sharapova entered the US Open, where she was seeded third. She beat Heather Watson, and Anastasiya Yakimova, to reach the third round. She was then upset by Flavia Pennetta.

As second seed, she received a bye into the second round, where she beat Tamarine Tanasugarn. She then beat 13th seed Julia Görges, before retiring against Petra Kvitová in the quarterfinal, 3–4, after slipping on the baseline, suffering an ankle injury. This also forced her to withdraw from the China Open the following week. Sharapova then flew to Istanbul to prepare for the 2011 WTA Tour Championships, her first time qualifying since 2007. During the WTA Tour Championships, Sharapova withdrew during the round-robin stage after defeats against Samantha Stosur and Li Na, as a result of the ankle injury she had suffered in Tokyo. Sharapova ended the year as No. 4 in the world, her first top-10 finish since 2008 and first top-5 finish since 2007.

===2012: Career Grand Slam, back to No. 1 and Olympic silver===

Sharapova withdrew from the 2012 Brisbane International because of her ongoing ankle injury. Her first tournament of the season was the 2012 Australian Open, where she was seeded fourth. Sharapova advanced to the final, defeating Gisela Dulko, Jamie Hampton, 30th seed Angelique Kerber, 14th seed Sabine Lisicki, compatriot Ekaterina Makarova and world No. 2, Petra Kvitová. In a match that decided who would become the new world No. 1, she lost to Victoria Azarenka, in straight sets. As a result, her ranking improved to world No. 3 behind Azarenka and Kvitová. She then played in the Open GDF Suez in Paris, where she lost in the quarterfinals to eventual champion Angelique Kerber. As a result, her ranking improved to world No. 2.
At the Indian Wells Open, after battling for over three hours, Sharapova defeated compatriot Maria Kirilenko to set up a semifinal meeting with Ana Ivanovic. Sharapova advanced to the final after Ivanovic retired due to a hip injury. In the final, she played world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka in a rematch of the Australian Open final, but lost again in straight sets. Sharapova&#x27;s next tournament was the 2012 Sony Ericsson Open, where she was seeded 2nd and received a bye. In the final, Sharapova lost in straight sets to fifth seed Agnieszka Radwańska. This was her third loss of the year in finals out of four tournaments played so far. In the Porsche Grand Prix in Stuttgart, Sharapova was seeded second. She had a bye in the first round, and advanced to the third round after Alizé Cornet retired in the second set. She won her first title of the year in Stuttgart after defeating world number one Victoria Azarenka. In doing so, Sharapova defeated three current Grand Slam title holders to win the tournament. Sharapova then played the Madrid Open, a Premier Mandatory event. In the third round, Sharapova&#x27;s opponent Lucie Šafářová was unable to compete and withdrew from the tournament, earning Sharapova a walkover into the quarterfinals. She was then beaten by eventual champion Serena Williams, in straight sets.

As the defending champion and second seed at the Italian Open, Sharapova had a bye in the first round. In the semifinals, Sharapova defeated Angelique Kerber to advance to the final for the second year in a row. In the final, Sharapova saved match point for a 2-hour 52-minute win over Li Na for her 26th career title. This marked the fourth time Sharapova had successfully defended a title.

Sharapova was seeded second at the French Open, where she defeated Alexandra Cadanțu, Ayumi Morita, 28th seed Peng Shuai, Klára Koukalová, Kaia Kanepi and Petra Kvitová on her way to the finals, allowing her to regain the world No. 1 ranking. In the final, she defeated Sara Errani for her fourth career Grand Slam title (her first since 2008) and her first French Open title. Sharapova became only the tenth woman to complete a Career Grand Slam with the French Open victory. During the tournament, Sharapova was asked by the Russian Olympic Committee to bear the flag at the opening ceremony for the 2012 Summer Olympics, becoming the first female Russian athlete to receive this honor.

Sharapova decided not to compete in any of the grass-court warm-up events and instead proceeded straight to the Wimbledon Championships, where she was the top seed at a major event for the first time since the 2008 French Open. She breezed through her first three matches over Anastasia Rodionova, Tsvetana Pironkova and the crafty Hsieh Su-wei, extended her winning streak to 15 matches. However, she was upset in the fourth round in straight sets by the 15th-seeded Sabine Lisicki, whom she beat in the previous year&#x27;s semifinals. Due to being unable to defend her finalist points from the year before, she relinquished the world No. 1 ranking back to Azarenka.

She made her Olympic debut at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London and was seeded third in the singles draw. She easily beat Shahar Pe&#x27;er and hometown favorite Laura Robson in straight sets, before avenging her defeat against Lisicki four weeks prior by beating the German in the third round in a tight three-set match. In the quarterfinals, Sharapova defeated fellow former No. 1, Kim Clijsters, to advance to the semifinals, where she faced her compatriot, Maria Kirilenko. Sharapova defeated Kirilenko to reach the Olympic final and guarantee a medal. Facing off against rival Serena Williams, with both players looking for their first Olympic singles gold medal (and a chance to complete a career Golden Slam), Sharapova was thrashed by Williams in what was to be her worst defeat to the American, winning only a single game. Nonetheless, with this performance, Sharapova won an Olympic silver medal and overtook Agnieszka Radwańska as world No. 2.

Sharapova did not compete in any of the summer hard-court warm-up events after the Olympics, pulling out of both Montreal and Cincinnati (where she was the defending champion) due to a stomach virus. Seeded third at the US Open, Sharapova breezed through her first three matches against Melinda Czink, Lourdes Domínguez Lino, and Mallory Burdette, losing a total of just seven games. In the fourth round, compatriot Nadia Petrova took it to a third set and was winning until a rain delay. After the delay, Sharapova came back to win, advancing to the quarterfinals of the US Open for the first time since she won the tournament in 2006. In the quarterfinals, she faced 11th seed Marion Bartoli, who was 4–0 up before a rain delay, which delayed the match a whole day. Sharapova then came back from a set down to win. In the semifinals, Sharapova lost to world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka despite winning the first set.

Sharapova&#x27;s next tournament was the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo. She made it to the quarterfinals, losing to Samantha Stosur. At the China Open she was seeded second. In the finals she was again defeated by Azarenka. Sharapova&#x27;s next tournament was the year-end championships in Istanbul, where she was seeded second.

In the semifinals, Sharapova beat Azarenka, bringing their head-to-head meetings to 7–5 in Azarenka&#x27;s favour. Although Sharapova made it to the final, Azarenka clinched the year-end No. 1 ranking with her two round-robin wins. She lost to Serena Williams for the 9th consecutive time in the final and the third time that year, notching her best score line in three matchups with a 4–6, 3–6 defeat.

===2013: Third shoulder injury===
Sharapova&#x27;s first scheduled tournament of the 2013 season was the Brisbane International, where she was seeded second. However, she withdrew from the tournament before it began, citing a collarbone injury. She started her season at the Australian Open seeded second. She defeated Olga Puchkova and Misaki Doi in the first two rounds without losing a game in either match, the first time a player won in back-to-back double bagels at a Grand Slam tournament since the 1985 Australian Open. Sharapova then defeated Venus Williams, Kirsten Flipkens, and Ekaterina Makarova, where in losing nine games, she overtook Monica Seles&#x27; record of fewest games dropped heading into a Grand Slam semifinal. She lost to Li Na in the semifinals.
She reached the semifinals at the Qatar Open, losing to Serena Williams for the 10th straight time in her career. Her next tournament was Indian Wells, where she was seeded second. She received a bye into the second round and successfully reached the final without dropping a set, where she faced 2011 Indian wells champion and former world No. 1, Caroline Wozniacki. After an hour and twenty-one minutes, Sharapova won the tournament. This was Sharapova&#x27;s 28th career title and second at Indian Wells. Her win also made her the No. 2 player in the world behind Serena Williams.

Sharapova then competed at the Sony Open. Once again she reached the final without dropping a set and faced world No. 1, Serena Williams. Maria won the first set. However, Serena won the second and dominated the third set. This was Maria&#x27;s 11th consecutive loss against Serena.

Next, she played at the indoor clay event in Stuttgart, where she was the defending champion. Her first three matches were long three-setters: she first beat world No. 25, Lucie Šafářová, dropping the second set on a tiebreak, then Ana Ivanovic, then in the semifinals, she won against third seed Angelique Kerber. In the final, in what was her ninth victory against the Chinese out of 14 matches, she beat second seed world No. 5 Li Na in straight sets to win her 29th career title.

A week later, she competed at the Madrid Open, reaching the final, again without dropping a set. She faced Serena Williams for the 15th time, losing for the 12th consecutive time in straight sets.

Next, she played in Rome, where she was seeded second and had a bye in the first round. She beat 16th seed Sloane Stephens in straight sets (with the loss of three games) in the third round, but then did not play her quarterfinal match against seventh seed Sara Errani and retired from the tournament due to a viral illness.

At the French Open, Sharapova reached the final again, beating Azarenka in three sets in the semifinals, but there she lost in straight sets to Serena Williams. At Wimbledon she was comprehensively beaten in the second round by qualifier Michelle Larcher de Brito. Sharapova then returned to the tour at the Western &amp; Southern Open, where she lost her opening match to Sloane Stephens in three sets. A week later Sharapova withdrew from the US Open, citing a shoulder injury, which prematurely ended her season.

===2014: Comeback and second French Open title===

Sharapova had not played since August 2013 due to a recurring shoulder injury and made her comeback at the Brisbane International. She advanced to the semifinals where she was beaten in straight sets by Serena Williams. At the Australian Open, Sharapova, ranked third, was knocked out of the tournament in the fourth round by the 20th seed, and eventual finalist, Dominika Cibulková. Sharapova lost the match in three sets. She then participated in Open GdF Suez where she was upset in the semifinals to fellow Russian and eventual tournament winner Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, in three sets.

In March, playing in the Indian Wells Open, she was beaten by 22-year-old Italian Camila Giorgi in the third round, in three sets. This dropped her ranking to world No. 7. She reached the semifinals in Miami, facing Serena Williams in a rematch of last year&#x27;s final and lost her 15th consecutive match to Williams. In April, she won the Stuttgart Open, her first title of the year and 30th of her career by defeating Ana Ivanovic in three sets. Stuttgart is the only tournament Sharapova won three times.

She lost to Ana Ivanovic in straight sets.

Sharapova was seeded seventh at the French Open and defeated Ksenia Pervak, Tsvetana Pironkova, and Paula Ormaechea in the first three rounds, all in straight sets. In the fourth round, she defeated Samantha Stosur, reeling off nine straight games from a set and 3–4 down. This marked her 14th win in 16 meetings with the Australian. In the quarterfinals, she defeated Garbiñe Muguruza, again coming back from a set down, to reach the semifinals at the French for the fourth consecutive year. In the semifinals, she defeated Eugenie Bouchard, once again coming back from a set down, to reach her third consecutive French Open final. In the final, she defeated Simona Halep in three sets to win her second French Open title and fifth overall Major title. This was the first time since 2001 that a third set was contested in the final. The match took just over three hours and has been described as one of the best women&#x27;s finals in recent years. At Wimbledon, Sharapova reached the fourth round, where she lost to Angelique Kerber, the ninth seed, in three sets.

Sharapova then played the Rogers Cup in Montreal where she was the fourth seed. She received a first round bye and faced Garbiñe Muguruza in her opener, she won in three sets. In the following round she lost in three sets to Muguruza&#x27;s compatriot, Carla Suárez Navarro. At the Western &amp; Southern Open, Sharapova was seeded fifth and defeated Madison Keys after having a first round bye. She then went on to defeat Pavlyuchenkova and newly crowned world No. 2, Simona Halep, to reach the last four. She faced Ivanovic again but lost in a roller coaster three-setter despite having two match points. Sharapova then travelled to New York for the US Open where she was the 5th seed. She defeated compatriot Maria Kirilenko and Romanian Alexandra Dulgheru before overcoming 26th seeded German Sabine Lisicki in round 3 to set up a clash with Caroline Wozniacki in the round of 16. Sharapova lost to Wozniacki in three sets.

Sharapova next played the inaugural Wuhan Open where she was seeded fourth. After receiving a first-round bye, she defeated compatriot Svetlana Kuznetsova in three sets and next faced Timea Bacsinszky. Although Sharapova won their two previous encounters, she was stunned by Timea in two tight sets, thus ending her campaign at the Premier-5 tournament.

The following week, Sharapova played the China Open in Beijing, a Premier Mandatory-level tournament. Reaching the final without dropping a set, Sharapova defeated world No. 9 Ana Ivanovic in the semifinals. In the final, Sharapova met reigning Wimbledon champion and world No. 3, Petra Kvitová. Sharapova won the match in 2 hours 30 minutes, defeating the Czech in three sets. By virtue of the win, Sharapova&#x27;s ranking rose from No. 4 to No. 2 in the world and she secured herself the second seeding for the WTA year-end Championship. Sharapova closed in on the year-end number-one ranking spot, 467 points behind Williams.

Sharapova was ranked No. 2 heading into the WTA Tour Championships, with a chance of overtaking Serena Williams as world No. 1. She was drawn in the white group, with Kvitová, Radwańska, and Wozniacki. Her first match was a three set loss to Wozniacki. Sharapova also lost her second round robin match to Kvitová in straight sets. She ended the year with a win against Radwańska in three sets, finishing third overall in the White Group. She ended the year as world No. 2, behind Serena Williams.

===2015: Fourth Australian Open final===

Sharapova kicked off her 2015 season at the Brisbane International where she was top seed and received a bye in the first round. Sharapova defeated Yaroslava Shvedova and Carla Suárez Navarro. In the semifinals, Sharapova faced Elina Svitolina, beating her in straight sets. Reaching the final without dropping a set, Sharapova played an intense match against second seed Ana Ivanovic but came through in three sets. This was Sharapova&#x27;s tenth win over Ivanovic and by winning her 34th title, it meant that Sharapova had won at least one title every year for 13 consecutive years. Also, it was just her second title in Australia so far, beating Ivanovic both times. Sharapova&#x27;s next tournament was the Australian Open, where she beat Petra Martić and fellow countrywoman Alexandra Panova (despite having two match points against her) in the first two rounds, before beating Zarina Diyas and Peng Shuai in straight sets. There, she beat seventh-seeded Eugenie Bouchard and Ekaterina Makarova, in straight sets, to make her fourth Australian Open final, where she lost to Serena Williams in straight sets, worsening her record against her to 2–17. In February, following her participation in the Fed Cup, Sharapova played in Acapulco, where she beat Shelby Rogers, Mariana Duque Mariño and Magdaléna Rybáriková to advance the semifinals. Sharapova later withdrew from her match against Caroline Garcia, citing a stomach virus. Next, in Indian Wells, she beat Yanina Wickmayer and Victoria Azarenka in straight sets, before losing to defending champion Flavia Pennetta in the fourth round in three sets. After receiving a bye in the first round of the Miami Open, Sharapova lost in the second round to fellow Russian Daria Gavrilova in straight sets, marking her earliest exit from the tournament since her first appearance in Miami in 2003.

Sharapova began her clay season in Stuttgart where she was the three-time defending champion. After receiving a first-round bye, she lost in the second round to Angelique Kerber in three sets, snapping Sharapova&#x27;s win streak at the tournament and marking her first-ever loss at the tournament, having won it three times in a row (2012, 2013, &amp; 2014). The loss also snapped a 64 match win streak on clay where Sharapova won the first set and went on to win the match. The last time Sharapova lost a match on clay, after winning the first set was against Dinara Safina in the fourth round at the 2008 French Open. As a result of the loss, Sharapova lost the No. 2 ranking to Simona Halep. Sharapova&#x27;s next clay court tournament was the Madrid Open, where she was the defending champion. She advanced to the semifinals. There, she was beaten by Svetlana Kuznetsova for the first time since 2008. Sharapova&#x27;s next tournament was the Italian Open in Rome where she was seeded third. She beat Victoria Azarenka in the quarterfinals in straight sets to set up a rematch with Daria Gavrilova. She beat Gavrilova in straight sets to advance to the final, where she faced Carla Suárez Navarro. After losing the first set, Sharapova managed to claim the next two sets and her third Rome title. By winning Rome, Sharapova temporarily reclaimed the No. 2 ranking over Halep. Sharapova was seeded fourth at Wimbledon and reached the semifinals, where she lost to Serena Williams (the eventual champion) in straight sets. After Wimbledon, she withdrew from the US Open, citing a knee injury. This caused her to lose the No. 2 ranking to Halep again.

She then received a wildcard into Wuhan Open and received a bye into the second round. However, she retired in her match against Barbora Strýcová in the 3rd set, citing a left forearm injury. She then withdrew from the China Open, where she was the defending champion, to recover in time for the WTA Finals and the Fed Cup final. At the WTA Finals, she was drawn into the red group, alongside Simona Halep, Agnieszka Radwańska, and Flavia Pennetta. She then won all three of her round-robin matches and achieved 1st position in her group. Her win over Pennetta also marked the last match of the Italian&#x27;s career. Sharapova then played the player who finished 2nd in the White Group, Petra Kvitová. She lost the match in straight sets, despite having a 5–1 lead in the second set.

Sharapova then played in the Fed Cup final, winning both of her matches, against Karolína Plíšková and got revenge against Petra Kvitová for her loss in the WTA Finals. However, Russia eventually lost 2–3 after falling in a crucial doubles rubber. The Russian ended the season as the world No. 4, despite not playing the US Open Series and missing most of the Fall Asian Hardcourt season. She had a win–loss record of 39–9 and won two titles, reaching the second week in all of the Grand Slams she played.

===2016: More injuries and doping suspension===
Sharapova began her 2016 season at the Brisbane International where she was the defending champion. She would have faced Ekaterina Makarova in the first round, but withdrew hours before the match, citing a left forearm injury, and was replaced by Margarita Gasparyan.

Due to Agnieszka Radwańska winning the Shenzhen Open, Sharapova was seeded fifth at the Australian Open. She was drawn to face Nao Hibino in the first round and won in straight sets. She then won her second round match against Aliaksandra Sasnovich, also in straight sets. Sharapova then lost her first set in the tournament as she defeated Lauren Davis, in three sets. In the fourth round, she then played her first career match against Belinda Bencic and won in two tight sets over two hours of play. Sharapova then faced Serena Williams in the quarterfinal, a repeat of the previous year&#x27;s final. Although she started the match brightly, she was defeated in straight sets. She failed to defend her finalist points from the previous year and fell to sixth in the rankings after the tournament.

After the Australian Open, Sharapova was nominated by team captain Anastasia Myskina to play the Fed Cup, but she had a forearm injury and was only listed for the doubles match. Russia lost the first three matches and chose Makarova to replace Sharapova for the dead doubles match. In the end, Russia lost 3–1 but by being nominated for the match, Sharapova successfully qualified for the Summer Olympics having played sufficient Fed Cup matches to meet the criteria.

Citing the left forearm injury sustained at the start of the year, Sharapova withdrew from the Qatar Open, and a week before the BNP Paribas Open, she withdrew from that for the same reason.

Following a failed drug test from the 2016 Australian Open, in which she tested positive for meldonium, a substance that had been banned, effective 1 January 2016, by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), Sharapova was provisionally suspended from competitive tennis with effect from 12 March. On 8 June she was banned for two years by the International Tennis Federation. Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko has implied that Sharapova was targeted due to the political crisis in Russian-American relations. In October 2016, Sharapova&#x27;s ban was reduced from 24 months (2 years) to 15 months, starting from 26 January 2016, the date of the drug test she had failed.

===2017: Return from suspension, first WTA title in two years===
Sharapova returned to the WTA Tour in April 2017. She was given wildcards to compete in the following three WTA tournaments: Women&#x27;s Stuttgart Open, Madrid Open and Italian Open. She played her first match of her comeback on 26 April at the Porsche Grand Prix, a tournament that she had previously won on three occasions. Her first-round opponent was Italian Roberta Vinci, who she went on to defeat in straight sets to advance to the second round, making it her first victory since her return. In her on-court interview Sharapova said, &quot;The first few seconds before you enter the arena – it&#x27;s been a stage of mine since I was a young girl – I&#x27;ve been waiting for this moment for a long time.&quot; She followed it up with another straight sets victory over Ekaterina Makarova in the second round. In the quarterfinals, she defeated qualifier Anett Kontaveit in straight sets, before losing to Kristina Mladenovic in the semifinals.

Sharapova then took part in the Madrid Open where she beat Mirjana Lučić-Baroni in three sets. Sharapova played a second round encounter with Eugenie Bouchard which after three sets Sharapova lost. In the 2017 Internazionali BNL d&#x27;Italia opening match she defeated Christina McHale in straight sets. In her next match, she again faced the 16th seed Mirjana Lučić-Baroni in a rematch of their encounter in Madrid. At one set apiece, Sharapova needed a medical timeout for her thigh, which ultimately forced her to retire in the third set. Just before the players came on court, French Federation president Bernard Giudicelli announced that Sharapova would not be receiving a wildcard in the main draw or the qualifying draw, preventing her from playing in the 2017 French Open.

Sharapova then received a wildcard to play Birmingham Classic. However, the same thigh injury at the Italian Open forced her to withdraw from the entire grass season, including the Wimbledon qualifying rounds. Sharapova was given another wildcard at the Stanford Classic, her first hard court tournament since the 2016 Australian Open. Her first round opponent was Jennifer Brady, whom she defeated in three sets. The win also pushed Sharapova back inside the top 150. Sharapova withdrew from the next round with a left arm injury. She was set to make a return at the Canadian Open, where she had received a wildcard, but ultimately withdrew due to a left arm injury. She was set to play the Cincinnati Open as a wildcard but pulled out to be fully fit for the US Open, which had also granted Sharapova a wildcard entry. She opened the US Open against world No. 2, Simona Halep, and won in three sets, her first US Open win since the 2014 US Open. In the second round she defeated Tímea Babos, coming from a set down to win in three. In the third round, she played the American wildcard Sofia Kenin, an 18-year-old who was making her first main draw appearance in a major. Sharapova defeated the teenager in tight straight sets to advance to the second week of the US Open. She was defeated by 16th seed Anastasija Sevastova in the fourth round.

Sharapova received and accepted wildcards to enter the China Open and Tianjin Open, both held in China. In her opening match at the China Open, Sharapova once again faced Sevastova, this time prevailing in a three-hour, three-set match. In the second round, Sharapova defeated Ekaterina Makarova, seeing her move back into the top 100 for the first time since before her suspension. In the third round, Sharapova lost to Simona Halep in straight sets, marking her first loss to the Romanian after seven consecutive victories. Sharapova then remained in China for the Tianjin Open, which was her first appearance at the tournament. Sharapova went on to win the tournament, marking her first WTA title since 2015, without dropping a set, including coming back from 1–4 down in the first set and 1–5 down in the second set against 19-year-old Aryna Sabalenka in the final. The result saw her eventually climb the rankings into the top 60, and she later received another wildcard to enter the Kremlin Cup. Sharapova recorded her first opening round loss since 2013, with a straight-sets loss to eighth seed Magdaléna Rybáriková.

===2018: Return to top 25 and French Open quarterfinal===
Sharapova began her 2018 season at the Shenzhen Open. She defeated Mihaela Buzărnescu, Alison Riske and Zarina Diyas to advance to the semifinals, where she fell to defending champion Kateřina Siniaková. Sharapova then returned to the Australian Open for the first time since her suspension, defeating Tatjana Maria and Anastasija Sevastova in the opening two rounds, before losing to Angelique Kerber in straight sets in the third round. Sharapova received a wildcard to enter the Qatar Open, losing in three sets to Monica Niculescu in the opening round. Sharapova pulled out of the Dubai Tennis Championships due to citing a forearm strain. Sharapova played the Indian Wells Open falling in the opening round to Naomi Osaka in straight sets. Sharapova was set to play the Miami Open but withdrew due to a forearm injury.

Despite the loss, her performance improved her ranking inside the top 30 and being seeded for the first time since her suspension at the 2016 Australian Open. Sharapova began her 2018 French Open campaign with a three set win over Richèl Hogenkamp and continued with a straight set win over Croatia&#x27;s Donna Vekić in the second round. In the third round, she defeated world No. 6, Karolína Plíšková in straight sets to advance to the second week of the French Open. In the fourth round, Sharapova was set to play Serena Williams, but Williams withdrew due to injury, giving Sharapova a walkover into her first Grand Slam quarterfinal since the 2016 Australian Open. Sharapova&#x27;s run ended with a straight sets loss to world No. 3 Garbiñe Muguruza in the quarterfinals.

Sharapova was set to play the Birmingham Classic but withdrew to fully recover ahead of Wimbledon. Sharapova played two exhibition matches, losing her debut to Greece&#x27;s Maria Sakkari but defeating Natalia Vikhlyantseva. Sharapova exited Wimbledon with a three set lost to Vitalia Diatchenko despite being up a set and serving for the match. This marked her worst Grand Slam result since the 2010 Australian Open and her first ever opening round loss at Wimbledon. Sharapova was set to play at the Silicon Valley Classic but withdrew due to a change in her schedule. Sharapova played at the Rogers Cup and recorded straight sets wins over Sesil Karatantcheva and Daria Kasatkina.

Sharapova recorded her first win in Russia in thirteen years with a straight sets win over Daria Gavrilova at the 2019 St. Petersburg Ladies&#x27; Trophy. Sharapova withdrew from her second round match against Daria Kasatkina. Sharapova was set to play at the Indian Wells Open and Miami Open but withdrew before the tournaments started due to a shoulder injury for which she stated she was to have minor surgery to repair a fraying tendon and a labrum tear. Sharapova later withdrew from the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix, Madrid Open, Italian Open and French Open due to not being able to compete at her highest level because of her lingering shoulder injury.

Sharapova made a return after being away for over four months, in the grasscourt season at the Mallorca Open where she received a wild card. In the opening round, Sharapova defeated Viktória Kužmová in straight sets and recorded her first grasscourt win since 2015.

===2020: Retirement===
Sharapova began her 2020 season at an exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi, where she defeated Ajla Tomljanović in straight sets. Although she was scheduled to play exhibition at the Hawaii Open a week later, she pulled out of the tournament because she was unprepared. Sharapova received a wildcard at the Brisbane International and fell in the opening round to Jennifer Brady in three sets. Sharapova participated at the Kooyong Classic, where her opening match against Laura Siegemund was stopped after the second set due to heavy smoke from wildfires, before being defeated by Tomljanović in the second round. As a wildcard at the 2020 Australian Open, Sharapova was defeated in straight sets by Donna Vekić in the first round. This marked her third consecutive first-round loss at a Grand Slam tournament and, following the tournament, her ranking fell to no. 369, her lowest ranking since August 2002.

That defeat to Vekic in Melbourne would prove to be Sharapova&#x27;s final match of her career, as on 26 February 2020, Sharapova announced her retirement from tennis. In an essay in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and &quot;Vogue&quot;, Sharapova wrote: &quot;I&#x27;m new to this, so please forgive me. Tennis – I&#x27;m saying goodbye. But as I embark on my next chapter, I want anyone who dreams of excelling in anything to know that doubt and judgement are inevitable. You will fail hundreds of times and the world will watch you. Accept it. Trust yourself. I promise you that you will prevail.&quot;

==WADA substance controversy==

On 7 March 2016, Sharapova revealed that she had failed a drug test at the 2016 Australian Open, which she described as the result of an oversight. Sharapova admitted to testing positive for meldonium, an anti-ischemic drug usually prescribed for heart conditions that was added to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)&#x27;s banned substances list on 1 January 2016. Sharapova was provisionally suspended by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) from playing tennis effective from 12 March 2016. She later released a statement regarding the test and explaining her use of the medicine:

I received a letter from the ITF that I failed a drugs test at the Australian Open. I take full responsibility for it. For the past ten years I have been given a medicine called mildronate by my family doctor and a few days ago after I received the ITF letter I found out that it also has another name of meldonium which I did not know. It is very important for you to understand that for ten years this medicine was not on WADA&#x27;s banned list and I had legally been taking the medicine for the past ten years. But on January 1st [2016] the rules had changed and meldonium became a prohibited substance which I had not known. I was given this medicine by my doctor for several health issues that I was having in 2006.

Meldonium is not approved for use in the United States, Sharapova&#x27;s country of residence; however, it is legal to use in Russia, the country that Sharapova represents in tennis. The drug&#x27;s inventor Ivars Kalviņš said that he did not think taking it should be construed as &quot;doping&quot;, but he also said that it &quot;is very popular among athletes&quot; and was used by the Soviet military for &quot;optimizing the use of oxygen&quot; and that it &quot;allows athletes to train under maximum strain&quot;. Don Catlin, a long-time anti-doping expert and the scientific director of the Banned Substances Control Group (BSCG) stated that &quot;There&#x27;s really no evidence that there&#x27;s any performance enhancement from meldonium – Zero percent.&quot;

Sharapova said that she had been taking the drug to treat magnesium deficiency, an irregular EKG and family history of diabetes, and indicated that she had not read an email informing her that meldonium had been banned for use in tennis. Meldonium&#x27;s addition was outlined on a WADA and United States Anti-Doping Agency summary document and it has been reported that all tennis players were warned five times that it was due to be banned. On 11 March 2016, Sharapova denied reports about the five missed warnings via Facebook:

That&#x27;s a distortion of the actual &quot;communications&quot; which were provided or simply posted onto a webpage. I make no excuses for not knowing about the ban. The other &quot;communications&quot;? They were buried in newsletters, websites, or handouts (many of them technical, in small print). I didn&#x27;t take the medicine every day. I took it the way my doctor recommended I take it and I took it in the low doses recommended. I&#x27;m proud of how I have played the game. I have been honest and upfront. I won&#x27;t pretend to be injured so I can hide the truth about my testing.

Most fellow tennis players reacted to Sharapova&#x27;s announcement with little support or sympathy. John McEnroe and Pat Cash said they found it hard to believe her. Jennifer Capriati posted on Twitter that she should be stripped of her professional titles. Chris Evert expressed her surprise at the lack of support in tennis for Sharapova, noting that she &quot;[had] always isolated herself from the rest of the tennis world, from the players&quot;. Serena Williams expressed surprise at Sharapova&#x27;s announcement but commended her for being &quot;upfront with what she had done&quot;. Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray all publicly condemned Sharapova and argued that she deserved to be punished on the basis that she failed the doping test, with Murray adding that &quot;Taking a drug you don&#x27;t necessarily need because it&#x27;s legal is wrong&quot; and Federer stating that &quot;Whether it&#x27;s intentional or not, I don&#x27;t see too much difference. You must be 100 percent about what you are taking&quot;. Sharapova&#x27;s case prompted Federer to urge the tennis federation to conduct more anti-doping tests. Novak Djokovic said that he felt sorry for her, but that she must still be ready for punishment. The Russian Tennis Federation strongly defended Sharapova, describing the positive drug test as &quot;nonsense&quot; and adding that they expected Sharapova to be available for the 2016 Summer Olympics.

As a result of the failed drug test, Nike and TAG Heuer suspended their relationships with Sharapova, while Porsche postponed promotional work. Racquet manufacturer HEAD stood by Sharapova, saying, &quot;We look forward to working with her&quot;, and announced that they intended to extend their contract. They also suggested that WADA should prove scientifically why the drug should be banned. The United Nations Development Programme suspended Sharapova from her role as a goodwill ambassador on 16 March, while expressing thanks for her support of their work over the previous nine years.

On 12 April, WADA intimated that athletes who tested positive for meldonium before 1 March could avoid bans, but the International Tennis Federation said that Sharapova&#x27;s case would proceed. On 8 June, the ITF announced that Sharapova would be suspended for two years. Sharapova indicated she would appeal the ban.

Following a hearing on 7 and 8 September 2016, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) panel found that Sharapova had a reduced perception of the risk that she took while using Mildronate, because (a) she had used Mildronate for around ten years without any anti-doping issue, (b) she did not mask or hide her use of mildronate and was open about it to many in her entourage (c) she had consulted the Russian doctor who prescribed the Mildronate for medical reasons, not to enhance her performance, and (d) she had received no specific warning about the change in status of meldonium from WADA, the ITF, or the WTA. However, the CAS panel also noted Sharapova&#x27;s failure to disclose her use of meldonium on her doping control forms and that she was at fault for (a) failing to give her agent adequate instructions as to how to carry out the important task of checking the Prohibited List, and (b) failing to supervise and control the actions of her agent in carrying out that task (specifically the lack of any procedure for reporting or follow-up verification to make sure that her agent had actually discharged his duty).

 Finally, the panel wishes to point out that the case it heard, and the award it renders, is not about an athlete who cheated. It was only about the degree of fault that can be imputed to a player for a player to make sure that a substance contained in a product she had been legally taking over a long period, and for most of the time on the basis of a doctor&#x27;s prescription, remained in compliance with TADP and WADC. No question of the intent to violate the TADP and WADC was before this panel: under no circumstances therefore, can the Player be considered to be an &quot;intentional doper&quot;.

On 4 October, the CAS reduced the sanction imposed on Sharapova by an Independent Tribunal from 24 months to 15 months. CAS released a statement on its official website stating:

Ms. Sharapova committed an anti-doping rule violation and that while it was with &quot;no significant fault&quot;, she bore some degree of fault, for which a sanction of 15 months is appropriate.

==Fed Cup participation==
Sharapova has lived in the United States since moving there at the age of seven, but retains her Russian citizenship, and is therefore eligible to play in the Fed Cup for Russia. However, the behavior of Sharapova&#x27;s father during her matches on the WTA Tour, combined with a perceived lack of commitment by her to the Fed Cup, made her selection for the Russian Fed Cup team controversial in the past.

After Sharapova had beaten fellow Russian Anastasia Myskina at the 2004 WTA Tour Championships, Myskina criticized Sharapova&#x27;s father, saying: &quot;He was just yelling and screaming instructions to her and I thought he just might jump right on the court at one point in the match.&quot; At the Fed Cup semifinals two weeks later, Myskina stated she would stop playing for Russia if Sharapova joined the Russian team the following season: &quot;If she joins our team next season you won&#x27;t see me there for sure. His behaviour is totally incorrect, simply rude. I don&#x27;t want to be around people like him.&quot; Larisa Neiland, assistant to Russia Fed Cup captain Shamil Tarpishchev, added: &quot;Her father&#x27;s behaviour (at the WTA Tour Championships) was simply outrageous. I just don&#x27;t see how he could work with the rest of us.&quot; However, Tarpishchev himself played down the problem, insisting: &quot;I feel that things will calm down soon and we&#x27;ll have Myskina, Sharapova, Kuznetsova and everyone else playing for Russia.&quot;

At the end of 2005, Sharapova stated she was now keen to make her Fed Cup debut and was set to play against Belgium in April 2006, but withdrew.
She later withdrew from ties against Spain in April 2007 and against the United States in July 2007 because of injuries. The latter withdrawal led to Russia&#x27;s captain saying she would be &quot;ineligible for selection&quot; for the Fed Cup final in September. However, Sharapova attended the final, cheering from the sidelines and acting as a &quot;hitting partner&quot; in practices, resulting in some of her Russian teammates implying that she was attending only to enable her to play at the 2008 Beijing Olympics (rules state that players must have &quot;shown commitment&quot; to Fed Cup in order to play). Svetlana Kuznetsova said, &quot;She said she wanted to be our practice partner but if you can&#x27;t play how then can you practice?&quot;

Sharapova finally made her Fed Cup debut in February 2008, in Russia&#x27;s quarterfinal tie against Israel. She won both her singles rubbers, against Tzipora Obziler and Shahar Pe&#x27;er, helping Russia to a 4–1 victory. For the semifinals, she was given permission to skip the tie, with Tarpishchev announcing that she will be on the team for the final. However, the date of the final coincided with the lay-off from her shoulder injury, and thus she did not play.

In the 2011 first-round tie, Sharapova played Virginie Razzano of France and lost. Sharapova was supposed to play Alizé Cornet but she was suffering from a viral illness. Teammate Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova played and defeated Cornet to secure the 3–2 win for Russia against France. Sharapova continued to participate in 2012 and helped Russia to a 3–2 win against Spain in the first-round tie. Sharapova defeated Sílvia Soler Espinosa in the first rubber, but was unable to play her second rubber due to illness. In 2015, Sharapova helped Russia earn a place in the semifinals after beating Pole Urszula Radwańska in the first tie and her sister Agnieszka Radwańska in the second tie. Sharapova was scheduled to play the semifinal against Germany, however, she withdrew days before the competition. She then joined the team for the final against Czech Republic and won both of her matches, against Petra Kvitová and Karolína Plíšková. Despite the 2 wins by Sharapova, Russia still lost 3–2 after losing the decisive doubles rubber.

==Playing style==

Sharapova was an aggressive baseliner, whose game was centered on her powerful serve and groundstrokes. She hit her shots with relentless speed, power, and depth, and could generate sharp, acute angles with both her forehand and backhand. Her aggressive, high-risk playing style meant that she typically generated high numbers of both winners and unforced errors. Sharapova&#x27;s greatest weapon was her backhand, which was described upon her retirement as &quot;among the best in tennis&quot;. Her crosscourt backhand was her greatest shot, although she was also adept at hitting her backhand down-the-line, and was able to hit winners with her backhand from any position on the court. Her forehand was also strong, capable of dominating opponents with her flat and powerful shots. She was one of the few players on the WTA Tour who often used the reverse forehand—also known as the &#x27;buggy whip&#x27; forehand—a technique that allowed her to hit winners from defensive positions which excelled on fast grass, hard, and carpet courts. It has been speculated, however, that her reliance on this shot may have contributed to her worsening shoulder injury. From 2010 onwards, when she returned after shoulder surgery, Sharapova began to hit her forehand with a more conventional swing, with increased amounts of topspin. This alteration allowed her to excel on clay courts, but affected her game on faster hard and grass courts. Later in her career, Sharapova added both a drop shot and a sliced backhand to her repertoire, making for a more unpredictable playing style. Whilst her drop shot was highly telegraphed, her exceptional execution allowed her to end points, or induce unforced errors from opponents. Sharapova was thought to have good speed around the court, especially considering her height, although her footwork, speed, and court coverage were always considered the major weaknesses in her game. These improved throughout her career, allowing her to execute a more defensive playing style effectively, counterpunching until she could create the opportunity to hit a winner.

Throughout her career, Sharapova&#x27;s greatest asset was considered to be her mental toughness and competitive spirit, with Nick Bollettieri stating that she is &quot;tough as nails&quot;; Bollettieri later described her mental strength as &quot;unbelieveable&quot;. Hall-of-famer John McEnroe said of Sharapova, &quot;she&#x27;s one of the best competitors in the history of the sport.&quot; Upon her retirement, she was described as &quot;the ultimate competitor&quot;, who was set apart from her peers by her mental strength, and was lauded as an &quot;unyielding character&quot;. American player Christina McHale described playing Sharapova as &quot;intimidating&quot; due to her mental fortitude, competitive spirit, and composure under pressure. Sharapova was known for on-court &quot;grunting&quot;, which reached a recorded 101 decibels during a match at Wimbledon in 2005; Sharapova described her grunting as &quot;a natural instinct.&quot; When questioned by the media about her grunting, Sharapova urged the media to &quot;just watch the match.&quot;

===Serve===
Early in her career, Sharapova&#x27;s first and second serves were regarded as powerful, and she was believed to possess one of the best deliveries on the WTA Tour. Since the beginning of 2007, however, problems with her shoulder reduced the effectiveness of her serve. Her shoulder injury resulted in not only inconsistent first serves, but also led to Sharapova hitting high numbers of double faults. Two-time US Open singles champion Tracy Austin stated that Sharapova often lost confidence in the rest of her game when she experienced problems with her serve, and consequently produced more unforced errors and generally played more tentatively, whilst tennis writer Joel Drucker remarked that her serve was the &quot;catalyst for her entire game&quot;, and that her struggles with it left her &quot;unmasked.&quot; In her return from an injury layoff in 2008 to 2009, she used an abbreviated motion, which, whilst producing aces, was somewhat less powerful, and also gave a very high number of double faults. From 2010, Sharapova returned to a more elongated motion, similar to her pre-surgery serve. She was able to produce speeds greater than before, including a serve hit at the Birmingham tournament in 2010—the fastest serve of her career. Continuing shoulder injuries affected her serve, and, by the end of her career, her serve was a major liability, with Sharapova serving many double faults per match.

===Net Play===
Instead of using a traditional volley or overhead smash, she preferred to hit powerful &quot;swinging&quot; volleys when approaching the net or attacking lobs. In her final years, Sharapova began to attack the net more, and showed improved feel when volleying, being able to hit delicate volleys with increased regularity. This tactic was considered by some to compensate for her decreased power at the baseline as a result of her shoulder injury.

===Surfaces===
Because she predicated her game on power and aggression, Sharapova&#x27;s preferred surfaces early in her career were fast hard, grass, and carpet courts. Sharapova initially was not as well-suited to slower clay courts, admitting in 2007 that she was not as comfortable with her movement on clay compared with other court surfaces and once described herself as like a &quot;cow on ice&quot; on clay due to her inability to slide. As her career developed, she began to improve on the surface, winning her first red clay title at the 2009 Internationaux de Strasbourg, with her clay-court prowess culminating to two Roland-Garros titles. In 2014, she led the WTA Tour with the highest winning percentage on clay among active players, with an 84.25% winning rate.

==Coaches==
Sharapova had multiple coaches throughout her career. Besides her father Yuri, this included Robert Lansdorp, Michael Joyce in 2004–11, Jimmy Connors in 2013, Sven Groeneveld in 2013–18, Thomas Högstedt in 2010–13, 2018–19, and Riccardo Piatti in 2019–20.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
In 2011, Sharapova was engaged to Slovenian professional basketball player Sasha Vujačić, with whom she had been in a relationship since 2009. On 31 August 2012, Sharapova confirmed that the pair had ended the engagement and separated earlier that year. Between 2012 and 2015, Sharapova dated Bulgarian tennis player Grigor Dimitrov.

Since 2018, Sharapova has been in a relationship with British businessman Alexander Gilkes. In December 2020, Sharapova and Gilkes revealed they were engaged. On 1 July 2022, she gave birth to a son.

===Public profile===
Sharapova has lived in the United States since moving there at the age of seven. She has a home in Bradenton, Florida, and another in Manhattan Beach, California.
From 2005 to 2011, Sharapova was named to the &quot;Forbes&quot; Celebrity 100, which attempts to compile the top 100 most powerful celebrities of that year.
Sharapova made varying remarks on how long she intends to maintain her tennis career. Following the retirement of 25-year-old Justine Henin in 2008, Sharapova said, &quot;If I [were] 25, and I&#x27;d won so many Grand Slams, I&#x27;d quit too.&quot; In an interview after the 2008 Australian Open, she balked at the idea of playing for another ten years, saying that she hoped to have a &quot;nice husband and a few kids&quot; by then. However, in an interview before her 2012 Australian Open semifinal, Sharapova changed her stance, saying she intended to continue playing tennis for as long as she enjoyed playing the game. Sharapova stated: I&#x27;m sure when I was 17 years old and someone said, you&#x27;ll be playing for another eight years, it would be like, you&#x27;re not going to see me at a press conference at 25 years old. But years go on. I missed a year in my career—I didn&#x27;t play that year. I&#x27;ve said this, just before the tournament, a few weeks before, I woke up, and I was just so happy to be going back on the court. I felt so fresh, full of energy, just with a really good perspective. Times change, obviously. I see myself playing this sport for many more years because it&#x27;s something that gives me the most pleasure in my life. I think it helps when you know you&#x27;re good at something, and you can always improve it. It obviously helps with the encouragement.

===Politics===
In early March 2022, Sharapova spoke out against the Russian invasion of Ukraine and pledged to donate to &#x27;Save the Children&#x27; organisation helping Ukrainian children impacted by the war.

===Citizenship===
Although a United States resident since 1994, Sharapova preferred to keep her Russian citizenship: It is about the family environment, it is about the rich culture. Just life experiences that I look back to and I know that for so many years I was shaped into the individual I was from those experiences. And not necessarily simply the country, but the people, the mentality and the toughness and that never giving up attitude.

===Charity work===
The Maria Sharapova Foundation is committed to helping children around the world achieve their dreams. Sharapova has donated $100,000 to Chernobyl-related projects. In partnership with the UNDP, she launched a $210,000 scholarship program for students from Chernobyl-affected areas of Belarus that will award five-year scholarships to 12 students at the Belarusian State Academy of Arts and the Belarusian State University. At the 2004 US Open, Sharapova, along with several other Russian female tennis players, wore a black ribbon in observance of the tragedy after the Beslan school hostage crisis, which took place only days before. In 2005, she donated around US$50,000 to those affected by the crisis. On 14 February 2007, Sharapova was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and donated US$210,000 to UNDP Chernobyl-recovery projects. She stated at the time that she was planning to travel back to the area after Wimbledon in 2008, though it didn&#x27;t happen since she had to travel back to the US because of her shoulder injury. She fulfilled the trip in late June/early July 2010. Sharapova helped to promote the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, and was the first torch bearer in the torch-lighting ceremony during the opening festivities. In addition, Sharapova participated in an exhibition in Tampa in December 2004, raising money for the Florida Hurricane Relief Fund. In July 2008, Sharapova sent a message on DVD to the memorial service of Emily Bailes, who had performed the coin toss ahead of the 2004 Wimbledon final that Sharapova won.

===Autobiography===
Sharapova&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Unstoppable. My Life So Far&quot; was published on 12 September 2017, by Sarah Crichton Books.

==Endorsements==

Sharapova&#x27;s tennis success and appearance have enabled her to secure commercial endorsements that greatly exceed the value of her tournament winnings. She has been represented by IMG agent Max Eisenbud since around 1999. In March 2006, Forbes magazine listed her as the highest-paid female athlete in the world, with annual earnings of over US$18 million, the majority of which was from endorsements and sponsorships. She topped that list every year until 2016, even after her 2007 shoulder injury. In 2011, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed Sharapova as No. 29 in their list of 50 top-paid athletes, the only woman on the list. In 2012, she was listed as No. 15, and was joined in the top 20 by Li Na at No. 16 and Serena Williams at No. 17. In April 2005, &quot;People&quot; named her one of the 50 most beautiful celebrities in the world. In 2006, &quot;Maxim&quot; ranked Sharapova the hottest athlete in the world for the fourth consecutive year. She posed in a six-page bikini photoshoot spread in the 2006 Valentine&#x27;s Day issue of the &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot;, alongside 25 supermodels. In a poll run by Britain&#x27;s &quot;FHM&quot; magazine, she was voted the seventh most eligible bachelorette, based on both &quot;wealth and looks.&quot;

Immediately after her win at the 2004 Wimbledon Championship, mobile phone company Motorola signed Sharapova to endorse their mobile phone line. Additionally, she appeared in commercials for Land Rover and Canon, as well as approved of namesake items by watch brand Tag Heuer and jeweller Tiffany. Tiffany also provides Sharapova with earrings from the &quot;Tiffany for Maria Sharapova&quot; collection at the four major events, that are also retailed globally. She also starred in an award-winning campaign for the sports clothing brand Nike, &quot;Pretty&quot;, in the summer of 2006. She signed a sponsorship deal in January 2007 with Gatorade and Tropicana, which ended in 2009. In 2007, Sharapova was featured in a number of Canon USA&#x27;s commercials for the PowerShot. Sharapova has also been depicted in many tennis-related video games. Some of the titles include the &quot;Top Spin series&quot;, &quot;Virtua Tennis&quot; series, and &quot;Grand Slam Tennis&quot; series. During the layoff due to her shoulder surgery, Sharapova decided to focus on developing her name as a brand, beginning with meeting with her sponsors more extensively to further her brand. In January 2010, it was announced that Sharapova had renewed her contract with Nike, signing an 8-year deal for $70 million—the most lucrative deal ever for a sportswoman.

Sharapova launched her own tennis apparel line, the Nike Maria Sharapova Collection, in 2010. The collection includes dresses that she designed for all the major tournaments, in collaboration with Nike and Cole Haan. She comes up with design ideas and sketches in a process that begins 18 months before the event and receives royalties from the sale of the collection, of which the corresponding dresses are coordinated to be available simultaneously with the corresponding major tournament. Sharapova had earlier collaborated with Nike on the little black dress that she wore for her night matches at the 2006 US Open. The dress featured a round crystal-studded collar and was inspired by Audrey Hepburn. The dress was well publicized and received but was not mass-produced. Additionally, she designs shoes and handbags for Cole Haan, for which her signature ballerina flats are one of the biggest sellers of the entire brand.

Sharapova used the Prince Triple Threat Hornet for part of 2003 and then used several different Prince racquets. She started the 2004 season with the Prince More Attack 920, which she used to win the 2004 Wimbledon Championships. She gave the racquet to Regis Philbin when taping &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;, and began using the Prince Turbo Shark MP specially designed for her at the 2004 US Open until 2005. She then switched to the Prince O3 White racquet in January 2006 which helped her capture her second major at the 2006 US Open. She briefly used the Prince O3 Speedport White at the 2007 Kremlin Cup, but ultimately switched back to the O3 White, winning her third major at the 2008 Australian Open. She then switched to the Prince O3 Speedport Black in July 2008 after returning to the tour from shoulder surgery, then switched to the Prince EXO3 Black 100 in 2010. After being with Prince for ten years, Sharapova began endorsing Head racquets in 2011 and used their Instinct line, winning the French Open in 2012 and 2014 until she retired in 2020.

Sharapova signed a three-year deal to be brand ambassador for Porsche in 2013.

==Business ventures==

Sharapova launched her confectionery brand Sugarpova in 2012. Sugarpova had a reported sales of $20 million in the year 2019. In 2014, Sharapova invested in sunscreen brand supergoop. It was reported in 2021 that Blackstone had bought a majority stake in Supergoop.
Sharapova also appeared as a guest shark in the American TV show &quot;Shark Tank&quot; in 2020, where she teamed up with Mark Cuban to invest in wearable wrist and ankle weights company Bala Bangles. Later in 2020, Sharapova became an investor in wellness brand therabody. Some other companies Sharapova has invested in include UFC, Tonal, Public.com, Moonpay, Clio Snacks. In April 2022, Sharapova also became a member of the Board of Directors of the fashion brand Moncler. Sharapova acts as an advisor to brands Naked Retail and Bright.

He is a member of the advisory board to the Department of Homeland Security, was a member of the Hart/Rudman Commission on National Security, and served for 16 years on the President&#x27;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. He is a member of the guiding coalition of the Project on National Security Reform. He is a member of the American Philosophical Society, the National Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Explorers Club.

In May 2009, Augustine was named as chairman of the Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee, which was tasked to review NASA&#x27;s plans for the Moon, Mars and beyond.

In March 2011, Augustine agreed to serve as chair of the U.S. Antarctic Program Blue Ribbon Panel to assess U.S. activities in the South Pole. In July 2011, Augustine became a member of the United States Energy Security Council, which seeks to diminish oil&#x27;s monopoly over the US transportation sector and is sponsored by the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security (IAGS). He currently sits on the America Abroad Media advisory board, the advisory board of Feynman School, a school for academically gifted children in STEM fields, and on the board of advisors of the Code of Support Foundation, a nonprofit military services organization.

<text>Richard Avedon (May 15, 1923 – October 1, 2004) was an American fashion and portrait photographer. He worked for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Elle&quot; specializing in capturing movement in still pictures of fashion, theater and dance. An obituary published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that &quot;his fashion and portrait photographs helped define America&#x27;s image of style, beauty and culture for the last half-century&quot;.

== Early life and education ==

Avedon was born in New York City to a Jewish family. His father, Jacob Israel Avedon, was a Russian-born immigrant who advanced from menial work to starting his own successful retail dress business on Fifth Avenue called Avedon&#x27;s Fifth Avenue. His mother, Anna, from a family that owned a dress-manufacturing business, encouraged Richard&#x27;s love of fashion and art. Avedon&#x27;s interest in photography emerged when, at age 12, he joined a Young Men&#x27;s Hebrew Association (YMHA) Camera Club. He would use his family&#x27;s Kodak Box Brownie not only to feed his curiosity about the world but also to retreat from his personal life. His father was a critical and remote disciplinarian, who insisted that physical strength, education, and money prepared one for life.

The photographer&#x27;s first muse was his younger sister, Louise. During her teen years, she struggled through psychiatric treatment, eventually becoming increasingly withdrawn from reality and diagnosed with schizophrenia. These early influences of fashion and family would shape Avedon&#x27;s life and career, often expressed in his desire to capture tragic beauty in photos.

Avedon attended DeWitt Clinton High School in Bedford Park, Bronx, where from 1937 until 1940 he worked on the school&#x27;s literary magazine, &quot;The Magpie,&quot; with James Baldwin. As a teen, he also won a Scholastic Art and Writing Award. After graduating from DeWitt Clinton that year, he enrolled at Columbia University to study philosophy and poetry but dropped out after one year. He then started as a photographer for the Merchant Marines, taking ID shots of the crewmen with the Rolleiflex camera his father had given him. From 1944 to 1950, Avedon studied photography with Alexey Brodovitch at his Design Laboratory at The New School for Social Research.

== Photography career ==

In 1944, Avedon began working as an advertising photographer for a department store, but was quickly endorsed by Alexey Brodovitch, who was art director for the world-renowned American fashion magazine &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. Lillian Bassman also promoted Avedon&#x27;s career at &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;. In 1945, his photographs began appearing in &quot;Junior Bazaar&quot; and, a year later, in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;.

In 1946, Avedon had set up his own studio and began providing images for magazines including &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Life&quot;. He became the chief photographer for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. From 1950, he also contributed photographs to &quot;Look&quot; and &quot;Graphis&quot;. In 1952, he became staff editor/photographer for &quot;Theatre Arts Magazine&quot;. However, towards the end of the 1950s, he became dissatisfied with daylight photography and open air locations and so turned to studio photography, using strobe lighting.

When Diana Vreeland left &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; for &quot;Vogue&quot; in 1962, Avedon joined her as a staff photographer. He proceeded to become the lead photographer at &quot;Vogue&quot; and photographed most of the covers from 1973 until Anna Wintour became editor in chief in late 1988.

Among his fashion advertisement series are the recurring assignments for Gianni Versace, beginning with the spring/summer campaign 1980. He also photographed the Calvin Klein Jeans campaign featuring a fifteen-year-old Brooke Shields, as well as directing her in the accompanying television commercials. Avedon first worked with Shields in 1974 for a Colgate toothpaste ad. He shot her for Versace, 12 American &quot;Vogue&quot; covers and Revlon&#x27;s Most Unforgettable Women campaign.

In the February 9, 1981, issue of &quot;Newsweek&quot;, Avedon said that &quot;Brooke is a lightning rod. She focuses the inarticulate rage people feel about the decline in contemporary morality and destruction of innocence in the world.&quot; On working with Avedon, Shields told &quot;Interview&quot; magazine in May 1992, &quot;When Dick walks into the room, a lot of people are intimidated. But when he works, he&#x27;s so acutely creative, so sensitive. And he doesn&#x27;t like it if anyone else is around or speaking. There is a mutual vulnerability, and a moment of fusion when he clicks the shutter. You either get it or you don&#x27;t&quot;.

In addition to his continuing fashion work, by the 1960s Avedon was making studio portraits of civil rights workers, politicians, and cultural dissidents of various stripes in an America fissured by discord and violence. He branched out into photographing patients of mental hospitals, the Civil Rights Movement in 1963, protesters of the Vietnam War, and later the fall of the Berlin Wall.

A personal book called &quot;Nothing Personal&quot; with a text by his high school classmate James Baldwin, appeared in 1964. It includes photographs documenting the civil rights movement, cultural figures and an extended collection of pictures of people in a mental asylum; together with Baldwin&#x27;s searing text, it makes a striking commentary on America in 1964.

During this period, Avedon also created two well known sets of portraits of The Beatles. The first, taken in mid to late 1967, consisted of five psychedelic portraits of the group — four heavily solarized individual color portraits, and a black-and-white group portrait taken with a Rolleiflex camera and a normal Planar lens. The next year, he photographed the much more restrained portraits that were included with &quot;The Beatles&quot; LP in 1968. Among the many other rock bands photographed by Avedon, in 1973, he shot Electric Light Orchestra with all the members exposing their bellybuttons for recording &quot;On the Third Day&quot;.

Avedon was always interested in how portraiture captures the personality and soul of its subject. As his reputation as a photographer became more well known, he photographed many public figures in his studio with a large-format 8×10 view camera. His subjects include Buster Keaton, Marian Anderson, Marilyn Monroe, Ezra Pound, Isak Dinesen, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Andy Warhol, and the Chicago Seven.

By eliminating the use of soft lights and props, Avedon was able to focus on the inner worlds of his subjects evoking emotions and reactions. He would at times evoke reactions from his portrait subjects by guiding them into uncomfortable areas of discussion or asking them psychologically probing questions. Through these means he would produce images revealing aspects of his subject&#x27;s character and personality that were not typically captured by others.

Avedon&#x27;s mural groupings featured emblematic figures: Andy Warhol with the players and stars of The Factory; The Chicago Seven, political radicals charged with conspiracy to incite riot at the 1968 Democratic National Convention; the Beat poet Allen Ginsberg and his extended family; and the Mission Council, a group of military and government officials who governed the United States&#x27; participation in the Vietnam War.

In 1982, Avedon produced a playfully inventive series of advertisements for fashion label Christian Dior, based on the idea of film stills. Featuring director Andre Gregory, photographer Vincent Vallarino and model/actress Kelly Le Brock, the color photographs purported to show the wild antics of a fictional &quot;Dior family&quot; living ménage à trois while wearing elegant fashions.

Avedon became the first staff photographer for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1992, where his post-apocalyptic, wild fashion fable “In Memory of the Late Mr. and Mrs. Comfort,” featuring model Nadja Auermann and a skeleton, was published in 1995. Other pictures for the magazine, ranging from the first publication, in 1994, of previously unpublished photos of Marilyn Monroe to a resonant rendering of Christopher Reeve in his wheelchair and nude photographs of Charlize Theron in 2004, were topics of wide discussion.

=== &quot;In the American West&quot; ===
Serious heart inflammations hindered Avedon&#x27;s health in 1974. The troubling time inspired him to create a compelling collection from a new perspective. In 1979, he was commissioned by Mitchell A. Wilder (1913–1979), the director of the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth, Texas, to complete the “Western Project.”

Wilder envisioned the project to portray Avedon&#x27;s take on the American West. It became a turning point in Avedon&#x27;s career when he focused on everyday working class subjects such as miners soiled in their work clothes, housewives, farmers and drifters on larger-than-life prints, instead of the more traditional options of focusing upon public figures or the openness and grandeur of the West. The project lasted five years concluding with an exhibition and a catalogue. It allowed Avedon and his crew to photograph 762 people and expose approximately 17,000 sheets of 8×10 Kodak Tri-X Pan film. The collection identified a story within his subjects of their innermost self, a connection Avedon admits would not have happened if his new sense of mortality through severe heart conditions and aging hadn&#x27;t occurred. Avedon visited and traveled through state fair rodeos, carnivals, coal mines, oil fields, slaughter houses and prisons to find subjects.

In 1994, Avedon revisited his subjects who would later speak about &quot;In the American West&quot; aftermath and its direct effects. Billy Mudd, a trucker, spent long periods of time on his own away from his family. He was a depressed, disconnected and lonely man before Avedon offered him the chance to be photographed. When he saw his portrait for the first time, Mudd saw that Avedon revealed something about him that allowed him to recognize the need for change in his life. The portrait transformed Mudd, and led him to quit his job and return to his family.

Helen Whitney&#x27;s 1996 &quot;American Masters&quot; documentary episode, &quot;Avedon: Darkness and Light,&quot; depicts an aging Avedon identifying &quot;In the American West &quot; as his best body of work.

During the production period Avedon encountered problems with size availability for quality printing paper. While he experimented with platinum printing he eventually settled on Portriga Rapid, a double-weight, fiber-based gelatin silver paper manufactured by Agfa-Gevaert. Each print required meticulous work, with an average of thirty to forty manipulations. Two exhibition sets of &quot;In the American West&quot; were printed as artist proofs, one set to remain at the Carter after the exhibition there, and the other, property of the artist, to travel to the subsequent six venues. Overall, the printing took nine months, consuming about of paper.

While &quot;In the American West&quot; is one of the Avedon&#x27;s most notable works, it has often been criticized for falsifying the West through voyeuristic themes and for exploiting his subjects. Avedon&#x27;s book was actually controversial when it was first released. Some people found it unconventional and unexpected for a book about the West, but it ended up becoming an iconic image that challenged traditional perceptions of the region. Critics question why a photographer from the East who traditionally focuses on models or public figures would go out West to capture the working class members who represent hardship and suffering. They argue that Avedon&#x27;s intentions are to influence and evoke condescending emotions from the viewer such as pity.

== Exhibitions ==
Avedon had very numerous museum exhibitions around the world, exhibitions in which he was a part of and became known for. His first major retrospective was at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts in 1970.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art (NYC) presented two solo exhibitions during his lifetime, in 1978 and 2002. In 1980, a retrospective was organized by the University Art Museum in Berkeley. Major retrospectives were mounted at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (1994), and at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humlebaek, Denmark (2007; which traveled to Milan, Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam and San Francisco, through 2009). Showing Avedon&#x27;s work from his earliest, sun-splashed pictures in 1944 to portraits in 2000 that convey his fashion fatigue, the International Center of Photography in 2009 mounted the largest survey of his fashion work. Also in 2009, the Corcoran Gallery of Art showed &quot;Richard Avedon: Portraits of Power,&quot; bringing together his political portraits for the first time.

== Art market ==
In 2010, a record price of £719,000 was achieved at Christie&#x27;s for a unique seven-foot-high print of model Dovima, posing in a Christian Dior evening dress with elephants from the Cirque d’Hiver, Paris, in 1955. This particular print, the largest of this image, was made in 1978 for Avedon&#x27;s fashion retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and was bought by Maison Christian Dior.

== Personal life ==
In 1944, Avedon married 19-year-old bank teller Dorcas Marie Nowell, who later became the model and actress Doe Avedon; they did not have children and divorced in 1949. The couple summered at the gay village of Cherry Grove, Fire Island, and Avedon&#x27;s bisexuality has been attested to by colleagues and family. He was reportedly devastated when Nowell left him.

In 1951, he married Evelyn Franklin; she died on March 13, 2004. Their marriage produced one son, John Avedon, who has written extensively about Tibet.
In 1970, Avedon purchased a former carriage house on the Upper East Side of Manhattan that would serve as both his studio and apartment. In the late 1970s, he purchased a four-bedroom house on a estate in Montauk, New York, between the Atlantic Ocean and a nature preserve; he sold it for almost $9 million in 2000.

According to Norma Stevens, Avedon&#x27;s longtime studio director, Avedon confided in her about his homosexual relationships, including a decade-long affair with director Mike Nichols.

==Death==
On October 1, 2004, Avedon died in a San Antonio, Texas, hospital of complications from a cerebral hemorrhage. He was in San Antonio shooting an assignment for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. At the time of his death, he was also working on a new project titled &quot;Democracy&quot; to focus on the run-up to the 2004 U.S. presidential election.

== Legacy ==
The Richard Avedon Foundation is a private operating foundation, structured by Avedon during his lifetime. It began its work shortly after his death in 2004. Based in New York, the foundation is the repository for Avedon&#x27;s photographs, negatives, publications, papers, and archival materials. In 2006, Avedon&#x27;s personal collection was shown at the Pace/MacGill Gallery, New York, and at the Fraenkel Gallery, San Francisco, and later sold to benefit the Avedon Foundation. The collection included photographs by Martin Munkacsi, Edward Steichen and Man Ray, among others. A slender volume, &quot;Eye of the Beholder: Photographs From the Collection of Richard Avedon&quot; (Fraenkel Gallery), assembles the majority of the collection in a boxed set of five booklets: “Diane Arbus,” “Peter Hujar”, “Irving Penn”, “The Countess de Castiglione” and “Etcetera,” which includes 19th- and 20th-century photographers.

== In popular culture ==
Hollywood presented a fictional account of Avedon&#x27;s early career in the 1957 musical &quot;Funny Face&quot;, starring Fred Astaire as the fashion photographer &quot;Dick Avery.&quot; Avedon supplied some of the still photographs used in the production, including its most noted single image: an intentionally overexposed close-up of Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s face in which only her noted features – her eyes, her eyebrows, and her mouth – are visible.

Hepburn was Avedon&#x27;s muse in the 1950s and 1960s, and he went so far as to say: &quot;I am, and forever will be, devastated by the gift of Audrey Hepburn before my camera. I cannot lift her to greater heights. She is already there. I can only record. I cannot interpret her. There is no going further than who she is. She has achieved in herself her ultimate portrait.&quot;

The 2005 film &quot;Capote&quot; contains a recreation of Avedon photographing convicted murderers Perry Edward Smith and Richard Hickock in April 1960. Avedon is portrayed by the film&#x27;s cinematographer, Adam Kimmel.

The 2015 video game &quot;Life is Strange&quot; references Avedon several times, with side character Victoria Chase calling him &quot;one of my heroes&quot; in response to being compared to him if the player chooses to be kind to her.

<text>Avondale Shipyard was an independent shipbuilding company, acquired by Litton Industries, in turn acquired by Northrop Grumman Corporation. In 2011, along with the former Ingalls Shipbuilding, the yard was part of Huntington Ingalls Industries. It closed in October 2014. The yard was located on the west bank of the Mississippi River in an area called Bridge City, about upriver from New Orleans near Westwego, Louisiana. It was the site of the modernization of the battleship in the early 1980s and also constructed some of the lighter aboard ships (LASH). At one time, it was the largest employer in Louisiana, with about 26,000 employees.

==History==
Avondale Shipyards was founded in 1938 as Avondale Marine Ways by James Grinstead Viavant, Harry Koch, and Perry N. Ellis. It was primarily a repair and barge-construction facility for craft working the Mississippi River. In 1941, the company employed only 200 workers.

They were awarded a contract to build tugboats for the United States Maritime Commission during World War II. This led to further contracts to build destroyers and destroyer escorts.

After World War II, Avondale took advantage of the expansion of the oil industry in Louisiana to build drilling barges and offshore oil rigs. They also built other commercial vessels, such as fishing boats. They again obtained government contracts to build military vessels during the Korean and Vietnam Wars.

Avondale Marine Ways was purchased by the Ogden Corporation in 1959 for $14 million. The following year, it was renamed Avondale Shipyards, Inc. The company was sold to its employees in 1985. In 1988, it became a publicly traded company, Avondale Industries, Inc. Workers voted to unionize with the New Orleans Metal Trades Council in 1993, leading to a lengthy and arduous legal battle between the workers and Avondale Industries. The Metal Trades Union eventually succeeded in 2000. The publication &quot;Bayou Worker&quot;, archived at Loyola University New Orleans, contains information related to the labor organizing efforts.

In 1998, the company won contracts worth $454.7 million for the construction of two ships by the U.S. Navy (a landing platform dock ship and the Navy&#x27;s newest amphibious assault ship).

In mid-2010, Northrop Grumman announced its intention to close the Avondale yard by 2013 and consolidate its Gulf Coast shipbuilding operations at its Pascagoula, Mississippi, yard. Northrop Grumman did a spin-off of Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding to Huntington Ingalls Inc. effective as of March 31, 2011. The Avondale yard became the Huntington Ingalls Industries Avondale Operation, a subsidiary of Huntington Ingalls Inc. In February 2013, Avondale Plant was reorganized and entered sector of oil and gas production equipment.

 was recorded as the last Navy ship to depart from the Avondale Ship Yard, on 3 February 2014.

<text>Joseph Louis Anne Marie Charles Avenol (; 9 June 1879 – 2 September 1952) was a French diplomat. He served as the second Secretary General of the League of Nations from 3 July 1933 to 31 August 1940. He was preceded by Sir Eric Drummond of the United Kingdom, who was general secretary between 1920 and 1933. He was succeeded by the Irish diplomat Seán Lester, who was general secretary between 1940 and 1946, when the League dissolved.

==League of Nations==
Avenol was sent to the League of Nations from the French Treasury Department in 1922 to handle the League&#x27;s finances. He was under secretary-general in 1933, when Eric Drummond resigned. He became secretary-general because the first secretary-general had been British and there had been a private agreement at Versailles that the next would be French. Avenol was accused of using the League as an extension of the French Foreign Office in its policy of appeasement of Germany and Italy.

Avenol took office shortly after Japan had left the League. Shortly thereafter Germany also left, and Argentina resumed full membership. He worked to prevent action or criticism of those countries in an effort to lure them back to the League. When Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935, Avenol&#x27;s main concern was to keep the Italians in the organization, not to protect Ethiopia. In 1939 he encouraged Finland to file a complaint so that the League could expel the Soviet Union.

Later Avenol described &quot;a new France, which was to be given a new soul to work in collaboration with Germany and Italy and keep the British out of Europe&quot;. He wrote to Marshal Philippe Pétain to affirm his loyalty to the Vichy government.

==Last years and death==
In the meantime, he had fired most of the League&#x27;s staff, including all of the British employees. When World War II started on 1 September 1939, Avenol had decided to leave Geneva and the League of Nations for good on 31 August 1940. His services were not accepted by the Vichy government, and he was forced to flee back into Switzerland on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1943 to avoid getting arrested by the Germans. He died at his home in Duillier, Switzerland, in 1952, aged 73.

When Seán Lester replaced him as secretary-general, the League had only 100 employees, including guards and janitors, out of its original 700. Lester managed to keep the League&#x27;s technical and humanitarian programs in limited operation for the duration of the war. In 1946 he turned over the League&#x27;s assets and functions to the newly-established United Nations.

==Honours==
In 1921, he was created an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire.
