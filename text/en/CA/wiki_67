<text>Giovanni Gentile (, ; 30 May 1875 – 15 April 1944) was an Italian philosopher, pedagogue, and politician.

He, alongside Benedetto Croce, was one of the major exponents of Italian idealism in Italian philosophy, and also devised his own system of thought, which he called &quot;actual idealism&quot; or &quot;actualism&quot;, which has been described as &quot;the subjective extreme of the idealist tradition&quot;.

Described by himself and by Benito Mussolini as the &quot;philosopher of fascism&quot;, he was influential in providing an intellectual foundation for Italian fascism, notably through writing the 1925 Manifesto of the Fascist Intellectuals, and part of the 1932 &quot;The Doctrine of Fascism&quot; with Mussolini. As Minister for Public Education, he introduced in 1923 the so-called Gentile Reform, the first major piece of legislation passed by the Fascist government, which would last in some capacity until 1962. He also helped found the Institute of the Italian Encyclopedia with Giovanni Treccani, and was its first editor.

Though his political influence waned as Mussolini sought the alliance of the Catholic Church in the late 1920s, which conflicted with Gentile&#x27;s secularism, he remained a faithful Fascist, even after the 1943 armistice with the Allies, and followed Mussolini into the Italian Social Republic. He was shot dead in 1944 by partisans of the Italian resistance.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Gentile was born in Castelvetrano, Italy. He was inspired by Risorgimento-era Italian intellectuals such as Mazzini, Rosmini, Gioberti, and Spaventa from whom he borrowed the idea of &quot;autoctisi&quot;, &quot;self-construction&quot;, but also strongly influenced and mentored by the German idealist and materialist schools of thought – namely Karl Marx, Hegel, and Fichte, with whom he shared the ideal of creating a &quot;Wissenschaftslehre&quot; (Doctrine of Science), a theory for a structure of knowledge that makes no assumptions. Friedrich Nietzsche, too, influenced him, as seen in an analogy between Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Übermensch&quot; and Gentile&#x27;s &quot;Uomo Fascista&quot;. In religion he presented himself as a Catholic (of sorts), and emphasised actual idealism&#x27;s Christian heritage; Antonio G. Pesce insists that &#x27;there is in fact no doubt that Gentile was a Catholic&#x27;, but he occasionally identified himself as an atheist, albeit one who was still &quot;culturally&quot; a Catholic.

He won a fierce competition to become one of four exceptional students of the prestigious Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, where he enrolled in the Faculty of Humanities.

In 1898 he graduated in Letters and Philosophy with a dissertation titled &quot;Rosmini e Gioberti&quot;, that he realized under the supervision of Donato Jaja, a disciple of Bertrando Spaventa.

During his academic career, Gentile served in a number of positions, including: 
* Professor of the History of Philosophy at the University of Palermo (27 March 1910);
* Professor of Theoretical Philosophy at the University of Pisa (9 August 1914);
* Professor of the History of Philosophy at the University of Rome (11 November 1917), and later as Professor of Theoretical Philosophy (1926);
* Commissioner of the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa (1928–32), and later as its Director (1932–43); and
* Vice President of Bocconi University in Milan (1934–44).

A long-time collaborator of Benedetto Croce, the two first became friends in 1896 and remained close until 1925, when Croce sided against fascism and Gentile for it with their Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals and Manifesto of the Fascist Intellectuals respectively.

===First World War===
Gentile was largely uninvolved with politics prior to the outbreak of World War One; he saw himself as a conservative liberal in the vein of Cavour, but mostly concerned himself with writing on the matters of education. Like many Italians, however, the war marked the start of more active involvement in politics, and publicly declared himself for Italy&#x27;s intervention in the war after the disastrous Battle of Caporetto in 1917, though was privately one from the outbreak of the war. He saw the war as the emergence of a new Italy, which had to fight and destroy the &quot;easy-going, idle Italy&quot;, &quot;known for its faint-hearted nature, its individualism, its poor sense of taste and its tendency to withdraw into private egoism&quot;; it was a chance to complete the Risorgimento and uphold its ideals. 

Despite his ardent support of the war, he remained staunch in his criticism of the extreme nationalists such as Enrico Corradini and the Italian Nationalist Association for their rejection of liberalism. By the end of the war in 1918, he was attacking much of the Italian political sphere: the Socialists and the Catholics of the future Popular Party for their opposition to the national state; the Vatican as a hostile independent power opposed to the existence of Italy; and the liberal trasformismo of Giovanni Giolitti and the Italian Parliament, marred by endless squabbling, and now an outdated relic in the face of the &quot;new Italy&quot; birthed by the experience of war.

Gentile was indignant at the rejection of Italy&#x27;s claims, set out in the 1915 Treaty of London, at the Paris Peace Conference. Not only did it fail to respect the hard-fought gains of the &quot;new Italy&quot;, but it encouraged fatalism, liberal back-biting, and the questioning of the ideals of intervention in the first place—that is, of the spiritual invigoration that Gentile saw as the most significant consequence of the war. As such, he would support the ultranationalist poet Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s 1919 occupation of Fiume, which was an important precursor to Fascism. Nonetheless, he continued to believe in liberal democracy and praised the new Prime Minister, Francesco Saverio Nitti, for his commitment to national economic recovery. As the post-war period wore on, Gentile saw no sign of the spiritual revolution within Italian liberal society that he had hoped for, and became increasingly disillusioned; he disengaged with active politics in 1920 and would not return to it until Benito Mussolini&#x27;s 1922 seizure of power in the March on Rome, by which point fascist doctrine was largely complete.

===Involvement with Fascism===
====Minister of Public Education, 1922–1924====

In 1922, on the recommendation of Benedetto Croce, who had refused the role himself, Gentile was named Minister for Public Education for the government of Benito Mussolini. The cabinet, though strongly right-wing, was broadly non-partisan; Gentile&#x27;s inclusion, alongside several other notable non-fascists, was taken as a sign of reconciliation and the promised return to law-and-order. He officially joined the National Fascist Party in 1923.

In his capacity as Minister for Public Education, he instituted the 1923 Gentile Reform, which was the first major reform of the education system since the Unification of Italy and the Despite lacking any substantial education policy prior to coming to power, it was the first significant piece of legislation of the Fascist regime; Mussolini described it as the &quot;most Fascist reform&quot;.

Based on philosophically idealist and conservative elitist ideas, it was designed to help form the new elite of Fascist society and to reduce the number of intellectual graduates saturating the job market.

An additional purpose of the reform was to improve the regime&#x27;s relationship with the Catholic Church. It made religious instruction mandatory in junior schools, gave equal distinction to private (notably Catholic) and state schools, and allowed both to sit the same qualification exams for entrance into higher education; these were important elements of the programme of the Catholic Popular party, and did much to shore up Catholic opinion of the Fascist regime—a long-standing problem for Italian governments due to the Roman Question—as part of a wider programme of concessions by Mussolini to the Vatican. However, it did not go far enough to completely please the Church. Complaints remained over the fact that religious teaching was neither given by priests nor extended beyond the junior schools.

Included in this reform was an attempt to limit the number of women teachers in schools, part of Italian Fascism&#x27;s wider campaign against feminism, suggesting that: 

The reform also mandated that Italian was the only language to be used in public schools, severely impacting the autonomy of non-Italian speaking minorities—known as —particularly in the regions of Alto-Adige and the Julian March, recently annexed in the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye following the First World War.

Under Gentile&#x27;s reform, the secondary school system was substantially reorganised. The technical schools (&quot;scuola technica&quot;), relied on by the middle class for educational attainment and in which pupil numbers had increased rapidly since 1900, were abolished. In their place were &quot;complementary schools&quot; (&quot;scuola complementare&quot;), general education schools which did not allow access to universities or further qualifications. Entry into particular fields, such as science and engineering, were restricted to other specialised secondary schools. The curriculum was also rearranged, emphasising the humanities and especially philosophy; teaching of Latin was also more widely introduced.

Pupil numbers were successfully reduced under Gentile&#x27;s new system. Secondary school student numbers dropped from 337,000 to 237,000 between 1923 and 1926–27, and university students by 13,000, from 53,000 in 1919–20 to 40,000 in 1928–29. Enrollment in the technical schools, and the complementary schools that replaced them, dropped by half from 1922–23 to 1923–24.

The reform, which had produced a system far more complicated than before, proved unpopular. After Gentile left his position in 1924, it would be gradually dismantled by his successors; the &quot;complementary schools&quot; were abolished in 1930, and in 1939 then-Minister for Education Giuseppe Bottai made further sweeping changes to the education system.

He resigned his position in 1924 during the Matteotti Crisis. Christopher Seton-Watson suggested it was in protest of the murder of Giacomo Matteotti; Gabriele Turi disputes this, writing instead that the purpose of his resignation was to reinforce the Fascist regime and relieve Mussolini&#x27;s cabinet of his own unpopular presence.

====After the Matteotti Crisis====
In 1925, Gentile headed two constitutional commissions that helped establish the corporate state of Fascism as part of the , and was a member of the Fascist Grand Council from 1925 to 1929.
Giovanni Gentile was described by Mussolini, and by himself, as &quot;the philosopher of Fascism&quot;; he was the ghostwriter of the first part of the essay &quot;The Doctrine of Fascism&quot; (1932), attributed to Mussolini. It was first published in 1932, in the &quot;Italian Encyclopedia&quot;, wherein he described the traits characteristic of Italian Fascism at the time: compulsory state corporatism, Philosopher Kings, the abolition of the parliamentary system, and autarky. He also wrote the &quot;Manifesto of the Fascist Intellectuals&quot; which was signed by a number of writers and intellectuals, including Luigi Pirandello, Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and Giuseppe Ungaretti.

Gentile&#x27;s political influence in the regime waned in the late 1920s. He lost favour for remarking that fascism was a minority movement and was further sidelined following the Lateran Treaty, with his anti-clericalism no longer appropriate if the regime was to maintain the support of the Catholic Church. Gentile remained loyal to Mussolini, however, and continued to support him even after the fall of the Fascist government in 1943, following him in the establishment of the Republic of Salò, a puppet state of Nazi Germany, and accepted an appointment in its government despite having criticized its anti-Jewish laws. Gentile was the last president of the Royal Academy of Italy (1943–1944).

==Death==

On 30 March 1944, Gentile received death threats blaming him for the execution of the Martyrs of Campo di Marte by Republic of Salò troops and accusing him of promoting fascism. Only two weeks later on 15 April 1944, Bruno Fanciullacci and Antonio Ignesti, both of whom belonged to the communist partisan organization Gruppi di Azione Patriottica (GAP), approached Gentile in his parked car, hiding pistols behind a book. When Gentile lowered the car window to speak to them, he was immediately hit with several bullets to the chest and heart, killing him. Fanciullacci was killed several months later as he tried to escape capture.

Gentile&#x27;s assassination divided the anti-fascist front. It was disapproved of by the Tuscan branch of the CLN with the sole exception of the Italian Communist Party, which approved the assassination and claimed responsibility for it.
Gentile was buried in the church of Santa Croce in Florence.

== Philosophy ==

Patrick Romanell, philosopher and translator of the work of Benedetto Croce, wrote that Gentile &quot;holds the honor of having been the most rigorous neo-Hegelian in the entire history of Western philosophy and the dishonor of having been the official philosopher of Fascism in Italy.&quot; Gentile&#x27;s philosophical basis for fascism was rooted in his understanding of ontology and epistemology, in which he found vindication for the rejection of individualism and acceptance of collectivism, with the state as the ultimate location of authority and loyalty outside of which individuality had no meaning (and which in turn helped justify the totalitarian dimension of fascism).

The conceptual relationship between Gentile&#x27;s actual idealism and his conception of fascism is not self-evident. The supposed relationship does not appear to be based on logical deducibility. That is, actual idealism does not entail a fascist ideology in any rigorous sense. Gentile enjoyed fruitful intellectual relations with Croce from 1899 – and particularly during their joint editorship of &quot;La Critica&quot; from 1903 to 1922 – but broke philosophically and politically from Croce in the early 1920s over Gentile&#x27;s embrace of fascism. (Croce assesses their philosophical disagreement in &quot;Una discussione tra filosofi amici&quot; in &quot;Conversazioni Critiche&quot;, II.)

Ultimately, Gentile foresaw a social order wherein opposites of all kinds were not to be considered as existing independently from each other; that &#x27;publicness&#x27; and &#x27;privateness&#x27; as broad interpretations were currently false as imposed by all former kinds of government, including capitalism and communism; and that only the reciprocal totalitarian state of corporatism, a fascist state, could defeat these problems which are made from reifying as an external reality that which is in fact, to Gentile, only a reality in thinking. Whereas it was common in the philosophy of the time to see the conditional subject as abstract and the object as concrete, Gentile postulated (after Hegel) the opposite, that the subject is concrete and the object a mere abstraction (or rather, that what was conventionally dubbed &quot;subject&quot; is in fact only conditional object, and that the true subject is the &quot;act&quot; of being or essence of the object).

Gentile was, because of his &quot;actualist&quot; system, a notable philosophical presence across Europe during his time. At its base, Gentile&#x27;s brand of idealism asserted the primacy of the &quot;pure act&quot; of thinking. This act is foundational to all human experience – it &quot;creates&quot; the phenomenal world – and involves a process of &quot;reflective awareness&quot; (in Italian, &quot;l&#x27;atto del pensiero, pensiero pensante&quot;) that is constitutive of the Absolute and revealed in education. Gentile&#x27;s emphasis on seeing Mind as the Absolute signalled his &quot;revival of the idealist doctrine of the autonomy of the mind.&quot; It also connected his philosophical work to his vocation as a teacher. In actual idealism, then, pedagogy is transcendental and provides the process by which the Absolute is revealed. His idea of a transcending truth above positivism garnered particular attention by emphasizing that all modes of sensation only take the form of ideas within one&#x27;s mind; in other words, they are mental constructs. To Gentile, for example, even the correlation of the function and location of the physical brain with the functions of the physical body was merely a consistent creation of the mind, and not of the brain (itself a creation of the mind). Observations like this have led some commentators to view Gentile&#x27;s philosophy as a kind of &quot;absolute solipsism,&quot; expressing the idea &quot;that only the spirit or mind is real&quot;.

Actual idealism also touches on ideas of concern to theology. An example of actual idealism in theology is the idea that although man may have invented the concept of God, it does not make God any less real in any possible sense, so long as God is not presupposed to exist as abstraction&quot;,&quot; and except in case qualities about what existence actually entails (i.e. being invented apart from the thinking that makes it) are presupposed. Benedetto Croce objected that Gentile&#x27;s &quot;pure act&quot; is nothing other than Schopenhauer&#x27;s will.

Therefore, Gentile proposed a form of what he called &quot;absolute Immanentism&quot; in which the divine was the present conception of reality in the totality of one&#x27;s individual thinking as an evolving, growing and dynamic process. Many times accused of solipsism, Gentile maintained his philosophy to be a Humanism that sensed the possibility of nothing beyond what was colligate in perception; the self&#x27;s human thinking, in order to communicate as immanence is to be human like oneself, made a cohesive empathy of the self-same, without an external division, and therefore not modelled as objects to one&#x27;s own thinking. Whereas solipsism would feel trapped in the realization of its solitude, actualism rejects such privation and is an expression of the only freedom which is possible within objective contingencies, where the transcendental Self does not even exist as an object, and the dialectical co-substantiation of others necessary to understand the empirical self is felt as true others when found to be the nonrelativistic subjectivity of that whole self and essentially unified with the spirit of such higher self &quot;in actu&quot;, where others can be truly known, rather than thought as windowless monads.

===Phases of his thought===
A number of developments in Gentile&#x27;s thought and career helped to define his philosophy, including:
* the definition of Actual Idealism in his work &quot;Theory of the Pure Act&quot; (1903);
* his support for the invasion of Libya (1911) and the entry of Italy into World War I (1915);
* his dispute with Benedetto Croce over the historic inevitability of Fascism;
* his role as minister of education (1922–24);
* his belief that Fascism could be made subservient to his philosophical thought, along with his gathering of influence through the work of students like Armando Carlini (leader of the so-called &quot;right Gentilians&quot;) and Ugo Spirito (who applied Gentile&#x27;s philosophy to social problems and helped codify Fascist political theory); and
* his work on the &quot;Enciclopedia Italiana&quot; (1925–43; first edition finished in 1936).

===Gentile&#x27;s definition of and vision for Fascism ===
Gentile considered Fascism the fulfilment of the Risorgimento ideals, particularly those represented by Giuseppe Mazzini and the Historical Right party.

Gentile sought to make his philosophy the basis for Fascism. However, with Gentile and with Fascism, the &quot;problem of the party&quot; existed by virtue of the fact that the Fascist &quot;party&quot;, as such, arose organically rather than from a tract or pre-established socio-political doctrine. This complicated the matter for Gentile as it left no consensus to any way of thinking among Fascists, but ironically this aspect was to Gentile&#x27;s view of how a state or party doctrine should live out its existence: with natural organic growth and dialectical opposition intact. The fact that Mussolini gave credence to Gentile&#x27;s viewpoints via Gentile&#x27;s authorship helped with an official consideration, even though the &quot;problem of the party&quot; continued to exist for Mussolini as well.

Gentile placed himself within the Hegelian tradition but also sought to distance himself from those views he considered erroneous. He criticized Hegel&#x27;s dialectic (of Idea-Nature-Spirit), and instead proposed that everything is Spirit, with the dialectic residing in the &quot;pure act&quot; of thinking. Gentile believed Marx&#x27;s conception of the dialectic to be the fundamental flaw of his application to system making. To the neo-Hegelian Gentile, Marx had made the dialectic into an external object and therefore had abstracted it by making it part of a material process of historical development. The dialectic to Gentile could only be something of human precepts, something that is an active part of human thinking. It was, to Gentile, a concrete subject and not abstract object. This Gentile expounded on how humans think in forms wherein one side of a dual opposite could not be thought of without its complement.

&quot;Upward&quot; wouldn&#x27;t be known without &quot;downward&quot; and &quot;heat&quot; couldn&#x27;t be known without &quot;cold&quot;, while each are opposites they are co-dependent for either one&#x27;s realization: these were creations that existed as dialectic only in human thinking and couldn&#x27;t be confirmed outside of which, and especially could not be said to exist in a condition external to human thought like independent matter and a world outside of personal subjectivity or as an empirical reality when not conceived in unity and from the standpoint of the human mind.

To Gentile, Marx&#x27;s externalizing of the dialectic was essentially a fetishistic mysticism. Though when viewed externally thus, it followed that Marx could then make claims to the effect of what state or condition the dialectic objectively existed in history, &quot;a posteriori&quot; of where any individual&#x27;s opinion was while comporting oneself to the totalized whole of society. i.e. people themselves could by such a view be ideologically &#x27;backwards&#x27; and left behind from the current state of the dialectic and not themselves be part of what is actively creating the dialectic as-it-is.

Gentile thought this was absurd, and that there was no &#x27;positive&#x27; independently existing dialectical object. Rather, the dialectic was natural to the state, as it is. Meaning that the interests composing the state are composing the dialectic by their living organic process of holding oppositional views within that state, and unified therein. It is the mean condition of those interests as ever they exist. Even criminality is unified as a necessary dialectic to be subsumed into the state and a creation and natural outlet of the dialectic of the positive state as ever it is.

This view (influenced by the Hegelian theory of the state) justified the corporative system, wherein the individualized and particular interests of all divergent groups were to be personably incorporated into the state (&quot;Stato etico&quot;), each to be considered a bureaucratic branch of the state itself and given official leverage. Gentile, rather than believing the private to be swallowed synthetically within the public as Marx would have it in his objective dialectic, believed that public and private were &quot;a priori&quot; identified with each other in an active and subjective dialectic: one could not be subsumed fully into the other as they already are beforehand the same. In such a manner each is the other after their own fashion and from their respective, relative, and reciprocal, position. Yet both constitute the state itself and neither are free from it, nothing ever being truly free from it, the state (as in Hegel) existing as an eternal condition and not an objective, abstract collection of atomistic values and facts of the particulars about what is positively governing the people at any given time.

<doc id="776742" wikidata="Q319912" url="?curid=776742" title="Abulfaz Elchibey">
<text>Abulfaz Gadirgulu oghlu Aliyev (; 24 June 1938 – 22 August 2000), better known as Abulfaz Elchibey (), was an Azerbaijani politician, Azerbaijani nationalist and Soviet dissident who was the first and only democratically elected President in post-Soviet Azerbaijan. He was the leader of the Azerbaijani Popular Front and played an important role in achieving Azerbaijan&#x27;s independence from the Soviet Union.

Elchibey was elected as the president of Azerbaijan in independent Azerbaijan&#x27;s first free election. He served from 17 June 1992 until his overthrow in a 24 June 1993 military coup backed by Russia that led to the installation of Heydar Aliyev as president. Elchibey&#x27;s brief rule was the only post-Soviet period in which Azerbaijan has been democratic. During his rule, Elchibey sought to dismantle the old communist system domestically, such as the planned economy and the black market. In his foreign policy, he sought to re-orient Azerbaijan to the West. However, Elchibey&#x27;s attempted reforms were put to a halt by the 1993 coup.

According to historian Audrey Altstadt, Elchibey faced several major problems during his tenure as president: &quot;the war in Nagorno-Karabagh (with loss of land and creation of refugees), inflation and related economic problems (including slow progress on an oil deal with foreign investors), and the remnants of Russian-Soviet control and influence of the old order. The most immediately pressing problem was unrest around Baku.&quot; During his tenure, Elchibey had to contend with an administration staffed by former Communists and military forces that were not under his control.

He positioned himself as a pan-Turkist while holding hostile views towards Iran and Russia.

== Biography ==

Abulfaz Aliyev studied Arabic at the Baku State University and graduated in 1957 from the Department of Arab Philology of the Faculty of Oriental Studies. He worked as a translator and later as a lecturer of history at the Baku State University. From 1963 to 1964 he lived in Egypt, working as a translator. He soon joined the Soviet dissident movement, supporting the re-establishment of Azerbaijani independence. He was arrested in 1975 on charges of defaming the Soviet Union and spent 18 months in prison. Thereafter he worked at the Institute of Manuscripts of Azerbaijan and published over 50 scientific works on oriental philosophy, history, literature and religion.

He assumed the nickname of Elchibey (Azerbaijani for &quot;noble messenger&quot;) upon his leadership of the Azerbaijani Popular Front in 1990.

== Presidency ==
=== Assumption of power ===
Elchibey&#x27;s rise to presidency came after the first round of heavy losses of Azerbaijan in the war against Armenia in the First Nagorno-Karabakh War. After the Khojaly Massacre (26–27 February 1992), the fall of Shusha (8 May 1992) and Lachin (15–17 May 1992), the temporary Azerbaijani communist establishment led by Yaqub Mammadov could no longer hold power. Amidst disorder on the frontline, former Azerbaijani president Ayaz Mutalibov attempted a comeback two months after his resignation in a parliamentary coup on 14 May 1992, resulting in public outrage and the military overthrow of Mutalibov by the Azerbaijani Popular Front in Baku on 15 May 1992.

The national presidential election with 7 candidates was held on 7 June 1992 in which Elchibey was elected the President of Azerbaijan, gaining 54% of votes and becoming Azerbaijan&#x27;s first democratically elected, non-communist president.

=== Domestic policies ===
==== Military and security policy ====
During the summer of 1992, Elchibey secured the full withdrawal of the Soviet 4th Army and other elements of the Transcaucasus Military District from Azerbaijan, which became the first former Soviet republic (after the Baltic states) free of Soviet military presence. At the same time, Elchibey&#x27;s government established the national Azerbaijani Navy and managed to reach an agreement with Russia on receiving one-quarter of the Soviet Caspian Flotilla based in Baku. Upon his election, Elchibey appointed Isgandar Hamidov, a police colonel and the leader of the newly established Grey Wolves movement in Azerbaijan, as the Minister of Interior. Hamidov, despite his personal devotion and contributions in capturing Agdere district of Azerbaijan, proved to be generally incompetent and resigned in April 1993 after the fall of Kalbajar.

==== Karabakh ====
In June 1992, the Azerbaijani army started a counter-offensive codenamed Operation Goranboy in Nagorno-Karabakh, establishing control of over 40% of the region by the fall of 1992 and approaching within 7 kilometers of Shusha. However, as the Azerbaijani offensive pushed further into Karabakh, it became further bogged down in controversy, mismanagement, corruption and treachery by Elchibey-appointed Defense Minister Rahim Gaziyev, along with the guerilla tactics of the NKR Army in mountain warfare. This led to unexpectedly heavy Azeri casualties, loss of heavy military equipment, and the campaign ending in failure.

===Foreign policy===
On 18 August 1992, Elchibey signed a decree on Azerbaijan&#x27;s entry into the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. On 7 and 8 September 1992, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visited Baku on an unofficial visit as a guest of Elchibey. During her visit, she oversaw the signing ceremony of an agreement between Azerbaijan, BP and Statoil on exploratory work at the Chirag oilfield. In this respect, one of Elchibey&#x27;s goals in inviting Thatcher was to attract foreign entrepreneurs looking to do business in Azerbaijan. During a reception at the Gulustan Palace, he described Thatcher as being one who played a role in Azerbaijan achieving independence, saying that &quot;she can see the fruits of the tree she planted&quot;.

====Turkey====
In 1992, during a visit to the Turkish capital of Ankara, Elchibey described himself as a soldier of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (founder and the first president of Turkish Republic). He also held some pan-Turanian views, for which he enjoyed the support of the leader of the Turkish Nationalist Movement Party, Colonel Alparslan Türkeş. In April 1993, he attended the funeral of President Turgut Özal in Istanbul, a person who shared his beliefs for a potential Turkic union from the former Soviet Union.

====Russia====
During his one-year rule, Azerbaijani–Russian relations were damaged, with his politics being described in this regard as &quot;anti-Russian.&quot; He was noted for using an interpreter when speaking to Russian figures, despite being fluent in the Russian language as he was educated in the USSR. Often teasing the Russian leadership, he once declared that among the Russians who did the greatest services to democracy was Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaimiev and in a congratulatory telegram sent in connection with the adoption of a new Tatar constitution, Elchibey wrote that &quot;the heroic Tatar people&quot; have contributed to the &quot;awakening and revival of the Turkic world&quot;. On 12 September 1992, he paid a visit to Moscow, during which he signed, along with Boris Yeltsin, the Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Security between the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Russian Federation.

====Iran====
Elchibey was described as being &quot;vehemently anti-Iranian&quot; in his policies, this being due in part to their perception of an Iranian–Armenian alliance. Elchibey endorsed the unification of Azerbaijan with the region that is known as Iranian Azerbaijan, a stance which alienated the Iranian government. During a visit to Turkey, he called for the downfall of the Iranian Islamic Republic, which prompted a member of the Iranian parliament to threaten retaliation against the Republic of Azerbaijan.

====Other states====
Elchibey paid a visit to Ukraine on 12 November 1992, during which he said that, from the former republics of the Soviet Union, relations with Ukraine would be prioritized by Azerbaijan.

=== Downfall ===

On 9 June 1993, as rebellious troops were advancing onto Baku, President Elchibey invited Heydar Aliyev, former Soviet Politburo member and then head of Nakhchivan (and no relation to Elchibey, whose real surname was Aliyev), to Baku for negotiations with Surat Huseynov. Aliyev quickly took control of the power, becoming the Chairman of the Azerbaijani parliament on 15 June 1993 and offering the prime ministership of the country to Huseynov. Nine days later, in the vacuum of power left by Elchibey&#x27;s departure to Nakhchivan, Aliyev constitutionally assumed presidential powers in his capacity as parliament speaker. He signed the Bishkek Protocol to cease hostilities on the frontline, and further solidified his power by organizing impeachment hearings and holding a national referendum on 29 August 1993, which formally stripped Elchibey of the presidency.

In another national election, on 3 October 1993, Heydar Aliyev was elected as president of Azerbaijan with 99% of the votes.

==Post-presidency and death==
During Aliyev&#x27;s presidency, Elchibey returned to Baku in 1997 and joined the opposition as the leader of Azerbaijani Popular Front Party.

In 2000, Elchibey was diagnosed with prostate cancer and died in August of the same year in a military hospital in Ankara, Turkey. His body was flown to Baku and given the state funeral at the Alley of Honor with special attendance by then-President Heydar Aliyev.

The Elchibey Institute in Azerbaijan was created on 17 November 2020 in Baku with the aim to promote the national ideology and policies of Elchibey.

<doc id="776763" wikidata="Q918727" url="?curid=776763" title="Revue">
<text>A revue is a type of multi-act popular theatrical entertainment that combines music, dance, and sketches. The revue has its roots in 19th century popular entertainment and melodrama but grew into a substantial cultural presence of its own during its golden years from 1916 to 1932. Though most famous for their visual spectacle, revues frequently satirized contemporary figures, news or literature. Similar to the related subforms of operetta and musical theatre, the revue art form brings together music, dance and sketches to create a compelling show. In contrast to these, however, revue does not have an overarching storyline. Rather, a general theme serves as the motto for a loosely related series of acts that alternate between solo performances and dance ensembles.

Owing to high ticket prices, publicity campaigns and the occasional use of material, the revue was typically patronized by audience members who earned more and felt even less restricted by middle-class social norms than their contemporaries in vaudeville. Like much of that era&#x27;s popular entertainments, revues often featured material based on sophisticated, irreverent dissections of topical matter, public personae and fads, though the primary attraction was found in the frank display of the female body.

== Etymology ==
Revue comes from the French word for &quot;review,&quot; as in a &quot;show presenting a review of current events.&quot;

George Lederer&#x27;s &quot;The Passing Show&quot; (1894) is usually held to be the first successful American &quot;review.&quot; The English spelling was used until 1907 when Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. popularized the French spelling. &quot;Follies&quot; is now sometimes (incorrectly) employed as an analog for &quot;revue,&quot; though the term was proprietary to Ziegfeld until his death in 1932. Other popular proprietary revue names included George White&#x27;s &quot;Scandals,&quot; Earl Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Vanities&quot; and John Murray Anderson&#x27;s Greenwich Village Follies.

== Origin ==
Revues are most properly understood as having amalgamated several theatrical traditions within the corpus of a single entertainment. Minstrelsy&#x27;s olio section provided a structural map of popular variety presentation, while literary travesties highlighted an audience hunger for satire. Theatrical extravaganzas, in particular, moving panoramas, demonstrated a vocabulary of the spectacular. Burlesque, itself a bawdy hybrid of various theatrical forms, lent to classic revue an open interest in female sexuality and the masculine gaze.

==Golden age==
Revues enjoyed great success on Broadway from the World War I years until the Great Depression, when the stock market crash forced many revues from cavernous Broadway houses into smaller venues. (The shows did, however, continue to infrequently appear in large theatres well into the 1950s.) The high ticket prices of many revues helped ensure audiences distinct from other live popular entertainments during their height of popularity (late 1910s–1940s). In 1914, the &quot;Follies&quot; charged $5.00 for an opening night ticket ($130 in 2020 dollars); at that time, many cinema houses charged from $0.10 to 0.25, while low-priced vaudeville seats were $0.15. Among the many popular producers of revues, Florenz Ziegfeld played the greatest role in developing the classical revue through his glorification of a new theatrical &quot;type&quot;, &quot;the American girl&quot;. Famed for his often bizarre publicity schemes and continual debt, Ziegfeld joined Earl Carroll, George White, John Murray Anderson, and the Shubert Brothers as the leading producing figure of the American revue&#x27;s golden age. Revues also had a presence in Germany during the 1930s and 1940s, with films such as &quot;Frau meiner Träume&quot; being made. 

Revues took advantage of their high revenue stream to lure away performers from other media, often offering exorbitant weekly salaries without the unremitting travel demanded by other entertainments. Performers such as Eddie Cantor, Anna Held, W. C. Fields, Bert Williams, Ed Wynn, the Marx Brothers and the Fairbanks Twins found great success on the revue stage. One of Cole Porter&#x27;s early shows was Raymond Hitchcock&#x27;s revue &quot;Hitchy-Koo of 1919&quot;. Composers or lyricists such as Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart, Irving Berlin, and George M. Cohan also enjoyed a tremendous reception on the part of audiences. Sometimes, an appearance in a revue provided a key early entry into entertainment. Largely due to their centralization in New York City and their adroit use of publicity, revues proved particularly adept at introducing new talents to the American theatre. Rodgers and Hart, one of the great composer/lyricist teams of the American musical theatre, followed up their early Columbia University student revues with the successful &quot;Garrick Gaieties&quot; (1925). Comedian Fanny Brice, following a brief period in burlesque and amateur variety, bowed to revue audiences in Ziegfeld&#x27;s &quot;Follies of 1910&quot;. Specialist writers and composers of revues have included Sandy Wilson, Noël Coward, John Stromberg, George Gershwin, Earl Carroll, and the British team Flanders and Swann. In Britain predominantly, Tom Arnold also specialized in promoting series of revues and his acts extended to the European continent and South Africa.

== Film revues ==
With the introduction of talking pictures, in 1927, studios immediately began filming acts from the stage. Such film shorts gradually replaced the live entertainment that had often accompanied cinema exhibition. By 1928, studios began planning to film feature-length versions of popular musicals and revues from the stage. The lavish films, noted by many for a sustained opulence unrivaled in Hollywood until the 1950s epics, reached a breadth of audience never found by the stage revue, all while significantly underpricing the now-faltering theatrical shows. A number of revues were released by the studios, many of which were filmed entirely (or partly) in color. The most notable examples of these are &quot;The Show of Shows&quot; (Warner Brothers, 1929), &quot;The Hollywood Revue of 1929&quot; (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1929), &quot;Fox Movietone Follies of 1929&quot; (Fox Film Corporation, 1929), &quot;Paramount on Parade&quot; (Paramount, 1930), &quot;New Movietone Follies of 1930&quot; (Fox, 1930), and &quot;King of Jazz&quot; (Universal, 1930). Even Britain jumped on the bandwagon and produced expensive revues such as &quot;Harmony Heaven&quot; (British International Pictures, 1929), &quot;Elstree Calling&quot; (BIP, 1930), and &quot;The Musical Revue Of 1959&quot; (BI
P, 1960).

== Contemporary revues ==
Revues are often common today as student entertainment (with strong traditions in many universities in UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Norway and Denmark). These use pastiche, in which contemporary songs are re-written in order to comment on the college or courses in a humorous nature. While most comic songs will only be heard within the revue they were written for, sometimes they become more widely known—such as &quot;A Transport of Delight&quot;, about the big red London bus, by Flanders and Swann, who first made their name in a revue titled &quot;At the Drop of a Hat&quot;.

The Rolling Thunder Revue was a famed U.S. concert tour in the mid-1970s consisting of a traveling caravan of musicians, headed by Bob Dylan, that took place in late 1975 and early 1976.
Towards the end of the 20th century, a subgenre of revue largely dispensed with the sketches, founding narrative structure within a song cycle in which the material is culled from varied works. This type of revue may or may not have identifiable characters and a rudimentary storyline but, even when it does, the songs remain the focus of the show (for example, &quot;Closer Than Ever&quot; by Richard Maltby Jr. and David Shire). This type of revue usually showcases songs written by a particular composer or songs made famous by a particular performer. Examples of the former are &quot;Side By Side By Sondheim&quot; (music/lyrics Stephen Sondheim), &quot;Eubie!&quot; (Eubie Blake) &quot;Tom Foolery&quot; (Tom Lehrer), and &quot;Five Guys Named Moe&quot; (songs made popular by Louis Jordan). The eponymous nature of these later revues suggest a continued embrace of a unifying authorial presence in this seemingly scattershot genre, much as was earlier the case with Ziegfeld, Carrol, &quot;et al&quot;.

With different artistic emphases, the revue genre is today above all upheld at traditional variety theatres such as the Le Lido, Moulin Rouge and Friedrichstadt-Palast Berlin, as well as in shows in Las Vegas.

==University and Medics&#x27; Revues==
It is a current and longstanding tradition of medical, dental, engineering, legal and veterinary schools within the UK, Canada, New Zealand and Australia to stage revues each year, combining comedy sketches, songs, parodies, films and sound-bites. As well as performing at their home universities, British revues are sometimes also performed at festivals such as the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

=== United Hospitals Comedy Revue - The Moira Stuart Cup ===
The Moira Stuart Cup is competed for annually at the United Hospitals Comedy Revue, by all five of the University of London Medical Schools. It has been won by all medical schools at least once, with RUMS (UCL Medical School) and St George&#x27;s Hospital Medical School achieving the most victories, winning the trophy six times each. The cup is not officially endorsed by Moira Stuart herself.

<text>William Henry Elder (March 22, 1819 – October 31, 1904) was an American Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of Natchez from 1857 to 1880 and as Archbishop of Cincinnati from 1883 until his death.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===

William Elder was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on March 22, 1819. His father, Basil Elder, was a descendant of William Elder (1681–1714), a Catholic immigrant from England to Maryland (United States) in colonial times. His grandfather was Thomas Elder, husband of Elizabeth Spalding, thus making William a first cousin once removed of Catherine Spalding, co-founder of the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth. His mother was Elisabeth Miles (née Snowden) Elder.

In 1831, Elder entered Mount St. Mary&#x27;s College, in Emmitsburg, Maryland. He graduated in 1837 and entered the seminary. And in 1842, he was sent to the Pontifical Urban College in Rome, where he received the degree of Doctor of Divinity. There Elder was ordained a priest in Rome on March 29, 1846. He became a professor at the seminary in Emmitsburg, Maryland.

===Bishop of Natchez===

Elder was appointed on January 9, 1857, by Pope Pius IX to succeed James Oliver Van de Velde as bishop of the Diocese of Natchez. He was consecrated in the cathedral of Baltimore by Archbishop Francis Kenrick on May 3, 1857. The diocese comprised the entire state of Mississippi. 

On the eve of the American Civil War, Elder wrote to his father: 
It is hard to tell what is to be the fate of the country. I have not enough of political sagacity to see what will be the course of events, nor what would be the fruit of the remedies proposed. . . . We can all unite in praying to God to guide and protect us.

Elder celebrated Mass for the wounded and ministered to soldiers and freedmen gathered in Natchez. He sent priests to serve as chaplains in the Confederate States Army and Sisters of Mercy to nurse the sick and wounded, and he gave his blessing to a Natchez volunteer company.

During the Union occupation of Natchez, Elder caused some controversy for refusing to obey an order to have prayers for the President of the United States recited publicly in the churches of his diocese. On June 18, 1864, Colonel B.G. Farrar, commander at Natchez, and former schoolmate of Elder&#x27;s at Mt. St. Mary&#x27;s, issued an order requiring the clergy to include prayers for the President of the United States in their services, as a &quot;public recognition of allegiance under which they live, and to which they are indebted for protection...&quot; Elder responded with a lengthy letter of protest in which he explained that his declining to submit had no political significance, but the &quot;Liberty of the Church to discharge her divine functions, without interference form other persons.&quot; Brigadier General James Tuttle issued an order for enforcement, which was stayed at Elder&#x27;s request, pending input from the War Department. Elder wrote to President Abraham Lincoln explaining that his refusal was based on the authority of the church to regulate church services. Senator Francis Kernan responded, saying he had met with Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton and Stanton indicated that he would communicate to Tuttle to remedy the situation so there would be no further interference. Elder subsequently wrote thanking Stanton for the protection extended to religious freedom, and asking that the ruling be made known to other commanders.

When Colonel Farrar was placed in command of Natchez, he noted Tuttle&#x27;s order had neither been rescinded nor was being obeyed. General Mason Brayman, the next commander, took a harder stance, saying &quot;...military orders are to be followed, not discussed...&quot; and issued an order for Elder to be sent to jail in Vidalia, Louisiana. Federal troops took Elder to Vidalia for a few weeks. After Washington officials intervened, Brayman ordered the release of Elder on August 12, 1864.

During his time in Natchez, a yellow fever epidemic broke out in 1878. Ministering to the sick, Elder caught the disease. He survived but lost six diocesan priests. At the time he arrived in Natchez the diocese had eleven missions (churches), nine priests and 10,000 Catholics. When he left, there were forty-one churches, 25 priests, six religious houses for men, five convents, thirteen parish schools and 12,500 Catholics.

===Archbishop of Cincinnati===
On January 30, 1880, Elder was appointed coadjutor archbishop with the right of succession, to Archbishop John Purcell, for the Archdiocese of Cincinnati. Elder automatically succeeded on July 4, 1883. He became archbishop at a time of great financial difficulty in the archdiocese. Elder systematically organized the administration of the diocese. He reopened Mount Saint Mary Seminary in 1887, which had been closed since 1879. He instituted the office of chancellor of the diocese and insisted on annual reports from clergy and parishes in order to bring the diocese out of great debt.

=== Death and legacy ===
Elder died in Cincinnati on October 31, 1904, from influenza. Elder High School, a Cincinnati parochial school, was named for Elder.

<text>Free Comic Book Day (FCBD) is an annual promotional effort by the North American comic book industry to attract new readers to independent comic book stores. It usually takes place on the first Saturday of May and has historically been cross-promoted with the release of a superhero film. Over two thousand participating stores give away millions of comic books annually. The event was proposed by Joe Field in the August 2001 issue of &quot;Comics &amp; Games Retailer&quot; magazine and Free Comic Book Day was launched in 2002, coordinated by the industry&#x27;s single large distributor, Diamond Comic Distributors. FCBD has become an official Children&#x27;s Book Week event and has inspired similar events for German- and Dutch-language comics industries. The twenty-second edition of FCBD was held on May 4, 2024.

==Organization==
FCBD is organized and facilitated by Diamond Comics Distributors, guided by a committee representing publishers, industry journalists, retailers, and its own management. This committee selects the titles from publishers with the aim of providing a wide variety of what the industry has to offer. The committee also investigates potential dates for the event which are then decided upon by a vote among retailers. 

Publishers subsidize the production of the give-away comic books and retailers pay a reduced price for the books that they order. Titles are divided by sponsorship level, price, age rating, and anticipated demand into two tiers; participating retailers are required to carry all titles from the top tier, and may carry any or none of the second-tier titles. In 2007, the costs to the retailer were 12 to 24 cents per copy for the top tier and as high as 50 cents for the second tier. The minimum buy-in is about .

==History==
Free Comic Book Day was conceived by Joe Field, a California-based comics retailer, event promoter and partner in WonderCon. In 2001, Field noted how successful feature films based on comic book franchises were providing the comic book industry with a positive cultural and financial turnaround from the speculator bust of the mid-1990s. Inspired by Free Scoop Night at the Baskin-Robbins ice cream parlor next to his store, Field proposed Free Comic Book Day in his August 2001 &quot;Big Picture&quot; column in &quot;Comics &amp; Games Retailer&quot; magazine. The column received positive reaction and Image Comics co-founder Jim Valentino suggested having the first FCBD coincide with the opening weekend of the 2002 &quot;Spider-Man&quot; feature film, in order to take advantage of the film&#x27;s heavy promotion and related press about the comic book medium. The first event was held May 4, 2002, the day after the film&#x27;s opening, and its first four free comic books were Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #1 (a reprint of its issue published in 2000), Dark Horse Comics&#x27; one-shot &quot;Star Wars Tales: A Jedi&#x27;s Weapon&quot;, Image Comics/Top Cow Productions&#x27; one-shot &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; # and the first issue of DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Justice League Adventures&quot; comic book (based on the &quot;Justice League&quot; animated television series). The event has usually been held on the first Saturday in May, and is often cross-promoted with the release of the first big-budget superhero film of the summer.

According to Diamond Comic Distributors, over 2,000 stores participated in the inaugural Free Comic Book Day and gave away more than 2 million comic books from 4 publishers. The following year, 29 publishers participated. FCBD 2012 exceeded one million attendees, with over 3.5 million comics given away. In 2015, 2,340 retailers ordered 5.6 million comic books to give away.
While giving out free comic books on FCBD, participating retailers often run additional promotions. This can include sales on selected merchandise, creator signings, prize raffles, cosplay contests, charity drives, karaoke, and art exhibitions. The event quickly grew to become a major celebration of comic book culture and fan clubs may volunteer to support local stores and help manage the crowds of people attracted to the event. Cosplayers may be enlisted to entertain the lines outside the stores and pose for photos.

Among some retailers, FCBD has been more grandly organized. An FCBD &quot;shop hop&quot; cross-promotion in London, Ontario, Canada, encourages people to visit five downtown comic shops for entry into a prize draw, and has evolved into a street festival. Cosplayers parade along the street, which is chalked with murals, and many other businesses along the route cater to the theme. Mesa, Arizona, and Portsmouth, England, have each expanded FCBD into a two-day comics convention.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused the cancellation of FCBD 2020. Alt Free Comic Days was held online on that weekend, streaming panel discussions with comics creators and artists. In mid-June, Diamond Comics announced that the planned titles would be released weekly as Free Comic Book Summer from July 15 to September 9. In 2021, FCBD was held on August 14, when COVID-19 restrictions had eased somewhat. That year&#x27;s event was received as a big day for fans in the absence of comic book conventions and other major gatherings. However, delays in shipping led to the event being postponed for overseas retailers. From the twentieth anniversary edition of the event, held May 7, 2022, FCBD returned to the first Saturday in May.

== Events ==
==Products==

The goal of the promotion is to showcase the breadth of the comics industry by putting comic books in the hands of people who might not otherwise read comics, or comic readers who might not otherwise read those titles. At least 50 titles were available on FCBD each year from 2014 to 2018. Most of the FCBD comic books are produced specifically for the promotion, and can become collector items. On some occasions, retailers have partnered with publishers to make custom covers exclusive to their stores.

Most books are complete 32-page single-issue stories serving as an introduction point for newcomers. These may be in the form of a &quot;zero issue&quot; prelude to a new story arc. There have also been flip-books with two separate stories, or samplers with a number of short pieces. Non-fiction titles have included collectors&#x27; guides, art books, biographies of prominent creators, and histories of the comics industry. For 2020, age ratings were added to identify all-ages, teen, and mature content. Stores may also be provided with posters or other merchandise to give away in cross-promotions with associated films.

==Reception==
The first Free Comic Book Day (and organizer Joe Field) was given a Lulu of the Year award in 2003 by Friends of Lulu, an organization dedicated to increasing the participation of girls and women in the comics industry.

According to organizers, in the 2010s each year&#x27;s event brought about one million people to comic shops and gave away about five million comics. Marc Nix of IGN called FCBD a &quot;wonderful comic nerd holiday&quot; and F. Andrew Taylor of the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; said it was like &quot;a combination of Christmas, Halloween and Burning Man&quot; to fans. Scott Thill of &quot;Wired&quot; wrote that &quot;Free culture has rarely paid off so handsomely, for fans or publishers.&quot; Diamond Comics reported that media coverage of the 2014 event was equivalent to $3.2 million in publicity.

There have been criticisms of the focus on the event, questioning whether centering promotions at comic book shops is the best way to reach new comic book readers. Other criticisms center around the selection of titles and their cost to retailers. Many retailers only order the titles they know are marketable at their stores, and are reluctant to invest in promoting titles they cannot sell for the rest of the year. This results in the promotion of the same titles that customers are already reading instead of exposing them to new titles. The number of titles has also caused concern for some retail staff and journalists, who find it challenging to gain familiarity with all 50 to 60 titles to make recommendations.

==Related events==

 was launched in 2010 and is held in comics shops in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland on the Saturday following FCBD. Nearly 20 publishers participate, with about 35 titles offered for free.

The Netherlands and Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium) have also observed Free Comic Book Day, beginning on May 5, 2012.

Halloween ComicFest is an annual promotion launched by Diamond Comics in 2012, held roughly six months from FCBD on the Saturday before Halloween, promoting titles themed to that holiday. Each year there are about 20 full-sized free titles and another 10 mini-comics which can be purchased in packs for trick-or-treaters. In 2016, about 2 million comics were given away by 1,900 shops. Costume contests are held by some retailers, and online via the event&#x27;s website.

Local Comic Shop Day (LCSD) is an annual promotion begun in 2015 by North American trade association ComicsPRO, and held annually in late November. Approximately 20 LCSD special edition comic books are offered each year, with retailers often having Black Friday discounts on merchandise. This event has been compared to FCBD and Record Store Day.

Children&#x27;s Book Week (CBW), organized by American non-profit Every Child a Reader, was moved to May in 2008. FCBD was named as an official CBW event, launching Children&#x27;s Book Week, and the two organizations partner in promoting child literacy. In 2015, FCBD carried the literacy guide &quot;Raising A Reader! How Comics &amp; Graphic Novels Can Help Your Kids Love to Read!&quot; among its free titles.

Inspired by Free Comic Book Day, the pen-and-paper roleplaying game industry started Free RPG Day on June 15, 2007. It is a moveable event held on the third Saturday in June.

<doc id="776786" wikidata="Q7600471" url="?curid=776786" title="Staples Corner">
<text>Staples Corner is a major road junction in London, United Kingdom. It is about north-west from Charing Cross and directly to the west of the Brent Cross crossover. It is within the Brent Cross Cricklewood new town.

It has two linked roundabouts and flyovers, which connect the A406 North Circular Road with the A5 Edgware Road and the start of the M1 motorway. Also running through Staples Corner, between the two roundabouts, is the Midland Main Line and Thameslink railway line.

Since 10 December 2023, it is served by Brent Cross West railway station.

==Construction==

The Staples Corner junction was built in accordance with plans from the 1960s to continue the M1 further south to West Hampstead. These proposals, part of the London Ringways Plan, would have seen a three level junction with the M1 as the middle level crossing above the roundabout on a flyover and passing under the A406 flyover. South of the junction the motorway would have headed through Cricklewood on an elevated roadway to meet the North Cross Route section of the London Motorway Box (Ringway 1) at an elevated Y-shaped junction. Most of the Ringways Plan including the North Cross Route was cancelled in 1973. The A406 flyover opened on 18 August 1976.

Staples Corner is named after the Staples Mattress factory, which was at the road junction from 1926 to 1986. Harold Heal commissioned the designing and building of the factory.

==Incidents==

On 28 October 1988, two Up (southbound) Class 31 (31202 and 31226) locomotives rolled off together from Cricklewood depot together along a short siding and after demolishing the buffer stop they ran down the embankment on to the North Circular Road, although nobody was hurt. The second loco of the pair landed on the roof of the leading one, remaining precariously balanced. They were both withdrawn after the incident. The locomotives were unmanned, with the cause of the incident being a failure to apply brakes correctly.

On 11 April 1992, a Provisional IRA 100 lb van bomb devastated Staples Corner, causing serious damage to roads and nearby buildings and the closure of the junction (see 1992 Staples Corner bombing). Another bomb exploded near the junction on 8 October 1993, causing damage but no injuries.

The B&amp;Q DIY store damaged by the bomb (on the site of the original mattress factory) was demolished, and replaced by a branch of Staples office supplies. Staples stayed at the site until 2017, when the retailer closed all its UK physical stores. There is a large retail park at Staples Corner, located between the A5 and the railway line. Close by is the Brent Cross Shopping Centre, named after the A406 and A41 road junction.

The format of the Staples Corner junction was modified during the reconstruction works necessitated by the bombings. An additional sliproad onto the M1 from the east was added to remove the need for traffic coming from that direction to travel around the roundabout to access the motorway.

==Redevelopment==

In early 2008, a planning application was submitted to develop the Brent Cross area into a new town centre, on both sides of the North Circular Road. The Staples Corner junction would be completely redesigned, with no south-bound A5 to west-bound North Circular Road travel, and no east-bound North Circular to south-bound A5 travel possible, except by using new roads at the eastern side of the M1 motorway junction.

<doc id="776796" wikidata="Q16852744" url="?curid=776796" title="Knott family">
<text>The Knott family of lighthouse keepers is credited with the longest period of continuous service in the history of staffed lighthouses, commencing in 1730 at South Foreland, Kent, with William Knott and ending in 1906 at Skerries (Anglesey, Wales) with Henry Thomas Knott (son of George Knott – see below) who died in 1910 having retired to Crewe. There are three famous lighthouse-keeping families in England, the other two being the Darling (see: Grace Darling) and the Hall families. The three families are inter-related.

==South Foreland==
Much of the contribution of the Knott family to lighthouse keeping was made at South Foreland Lighthouse where members oversaw many changes in lighting technology from coal fires to electricity. Two fixed white lights were exhibited as a &#x27;high&#x27; and a &#x27;low&#x27; light from the South Foreland from 1634. These were simple coal fires until 1793, during the time of William&#x27;s service from 1730 and Henry&#x27;s from 1777. In 1793, 53 cm (21-inch) diameter parabolic reflectors were used to concentrate and direct the light from burning sperm oil. In 1842/3 the towers of both lighthouses were partly rebuilt and the keepers and their families at both lighthouses benefitted from entirely new accommodation. Henry Thomas and his sons, George and John, were present in the late 1850s when Michael Faraday and Professor Holmes carried out the first experiments with electricity as a light source. Much work on the electrification of the lights continued from 1869.

==Henry Knott==
During Henry Knott&#x27;s period of service, in 1813, the great Scottish lighthouse engineer, Robert Stevenson paid a visit to the Forelands as part of one of his famous inspection tours. He wrote, &quot;Find the South and North Foreland lights to be fitted up in the modern style with from 12 to 14 plated reflectors in each lightroom which were not thoroughly cleaned and some reflectors were in rather a dirty state. The lightkeepers are comfortably lodged and seem to be well pleased with their situations. The dwelling houses partake of that cleanliness which is general in the cottages of the English.&quot;

==George Knott==
George Knott was the fourth in the succession. After serving under his father at the South Foreland low lighthouse, he was transferred in 1861 to the Smeaton tower on the Eddystone where he remained for five years as Principal Keeper. From there he moved to the little-known Bideford lighthouse where he remained until 1879 when he became Principal keeper of the newly opened Bull Point lighthouse. The final appointment of his career was at North Foreland, from where he retired. George was famous for his wonderful models of the lights in which he served. Models of Smeaton&#x27;s tower, Bull Point and North Foreland still exist. The model of Bull Point is owned by Plymouth Museums. The North Foreland model is in a private collection. He made two models of Smeaton&#x27;s Eddystone Lighthouse. The models were perfect in every detail, both inside and out. Fortunately, one has been preserved and is on display at the Chatham Historic Dockyard Museum. The other model was for many years on display at Trinity House where it was destroyed in 1941 during the Blitz.

==Henry Thomas Knott==
Henry Thomas Knott (born 1851) worked through the replacement of colza oil by paraffin and the consequent replacement of old Argand burners with lamps having multiple wicks and then the even brighter incandescent oil burner which converted liquid oil into vapour before combustion. The life of a lighthouse keeper was a dangerous one. Whilst painting the roof of the Skerries lighthouse, Henry slipped on wet paint and almost somersaulted off the roof onto the rocks some 25 metres (80 feet) below. He managed to save himself when his clothing became hooked onto an iron stay. On another occasion, Henry bravely carried out the rescue of the crew of a small vessel, even though his small rowing boat was in constant danger of itself being smashed onto the rocks. Henry served out many appointments, one of which was a three-year overseas appointment in the extremely remote lighthouse on Minicoy Island in the Indian Ocean.

==Edmond Horton Knott==
South Foreland lighthouse was also the site of experiments in radio communication by Marconi from 1898. This coincided with the service of the final member of the Knott lighthouse keepers, Edmond Horton who was keeper from 1899–1902. In March and April 1899, radio transmissions from South Foreland were of great assistance in the distress of at least two vessels on the Goodwin Sands.

==Links to other lighthouse keeper families==
The Knott family is linked to the Hall family of lighthouse keepers via the marriage (Holyhead 1877) of Henry Thomas Knott (born 1845) to Ellen Margaret Hall (born 1847 Dale, Pembs) daughter of John Hall (born 1810 Dale, Pembs) keeper of St. Ann&#x27;s Low Light. The Knott family is also linked to the Darling Family of Lighthouse Keepers via the marriage of Thomas Owen Hall (born Dale, Pembs 1840) (Son of John Hall (born 1810 Dale, Pembs) keeper of St. Ann&#x27;s Low Light) to Grace Horsley Darling (born Bamburgh 1844) (daughter of William Darling (born 1806 Bamburgh) Keeper of Farne Island Lighthouse) and niece of Grace Darling.

<text>[[Athlon]] is a family of CPUs designed by AMD, targeted mostly at the desktop market. The name &quot;Athlon&quot; has been largely unused as just &quot;Athlon&quot; since 2001 when AMD started naming its processors Athlon XP, but in 2008 began referring to single core 64-bit processors from the AMD Athlon X2 and AMD Phenom product lines. Later the name began being used for some APUs.

==Notes==
Note 1:
Athlons use a double data rate (DDR) front-side bus, (EV-6) meaning that the actual data transfer rate of the bus is twice its physical clock rate. The FSB&#x27;s true data rate, 200 or 266 MT/s, is used in the tables, and the physical clock rates are 100 and 133 MHz, respectively. The multipliers in the tables above apply to the physical clock rate, not the data transfer rate.

<text>A filly is a female horse that is too young to be called a mare. There are two specific definitions in use:

*In most cases, a &quot;filly&quot; is a female horse under four years old.
*In some nations, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, the world of horse racing sets the cutoff age for fillies as five.

Fillies are sexually mature by two and are sometimes bred at that age, but generally, they should not be bred until they themselves have stopped growing, usually by four or five. Some fillies may exhibit estrus as yearlings. 

The equivalent term for a male is a colt. When horses of either sex are less than one year, they are referred to as foals. Horses of either sex between one and two years old may be called yearlings.

<text>The following are the national [[public holiday]]s and other observances of Argentina.

Though holidays of many faiths are respected, public holidays usually include most Catholic based holidays. Historic holidays include the celebration of the May Revolution (25 May), Independence Day (9 July), National Flag Day (20 June) and the death of José de San Martín (17 August).

The extended family gathers on Christmas Eve at around 9 p.m. for dinner, music, and often dancing. Candies are served just before midnight, when the fireworks begin. They also open gifts from Papá Noel (Father Christmas or &quot;Santa Claus&quot;). New Year&#x27;s Day is also marked with fireworks. Other widely observed holidays include Good Friday, Easter, Labor Day (1 May) and Veterans Day (formerly Malvinas Day, 2 April).

== Public holidays ==

The &quot;movable holidays&quot; whose dates coincide with Tuesdays and Wednesdays will be moved to the previous Monday. Those that coincide with Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday will be moved to the following Monday. Every employee is entitled to 15 paid public holidays and every year the government adds a few more holidays known as &quot;bridge holidays&quot; which means that a holiday lasts two days.

=== Non-working days ===

The following are federal non-working national or religious holidays, during which people of the following faiths are excused from work:

== Bicentennial holidays ==

* September 24, 2012: Bicentenary of the Battle of Tucumán.
* January 31, 2013: Bicentenary of the inaugural session of the Assembly of the Year XIII.
* February 20, 2013: Bicentenary of the Battle of Salta.
* July 9, 2016: Bicentennial of the Argentine Declaration of Independence.

==Other observances==

<doc id="776844" wikidata="Q2454458" url="?curid=776844" title="Lockheed D-21">
<text>The Lockheed D-21 is an American supersonic reconnaissance drone. The D-21 was initially designed to be launched from the back of an M-21 carrier aircraft, a variant of the Lockheed A-12 aircraft. The drone had maximum speed in excess of at an operational altitude of . Development began in October 1962. Originally known by the Lockheed designation Q-12, the drone was intended for reconnaissance deep into enemy airspace.

The D-21 was designed to carry a single high-resolution photographic camera over a preprogrammed path, then release the camera module into the air for retrieval, after which the drone would self-destruct. Following a fatal accident when launched from an M-21, the D-21 was modified to be launched from a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress. Several successful test flights were made, followed by at least four unsuccessful operational D-21 flights over China, before the program was canceled in 1971.

==Design and development==
In the 1960s, Lockheed&#x27;s secret Skunk Works developed the Mach 3 A-12 reconnaissance aircraft for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). After the shooting down of the U-2 piloted by Gary Powers in 1960, several different concepts were proposed as alternatives. Kelly Johnson, the leader of Skunk Works, developed the concept of a long-range drone that used much of the A-12&#x27;s technology. In October 1962, the CIA and the United States Air Force (USAF) instructed Lockheed to study a high-speed, high-altitude drone concept. Johnson specified speeds of Mach 3.3–3.5, an operational altitude of , and a range of . It was intended to make a one-way trip, eject its camera payload at the end of the mission for recovery, then self-destruct. It had a double-delta wing similar to the A-12&#x27;s wing design. The Q-12 was to be air-launched from the back of an A-12, and used key technology from the A-12 project, including titanium construction and radar cross-section reduction design features.
Johnson wanted to power the Q-12 with a ramjet engine built by the Marquardt Corporation for the Boeing CIM-10 Bomarc long-range surface-to-air missile. Marquardt and Lockheed had already collaborated on several programs and had a close working relationship. The engine, the RJ43-MA-11, required modification, since it was only designed to burn as long as the missile needed to hit a target, while the Q-12&#x27;s engine needed to operate at high temperatures for at least an hour and a half at high altitudes. The modified engine was designated RJ43-MA20S-4.

A full-scale mockup of the Q-12 was ready by 7 December 1962, and had already undergone preliminary tests to measure its radar cross-section. Marquardt had also successfully tested the modified RJ-43 in its wind tunnel in the meantime. The CIA was not enthusiastic about the Q-12, mostly because the agency was overextended at the time with U-2 missions, getting the A-12 up to speed and covert operations in Southeast Asia. The USAF was interested in the Q-12 as both a reconnaissance platform and a cruise missile and the CIA finally decided to work with the USAF to develop the new drone. Lockheed was awarded a contract in March 1963 for full-scale development of the Q-12.

The camera and its film magazines with an inertial navigation system were carried in a cramped &quot;Q-bay&quot; below the drone&#x27;s air intake. These components were built into a module that fit into the bay and was known as a &quot;hatch&quot;. The hatch would be ejected at the end of the mission and then snagged out of the air by a JC-130 Hercules, a technique that had been developed by the USAF to recover film canisters from balloons and satellites. If the C-130 missed, the hatch was equipped with flotation devices so it could be recovered by ship if released over water. Honeywell built the avionics systems; new construction techniques and materials had to be developed for the systems to withstand the high temperatures, extreme vibrations and lack of space in the D-21.
In late 1963 the project was named &quot;Tagboard&quot;; the Q-12 was re-designated D-21 while the A-12 version launcher became M-21 (D- for &quot;daughter&quot; and M- for &quot;mother&quot;). Two of the original 18 A-12 aircraft were designated as M-21s with serial numbers 60-6940 and 60-6941. The M-21 was a two-seat version of the A-12, with a pylon on the fuselage centerline between the vertical stabilizers to carry the drone in a nose-up attitude.

===Testing and carrier change===
A D-21 mounted on an M-21 began captive flight-testing on 22 December 1964. Aerodynamic covers were initially placed over the D-21&#x27;s intake and exhaust to reduce drag, but had to be removed after the first few tests, as no way of discarding them at Mach 3 without damaging the drone or carrier plane could be devised.

The D-21 was first launched from an M-21 on 5 March 1966. The drone was released but stayed close to the M-21&#x27;s back for a few seconds, which seemed like &quot;two hours&quot; to the M-21 crew. A second launch took place on 27 April 1966; the D-21 reached its operational altitude of and speed of over , but was lost due to a hydraulic pump failure after a flight of over . The USAF&#x27;s interest in the program continued and more D-21s were ordered after the second launch. A third flight took place on 16 June with the D-21 flying through its complete flight profile; its camera hatch was not released due to an electronics failure.

The fourth and final launch from an M-21 on 30 July ended in disaster. Unlike the three previous launches this one was performed straight and level, not in an outside loop to assist in the separation of the drone from the aircraft. The D-21 suffered an engine unstart and struck the M-21&#x27;s tail after separation, leading to the destruction of both aircraft. The two crew ejected and landed at sea. The pilot, Bill Park, survived, but the Launch Control Officer, Ray Torrick, drowned.
Following the accident, Johnson suggested launching the D-21 from the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bomber and adding a solid rocket booster to get it up to speed. The drone was modified by adding attachment points on its spine to mate with the carrying pylon on the B-52 and its belly attachment points were adapted to accommodate the rocket booster necessary to increase its speed and allow its ramjet to operate. Its vertical stabilizer was increased in size by approximately 20%. The modified drone version was designated &quot;D-21B&quot; (there was no &quot;D-21A&quot;). Two B-52Hs were modified to carry two drones each by means of two large underwing pylons that replaced the smaller pylons used for the AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missiles. The tail gunner&#x27;s and electronic warfare officer&#x27;s stations were replaced with two launch control stations. Command and telemetry systems were added, and high-speed cameras were installed to track the drones as they separated from the pylons. The launch control officer on the B-52H could communicate with the D-21B and could make it self-destruct.
The solid-propellant rocket booster was both larger and heavier than the drone; it was long and weighed . It had a folding tail fin on the bottom to stabilize it while the rocket was firing. The booster had a burn time of 87 seconds and a thrust of . During ground handling everyone within was required to wear anti-static straps to prevent any discharge of static electricity that might ignite the booster.

The first attempted launch of a D-21B was on 28 September 1967, but the drone fell off the B-52&#x27;s launch pylon due to a stripped nut on the pylon before the aircraft reached its intended launch point. Johnson admitted that the incident was &quot;very embarrassing&quot;. Three more launches were performed from November 1967 to January 1968. None were completely successful, so Johnson ordered his team to conduct a thorough review before renewing launch attempts. The next launch was on 10 April 1968. It also failed as the engine did not ignite. On 16 June the D-21B finally made a completely successful flight; it flew at the specified altitude and course for its full range, and the hatch was recovered. The next two launches were failures, followed by another successful flight in December. A test in February 1969 to check the inertial navigation system using an actual mission profile was a failure. The next two flights in May and July succeeded.

==Operational history==
At least four operational missions with the D-21B took place under the code name &quot;Senior Bowl&quot;. These were conducted over China from 9 November 1969 to 20 March 1971 to spy on the Lop Nor nuclear test site. The USAF&#x27;s 4200th Support Squadron, based at Beale Air Force Base, California, flew the missions, usually from Andersen Air Force Base in Guam.

The Chinese government never reported spotting the D-21B in flight. The first one failed to turn around and continued straight on, crashing in the Soviet Union. Another test flight was conducted on 20 February 1970 in a successful attempt to correct any problems. The second operational mission was on 16 December 1970. The D-21B reached Lop Nor and returned to the recovery point, but the hatch had a partial parachute failure and was lost at sea with its photographs.

During the third operational mission, on 4 March 1971, the D-21B flew to Lop Nor and returned, and released the hatch, which deployed its parachute, but the midair recovery failed and the hatch fell into the water. The destroyer that tried to retrieve the hatch ran it down and it sank. The fourth, and last, Senior Bowl flight was on 20 March 1971. It was lost over China on the final segment of the route over China&#x27;s Yunnan province; wreckage was found by local authorities. In 2010, after being in the junkyard of the China Aviation Museum for years, the wreckage was moved to the exhibition area.

According to writer Lloyd Spanberger, at least two additional operational D-21B flights may have been made. Spanberger cites an interview with Lt. Col. Alfred Crane, who worked with classified spy satellites and drones during the Cold War, in which Crane described processing two D-21B film capsules, both from flights over China. In both cases, the hatch was successfully recovered (whether in midair using the JC-130 or at sea is unknown), but only one yielded any usable photographs. The use of improper film processing equipment caused the emulsion on the first drone&#x27;s film to separate from its base, rendering the photographs unusable. In the other mission, the film development process was completed with no further obstacles, according to Spanberger.

On 23 July 1971, the D-21B program was canceled due to its poor success rate, the introduction of a new generation of photo reconnaissance satellites, and President Richard Nixon&#x27;s rapprochement with China. A total of 38 D-21 and D-21B drones had been built, 21 of which were expended in launches. The remaining 17 were initially stored at Norton Air Force Base, California, then moved to the Davis–Monthan Air Force Base &quot;boneyard&quot; near Tucson, Arizona, in 1976 and 1977. With the base open to the public, the D-21 drones were quickly spotted and photographed. The Air Force called them GTD-21Bs with the GT standing for Ground Training.

The fate of the D-21 that had disappeared on the first operational flight was revealed in February 1986 when an official from the CIA returned a panel to Ben Rich that he had been given by a Soviet KGB agent. The drone had self-destructed over Siberia and the Soviets had recovered the wreckage. The Tupolev design bureau reverse-engineered the wreck and produced plans for a Soviet copy, named the &quot;Voron&quot; (Raven), but it was never built.

In the late 1990s NASA considered using a D-21 to test a hybrid rocket-based combined cycle engine, which operates as a ramjet or rocket, depending on its flight regime. Ultimately NASA used a derivative of the agency&#x27;s X-43A hypersonic test vehicle for the experiments.

<doc id="776862" wikidata="Q491057" url="?curid=776862" title="Paramesonephric duct">
<text>The paramesonephric ducts (or Müllerian ducts) are paired ducts of the embryo in the reproductive system of humans and other mammals that run down the lateral sides of the genital ridge and terminate at the sinus tubercle in the primitive urogenital sinus. In the female, they will develop to form the fallopian tubes/oviducts, uterus, cervix, and the upper one-third of the vagina.

==Development==
The female reproductive system is composed of two embryological segments: the urogenital sinus and the paramesonephric ducts. The two are conjoined at the sinus tubercle. Paramesonephric ducts are present on the embryo of both sexes. Only in females do they develop into reproductive organs. They degenerate in males of certain species, but the adjoining mesonephric ducts develop into male reproductive organs. The sex based differences in the contributions of the paramesonephric ducts to reproductive organs is based on the presence, and degree of presence, of anti-Müllerian hormone.
During the formation of the reproductive system, the paramesonephric ducts are formed just lateral to the mesonephric ducts in both female and male embryos 6 weeks after fertilization. During this time, primordial germ cells migrate from the yolk sac to the genital ridge; a region of mesenchyme arising from, and running parallel with, the mesonephros. The paramesonephric ducts are formed by the craniocaudal invagination of a ribbon of thickened coelomic epithelium that extends from the third thoracic segment caudally to the posterior wall of the urogenital sinus. The caudal parts of the paramesonephric ducts fuse into a single tube, known as the uterovaginal primordium, before flowing into the dorsal aspect of the urogenital sinus at the sinus tubercle directly medial to the mesonephric ducts.

===Anti-Müllerian hormone===

The development of the paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts is controlled by the presence or absence of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH; also known as Müllerian-inhibiting substance, &quot;MIF&quot; for &quot;Müllerian-inhibiting factor&quot;, &quot;MIH&quot; for &quot;Müllerian-inhibiting hormone&quot;, or &quot;APH&quot; for anti-paramesonephric hormone).

AMH is a glycoprotein hormone that is secreted by sustentacular cells (Sertoli cells) in males as they begin their morphologic differentiation in response to SRY expression. AMH begins to be secreted around week 8, which in turn causes the paramesonephric ducts to regress very rapidly between the 8th and 10th weeks. However, small paramesonephric ducts can still be identified, and the remnants can be detected in the adult male, located in the appendix testis, a small cap of tissue associated with the testis. Remnants of the paramesonephric ducts can also be found in the prostatic utricle, an expansion of the prostatic urethra at the center of the seminal colliculus.

AMH receptor-type II (AMHR-II), also known as Misr-II, causes AMH to act indirectly on mesenchymal cells surrounding the paramesonephric ducts rather than acting directly on the epithelium of the duct. This receptor activation induces the ducts to regress. The importance of mesenchyme-to-epithelial signaling is to maintain AMHR-II expression in the mesenchyme. In the absence of the Wnta7a within the duct epithelium as the ducts regress, ductal AMHR-II expression is lost, and residual paramesonephric ducts would be retained in males, throwing off the urogenital system.

Cryptorchidism (undescended testis) or ectopic testis with inguinal hernias have been identified in human males due to AMH and AMHR-II gene mutations. Studies have revealed another AMH receptor group, AMH receptor-type I (AMHR-I), based on the AMH being a TgfB/Bmp family member. Studies have shown that ALK2, Alk3 (or Bmpr 1a) and Alk6 all serve as AMHR-I receptors. When these receptors are blocked or knocked out in mice within the paramesonephric duct mesenchyme, AMH-induced paramesonephric duct regression is lost.

==Function==

In females, the paramesonephric ducts give rise to the uterine tubes, uterus, and upper portion of the vagina, while the mesonephric ducts degenerate due to the absence of male androgens. In contrast, the paramesonephric ducts begin to proliferate and differentiate in a cranial-caudal progression to form the aforementioned structures. During this time, the single-layered paramesonephric duct epithelium differentiates into other structures, ranging from the ciliated columnar epithelium in the uterine tube to stratified squamous epithelium in the vagina.

The paramesonephric ducts and the mesonephric ducts share a majority of the same mesenchyme due to Hox gene expression. The genes expressed play a critical role in mediating the regional characterization of structures found along the cranial-caudal axis of the female reproductive tract.

==Clinical significance==

===Mutations in AMH===
Individuals that are 46, XY and have been tested positive for mutations in their AMH or AMH receptor genes have been known to exhibit features typical of that which are exhibited in persistent Müllerian duct syndrome due to the fact that the paramesonephric ducts fail to regress. When this happens the individuals develop structures that are derived from the paramesonephric duct, and also structures that are derived from the mesonephric duct. A male that has persistent Müllerian duct syndrome may have an upper vagina, uterus, and uterine tubes as well as ductus deferens along with male external genitalia. The female organs are in the correct anatomical position but the position of the testis varies. 60% to 70% of detected cases, both testes will lie in the normal position for the ovaries; about 20% to 30% of the time, one of the testis will lie within the inguinal hernial sac while in other cases both testes will lie within the same inguinal hernia sac. However whenever an individual exhibits persistent Müllerian duct syndrome, the ductus deferens will run along the lateral sides of the uterus.

=== Paramesonephric duct anomalies===
Anomalies that develop within the paramesonephric duct system continue to puzzle and fascinate obstetricians and gynecologists. The paramesonephric ducts play a critical role in the female reproductive tract and differentiate to form the uterine tubes, uterus, superior vagina as well as the uterine cervix. Many types of disorders can occur when this system is disrupted ranging from uterine and vaginal agenesis to the duplication of unwanted cells of the uterus and vagina. Paramesonephric malformations are usually related to abnormalities of the renal and axial skeletal system. Malfunction in the ovaries and age onset abnormalities can also be associated with most paramesonephric ducts. Most often, abnormalities are recognized once the external genitalia is no longer masked and the internal reproductive organ abnormalities become revealed. Due to a very broad range of anomalies it is very difficult to diagnose paramesonephric duct anomalies.

Due to improved surgical instruments and technique, women with paramesonephric duct anomalies can have normal sexual relations. Through the use of Vecchietti and Mclndoe procedures, women can carry out their sexual activity. On another note, many other surgical advances have tremendously improved fertility chances as well as obstetric outcomes. Assisted reproductive technology makes it possible for some women who have paramesonephric duct anomalies to conceive and give birth to healthy babies.

==History==
They are named after Johannes Peter Müller, a physiologist who described these ducts in his text &quot;Bildungsgeschichte der Genitalien&quot; in 1830.

<text>Trunko is the nickname for a large unidentified lump of flesh or a decomposed sea creature, a so-called &quot;globster&quot;, reportedly sighted in Margate, South Africa on 25 October 1924. The initial source for Trunko was an article entitled &quot;Fish Like A Polar Bear&quot; published on 27 December 1924, edition of London&#x27;s &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. The animal was reportedly first seen off the coast battling two killer whales, which fought the unusual creature for three hours. It used its tail to attack the whales and reportedly lifted itself out of the water by about . One of the witnesses, South African farmer Hugh Ballance, described the animal as looking like a &quot;giant polar bear&quot; due to what was thought to be dense-white fur.

The creature reputedly washed up on Margate Beach but despite being there for 10 days, no scientist investigated the carcass while it was beached, so no reliable description has been published, and until September 2010 it was assumed that no photographs of it had ever been published. Some people who have never been identified were reported to have described the animal as possessing snowy-white fur, and an elephantine trunk.

Commenting on the photos, paleontologist Darren Naish wrote:

<text>Farpoint Observatory is an astronomical observatory owned and operated by the &quot;Northeast Kansas Amateur Astronomers&#x27; League&quot;, or NEKAAL. It is located on the grounds of Mission Valley High School at Eskridge, near Auburn, Kansas, approximately southwest of Topeka, Kansas, United States.

==Summary==
Farpoint Observatory is International Astronomical Union (IAU) observatory code 734, and is home to the Farpoint Asteroid Search Team (FAST), which has an international reputation having discovered more than 330 non-NEO (Near Earth Orbit) asteroids in addition to many in NEO orbits. As of January 1, 2014, Farpoint observers had contributed more than minor planet observations to the IAU Minor Planet Center.

NEKAAL received a $56,060 grant from NASA&#x27;s Near Earth Objects (NEO) tracking program to acquire and install at Farpoint the Pitt telescope from Lindley Hall, University of Kansas. After full refurbishment, the telescope now measures 27 inches in aperture (primary mirror diameter), 9 feet 3 inches in length, with weight of 1,600 pounds (725 kg).

The main-belt asteroid 23989 Farpoint, discovered by amateur astronomers Gary Hug and Graham E. Bell at Farpoint in 1999, was named for the observatory.

It is bordered by Coney Island Avenue to the east; Fort Hamilton Parkway and Caton Avenue to the north; McDonald Avenue, Dahill Road or 36th Street to the west; and Ditmas Avenue or Foster Avenue (if including Parkville, a micro-neighborhood largely subsumed under Kensington&#x27;s imprimatur) to the south. Kensington and Parkville are bordered by the Prospect Park South and Ditmas Park subsections of Flatbush to the east; Windsor Terrace to the north; Borough Park to the west; and Midwood to the south.

Kensington is a predominantly residential area, with housing types that include brick rowhouses, detached one-family Victorians, and apartment buildings. Pre-war brick apartment buildings dominate the Ocean Parkway and Coney Island Avenue frontage, including many that operate as co-ops. The neighborhood has a diverse population with residents of many ethnicities. The main commercial streets are Coney Island Avenue, Church Avenue, Ditmas Avenue, and McDonald Avenue. Ocean Parkway bisects the neighborhood east–west. Kensington&#x27;s ZIP Code is 11218 and it is served by the NYPD&#x27;s 66th Precinct.

==History==

=== Early history ===

The land where Kensington now sits was first colonized by Dutch farmers during the seventeenth century within the town of Flatbush. It was re-settled by British colonists in 1737. First developed in 1885 after the completion of Ocean Parkway, the neighborhood was named after the place and borough in West London, at the turn of the century.

The small area between 18th and Foster Avenues, in the southern portion of the neighborhood, contains a distinctive, slightly diagonal street grid and is also known as Parkville. The area, originally part of the town of Flatbush, was originally known as Greenville and its land was first acquired in 1852 by the Freeman&#x27;s Association, shortly after the completion of Coney Island Avenue on the eastern boundary of Kensington and Parkville. Public School 92 (later P.S. 134) and the Roman Catholic Church of St. Rose of Lima were built to service the subsection in 1870. A librarian at the Brooklyn Public Library wrote that &quot;Parkville is one of those wonky neighborhoods that isn&#x27;t often referenced&quot; because of its small size.

Despite political tensions, the town of Flatbush was annexed by the city of Brooklyn in 1894, presaging the consolidation of the five boroughs of New York City on January 1, 1898. Accordingly, further spates of development occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, much of which was initially concentrated in the village of Windsor Terrace (which had more southerly borders than the contemporary neighborhood, being bounded by Church Avenue on the south, Gravesend [McDonald] Avenue on the west, the historical Brooklyn–Flatbush town line near Terrace Place on the north, and Prospect Park Southwest and Coney Island Avenue on the east). These efforts also encompassed Brooklyn Real Estate Exchange President Jeremiah Johnson, Jr.&#x27;s circa 1891 Kensington Heights and circa 1894 Kensington-in-Flatbush developments, the former in the vicinity of Ditmas Avenue and the latter possibly in the vicinity of Church Avenue; detached suburban villas on and adjoining Ocean Parkway that attracted wealthier residents from more urbanized areas, including Brooklyn Heights, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Bushwick; hybrid commercial/walk-up apartment structures on commercial thoroughfares; and a variety of limestone- and brick-fronted townhouse rows.

=== Early and mid-20th century ===
As the area was gradually rezoned amid the construction of the IND Brooklyn Line, six-story elevator apartment houses became increasingly prevalent on upper Ocean Parkway and in its periphery between the late 1920s and 1941, replacing many of the suburban villas. Following World War II, the development of the Prospect Expressway ensured that luxury buildings (by now often exceeding six stories due to building code revisions and further zoning changes, as exemplified by the Marlene J. [later known as the Caton Towers] and the Americana Towers) continued to be developed on Ocean Parkway and in its immediate vicinity until the mid-1960s. Since the 1990s, there has been a notable resurgence in various forms of residential development, including new apartment houses on Ocean Parkway and smaller structures on side streets.

Throughout much of the 20th century, Kensington was seldom distinguished as a distinct neighborhood, with many residents and demographers identifying the area as the western section of Flatbush. The descriptor West Flatbush was also used by various religious &amp; civic organizations and urban planners in the first half of the 20th century before largely falling into disuse after 1954. While the Kensington moniker continued to be employed by branches of certain governmental institutions (including the Post Office Department and the Brooklyn Public Library), it was also used by demographers to differentiate the largely working class, ethnically heterogeneous tracts west of Ocean Parkway from the historically affluent, Old Stock and Jewish American-dominated tracts east of Coney Island Avenue. A 1945 fifteen-year retrospective study of Brooklyn Protestantism by the Committee for Cooperative Field Research included the Kensington tracts between the historical villages of Windsor Terrace and Parkville (alternatively characterized as the &quot;Ocean Parkway corridor&quot;) within the boundaries of Flatbush, also noting that a contemporaneous survey of 3,072 families indicated that 41% of residents identified as Roman Catholic (exemplified by a recent influx of second and third-generation Italian Americans from South Brooklyn and other northern neighborhoods), 33% as Jewish (primarily concentrated in apartment houses on &quot;main traffic ways&quot;) and 26% as Protestant, with the latter population remaining concentrated in &quot;private dwellings on the side streets&quot; amid an ongoing decline. In his 2015 memoir, musician Marky Ramone (who resided at 640 Ditmas Avenue throughout much of his childhood in the 1960s) noted the area&#x27;s distance from major thoroughfares in eastern Flatbush, necessitating a two-fare public transit zone via bus to Erasmus Hall High School.

Beginning in the 1950s, demographic shifts in eastern Flatbush — exemplified by white flight among the Jewish American community and the concomitant emergence of an Afro-Caribbean immigrant community in the vicinity of Flatbush Avenue — would contrast with comparative stability in the Kensington tracts, notwithstanding the effects of a decade-long population decline likely stemming from a variety of factors, including the beginning of post-Levittown mass suburbanization and the broader amelioration of New York City&#x27;s postwar housing shortage. In 1956, the closure and ensuing &quot;bustitution&quot; of the Church Avenue streetcar line irrevocably altered a longstanding facet of the neighborhood&#x27;s public transit landscape.

=== Recognition as separate neighborhood and increasing diversity ===
Although New York City Deputy Municipal Reference Librarian Thelma E. Smith described the Kensington tracts from McDonald Avenue to Coney Island Avenue as a &quot;sub-neighborhood&quot; of Flatbush in a 1966 annotated bibliography of neighborhood histories and reportage for city officials, &quot;The New York Times&quot; would characterize Ocean Parkway as the western boundary of Flatbush in early 1968. Shortly thereafter, the New York City municipal government informally designated the tracts between McDonald and Coney Island Avenues as Kensington in the 1969 &quot;Plan for New York City&quot;. Similarly, Gilbert Tauber and Samuel Kaplan asserted that southern Windsor Terrace, the traditional Kensington tracts and western Midwood constituted the sprawling neighborhood of &quot;Kensington-Ocean Parkway&quot; in &quot;The New York City Handbook&quot;, first published by Doubleday in 1966. (Indeed, after the contemporary community boards of New York City were established in 1963, much of present-day Kensington was appended to the Borough Park-dominated Brooklyn Community Board 12, possibly stemming from Kensington Democratic leader Howard Golden&#x27;s affiliation with Borough Park&#x27;s then-powerful Roosevelt Club. Conversely, the eastern Flatbush and Midwood tracts were incorporated into Brooklyn Community Board 14, a division that endures to the present.)

Although the formation of such community organizations as the Kensington-Flatbush Preservation Association would further popularize the moniker throughout the 1970s, press accounts continued to describe the area as Flatbush. In April 1973, Brooklyn Borough President Sebastian Leone said that planned renovations of upper Ocean Parkway (along with a smaller portion in contemporary Midwood) &quot;[would] be an asset to the Flatbush community.&quot; Brooklyn-born sports journalist Stan Fischler also identified the IND Church Avenue station as being located in Flatbush in &quot;Uptown, Downtown&quot;, his 1976 history of the New York City subway system. Reflecting this transitional milieu, the area surrounding a March 1977 gas station shootout at 417 Dahill Road was alternatively characterized as being part of Borough Park (by reporters Thomas Raftery and Paul Meskil) and as a &quot;worn section of Flatbush&quot; (by columnist Pete Hamill) on the same page of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;.

During this period, the Kensington tracts began to experience significant demographic changes. Most of the area&#x27;s long-endangered mainline Protestant churches (including the historically prominent Prospect Park Baptist Church) were forced to close due to a lack of parishioners, while the area&#x27;s deeply-rooted Irish American community continued to be supplanted by new waves of upwardly mobile Italian Americans moving out from less desirable sections of central and northern Brooklyn, paralleling developments in nearby Sunset Park. In a 1974 interview with Wendy Schuman of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, a banker opined that Ocean Parkway &quot;just [wasn&#x27;t] prestigious anymore&quot; as younger residents fully embraced suburbanization, leaving a substantial and rapidly aging white ethnic population (most of whom settled in the area between the early 1930s and the early 1950s) that proved reluctant to move due to New York&#x27;s favorable rent regulation laws. Another resident who recently moved to Ocean Parkway cited the area&#x27;s perceived isolation from eastern Flatbush, by now a predominantly Caribbean American community, as his impetus for relocation: &quot;I&#x27;m a bigot. I don&#x27;t care how much money they have. I&#x27;m not going to live with Blacks and Puerto Ricans. I&#x27;ll move out and keep on moving. Five years ago I would have punched a guy in the nose for talking like this.&quot;

By the early 1980s, the Kensington designation was rapidly adopted by real estate interests as these tenants (who often identified as Flatbush residents) began to die or retire elsewhere, leading to a greater awareness of the name through a surfeit of advertising. During this period, the area became desirable to a wide range of New Yorkers (including young professionals adversely affected by gentrification in such neighborhoods as Park Slope and Tribeca; Orthodox Jews, African Americans and Hispanic and Latino Americans from Borough Park, eastern Flatbush and other nearby neighborhoods; and a variety of post-1965 immigrant communities, including substantial Eastern European and South Asian enclaves) as a dual locus of relatively affordable rentals amid the city&#x27;s burgeoning co-op conversion movement, further entrenching the notion of Kensington as a discrete neighborhood among new residents. In 1983, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the Ocean Parkway boundary as a vestigial border in a feature about the Community Board 14 tracts of Flatbush. Nevertheless, City College of New York and CUNY Graduate Center sociologist William B. Helmreich included Kensington within the boundaries of Flatbush (while acknowledging its unique demographic mix and comparatively downscale architectural profile) in &quot;The Brooklyn Nobody Knows&quot; (2016). Additionally, members of &quot;frum&quot; Orthodox Jewish communities in the area frequently extend the boundaries of Flatbush to an area that corresponds to (and often exceeds) the pre-consolidation township, including contemporary Kensington and Midwood.

==Demographics==
Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Kensington-Ocean Parkway was 36,891, a decrease of 46 (0.1%) from the 36,937 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .

The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 47.9% (17,686) White, 6.9% (2,558) African American, 0.1% (49) Native American, 24.1% (8,879) Asian, 0.0% (9) Pacific Islander, 0.7% (274) from other races, and 2.5% (926) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 17.6% (6,510) of the population.

Kensington is a very ethnically diverse neighborhood, consisting of South Asian (Bangladeshi and Pakistani), Orthodox Jewish (Hasidic), Uzbek, Latin American, Polish, and Ukrainian communities. The intersection of McDonald and Church Avenues was co-named Little Bangladesh in October 2022 in recognition of the area&#x27;s large and growing Bangladeshi community.

The 2020 census data from New York City Department of City Planning showed each the White and Asian population ranges are roughly equal with each of their population being at between 10,000 and 19,999 residents. In addition, there were 5,000 to 9,999 Hispanic residents; however, the Black residents were fewer than 5,000.

==Transportation==

The New York City Subway&#x27;s IND Culver Line () runs along the western part of the neighborhood and stops underground at Fort Hamilton Parkway and at Church Avenue. The line rises above ground to an elevated structure () to serve the Ditmas Avenue and 18th Avenue stations. In addition, Kensington is served by the local buses, as well as the express buses to Manhattan.

==Education==
===Library===

The Kensington branch of the Brooklyn Public Library is located at 4207 18th Avenue, near the intersection of Seton Place and East Second Street. It was originally created in 1908 as a &quot;deposit station&quot; with a small collection, and was located at P.S. 134, three blocks east of the current library. Within four years, it had moved twice, and in 1912, it relocated to 770 McDonald Avenue, at the southwest corner of Ditmas Avenue. The library moved again in 1960 to a location four blocks east, on 410 Ditmas Avenue, between East 4th &amp; East 5th Streets. The current facility opened in 2012.

===Schools===
Public schools in Kensington include four public primary schools: P.S. 130 (shared with Windsor Terrace), P.S. 230, P.S. 179, and P.S. 134. There are three middle schools: M.S. 839, J.H.S. 62 and J.H.S. 23. The area has no public high schools. There is also an Orthodox Jewish school called Yeshiva Torah Vodaas.

<text>AS-104 was the fourth orbital test of a boilerplate Apollo spacecraft, and the second flight of the Pegasus micrometeoroid detection satellite. It was launched by SA-8, the ninth Saturn I carrier rocket.

==Objectives==
The primary mission objective was to demonstrate the launch vehicle&#x27;s iterative guidance mode and to evaluate system accuracy. The launch trajectory was similar to that of mission AS-103.

The Saturn launch vehicle SA-8 and payload were similar to those of mission AS-103, except that a single reaction control engine assembly was mounted on the boilerplate service module (BP-26). The assembly was instrumented to acquire additional data on launch environment temperatures. This assembly also differed from the one on the AS-101 mission in that two of the four engines were of a prototype configuration instead of all engines being simulated.

==Launch==
This was the first nighttime launch in the Saturn I series. A built-in 35 minute hold was used to ensure that launch time coincided with the opening of the launch window.

AS-104 was launched from Cape Kennedy Launch Complex 37B at 2:35:01 a.m. EST (07:35:01 GMT) on May 25, 1965. The launch was normal and the payload was inserted into orbit approximately 10.6 minutes after lift-off. The total mass placed in orbit, including the spacecraft, Pegasus B, adapter, instrument unit, and S-IV stage, was 34,113 pounds (15,473 kg). The perigee and apogee were 314.0 and 464.1 miles (505 and 747 km), respectively; the orbital inclination was 31.78&#x27;. The 1397 kilogram (3080-pound) Pegasus 2 satellite was also carried to orbit by SA-8, being stowed inside the boilerplate&#x27;s service module, and remaining attached to the S-IV stage.

The actual trajectory was close to the one predicted, and the spacecraft was separated 806 seconds after lift-off. Several minor malfunctions occurred in the S-I stage propulsion system; however, all mission objectives were achieved.

<text>Suddenly is a 1954 black and white American noir crime film directed by Lewis Allen with a screenplay written by Richard Sale. The drama stars Frank Sinatra and Sterling Hayden, and features James Gleason and Nancy Gates.

The story concerns a small California town whose tranquility is shattered when the train of the president of the United States is scheduled to make a stop there, and a hired assassin and his henchmen take over a home that provides a perfect vantage point from which to assassinate the president.

==Plot==

A train carrying the president of the United States is scheduled to make a stop in the small town of Suddenly, California. Claiming to be part of the FBI detail checking up on security before the president&#x27;s arrival, three men arrive at the home of the Benson family: Ellen, an over-protective war widow, her young son “Pidge”, and her father-in-law, “Pop” Benson. The house is on top of a hill overlooking the station, making it a perfect perch from which to shoot the president. However, it soon becomes clear that the men are not government agents but assassins, led by the ruthless John Baron, who take over the house and hold the family hostage.

Sheriff Tod Shaw arrives with Dan Carney, the Secret Service agent in charge of the president&#x27;s security detail. When he does, Baron and his gangsters shoot Carney dead and a bullet fractures Shaw&#x27;s arm. Baron straightens his arm and lets him go to the bedroom where Mrs Benson puts his arm in a sling. All are threatened that Pidge will be shot if they do not keep quiet and Baron boasts about the Silver Star he won in the war for killing a large number of the enemy. He explains that he has nothing against the president but is being paid $500,000 to kill him and money is his only motive. He has already been paid half up-front.

Pop had broken the TV earlier and phoned the TV repair man, Jud, who now arrives and is made to join the others. Baron sends one of his henchmen down to the station to check on the president&#x27;s schedule, but he arouses the suspicion of the police and is killed in a shootout. Meanwhile Pop pretends he has heart pains and sends Pidge to look for pills in his dresser. There Pidge sees his grandfather&#x27;s loaded service revolver and exchanges it for his toy cap gun.

Now the hostages try to appeal to Baron&#x27;s patriotism, but he makes clear that he has none. But when Baron is confronted by the sheriff on the risks of killing the president, including whether he will ever see his money, Baron&#x27;s remaining henchman begins to show some reluctance to go through with the assassination. For Baron, however, these are the least of his concerns, and it soon becomes clear that he is a psychopath dismissed from the army for his love of killing.

The assassins have mounted a sniper rifle onto a metal table by the window overlooking the tracks. Jud, under the guise of fixing the TV, discreetly hooks the table up to the 5000-volt plate output of the family television. Pop Benson then intentionally spills a cup of water on the floor beneath the table. Although the hope is that Baron will be shocked and killed in this way, it is his henchman who touches the table first and is electrocuted, reflexively firing the rifle repeatedly and attracting the attention of the agents below. Baron shoots and mortally wounds Jud, disconnects the electrical hook-up and aims the rifle as the president&#x27;s train arrives, only to see it pass straight through. As Baron gapes in surprise, Ellen Benson grabs the revolver from the top of the dresser and shoots Baron in the abdomen, then Shaw picks up a gun and shoots him a second time. Baron dies appealing for mercy.

Outside the local hospital in the aftermath of the incident, Shaw confirms to Ellen that Jud &quot;didn’t make it.&quot; Telling Ellen that he needs to go back to his office, Shaw now makes plans to meet Ellen after church the next day, a proposal she had refused earlier, and they kiss. After she leaves, there is a reprise of the opening scene in which a driver stops to get directions and then asks for the name of the town. When Shaw tells him it is &quot;Suddenly&quot;, the driver remarks that &quot;that’s a funny name for a town&quot;. As the driver is pulling away, Shaw says to himself, &quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t know about that.&quot;

==Production==
Writer Richard Sale got his idea for the short story that was the basis of the film from articles in the newspaper about President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s visits to Palm Springs, California, by train. There were differences between the story and the film, the most thematically important being that the mother in the story was not bitter about her husband&#x27;s death in World War II, and in fact, was not present during the assassination attempt, so never had to make the choice the mother in the film has to make: whether to shoot and kill the assassin when the opportunity arises.

The exterior scenes for &quot;Suddenly&quot; were filmed in Saugus, California, which is now part of the city of Santa Clarita. Saugus Railway Station, which features prominently, still exists, though not in its original location. At the time of filming Saugus was served by a spur line that branched off from the main Southern Pacific coast line, terminating at Ventura. The spur line operated for almost a century but was decommissioned and torn up during the 1970s. Saugus station closed permanently in 1978, but local residents saved the historic building (opened in 1888) and had it moved to a new location, where it now serves as a museum.

The production company, Libra Productions, was producer Robert Brassler&#x27;s company, and &quot;Suddenly&quot; was his first independent film. Previously, Brassler had worked for Twentieth Century Fox.

==Reception==

When the film was released, Bosley Crowther, film critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, liked the direction of the film and the acting, and writing &quot;Yet such is the role that Mr. Sinatra plays in &quot;Suddenly!&quot;, a taut little melodrama that... [it] shapes up as one of the slickest recent items in the minor movie league... we have several people to thank—particularly Richard Sale for a good script, which tells a straight story credibly, Mr. Allen for direction that makes both excitement and sense, Mr. Bassler for a production that gets the feel of a small town and the cast which includes Sterling Hayden, James Gleason and Nancy Gates.&quot; Crowther especially liked Sinatra&#x27;s performance. He wrote, &quot;Mr. Sinatra deserves a special chunk of praise...In &quot;Suddenly!&quot; he proves it in a melodramatic tour de force.&quot;

The staff reviewer at &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a good review and praised the acting. He wrote &quot;[Sinatra] inserts plenty of menace into a psycho character, never too heavily done, and gets good backing from his costar, Sterling Hayden, as sheriff, in a less showy role but just as authoritatively handled. Lewis Allen&#x27;s direction manages a smart piece where static treatment easily could have prevailed.&quot;

The reviewer for &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote about Sinatra&#x27;s performance that he &quot;superbly refutes the idea that the straight-role potentialities which earned an Academy Award for him in &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; were one-shot stuff. In &quot;Suddenly&quot;, the happy-go-lucky soldier of &quot;Eternity&quot; becomes one of the most repellent killers in American screen history.&quot; Film critic Carl Mazek in &quot;Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style&quot; (1982) makes the case that the &quot;Machiavellian attitude&quot; of John Baron links the picture with the brutal films noir of the 1950s like &quot;The Big Night&quot; (1951) and &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; (1955). Moreover, he continued:
The sense of claustrophobia and despair unleashed by the assassins in &quot;Suddenly&quot; is completely amoral, and totally opposite of the style of harassment found in such non-noir, socially redemptive films as &quot;The Desperate Hours&quot; [1955]...There are no reasons given, or asked for, regarding the assassination — the entire incident functions as a nightmare, a very real nightmare that invades the serenity of a small town. At the end of the film, it is apparent that the Benson family will never be the same, suddenly scarred by people out of nowhere who irrevocably disrupt their middle-class tranquility.

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a contemporary approval rating of 100% based on nine reviews, with an average rating of 6.78/10.

==History==
===Influence===

In 1959, five years after the release of &quot;Suddenly&quot;, &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;, a novel written by Richard Condon, a former Hollywood press agent, was published. As with &quot;Suddenly&quot;, Condon&#x27;s book features a mentally troubled former war hero who, at the climax of the story, uses a rifle with a scope to shoot at a politician, in the case of the novel, a presidential candidate. &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; was released as a film in 1962, starring Sinatra, but this time he was trying to prevent an assassination being committed by Laurence Harvey. Paul Frees, who plays Benny Conklin in &quot;Suddenly&quot;, served as the narrator of &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (1962).

Sinatra asked United Artists to withdraw &quot;Suddenly&quot; from circulation because he heard the rumor that Lee Harvey Oswald had seen it before shooting President Kennedy. According to Hollywood legend, Sinatra bought up all remaining copies of &quot;Suddenly&quot; and had them destroyed, but this was not true. Sinatra also supposedly wanted &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; – of which he was a producer – withdrawn after the assassination, but its disappearance was caused by its having completed a normal film release schedule.

A remake of &quot;Suddenly&quot;, starring Dominic Purcell and directed by Uwe Boll, was released in 2013.

===Loss of copyright===
The film&#x27;s copyright was not renewed and it entered the public domain; it can be downloaded and viewed for free online. Prior to it entering the public domain, the film was widely available from a number of discount/public domain distributors. &quot;Suddenly&quot; was colorized for home video by Hal Roach Studios in 1986, rendering Sinatra&#x27;s blue eyes brown. A remastered colorized version by Legend Films was released to DVD on June 16, 2009, which also includes a newly restored print of the original black and white film.

, a film preservationist based in Paris, completely restored the film from a camera negative for Lobster Films, which released it in 2018.

<text>Negative pulldown is the manner in which an image is exposed on a film stock, described by the number of film perforations spanned by an individual frame. It can also describe whether the image captured on the negative is oriented horizontally or vertically. Changing the number of exposed perforations allows a cinematographer to change both the aspect ratio of the image and the size of the area on the film stock that the image occupies (which affects image clarity).

The most common negative pulldowns for 35 mm film are 4-perf and 3-perf, the latter of which is usually used in conjunction with Super 35. 2-perf, used in Techniscope in the 1960s, is enjoying a slight resurgence due to the birth of digital intermediate techniques eliminating the need for optical lab work. Vertical pulldown is overwhelmingly the dominant axis of motion in cinematography, although horizontal pulldown is used in IMAX, VistaVision, and in 35 mm consumer and professional still cameras.

== Usage of various formats ==
=== History ===
The majority of 35 mm film systems, cameras, telecine equipment, optical printers, or projectors, are configured to accommodate the 4-perf system; each frame of 35 mm is 4 perforations long. 4-perf was (and remains) the traditional system, and the majority of projectors are based on 4-perf, because 4 perforations is the amount needed per frame vertically in order to have enough negative space for a roughly squarish image, which became the silent film standard aspect ratio of 1.33:1. 

Later, when the film industry was facing the perceived threat of obsolescence to television, universally a 1.33:1 aspect ratio at the time (and remained so in many countries until the introduction of DTV), studios started experimenting with various competing widescreen formats.

== Current practice ==
Eventually, aspect ratios of 1.85:1 in North America and 1.66:1 in Europe became standard for 35 mm productions shot with normal non-anamorphic lenses. However, the aspect ratio for these films is not created within the camera itself but is achieved during projection by placing a cropping device, known as an aperture mask, over the film. As a result, most films are shot in full-screen format—commonly, though inaccurately, referred to as 1.33:1 but actually 1.37:1 due to the inclusion of soundtracks—while being composed for aspect ratios such as 1.85:1 or 1.66:1. These films are then cropped to the desired aspect ratio during projection. Consequently, a significant portion of the film is unused, as the cropped top and bottom sections are typically not intended to be displayed unless the film was specifically protected for full-screen presentation. The 3-perf and 2-perf systems are employed only during the origination and post-production transfer stages.

==35 mm==
===2-perf===
2-perf camera systems use 2 perforations per frame on 35 mm film with an aspect ratio close to 2.39:1; the aspect ratio used in anamorphic prints. It was first proposed conceptually around 1930, but was not put into practice until 1961, when Techniscope was developed at Technicolor&#x27;s Italian branch. It has recently been brought up again with the advent of higher quality, lower grain film stocks as well as digital intermediate post-production methods which eliminate optical blowups and thus improve quality. While in the recent past, some companies have offered custom conversions of camera equipment to 2-perf, it appears that camera manufacturers are now poised to support the format. Arri made 2-perf movement blocks for their Arricam and Arriflex 235 cameras available for rental in March 2007. Aaton&#x27;s Penelope camera, released in October 2008, was the first camera specifically designed for 2-perf usage (as well as 3-perf).

===3-perf===

In the early 1980s, Swedish cinematographer Rune Ericson collaborated with Panavision on the concept of creating a 3-perf mechanism for motion picture cameras. The 3-perf system, achieved by altering the camera gate and shutter mechanism, reduces film wastage by using frames that are 3 perforations high instead of the standard 4-perforations. This results in an aspect ratio of approximately 1.85:1, which closely aligns with the widescreen television aspect ratio of 1.78:1, thereby minimizing image loss outside this aspect ratio. Due to the smaller frame size, the camera operates about 25% slower, leading to a 25% reduction in film stock usage. Additionally, the camera operates more quietly because less film passes through the mechanism per frame. The Super 35 variant of 3-perf also provides a larger negative area, which can help offset the increase in grain when using higher-speed film stocks.

In the late 1990s, cinematographer Vittorio Storaro proposed a film standard known as Univisium (also called Univision), which advocated for 3-perf Super 35 to create a 2.00:1 aspect ratio.

=== Disadvantages of 3-perf and 2-perf ===
One disadvantage of 3-perf and 2-perf is found when projected theatrically, as it needs to be transferred back to a 4-perf system. This typically involves a film print with black cropping on the print itself in order to fit the image onto a 4-perf frame – encountering the same wastage problem as before. Even so, the amount of film shot on a production is much greater than the length of the final film, so 3-perf or 2-perf are still viable cost-saving options for production. Generally, 3-perf is most frequently used for widescreen television productions shot on film, as film is developed and then transferred to video, rendering projection incompatibilities irrelevant. Recently, this process has become popular with big-budget motion picture production, due to the advent of the digital intermediate process. The negative is scanned to high resolution (usually HD, 2K or 4K (digital cinema)) digital files, colour graded, and ultimately printed back to standard 4-perf for projection. At some point in the future, the final 4-perf print will become unnecessary assuming the cinema distribution and projection chain become fully digital.

3-perf and 2-perf pose minor problems for visual effects work. The area of the film in 4-perf work that is not projected nonetheless contains picture information which is useful for such visual effects tasks as 2D and 3D tracking. This mildly complicates certain visual effects efforts for productions using 3-perf and 2-perf.

=== VistaVision ===

VistaVision is a higher resolution, widescreen variant of the 35 mm motion picture film format which was created by Paramount Pictures in 1954. It uses a horizontal, 8 perforation 35 mm image, similar to that used in 135 film for still photography. Paramount did not use anamorphic processes such as CinemaScope but refined the quality of their flat widescreen system by orienting the 35 mm negative horizontally in the camera gate and shooting onto a larger area, which yielded a finer-grained projection print.

<doc id="777042" wikidata="Q336392" url="?curid=777042" title="Mercy">
<text>Mercy (Middle English, from Anglo-French , from Medieval Latin , &quot;price paid, wages&quot;, from Latin , &quot;merchandise&quot;) is , forgiveness, and kindness in a variety of ethical, religious, social, and legal contexts.

In the social and legal context, mercy may refer both to compassionate behavior on the part of those in power (e.g. mercy shown by a judge toward a convict), or on the part of a humanitarian third party (e.g., a mission of mercy aiming to treat war victims).

==Definition==
&quot;Mercy&quot; can be defined as &quot;compassion or forbearance shown especially to an offender or to one subject to one&#x27;s power&quot;; and also &quot;a blessing that is an act of divine favor or compassion.&quot; &quot;To be at someone&#x27;s mercy&quot; indicates a person being &quot;without defense against someone.&quot;

==Law and ethics==

In a judicial context mercy is often termed &quot;clemency&quot;. It is a sovereign prerogative that resides in the executive and is entirely discretionary. John Locke defined it as &quot;the power to act according to discretion, for the public good, without the prescription of the Law, and sometimes even against it.&quot; The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit explained that &quot;The very nature of clemency is that it is grounded solely in the will of the dispenser of clemency. He need give no reasons for granting it or for denying it.&quot;

==Religions==
The concept of a merciful God appears in various religions, including Hinduism, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. Performing acts of mercy as a component of religious beliefs is also emphasized through actions such as the giving of alms, care for the sick, and Works of Mercy.

===Christianity===
 says, &quot;So let us confidently approach the throne of grace to receive mercy and to find grace for timely help.&quot; Grace and mercy are similar in that both are free gifts of God and both are dispensed absent any merit on the part of the recipient. Grace is the favor of God, a divine assistance. Grace is what one receives that one does not deserve while mercy is what one receives when one does &quot;not&quot; get what one deserves.

An emphasis on mercy appears in the New Testament, for example in the Magnificat and Benedictus (Song of Zechariah), in Luke&#x27;s Gospel, and in the Beatitudes in : &quot;Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy.&quot; In Apostle Paul refers to the mercy of God in terms of salvation: &quot;God, who is rich in mercy... even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ.&quot;

Psalm 117 calls upon all nations to praise the Lord on account of his &quot;merciful kindness&quot;. This is quoted by the Apostle Paul in to show that God has now fulfilled this prophecy and promise through Jesus Christ, who has been merciful in giving his life as a sacrifice for his people, both Jew and gentile. reads:
This devotional element of mercy as part of the Christian tradition was echoed by Saint Augustine who called mercy &quot;ever ancient, ever new&quot;. The Works of Mercy (seven corporal and seven spiritual works) are part of the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions.

====Roman Catholicism====

In the encyclical &quot;Dives in misericordia&quot; (&quot;Rich in Mercy&quot;) Pope John Paul II examined the role of mercy—both God&#x27;s mercy, and also the need for human mercy. He saw in the Parable of the Prodigal Son () &quot;the essence of the divine mercy&quot;. Having squandered his patrimony, justice would dictate that the prodigal should only expect to be received back as a hireling. The figure of the father is analogous to God as Father, who goes beyond the requirements of justice to welcome his son with compassion.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church emphasizes the importance of the Works of Mercy. In Roman Catholic teachings the mercy of God flows through the work of the Holy Spirit. Roman Catholic liturgy includes frequent references to mercy, e.g., as in : Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy.

Mercy has also been an important subject of Christian iconography. Since the Middle Ages, many representations in art encouraged people to practice the works of mercy and, as the art historian Ralf van Bühren explains using the example of Caravaggio, helped &quot;the audience to explore mercy in their own lives&quot;.

In the 20th century, there was new focus on mercy in the Roman Catholic Church, partly due to the Divine Mercy devotion. The primary focus of the Divine Mercy devotion is the merciful love of God and the desire to let that love and mercy flow through one&#x27;s own heart towards those in need of it. 

Pope John Paul II was a follower of the Divine Mercy devotion, due to Saint Mary Faustina Kowalska (1905–1938), who is known as the &quot;Apostle of Mercy&quot;.

A number of Roman Catholic shrines are specifically dedicated to Divine Mercy, e.g. the Basilica of Divine Mercy in Krakow Poland, and the National Shrine of The Divine Mercy (Stockbridge, Massachusetts). During the dedication of the Basilica of Divine Mercy, John Paul II quoted and called mercy the &quot;greatest attribute of God Almighty&quot;.

The first &quot;World Apostolic Congress on Mercy&quot; was held in Rome in April 2008 and was inaugurated by Pope Benedict XVI.

In 2015, at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, in a Papal Bull of Indiction entitled &quot;Misericordiae Vultus&quot; (&quot;The Face of Mercy&quot;), Pope Francis proclaimed a Special and Extraordinary Holy Year Jubilee Year of Mercy, from December 8, 2015: Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, until November 21, 2016: the Solemnity of Our Lord Jesus Christ the King. The theme of the Extraordinary Jubilee was taken from , &quot;Merciful, Like the Father&quot;.

===Islam===
In Islam the title &quot;Most Merciful&quot; (&quot;Al-Raheem&quot;) is one of the names of Allah and &quot;Most Compassionate&quot; (&quot;Al-Rahman&quot;), is the most common name occurring in the Quran. &quot;Rahman&quot; and &quot;Rahim&quot; both derive from the root &quot;Rahmat&quot;, which refers to tenderness and benevolence. As a form of mercy, the giving of alms (&quot;zakat&quot;) is the fourth of the Five Pillars of Islam and one of the requirements for the faithful.

===Judaism===
The concept of mercy encompasses two terms in Hebrew. , which is also translated as &#x27;loving-kindness&#x27; and &#x27;goodness&#x27;, is the seventh of the thirteen defining attributes of God.

The other, , is also translated as &#x27;compassion&#x27; (or because its noun form is grammatically plural, as &#x27;mercies&#x27;). is the fourth of the thirteen attributes. says: &quot;The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.&quot; This is also emphasized in the context of the Babylonian exile in Isaiah: &quot;For the Lord has comforted his people, and will have compassion on his suffering ones. But Zion said, &#x27;The Lord has forsaken me, my Lord has forgotten me.&#x27; Can a woman forget her nursing child, or show no compassion for the child of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you.&quot; () Also: &quot;It is good to pray and fast, to be merciful and just.&quot; () When David, because of his sin, was told to choose between a three-year famine, pursuit by his enemies for three months, or a three-day pestilence, he chose the pestilence, saying, &quot;Let us fall by the hand of God, for he is most merciful; but let me not fall by the hand of man.&quot; () Psalm 103:8 praises God for his mercy.

===Other religions and beliefs===
Kwan Yin the bodhisattva of mercy and compassion, is one of the best known and most venerated Bodhisattva in Asia.

 (often translated as &quot;compassion&quot;) is part of the beliefs of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. is present in all schools of Buddhism and in Jainism it is viewed as one of the reflections of universal friendship.

The spiritual teacher Meher Baba described God as being &quot;all-merciful and eternally benevolent&quot; in his O Parvardigar prayer, and he held that we can approach God through the &quot;invocation of His mercy.&quot;

==Quotes==
* &quot;I have always found that mercy bears richer fruits than strict justice.&quot; ―Abraham Lincoln
* &quot;For children are innocent and love justice, while most of us are wicked and naturally prefer mercy.&quot; ―G.K. Chesterton
* &quot;You cannot conceive, nor can I, of the appalling strangeness of the mercy of God.&quot; ―Graham Greene, &quot;Brighton Rock&quot;
* &quot;&#x27;What a pity that Bilbo did not stab that vile creature, when he had a chance!&#x27; Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to strike without need. And he has been well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure that he took so little hurt from the evil, and escaped in the end, because he began his ownership of the Ring so. With Pity.&quot; ―J.R.R. Tolkien, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;

==Literature==
* In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, Portia, disguised as young lawyer Balthazar, begs Shylock to show mercy to her client Antonio: 
* In O. Henry&#x27;s &quot;A Retrieved Reformation&quot;, safecracker Jimmy Valentine betrays his identity and burglary skills in order to free a child accidentally trapped in a bank vault. A detective who has been pursuing him witnesses Valentine crack the safe. As Valentine subsequently surrenders, the detective pretends not to recognize him and walks away.

<text>Encarnación López Júlvez, better known by her stage name, La Argentinita (Buenos Aires, March 3, 1898 – New York, September 24, 1945), was a Spanish-Argentine flamenco dancer, choreographer and singer. La Argentinita was considered one of the highest expressions of this art form during her time.

==Life==
Encarnación López Júlvez was born on March 3rd, 1898, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. López Júlvez was the daughter of Spanish immigrants in Argentina, where her father had a fabric business. While living there, two of her siblings died in a scarlet fever epidemic. Consequently, she was brought to the north coast of Spain in 1901, where she began to learn Spanish regional dances.

When she was only four years old, she started learning flamenco from Julia Castelao. Her first public performance was at the age of eight at the Teatro-Circo de San Sebastián, in the Basque Country. She chose the name &quot;La Argentinita&quot; in deference to the famous flamenco dancer Antonia Mercé (La Argentina).

After travelling throughout Spain as a child prodigy, she settled in Madrid to perform at Teatro La Latina, Teatro de la Comedia, Teatro de La Princesa, Teatro Apolo and Teatro Príncipe Alfonso. Her success led her to tour in Barcelona, Portugal and Paris, and then Latin America. In the early 1920s, she returned to Spain, where she worked in Madrid. Among her early performances was the 1920 premiere of Federico García Lorca&#x27;s musical play &quot;El maleficio de la mariposa&quot; as &quot;the Butterfly&quot;. She announced her retirement in 1926, but would quickly return to the show business as part of the artistic renewal that led her to the Generation of ‘27, in which she combined flamenco, tango, bulerías and boleros. She danced to the compositions of Manuel de Falla, Joaquín Turina, Isaac Albéniz, Enrique Granados and Maurice Ravel. She helped in the development of Ballet Español.

Adapting pieces to popular tradition, she toured Europe, triumphing in Paris and Berlin and participating in the artistic movements of that time along with Spanish poets such as Rafael Alberti, Federico García Lorca, Edgar Neville and Ignacio Sánchez Mejías. Sánchez Mejías, an intellectual and bullfighter, was a married man and her lover. La Argentinita retired a second time to maintain her clandestine relationship with him. However, she would return to the stage with the aid of Sánchez Mejías, who participated in the search and employment of interpreters for her subsequent performances.

In 1931, López Júlvez and García Lorca recorded five gramophone slate records, which were accompanied by García Lorca&#x27;s piano. The selection of songs was prepared, adapted and titled &quot;Colección de Canciones Populares Españolas&quot; by García Lorca. Among the ten songs were &quot;Los cuatro muleros&quot;, &quot;Zorongo gitano&quot;, &quot;Anda Jaleo&quot; and &quot;En el Café de Chinitas&quot;.

With the beginning of the Second Spanish Republic, López Júlvez formed her own ballet company called Bailes Españoles de la Argentinita together with her sister, Pilar López Júlvez, and García Lorca. López Júlvez staged several flamenco theatrical shows, including an adaption of Falla&#x27;s &quot;El amor brujo&quot; (Love, the Magician) in 1933, and &quot;Las Calles de Cádiz&quot; (The Streets of Cadiz) in 1933 and 1940. She travelled through Spain and Paris, where she was recognized as one of the most important flamenco artists of her time. Her company included the flamenco figures Juana la Macarrona, La Malena, Fernanda Antúnez, Rafael Ortega and Antonio de Triana, who was her first dancing partner until the 1940s.

At the end of her tour around Spain, her lover Sánchez Mejías was gored to death in 1934 in the Manzanares bullring. She sought refuge in her work and moved to Buenos Aires to dance at the Teatro Colón; from there she embarked on a long American tour. In 1936 she achieved success in New York. Afterwards, she returned to Spain but was forced to flee the country shortly before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. She travelled through Morocco, France, the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium and the US, where she remained in exile in New York. From then until her death in 1945, she developed her career and became one of the biggest stars of international dance, and even participated in movies.

In 1943, she presented the flamenco troupe El Café de Chinitas at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York, with her own choreography, texts by García Lorca, scenery by Salvador Dalí and the orchestra directed by José Iturbi. In addition, she performed at the Washington DC Watergate complex with her sister.

On May 28, 1945, she gave her last performance at the Metropolitan of the orchestral work &quot;El Capricho Español&quot;, composed in 1887 by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and based on Spanish melodies. At the end of the event, she had to be admitted to a hospital, where she died on September 24 from a tumor in her abdomen. She did not want to have it operated on because she did not wish to abandon dancing. Her body was repatriated to Spain in December and buried in the Spanish capital. That same year, the company of Bailes Españoles de la Argentinita was dissolved.

Among the honours she received after her death was a plaque consecrated at the Metropolitan Opera House, positioned among the medals of Alfonso X El Sabio and La Orden de Isabel la Católica to honour her merits in the field of culture.

== Tributes ==

=== Portrait in the Julio Romero de Torres Museum ===

The Julio Romero de Torres Museum in Cordoba (Andalusia) has portrait of López Júlvez. The portrait, painted in 1915 by Julio Romero de Torres, was from a period in which his brushstroke and colour were influenced by the French Impressionist movement. The expression of La Argentinita is displaced to a second plane in order to highlight the relevance of colour, which is the focus of the painting.

=== &quot;Compañía de Bailes Españoles. Argentinita y Pilar López&quot; exhibition ===
A Segovian exhibition honoured Encarnación and Pilar López Júlvez. It was an initiative of their family, who for the first time displayed the artists&#x27; dresses for the public. This display consisted of 17 original costumes that the dancers wore in some of their most notable performances, including &quot;La cosecha&quot; by Enrique Granados and &quot;El Café de Chinitas&quot; by Federico García Lorca. It also included journalistic and artistic documentation, paintings, drawings and posters to promote the shows and contemporary portraits.

<text>U.S. Route 3 (US 3) is a United States Numbered Highway running from Cambridge, Massachusetts, through New Hampshire, to the Canada–United States border near Third Connecticut Lake, where it connects to Quebec Route 257.

Massachusetts Route 3 connects to the southern terminus of US 3 in Cambridge and continues south to Cape Cod. Though it shares a number, it has never been part of US 3. Both routes, which connect end-to-end, are treated as a single state highway by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT). From Cambridge to Burlington, US 3 is routed on surface streets through the dense suburbs in the Greater Boston area. After a brief concurrency with Interstate 95 (I-95) and Route 128, the route follows its own freeway northwest, bypassing Lowell and entering New Hampshire at Nashua, becoming the Everett Turnpike.

In New Hampshire, current and former parts of US 3 are known as the Daniel Webster Highway. From Burlington, Massachusetts, to Nashua, New Hampshire, US 3 is a freeway. The segment in New Hampshire is a free portion of the Everett Turnpike, while the portion in Massachusetts is known as the Northwest Expressway. From where it leaves the Everett Turnpike in Nashua northward, US 3 is generally a two-to-four lane at-grade road, though there are two super-two freeway portions in northern New Hampshire, one on the Laconia Bypass, and one where US 3 and I-93 use the Franconia Notch Parkway. The route serves as a major local arterial, connecting many of the cities of the densely populated Merrimack Valley. North of the White Mountains, the route serves as one of the only north–south roads connecting the communities of the Great North Woods Region and has New Hampshire&#x27;s only border crossing between the US and Canada.

===Massachusetts===

====Cambridge to Burlington====
US 3 begins in the south along Memorial Drive in Cambridge, along the Charles River, at an interchange with Massachusetts Avenue (Route 2A). The road continues as southbound Route 3 toward Downtown Boston, while northbound US 3 heads west, then north along the river toward Harvard University, joining with Route 2 along the way. It runs along the north bank of the Charles River, opposite Soldiers Field Road in Allston along this stretch. Passing south of Harvard Square, US 3 and Route 2 transition onto the Fresh Pond Parkway and join Route 16. Near Alewife station, Route 2 splits off as a freeway to the west (Concord Turnpike), while US 3 and Route 16 stay on the Alewife Brook Parkway. Shortly thereafter, US 3 splits from the parkway (which continues as Route 16) and joins Route 2A (Massachusetts Avenue) westbound, crossing into Arlington. In the center of town, US 3 and Route 2A split from Massachusetts Avenue and overlap briefly with Route 60 before continuing along Mystic Street. Route 2A splits from US 3 just to the north. US 3 continues through parts of Winchester and Woburn without any major intersections before entering Burlington and interchanging with I-95 and Route 128 (Yankee Division Highway) at exit 51A. US 3 joins the freeway to connect with the Northwest Expressway, while its historic surface alignment continues as Route 3A.

====Burlington to Tyngsborough (Northwest Expressway)====
US 3 runs along of I-95 (Route 128) in a wrong-way concurrency before exiting at exit 50A onto its own freeway, the Northwest Expressway.

Originally built in the 1950s, before the cancelation of the Inner Belt, the US 3 freeway was to have extended into metro Boston before being truncated to I-95. Consequently, a partially completed cloverleaf interchange connects US 3 to I-95. Exit numbers on the US 3 freeway start at milemarker 72 since Route 3 and US 3 are counted as one highway by MassDOT.

The freeway closely parallels Route 3A, the historic alignment of US 3, along its entire length from Burlington to the New Hampshire state border. It passes through Billerica and into Chelmsford, where it connects with I-495 and the Lowell Connector, a freeway spur into downtown Lowell. Continuing north, the freeway briefly enters Lowell, then passes through North Chelmsford and Tyngsborough before crossing the state line into Nashua, New Hampshire. The freeway continues north as the Everett Turnpike.

The Burlington to Tyngsborough area maintains a 501(c)(6) nonprofit representative entity known as the Middlesex 3 Coalition and its affiliate agency the Middlesex 3 TMA, which provides collaborative support to businesses and individuals within the jurisdiction to build consensus on transportation and developmental needs.

===New Hampshire===
US 3 passes through most of the state&#x27;s major cities and towns and is the only highway to extend from the Massachusetts state border in the south to the Canadian border in the north. Running for in New Hampshire, US 3 is by far the longest signed highway in the state. For much of its routing, US 3 closely parallels I-93, serving as a local route to the freeway.

==== Everett Turnpike (Nashua) ====
US 3 crosses the state border into Nashua and immediately becomes concurrent with the Everett Turnpike, running on the freeway for along the western side of the city. 

==== Daniel Webster Highway, local roads, and NH 28 concurrency (Nashua – Suncook) ====
US 3 leaves the Everett Turnpike at exit 7E, crosses New Hampshire Route 101A (NH 101A) and turns northeast for approximately along a segment known as the Henri Burque Highway, before turning north onto Concord Street, which soon becomes known as the Daniel Webster Highway. (Some locals erroneously refer to the Everett Turnpike from exit 7 through the I-293 interchange as US 3 and refer to the actual US 3 only as the Daniel Webster Highway or &quot;Old Route 3&quot;.)

US 3 continues north through the town of Merrimack and into Bedford, where it becomes South River Road. The highway parallels I-293 until it turns east in Manchester and then crosses the Merrimack River on Queen City Avenue, just after its intersection with I-293/NH 3A and NH 114A. US 3 and NH 3A are signed in a wrong-way concurrency for approximately before US 3 turns north onto Elm Street toward downtown Manchester. After approximately , US 3 turns east onto Webster Street, then joins NH 28 to proceed in a northeasterly direction toward Hooksett, interchanging with I-93. The two routes continue as Hooksett Road, then the Daniel Webster Highway.

==== In Concord ====
In Suncook, NH 28 leaves to the northeast, and US 3 proceeds northwest toward Concord on Pembroke Street, becoming Manchester Street when it enters the Concord city limits. After crossing the Merrimack River and interchanging with I-93, US 3 intersects NH 3A (South Main Street), which terminates at its parent route. US 3 traverses downtown Concord as North and South Main streets (briefly overlapping with US 202 and NH 9), then follows North State Street to Fisherville Road to Village Street in Penacook before crossing the Contoocook River into Boscawen. 

==== Further north (Boscawen – Lincoln) ====
US 3 travels north through Boscawen, briefly overlapping with US 4. The highway parallels the Merrimack River north into Franklin, where the highway meets NH 11. US 3 joins NH 11 and turns east; NH 3A also resumes at this intersection, continuing north. US 3 and NH 11 briefly form a three-route concurrency with NH 127 in Franklin, then pass through Tilton, crossing NH 132 and passing the western end of NH 140. Continuing northeast past Lake Winnisquam, US 3 and NH 11 reach Laconia and turn onto the Laconia–Gilford Bypass, intersecting with NH 106, NH 107, and NH 11A. At the northern end of the bypass, US 3 and NH 11 split after a overlap, with the U.S. Route continuing north on Lake Street to Weirs Beach and an intersection with NH 11B. US 3 continues north as the Daniel Webster Highway to Meredith at the northern end of Meredith Bay on Lake Winnipesaukee. In Meredith, US 3 intersects the northern terminus of NH 106, then joins NH 25 and continues north past Squam Lake into Holderness, passing the western terminuses of NH 25B and NH 113. Through Holderness, US 3 and NH 25 gradually turn west, then southwest, passing the southern end of NH 175 and then reaching the northern end of NH 132 in Ashland.

From Ashland to North Woodstock, US 3 proceeds north, roughly paralleling I-93 in the Pemigewasset River valley. Along this stretch it passes through the towns of Plymouth (NH 25 splits from US 3 near I-93 in Plymouth, which also marks the true northern terminus of NH 3A), West Campton (where it meets the western end of NH 49, the principal access road to Waterville Valley), Thornton, and Woodstock. In North Woodstock, US 3 crosses NH 112 (known to the east as the Kancamagus Highway).

==== Interstate 93 concurrency through the Franconia Notch State Park (Lincoln – Franconia) ====
Continuing north, US 3 joins with I-93 as it passes through Franconia Notch State Park, one of the more scenic drives in the White Mountains. This stretch of freeway is known as the Franconia Notch Parkway and is a rare section of Interstate Highway with only one lane in each direction.

==== Northernmost end (Franconia – Pittsburg) ====
US 3 separates from I-93 at exit 35, shortly north of the northern park boundary in Franconia. From there, NH 141 branches northwest and US 3 heads north and east toward Twin Mountain and a junction with US 302. This portion of the road is noted for fairly frequent moose sightings, especially during sunrise and sunset when moose are particularly active.

Heading north from Twin Mountain, US 3 passes through the village of Carroll, where NH 115 branches to the northeast and US 3 bears to the northwest and the town of Whitefield. In the center of Whitefield, NH 142 branches to the northwest and NH 116 crosses, running roughly southwest to northeast. US 3 continues north to Lancaster, where it joins US 2 in the town center, and where NH 135 branches off to the west. After US 2 leaves to the west, US 3 continues north, roughly paralleling the course of the Connecticut River (which also forms the border with Vermont), through Northumberland and Groveton, where NH 110 ends. North of Groveton, US 3 continues to follow the river, through Stratford, North Stratford, and Columbia, until it reaches Colebrook, where it crosses NH 26 and meets the southern terminus of NH 145. Still following the Connecticut River north, US 3 passes through portions of Stewartstown and Clarksville. In Stewartstown, the road turns more directly east (still following the Connecticut River, which is no longer a boundary), before resuming a northeasterly direction through Pittsburg. Its last major intersection is at the northern terminus of NH 145. US 3 continues north for another , eventually reaching the Pittsburg–Chartierville Border Crossing, where the road crosses into Chartierville, Quebec, and becomes Quebec Route 257.

In total, US 3 runs along the Connecticut River and its source lakes for approximately . Sections of US 3 in Colebrook are named after Scott E. Phillips and Leslie G. Lord, members of the New Hampshire State Police killed in the line of duty on August 19, 1997.

==History==

===New England route===
Before the establishment of the U.S. Numbered Highway System, the section of US 3 and Route 3 from Orleans, Massachusetts, to Colebrook, New Hampshire, was part of the New England road marking system as New England Route 6. It was replaced in its entirety with the establishment of US 3 and Route 3 in 1926.

===Massachusetts===
US 3 in Massachusetts closely follows the route of the early 19th-century Middlesex Canal and Middlesex Turnpike.

The modern Northwest Expressway was begun near Route 110 in Lowell before World War II. In the 1950s, it was extended south to Route 128 (later overlapped by I-95), and, by the 1960s, it was completed north from Chelmsford to New Hampshire. By 2005, the chronically congested four-lane road, largely with antiquated ramps around Lowell, was widened to six lanes (as it had been in Nashua, New Hampshire, a few years prior) with a breakdown lane on both the left and right sides of the road, and many interchanges were modernized in what was comically known as &quot;The Big Wide&quot;, in reference to Massachusetts&#x27; other &quot;Big&quot; construction project (the Big Dig). The roadbed and bridges were built to support a fourth lane in each travel direction for future expansion. The $365-million (equivalent to $ in ), widening project was completed in 2005 from Burlington to the New Hampshire border.

The final section of the expressway was planned for inner suburban towns northwest of Boston. The expressway was to supply a new route for US 3, between Route 128 and the canceled I-695 (Inner Belt). This was one of the expressway projects canceled in Governor Francis Sargent&#x27;s 1970 moratorium on expressway construction within Route 128. The latter section of the expressway was a key component of the &quot;Master Plan Highway Plan for Metropolitan Boston&quot;. The highway would have traveled through Lexington, Arlington, Medford, Somerville, and Cambridge, before linking with the Inner Belt Expressway.

The original plan called for US 3 and Route 2 to link up at the Lexington–Arlington border and continue southeasterly, crossing Route 16/Mystic Valley Parkway at the Arlington–Somerville border and proceeding into Cambridge toward Union Square, Somerville. A 1962 plan called for Route 2 and US 3 to converge at Alewife Brook Parkway with a longer stretch of new highway for US 3 paralleling Lowell Street in Lexington and Summer Street in Arlington.

Exit numbers along the Northwest Expressway section in Massachusetts were to be changed to mileage based numbers under a project to start in 2016, but that project was postponed. In November 2019, the MassDOT announced it would be proceeding with the project in 2020.

==Termini==
According to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) route log, the southern terminus of US 3 is at the junction of Route 2A and Route 3 in Cambridge, which is where Route 2A crosses the Charles along the Harvard Bridge (also known as the Massachusetts Avenue Bridge). This is a change from AASHTO&#x27;s 1989 Route Log which placed the terminus at US 20 in Boston, where Route 2 currently meets US 20 after crossing the Charles River at the Boston University Bridge. This was where US 3 met US 1 until that highway was rerouted in 1971.

The original northern terminus of US 3 (in 1926) was at Colebrook, New Hampshire, but the highway was extended to West Stewartstown in 1928 and to Pittsburg in 1937. Colebrook was the northern terminus again from 1939 to 1940. Since 1940, the highway has run through Pittsburg to the Pittsburg–Chartierville Border Crossing.

==Major intersections==
Although MassDOT inventories Route 3 and US 3 as one continuous route, this table includes the mileage only for US 3 starting from its southern terminus in Cambridge.





































==Special routes==
US 3 has one existing special route, a business route through Laconia, New Hampshire. Four other special routes may have existed in the past: an alternate and business route between Tyngsborough, Massachusetts, and Concord, New Hampshire, and bypass routes around Concord and Nashua, New Hampshire.

===Tyngsborough–Concord alternate route===
&#x27;

===Tyngsborough–Concord business route===
&#x27;

===Concord bypass route===
&#x27;

===Nashua bypass route===
&#x27;

===Laconia business loop===
U.S. Route 3 Business (US 3 Bus.) is a signed business route running north–south through downtown Laconia, New Hampshire. It runs from US 3 and NH 11 in Belmont north to US 3 in Laconia, along NH 107 and NH 11A. It is a former alignment of US 3, used before the Laconia–Gilford bypass was built.

<text>Karita Marjatta Mattila (born 5 September 1960) is a Finnish operatic soprano.

Mattila appears regularly in the major opera houses worldwide, including the Metropolitan Opera, the Royal Opera House in London, Théâtre du Châtelet, Opéra Bastille, the Lyric Opera of Chicago, San Francisco Opera, Houston Grand Opera, Vienna State Opera, Toronto Roy Thomson Hall, and Großes Festspielhaus in Salzburg.

==Career==

Born in Somero, Finland, Mattila graduated 1983 from the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, where she studied singing with Liisa Linko-Malmio. She then continued her studies with Vera Rózsa in London.

Also in 1983, Mattila won the first Cardiff Singer of the World Competition. In 1985, she made her Royal Opera House, Covent Garden debut as Fiordiligi in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;.

She was seen as Emma in the first ever televised production of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Fierrabras&quot; at the Vienna State Opera in 1988. In 1990 she made her Metropolitan Opera debut as Donna Elvira in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;.

In 1994, she made her Spanish debut as Tatyana in Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; in Madrid, and 1996 debuts in Paris in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlos&quot;.

Mattila has won Grammy Awards for &quot;Best Opera Recording&quot; for &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot; in 1998 and for &quot;Jenůfa&quot; in 2004. She was awarded the Evening Standard Ballet, Opera and Classical Music Award for &quot;Outstanding Performance of the Year&quot; in 1998 for her performance of Elisabeth in &quot;Don Carlos&quot; at the Royal Opera House.

In 2001 &quot;The New York Times&quot; chose Karita Mattila as the best singer of the year for her performance in &quot;Fidelio&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera, and in the same year she was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Opera&quot;.

Mattila&#x27;s 2004 New York performances in &quot;Salome&quot; and subsequent &quot;Káťa Kabanová&quot; inspired the New York press to write: &quot;When the history of the Metropolitan Opera around the time of the millennium is written, Karita Mattila will deserve her own chapter.&quot;

In 2005, she was named &quot;Musician of the Year 2005&quot; by &quot;Musical America&quot;, which describes her &quot;the most electrifying singing actress of our day, the kind of performer who renews an aging art form and drives the public into frenzies.&quot; &quot;BBC Music Magazine&quot; named Mattila as one of the top 20 sopranos of the recorded era in 2007.

Worldwide audiences saw Mattila in &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; live in movie theatres in 2008. Metropolitan&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot; and &quot;Tosca&quot; were seen live in High Definition worldwide in 2008 and 2009, respectively.

In 2010 at Opéra National de Lyon, Mattila created the role of Émilie du Châtelet in Kaija Saariaho&#x27;s monodrama &quot;Émilie&quot;, which was dedicated to her.

In 2014, Mattila was scheduled to sing &quot;Four Last Songs&quot; with the Munich Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall. However, when Valery Gergiev, who had publicly supported Vladimir Putin&#x27;s stance on Ukraine and gay rights, was brought in to conduct, she refused to perform if he remained. Gergiev was replaced with Fabio Luisi. Mattila received threats for her action.

In 2020, Mattila played a parody of herself as an opera diva stuck in Finland, in the new comic opera &quot;Covid fan tutte&quot;.

In December 2020 Mattila was awarded the Order of the Lion of Finland, Commander, First Class.

==Personal life==
Mattila lives in Naples, Florida. Before moving to Florida in the mid-2000s, she lived in London, England, for about twenty years. 

In 1988 she met and, in 1992, married Tapio Kuneinen, who served as her manager. They divorced in February 2019.

She has been active on Twitter since October 2018, and has stated that it was a &quot;lifesaver&quot; after her divorce.

Upon the abrupt cancellation of her &quot;Jenůfa&quot; at the Royal Opera House in late February 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, she moved to an apartment in Helsinki, Finland, until she was able to travel and work safely again and return home. She returned to Florida in April 2021.

<text>The relatively static membrane potential of cells is called the resting membrane potential (or resting voltage), as opposed to the specific dynamic electrochemical phenomena called action potential and graded membrane potential. The resting membrane potential has a value of approximately -70mV or -0.07V. 

Apart from the latter two, which occur in excitable cells (neurons, muscles, and some secretory cells in glands), membrane voltage in the majority of non-excitable cells can also undergo changes in response to environmental or intracellular stimuli. The resting potential exists due to the differences in membrane permeabilities for potassium, sodium, calcium, and chloride ions, which in turn result from functional activity of various ion channels, ion transporters, and exchangers. Conventionally, resting membrane potential can be defined as a relatively stable, ground value of transmembrane voltage in animal and plant cells.
Because the membrane permeability for potassium is much higher than that for other ions, and because of the strong chemical gradient for potassium, potassium ions flow from the cytosol out to the extracellular space carrying out positive charge, until their movement is balanced by build-up of negative charge on the inner surface of the membrane. Again, because of the high relative permeability for potassium, the resulting membrane potential is almost always close to the potassium reversal potential. But in order for this process to occur, a concentration gradient of potassium ions must first be set up. This work is done by the ion pumps/transporters and/or exchangers and generally is powered by ATP.

In the case of the resting membrane potential across an animal cell&#x27;s plasma membrane, potassium (and sodium) gradients are established by the Na+/K+-ATPase (sodium-potassium pump) which transports 2 potassium ions inside and 3 sodium ions outside at the cost of 1 ATP molecule. In other cases, for example, a membrane potential may be established by acidification of the inside of a membranous compartment (such as the proton pump that generates membrane potential across synaptic vesicle membranes).

==Electroneutrality==

In most quantitative treatments of membrane potential, such as the derivation of Goldman equation, electroneutrality is assumed; that is, that there is no measurable charge excess on either side of the membrane. So, although there is an electric potential across the membrane due to charge separation, there is no actual measurable difference in the global concentration of positive and negative ions across the membrane (as it is estimated below), that is, there is no actual measurable charge excess on either side. That occurs because the effect of charge on electrochemical potential is hugely greater than the effect of concentration so an undetectable change in concentration creates a great change in electric potential. 

==Generation of the resting potential==

Cell membranes are typically permeable to only a subset of ions. These usually include potassium ions, chloride ions, bicarbonate ions, and others. To simplify the description of the ionic basis of the resting membrane potential, it is most useful to consider only one ionic species at first, and consider the others later. Since trans-plasma-membrane potentials are almost always determined primarily by potassium permeability, that is where to start.

*Panel 1 of the diagram shows a diagrammatic representation of a simple cell where a concentration gradient has already been established. This panel is drawn as if the membrane has no permeability to any ion. There is no membrane potential because despite there being a concentration gradient for potassium, there is no net charge imbalance across the membrane. If the membrane were to become permeable to a type of ion that is more concentrated on one side of the membrane, then that ion would contribute to membrane voltage because the permeant ions would move across the membrane with net movement of that ion type down the concentration gradient. There would be net movement from the side of the membrane with a higher concentration of the ion to the side with lower concentration. Such a movement of one ion across the membrane would result in a net imbalance of charge across the membrane and a membrane potential. This is a common mechanism by which many cells establish a membrane potential.
*In panel 2 of the diagram, the cell membrane has been made permeable to potassium ions, but not the anions (An−) inside the cell. These anions are mostly contributed by protein. There is energy stored in the potassium ion concentration gradient that can be converted into an electrical gradient when potassium (K+) ions move out of the cell. Note that potassium ions can move across the membrane in both directions but by the purely statistical process that arises from the higher concentration of potassium ions inside the cell, there will be more potassium ions moving out of the cell. Because there is a higher concentration of potassium ions inside the cells, their random molecular motion is more likely to encounter the permeability pore (ion channel) that is the case for the potassium ions that are outside and at a lower concentration. An internal K+ is simply &quot;more likely&quot; to leave the cell than an extracellular K+ is to enter it. It is a matter of diffusion doing work by dissipating the concentration gradient. As potassium leaves the cell, it is leaving behind the anions. Therefore, a charge separation is developing as K+ leaves the cell. This charge separation creates a transmembrane voltage. This transmembrane voltage is the membrane potential. As potassium continues to leave the cell, separating more charges, the membrane potential will continue to grow. The length of the arrows (green indicating concentration gradient, red indicating voltage), represents the magnitude of potassium ion movement due to each form of energy. The direction of the arrow indicates the direction in which that particular force is applied. Thus, the building membrane voltage is an increasing force that acts counter to the tendency for net movement of potassium ions down the potassium concentration gradient.
*In Panel 3, the membrane voltage has grown to the extent that its &quot;strength&quot; now matches the concentration gradients. Since these forces (which are applied to K+) are now the same strength and oriented in opposite directions, the system is now in equilibrium. Put another way, the tendency of potassium to leave the cell by running down its concentration gradient is now matched by the tendency of the membrane voltage to pull potassium ions back into the cell. K+ continues to move across the membrane, but the rate at which it enters and leaves the cell are the same, thus, there is no net potassium current. Because the K+ is at equilibrium, membrane potential is stable, or &quot;resting&quot; (EK).

The resting voltage is the result of several ion-translocating enzymes (uniporters, cotransporters, and pumps) in the plasma membrane, steadily operating in parallel, whereby each ion-translocator has its characteristic electromotive force (= reversal potential = &#x27;equilibrium voltage&#x27;), depending on the particular substrate concentrations inside and outside (internal ATP included in case of some pumps). H+ exporting ATPase render the membrane voltage in plants and fungi much more negative than in the more extensively investigated animal cells, where the resting voltage is mainly determined by selective ion channels.

In most neurons the resting potential has a value of approximately −70 mV. The resting potential is mostly determined by the concentrations of the ions in the fluids on both sides of the cell membrane and the ion transport proteins that are in the cell membrane. How the concentrations of ions and the membrane transport proteins influence the value of the resting potential is outlined below.

The resting potential of a cell can be most thoroughly understood by thinking of it in terms of equilibrium potentials. In the example diagram here, the model cell was given only one permeant ion (potassium). In this case, the resting potential of this cell would be the same as the equilibrium potential for potassium.

However, a real cell is more complicated, having permeabilities to many ions, each of which contributes to the resting potential. To understand better, consider a cell with only two permeant ions, potassium, and sodium. Consider a case where these two ions have equal concentration gradients directed in opposite directions, and that the membrane permeabilities to both ions are equal. K+ leaving the cell will tend to drag the membrane potential toward &quot;E&quot;K. Na+ entering the cell will tend to drag the membrane potential toward the reversal potential for sodium &quot;E&quot;Na. Since the permeabilities to both ions were set to be equal, the membrane potential will, at the end of the Na+/K+ tug-of-war, end up halfway between &quot;E&quot;Na and &quot;E&quot;K. As &quot;E&quot;Na and &quot;E&quot;K were equal but of opposite signs, halfway in between is zero, meaning that the membrane will rest at 0 mV.
Note that even though the membrane potential at 0 mV is stable, it is not an equilibrium condition because neither of the contributing ions is in equilibrium. Ions diffuse down their electrochemical gradients through ion channels, but the membrane potential is upheld by continual K+ influx and Na+ efflux via ion transporters. Such situation with similar permeabilities for counter-acting ions, like potassium and sodium in animal cells, can be extremely costly for the cell if these permeabilities are relatively large, as it takes a lot of ATP energy to pump the ions back. Because no real cell can afford such equal and large ionic permeabilities at rest, resting potential of animal cells is determined by predominant high permeability to potassium and adjusted to the required value by modulating sodium and chloride permeabilities and gradients.

In a healthy animal cell Na+ permeability is about 5% of the K+ permeability or even less, whereas the respective reversal potentials are +60 mV for sodium (&quot;E&quot;Na)and −80 mV for potassium (&quot;E&quot;K). Thus the membrane potential will not be right at &quot;E&quot;K, but rather depolarized from &quot;E&quot;K by an amount of approximately 5% of the 140 mV difference between &quot;E&quot;K and &quot;E&quot;Na. Thus, the cell&#x27;s resting potential will be about −73 mV.

In a more formal notation, the membrane potential is the weighted average of each contributing ion&#x27;s equilibrium potential. The size of each weight is the relative conductance of each ion. In the normal case, where three ions contribute to the membrane potential:
:formula_1,
where 
*&quot;E&quot;m is the membrane potential, measured in volts
*&quot;E&quot;X is the equilibrium potential for ion X, also in volts
*&quot;g&quot;X/&quot;g&quot;tot is the relative conductance of ion X, which is dimensionless
*&quot;g&quot;tot is the total conductance of all permeant ions in arbitrary units (e.g. siemens for electrical conductance), in this case &quot;g&quot;K+ + &quot;g&quot;Na+ + &quot;g&quot;Cl−

== Membrane transport proteins ==
For determination of membrane potentials, the two most important types of membrane ion transport proteins are ion channels and ion transporters. Ion channel proteins create paths across cell membranes through which ions can passively diffuse without direct expenditure of metabolic energy. They have selectivity for certain ions, thus, there are potassium-, chloride-, and sodium-selective ion channels. Different cells and even different parts of one cell (dendrites, cell bodies, nodes of Ranvier) will have different amounts of various ion transport proteins. Typically, the amount of certain potassium channels is most important for control of the resting potential (see below). Some ion pumps such as the Na+/K+-ATPase are electrogenic, that is, they produce charge imbalance across the cell membrane and can also contribute directly to the membrane potential. Most pumps use metabolic energy (ATP) to function.

== Equilibrium potentials ==
For most animal cells potassium ions (K+) are the most important for the resting potential. Due to the active transport of potassium ions, the concentration of potassium is higher inside cells than outside. Most cells have potassium-selective ion channel proteins that remain open all the time. There will be net movement of positively charged potassium ions through these potassium channels with a resulting accumulation of excess negative charge inside of the cell. The outward movement of positively charged potassium ions is due to random molecular motion (diffusion) and continues until enough excess negative charge accumulates inside the cell to form a membrane potential which can balance the difference in concentration of potassium between inside and outside the cell. &quot;Balance&quot; means that the electrical force (potential) that results from the build-up of ionic charge, and which impedes outward diffusion, increases until it is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the tendency for outward diffusive movement of potassium. This balance point is an &quot;equilibrium potential&quot; as the net transmembrane flux (or current) of K+ is zero. A good approximation for the equilibrium potential of a given ion only needs the concentrations on either side of the membrane and the temperature. It can be calculated using the Nernst equation:
:formula_2
where 
*&quot;E&quot;eq,K+ is the equilibrium potential for potassium, measured in volts
*&quot;R&quot; is the universal gas constant, equal to 8.314 joules·K−1·mol−1
*&quot;T&quot; is the absolute temperature, measured in kelvins (= K = degrees Celsius + 273.15)
*&quot;z&quot; is the number of elementary charges of the ion in question involved in the reaction
*&quot;F&quot; is the Faraday constant, equal to 96,485 coulombs·mol−1 or J·V−1·mol−1
*[K+]o is the extracellular concentration of potassium, measured in mol·m−3 or mmol·l−1
*[K+]i is likewise the intracellular concentration of potassium

Potassium equilibrium potentials of around −80 millivolts (inside negative) are common. Differences are observed in different species, different tissues within the same animal, and the same tissues under different environmental conditions. Applying the Nernst Equation above, one may account for these differences by changes in relative K+ concentration or differences in temperature.

For common usage the Nernst equation is often given in a simplified form by assuming typical human body temperature (37 °C), reducing the constants and switching to Log base 10. (The units used for concentration are unimportant as they will cancel out into a ratio). For Potassium at normal body temperature one may calculate the equilibrium potential in millivolts as:

:formula_3

Likewise the equilibrium potential for sodium (Na+) at normal human body temperature is calculated using the same simplified constant. You can calculate E assuming an outside concentration, [K+]o, of 10mM and an inside concentration, [K+]i, of 100mM. For chloride ions (Cl−) the sign of the constant must be reversed (−61.54 mV). If calculating the equilibrium potential for calcium (Ca2+) the 2+ charge halves the simplified constant to 30.77 mV. If working at room temperature, about 21 °C, the calculated constants are approximately 58 mV for K+ and Na+, −58 mV for Cl− and 29 mV for Ca2+. At physiological temperature, about 29.5 °C, and physiological concentrations (which vary for each ion), the calculated potentials are approximately 67 mV for Na+, −90 mV for K+, −86 mV for Cl− and 123 mV for Ca2+.

== Resting potentials ==

The resting membrane potential is not an equilibrium potential as it relies on the constant expenditure of energy (for ionic pumps as mentioned above) for its maintenance. It is a dynamic diffusion potential that takes this mechanism into account—wholly unlike the pillows equilibrium potential, which is true no matter the nature of the system under consideration. The resting membrane potential is dominated by the ionic species in the system that has the greatest conductance across the membrane. For most cells this is potassium. As potassium is also the ion with the most negative equilibrium potential, usually the resting potential can be no more negative than the potassium equilibrium potential. The resting potential can be calculated with the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz voltage equation using the concentrations of ions as for the equilibrium potential while also including the relative permeabilities of each ionic species. Under normal conditions, it is safe to assume that only potassium, sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions play large roles for the resting potential:

:formula_4

This equation resembles the Nernst equation, but has a term for each permeant ion. Also, &quot;z&quot; has been inserted into the equation, causing the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of Cl− to be reversed relative to K+ and Na+, as chloride&#x27;s negative charge is handled by inverting the fraction inside the logarithmic term. *&quot;E&quot;m is the membrane potential, measured in volts *&quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, and &quot;F&quot; are as above *&quot;P&quot;s is the relative permeability of ion s *[s]Y is the concentration of ion s in compartment Y as above. Another way to view the membrane potential, considering instead the conductance of the ion channels rather than the permeability of the membrane, is using the Millman equation (also called the Chord Conductance Equation): 
:formula_5

or reformulated

:formula_6

where &quot;g&quot;tot is the combined conductance of all ionic species, again in arbitrary units. The latter equation portrays the resting membrane potential as a &quot;weighted average&quot; of the reversal potentials of the system, where the weights are the relative conductances of each ion species (&quot;g&quot;X/&quot;g&quot;tot). During the action potential, these weights change. If the conductances of Na+ and Cl− are zero, the membrane potential reduces to the Nernst potential for K+ (as &quot;g&quot;K+ = &quot;g&quot;tot). Normally, under resting conditions &quot;g&quot;Na+ and &quot;g&quot;Cl− are not zero, but they are much smaller than &quot;g&quot;K+, which renders &quot;E&quot;m close to &quot;E&quot;eq,K+. Medical conditions such as hyperkalemia in which blood serum potassium (which governs [K+]o) is changed are very dangerous since they offset &quot;E&quot;eq,K+, thus affecting &quot;E&quot;m. This may cause arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. The use of a bolus injection of potassium chloride in executions by lethal injection stops the heart by shifting the resting potential to a more positive value, which depolarizes and contracts the cardiac cells permanently, not allowing the heart to repolarize and thus enter diastole to be refilled with blood.

Although the GHK voltage equation and Millman&#x27;s equation are related, they are not equivalent. The critical difference is that Millman&#x27;s equation assumes the current-voltage relationship to be ohmic, whereas the GHK voltage equation takes into consideration the small, instantaneous rectifications predicted by the GHK flux equation caused by the concentration gradient of ions. Thus, a more accurate estimate of membrane potential can be calculated using the GHK equation than with Millman&#x27;s equation.

== Measuring resting potentials ==
In some cells, the membrane potential is always changing (such as cardiac pacemaker cells). For such cells there is never any &quot;rest&quot; and the &quot;resting potential&quot; is a theoretical concept. Other cells with little in the way of membrane transport functions that change with time have a resting membrane potential that can be measured by inserting an electrode into the cell. Transmembrane potentials can also be measured optically with dyes that change their optical properties according to the membrane potential.

==Summary of resting potential values in different types of cells==
== History ==
Resting currents in nerves were measured and described by Julius Bernstein in 1902 where he proposed a &quot;Membrane Theory&quot; that explained the resting potential of nerve and muscle as a diffusion potential.

<text>Market liberalism is used in two distinct ways. In the United States, the term is used as a synonym to classical liberalism. In this sense, market liberalism depicts a political ideology, combining a market economy with personal liberty and human rights in contrast to social liberalism, which combines personal liberty and human rights along with a mixed economy and welfare state.

In Europe and elsewhere, the term &quot;market liberalism&quot; is often used as a synonym to economic liberalism, depicting a policy supporting the economic aspects of liberalism, without necessarily including the political aspects of liberalism. In some political spheres, market liberalism refers to an economically liberal society that also provides a minimal to moderate-sized welfare state for its citizens.

<doc id="777090" wikidata="Q719551" url="?curid=777090" title="Shintaro Katsu">
<text>was a Japanese actor, singer, and filmmaker. He is known for starring in the &quot;Akumyo&quot; series, the &quot;Hoodlum Soldier&quot; series, and the &quot;Zatoichi&quot; series.

==Life and career==
Born Toshio Okumura (奥村 利夫 &quot;Okumura Toshio&quot;) on 29 November 1931. He was the son of Minoru Okumura (奥村 実), a noted kabuki performer who went by the stage name Katsutōji Kineya (杵屋 勝東治) and who was renowned for his nagauta and shamisen skills. He was the younger brother of actor Tomisaburo Wakayama.

Shintaro Katsu began his career in entertainment as a shamisen player. He switched to acting because he noticed it was better paid. In the 1960s he starred simultaneously in three long-running series of films, the Akumyo series, the Hoodlum Soldier series, and the Zatoichi series.

He played the role of blind masseur Zatoichi in a series of 25 films between 1962 and 1973, in 100 episodes across a four season television series from 1974 to 1979, and in a 26th and final film in 1989, which he also directed.

In 1967, Katsu formed the company Katsu Productions.

Katsu had a troubled personal life. A heavy drinker, Katsu had several brushes with the law over drug use as well, including marijuana, opium and cocaine with arrests in 1978, 1990 and 1992.

He had also developed a reputation as a troublemaker on set. When director Akira Kurosawa cast him for the lead role in &quot;Kagemusha&quot; (1980), Katsu left before the first day of shooting was over. Though accounts differ as to the incident, the most consistent one details Katsu&#x27;s clash with Kurosawa regarding bringing his own film crew to the set (to film Kurosawa in action for later exhibition to his own acting students). Kurosawa is reputed to have taken great offense at this, resulting in Katsu&#x27;s termination (he was replaced by Tatsuya Nakadai). In her book, &quot;Waiting on the Weather&quot;, about her experiences with director Kurosawa, script supervisor Teruyo Nogami chalks the differences between Katsu and Kurosawa up to a personality clash that had unfortunate artistic results.

He was the husband of actress Tamao Nakamura (married in 1962), and father of actor Ryutaro Gan (&quot;Gan Ryūtarō&quot;).

Stunt actor Yukio Kato was killed on the set of the 26th &quot;Zatoichi&quot; film by Katsu&#x27;s son, who was co-starring, when an actual sword was mistaken for a prop, fatally wounding Kato.

In her book, &quot;Geisha, A Life&quot;, Kyoto geisha Mineko Iwasaki claimed to have had a long time affair with Katsu, whom she calls by his given name, Toshio. The affair ended in 1976, and eventually the two became good friends until his death.

Katsu produced the manga-based &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; (&quot;Kozure Okami&quot;) series of jidaigeki films starring his brother Tomisaburo Wakayama, two of which were later compiled into the movie &quot;Shogun Assassin&quot;, as well as co-writing, producing, and acting alongside his brother in the TV jidaigeki series &quot;Oshizamurai Kiichihōgan&quot; (&quot;Mute Samurai&quot;) and &quot;Tsūkai! Kōchiyama Sōshun&quot;.

His other television work includes the police drama &quot;&quot; (&quot;Superintendent K&quot;) which he starred in (as Katsutoshi Gatsu), co-wrote, directed, and produced. His daughter, , co-starred.

His film work includes the &quot;Hanzo the Razor&quot; series as Detective Itami Hanzo. He was also an accomplished shamisen player, as well as a vocalist, recording several albums in both pop and Enka.

He died of pharyngeal cancer on 21 June 1997.

The character Fujitora in the manga series &quot;One Piece&quot; is based on him.

<text>Hygiene programs provide basic hygiene facilities to people experiencing homelessness. Some are stand-alone hygiene centers while others are at locations that also provide additional kinds of services. They are a response to addressing homelessness, alongside things like basic homeless shelters that just provide a bed and toilet for the night, or soup kitchens which often do not have places for patrons to wash their hands.

They may have a toilet, wash basin, and a shower, and many have other amenities, such as a mirror to assist with shaving and applying cosmetics, a diaper-changing station, electric outlets for appliances such as irons, private dressing stalls, laundry facilities, or hygiene supplies such as soap, toothpaste, tampons, pads, or condoms.

Such facilities also offer people experiencing homelessness an alternative to using restrooms in libraries and other public buildings.

== Mobile shower programs ==
There are also dozens of &quot;mobile&quot; hygiene programs that provide services by using shower trailers that can be driven or towed to various locations.

<doc id="777118" wikidata="Q1774102" url="?curid=777118" title="Nut (climbing)">
<text>In rock climbing, a nut (or &quot;chock&quot; or &quot;chockstone&quot; or wire for the smallest versions) is a metal wedge threaded on a wire that climbers use for protection by wedging it into a crack in the rock. Quickdraws are clipped to the nut wire by the ascending climber and the rope threads through the quickdraw. Nuts come in a variety of sizes and styles, and several different brands are made by competing manufacturers. Most nuts are made of aluminum. Larger nuts may be threaded on Dyneema cord instead of wire, but this has become unusual.

The very smallest nuts are known as &quot;micronuts&quot; and may be made of brass or other metal, and typically have their wires soldered into them, instead of looped through drilled holes. They are mostly used in aid climbing, and their value as protection, arresting a climber&#x27;s fall, is marginal because of both their low breaking strength and their tiny surface area (the HB 0 measures about 4 x 7 x 2.5 mm) in contact with the rock, though this can be offset if several are placed at a time. Other names used include &quot;RPs&quot; (the brand name of the first commercially available micronuts) and &quot;brassies&quot;. They are available from several manufacturers in a variety of styles. 

British climbers in the 1950s and 1960s were the first to use nuts as climbing protection. In addition to using pitons, they picked up machine nuts from the side of railway tracks, climbed with them in their pockets, and used them as artificial chocks. This developed to the point where they drilled the thread from the middle, threaded them with slings, and used them in cracks.

Nuts or chockstones are named after natural stones occasionally found wedged into cracks. Climbers eventually realized they could insert their own found pebble into a suitable crack. In an article called &quot;Artificial Aids in Mountaineering&quot; dated Oct-Dec 1956, G Sutton wrote about jammed knots for direct aid. He also compared the use of slings, chocks (rocks) and jammed knots to artificial climbing (aid climbing) and that &quot;there should be no illusion that the use of a chockstone is in any way more admirable than that of a piton.&quot; 

By 1967 Royal Robbins saw the need for clean climbing and put up Nutcracker, an all nut protected 6 pitch climb, on the Manure Pile (Ranger Rock), Yosemite. In 1972, when clean climbing became an issue in the US, Yvon Chouinard began manufacturing chocks made specifically for rock climbing, with the familiar wedge shape still in use today. With Tom Frost, Chouinard invented a larger, six-sided nut called a Hexentric or hex. Prominent climbers like Henry Barber and John Stannard helped popularize the use of nuts, especially after it was discovered that a nut was lighter and easier to place and remove while climbing, as well as being at least as secure as a well-placed piton, and less damaging to the rock.

Nuts are available in different shapes to help the climber find the best fit for a given crack. Curved nuts have a concave face on one side and a convex face on the other. Larger nuts can be placed in either of two aspects (hexes in three aspects) to suit different-width cracks, with either the main faces or the sides in contact with the rock.

Nuts may be generically referred to as &quot;wires&quot; or &quot;stoppers&quot;, though &quot;Stopper&quot; is a brand name of a nut made by Black Diamond Equipment.

<doc id="777127" wikidata="Q3854309" url="?curid=777127" title="Meltdown (Ash album)">
<text>Meltdown is the fourth studio album to be recorded by the Northern Irish rock band Ash. The album was released on 17 May 2004 through Infectious Records and Home Grown. Following the success of their third studio album &quot;Free All Angels&quot; (2001), Ash debuted several new songs while touring throughout 2003. By October that year, they had travelled to Los Angeles, California, to record a follow-up album, which was co-produced by Nick Raskulinecz and the band. Recording sessions were held at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys and at Chalice Studios, Hollywood. &quot;Meltdown&quot;, which is described as a hard rock album, drew comparisons to the work of The Smashing Pumpkins and critics said the guitar work resembles that of Black Sabbath and Metallica.

The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Clones&quot; was released in late February 2004, coinciding with a European tour and a UK club tour. The second single &quot;Orpheus&quot; was released in May to accompany another UK tour. &quot;Starcrossed&quot; was the third single; it was released that July. During the next few months, Ash appeared at the Reading and Leeds Festivals, embarked on a European tour, and supported the Darkness on their UK tour. With the release of the fourth single &quot;Renegade Cavalcade&quot; in December, the band twice toured Japan and the US; the second stint coincided with the release of the fifth single &quot;Meltdown&quot; in May 2005.

&quot;Meltdown&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics, some of whom commented on the band members&#x27; musicianship. The album peaked at number five in the UK and Scotland, and at number six in Ireland. It also charted in Australia, Austria, Germany, and Norway. &quot;Meltdown&quot; was certified gold in the UK. All of the singles except for &quot;Meltdown&quot; reached the top 40 in the UK and Ireland; &quot;Clones&quot; was the best-selling single, peaking at number 12 in Ireland.

==Background and production==

In April 2001, Ash released their third studio album &quot;Free All Angels&quot;, which was a commercial success, saving the band from the brink of bankruptcy. It reached number one in the UK and spawned five UK top 40 singles. As early as August 2001, the band were pondering what to do for their next album. When touring the US, they listened to a lot of rock radio. Frontman Tim Wheeler wanted the follow-up to be a heavy rock album with similarities to Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; (1987) and Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot; (1991). In September 2002, Ash released their first compilation album Intergalactic Sonic 7″s, which they promoted with a three-month supporting US tour with Saves the Day. Wheeler wrote 14 new songs after attending a February 2003 peace march.

In March 2003, Wheeler told the &quot;NME&quot; he wanted to experiment with electronic music for the band&#x27;s next album after using computers to score a short film. In May and June 2003, Ash embarked on their first headlining US tour in five years. Throughout the year, the band debuted several new songs. In October, Ash went to Los Angeles, California, to record their next album, staying at Julia Roberts&#x27; former home in Beverly Hills. Recording sessions were held at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys and at Chalice Studios in Hollywood; recordings were co-produced by Ash and Nick Raskulinecz. Ash worked with Raskulinecz at the recommendation of Andy Gill from Gang of Four, who told Wheeler he &quot;got the best drum sound he&#x27;s ever heard&quot; from using Raskulinecz.

The band also chose to work with Nick Raskulinecz because they wanted the album to have an American sound to it; according to Wheeler, American-made albums &quot;sound better sonically&quot;, with &quot;better engineering, better studios, so we wanted to check it out .&quot; Wheeler said they recorded guitar, vocals, drums and bass in that order, which contrasted with their usual method of recording bass and drums first. Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl visited the studio a few times during the recording but the band refrained from asking him to play on any recordings; Wheeler said; &quot;There&#x27;s a whole bunch of people we could have called, but we just want to get our band&#x27;s sound on record&quot;. Despite planning to have finished by November, the sessions continued until January 2004. Rich Costey mixed the recordings at Cello Studios, also in Hollywood, with assistance from Claudius Mittendorfer. Howie Weinberg mastered the album at Masterdisk.

==Composition==
&quot;Meltdown&quot; has been described as a hard rock album that has influences from metal and has been compared with the works of Smashing Pumpkins. The guitar work throughout the album is similar to that of Black Sabbath and Metallica, and includes numerous solos played by Ash&#x27;s guitarist Charlotte Hatherley. &quot;Meltdown&quot; is a departure from the pop punk style of &quot;Free All Angels&quot;, and is the band&#x27;s heaviest-sounding release. Discussing the album&#x27;s title, Wheeler said; &quot;Why? Cos it&#x27;s a meltdown. A full-on rock monster. A real face-melter. It&#x27;ll tear your face off.&quot; Wheeler wrote all of the songs except &quot;Meltdown&quot; – which he co-wrote with Hatherley – and &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, which he co-wrote with bassist Mark Hamilton. Dracula is a reoccurring lyrical theme on the album.

The opening track &quot;Meltdown&quot; is a political piece that channels the sound of AC/DC and Foo Fighters. Wheeler wrote it after witnessing a peace demonstration and Hatherley wrote the middle eight guitar riff. &quot;Orpheus&quot; switches between indie pop and heavy rock, and the verses include Wheeler&#x27;s 1970s metal-style guitar riffs. Wheeler said the lyrics were taken from the eponymous Greek myth and is about the death of his friend&#x27;s mother. &quot;Evil Eye&quot; is a slower track on which Wheeler and Hatherley trade vocals that tells the story of a female . It features a backwards message that says &quot;She&#x27;s giving me the Evil Eye. Suck Satan&#x27;s cock.&quot; Wheeler said &quot;Clones&quot; is about the homogenization of mankind, and is &quot;a rant about some person who&#x27;s let you down, a person you thought was different and they turn out to be the same as everyone else&quot;. The song has an instrumental break section that was influenced by the works of Rage Against the Machine.

&quot;Starcrossed&quot; is a string-led power ballad that is reminiscent of the material on &quot;Free All Angels&quot;. It re-tells the story of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; evokes &quot;Song 2&quot; (1997) by Blur and &quot;Surf Wax America&quot; (1994) by Weezer. Wheeler said the final version of &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; is the result of merging two separate songs. &quot;Renegade Cavalcade&quot; features staccato guitar parts during the verses. &quot;Detonator&quot; utilizes the talking guitar in vein of Peter Frampton during the verse sections; it is followed by the Foo Fighters-esque &quot;On a Wave&quot;. &quot;Won&#x27;t Be Saved&quot; is similar to the band&#x27;s earlier material and was nearly left off the final version of the album but the band&#x27;s agent persuaded them to keep it. &quot;Vampire Love&quot;, which has Placebo-like lyrics and a cello part played by Oli Kraus, closes the album.

==Release==
On 29 January 2004, &quot;Meltdown&quot; was announced for release later that year. &quot;Clones&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single on 25 February as a download-only single. The song&#x27;s music video, which was filmed in the basement of a house in London, was directed by Jeff T. Thomas and premiered on MTV2 on 26 February. The band&#x27;s US label Kinetic Records was dissolved on 26 March; the band&#x27;s manager was in talks in an attempt to release the album in that territory later in the year. On 3 May, &quot;Orpheus&quot; was released as a single; the CD version includes &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Happy Nowadays&quot; (with Chris Martin of Coldplay) and &quot;Tinsel Town&quot;.

&quot;Meltdown&quot; was released through Infectious Records and Home Grown on 17 May 2004. The album&#x27;s cover shows a tattoo-styled phoenix rising from flames. Its booklet features liner notes written by author JT LeRoy. A special-edition double CD version, the second disk containing live recordings from Ash&#x27;s UK tour earlier in the year, was released in the UK. Two versions were released in Japan; one that added &quot;Tinsel Town&quot; and &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Happy Nowadays&quot; to the main album and the other added extra live recordings to the UK special-edition live disc.

Ash promoted the UK release with a series of in-store signings. &quot;Starcrossed&quot; was released as a single on 19 July 2004; the CD version includes &quot;Cool It down&quot; and &quot;Solace&quot;. The song&#x27;s music video is a homage to &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; (1996) and was filmed in a church in Bucharest, Romania. &quot;Renegade Cavalcade&quot; was released as a single on 6 December 2004; the CD version includes &quot;We Don&#x27;t Care&quot; and the 7&quot; vinyl version includes &quot;Shockwave&quot;. The song was initially planned for released in November but was postponed because in Ash&#x27;s absence, their record label made a video for it, which the band disliked. A second video showcasing a performance of the band was made.

On 8 February 2005, Ash released an Extended Play (EP) called &quot;Commando&quot;, which includes &quot;Meltdown&quot;, &quot;Clones&quot;, &quot;Evil Eye&quot;, and &quot;Tinstle Town&quot;. &quot;Meltdown&quot; was released in the US on 8 March through the label Record Collection to coincide with the band&#x27;s US tour. The US version includes the bonus tracks &quot;Shockwave&quot;, &quot;Solace&quot;, and &quot;Cool It Down&quot;, as well as a DVD of music videos. The title-track &quot;Meltdown&quot; was released to American radio stations on 24 May.

&quot;Orpheus&quot;, &quot;Clones&quot;, and &quot;Starcrossed&quot; were included on Ash&#x27;s second compilation album &quot;The Best of Ash&quot; (2011). &quot;Orpheus&quot; and &quot;Clones&quot; were released on 7&quot; vinyl as part of &quot;&#x27;94–&#x27;04 The 7&quot; Singles Box Set&quot; (2019). &quot;Orpheus&quot;, &quot;Clones&quot;, and &quot;Starcrossed&quot; were also included on the band&#x27;s third compilation album &quot;Teenage Wildlife: 25 Years of Ash&quot; (2020). &quot;Meltdown&quot; was reissued on CD through BMG in 2018.

==Touring==
In February and March 2004, Ash embarked on a tour of Europe and then a club tour of the UK. The following month, the band appeared at the Skate and Surf Festival, and headlined BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Big Weekend. On 2 May, the band headlined one of the stages at the Coachella Festival. In May and June, Ash went on another UK tour with support from Saves the Day and The Crimea. In August, the band appeared at the Reading and Leeds Festivals, and in October and November, they again toured Europe. Ash supported the Darkness&#x27; arena tour in December.

At the start of 2005, Ash toured Japan, and in March and April that year, they embarked on a headlining US tour with support from the Bravery. While touring the US in June, the band were travelling to San Francisco when their bus caught fire; while they waited on the roadside for a new bus, the band received a call telling them the replacement bus had also caught fire. Ash drove themselves to a show in a van and borrowed equipment from The Bravery. In July, the band supported U2 for three shows in Europe.
==Reception==

&quot;Meltdown&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, the album received an average score of 78 based on 16 reviews.

AllMusic reviewer Jason Damas wrote &quot;Meltdown&quot; is &quot;burst[ing] with the hooks and little musical flourishes that have made the more mature Ash records such a treat&quot; with minimal &quot;meandering malaise&quot; that plagues the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Nu-Clear Sounds&quot; (1998). He added it is a &quot;surprisingly strong and assured record&quot; that would enhance the band&#x27;s legacy. Yahoo! Launch writer Emma Morgan said the album &quot;sounds exactly like what it is – a post-pubescent take&quot; on the band&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;1977&quot; (1996). She also called the album a &quot;sturdy, well-written and ... mature addition to Ash&#x27;s enduring and near-essential canon&quot;. JR of &quot;IGN&quot; said &quot;Meltdown&quot; is &quot;every bit as good as you&#x27;d hoped it would be&quot;, providing &quot;on enough levels to accept the invitation into your stereo ... and your brain&quot;. &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; founder Sean Adams called it a &quot;combo of Ash of all ages ... This is the kinda rock record us malnourished Brits can be proud of. It&#x27;s Ash being Ash&quot;. Andrew Unterberger of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; said the album&#x27;s metal influence delivers &quot;enough to give the album a bit of personality and distinctiveness without totally overpowering the band&#x27;s signature sound&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment.ie&quot; reviewer Andrew Lynch wrote &quot;Meltdown&quot; is &quot;by far the heaviest-sounding album they&#x27;ve made to date, sometimes a bit too heavy for Tim Wheeler&#x27;s slightly weedy voice&quot;. He added, &quot;for all the bulldozer riffs and ferocious guitar solos on display here, the superb melodies prove that they&#x27;re still just a great pop band at heart&quot;. Mikael Wood of &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot; said the band &quot;punch up the guitars and drums until they threaten to drown out Wheeler’s voice altogether, and the thick, chewy distortion is a return to the days of Nirvana and Smashing Pumpkins&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; contributor Jason Crock noted while the album &quot;rock[s] harder, and with more snarl&quot; than the band&#x27;s past works, they &quot;still can&#x27;t help but reveal their melodic sweet tooth&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot;″ Adrien Begrand said the album is &quot;slightly more consistent&quot; than the band&#x27;s previous one, highlighting Hatherley&#x27;s talents as a guitarist and her vocals. &quot;The Guardian&quot; writer Steve Pill said the album is &quot;a festival set list in waiting ... this may be the first rock album of the year you can sing in the shower and make a better hash of&quot;. Kaj Roth of &quot;Melodic&quot; wrote the band &quot;cranked up the volume to 11 and then just rocked&quot;, and called it one of the better albums of the year as well as &quot;one of the most fun to listen to&quot;.

&quot;Meltdown&quot; entered the charts at number five in the UK, number five in Scotland, and number six in Ireland. It reached number 25 in Norway, number 65 in Germany, number 78 in Austria, and number 87 in Australia. The album was later certified gold in the UK, and ranked at number 173 on the UK year-end chart. &quot;Clones&quot; charted at number 12 in Ireland; &quot;Orpheus&quot; charted at number 13 in the UK, and number 17 in Ireland; and &quot;Starcrossed&quot; charted at number 19 in Ireland and number 22 in the UK. &quot;Renegade Cavalcade&quot; charted at number 22 in Ireland and number 33 in the UK.

<doc id="777147" wikidata="Q129316" url="?curid=777147" title="Solar inverter">
<text>A solar inverter or photovoltaic (PV) inverter is a type of power inverter which converts the variable direct current (DC) output of a photovoltaic solar panel into a utility frequency alternating current (AC) that can be fed into a commercial electrical grid or used by a local, off-grid electrical network. It is a critical balance of system (BOS)–component in a photovoltaic system, allowing the use of ordinary AC-powered equipment. Solar power inverters have special functions adapted for use with photovoltaic arrays, including maximum power point tracking and anti-islanding protection.

== Classification ==
Solar inverters may be classified into four broad types:
# Stand-alone inverters, used in stand-alone power systems where the inverter draws its DC energy from batteries charged by photovoltaic arrays. Many stand-alone inverters also incorporate integral battery chargers to replenish the battery from an AC source when available. Normally these do not interface in any way with the utility grid, and as such are not required to have anti-islanding protection.
# Grid-tie inverters, which match phase with a utility-supplied sine wave. Grid-tie inverters are designed to shut down automatically upon loss of utility supply, for safety reasons. They do not provide backup power during utility outages.
# Battery backup inverters are special inverters which are designed to draw energy from a battery, manage the battery charge via an onboard charger, and export excess energy to the utility grid. These inverters are capable of supplying AC energy to selected loads during a utility outage, and are required to have anti-islanding protection.
# Intelligent hybrid inverters manage photovoltaic array, battery storage and utility grid, which are all coupled directly to the unit. These modern all-in-one systems are usually highly versatile and can be used for grid-tie, stand-alone or backup applications but their primary function is self-consumption with the use of storage.

== Maximum power point tracking ==

Solar inverters use &quot;maximum power point tracking&quot; (MPPT) to get the maximum possible power from the PV array. Solar cells have a complex relationship between solar irradiation, temperature and total resistance that produces a non-linear output efficiency known as the &quot;I-V curve&quot;. It is the purpose of the MPPT system to sample the output of the cells and determine a resistance (load) to obtain maximum power for any given environmental conditions.

The fill factor, more commonly known by its abbreviation &quot;FF&quot;, is a parameter which, in conjunction with the open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current (Isc) of the panel, determines the maximum power from a solar cell. Fill factor is defined as the ratio of the maximum power from the solar cell to the product of Voc and Isc.

There are three main types of MPPT algorithms: perturb-and-observe, incremental conductance and constant voltage. The first two methods are often referred to as &quot;hill climbing&quot; methods; they rely on the curve of power plotted against voltage rising to the left of the maximum power point, and falling on the right.

== Grid tied solar inverters ==
The key role of the grid-interactive or synchronous inverters or simply the grid-tie inverter (GTI) is to synchronize the phase, voltage, and frequency of the power line with
that of the grid. Solar grid-tie inverters are designed to quickly disconnect from the grid if the utility grid goes down. This is an NEC requirement that ensures that in the event of a blackout, the grid tie inverter will shut down to prevent the energy it produces from harming any line workers who are sent to fix the power grid.

Grid-tie inverters that are available on the market today use a number of different technologies. The inverters may use the newer high-frequency transformers, conventional low-frequency transformers, or no transformer. Instead of converting direct current directly to 120 or 240 volts AC, high-frequency transformers employ a computerized multi-step process that involves converting the power to high-frequency AC and then back to DC and then to the final AC output voltage.

Historically, there have been concerns about having transformerless electrical systems feed into the public utility grid. The concerns stem from the fact that there is a lack of galvanic isolation between the DC and AC circuits, which could allow the passage of dangerous DC faults to the AC side. Since 2005, the NFPA&#x27;s NEC allows transformer-less (or non-galvanically isolated) inverters. The VDE 0126-1-1 and IEC 6210 also have been amended to allow and define the safety mechanisms needed for such systems. Primarily, residual or ground current detection is used to detect possible fault conditions. Also isolation tests are performed to ensure DC to AC separation.

Many solar inverters are designed to be connected to a utility grid, and will not operate when they do not detect the presence of the grid. They contain special circuitry to precisely match the voltage, frequency and phase of the grid. When a grid is not detected, grid-tie inverters will not produce power to avoid islanding which can cause safety issues.

== Solar pumping inverters ==
Advanced solar pumping inverters convert DC voltage from the solar array into AC voltage to drive submersible pumps directly without the need for batteries or other energy storage devices. By utilizing MPPT (maximum power point tracking), solar pumping inverters regulate output frequency to control the speed of the pumps in order to save the pump motor from damage.

Solar pumping inverters usually have multiple ports to allow the input of DC current generated by PV arrays, one port to allow the output of AC voltage, and a further port for input from a water-level sensor.

==Three-phase-inverter==

A three-phase-inverter is a type of solar microinverter specifically design to supply three-phase electric power. In conventional microinverter designs that work with one-phase power, the energy from the panel must be stored during the period where the voltage is passing through zero, which it does twice per cycle (at 50 or 60 Hz). In a three phase system, throughout the cycle, one of the three wires has a positive (or negative) voltage, so the need for storage can be greatly reduced by transferring the output of the panel to different wires during each cycle. The reduction in energy storage significantly lowers the price and complexity of the converter hardware, as well as potentially increasing its expected lifetime.

===Concept===

====Background====
Conventional alternating current power is a sinusoidal voltage pattern that repeats over a defined period. That means that during a single cycle, the voltage passes through zero two times. In European systems the voltage at the plug has a maximum of 230 V and cycles 50 times a second, meaning that there are 100 times a second where the voltage is zero, while North American derived systems are 120 V 60 Hz, or 120 zero voltages a second.

Inexpensive inverters can convert DC power to AC by simply turning the DC side of the power on and off 120 times a second, inverting the voltage every other cycle. The result is a square-wave that is close enough to AC power for many devices. However, this sort of solution is not useful in the solar power case, where the goal is to convert as much of the power from the solar power into AC as possible. If one uses these inexpensive types of inverters, all of the power generated during the time that the DC side is turned off is simply lost, and this represents a significant amount of each cycle.

To address this, solar inverters use some form of energy storage to buffer the panel&#x27;s power during those zero-crossing periods. When the voltage of the AC goes above the voltage in the storage, it is dumped into the output along with any energy being developed by the panel at that instant. In this way, the energy produced by the panel through the entire cycle is eventually sent into the output.

The problem with this approach is that the amount of energy storage needed when connected to a typical modern solar panel can only economically be provided through the use of electrolytic capacitors. These are relatively inexpensive but have well-known degradation modes that mean they have lifetime expectancy on the order of a decade. This has led to a great debate in the industry over whether or not microinverters are a good idea, because when these capacitors start to fail at the end of their expected life, replacing them will require the panels to be removed, often on the roof.

====Three-phase====
In comparison to normal household current on two wires, current on the delivery side of the power grid uses three wires and phases. At any given instant, the sum of those three is always positive (or negative). So while any given wire in a three-phase system undergoes zero-crossing events in exactly the same fashion as household current, the system as a whole does not, it simply fluctuates between the maximum and a slightly lower value.

A microinverter designed specifically for three-phase supply can eliminate much of the required storage by simply selecting which wire is closest to its own operating voltage at any given instant. A simple system could simply select the wire that is closest to the maximum voltage, switching to the next line when that begins to approach the maximum. In this case, the system only has to store the amount of energy from the peak to the minimum of the cycle as a whole, which is much smaller both in voltage difference and time.

This can be improved further by selecting the wire that is closest to its own DC voltage at any given instant, instead of switching from one to the other purely on a timer. At any given instant two of the three wires will have a positive (or negative) voltage and using the one closer to the DC side will take advantage of slight efficiency improvements in the conversion hardware.

The reduction, or outright elimination, of energy storage requirements, simplifies the device and eliminates the one component that is expected to define its lifetime. Instead of a decade, a three-phase microinverter could be built to last for the lifetime of the panel. Such a device would also be less expensive and less complex, although at the cost of requiring each inverter to connect to all three lines, which possibly leads to more wiring.

====Disadvantages====
The primary disadvantage of the three-phase inverter concept is that only sites with three-phase power can take advantage of these systems. Three-phase is easily available at utility-scale and commercial sites, and it was to these markets that the systems were aimed. However, the main advantages of the microinverter concept involve issues of shading and panel orientation, and in the case of large systems, these are easily addressed by simply moving the panels around. The benefits of the three-phase micro are very limited compared to the residential case with limited space to work in.

As of 2014, observers believed that three-phase micros had not yet managed to reach the price point where their advantages appeared worthwhile. Moreover, the wiring costs for three-phase microinverters is expected to be higher.

====Combining phases====
It is important to contrast a native three-phase inverter with three single-phase micro-inverters wired to output in three-phase. The latter is a relatively common feature of most inverter designs, allowing you to connect three identical inverters together, each across a pair of wires in a three-phase circuit. The result is three-phase power, but each inverter in the system is outputting a single phase. These sorts of solutions do not take advantage of the reduced energy storage needs outlined above.

== Solar micro-inverters ==
Solar micro-inverter is an inverter designed to operate with a single PV module. The micro-inverter converts the direct current output from each panel into alternating current. Its design allows parallel connection of multiple, independent units in a modular way.

Micro-inverter advantages include single panel power optimization, independent operation of each panel, plug-and play installation, improved installation and fire safety, minimized costs with system design and stock minimization.

A 2011 study at Appalachian State University reports that individual integrated inverter setup yielded about 20% more power in unshaded conditions and 27% more power in shaded conditions compared to string connected setup using one inverter. Both setups used identical solar panels.


A solar micro-inverter, or simply microinverter, is a plug-and-play device used in photovoltaics that converts direct current (DC) generated by a single solar module to alternating current (AC). Microinverters contrast with conventional string and central solar inverters, in which a single inverter is connected to multiple solar panels. The output from several microinverters can be combined and often fed to the electrical grid.

Microinverters have several advantages over conventional inverters. The main advantage is that they electrically isolate the panels from one another, so small amounts of shading, debris or snow lines on any one solar module, or even a complete module failure, do not disproportionately reduce the output of the entire array. Each microinverter harvests optimum power by performing maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for its connected module. Simplicity in system design, lower amperage wires, simplified stock management, and added safety are other factors introduced with the microinverter solution.

The primary disadvantages of a microinverter include a higher initial equipment cost per peak watt than the equivalent power of a central inverter since each inverter needs to be installed adjacent to a panel (usually on a roof). This also makes them harder to maintain and more costly to remove and replace. Some manufacturers have addressed these issues with panels with built-in microinverters. A microinverter has often a longer lifespan than a central inverter, which will need replacement during the lifespan of the solar panels. Therefore, the financial disadvantage at first may become an advantage in the long term.

A power optimizer is a type of technology similar to a microinverter and also does a power optimizer uses a panel-level maximum power point tracking, but does not convert to AC per module.

=== Description ===

==== String inverter ====

Solar panels produce direct current at a voltage that depends on module design and lighting conditions. Modern modules using 6-inch cells typically contain 60 cells and produce a nominal 24-30 V. (so inverters are ready for 24-50 V).

For conversion into AC, panels may be connected in series to produce an array that is effectively a single large panel with a nominal rating of 300 to 600 VDC. The power then runs to an inverter, which converts it into standard AC voltage, typically 230 VAC / 50 Hz or 240 VAC / 60 Hz.

The main problem with the string inverter approach is the string of panels acts as if it were a single larger panel with a max current rating equivalent to the poorest performer in the string. For example, if one panel in a string has 5% higher resistance due to a minor manufacturing defect, the entire string suffers a 5% performance loss. This situation is dynamic. If a panel is shaded its output drops dramatically, affecting the output of the string, even if the other panels are not shaded. Even slight changes in orientation can cause output loss in this fashion. In the industry, this is known as the &quot;Christmas-lights effect&quot;, referring to the way an entire string of series-strung Christmas tree lights will fail if a single bulb fails. However, this effect is not entirely accurate and ignores the complex interaction between modern string inverter maximum power point tracking and even module bypass diodes. Shade studies by major microinverter and DC optimizer companies show small yearly gains in light, medium and heavy shaded conditions – 2%, 5% and 8% respectively – over an older string inverter

Additionally, the efficiency of a panel&#x27;s output is strongly affected by the load the inverter places on it. To maximize production, inverters use a technique called maximum power point tracking to ensure optimal energy harvest by adjusting the applied load. However, the same issues that cause output to vary from panel to panel, affect the proper load that the MPPT system should apply. If a single panel operates at a different point, a string inverter can only see the overall change, and moves the MPPT point to match. This results in not just losses from the shadowed panel, but the other panels too. Shading of as little as 9% of the surface of an array can, in some circumstances, reduce system-wide power as much as 54%. However, as stated above, these yearly yield losses are relatively small and newer technologies allow some string inverters to significantly reduce the effects of partial shading.

Another issue, though minor, is that string inverters are available in a limited selection of power ratings. This means that a given array normally up-sizes the inverter to the next-largest model over the rating of the panel array. For instance, a 10-panel array of 2300 W might have to use a 2500 or even 3000 W inverter, paying for conversion capability it cannot use. This same issue makes it difficult to change array size over time, adding power when funds are available (modularity). If the customer originally purchased a 2500 W inverter for their 2300 W of panels, they cannot add even a single panel without over-driving the inverter. However, this over sizing is considered common practice in today&#x27;s industry (sometimes as high as 20% over inverter nameplate rating) to account for module degradation, higher performance during winter months or to achieve higher sell back to the utility.

Other challenges associated with centralized inverters include the space required to locate the device, as well as heat dissipation requirements. Large central inverters are typically actively cooled. Cooling fans make noise, so location of the inverter relative to offices and occupied areas must be considered. And because cooling fans have moving parts, dirt, dust, and moisture can negatively affect their performance over time. String inverters are quieter but might produce a humming noise in late afternoon when inverter power is low.

==== Microinverter ====
Microinverters are small inverters rated to handle the output of a single panel or a pair of panels. Grid-tie panels are normally rated between 225 and 275 W, but rarely produce this in practice, so microinverters are typically rated between 190 and 220 W (sometimes, 100 W). Because it is operated at this lower power point, many design issues inherent to larger designs simply go away; the need for a large transformer is generally eliminated, large electrolytic capacitors can be replaced by more reliable thin-film ones, and cooling loads are reduced so no fans are needed. Mean time between failures (MTBF) are quoted in hundreds of years.

A microinverter attached to a single panel allows it to isolate and tune the output of that panel. Any panel that is under-performing has no effect on panels around it. In that case, the array as a whole produces as much as 5% more power than it would with a string inverter. When shadowing is factored in, if present, these gains can become considerable, with manufacturers generally claiming 5% better output at a minimum, and up to 25% better in some cases. Furthermore, a single model can be used with a wide variety of panels, new panels can be added to an array at any time, and do not have to have the same rating as existing panels.

Microinverters produce grid-matching AC power directly at the back of each solar panel. Arrays of panels are connected in parallel to each other, and then to the grid. This has the major advantage that a single failing panel or inverter cannot take the entire string offline. Combined with the lower power and heat loads, and improved MTBF, some suggest that overall array reliability of a microinverter-based system is significantly greater than a string inverter-based one. This assertion is supported by longer warranties, typically 15 to 25 years, compared with 5 or 10-year warranties that are more typical for string inverters. Additionally, when faults occur, they are identifiable to a single point, as opposed to an entire string. This not only makes fault isolation easier, but unmasks minor problems that might not otherwise become visible – a single under-performing panel may not affect a long string&#x27;s output enough to be noticed.

====Disadvantages====
The main disadvantage of the microinverter concept has, until recently, been cost. Because each microinverter has to duplicate much of the complexity of a string inverter but spread that out over a smaller power rating, costs on a per-watt basis are greater. This offsets any advantage in terms of simplification of individual components. As of February 2018, a central inverter costs approximately $0.13 per watt, whereas a microinverter costs approximately $0.34 per watt. Like string inverters, economic considerations force manufacturers to limit the number of models they produce. Most produce a single model that may be over or undersize when matched with a specific panel.

In many cases the packaging can have a significant effect on price. With a central inverter you may have only one set of panel connections for dozens of panels, a single AC output, and one box. Microinverter installations larger than about 15 panels may require a roof mounted &quot;combiner&quot; breaker box as well. This can add to the overall price-per-watt.

To further reduce costs, some models control two or three panels from an inverter, reducing the packaging and associated costs. Some systems place two entire micros in a single box, while others duplicate only the MPPT section of the system and use a single DC-to-AC stage for further cost reductions. Some have suggested that this approach will make microinverters comparable in cost with those using string inverters. With steadily decreasing prices, the introduction of dual microinverters and the advent of wider model selections to match PV module output more closely, cost is less of an obstacle.

Microinverters have become common where array sizes are small and maximizing performance from every panel is a concern. In these cases, the differential in price-per-watt is minimized due to the small number of panels, and has little effect on overall system cost. The improvement in energy harvest given a fixed size array can offset this difference in cost. For this reason, microinverters have been most successful in the residential market, where limited space for panels constrains array size, and shading from nearby trees or other objects is often an issue. Microinverter manufacturers list many installations, some as small as a single panel and the majority under 50.

An often overlooked disadvantage of micro inverters is the future operation and maintenance costs associated with them. While the technology has improved over the years the fact remains that the devices will eventually either fail or wear out. The installer must balance these replacement costs (around $400 per truck roll), increased safety risks to personnel, equipment and module racking against the profit margins for the installation. For homeowners, the eventual wear out or premature device failures will introduce potential damage to the roof tiles or shingles, property damage and other nuisances.

==== Advantages ====
While microinverters generally have a lower efficiency than string inverters, the overall efficiency is increased due to the fact that every inverter / panel unit acts independently. In a string configuration, when a panel on a string is shaded, the output of the entire string of panels is reduced to the output of the lowest producing panel. This is not the case with micro inverters.

A further advantage is found in the panel output quality. The rated output of any two panels in the same production run can vary by as much as 10% or more. This is mitigated with a microinverter configuration but not so in a string configuration. The result is maximum power harvesting from a microinverter array.

Systems with microinverters also can be changed easier, when power demands grow, or decrease over time. As every solarpanel and microinverter is a small system of its own, it acts to a certain extent independent. This means that adding one or more panels will just provide more energy, as long as the fused electricity group in a house or building is not exceeding its limits. In contrary, with string based inverters, the inverter size need to be in accordance with the amount of panels or the amount of peak power. Choosing an oversized string-inverter is possible, when future extension is foreseen, but such a provision for an uncertain future increases the costs in any case.

Monitoring and maintenance is also easier as many microinverter producers provide apps or websites to monitor the power output of their units. In many cases, these are proprietary; however this is not always the case. Following the demise of Enecsys, and the subsequent closure of their site; a number of private sites such as Enecsys-Monitoring sprung up to enable owners to continue to monitor their systems.

====Three-phase microinverters====
Efficient conversion of DC power to AC requires the inverter to store energy from the panel while the grid&#x27;s AC voltage is near zero, and then release it again when it rises. This requires considerable amounts of energy storage in a small package. The lowest-cost option for the required amount of storage is the electrolytic capacitor, but these have relatively short lifetimes normally measured in years, and those lifetimes are shorter when operated hot, like on a rooftop solar panel. This has led to considerable development effort on the part of microinverter developers, who have introduced a variety of conversion topologies with lowered storage requirements, some using the much less capable but far longer lived thin film capacitors where possible.

Three-phase electric power represents another solution to the problem. In a three-phase circuit, the power does not vary between (say) +120 to -120 V between two lines, but instead varies between 60 and +120 or -60 and -120 V, and the periods of variation are much shorter. Inverters designed to operate on three phase systems require much less storage. A three-phase micro using zero-voltage switching can also offer higher circuit density and lower cost components, while improving conversion efficiency to over 98%, better than the typical one-phase peak around 96%.

Three-phase systems, however, are generally only seen in industrial and commercial settings. These markets normally install larger arrays, where price sensitivity is the highest. Uptake of three-phase micros, in spite of any theoretical advantages, appears to be very low.

===Portable uses===
Foldable solar panel with AC microinverters can be used to recharge laptops and some electric vehicles.

=== History ===

The microinverter concept has been in the solar industry since its inception. However, flat costs in manufacturing, like the cost of the transformer or enclosure, scaled favorably with size, and meant that larger devices were inherently less expensive in terms of price per watt. Small inverters were available from companies like ExelTech and others, but these were simply small versions of larger designs with poor price performance, and were aimed at niche markets.

==== Early examples ====

In 1991 the US company Ascension Technology started work on what was essentially a shrunken version of a traditional inverter, intended to be mounted on a panel to form an &quot;AC panel&quot;. This design was based on the conventional linear regulator, which is not particularly efficient and dissipates considerable heat. In 1994 they sent an example to Sandia Labs for testing. In 1997, Ascension partnered with US panel company ASE Americas to introduce the 300 W SunSine panel.

Design of, what would today be recognized as a &quot;true&quot; microinverter, traces its history to late 1980s work by Werner Kleinkauf at the ISET (&quot;Institut für Solare Energieversorgungstechnik&quot;), now Fraunhofer Institute for Wind Energy and Energy System Technology. These designs were based on modern high-frequency switching power supply technology, which is much more efficient. His work on &quot;module integrated converters&quot; was highly influential, especially in Europe.

In 1993 Mastervolt introduced their first grid-tie inverter, the Sunmaster 130S, based on a collaborative effort between Shell Solar, Ecofys and ECN. The 130 was designed to mount directly to the back of the panel, connecting both AC and DC lines with compression fittings. In 2000, the 130 was replaced by the Soladin 120, a microinverter in the form of an AC adapter that allows panels to be connected simply by plugging them into any wall socket.

In 1995, OKE-Services designed a new high-frequency version with improved efficiency, which was introduced commercially as the OK4-100 in 1995 by NKF Kabel, and re-branded for US sales as the Trace Microsine. A new version, the OK4All, improved efficiency and had wider operating ranges.

In spite of this promising start, by 2003 most of these projects had ended. Ascension Technology was purchased by Applied Power Corporation, a large integrator. APC was in turn purchased by Schott in 2002, and SunSine production was canceled in favor of Schott&#x27;s existing designs. NKF ended production of the OK4 series in 2003 when a subsidy program ended. Mastervolt has moved on to a line of &quot;mini-inverters&quot; combining the ease-of-use of the 120 in a system designed to support up to 600 W of panels.

==== Enphase ====

In the aftermath of the 2001 Telecoms crash, Martin Fornage of Cerent Corporation was looking for new projects. When he saw the low performance of the string inverter for the solar array on his ranch, he found the project he was looking for. In 2006 he formed Enphase Energy with another Cerent engineer, Raghu Belur, and they spent the next year applying their telecommunications design expertise to the inverter problem.

Released in 2008, the Enphase M175 model was the first commercially successful microinverter. A successor, the M190, was introduced in 2009, and the latest model, the M215, in 2011. Backed by $100 million in private equity, Enphase quickly grew to 13% marketshare by mid-2010, aiming for 20% by year-end. They shipped their 500,000th inverter in early 2011, and their 1,000,000th in September of the same year. In early 2011, they announced that re-branded versions of the new design will be sold by Siemens directly to electrical contractors for widespread distribution.

Enphase has subscribed an agreement with EnergyAustralia, to market its micro-inverter technology.

=== Major players ===

Enphase&#x27;s success did not go unnoticed, and since 2010 a host of competitors came and largely left the space. Many of the products were identical to the M190 in specs, and even in the casing and mounting details. Some differentiate by competing head-to-head with Enphase in terms of price or performance, while others are attacking niche markets.

Larger firms also stepped into the field: SMA, Enecsys and iEnergy.

OKE-Services updated OK4-All product was bought by SMA in 2009 and released as the SunnyBoy 240 after an extended gestation period, while Power-One has introduced the AURORA 250 and 300. Other major players around 2010 included Enecsys and SolarBridge Technologies, especially outside the North American market. In 2021, the only microinverter made in the USA is from Chilicon Power. Since 2009, several companies from Europe to China, including major central inverter manufacturers, have launched microinverters—validating the microinverter as an established technology and one of the biggest technology shifts in the PV industry in recent years.

APsystems is marketing inverters for up to four solar modules a microinverters, including the three-phase YC1000 with an AC output of up to 1130 Watt.

The number of manufacturers has dwindled over the years, both by attrition and consolidation. In 2019, the few remaining include Enphase which purchased SolarBridge in 2021, Omnik Solar and Chilicon Power (acquired by Generac in July 2021).

In July 2021 the list of major PV companies who have partnered with microinverter companies to produce and sell AC solar panels include BenQ, Canadian Solar, LG, NESL, SunPower, Sharp Solar, Suntech, Siemens, Trina Solar and Qcells.

== Market ==
As of 2019, conversion efficiency for state-of-the-art solar converters reached more than 98 percent. While string inverters are used in residential to medium-sized commercial PV systems, central inverters cover the large commercial and utility-scale market. Market-share for central and string inverters are about 36 percent and 61 percent, respectively, leaving less than 2 percent to micro-inverters.

=== Price declines ===
The period between 2009 and 2012 included unprecedented downward price movement in the PV market. At the beginning of this period, wholesale pricing for panels was generally around $2.00 to $2.50/W, and inverters around 50 to 65 cents/W. By the end of 2012, panels were widely available in wholesale at 65 to 70 cents, and string inverters around 30 to 35 cents/W. In comparison, microinverters have proven relatively immune to these same sorts of price declines, moving from about 65 cents/W to 50 to 55 once cabling is factored in. This could lead to widening losses as the suppliers attempt to remain competitive.

<text>Pearl Mae Bailey (March 29, 1918 – August 17, 1990) was an American actress, singer, comedian and author. After appearing in vaudeville, she made her Broadway debut in &quot;St. Louis Woman&quot; in 1946. She received a Special Tony Award for the title role in the all-black production of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; in 1968. In 1986, she won a Daytime Emmy award for her performance as a fairy godmother in the ABC Afterschool Special &quot;Cindy Eller: A Modern Fairy Tale&quot;. Her rendition of &quot;Takes Two to Tango&quot; hit the top ten in 1952.

In 1976, she became the first African-American to receive the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award. She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom on October 17, 1988.

== Early life ==

Bailey was born in Newport News, Virginia to the Reverend Joseph James and Ella Mae Ricks Bailey. When she was very young, the family moved to Washington, DC. After her parents&#x27; divorce, Bailey moved to Philadelphia to live with her mother.

Bailey made her stage-singing debut at the age of 15. Her brother Bill Bailey was beginning his own career as a tap dancer and suggested that she enter an amateur contest at the Pearl Theatre in Philadelphia. Bailey won and was offered $35 a week to perform there for two weeks. However, the theater closed during her engagement and she was not paid. She later won a similar competition at Harlem&#x27;s famous Apollo Theater and decided to pursue a career in entertainment. She was also known to have performed in the church choir at St Peter Claver Catholic Church in Brooklyn, at the behest of Msgr Bernard J. Quinn.

==Career==

Bailey began by singing and dancing in Philadelphia&#x27;s black nightclubs in the 1930s, and soon started performing in other parts of the East Coast. In 1941, during World War II, Bailey toured the country with the USO, performing for American troops. After the tour, she settled in New York. Her solo successes as a nightclub performer were followed by acts with entertainers such as Cab Calloway and Duke Ellington. In 1946, Bailey made her Broadway debut in &quot;St. Louis Woman&quot;. For her performance, she won a Donaldson Award as the best Broadway newcomer. Bailey continued to tour and record albums along with her stage and screen performances. Early in the television medium, Bailey guest starred on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Faye Emerson&#x27;s Wonderful Town&quot;.
Female impersonator Lynne Carter credited Bailey with launching his career.

In 1967, Bailey and Cab Calloway headlined an all-black cast version of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; The touring version was so successful that producer David Merrick took it to Broadway, where it played to sold-out houses and revitalized the long-running musical. Bailey was given a special Tony Award for her role, and RCA Victor released a second original-cast album, the only recording of the score to have an overture written especially for the recording.
A passionate fan of the New York Mets, Bailey sang the national anthem at Shea Stadium prior to Game 5 of the 1969 World Series, and appears in the World Series highlight film showing her support for the team. She also sang the national anthem prior to Game 1 of the 1981 World Series between the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers at Yankee Stadium.

Bailey hosted her own variety series on ABC, &quot;The Pearl Bailey Show&quot; (January – May 1971), which featured many notable guests, including Lucille Ball, Bing Crosby and Louis Armstrong (one of his last appearances before his death).

Following her 1971 television series, she provided voices for animations such as &quot;Tubby the Tuba&quot; (1976) and Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot; (1981). She returned to Broadway in 1975, playing the lead in an all-black production of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;. In October 1975, she was invited by Betty Ford to sing for Egyptian president Anwar Sadat at a White House state dinner as part of Mideast peace initiative.

She earned a degree in theology from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., in 1985 at age 67. It took her seven years to earn her degree. At Georgetown, she was a student of the philosopher Wilfrid Desan.

Later in her career, Bailey was a fixture as a spokesperson in a series of Duncan Hines commercials, singing &quot;Bill Bailey (Won&#x27;t You Come Home).&quot; She also appeared in commercials for Jell-O, Westinghouse and Paramount Chicken.

In her later years, Bailey wrote several books: &quot;The Raw Pearl&quot; (1968), &quot;Talking to Myself&quot; (1971), &quot;Pearl&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; (1973) and &quot;Hurry Up America and Spit&quot; (1976). In 1975, she was appointed special ambassador to the United Nations by President Gerald Ford, a position she held under three presidents. In 1976, she won the Coretta Scott King Award for her children&#x27;s book &quot;Duey&#x27;s Tale&quot;. Her last book, &quot;Between You and Me&quot; (1989), details her experiences with higher education. On January 19, 1985, she appeared on a nationally televised broadcast gala the night before the second inauguration of Ronald Reagan. In 1988, Bailey received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Reagan.

==Personal life==
Bailey went through a number of failed marriages in her earlier adult years. She married John Randolph Pinkett, either her third or fourth husband, when she was 30 years old, and divorced him four years later, accusing him of physical abuse.

On November 19, 1952, Bailey married jazz drummer Louie Bellson in London. They remained married until her death nearly 38 years later in 1990. Bellson was six years Bailey&#x27;s junior and white. Interracial couples were rare at that time, and Bellson&#x27;s father was reportedly opposed to the marriage because of Bailey&#x27;s race.

They later adopted a son, Tony, in the mid-1950s. A daughter, Dee Dee Jean Bellson, was born April 20, 1960. Tony Bellson died in 2004. Dee Dee Bellson died on July 4, 2009, at the age of 49, five months after her father, who died on February 14.

Bailey, a Republican, was appointed by President Richard Nixon as the nation&#x27;s &quot;Ambassador of Love&quot; in 1970. She attended several meetings of the United Nations and later appeared in a campaign ad for President Gerald Ford in the 1976 election.

She was awarded the Bronze Medallion in 1968, the highest award conferred upon civilians by New York City.

Bailey was a close friend of actress Joan Crawford. In 1969, Crawford and Bailey joined fellow friend Gypsy Rose Lee in accepting a USO award. That same year, Bailey was recognized as USO&#x27;s woman of the year. Upon Crawford&#x27;s death in May 1977, Bailey spoke of Crawford as her sister and sang a hymn at her funeral. American socialite Perle Mesta was another of Bailey&#x27;s close friends. In the waning days of Mesta&#x27;s life, Bailey visited Mesta frequently and sang hymns for her.

==Death==
Bailey died at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia on August 17, 1990. An autopsy confirmed the death was caused by the narrowing of a coronary artery. Bailey had suffered from heart problems for over thirty years.

Bailey is buried at Rolling Green Memorial Park in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

==Remembrances==
The television show &quot;American Dad!&quot; features Pearl Bailey High School

The 1969 song &quot;We Got More Soul&quot; by Dyke and the Blazers includes Bailey in its roster of icons.

A dress owned by Bailey is at the National Museum of African American History and Culture.

A library in her hometown of Newport News, Virginia is named after her.

<doc id="777174" wikidata="Q1196009" url="?curid=777174" title="Big science">
<text>Big science is a term used by scientists and historians of science to describe a series of changes in science which occurred in industrial nations during and after World War II, as scientific progress increasingly came to rely on large-scale projects usually funded by national governments or groups of governments. Individual or small group efforts, or small science, are still relevant today as theoretical results by individual authors may have a significant impact, but very often the empirical verification requires experiments using constructions, such as the Large Hadron Collider, costing between $5 and $10 billion.

== Development ==

While science and technology have always been important to and driven by warfare, the increase in military funding of science following the second World War was on a scale wholly unprecedented. James Conant, in a 1941 letter to &quot;Chemical Engineering News&quot;, said that World War II &quot;is a physicist&#x27;s war rather than a chemist&#x27;s,&quot; a phrase that was cemented in the vernacular in post-war discussion of the role that those scientists played in the development of new weapons and tools, notably the proximity fuse, radar, and the atomic bomb. The bulk of these last two activities took place in a new form of research facility: the government-sponsored laboratory, employing thousands of technicians and scientists, managed by universities (in this case, the University of California and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology).

The need of a strong scientific research establishment was obvious in the shadow of the first atomic weapons to any country seeking to play a prominent role in world affairs. After the success of the Manhattan Project, governments became the chief patron of science, and the character of the scientific establishment underwent several key changes. This was especially marked in the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, but also to a lesser extent in many other countries.

== Definitions ==
&quot;Big science&quot; usually implies one or more of these specific characteristics:
*&quot;Big budgets&quot;: No longer required to rely on philanthropy or industry, scientists were able to use budgets on an unprecedented scale for basic research.
*&quot;Big staffs&quot;: Similarly, the number of practitioners of science on any one project grew as well, creating difficulty, and often controversy, in the assignment of credit for scientific discoveries (the Nobel Prize system, for example, allows awarding only three individuals in any one topic per year, based on a 19th-century model of the scientific enterprise).
*&quot;Big machines&quot;: Ernest Lawrence&#x27;s cyclotron at his Radiation Laboratory in particular ushered in an era of massive machines (requiring massive staffs and budgets) as the tools of basic scientific research. The use of &quot;many&quot; machines, such as the many sequencers used during the Human Genome Project, might also fall under this definition.

*&quot;Big laboratories&quot;: Because of the increase in cost to do basic science (with the increase of large machines), centralization of scientific research in large laboratories (such as Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory or CERN) has become a cost-effective strategy, though questions over facility access have become prevalent.

Towards the end of the 20th century, not only projects in basic physics and astronomy, but also in life sciences became big sciences, such as the massive Human Genome Project. The heavy investment of government and industrial interests into academic science has also blurred the line between public and private research, where entire academic departments, even at public universities, are often financed by private companies. Not all Big Science is related to the military concerns which were at its origins.

== Criticism ==
The era of Big Science has provoked criticism that it undermines the basic principles of the scientific method. Increased government funding has often meant increased military funding, which some claim subverts the Enlightenment-era ideal of science as a pure quest for knowledge. For example, historian Paul Forman has argued that during World War II and the Cold War, the massive scale of defense-related funding prompted a shift in physics from basic to applied research.

Many scientists also complain that the requirement for increased funding makes a large part of the scientific activity filling out grant requests and other budgetary bureaucratic activity, and the intense connections between academic, governmental, and industrial interests have raised the question of whether scientists can be completely objective when their research contradicts the interests and intentions of their benefactors.

In addition, widespread sharing of scientific knowledge is necessary for rapid progress for both basic and applied sciences. However the sharing of data can be impeded for a number of reasons. For example, scientific findings can be classified by military interests or patented by corporate ones. Grant competitions, while they stimulate interest in a topic, can also increase secretiveness among scientists because application evaluators may value uniqueness more than incremental, collaborative inquiry.

== Historiography of Big Science ==

The popularization of the term &quot;Big Science&quot; is usually attributed to an article by Alvin M. Weinberg, then director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, published in &quot;Science&quot; in 1961. This was a response to , in which the departing U.S. president warned against the dangers of what he called the &quot;military–industrial complex&quot; and the potential &quot;domination of the nation&#x27;s scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money&quot;. Weinberg compared the large-scale enterprise of science in the 20th century to the wonders of earlier civilization (the pyramids, the palace of Versailles):
:&quot;When history looks at the 20th century, she will see science and technology as its theme; she will find in the monuments of Big Science—the huge rockets, the high-energy accelerators, the high-flux research reactors—symbols of our time just as surely as she finds in Notre Dame a symbol of the Middle Ages. ... We build our monuments in the name of scientific truth, they built theirs in the name of religious truth; we use our Big Science to add to our country&#x27;s prestige, they used their churches for their cities&#x27; prestige; we build to placate what ex-President Eisenhower suggested could become a dominant scientific caste, they built to please the priests of Isis and Osiris.&quot;
Weinberg&#x27;s article addressed criticisms of the way in which the era of Big Science could negatively affect science — such as astronomer Fred Hoyle&#x27;s contention that excessive money for science would only make science fat and lazy — and encouraged, in the end, limiting Big Science only to the national laboratory system and preventing its incursion into the university system.

Since Weinberg&#x27;s article there have been many historical and sociological studies on the effects of Big Science both in and out of the laboratory. Soon after that article, Derek J. de Solla Price gave a series of lectures that were published in 1963 as &quot;Little Science, Big Science&quot;. The book describes the historical and sociological transition from &quot;small science&quot; to &quot;big science&quot; and the qualitative differences between the two; it inspired the field of scientometrics as well as new perspectives on large-scale science in other fields.

The Harvard historian Peter Galison has written several books addressing the formation of big science. Major themes include the evolution of experimental design, from table-top experiments to today&#x27;s large-scale collider projects; accompanying changes in standards of evidence; and discourse patterns across researchers whose expertise only partially overlaps. Galison introduced the notion of &quot;trading zones,&quot; borrowed from the sociolinguistic study of pidgins, to characterize how such groups learn to interact.

Other historians have postulated many &quot;precursors&quot; to Big Science in earlier times: the Uraniborg of Tycho Brahe (in which massive astronomical instruments were made, often with little practical purpose) and the large cryogenics laboratory established by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in 1904 have been cited as early examples of Big Science.

<doc id="777175" wikidata="Q11335276" url="?curid=777175" title="List of Major League Baseball players from Puerto Rico">
<text>Puerto Rico currently has the fourth-most active players in Major League Baseball (MLB) among Latin American jurisdictions, behind the Dominican Republic, Venezuela and Cuba. More than three hundred players from the archipelago have played in the major leagues since . This includes players who were born in either one of the archipelago&#x27;s islands and those of Puerto Rican heritage. Only those players who have worked in the major leagues are listed, not those active in the minor leagues, nor negro independent leagues.

For years, it was considered that the first player from Puerto Rico to play in the major leagues was Hiram Bithorn in 1942. But this changed in December 2020, when seven Negro baseball leagues between 1920 and 1948 were recognized as &quot;major leagues.&quot; Thus, the first Puerto Rican to play baseball on the major leagues was Jose &quot;Gacho&quot; Torres, who debuted in 1926.

After the baseball color line was abandoned following Jackie Robinson&#x27;s debut in the National League of MLB, more players from the island signed contracts. This led to an improvement in their performance, and some of them were selected to participate in the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Including their names in the Major League Baseball draft is a requisite for first-year players born in Puerto Rico, because the league recognizes the island as a jurisdiction within the United States. Following the implementation of this measure, Puerto Rico&#x27;s government requested exclusion from the draft and help to develop players, in order to reduce the impact of the change in the format of talent development.

==Historical performance and regulations==
Baseball was introduced to Puerto Rico by immigrants during the nineteenth century. The first sanctioned baseball game in the island was played on January 9, 1898, in Santurce, Puerto Rico, where two teams composed of Puerto Rican, American and Cuban players participated. After this game, baseball became a widespread sport and professional and amateur leagues were organized. During this time period, the Puerto Rico national teams experienced success on international competition and Afro-Puerto Rican players began to participate in the Negro leagues.

Hiram Bithorn debuted as a pitcher with the Chicago Cubs on April 15, 1942, but before him, there were about 10 other players who worked on the negro leagues, now considered as major leagues. About 17 other Puerto Rican players in the negro leagues were active right before the introduction of African American players in Major League Baseball, and thus, there were more chances to players born in the island. Subsequently, Afro-Puerto Rican players such as Orlando Cepeda and Victor Pellot Power began having solid performances in the league, and were selected to participate in the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. In , Roberto Clemente became the first player from Puerto Rico and first Latin American to be elected as a member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. Since then Puerto Rico has kept a stable number of players in the league. During this timeframe, several players have been selected to participate in the All-Star Game or won awards for their performance, while others imposed records within the league. These include Javy López, who holds the record for most home runs hit by a catcher in a single season. Both Iván Rodríguez and Roberto Alomar hold the record for most Gold Glove Awards in their positions. Recipients of the Most Valuable Player Award include Orlando Cepeda, Juan González and Iván Rodríguez. Roberto Clemente and Mike Lowell also won the World Series MVP Award in their respective divisions. Carlos Delgado is the only Latin to hit 4 homers in a game.

Originally, players who were either born or naturalized in Puerto Rico were able to sign with MLB teams as free agents, usually receiving minor-league contracts prior to their debut in the league. In , Major League Baseball decided to include the island in the list of jurisdictions within the United States, which made mandatory that first-year players include their name in the Major League Baseball Draft in order to receive a contract. This was based on an initiative that was supposed to create a national and international drafting system. The change reduced the number of players that were able to participate in the league, by limiting the number of them selected by the teams; this led to the island&#x27;s Secretary of Recreation and Sports, to formally ask to Major League&#x27;s involvement in developing specialized schools to produce more players and other measures to reduce the impact of the draft&#x27;s implementation. The original proposal included Puerto Rico&#x27;s exclusion of the draft for a period of ten years, but this was not approved by the league.

Puerto Rico was one of sixteen teams to participate in the inaugural edition of the World Baseball Classic. The tournament was created by Major League Baseball, the Major League Baseball Players Association, and other professional baseball leagues and their players associations around the world, including the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League. The first event was organized in 2006, and was sanctioned by the International Baseball Federation. Puerto Rico won the silver medal on both 2013 and 2017 classics. The Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan, Puerto Rico hosted 22 Montreal Expos home games in , after the league decided to relocate the team to San Juan as part of an experiment to &quot;globalize&quot; baseball. During the series there was an average attendance of 14,222.

<doc id="777177" wikidata="Q5330707" url="?curid=777177" title="Eastlake, Seattle">
<text>Eastlake is a neighborhood in Seattle, Washington, so named because of its location on the eastern shore of Lake Union. Its main thoroughfare is Eastlake Avenue E., which runs from Howell Street at the northeast corner of Downtown north over the University Bridge to the University District, where it connects to Roosevelt Way N.E. and 11th Avenue N.E. A second thoroughfare is Boylston Avenue E.; as an arterial, it parallels Interstate 5 for the four blocks between E. Newton Street to the south and E. Roanoke Street to the north, acting as an extension of Capitol Hill&#x27;s Lakeview Boulevard E.

==Characteristics==
Eastlake is bounded on the west by Lake Union; on the north by Portage Bay, beyond which is the University District; on the east by Interstate 5, beyond which is Capitol Hill; and on the south by E. Galer Street, beyond which is the Cascade and South Lake Union neighborhoods.

The neighborhood contains a mixture of residential buildings, both houses and apartments, and small businesses, especially on Eastlake Avenue. Though populated by all manner of Seattleites, Eastlake is a particularly attractive location for people with ties to the University of Washington, which can be reached via the 70 King County Metro bus line. The neighborhood is also home to, among other things, stores, restaurants, the original Red Robin gourmet burger restaurant (now closed), a bakery, and numerous houseboats.

==History==
Victor Steinbrueck wrote of the neighborhood in 1962 that it was &quot;progressing from a generally mediocre residential community to one of apartments and small business and offices.&quot;

Near the north tip of the neighborhood is a pseudo-Norman French building known as the Martello, which the Seattle Department of Neighborhoods characterizes as &quot;one of Eastlake&#x27;s most significant buildings.&quot; Built as a private home in 1916, it was remodeled in the 1920s by Fred Anhalt as a furniture store. For many years it was a tavern, later a bar, called Rapunzel&#x27;s; it is now Sebi&#x27;s Bistro.

==Eastlake Shake Fair==
The annual Eastlake Shake fair (renamed Lake Fest in 2006) is held in a closed-off section of Franklin Avenue E. between E. Roanoke and E. Louisa Streets on the playground of the TOPS@Seward public school. The fair features live music, local vendors, and—a neighborhood favorite—the Eastlake Shake Pet Parade.

==Notable people==

Current notable Eastlake residents include retired four-star General Andrew J. Kelly, and 2002 America&#x27;s Cup runner-up Elleson Schurtz.

==Sleepless in Seattle==
Eastlake is also home to Seattle&#x27;s highest concentration of floating homes (a.k.a. houseboats), the likes of which were made famous in the 1993 film &quot;Sleepless in Seattle.&quot; Their architectural styles range from the bohemian-eclectic to exuberant stucco-modern. New construction of houseboats taking place on Fairview Ave. E. is underway, with the slips alone often selling for over $1 million.

<doc id="777178" wikidata="Q1078696" url="?curid=777178" title="Usopp">
<text>, also known by his monikers Sniper King and &quot;God&quot; Usopp, is a fictional character in the &quot;One Piece&quot; franchise created by Eiichiro Oda. He serves as the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates.

He was the fourth member to join Luffy&#x27;s crew and the third officially after the confrontation they had with Captain Kuro. His dream is to become a great pirate like his father Yasopp, member of the Red-Haired Pirates of &quot;Red-Haired&quot; Shanks.

Usopp is recognizable for his long nose, a reference to the fact that he tends to lie a lot. He is a gifted inventor, painter, and sculptor. In combat, he relies primarily on his slingshot to fire various kinds of ammunition with great precision in coordination with a set of lies and other weapons giving him a unique fighting style named &quot;The Usopp Arsenal&quot;. To help the Straw Hats rescue Nico Robin, he achieves notoriety under his alter-ego , a hero sniper wearing a golden mask and cape. Usopp’s declaration of war on the World Government flag is cited by fans and critics alike as one of the best moments of One Piece. Eventually, after helping the Straw Hats liberate Dressrosa from Don Quixote Doflamingo&#x27;s rule, he becomes infamous as due to freeing thousands of people from lives as slave toys, as well as light shining from above onto Usopp whilst underground as he addressed the people he freed.

==Creation and conception==
In the original concept art for the Straw Hats, Usopp was labeled the Vice-Captain of the crew. Usopp is based on Pinocchio and his name refers to &quot;uso&quot; (Japanese for lie) and Aesop’s Fables. When asked by a fan what the nationalities of the members of the Straw Hat Pirates would be if &quot;One Piece&quot; was set in the real world, Oda replied that Usopp would be African. Usopp is the only Straw Hat Pirate to be assigned a continent rather than a nationality.

Usopp has black hair and a long nose and usually wears a dark yellow diamond-patterned kerchief, special sniper goggles, and brown coveralls with a white sash and no shirt underneath (despite wearing a dark green shirt in Skypiea). Usopp inherited his famous nose of his mother, while the rest of his face resembles that of his father.

After the two-year timeskip, Usopp undergoes a dramatic physical transformation, becoming much more muscular and having longer hair. Usopp also got a new hat and takes his glasses besides sniper in the neck and headphones. He also fights using plants from the Boin Archipelago, which may be inspired by the original concept art of the crew featuring a male botanist.

===Personality===
Usopp is one of the most sentimental of the Straw Hat Pirates, and cries or gets angry at times of emotional stress. At the beginning of the series, Usopp was a liar and easily frightened, as well as anxious, insecure, and compulsive. Usopp&#x27;s cowardice is the result of his fear and insecurity, especially when faced with uncertainty. While Usopp is a coward by nature, he is able to put aside their fears for desperate times: despite danger, Usopp faces his fears for the sake of their friends and sometimes even people he barely knows.

===Abilities===
Despite not excelling in physical fitness, Usopp, like his father, has a unique aim with his slingshot, it is able to hit many people without missing once, even at distances at which he can barely see the target. To attack, Usopp uses a slingshot and shoots spherical projectiles which he built and called &quot;Stars&quot;. Each Star has different effects: some include explosive, smoke, fire, barbed and even hot sauce. Following the visit of the Straw Hats to Skypiea, Usopp has added to his arsenal the shell-shaped Dials, artifacts that can do things such as reflect attacks, emit fire, that he obtained there. After the two-year time skip, Usopp uses a plant-based fighting style based on plants from the Boin Archipelago, replacing most of the conventional ammunition he used to use with Pop Greens, seeds which can quickly grow into full-sized dangerous plants.

Also worth mentioning that Usopp is a great inventor and artist, having drawn Luffy&#x27;s jolly roger and created the Clima-Tact for Nami. Additionally, when the Straw Hat crew was without a shipwright, Usopp was the one who repaired the Going Merry whenever it got damaged.

===Haki===
Usopp awakened his Observation Haki during the latter half of the Dressrosa revolt, as he was able to see auras of Luffy, Law, and Sugar, who were in the royal palace, from the old King&#x27;s Plateau near the Corrida Colosseum. With this, he was able to pinpoint Sugar&#x27;s location and snipe her down from such a distance.

===Portrayals===

In the original Japanese version of the &quot;One Piece&quot; anime series and related media in the franchise, Usopp is voiced by Kappei Yamaguchi. Jason Griffith and Sonny Strait provide his voice in the 4Kids and Funimation English adaptations, respectively.

Usopp is portrayed by Jacob Romero Gibson in the live-action adaptation of &quot;One Piece&quot;.

==Appearances==
===&quot;One Piece&quot; manga===
Usopp meets Luffy and his friends when they arrive in Syrup Village. He befriends Luffy upon learning that he knows Usopp&#x27;s father Yasopp, who is a member of the Red-Haired Pirates. He also learns that the butler of his friend Kaya is actually a pirate named Kuro, who is plotting to assassinate Kaya for her fortune. He warns the village of an imminent attack from Kuro&#x27;s pirates, but the villagers do not believe him due to his habit of lying. Kaya, who trusts her butler completely, also rejects him. Despite this, he decides to fight the pirates to protect his village and make the incident another lie. The next morning, he fights the Black Cat Pirates with Luffy and the others, defeats the hypnotist Django and averts Kaya&#x27;s assassination. He keeps the incident a secret from the village and departs with Luffy&#x27;s crew on the &quot;Going Merry&quot;, a ship gifted by Kaya. After demonstrating his skill with a cannon, Usopp is granted the position of the Straw Hat Pirates&#x27; sniper.

When the Krieg Pirates attack the floating restaurant Baratie, Usopp and Zoro depart to pursue Nami, who has disappeared. They witness the devastation of the town Gosa by the Arlong Pirates, and they meet Nami&#x27;s adoptive sister Nojiko in Cocoyashi Village. Usopp is captured by Arlong after saving the villager Genzo, but is saved by Nami. In the battle of Arlong Park, he faces off against Arlong&#x27;s henchman Chu. He initially flees, but changes his mind and challenges Chu directly, defeating him with flaming ammunition. In Loguetown he obtains the latest model of sniper goggles. In Little Garden he meets the giant warriors Dorry and Brogy, who have been dueling for over a century, and is impressed by their pride. He challenges Mr. 3 – an agent of the secret criminal company Baroque Works – who tainted the giants&#x27; duel, and frees Zoro and his friends from Mr. 3&#x27;s trap by exploiting its weakness to heat. On Drum Island, he and the princess Nefertari Vivi are nearly killed in an avalanche. He takes the rebel Dalton to Drum Castle and reunites with Luffy&#x27;s crew.

Before landing in Alabasta, Nami asks Usopp to create a weapon for her, and he invents the Clima-Tact. He is trapped and captured by Crocodile in his lair, but is freed by Sanji. In Alabasta&#x27;s capital he encounters Mr. 2, who defeats him and steals his goggles. After explaining the situation to Sanji, he joins Tony Tony Chopper in an arduous fight against Mr. 4&#x27;s team, in which they are victorious. On Sky Island, Usopp works with Luffy and Sanji to rescue Nami and the others, who had been taken to a sacrificial altar, and they engage in combat against the priest Satori. That night, Usopp witnesses a mysterious figure repairing the &quot;Going Merry&quot;, which had been damaged in an attack by the priest Shura. The next morning, Usopp remains on the ship as part of an escape team, but is defeated by Enel. After regaining consciousness, Usopp and Sanji secretly sabotage Enel&#x27;s ship and rescue Nami. In the &quot;Davy Back Fight&quot; against the Foxy Pirates, he participates in the &quot;Donut Race&quot; with Nami and Robin. Although Usopp&#x27;s performance grants them a great distance, they are hindered by Foxy&#x27;s ability and lose the race.

In Water 7, when the repair funds for the &quot;Going Merry&quot; are stolen by the Franky Family demolition company, Usopp goes to face them alone, but is beaten. He apologizes to his comrades, but Luffy discloses his decision to part ways with the irreparable &quot;Going Merry&quot;. In defense of the ship&#x27;s dignity, Usopp unsuccessfully fights Luffy in a duel and leaves the Straw Hat Pirates. He and Franky are captured by the World Government&#x27;s CP9 unit and are put on a train bound for Enies Lobby, but are freed by Sanji, who had snuck onboard. After learning that Robin had been captured by CP9, Usopp departs and returns as the masked figure , who joins in the rescue of Robin. As Sanji and Franky fight the guards on the train, Sogeking&#x27;s attempt to rescue Robin is thwarted by her refusal.

At Enies Lobby, Sogeking encounters the giant gatekeeper Oimo and tells him of Dorry and Brogy&#x27;s situation, which leads him and his friend Kashii to rebel. At the Tower of Justice, Sogeking shoots down the World Government flag on Luffy&#x27;s order, shocking the Navy. He is then defeated by CP9&#x27;s Jabra, but snipes at Spandam to prevent Robin&#x27;s capture and delivers a key he received from Zoro, greatly contributing to Robin&#x27;s rescue. During Luffy&#x27;s battle with Rob Lucci, Usopp removes his mask and boosts Luffy&#x27;s resolve with his words. As Sogeking, he watches the end of the &quot;Going Merry&quot; with his friends. When Luffy and his crew return to Water 7 and are about to depart, Usopp initially tries to rejoin the crew without resolving the matter, but ultimately admits his mistaken stubbornness and apologizes, thus reconciling with Luffy and rejoining the Straw Hat Pirates. Following the Enies Lobby incident, a bounty is placed on Sogeking.

At Thriller Bark, Usopp lands with Nami and Chopper and they learn the secret of the zombies in Hogback&#x27;s mansion. They wander the mansion while fleeing from the zombies and meet up with Franky and Robin. When Usopp confronts Perona, her power has no effect on him as he is &quot;always negative&quot;. He struggles against Perona&#x27;s servant Kumashi, but by repeatedly asking himself questions as Sogeking, he is able to determine Perona&#x27;s weakness and defeat her. Afterward, he and the crew defeat the giant zombie Oars.

When the crew is separated, Usopp lands on the Greenstone island, where he improves his skills for two years until he reunites with the crew. On the island of Dressrosa he liberates a ground of enslaved toys, earning himself a temporary bounty of 500,000,000 by Doflamingo. This later becomes a permanent bounty of 200,000,000 and the new epithet .

===In other media===
Usopp has made several appearances in other media, including, but not limited to, every &quot;One Piece&quot; licensed electronic video game to date. He is also a support character in &quot;Jump Super Stars&quot;. In 2006, he is featured in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;/&quot;One Piece&quot;/&quot;Naruto&quot; crossover game &quot;Battle Stadium D.O.N.&quot; as a playable character.

==Reception==
Usopp ranked in the Top 10 of the first three &quot;Shōnen Jump&quot; character popularity polls. In the fourth through seventh popularity polls, Usopp was ranked among the Top 15 most popular characters. Usopp was also prominently involved in six out of the ten most heartbreaking scenes in the manga: the Going Merry’s funeral, Robin saying she wants to live, the Straw Hats departing from Alabasta, the Going Merry rescuing the Straw Hats, the story of Usopp’s mother’s death, and Usopp begging Luffy to rejoin the crew.

In a 2007 Oricon poll, Usopp was voted the 10th most wanted character to receive a spin off amongst all respondents, and the 5th most popular amongst males. In a review of Funimation Entertainment&#x27;s second DVD release for Mania Entertainment, Bryce Coulter notes that Usopp &quot;brings lots of comic relief to the series&quot;, but also comments that he &quot;can be down right annoying at times.&quot;

Sean Cubillas of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; wrote, &quot;As the Straw Hats&#x27; resident comic relief, Usopp has made the fans laugh for several years. Whether it&#x27;s intentional or with his reluctant cowardice, Usopp has had some of the most unique interactions in the story. However, his most iconic scene to date is one that&#x27;s played totally straight. Adorned as the incredible Sniper King, he&#x27;s asked by Luffy to declare war on the world itself. Raising his slingshot up high, Sniper King shoots down the World Government&#x27;s flag in a fiery blaze that turns it to ashes and lights up the whole sky. With just a slingshot, Usopp managed to hit fans pretty deep.&quot; In another article, Cubillas stated, &quot;More fiction than fighter, Usopp has skirted his way through the series with tales so detailed and grand that he often uses them to trick his enemies. However, he always saves his best lies for his crew, as he realizes any adventure with Monkey D. Luffy could spell disaster for him. So, like a lot of kids trying to get out of middle school gym, Usopp turns to the doctors&#x27; notes. If Usopp doesn&#x27;t want to go somewhere or if he doesn&#x27;t want to leave the shop, he&#x27;ll always say he has some sort of disease, like the fan favorite &quot;Can&#x27;t-Get-On-This-Island-Disease.&quot;

Christian Markle of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; stated that Usopp has had the best character development of the Straw Hats due to his transition from cowardice to dependability and noted how he was the only person to temporarily leave the Straw Hats for personal reasons.

<doc id="777181" wikidata="Q2120111" url="?curid=777181" title="Tales from Watership Down">
<text>Tales from Watership Down is a collection of 19 short stories by Richard Adams, published in 1996 as a follow-up to Adams&#x27;s highly successful 1972 novel about rabbits, &quot;Watership Down&quot;. It consists of a number of short stories of rabbit mythology, followed by several chapters featuring many of the characters introduced in the earlier book. Like its predecessor, &quot;Tales from Watership Down&quot; features epigraphs at the beginning of each chapter and a Lapine glossary.

==Overview==
&quot;Tales from Watership Down&quot; is in three parts: the first consists of five traditional tales of El-ahrairah and two more modern rabbit stories, the second contains four episodes recounting events that befell El-ahrairah and Rabscuttle on their return from visiting the Black Rabbit of Inlé, and the third contains eight chapters dealing with the Watership warren in the months following the events of the original book.

New characters are introduced, such as: Flyairth, a doe who threatens to undermine the stability of Watership Down; Sandwort, a disrespectful young buck who eventually changes his ways; Coltsfoot, a depressed buck whom Fiver befriends; Stonecrop, an escaped hutch rabbit; and Nyreem, an Efrafan doe with an injured leg. Although most of the characters from &quot;Watership Down&quot; retain their roles, Hyzenthlay, a doe, rises to the position of Co-Chief Rabbit with her mate, Hazel.

==Literary significance and reception==
A reviewer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that while it was a &quot;lighthearted companion piece&quot; to &quot;Watership Down&quot;, it was &quot;a little disjointed as a stand-alone volume&quot;. The book was praised by a reviewer at &quot;Salon&quot;, who wrote: &quot;The pure, unfamiliar feelings evoked in &#x27;The Story of the Three Cows&#x27; and in the gory &#x27;The Hole in the Sky&#x27;—just two of the stories here—persist for quite a while after you&#x27;ve finished reading them&quot;.

<doc id="777195" wikidata="Q345899" url="?curid=777195" title="Luis Lloréns Torres">
<text>Luis Lloréns Torres (May 14, 1876 – June 16, 1944), was a Puerto Rican poet, playwright, and politician. He was an advocate for the independence of Puerto Rico.

==Early years==
Llorens Torres was born in Juana Diaz, Puerto Rico. His parents, Luis Aurelio del Carmen Llorens and Marcelina Soledad de Torres, were the wealthy owners of a coffee plantation. In Collores (a barrio of Juana Diaz), Llorens Torres was always in contact with nature, which accounts for the love that he felt for nature and country. He always stated that he was proud to come from Collores barrio. His poem made the barrio one of the most well-known of the island of Puerto Rico. 
His Catalan grandfather, Josep de Llorens i Robles, immigrated from Figueres, province of Girona, Spain. 

Llorens Torres went to school in Mayagüez and Maricao. He went to Spain after he finished his secondary studies on the island and studied at the University of Barcelona where he began his studies. He then proceeded to study Philosophy and Letters at the University of Granada where he obtained both a Doctorate degree and a law degree. In Spain he published his first book of poetic verses &quot;Al Pie de la Alhambra&quot;, which was dedicated to the woman who would eventually become his wife, Carmen Rivero.

==Political career==
Llorens Torres returned to Puerto Rico in 1901, married, and moved to Ponce where he established his own law firm (Nemesio Canales later joined his firm) and collaborated with the newspaper &quot;Lienzos del Solar&quot;. During this time he wrote some of his best works. He also met numerous poets like Julia de Burgos.

When Llorens Torres returned to Puerto Rico he found a political situation completely different than from the one that he had left. Puerto Rico had been invaded by the United States during the Puerto Rico Campaign of the Spanish–American War in 1898. This motivated Llorens Torres to join the political Union Party of Puerto Rico. The ideal of independence for the island. He transmitted his beliefs to the public through his poem &quot;El Patito Feo&quot; (The Ugly Duckling). He became a member of the Puerto Rican legislature and was named to the Camara of Delegates from 1908 to 1910 representing the municipality of Ponce. On February 8, 1912, together with Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón and Manuel Zeno Gandía, he wrote a manifesto which stated that it was time for Puerto Rico to have its independence. That year Llorens Torres, Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón, Manuel Zeno Gandía, Eugenio Benítez Castaño, and Pedro Franceschi founded the Independence party which was the first party in the history of the island to exclusively want Puerto Rican independence. Eugenio Benítez Castaño was named president of the short lived political party. In 1913, Llorens Torres co-founded with Nemesio Canales &quot;La Revista de Las Antillas...&quot;, a literary publication.

==&quot;Grito de Lares&quot;==
Llorens Torres&#x27; historical drama, &quot;El Grito de Lares (The Cry of Lares)&quot;, deals with the attempted overthrow of the Spanish government on the island with the intention of establishing the island as a sovereign republic. In the book, he describes the flag of the revolt created by Mariana Bracetti. The flag was divided in the middle by a white cross, the two lower corners were red and the two upper corners were blue. A white star was placed in the upper left blue corner. According to Llorens Torres, the white cross on the &quot;Grito de Lares&quot; flag stands for the yearning for homeland redemption, the red squares, the blood poured by the heroes of the rebellion, and the white star in the blue solitude square, stands for liberty and freedom.

==Works==
Among his works are décimas and poems:

* , 1899 poem
* , newspaper founded in 1913
* , magazine
* , magazine
* , (Collores) 1940 décima / poem
* , (Song of the Antilles) 1913 poem
* , 1914 book
* Distant Song, 1926 poem
* , (Creole Life), 1935 poem

==Death==
Llorens Torres died in Santurce, a barrio of San Juan, Puerto Rico. He defended the ideal of Puerto Rican independence until the day he died and was buried at the Puerto Rico Memorial Cemetery in Carolina, Puerto Rico.

==Legacy==
The Government of Puerto Rico has honored the memory of Luis Llorens Torres by naming a public housing project (Residencial Luis Lloréns Torres) in Santurce after him. Among the other things that were named after him are an avenue in San Juan, a high school in Juana Diaz, and a children&#x27;s academy in New York City. There is a bust of him in front of the high school named after him and there is a statue of Luis Llorens Torres, sculpted by the Puerto Rican sculptor Tomás Batista, in the &quot;Plazita Famosa&quot; of Juana Diaz.

<text>Shaun M. Hughes was an Australian astronomer at Siding Spring Observatory.

He co-discovered the periodic comet 130P/McNaught-Hughes.

Shaun Hughes left Siding Spring Observatory in 1992 for a fellowship at the California Institute of Technology, where he joined one of the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project teams, to measure the expansion rate of the universe, also known as the Hubble constant. This was achieved by observing Cepheid variable stars to measure distances to about 20 galaxies, then using these distances to tie together various other methods for measuring distances to thousands of galaxies.

He also pursued his research on Mira variables, also known as Long period variable stars. These are stars that are similar mass as the sun, only older, after they have become red giants, just prior to becoming planetary nebulae.

In 1994 he joined the Royal Greenwich Observatory in Cambridge, England, where he continued his research and supported UK astronomers observe at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory.

In 1998 the UK government, on the advice of some university astronomers, decided to close the Royal Greenwich Observatory. He then had a choice of moving his family back to the United States and stay working in astronomy, or change careers and stay in Cambridge.

<text>&quot;Du riechst so gut&quot; (, &quot;you smell so good&quot;) is a song by German Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein. It was released the band&#x27;s first single on 24 August 1995, also acting as the lead single from their debut studio album, &quot;Herzeleid&quot; (1995). The song describes the inner thoughts of a predator hunting his prey. The title is said to be inspired by Patrick Süskind&#x27;s &quot;Perfume&quot;, a favourite novel of Till Lindemann&#x27;s, the band&#x27;s lead singer. The single was re-released in 1998 under the name &quot;Du riechst so gut &#x27;98&quot;, featuring a different edit of the song and a new music video.

==Music video==
A music video was released for the song, depicting the band members shirtless in an all-white environment. The video opens with a Doberman Pinscher walking across the screen, with repeated cuts throughout of the dog looking curiously at the camera along with flowers shown in the &quot;Herzeleid&quot; album cover and this single. Till Lindemann is portrayed in simple close-up shots, sternly singing the lyrics and at one point sporting a menacing pair of goggles. The goggles known as &quot;Schlitzbrille&quot; were shown again in the music video for &quot;Ohne dich&quot;.

==Live performances==
The song was first performed during the very first Rammstein show, on 14 April 1994 in Leipzig, Germany. A fan favorite, it was used as the last song of the show during many of the &quot;Herzeleid&quot; tour concerts. During live concerts in the &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; tour, Till usually simulated firing rockets over the audience with a bow (actually propelled sitting on a string) and then the bow started to propel sparks in all directions as Till rotated it. During some concerts, he used it during different songs, like Laichzeit at the Bizarre Festival in 1997, or Du hast, during the Family Values tour in 1998. Guitarists Paul and Richard would conduct the audience during the extended solo.

The song wasn&#x27;t played at all during the 2001-2002 &quot;Mutter&quot; tour, but it returned to the setlists on their &quot;Reise, Reise&quot; tour. This time, Richard and Paul wore jackets that shot flames/sparks from one of their sleeves, running from the shoulder down to their forearms; one would stand facing away from the audience, the other would stand facing the audience, and then the pyrotechnics would be activated simultaneously while the two performed the tapping hammer on solo. After being dropped for the Liebe Ist Für Alle Da tour in 2009, the song returned to the setlist on the 2010 part of the tour, and the song was occasionally performed with the pyrotechnic jackets, however this time it was done with both guitarists facing the audience.

==Du riechst so gut &#x27;98==
On 17 April 1998, &quot;Du riechst so gut&quot; was re-released as a single under the title, &quot;Du riechst so gut &#x27;98&quot;. The song retains its original arrangement, except the start is shorter.

===Music video===
A new music video was filmed as well. It depicts the band members as vampire creatures, who follow a young woman to a castle where a masquerade ball is taking place. They track the woman&#x27;s scent, infiltrating the ball until they find her. They seduce her into being their meal, then transform into a pack of wolves, escaping as the castle&#x27;s attendants pursue them. By the end of the video, it is shown that the young woman has become a vampire herself as the vampires turned her.
The video first premiered on 25 May 1998. The videoclip was shot between 20 and 25 April 1998, at castle Babelsberg in Potsdam/Berlin, Jagdschloß in Berlin district Pankow and was directed by Philipp Stölzl.
The video was inspired by the 1984 film &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot;.

<text>The Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, commonly known as the Royal Asiatic Society, was established, according to its royal charter of 11 August 1824, to further &quot;the investigation of subjects connected with and for the encouragement of science, literature and the arts in relation to Asia.&quot; From its incorporation the society has been a forum, through lectures, its journal, and other publications, for scholarship relating to Asian culture and society of the highest level. It is the United Kingdom&#x27;s senior learned society in the field of Asian studies. Fellows of the society are elected regularly and include highly accomplished and notable scholars of Asian studies; they use the post-nominal letters FRAS.

==History==
The society was founded in London in 1823, with the first general meeting being held on 15 March at the Thatched House on St James&#x27;s Street, London, chaired by Henry Thomas Colebrooke. This meeting elected the officers (including Charles Williams-Wynn as the first president) and council, defined that the name of the society was the Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, and that members should be designated Members of the Asiatic Society (MAS). It also empowered the council to frame regulations (these were approved at the next general meeting on 19 April), to look for a suitable site for the society&#x27;s meetings, and to seek a charter of incorporation. Later that year, at a general meeting held on 7 June, Williams-Wynn announced that King George IV, who had already agreed to be patron of the society, had granted the title of &quot;Royal&quot; to the society, giving it the name of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland and its members the designation Members of the Royal Asiatic Society (MRAS). The society received its charter under that name on 11 August 1824.

The Royal Asiatic Society was established by a group primarily composed of notable scholars and colonial administrators. It was intended to be the British counterpart to the Asiatic Society of Calcutta, which had been founded in 1784 by the noted Sanskrit scholar and jurist Sir William Jones. A leading figure in the foundation of the Royal Asiatic Society was Henry Thomas Colebrooke, who was himself an important Sanskrit scholar, and one time President of the Asiatic Society of Calcutta. Another was Sir George Staunton, 2nd Baronet, a Chinese-speaking diplomat who had worked in China.

When the Oriental Club of London was formed in 1824, membership of the Royal Asiatic Society was stated as one of the four qualifications for membership of the new club.

Due to the nature of the society&#x27;s close connection with the British Empire in the east, much of the work originating with the society has been focused on topics concerning the Indian subcontinent. However, the purview of the Society extends far beyond India: all of Asia and into Islamic North Africa, and Ethiopia are included. The Society does have a few limitations on its field on interest, such as recent political history and current affairs. This particular moratorium led to the founding of the Central Asian Society, which later became the Royal Society for Asian Affairs. After World War II, with the gradual end of British political hegemony &#x27;east of Suez&#x27;, the Society maintained its disinterested academic focus on Asia.

Lectures are regularly held at the offices of the Society. There is no charge for regular lectures. Many past lectures are available to listen to or watch online.

==Members and fellows==
Originally, members of the Society were styled Members (MRAS), Honorary Members (Hon. MRAS), Corresponding Members (CMRAS) and Foreign Members (FMRAS). By the 1870s, the post-nominal letters &quot;FRAS&quot;, indicating fellowship of the Society, were being used by some members, including the physician and writer on India John Forbes Watson, and the writer on India and co-founder of the India Reform Society John Dickinson. This usage continued through the twentieth century, advertisements in the Society&#x27;s &quot;Journal&quot; also reflecting the use of the letters &quot;FRAS&quot; by some members, although all members of the Society were referred to as &quot;members&quot; in the 1908 constitution, and it was not until 1967 that reports of the Anniversary Meeting referred to &quot;fellows&quot; rather than &quot;members&quot;. , members are designated &quot;fellows&quot; or &quot;student fellows&quot;; no post-nominals are assigned by the Society to these grades in its regulations, but the use of the post-nominal letters &quot;FRAS&quot; is recognized in numerous reference works. The post-nominal letters are used by some academics working in Asia-related fields, and have been used in the Society&#x27;s &quot;Journal&quot; in reference to the Indologist Michael D. Willis, to the poet and translator of Bengali William Radice and to the Islamic scholar Leonard Lewisohn.

Notable members and fellows of the Society have included Rabindranath Tagore, Sir Aurel Stein, Sir Wilfred Thesiger, and George V. Tsereteli.

==Branches==
The society is affiliated with associate societies in India (Calcutta, Mumbai, Bangalore, Madras and Bihar), the former branch in Mumbai now being known as the Asiatic Society of Mumbai.

It is also affiliated with the Royal Asiatic Society of Sri Lanka, the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong (established in 1847), the Asiatic Society of Japan (established in 1875), the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society (established in 1877), Royal Asiatic Society Korea Branch (established in 1900) and the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh (established in 1952 as Asiatic Society of Pakistan, and since 1972 renamed as Asiatic Society of Bangladesh).

In China, the former South China Branch is now known as the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong. The North China branch has been re-established in 2006 in Shanghai as the Royal Asiatic Society China, the original branch having been founded in 1857 and dissolved in 1952. It has chapters in Suzhou and Beijing.

==Library and archives==
The Library has material from the 12th century to the present. All Society collections can be accessed in its dedicated Reading Room in the Society&#x27;s offices in London during advertised opening hours. The Society also maintains a Digital Library.

==Journal==
The &quot;Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society&quot; is published by Cambridge University Press four times a year, each issue containing a number of scholarly essays, and several book reviews. It has been published under its current name since 1991, having previously been the &quot;Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; (1834–1991) and &quot;Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; (1824–1834). The present editor of the &quot;Journal&quot; is Daud Ali of the University of Pennsylvania. The &quot;Journal&quot; is double-peer-refereed.

==Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland==
This fund was initially established in 1828. The results of its initial funding projects were soon forthcoming. The Fund became one of a large number of Victorian subscription printing clubs which published translations, re-issued historical works or commissioned original books which were too specialized for commercial publication; but unlike most of those now defunct organizations, the work of the Royal Asiatic Society Oriental Translation Fund is on-going into the 21st century with a &quot;new series&quot; and &quot;old series&quot; microform catalog available for scholarly research.

<text>Ouabain or (from Somali &quot;waabaayo&quot;, &quot;arrow poison&quot; through French &quot;ouabaïo&quot;) also known as g-strophanthin, is a plant derived toxic substance that was traditionally used as an arrow poison in eastern Africa for both hunting and warfare. Ouabain is a cardiac glycoside and, in lower doses, can be used medically to treat hypotension and some arrhythmias. It acts by inhibiting the Na/K-ATPase, also known as the sodium–potassium ion pump. However, adaptations to the alpha-subunit of the -ATPase via amino acid substitutions, have been observed in certain species, namely some herbivore insect species, that have resulted in toxin resistance.

It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.

==Sources==
Ouabain can be found in the roots, stems, leaves, and seeds of the &quot;Acokanthera schimperi&quot; and &quot;Strophanthus gratus&quot; plants, both of which are native to eastern Africa.

==Mechanism of action==
Ouabain is a cardiac glycoside that acts by non-selectively inhibiting the -ATPase sodium–potassium ion pump. Once ouabain binds to this enzyme, the enzyme ceases to function, leading to an increase of intracellular sodium. This increase in intracellular sodium reduces the activity of the sodium–calcium exchanger (NCX), which pumps one calcium ion out of the cell and three sodium ions into the cell down their concentration gradient. Therefore, the decrease in the concentration gradient of sodium into the cell which occurs when the Na/K-ATPase is inhibited reduces the ability of the NCX to function. This in turn elevates intracellular calcium. This results in higher cardiac contractility and an increase in cardiac vagal tone. The change in ionic gradients caused by ouabain can also affect the membrane voltage of the cell and result in cardiac arrhythmias.

===Symptoms===
An overdose of ouabain can be detected by the presence of the following symptoms: rapid twitching of the neck and chest musculature, respiratory distress, increased and irregular heartbeat, rise in blood pressure, convulsions, wheezing, clicking, and gasping rattling. Death is caused by cardiac arrest.

===Toxicology===
Ouabain is a highly toxic compound, however, it has a low bioavailability and is absorbed poorly from the alimentary tract as so much of the oral dose is destroyed. Intravenous administration results in greater available concentrations. After intravenous administration, the onset of action occurs within 2–10 minutes in humans with the maximum effect enduring for 1.5 hours.

Ouabain is eliminated by renal excretion, largely unchanged.

==Biological effects==

===Endogenous ouabain===
In 1991, a specific high affinity sodium pump inhibitor indistinguishable from ouabain was first discovered in the human circulation and proposed as one of the potential mediators of long term blood pressure and the enhanced salt excretion following salt and volume loading. This agent was an inhibitor of the sodium pump that acted similarly to digitalis. A number of analytical techniques led to the conclusion that this circulating molecule was ouabain and that humans were producing it as an endogenous hormone. A large portion of the scientific community agreed that this inhibitor was endogenous ouabain and that there was strong evidence to indicate that it was synthesized in the adrenal gland. One early speculative interpretation of the analytical data led to the proposal that endogenous ouabain may have been the 11 epimer, i.e., an isomer of plant ouabain. However, this possibility was excluded by various methods including the synthesis of the 11 epimer and the demonstration that it has different chromatographic behavior from ouabain. Critically, the primary observations concerning the identification of ouabain in mammals were repeated and confirmed using a variety of tissue sources on three different continents with advanced analytical methods as summarized elsewhere.

Despite widespread analytical confirmation, some questioned whether or not this endogenous substance is ouabain. The arguments were based less upon rigorous analytical data but more on the fact that immunoassays are neither entirely specific nor reliable. Hence, it was suggested that some assays for endogenous ouabain detected other compounds or failed to detect ouabain at all. Additionally, it was suggested that rhamnose, the L-sugar component of ouabain, could not be synthesized within the body despite published data to the contrary. Yet another argument against the existence of endogenous ouabain was the lack of effect of rostafuroxin (a first generation ouabain receptor antagonist) on blood pressure in an unselected population of hypertensive patients.

===Medical uses===
Ouabain is no longer approved for use in the USA. In France and Germany, however, intravenous ouabain has a long history in the treatment of heart failure, and some continue to advocate its use intravenously and orally in angina pectoris and myocardial infarction despite its poor and variable absorption. The positive properties of ouabain regarding the prophylaxis and treatment of these two indications are documented by several studies.

==Animal use of ouabain==
The African crested rat (&quot;Lophiomys imhausi&quot;) has a broad, white-bordered strip of hairs covering an area of glandular skin on the flank. When the animal is threatened or excited, the mane on its back erects and this flank strip parts, exposing the glandular area. The hairs in this flank area are highly specialised; at the tips they are like ordinary hairs, but are otherwise spongy, fibrous, and absorbent. The rat is known to deliberately chew the roots and bark of the Poison-arrow tree (&quot;Acokanthera schimperi&quot;), which contains ouabain. After the rat has chewed the tree, instead of swallowing the poison it slathers the resulting masticate onto its specialised flank hairs which are adapted to absorb the poisonous mixture. It thereby creates a defense mechanism that can sicken or even kill predators which attempt to bite it.

==Synthesis==

The total synthesis of ouabain was achieved in 2008 by Deslongchamps laboratory in Canada. It was synthesized under the hypothesis that a polyanionic cyclization (double Michael addition followed by aldol condensation) would allow access to a tetracyclic intermediate with the desired functionality. The figure below shows the key steps in the synthesis of ouabain.

In their synthesis, Zhang &quot;et al.&quot; from the Deslongchamps laboratory condensed cyclohexenone A with Nazarov substitute B in a double Michael addition to produce tricycle C. At the indicated position, C was reduced to the aldehyde and the alcohol group was protected with p-methoxybenzyl ether (PMB) to form the aldol precursor needed to produce D. After several steps, intermediate E was produced. E contained all the required functionalities and stereochemistry needed to produce ouabain. The structure of E was confirmed by comparison against the degradation product of ouabain. Methylation of E, catalyzed by rhodium, produced F. The dehydroxylation and selective oxidation of the secondary hydroxy group of F produced G. G reacted with triphenyl phosphoranylidene ketene and the ester bonds in G were hydrolyzed to produce ouabagenin, a precursor to ouabain. The glycosylation of ouabagenin with rhamnose produced ouabain.

==History==

===Africa===
Poisons derived from &quot;Acokanthera&quot; plants are known to have been used in Africa as far back as the 3rd century BC when Theophrastus reported a toxic substance that the Ethiopians would smear on their arrows. The poisons derived from this genus of plants were used throughout eastern Africa, typically as arrow poisons for hunting and warfare. &quot;Acokanthera schimperi&quot;, in particular, exhibits a very large amount of ouabain, which the Kenyans, Tanzanians, Rwandans, Ethiopians, and Somalis would use as an arrow poison.

The poison was extracted from the branches and leaves of the plant by boiling them over a fire. Arrows would then be dipped into the concentrated black tar-like juice that formed. Often, certain magical additives were also mixed in with the ouabain extract in order to make the poison work according to the hunter&#x27;s wishes. In Kenya, the Giriama and Langulu poison makers would add an elephant shrew to the poison mixture in order to facilitate the pursuit of their prey. They had observed that an elephant shrew would always run straight ahead or follow a direct path and thought that these properties would be transferred to the poison. A poisonous arrow made with this shrew was thought to cause the hunted animal to behave like the shrew and run in a straight path. In Rwanda members of the Nyambo tribe, also known poison arrow makers, harvest the &quot;Aconkathera&quot; plants according to how many dead insects are found under it - more dead insects under a shrub indicating a higher potency of poison. 
Although ouabain was used as an arrow poison primarily for hunting, it was also used during battle. One example of this occurred during a battle against the Portuguese, who had stormed Mombasa in 1505. Portuguese records indicated that they had suffered a great deal from the poisoned arrows.

===Europe===
European imperial expansion and exploration into Africa overlapped with the rise of the European pharmaceutical industry towards the end of the nineteenth century. British troops were the target of arrows poisoned with the extracts of various &quot;Strophanthus&quot; species. They were familiar with the deadly properties of these plants and brought samples back to Europe. Around this time, interest in the plant grew. It was known that ouabain was a cardiac poison, but there was some speculation about its potential medical uses.

In 1882, ouabain was first isolated from the plant by the French chemist Léon-Albert Arnaud as an amorphous substance, which he identified as a glycoside. Ouabain was seen as a possible treatment for certain cardiac conditions.

<text>General Cao Kun (; courtesy name: Zhongshan () (December 12, 1862 – May 15, 1938) was a Chinese warlord and politician, who served as the President of the Republic of China from 1923 to 1924, as well as the military leader of the Zhili clique in the Beiyang Army; he also served as a trustee of the Catholic University of Peking.

== Early life and rise to leadership ==
Cao was born to a poor family in Tianjin. During the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894, he went with the army to fight in Joseon. After the war was over he joined Yuan Shikai to participate in the training of the New Army (known as the Beiyang Army). Admired by Yuan, Cao managed to rise very quickly. By the time of the 1911 Xinhai Revolution he commanded the Beiyang 3rd Division.

He was made a general in the Beiyang Army and led the Zhili clique after the death of Feng Guozhang. During the 1918 election he was promised the vice-presidency by Duan Qirui but the office remained vacant after most of the National Assembly left, depriving it of a quorum. He felt betrayed by Duan and defeated him in battle in 1920. After forcing the resignations of both Xu Shichang and Li Yuanhong, and engaging in bribery, he became president of the Republic of China (in Beijing) on 10 October 1923, serving to 2 November 1924.

In March 1922, Cao attempted to launch an airline, &quot;Beijing-Han Airlines&quot;, with a Handley Page aircraft (likely a modified HP O/400). Unfortunately, the airline&#x27;s 3-day trial tour ended in disaster: the plane crashed on approach to Beijing, killing all 14 onboard.

Cao had a family connection to the Chinese Muslim military commander Ma Fuxing, who resided in Xinjiang.

== &quot;Bribing president&quot; ==
Cao Kun infamously acquired the presidential office by openly bribing assembly members with 5,000 silver dollars each. That episode brought disrepute to the Beiyang government and the National Assembly, which lacked a quorum even to hold elections. It also turned all the rival factions against him, and his own clique began suffering from dissension. Relations with his chief protégé, Wu Peifu, soured and there were rumors of an impending split within the Zhili clique, but they stayed together to fight against the Fengtian clique. One of his first acts as president was to promulgate the 1923 Constitution of China. Hastily drafted by the guilt-ridden assembly, it was deemed the most democratic and progressive charter yet, but like previous charters, it was ignored completely.

During a war against Zhang Zuolin in October 1924, Cao was betrayed and imprisoned by one of his own officers, General Feng Yuxiang, in the Beijing coup. Feng occupied Beijing and forced Cao to resign. His brother, Cao Rui, committed suicide while he was under house arrest. In 1926, Cao Kun was released from captivity as a goodwill gesture by Feng to Wu Peifu.

Cao died in his home at Tianjin in May 1938.

<text>Pierre Alexandre Claudius Balmain (; 18 May 1914 – 29 June 1982) was a French fashion designer and founder of leading post-war fashion house Balmain. Known for sophistication and elegance, he described the art of dressmaking as &quot;the architecture of movement&quot;.

==Early life==
Balmain&#x27;s father, who died when the future designer was seven, owned a wholesale drapery business. His mother, Françoise, ran a fashion boutique called Galeries Parisiennes with her sisters. He went to school at Chambéry and, during weekends with his uncle in the spa town of Aix-les-Bains, his interest in couture fashion was inspired by society women he met.

Balmain began studying architecture at the École des Beaux-Arts in 1933, also undertaking freelance work drawing for the designer Robert Piguet.

==Career==
After visiting the studio of Edward Molyneux in 1934, he was offered a job, leaving his studies and working for the designer for the succeeding five years. He joined Lucien Lelong during World War II – where he met the young designer Christian Dior.

==Death==
Pierre Balmain died at the age of 68 of liver cancer at the American Hospital of Paris, having just completed the sketches for his fall collection.

==Fashion house of Balmain==
The fashion house of Balmain opened in 1945. Initially, it showcased long bell-shaped skirts with small waists – a post-war style that was popularised in 1947 as Dior&#x27;s New Look. The first collection was showcased in &quot;Vogue&quot; in the November issue and the reviewer&#x27;s reaction was that Balmain delivered &quot;beautiful clothes that you really want to wear.&quot; A positive write-up in the magazine from Balmain&#x27;s friend Gertrude Stein helped to seal the designer&#x27;s success – early celebrity fans included the Duchess of Windsor who ordered from the collection.

Balmain actively promoted himself internationally from the early days – touring Australia in 1947 and designing a line to be produced in the country. He expanded operations to the United States in 1951, selling ready-to-wear clothes that earned him a prestigious Neiman Marcus Fashion Award in 1955. He was, by this stage, designing clothes worn by Vojislav Stanimirovic and stars, such as Marlene Dietrich and Katharine Hepburn.

Such was Balmain&#x27;s reputation that he was chosen to design the wardrobe of Queen Sirikit of Thailand during her 1960 tour of the United States. In 1968, he created outfits for the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble. He also designed outfits for both TWA and Malaysia–Singapore Airlines&#x27; (later Singapore Airlines) cabin crew in the 1960s and &#x27;70s. Air France&#x27;s first female pilot in 1975 wore a uniform by Balmain

After he dressed Nicaraguan first lady Hope Portocarrero, she appeared on the 1968 International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame.

Erik Mortensen, a student of the Danish designer Holger Blum, began as a design assistant at Balmain in 1948. He and Balmain worked well together, and Mortensen quickly went from assistant to collaborator. He and Balmain worked together for the rest of Balmain&#x27;s life. Margit Brandt worked as a young designer with Pierre Balmain in the early 1960s. Balmain also spotted the talent of Karl Lagerfeld, hiring him in 1954 after judging a fashion competition that the young German designer won.

Balmain&#x27;s vintage couture gowns remain popular, and have been worn by Angelina Jolie, Penélope Cruz, Alexandra Kerry, Tatiana Sorokko, Kate Moss, Kristin Davis and Zendaya.

===Costume design===
Balmain was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Costume Design and won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Costume Design for &quot;Happy New Year&quot; (1980). Additional Broadway theatre credits include costumes for Sophia Loren in &quot;The Millionairess&quot; (1960) and Josephine Baker for her eponymous 1964 revue. He also was a costume designer for 16 films, including the Brigitte Bardot vehicle &quot;And God Created Woman&quot; and &quot;La Parisienne&quot;, and designed on-screen wardrobes for the actresses Vivien Leigh and Mae West. He made a lot of dresses for Dalida.

===Perfumes===
Pierre Balmain also created perfumes. His first scent – &quot;Elysees 64-83&quot; (1946, perfumer Germaine Cellier). &quot;Vent Vert&quot; (1947, G.Cellier) – one of the best-selling perfumes of the late 1940s and early 1950s. Other scents included &quot;Jolie Madame&quot; (1953), &quot;Monsieur Balmain&quot; (1964), &quot;Miss Balmain&quot; (1967) – perfumes of Germaine Cellier, &quot;Ivoire&quot; (1979).

<text>Waratah–Wynyard Council is a local government body in Tasmania, situated in the north-west of the state. Waratah-Wynyard is classified as a rural local government area and has a population of 13,800, the major towns and localities of the region include Savage River, Sisters Beach, Somerset, Waratah and the principal town of Wynyard.

==History and attributes==
On 2 April 1993, the municipalities of Waratah and Wynyard were amalgamated to form the Waratah–Wynyard Council. There had been suggestion of renaming the council to Table Cape, which was the former name of the Wynyard Council until 1945, but this move failed at the ballot box.

Waratah-Wynyard is classified as rural, agricultural and very large under the Australian Classification of Local Governments.
===Logo===
The former logo of the council was selected from 124 competition entries in 1987. The enlarged &quot;W&quot; below Table Cape is indicative of ploughed paddocks representing the rural heritage – a lighthouse and a seagull were added to the final design. The word &quot;Waratah&quot; was added in 1993 following the amalgamation of the councils.

<text>Jeffrey Hammond (born 30 July 1946), often known by his former stage name Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond, is an English artist and former musician best known for being the bassist of progressive rock band Jethro Tull from 1971 to 1975. With Jethro Tull, Hammond played on some of the band&#x27;s most successful and well-known albums, including &quot;Aqualung&quot; (1971) and &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; (1972).

Hammond adopted the name &quot;Hammond-Hammond&quot; as a joke, since both his father&#x27;s surname and mother&#x27;s maiden name were the same. He also joked in interviews that his mother defiantly chose to keep her maiden name, just like Eleanor Roosevelt.

Hammond met Ian Anderson in grammar school and formed a band with him and future Jethro Tull members John Evan and Barriemore Barlow. After school, he gave up music he went to study painting. Meanwhile, Anderson formed Jethro Tull and wrote several songs about his friend&#x27;s idiosyncrasies, such as &quot;A Song for Jeffrey&quot; (on the album &quot;This Was&quot;), &quot;Jeffrey Goes to Leicester Square&quot; (&quot;Stand Up&quot;) and &quot;For Michael Collins, Jeffrey and Me&quot; (&quot;Benefit&quot;). Hammond is also mentioned in the lyrics of the &quot;Benefit&quot; track &quot;Inside&quot;. In January 1971, when Glenn Cornick left the band, Anderson talked Hammond into joining Jethro Tull.

According to Anderson, it was Hammond who came up with a name for the &quot;claghorn&quot;, a hybrid instrument Anderson made by attaching the mouthpiece from a saxophone and the bell of a toy trumpet to the body of a bamboo flute. The instrument can be heard on the track &quot;Dharma for One&quot; on the album &quot;This Was&quot;. According to Anderson, &quot;clag&quot; was a term Hammond used for feces, &quot;so &#x27;claghorn&#x27; presumably because it sounded shit!&quot;

In addition to playing bass, he narrated the surreal piece &quot;The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles&quot; on the album &quot;A Passion Play&quot;. He also received credit, along with Anderson and Evan, for writing the piece. In a similar vein, he wrote and performed the words for &quot;Sealion II&quot;, an alternate version of the &quot;WarChild&quot; song recorded during the same sessions as the album, which was first released on &quot;&quot; in 1993 and later included on the 40th anniversary edition of &quot;WarChild&quot;.

During his time in Jethro Tull, Hammond used to wear a black-and-white-striped suit and played a matching bass guitar; Hammond burned the suit in December 1975 upon his departure from the band.
According to Ian Anderson&#x27;s sleevenotes for the 2002 reissue of Tull&#x27;s &quot;Minstrel in the Gallery&quot;, Hammond &quot;returned to his first love, painting, and put down his bass guitar, never to play again.&quot; His replacement as bass player was John Glascock, a professional musician from the band Carmen.

Hammond has developed a second career as a landscape painter.

==Later musical appearances==
Anderson approached Hammond about standing in for the ailing Glascock during Jethro Tull&#x27;s fall 1978 U.S. tour, but after a rehearsal Hammond decided he was not up to the task, and Tony Williams took the job.

Hammond attended Jethro Tull&#x27;s 25th anniversary reunion party in 1994. He participated in an interview, along with Ian Anderson and Martin Barre, that was featured as a bonus track on the 1997 reissue of &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot;.

<text>Podujevë or Besianë ( or &quot;Besiana&quot;; ) is a city and municipality in the Pristina District in Kosovo. Podujevë is the largest municipality of Kosovo since it covers and is located along a regional motorway and also has railroad passing through it, which links the area to surrounding regions. Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, is located some to the south. 

According to the 2024 census, the municipality has 71,018 inhabitants. The city&#x27;s population may be higher, as these figures include only the population of the cadastral area of Podujevë, but not some urban neighborhoods of the city that are outside the cadastral area. According to the directorate of urban planning and environmental protection, about 31,417 residents live in the urban area, while about 57,082 residents in rural areas.

== History ==

=== Antiquity ===
Llap Region, which Podujevë is part of, was inhabited early due to favorable natural conditions. Even though many monuments documenting antiquity have disappeared, some still remain. Such documents are archeological sources such as: foundations of forts, cemeteries, tiles, weapons as well as various denominations. 
The oldest inhabitants of Llapi were the Dardanians as an Illyrian tribe. The first settlements were built near the rivers. Economic branches were: hunting, animal husbandry, etc. During the Roman occupation, this area suffered a lot of damage, especially the fortified parts. An important center of this time was Vendenisi (now Gllamniku).In the year 395, this territory falls under the rule of the Byzantine Empire.

=== Middle Ages ===
Towards the end of the 9th century, the region of Llapi falls under Bulgarian rule, whose king was Knyaz Boris I. At the end of the 12th century and the beginning of the 13th century Byzantine rule weakened. The region includes many Medieval Serbian monuments. In 1355, Emperor Stefan Dušan gave the village of Braina to Mount Athos. In 1381, Prince Lazar gave Orlane (a village in Podujevë) to his endowment, the Ravanica monastery. Ruins of old Serbian monasteries and churches exist at Orlane, Murgula (destroyed in the 15th century), Palatna, Slatina, Svetlje, Rakinica, Metohija (2), Donje Ljupce (destroyed in the 15th century), Gornja Pakastica (destroyed in the 15th century), Brevnik, Braina (3) and graveyards exist in most of these villages. The village of Brevnik had a notable medieval mine, and a fort with a church. Albanians are cited in the middle of the 14th century as miners and farmers while Albanian toponyms have been recorded in the area since the 15th century.

=== Ottoman period ===
Podujevë remained under Ottoman Rule from 1455 to 1912. Podujevë was initially organized as a Nahije, and it was the largest one of Vushtrria. During the 15th to 18th centuries, Ottomans attempted to develop agriculture, farming, vineyards, beekeeping and handicrafts within the region. Mining activities were also present, especially in Bellasica, which was recognized as one of the most important mining areas in the Balkans.

In the defter of jizya in 1485, Llapi had 5,952 Christian families, while in 1488-1489 Llapi had 7,399 households. In the 18th century the Nahije of Llapi was part of Pristina&#x27;s Sanjak. At this time, Llapi lost many residents due to two plagues that struck the place. During the Austro-Ottoman war, the Austrian army destroyed and robbed the town twice. Later, the region fought against the Ottomans. During the first Serbian Revolt, the Serbian army got into the village of Reçica and killed 30 people, including Demë Ahmeti, an Albanian national hero who is later mentioned in songs. This happened on 28 June 1811, during the feast of Eid.

A rebellion against the Ottomans arose when Sultan Abdulmejid I proclaimed the Tanzimat reforms in 1839, which increased taxes and brought about many rebellions in Albanian-populated lands. The population of Llapi fought against these reforms and, during 1843, the Ottomans temporarily left Llapi to organize its reoccupation. The rebels gathered many soldiers from the surrounding regions and they beat the Ottomans, taking Pristina and encouraging a bigger rebellion in other regions. The rebellion was extinguished in 1847.

When Serbia acquired the Sanjak of Nis in 1877, many Albanians were expelled from their homes in Nis and the surrounding regions, and Llapi was one of their first destinations as they sought refuge in Kosovo. There is not a single village in Podujevë where Muhaxhirs or migrants cannot be found. Furthermore, they established new villages.

The Albanians of Llapi, since the League of Prizren, refused to pay taxes to the Ottomans. The Ottomans built a military cantonment during 1892 and 1899 as they detected Serbian Army movements near the border.
The Albanian rebellion against Ottomans during 1906 was primarily organized in the Llapi region. Another Albanian rebellion was that of 1910 which also started in the Llapi region. The relationships between the residents and The Sublime Porte were becoming very strained and when Sulltan Mehmed Reshid V came to visit Kosovo and very few Llapi residents were present. Llapi is also known for its cooperation with Isa Boletini, who, during 1911, operated around this zone. Many soldiers from the villages of Llapi and Gallapi promised their loyalty to Isa Boletini in 1912, in the Bradash pledge. Their goal was to initiate the general Albanian rebellion against Ottoman Rule and they were part of the rebellion until it ended.

=== 1912 until World War I ===
When the neighbouring countries formed the Balkan League, Albanians felt at risk of being subjugated to these nations. Serbian forces engaged the border region where 16,000 Albanians were placed. The largest battle was fought in Merdare and lasted three days, where the Serbian army had up to 70.000 soldiers. Soon they took Merdare and the war continued in other fronts. From that time on, the region remained under Serbian control. Llapi remained a region of Pristina. In 1913, Llapi numbered 27,081 residents, while 10 years beforehand, 38,520 residents were present. On 20 August 1914, Serbia announced a decree in which the colonisation of its newly acquired territories was planned. This, and the process of disarmament of the local population, were key factors to the rise of the Kaçak guerilla movement.

=== World War I and World War II ===
During the First World War, most of the Serbian army, led by the Serbian king Peter I, retreated through the Llapi region. During the retreat, war crimes (including robbing, killing and destruction of property) took place. Llapi was later taken by Bulgaria, which, from time to time, organized grain and cattle requisition. Starting from 1916, any people were deported and sent to work in different countries, most of them never returning. After the Bulgarian surrender, Bulgarian soldiers killed a lot of people and robbed many places during their retreat. Albanians would later form their own military formations for a short period of two months.

The region fell to Yugoslavian Kingdom. In the beginning, the Llapi region had 12 municipalities with 27.084 residents. Later, the number of municipalities was reduced. From 1929 to 1941, Podujevë was part of the Morava Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia; between the two World Wars, Albanians living in the region had no political rights. They were poor and heavily taxed, and corruption was evident in the administration. The main problem, however, was colonization, which Yugoslavia claimed to be agricultural reforms. The Albanian language was not used at all in public administration and schools, Many residents were forced to migrate to Turkey, while their land was given to Serbian and Montenegrin colonists who would eventually take 62% of infields. Even mosques were controlled by the state.

Armed resistance was mostly pushed by Kaçak movements since it was impossible to organize large groups of people. They managed to expel the Serbian colonists, but the consequences were far greater, as in the beginning of 1921 many massacres against the Albanian population would occur. In Sharban, 35 people were killed and 28 houses were burned. In Bellopoja, 40 people were killed and 57 houses were damaged. In Keqekolla, 490 people were killed and 40 houses were burned. In Prapashtica, 1011 people were killed and 80 houses were burned, in Nishevc, 150 heads of cattle were robbed. In Orllan, 14 people were killed, in Kushevica over 12 people were killed, in Repë over 12 people were killed, and in Popovë 573 people were killed and 55 houses were burned. In Velikoreka, 2 houses were burned, while in Gerdoc 27 people were killed and 2 houses were burned. In Lupç, 11 people were killed, and in Lepaja, 5 houses were burned. Justin Godard, at the Paris Peace Conference defended “the rights of life for the Albanian population.”.

From 1912 to 1918, around 8,000 Albanians were forced to leave their lands to migrate to Turkey, while during 1920–1924,280 Albanian families were also forced to leave. In contrast, 420 Slavic families were settled in the territory between 1920 and 1928,
and by 1932, 3,474ha of land were given to colonists and 756 houses were built.

During World War II, Llapi was taken by the German army. The residents of Llapi did not submit to Serbian conscription and fled to the mountains. Germany captured Podujevë with an army including two tanks. Under the German administration, this region was called Llapi&#x27;s nenprefektura. 

Albanians requested that the authorities unify Albanian-inhabited regions under one administration, but this did not occur. During that time, all of Llapi had 42,942 residents. At the end of World War II, Serbia, Germany and Bulgaria were struggling for control of the town. There were greater numbers of military troops around Podujevë than there were residents. The residents later fled to Pristina in a 5 km convoy during October 1944. Earlier, the Germans gave Jahja Fusha authority of the town. 5,000 Albanian soldiers fought to protect the town against Serbians and Bulgarians alike. The fighting ended on 8 November 1944, after a long battle. The residents were required to come back to the town, and afterwards, some 500 men were killed without trial. 10 places are recorded to be mass graveyards. Starting from December 1994, Albanians were conscripted and sent to fight in other part of Yugoslavia.

=== Serbian Rule ===
After World War II, the Llapi region was under Serbian Rule. Serbian administration collected 11,297,067 dinars under the guise of it being a punishment for the illegal enrichment of some locals.
During 1950–1955, the Yugoslav authorities founded many directorates. When the constitution of 1963 was approved, the municipalities were in a better situation.
In 1966, Podujevë had 58,604 citizens. These improvements were ruined by Serbian authorities in 1990. Prior to this, Yugoslavia&#x27;s five-year plan of 1981-1985 did not offer a viable solution to the economic problems of the region&#x27;s residents.
During 1981–1991, 51 ethnic Albanian soldiers were wrongfully murdered during their service in the Yugoslavian army. In 1981, demonstrations were organized in Pristina, which was later followed by massive demonstrations all around Kosovo. The town of Podujevë was locked down at this time, except for the Medical Center. The route near the border was blocked, and so was the route to Pristina. Some local police were shot while driving tanks. Thousands of people were imprisoned.

Under Serbian control, Albanians were organized into several political parties such as “NDSh”, or Albanian National Democratic Party, the Albanian Youth National Democratic Committee, The Albanian League and others. Demonstrations were organized in March 1989 and 1990. During this period, many workers were fired from their jobs and funding for educational institutions was halted. This continued for a while, but Albanians had organized private funds themselves so that the education process would not stop. During 1989–1997, 22 people were killed in the region. These actions motivated the Albanian populations to resolve their societal disputes. During 1990–1992, 114 bloodfeud issues and 60 other disputes were resolved.

In the 20th of March 1990, Podujevë was the site of the first affected school from the student poisoning attack that took place in Kosovo. Around 8,000 students were poisoned from this incident.

One of the founders and the first commanders of the Kosovo Liberation Army, Zahir Pajaziti, was born in Podujevë. He and his associates began the first actions against Serbian police, before he was caught in an ambush near the village of Pestovë, resulting in his death.

==== Kosovo War ====
During the Kosovo War (February 1998 – June 1999), the town was the site of the Podujevë massacre, on March 28, in which 14 Kosovo Albanian women and children were executed by Serbian paramilitary forces. Serbian forces reportedly were continuing to burn villages east and southeast of this town as of April 5. Serbian forces allegedly executed 200 Kosovar Albanian men of military age. In addition, Serbian forces reportedly removed ethnic Albanians from their cars and shot them on the spot. Ninety percent of the buildings in the town reportedly have been burned. On April 19, Serbian forces allegedly used ethnic Albanians as human shields along the road between Podujevë and Pristina. 

The city was part of the subdivision of Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), called &quot;ZOLL&quot; (). This city became a battleground during the conflict, in which the Battle of Podujevë was fought. The battle ended in a ceasefire called on by foreign forces.

The road coming into Podujevë from the city of Niš was the site of the 2001 Podujevë bus bombing, in which a bus carrying Serb pilgrims traveling to the Gračanica monastery site was bombed. Twelve Serb pilgrims were killed and dozens more were injured by the bomb-blast. Kosovo Albanian extremists have been blamed for the attack.

After the Kosovo War, the process of establishing a Municipal Assembly began in 2002. Later, on 17 February 2008, Kosovo declared its independence.

== Geography ==

Podujevë is located in the northeastern part of Kosovo and it is closely connected to the surrounding regions through a network of regional motorways and railways. Just 31 kilometers (19 miles) to the south lies Pristina, the capital of Kosovo. To the west, Podujevë shares its borders with Obiliq, Vushtrri, Mitrovica and Leposaviq, while its northern and eastern borders share a border with Serbia. 

Podujevë consists of Llapi&#x27;s Hollow and the Albanik mountains in the west, and eastern Kosovo&#x27;s mountains in the east. Llapi&#x27;s valley is placed between the village of Repa and that of Barileva with a 35 km distance and between Batllavë and Llapashticë e Epërme with 12–15 km. Llapi&#x27;s jaw is located between Repë and Murgull (14 km) and from Bellasica to Uglar&#x27;s Cape (14 km). Gallapi is placed between Batllavë and Metergoc in latitude and from Turuçicë to Koliq in longitude.

Highest point of Podujevë is located in the Kopaonik Mountains, while the lowest is , and is located where the Llapi River leaves Podujevë&#x27;s border to continue in Pristina&#x27;s municipality. Since its territory is compact, it represents a microgeographical entirety. 

=== Hydrology ===

Podujevë counts several ravines, water springs and rivers. The most notable river is Llapi, the main branch of Sitnica, which runs through the middle of Podujevë, springing from the Albanik mountains. The source of Llapi considered to be the Pollatë village where the rivers of Murgulla and Sllatinë are joined. In the upper part of it, the river runs through steep places but when it enter Llap&#x27;s hollow, its speed is moderated. Llapi river is long up to Sitnica river while most of the river passes through Podujevë&#x27;s territory, in a length. This river is wide from 9 to 12 meters and deep up to 1.2 meters. The river brings an average of per second, however, there are considerable variations with the maximum going up to per second.

There are other rivers also. Dumnica river is long and fills 87 km2 and it is used for irrigating. Kaqanolli river is Llapi&#x27;s most important right branch and it is long, filling 193.6 km2. The Batllava River fills 315 km2 and it also flows into Llapi. 

In 1965 a dam high was built in order to form an artificial lake — Batllava Lake, which can handle up to 40 million m3 of water and was primary built for KEK needs, to be used later for consuming purposes.

=== Climate ===

Podujevë has a medium continental climate. The climate is influenced by microclimatic factors that give some small specifics to this space. Among the microclimatic factors, the most important are the Llapi field and the mountains that surround it from all sides. The effect of mountains is that they have more precipitation, lower temperatures, snow stays longer, are covered with forests, etc. So, Podujevë is somewhat colder than in other cities of Kosovo. The average temperature in Podujevë is 9.6 ̊C. The amplitude is 64.2 ̊C.

The annual rate of precipitation is lower than that of Kosovo () with of raining per year. The most humid month is May with and the driest month is March with . The average snow fall days are 26 while days with snow mantle are 48.4. The maximum layer of snow is recorded to be , while the month with a maximum of snow mantle days is February with 11.7 days. The length of the day in Podujevë varies significantly over the course of the year. In 2022, the shortest day is December 21, with 9 hours, 1 minute of daylight; the longest day is June 21, with 15 hours, 21 minutes of daylight.

=== Flora and Fauna ===

Podujevë counts 29,050 acres of forests most of which are located in the western and northern part of its territory. 17,600 ha are under state control and the rest (11,450) are under private control. Since the woods remain the main warming option of Kosovars, degradation and wood cuts remain a challenge. The trees which are found in this zone include: beech (fagus sylvatica), hornbeam (carpinus orientalis) and ash-tree. In alluvial lands osier and poplar may be found but other trees are found also. There may be found bushes such as cornel bush (Cornus Mas), haw (crataegus monogyna), canker-rose (rosa canina), elder (sambocus nigra), gooseberry (prunus spicosa), hazelnut (corylus avellana) etc. 

Fauna has many species that are not only characteristic of these areas. In the forests live: gray wolf, wild boar, fox, European hare, European hedgehog, etc. Recently, not only in this area, the roe deer has started to appear, which was once quite widespread. There are many species of birds such as the great tit, the rock dove, the great spotted woodpecker, the Eurasian magpie, the common cuckoo, etc. Birds of prey that live are the golden eagle and the common kestrel. And some of the migratory birds are swallows, storks etc.

The grass snake (natrix natrix), horned viper (vipera ammodytes), boletus (tropidonatus natrix), vineyard snail (helix pomatia), common turtle (testudo hermanni) live in the rivers. There are several types of fish, in the Llapi River also, in the upper part it was once quite rich with brook trout (barbus barbus) that lives in fast and cold waters, stream catfish, bream, mullet, bream, carp (cyprinus carpio), northern pike (esox lucius) etc.

=== Natural Monuments ===

In Podujevë, there are a number of natural monuments which were recognized as valuable resources. The list includes:

==Demographics==
The municipality of Podujevë has 70,975 inhabitants according to the 2024 census, compared to 88,499 in 2011. In the same year, the urban population numbered 23,453 citizens and the rural 65,046.
Also in 2011, the highest population density was in the city of Podujevë, where it numbered 2,635/km². Several other settlements also had high density, such as Letanc (660/km²), Obrançë (529/km²), Surkish (500/km²), Llugë (444/km²), Gllamnik (405/km²) and others. The settlements with the lowest population density were Rakinicë (3/km²), Tërnavicë (4/km²) and Metergoc (5/km²), while Muhazob, Përpellac and Reçicë recorded no permanent population.

The town has a low ratio of internal migration but a high rate of commuting. The illiteracy rate is lower than 5%. The average years of schooling is 9.0-9.2. The labor force is smaller than 40.1% of the population, with an employment rate of 20.1% and unemployment of 45-51%. The average household size numbers 6-7 people.

== Economy ==

The biggest expansion on the economy of Podujevë occurred during the 1980s. At that time, there were 16 social organizations that have developed their economic activities, with altogether 2,500 employees. The beginning of the 1990s is characterized with a growing of private businesses, in particular in trade and services. During the war of 1999 all of these businesses were destroyed by Serbian military forces, so the period of renewal was long and difficult. After the Kosovo war, the private sector was the main bearer of economical development with a continual growth. According to the Businesses Office, there are around 3,972 registered businesses, mostly in trade section.

=== Agriculture ===

Podujevë is mostly a rural area. Podujevë has extraordinary resources regarding the agriculture field, since there are sufficient lands and water. Historically, the agriculture was cultivated only for family needs, as it has been considered as a secondary sector, but recently it has begun to be used also for other needs and requests, which could be beneficial and profitable. 

Other relevant sectors which belong to the agriculture, are: farming, beekeeping, poultry, vegetable, arboriculture, land cultivation, and so forth. Podujevë is especially known for cultivating raspberries, as the climate is perfect for its growth. About 56% is arable land used for agriculture. Pastures make up 16% of the agricultural land and the rest is used for vegetables, orchards, vineyards, etc.

<text>The Mutton Birds were a New Zealand rock music group formed in Auckland in 1991 by Ross Burge, David Long and Don McGlashan, with Alan Gregg joining a year later. Four of their albums reached the top 10 on the New Zealand Albums Chart, &quot;The Mutton Birds&quot; (1992), &quot;Salty&quot; (1994), &quot;Envy of Angels&quot; (1996) and &quot;Rain, Steam and Speed&quot; (1999). They had a number-one hit with &quot;The Heater&quot; (1994), while their two other top 10 singles were a cover of &quot;Nature&quot; by the Fourmyula (1992), and an original, &quot;Anchor Me&quot; (1994). From 1996 to 2000 the group were based in England; they returned to New Zealand and then disbanded in 2002.

==History==

David Long on guitars and Don McGlashan on lead vocals and bass guitar formed the Mutton Birds in Auckland as a three-piece rock group in early 1991. For their first live performance, on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, they used an interim drummer who was soon replaced by Ross Burge. McGlashan had been a member of Blam Blam Blam (1982, 1984) and the Front Lawn (1985–1993), Long had played in the Six Volts and appeared on the Front Lawn&#x27;s albums. Burge had been a member of the Spines and Sneaky Feelings, and early on, he was drumming both for Dribbling Darts (1989–1993) and the Mutton Birds. In 1992, the three-piece band gained Alan Gregg, also from Dribbling Darts, on bass guitar.

As a four-piece they recorded their first self-titled album. It peaked at No. 2 on the New Zealand Albums Chart in September 1992, and was certified platinum in New Zealand. It was in the top 50 for 52 non-consecutive weeks. They gained notice outside college radio for their cover version of &quot;Nature&quot; (August 1992), which reached No. 4 on the related singles chart. The original was recorded by the Fourmyula in 1969 (written by keyboardist Wayne Mason), and in 2001 was voted as New Zealand&#x27;s greatest song of the previous 75 years.

They signed with EMI Australia, which financed their second studio album, &quot;Salty&quot; (April 1994). This was self-produced and mixed by American producer-engineer Tchad Blake (Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, Crowded House). It reached No. 3 and was certified platinum in New Zealand. &quot;Salty&quot; provided a number-one hit single, &quot;The Heater&quot;, in April, and top 10 position for &quot;Anchor Me&quot; (October). McGlashan won an APRA Silver Scroll song writing award for the latter hit. Their next album, &quot;Nature&quot; (September 1995), was a compilation of tracks selected from their first two albums with additional production by Neil Finn (of Crowded House), via Virgin Records for the United Kingdom market. 

Their third studio album, &quot;Envy of Angels&quot;, was recorded in Wales and released in November 1996, with Hugh Jones producing (the Bluetones, Dodgy, Echo and the Bunnymen). It peaked at No. 4 in New Zealand. The band moved to London where they remained until 2000. During 1996 the Mutton Birds contributed a cover version of Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s 1976 single, &quot;(Don&#x27;t Fear) The Reaper&quot;, to the soundtrack of Peter Jackson&#x27;s film &quot;The Frighteners&quot;. Their version reached the ARIA Singles Chart top 50 early in the following year. By that time Long had already returned to New Zealand and he was replaced on guitar by New Zealand-born, British-based Chris Sheehan (of the Starlings).

In 1997 the band played concerts in Canada as part of the Another Roadside Attraction festival tour. They established their own label, Gravy Train Records, and issued two limited-release albums, &quot;Angle of Entry&quot; (an acoustic live album) in late 1997 and &quot;Too Hard Basket&quot; (subtitled &quot;B-sides and Bastards&quot;, a compilation of contained rarities) in 1998. In mid-1998 Gregg left and was replaced by English-born Tony Fisher on bass guitar and keyboards. The group&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Rain, Steam and Speed&quot; (February 1999), appeared on shhh! Records. Another live album, &quot;Live in Manchester&quot;, was issued before their 2000 UK tour, during which their line-up was augmented by ex-Garageland guitarist, Andrew Claridge.

For the New Zealand and Australian tour in October–November 1999, Burge&#x27;s former band mate Matthew Bannister (Sneaky Feelings, Dribbling Darts) was added to the line-up. The group returned to New Zealand in 2000. A greatest hits compilation, &quot;Flock&quot;, was released in 2002 but they disbanded by mid-year. In 2012 the Mutton Birds temporarily reunited with the line-up of Burge, Gregg, Long and McGlashan, to play at New Zealand wineries in February and early March. Another live album from that tour, &quot;Free Range: The Mutton Birds Live 2012&quot;, was issued in November.

<text>West Coast Council is a local government body in Tasmania, covering much of the western region of the state. West Coast is classified as a rural local government area and has a population of 4,167. The major towns and localities of the region include Strahan, Rosebery, Zeehan and the principal town of Queenstown.

==History and attributes==
The West Coast has a rich mining and railway heritage as well as a historic convict settlement. It is the largest of the 29 Tasmanian councils by area, and the second least densely populated, after the Central Highlands. It takes in the West Coast Range as well as portions of the World Heritage areas.

The region experiences relatively extreme weather conditions, notably high yearly rainfall totals due to frontal systems, especially at Lake Margaret and Mount Read.

West Coast is classified as rural, agricultural and medium (RAM) under the Australian Classification of Local Governments.

===History===
Local government in Western Tasmania evolved from locality based councils created in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries:

: Gormanston Municipal Council (1907–1986) - became part of the Lyell Council
: Lyell Municipal Council (1986–1993)
: Queenstown Municipal Council (1907–1986) - became part of the Lyell Council
: Strahan Municipal Council (1907–1993)
: Zeehan Municipal Council (1907–1993)

On 2 April 1993, the municipalities of Lyell, Strahan and Zeehan were amalgamated to form the West Coast Council.

Historically the region was more oriented towards the North - due to the main transport being by either rail to Burnie up until the 1950s and 1960s, or by ship out of Strahan until the mid twentieth century. There were no land based transport routes to the south. Consequently, many residents who could afford shopping trips would go to Melbourne in Victoria, rather than Hobart in Tasmania.

Some of the small population is located in the small cluster of towns near Macquarie Harbour - Strahan and Queenstown, these were linked in their connection with the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company

While further north Zeehan and Rosebery are settlements that developed from early quite separate mining operations, but were linked by their reliance upon the Emu Bay Railway
There a number of ghost towns or abandoned mining communities in the West Coast, with some such as Crotty actually submerged under hydro-electric scheme dams.

==Councillors==
As of the 2022 Tasmanian Local Government elections, the council consists of the following members:

<doc id="777462" wikidata="Q2927095" url="?curid=777462" title="Neuroblast">
<text>In vertebrates, a neuroblast or primitive nerve cell is a postmitotic cell that does not divide further, and which will develop into a neuron after a migration phase. In invertebrates such as &quot;Drosophila,&quot; neuroblasts are neural progenitor cells which divide asymmetrically to produce a neuroblast, and a daughter cell of varying potency depending on the type of neuroblast. Vertebrate neuroblasts differentiate from radial glial cells and are committed to becoming neurons. Neural stem cells, which only divide symmetrically to produce more neural stem cells, transition gradually into radial glial cells. Radial glial cells, also called radial glial progenitor cells, divide asymmetrically to produce a neuroblast and another radial glial cell that will re-enter the cell cycle.

This mitosis occurs in the germinal neuroepithelium (or germinal zone), when a radial glial cell divides to produce the neuroblast. The neuroblast detaches from the epithelium and migrates while the radial glial progenitor cell produced stays in the lumenal epithelium. The migrating cell will not divide further and this is called the neuron&#x27;s birthday. Cells with the earliest birthdays will only migrate a short distance. Those cells with later birthdays will migrate further to the more outer regions of the cerebral cortex. The positions that the migrated cells occupy will determine their neuronal differentiation.

==Formation==
Neuroblasts are formed by the asymmetric division of radial glial cells. They start to migrate as soon as they are born. Neurogenesis can only take place when neural stem cells have transitioned into radial glial cells.

===Differentiation===
Neuroblasts are mainly present as precursors of neurons during embryonic development; however, they also constitute one of the cell types involved in adult neurogenesis. Adult neurogenesis is characterized by neural stem cell differentiation and integration in the mature adult mammalian brain. This process occurs in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and in the subventricular zones of the adult mammalian brain. Neuroblasts are formed when a neural stem cell, which can differentiate into any type of mature neural cell (i.e. neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, etc.), divides and becomes a transit amplifying cell. Transit amplifying cells are slightly more differentiated than neural stem cells and can divide asymmetrically to produce postmitotic neuroblasts and glioblasts, as well as other transit amplifying cells. A neuroblast, a daughter cell of a transit amplifying cell, is initially a neural stem cell that has reached the &quot;point of no return.&quot; A neuroblast has differentiated such that it will mature into a neuron and not any other neural cell type. Neuroblasts are being studied extensively as they have the potential to be used therapeutically to combat cell loss due to injury or disease in the brain, although their potential effectiveness is debated.

===Migration===
In the embryo neuroblasts form the middle mantle layer of the neural tube wall which goes on to form the grey matter of the spinal cord. The outer layer to the mantle layer is the marginal layer and this contains the myelinated axons from the neuroblasts forming the white matter of the spinal cord. The inner layer is the ependymal layer that will form the lining of the ventricles and central canal of the spinal cord.

In humans, neuroblasts produced by stem cells in the adult subventricular zone migrate into damaged areas after brain injuries. However, they are restricted to the subtype of small interneuron-like cells, and it is unlikely that they contribute to functional recovery of striatal circuits.

==Clinical significance==
There are several disorders known as neuronal migration disorders that can cause serious problems. These arise from a disruption in the pattern of migration of the neuroblasts on their way to their target destinations. The disorders include, lissencephaly, microlissencephaly, pachygyria, and several types of gray matter heterotopia.

== Neuroblast development in &quot;Drosophila&quot; ==
In the fruit fly model organism &quot;Drosophila melanogaster,&quot; a neuroblast is a neural progenitor cell which divides asymmetrically to produce a neuroblast and either a neuron, a ganglion mother cell (GMC), or an intermediate neural progenitor, depending on the type of neuroblast. During embryogenesis, embryonic neuroblasts delaminate from either the procephalic neuroectoderm (for brain neuroblasts), or the ventral nerve cord neuroectoderm (for abdominal neuroblasts). During larval development, optic lobe neuroblasts are generated from a neuroectoderm called the Outer Proliferation Center. There are more than 800 optic lobe neuroblasts, 105 central brain neuroblasts, and 30 abdominal neuroblasts per hemisegment (a bilateral half of a segment).

Neuroblasts undergo three known division types. Type 0 neuroblasts divide to give rise to a neuroblast, and a daughter cell which directly differentiates into a single neuron or glia. Type I neuroblasts give rise to a neuroblast and a ganglion mother cell (GMC), which undergoes a terminal division to generate a pair of sibling neurons. This is the most common form of cell division, and is observed in abdominal, optic lobe, and central brain neuroblasts. Type II neuroblasts give rise to a neuroblast and a transit amplifying Intermediate Neural Progenitor (INP). INPs divide in a manner similar to type I neuroblasts, producing an INP and a ganglion mother cell. While only 8 type II neuroblasts exist in the central brain, their lineages are both much larger and more complex than type I neuroblasts. The switch from pluripotent neuroblast to differentiated cell fate is facilitated by the proteins Prospero, Numb, and Miranda. Prospero is a transcription factor that triggers differentiation. It is expressed in neuroblasts, but is kept out of the nucleus by Miranda, which tethers it to the cell basal cortex. This also results in asymmetric division, where Prospero localizes in only one out of the two daughter cells. After division, Prospero enters the nucleus, and the cell it is present in becomes the GMC.

Neuroblasts are capable of giving rise to the vast neural diversity present in the fly brain using a combination of spatial and temporal restriction of gene expression that give progeny born from each neuroblast a unique identity depending both their parent neuroblast and their birth date. This is partly based on the position of the neuroblast along the Anterior/Posterior and Dorsal/Ventral axes, and partly on a temporal sequence of transcription factors that are expressed in a specific order as neuroblasts undergo sequential divisions.

<text>Pepsi Twist is a lemon flavored cola, marketed by PepsiCo as an alternative to regular Pepsi.

==History==
The first incarnation of Pepsi Light was cola and lemon flavor with 50% fewer calories. It was soon replaced with lemon-flavored diet cola of the same name in the 1970s and 1980s in the United States called Pepsi Light, which was lemon-flavored by necessity to counteract the aftertaste of the artificial sweetener saccharin. When aspartame became more widely available, the lemon flavoring was removed from the newly rechristened Diet Pepsi.

Pepsi Twist was introduced in the United States on July 12, 2000 and again on June 12, 2001, until it was discontinued in the summer of 2006. 
===International Availability===
Pepsi Twist was launched in the United Kingdom by Britvic in July 2002, being the first launch of a Pepsi brand variant in the UK since Pepsi Max in 1993. The drink was soon discontinued in the UK, with Britvic announcing a similar drink for their Pepsi Max range - Lemon and Lime Twist, in November 2004.

Pepsi launched Pepsi A-ha, with a lemon flavor in India in 2002.

Pepsi Twist was released in Brazil (with lime instead of lemon), where a limited-edition version was also sold, the Pepsi Twistão, with an even stronger lime flavor. 

It has also been released in Portugal as a limited edition during summer, and has remained popular.

In the Philippines, it was released in 2002, and was an instant hit among the teenagers, but failed to capture the market.

Pepsi Twist was also released in Pakistan in 2006. The product failed to capture the market, but it is still available in some supermarkets.

It is marketed in Romania under the name Pepsi Twist Lemon. It was sold under the name of Pepsi Twist until recently, and its diet counterpart, Pepsi Twist Light Lemon.

It is available in Albania, Greece and China, and selected supermarkets in Germany. 

It was introduced in Poland in the summer of 2002 and in Italy in late 2002. It is still a fairly popular drink in the former.

It was also released in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the late 2006. It is still available today, and it outsells the original Pepsi.

In the Netherlands and Belgium, the original Pepsi Twist was sold for a while, and was replaced by Pepsi Max Twist, a &quot;lemon and lime&quot; version, which has also been discontinued. It has since been returned under the &quot;Pepsi Max Cool Lemon&quot; brand.

In Ukraine, Pepsi Twist was released in 2004. In 2012, it was reintroduced under the &quot;Pepsi +1&quot; logo and &quot;Pepsi-Twist&quot; trade name.

Pepsi Twist made a brief return in the summer of 2008, with the NFL Kickoff Limited Edition Flavor, which boasted that it was Pepsi &quot;with a kick of lemon.&quot;

In Czech Republic and Slovakia, Pepsi Twist was introduced in 2002, its diet counterpart Pepsi Twist Light was introduced in January 2003. Both versions are still being sold.

In Latvia, Pepsi Twist was introduced in late 2011.

In Poland, ten years after Pepsi Twist was introduced, PepsiCo decided to introduce Pepsi Light Lemon.

In Cyprus, Pepsi Twist was introduced at the start of 2014.

In Argentina, it went on sale in 2002, the following year &quot;Pepsi Twist Light&quot; was launched, until it was withdrawn from the market in 2004. At the end of 2023 they announced its return as &quot;Pepsi Twist Black&quot;.

In Uruguay, Pepsi Twist was first launched in 2005. Ten years later, it was reintroduced in a limited edition in September 2015.

In July 2017, it was brought back as a limited time offer in Canada.

==Marketing==
The product was advertised during Super Bowl 2003, with Ozzy, Jack and Kelly Osbourne appearing in the commercial, along with Florence Henderson and Donny and Marie Osmond and Gareth Gates

It was also endorsed by pop singer Britney Spears in 2002 and 2003, as part of her contract with the company; it also appeared as a promotional tie-in with &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot;.

The product appears to be no longer actively marketed and does not appear on the list of brands on Pepsi&#x27;s official website. Pepsi Twist production was ended in the U.S. during the summer of 2006, however the drink is still available in Poland, Germany, Italy, Serbia, China and some other nations.

In 2005, Japanese toy company Takara released a special edition Transformers Optimus Prime (known as &quot;Convoy&quot; in Japan) figure in Pepsi colours, with a bottle/can holding trailer. Known as &quot;Pepsi Convoy&quot;, this figure comes pre-packaged with a cardboard Pepsi Twist bottle. This figure was later released two years later in America as &quot;Pepsi Optimus Prime&quot;, with some slight modifications.

In 2008, the product was briefly re-introduced before the American football season, but was in short supply.

Professional wrestler CM Punk dubbed one of his signature moves the Pepsi Twist.

=== Mascots ===
In 2002 a pair of lime mascots (although referred to as lemons) were created for a TV commercial in Brazil dubbed by actors and comedians Lúcio Mauro Filho and Bruno Mazzeo, involving a style of acid humor. The popularity of the commercials involving the characters led to them becoming brand mascots, often returning to appear together every time the brand was relaunched and sometimes also appearing printed on the cans.

In 2007, plush toys of the characters were distributed through a campaign called &quot;Toma que o Limão é seu&quot; (&quot;Take the Lemon, it&#x27;s yours&quot;). The plushes were distributed again in 2014 in another promotion.

In 2016 a female lime (referred to as &quot;limoa&quot;) appeared in a commercial being voiced by singer Anitta. The characters also appeared in a collaboration with the Ruffles brand for the launch of Ruffles&#x27; lemon flavor.

In 2018 another mascot was created for the limited ginger flavor also sold under the Pepsi Twist brand, called Gengibrão.

<text>Engineering geology is the application of geology to engineering study for the purpose of assuring that the geological factors regarding the location, design, construction, operation and maintenance of engineering works are recognized and accounted for. Engineering geologists provide geological and geotechnical recommendations, analysis, and design associated with human development and various types of structures. The realm of the engineering geologist is essentially in the area of earth-structure interactions, or investigation of how the earth or earth processes impact human made structures and human activities.

Engineering geology studies may be performed during the planning, environmental impact analysis, civil or structural engineering design, value engineering and construction phases of public and private works projects, and during post-construction and forensic phases of projects. Works completed by engineering geologists include; geologic hazards assessment, geotechnical, material properties, landslide and slope stability, erosion, flooding, dewatering, and seismic investigations, etc. Engineering geology studies are performed by a geologist or engineering geologist that is educated, trained and has obtained experience related to the recognition and interpretation of natural processes, the understanding of how these processes impact human made structures (and vice versa), and knowledge of methods by which to mitigate hazards resulting from adverse natural or human made conditions. The principal objective of the engineering geologist is the protection of life and property against damage caused by various geological conditions.

The practice of engineering geology is also very closely related to the practice of geological engineering and geotechnical engineering. If there is a difference in the content of the disciplines, it mainly lies in the training or experience of the practitioner.

==History==
Although the study of geology has been around for centuries, at least in its modern form, the science and practice of engineering geology only commenced as a recognized discipline until the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The first book titled Engineering Geology was published in 1880 by William Penning. In the early 20th century Charles Peter Berkey, an American trained geologist who was considered the first American engineering geologist, worked on several water-supply projects for New York City, then later worked on the Hoover Dam and a multitude of other engineering projects. The first American engineering geology textbook was written in 1914 by Ries and Watson. In 1921 Reginald W. Brock, the first Dean of Applied Science at the University of British Columbia, started the first undergraduate and graduate degree programs in Geological Engineering, noting that students with an engineering foundation made first-class practising geologists. In 1925, Karl Terzaghi, an Austrian trained engineer and geologist, published the first text in Soil Mechanics (in German). Terzaghi is known as the parent of soil mechanics, but also had a great interest in geology; Terzaghi considered soil mechanics to be a sub-discipline of engineering geology. In 1929, Terzaghi, along with Redlich and Kampe, published their own Engineering Geology text (also in German).

The need for geologist on engineering works gained worldwide attention in 1928 with the failure of the St. Francis Dam in California and the death of 426 people. More engineering failures that occurred the following years also prompted the requirement for engineering geologists to work on large engineering projects.

In 1951, one of the earliest definitions of the &quot;Engineering geologist&quot; or &quot;Professional Engineering Geologist&quot; was provided by the Executive Committee of the Division on Engineering Geology of the Geological Society of America.

==The practice==
One of the most important roles of an engineering geologist is the interpretation of landforms and earth processes to identify potential geologic and related human-made hazards that may have a great impact on civil structures and human development. The background in geology provides the engineering geologist with an understanding of how the earth works, which is crucial minimizing earth related hazards. Most engineering geologists also have graduate degrees where they have gained specialized education and training in soil mechanics, rock mechanics, geotechnics, groundwater, hydrology, and civil design. These two aspects of the engineering geologists&#x27; education provide them with a unique ability to understand and mitigate for hazards associated with earth-structure interactions.

==Scope of studies==
Engineering geology investigation and studies may be performed:
*for residential, commercial and industrial developments;
*for governmental and military installations;
*for public works such as a stormwater drainage system, power plant, wind turbine, transmission line, sewage treatment plant, water treatment plant, pipeline (aqueduct, sewer, outfall), tunnel, trenchless construction, canal, dam, reservoir, building foundation, railroad, transit, highway, bridge, seismic retrofit, airport and park;
*for mine and quarry developments, mine tailing dam, mine reclamation and mine tunneling;
*for wetland and habitat restoration programs;
*for government, commercial, or industrial hazardous waste remediation sites;
*for coastal engineering, sand replenishment, bluff or sea cliff stability, harbor, pier and waterfront development;
*for offshore outfall, drilling platform and sub-sea pipeline, sub-sea cable; and
*for other types of facilities.

==Geohazards and adverse geological conditions==
Typical geologic hazards or other adverse conditions evaluated and mitigated by an engineering geologist include:
*fault rupture on seismically active faults;
*seismic and earthquake hazards (ground shaking, liquefaction, lurching, lateral spreading, tsunami and seiche events);
*landslide, mudflow, rockfall, debris flow, and avalanche hazards;
*unstable slopes and slope stability;
*erosion;
*slaking and heave of geologic formations, such as frost heaving;
*ground subsidence (such as due to ground water withdrawal, sinkhole collapse, cave collapse, decomposition of organic soils, and tectonic movement);
*volcanic hazards (volcanic eruptions, hot springs, pyroclastic flows, debris flow, debris avalanche, Volcanic gas emissions, volcanic earthquakes);
*non-rippable or marginally rippable rock requiring heavy ripping or blasting;
*weak and collapsible soils, foundation bearing failures;
*shallow ground water/seepage; and
*other types of geologic constraints.

An engineering geologist or geophysicist may be called upon to evaluate the excavatability (i.e. rippability) of earth (rock) materials to assess the need for pre-blasting during earthwork construction, as well as associated impacts due to vibration during blasting on projects.

==Soil and rock mechanics==

Soil mechanics is a discipline that applies principles of engineering mechanics, e.g. kinematics, dynamics, fluid mechanics, and mechanics of material, to predict the mechanical behaviour of soils. Rock mechanics is the theoretical and applied science of the mechanical behaviour of rock and rock masses; it is that branch of mechanics concerned with the response of rock and rock masses to the force-fields of their physical environment. The fundamental processes are all related to the behaviour of porous media. Together, soil and rock mechanics are the basis for solving many engineering geology problems.

==Methods and reporting==
The methods used by engineering geologists in their studies include
*geologic field mapping of geologic structures, geologic formations, soil units and hazards;
*the review of geologic literature, geologic maps, geotechnical reports, engineering plans, environmental reports, stereoscopic aerial photographs, remote sensing data, Global Positioning System (GPS) data, topographic maps and satellite imagery;
*the excavation, sampling and logging of earth/rock materials in drilled borings, backhoe test pits and trenches, fault trenching, and bulldozer pits;
*geophysical surveys (such as seismic refraction traverses, resistivity surveys, ground penetrating radar (GPR) surveys, magnetometer surveys, electromagnetic surveys, high-resolution sub-bottom profiling, and other geophysical methods);
*deformation monitoring as the systematic measurement and tracking of the alteration in the shape or dimensions of an object as a result of the application of stress to it manually or with an automatic deformation monitoring system; and
*other methods.
The fieldwork is typically culminated in analysis of the data and the preparation of an engineering geologic report, geotechnical report or design brief, fault hazard or seismic hazard report, geophysical report, ground water resource report or hydrogeologic report. The engineering geology report can also be prepared in conjunction with a geotechnical report, but commonly provides the same geotechnical analysis and design recommendations that would be presented in a geotechnical report. An engineering geology report describes the objectives, methodology, references cited, tests performed, findings and recommendations for development and detailed design of engineering works. Engineering geologists also provide geologic data on topographic maps, aerial photographs, geologic maps, Geographic Information System (GIS) maps, or other map bases.

<text>Rongelap Atoll (Marshallese: , ) is an uninhabited coral atoll of 61 islands (or motus) in the Pacific Ocean, and forms a legislative district of the Ralik Chain of the Marshall Islands. Its total land area is . It encloses a lagoon with an area of . It is historically notable for its close proximity to US hydrogen bomb tests in 1954, and was particularly devastated by fallout from the Castle Bravo test. The population asked the US (several times) to move them from Rongelap following the test due to high radiation levels, but with no success; so they asked global environmental group Greenpeace to help. The Rainbow Warrior made three trips moving the islanders, their possessions and over 100 tons of building materials to the island of Mejato in the Kwajalein Atoll, 180 kilometers away.

==History==
The Marshall Islands, of which Rongelap Atoll is a part, were first settled by Micronesians.

The first sighting recorded by Europeans was by Spanish navigator Álvaro de Saavedra on 1 January 1528. Together with Utirik, Ailinginae and Toke atolls, they were charted as &quot;Islas de los Reyes&quot; (Islands of the Three Wise Kings in Spanish) due to the proximity of Epiphany. Fourteen years later it was visited by the Spanish expedition of Ruy López de Villalobos.

Rongelap Atoll was claimed by the German Empire along with the rest of the Marshall Islands in 1885. After World War I, the island came under the South Seas Mandate of the Empire of Japan. The base became part of the vast US Naval Base Marshall Islands. Following the end of World War II, Rongelap came under the control of the United States as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.

== Nuclear testing impact ==

=== Time line ===

1946: United States Navy evacuates Bikini Atoll Islanders prior to nuclear weapons tests.

March 1, 1954: United States detonates 15-megaton hydrogen bomb (Castle Bravo test) allegedly unaware that fallout will reach Rongelap. 

March 3, 1954: US evacuates Rongelap inhabitants to Kwajalein Atoll. Islanders have vomiting, diarrhea, skin burns, and some later experience hair loss. They were suffering from acute radiation syndrome.

1955-1957: Internally displaced Rongelapese inhabitants repeatedly request permission from the US Government to return to their atoll.

1957: Atomic Energy Commission declares Rongelap safe for re-habitation. US scientists note: &quot;The habitation of these people on the island will afford most valuable ecological radiation data on human beings.&quot;

1958: Rates of Rongelap miscarriages and stillbirths twice the rate of unexposed women.

1963: First thyroid tumors begin to appear.

1971: Independent Japanese medical team invited by Rongelap magistrate denied permission to visit by US citing &quot;visa problems.&quot;

1976: Report finds 69% of Rongelap children who were under 10 in 1954 have developed thyroid tumors. 

1984: Marshall Islands senator Jeton Anjain requests evacuation assistance from Greenpeace because the US denies the senator&#x27;s requests for evacuation.

1985: &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; makes three trips to evacuate the Rongelap community to Mejato and Ebeye islands in Kwajalein Atoll.

1986: Nuclear test compensation approved, setting aside a $US150 million trust fund.

1989: United States Department of Energy determines Rongelap safe for habitation.

1994: Independent scientific study finds that depending on dietary restrictions, 25 to 75% of Rongelap population would exceed the 100 mrem maximum annual exposure limit set.

2000: Marshall Islands government submits Change of Circumstances petition asking for significantly more compensation than the $US150m.

2005: Bush Administration determines it has no legal responsibility to provide additional nuclear test compensation.

2007: The Nuclear Claims Tribunal awards Rongelap more than $1 billion as fair damages for its land damage claim, however, since the $US150m trust fund is almost completely depleted this compensation can never be paid.

2012: United States government (Barack Obama administration) reasserts its position that it has satisfactorily compensated Rongelap victims.

===The tests===

From 1946 through 1958 the United States military conducted numerous atmospheric nuclear weapons tests, including hydrogen bomb tests, primarily at Bikini Atoll, about from Rongelap Atoll. On March 1, 1954, the testing of the Castle Bravo hydrogen device produced an explosion that was 2½ times more powerful than predicted, and produced unexpected amounts of fallout that resulted in widespread radioactive contamination. The mushroom cloud contaminated more than of the surrounding Pacific Ocean including some of the then inhabited surrounding islands including Rongerik Atoll, Rongelap Atoll ( away) and Utirik Atoll.

Irradiated debris fell up to deep over the island. A United States military medical team visited the island with geiger counters the day after the fallout, but left without telling the islanders of the danger they had been exposed to. Virtually all the inhabitants experienced severe radiation sickness, including itchiness, sore skin, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue. Their symptoms also included burning eyes and swelling of the neck, arms, and legs. The inhabitants were forced to abandon the islands, leaving all their belongings, three days after the test. They were relocated to Kwajalein for medical treatment. Six days after the Castle Bravo test, the U.S government set up a secret project to study the medical effects of the weapon on the residents of the Marshall Islands.

The United States was subsequently accused of having used the inhabitants in medical research (without receiving consent) to study the effects of nuclear exposure. Until that time, the United States Atomic Energy Commission had given little thought to the potential impact of widespread fallout contamination and health and ecological impacts beyond the formally designated boundary of the test site.

===Failed return to the atoll===

In 1957, three years later, the United States government declared the area &#x27;clean and safe&#x27; and allowed the islanders to return, though they were told to stick to canned foods and avoid the northern islets of the atoll. Evidence of continued contamination mounted, however, as many residents developed thyroid-tumors, and many children died of leukemia. The magistrate of Rongelap, John Anjain, whose own son died of leukemia, appealed for international help, without significant response.

=== Relocated by Greenpeace ===

In 1984, Marshall Islands senator, Jeton Anjain approached the environmental group Greenpeace to seek their help in relocating the people of Rongelap and in 1985, &#x27;Operation Exodus&#x27; took place. In three trips, the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; moved approximately 350 people and of building material. to the islets of Mejato and Ebeye on Kwajalein atoll, approximately away. The operation took 10 days, moving everyone from 80-year-olds to newborns, as well as their homes and belongings. Ebeye is significantly smaller than the islands of Rongelap, and joblessness, suicide, and overcrowding have proven to be problems following the resettlement.

=== Compensation awarded ===

In September 1996, the United States Department of the Interior signed a $45 million resettlement agreement with the islanders, stipulating that the islanders themselves will scrape off a few inches of Rongelap&#x27;s still contaminated surface. However, this is an operation deemed impossible by some critics. In recent years, James Matayoshi, the mayor of Rongelap, claimed that the cleanup was successful and envisioned a new promising future for the inhabitants and for tourists. Scientific measurements made in August 2014 verified a safe level of radiation on Rongelap.

=== Aftermath ===
In 1991, the People of Rongelap and Jeton Anjain received the Right Livelihood Award &quot;for their steadfast struggle against United States nuclear policy in support of their right to live on an unpolluted Rongelap island.&quot;

In 2019 Chinese investor Cary Lan leased a large part of the atoll for a proposed special economic zone, in what was seen as part of ongoing efforts by China to expand its reach into the Pacific and conduct chequebook diplomacy against Taiwan. After his arrest in Thailand in 2020, the project was abandoned. He was deported to the United States in 2022 for allegedly bribing elected officials in this case. 

==Education==
Marshall Islands Public School System operates Mejatto Elementary School, which serves descendants of the community in Mejatto that resided in Rongelap Atoll.

<text>&quot;Seemann&quot; (&quot;Seaman&quot;/&quot;Sailor&quot;) is a song by German band Rammstein, released as the second single from their album &quot;Herzeleid&quot;. It was composed by bass player Oliver Riedel, with lyrics by Till Lindemann.

The video shows Christoph Schneider, Oliver Riedel, Paul Landers and Richard Kruspe pulling a boat through the sand, with Till Lindemann and Flake, who&#x27;s wearing a plague doctor mask, inside. Later, they decide to keelhaul Lindemann, still singing. The boat winds up in flames. The video is intertwined with shots of a woman, alternately dressed in a white robe and black clothing.

==Track listing==
# &quot;Seemann&quot; – 4:48
# &quot;Der Meister&quot; – 4:10
# &quot;Rammstein in the House (Timewriter-RMX)&quot; – 6:26

==Live performances==

The first known performance of the song is from the New Year&#x27;s Eve 1994–1995 concert in Saalfeld, Germany. In the &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; tour, during this song, Flake usually sat in a small inflatable boat and sailed over the crowd who waves and bring the boat back to the stage after a short tour. This stunt is now performed in &quot;Ausländer&quot; instead of Seemann.

Never played in the &quot;Mutter&quot; or &quot;Reise, Reise&quot; tours, &quot;Seemann&quot; was probably last played on 23 June 1999 in Los Angeles, California. Ten years later the song returned only on a few concerts during the &quot;Liebe ist für alle da Tour&quot;. Seemann returned as a constant song for the &quot;Festival Tour&quot; of 2016 and 2017.

==Cover versions==
&quot;Seemann&quot; was covered by Finnish cello metal band Apocalyptica and featured Nina Hagen on the band&#x27;s album, &quot;Reflections&quot;. It was released as a single on 6 October 2003. It was mixed and recorded by Mikko Raita. The song was also covered by Rummelsnuff along with a music clip.

<text>Milorad B. Protić (; 19 September 1911, Belgrade – 29 October 2001, Belgrade) was a Serbian astronomer, discoverer of comets and minor planets, and three times director of the Belgrade Observatory.

== Life and work ==
Protić finished a technical secondary school in 1921 and worked as a technical draftsman until 1931. He joined the Belgrade Observatory in 1932, while in 1936 he started observations of minor planets, comets, and satellites, which have been continuously performed until the present-day.

Protić is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 7 numbered asteroids during 1936–1952, including 1675 Simonida, named after queen Simonida, wife of medieval Serbian king Stefan Milutin, and 2348 Michkovitch, a rare Erigone asteroid named after Vojislav Mišković (1892–1976), who was a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts and head of the Belgrade Observatory. Protić also independently discovered comet C/1947 Y1.

Protić died on 29 October 2001 in Belgrade. The main-belt asteroid 22278 Protitch, discovered by Henri Debehogne at ESO&#x27;s Chilean La Silla site in 1983, was named in his memory. Naming citation was published on 30 December 2001 ().

Also, the outer main-belt asteroid 1724 Vladimir is named after Protić&#x27;s grandson Vladimir Benišek, while 5397 Vojislava is named after Vojislava Protić-Benišek, his daughter, who has been a member of the observatory&#x27;s staff since 1972, where she continues her father&#x27;s work on celestial mechanics and minor planets, together with her son.

<text>AS-103 was the third orbital flight test of a boilerplate Apollo spacecraft, and the first flight of a Pegasus micrometeoroid detection satellite. Also known as &quot;SA-9&quot;, it was the third operational launch of a two-stage Saturn I launch vehicle.

==Objectives==
Of 12 flight objectives assigned, two were concerned with the operation of the Pegasus satellite, eight with launch vehicle systems performance, one with jettisoning the launch escape system, and one with separation of the boilerplate spacecraft. The satellite objectives were (1) demonstration of the functional operations of the mechanical, structural, and electronic systems and (2) evaluation of meteoroid data sampling in near-Earth orbit. Since the launch trajectory was designed to insert the Pegasus satellite into the proper orbit, it differed substantially from the trajectory used in missions AS-101 and AS-102.

==Launch==
The launch vehicle consisted of an S-I first stage, an S-IV second stage, and an instrument unit. The spacecraft consisted of a boilerplate command and service module, a launch escape system, and a service module/launch vehicle adapter (BP-16). The Pegasus 1 satellite was enclosed within the service module, attached to the S-IV stage. The orbital configuration consisted of the satellite mounted on the adapter, which remained attached to the instrument unit and the expended S-IV stage.

The vehicle was launched from Cape Kennedy Launch Complex 37B at 9:37:03 a.m. EST (14:37:03 GMT) on February 16, 1965. A hold of 1 hour and 7 minutes was caused by a power failure in the Eastern Test Range flight safety computer. A built-in hold of 30 minutes was also used to discharge and recharge a battery in the Pegasus satellite as a check that it was functioning properly.

The launch was normal, and the spacecraft was inserted into orbit approximately 10.5 minutes after launch. The launch escape system was jettisoned during launch and the command module was jettisoned after orbital insertion. The Pegasus satellite weighed approximately and was . The width of the deployed wings was . The total mass placed in orbit was . The perigee was , the apogee was , and the orbital inclination was 31.76°.

==Results==
The trajectory and space-fixed velocity were very nearly as planned. The Apollo shroud separated from the Pegasus satellite about 804 seconds after lift-off, and deployment of two meteoroid detection panel wings of the Pegasus satellite commenced about 1 minute later. The predicted useful lifetime of Pegasus A in orbit was 1188 days. The satellite was commanded off (decommissioned) on August 29, 1968. Although minor malfunctions occurred in both the launch vehicle and the Pegasus A satellite, mission AS-103 was a success in that all objectives were met. The spacecraft remained in orbit until July 10, 1985, when it re-entered the atmosphere and landed in the ocean.

<text>Zamzam(, &quot;Zemzem&quot;, formerly Zamzam Cola) is a brand of soft drink produced in Iran by Zamzam Group. The director of the Zamzam Group is Ahmad-Haddad Moghaddam. Zamzam Group is owned by the Mostazafan Foundation.

==History==
Originally a subsidiary of Pepsi created in Iran in 1954 as the first Iranian carbonated soft drink producer owned by Habib Sabet. Following the Islamic revolution in 1979, the company was taken from its original owner without compensation and the name was changed to ZamZam. 

Following the 2002 boycott of Coca-Cola by Saudi Arabia, Zamzam was unofficially dubbed the soft drink of the Hajj. The product&#x27;s name is a reference to the Well of Zamzam in Mecca, which is one of the stops on the Islamic pilgrimage of the Hajj.

<doc id="777616" wikidata="Q992010" url="?curid=777616" title="Kowal (town)">
<text>Kowal is a town in Włocławek County, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland, with 3,478 inhabitants (2004).

==History==

Kowal was the birthplace of Casimir III the Great, the last Polish King from the Piast dynasty. It was a royal town of the Kingdom of Poland, administratively located in the Brześć Kujawski Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province.

During the German occupation of Poland (World War II), Kowal was one of the sites of executions of Poles, carried out by the Germans in 1939 as part of the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;. In 1940, the German gendarmerie carried out expulsions of Poles, who were deported to a transit camp in Łódź and then to the General Government in the more-eastern part of German-occupied Poland, while their houses, shops and workshops were handed over to German colonists as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy.

==Transport==
The town is located on Poland&#x27;s most important north–south highway, National Road 1 (DK1). The town bypass for this road was opened in December, 2007, allowing heavy traffic to avoid the town center. The A1 motorway passes just to the northeast of the town.

==Sports==
Its local association football team is Kujawiak Kowal.

==Notable people==
The town is the birthplace of 
* Casimir III, (1310–1370), King of Poland, 1333 to 1370.
* Max Kowalski (1882—1956) a German composer, singer and singing teacher.
* Dominik Jędrzejewski (1886–1942) martyred Roman Catholic priest
* Jan Nowicki (1939-2022) Polish actor, famous for his role as János in Márta Mészarós &quot;Diaries&quot; trilogy movies

<doc id="777623" wikidata="Q2511363" url="?curid=777623" title="Seger Ellis">
<text>Seger Pillot Ellis (July 4, 1904 – September 29, 1995) was an American jazz pianist and vocalist. He also made a few brief film appearances, most notably in collaboration with director Ida Lupino.

==Life and career==
He was born in Houston, Texas, United States. Ellis began his career as pianist playing live for a local Houston radio station (later known as KPRC) in the early 1920s. In 1925, he was added to the orchestra of Lloyd Finlay for a &quot;field trip&quot; recording session for Victor Records, and was also allowed to cut two piano solos. Although unissued for technical reasons, these solo efforts led to Ellis being invited to Victor&#x27;s regular recording studio in Camden, New Jersey, to cut a number of piano solos, all or most of them compositions of his own. These were among the earliest records Victor made using the new electric microphone and recording equipment; a technique that was yet not perfected, which probably explains why only four of the titles were eventually issued. Of these the coupling &quot;Prairie Blues&quot; and &quot;Sentimental Blues&quot; became a minor hit.

After his first recording experiences, Ellis returned to Houston and radio work as well as playing in vaudeville theaters. During this period Ellis, mainly on request of his employers at the radio station, began adding singing to his piano playing. His pleasant voice went well with the audiences and, in 1927, he was invited to New York City to make vocal test recordings. His first issued vocal record was &quot;Sunday&quot; on the Columbia label. This was followed by a string of records for Okeh Records, where Ellis was usually backed by small studio groups, that he was allowed to pick himself. Ellis used the opportunity to select many of the best jazz musicians of the time, including Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, Joe Venuti, Eddie Lang, Andy Sannella and - on two occasions - Louis Armstrong. On these records, Ellis sang in a bittersweet alto, with which he was uncomfortable early in his career, believing his voice to be too high. Ellis was popular enough during the time he was on OKeh for them to create a special silver colored custom label for his records.

Ellis&#x27;s first recording career ended in 1931. In the late 1930s however, he returned with a big band of his own, known as his &quot;Choirs of Brass Orchestra&quot; with himself conducting and taking occasional vocals. The band also featured his wife, Irene Taylor, as a vocalist. Later in his career, Ellis focused more on song writing, although he continued to record sporadically as well as playing the piano.

In 1939, Ellis reorganized and his new band featured the conventional four-man reed section. He disbanded in 1941, and was enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces in 1942.

After moving back to Texas, he began to be less active as a performer and more involved in songwriting. Among his many compositions were &quot;My Beloved Is Rugged&quot; and &quot;11:60PM&quot; (both recorded by Harry James), &quot;Gene&#x27;s Boogie&quot; (recorded by Gene Krupa), and &quot;Little Jack Frost, Get Lost&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re All I Want for Christmas&quot; (both recorded by Bing Crosby). &quot;December&quot; was recorded by Count Basie with a Mills Brothers vocal. The Seger Ellis songwriting catalog also includes &quot;No Baby, Nobody But You&quot; and &quot;You Be You But Let Me Be Me&quot;.

Seger Ellis gradually retired and took up residence in Houston, where he died in a retirement home, on September 29, 1995.

<text>A tent city is a temporary housing facility made using tents or other temporary structures.

State governments or military organizations set up tent cities to house evacuees, refugees, or soldiers. UNICEF&#x27;s Supply Division supplies expandable tents for millions of displaced people.

Informal tent cities may be set up without authorization by homeless people or protesters.

Tent cities set up by homeless people may be similar to shanty towns, which are informal settlements in which the buildings are made from scrap building materials.

Shoddy and lower-condition tent cities may be considered skid rows or a facet of them.

==Military==

In the military, the term &quot;tent city&quot; usually refers to temporary living quarters erected on deployed military bases, such as those found in Bosnia and Herzegovina or Iraq. Depending on the branch of service and the length of time the tent city has been in place, the living space may be equipped with most modern amenities. For sanitary reasons, military tent cities place toilet, shower, and laundry facilities at least from living quarters. Also, tents are typically divided into clusters of 8–10 to prevent the rapid spread of fire, which is of utmost concern because of the tent and bedding materials.

==Environmental disasters==
Since Hurricane Katrina made landfall in August 2005, the term has been used to describe temporary housing sites set up for Gulf Coast residents who were left homeless by the storm. Some of the tents that were built by Seabees and funded by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are wooden structures covered by tents. With the exception of indoor plumbing, most of the tents have heat, air, and lights. The tent city can hold as many as 250 occupants. Displaced residents are only expected to stay for three to six months.

==Homeless people==

===Canada===
====Toronto, Ontario====
Toronto, Ontario, Canada&#x27;s largest city, was also home to its own &quot;Tent City&quot; until September 2002, when the residents of Tent City were evicted by the owner of the property, Home Depot. It was situated in the downtown core of Toronto, near the waterfront, and was home to hundreds of people who were homeless. Toronto introduced rent supplement programs in the following year (2002–2004) by which 115 residents were given access to mainstream apartment units. Journalist Shaughnessy Bishop-Stall voluntarily abandoned his middle-class lifestyle to live in Tent City for a year. He detailed his experiences in his 2005 book, &quot;Down to This: Squalor and Splendour in a Big-city Shantytown&quot;. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the city also witnessed a revival of tent cities in its public parks. 

===United States===

Full-time tent living can be a way to save money, but it has some challenges. One of the main ones is finding an appropriate location and community. An alternative to tents that has gained popularity in the 21st century is tiny or mobile tiny homes. These homes were utilized for disaster relief housing following Hurricane Katrina in 2006, showcasing the advantages of tiny homes over traditional tents. In the 21st century, while the estimated absolute number of homeless people has decreased, tent cities have increased in large cities. Tent cities have also formed from mass protests and are not always related to homelessness.

Some cities have sponsored tent cities publicly to cut down on homelessness, while in other cases, informally formed tent cities have been torn down by cities.

====Philadelphia, Pennsylvania====

Tent cities have long been a part of Philadelphia&#x27;s history. The steadily growing number of encampments has been passed down by multiple civil administrations—from Wilson Goode (1984–1992) to the present-day&#x27;s Cherelle Parker (2024–present). The collection of encampments developed for multiple reasons. Some started as contained protests for affordable housing; others were attempts to establish secure living through a developed community.  

When assessing the number of homeless people in Philadelphia, the Office of Homeless Services counted 958 people on the streets. Non-profit organizations like Project H.O.M.E. have made efforts to help by &quot;providing housing, opportunities for employment, medical care, and education to homeless and low-income persons&quot;.  
====Camp Hope: Las Cruces, New Mexico====
Camp Hope is an alternative transitional living project for people experiencing homelessness through camping. It is located on the Mesilla Valley Community of Hope (MVCH) campus and is an alliance of agencies that address homelessness in Las Cruces, New Mexico. The tent city can house 50 people who would otherwise be on the streets, providing them with a safe place to seek direct services, healthcare, jobs, and housing. Camp Hope has allowed people without housing to be right next to all the services the agencies on the MVCH campus provide. The camp was founded in November 2011 with temporary permission from Las Cruces. It was supposed to disband in March 2012, but no funding was available to build another shelter and the City Council stated that the tent city benefited the city.

In 2013, with help from engineering students from New Mexico State University, the site was rezoned as a planned unit development that sanctioned a permanent campground along with a number of other uses on the non-profit&#x27;s campus.

====Second Chance Village: Akron, Ohio====
This service club, made up of homeless and formerly homeless members, was founded by Ryan Scanlon and operated its tent city operations in the rear of private property owned by Sage Lewis LLC in the Middlebury area of Akron, Ohio from January 2017 until January 2019. It was known as Second Chance Village and remains a nonprofit service club organization in secret locations splintered amongst the cityscape.

Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2018, Mitch Smith wrote about the village, describing a homeless-run culture wherein people experiencing homelessness created a drug-free, alcohol-free community with security officers and a democratically elected tri-council. All services were run by people experiencing homelessness, including a laundry, showers, a computer lab, a clothing room, and a food pantry.

Akron City Council rejected Mr. Lewis&#x27;s request for a zoning exception on an 8-to-4 vote in September 2018.

All tents were forced to be removed by January 5, 2019.

====California====

Homelessness in California is a serious issue, if going by the per capita rate in 2020 of homelessness, which ranks third in the US behind New York and Hawaii. 0.4% or more of Californians are homeless, and most major cities have homeless populations hovering around 0.5–1% of the city&#x27;s population. This includes both sheltered and unsheltered homeless. Tent cities are prevalent in Tenderloin, San Francisco, and Skid Row, Los Angeles.

The BBC ran a news story in 2008 about the then-crisis in the US economy that forced many Americans, who used to own their own homes, to live in tents.

AlterNet published a story in 2009 about the mainstream media finally &quot;discovering&quot; the homeless situation in Sacramento.

====Minneapolis, Minnesota====

Minneapolis experienced the emergence and growth of homeless encampments in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd and resulting unrest in mid-2020. The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board had an experimental process to permit homeless encampments on city park property. Homeless encampments appeared at 44 park sites during the summer months. The park board closed all camps on January 7, 2021, and discontinued permits.

====St. Petersburg, Florida====
In late December 2006, homeless people formed an impromptu tent city on the St. Vincent de Paul property in the 1400 block of Fourth Avenue N in Saint Petersburg, Florida, when dozens of homeless moved off of public land across the street. In early January 2007, city officials noted city codes that prohibit living in tents and gave the owners one week to evict the occupants of the tent city.

====Olympia, Washington====
Camp Quixote, a homeless encampment, began as a protest movement of homeless people and homeless advocates against criminalizing &quot;anti-social&quot; legislation that was passed by the city in January 2007—specifically referring to the ordinance restricting people from sitting on sidewalks. City officials ordered the camp to disband. The Olympia Unitarian Universalist Congregation offered the encampment sanctuary on its property, being familiar with the Seattle faith-based network of homeless encampments. What began as a protest surrounding homelessness quickly became a faith community protest. The religious community protested the city&#x27;s insistence on dismantling the homeless encampment on the grounds that churches maintain a specific land use right that allows them to offer sanctuary to the poor (Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act). Eventually, the adversarial protest turned to negotiation with local municipalities, with new ordinances condoning Camp Quixote with specific regulations and a 90-day limit and an option to move to other faith communities&#x27; property.

====Seattle, Washington====

Homeless people have long resorted to seeking shelter in tents, but such communities are one of the first known to be organized by a sponsoring organization (a partnership between the Seattle Housing and Resource Effort and Women&#x27;s Housing Equality and Enhancement League (SHARE/WHEEL)) and are one of the first in a major U.S. city to be largely accepted by local governments. Contrary to some stereotypes regarding the homeless, many residents of Tent City are employed, mostly in temporary or day labor jobs, but have insufficient income to obtain more permanent housing.

The original Tent City and Tent City 2, created in the late 1990s, were created illegally and opposed by the City of Seattle. After being tolerated for some time, they were eventually forced to shut down. In March 2002, as a result of a legal battle, city attorney Tom Carr and SHARE/WHEEL attorney Ted Hunter signed a court-ordered consent decree with SHARE, allowing Tent City only on private land (by invitation) and setting standards for its operation.

Based on the consent decree, Tent City 3 was created and rotates around the Metro Seattle Core. Tent City 4 was created in May 2004 as an attempt to expand beyond the consent decree and use public land and resources, something the consent decree does not allow. This attempt was unsuccessful, and Tent City 4 has since been relocated to eastern King County, where it is church sponsored. Tent City rules do not allow drug or alcohol use and evicts anyone caught stealing or committing other crimes within the camp. Tent City 3 stayed an average of three weeks at each encampment before 2004, while Tent City 4 stayed in place for as long as 100 days. Since then, Tent City 3&#x27;s stays have averaged between 60 and 90 days, with 90 days or so being a common length of stay. Cities have been adopting code amendments that limit stays to 60–90 days.

Another homeless encampment, unaffiliated with Tent City 3 and 4, lived in donated, mainly fuchsia, tents at the University Congregational United Church of Christ in Seattle&#x27;s University District for several months ending March 5, 2009. At that time, it moved to the suburb of Bryn Mawr south of Seattle. According to homeless advocates, residents criticized Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels for continuously clearing out homeless encampments, and named their encampment &quot;Nickelsville&quot;. Out of respect for Mayor Nickels&#x27;s recent efforts, the church did not use the &quot;Nickelsville&quot; name in referring to the encampment.

While on the road in Seattle, Washington, on March 30, 2009, Democracy Now! covered a story about Seattle&#x27;s Nickelsville. They also covered a story about the police raid on Nickelsville the previous day, March 29, where 24 people were arrested.

====King County, Washington====
Tent City 4 (TC4) is a homeless encampment of up to 100 people created in May 2004 in eastern King County outside of Seattle. Residents are adult men and women, although there is a provision for quartering minor dependents in emergencies.

====Transition Park, Camden, New Jersey====
A community of 50 to 150 people had taken up residence in Camden, New Jersey, nestled on the right side of the I676 West exit 5A ramp. Although attempts have been made to find housing for the population, no one has been placed. Transition Park&#x27;s Mayor and City Council continued to protect their community and seek medical attention for those in need. In May 2010, residents were forced out of the city and into local missions.

Under the leadership of Amir Khan, the pastor of Solid Rock Worship Center in Clementon, NJ, and founder of the Nehemiah Group, a faith-based nonprofit organization that Khan and his son Micah run, 54 residents of Tent City were moved to the Wingate by Wyndham Hotel in Mount Laurel in May 2010 with the help of volunteers. Pastor Khan asked his congregation and local business members for help and raised $250,000 to provide some homeless people of Camden&#x27;s Tent City with housing and human services for at least one year.

Although these homeless men and women were initially moved to a hotel and received a spa treatment upon arrival, months later, drugs and alcohol are taking a toll on their adjustment to life in their new environments. On the positive side, Lorenzo Banks, the ex-self-appointed Mayor of Tent City, and James Boggs, another Tent City leader, got jobs providing homeless outreach for Volunteers of America-Delaware Valley in Collingswood, NJ. Although several people also enrolled in community college, mental illness, addiction issues, and a lack of affordable housing illustrates the roadblocks to a healthy life for Tent City residents over the long term.

By September 13, 2010, 19 of the original 54 were removed from the &quot;hotel program&quot; and many former Tent City residents continue to move from one street corner or overpass to another, continuing the homelessness issue in Camden.

====Potomac Mills, Woodbridge, Virginia====
Since 2003, there exists a tent city at Potomac Mills in Woodbridge, Virginia, adjacent to the Potomac Mills mall. The private landlord tolerates it. In 2018, part of the residents were directed to leave.

==Events==
=== 1913 Gettysburg reunion ===

At the 1913 Gettysburg reunion, the United States Department of War set up a tent city that housed over 50,000 Civil War veterans.

===Hajj===

The Saudi Arabian government&#x27;s Ministry of Hajj has set up a permanent tent city to house Muslim pilgrims in Mina, where the ritual Stoning of the Devil takes place as part of the overall Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. A tent city is also set up at Mount Arafat, another essential stop during the Hajj. Because up to four million pilgrims may be performing the Hajj annually, the tent cities are densely inhabited with 20–40 people per tent. As such, fire and disease outbreaks were constant concerns. Since the late 1990s, Saudi authorities have started using fireproof tents to reduce the risks of a major fire.

===Klondike and Nome Gold Rushes===
During the Klondike Gold Rush in Alaska and Canada 1896–1899 several tent camps were built along the routes to the gold fields especially on the popular Dyea/Skagway route where it met Lake Bennett and Lake Lindeman the head of Yukon River. At the Nome Gold Rush, between 1899 and 1909, a tent city sprung up that was 30 miles long, on the beaches and on the treeless coast of Nome, Alaska between Cape Rodney and Cape Nome.

===Great Depression===
During the Great Depression a number of tent cities and shanty towns named Hoovervilles emerged in the United States and some other countries on the outskirts of towns, newspapers used as covers were referred to as “Hoover blankets.”

===Persepolis===
For the festivities of the 2,500 year celebration of Iran&#x27;s monarchy the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, built a luxurious tent city in the desert next to the ruins of Persepolis to accommodate his international guests. The event took place October 12–16, 1971. The tent city was inspired by the tent city of the Field of the Cloth of Gold meeting between Francis I of France and Henry VIII of England that took place in 1520.

==Other applications==
===Fayette County, Tennessee===
Tent City in Fayette County, Tennessee, United States, was an encampment for displaced blacks who were removed from their homes and blacklisted from buying amenities as retaliation for registering to vote in the early days of the Civil Rights Movement.

===West Virginia University===
Throughout the week of October 26 to November 1, 2014, hundreds of West Virginia University students camped out in &quot;Tent City&quot; prior to ESPN&#x27;s &quot;College GameDay&quot;.

===Kent State University===
On May 12, 1977, a tent city was erected and maintained for a period of more than 60 days by a group of several dozen protesters on the campus of Kent State University in Kent, Ohio, United States. The protesters, led by the May 4 Coalition but also including community members and local clergy, were attempting to prevent the university from erecting a gymnasium annex on part of the site where the Kent State shootings occurred in May 1970, which they believed would alter and obscure that historical event. Law enforcement finally brought the tent city to an end on July 12, 1977, after the forced removal and arrest of 193 people. The event gained national press coverage and the issue was taken to the U.S. Supreme Court.

===Music===
Chicago band Patience Gloria&#x27;s second album &quot;Consequences David&quot; has a song titled &quot;Tent City Nation&quot; that addresses the subject.

* Bolton Hall, activist who established a tent city in New York city in 1908

The area at music festivals for attendees to set up their tents for overnight stays is often called &quot;Tent City&quot;.

===Protests===

* Occupy movement was an international protest movement that featured tent cities set up in parks in some cities.

===Maricopa County Jail modification===

Prior to the election of Sheriff Joe Arpaio in 1993, the prisoner population in Maricopa County Jail, Arizona, the fourth largest jail system in the world, exceeded the maximum number of inmates allowed in its facilities. Prisoners were routinely released from custody prior to completing their sentence due to the overcrowding. In a study conducted in 1993 it was estimated that construction of a new facility would cost approximately $70,000,000. Sheriff Arpaio, concerned about the cost of a new facility and reasoning that military tents were good enough for the men and women of the U.S. armed forces who fought in the Gulf War, ordered that tent jails be constructed using inmate labor. It consisted of Korean War–era tents donated by the United States armed forces, and a observation tower with a vacancy sign mounted on the front. The final cost of the project was approximately $100,000 and it was capable of housing over 2,400 inmates. Tent City was closed in October 2017.

<text>Oswald West (May 20, 1873 – August 22, 1960) was an American politician, a Democrat, who served most notably as the 14th Governor of Oregon.

==Early life==
West was born in Guelph, Ontario, Canada but moved to Salem, Oregon with his family at the age of four where he attended school and eventually went into banking. After several years as a banker in Salem and Astoria, and a six-month stint searching for gold in Alaska, West gained an appointment as the State Land Agent. He proved effective in his position, recovering almost 1 million acres (4,000 km²) of fraudulently held state land.

In 1907, West left his position as Land Agent and was appointed to the Oregon Railroad Commission, where he again found a great deal of success.

== Governor of Oregon ==
In 1910, he gained the Democratic nomination for Governor and went on to defeat his opponent, Jay Bowerman, and take office in 1911. While in office, West defended what he called the Oregon System which included initiative and referendum systems still in use in many western American states today. Through these processes women&#x27;s suffrage, various workers rights laws and most famously prohibition all came into effect during West&#x27;s administration.

West established Oregon&#x27;s beach highway law, proclaiming the entire Pacific coastline to the high tide line to be a public highway, thereby preserving scenery and beach access for future generations. The law protecting public access to the high-water line remains in effect on Oregon beaches, which were formally protected by the Oregon Legislature and Governor Tom McCall in 1967 (HB 1601).

West is also credited with establishing Oregon&#x27;s highway system, when in 1913 the Oregon Highway Commission was created by the Oregon Legislative Assembly, levying a tax upon all property to fund the establishment of a state roadway system. The tax raised $700,000 during its first year, money which was targeted to the development of three major road routes — the Coast Highway (US-101), the Pacific Highway from Portland through the Willamette Valley, and the Columbia River Highway connecting Portland with Eastern Oregon.

He addressed a national convention of governors in New Jersey in 1911, on the topic of prison labor.

== Prohibition advocate ==
West was a fervent prohibitionist. He believed so strongly in the idea that he once declared martial law on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1913 in order to shut down liquor-selling establishments in the town of Copperfield, Oregon. He then dispatched National Guard troops, chaperoned by his own personal secretary Fern Hobbs on January 2, 1914 to enforce the order and shut down the saloons. The move made headlines across the country.

== Sterilization and emasculation advocate ==
Known for his moral reforms, West pushed the 1913 Oregon legislature to adopt its first eugenics law in response to the Portland Vice Scandal of 1912 involving the arrest of gay men in Portland, Oregon. West called for sterilization and emasculation of the &quot;degenerates who slink, in all their infamy, through every city, contaminating the young, debauching the innocent, cursing the State&quot; and others who would come before the state&#x27;s courts for similar sexual transgressions in the future.

== Reputation and legacy ==
Bend Mayor George P. Putnam criticized West in a &quot;New York Times&quot; interview shortly after the Copperfield affair. Putnam asserted that the Governor&#x27;s theatrical methods, and his inordinate attention to the affairs of local communities, detracted from the governance and national image of the state as a whole.

Oregon writer Stewart Holbrook described West as &quot;by all odds the most brilliant governor Oregon ever had.&quot;

West&#x27;s time as governor is still felt in Oregon today because of his work to protect the state&#x27;s natural resources. It was under his administration the beaches bordering the Pacific Ocean were protected for public use; the office of State Forester and the Bureau of Forestry were established; and the Fish Commission and Game Commission were created.

West served only one term, opting not to run for re-election in 1914. Instead, he moved his family to Portland where he practiced law. He was the Democratic party&#x27;s nominee for the United States Senate in 1918, but lost to Charles L. McNary. After the run he largely limited his involvement in politics to spirited letters to the editor but was an influential adviser to Governor Charles H. Martin in the 1930s. He retired from his law practice after suffering a heart attack in 1945.

West died in Portland on August 22, 1960, and is buried in the Mount Crest Abbey Mausoleum in Salem, Oregon.

Oswald West State Park on the Oregon Coast is named in his honor, as is West Hall, a student residence hall on the campus of Oregon State University.

<text>HMNZS &quot;Charles Upham&quot; (A02) was a Mercandian 2-in-1 class roll-on/roll-off vessel operated by the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) between 1994 and 2001. The vessel was built for the Danish shipping company Mercandia during the early 1980s, and operated under the names Mercandian Queen II and Continental Queen II. The New Zealand Defence Force had identified the need for a logistic support ship as early as the 1970s but it was not until the 1991 white paper that planning to acquire a ship commenced in earnest. &quot;Mercandian Queen II&quot; was for sale around that time, and although not as capable as the RNZN had initially specified, was purchased in 1994.

The ship arrived in New Zealand in 1995 under the name Sealift, and was commissioned later that year as HMNZS &quot;Charles Upham&quot;, after the only combat soldier to be awarded the Victoria Cross twice, Captain Charles Upham. After some modification, the ship made two voyages to test her capabilities and determine what further work was required to make her fully operational. Significant problems with stability and seakeeping were encountered during the second voyage, and the ship was removed from service on her return. The cost of fixing the stability problems and fitting &quot;Charles Upham&quot; out for troop and vehicle transport was prohibitive, and the work was postponed. In the meantime, the ship was chartered to Spanish company Contenemar SA in 1998 and used to transport citrus fruit around the Mediterranean.

By 2001, the New Zealand government had decided that &quot;Charles Upham&quot; was unusable and should be sold. The ship was sold to Contenemar (who operated her under the name Don Carlos, then Don Carlos II), then converted into a vehicle carrier and onsold in 2009 to Indonesian company PT Pelayaran Putra Sejati (operating as Nusantara Sejati). In the meantime, the RNZN sought to acquire a new logistic vessel, with entering service in 2007.

==Design and construction==
The vessel was one of 137 cargo vessels built by Danish shipping company Mercandia between 1964 and 1996 for their worldwide shipping fleet. The ship is of the Mercandian 2-in-1 class design, with a displacement of at light load, and at full load. She is long, with a beam of , and a draught of . The propulsion system consists of a MaK M 453AK diesel motor, which supplied to a single controllable-pitch propeller. This was supplemented by a bow thruster. Maximum speed was , and maximum range was at .

The ship had a two ramps for vehicle loading; one at the stern, the other on the starboard side. She was designed to carry up to of cargo. The crew complement was 17 strong, and the ship was fitted with two I-band navigational radars.

The vessel was built by Frederikshavns Værft in Frederikshavn, Denmark. Laid down as yard number 407, she was launched on 16 December 1983, and completed on 6 April 1984. The vessel was assigned the IMO Number 8131128.

==Operational history==

===Early civilian service===
The ship was built for and operated by Danish shipping company Mercandia, and was flagged as a Danish vessel. During her initial civilian career, the vessel operated under the name &quot;Mercandian Queen II&quot;, except for a period during 1992 when she was briefly named &quot;Continental Queen II&quot;.

===RNZN acquisition===
The RNZN began to identify the need for a logistic support ship in the 1970s. Such a ship would be used to support the defence and foreign policies of the New Zealand government, particularly in the South Pacific region by providing sealift for the New Zealand Army&#x27;s Ready Reaction Force (RRF), with secondary roles including disaster relief, civil defence, Antarctic supply, and United Nations operations. The 1978 Defence Review noted the need for such a vessel, with attention drawn back to the acquisition of such a ship in the 1987 Defence White Paper. A 1988 study indicated that the minimum requirement was a vessel able to transport 200 soldiers and equipment, and unload them either through beach landings or wharf facilities. The need for a transport vessel was again identified in the 1991 Defence White Paper, with such a vessel essential to meet the tasks specified for the New Zealand Defence Force in that document. A review subsequent to the 1991 White Paper proposed a less-capable vessel than previously, with the ship able to perform wharf landings only. As well as the transportation of soldiers, the ship was envisaged for use during civil emergencies in South Pacific nations to deliver supplies of extract New Zealand citizens, and to keep transport routes to New Zealand&#x27;s offshore islands, or across Cook Strait, if civilian services became restricted or unavailable. The review concluded that the acquisition of a mid-size roll-on/roll-off vessel for use as a military sealift ship should be prioritised; a Mercandian 1500-type vessel, capable of transporting 50% of the RRF&#x27;s vehicles and equipment, was seen as the minimum standard, although a larger vessel like &quot;Union Rotorua&quot;, almost able to deploy the entire RRF, was preferred.

&quot;Union Rotorua&quot; was the first ship considered for acquisition, with inspection beginning in November 1991, but after the New Zealand Defence Force began to look at other vessels in mid-1992, &quot;Union Rotorua&quot; was dropped from contention. In researching New Zealand defence acquisitions, Peter Greener claims he can find no clear reason for &quot;Union Rotorua&quot; to be dropped, but identifies the size of the ship, which would have been by far the largest vessel ever operated by the RNZN, and the gas-turbine propulsion system, which was due for overhaul, as factors. Shipbroking company Rugg and Co was contracted in July 1992 to identify civilian ships that met the RNZN&#x27;s criteria and were available to purchase second-hand; the company returned a list of 33 ships of 20 classes, which the Defence Force culled to 21 ships of 9 classes, then again to 4 classes. In October 1992, around the same time as the second revision or Rugg and Co&#x27;s list, shipyards in Spain, Korea, and Poland were asked about the cost of new-build vessels. By January 1993, a Mercandian 2-in-1 class vessel was identified as the preferred type; although there was a loss of capability compared to a purpose-built vessel, this was seen as an acceptable tradeoff as the RNZN would have great difficulty affording a new ship, particularly after acquiring the &quot;Anzac&quot; class frigates. An independent review by British company BMT Defence Services indicated that conversion of such a vessel for military service was feasible, but warned that the ramp size and vehicle deck height were smaller than the RNZN had specified, and that motion in heavy conditions, particularly with the later-planned modification to carry helicopters, was a concern. Approval was sought from Cabinet in April 1993 to purchase a ship, although the decision to buy a new-build or second-hand vessel was unresolved. The Australian government offered to lease or sell the Royal Australian Navy&#x27;s heavy lift ship, , to the New Zealanders in late 1993; although the offer was responded to favourably, it was rejected because of the lower cargo capacity and higher personnel requirement compared to the Mercandian design, despite &quot;Tobruk&quot;″s capability for beach landings.

The decision to acquire a second-hand Mercandian 2-in-1 class ship was made in July 1994. Rugg and Co was asked to provide a list of such ships available; they advised that the only ship available was &quot;Mercandian Queen II&quot;, which had just come back onto the market after a previous sale fell through, and Cabinet approval was secured on 28 November 1994. The ship was purchased from Mercandia on 16 December 1994 for NZ$14.15 million or 55 million Danish Kronor. She was sailed to New Zealand with a cargo and as a New Zealand-flagged merchant vessel under the name &quot;Sealift&quot; to offset costs, arrived on 14 March 1995, and was commissioned into the RNZN as HMZNS &quot;Charles Upham&quot; (named after dual Victoria Cross winner Charles Upham) on 18 October 1995. Before entering operational service, she was fitted with naval communications equipment, along with four machine guns and two SRBOC Mark 36 launchers for self-defence, and increased accommodation facilities. In military service, the ship&#x27;s company consisted of 8 officers and 24 sailors.

===RNZN career===
During 1996, &quot;Charles Upham&quot; made two operational voyages to test the ship&#x27;s capabilities. The first was between Napier and Lyttelton, then on 24 June, the vessel sailed from Auckland to Fiji as part of Exercise Tropic Dust. En route to Fiji, the lightly laden &quot;Charles Upham&quot; showed a propensity to roll, and reached 37 degrees from centre during one heavy storm; the degree of roll caused the main fuel pump to fail and the ship experienced a broaching effect. The conditions led to the ship being nicknamed &quot;Charles Chuckam&quot; and &quot;Chuck-Up&quot;, and the commanding officer was so concerned for the safety of the ship and his personnel that on return to New Zealand on 3 August, &quot;Charles Upham&quot; was withdrawn from service until modifications could be made to improve stability. Other alterations planned as part of this conversion included the installation of a flight deck and facilities for two mid-size helicopters, and an increase in soldier accommodation by 100, bringing the number of available berths for ship&#x27;s personnel and passengers to 215. Investigation found that up to of cargo or ballast (half the ship&#x27;s designed load) was required to minimise excessive motion, and operation of a helicopter in even these conditions would be limited. Cargo unloading capability at undeveloped or damaged wharves was also found to be poor, with cranes unable to be fitted because they would further compromise stability, and container forklifts were too heavy for the ship&#x27;s -per-axle deck weight limit.

The ship was berthed at Devonport Naval Base until the problems could be addressed; this was slow in coming, and by June 1997, &quot;Charles Upham&quot; was being referred to as &quot;the Calliope South Windbreak&quot;. Delays included a reassessment of Defence finances and operational requirements prioritising spending on the Army, and government calls for an independent report into the ship&#x27;s acquisition and suitability for conversion. The report found that the vessel had been acquired reasonably and was suitable for modification, although the new Alliance Party criticised this review as a whitewash. In October 1997, Cabinet agreed that conversion of the vessel would be considered in 2000, near the end of the three-year planning cycle. A month later, the Alliance Party published &quot;The Scandal of The Chales Upham&quot; the first of two booklets criticising the ship and her acquisition. By April 1998, pressures on the defence budget caused priority for funding the conversion to be reduced, and the RNZN made &quot;Charles Upham&quot; available for civilian charter until such funding became available again. In early 1998, the ballast tanks were refitted, and an STP was installed.

On 12 May 1998, &quot;Charles Upham&quot; sailed on a bareboat charter to Spanish company Contenemar SA, where she was used to transport oranges and lemons around the Mediterranean. The Alliance Party released their second booklet, &quot;The Biggest Lemon Ever to Leave Auckland&quot;, in July 1998, which claimed the sealift ship was &quot;doing a passable imitation between a lemon and a white elephant&quot;. To counter the claims being made by the Alliance Party and sections of the media, the Audit Office compiled an internal report in September commenting on the allegations, along with other advice received by the government relating to the ship. To serve the public interest, Defence Minister Max Bradford authorised full disclosure of all information the Ministry of Defence and the RNZN could make public, resulting in the November 1998 publication of the document &quot;Official Information Pertaining to the Military Sealift Project HMNZS Charles Upham&quot;. In July 1999, the Cabinet gave approval in principle for the conversion to occur.

An election in November 1999 saw the transition from the Fourth National Government to the Fifth Labour Government, and a new review into &quot;Charles Upham&quot; was ordered. The &quot;Sealift Review&quot; was completed in November 2000, and found that although the ship had limitations, retaining and modifying the vessel was the most cost-effective option for maintaining a strategic sealift capability. Despite this, the Cabinet agreed in April 2001 to a proposal that called for the sale of &quot;Charles Upham&quot; once her Spanish charter ended, and address the reacquisition of sealift capability at the same time as the replacement for the frigate . On 9 May, plans to sell the ship were announced. &quot;Charles Upham&quot; was decommissioned and sold outright to Contenemar in July for NZ$8.6 million. The RNZN then sought to acquire sealift capability through Project Protector, resulting in the acquisition of the multi-role vessel in 2007.

===Post-military career===
In Contenemar service, the ship initially operated under the name &quot;Don Carlos&quot; (a name that began use during the company&#x27;s charter of the naval vessel), then was renamed &quot;Don Carlos II&quot; in 2007. In 2008, the vessel was converted for use as a vehicle carrier. She was sold in 2009 to Indonesian company PT Pelayaran Putra Sejati, and renamed &quot;Nusantara Sejati&quot;.

<text>Wassef Ali Hassoun (; born January 1, 1980) is a United States Marine who was charged with desertion for leaving his unit and engaging with others in a hoax to make it appear that he had been captured by terrorists on June 19, 2004, while serving in Iraq. Originally listed as having deserted, the Lebanese-born Marine was then thought to have been taken hostage by Iraqis who were thought to have befriended him.

==Career==
Al Jazeera broadcast a video of Hassoun on June 27, 2004, blindfolded and with a masked man holding a sword over his head, saying that he had been captured. His &quot;kidnappers&quot; identified themselves as part of &quot;Islamic Response&quot;, the security wing of the &quot;National Islamic Resistance&quot; 1920 Revolution Brigades.

On July 3, 2004, Al Jazeera reported that the terrorist group 1920 Revolution Brigades had released a statement declaring they had beheaded Hassoun, and their website confirmed this. On July 4 it was reported al-Sunna denied this, and on July 6, Al Jazeera reported receipt of a message he&#x27;d been &quot;taken to a safe location&quot; after he promised to desert from the U.S. Marine Corps. On July 7, CNN reported that Hassoun had contacted his family in West Jordan, Utah and Lebanon from the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, asking to be picked up at an unspecified location. The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; stated later that afternoon his family, as well as the embassy in question, deny that the telephone call had taken place.

On July 8, U.S. Department of State spokesman Richard A. Boucher announced that Hassoun had arrived at the embassy in Beirut at 11 am EDT, and was in good health.

A preliminary result of the U.S. Navy investigation into the activities of Hassoun concluded that he deserted the U.S. Marine Corps on June 21, 2004. In mid-July, he publicly denied desertion.

On December 9, 2004, the U.S. Department of Defense announced that Hassoun would be charged with desertion, larceny and wrongful disposition of military property in connection with his service-issued M9 pistol that disappeared with him and never turned up. If convicted, he faced a dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay, and from five to ten years incarceration on each specification.

In a further development, on January 4, 2005, he was again labelled a deserter after failing to return to his base in North Carolina from authorized leave. He reportedly fled to Lebanon.

On June 29, 2014, Hassoun was reported to have turned himself in to U.S. authorities on the two charges of desertion.

On February 23, 2015, Hassoun was found guilty of deserting when he disappeared in 2004 and 2005, and was convicted of causing the loss of his service pistol. He was sentenced to two years and five days in prison, with credit for approximately eight months he spent in pretrial confinement. Hassoun also had his rank reduced, lost his pay, and received a dishonorable discharge. He was discharged in 2016.

<text>Gregynog () is a large country mansion in the village of Tregynon, northwest of Newtown in the old county of Montgomeryshire, now Powys in mid Wales. There has been a settlement on the site since the twelfth century. From the fifteenth to the nineteenth century it was the home of the Blayney and Hanbury-Tracy families. In 1960 it was transferred to the University of Wales as a conference and study centre by Margaret Davies, granddaughter of the nineteenth century industrial magnate and philanthropist, David Davies &#x27;Top Sawyer&#x27; of Llandinam.
 The gardens and park surrounding the house are listed at Grade I on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales.

==History==
The original mansion was rebuilt in the 1840s by Charles Hanbury-Tracy, 1st Baron Sudeley. Its concrete cladding, designed to replicate the black-and-white timber-framed architecture of Montgomeryshire farmhouses, is among the earliest examples of concrete use in building in the modern era. The Sudeleys were also pioneers of the use of concrete in the building of new cottages and farmhouses on the Gregynog estate, and many Cadw-listed examples can still be seen in Tregynon and the surrounding countryside. At its largest, the Gregynog estate was over in extent, but the estate was broken up in 1913, leaving the mansion with of farms, woodlands and formal gardens. The sunken garden and arboretum are of particular note. The gardens and park are listed at Grade I on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales.

==Gregynog and the Davies sisters==

Gregynog was bought by Margaret and her elder sister Gwendoline Davies in 1920 with the intention of establishing a centre of excellence for the arts, crafts and music which would enrich the lives of the people of Wales in the aftermath of the World War One. It became famous for music, fine printing and for the sisters&#x27; art collections which they bequeathed to the nation. These can now be seen in the Davies Galleries of the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff. 

Theirs was one of the most important British collections of French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painting acquired before 1920. Their advisor Hugh Blaker was the younger brother of their governess Jane Blaker. The French collection was only one aspect of their interests – it hung at Gregynog alongside Old Masters, prints by Dürer, Rembrandt and Whistler, Chinese and Islamic ceramics, contemporary hand-made furniture commissioned by the sisters, Welsh vernacular furniture as well as contemporary ceramics and crafts. Seen as a whole, the sisters&#x27; collections are a tribute to the multiplicity and catholicism of their tastes.

The Gregynog Music Festival, Wales&#x27;s oldest surviving classical music festival, was established in 1933 by the Davies sisters, with the advice of their friend and advisor, Sir Henry Walford Davies (later Master of the King&#x27;s Music). Many famous names are associated with the Gregynog Festivals, including Gustav Holst, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Edward Elgar and Sir Adrian Boult. The Festival is still held at Gregynog every June. In more recent years, leading international artistes have performed at Gregynog, including Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears. The sisters also established the Gregynog Press, which still exists under the name of Gwasg Gregynog, and is famous for its limited edition hand-printed books with fine bindings and exquisite wood-engraved illustrations.

Gregynog is also home to the annual Young Musicians Competition which attracts participants from all over Wales and beyond.

==Gregynog today==

Since Margaret Davies&#x27;s gift of Gregynog to the University of Wales in 1960, the hall has hosted conferences, seminars and summer schools from every academic discipline. The growing understanding of the ecological importance of the grounds, especially the ancient woodlands, has led to their designation in March 2013 as a National Nature Reserve. The training apiary of the Montgomeryshire Beekeepers Association is also situated in the Gregynog grounds.

The &quot;Gregynog Statistical Conference&quot; has been held annually over Easter at Gregynog Hall since 1965. Established by Dennis Lindley during his tenure at Aberystwyth, Gregynog Hall has welcomed a number of internationally renowned statisticians, some of which include Henry Daniels, David Cox, Peter Bickel, David Kendall, George Barnard, John Nelder, Brad Efron, Adrian Smith, Peter Donnelly, David Spiegelhalter and Julian Besag.

The Hall continues to operate as an historic house conference centre and now wedding venue, offering tourist accommodation for visitors to the gardens and grounds. Following institutional changes within the University of Wales the future of Gregynog as a national centre for excellence in the arts, education and culture of Wales is soon to be protected by its establishment as an independent charitable trust.

<text>Eric James Shanower (born October 23, 1963) is an American cartoonist, best known for his &quot;Oz&quot; novels and comics, and for the ongoing retelling of the Trojan War as &quot;Age of Bronze&quot;.

==Early life==
Eric Shanower was born on October 23, 1963. Upon his graduation from Novato High School in 1981, he attended The Kubert School in Dover, New Jersey, graduating in 1984.

==Career==
Shanower&#x27;s first major published works were the &quot;Oz&quot; graphic novels, which are &quot;The Enchanted Apples of Oz&quot;, &quot;The Secret Island of Oz&quot;, &quot;The Ice King of Oz&quot;, &quot;The Forgotten Forest of Oz&quot;, and &quot;The Blue Witch of Oz&quot; released by First Comics and Dark Horse Comics between 1986 and 1992. They are collected in a single large volume titled &quot;Adventures in Oz&quot;, published by IDW.

He has also written and illustrated a full-length Oz novel, &quot;The Giant Garden of Oz&quot;, and a collection of short Oz stories, &quot;The Salt Sorcerer of Oz&quot;. As an illustrator, he has worked on books by Oz historians, including &quot;The Wicked Witch of Oz&quot; by Rachel Cosgrove Payes, &quot;The Rundelstone of Oz&quot; by Eloise Jarvis McGraw, &quot;The Runaway in Oz&quot; by John R. Neill, and &quot;The Third Book of Oz&quot; by L. Frank Baum. Other Oz projects include his illustrations for &quot;Paradox in Oz&quot; and &quot;The Living House of Oz&quot; by Edward Einhorn.

He wrote adaptations of L. Frank Baum&#x27;s first six original Oz novels for Marvel Comics, illustrated by artist Skottie Young. The first, &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; was released in a hardcover collection on September 2, 2009. The follow-up, &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;&#x27; began in November 2009 as an 8 issue monthly comic series, while the third mini i.e. &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot;, began in November 2010. The fourth and fifth books, &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz&quot; and &quot;The Road to Oz&quot;, were also subsequently adapted by Shanower and Young for Marvel Illustrated. The collaboration concluded with their adaptation of the sixth book, &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot;. In 2020, the six Oz graphic novels were rereleased in three collected volumes.

Shanower also wrote the comic series Little Nemo: Return to Slumberland for IDW. The first issue was released August 20, 2014.

===&quot;Age of Bronze&quot;===
In February 1991, Shanower &quot;conceived the idea to tell the story of the Trojan War in the comics medium,&quot; aiming to combine &quot;the myriad versions of the Greek myth with the archaeological record&quot; to showcase the tale in &quot;authentic historical detail.&quot; This aim has been manifested in the ongoing comic book &quot;Age of Bronze&quot;, debuting in late 1998 from Image Comics. As of 2018, the series has been collected in four (of a projected seven) volumes: 
* &quot;A Thousand Ships&quot;
* &quot;Sacrifice&quot;
* &quot;Betrayal Part One&quot;
* &quot;Betrayal Part Two&quot;
The seven volumes in their entirety will cover the complete story of the war. The books contain extensive bibliographies, for the story, the setting and historical Troy, drawing on the excavation work Heinrich Schliemann (et al.) and the publication &quot;Studia Troica.&quot; The book does not depict the gods or any mythical beings, with Chiron portrayed as a relatively normal human being rather than a centaur. Similarly, the Nymphs are portrayed as human priestesses rather than as supernatural beings.

===Other work===
Shanower has also drawn a number of one shot comics, such as Ed Brubaker&#x27;s &quot;Prez&quot; &quot;Smells Like Teen President&quot; (for DC Comics) and An Accidental Death (also written by Brubaker) published by Fantagraphics in 1993. For Marvel&#x27;s Epic line, he illustrated The Elsewhere Prince (1990), based on characters created by the French cartoonist Moebius. His work has appeared in magazines throughout the USA and Europe as well as in books and on TV.

==Awards==
Shanower won Eisner Awards for Best Writer-Artist in 2001 and 2003, won a for Best Serialized Comic in 2006, and was nominated for the Ignatz Award for Outstanding Artist in 1999 for his work on &quot;Age of Bronze&quot;. &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; miniseries written by Shanower, illustrated by Skottie Young, won two Eisners in 2010, for Best Limited Series or Story Arc and Best Publication for Kids.

His short story &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; was part of &quot;How Beautiful the Ordinary: Twelve Stories of Identity&quot;, an anthology of LGBTQ short stories for young adults published in 2009. The book was a Lambda Literary Award finalist for LGBT Children&#x27;s/Young Adult literature.

==Personal life==
Shanower lives in San Diego with his partner David Maxine, who runs Hungry Tiger Press, a publisher of Oz books, Oz-related comics and compact discs, which the two started in 1994.

<text>Alexander Sánchez Sepúlveda (born June 5, 1973) is a former Puerto Rican professional boxer. He held the WBO minimumweight title from 1993 to 1997.

==Boxing career==
Sánchez began his professional boxing career on October 4, 1991, knocking out Carlos Figueroa in round one at Mayagüez, Puerto Rico.

After one more win that year, he took 1992 off, but came back in 1993 to post nine wins in a row before facing Orlando Malone for the WBO&#x27;s world Strawweight championship. On December 22 of that year, Sánchez became a world champion by knocking Malone out in the first round at San Juan, Puerto Rico.

He went on a European tour in 1994, retaining his title and winning a non-title bout in Spain, and retaining his title in Germany. By then, Sánchez was actively challenging Michael Carbajal into a fight. That fight, however, never came off.

In 1995, he retained his title twice, and won four non-title bouts. In 1996, he only had one fight, knocking out Jose Luis Velardez in round five.

In 1997, he started by suffering his first defeat, at the hands of Edgar Cardenas, by a decision in ten rounds. He then beat future world champion Victor Burgos by a decision in twelve to retain the title, in what marked the beginning of their trilogy of bouts. He closed the year by getting his long anticipated unification bout with WBC world champion Ricardo López, but he lost the title to López when López knocked him out in round five at Madison Square Garden.

Sánchez has been active only on and off since. In 2002, he and Burgos had their second meeting, and this time the result was a draw. But in 2003, after López had conquered the IBF world belt and retired, the IBF declared Sánchez and Burgos their official challengers for the world crown, and this time, Sánchez lost by a knockout in round 12 at Las Vegas.

Sánchez revealed that he had become a newborn Christian shortly before his next fight, an attempt at recovering the WBO world Strawweight championship, held this time by Ivan Calderón. On December 6, he lost to Calderón by a twelve-round unanimous decision at Bayamón.

On August 6, 2004, Sánchez, who had shortly before expressed to local newspapers that he hoped to become a world champion again, beat Roberto Gomez by an eight-round decision, as part of a San Juan undercard highlighted by José Miguel Cotto&#x27;s win over former world champion Al Kotey.

Just over a month later, on September 11, he posted a first-round knockout over Arturo Velazquez, at the José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum, also in San Juan.

On January 29, 2005, Sánchez attempted to win the WBO world Jr. Flyweight title, but he lost to champion Nelson Dieppa of Vieques by an eleventh-round knockout. Puerto Rican boxing experts commented that the Sánchez-Dieppa fight should have been considered for &quot;fight of the year&quot; in Puerto Rico.

His next fight, once again for the WBO Jr. flyweight title that Hugo Cazares had taken from Dieppa, was held in Ponce on August 20 of that year. After suffering an eye injury, Sánchez lost the fight by an eighth-round technical knockout, announcing his retirement from professional boxing immediately after the bout.

At a moment in his career Alex Sánchez was trained by Félix Trinidad&#x27;s father Felix Trinidad Sr.

Sánchez is now a boxing promoter in Puerto Rico.

<text>Captain Charles Browne Hardwicke (1788–1880) was an English explorer, later a farmer. He was born in Market Deeping, Lincolnshire. He settled in Launceston, Tasmania in 1816. He is best known for his claim that Tasmania&#x27;s north-west coast was &quot;quite impenetrable and totally uninhabitable&quot;.

==Biography==

Charles Browne Hardwicke was the eldest child of Charles and Frances (née Browne) Hardwicke and was born on 2 August 1788 at Market Deeping, south Lincolnshire. The family had lived within the county since the middle of the sixteenth century.

From his mother&#x27;s side, Charles was the great-grandson of Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers and his mistress Margaret Clifford.

His father (also Charles) was the youngest son in a large middle-class family of thirteen children. He was a surgeon in Market Deeping. Many of his siblings were educated or married into medical, clerical, legal and military professions.
In December 1803, aged 15, Charles Browne Hardwicke, began his naval life when he was consigned to a merchant ship trading in the West Indies. At nineteen he received a commission for the Royal Navy; at the time England was fighting the Napoleonic wars. At 25 in 1813 he left the Royal Navy and was appointed as third officer on the convict transport ship the &quot;General Hewitt&quot;, bound for Sydney.
Shortly after his arrival in Sydney in February 1814 he wrote to Governor Lachlan Macquarie to request permission to stay in the colony. When permission was given he was also granted 200 acres of land at Norfolk Plains (near Launceston) in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land to encourage free settlers to the area to establish farms. In 1819 he was granted a further 500 acres by Macquarie for the capture of escaped convicts. Between the years of 1814 to 1829 Hardwicke received over 3,000 acres in land grants for services in capturing escaped convicts and bushrangers.
By 1823 the population to the island had rapidly increased and Lieutenant-Governor Sorell commissioned Hardwicke to conduct a tour of discovery of the north-west where he reported that the country was &quot;quite impenetrable and totally uninhabitable&quot;. He offered to explore eastward which he hoped would be more successful.

Charles Browne Hardwicke married Elizabeth Chapman (Harris) at Church of St. John, Launceston on 18 January 1820. They had fourteen children[2]. Elizabeth Chapman (Harris) was the eldest daughter of Sarah Chapman who was a convict who arrived in Australia on the convict ship The Nile in 1801 and John Harris (Australian settler) and military surgeon.

<doc id="777730" wikidata="Q991332" url="?curid=777730" title="Istog">
<text>Istog (; , &quot;Istok&quot;) or Burim is a town and municipality located in the District of Peja of western Kosovo. According to the 2011 census, the city of Istog has 5,115 inhabitants, while the municipality has 39,289 inhabitants. Based on the population estimates from the Kosovo Agency of Statistics in 2016, the municipality has 39,982 inhabitants.

== Name ==
The name of the town comes from the version of the Serbian word &quot;istok&quot; (variant &quot;istek&quot;), meaning &quot;well, water source&quot; referring to the springs of the Istočka river (, literally &quot;spring river&quot;), a tributary to the White Drin river. The name of the nearby village of Vrela, one of the largest settlements in the municipality, also means &quot;springs&quot;.

==History==

The Ottoman &quot;defter&quot; (tax registry; census) of 1582 registered the Ipek nahiyah as having 235 villages, of which Suho Grlo (Suvo Grlo) was located within modern Istog municipality. Suvo Grlo had three bigger &quot;mahala&quot; (neighbourhoods). One of the neighbourhoods included Muslim converts. There were several Orthodox priests in the village.

During World War II, a total of 140 Serbs were killed in 1941 and 1942 in the district of Istog and another 95 were killed in 1943 and 1944 by Albanian paramilitaries. The areas in and around Istog saw much resistance against the Yugoslav Partisans by Albanians in 1945. In Lipa, near Istog, Bajram Grobi and his group of 9 others were surrounded by a partisan battalion - they sustained 3 losses in total, including Bajram himself. In August, Sali Kama and Bik Pazari resisted the partisans in Bjeshka, near Istog. In March, Berlac Rogani and 7 other men were surrounded at a mountain in Binak, near Istog, by a battalion of partisans numbering to 650 Serbs and Montenegrins; after 36 hours of fighting, Rogani and his men killed 28 partisans and wounded 12 others. Rogani and his men managed to break the encirclement and all 8 fighters managed to survive despite their injuries. On the 10th of September, in Liçeva and Lesnika (also near Istog), 32 Albanians battled against 1,300 well-armed Montenegrins for 6 hours in an event known as the &quot;Battle of the 32 Heroes&quot;. Only 4 of the Albanians managed to survive despite being wounded. The commanders of the Albanian side were Shaban Sadiku, Adem Shala and Alush Smajli, with Smajli being the only one to survive with grave injuries, and the Montenegrins were from the Boka Kotorska brigade.

==Demographics==

According to the last official census done in 2011, the municipality of Istog has 39,289 inhabitants.

===Ethnic groups===
The municipality of Istog has an ethnic Kosovo Albanian majority. Most of the Kosovo Serbs live in the village of Osojane.
Osojane is to the east of the town of Istog; also part of the Serbs lives in northern part of the municipality.

The ethnic composition of the municipality:
== Economy ==
After World War II, watermills on the river of Istog were nationalized and a new fish plant was built to operate as a socially owned enterprise. The company&#x27;s name under Yugoslavia was &quot;Ribnjak&quot;, meaning &quot;piscatory&quot; or &quot;fishery&quot; in Serbian. It was later privatized as Motel &quot;Trofta&quot;, meaning &quot;trout&quot; in Albanian - the type of fish it has and is still producing, selling, and distributing. The company employs around 70 people. The company acts as a hotel and restaurant, often hosting traditional weddings. The hotel provides hotel rooms as well as small bungalows by the river except Trofta Istog has the &quot;burim&quot; itself which everyone can go and visit the source of water and for sightseeing and the burim has the restaurants &quot;Freskia&quot; and &quot;Morea&quot; that are known for their food and the view of Istog.

<doc id="777734" wikidata="Q2743484" url="?curid=777734" title="Bill Voce">
<text>Bill Voce (8 August 1909 – 6 June 1984) was an English cricketer who played for Nottinghamshire and England. As a fast bowler, he was an instrumental part of England&#x27;s infamous Bodyline strategy in their tour of Australia in 1932–1933 under Douglas Jardine. He was born at Annesley Woodhouse, near Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. He died at Lenton, Nottingham.

==Early career==
Voce came from a working-class background in the coal mining districts around Nottingham. In the late 1920s he was living in Hucknall, a colliery town. He walked from Hucknall to Trent Bridge in the hope of a trial and his natural talent was quickly recognised. In Voce&#x27;s &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; obituary, the writer E. W. Swanton recalled his &quot;long, loose arm and natural flowing action&quot;. Bowling over the wicket, Voce could perform both the inswinger and the outswinger. Depending on the pitch conditions, he could switch from pace to slow-medium spin.

Voce made his first-class debut for Nottinghamshire against Gloucestershire in 1927. A few good performances saw him keep his place despite the strength and variety of Nottinghamshire&#x27;s bowling. At this stage, he was a classical left-arm spinner and some critics viewed him as a successor to Colin Blythe. Thus, when he changed to a faster pace the following year there was a good deal of criticism, but, in 1929, Voce returned to his slower style with great success in a number of games on sticky wickets, notably against Northamptonshire when he took fourteen wickets for 43 runs.

==International selection==
He was selected for the English tour of the West Indies and made his Test debut in the first Test at Bridgetown, Barbados, on 11 January 1930. However, the hard wicket encouraged him to move to a faster style, and he had so much success that he persisted with the faster method when he returned to England, except on wet pitches. He did not do particularly well as a pace bowler in 1930, but following Australia&#x27;s tour of England in that summer, when Don Bradman scored freely against the English bowling, Voce was part of a meeting convened between the future English captain, Douglas Jardine, and Nottinghamshire captain, Arthur Carr, to come up with a tactic to defeat Bradman and the Australians. Voce, and his fellow Nottinghamshire fast bowler, Harold Larwood, agreed to a suggestion by Jardine that bowling fast rising balls into the batsmen&#x27;s bodies, with several catching fielders on the leg side would be an effective tactic.

Over the next two years, Voce and Larwood practised this modified form of leg theory for Nottinghamshire, causing severe problems for opposing batsmen. Although Voce was somewhat slower than Larwood, his line, from left-arm over the wicket, and the steeper bounce that he obtained from his height, made him formidable enough and the batsmen got no relief when facing him. Voce took 123 wickets for 19.29 each in 1931, and with 136 for 16.87 each in 1932, he was chosen as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 1933. His bowling was so good that he regained his Test place and, with Larwood, was named for the 1932–1933 English tour of Australia, to be captained by Jardine. The bowlers implemented Jardine&#x27;s tactic, bowling fast and short at the Australian batsmen, with Voce inflicting several bruising injuries. The Australian media dubbed the tactic &#x27;Bodyline&#x27;. This resulted in severe ill-feeling between the cricket teams, and the countries.

==After Bodyline==
Following the Bodyline series, Voce declined severely as a bowler, but advanced as a hard-hitting batsman, to such an extent that he scored 1,020 runs for an average of over 35 in 1933 – though from Nottinghamshire&#x27;s perspective, this advance was nothing in comparison to the loss of 140 wickets from Larwood, and a cut of half in Voce&#x27;s tally. Voce was to remain a dangerous hitter for the rest of his career, and still holds the record for having played in the greatest number – five – of tenth wicket century stands in first-class cricket.

The political fallout resulting from Bodyline ensured that Voce, despite taking eight wickets against the Australians in 1934, was not chosen for any of the Tests, and before the 1935 season started, Voce asked Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) not to choose him. However, in county cricket, Voce was as good a bowler as ever, and may have taken over 150 wickets in both 1935 and 1936, but for faulty catching in the slips. He declared himself available again during the latter year, and became party to the 1936/1937 tour under Gubby Allen. Bowling this time to an off-side field, Voce, after a disappointing beginning, bowled superbly in the first Test at the Gabba with six for 41 on a perfect pitch, and crushed Australia with four for sixteen, after rain, on the fifth day. England won by 322 runs, and Voce again utilised a rain-affected pitch in the second Test with match figures of seven for 76, including three wickets in four balls. After taking seventeen wickets in the inaugural two Tests, Voce did not keep up his form in the last three due to a back problem. He still finished with 26 wickets to be the leading bowler for the series.

1937, however, was wiped out by a serious injury mid-season, and, even when fit again in the following two years, Voce was troubled by illness and had lost the venom of earlier in the decade. He failed to reach 100 wickets in either season, and joined the armed forces during World War II.

==Post-war career==
In 1946, at the age of thirty-seven, Voce played little cricket, but one excellent performance in a Test trial led him to be picked for his third tour of Australia for the 1946–47 Ashes series. Having arrived from a country that had had seven years of rationing Australia was a &#x27;land flowing with milk and honey&#x27; and he soon put on two stone (28 lbs) in weight. Whilst his classic action remained, he had none of the venom of old, was overweight and medium-paced, and in a controversial umpiring decision Bradman was given not out after being caught for 28 off his bowling in the First Test. Voce failed to take a Test wicket on the tour and played his last Test match against Australia at Melbourne in 1947, soon after which he announced his retirement from cricket to become county coach. However, so weak was Nottinghamshire&#x27;s bowling attack, that he played five more matches for them, the last as late as 1952.

Voce played in twenty seven Tests, scoring 308 runs at an average of 13.39, and taking 98 wickets at an average of 27.88. Even though he toured Australia three times, he never played for England against Australia in England. Right up to his death in 1984 at the age of 74, Voce was reluctant to discuss the Bodyline series, though it is known that he privately considered Bodyline to be wrong.

<text>Nemonymous was an experimental short fiction publication that labeled itself a &quot;megazanthus&quot; (a portmanteau of magazine and anthology). It was published and edited in the United Kingdom from 2001–2010 by D.F. Lewis.

This publication was distinctive in that all stories were published anonymously, with the identities of contributing authors being normally withheld until the following issue, an arrangement intended to temporarily strip the reader of any prejudices surrounding the author&#x27;s name (including popularity, gender and place of origin), and thus level the playing field for the writer. (Later issues did not follow this exact model.)

==History==
The first issue of &quot;Nemonymous&quot;, subtitled &quot;A Journal of Parthenogenetic Fiction and Late Labelling&quot;, appeared in November 2001, published in what Paul Di Filippo described as a &quot;unique, handsome, perfect-bound format roughly as big as an autoowner manual.&quot; Nine issues were published through July 2010. The final four editions were more like books than journals: &quot;Zencore&quot; (2007), &quot;Cone Zero&quot; (2008), &quot;Cern Zoo&quot; (2009) and &quot;Null Immortalis&quot; (2010).

All stories saw their first publication in &quot;Nemonymous&quot;. A few notable republications after appearing in &quot;Nemonymous&quot;: &quot;The Assistant To Dr Jacob&quot; by Eric Schaller and &quot;England and Nowhere&quot; by Tim Nickels were chosen for Year&#x27;s Best Fantasy and Horror anthologies. &quot;Strange Scenes From an Unfinished Film&quot; by Gary McMahon was chosen for &quot;Year&#x27;s Best Dark Fantasy &amp; Horror&quot;. The novelette &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Den&quot; by Steve Duffy was chosen for &quot;The Best Horror of the Year Volume Two&quot; edited by Ellen Datlow and &quot;The Weird&quot; edited by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer and was also a finalist for the 2009 World Fantasy Awards.

Two stories apparently remain anonymous in perpetuo: the influential &quot;Vanishing Life and Films of Emmanuel Escobada&quot; and &quot;George the Baker.&quot; Also, Nemonymous Two in 2002 is reputed to have published the world&#x27;s first blank story. And Nemonymous Six existed only through its non-existence, according to records.

== Critical reception ==

Writing in &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot;, Paul Di Filippo described the magazine&#x27;s level of writing as very high, and that Lewis and his cloaked crew were &quot;excavating the purest veins of writing, where only text, not the hype, matters.&quot; David Mathew writing for Infinity Plus called &quot;Nemonymous&quot; &quot;a beautifully produced, sleek and shiny new magazine of short stories: a good thing. And the stories appear with no author&#x27;s name noted: a brave thing. But it all seems to work: a democracy of prose.&quot;

Three different issues of &quot;Nemonymous&quot; were finalists for the British Fantasy Award for Best Anthology, in 2008, 2009, and 2010. &quot;Nemonymous&quot; was also a finalist for the same award in 2006 in the category of Best Small Press.

== Authors published ==

&quot;Nemonymous&quot; released the first short story published by World Fantasy Award winning author Lavie Tidhar (&quot;The Ballerina&quot; in &quot;Nemonymous&quot; 3). The magazine also published brand new fiction by many other authors including stories by Tony Ballantyne, Rosalind Barden, Keith Brooke, Mike Chinn, Simon Clark, Brendan Connell, Gary Couzens, Jetse de Vries, Lawrence Dyer, Scott Edelman, Paul Evanby, Avital Gad-Cykman, John Grant, A. D. Harvey, Rhys Hughes, Jay Lake, Rachel Kendall, Joel Lane, Bob Lock, Tony Lovell, Gary McMahon, William Meikle, Paul Meloy, Robert Neilson, Reggie Oliver, Monica O&#x27;Rourke, Ursula Pflug, Cameron Pierce, Steven Pirie, Joseph S. Pulver, Ekaterina Sedia, Marge Simon, Sarah Singleton, Steve Rasnic Tem, G. W. Thomas, Mark Valentine, Jeff VanderMeer, Neil Williamson, D. Harlan Wilson, A. C. Wise, and Tamar Yellin.

<doc id="777752" wikidata="Q945730" url="?curid=777752" title="Parasyte">
<text>is a Japanese science fiction horror manga series written and illustrated by Hitoshi Iwaaki. It was published in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Morning Open Zōkan&quot; (1989) and &quot;Monthly Afternoon&quot; (1989 to 1994). The manga was published in North America first by Tokyopop, then Del Rey, and finally Kodansha USA. The series follows Shinichi Izumi, a high school senior who is the victim of a failed attempt by a parasitic organism to take over his brain. The parasite, Migi, instead infects and takes over his arm, and both are forced in a peculiar partnership to fight other parasites.

The manga has been adapted into two live-action films in Japan, in 2014 and 2015. An anime television series adaptation produced by Madhouse, titled &quot;Parasyte -the maxim-&quot;, aired in Japan between October 2014 and March 2015. The English-language dub aired on Adult Swim&#x27;s Toonami programming block in the United States between October 2015 and April 2016.

By August 2022, the manga had over 25 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. In 1993, &quot;Parasyte&quot; received the 17th Kodansha Manga Award for the general category, as well as the 27th Seiun Award for the best manga in 1996.

==Plot==

&quot;Parasyte&quot; centers on a 17-year-old male high school student named Shinichi Izumi, who lives with his mother and father in a quiet neighborhood in Fukuyama, Hiroshima, Japan. One night, tiny worm-like aliens with drill-like heads called Parasites arrive on Earth, taking over the brains of their hosts by entering through their ears or noses. One Parasite attempts to crawl into Shinichi&#x27;s nose while he sleeps, but fails as Shinichi wakes up, and enters his body by burrowing into his arm instead. In the Japanese version, it takes over his right hand and is named , after the Japanese word for &quot;right&quot;.

Because Shinichi was able to prevent Migi from traveling further up into his brain, both beings retain their separate intellects and personalities. As the duo encounters other Parasites, they capitalize on their strange situation and gradually form a strong bond, working together to survive. This gives them an edge in battling other Parasites who frequently attack the pair upon realization that Shinichi&#x27;s human brain is still intact. Shinichi feels compelled to fight other Parasites, who devour other members of the species they infect as food, while enlisting Migi&#x27;s help.

The series explores philosophical and psychological questions such as the meaning of humanity, humans&#x27; relationship to the environment and other species, the role of instinct and love, and the inherent anthropocentrism of morality. Shinichi&#x27;s experience with Migi causes him to question if humanity has any right to claim moral superiority to the Parasites, while Migi and Reiko Tamura&#x27;s experiences with humans cause them to take on more human traits, such as love and sacrifice.

==Development==
Iwaaki chose a high school setting due to a scene he had thought of. When considering a scene where Migi turns his shape into a penis in front of Satomi Murano, Iwaaki believed that the scene would work best in that setting.

==Media==
===Manga===

Written and illustrated by Hitoshi Iwaaki, &quot;Parasyte&quot; was first published for three chapters in the special issue of Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Morning&quot;, &quot;Morning Open Zōkan&quot;, from the &quot;F&quot; to &quot;H&quot; issues (August 1–October 3, 1989, issues). The series was later transferred to the publisher&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Afternoon&quot; on November 25, 1989, and finished on December 24, 1994. Kodansha collected its 64 chapters in ten volumes, released from July 23, 1990, to March 23, 1995. It was later republished in eight volumes from January 23 to June 23, 2003.

It was originally licensed for English translation and North American distribution by Tokyopop, which published the series over 12 volumes from 1998 to 2002. The Tokyopop version ran in &quot;Mixxzine&quot;. Daily pages from the Tokyopop version ran in the Japanimation Station, a service accessible to users of America Online. The Tokyopop English-language manga went out of print on May 2, 2005. Del Rey Manga later acquired the rights to the series, and published eight volumes following the release between 2007 and 2009. Kodansha USA republished the volumes in North America between 2011 and 2012.

===Anime===

An anime television series adaptation titled aired in Japan on Nippon TV between October 9, 2014, and March 26, 2015. It was produced by Madhouse, Nippon Television, VAP and Forecast Communications and directed by Kenichi Shimizu, with Shōji Yonemura handling series composition, Tadashi Hiramatsu designing the characters and Ken Arai composing the music. The opening theme song is &quot;Let Me Hear&quot; performed by Fear, and loathing in Las Vegas. The ending theme is &quot;It&#x27;s the Right Time&quot; performed by Daichi Miura. At Anime Expo 2015, Sentai Filmworks announced that the anime would run on Adult Swim&#x27;s Toonami programming block on October 4, 2015.

The series was simulcast by Crunchyroll outside of Asia and by Animax Asia in Southeast Asia and South Asia. Sentai Filmworks has licensed the anime for North America, South America, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand release. UK Distributor Animatsu Entertainment released the series in the UK and Ireland. In Australia and New Zealand, Hanabee acquired the series and released it within the region.

===Live-action films===

Hollywood&#x27;s New Line Cinema had acquired the film rights to &quot;Parasyte&quot; in 2005, and a film adaptation was reported to be in the works, with Jim Henson Studios and Don Murphy allegedly in charge of production. New Line Cinema&#x27;s option expired in 2013, prompting a bidding war in Japan. Film studio and distributor Toho won the rights, and decided to adapt the manga into a two-part live-action film series directed by Takashi Yamazaki. The first part, &quot;&quot;, was released in November 2014 and the second part, &quot;&quot;, was released in April 2015.

On TV Asahi&#x27;s Manga Sōsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150,000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, &quot;Parasyte&quot; ranked 60th.

By November 2013, the manga had over 11 million copies in circulation. By December 2020, the manga had more than 24 million copies in circulation; it had over 25 million copies in circulation by August 2022.

The manga series has been praised and recommended by Waseda University professor and literary critic , and by philosopher Shunsuke Tsurumi. The manga artist Machiko Satonaka praised the work and described it as &quot;a masterpiece that makes you think about fundamental problems that raises the awareness of identity establishment&quot;. Connie Zhang of &quot;Mania.com&quot; ranked the first volume of &quot;Parasyte&quot; as A−. Zhang wrote that the series&#x27; main focus is the dynamic relationship between Shinichi and Migi and their discussions about human nature. Zhang stated: &quot;It is this casual philosophical pandering that makes &quot;Parasyte&quot; a cerebral manga. As the parasytes gradually adapt to human life and become cleverer at disguising their true identities, Shinichi finds himself in more and more danger&quot;. She concluded: &quot;&quot;Parasyte&quot; is not just about a teenager saving the world. It is about a teenager at the cusp of adulthood and his cynical, mutinous right hand...saving the world. Highly recommended&quot;.

The anime adaptation by Madhouse was well received by critics and fans alike, getting praise for the animation, characterization, pacing and the soundtrack of the anime. In November 2019, Crunchyroll listed &quot;Parasyte -the maxim-&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 best anime of the 2010s&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; listed it among the best anime series of the 2010s.

===China ban===
On June 12, 2015, the Chinese Ministry of Culture listed &quot;Parasyte&quot; among 38 anime and manga titles banned in mainland China. Nonetheless, the live-action version of &quot;Parasyte&quot; managed to be released in nationwide cinemas across mainland China, using a 125-minute special cut which condensed part 1 and part 2.
