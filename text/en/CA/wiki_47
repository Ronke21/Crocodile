<text>Anne, alternatively spelled Ann, is a form of the Latin female name Anna. This in turn is a representation of the Hebrew Hannah, which means &#x27;favour&#x27; or &#x27;grace&#x27;. Related names include Annie.

Anne is sometimes used as a male name in the Netherlands, particularly in the Frisian speaking part (for example, author Anne de Vries). In this incarnation, it is related to Germanic arn-names and means &#x27;eagle&#x27;. It has also been used for males in France (Anne de Montmorency) and Scotland (Lord Anne Hamilton). In Ireland the name is used as an anglicized version of Áine.

<doc id="769895" wikidata="Q1174839" url="?curid=769895" title="David J. Tholen">
<text>David James Tholen (born 1955) is an American astronomer at the Institute for Astronomy of the University of Hawaiʻi. He holds a 1978 B.S. from the University of Kansas, a 1984 PhD from the University of Arizona, and specializes in planetary and Solar System astronomy. He is a discoverer of minor planets and known for the &quot;Tholen spectral classification&quot; scheme used on asteroids.

==Professional life==
Tholen has discovered a number of asteroids, including the lost , which may be an Apohele asteroid, and , which certainly is; in fact, it had the smallest semimajor axis and aphelion distance among the known asteroids (and still holds both records among numbered asteroids as of March 2010). He won the H. C. Urey Prize in 1990.

He co-discovered the asteroid 99942 Apophis (previously known as ). This asteroid will closely approach Earth on April 13, 2029 and very briefly appear as bright as a third magnitude star.

In 1995, Tholen obtained images of the then newly discovered comet Hale-Bopp at a time when the comet was moving very slowly with respect to the background stars, thus permitting the red- green- and blue-filtered images to be combined into a color composite without the background stars appearing as separately colored dots. This color composite image was made publicly accessible via the Institute of Astronomy&#x27;s web site.

Later, then postdoc at University of Hawaiʻi, Olivier R. Hainaut discovered that a nearly identical image was being discussed by late-night radio host Art Bell and one of his guests, Courtney Brown, who claimed that it proved the existence of an unnatural object following the comet, something supposedly seen by those who had learned how to engage in the technique of &quot;remote viewing&quot;. The image provided to Bell by Brown, and eventually made public on Bell&#x27;s web site, did indeed show an object next to the comet that did not appear in archival images of the sky. In reality, that image had been digitally altered from the original image posted by Tholen, presumably by taking the image of a star near the edge of the frame, adding it next to the comet, and then trimming away the outer edges of the frame.

Tholen and Hainaut exposed the fraud by producing the original image, which showed no such additional object. Nevertheless, some conspiracy theorists maintained that Brown&#x27;s version was actually the original image and that Tholen had removed the additional object from the one on the Institute&#x27;s web site. The Heaven&#x27;s Gate cult was so convinced that the additional object was a spaceship coming to take them away from Earth that they committed mass suicide.

The Mars-crosser asteroid 3255 Tholen, discovered by Edward Bowell in 1980, is named after David Tholen.

==Personal interests==
David Tholen and Roy Tucker, co-discovers of 99942 Apophis, are both fans of the TV series Stargate SG-1, which influenced the naming of the asteroid. The show&#x27;s most persistent villain is &quot;Apophis&quot;, an alien also named for the Egyptian god. &quot;We considered a number of names, but &#x27;Apophis&#x27; kept floating to the top,&quot; says Tucker. &quot;Apophis was a very fitting name for not only because of its threatening nature, but also because of its evolution from an Aten asteroid to an Apollo asteroid during the 2029 encounter.&quot;

Tholen is a fan of the University of Kansas Jayhawks college basketball team and the Kansas City Royals Major League Baseball team.

He also plays clarinet and bass clarinet for the Honolulu Community Concert Band and the Oahu Community Orchestra.

He is also a user of the OS/2, Linux, Windows, Solaris, and Mac OS operating systems.

Tholen frequently posts to various Usenet groups using the alias tholen@antispam.ham.

<doc id="769897" wikidata="Q5273028" url="?curid=769897" title="Dick Howser Trophy">
<text>The Dick Howser Trophy is bestowed annually to the national college baseball player of the year. The award is named after former collegiate and Major League Baseball (MLB) player and manager Dick Howser, who died as the result of brain cancer on June 17, 1987, at the age of 51. In that same year, the award was established by friends of Howser and presented to Mike Fiore, the inaugural winner. It is considered to be the Heisman Trophy of college baseball.

Six winners of the Dick Howser Trophy are members of the National College Baseball Hall of Fame. Five winners—Kris Benson, David Price, Stephen Strasburg, Adley Rutschman, and Paul Skenes—went on to become the first overall MLB draft pick. Jason Jennings, Buster Posey, and Kris Bryant went on to win the Rookie of the Year Award several years after winning the Dick Howser Trophy. Jered Weaver is the only award winner to pitch a no-hitter, while Mark Teixeira holds the record for most games with home runs from both sides of the plate. Furthermore, seventeen players won the Golden Spikes Award alongside the Dick Howser Trophy. Brooks Kieschnick is the only player to win the trophy more than once.

The winners from 1987 to 1998 were selected by the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA). The National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association (NCBWA) became the voting body in 1999, and now presents the award together with the St. Petersburg Chamber of Commerce in Florida. The most recent recipient of the award is Charlie Condon of Georgia.

<text>József Tihamér Antall Jr. (, ; 8 April 1932 – 12 December 1993) was a Hungarian teacher, librarian, historian, and statesman who served as the first democratically elected prime minister of Hungary, holding office from May 1990 until his death in December 1993. He was also the leader of the Hungarian Democratic Forum from 1989.

==Early life and education==

József Tihamér Antall de Dörgicse et Kisjene was born to an ancient Hungarian family from the lower nobility in Budapest on 8 April 1932. His father, József Antall Sr., a jurist and civil servant, worked for the government in several ministries. Antall Sr. coordinated the first living wage calculations in Hungary, and he was a founding member of the Independent Smallholders&#x27; Party (1931). During World War II, he presided over the government committee for refugees. After the German occupation of Hungary he resigned; later he was arrested by the Gestapo. After the war, he became minister of reconstruction in the government of Zoltán Tildy. Later, he became president of the Hungarian Red Cross, but after the communist coup he resigned and retired to his family estate. In 1991, he was posthumously honoured by Yad Vashem.

His mother, Irén Szűcs has Jewish roots, she was the daughter of a village teacher. Her father, István Szűcs (born Hermann Frankl), also became a political figure during the First World War and the interwar period. In the 1920s Szűcs became a deputy Secretary of State. Antall had a sister, Edith Antall. His brother-in-law, Géza Jeszenszky later became Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Antall cabinet.

He graduated from the Budapest Piarist High School in 1950. He was interested in politics early on, but (quite understandably) didn&#x27;t pursue his political career during the communist regime of the 1950s. After graduating from high school, he studied Hungarian language and literature at the Eötvös Loránd University as well as history and archival science. He wrote his thesis about the politics of József Eötvös, obtaining degrees in teaching, library science and museology. On 30 September 1991, Antall was awarded an honorary doctoral degree from Central Connecticut State University.

Antall and his wife, Klára Fülepp, had two children, György Antall, a lawyer, and Péter Antall, a photojournalist, who later became director of the Antall József Knowledge Centre. Its primary objectives are to foster the Antall tradition and promote the spread of knowledge.

==Early career==
Following the graduation, Antall worked for the Hungarian State Archives and the Research Institute of Pedagogy. In 1955, he started teaching in József Eötvös Grammar School, leading the Revolutionary Committee of the school during the 1956 Hungarian Uprising. During the revolution, he participated in the reorganization of the Independent Smallholders Party and in the founding of the Christian Youth Alliance. After the Soviet Union crushed the revolution, he was arrested and released several times. He continued his teaching career in Ferenc Toldy Grammar School in 1957, but in 1959 he was banned from teaching due to his former political activities.

Following this, he worked as a librarian for two years. In 1963 he wrote biographies of 80 doctors for the Lexicon of Hungarian Biographies. He became interested in the history of medicine, and conducted fundamental research in the area. He started working in the library and archives department of the Semmelweis Museum of Medical History, dedicated to the history of medicine. Starting as a research fellow, he was promoted to deputy director and in 1974 he became director of the institute. His research was recognised internationally, and in 1986 he was the vice president of the International Society for the History of Medicine.

==Prime minister==

Antall was delegated to the National Roundtable Talks by the Hungarian Democratic Forum on 22 March 1989 and worked in the committee on constitutional reform. He became well known for his activities during the negotiations.

On 21 October 1989 he was elected President of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) by an overwhelming majority, thus becoming the party&#x27;s official candidate for prime minister. The MDF was heavily tipped to win the 1990 elections, and as expected won a sweeping victory with 164 seats, just short of a majority. On 23 May he became the first prime minister since 1948 who was not either a Communist or fellow traveler. He headed a centre-right coalition comprising the MDF, the Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party (FKGP), and the Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party (KDNP)–the first in 44 years with no Communist participation. He also made a pact with the main opposition party, the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ). This agreement laid the foundations for the parliamentary operation of Hungarian democracy. His statement that, in spirit, he wanted to be the Prime Minister of 15 million Hungarians made a great sensation. At the same time, he contributed to the Euro-Atlantic orientation of Hungary. He played a great role in the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the termination of the Comecon as well as in the withdrawal of the occupying Russian forces in 1991. In 1991, in Strasbourg, he was awarded with the Robert Schuman Prize for his activities aimed at uniting Europe as well as extending Hungary&#x27;s European relations.

As prime minister, Antall oversaw the establishment of a legal system to promote a market economy and attract foreign investment. The ruling coalition attempted to stabilize the economy while implementing privatization and other elements of a market economy, while the populist right wing of the MDF was vocal about the &quot;national issue&quot;, the question of the Hungarian minorities in neighbouring countries—and attempted to put it at the centre of the government&#x27;s platform.

However, the return to a capitalist system and all its accompanying reforms resulted in socioeconomic difficulties for the country during Antall&#x27;s term. Unemployment jumped from nonexistence to 14 percent. Inflation increased at an annual rate of 23–35 percent (excluding indexing of wages and pensions). Older, retired people, more than one-fifth of the population, suffered the most, and the living standards of more than one-third of the populace declined to below subsistence level. In the meantime, income disparities increased, which irritated the people. Corruption became more widespread and visible than before. Together with the previously omnipotent police force, street security also collapsed in 1990. The crime rate, especially in Budapest, increased threefold in five years.

In the summer of 1990, Antall and the MDF supported the introduction of a Catholic religious education into the national curriculum. This led to conflict with the other coalition parties, since only three-quarters of the Hungarian population were Catholics. Antall appointed Miklós Lukáts of the KDNP as his State Secretary for Church Affairs; from this position, Lukáts oversaw religious affairs, including the return of church properties seized by the communists. By 1991 Antall was receiving criticism for his authoritarian style, though this contrasted with his uncharismatic presence. Conflict over their powers erupted between him and Hungary&#x27;s president, Árpád Göncz, who belonged to the opposing party, the Alliance of Free Democrats.

In the realm of domestic politics, Antall had to face hardships during his career: the taxi-blockade in Budapest in 1990 and the withdrawal of the Independent Smallholders&#x27; Party from the coalition government forced him to restructure his cabinet in February 1992; that reorganisation ultimately saved his administration from being toppled. Within MDF, Antall was continuously attacked by István Csurka who later on set into motion a stand-alone movement, thus Hungarian Justice and Life Party (MIÉP) came into existence.

==Illness and death==

Antall became ill and diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the summer of 1990. In October, two days before the outbreak of taxi drivers&#x27; blockade, he underwent surgery, the famous interview in pajamas with him was made thereafter in the hospital to respond to the heated political situation resulted by the taxi blockade. Antall&#x27;s cancer recurred half a year later. A day before his death, Antall was awarded Grand Cross of the Hungarian Order of Merit by President Árpád Göncz on 11 December 1993. During the last period of his premiership Antall was substituted by the Interior Minister Péter Boross.

József Antall died on 12 December 1993 before the end of his 4-year term. He led the former Eastern Bloc&#x27;s longest lasting and most stable post-communist government. He was succeeded by Péter Boross as prime minister who led the cabinet until the 1994 parliamentary election, where MDF suffered a serious defeat from the Socialist Party, while Defence Minister Lajos Für replaced him as party leader. Antall was buried on 18 December 1993, the day of the funeral was declared a day of national mourning, his bier was erected in front of the Hungarian Parliament Building, where it was bidden farewell by Speaker György Szabad, writer András Sütő and titular abbot Pál Bolberitz. The funeral procession finished at Kerepesi Cemetery. His tomb was later erected by sculptor Miklós Melocco in 1999.

===The interruption of &quot;DuckTales&quot;===
The announcement of Antall&#x27;s death happened on a Sunday afternoon, during which the state television channel Magyar Televízió was airing a &quot;DuckTales&quot; episode called &quot;A Whale of a Bad Time&quot;, as part of &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot;; at 18:08, mid-cartoon the screen abruptly went black, after which the station logo was shown, and eventually Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s Funeral March began playing. The abrupt shift in tone has created a flashbulb memory for the generation of children watching, who as adults were still able to recall specific details of the event, down to the exact dialog where the interruption in the episode has occurred; some of the same adults have expressed their distaste in politics as a direct result of the interruption.

==Legacy==

In recognition of his work, one of the buildings of the European Parliament in Brussels was named after Antall in 2008. There is a bust of him on Apród Street in Budapest and a bust on the road named after him in Zagreb.

<text>Pectic acid, also known as polygalacturonic acid, is a water-soluble, transparent gelatinous acid existing in over-ripe fruit and some vegetables. It is a product of pectin degradation in plants, and is produced via the interaction between pectinase and pectin (the latter being common in the wine-making industry.) In the early stage of development of fruits, the pectic substance is a water-insoluble protopectin which is converted into pectin by the enzyme protopectinase during ripening of fruit. In over-ripe fruits, due to the presence of pectic methyl esterase enzyme, the pectin gets largely converted to pectic acid which is water-insoluble. Due to this reason both immature and over-ripe fruits are not suitable for making jelly and only ripe fruits are used.

<doc id="769914" wikidata="Q438329" url="?curid=769914" title="Henry B. Anthony">
<text>Henry Bowen Anthony (April 1, 1815 – September 2, 1884) was a United States newspaperman and political figure. He served as editor and was later part owner of the &quot;Providence Journal&quot;. He was the 21st Governor of Rhode Island, serving between 1849 and 1851 as a member of the Whig Party. Near the end of the 1850s, he was elected to the Senate by the Rhode Island Legislature and was re-elected 4 times. He would be twice elected to the Senate&#x27;s highest post as President pro tempore during the Grant administration, and served until his death in 1884.

==Early life==
The son of William Anthony and Mary Kennicut Greene, Anthony was born in Rhode Island. He attended Brown University, graduating in 1833 at the age of 18. After his graduation, he went to work as a broker in his brother&#x27;s cotton products firm, sometimes residing in Savannah, Georgia. He later invested in the firm when his father died in 1845 and earned a substantial income from his investment.

==Career==
He became editor of the &quot;Providence Journal&quot; in 1838. In 1840, he was admitted into the partnership, the paper then being published by Knowles, Vose &amp; Anthony until the death of Vose in 1848, when it was continued by Knowles &amp; Anthony until 1863, when it became Knowles, Anthony &amp; Danielson. Anthony also wrote poetry.

As editor of the &quot;Journal&quot;, Anthony was a conservative, supporting law and order, property requirements for voting, and restrictions on the political power of immigrants. In 1849, and again in 1850, he was elected governor of Rhode Island. As a Whig at the first election he had a majority of 1,556; at the second, fewer than 1,000 votes were cast against him. After declining a third election, he gave himself once more entirely to his editorial work.

In 1855, he traveled in Europe, sending letters with unfavorable observations back to the &quot;Journal&quot;. On returning, he joined the Know Nothing movement and used the &quot;Journal&quot; to back its American Party. In Rhode Island, the American Party merged into the Republican Party, and Anthony was elected to the United States Senate as an &quot;American-Republican.&quot;

==United States Senator==
Anthony served as a Republican Senator from Rhode Island from March 4, 1859, until his death on September 2, 1884. Initially conciliatory toward the secessionists, he was a strong supporter of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s efforts to restore the Union during the American Civil War. After the war, in recognition of his support for the Union, he was elected a third class (i.e. honorary) companion of the District of Columbia Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

He was twice the chairman of the committee on printing, his practical knowledge of that subject enabling him to introduce many reforms in government printing. The Government Printing Office was formed during his tenure. He was at different times a member of the committees on claims, on naval affairs, on mines and mining, and on post offices and post roads. In the trial of Andrew Johnson, he voted for impeachment. He continued to contribute to the &quot;Providence Journal&quot; during his service in the Senate.

He served as the President pro tempore of the United States Senate from 1869 to 1873 and again briefly in 1875. He gave up that post when he was elected conference chairman in 1875. As chair, Anthony acted much like the later majority leaders, giving committee assignments to members of his party, calling up bills for debate, and often speaking for his party on the issues of the day. He was also the author of the &quot;Anthony Rule,&quot; an early attempt to limit debate in the Senate in the days before cloture. He was known as the &quot;Father of the Senate&quot;. Mindful of Anthony&#x27;s age and infirmity, his colleagues accorded him special honor at the start of his fifth senatorial term in 1883:As the good old man stood with uplifted hand, every other member of the Senate rose, and stood until the obligation had been administered—a merited compliment to the &quot;Pater Senatus&quot;. No other man, save Thomas Hart Benton, had ever been sworn in five consecutive times as Senator.

== The Dorriad ==
While in his twenties, Anthony wrote a poetical burlesque satire of the events of the Dorr Rebellion, which was published without attribution in Boston by Justin Jones, 1842. Nearly three decades later, in 1870, it would be republished, again without attribution to Anthony, along with another work concerning the events (by others attributed, with Anthony), titled &quot;The Dorriad, and The Great Slocum Dinner&quot;, by Sidney S. Rider &amp; Brother, Providence.

==Death and legacy==
Anthony&#x27;s funeral, which took place from the First Congregational Church in Providence on 6 September 1884 was the largest funeral ever known in Rhode Island.

Anthony bequeathed a portion of his library, known as the &quot;Harris Collection of American Poetry,&quot; to Brown University. It consisted of about 6,000 volumes, mostly small books, many exceedingly rare. It was begun in the first half of the 19th century by Albert G. Greene, continued by Caleb Fiske Harris, and, after his death, completed by his kinsman Senator Anthony.

His name is engraved on a Civil War vintage artillery piece belonging to the Squantum Club in East Providence, Rhode Island. The artillery piece is reputed to have been the only gun from Battery A, 1st Rhode Island Light Artillery which did not fall into Confederate hands at the Battle of Bull Run. There is another nearly identical piece, known as the &quot;Bull Run Gun&quot;, enshrined at the Rhode Island State House for which is claimed the same distinction.

== Family ==
In 1837 Anthony married Sarah Aborn Rhodes, daughter of Christopher Rhodes of Pawtuxet. She died in 1854. They had no children, and he never remarried.

<text>Anton Florian (28 May 1656 – 11 October 1721) was the Prince of Liechtenstein between 1718 and 1721.

Anton Florian was born in Wilfersdorf, in what is now Lower Austria. During the War of the Spanish Succession, he went to Spain, where he was the Chief Intendant and Prime Minister of the Archduke Karl, who became Emperor Charles VI after the sudden death of his brother in 1711. Florian returned to Vienna for Charles&#x27;s coronation. He was the Obersthofmeister (Imperial Chief Intendant) and Chairman of the Secret Council until he died in 1721.

On 23 January 1719, Charles VI created the new principality of Liechtenstein from the domains of Seigneury of Schellenberg and County of Vaduz, which were both held by the Liechtenstein family. This was done so that Anton Florian could be admitted to the Reichstag, which required that all members had land that was subordinate only to the Emperor himself (as opposed to land held in fief by higher nobles). Thus, Anton Florian became the first Prince of Liechtenstein. 

Anton Florian was the 591st Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in Austria. He died in Vienna in 1721.

==Marriage and issue==
Anton Florian married Countess Eleonore Barbara Catharina von Thun und Hohenstein (4 May 1661 – 10 February 1723) on 15 October 1679. They had 11 children, most of whom died in early childhood:
* Prince Franz Augustin (1680–1681)
* Princess Eleonore (1681–1682)
* Princess Antonia Maria Eleonore (12 January 1683 – 19 December 1715)
* Prince Karl Joseph Florian (b. and d. 1685)
* Prince Anton Ignaz Joseph (1689–1690)
* Joseph Johann Adam, Prince of Liechtenstein (27 May 1690 – 17 December 1732)
* Prince Innozenz Franz Anton (1693–1707)
* Princess Maria Karoline Anna (23 August 1694 – 16 April 1735)
* Prince Karl Joseph (1697–1704)
* Princess Anna Maria Antonie (1699–1753); married her cousin, Joseph Wenzel I, Prince of Liechtenstein
* Princess Maria Eleonore (1703 – 18 July 1757); married Count Friedrich August von Harrach-Rohrau

<doc id="769932" wikidata="Q1937336" url="?curid=769932" title="Oak Park Heights Prison">
<text>Minnesota Correctional Facility – Oak Park Heights (MCF-OPH) is Minnesota&#x27;s only Level Five maximum security prison. The facility is located near the cities of Bayport and Stillwater. The facility is designed and employed with trained security officers to handle not only Minnesota&#x27;s high-risk inmates but other states&#x27; as well. They also have the largest contract to house federal inmates with serious, violent histories. The prison has never had an escape, and only one homicide.

==History==

The prison was designed by New York-based Gruzen &amp; Partners with Minnesota-based Winsor/Faricy Architects, and was featured in the April 1980 issue of &quot;Progressive Architecture&quot;, then the largest magazine on architecture.

Frank Wood, the warden of Minnesota Correctional Facility – Stillwater prison, offered input for the plan. Wood was also the first warden of the prison from 1982 until 1996 when he retired. After serving as warden at the Stillwater Prison, he was named the first warden at the Oak Park Heights Prison in 1980. At the time, it was still being built. He oversaw staffing and planning for the site, which opened two years later.

He was named deputy commissioner of institution services in 1992. Then in 1993, Gov. Arne Carlson appointed Wood commissioner. He was reappointed in 1995((pioneer press on line February 28, 2009)) .

In 2008, the Religious Resource Center at the Oak Park Heights Prison was named for Wood. Dennis Benson Wood&#x27;s Associate Warden replaced him Until he was appointed to the Warden of Stillwater Correctional facility in 1995 When Eric Skon was promoted to Warden of Oak Park heights. Then Woods Deputy Commissioner, James Bruton, became the warden from 1996 until 2001. Constructed in 1981 and opened in 1982 at a cost of $31.5million, Oak Park Heights is home to approximately 481 offenders. According to the Minnesota Department of Corrections, the prison&#x27;s nine complexes are &quot;specialized uniquely to help facilitate a safe, secure, and humane environment for the offenders incarcerated as well as the staff who work at Oak Park Heights&quot;.

Constructed in 1981, MCF-OPH is the state&#x27;s only Level-Five (Maximum) Custody Level prison for men, with an inmate population just under 350. The facility is home to some of the state&#x27;s most violent offenders, as well as many out-of-state commits and a few federal inmates.

==Design==

The prison is architecturally designed into the side of a hill to accommodate 481 inmates on a site, which is connected by two corridors on separate levels. One of the corridors is used only for the staff, while the other corridor is used primarily for offenders and staff traffic, while the other of this site are securely fenced in, with a large courtyard and baseball field in the center. The design places the cells on several underground levels. Inmate cells measure . Each cell contains a bed, table, toilet, and sink. The bed is a cement slab topped by a thin mattress. The toilet and sink are made of steel so they can&#x27;t be broken. Each cell also has one rectangular window that&#x27;s tall and thin. It is too narrow to escape through if the inmate could break the reinforced glass, and tests have proven it would take approximately twelve thousand hacksaw blades to cut through the steel bars of the prison. Not only does the prison provide a courtyard with a baseball field, but also includes an administration building, a religious resource room, gymnasium, security control center, staffed training fitness area, warehouses, a loading dock, and indoor firing range.

The prison is composed of nine self-sustaining living units, referred to as complexes. The first six complexes each house 52 offenders and include shower facilities and a common area used for recreation and meals. Offenders in these complexes range from those serving segregation time, to those who are in education toward a GED, or working full-time in the facility as cooks, janitors, painters, or workers in the institution&#x27;s industry units. MCF-OPH is home to the Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissary program. Inmates who qualify for these work programs are employed to process and package commissary orders from the other state correctional facilities.

Two of the three remaining complexes house the mental health unit (MHU) and the transitional care unit (TCU). The MHU and TCU both handle inmates from the entire Minnesota DOC who require the unique services of those units. The TCU serves inmates who need intensive nursing care, such as postsurgical care, and also serves as a hospice. The MHU works with individuals who are in a mental health crisis or individuals who have been civilly committed as mentally ill in addition to their criminal commitment.

The ninth unit, completed in 2001, is the state&#x27;s administrative control unit (ACU), sometimes referred to as &quot;Super-Seg&quot;. It houses the most violent offenders in an environment nearly completely free of physical contact with staff. Many of the offenders in the ACU have attempted to assault prison staff, or have engaged in a deadly assault on another inmate. Each cell is a self-contained living unit that includes sink, toilet, and shower. Each cell is accessed through two sets of doors, creating a sally port for each cell. Offenders are typically given access to an exercise room that is open to outside air for one hour each day.

The MCF-OPH facility, together with the H Unit of Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, Oklahoma, was featured in a one-hour TV documentary titled &quot;Maximum Security Prisons&quot;, produced by Alan Hall (Beyond Productions) for the &quot;On the Inside&quot; series of the Discovery Channel. National Geographic has also produced an episode of &quot;America&#x27;s Hardest Prisons&quot; on the Oak Park Heights Facility.

==Security==

Security in each complex is controlled from a two-story security glassed-in &quot;bubble&quot; that allows officers to open and close doors throughout the unit on both cell blocks and in the programming space on the level above the cell blocks. While the electronic controls in the bubble were state of the art in 1982, they were due to be replaced in 2010 with modern computer controlled updates. Another system that was to be updated in 2010 is the vibration sensors on the exterior fence. The original fence used high tech vibration sensing technology from Israel that is no longer manufactured or supported.

Because each complex is sectioned off from the rest of the prison by a bubble controlled sally port, only small numbers of offenders can enter the hallway connecting the complexes at any one time. The hallway itself has large steel &quot;sliders&quot; that can quickly close off each section of hallway should a complex need to be isolated.

The &quot;yard&quot; is fully within the walls of the prison, and armed officers patrol the top of the walls whenever prisoners are out. Outside of the prison building is a field surrounded by a double set of fences topped with razor wire. No prisoner has ever escaped.

== Etymology ==

The name &quot;Vejle&quot; derives from the Old Danish word &quot;wæthel&quot;, meaning &quot;ford&quot; or &quot;wading place&quot; due to its location at a busy crossing over the Vejle River.

=== Historical names ===

* Wæthel
* Wedel
* Vedel
* Weile
* Veile
* Vejle (Today)

== History ==

=== Origins ===

Vejle was originally built on a small Islet, that was surrounded by: Omløbsåen to the west, Mølleåen to the east, and Vejle River to the south. It was only after the Industrial Revolution, that the city expanded beyond the river borders.

During Viking times, the wetlands around Vejle had to be crossed at the Ravning Bridge, a nearly half-mile wooden boardwalk, west of the current city.

Archaeological digs near St. Nicolai Church in downtown Vejle have shown that there were residences in the area as far back as 1100. The first recorded mention of the town is from 1256, and the first known merchant town privileges were issued by King Valdemar III in 1327.

=== Middle ages ===
During the Middle Ages, Vejle was a prominent market town, it developed slowly only having small setbacks by the black death during the 14th century. Vejle has traditionally been trading with cities such as Lübeck, Aarhus and Flensburg, in the old duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, and other cities on the baltic coast.

Vejle used to be protected by two castles:

Castrum Wæthel (Vejleborg) (Vejle castle)

The Vejle castle was constructed out of wood, and laying just outside the city, where Vejle railway station is located today. It was constructed to protect the city and the Vejle River. The architecture of the castle indicate it was built in the 14th century, but by the year 1473 the castle had most likely been decommissioned. being turned into fields. The last remnants of the castle disappeared by the construction of the railway, in the 19th century.

Rosborg

Rosborg was located in the marshlands of the Vejle valley, located a couple hundred meters west of the city, it sat atop a manmade hill of around 1,75 meters in height, 40 meters long, and 25 meters wide. There had been multiple buildings in the castle, the oldest of these being seemingly made of wood,and possibly burning down, later making one of stone. During an excavation in 1912, there was found multiple sets of pottery from the Rhine, one with a very distinctive face of a bearded man.

=== Early modern period ===
In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, Vejle&#x27;s population was diminished as a consequence of plague and war. In 1796, though, Vejle was made the seat of the newly founded Vejle County.

=== Industrialisation ===

Throughout the 19th century, the town benefited from improvements such as a new harbour on the fjord, a railway station, and modern utilities. From the mid-19th century into the 20th century, Vejle developed from a provincial market town into a busy industrial centre, eventually becoming known as the &quot;Manchester of Denmark&quot; for its many cotton mills.

==Geography==
===Topography===

Downtown Vejle was built on an island of glacial till in Vejle River remaining from a hill formed during the last ice age.

In a country where the highest natural elevation is only about 170 m (558 ft) above sea level, Vejle is known for the forested hills that rise to the north and south of the town and fjord.

The valleys of the two rivers that converge at Vejle are both unique in Denmark: Vejle River Valley (&quot;Vejle Ådal&quot;) is the longest tunnel valley in Denmark, and the Grejs Valley (&quot;Grejsdalen&quot;) is the largest ravine in Denmark.

Both empty into Vejle Fjord, which connects Vejle by water through the Little Belt strait to the Baltic Sea, and through the Kattegat and Skagerrak straits to the Atlantic Ocean.

=== Cityscape ===

Development of new architecture, art and alternative town spaces throughout the 1990s has made the city an attraction. Vejle was the first city in Denmark, which had its own official architecture policy to set high standards for the urban development. The fjord is also the site of the modern wave-shaped apartment complex known as The Wave (&quot;Bølgen&quot;).

===Neighbourhoods===
Many of Vejle&#x27;s neighbourhoods began as separate towns or villages that merged with the city as it grew. Søndermarken, Nørremarken, and Grejsdalen, however, were all founded as extensions of the city onto the surrounding hillsides.

Vejle&#x27;s neighbourhoods include:
*Vejle centre
*Bredballe - east of downtown and north of Vejle Fjord; considered an affluent neighbourhood
*Grejsdalen - northernmost part of the city, located in the long, narrow valley of the same name
*Hover - west of Grejsdalen
*Lille Grundet - north of downtown in the northwest corner of Nørremarken, relatively new
*Løget - southernmost part of the city
*Store Grundet - established in 2000, north of Lille Grundet
*Mølholm - southeast of the centre
*Nørremarken - northeast of the centre, including the North Woods (&quot;Nørreskoven&quot;) and Vejle Stadium
*Uhrhøj, Uhre, Petersminde
*Vinding - southeast, next to Mølholm
*Skibet, Knabberup - westernmost part of the city
*Søndermarken - to the southwest, located on land belonging to the former Petersholm manor
*Trædballe - north-west corner of centre

==Economy==
Vejle is the cultural and economic centre of Vejle Municipality and, as part of the unofficial Triangle Area (&quot;Trekantområde&quot;), is rich in industry, business, and the service sector. Historically speaking, industry has been very important for the city&#x27;s development, while today more weight is placed on business and service, as well as high-tech firms.

===Industry===
During the Industrial Revolution, Vejle was known as the &quot;Manchester of Denmark&quot; due to its extensive textile mills. The local rivers provided water power to mills, including the extensive facilities of De Danske Bomuldsspinderier (The Danish Cotton Mills). In the first half of the 20th century, Vejle was something of a behemoth within the Danish textile industry, with some 25% of the city&#x27;s workers employed in the industry.
Despite the decline in the industry in Denmark, the last cotton mill in Vejle remained open until 1993. Today, many of the old mill buildings are used for art studios, office space, and, more recently, apartments.

In 1975 United Trailer Factories was founded by brothers Niels and Jens Buhl. The company, now known as ‘Variant’ like its products, has grown in strength to become one of the biggest quality trailer manufacturers in Europe.

Later on, newer industries took root in Vejle. The city is home to one of the largest chewing gum factories in the world, producing Stimorol brand chewing gum.

The Tulip slaughterhouses were also an important employer in the city. Today, Tulip has closed its factory at the harbour, but still maintains production in northern Vejle.

Today, Vejle&#x27;s economy is shifting out of the industrial sector and into the high-tech sector, with a number of software companies operating out of the city.

===Shopping===

Vejle is known regionally as a vibrant shopping town with various chain and specialty shops primarily located along the city&#x27;s central pedestrian street. Recently, the town has invested in several public works projects to improve the city&#x27;s appearance, including lengthening the pedestrian Street, developing new public art and architecture, and uncovering and beautifying Grejs River, which until recently ran in a culvert underneath downtown.
In addition to the shopping experiences in the city, Vejle also has its own shopping centre, the Bryggen shopping centre, located in the center of the city. It contains 38 stores and two restaurants and lies within the pedestrian street.

Street food concepts can also be experienced at the Paladspassagen Social Dining at the former Mary&#x27;s Shoppingcenter.

==Government and politics==
Vejle is located in and is the seat of Vejle Municipality which in its current configuration was formed under the Municipal Reform of 2007. Vejle&#x27;s municipal council consists of 31 members, elected every four years.

Ever since Social Democrat Christian Jacobsen became Vejle&#x27;s first elected mayor in 1919, the town has been a stronghold for the Social Democrats and trade unions. The longest serving Social Democratic mayor was Willy Sørensen, a union leader who joined the city council in 1937 and held the mayor&#x27;s post for 31 years, from 1946 until his death in 1978.

In 1993, the Social Democratic dynasty was broken, when a candidate from a coalition of opposition parties, Flemming Christiansen, became mayor. In 2009, the Social Democrats were out of power again when Liberal candidate Arne Sigtenbjerggaard won the elections.

Several natives of Vejle have also made a career in national politics, including former Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen (Liberal), the former Minister of the Treasury Troels Lund Poulsen (Liberal), former Minister of Health Torben Lund (Social Democrat), and former Minister of Transportation Flemming Hansen (Conservative).

==Transportation and Infrastructure==
Historically speaking, Vejle&#x27;s development has been guided by the city&#x27;s central location in the country and its location on Vejle Fjord. Vejle&#x27;s pedestrian street today runs along the same course as some of the earliest paths through town – glass panels set into Torvegade allow pedestrians to see the historical market road a few meters under the current street surface.

The European route E45 motorway passes close to downtown Vejle on the Vejle Fjord Bridge. Vejle is also known for motorway exit 59, also called Exxit 59, where few fast food chains such as KFC, McDonald&#x27;s Enzo &amp; C are located here, and the motorway exit is also known for carpooling. The Exit 59 is also known to be called Gateaway E45, because of its huge cargo- and transportation center, called Denmarks Transport Center, DTC.

Vejle is also located on Primary Route 28, and the Mid-Jutland Highway (&quot;Midjyske Motorvej&quot;, Primary Route 18) from Herning.
 () is the principal transport hub for public transport in Vejle, which provides nine city bus lines to various neighbourhoods, as well as national and international coach and train services. 

Vejle railway station first opened in 1868, and is today a central station in the Danish train network.

Vejle railway station is also a hub for merging two railway lines. The East Jutland railway, from Aarhus to Vejle, and The Central Jutland railway, from Struer to Vejle . From Vejle going south or east, the next main train station, is Fredericia station. Here the trains can depart to either Copenhagen through Odense station, to Esbjerg through Kolding railway station, or to Hamburg in Germany, also through Kolding railway station.

However, the station is currently the subject of political debate, due to a desire on the part of some politicians to reduce train travel time between Odense and Århus to one hour. This may mean that a second bridge will be built over Vejle Fjord, bypassing Vejle Station.
The Port of Vejle, in its current location, was inaugurated in 1827. In the years following World War II, it grew to become the second largest port in Denmark after the Port of Copenhagen. Up until 1932, the steamboats Hvidbjerg (named after a local seaside community) and Jeppe Jensen (named after the harbour&#x27;s founder) plied the waters between Vejle Harbour and Munkebjerg, Tirsbæk, Ulbækhus, and Fakkegrav. The harbour is currently profitable, although there are plans to convert the northern section of the harbour into a park and residential area, which would reconnect the town with the fjord.

Vejle Municipality is part-owner of Denmark&#x27;s second-largest airport, Billund Airport, located near the Lego Group&#x27;s headquarters some from the centre of Vejle. Airport buses run regularly to Billund Airport from Vejle Transit Centre.

==Environment==
A central point of Vejle&#x27;s environmental policy since 1985 has been the sorting of garbage into non-compostable and compostable waste, which is then composted in the city dump. To this end, residents must place all household trash into either black or green bags.

Vejle Municipality has also begun a range of nature restoration projects. The most ambitious of these has been the restoration of the Kongens Kær wetlands around the Vejle River just outside the city limits. The city has also undertaken a project to establish two new public beaches for swimming, Albuen and Tirsbæk Strand.

==Education==

Vejle is home to the headquarters of University College Lillebælt, which is a merger of several educational institutions in East Jutland and Funen.

As Vejle is home to many international industrial companies and is also known to be called &quot;the Silicon Valley of Denmark&quot; due to a lot IT companies located in Vejle. The government, after a lot of negotiations back in 2021, came to an agreement in 2024 with Vejle Municipality, University of Southern Denmark that Vejle from 2026 will become a university city. 
The University of Southern Denmark,SDU, will establish a campus housing the faculty of IT and software. 
The Lego Group will also be one of among many companies to enter as cooperation partners with SDU, for the purpose of gaining a strong research- and educational environment in Vejle

Vejle Boldklub has trained many talented football players, among others one of Danish football history&#x27;s few international stars: Allan Simonsen, who in 1977 became the first Danish player to win the European Footballer of the Year award. Today, Vejle Boldklub is in a ramping-up period, with the goal of bringing the club back to the top of Danish football. To this end, new Vejle Stadium was opened in spring 2008.

Vejle&#x27;s largest indoor sports facilities are mostly housed in the DGI-Huset recreational centre in western Vejle. In the past, the facility has housed several high-profile events, including the European Women&#x27;s Handball Championship and the Danish Open in badminton.

In the early and mid-20th century, Vejle had several popular cultural destinations such as Trædballehus in the western part of town and the Munkebjerg Casino south of the fjord.

Trædballehus, an inn and music venue, which burned down in 1954, got its big breakthrough in the mid-1930s when it was featured on Danish National Radio in connection with the opening of the old Little Belt Bridge. 1933 Hotel Munkebjerg boasted Europe&#x27;s longest wooden escalator, carrying guests from the fjord-side beach up to the hilltop casino. Munkebjerg still exists as a hotel, casino and conference centre.

Vejle Mill, located on top of the cliff at Søndermarken, is a well-known landmark because of its visibility, and is often used as a symbol of the city.

The Old Jail House in Vejle, which is connected to the Town Hall, was rebuilt in 1984 and received a prize for beautification.

Vejle&#x27;s oldest extant building, St. Nicolai Church, was built in the mid-13th century. On display in the church is the Haraldskær bog woman, a body from the Iron Age that was preserved with its skin intact in a local peat bog. Another feature of the church are 23 spherical indentations on the north transept – legend says these are imprints of the skulls of executed robbers from the woods that surround Vejle.

Among the city&#x27;s cultural institutions is the renovated and expanded Vejle Museum of Art. The museum features the Wörzner collection with several COBRA works as well as works by Rembrandt. Today, Vejle Town Museum is located in the renovated Spinning Mill.

<doc id="769945" wikidata="Q718225" url="?curid=769945" title="Sourou-Migan Apithy">
<text>Sourou-Migan Marcellin Joseph Apithy (8 April 1913 – 3 December 1989) was a Beninese political figure most active when his country was known as Dahomey. He arose on a political scene where one&#x27;s power was dictated by what region in Dahomey one lived in.

Apithy studied at Bordeaux in a Lycée or secondary school. After he completed his studies there, he was accepted at the public Political Science School in Paris where he took courses in commercial studies. He later worked at a French company in Western Africa as an expert accountant. Before his country acquired its independence, beginning 1945, he was part of Dahomey&#x27;s Constitutive Assembly and was re-elected for a number of terms. When Hubert Maga nominated him to that function, he was also the prime minister of Dahomey (Benin) from 1957 to 1958. By 1960, he had become Vice President of Dahomey.

He served as the 2nd President of Dahomey between 25 January 1964 and 27 November 1965, when he was overthrown by Christophe Soglo after infighting among the members of the government. After this event he fled to Paris for the first time but he returned to Cotonou after the 1970 coup, when he became a member of the Presidential Triumvirate during the early 1970s. Following the 1972 coup, he was put under arrest alongside Justin Ahomadegbé-Tomêtin and Maga, and was not released until 1981.

He was sometimes referred to as being part of the &#x27;three-headed monster&#x27; of the 1960s in Benin. He died in exile in his Paris house, in December 1989, shortly before the transition to democracy in his country.

==Early life==

Born on 8 April 1913 in Porto-Novo, Apithy was a descendant of an Ogu royal family though was not born into privilege himself. His middle name, Migan, signified familial ties with chief ministers of old Dahomeyan kingdoms. He began his education at local mission schools and gained a bias for Roman Catholicism, for which he would later be insulted. Apithy would later become assistant teacher at his school. To further his education, Apithy travelled to Paris in 1933. After legal and economic studies at the Free School of Political Sciences, the National School of Economic and Social Organization, and at the Improvement Center in Business Administration of the Paris Chamber of Commerce, Apithy gained his diploma in accounting.

He also served as counsel in Paris and Dakar appeal courts. Married, he fathered two children. Having voluntarily enlisted in the army, Apithy saw combat from 1939 to 1940 as an artillery officer. He would not return to Dahomey until 1945. Shortly after his return Francis Aupiais, a well-liked Roman Catholic pastor, encouraged Apithy to pursue a career in politics. It began in July, when the latter was a participant in the Monnerville Commission.

Running as a Socialist candidate, Apithy was elected to represent Togo and Dahomey at the French Constituent Assembly in 1945, receiving 6,600 votes out of a total of 9,057. Voters in the election had to be French citizens or Dahomeyans whom the French government deemed responsible. His nomination as a candidate for the Assembly was a strategic move on the part of the Europeans; they wished to elect a black person to appease their colonists, while they still held full power. Nonetheless, Apithy did pass some legislation at the Assembly, including the February 1946 formation of a secondary school in Porto Novo. Apithy was said to have ended slavery in Dahomey, although in fact he was not involved with the abolition bill. He was named a member of the Commission on Overseas Territories and debated on the political situation of the overseas departments and territories of France. In June 1946, he was re-elected to his post with 8,096 ballots of 9.069 cast, and was soon appointed attorney general of Dahomey.

Thereafter Apithy was named to several political posts, all while a member of Dahomey&#x27;s only political party, the Dahomeyan Progressive Union (UPD). He was the choice for vice president of the Rassemblement Democratique Africain (RDA), though left the organization shortly afterwards when facing Catholic opposition. The year 1946 also marked his entry into the General Council, becoming one of its inaugural 30 representatives.

In the November 1946 French National Assembly elections, Apithy ran under the ticket of Section Française de l&#x27;Internationale Ouvrière (SFIO). Winning 32,977 votes out of 33,605 cast, he captured Dahomey&#x27;s sole seat allotted at the Assembly. His only opponent, Emile Poisson, left the race the day before the election.

==Deputy to the French National Assembly==
One of Apithy&#x27;s first actions in Paris was naming his membership with the Commissions on Methods of Communication, Economic Affairs, and Finances. After joining the Grand Council of French West Africa (AOF) in 1947, the new deputy proposed a bill on its functions. He also suggested the creation of a bank covering the AOF and Togo, and due to his efforts this bill was passed into law. In 1949, he became secretary of the National Assembly and frequently answered questions regarding the AOF and overseas territories during his first term.

In the legislative elections of 17 June 1951, Dahomey was allowed an additional representative in the Assembly. Apithy faced a new opponent: northern teacher Hubert Maga. The fact that two seats were allotted to Dahomey was only known in the last week of April. As per an electoral law of May 1951, each candidate had to give the names of another who would occupy the second seat in the event that the other party&#x27;s first candidate came in third or below. Apithy chose Emile Derlin Zinsou as his running mate, with Apithy leading on the electoral list as of a meeting on 29 April. However, Zinsou argued that he would be forced to vacate seat on the Assembly of the French Union and that someone from the north of Dahomey would be able to fill it. Therefore, on 23 May it was decided that Zinsou and Apithy would be listed in that order. Maga, meanwhile, chose northern merchant Paul Darboux and the latter was content as second on the list.

Zinsou and Apithy, in stark contrast to their northern rivals, could not agree on who would headline the list. It reached a point, on 27 May, that the two southern candidates decided to run individually: Zinsou campaigned with school teacher Gilbert Kpakpo, while Apithy partnered with French administrator Edouard Dunglas under the newly formed Union Francaise. Maga and Darboux capitalised on growing cynicism regarding southern Dahomey dominating the French colony&#x27;s politics, allying themselves with the northern tribes.

The May 1951 law also enlarged the electorate from 61,958 to 333,693. Some dead people were even counted as electors due to the mishandling of election cards. The Cotonou newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Etoile du Dahomey&quot; noted the presence of a man who would give an unlimited number of cards as long as they promised to vote for Apithy. Altogether, however, only 44% of the population voted on election day. Apithy was reelected a deputy with 53,463 votes out of 147,350 cast. Maga captured the second seat with 49,329, with Zinsou/Kpakpo receiving a mere 18,410 ballots. Several smaller parties hosted several other candidates, which received the rest of the votes. Only 2.2 percent of Apithy&#x27;s votes came from the northern region, while 64 percent came from the Porto Novo metropolitan area.

The 1951 election illustrated the intense regionalism that was forming in the French colony; the election has been cited as when regionalist parties arose. Indeed, it was the first whose pamphlets mentioned ethnicity. Regionalism in Dahomey was spurred by the historical resentment shared by members of the former kingdoms of Abomey, Porto Novo, and disorganised tribes from the north. Its result was the creation of three &quot;de facto&quot; tribal zones: the north, southeast, and southwest, which were led by Maga, Apithy, and Justin Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, respectively. Most of Apithy&#x27;s backing came from the Yoruba, while Maga was mostly backed by the Bariba and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, the Fon and Gouns. Regionalistic attitudes would only intensify during the rest of the political careers of the three men, collectively known as Dahomey&#x27;s triumvirate.

Apithy renamed his party the Parti Républicain du Dahomey (PRD) in July. The party won a majority of seats in the March 1952 Territorial Assembly election. Apithy, meanwhile, was busy passing a bill regarding fiscal advantages in metropolitan enterprises in overseas territories. He was a political opportunist, frequently switching allegiances if it fit his needs.

On 2 January 1956 elections to the French National Assembly were held, with Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin replacing Zinsou as the main third-party candidate. As in 1951, the running mates were from the same regions as the main candidate so as to draw loyalty to a particular party, in Maga&#x27;s case the Dahomeyan Democratic Movement (MDD), and Dahomeyan Democratic Union (UDD) for Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin. Apithy chose Djibodé Aplogan, Maga chose Gaustin Gbaguidi, and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin was paired with Alexandre Adandé. Apithy and Maga were reelected deputies with 64,344 and 60,601 votes, respectively, out of the 179,119 cast.

The senior deputy was named a member of the Commission on Overseas Territories and the Commission of Accountancy; he was elected vice-president of the former, and secretary of the latter. He proposed a resolution to create a regimen for a customs union between Dahomey and Togo, and several reports under the Commission on Overseas Territories. Apithy also served a variety of functions not related to the Assembly, such as being elected mayor of Porto-Novo in 1956. Shortly after becoming president of the General Council of the AOF in 1957, Apithy was voted into the presidency of the Territorial Assembly of Dahomey. He also led a parliamentary group for relations between France and Liberia.

==Premier of Dahomey==
Apithy was elected Premier of Dahomey in 1958. He was Minister of Finance in 1960, and from October 1963 to January 1964.

==Presidential council==

===Background and 1970 election===
On 10 December 1969 Emile Derlin Zinsou was overthrown by Maurice Kouandété, who had installed him as president in the first place. The military, however, refused to recognize Kouandété, and as the two men could not reach agreement, a Military Directorate was established with Paul Emile de Souza as its chairman. An election was held on 28 March 1970 to determine the true president. On this occasion, the triumvirate was allowed to campaign, and they did not miss the chance. Intimidation and bribery were commonplace, and the electoral campaign saw the comeback of regional loyalties. It was also marked by a series of violent outbursts; invalidated reports state that six people were killed or wounded at incidents in Parakou on the eve of the elections. Fellow candidate Zinsou asserted that Maga supporters had killed one of his supporters during said incidents.

These charges did not affect Maga&#x27;s standing in the polls; he received a majority of the vote in the north, and Apithy and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin received a majority in the southeast and southwest/central, respectively. The election results were as follows: 252,551 citizens voted for Maga; 200,091 for Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, and 186,332 for Apithy. In the entire south, Maga received 24,000 votes compared to the 180,000 who voted for him in the Borgou Department, obtaining 97.3 percent of the 78 percent turnout. Zinsou, running to counter the constant tribal clashes, received 3 percent, with 17,551 votes.

Nonetheless, de Souza decided to nullify the results from Atakora, the region where Maga received the most votes, on 3 April. Outraged, Maga formed the Assembly of the Peoples of the North, which threatened to secede unless he was declared President. He refused to leave his campaign headquarters at Parakou even to attend political meetings. Maga&#x27;s reaction to the nullification prompted many southern workers to flee the north. Apithy stated that he would convince his region to join Nigeria if Maga took the presidency and took steps to bribe his way into that office. Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin claimed Maga had defrauded the electoral system to his advantage. In contrast with the other three former presidents, Zinsou admitted that he had been defeated and decided participate in bargaining, explaining that he rejected the idea of a coalition &quot;for personal reasons&quot;. The other former Presidents, on the other hand, agreed to a hasty compromise on 13 April to prevent a civil war.

===Under Maga===
A presidential council, consisting of Maga, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, and Apithy, was set up on 7 May with a presidency that changed every two years. Maga inaugurated this system for the first two years. Each man agreed to not use the military to extend their term or use any other means toward that consequence. If decisions were not unanimous during the first round of voting, a two councilman majority would suffice on the second round. The council served as the executive and legislative branch of Dahomey.

The cabinet was composed of four Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin allies, three Maga allies, and three allies of Apithy. Gabriel Lozes, appointed minister of finance; Theophile Paoletti, new minister of information and tourism; Edmond Doussou-Yovo, minister of education; and Karl Ahouansou, minister of communication, were all friends of Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin. Maga&#x27;s colleagues in the cabinet were Pascal Chabi Kao, minister of finance; Albert Ouassa, minister of health; and Chabi Mama, minister of rural development; while Apithy friends were Ambroise Agboton, minister of labor; Joseph Keke, minister of economy and planning; and Michel Toko, minister of justice and guardian of the seals. Daouda Badarou, who had served as foreign minister under Zinsou, was allowed to keep his job.

Maga&#x27;s economic policies during his chairmanship helped quiet union leaders whose protests during his presidency had been intense. He helped create a tax plan that would finance their salaries by cutting expenditures and cracking down on tax evasion. In 1970 Dahomey witnessed a surplus of 429 million CFA francs, rising to a 570 million CFA franc surplus the following year. With the national economy in a favorable position, Apithy and the rest of the council could afford a number of luxuries, including three houses and three Mercedes-Benz 300 automobiles to be shared amongst themselves, and festivals for the anniversary of the founding of the triumvirate.
The Council lost popularity with the Kutuklui Affair. By decree of Apithy and the rest of the council, Togolese opposition leader Noe Kutuklui was officially expelled from Dahomey on 27 October 1971, where he had been practicing law since the late 1960s. It was at the request of General Etienne Eyadema, president of Togo, as Kutuklui had been involved in several plots against Eyadema&#x27;s military government. The council&#x27;s decision to extradite him spurred demonstrations in Cotonou. Maga was unable to carry out his decision; Alphonse Alley protected Kutuklui and took him to an unknown place outside of Dahomey. Col. Alley received no punishment whatsoever for his role in the affair.

Students were some of those involved in the protests, and they soon had another reason to conflict with their government. On 5 November 1971 Apithy and his administration shut down the Union Général des Etudiants et Eleves de Dahomey (UGEED), a radical youth group which sought to &quot;transform Dahomey into a battlefield&quot; using &quot;workers, soldiers, and policemen.&quot; This stemmed from UGEED-sponsored demonstrations against the minister of education when he failed to attend an educational meeting. Students whose schools followed the strike were allowed back to school on 19 November, and only if their parents signed documents that said they would not participate in more demonstrations. If they failed to comply, they would be expelled from the educational system of Dahomey. Government-instituted rallies were arranged to support the ban.

The military was also aroused. The formation of a presidential council only further enraged the army. Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin was ambushed while traveling to a rally in Abomey on 7 May 1971. Maga initially denied its existence, and to this day details are unclear. An artillery camp at Ouidah was the location of another military uprising on 28 January 1972. The president sent two officers to overpower the rebels although no punishment was undertaken. Both Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin and Maga believed that the latter incident was an attempted coup.

Kouandété attempted to usurp power again at dawn on 23 February. When he first heard of the mutiny, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin believed that it was an attempt by Maga to remain in power. Leading the Ouidah garrison, Kouandété also attempted to take over government buildings and murder de Souza. Over the course of the operation, assailant Major Moumouni was mortally wounded by de Souza&#x27;s bullets. The plot was foiled, although Maga canceled a visit to France to attend to the matter at hand. A 12-member military commission would soon discover another plot, that would have been undertaken simultaneous to Kouandété&#x27;s. According to its findings, Captains Glele and Pierre Boni were going to follow Kouandété until de Souza was assassinated, when they would eradicate their leader and insert Zinsou back into power. The recent events epitomised the council&#x27;s &quot;fear and contempt&quot; for the military.

===Under Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin===
Maga transferred power to Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin on 7 May 1972. This was the first time in 12 years that the head of Dahomey was succeeded in a nonmilitary fashion. The new chairman congratulated Maga and praised the triumvirate as &quot;one of [Dahomey&#x27;s] most beneficial institutions.&quot; It was believed that the triumvirate would continually undermine each other, and the simple transition of power was viewed as a positive step toward Dahomeyan unity.

The Presidential Council was slow in organizing a military trial for the 1972 coup plotters, and it did not begin until 12 May. The court tried 21 men besides Kouandété, mostly military officers but also including several commoners and even Maga bodyguards. The punishments were announced on 16 May. Kouandété received the death penalty, as did Captains Josué and Glélé, Quartermaster Sergeant Agboton, and a corporal and a sergeant &quot;in absentia&quot;. Lesser sentences were handed to five men who were given life imprisonment, two who would serve 20 years in prison, another with 15 years, two with ten, and two with five. An additional four were acquitted. The sentences were never carried out; the jurors believed that Kouandété would seize power in another coup.

Another delayed function of the council was the formation of the Assemblée Consultative Nationale, an advisory assembly required by the 1970 constitution. As per the constitution, such an assembly would contain 30 members advising councilmen on economic, social, and other issues, with Paul Darboux presiding. It was not established until July 1972, due to, in the words of academic Samuel Decalo, &quot;intensive horse-trading between the partners in the Presidential Council ... and pressures from their political lieutenants for a position in the Assembly.&quot;

One of the most notable aspects of Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin&#x27;s time in power was the Kovacs Affair. It began with Pascal Chabi Kao being given a monopoly over selling official stationery to the Presidential Council and spread to claims of bribery and embezzlement. Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin tried to fire Chabi Kao, but Maga, who was Chabi Kao&#x27;s mentor, refused. Maga convinced Apithy to help and the bill was vetoed.
Another coup was launched by soldiers of the Ouidah garrison on 26 October. This one, however, was successful, and Major Mathieu Kérékou was installed as president. It occurred during a cabinet meeting between Maga and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin. Kérékou had served as Maga&#x27;s aide-de-camp in 1961. According to reports at the scene, soldiers abruptly arrived in the Cabinet room of the presidential palace and started firing bullets, but no one was injured. Kérékou called the triumvirate &quot;truly a monster&quot; as it showed &quot;unpardonable incompetence&quot;, amongst other charges which were used to justify the coup. Kouandété was pardoned, although the former council was not. Maga, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, and Apithy spent more than nine years in prison before being freed by Kérékou in 1981.

==Later life and death==
After being released on amnesty, Apithy moved to Paris, where he lived out the rest of his life. On 3 December 1989 he died. Just days afterward, Kerekou proclaimed the end to socialism in Dahomey (renamed Benin in 1975), which he had established in November 1974.

<text>Jason Michael Bosak Diakité (born 11 January 1975 in Lund), known under the stage name Timbuktu, is a Swedish rapper and singer.

==Biography==
Timbuktu is the son of Madubuko Diakité, a U.S. born Swedish human rights lawyer and academic.

Timbuktu started his career in the mid-1990s as part of the rap group Excel before going solo as Timbuktu. The inspiration for the pseudonym comes from the city of Timbuktu in Mali, where his father&#x27;s family originally comes from.

Jason “Timbuktu” Diakité is one of Sweden’s most well-known and respected hip-hop artists. He released his first music in 1996 and has since released 10 solo albums and numerous singles of which the vast majority have reached Gold or Platinum status. His accolades also include eight Swedish Grammy awards, and four P3 Guld (Swedish radio) awards. Timbuktu’s highly acclaimed most recent album, &quot;Du Gamla Du Nya&quot;, came out in 2021. On it he collaborated with Chords, Patrick Collén and Mapei, among others. On the back of this, Timbuktu released a new single with Sabina Ddumba called “Bygga Nytt” and collaborated with Mapei and Pontus Winnberg to create the children&#x27;s song collection &quot;Lullabies&quot;. In 2023 Timbuktu was the first Swedish artist to appear as a guest on the Norwegian version of &quot;Så Mycket Bättre&quot;, called &quot;Hver Gang Vi Møtes&quot; after being one of very few artists to do the Swedish edition twice. Alongside his good friend, chef Marcus Samuelsson, Timbuktu also created the podcast &quot;This Moment&quot;, featuring guests like Al Gore, Margot Wallström and Alice Bah Kuhnke.

In 2016 Jason released his first book, the critically acclaimed “En Droppe Midnatt” (&quot;A Drop of Midnight&quot;). It has sold more than 130,000 copies in Sweden and it entered the sales charts in both Sweden and Norway. A subsequent edition came out in English through Amazon Publishing. In &quot;A Drop of Midnight&quot; Jason tracks his family&#x27;s history from the slave plantations in South Carolina to the welfare state Sweden. It&#x27;s a gripping tale of ancestry, identity, resistance, racism and a longing to belong. In the fall of 2017 &quot;En Droppe Midnatt&quot; was turned into a hugely successful stage performance that played to full houses in both Sweden and Norway. On June 6th, 2022 the American version, “A Drop of Midnight”, opened at Harlem Stage in New York and played for six consecutive evenings. Then, on January 17, 2024, they showcased &quot;A Drop of Midnight&quot; in New York in conjunction with APAP, the largest conference in the USA for theater producers.

Timbuktu has continued to evolve as a writer, and his book about meat sauce, written with Joel Åhlin and Harald Wachtmeister, gained a lot of attention. He also continued to explore children&#x27;s literature with Matilda Westerman and collaborated with Michael Bekele to create the audio drama &quot;Härifrån&quot;, which won a Guldöra in 2023. In April 2024, the first TV series in which Jason has a major acting role, &quot;Allt och Eva&quot; (Warner Bros/Viaplay), will be released.

Timbuktu has hosted several shows on national Swedish radio like the music aid (radio and television show) Musikhjälpen from its start in 2008 until 2012, he received a Nordic language award and performed for audiences all over the world, from various corners of Africa to Svalbard, from the legendary the Apollo Theatre in NYC to the Roxy Theatre in LA, at the Polar Music Prize and at the Nobel Peace Prize. In 2023, Jason was appointed an honorary doctor by Lund University for his innovative authorship and versatile artistic work, capturing and reflecting on essential aspects of humanistic thought and research.

<doc id="769956" wikidata="Q422606" url="?curid=769956" title="Didanosine">
<text>Didanosine, sold under the brand name Videx among others, is a medication used to treat HIV/AIDS. It is used in combination with other medications as part of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). It is of the reverse-transcriptase inhibitor class.
Didanosine was first described in 1975 and approved for use in the United States in 1991.

==Adverse effects==
The most common adverse events with didanosine are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, headache, and rash. Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 21-26% of participants in key didanosine trials.

Pancreatitis is rarely observed but has caused occasional fatalities, and has black box warning status. Other reported serious adverse events are retinal changes, optic neuritis and alterations of liver functions. The risk of some of these serious adverse events is increased by drinking alcohol.

In February 2010, the United States Food and Drug Administration issued a statement that patients using didanosine (Videx) are at risk for a rare but potentially fatal liver disorder, non-cirrhotic portal hypertension.

==Drug interactions==
*A significant interaction has also been recorded with allopurinol, and administration of these drugs together should be avoided.
*Reduction in indinavir and delavirdine plasma levels have been shown to occur when administered simultaneously with didanosine; these drugs should be administered at different times.
*Ketoconazole, itraconazole, ciprofloxacin should be administered at a different time from didanosine due to interactions with the buffering agent.
*Administration with drugs with overlapping toxicity, such as zalcitabine and stavudine, is not recommended.
*Alcohol can exacerbate didanosine&#x27;s toxicity, and avoiding drinking alcohol while taking didanosine is recommended.

==Resistance==
Drug resistance to didanosine does develop, though slower than to zidovudine (ZDV). The most common mutation observed &quot;in vivo&quot; is L74V in the viral &quot;pol&quot; gene, which confers cross-resistance to zalcitabine; other mutations observed include K65R and M184V .

==Mechanism of action==
Didanosine (ddI) is a nucleoside analogue of adenosine. It differs from other nucleoside analogues, because it does not have any of the regular bases, instead it has hypoxanthine attached to the sugar ring. Within the cell, ddI is phosphorylated to the active metabolite of dideoxyadenosine triphosphate, ddATP, by cellular enzymes. Like other anti-HIV nucleoside analogs, it acts as a chain terminator by incorporation and inhibits viral reverse transcriptase by competing with natural dATP.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Oral absorption of didanosine is fairly low (42%) but rapid. Food substantially reduces didanosine bioavailability, and the drug should be administered on an empty stomach. The half-life in plasma is only 1.5 hours, but in the intracellular environment more than 12 hours. An enteric-coated formulation is now marketed as well. Elimination is predominantly renal; the kidneys actively secrete didanosine, the amount being 20% of the oral dose.

==History==
The related pro-drug of didanosine, 2′,3′-dideoxyadenosine (ddA), was initially synthesized by Morris J. Robins (professor of Organic Chemistry at Brigham Young University) and R.K. Robins in 1964. Subsequently, Samuel Broder, Hiroaki Mitsuya, and Robert Yarchoan in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) found that ddA and ddI could inhibit HIV replication in the test tube and conducted initial clinical trials showing that didanosine had activity in patients infected with HIV. On behalf of the NCI, they were awarded patents on these activities. Since the NCI does not market products directly, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded a ten-year exclusive license to Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMS) to market and sell ddI as Videx tablets.

Didanosine became the second drug approved for the treatment of HIV infection in many other countries, including in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 9 October 1991. Its FDA approval helped bring down the price of zidovudine (ZDV), the initial anti-HIV drug. 

Didanosine has weak acid stability and is easily damaged by stomach acid. Therefore, the original formula approved by the FDA used chewable tablets that included an antacid buffering compound to neutralize stomach acid. The chewable tablets were not only large and fragile, they also were foul-tasting and the buffering compound would cause diarrhea. Although the FDA had not approved the original formulation for once-a-day dosing it was possible for some people to take it that way.

At the end of its ten-year license, BMS re-formulated Videx as Videx EC and patented that, which reformulation the FDA approved in 2000. The new formulation is a smaller capsule containing coated microspheres instead of using a buffering compound. It is approved by the FDA for once-a-day dosing. Also at the end of that ten-year period, the NIH licensed didanosine to Barr Laboratories under a non-exclusive license, and didanosine became the first generic anti-HIV drug marketed in the United States.

One of the patents for ddI expired in the United States on 29 August 2006, but other patents extend beyond that time.

<text>The Minnesota Correction Facility – Stillwater (MCF-STW) is a close custody (level 4) state prison for men in Bayport, Minnesota, United States. Built 1910–1914, it houses 1,600 inmates in seven different living areas. Additionally, approximately 100 inmates are housed in a nearby minimum security area. It replaced the original Minnesota Territorial Prison located just to the north in the city of Stillwater, Minnesota. Until recent expansion of the medium custody (level 3) Minnesota Correctional Facility – Faribault, MCF-STW was the state&#x27;s largest facility by inmate population. A historic district consisting of 22 contributing properties was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 as the State Prison Historic District for having state-level significance in architecture. It was nominated for being one of the nation&#x27;s earliest and most influential appearances of the &quot;telephone pole&quot; layout, with a large main hallway connecting each of the units, that was widely adopted by high-security prisons. MCF-STW is noted for its award-winning publication &quot;The Prison Mirror&quot;, the oldest continuously-operated prison newspaper in the United States.

==History==
The idea for the creation of the original Minnesota State Prison at Stillwater came in February 1851 as part of legislation dealing with territories. However, the prison did not start receiving inmates until two years later in March 1853, which was still five years before Minnesota was inducted into statehood. At the beginning of the 20th century the prison started to become severely overcrowded, leading to the passing of legislation providing allowances to build a new prison south of the original location. The new prison, created in 1912, was placed on of land and included two factory buildings, two warehouses, a hospital, a chapel, a greenhouse, a dining hall, and five cell buildings to accommodate the large number of prisoners. The prison was run by the warden and the Board of Inspectors, which had three members who created the prison rules and were in charge of determining and implementing punishments within the prison. In 1901 the Board of Inspectors was replaced by the State Board of Control, which had monthly meetings at the prison and mostly involved reviewing and discussing parole requests. This lasted until 1959. During 1959 the State Board of Control relinquished its authority to the Minnesota Department of Corrections, which had recently been established.

In 2008 four inmates attempted to tunnel their way out. David Spaeth, Craig Friend, Andrew Salinas and Gonzalo Hernandez used pilfered tools, including an electric hammer drill, to tunnel approximately 25 feet. Their plan was thwarted when a corrections officer followed a power cord. Prison officials described the escape attempt as &quot;sophisticated and complex&quot;.

On July 18, 2018, Edward Muhammad Johnson, an inmate serving a 29-year sentence for second degree murder, struck correctional officer Joseph Gomm multiple times in the head with a hammer, killing him. Gomm, 45, had been a corrections officer at the facility for 16 years. It was the state&#x27;s first known incident of a prison guard killed in the line of duty by an inmate. Johnson was charged and convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was initially moved to Minnesota Correctional Facility – Oak Park Heights but was subsequently transferred into the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. , Johnson is serving his sentence at ADX Florence.

On September 3, 2023, approximately 100 inmates at the prison “took over” a living unit at approximately 8am. The takeover was described as a peaceful protest that went on for several hours in which inmates were expressing their disapproval for the series of lockdowns that occurred due to &quot;understaffing&quot; along with “unsafe living conditions” at the prison. Between 2-3pm, the situation was peacefully resolved and 2 inmates were detained for disciplinary action.

==Programs==
One of three Level 4 (Close) custody facilities in Minnesota, the prison hosts an industrial program, education programs, and the Atlantis chemical dependency treatment program. A small number of inmates are selected for the facility&#x27;s fine arts painting program.

The offenders housed in the minimum security area are responsible for the maintenance of the grounds surrounding the prison, and for cleaning office areas within the non-secured areas inside the main prison facility.

MCF-STW has undergone a number of modernization efforts, including the demolition of an antiquated medical building and construction of a modern segregation unit capable of housing up to 150 inmates in 2008.

===&quot;The Prison Mirror&quot;===
Notable one-time Stillwater prisoners include Frank Elli author of &quot;The Riot&quot;; Edgar-winning crime novelist E. Richard Johnson, author of &quot;Silver Street&quot; and &quot;Mongo&#x27;s Back in Town&quot;; and Harley M. Sorensen, former columnist for SFGate.com. Elli wrote &quot;The Riot&quot; and other books in Stillwater prison and was a member of the Ink Weavers writing group there. Sorensen was editor of &quot;The Prison Mirror&quot;, the inmate publication still produced by the men at Stillwater. Sorensen&#x27;s posthumous first book, &quot;Prison is a Place&quot;, documents life in Stillwater Prison in the early 1970s through the author&#x27;s exchange of letters with a St. Paul religious studies class.

&quot;The Prison Mirror&quot; celebrated its 125th anniversary in August 2012. It was founded in 1887 with the warden&#x27;s permission using funds from prisoners including the Younger Brothers, members of the James–Younger Gang and is believed to be the oldest continuously published prison newspaper in the United States. It has been named the best prison newspaper in the United States several times, winning the Charles C. Clayton award in 1969 and 1987 from the University of Illinois – Carbondale, and a similar award from Amicus in 1985. Topically the newspaper has a tight focus on life in the prison, covering sports such as broom hockey, basketball and dodgeball, educational pursuits and achievements of the prisoners, notable visitors and available support programs, and other matters. A regular column called &quot;Ask the Warden&quot; presents questions and requests to the warden. Comings and goings of staff members are often noted. Most issues feature poetry and artwork produced by the prisoners. In-depth features included an interview with several &#x27;lifers&#x27; including Harvey Carignan, an examination of Minnesota&#x27;s prison commissary prices and the supplier MINNCOR, and a cover story about the aging population of America&#x27;s prisons.

==Appearances in media==
The prison is mentioned in the 1939 James Cagney film &quot;Each Dawn I Die&quot;. It is also mentioned in the 1996 Coen Brothers black comedy thriller movie &quot;Fargo.&quot;

The 1956 book &quot;Nineteen Years Not Guilty: The Leonard Hankins&#x27; Story in His Own Words, as Told to Earl Guy&quot; describes an innocent man&#x27;s experiences inside Stillwater Prison.

Stillwater is mentioned frequently in the &quot;Prey&quot; series of novels authored by John Sandford.

<text>Oregon Penutian is a hypothetical language family in the Penutian language phylum comprising languages spoken at one time by several groups of Native Americans in present-day western Oregon and western Washington in the United States. Various languages in the family are divided by dialects that are in most cases identical to the various identified tribal bands in the region.

The languages were spoken largely along both banks of the lower and middle Columbia River, in the Willamette Valley, in the Oregon Cascade Range, along the Oregon Coast, and in the valleys of the Umpqua and Rogue rivers. The area in which the languages were spoken includes the most populated areas of Oregon today.

Languages in the Oregon Penutian family are:

* [[Kalapuyan languages|Kalapuyan]]
* [[Takelma language|Takelma]]
* &quot;Coast Oregon group&quot;
** [[Alsean languages|Alsean]]
** [[Siuslaw language|Siuslaw]]
** [[Coosan languages|Coosan]]

Recent internal classifications of Penutian, such as that of Scott DeLancey, have abandoned Oregon Penutian, while retaining the Coast Oregon Penutian family.

<text>Leonard Wailes Covington (October 30, 1768 – November 14, 1813) was a United States Army brigadier general and a member of the United States House of Representatives.

==Biography==
Born in Aquasco, Prince George&#x27;s County, in what was then the British Province of Maryland, Leonard Covington joined the United States Army as a cornet in March 1792. He was promoted to captain in 1794 and served in the Northwest Indian War (1785–1795) under Anthony Wayne, where he distinguished himself at Fort Recovery and the Battle of Fallen Timbers. He resigned from the military at the conclusion of the Northwest Indian War.

In 1809, Leonard Covington returned to the Army as colonel of light dragoons, having served many years in the Maryland House of Delegates and in 1805–1807 as a Representative (Democratic-Republican Party) in the Ninth Congress. He was in command at Fort Adams on the lower Mississippi River and participated in the December 1810 takeover by the United States of the Republic of West Florida, in today&#x27;s Florida Parishes, Louisiana. He served in the War of 1812, being promoted to brigadier general in August 1813. Covington was mortally wounded in the Battle of Crysler&#x27;s Farm and died three days later at French Mills, Franklin County, New York.

At the time of his death, Brig. Gen. Covington and his family were residents of Washington, the capital of the Mississippi Territory, in a home named &quot;Propinquity&quot;. It was built in 1810 near the military installation Fort Washington (originally Fort Dearborn), where Covington commanded the Regiment of Light Dragoons. Mrs. Leonard Covington was the former Rebecca Mackall, his first cousin and a relative of the family of General James Wilkinson. The Covingtons had at least four children.

<doc id="769984" wikidata="Q3407203" url="?curid=769984" title="MKNAOMI">
<text>MKNAOMI is the code name for a joint Department of Defense/CIA research program from the 1950s through to the 1970s. Unclassified information about the MKNAOMI program and the related Special Operations Division is scarce. It is generally reported to be a successor to the MKULTRA project focusing on biological projects including biological warfare agents—specifically, to store materials that could either incapacitate or kill a test subject and to develop devices for the diffusion of such materials.

During its first twenty years, the CIA engaged in projects designed to increase U.S. biological and chemical warfare capabilities. Project MKNAOMI was initiated to provide the CIA with a covert support base to meet its top-secret operational requirements. The goal was to have a robust arsenal of lethal and incapacitating materials within the CIA&#x27;s Technical Services Division (TSD). This would enable the TSD to serve as a center for supplying biological and chemical materials.

Surveillance, testing, upgrading and the evaluation of special materials and items were provided by MKNAOMI to ensure that no defects or unwanted contingencies emerged during operational conditions. The U.S. Army&#x27;s Special Operations Command (SOC) was assigned to assist the CIA with development, testing and maintenance procedures for the biological agents and delivery systems (1952). Both the CIA and SOC modified guns to fire special darts coated with biological agents and poisonous pills. The darts could incapacitate guard dogs, allowing agents to infiltrate the area that the dogs were guarding, and would then be used to awaken the dogs upon exiting the facility. In addition, the SOC was designated to research the potential to use biological agents against other animals and crops.

A 1967 CIA memo which was uncovered by the Church Committee contained evidence of at least three covert techniques for attacking and poisoning crops that had been tested under field conditions. On November 25, 1969, President Richard Nixon banned any military use of biological weapons and Project MKNAOMI was dissolved. On February 14, 1970, a presidential order outlawed all stockpiles of bacteriological weapons and nonliving toxins. However, despite the presidential order, a CIA scientist was able to acquire an estimated 11 grams of deadly shellfish toxin from SOC personnel at Fort Detrick. The toxin was stored in a CIA laboratory where it remained undetected for over five years.

<text>was a Japanese astronomer. He studied both major and minor planets, and discovered multiple asteroids.

Koishikawa was a staff member of the Sendai Astronomical Observatory frin 1972. His research was based out of the Sendai&#x27;s Ayashi (391) station. The main-belt asteroid 6097 Koishikawa, discovered by Kin Endate and Kazuro Watanabe at Kitami in 1991, was named in his honor. He died on 26 August 2020 from lung cancer.

<doc id="769993" wikidata="Q2344582" url="?curid=769993" title="Zalcitabine">
<text>Zalcitabine (2′-3′-dideoxycytidine, ddC), also called dideoxycytidine, is a nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) sold under the trade name Hivid. Zalcitabine was the third antiretroviral to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. It is used as part of a combination regimen.

Zalcitabine appears less potent than some other nucleoside RTIs, has an inconvenient three-times daily frequency and is associated with serious adverse events. For these reasons it is now rarely used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and it has even been removed from pharmacies entirely in some countries.

== Medical uses ==

Zalcitabine was the third antiretroviral to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. It was approved on June 19, 1992, as a monotherapy and again in 1996 for use in combination with zidovudine (AZT). Using combinations of NRTIs was in practice prior to the second FDA approval and the triple drug combinations with dual NRTIs and a protease inhibitor (PI) were not far off by this time.

In 1992 dideoxycytidine was listed as a specialty drug.

The sale and distribution of zalcitabine has been discontinued since December 31, 2006.

==Drug interactions==
Lamivudine (3TC) significantly inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of zalcitabine to the active form, and accordingly the drugs should not be administered together.

Additionally, zalcitabine should not be used with other drugs that can cause peripheral neuropathy, such as didanosine and stavudine.

==Adverse events==
The most common adverse events at the beginning of treatment are nausea and headache. More serious adverse events are peripheral neuropathy, which can occur in up to 33% of patients with advanced disease, oral ulcers, oesophageal ulcers and, rarely, pancreatitis.

==Resistance==
Resistance to zalcitabine develops infrequently compared with other nRTIs, and generally only occurs at a low level. The most common mutation observed &quot;in vivo&quot; is T69D, which does not appear to give rise to cross-resistance to other nRTIs; mutations at positions 65, 74, 75, 184 and 215 in the &quot;pol&quot; gene are observed more rarely.

== Pharmacology ==

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Zalcitabine has a very high oral absorption rate of over 80%. It is predominantly eliminated by the renal route, with a half-life of 2 hours.

=== Mechanism of action ===
Zalcitabine is an analog of pyrimidine. It is a derivative of the naturally existing deoxycytidine, made by replacing the hydroxyl group in position 3&#x27; with a hydrogen.

It is phosphorylated in T cells and other HIV target cells into its active triphosphate form, ddCTP. This active metabolite works as a substrate for HIV reverse transcriptase, and also by incorporation into the viral DNA, hence terminating the chain elongation due to the missing hydroxyl group. 
Apart from inhibiting retroviral reverse transcriptase, ddC inhibits mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, resulting in a dose-limiting toxicity.

== History ==
Zalcitabine was first synthesized in the 1960s by Jerome Horwitz and subsequently developed as an anti-HIV agent by Samuel Broder, Hiroaki Mitsuya, and Robert Yarchoan at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Like didanosine, it was then licensed because the NCI may not market or sell drugs. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) thus licensed it to Hoffmann-La Roche.

<doc id="770005" wikidata="Q312109" url="?curid=770005" title="Fyodor Apraksin">
<text>Count Fyodor Matveyevich Apraksin (also &quot;Apraxin&quot;; ; , Moscow) was one of the first Russian admirals, governed Estonia and Karelia from 1712 to 1723, was made general admiral (1708), presided over the Russian Admiralty from 1717 to 1728 and commanded the Baltic Fleet from 1723.

==Early shipbuilding activities==
The Apraksin brothers were launched to prominence after the marriage of their sister Marfa to &quot;Tsar&quot; Feodor III of Russia in 1681. Fyodor entered the service of his brother-in-law at the age of 10 as a &quot;stolnik&quot;. After Feodor&#x27;s death he served the little &quot;tsar&quot; Peter in the same capacity. He took part in military amusements of the young &quot;tsar&quot; and helped to build a toy flotilla for him. The playfellowship of the two lads resulted in a lifelong friendship.

In 1692 Apraksin was appointed governor of Arkhangelsk, the foremost trade port of Russia at that time, and built ships capable of weathering storms, to the great delight of the &quot;tsar&quot;. While living there, he commissioned one of the first Russian trade vessels to be built and sail abroad. In 1697 he was entrusted with major shipbuilding activities in Voronezh, where he would supervise the construction of the first Russian fleet. He won his colonelcy at the siege of Azov (1696). He was nominated the first Russian governor of Azov in 1700. While Peter was combating Charles XII, Apraksin was constructing fleets, building fortresses and havens in South Russia, notably Tavrov and Taganrog. In 1700 he was also appointed chief of the admiralty, in which post (from 1700 to 1706) his unusual technical ability was of great service.

==Great Northern War==
Having pacified the rebellious Astrakhan, Apraksin was summoned to Moscow, where he was put in charge of the mint and the armoury. In 1707, he was appointed president of the Russian Admiralty. The following year, he was appointed commander-in-chief in Ingria, to defend the new capital Saint Petersburg against the Swedes, whom he utterly routed. On 25 February 1710, aged 48, he became the third Russian ever to be elevated to the comital dignity. In March 1710 he was in command at the Siege of Vyborg. Taking this Swedish fortress in June, he was invested with the Order of St. Andrew and appointed governor of the conquered provinces (Estonia, Ingria, and Karelia).

Apraksin held the chief command in the Black Sea during the campaign of the Pruth (1711). He commanded the Imperial Russian Navy in the taking of Helsinki (1713)—materially assisting the conquest of Finland by his operations from the side of the sea—and the great Battle of Gangut (1714). That same year he assisted the &quot;tsar&quot; in opening a new naval harbour in Reval (now Tallinn, Estonia). Earlier, in 1712, he held parley with Ottoman Turkey, which ended in the destruction of Taganrog and the surrender of Azov to the Ottomans.

From 1710 to 1720 he personally conducted the descents upon Sweden, ravaging that country mercilessly, and thus extorting the peace of Nystad, whereby she surrendered the best part of her Baltic provinces to Russia. For these great services he was made a senator and General Admiral of the Empire.

==Later years==
In 1715, Apraksin fell into temporary disgrace with the &quot;tsar&quot;, who had been informed about disorders and bribery in the Admiralty. After brief investigation, he was fined and dispatched to govern Estonia. In 1719, he led the Russian naval expedition into the Gulf of Bothnia. During the Russo-Persian War (1722–1723) Apraksin barely escaped an assassination attempt by a Chechen.

Whereas his elder brother Peter Apraksin (the governor of Astrakhan) was accused of sympathizing with the Tsarevich Alexei Petrovich, Fyodor was eager to demonstrate his zeal in persecuting the tsarevich, as did Count Peter Tolstoy (1645–1729).

Upon Peter&#x27;s I death in 1725, his wife Catherine invested the ailing admiral with the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky and nominated him to the Supreme Privy Council, an exigence of the Great Boyars of Russia headed by an influential member of a powerful family, Prince Dmitry Mikhaylovich Galitzine (1665–1737), Ambassador to Turkey and Poland–Lithuania.

These &quot;Six Supreme dignitaries&quot; constituting the initial Supreme Privy Council, namely Alexander Menshikov, Fyodor Apraksin, Gavrila Golovkin, Andrey Osterman, Peter Tolstoy, and Dmitry Galitzine brought about the recognition of Russian Empress Anna Ivanovna for the succession of the unfortunate boy Tsar Peter II, who died in 1730 aged 15 after only 3 years as a Tsar.

Once Empress Anna Ivanovna was crowned she began to rule absolutely, and she had Galitzine sentenced to death but later commuted his sentence to exile.

Dmitry Galitzine&#x27;s brother Mikhail Galitzine (1675–1730) commanded Russian operations in Finland (1714–21) during the Northern War with Sweden and was responsible for the Treaty of Nystad, concluded at the end of the war.

Apraksin&#x27;s last expedition was to Revel in 1726, to cover the town from an anticipated attack by the British government, with whom the relations of Russia at the beginning of the reign of Catherine I were strained.

Though frequently threatened with terrible penalties by Peter the Great for his incurable vice of peculation, Apraksin nevertheless contrived to save his head, though not his pocket, chiefly through the mediation of the good-natured empress, the Swedish-born common-law wife and later formal wife of Peter I, Catherine I, sole ruling Empress of Russia from 1725 to 1727.

She remained his friend to the last, grateful probably, because of his helping to place the flexible and astute Catherine I on the throne on the death of Peter.

==Legacy==
According to R. N. Bain, Apraksin was the most genial and kind-hearted of all Peter&#x27;s pupils. He is said to have never made an enemy. He died on November 10, 1728, aged 67, and was interred in the family sepulchre at the Chrysostom Monastery of Moscow, where his grave was destroyed by the Communists in the 1930s.

<text>The East–West Center (EWC), or the Center for Cultural and Technical Interchange Between East and West, is an education and research organization established by the U.S. Congress in 1960 to strengthen relations and understanding among the peoples and nations of Asia, the Pacific, and the United States as part of Cold War diplomatic efforts.

Suzanne Vares-Lum serves as its president and chief executive, where it is headquartered in Honolulu at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa.

==History==

The East-West Center was established to facilitate Cold War-era diplomacy between the United States and its allies through technical interchange. Hawaii had become an important site for U.S. cultural diplomacy, military training, research, and as a staging ground for the U.S. war in Vietnam. In its early stages, the East-West Center only admitted students from countries deemed friendly to the United States.

&quot;The East–West Center originated as a University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa faculty initiative with a February 16, 1959, memo from professor Murray Turnbull, then acting Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, to political science professor Norman Meller, then chairperson of the faculty senate, that proposed the creation of an International College of Cultural Affairs. However, University of Hawaiʻi President Laurence H. Snyder stated that budgetary constraints prevented proceeding at the time with the idea&quot;.

Two months later, following radio reports of an April 16, 1959 speech in Washington, D.C. by then Senator Lyndon Johnson (D-Texas) that proposed the creation of an international university in Hawaii &quot;as a meeting place for the intellectuals of the East and the West,&quot; history professor John Stalker and Meller urged President Snyder to respond at once to Johnson&#x27;s suggestion. With the prospect of federal funding, President Snyder appointed a faculty committee chaired by Turnbull to rapidly prepare a substantive proposal for creating an international college.

On June 9, 1959, Senator Johnson introduced a bill in the U.S. Senate to establish an educational center in Hawaii to provide for &quot;cultural and technical interchange between East and West,&quot; with a companion bill introduced in the U.S. House by Delegate John A. Burns (D-T.H.); the Mutual Security Act of 1959, a renewal of the original Mutual Security Act, signed by U.S. President Eisenhower on July 24, 1959, called on the State Department to study the idea and report back to Congress by January 3, 1960.

On May 14, 1960, President Eisenhower signed the Mutual Security Act of 1960 which authorized the creation of a Center for Cultural and Technical Interchange Between East and West (East–West Center) at the University of Hawaii, and on August 31, 1960, signed the Department of State Appropriation Act, 1961, which appropriated $10 million for the center (including $8.2 million in capital spending for six new buildings), and on September 30, 1961, President Kennedy signed Supplemental Appropriation Act, 1962, which appropriated an additional $3.3 million for the center.

On October 25, 1960, the University of Hawaii signed a grant-in-aid agreement with the State Department to establish and operate the East–West Center, and received its first installment of $1.1 million in federal funding on November 8, 1960.

From its founding, the East-West Center&#x27;s oversight from, and relationship with, the federal government resulted in scrutiny and disagreements. Among those favoring strong federal control was Congressman John Rooney, who in 1962 criticized the East-West Center for what he described as &quot;not properly screening applicants&quot; and thereby allowing &quot;left wing foul balls&quot; into the program.&quot; The East-West Center was staffed with U.S. diplomats and foreign service staff. According to academic Wendy Cheng, the Center&#x27;s assistant director for American Studies was widely believed to monitor the center for &quot;lefties&quot; and &quot;reds&quot;. 

On May 9, 1961, then U.S. vice president Lyndon Johnson was a guest at groundbreaking ceremonies for the East–West Center&#x27;s first six buildings. Five of the new buildings, designed by architect I. M. Pei, were built along the new East–West Road where a new East–West Center campus just west of Manoa Stream on the east side of the university campus replaced chicken coops, temporary wooden buildings for faculty housing, and the Hawaii Agricultural Experiment Station. A sixth building built under the federal grant for the East–West Center was Edmondson Hall, designed by architect Albin Kubala and built on McCarthy Mall.

Four of the six buildings were completed and opened in September 1962: Edmondson Hall (a four-story building containing classrooms and laboratories), Kennedy Theatre (an 800-seat theatre), Hale Kuahine (a four-story women&#x27;s dormitory for 120 students), and Lincoln Hall (a four-story residence hall for senior scholars and faculty). The other two buildings: Jefferson Hall (a four-story conference center, cafeteria, and administrative office building) and Hale Manoa (a 13-story men&#x27;s dormitory for 480 students) were completed and opened in September 1963. &quot;Seien&quot; (Serene Garden), a Japanese garden designed by Kenzo Ogata of Tokyo, and located behind Jefferson Hall, was a 1963 gift of Japanese business leaders; the Japanese tea house Chashitsu Jakuan (Cottage of Tranquility) in the garden was presented to the university in 1972 by Sen Sōshitsu, the 15th-generation grand tea master of the Urasenke Foundation.

In May 1967, the Thai Pavilion, a gift of King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit of Thailand in 1964, was assembled just in time for King Adulyadej&#x27;s dedication of the pavilion on June 6, 1967; it is located between Lincoln Hall and Jefferson Hall, in front of Hale Kuahine.

In 1968, recent East-West Center student Chen Yu-hsi was arrested by the Republic of China&#x27;s (ROC) Kuomintang (KMT) government based on KMT surveillance of Chen in the United States. The Taiwan Garrison Command alleged that he had read communist literature including works by Mao Zedong while at the East-West Center library. The East-West Center administration and student associations sent an observer to Chen&#x27;s July 1968 trial where he was convicted of sedition and sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. Over the course of his incarceration, students protested at the University of Hawaii campus, the ROC consulate, and the East-West Center Chancellor&#x27;s office. Chen was released in 1971 after receiving amnesty. 

In 1969, the four-story wing of Moore Hall designed by architect Hideo Murakami was built with East–West Center federal funds on the west side of East–West Road across from Lincoln Hall. Harlan Cleveland was president of the University of Hawaii. During 1969-1974, the university added a medical school, a law school and an international astronomy project. 

In 1970, the East-West Center Students Association responded to the U.S. invasion of Cambodia by endorsing a general strike by the university community and issuing a statement condemning the U.S. escalation, which the association described as demonstrating the contradictions between the East-West Center&#x27;s stated goals and U.S. foreign policy.

In 1977, John A. Burns Hall, located south of Hale Manoa on the East–West Center campus, was completed. The four-story building for administrative offices was designed by architect John Hara to integrate with the style of the other East–West Center buildings (its windows mimic those of Lincoln Hall). It was built with State of Hawaii funds to compensate the federal government for the university&#x27;s use of Edmondson Hall, the Kennedy Theatre, and the 4-story wing of Moore Hall, which had been built with federal funds for the East–West Center.

==Structure==

EWC program areas include Education, Research, Seminars, a Washington, D.C. office, an Office of External Affairs and the East–West Center Foundation.

=== Chancellors ===
University of Hawaii art professor Murray Turnbull served as interim director and acting chancellor of the East–West Center through 1961, when anthropologist Alexander Spoehr, the former director (1953–1961) of the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum in Honolulu, was appointed as the East–West Center&#x27;s first chancellor, serving for two years before resigning at the end of 1963. University of Hawaii president Thomas H. Hamilton served as acting chancellor of the East–West Center for a year and a half from January 1964–June 1965. In July 1965, he was succeeded by former newspaper publisher and diplomat Howard P. Jones, the former U.S. ambassador to Indonesia (1958–1965), who served as chancellor for three years before being succeeded in August 1968 by linguist Everett Kleinjans, the former vice president of International Christian University in Tokyo, who had lived in Asia for sixteen years.

The first Native Hawaiian woman to become a general officer in the U.S. military, Major General Suzanne Vares-Lum, was appointed as president of East-West Center in 2021, becoming its first woman and the first Native Hawaiian to lead the organization since its founding.

===Research Program===
The Research Program conducts studies on economic development, trade, energy, governance, politics, security, conflict reduction, population, health, and environment. Under the Research umbrella is the Pacific Islands Development Program (the research and training arm and regional secretariat of the Pacific Islands Conference of Leaders representing 22 Pacific island nations).

===Education Program===
The Education Program offers educational opportunities for students and professional development seminars and workshops for educators from the U.S. and the region. The Student Program is carried out in partnership with the University of Hawaii and other universities in Hawaii and the continental U.S. scholarships are awarded annually in an international competition. Also under the Education Program are the Asia Pacific Leadership Program (APLP) (a certificate program for graduate-level students and mid-level professionals), AsiaPacificEd and the Asian Studies Development Program (both work with primary, secondary, and college educators to infuse Asian Pacific content in curricula), and Education 2020 (a focus on new approaches to educational challenges in the Asia Pacific Region). Most of education program participants reside in EWC dormitories like Hale Manoa Dormitory.

===East–West Seminars===
East–West Seminars bring professionals from government, civil society, business and the media together for short-term dialogue and exchange programs to share knowledge and address issues of regional and global concern. Included in the Seminars Program are the Media Program (provides journalist with first-hand examination of issues in the region and the U.S.), Senior Policy Seminar (brings together top level foreign affairs and security officials, private sector and civil society leaders to discuss key regional issues), and the Asia Pacific Executive Forum (brings to American cities discussions on topics that affect the economics and business of the region). The East–West Center also organizes various women empowerment programs. It recently organized 2014 Changing Faces Women&#x27;s Leadership Seminar at Hawaii which saw the participation of 13 women entrepreneurs from the Asia Pacific Region.

===Office of External Affairs===
The Office of External Affairs (OEA) connects the resources and research of the EWC with the local, national, and international community through educational outreach, public programs, briefings, and media relations. Within the OEA is the News and Information office (provides EWC research findings, opinion pieces, and analysis of issues to journalists and the public), the Arts Program (presents performances and exhibitions illuminating the cultural values and art forms of national and ethnic traditions in the region), and the Alumni Office (works with an international network of professionals from more than 50 countries who have had a past affiliation with the EWC).

The Hawaii International Film Festival was founded in 1981 as an outreach project of the East-West Center. Due to this association, HIFF prominently featured academic seminars and discussions in its early years, consisting of seven films from six countries which were viewed by an audience of 5,000 in its inaugural year. 

Although the festival decided to move independently of the East-West Center 1994, it still continues in its mission to elevate Asian and Indigenous voices in film, screening 300 films from 35 countries in 2022, and currently attracts more than 50,000 viewers annually from throughout the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.

===East–West Center Foundation===
The East–West Center Foundation expands and enhances support for the EWC with private resources that support scholarships, research, and seminar initiatives not covered by core Congressional funding.

==Funding==
Approximately half of Center funding comes from the U.S. government, with additional support provided by private agencies, individuals, foundations, corporations, and the governments of the region. In 2005 the EWC received a total of $37 million (including $19.2 million from the U.S. Congress).

On May 7, 2009, President Barack Obama requested a reduction in federal funding for the EWC, from $21 million in fiscal year 2009 to $12 million for fiscal year 2010. The outcome of the 2010 request was a $2 million increase in the center&#x27;s budget. Subsequently, in 2011, a request to reduce the budget by 50% (reduction by $10.7 million) was placed as part of the budget proposal. The outcome of this request was a $2 million decrease in the center&#x27;s budget.

Increased climate and geopolitical tensions within the region has raised the profile of the institution after years of declining budget approproations, with a return to federal funding in excess of $20 million under President Biden.

==East–West Center Gallery==
The East–West Center Gallery presents changing exhibits of traditional and contemporary arts of the Pacific region. The gallery is located on the campus of the University of Hawaii, and is open daily except Saturday. Cultural performances are also presented.

==Hale Manoa Dormitory==
Hale Manoa is the East–West Center&#x27;s student dormitory. This 13-story building, constructed in 1962, was designed by American architect I. M. Pei, and is located in the University of Hawaiʻi, Honolulu. The dormitory has a housing capacity of more than 400. This is a predominantly graduate student dormitory and most of the residents are mainly recipients of East West Center scholarships or are affiliated with their programs. Hence here there are EWC Graduate Degree Fellows, Asia Pacific Leadership Program participants, EWC Affiliates and others who are not directly funded by the EWC. A large majority of the residents are international students from the Asia-Pacific region like China, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, The Philippines, and Indonesia. Recently, there has been a move to bring in more students from South Asian countries.

It was an all-male dormitory, whereas a sister dormitory, Hale Kuahine, situated just next to the Imin Center and also a I. M. Pei building, housed all the females. Currently, both Hale Manoa and Hale Kuahine are unisex dormitories.

<text>The Minnesota Correctional Facility – Shakopee (MCF-SHK) is a women-only state prison in Minnesota, USA.

Constructed in 1986 and located in Shakopee, Scott County, it is Minnesota&#x27;s only facility for housing female offenders.

MCF-SHK is home to 500+ women of all five custody levels. The Facility consists of ten buildings, including six inmate living areas (including a chemical dependency treatment unit, parenting unit and education unit), a mental health unit and a segregation facility, an industries building, and administration and engineering related buildings.

The prison previously had no perimeter fence or wall, only a hedge surrounding the property until 2016. This was after a bonding bill passed by the legislature of Minnesota in 2014 allowing for the erection of a twelve foot fence to surround the prison. Despite previously having no fence or wall only eight prisoners have been able to escape but all were later caught.

MCF-SHK is home to a chemical dependency treatment unit, a program that promotes and teaches good parenting skills, and was formerly home to a work-release style program for women. Cosmetology, office support classes, as well as several college courses are also offered to the women.

<text>Stavudine (d4T), sold under the brand name Zerit among others, is an antiretroviral medication used to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. It is generally recommended for use with other antiretrovirals. It may be used for prevention after a needlestick injury or other potential exposure. However, it is not a first-line treatment. It is given by mouth.
Common side effects include headache, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and peripheral nerve problems. Severe side effects include high blood lactate, pancreatitis, and an enlarged liver. It is not generally recommended in pregnancy. Stavudine is in the nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) class of medication.
Stavudine was first described in 1966 and approved for use in the United States in 1994. It is available as a generic medication.

== Medical uses ==
Stavudine is used in the treatment of HIV-1 infection, but is not a cure. It is not normally recommended as initial treatment. Stavudine can also reduce the risk of developing HIV-1 infection after coming into contact with the virus either at work (e.g., needlestick) or through exposure to infected blood or other bodily fluids. It is always used in combination with other HIV medications for the better control of the infection and a reduction in HIV complications.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends stavudine to be phased out to due to its high toxicity levels. If the drug must be used, it is recommended to use low dosages to reduce the occurrence of side effects; however, a 2015 Cochrane review found no clear advantage between high and low dosage regimens.

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
Stavudine has been demonstrated to affect the fetus in animal studies but no data are available from human studies. Pregnant women should therefore be given stavudine only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential harm to the fetus. Additionally, there have been case reports of fatal lactic acidosis in pregnant women receiving combination therapy of stavudine and didanosine with other antiviral agents.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants, in order to avoid the risk of HIV transmission through breast milk. There is also evidence that stavudine gets into animal breast milk, although no data are available for human breast milk.

===Children===
Stavudine is safe for use in children infected with HIV from birth through adolescence. Adverse effects and safety profile are the same as adults.

===Elderly===
There is no data available for stavudine use in HIV-infected adults aged 65 years or older. However, among 12,000 people over the age of 65, 30% developed peripheral neuropathy. Additionally, since the elderly are more likely to have decreased renal function, they are more likely to develop toxic side effects.

==Adverse events==
Common side effects
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Upset stomach

Severe side effects 
* Peripheral neuropathy
* Lactic acidosis
* Pancreatitis
* Hepatotoxicity 
* Hepatomegaly with steatosis
* Lipoatrophy/lipodystrophy (fat redistribution/accumulation)

Individuals are monitored for the development of these serious adverse effects. The development of peripheral neuropathy is shown to be dose related, and may be resolved if the drug is discontinued. Individuals with advanced HIV-1 disease, a history of peripheral neuropathy, or individuals on other drugs that have association with neuropathy develop this side effect more often.

Stavudine has been shown in laboratory test to be genotoxic, but with clinical doses its carcinogenic effects are non-existent. Hyperlactatemia, bone mineral density (BMD) loss, reduction in limb fat and an increase in triglycerides were found when administered in high dosages. It is also one of the most likely antiviral drugs to cause lipodystrophy, and for this reason it is no longer considered an appropriate treatment for most patients in developed countries.

HLA-B*4001 may be used as a genetic marker to predict which patients will develop stavudine-associated lipodystrophy, to avoid or shorten the duration of stavudine according to a study in Thailand.

It is still used as first choice in first line therapy in resource poor settings such as in India. Only in case of development of peripheral neuropathy or pregnancy is it changed to the next choice, zidovudine. Safety and effectiveness of dosage titration was not reported in treatment naive patients. It was only reported in those patients with sustained virologic suppression. These findings are not generalized to stavudine used in ART naive patients who have high viral loads.

In November 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that &quot;[The WHO] recommends that countries phase out the use of stavudine, or d4T, because of its long-term, irreversible side-effects. Stavudine is still widely used in first-line therapy in developing countries due to its low cost and widespread availability. Zidovudine (AZT) or tenofovir (TDF) are recommended as less toxic and equally effective alternatives.&quot;

==Mechanism of action==
Stavudine is a nucleoside analog of thymidine. It is phosphorylated by cellular kinases into an active triphosphate. Stavudine triphosphate inhibits HIV&#x27;s reverse transcriptase by competing with the natural substrate, thymidine triphosphate. Reverse transcriptase is the enzyme the virus uses to make a DNA copy of its RNA in order to insert its genetic material into the host&#x27;s DNA. Upon incorporation into the DNA strand, stavudine triphosphate causes termination of DNA replication.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Absorption: Stavudine has rapid absorption and good oral bioavailability  (F = 0.86).

Distribution: Stavudine does not bind to proteins in the blood.

Metabolism: The clearance of stavudine is affected minimally by hepatic metabolism. Oxidation and glucuronidation produce minor metabolites.

Elimination: Stavudine is mostly eliminated in the urine and mostly in its unchanged form.

== Drug interactions ==
Simultaneous use of zidovudine is not recommended, as it can inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of stavudine. Other anti-HIV drugs do not possess this property.

Stavudine is not protein-bound nor does it inhibit the major cytochrome P450 isoforms. Thus, significant drug interactions with drugs metabolized through these pathways or drugs that are protein-bound are unlikely.

==History==
Stavudine was first created by Jerome Horwitz in the 1960s and was originally named D4T. When the AIDS epidemic occurred in the 1980s, William Prusoff and others at Yale University discovered the anti-HIV properties of stavudine. 

In 1990, Yale patented the use of the drug stavudine (d4T) to treat HIV and granted an exclusive license to Bristol-Myers Squibb to manufacture the drug under the brand name Zerit. Since then, stavudine became a key drug for treating HIV. However, because of its high price (over $1600 per year), Zerit was inaccessible to infected people in developing countries. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) found an Indian manufacturer, who was willing to sell stavudine in South Africa for $40 per year per patient. However, this deal fell apart, because Yale patented stavudine in South Africa, and was unwilling to issue a license to the Indian generic manufacturer. Students sided with Médecins Sans Frontières and approached Yale with the idea to put pressure on Bristol-Myers Squibb to lower Stavudine&#x27;s prices in South Africa and/or to issue patent licenses to generic manufacturers. After the issue was publicized, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced, that it would not enforce the stavudine patent in South Africa and that it would sell Zerit in sub-Saharan Africa for $55 per year.

Stavudine was the first drug to be granted parallel track status in 1992, by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which allowed the agency to make Stavudine available to patients before being approved. Stavudine was submitted under the FDA&#x27;s accelerated approval process. Through this process, Stavudine&#x27;s effectiveness was measured by its effect on the surrogate marker, CD4, instead of clinical endpoints. The FDA concluded that an increase in CD4 cell counts was an indicator of how effective the drug would be against AIDS and HIV infection. Stavudine was the fourth drug to be approved for the treatment of AIDS and HIV infection by the FDA on 27 June 1994. Even after approval, studies were continued to evaluate the clinical benefit of the drug. If there is no indication of clinical benefits, the accelerated approval may be withdrawn.

In 2018, Mylan Pharmaceuticals discontinued manufacturing stavudine 20 mg, 30 mg, and 40 mg capsules.

<text>Lance corporal of horse (LCoH) is an appointment unique to the Household Cavalry of the British Army, equivalent to lance sergeant in the Foot Guards. It was introduced in 1971. On promotion to corporal, an NCO is automatically appointed lance-corporal of horse, so that the rank structure effectively goes straight from Lance Corporal to lance corporal of horse, and then to Corporal of Horse. However, lance corporals of horse are still addressed as &quot;Corporal&quot;.

A lance-corporal of horse wears three rank chevrons surmounted by a cloth crown (as opposed to the metal crowns worn by full corporals of horse).

The rank was introduced to fall in line with lance sergeants in the Foot Guards allowing them to use the sergeants&#x27; mess.

<text>The Telecom Corridor is a technology business center in Richardson, Texas, a northern suburb of Dallas, which contains over 25 million square feet (2.3 million square meters) of office space and accounts for over 130,000 jobs. Located in the Dallas/Fort Worth area and home to the University of Texas at Dallas, the Corridor is a strip about long along U.S. Route 75 (US 75) (the North Central Expressway), between President George Bush Turnpike and Interstate 635 (I-635) and is often considered an area of the Silicon Prairie. More than 5,700 companies, including 600 technology companies are headquartered in the area, including significant players such as AT&amp;T, Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson, Verizon, Samsung, Fujitsu, Texas Instruments, and MetroPCS (now part of T-Mobile). Some of these companies also have offices in Telecom Valley located in California. Although the Telecom Corridor was a booming area of Dallas&#x27;s economy during the late 1990s, the dot-com bust of 2000 hit the region hard. However, it began recovering in 2004, and that recovery has since picked up momentum, gaining both the operations of many non-technology-related companies and many previously non-existent residential units designed in the New Urbanist style.

<doc id="770033" wikidata="Q2365048" url="?curid=770033" title="Adal Sultanate">
<text>The Adal Sultanate, also known as the Adal Empire or Bar Saʿad dīn (alt. spelling &quot;Adel Sultanate&quot;, &quot;Adal Sultanate&quot;) (), was a medieval Sunni Muslim Empire which was located in the Horn of Africa. It was founded by Sabr ad-Din III on the Harar plateau in Adal after the fall of the Sultanate of Ifat. The kingdom flourished to 1577. At its height, the polity under Sultan Badlay controlled the territory stretching from Cape Guardafui in Somalia to the port city of Suakin in Sudan. The Adal Empire maintained a robust commercial and political relationship with the Ottoman Empire. Sultanate of Adal was alternatively known as the federation of Zeila.

==Etymology==
Adal is believed to be an abbreviation of Havilah. Eidal or Aw Abdal, was the Emir of Harar in the eleventh century which the lowlands outside the city of Harar is named. In the thirteenth century, the Arab writer al-Dimashqi refers to the city of Zeila, by its Somali name &quot;Awdal&quot; (). The modern Awdal region of Somaliland, which was part of the Adal Sultanate, bears the kingdom&#x27;s name.

Locally the empire was known to the Muslims as &quot;Bar Sa&#x27;ad ad-din&quot; meaning &quot;The country of Sa&#x27;ad ad-din&quot; in reference to the Sultan Sa&#x27;ad ad-Din II, who was killed in Zeila while fighting the Ethiopian Emperor Dawit I.

==History ==

===Early history===

Adal (also &quot;Awdal&quot;, &quot;Adl&quot;, or &quot;Adel&quot;) was situated east of the province of Ifat and was a general term for a region of lowlands inhabited by Muslims. It was used ambiguously in the medieval era to indicate the Muslim inhabited low land portion east of the Ethiopian Empire. Including north of the Awash River towards Lake Abbe as well as the territory between Shewa and Zeila on the coast of Somaliland. According to Ewald Wagner, Adal region was historically the area stretching from Zeila to Harar.

In 1288, the region of Adal was conquered by the Ifat Sultanate. Despite being incorporated into the Ifat Sultanate, Adal managed to maintain a source of independence under Walashma rule, alongside the provinces of Gidaya, Dawaro, Sawans, Bali, and Fatagar. In 1332, Adal was invaded by the Ethiopian Emperor Amda Seyon I. His soldiers were said to have ravaged the province.

In the fourteenth century Haqq ad-Din II transferred Ifat&#x27;s capital to the Harar plateau thus he is regarded by some to be the true founder of the Adal Sultanate. In the late 14th century, the Ethiopian Emperor Dawit I collected a large army, branded the Muslims of the surrounding area &quot;enemies of the Lord&quot;, and invaded Adal. After much war, Adal&#x27;s troops were defeated in 1403 or 1410 (under Emperor Dawit I or Emperor Yeshaq I, respectively), during which the Walashma ruler, Sa&#x27;ad ad-Din II, was captured and executed in Zeila, which was sacked. His children and the remainder of the Walashma dynasty would flee to Yemen where they would live in exile until 1415. According to Harari tradition numerous Argobba had fled Ifat and settled around Harar in the Aw Abdal lowlands during their conflict with Abyssinia in the fifteenth century, a gate was thus named after them called the gate of Argobba.

===Rise of the Sultanate===
In 1415, Sabr ad-Din III, the eldest son of Sa&#x27;ad ad-Din II, would return to Adal from his exile in Arabia to restore his father&#x27;s throne. He would proclaim himself &quot;king of Adal&quot; after his return from Yemen to the Harar plateau and established his new capital at Dakkar. Sabr ad-Din III and his brothers would defeat an army of 20,000 men led by an unnamed commander hoping to restore the &quot;lost Amhara rule&quot;. The victorious king then returned to his capital, but gave the order to his many followers to continue and extend the war against the Christians. The Emperor of Ethiopia Tewodros I was soon killed by the Adal Sultanate upon the return of Sa&#x27;ad ad-Din&#x27;s heirs to the Horn of Africa. Sabr ad-Din III died a natural death and was succeeded by his brother Mansur ad-Din who invaded the capital and royal seat of the Solomonic Empire and drove Emperor Dawit I to Yedaya where according to al-Maqrizi, Sultan Mansur destroyed a Solomonic army and killed the Emperor. He then advanced to the mountains of Mokha, where he encountered a 30,000 strong Solomonic army. The Adalite soldiers surrounded their enemies and for two months besieged the trapped Solomonic soldiers until a truce was declared in Mansur&#x27;s favour. During this period, Adal emerged as a centre of Muslim resistance against the expanding Christian Abyssinian kingdom. Adal would thereafter govern all of the territory formerly ruled by the Ifat Sultanate, as well as the land further east all the way to Cape Guardafui, according to Leo Africanus.

Later on in the campaign, the Adalites were struck by a catastrophe when Sultan Mansur and his brother Muhammad were captured in battle by the Solomonids. Mansur was immediately succeeded by the youngest brother of the family Jamal ad-Din II. Sultan Jamal reorganized the army into a formidable force and defeated the Solomonic armies at Bale, Yedeya and Jazja. Emperor Yeshaq I responded by gathering a large army and invaded the cities of Yedeya and Jazja, but was repulsed by the soldiers of Jamal. Following this success, Jamal organized another successful attack against the Solomonic forces and inflicted heavy casualties in what was reportedly the largest Adalite army ever fielded. As a result, Yeshaq and his men fled to the Blue Nile region over the next five months, while Jamal ad Din&#x27;s forces pursued them and looted much gold on the way, although no engagement ensued.

After returning home, Jamal sent his brother Ahmad with the Christian battle-expert Harb Jaush to successfully attack the province of Dawaro. Despite his losses, Emperor Yeshaq was still able to continue field armies against Jamal. Sultan Jamal continued to advance further into the Abyssinian heartland. However, Jamal on hearing of Yeshaq&#x27;s plan to send several large armies to attack three different areas of Adal (including the capital), returned to Adal, where he fought the Solomonic forces at Harjai and, according to al-Maqrizi, this is where the Emperor Yeshaq died in battle. The young Sultan Jamal ad-Din II at the end of his reign had outperformed his brothers and forefathers in the war arena and became the most successful ruler of Adal to date. Within a few years, however, Jamal was assassinated by either disloyal friends or cousins around 1432 or 1433, and was succeeded by his brother Badlay ibn Sa&#x27;ad ad-Din. Sultan Badlay continued the campaigns of his younger brother and began several successful expeditions against the Christian empire. He reconquered Bali and began preparations of a major Adalite offensive into the Ethiopian Highlands. He successfully collected funding from surrounding Muslim kingdoms as far away as the Sultanate of Mogadishu. However, this ambitious campaign ended in disaster when Emperor Zara Yaqob defeated Sultan Badlay at the Battle of Gomit and pursued the retreating Adalites all the way to the Awash River.

Following the defeat and death of Badlay ibn Sa&#x27;ad ad-Din at the Battle of Gomit, the next Sultan of Adal, Muhammad ibn Badlay, submitted to Emperor Baeda Maryam I and started paying annual tribute to the Ethiopian Empire with which he secure peace. Adal&#x27;s Emirs, who administered the provinces, interpreted the agreement as a betrayal of their independence and a retreat from the polity&#x27;s long-standing policy of resistance to Abyssinian incursions. Emir Laday Usman of Harar subsequently marched to Dakkar and seized power in 1471. However, Usman did not dismiss the Sultan from office, but instead gave him a ceremonial position while retaining the real power for himself. Adal now came under the leadership of a powerful Emir who governed from the palace of a nominal Sultan. Usman would route emperor Baeda Maryam&#x27;s troops in battle. Historian Mohammed Hassen states Adal Sultans had lost control of the state to Harar&#x27;s aristocracy.

Emperor Na&#x27;od and Sultan Muhammad ibn Azhar ad-Din tried to remain at peace, but their efforts were nullified by the raids which Emir Mahfuz constantly made into Christian territory. Na&#x27;od who was determined to eliminate this threat, organized a large army and led it against the Emir, although the Emperor was victorious he was eventually killed in battle against the Adalites. Emperor Dawit II (Lebna Dengel) would soon succeed the throne, Mahfuz having recovered from his defeat renewed raids against the frontier provinces. He was stimulated by emissaries from Arabia who proclaimed the jihad (holy war), presented him with a green standard and brought in arms and trained men from Yemen. In 1516, Emir Mahfuz would then launch an invasion of Fatagar, Lebna Dengel was prepared and organized a successful ambush, the Adalites were defeated and Mahfuz was killed in battle. Lebna Dengel then moved into Adal where he sacked the city of Dakkar. Around the same time a Portuguese fleet surprised Zeila whilst its garrison was away with Mahfuz, the Portuguese then burnt down the port city.

After the victory of Lebna Dengel, the internal weaknesses of the Adal Sultanate soon revealed themselves. The older generation of the Muslims headed by the Walashma, indifferent to religion and ready to come to terms with Abyssinia, were staunchly opposed by the Harari and Harla religious aristocracy led by fanatic warlike emirs. The Sultan Muhammad was assassinated in 1518 and Adal was torn apart by intestinal struggles in which five sultans succeeded each other in two years. But at last, a matured and powerful leader called Garad Abun Adashe assumed power and brought order out of chaos. However, Sultan Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad, who had transferred the capital from Dakkar to Harar in 1520, profiting off the prestige that the hereditary monarchy still held, recruited bands of Somali nomads, ambushed Abun Adashe at Zeila and killed him in 1525. Many people went to join the force of a young rebel named Ahmad ibn Ibrahim, who claimed revenge for Garad Abogn. Ahmad did not immediately attempt conclusions with Sultan Abu Bakr, but retired to Hubat to build up his strength. Ahmad ibn Ibrahim would eventually kill Sultan Abu Bakr in battle, and replaced him with Abu Bakr&#x27;s younger brother Umar Din as his puppet. Once in complete control, he then could then turn to the task he felt himself was divinely appoint to undertake, the conquest of Abyssinia. Fervor for the jihad had not yet overcome the forces inherent in nomadic life, Ahmad had to undertake several campaigns to restore order in the Somali territory which would constitute his manpower reserve. He then organized a heterogenous mass of tribes into a powerful army, inflamed by the fanatical zeal of jihad.

===Conquest of Abyssinia===
According to sixteenth century Adal writer Arab Faqīh, in 1529 Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi finally decided to embark on a conquest of Abyssinia, he soon met the Abyssinians at the Battle of Shimbra Kure where he would win a decisive victory. But his nomads where unreliable and difficult to control, to Ahmad&#x27;s frustration some of his Somali warriors would disperse back to their homelands after acquiring much plunder. At the same time, he faced opposition from his Harari troops who dreaded the potential consequences of the Muslim base relocating to Abyssinia. He then returned to Harar to reconstruct his forces and eliminate the tribal allegiances in his army, two years later he was able to organize a definite and permeant occupation of Abyssinia. From then the story of the conquest is a succession of victories, burnings and massacres. In 1531 Dawaro and Shewa were occupied, Bete Amhara and Lasta in 1533. In 1535 Ahmad, in control of the east and center of Abyssinia invaded Tigray where he encountered fierce resistance and suffered some reserves, but his advance was not stopped, his armies reached the coasts of Medri Bahri and Kassala where they made contact with the Muslim Beja tribes of the north that had formerly paid tribute to the Ethiopian Empire. Emperor Dawit II (Lebna Dengel) became a hunted fugitive, and harried from Tigray to Begemder to Gojjam, constantly pursued by the Adalites. In this period Adal Sultanate occupied a territory stretching from Zeila to Massawa as well as the Abyssinian inlands.

The Adalites were passionately interested in converting newly occupied territories. The impression given in the Muslim chronicles is that almost all of the Christian Abyssinians had embraced Islam out of expediency. Among them was the governor of Ifat who wrote to the Imam:
However, in the integral regions of the Ethiopian Empire, such as Bete Amhara, Tigray and Shewa, the local population bitterly resisted the Adalite occupation. Some preferred death over denying their faith, among them were two Amhara chiefs who were brought before the Imam in Debre Berhan. Arab Faqīh describes the encounter:
In 1541 a small Portuguese contingent landed in Massawa and soon all of Tigray declared for the monarchy, the Imam was defeated in several major engagements by the Portuguese and was forced to flee to Raya Kobo with his heavily demoralized followers. He sent a request to the Ottoman Empire for reinforcements of Turkish, Albanian and Arab musketeers to stabilize his troops. He then took the offensive attacking the Portuguese camp at Wolfa where he killed their commander, Cristóvão da Gama, and 200 of their rank and file. The Imam then dismissed most of his foreign contingent and returned to his headquarters at Lake Tana. The surviving Portuguese were able to meet up with Gelawdewos and his army at Siemen. The Emperor did not hesitate to take the offensive and won a major victory at the Battle of Wayna Daga when the fate of Abyssinia was decided by the death of the Imam and the flight of his army. The invasion force collapsed like a house of cards and all the Abyssinians who had been cowed by the invaders returned to their former allegiance, the reconquest of Christian territories proceeded without encountering any effective opposition.

===Collapse of the sultanate===
In 1550 Nur ibn Mujahid became the Emir of Harar and the de facto ruler of Adal, he then began to strengthen the defenses of Harar, building a wall that still encircles the city to this day. In 1559, urged on by his wife, Nur once again took the offensive and invaded the Ethiopian Empire, killing Ethiopian Emperor Gelawdewos in the Battle of Fatagar. At the same time another Ethiopian army led by Dejazmatch Hamalmal attacked Harar. Sultan Barakat ibn Umar Din attempted to defend the city but was defeated and killed, thus ending the Walashma dynasty. Not long after this, Barentu Oromos who had been migrating north invaded the Adal Sultanate. This struggle, which was mentioned by the monk Bahrey, led to the devastation of many regions and Nur&#x27;s army was defeated at the Battle of Hazalo. The defensive walls managed to protect Harar from the invaders, preserving it as a kind of Muslim island in an Oromo sea. However, the city then experienced a severe famine as grain and salt prices rose to unpreceded levels. According to a contemporary source, the hunger became so bad that people began to resort to eating their own children and spouses. Nur himself died in 1567 of the pestilence which spread during the famine.

Nur was succeeded by Uthman the Abyssinian, who relaxed his predecessor&#x27;s pro-Islamic policy and signed an infamous and humiliating peace treaty with the Oromos. The treaty stated that the Oromos can freely enter to the Muslim markets and purchase goods at less than the current market price. This angered many Muslims and led to a rebellion, in which he was overthrown and replaced by Tahla Abbas in 1569. Tahla would rule for only three years before being overthrown by some of his very fanatic subjects who were intent on another jihad or holy war against the Christians. He was replaced by Uthman&#x27;s grandson Muhammad ibn Nasir who soon carried out an expedition against the Ethiopian Empire, however this campaign would end in total disaster. As soon as the army left Harar the Oromo ravaged the countryside, up to the walls of the city. Muhammad ibn Nasir was also defeated and killed at the Battle of Webi River, thus permanently ending Adal aggression towards Ethiopia. Muhammad&#x27;s successor, Mansur ibn Muhammad, fought a fierce war against the Oromos, but was unable to defeat them. Mansur would also successfully reconquer Aussa and Zeila. The tension was all the greater after the death of Nur Ibn Mujahid, the disappearance of the last of the Walashma monarch also opened a tough competition for power between emirs and descendants of Ahmed Ibn Ibrahim. Ultimately, they won in April 1576, Muhammad Gasa took the title of Imam, thus combining the political power of the Sultan and the religious responsibility of guiding the community, he then relocated the capital to the oasis of Aussa in 1577, establishing the Imamate of Aussa.

The Imamate of Aussa declined gradually in the next century and was destroyed by the neighboring Afar nomads who made Aussa their capital. In the seventeenth century the induction of Harla people and Doba populations into Afar identity would lead to the emergence of Aussa Sultanate. Enrico Cerulli&#x27;s verdict on this &quot;sad condition&quot; of Adal&#x27;s decadence was that whereas the Ethiopian Empire under Sarsa Dengel was able to reorganize and withstand the Oromo migrations, the Sultanate of Adal was too newly established to transcend tribal differences. The result he claims was that the nomadic people instinctively return to their &quot;eternal disintegrating struggles&quot; of people against people and tribe against tribe.

==Ethnicity==
Ulrich Braukämper mentions that Adal was distinguished by its ethnic variety which included Somalis, Afars, Argobba, and Hararis. Ethiopian historian Taddesse Tamrat states that Adal&#x27;s central authority in the fourteenth century consisted of the Argobba, Harari and Silt&#x27;e people. Professor Donald N. Levine, an important figure in Ethiopian Studies, described the Adal Sultanate as consisting of many ethnic groups, but primarily Somalis and Afars. Somali scholar Abdurahman Abdullahi Baadiyow notes that Somalis were integral to the founding of the sultanate, and played a significant role in the subsequent wars with Abyssinia. The Somali tribes, already influential in Adal&#x27;s politics, rose to greater prominence with the emergence of Garad Abun. According to Patrick Gikes and Mohammed Hassen, Adal in the sixteenth century was primarily inhabited by the sedentary Harla people and the pastoral Somali people. Marriage alliances between Argobba, Harari and Somali people were also common within the Adal Sultanate.
According to Professor Lapiso Delebo, the contemporary Harari people are heirs to the ancient Semitic speaking peoples of the Adal region. Historians state the language spoken by the people of Adal as well as its rulers the Imams and Sultans would closely resemble contemporary Harari language. Ethiopian historian Bahru Zewde and others state the Walasma led Sultanates of Ifat and Adal primarily included the Ethiopian Semitic speaking Argobba and Harari people, it later expanded to comprise Afar and Somali peoples. Between the late 1400s to mid 1500s there was a large scale migration of Hadhrami people into Adal.

Among the earliest mentions of the Somali by name has come through a victory poem written by Emperor Yeshaq I of Abyssinia against the king of Adal, as the Simur are said to have submitted and paid tribute. As Taddesse Tamrat writes: &quot;Dr Enrico Cerulli has shown that Simur was an old Harari name for the Somali, who are still known by them as Tumur. Hence, it is most probable that the mention of the Somali and the Simur in relation to Yishaq refers to the king&#x27;s military campaigns against Adal, where the Somali seem to have constituted a major section of the population.&quot;

According to Leo Africanus (1526) and George Sale (1760), the Adelites were of a tawny brown or olive complexion on the northern littoral, and grew swarthier towards the southern interior. They generally had long, lank hair. Most wore a cotton sarong but no headpiece or sandals, with many glass and amber trinkets around their necks, wrists, arms and ankles. The king and other aristocrats often donned instead a body-length garment topped with a headdress. All were Muslims. In the southern hinterland, the Adelites lived beside pagan &quot;Negroes&quot;, with whom they bartered various commodities.

==Languages==
Various languages from the Afro-Asiatic family were spoken in the vast Adal Sultanate. Arabic served as a lingua franca, and was used by the ruling Walashma dynasty. According to the 19th-century Ethiopian historian Asma Giyorgis suggests that the Walashma dynasty themselves spoke Arabic. According to Robert Ferry, Adal&#x27;s aristocracy in the Walasma era which consisted of imams, emirs and sultans spoke a language resembling modern Harari language. British historian John Fage states Walasma leaders moving their capital from Ifat region to Adal set in motion the evolution of Harari and Argobba language within Harar and its environs. According to Jeffrey M. Shaw, the main inhabitants of the Adal Sultanate spoke East Cushitic languages. In Zeila, the port city of Adal Sultanate, the Somali language was mainly spoken.

==Economy==

One of the empire&#x27;s most wealthy provinces was Ifat it was well watered, by the large river Awash. Additionally, besides the surviving Awash River, at least five other rivers in the area between Harar and Shawa plateau existed. The general area was well cultivated, densely populated with numerous villages adjoining each other. Agricultural produce included three main cereals, wheat, sorghum and teff, as well as beans, aubergines, melons, cucumbers, marrows, cauliflowers and mustard. Many different types of fruit were grown, among them bananas, lemons, limes, pomegranates, apricots, peaces, citrons mulberries and grapes. Other plants included sycamore tree, sugar cane, from which kandi, or sugar was extracted and inedible wild figs.

The province also grew the stimulant plant Khat. Which was exported to Yemen. Adal was abundant in large numbers of cattle, sheep, and some goats. There was also chickens. Both buffaloes and wild fowl were sometimes hunted. The province had a great reputation for producing butter and honey.

Whereas provinces such as Bale, surrounding regions of Webi Shabelle was known for it cotton cultivation and an age old weaving industry, while the El Kere region produced salt which was an important trading item.

Zeila was a wealthy city and abundantly supplied with provisions. It possessed grain, meat, oil, honey and wax. Furthermore, the citizens had many horses and reared cattle of all kinds, as a result they had plenty of butter, milk and flesh, as well as a great store of millet, barley and fruits; all of which was exported to Aden. The port city was so well supplied with victuals that it exported it&#x27;s surplus to Aden, Jeddah, Mecca and &quot;All Arabia&quot; which then was dependent on the supplies/produce from the city which they favoured above all. Zeila was described as a &quot;Port of much provisions for Aden, and all parts of Arabia and many countries and Kingdoms&quot;.

The Principal exports, according the Portuguese writer Corsali, were gold, ivory and slaves. A &quot;great number&quot; of the latter was captured from the Ethiopian Empire, then were exported through the port of Zeila to Persia, Arabia, Egypt and India.

As a result of this flourishing trade, the citizens of Zeila accordingly lived &quot;extremely well&quot; and the city was well built guarded by many soldiers on both foot and horses.

The kingdoms agricultural and other produce was not only abundant but also very cheap according to Maqrizi thirty pounds of meat sold for only half a dirhem, while for only four dirhems you could purchase a bunch of about 100 Damascus grapes.

Trade on the upland river valleys themselves connected with the coast to the interior markets. Created a lucrative caravan trade route between Ethiopian interior, the Hararghe highlands, Eastern Lowlands and the coastal cities such as Zeila and Berbera. The trade from the interior was also important for the reason that included gold from the Ethiopian territories in the west, including Damot and an unidentified district called Siham. The rare metal sold for 80 to 120 dirhems per ounce. The whole empire and the wider region was interdependent on each other and formed a single economy and at the same time a cultural unit interconnected with several important trade routes upon which the economy and the welfare of the whole area depended.

The nobility of Adal also apparently had a fair taste for luxury, the commercial relations that existed between the Adal Sultanate and the rulers of the Arab peninsula allowed Muslims to obtain luxury items that Christian Ethiopians, whose relations with the outside world were still blocked, could not acquire, a Christian document describing Sultan Badlay relates:&quot;And the robes [of the sultan] and those of his leaders were adorned with silver and shone on all sides. And the dagger which he [the sultan] carried at his side was richly adorned with gold and precious stones; and his amulet was adorned with drops of gold; and the inscriptions on the amulet were of gold paint. And his parasol came from the land of Syria and it was such beautiful work that those who looked at it marveled, and winged serpents were painted on it.&quot;During its existence, Adal had relations and engaged in trade with other polities in Northeast Africa, the Near East, Europe and South Asia. Many of the historic cities in the Horn of Africa such as Abasa, Amud, Awbare and Berbera flourished under its reign with courtyard houses, mosques, shrines, walled enclosures and cisterns. Adal attained its peak in the 14th century, trading in slaves, ivory and other commodities with Abyssinia and kingdoms in Arabia through its chief port of Zeila. The cities of the empire imported intricately coloured glass bracelets and Chinese celadon for palace and home decoration. Adal also used imported currency such as Egyptian dinars and dirhems.

==Military==
The Military of Adal was divided into several sections such as the infantry consisting of swordsmen, archers and lancers that were commanded by various generals and lieutenants. These forces were complemented by a cavalry force and eventually, later in the empire&#x27;s history, by matchlock-technology and cannons during the Conquest of Abyssinia. The various divisions were symbolised with a distinct flag.

Under Imam Ahmed&#x27;s leadership, the military was reorganized into three flexible units, giving Adal a strategic advantage. This superior organization contrasted sharply with the rigid and poorly commanded Abyssinian forces. The first group was the Malassay, the elite unit of military warriors in the Adal army which according to several historians consisted of mainly the Harari ethnicity. The title Malassay or Malachai (Portuguese spelling) often became synonymous with Muslims in Ethiopia to outsiders, but contrary to popular beliefs it did not denote a tribe or clan. Reading the Futūḥ al-Ḥabaša, the Malasāy appear as the basic unit of the army of the imām. Unlike the other groups that make up this army, the Malasāy were a group social and not a tribe or a clan. Unlike the Balaw, Somali or Ḥarla, a man Malasāy is not born. He obtained this title after demonstrating his military capabilities. ‘Arab Faqīh gives a relatively precise definition of what he means by &quot;malasāy:

The second wing consisted entirely of Somalis, commanded by the Imam&#x27;s brother-in-law Matan. The third wing comprised troops from the Afar, Harla, Harari, and Argobba people, with each led by their hereditary leader. During each battle, the wings were separated with one on the right and left, while the Malassay were positioned in the middle. At crucial moments, the Malassay supported both wings and prevented troops from abandoning the field. 

The Adal soldiers donned elaborate helmets and steel armour made up of chain-mail with overlapping tiers. The horsemen of Adal wore protective helmets that covered the entire face except for the eyes, and breastplates on their body, while they harnessed their horses in a similar fashion. In siege warfare, ladders were employed to scale buildings and other high positions such as hills and mountains.

Ethnic Somalis are stated to be the majority of the army according to the &quot;Oxford History of Islam&quot;:

According to Merid Wolde Aregay:

==Legacy==
The Adal Sultanate left behind many structures and artefacts from its heyday. Numerous such historical edifices and items are found in the northwestern Awdal province of Somaliland, as well as other parts of the Horn region where the polity held sway. According to archaeologist Jorge Rodriguez, substances located in western northern Somalia indicate outposts were mainly established during the Adal Sultanate, and don&#x27;t predate the ruins found in ancient Islamic regions of Ifat or Harar plateau, this he states reaffirms the notion that modern eastern Ethiopia is where the principal Muslim kingdoms materialized.

Archaeological excavations in the late 19th century and early 20th century at over fourteen sites in the vicinity of Borama in modern-day northwestern Somaliland unearthed, among other artefacts, silver coins identified as having been derived from Qaitbay (1468–89), the eighteenth Burji Mamluk Sultan of Egypt. Most of these finds are associated with the medieval Adal Sultanate. They were sent to the British Museum for preservation shortly after their discovery.
In 1950, the British Somaliland protectorate government commissioned an archaeological survey in twelve desert towns in present-day Republic of Somaliland, near the border with Ethiopia. According to the expedition team, the sites yielded the most salient evidence of late medieval period affluence. They contained ruins of what were evidently once large cities belonging to the Adal Sultanate. Towns such as Awbare, Awbube, Amud, Abasa and Gogesa, featured between 200 and 300 stone houses. The walls of certain sites still reportedly stood 18 meters high. Excavations in the area yielded 26 silver coins, unlike the copper pieces that were more common in polities below the Horn region. The earliest of these recovered coins had been minted by Sultan Barquq (1382–99), also of the Egyptian Burji dynasty, and the latest were again Sultan Qaitbay issues. All of the pieces had been struck in either Cairo or Damascus. A few gold coins were also discovered during the expedition, making the area the only place in the wider region to yield such pieces. Besides coinage, high quality porcelain was recovered from the Adal sites. The fine celadon ware was found either lying on the surface, or buried at a depth of seven and a half inches, or ensconced within dense middens four to five feet high. Among the artefacts were grey granular sherds with a cracked blue-green or sea-green glaze, and white crystalline fragments with an uncracked green-white glaze. Some Ming dynasty ware was also discovered, including many early Ming blue-and-white bowl sherds. They were adorned with tendril scrolls on a bluish ground and ornamented with black spotting, while other bowls had floral patterns outlined by grey or black-blue designs. Additionally, a few Ming red-and-white sherds were found, as well as white porcelain fragments with bluish highlights. The Adal sites appeared to reach an Indian Ocean terminus at the Sa&#x27;ad ad-Din Islands, named for Sultan Sa&#x27;ad ad-Din II of the Ifat Sultanate.

Additionally, local tradition identifies the archaeological site of Tiya in central Ethiopia as &quot;Yegragn Dingay&quot; (&quot;Gran&#x27;s stone&quot;) in reference to Imam Al-Ghazi. According to Joussaume (1995), who led archaeological work there, the site is relatively recent. It has been dated to between the 11th and 13th centuries CE. Tiya contains a number of megalithic pillars, including anthropomorphic and non-anthropomorphic/non-phallic stelae. Flat in form, these structures are characterized by distinctive, elaborate decorations, among which are swords, a standing human figure with arms akimbo, and plant-like symbols.

<text>The United States Baseball Federation, doing business as USA Baseball, is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that acts as the national governing body for baseball in the United States. USA Baseball is a member of the United States Olympic Committee and the World Baseball Softball Confederation. The organization is responsible for the selection of the United States national team for various international competition, including the senior professional team (World Baseball Classic, Olympic, Premier12, and Pan American Games), the collegiate national team, the various youth national teams (18U, 15U, and 12U), and the women&#x27;s national team. 

Tracing its origins to the formation of the U.S. Amateur Baseball Federation by Leslie Mann in 1932, the modern USA Baseball organization was sanctioned in 1978. Although USA Baseball does not have jurisdiction over Major League Baseball or its affiliates, it is the chief organizer of non-collegiate amateur baseball initiatives through its Sport Development department, including Play Ball and Pitch Smart. USA Baseball also presents the Golden Spikes Award annually to the top amateur baseball player in the country and is responsible for creating the USABat standard.

No player uses uniform number 42 out of respect for the Brooklyn Dodgers Jackie Robinson since 1997, which was the same year the number was retired across Major League Baseball.

== History ==
=== Predecessor organizations ===
The first ever US national baseball team took the field in the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, France, in an unofficial capacity, with the same composition in the 1904 Olympics in St. Louis, which constituted the first time the game had been presented to the Games&#x27; American audiences. In 1912, yet another demonstration event occurred in the Summer Olympics in Stockholm. Only one player on the roster, Jim Thorpe, had extensive experience in the two demonstration games that were held, as the majority of players were track and field athletes.

The national governing body is a de facto successor to the USA Baseball Congress, founded in 1931 by ex-MLB outfielder Leslie Mann, who is also regarded in high esteem as founder of the International Baseball Federation (IBAF). That organization helped formalize the establishment of a full time national team program and establish amateur baseball nationally. Under Leslie&#x27;s guidance, the nascent Team USA, following a 20-game friendship tour of Japan in 1935 took part in the demonstration match at the Summer Olympics in Berlin the next year and participated in the very first Amateur World Series (later known as the Baseball World Cup) two years later, only to lose out to England. They took part in a further two more AWS tournaments before the Second World War.

After 1942, Mann&#x27;s USA Baseball Congress became inactive. American representation in international competition was eventually taken up by collegiate athletic groups took part, with an all-NCAA team of college athletes taking part in the Pan American Games since the first edition held in 1951. This would be the basis of the current USA Baseball Collegiate National Team, which would go on to play an exhibition game at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Japan. Before that, the only all-military team the country fielded in the Summer Olympic Games was in the demonstration game in Melbourne in 1956, with the US Far East Command providing the athletes that competed.

Several amateur baseball groups coalesced to form the United States Baseball Federation in early 1962, with Everett D. Barnes of the American Association of College Baseball Coaches as its president. This version of the USBF initially existed as an affiliate of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. During this time, the group was not sanctioned by the U.S. Olympic Committee, and it clashed with the Amateur Athletic Union (which at the time controlled the USOC) for the right to organize national baseball teams and participate in International Baseball Federation competitions; these tensions came to a head during the selection process for the 1964 Summer Olympic team.

After the 1964 Olympics, the modern incarnation of the USBF was officially incorporated in Michigan on January 6, 1965. However, at this point, it was still operating without official sanction.

=== USA Baseball === 
USA Baseball in its modern form was established as a result of the Amateur Sports Act of 1978, which officially recognized the United States Olympic Committee and allowed it to sanction international amateur sport, including baseball. As the USA received hosting rights for the 1984 Summer Olympics with Los Angeles as the host, the time would come for the birth of a new group to spearhead baseball efforts in the country. USA Baseball was originally based in Trenton, New Jersey upon its establishment on the basis of the old USBF in Michigan. 

The US Baseball Federation then moved to Tucson, Arizona in November 1997 with its facilities being headquartered at Hi Corbett Field and would slowly adopt the brand &quot;USA Baseball&quot; as its official identity, one it carries to the present. It would spend five years in Tucson before moving to its current home in Cary, North Carolina in 2003.

=== 14U and 16U national teams ===
From 1997 to 2011, USA Baseball fielded a 16U national team that participated in the International Baseball Federation World Youth Championships, as well as other tournaments, including the COPABE Pan American Youth Championships and the 1999 PAL World Series.

In its 15-year history, the USA Baseball 16U national team experienced unparalleled success on the international stage. Team USA made it to the championship game of every international tournament it appeared in, taking home 11 gold medals – including nine in World Championships – and three silvers. In addition, eight of those teams went undefeated in international play. The program holds an overall historical record of 99–10 against international opponents, including going 54–2 in world championships.

The 14U national team was created in 2007 and fielded teams for the COPABE Pan American Championships and Pan American Championships Qualifiers until 2011. In that time, the program went undefeated five times in six international tournaments, earning five gold medals and one bronze in its history and finishing with a 39–2 overall record.

In 2011, the two teams were discontinued after the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) changed its youth championships age discipline to 15U. The programs were replaced with the 15U national team and the 14U national team development program.

=== USA Baseball in the Olympic Games ===
Baseball was first introduced to the Olympic Games as an exhibition sport at the Los Angeles 1984 Games and returned as a demonstration sport in the Seoul 1988 Games. In 1984, the United States came in second, losing to Japan in the final, 6–3. Four years later, though, Team USA got Olympic redemption as it won the gold medal over Japan with a 5–3 victory.

Baseball was open only to male amateurs in 1992 and 1996. As a result, the Americans and other nations where professional baseball is developed relied on collegiate players, while Cubans used their most experienced veterans, who technically were considered amateurs as they nominally held other jobs, but in fact trained full-time. In 2000, pros were admitted, but Major League Baseball refused to release its players in 2000, 2004, and 2008, and the situation changed only a little: the Cubans still used their best players, while the Americans started using minor leaguers. The IOC cited the absence of the best players as the main reason for baseball being dropped from the Olympic program.

In contrast, Nippon Professional Baseball has allowed its players to compete in the Olympics, and paused its 2021 season for the duration of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (held in 2021).

At the IOC meeting on July 7, 2005, baseball and softball were voted out of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom, becoming the first sports voted out of the Olympics since polo was eliminated from the 1936 Olympics. The elimination excised 16 teams and more than 300 athletes from the 2012 Olympics. The two slots left available by the IOC&#x27;s elimination were subsequently filled by golf and rugby sevens in 2016. This decision was reaffirmed on February 9, 2006.
In the stands during the 2008 bronze medal game between the U.S. and Japan, IOC head Jacques Rogge was interviewed by MLB.com&#x27;s Mark Newman and cited various criteria for baseball to earn its way back in: &quot;To be on the Olympic program is an issue where you need universality as much as possible. You need to have a sport with a following, you need to have the best players and you need to be in strict compliance with WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency). And these are the qualifications that have to be met. When you have all that, you have to win hearts. You can win the mind, but you still must win hearts.&quot;
It was officially decided in August 2009 at the IOC Board meeting in Berlin that baseball would also not be included in the 2016 Summer Olympics.

On April 1, 2011, the IBAF and the International Softball Federation announced they were preparing a joint proposal to revive play of both sports at the 2020 Summer Olympics.

In August 2011, Olympic news source Around the Rings reported that the ISF and IBAF would not rush into an Olympic proposal, and that the IBAF was working on forming a temporary commission to analyze the prospect of a joint proposal. &quot;In the past, baseball and softball were running alone, and the result was that baseball and softball stayed out,&quot; IBAF president Riccardo Fraccari said in reference to their decades-long push for Olympic inclusion.

On September 8, 2013, the International Olympic Committee voted to reinstate wrestling, defeating the combined baseball-softball bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics.

Under new IOC policies that shift the Games to an &quot;event-based&quot; program rather than sport-based, the host organizing committee can now also propose the addition of sports to the program alongside the permanent &quot;core&quot; events. A second bid for baseball-softball to be included as an event in 2020 was shortlisted by the Tokyo Organizing Committee on June 22, 2015. On August 3, 2016, during the 129th IOC Session in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the IOC approved the Tokyo Organizing Committee&#x27;s final shortlist of five sports, which included baseball, to be included in the program during the 2020 Summer Olympics. Baseball will not be included in the 2024 Paris Olympics, but it is expected that it will be included along with softball, in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics due to baseball&#x27;s popularity in the United States.

USA Baseball started using minor league athletes for the first time in 1999 with the 2000 Olympic Team being one of the first professional national teams to represent the U.S. in international competition. Led by Manager Tommy Lasorda and featuring players Ben Sheets, Ernie Young, and Brad Wilkerson, Team USA went 8–1 in the tournament en route to the Olympic gold medal. The 2000 Olympic Team was later named the USOC Team of the Year.

After failing to qualify for the Athens 2004 Games, the U.S. returned to the Olympics in 2008, finishing with a 6–3 record and claiming the bronze medal with an 8–4 defeat of Japan.

===World Baseball Classic 2023===
The World Baseball Classic is a national team tournament that is staged every four years. The most recent one in 2023 included many amazing points from USA&#x27;s Trea Turner. They lost the championship against Japan: JPN 3–2 USA.

==National teams==

===Professional National Team ===

Established 1999 the Professional National Team section (USAB-PNT) is the flagship and seniormost of all the national teams of USA Baseball. Since 1999, USA Baseball has been selecting teams of professional-level Minor and Major League (MLB) players to represent the United States in various international competitions, including the World Baseball Classic. It constitutes the elitest and most prestigious of all the team programs and its rosters have occasionally come from the teams mentioned below.

It carries the heritage (but not the lineage) of the national demonstration teams the nation sent to the Summer Olympics of 1900-04, 1912 and 1936.

==== Olympics and related competitions&#x27; PNT ====

The first professional national team that the organization selected participated in the 1999 Pan American Games in Winnipeg. The team went 5–2 in the tournament, eventually making it to the gold medal game, where it lost to Cuba 5–1 to claim the silver medal.

Also among the first teams of minor league players that USA Baseball fielded was the 2000 U.S. Olympic Baseball Team, managed by Tommy Lasorda at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. Behind a stellar performance on the mound by Ben Sheets, the team of minor league players defeated Cuba for the gold medal. In 2008, a Davey Johnson-led U.S. team featuring Dexter Fowler, Matt LaPorta, and Stephen Strasburg, took home the bronze medal from the Beijing Games. The USA returned to Olympics baseball in 2021 with Mike Scioscia as team manager but lost to Japan for silver.

In 2011, USA Baseball fielded one team of professional minor league players to compete in both the World Cup and Pan American Games. The Pan American team posted a 10–6 record and took home the silver medal from Lagos de Moreno, Mexico. Joe Thurston and Brett Jackson led the team offensively, and Andy Van Hekken and Drew Smyly contributed strong pitching performances.

The World Cup team was named co-bronze medalist of the IBAF Baseball World Cup, which was played in Panama. The U.S. shared the honor with Canada after their bronze-medal game was rained out.

In 2015, USA Baseball fielded two professional national teams, once again made up of minor league players, for the Toronto 2015 Pan American Games and the WBSC Premier12. The U.S. claimed the silver medal in both events. The Pan American Games roster featured Albert Almora, Jr., Tyler Pastornicky, Paul Sewald, and Zach Eflin, while the Premier12 team was led by Matt McBride, Adam Frazier, and Anthony Vasquez.

USA Baseball once again fielded a collegiate-minor league national team in 2019 for the WBSC Premier12. The event is a qualifier for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and was to be held in November.
====World Baseball Classic National Team====
Following the removal of baseball from the Olympic program in 2005, the World Baseball Classic (WBC) was proposed by MLB, the Major League Baseball Players Association, and other professional baseball leagues and their players associations around the world. Subsequently, the tournament was created and the first installment was played in 2006. Unique to the event is the use of MLB players on the rosters, marking the first team in USA Baseball history to feature MLB-level athletes.

For the inaugural 2006 World Baseball Classic, Team USA featured stars such as Chase Utley, Derek Jeter, and Chipper Jones. In the second installment of the WBC in 2009, with Dustin Pedroia, Jimmy Rollins, and Jeter donning the red, white, and blue, the U.S. team finished fourth, losing to Japan in the semifinals.

The 2013 WBC team was managed by Joe Torre and led by David Wright, Joe Mauer, and Rollins. Team USA advanced to the second round of the tournament before falling to Puerto Rico.

Team USA had its best showing in the tournament so far in 2017, taking home the Classic championship crown. Managed by Jim Leyland and featuring Marcus Stroman, Christian Yelich, Adam Jones, Eric Hosmer, Buster Posey, and Brandon Crawford, the U.S. went 6–2 en route to the title. The team opened the tournament with a dramatic 3–2 walk-off victory in extra innings over Colombia and took down the defending champions Dominican Republic – with the help of an iconic catch from Jones that robbed Manny Machado of a home run in the second round to advance to the semifinals.

Following a rain-soaked 2–1 victory over Japan, Team USA went head-to-head against Puerto Rico, which had beaten the U.S. 6–5 earlier in the tournament, in the final, and put together an 8–0 win. Stroman got the start and took a no-hitter into the seventh inning of the contest, giving up just one hit and one walk in his six innings of work. The offense backed up Stroman&#x27;s outing with a 13-hit showing that led to eight runs, five of which came with two outs, to secure the shutout victory and USA Baseball&#x27;s first WBC championship.

Stroman was named the MVP of the tournament, while Hosmer (1B) and Yelich (OF) were both named to the WBC All-Tournament team.

Returning in 2023, this time with Mark DeRosa as team skipper, the national WBC squad, led by OF Mike Trout, led the nation on a near successful defense of the championship, ending up with silver.

ALL-TIME TEAM USA WORLD BASEBALL CLASSIC RESULTS:

===Collegiate national team===
The USA Baseball collegiate national team (CNT) is composed of the top draft-ineligible collegiate baseball players in the country. The team competes each summer in a schedule of exhibition games across the U.S. and overseas against the world&#x27;s top baseball talent. As part of this schedule, the U.S. takes on the Japan Collegiate All-Stars nearly every summer and squares off in international friendship series against Canada, Chinese Taipei, Cuba, and the Netherlands.

The collegiate program has had great success in recent years. In 2009, the U.S. won the inaugural World Baseball Challenge in Canada, and the 2011 team posted an 11–2–1 record, defeating Japan in four of five games during their international friendship series.

In 2013, the USA-Cuba International Friendship series returned to the U.S. for the first time since 1996, with Team USA putting together an historic five-game sweep of the Cuban national team. The collegiate national team also traveled abroad to compete in the 39th annual USA vs. Japan Collegiate All-Star series, where the host nation claimed a 3–2 series victory.

The 2014 collegiate national team also enjoyed success in its summer tour, finishing with an 18–8–2 record, including going 7–1 in the XXVIII Haarlem Baseball Week tournament. In 2016, Team USA traveled to Cuba for the fifth installment of the USA vs. Cuba International Friendship series. For the first time in USA Baseball history, the team claimed a series against Cuba on Cuban soil, courtesy of Keston Hiura&#x27;s pinch-hit home run in the final game of the series that secured a 2–1 defeat of the home country and a 3–2 series victory.

In 2017, the collegiate national team contributed to USA Baseball&#x27;s historic sweep of international competition with series wins over all three of its international opponents that year, including Chinese Taipei, Cuba, and Japan. The 2018 collegiate national team then followed that with another sweep, once again collecting series wins over Chinese Taipei, Cuba, and Japan. The program followed its 2017 success with another strong showing in 2018, once again sweeping its three international series against Chinese Taipei, Japan, and Cuba and finishing with an 11–3 record in international play. The series win against Cuba was just the second time in USA Baseball history that the team has won a series against Cuba on Cuban soil.

Players who have taken the field for the collegiate national team and have gone on to have successful MLB careers include Jim Abbott, Alex Bregman, Kris Bryant, Troy Glaus, Todd Helton, Ryan Howard, Barry Larkin, Tino Martinez, Pedroia, David Price, Huston Street, Dansby Swanson, Mark Teixeira, Troy Tulowitzki, Jason Varitek, and Ryan Zimmerman.

Established 1951 in time for the first ever Pan American Games, it constitutes the oldest continuous active component of the national program, and participated in every major international baseball event until 1998. For many years before the PNT was created in 1999 the CNT was the flagship of the national programs USA Baseball offered to younger players and was the sole team program of the federation from its foundation until the 1980s when the 18U team was created. During this period, the USAB-CNT was, from 1984 to 1996, the de facto national Olympics team for the USA that won silver in 1984, gold in 1988 and bronze in 1996.

===18U national team===

Composed of the nation&#x27;s top players ages 16 to 18, the USA Baseball 18U national team is a perennial power on the international baseball scene. The team competes in two major events in biannual cycles – the COPABE Pan American “AAA” Championships and the WBSC U-18 Baseball World Cup. The program has won seven straight international tournament titles dating back to 2011, including winning the last four WBSC U-18 Baseball World Cups in 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2017.

In 2017, the 18U national team continued USA Baseball&#x27;s unprecedented sweep of international competition with a dominant showing in the WBSC U-18 Baseball World Cup. The team went undefeated for just the second time in the program&#x27;s history, and the first since 1989, while the pitching staff tallied an incredible 0.47 collective ERA en route to the gold medal.

For the second consecutive year, the 18U national team finished a stellar USA Baseball season on a high note. The team traveled to Panama for the 2018 COPABE U-18 Pan-American Championships in November and dominated to claim its fifth Pan-American Championships gold medal in a row and its eighth-straight gold medal in international competition dating back to 2011. The team had a historic run to the title, outscoring its opponents 131–27 in nine games while going undefeated. The 131 runs scored are the most an 18U National Team has ever scored in international competition.

Current major leaguers Matt Holliday, Bryce Harper, Clayton Kershaw, Buster Posey, Eric Hosmer, Freddie Freeman, and Justin Upton have all worn USA jerseys as 18U players. The 18U program is the second oldest of Team USA&#x27;s constituent programs which began in the late 1980s.

===15U National Team===
In 2012, USA Baseball rolled out its first 15U national team. The program, composed of some of the most talented young players across the country, played four games in the Dominican Republic against the Dominicans and Puerto Rico. Team USA went 4–0 abroad, outscoring their opponents, 31–3.

In 2013, the 15U team traveled to Barranquilla, Colombia, for the COPABE Pan American &quot;AA&quot; Championships, where it brought home the gold medal for the first time. En route to defeating Cuba, 6–1, in the championship game, the 15U squad amassed a perfect record, finishing 8–0 in the event.

Competing in its first WBSC U-15 Baseball World Cup in 2014, Team USA traveled to Mazatlan, Mexico, and went 9–1 overall and claimed the silver medal. The 2014 campaign also had the 15U national team&#x27;s Brice Turang bring home the 15U&#x27;s first USA Baseball Richard W. &quot;Dick&quot; Case Player of the Year award, given to the athlete who is not only an outstanding player on the field, but also exemplified sportsmanship and love of the game.

USA Baseball&#x27;s national team championships (NTCs), 14U national team development program, and national team identification series (NTIS) help the organization identify players for the 15U national neam. The NTCs are held in Arizona and Florida and up to 72 teams compete in each region. USA Baseball representatives and scouts select the top players from each event to make up the national team.

Starting in 2017, a new trials system was introduced for the 15U program that includes two phases and 72 athletes vying for just 20 spots on Team USA&#x27;s roster. The pool of talent is then narrowed to 34 players for phase two before the final 20 are named.

Following 2018 trials and training at the National Training Complex, the 15U national team traveled to David, Panama, where it claimed the program&#x27;s first WBSC U-15 Baseball World Cup gold medal.
===12U National Team===
In 2013, USA Baseball launched its first 12U National Team. The team, which was composed of some of the most talented young players from across the county, traveled to Taipei City, Taiwan, and came home with its first International Baseball Federation 12U World Cup gold medal. After lengthy pool play, the 12U team defeated the host, Chinese Taipei, in the World Cup final, 8–1. The game was attended by over 10,000 home fans and was broadcast throughout parts of Asia and online.

The 12U national team is composed of players selected from the NTIS, the 12U National Open through the 12U open development camps and the 11U futures invitational.

In 2015, the 12U national team claimed its second world championship in a row with a 7–2 win over Chinese Taipei in the WBSC U-12 Baseball World Cup. The program then followed that with a silver medal at the 2016 COPABE Pan American &quot;A&quot; Championships. A third consecutive gold medal in the WBSC U-12 Baseball World Cup in 2017 with another 7–2 defeat of Chinese Taipei marked the team&#x27;s contribution to USA Baseball&#x27;s 2017 sweep of international competition.

The 12U national team returned to the COPABE U-12 Pan American Championships in 2018, where it claimed its first gold medal in the event. Team USA went undefeated in the event, outscoring its opponents 127-7 and winning all nine of its games by a 13-run average margin.
===Women&#x27;s national team===

The USA Baseball women&#x27;s national team was established in 2004 when an 18-player team was chosen following open tryouts across the nation. The team went on to capture the gold medal in the first IBAF Women&#x27;s Baseball World Cup in Edmonton, Canada. Team USA repeated as IBAF World Cup gold medalists in 2006 in Taiwan, before taking home the bronze medal at the 2008 World Cup in Japan and again in 2010 in Venezuela.

In 2012 and 2014, the women&#x27;s national team won the silver medal at the WBSC Women&#x27;s Baseball World Cup in Edmonton, Canada, and Miyazaki, Japan, respectively. The 2015 women&#x27;s national team competed in the Toronto 2015 Pan American Games and claimed gold, defeating Canada 11–3 to earn the championship.

When not competing in international tournaments, the team hosts a women&#x27;s national team development program, leads youth clinics, and works to grow the game of baseball among women in the U.S.

The 2018 women&#x27;s national team was named following the Women&#x27;s National Open and Women&#x27;s National Team Trials in June of that year. The 20-woman team competes in the 2018 WBSC Women&#x27;s Baseball World Cup, which was held in the U.S. for the first time, from August 22–31 at the USSSA Space Coast Complex in Viera, Florida. Team USA finished the World Cup 6–3 with a 1.98 team ERA and a collective .288 average.
==National Team Development Programs==
At age levels where international competitions are not held, the national team development program (NTDP) offers an unmatched developmental opportunity to better prepare athletes for potential future national teams and introduce them to the USA Baseball organization. It also serves to help young players grow and prepare for the next steps in their respective baseball careers.

Since the program&#x27;s inception in 2012, 64 NTDP attendees have earned spots on national team rosters at the 15U, 18U, and collegiate national team levels. Additionally, in the five years that NTDP participants have been eligible, 21 players have been selected in the first five rounds of the MLB First-year Player Draft.

===17U NTDP===
In 2012, USA Baseball fielded its first 17U NTDP. Members of the 17U NTDP are identified through the USA Baseball National Team Championships in Arizona and Florida, as well as the USA Baseball NTIS.

Four members of the 2016 17U NTDP went on to play on the 2017 18U national team that claimed the program&#x27;s fourth consecutive WBSC U-18 Baseball World Cup gold medal. In 2018, the week-long 17U NTDP was held in Chicago.

American Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Famer Jack Leggett served as the field coordinator for the event in 2018 after coaching in 2017. The head coach at Northwestern University, Spencer Allen, and current University of Texas head coach, David Pierce, joined Leggett on staff and served as the managers for the Stripes team and Stars team, respectively.

Coaches and evaluators assess 40 athletes during the NTDP week; evaluators made up of former professional players, respected collegiate and high-school coaches, and professional scouts.

===16U NTDP===
In 2018, USA Baseball introduced a 16U age level to its NTDP.

The 16U NTDP will feature athletes selected from the 15U NTIS, the newly reinstated 16U national team championships, and through recommendations from professional scouts, USA Baseball task force members, and collegiate, high-school, and youth coaches.

For its inaugural season, the 16U NTDP was led by three-time USA Baseball national team coach and seven-time NTDP field coordinator, Eric Kibler. University of Dayton Head Coach Jayson King joined Kibler on staff as the manager of the Stripes team, while Bill Mosiello, who is currently the associate head coach at Texas Christian University, managed the Stars team.

Coaches and evaluators assess 36 athletes during the NTDP week.

===14U NTDP===
Along with the 17U NTDP, 2012 was the inaugural year for the 14U NTDP. Members of the 14U NTDP are identified through the USA Baseball national team championships in Arizona and Florida and the USA Baseball NTIS.

With the introduction of a new 15U National Team Trials system in 2017, 18 players from the 14U NTDP are selected each year to compete for a national team roster spot in that year&#x27;s 15U National Team Trials. In 2017, two athletes from the 2017 14U NTDP made the 2017 15U national team through the new system and won gold with Team USA at the COPABE Pan American “AA” Championships.

The 2018 14U NTDP took place at the USA Baseball National Training Complex, July 23–27.

Current St. Thomas Aquinas (Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.) head coach and former 15U national team assistant coach, Troy Cameron, was selected as the 14U NTDP field coordinator. Scott Grove, the head coach at The First Academy (Orlando, Fla.), served as the event&#x27;s pitching coordinator, while current St. Mary&#x27;s College head coach, Eric Valenzuela, and current Indiana University head coach, Chris Lemonis, managed the Stars and Stripes teams, respectively.

=== National Training Complex ===
In March 2003, with the area&#x27;s family-friendly environment, already-rapid growth, and proximity to sports cities Chapel Hill, Durham, Raleigh, and Charlotte, Cary, North Carolina was chosen as the destination for the national governing body of baseball. An agreement was reached with the town to create a complex and headquarters there and the USA Baseball National Training Complex opened in June 2007. The first event held at the facility was the 2007 USA Baseball Tournament of Stars, which served as the primary identification event for the organization&#x27;s 18U national team from 2007 to 2018.
The USA Baseball National Training Complex at Thomas Brooks Park in Cary, North Carolina is located within the 221-acre Thomas Brooks Park. The complex includes four baseball fields – a stadium field and three training fields – all with dimensions of 330 feet down the lines and 400 feet in centerfield. All fields are maintained at Major League Baseball standards.

In recognition of more than 30 years of public service and countless accomplishments for the citizens of Cary, the Cary Town Council named the stadium field in honor of former Town Manager William B. Coleman, Jr., upon his retirement on October 17, 2008. Coleman Field has a press box that includes two suites, an official scorer&#x27;s room, a sound room, and a press row. Spectator seating is for 1,754 people, including handicapped-accessible seating, and additional grass seating for about 250 people. All fields have access to restroom facilities and a concession building.

The National Training Complex (NTC) is also home to the flagship USA Baseball Team Store, which is open during all USA Baseball events at the complex. The NTC was expanded in 2022-2024 with the construction of a brand new national main office for USA Baseball and additional training facilities.

==USA Baseball events==

===National High School Invitational===
Every March, the USA Baseball National High School Invitational (NHSI) presented by the Greater Raleigh Sports Alliance and the Town of Cary brings together 16 of the top prep teams in the country to compete in what has become the premiere event on the high-school baseball calendar. As no event currently brings in a level of talent from top to bottom that the NHSI promises, the eventual tournament champion will kick off its respective season with recognition as the top high-school baseball team in the country.

The NHSI, which not only features the top teams in the country, but also some of the best amateur baseball players, is a 16-team, single-elimination championship tournament. Each participating team is guaranteed to play four games. The NHSI presents participating athletes with national exposure in addition to providing the opportunity for the best teams in the country to compete against each other.

In 2012, Mater Dei High School (Santa Ana, Calif.) claimed the inaugural NHSI title in dramatic fashion with a 3–2 walk-off win over Harvard-Westlake (Studio City, Calif.). The 2013 edition of the tournament was once again won by Mater Dei with another defeat of Harvard-Westlake before The First Academy (Orlando, Fla.) took home the trophy in 2014.

In the 2018 NHSI, Orange Lutheran High School (Orange, Calif.) became the second school in NHSI history to defend its title when it secured the 2018 championship with a dominant 9–3 victory over Green Hope High School (Cary, N.C.) in the final. Green Hope went on an historic run en route to its runner-up finish, not only becoming the first North Carolina school to reach the NHSI championship game, but also the first to advance past its opening round game in the event.
=== National Team Championships ===
The USA Baseball National Team Championships in Florida and Arizona are the primary identification events for players to be considered for the 15U National Team and the 14U, 16U and 17U National Team Development Programs (NTDP).

The National Team Championships first started in 1997 as the USA Junior Olympic Baseball Championships and was a joint venture between USA Baseball and the United States Olympic Committee. At its inception, the event was a tournament for 16-and-under travel baseball teams that was used to identify talent for the USA Baseball 16U National Team.

When USA Baseball moved from New Jersey to Arizona in 1998, the then-56 team tournament moved out west, as well, where it was contested at the spring training homes of the Colorado Rockies and the Chicago White Sox/Arizona Diamondbacks. With the popularity and size of the event growing exponentially, it was expanded to a second location in 2001, once again including the East Coast with a location in Fort Myers, Florida.

In 2009, the tournament was renamed and expanded once more, this time to include a second age group. Now called the National Team Championships, a 14U division was added to identify talent for the USA Baseball 14U national team. However, when the WBSC changed its international competition age groups from 16U to 15U in 2012, a 15U division was added to the National Team Championships for the new 15U national team, the 16U division was changed to 17U and the 17U and 14U divisions now funneled into the newly created NTDP.

Through this event, which is still held annually in both Arizona and Florida, USA Baseball provides an opportunity for 400+ teams to showcase their ability against teams from all across the country.

In Florida, the USA Baseball National Team Championships are held in Palm Beach County, Florida, at Roger Dean Stadium, the spring-training home of the St. Louis Cardinals and Miami Marlins, and The Ballpark of the Palm Beaches, the spring-training home of the 2017 World Series Champions Houston Astros and the Washington Nationals.

In Arizona, the USA Baseball National Team Championships are held in Glendale, Goodyear, Peoria, and Surprise, Arizona, at the spring-training homes of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Cleveland Indians, San Diego Padres, Texas Rangers, Cincinnati Reds, Kansas City Royals, and Chicago White Sox.

===Futures Invitational===
The USA Baseball 10U and 11U Futures Invitational are elite, invitation-only youth championship events, exclusively reserved for top 10U and 11U teams and athletes. The four-day, championship tournaments will both be hosted at the USA Baseball National Training Complex, the official training site of Team USA and adjoining Thomas Brooks Park and/or Middle Creek Park in Cary, North Carolina. Both the 10U and 11U event will host the best teams from across the country featuring the top youth talent in the nation.

===National Team Identification Series (NTIS)===
The USA Baseball National Team Identification Series (NTIS) is the most comprehensive player identification program offered by Team USA. Players from across the country will participate in selection events and tryouts on the regional level with the aim of ultimately being named to their regional team. Those regional teams will then compete in their respective age groups against the 15 other regions from across the country at the culminating National Team Identification Series Champions Cup event at the USA Baseball National Training Complex in Cary, North Carolina, in the fall of 2019.

The program includes six separate men&#x27;s age groups – 11U, 13U, 14U, 15U, 16U and 17U. From the final 2018 NTIS event, USA Baseball will invite a minimum of 68 players to future National Team Trials, National Team Development Program (NTDP) and Tournament of Stars opportunities with the ultimate goal of being selected to represent our country as a part of Team USA in 2019.

All of the regional teams within each age group will be put together by our various NTIS Regional Directors. These various regional directors will be responsible for identifying and selecting 18-player teams which will participate in the culminating event in Cary, North Carolina.

===12U NTIS===
Held in various locations throughout the country, the 12U NTIS will offer athletes across the U.S. the opportunity to become involved with Team USA, while providing instruction, evaluation and fun. Players from the 12U NTIS will be recommended to USA Baseball officials and, from those recommendations, USA Baseball will invite 128 players to participate in the 12U National Open.

To find a tryout near you, please visit USABaseball.com.

===Women&#x27;s National Open===
The USA Baseball Women&#x27;s National Open brings together more than 100 of the top female baseball players in the country to compete against each other for the chance to earn a spot on the Women&#x27;s National Team Trials roster. These players are split into six teams, competing in games and participating in positional workouts while being scouted and evaluated by the Women&#x27;s National Team staff. Following the conclusion of the event, the 40-woman Women&#x27;s National Team Trials roster is announced, followed by National Team Trials and Training, as well as the World Baseball Softball (WBSC) Women&#x27;s Baseball World Cup.

===USA Baseball Cups===
The 2019 USA Baseball&#x27;s 14U and 16U Cups are open-invitation tournaments composed of 32 teams. The 14U and 16U Cups will involve 16 teams each. Each team is guaranteed four games (weather permitting). The events are held in Cary, North Carolina, at the USA Baseball National Training Complex. USA Baseball will award 32 teams the right to participate based on an application approval process.

== Sport Development ==
The USA Baseball Sport Development team aims to grow the game of baseball through youth programs, player development, safety and educational initiatives. The Sport Development website – SportDev.org – houses all USA Baseball&#x27;s development initiatives, educational resources, certifications and blog material. The website provides free online education courses and resources, development initiatives such as Hit and Run, Fun At Bat and the Prospect Development Pipeline, coach and umpire certification and the Sport Development Blog.

=== MLB/USA Baseball events ===
As part of an ongoing partnership, USA Baseball and Major League Baseball have worked together to create a host of events that contribute to the growth and proliferation of the game of baseball, as well as the identification and growth of young athletes.

====Breakthrough Series====
The Breakthrough Series, established in 2008, is a joint effort on behalf of USA Baseball and Major League Baseball. This unique program focuses on developing the player on and off the field through seminars, mentorship, gameplay, scout evaluations, video coverage, and the highest level of instruction all while providing a platform for the players to perform for scouts and collegiate coaches. The events are completely cost free with USA Baseball covering expenses for the players.

Players in the MLB and USA Baseball diversity pipeline, including the Breakthrough Series, Dream Series and Elite Development Invitational may be offered additional development and instructional opportunities throughout the year. Affording participants touch points at different times during the season will allow for consistent growth opportunities both in competitive and non-competitive settings and will aide in the continued advancement of their life and baseball skills.

====Elite Development Invitational====
Utilizing the successful Breakthrough Series instructional model incorporating multiple seminars, Major League Baseball, USA Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association teamed up to develop the revolutionary Elite Development Invitational.

In 2017, the event welcomed 200 players (ages 12–17) and more than two dozen coaches with a combined 200-plus years of baseball experience to historic Dodgertown in Vero Beach, Florida, for two weeks of intensive instruction.

The wide-ranging group of coaches covered every field position and instructed players in a variety of workouts and game situations throughout the week.

Players in the MLB and USA Baseball diversity pipeline, including the Breakthrough Series and Elite Development Invitational may be offered additional development and instructional opportunities throughout the year. Affording participants touch points at different times during the season will allow for consistent growth opportunities both in competitive and non-competitive settings and will aide in the continued advancement of their life and baseball skills.

Over 30 former professional players including veterans like Jerry Manuel, Maury Wills, Tom Gordon, Lee Smith, Marquis Grissom, and Endy Chavez served as instructors with Commissioner Manfred, Joe Torre, Harold Reynolds, Dusty Baker and Dee Gordon stopping by to share their knowledge and experiences. Facilitating a Spring Training atmosphere for the aspiring professional players, days consisted of individual work, games, situational play, &quot;chalk talk&quot; and nightly seminars about the baseball industry.

====Trailblazer Series====
In 2017, USA Baseball and Major League Baseball launched a new baseball tournament for girls, held in the greater Los Angeles area, and built around Jackie Robinson Day Weekend. In 2018, approximately 100 girls, once again, had an unprecedented opportunity to participate in the Trailblazer Series.

====Dream Series====
The Dream Series, established in 2017, is operated by Major League Baseball and USA Baseball. This event will host a diverse group of more than 60 high school pitchers and catchers from across the country, in a special development camp atmosphere as well as a showcase for professional scouts and collegiate recruiters.

In addition to the on-field actions, participants will receive daily presentations from former Major Leaguers, scouts, college administrators, umpires and other industry professionals. The focus of these presentations will be to prepare the prospect for the collegiate and professional recruiting processes and offer information about alternative careers within the baseball industry. As in similar amateur development camps, a large contingent of college recruiters and professional scouts are expected to attend and evaluate players who demonstrate potential, but may not have had the opportunity for exposure through other events.

Coaches at this year&#x27;s Dream Series include Bob Didier, Marvin Freeman, Marquis Grissom, LaTroy Hawkins, Kenny Hill, Charles Johnson, Jerry Manuel, Darren Oliver, Dave Stewart, and Lenny Webster.

===Online educational resources===
Education is one of the fundamental building blocks of the game. As such, USA Baseball&#x27;s educational resources emphasize a culture of development, safety and fun within the sport through free online training courses and programs for players, parents, coaches and umpires. Content is available in both English and Spanish.

===Mobile Coach===
The USA Baseball Mobile Coach App, free to all users, features practice plans, unique drills, and video tutorials to assist coaches of all levels to run competent, safe, age and skill appropriate practices for their players.

===Long-Term Athlete Development Plan (LTAD)===
USA Baseball, with support from Major League Baseball (MLB), has generated a Long-Term Athlete Development Plan (LTAD) to provide a multi-stage developmental pathway for an individual&#x27;s lifelong experience within the sport of baseball in the United States. Through developmentally appropriate programs for all ages, the LTAD aims to increase participation, aid in performance, and enhance enjoyment across the sport of baseball. The LTAD plan is a culmination of evidence-based information from the principal contributor group and input from a leadership group consisting of experts from the medical safety industry, MLB league and club executives, and an advisory group inclusive of leaders from across the amateur baseball spectrum.

===High school baseball manual===
The high school baseball program manual has been developed to support the thousands of dedicated high school coaches around the country in their quest to provide a positive, development-based experience to their student-athletes.

===Prospect Development Pipeline (PDP)===
The Prospect Development Pipeline (PDP) is a collaborative effort between Major League Baseball (MLB) and USA Baseball. The program established an official identification and player assessment pathway for elite high school age amateur baseball players in the United States to all 30 MLB Clubs for the amateur draft.

===Play Ball===
Play Ball is a collaborative initiative between Major League Baseball and USA Baseball that highlights the many ways baseball can be played, including ways outside of traditionally organized baseball leagues and tournaments. Events hosted around the country provide an opportunity for youth to experience the game in a variety of different forms in a non-competitive environment.

===Pitch Smart===
Pitch Smart is a joint initiative by Major League Baseball and USA Baseball that provides a series of practical, age-appropriate guidelines to help parents, players and coaches avoid overuse injuries and foster long, healthy careers for youth pitchers.

===Fun At Bat===
Fun At Bat is an entry-level bat and ball program for kids with an emphasis on character development, functional movement, active play, and fun. The initiative stems from meticulous research on introductory youth sport programs and is supported by Major League Baseball, USA Baseball and industry professionals.

=== Baseball5 ===
Baseball5 is being promoted as an accessible variation of baseball. USA Baseball offers Baseball5 equipment in conjunction with GameMaster Athletic.

===Hit and Run Baseball===
Hit and Run Baseball is a joint initiative between Major League Baseball and USA Baseball that provides guidelines for fun, new ways to engage youth baseball players in formal competitive play. The program serves youth leagues, tournament providers and amateur coaches by providing game modification recommendations focused on pace of play and additional skill building opportunities for athletes that are designed to occur more frequently than traditional gameplay exposure.

===Coach and umpire certification===
Utilizing USA Baseball&#x27;s educational content and achieving a certification keeps coaches current with what is happening in the modern game of baseball. It&#x27;s great for overall professional growth. Whether you coach a recreational youth team or one of our National Teams, we have education for you and a certification to go along with it. All great leaders in the game are also lifelong learners, always looking for new things to implement within their programs. We can never learn or achieve too much. We are pleased to offer Coach and Umpire Certification pathways to help you on your journey in our national pastime.

===Baseball ACE===
Baseball ACE is an educational program for any and all individuals who are currently coaching baseball or aspire to coach at any level of the game. Offered in partnership by USA Baseball and the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA), this program aims to create a culture of continuing education, professional development and mentorship within the baseball coaching community.

==USABat==
USA Baseball, the national governing body for the sport of baseball in the U.S., in conjunction with participating national member organizations has adopted a new method for measuring bat performance in the testing of youth bats. Informed by the research of leading scientists on the USA Baseball Bat Study Committee, and supported by its National Member Organizations, — including the American Amateur Baseball Congress (AABC), Babe Ruth Baseball/Cal Ripken Baseball, Dixie Youth Baseball &amp; Dixie Boys Baseball, Little League Baseball and PONY Baseball — USA Baseball has concluded that recent advancements in science, engineering, technology, and the materials available to fabricate non-wood bats, now allow the manufacturers to construct youth bats that can perform at a wood-like level through the entire range of lengths and weights of youth bats.

The new USA Baseball bat standard (USABat), which applies to bats that are classified below the NCAA and NFHS level of play, will be implemented on January 1, 2018, allowing the bat manufacturers sufficient time to bring these bats to the marketplace.

Similar to the NCAA and NFHS BBCOR standard, which helped to eliminate discrepancies with different length bats and thus provide a more direct measure of bat performance, the USA Baseball bat standard will allow youth baseball organizations in the United States to reach their goal of establishing a wood-like standard, a standard that will provide for the long-term integrity of the game.

==Golden Spikes Award==
Since 1978, USA Baseball has honored the top amateur baseball player in the nation with the Golden Spikes Award. The award is presented in partnership with the Rod Dedeaux Foundation and is given each year to the player who best exhibits exceptional on-field ability and exemplary sportsmanship.

In 2018, California&#x27;s Andrew Vaughn won the prestigious award in a presentation on ESPN&#x27;s flagship program, SportsCenter. Following the nationally televised announcement of the winner, the finalists and their families were celebrated at the Jonathan Club Los Angeles as part of the 2018 Rod Dedeaux Foundation Awards Dinner.

In 2020, USA Baseball announced that it would forego naming a Golden Spikes Award winner given the canceled 2020 college baseball season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Past winners also include Terry Francona (1980), Will Clark (1985), Robin Ventura (1988), Jason Varitek (1994), J.D. Drew (1997), Mark Prior (2001), Jered Weaver (2004), Tim Lincecum (2006), David Price (2007), Buster Posey (2008), Stephen Strasburg (2009), Bryce Harper (2010), Trevor Bauer (2011), Mike Zunino (2012), Kris Bryant (2013), A.J. Reed (2014), Andrew Benintendi (2015), Kyle Lewis (2016) and Brendan McKay (2017).

== Organizational awards ==
Every year, USA Baseball recognizes the top National Team coach, developmental coach, volunteer coach, player, performance and team from the past season with its organizational awards.

<text>Lamivudine, commonly called 3TC, is an antiretroviral medication used to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. It is also used to treat chronic hepatitis B when other options are not possible. It is effective against both HIV-1 and HIV-2. It is typically used in combination with other antiretrovirals such as zidovudine, dolutegravir, and abacavir. Lamivudine may be included as part of post-exposure prevention in those who have been potentially exposed to HIV. Lamivudine is taken by mouth as a liquid or tablet.
Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, headaches, feeling tired, and cough. Serious side effects include liver disease, lactic acidosis, and worsening hepatitis B among those already infected. It is safe for people over three months of age and can be used during pregnancy. The medication can be taken with or without food. Lamivudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and works by blocking the HIV reverse transcriptase and hepatitis B virus polymerase.
Lamivudine was patented in 1995 and approved for use in the United States in 1995. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.

==Medical uses==
Lamivudine (Epivir) is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV‑1 infection. Lamivudine (Epivir HBV) is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection associated with evidence of hepatitis B viral replication and active liver inflammation.

Lamivudine has been used for treatment of chronic hepatitis B at a lower dose than for treatment of HIV/AIDS. It improves the seroconversion of e-antigen positive hepatitis B and also improves histology staging of the liver. Long-term use of lamivudine leads to emergence of a resistant hepatitis B virus (YMDD) mutant. Despite this, lamivudine is still used widely as it is well tolerated.

===Resistance===

In HIV, high level resistance is associated with the M184V/I mutation in the reverse transcriptase gene as reported by Raymond Schinazi&#x27;s group at Emory University. GlaxoSmithKline claimed that the M184V mutation reduces &quot;viral fitness&quot;, because of the finding that continued lamivudine treatment causes the HIV viral load to rebound but at a much lower level, and that withdrawal of lamivudine results in a higher viral load rebound with rapid loss of the M184V mutation; GSK therefore argued that there may be benefit in continuing lamivudine treatment even in the presence of high level resistance, because the resistant virus is &quot;less fit&quot;. The COLATE study has suggested that there is no benefit to continuing lamivudine treatment in patients with lamivudine resistance. A better explanation of the data is that lamivudine continues to have a partial anti-viral effect even in the presence of the M184V mutation.

In hepatitis B, lamivudine resistance was first described in the YMDD (tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate) locus of the HBV reverse transcriptase gene. The HBV reverse transcriptase gene is 344 amino acids long and occupies codons 349 to 692 on the viral genome. The most commonly encountered resistance mutations are M204V/I/S. The change in amino acid sequence from YMDD to YIDD results in a 3.2 fold reduction in the error rate of the reverse transcriptase, which correlates with a significant growth disadvantage of the virus. Other resistance mutations are L80V/I, V173L and L180M.

==Side effects==

# Minor side effects may include nausea, fatigue, headaches, diarrhea, cough and nasal congestion.
# Do not prescribe lamivudine/zidovudine, abacavir/lamivudine, or abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine to patients taking emtricitabine.
# Long-term use of lamivudine can trigger a resistant hepatitis B virus (YMDD) mutant.
# HIV or HBV-infected women on lamivudine are warned to discontinue breastfeeding as this puts the baby at risk for HIV transmission and medication side effects. 
# Patients who are infected with HIV and HCV and are on both interferon and lamivudine can experience liver damage. 
# The drug can trigger an inflammatory response to opportunistic infections (e.g., Mycobacterium avium complex [MAC], M. tuberculosis, cytomegalovirus [CMV], Pneumocystis jirovecii [formerly P. carinii).
# Autoimmune disorders have been reported and symptoms can occur many months after initiation of the antiretroviral therapy.
# Use with caution for patients with impaired renal function and do not prescribe this treatment to patients with impaired liver function.

==Mechanism of action==
Lamivudine is an analogue of cytidine. It can inhibit both types (1 and 2) of HIV reverse transcriptase and also the reverse transcriptase of hepatitis B virus. It is phosphorylated to active metabolites that compete for incorporation into viral DNA. They inhibit the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme competitively and act as a chain terminator of DNA synthesis. The lack of a 3&#x27;-OH group in the incorporated nucleoside analogue prevents the formation of the 5&#x27; to 3&#x27; phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation, and therefore, the viral DNA growth is terminated.

Lamivudine is administered by mouth, and it is rapidly absorbed with a bio-availability of over 80%. Some research suggests that lamivudine can cross the blood–brain barrier. Lamivudine is often given in combination with zidovudine, with which it is highly synergistic. Lamivudine treatment has been shown to restore zidovudine sensitivity of previously resistant HIV. Lamivudine showed no evidence of carcinogenicity or mutagenicity in &quot;in vivo&quot; studies in mice and rats at doses from 10 to 58 times those used in humans.

It has a half-life of 5–7 hours in adults and 2 hours in children.

==History==
Racemic BCH-189 (the minus form is known as lamivudine) was invented by Bernard Belleau while at work at McGill University and Paul Nguyen-Ba at the Montreal-based IAF BioChem International, Inc. laboratories in 1988 and the minus enantiomer isolated in 1989. Samples were first sent to Yung-Chi Cheng of Yale University for study of its toxicity. When used in combination with AZT, he discovered that lamivudine&#x27;s negative form reduced side effects and increased the drug&#x27;s efficiency at inhibiting reverse transcriptase. The combination of lamivudine and AZT increased the efficiency at inhibiting an enzyme HIV uses to reproduce its genetic material. As a result, lamivudine was identified as a less toxic agent to mitochondria DNA than other retroviral drugs.

Lamivudine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 1995, for use with zidovudine (AZT) and again in 2002. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

<doc id="770043" wikidata="Q3285317" url="?curid=770043" title="Manchac, Louisiana">
<text>Manchac (also known as Akers) is an unincorporated community in Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana, United States.

==Etymology==
Dr. John R. Swanton, a linguist who worked with Native American languages, suggested that the name Manchac is derived from &quot;Imashaka&quot;, which is a Choctaw word meaning &quot;the rear entrance.&quot; An early Choctaw language dictionary written by Cyrus Byington defines the word &quot;im&quot; as a preposition meaning &quot;place&quot; and &quot;ashaka&quot; meaning &quot;the back side or rear&quot; 

==Willie Akers==
Willie Akers carried the same name as his father who founded the city of Ponchatoula. In the year 1871 Willie moved to Manchac with his family and built a house near a section of high ground that the locals called &quot;Jones Island&quot;. Then in the year 1857 Willie was appointed as the first postmaster of Manchac and served as the local telegraph operator. The local community became known as &quot;Akers&quot; during this period.

== History ==
Fort Bute or Manchac Post, named after the then British Prime Minister John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, was established in 1763 at the junction of the Iberville River (Bayou Manchac) with the Mississippi River, and remained an important military and trading post in British West Florida until captured by Spanish forces under Luis de Unzaga who built a new fort, Manchak fort, in August of 1775; later, his brother-in-law Bernardo Galvez captured Manchac Fort from the English again on September 7, 1779, during what became known as the Battle of Fort Bute of the American Revolutionary War. Manchac was raided in February 1778 by American forces under the command of James Willing—see related articles, Continental Marines and USS &quot;Morris&quot;. Fort Bute/Manchac Post/Mississippi River at Bayou Manchac is 45 miles from Manchac.

The British used Manchac as a trading post with which the British agent in 1772 was reported to attempt to recruit a translator of Quapaw to undermine Spanish authority in Spanish Louisiana. Apparently it was a favorite object of deputy Indian agent John Thomas there.

When the New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern railroad was commissioned in 1852, Manchac was one of the stations originally planned, which were generally at ten-mile intervals. Willie Akers&#x27; father, William Akers, was the founder and first mayor of the town of Ponchatoula, the next station to the north. Manchac straddles the railway, which, at the start of the 21st century, is part of the Canadian National Railway system.

The area was part of the Expedition to Pass Manchac and Ponchatoula during the American Civil War.

== Location ==
Manchac is located on Lake Maurepas on the Pass Manchac waterway, which connects to Lake Pontchartrain. The Manchac Swamp Bridge on Interstate 55 has exit and entrance ramps for Manchac. Also located here is the Port Manchac Distribution Center, with storage facilities and rail, truck, and water links to the east, west, and north.

Manchac is home to the ruins of one of the five lighthouses set up for Lake Pontchartrain, the Pass Manchac Light. The last lighthouse to be built on the north side of the entrance to Pass Manchac (the fourth one on that site) was completed in 1857. It was automated in 1941, and the dwelling was razed in 1952; the U.S. Coast Guard decommissioned the light and abandoned the property in 1987.

Hurricane Isaac destroyed the Pass Manchac Light structure in August 2012. However, the lantern room had previously been removed from the tower, for restoration purposes. Since 2008, Pass Manchac Light&#x27;s lantern room has been located at the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Maritime Museum in Madisonville.

Manchac is known for fishing, duck hunting, seafood restaurants such as Middendorf&#x27;s, and swamp tours.

<text>Abacavir, sold under the brand name Ziagen among others, is a medication used to treat HIV/AIDS. Similar to other nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), abacavir is used together with other HIV medications, and is not recommended by itself. It is taken by mouth as a tablet or solution and may be used in children over the age of three months.
Abacavir is generally well tolerated. Common side effects include vomiting, insomnia (trouble sleeping), fever, and feeling tired. Other common side effects include loss of appetite, headache, nausea (feeling sick), diarrhea, rash, and lethargy (lack of energy). More severe side effects include hypersensitivity, liver damage, and lactic acidosis. Genetic testing can indicate whether a person is at higher risk of developing hypersensitivity. Symptoms of hypersensitivity include rash, vomiting, and shortness of breath. Abacavir is in the NRTI class of medications, which work by blocking reverse transcriptase, an enzyme needed for HIV virus replication. Within the NRTI class, abacavir is a carbocyclic nucleoside.
Abacavir was patented in 1988, and approved for use in the United States in 1998. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. Abacavir is used together with other HIV medications, such as abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine, abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine, and abacavir/lamivudine. The combination abacavir/lamivudine is an essential medicine.

==Medical uses==
Abacavir, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Abacavir should be used in combination with other antiretroviral agents.

== Contraindications ==
Abacavir is contraindicated for people who have the HLA‑B*5701 allele or who have moderate or severe liver disease (hepatic impairment).

==Side effects==
Common adverse reactions include nausea, headache, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, Anorexia (symptom) (loss of appetite), and insomnia (trouble sleeping). Rare but serious side effects include hypersensitivity reaction such as rash, elevated AST and ALT, depression, anxiety, fever/chills, URI, lactic acidosis, hypertriglyceridemia, and lipodystrophy.

===Hypersensitivity syndrome===
Hypersensitivity to abacavir is strongly associated with a specific allele at the human leukocyte antigen B locus namely HLA-B*5701. The mechanism for this hypersensitivity reaction is due to abacavir binding in the antigen-binding cleft of HLA-B*57:01, allowing alternative peptides to bind, which appear as &quot;non-self&quot; when presented to T cells. There is an association between the prevalence of HLA-B*5701 and ancestry. The prevalence of the allele is estimated to be 3.4 to 5.8 percent on average in populations of European ancestry, 17.6 percent in Indian Americans, 3.0 percent in Hispanic Americans, and 1.2 percent in Chinese Americans. There is significant variability in the prevalence of HLA-B*5701 among African populations. In African Americans, the prevalence is estimated to be 1.0 percent on average, 0 percent in the Yoruba from Nigeria, 3.3 percent in the Luhya from Kenya, and 13.6 percent in the Masai from Kenya, although the average values are derived from highly variable frequencies within sample groups.

Common symptoms of abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome include fever, malaise, nausea, and diarrhea. Some patients may also develop a skin rash. Symptoms of AHS typically manifest within six weeks of treatment using abacavir, although they may be confused with symptoms of HIV, immune reconstitution syndrome, hypersensitivity syndromes associated with other drugs, or infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released an alert concerning abacavir and abacavir-containing medications on 24 July 2008, and the FDA-approved drug label for abacavir recommends pre-therapy screening for the HLA-B*5701 allele and the use of alternative therapy in subjects with this allele. Additionally, both the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium and the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group recommend use of an alternative therapy in individuals with the HLA-B*5701 allele.

Skin-patch testing may also be used to determine whether an individual will experience a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, although some patients susceptible to developing AHS may not react to the patch test.

The development of suspected hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir requires immediate and permanent discontinuation of abacavir therapy in all patients, including patients who do not possess the HLA-B*5701 allele. On 1 March 2011, the FDA informed the public about an ongoing safety review of abacavir and a possible increased risk of heart attack associated with the drug. A meta-analysis of 26 studies conducted by the FDA, however, did not find any association between abacavir use and heart attack

===Immunopathogenesis===
The mechanism underlying abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome is related to the change in the HLA-B*5701 protein product. Abacavir binds with high specificity to the HLA-B*5701 protein, changing the shape and chemistry of the antigen-binding cleft. This results in a change in immunological tolerance and the subsequent activation of abacavir-specific cytotoxic T cells, which produce a systemic reaction known as abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome.

==Interaction==
Abacavir, and in general NRTIs, do not undergo hepatic metabolism and therefore have very limited (to none) interaction with the CYP enzymes and drugs that effect these enzymes. That being said there are still few interactions that can affect the absorption or the availability of abacavir. Below are few of the common established drug and food interaction that can take place during abacavir co-administration:
* Protease inhibitors such as tipranavir or ritonovir may decrease the serum concentration of abacavir through induction of glucuronidation. Abacavir is metabolized by both alcohol dehydrogenase and glucuronidation.
* Ethanol may result in increased levels of abacavir through the inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase. Abacavir is metabolized by both alcohol dehydrogenase and glucuronidation.
* Methadone may diminish the therapeutic effect of Abacavir. Abacavir may decrease the serum concentration of Methadone.
* Orlistat may decrease the serum concentration of antiretroviral drugs. The mechanism of this interaction is not fully established but it is suspected that it is due to the decreased absorption of abacavir by orlistat.
* Cabozantinib: Drugs from the MRP2 inhibitor (Multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 inhibitors) family such as abacavir could increase the serum concentration of Cabozantinib.

==Mechanism of action==
Abacavir is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor that inhibits viral replication. It is a guanosine analogue that is phosphorylated to carbovir triphosphate (CBV-TP). CBV-TP competes with the viral molecules and is incorporated into the viral DNA. Once CBV-TP is integrated into the viral DNA, transcription and HIV reverse transcriptase is inhibited.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Abacavir is given orally and is rapidly absorbed with a high bioavailability of 83%. Solution and tablet have comparable concentrations and bioavailability. Abacavir can be taken with or without food.

Abacavir can cross the blood–brain barrier. Abacavir is metabolized primarily through the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and glucuronyl transferase to an inactive carboxylate and glucuronide metabolites. It has a half-life of approximately 1.5-2.0 hours. If a person has liver failure, abacavir&#x27;s half life is increased by 58%.

Abacavir is eliminated via excretion in the urine (83%) and feces (16%). It is unclear whether abacavir can be removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

==History==
Robert Vince and Susan Daluge along with Mei Hua, a visiting scientist from China, developed the medication in the &#x27;80s.

Abacavir was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 1998, and is the fifteenth approved antiretroviral drug in the United States.

<text>Country is a 1984 American drama film which follows the trials and tribulations of a rural family as they struggle to hold on to their farm during the trying economic times experienced by family farms in 1980s America. The film was written by William D. Wittliff, and stars real-life couple Jessica Lange and Sam Shepard. The film was directed by Richard Pearce, and was shot on location in Dunkerton and Readlyn Iowa, and at Burbank&#x27;s Walt Disney Studios.

Lange, who also co-produced the film, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe award for her role.

Then-U.S. president Ronald Reagan stated in his personal diary that this film &quot;was a blatant propaganda message against our agri programs&quot;. Some members of the U.S. Congress took the film so seriously that Jessica Lange was brought before a congressional panel to testify as an expert about living on family farms.

&quot;Country&quot; was one of three 1984 films, along with &quot;The River&quot; and &quot;Places in the Heart&quot;, that dealt with the perspective of family farm life &quot;struggles.&quot;

==Plot==
Gilbert &quot;Gil&quot; Ivy (Sam Shepard) and his wife Jewell (Jessica Lange) have worked Jewell&#x27;s family farm for years, and her father Otis (Wilford Brimley) does not want to see his family farm lost to foreclosure. However, low crop prices, interest on FHA loans, pressure by the FHA to reduce both the loan and operating expenditure, and a tornado all put pressure on the struggling family as they face hardship and the prospect of losing their home and livelihood.

==Cast==
*Jessica Lange as Jewell Ivy 
*Sam Shepard as Gilbert &quot;Gil&quot; Ivy
*Wilford Brimley as Otis
*Matt Clark as Tom McMullen
*Therese Graham as Marlene Ivy
*Levi L. Knebel as Carlisle Ivy
*Jim Haynie as Arlon Brewer
*Sandra Seacat as Louise Brewer
*Alex Harvey as Fordyce
*Stephanie Stacie-Poyner as Missy Ivy

==Production==
Jessica Lange, who served as actress and producer, conceived the idea for &quot;Country&quot; citing a desire to make a contemporary version of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; based on her discussions with several mid-western farmers as well as several newspaper articles chronicling struggles farmers were dealing with in the 80s. The Ladd Company had initially been slated to finance &quot;Country&quot; but withdrew their commitment and after rejection from several other studios The Walt Disney Company acquired &quot;Country&quot; for their relatively new Touchstone Pictures label. Hal Ashby had been slated to direct but left the project shortly after Disney&#x27;s acquisition. Writer William D. Wittliff was briefly hired as director until creative disagreements came between him and Lange regarding the look of the film, which Lange wanted quite gritty. Wittliff left amicably and was replaced by Richard Pearce. Much of Wittliff&#x27;s screenplay had uncredited rewrites from Sam Shepard whom de-emphasized the sentimentality in favor of grittier realism.

<text>Looptroop Rockers is a hip hop group from Västerås, Sweden. The members are the rappers Promoe (Mårten Edh), Supreme (Mathias Lundh-Isen), DJ/Producer Embee (Magnus Bergkvist) and CosM.I.C (Tommy Isacsson). On their fourth album, &quot;Good Things&quot;, the group changed its name from Looptroop to Looptroop Rockers, a name used unofficially for some years prior to the change.

==Biography==
Looptroop was formed in 1991 by Promoe and Embee. The two had met while attending school in Västerås and were still in their teens at the time of the group&#x27;s inception. Cos.M.I.C joined shortly thereafter and in 1993 the group independently released their cassette-only debut EP &quot;Superstars&quot;, which was followed in 1995 by &quot;Threesicksteez&quot;. By the time they released their third cassette, &quot;From The Wax Cabinet&quot; (1996), long-time associate and frequent collaborator Supreme had become a permanent member of the group. It was in the pre-DVSG time when Promoe and Cos.M.I.C were also part of a group of graffiti writers called the &quot;BIF&quot; (Babylon Is Falling) crew in Västerås.

In 1998, Looptroop started their own record label, David Vs. Goliath (commonly referred to as DVSG), and with distribution handled by the Swedish punk rock label Burning Heart Records they released their full-length debut album &quot;Modern Day City Symphony&quot; in 2000. The album managed to sell reasonably well despite limited media exposure and spawned the underground hit single &quot;Long Arm of the Law,&quot; which took a critical stance towards the Swedish police force and has since become one of Looptroop&#x27;s signature songs.

In 2001, Promoe became the first member of the group to launch a solo career, with his debut solo album, &quot;Government Music&quot;. In 2002 Looptroop released their second album &quot;The Struggle Continues&quot;.

Embee&#x27;s solo album &quot;Tellings From Solitaria&quot; was released in 2004 and featured contributions from several notable Swedish artists, including José González, Timbuktu, and Daniel Lemma. The album was critically acclaimed and won a Swedish Grammy Award for best hiphop/soul in 2004.

Their third full-length studio album, &quot;Fort Europa&quot;, was released in 2005. On the track &quot;Fort Europa,&quot; the group takes a particularly critical tone towards their country&#x27;s immigration policy. In the video, an image of a TV screen reading &quot;Welcome SWE&quot; is smashed by a golf club as the beat drops. In the first verse, Promoe compares immigration policy to the Berlin Wall.

On February 9, 2007, Cos.M.I.C announced that he was leaving the group indefinitely. He stated that there had been no falling-out between him and the rest of the group and mentioned that the group&#x27;s busy schedule, which prevented him from spending time with his family, prompted this decision. Cos.M.I.C then contributed to two songs on the group&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Good Things&quot;. After Cos.M.I.C left the group, they have also officially changed the group name from Looptroop to Looptroop Rockers!

Looptroop Rockers released their fourth album &quot;Good Things&quot; on 23 April 2008. Cos.M.I.C is featured on one of the tracks on the album. 2008 was also the year that DVSG was celebrating its 10th anniversary. Looptroop Rockers worked with artists like Rakaa Iriscience of the Dilated Peoples, CunninLynguists, Timbuktu, and Adam Tensta for this album.

On 21 May, 2010, Looptroop Rockers announced on their website that they were working on a new album. Promoe said it to be slated for a February 2011 release at a gig in Helsinki on May 19. On the same occasion it was announced that Cos.M.I.C. rejoined the group as a full member working on the new album.

In March 2011, the group released their fifth album &quot;Professional Dreamers&quot;.

In 2013, Looptroop Rockers released , their first Swedish album. It was made available on both CD and Vinyl LP.

In late October 2014, Looptroop Rockers released their album &quot;Naked Swedes&quot; on CD, LP and digital formats. It features guest appearances by Cunninglynguists, Seinabo Sey, and Sabina Ddumba. Lord Finesse produced an exclusive remix for the first single from the album, &quot;Another Love Song&quot;.

In 2017, Looptroop Rockers was inducted into the Swedish Music Hall of Fame.

To celebrate 25 years as a band, Looptroop Rockers released 25 new songs in 25 weeks during 2017.

<doc id="770080" wikidata="Q2997670" url="?curid=770080" title="Corporal of horse">
<text>Corporal of horse (CoH) is a rank in the British Army&#x27;s Household Cavalry corresponding to sergeant in other regiments. Formerly, no cavalry regiments had sergeants, but the Household Cavalry are the only ones to keep this tradition alive. It is said to stem from the origin of the word &quot;sergeant&quot;, which comes from the same root as &quot;servant&quot;. Since even the lowliest trooper in the Household Cavalry was once a gentleman, it was considered that such a rank was inappropriate. The rank of corporal of horse has existed since at least the 1660s, however it was only established as a rank equivalent of sergeant in the Household Cavalry from 1878 onwards. The rank below is lance-corporal of horse and that above is staff corporal.

A corporal of horse wears three rank chevrons surmounted by a metal crown. They are addressed using their full rank title.

<text>The Clatsop Plains are an area of wetlands and sand dunes between the Northern Oregon Coast Range and Pacific Ocean in northwestern Oregon in the United States. They stretch from near the mouth of the Columbia River south to the vicinity of Tillamook Head near Seaside. The plains are drained by several coastal rivers include the Skipanon River and the Necanicum River, which flow parallel to the coast and empty into the Columbia at Youngs Bay near Astoria and into the Pacific Ocean near Seaside respectively. At the time, the Lewis and Clark Expedition recorded a different river draining the plains which entered the Pacific near the current day Camp Rilea Armed Forces Training Center. Research, 200 years later in 2005, seems to have confirmed this by locating an old river channel.

The plains are named for the Clatsop tribe of Native Americans who lived in the area at the time of the arrival of Europeans and European Americans by ship at the end of the 18th century and by land at the beginning of the 19th century.

These plains were developed from sand filling in the shoreline during the late Quaternary age. The northern portion is a result of the creation of the south jetty on the Columbia River built in 1885. Within the plain are several lakes including Cullaby, Sunset (Neacoxie), Smith, and Coffenbury. The latter three are filled by groundwater and not local streams or rivers.

The first white settlement of Clatsop Plains was by two Methodist missionaries, the first missionaries to arrive in Clatsop County. Solomon H. Smith who with Rev. Joseph H. Frost established a Methodist mission there in 1841 and built homes for their families on Clatsop Plains.

The first Presbyterian church was founded in 1846. Robert Morrison donated 10 acres for the church grounds, and then two more for a cemetery. The first church was built in 1850, but was destroyed by a windstorm in 1853. It was the first Protestant church built west of the Rocky Mountains. A new church was built and served until 1927, when the current building replaced it. The church is located east of Camp Rilea. The Pioneer cemetery established in 1846, making it the oldest in the county, is the burial place for many early settlers.

A community called &quot;Clatsop Plains&quot; was established and incorporated in 1870, primarily for the purpose of restricting cattle grazing along the sea ridge. This grazing was destroying the ridge grass and plants that prevented sand from blowing onto the nearby farms. As incorporated originally, &quot;Clatsop Plains&quot; extended from the Skipanon River to Seaside. An actual town eventually came into being about a mile north of Seaside, and was later absorbed into Gearhart. However, its early proximity to Seaside is probably why Seaside itself was sometimes referred to Clatsop Plains.

The coastal grassy areas of Clatsop Plains was home to the endangered Oregon silverspot butterfly. Re-establishment efforts are continuing. (&quot;Speyeria zerene hippolyta&quot;).

A stretch of , the Oregon Coast Highway, runs through most of the length of Clatsop Plains.

<doc id="770083" wikidata="Q2543479" url="?curid=770083" title="Sweet Dreams (1985 film)">
<text>Sweet Dreams is a 1985 American biographical drama film which tells the story of country music singer Patsy Cline.

The film was directed by Karel Reisz, written by Robert Getchell, and stars Jessica Lange, Ed Harris, Ann Wedgeworth, David Clennon, James Staley, Gary Basaraba, John Goodman, and P. J. Soles.

The film was nominated for Academy Award for Best Actress (Jessica Lange). For all the musical sequences, Lange lip-synced to the original Patsy Cline recordings. The soundtrack was released in September 1985.

==Plot==
Patsy Cline (Jessica Lange), unhappily married and planning to divorce, is playing small-time gigs in the tri-state area of Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland when she meets Charlie Dick (Ed Harris), whose charm and aggressive self-confidence catch her attention. After her divorce, Patsy and Charlie marry, and she is free to pursue music and, later, focus on raising their children. After Charlie is drafted into the U.S. Army, Patsy focuses on singing more, and after joining forces with manager Randy Hughes, she becomes a rising star on the country music scene.

However, Patsy&#x27;s success fuels her self-confidence, much to Charlie&#x27;s annoyance, and he becomes increasingly physically and emotionally abusive as Patsy attempts to assert her independence. Patsy is at the peak of her popularity as one of the first great female stars of country music when she is killed in a plane crash on March 5, 1963, at the age of 30.

== Production ==

Many actresses wanted the role of Patsy Cline, including Meryl Streep, but she was turned down, one of three times the actress was denied a role. Jessica Lange was eventually signed on for the role, and has said that making the film was a very enjoyable experience for her. Lange did not do any of her own singing in the film; instead the actress lip-synced to Cline&#x27;s original recordings. This practice was notably used 33 years earlier, when Susan Hayward lip-synced to Jane Froman&#x27;s vocals in 20th Century Fox&#x27;s production of &quot;With a Song in My Heart&quot;. The film was originally to be titled &quot;I Fall to Pieces&quot;, after Cline&#x27;s signature song, before the producers eventually changed it to &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;.

== Historical inaccuracies ==

Many events depicted in the film are not accurate to the actual historical events. Leading up to the famous car crash, Patsy was not in fact buying beer, but actually going to pick up material for her mother to make new costumes for her shows. The most blatantly inaccurate sequence is the fatal plane crash that took Cline&#x27;s life. In the film, the plane is seen striking the side of a mountain and exploding on impact. In reality, the small aircraft crashed into a forest, hitting trees which ripped the plane apart on the way down. It is also important to note that there is no evidence of mechanical issues leading up to the crash; it is more likely that it was simply the heavy fog from area thunderstorms that caused pilot Randy Hughes to experience spatial disorientation, causing him to lose control of the plane, as Hughes was not instrument-rated.

Patsy&#x27;s mother Hilda Hensley was not a fan of the film, speaking publicly against it in several interviews.

==Reception==
Noted film critic Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars, writing:There isn&#x27;t the sense of a well-shaped structure in this movie; there&#x27;s no clear idea of what the filmmakers thought about Patsy Cline, or what thoughts her life is supposed to inspire.

Metacritic gave the film a 65 rating.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2004: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:

<text>Digital painting is the creation of imagery on a computer, using pixels (picture elements) which are assigned a color. The process uses raster graphics rather than vector graphics, and can render graduated or blended colors in imagery which mimics traditional drawing and painting media.

== Origins ==

===Sketchpad===

The earliest graphical manipulation program was called Sketchpad. Created in 1963 by Ivan Sutherland, a grad student at MIT, Sketchpad allowed the user to manipulate objects on a cathode-ray tube (CRT). Sketchpad eventually led to the creation of the Rand Tablet for work on the GRAIL project in 1968, and the very first tablet was created. Other early tablets, or digitizers, like the ID (intelligent digitizer) and the BitPad were commercially successful and used in CAD (Computer Aided Design) programs. Modern-day graphics tablets are the tools of choice by digital painters.

===Tablets===
The idea of using a tablet to communicate directions to a computer has been an idea since 1968 when the RAND (Research and Development) company out of Santa Monica, developed the RAND tablet that was used to program. Digitizers were popularized in the mid-1970s and early 1980s by the commercial success of the ID (Intelligent Digitizer) and BitPad manufactured by the Summagraphics Corp. These digitizers were used as the input device for many high-end CAD (computer aided design) systems as well as bundled with PCs and PC-based CAD software like AutoCAD.

===MacPaint===
An early commercial program that allowed users to design, draw, and manipulate objects was the program MacPaint. This program&#x27;s first version was introduced on January 22, 1984, on the Apple Lisa. The ability to freehand draw and create graphics with this program made it the top program of its kind during 1984. The earlier versions of the program were called MacSketch and LisaSketch, and the last version of MacPaint was MacPaint 2.0 released in 1998.

Much of MacPaint&#x27;s universal success was attributed to the release of the first Macintosh computer equipped with another program called MacWrite. It was the first personal computer with a graphical user interface and lost much of the bulky size of its predecessor, the Lisa. The Macintosh was available at about $2500 and the combination of a smaller design made the computer a hit, exposing the average computer user to the graphical possibilities of the included MacPaint.

===Adobe===
Another early image manipulation program was Adobe Photoshop. It was first called Display and was created in 1987 by Thomas Knoll at the University of Michigan as a monochrome picture display program. With help from his brother John, the program was turned into an image editing program called Imagepro but later changed to Photoshop. The Knolls agreed on a deal with Adobe Systems and Apple, and Photoshop 1.0 was released in 1991 for Macintosh. Adobe Systems had previously released Adobe Illustrator 1.0 in 1986 on the Apple Macintosh. These two programs, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator are currently two of the top programs used to produce digital paintings. Illustrator introduced the uses of Bezier curves, which allowed the user to be incredibly detailed in their vector drawings.

===Kid Pix===
In 1988, Craig Hickman created a paint program called Kid Pix, which made it easier for children to create digital art. The program was created in black in white and after several revisions, was released in color in 1991. Kid Pix was one of the first commercial programs to integrate color and sound in a creative format. While the Kid Pix was intentionally created for children, it became a useful tool for introducing adults to the computer as well.

===Corel Painter===

Corel Painter was created in 1991 by Mark Zimmer and Tom Hedges of Fractal Design.

===Web-based painting programs===
In recent years there has been a growth in the websites supporting online painting. The user is still drawing digitally with the use of software: often the software is on the server of the website which is being used. However, with the emergence of HTML5, some programs now partly use the client&#x27;s web browser to handle some processing. The range of tools and brushes can be more limited than free-standing software. Speed of response, quality of color, and the ability to save to a file or print are similar in either media.

<text>Fusarium wilt is a common vascular wilt fungal disease, exhibiting symptoms similar to Verticillium wilt. This disease has been investigated extensively since the early years of this century. The pathogen that causes Fusarium wilt is &quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot; (&quot;F. oxysporum&quot;). The species is further divided into &quot;formae speciales&quot; based on host plant.

== Hosts and symptoms == 
The fungal pathogen &quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot; affects a wide variety of hosts of any age. Tomato, tobacco, legumes, cucurbits, sweet potatoes and banana are a few of the most susceptible plants, but it also infects other herbaceous plants. &quot;F. oxysporum&quot; generally produces symptoms such as wilting, chlorosis, necrosis, premature leaf drop, browning of the vascular system, stunting and damping-off. The most important of these is vascular wilt. Fusarium wilt starts out looking like vein clearing on the younger leaves and drooping of the older lower leaves, followed by stunting, yellowing of the lower leaves, defoliation, marginal necrosis and plant death. On older plants, symptoms are more distinct between the blossoming and fruit maturation stages.

&quot;F. oxysporum&quot; is split into divisions called &quot;formae speciales&quot; (singular &quot;forma specialis&quot;, abbreviated &quot;f.sp.&quot;). Over 100 formae speciales divisions are identified, each with one or two different races. Each &quot;forma specialis&quot; within the species are host-specific (i.e. specific to a certain plant) and produce different symptoms:

&quot;F. oxysporum&quot; f. sp. &quot;batatas&quot; affects sweet potato. The symptoms include leaf chlorosis, stunting, and leaf drop. It is transmitted through the soil and through vascular wounds in plant material.

&quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot; f. sp. &quot;canariensis&quot; causes wilt of Canary Island date palm and other propagated palms. The disease is spread through contaminated seed, soil and pruning tools.

&quot;F. oxysporum&quot; f. sp. &quot;cubense&quot; causes Panama disease on banana. It is found everywhere bananas are grown in Africa, Asia, Central and South America. It attacks banana plants of all ages and spreads mainly through the soil. It causes wilting and yellowing of the leaves.

&quot;F. oxysporum&quot; f. sp. &quot;lycopersici&quot; causes vascular wilt in tomato. The disease starts out as yellowing and drooping on one side of the plant. Leaf wilting, plant stunting, browning of the vascular system, leaf death and lack of fruit production also occur.

&quot;F. oxysporum&quot; f. sp. &quot;melonis&quot; attacks muskmelon and cantaloupe. It causes damping-off in seedlings and causes chlorosis, stunting and wilting in old plants. Necrotic streaks can appear on the stems.

==Disease cycle==
&quot;F. oxysporum&quot; is the most widely dispersed of the&quot; Fusarium&quot; species and is found worldwide. &quot;F. oxysporum&quot; has no known sexual stage, but produces three types of asexual spores: microconidia, macroconidia, and chlamydospores. The microconidia are the most abundantly produced spores. They are oval, elliptical or kidney shaped and produced on aerial mycelia. Macroconidia, which have three to five cells and have gradually pointed or curved edges, are found on sporodochia on the surface of diseased plant (in culture the sporodochia may be sparse or nonexistent). Chlamydospores are usually formed singly or in pairs, but can sometimes be found in clusters or in short chains. They are round thick walled spores produced within or terminally on an older mycelium or in macroconidia. Chlamydospores unlike the other spores can survive in the soil for a long period of time.

&quot;F. oxysporum&quot; is a common soil pathogen and saprophyte that feeds on dead and decaying organic matter. It survives in the soil debris as a mycelium and all spore types, but is most commonly recovered from the soil as chlamydospores. This pathogen spreads in two basic ways: it spreads short distances by water splash, and by planting equipment, and long distances by infected transplants and seeds. &quot;F. oxysporum&quot; infects a healthy plant by means of mycelia or by germinating spores penetrating the plant&#x27;s root tips, root wounds, or lateral roots. The mycelium advances intracellularly through the root cortex and into the xylem. Once in the xylem, the mycelium remains exclusively in the xylem vessels and produces microconidia (asexual spores). The microconidia are able to enter into the sap stream and are transported upward. Where the flow of the sap stops the microconidia germinate. Eventually the spores and the mycelia clog the vascular vessels, which prevents the plant from up-taking and translocating nutrients. In the end the plant transpires more than it can transport, the stomata close, the leaves wilt, and the plant dies. After the plant dies the fungus invades all tissues, sporulates, and continues to infect neighboring plants.

==Environment==
As previously stated &quot;F. oxysporum&quot; is a common soil saprophyte that infects a wide host range of plant species around the world. It has the ability to survive in most soil—arctic, tropical, desert, cultivated and non-cultivated. Though &quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot; may be found in many places and environments, development of the disease is favored by high temperatures and warm moist soils. The optimum temperature for growth on artificial media is between 25-30 °C, and the optimum soil temperature for root infection is 30 °C or above. However, infection through the seed can occur at temperatures as low as 14 °C.

==Management==
&quot;F. oxysporum&quot; is a major wilt pathogen of many economically important crop plants. It is a soil-borne pathogen, which can live in the soil for long periods of time, so rotational cropping is not a useful control method. It can also spread through infected dead plant material, so cleaning up at the end of the season is important.

One control method is to improve soil conditions because &quot;F. oxysporum&quot; spreads faster through soils that have high moisture and bad drainage. Other control methods include planting resistant varieties, removing infected plant tissue to prevent overwintering of the disease, using soil and systemic fungicides to eradicate the disease from the soil, flood fallowing, and using clean seeds each year. Applying fungicides depends on the field environment. It is difficult to find a biological control method because research in a greenhouse can have different effects than testing in the field. The best control method found for &quot;F. oxysporum&quot; is planting resistant varieties, although not all have been bred for every forma specialis.

&quot;F. oxysporum&quot; f. sp. &quot;batatas&quot; can be controlled by using clean seed, cleaning up infected leaf and plant material and breeding for resistance. Fungicides can also be used, but are not as effective as the other two because of field conditions during application. Fungicides can be used effectively by dip treating propagation material.

Different races of &quot;F. oxysporum&quot; f. sp. &quot;cubense&quot;, Panama disease on banana, can be susceptible, resistant and partially resistant. It can be controlled by breeding for resistance and through eradication and quarantine of the pathogen by improving soil conditions and using clean plant material. Biological control can work using antagonists. Systemic and soil fungicides can also be used.

The main control method for &quot;F. oxysporum&quot; f. sp. &quot;lycopersici&quot;, vascular wilt on tomato, is resistance. Other effective control methods are fumigating the infected soil and raising the soil pH to 6.5-7.

The most effective way to control &quot;F. oxysporum&quot; f. sp. &quot;melonis&quot; is to graft a susceptible variety of melon to a resistant root-stock. Resistant cultivars, liming the soil to change soil pH to 6-7, and reducing soil nitrogen levels also help control &quot;F. oxysporum&quot; f. sp. &quot;melonis&quot;.

The fungus &quot;Trichoderma viride&quot; is a biocontrol agent that has proven to control this disease in an environmentally friendly manner. It can also manage Fusarium wilt in cucumber, tomato, and various other crops.

F.oxysporum f. sp. &quot;radicis-cucumerinum&quot; is responsible for the root and stem rot of cucumbers (&quot;Cucumis sativus&quot;). Management of F.oxysporum f. sp. &quot;radicis-cucumerinum&quot; has been effective by methyl bromide fumigation.

==Importance==
Because &quot;F. oxysporum&quot; is so widespread, it is a significant problem in many crops. It is economically damaging to the banana industry, and the threat of more virulent strains or mutations to damage previously resistant crops is of major concern. &quot;F. oxysporum&quot; also causes damage to many crops from the family Solanaceae, including potato, tomato, and pepper. Yield losses of affected crops can be high, up to 45% yield loss of tomato crop has been reported in India. Other commercially important plants affected include basil, beans, carnation, chrysanthemum, peas, and watermelon. Woody ornamentals are infected, but are usually not killed by Fusarium wilt alone. Palms, however, are the exception, and there are many species that can die from &quot;F. oxysporum&quot; infection. Fusarium wilt&#x27;s importance as a damaging disease on strawberry production is increasing. In South Korea, where Fusarium wilt is the most serious soil-borne disease of strawberry, losses in transplant production of up to 30% have been reported.

There is growing interest in using Fusarium wilt as a form of biological control. Certain pathogenic strains of &quot;F. oxysporum&quot; could be released to infect and control invasive weed species. This type of control (called a mycoherbicide) would be more targeted than herbicide applications, without the associated problems of chemical use. In addition. &quot;F. oxysporum&quot; may compete with other soil fungi that act as pathogens of important crops. Introducing specific strains of &quot;F. oxysporum&quot; that are not pathogenic (or non-infectious mutants of pathogens) to nearby crops could take nutrients from other potential disease-causing fungi.

Fusarium wilt (Panama disease) is the most serious disease of banana, threatening 80% of the world&#x27;s banana production, most of which is planted with the susceptible Cavendish varieties. Bananas are a staple food in the diet of millions throughout the subtropics and tropics, and the spread of Panama disease could have devastating effects on both large scale production and subsistence farms.

==Origin==
Members of &quot;F. oxysporum&quot; are present throughout the world&#x27;s soils. However, before global transportation, many of the different varieties of the pathogen were isolated. Now, global trade has spread &quot;F. oxysporum&quot; inoculum with the crop. A recent example of this is the spread of &quot;Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense&quot; which may have originated in Asia and just recently has appeared in banana producing areas in the South Pacific.

Inoculum can originate from many sources. &quot;F. oxysporum&quot; conidia and chlamydospores can attach to the outside of seeds. Commercial seed companies must practice proper sanitation techniques, or the seed can carry its own inoculum to the grower&#x27;s field. This has been demonstrated with the seeds of various legumes, tomatoes, sugarbeet, aster, oil palm, and more.
Vegetative cuttings can also carry inoculum or the live pathogen. Importantly, plants used for cuttings carrying no outward symptoms of infection may still transmit the pathogen. This has become a problem in some greenhouse floral crops like Chrysanthemum and Carnation. The pathogen&#x27;s sporodochia and other inoculum sources may also be spread by soil movement and shipment of nonhost plants carried with infected soil.

Certain rare soils are said to be &quot;Fusarium-suppressive,&quot; that is, given two soils with high populations of infective &quot;F. oxysporum&quot; in the soil and the proper hosts, one soil will have a lower incidence of Fusarium wilt. Study of these soils is ongoing, but the decreased disease rate is thought to be due to other soil flora.

<text>Daffadar (Hindustani: दफ़ादार ; ) is the equivalent rank to sergeant in the Indian and Pakistani cavalry, as it was formerly in the British Indian Army. The rank below is lance daffadar. The equivalent in infantry and other units is havildar. Like a British sergeant, a daffadar wears three rank chevrons.

The etymology of the word is unclear. The -dar suffix, found in havildar and other words, means &quot;holder&quot;. Thus the word means &quot;holder of dafa&#x27; &quot;. The intended meaning of dafa&#x27; is, however, unclear. In Arabic it means &quot;pay&quot; or &quot;push&quot;, while in Persian, the more obvious source of the word, it means repulsion. It is unclear what role, if any, the word daffadar indicated in the Mughal Empire before it was used as a British Raj rank.

<doc id="770095" wikidata="Q564681" url="?curid=770095" title="Anna (1987 film)">
<text>Anna is a 1987 American comedy drama film directed by Yurek Bogayevicz and starring Sally Kirkland, Robert Fields, Paulina Porizkova, Steven Gilborn and Larry Pine. It was adapted by Agnieszka Holland from an unauthorized story by Holland and Bogayevicz, based on the real-life relationship of Polish actresses Elżbieta Czyżewska and Joanna Pacuła.

&quot;Anna&quot; received widespread critical acclaim upon release, with high praise directed towards Kirkland&#x27;s performance. She earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, in addition to winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama and the Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead.

==Plot==
Krystyna, an aspiring actress, journeys from her native Czechoslovakia to New York City in search of her idol Anna, an actress who was once famous in her homeland. Anna was imprisoned in Czechoslovakia after speaking out against the new regime after the 1968 Communist invasion, and was later banned from reentry to the country. Tonda, Anna&#x27;s then-husband and a director of equally renown, was in Paris at the time of the invasion and has since become successful in the United States making music videos for MTV. Anna, who is now middle-aged and struggles to land parts in films and theatre, becomes a mentor for Krystyna and her fledgling acting career.

As Anna manages to land a gig as an understudy for an off-Broadway play, she also tutors Krystyna fluency in the English language and gives her a makeover. Krystyna blossoms as Anna&#x27;s protégée, but when she uses Anna&#x27;s life experiences as fodder for a TV show, the women&#x27;s friendship starts to show strain.

==Cast==
==Critical reception==
Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Anna&quot; &quot;is the best kind of surprise--a small, frequently funny, fine-boned film set in the worlds of the theater and movies which unexpectedly becomes a consummate study of love, alienation and loss.&quot; She described Kirkland&#x27;s performance as &quot;a blazing comet&quot; and complimented Porizkova, Fields, and Maleczech. Though Benson critiqued director Bogayevicz&#x27;s &quot;melodramatist’s flair for sudden rainstorms to underscore emotional scenes&quot;, she said these touches were redeemed by the cast and Holland&#x27;s ear for dialogue. Critic Emanuel Levy wrote, &quot;Perhaps only a foreign screenwriter and a foreign director could have made the witty and cynical &quot;Anna&quot;, a movie about an expatriate Czech actress in New York, struggling with her progressive age, ruthless competition, sheer survival and other problems inherent in showbiz.&quot;

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was less effusive and said the film was cliché-laden with too many unconvincing elements, though she praised Kirkland&#x27;s performance. The film was likened by multiple critics as another version of &quot;All About Eve&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, Hilary Mantel commended Bogayevicz and Holland, writing &quot;their careful thought and commitment is evident&quot; and &quot;they have allowed scope for a fine central performance — intense, observant and painful — by Sally Kirkland&quot;.

<doc id="770096" wikidata="Q3240031" url="?curid=770096" title="Panama disease">
<text>Panama disease (or Fusarium wilt) is a plant disease that infects banana plants (&quot;Musa&quot; spp.). It is a wilting disease caused by the fungus &quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot; f. sp. &quot;cubense&quot; (Foc). The pathogen is resistant to fungicides and its control is limited to phytosanitary measures.

During the 1950s, an outbreak of Panama disease almost wiped out commercial Gros Michel banana production. The Gros Michel banana was the dominant cultivar of bananas, and Fusarium wilt inflicted enormous costs and forced producers to switch to other, disease-resistant cultivars. Since the 2010s, a new outbreak of Panama disease caused by the strain Tropical Race 4 (TR4) has threatened the production of the Cavendish banana, today&#x27;s most popular cultivar.

== Overview ==
Although fruits of the wild bananas (&quot;Musa&quot; spp.) have large, hard seeds, most edible bananas are seedless. Banana plants are therefore propagated asexually from offshoots. Because these rhizomes are usually free of symptoms even when the plant is infected by &quot;F. oxysporum &quot;f. sp.&quot; cubense&quot;, they are a common means by which this pathogen is disseminated. It can also be spread in soil and running water, on farm implements or machinery.

Panama disease is one of the most destructive plant diseases of modern times. It is believed to have originated in Southeast Asia and was first reported in Australia in 1876. The disease didn&#x27;t attract widespread attention until the early 20th century when it began heavily affecting banana cultivations in Panama and Costa Rica. By 1950 it had spread to all the banana-producing regions of the world with the exception of some islands in the South Pacific, the Mediterranean, Melanesia and Somalia.
Panama disease affects a wide range of banana cultivars; however, it is best known for the damage it caused to a single cultivar in the early export plantations. Before 1960, a total reliance was put on the cultivar &#x27;Gros Michel&#x27;, and it supplied almost all the export trade. It proved susceptible to the disease and the use of infected rhizomes to establish new plantations caused widespread and severe losses. Some indication of the scale of the losses is demonstrated by the complete eradication of production on of plantation in the Ulua Valley of Honduras between 1940 and 1960. In Suriname, an entire operation of was out of business within eight years and in the Quepos area of Costa Rica, were destroyed in twelve years. Overall fungal diseases - including most prominently &quot;Foc&quot; - are disproportionately important to small island developing states.
By the middle of the 20th century, resistant cultivars in the &#x27;Cavendish&#x27; subgroup were being used as a substitute for &#x27;Gros Michel&#x27; in the export trade. For a time these cultivars did prove resilient and grew well, and in some areas remain the clones on which the current export trade is based. Unfortunately, in several growing areas in the Eastern Hemisphere, these cultivars are falling to TR4. The disease was also detected in Colombia in 2019. This poses a significant threat to production, because there are currently no acceptable replacement cultivars. It is anticipated by experts that disease surveillance, integrated pest management, breeding of resistant cultivars, and genetic engineering will yield worthwhile results. This conclusion comes from an economic analysis which examined these as investments which governments and international organizations may or may not choose to invest in. Their opinion was that there would be positive yield from these investments, taken as either net present value or the internal rate of return.

A variant cultivar called Formosana (GCTCV-218), a type of Taiwanese Cavendish, has been reported in the popular press as having some resistance to TR4, as well as by Molina et al 2009, although in 2015 Ploetz was of the opinion that it has been evaluated as having no resistance at all. &#x27;GCTCV-119&#x27; is another Taiwanese Cavendish used commercially for its TR4 resistance.

To make things worse, this variant of the pathogen also affects plantains (&quot;Musa acuminata&quot; × &quot;balbisiana&quot;) which are an important staple food in tropical regions of the world. The average American eats of the Cavendish banana each year, and the question is being asked as to whether this oft-consumed fruit is on course to extinction.

Apart from the export trade, 85% of banana production is for local consumption and many of the cultivars used for this purpose are also susceptible to infection.

== Distribution ==
Not all banana-producing countries have been affected by the outbreak of Panama disease. Tropical Race 4 (TR4) was first identified in Taiwan, and from there rapidly spread to Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Australia and the Philippines. The disease was then identified in Jordan in 2013. TR4 later spread to Vietnam and Laos, as well as to the Middle East being reported in Pakistan and Lebanon. In 2015, the disease then spread to Africa, being informally announced in Mozambique and Oman. In August 2019, TR4 arrived in Colombia, a country in Latin America, the region comprising the world&#x27;s biggest banana exporters.

== Symptoms ==
Infection by &quot;F. oxysporum &quot;f. sp.&quot; cubense&quot; triggers the self-defense mechanisms of the host plant causing the secretion of a gel. This is followed by the formation of tylose in the vascular vessels which blocks the movement of water and nutrients to the upper parts of the plant. The tips of the feeder roots are the initial sites of infection which then moves on to the rhizome. The signs of the disease are most noticeable as a dark stain where the stele joins the cortex. As the disease develops, large portions of the xylem turn a reddish-brown colour. Externally, the oldest leaves start turning yellow and there is often a longitudinal splitting of the lower part of the outer leaf sheaths on the pseudostem. The leaves begin to wilt and may buckle at the base of the petiole. As the disease progresses, younger leaves are affected, turn yellow and crumple and the whole canopy begins to consist of dead or dying leaves.
The leaf symptoms of Fusarium wilt can be confused with those of Xanthomonas wilt. In plants affected by Fusarium, yellowing and wilting of the leaves typically progresses from the older to the younger leaves. The wilted leaves may also snap at the petiole and hang down the pseudostem. In plants affected by Xanthomonas, the wilting can begin with any leaf and the infected leaves tend to snap along the leaf blade.

Two external symptoms help characterize Panama disease of banana:

* Yellow leaf syndrome, the yellowing of the border of the leaves which eventually leads to bending of the petiole.
* Green leaf syndrome, which occurs in certain cultivars, marked by the persistence of the green color of the leaves followed by the bending of the petiole as in yellow leaf syndrome. Internally, the disease is characterized by a vascular discoloration. This begins in the roots and rhizomes with a yellowing that proceeds to a reddish-brown color in the pseudostem, as the pathogen blocks the plant&#x27;s nutrient and water transport.
*With proceeding infection, the banana pseudostem can split, and eventually the whole plant collapses.

External symptoms often get confused with the symptoms of bacterial wilt of banana, but ways to differentiate between the two diseases include:

* Fusarium wilt proceeds from older to younger leaves, but bacterial wilt is the opposite.
* Fusarium wilt has no symptoms on the growing buds or suckers, no exudates visible within the plant, and no symptoms in the fruit. Bacterial wilt can be characterized by distorted or necrotic buds, bacterial ooze within the plant, and fruit rot and necrosis.

Once a banana plant is infected, recovery is rare, but if it does occur, any new emerging suckers will already be infected and can propagate disease if planted.

== Classification and host range ==

&quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot; f. sp. &quot;cubense&quot; (&quot;Foc&quot;) is a member of the &quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot; species complex, a group of ascomycete fungi with morphological similarities. Based on their different host species, the plant pathogenic fungi of this species complex are divided into approximately 150 special forms (formae specialis, f.sp.). &quot;Fusarium oxysprorum&quot; f.sp. &quot;cubense&quot; mainly infects banana (&quot;Musa&quot;) species. The special form &quot;cubense&quot; has been subdivided into four different races, which each attack a different group of banana genotypes.

* Race 1 was involved in the 1960s Panama disease outbreak which destroyed much of the Gros Michel banana plantations in Central America. In addition to Gros Michel, Race 1 also attacks other members of the banana AAB genomic group, including Abacá, Maqueño, the Silk subgroup, the Pome subgroup, Pisang Awak, Ducasse, and Lady Finger. Cavendish cultivars are resistant to Race 1.
* Race 2 infects cooking bananas with ABB genome and the Bluggoe subgroup.
* Race 3 infecting &quot;Heliconia&quot; spp. is no longer considered pathogenic to bananas, and has been renamed &quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot; f.sp. &quot;heliconiae&quot;.
* Race 4 is the causal agent of the current Panama disease outbreak since it is pathogenic to the currently used Cavendish cultivars (AAA genome). Race 4 is further subdivided into Tropical Race 4 (TR4) and Subtropical Race 4 (STR4). The latter only infects Cavendish and Race 1 and 2 susceptibles under abiotic stress.

== Tropical Race 1/TR1 ==

/ is also found in &quot;Paspalum fasciculatum&quot;, &quot;Panicum purpurescens&quot;, &quot;Ixophorus unisetus&quot;, and &quot;Commelina diffusa&quot; in Central America. These weeds may be acting as an inoculum source. , TR1 is found in Queensland.

== Tropical Race 2/TR2 ==

, / is found in Queensland.

== Tropical Race 3/TR3 ==

/ is a pest of &quot;Heliconia&quot; ornamental flowers. Formerly reported to be a lesser pest of &quot;Musa balbisiana&quot; seedlings and of Gros Michel, but that is no longer thought to be true. Now renamed &quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot; f. sp. &quot;heliconiae&quot;.

== Tropical Race 4/TR4 ==

 / belongs to vegetative compatibility group 01213/16. All cultivars which are susceptible to Race 1 and Race2 are susceptible to TR4 (see and ).

=== History of geographic spread ===
==== 1997 ====
* The first detection in Australia occurs near Darwin, Northern Territory.

==== 2005 ====
*&quot;Chloris inflata&quot;, &quot;Euphorbia heterophylla&quot;, &quot;Cyanthillium cinereum&quot;, and &quot;Tridax procumbens&quot;, in banana farms in Australia known to be infected with TR4. These weeds may be acting as sources of inoculum.

==== 2010 ====
* Starting here TR4 spread from its origin in southeast Asia westward into Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, India, Pakistan, Oman, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, and Mozambique.

==== 2015 ====
* March 26: Sample taken from a suspect tree on a farm in Mareeba, Queensland, Australia.
* March 28: TR4 was detected in those samples. The far north of Queensland producing 95% of the $580 million of bananas Australia turns out every year, this was immediately taken seriously by Biosecurity Queensland&#x27;s Panama TR4 Program and the Australian Banana Growers&#x27; Council.
:* However, the test used (the Dita PCR) was questioned after this detection was reported, and is no longer used by BQ. A dissection of the tree trunk showed none of the usual symptoms of &quot;Fusarium&quot; infiltration.
* May 18: Another 18 samples (of unspecified individual(s) from the same farm) tested negative.
:* BQ decided to only use vegetative compatibility groups and molecular diagnostics from then on.
* First legitimate detection later in the year in Tully, Queensland.

==== 2017 ====
* Queensland University of Technology researchers located a gene (RGA2) which is present but unexpressed in Cavendish, which they found expressed and effective against TR4 in the diploid &quot;M. a.&quot; ssp. &quot;malaccensis&quot;.

==== 2018 ====
* TR4 is found widely throughout Southeast Asia.

==== 2020 ====
* TR4 was still only found on five plantations in the same area due to this government and industry response. Queensland&#x27;s response to TR4 has been of interest to countries in Latin America as TR4 moves into that region for the first time.
* TR4 is found in Laos, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, Borneo, Indonesia, mainland China, Philippines, Jordan, Mozambique, Pakistan, Lebanon, Oman, India, and North Queensland in Australia.

==== 2021 ====
* In April the first detection in Peru occurred, in the Department of Piura, and on the 11th the National Service for Agricultural Health declared a phytosanitary emergency for the whole country. Ecuador had already been inspecting imports at the border due to Colombia&#x27;s detection, and then increased inspections further in April. The appearance of TR4 in Peru threatens its of plantations.

=== Subtropical Race 4/STR4 ===

/ is a subtropical race and does not become symptomatic on Cavendish until the trees are stressed by cold. quarantines for STR4 are imposed over South East Queensland, northern New South Wales, and Western Australia. STR4 is found in South East Queensland. Also found in &quot;Paspalum&quot; spp. and &quot;Amaranthus&quot; spp. in Australia. These weeds may be acting as sources of inoculum.

== Disease cycle ==
Modern commercially farmed banana plants are reproduced asexually, by replanting the plant&#x27;s basal shoot that grows after the original plant has been cut down. Being triploid, the fruit contains no seeds, and the male flower does not produce pollen suitable for pollination, prohibiting sexual reproduction. This causes all bananas of a single breed to be nearly genetically identical. The fungus easily spreads from plant to plant because the individual plants&#x27; defenses are nearly identical.

The disease is dispersed by spores or infected material that travel in surface water or farming activities. One of the biggest issues in spreading the disease is the means by which new banana plants are planted. Suckers are taken from one plant and clonally propagated to grow new trees. About 30 to 40% of suckers from a diseased plant are infected and not all show symptoms, so the chance of growing a new, already infected plant is fairly high. Finally, the disease is known to infect certain weeds without showing symptoms, meaning it can survive in the absence of banana plants and remain undetected in a place where bananas are planted later.

FOC is thought to persist only asexually, as no sexual phase (teleomorph) has been observed. Recombination events may occur via somatic hybridisation and the parasexual cycle.

This means that the survival and dispersal of the disease relies on purely asexual spores and structures. The disease survives in chlamydospores which are released as the plant dies and can survive in the soil for up to 30 years. When the environment is ideal and there are host roots available (fungus is attracted to root exudates), these chlamydospores will germinate and hyphae will penetrate the roots, initiating infection. There is an increase in the number of symptomatic plants when inflorescences emerge and the highest disease incidence occurs right before harvest. Once infected, microconidia are produced and proliferate within the vessels of the plant&#x27;s vascular system. Macroconidia are another asexual spore that tends to be found on the surface of plants killed by Panama disease. Infection is systemic, moving through the vascular system and causing yellowing and buckling that starts in older leaves and progresses to younger leaves until the entire plant dies.

=== Dispersal ===
Splash by rainfall, movement of contaminated soil, and movement of contaminated propagation materials are the major means of dispersal of &quot;Foc&quot;. Dispersal by wind alone remains unproven and while animals can test positive for &quot;Foc&quot; on their outer surfaces, it remains unproven whether they can be effective vectors.

== History ==
=== Gros Michel devastation era ===
The Gros Michel was the only type of banana eaten in the United States from the late 19th century until after World War II. The disease was serious and diagnosed in Panama banana plantations of Central America. Over several decades, the fungus spread from Panama to neighboring countries, moving north through Costa Rica to Guatemala and south into Colombia and Ecuador.

The banana industry was in a serious crisis, so a new banana thought to be immune to Panama disease was found and adopted, the Cavendish. In a few years, the devastated plantations resumed business as usual, and the transition went smoothly in the American market. Shortly thereafter, Malaysia entered the banana-growing business. Cavendish banana plantations were new to that country in the 1980s, but they rapidly expanded to meet the demand. Thousands of acres of rain forests and former palm oil plantations were shifted to banana production. Within a few years, though, the new plants began to die. While it took several years to find, the cause was ultimately attributed back to Panama disease. Although the Cavendish was then thought to be immune, it was immune only to the strain of the fungus that destroyed the Gros Michel. The version that annihilated the Gros Michel was found only in the Western Hemisphere, but the version found in Malaysian soil was different, and the Cavendish is susceptible to it. It killed and spread faster, inspiring more panic than its earlier counterpart in Panama. The newly discovered strain of &quot;F. oxysporum&quot; was named &quot;tropical race 4 (TR4)&quot;.

=== TR4 devastation era ===
Tropical Race 4 (TR4) was discovered in Taiwan in 1989. In July 2013, members of OIRSA, a Latin American regional organisation for plant and animal health, produced a contingency plan specific to TR4 for its nine member countries (Belize, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama). The plan is only available in Spanish.
In March 2015, Latin America growers met to create a regional defense effort and planned to meet again in September or October of that year. No specific regional measures are in place. Ecuadorian growers requested the government to fumigate all containers.

Scientists are trying to modify the banana plant to make it resist Panama disease and many other serious banana afflictions ranging from fungal, bacterial, and viral infections to nematodes and beetles. Researchers are combing remote jungles searching for new wild bananas. Hybrid bananas are being created in the hope of generating a new variety with strong resistance to diseases. Some believe the best hope for a more resilient banana is through genetic engineering. However, the resulting fruit also needs to taste good, ripen in a predictable amount of time, travel long distances undamaged, and be easy to grow in great quantities. Currently, no cultivar or hybrid meets all of these criteria.

=== Australian quarantine ===

In Queensland, a farm in Tully, north of Brisbane, was quarantined and some plants were destroyed after TR4 was detected on March 3, 2015. After an initial shutdown of the infected farm, truckloads of fruit left in April with harvesting allowed to resume under strict biosecurity arrangements. The government says it is not feasible to eradicate the fungus. Researchers like Gert Kema, based at Wageningen University, The Netherlands, say the disease will continue to spread, despite efforts to contain it, as long as susceptible varieties are being grown. The disease was again detected in Tully in July 2017, prompting Biosecurity Queensland to impose quarantine conditions.

Outside experts were brought in to review Biosecurity Queensland&#x27;s performance 15 February to 24 May 2021. Their assessment credits BQ with quick and effective response which is being emulated by other countries. Thus far TR4 continues to be contained to the Tully Valley only and containment is thought to be possible as long as accidental human movement and transport in flowing water can be halted.

=== Spread to Colombia ===
In August 2019, authorities in Colombia declared a national emergency after confirming that Panama disease had reached Latin America. &quot;Once you see it, it is too late, and it has likely already spread outside that zone without recognition,&quot; said one expert quoted by &quot;National Geographic&quot;.

== Disease management ==
As fungicides are largely ineffective, there are few options for managing Panama disease. Chemical sterilisation of the soil with methyl bromide significantly reduced incidence of the disease but was found to be effective for only three years after which the pathogen had recolonised the fumigated areas. Injecting the host plants with carbendazim and potassium phosphonate appears to provide some control but results have been inconclusive. Heat treatment of soil has also been tried in the Philippines but the pathogen is likely to reinvade the treated area. The greatest hope for managing this disease in infested soils is the development of genetic modifications that will provide resistant cultivars. Early research into &quot;Foc&quot; often was conducted by large companies with a financial interest in banana productivity, especially the United Fruit Company. Among UFC&#x27;s notable pathologists was Frederick Wellman in the 1920s.

Modified bananas developed in collaboration by Ugandan and Belgian scientists were reported in 2008 to be grown experimentally in Uganda. In Australia the movement, sharing, and sale of propagation material is heavily restricted, especially between states, to slow down the combined threat of TR4, Bunchy Top, and leaf spot. The gene is () totally effective against TR4. It is unexpressed in Cavendish but has been found expressed in the diploid &quot;M. a.&quot; ssp. &quot;malaccensis&quot;. It may be possible to produce an expressing Cavendish with CRISPR.

Several bacterially-derived volatile organic compounds have been found by Yuan et al 2012 to be selectively toxic to &quot;Foc&quot;: Various alkylated benzenes, various phenols, various naphthalenes, benzothiazole, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, 2-undecanol, 2-nonanone, 2-decanone, 2-undecanone, nonanal, and decanal.
Currently, fungicides and other chemical and biological control agents have proven fairly unsuccessful, or only successful in vitro or in greenhouses, in the face of Panama disease of bananas. The most commonly used practices include mostly sanitation and quarantine practices to prevent the spread of Panama disease out of infected fields. However, the most effective tool against Panama disease is the development of banana plants resistant to &quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot; f. sp. &quot;cubense&quot;. The clonal reproduction of banana has led to a consequential lack of other varieties. Efforts are being made to produce resistant varieties, but with bananas being triploids which do not produce seeds, this is not an easy task. Creating clones from tissue cultures, rather than suckers, has proven somewhat successful in breeding resistant varieties, although these tend to have decreased success in stress-tolerance, yield, or other beneficial traits necessary for commercial varieties. Nevertheless, these efforts are leading to the best control measure for Panama disease of banana.

In 2017, a disease-resistance gene (RGA2) was transformed into Cavendish bananas which showed disease resistance to Fusarium wilt tropical race 4. One specific transformed line, which consisted of eight plants, showed resistance in the field for all of them. The field trial lasted three years and the plants exhibited a yield drag.
Taiwanese researchers believe that the onset of TR4 was linked to soil degradation caused by the use of chemical fertilizers.

Hong et al 2020 achieved significant suppression with a chilli pepper/banana rotation. This success is not merely applicable to &quot;Musa&quot; or even crops in general - it suggests that a similar &quot;rotation&quot; concept in livestock is advisable.

The resistance of different banana cultivars to the pathogen is under scrutiny.

The FAO provides a sanitation and diagnostic manual.

=== Banana breeding impeded by triploidy ===
One major impediment to breeding bananas is polyploidy; Gros Michel and Cavendish bananas are triploid and thus attempts at meiosis in the plant&#x27;s ovules cannot produce a viable gamete. Only rarely does the first reduction division in meiosis in the plants&#x27; flowers tidily fail completely, resulting in a euploid triploid ovule, which can be fertilized by normal haploid pollen from a diploid banana variety; a whole stem of bananas would contain only a few seeds and sometimes none. As a result, the resulting new banana variety is tetraploid, and thus contains seeds; the market for bananas is not accustomed to bananas with seeds. Experience showed that where both meiosis steps failed, causing a heptaploid seedling, or when the seedling is aneuploid, results are not as good.

Second-generation breeding using those new tetraploids as both parents has tended not to yield good results, because the first generation contains the Gros Michel triploid gene set intact (plus possibly useful features in the added fourth chromosome set), but in the second generation, the Gros Michel gene set has been broken up by meiosis.

The Honduras Foundation for Agricultural Research cultivates several varieties of the Gros Michel. They have succeeded in producing a few seeds by hand-pollinating the flowers with pollen from diploid seeded bananas.

<text>is a 2004 Japanese animated steampunk action film directed and co-written by Katsuhiro Otomo, produced by Sunrise, it is his second major anime as a director, following &quot;Akira&quot; (1988). The film was released in Japan by Toho on July 17, 2004.

&quot;Steamboy&quot; was the most expensive Japanese film ever produced, with a () production budget, having been in production for ten years and utilizing more than 180,000 drawings and 440 CG cuts.

==Plot==
In 1863, where an alternate nineteenth century Europe has made tremendous strides in steam-powered technologies, scientist Lloyd Steam and his son, Edward &quot;Eddy&quot; Steam, have succeeded in discovering a pure mineral water in Iceland which they believe can be harnessed as a nearly unlimited power source for steam engines. An experiment in Russian Alaska goes terribly wrong, with Eddy being engulfed in freezing gases, but results in the creation of a spherical device. Three years later, Lloyd sends the device, along with its schematics, to his grandson (and Eddy&#x27;s son), James Ray Steam, who works as a maintenance boy in Manchester, England, along with instructions to guard it. Members of &quot;The O&#x27;Hara Foundation&quot; arrive and attempt to steal the sphere, but Lloyd appears, stating that the device killed Eddy and bids Ray to flee and deliver the device to Robert Stephenson. After fleeing the O&#x27;Hara agents on his personal steam-powered monowheel, Ray briefly meets Stephenson on a train headed into Manchester, but Ray, along with the device, are captured by O&#x27;Hara agents in a dirigible.

Ray is taken to London, where preparations are being made for the 1866 Great Exhibition, and meets Scarlett O&#x27;Hara St Johns, the spoiled granddaughter of the Foundation&#x27;s head chairman, Charles O&#x27;Hara St Johns. He also discovers Eddy, alive but severely scarred and mechanized from his injuries in Alaska, working with O&#x27;Hara on the &quot;Steam Castle&quot;; an elaborate facility entirely powered by three devices called &quot;Steam Balls&quot;, one of which was the device sent to Ray. The latter is enamored both by the castle, and his father&#x27;s vision of using it to enlighten mankind, and volunteers to help complete the project. He also begins developing a love/hate friendship with Scarlett, who seems to be attracted to him. Ray encounters Lloyd again, who was captured by O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s henchmen, but has escaped from his cell and is attempting to sabotage the castle, revealing that the Foundation&#x27;s true intentions for the exhibition is to sell weapons of war. Lloyd shows Ray a hidden armory filled with massive steam-powered war machines built by Eddy, and Ray struggles with the moral dichotomy of being a scientist — of how to contribute to the world without giving into vanity, leaving him conflicted as to whether to side with Lloyd or Edward, who themselves have become estranged.

Lloyd and Ray reach the core of the castle and remove one of the Steam Balls, but Lloyd is shot and recaptured by O&#x27;Hara, as Ray escapes with the device. The next morning, the exhibition is underway, and Ray brings the ball to Stephenson, giving him the ball and the knowledge he acquired in captivity. The British military attempts to arrest Eddy, but Eddy unleashes his steam powered weapons on the soldiers, turning the exhibition into a battlefield. When Stephenson uses the Steam Ball to enhance his own company&#x27;s tanks, Ray realizes that he had no better intentions than the Foundation. Eager to show the world the castle&#x27;s true power, Eddy orders it to be prematurely activated, causing the structure to rise and shed its decorative outer shell, revealing it to be a monstrous floating fortress. As the Royal Navy and Stephenson attempt to defend London from the floating fortress, Ray steals the Steam Ball back and uses it to create a makeshift aircraft to re-board the fortress. Ray meets Eddy, Scarlett, and Lloyd in the castle&#x27;s control room, where Lloyd confronts Eddy about his actions, before shooting him in a fit of rage, but Eddy falls into a cloud of steam and disappears.

With the castle steered off course, the structure has become unstable and threatens to explode over the city. As Lloyd and Ray rush to redirect the castle over the Thames, Eddy, whose metal body repelled the gunshot, re-emerges from the steam and assists them, having realized his folly. Ray re-installs the stolen steam ball, and makes his way to the control room to make a final escape with Scarlett on an emergency jetpack, while Eddy and Lloyd reconcile and halt the machine over the river and escape as well. The castle detonates in a spectacular explosion, sparing the city from destruction. The ending montage reveals Ray returning home, and later becoming a global superhero using the jetpack gear from the castle; Lloyd introducing Ray to electricity and finally passing away; Eddy founding a corporate conglomerate; Scarlett maturing and becoming a famous pilot, and a war being fought with paratroopers and zeppelins.

==Characters==
* 
: The main character, a 13-year-old boy living in Manchester, is an inventor following the paths of his father and grandfather. He possesses a mechanical talent that was inherited from his family, and demonstrates this in at least two instances by building a steam-powered monowheel and a steam-propelled flying device. He has a youthful idealism and sincerely dislikes the employment of technology for harmful purposes. During the film his motivations are alternately swayed by the influences of his father and grandfather.
* 
: Selfish, spoiled, misguided, yet whimsical and not completely heartless; she is the American 14-year-old granddaughter of the chairman of the O&#x27;Hara Foundation. She matures as a result of her encounter with Ray. Her character is based upon the fictional character of the same name, from the novel &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.
* 
: Ray&#x27;s idealistic grandfather. The original conceiver of the Steamball, which he succeeds in developing with his son Edward. Lloyd&#x27;s pursuit of progress without much regards to safety and ignorance of Eddy&#x27;s pleading directly leads to his son&#x27;s disfigurement. A difference of opinions with his son Edward leads to friction between them. While Edward believes that science is an instrument of power, Lloyd simply wishes to use it to help people. They both develop distinctly different visions for their ultimate invention, the Steam Castle. It is later revealed that Lloyd intended the Steam Castle to be a sort of flying amusement park, but Eddy scoffed at such a premise, denouncing it as a &quot;fairy tale vision&quot;. Edward instead built the Steam Castle as a flying military fortress.
* 
: Ray&#x27;s father. The accident that occurred in the development of the Steamball left Edward in a state where he needed to have machinery replace some of his body, including his right arm and parts of his legs. It left him not only physically disfigured, but it severely twisted his morals as well, driving him to believe that science is an expression of mankind&#x27;s ultimate power. Edward&#x27;s father calls him Eddy. He uses the Foundation and the Exhibition as a springboard to launch his ultimate invention: a monstrous, flying war machine called the Steam Castle.
* 
: Edward and Lloyd Steam&#x27;s friend and rival, a major player in the Industrial Revolution. He claims that he wishes to use the Steam Ball for the good of the British Empire, but exactly &quot;how&quot; he plans to do it is questionable. Possibly based upon the real-life Robert Stephenson.
* 
: Young, talented engineer and Robert Stephenson&#x27;s loyal right hand. His kindness does not betray a thirsty ambition.
* 
: The O&#x27;Hara Foundation&#x27;s chairman&#x27;s representative, whose duties also seems to be Miss Scarlett&#x27;s caretaker and personal servant; he is overweight and wears glasses. Grossly obsessed with money, he continues to market his wares even when his life is in danger, with comical results.
* 
: The smarter of the two O&#x27;Hara thugs, Alfred works with Jason in trying to steal the Steamball. He outlives his oafish companion, and seems to hate Ray even more. He, along with Jason, performs much of Simon&#x27;s dirty work. The two of them capture Ray and bring him to London, and later attempt to kill him. Alfred does so by trying to smash him with a construction crane, but Ray deftly avoids it, causing it to slam into Alfred instead.
* 
: One of the men working in the O&#x27;Hara Foundation in the United States of America. Jason and Alfred were the ones that want to get the Steamball. However, Ray Steam is kidnapped. He represents the more brutish half of the two O&#x27;Hara thugs, and engages in a vicious aerial battle with Ray toward the end of the movie.
* 
: Ray&#x27;s mother who volunteers as a teacher for the neighbouring children (as seen at the beginning of the movie).
* 
: A friend of Ray&#x27;s.
* 
: Emma&#x27;s brother.
; The Admiral
: Highly decorated and a Knight of the Order of the Garter, the Admiral is Robert Stephenson&#x27;s main point of contact with the British Government. The Admiral is rather set in his ways, believing that men, not machines, fight wars. He displays a stereotypically British style of composure, calmly taking afternoon tea on the deck of his flagship while a battle rages nearby.

The VHS and DVD was released in Japan on April 15, 2005, in Australia on June 22, 2005, the USA on July 26, 2005, and the UK on March 27, 2006. Both the edited English version and the original Japanese version were made available on DVD, with the longer version being sold as the &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;. The UK Blu-ray/DVD combo version of the film is the original, full length version. However, it has been misprinted as the cut down version of the film. The trailer and DVD menu both make use of the song &quot;Full Force&quot; by John Powell.

===Video game===
&quot;Steamboy&quot; was later adapted into a video game for the PlayStation 2 in Japan by Bandai. (Development by Cavia and SIMS)

==Release==
&quot;Steamboy&quot; was released in Japan on July 17, 2004, alongside &quot;Pokémon: Destiny Deoxys&quot; where it was distributed by Toho. The film was released in the United States by Triumph Films with an English-language dub on March 18, 2005, prior to this, TriStar Pictures was going to release the movie. The film was released to home video in the United States by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment (via Triumph Films and Destination Films) with an English-language dub and the original Japanese version with English subtitles on July 26, 2005.

==Reception==
===Box office===
In Japan, the film grossed , making it the 18th highest-grossing domestic film of 2004. The film was not a box office success in the United States, where it grossed $468,867 in 2005.

According to the reviewer KJB at IGN this could be due to the marketing methods used and the incredibly small limited release in the United States. &quot;Steamboy&quot; could have had a larger Western audience, but due to the limited release, that was not able to happen. &quot;&quot;Steamboy&quot; is one of those few anime films that would be able to play to a wide audience in the United States. Instead, the film is getting a limited release through Sony&#x27;s smaller label, skipping some cities entirely and only playing in smaller art houses in many of the cities that are getting the film.&quot;

===Critical response===
The movie received positive reviews. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave &quot;Steamboy&quot; a rating of 61% based on over 90 reviews, and an average rating of 6.1/10, with the site&#x27;s consensus &quot;The story isn&#x27;t the greatest, but there&#x27;s an abundance of sci-fi eye candy to compensate.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.
&quot;Steamboy&quot; was the 2004 recipient of Best Animated Feature Film at the Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival. 

Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; states, &quot;the movie turns out to be one of those science-fiction pieces that is drawn from a peculiar moment in science, so the fiction has a historical sense to it. &quot;Steamboy&quot; clearly means to be a critique of Western culture: It uses issues such as industrialism, domination, mass destruction, ambition and despotism as a background to what feels like a boys&#x27; book adventure&quot;. The film received overall positive reviews from reviewers.

<text>Behind the Screen is a 1916 American silent short comedy film written by, directed by, and starring Charlie Chaplin, and also starring Eric Campbell and Edna Purviance. The film is in the public domain.

==Plot==
The film takes place in a silent movie studio. Charlie Chaplin plays stagehand named David who has an enormous supervisor named Goliath (Eric Campbell). David is overworked but is still labelled as a loafer by the lazy Goliath and his supervisor. A country girl (Edna Purviance) arrives at the studio in hopes of becoming an actress, but is quickly turned away by Goliath. Most of the other stagehands go on wildcat strike to protest their sleep being interrupted during their lunch break. Only David and Goliath remain on the job. The girl returns and stealthily dresses in one of the striking stagehand&#x27;s work clothes. Disguised as a man, she gets a job as a stagehand too. David discovers that the new stagehand is actually a female. When he gives her a series of quick kisses, the action is seen by Goliath who makes effeminate gestures at David. Edna overhears the strikers&#x27; plans to blow up the studio with dynamite and helps thwart their villainous plot.

Much of the film is slapstick comedy involving Chaplin manhandling large props, mishandling the control to a trap door, and engaging in a raucous pie-throwing fight which spills over into another studio where a period drama is being shot. In one scene Chaplin deftly carries 11 chairs over his back in his left hand and lifts a piano in his right hand.

==Cast==

* Charlie Chaplin as David (Goliath&#x27;s assistant)
* Edna Purviance as The Girl
* Eric Campbell as Goliath (a stagehand)
* Albert Austin as Stagehand (uncredited)

==Production==

&quot;Behind the Screen&quot; was the last of Chaplin&#x27;s comedies to use a movie studio as a backdrop. Earlier Chaplin films, such as &quot;A Film Johnnie&quot;, &quot;His New Job&quot;, and &quot;The Masquerader&quot; had also been set, at least partly, in a silent movie studio. In &quot;Behind the Screen&quot;, Chaplin pokes gentle fun at Keystone Studios where he broke into the movies in 1914 and worked under contract for Mack Sennett for a year. The pie-throwing sequence is an obvious allusion to the Keystone style of slapstick comedies where such skirmishes were overly common. One intertitle humorously refers to the pie-throwing gimmick as &quot;a new idea.&quot;

==References in documentaries==
The 1983 documentary series &quot;Unknown Chaplin&quot; revealed previously unseen footage from this movie, including an alternate take where Purviance&#x27;s character is shown playing a harp; an outtake in which Edna, playing the guitar, starts laughing (the documentary supports the belief that Purviance and Chaplin were romantically involved at the time); and several takes of a sequence in which Chaplin&#x27;s character narrowly misses having his feet chopped off by an axe (accomplished by filming the scene backwards) - this sequence was never used in the final film.

The 1995 documentary &quot;The Celluloid Closet&quot; draws attention to the scene where Chaplin&#x27;s character - after learning that Purviance&#x27;s character is really a woman - kisses her while on the set; at this point, a male stagehand enters and, thinking that Chaplin has kissed a man, starts acting in an overtly effeminate way until Chaplin kicks him.

==Review==

A reviewer for &quot;Variety&quot; penned, &quot;The latest Charlie Chaplin release is a two-reeler that is to be classed with one of the best laugh-producers that the world&#x27;s champion high-priced film comic has done for Mutual. Most of the stunts might be classed with the earlier and most successful type of work pulled by Chaplin. Yet not once does he have possession of the bamboo cane nor does he wear that humpty-dumpty derby. The action, which in no case drags, takes place presumably on the floor of a film studio with a large chance for fun with the numerous props.&quot;

By contrast, The Moving Picture World gave a less-than-enthusiastic review: &quot; While this Chaplin effort will doubtless evoke much laughter from a certain class of audience, it is not one to be strongly recommended. There is throughout a distinct vein of vulgarity which is unnecessary, even in slapstick comedy. A great deal of comedy is intended to be extracted from a pie slinging episode which occurs during the rehearsal of a couple of scenes in a moving picture studio. The funniest part of the comedy occurs during the manipulation of a trap door in one of the scenes by Chaplin. All of the action takes place in a moving picture studio.&quot;

==Sound version==
In 1932, Amedee Van Beuren of Van Beuren Studios, purchased Chaplin&#x27;s Mutual comedies for $10,000 each, added music by Gene Rodemich and Winston Sharples and sound effects, and re-released them through RKO Radio Pictures. Chaplin had no legal recourse to stop the RKO release.

<doc id="770105" wikidata="Q3128709" url="?curid=770105" title="Havildar">
<text>Havildar or havaldar (Hindustani: or , ) is a rank in the Indian and Pakistani armies, equivalent to sergeant. It is not used in cavalry units, where the equivalent is daffadar. 

Like a British sergeant, a havildar wears three rank chevrons.

==History==
&quot;Havildar&quot; is a Persian word in origin and means &quot;person in charge&quot;, or more loosely &quot;chief&quot;, from the Arabic (&quot;charge&quot;, &quot;responsibility&quot;) and the Persian (dâr, &quot;holder&quot;). Historically, a havildar was a senior commander, being in charge of a fort during the times of the Mughal Empire. It was used as the equivalent of a sergeant in the British Raj, which has led to its current usage.

==Appointments==
===Indian Army===
Havildars could be further appointed to positions of higher authority. The appointments of company quartermaster havildar and company havildar major existed in the British Indian Army. Historically, the two senior-most havildars of a company became the CQMH and the CHM. However, these were just appointments and the commanding officer could promote or demote any of these ranks at his discretion. These appointments still technically exist in the modern Indian Army. However, havildars are now promoted directly to junior commissioned officer rank, as the duties of these historical appointments are now carried out by JCOs.
