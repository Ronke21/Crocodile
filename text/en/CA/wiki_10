<text>The 1993 Atlantic hurricane season was a deadly, though below average Atlantic hurricane season that produced ten tropical cyclones, eight tropical storms, four hurricanes, and one major hurricane. It officially started on June 1 and ended on November 30, dates which conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean. The first tropical cyclone, Tropical Depression One, developed on May 31, while the final storm, Tropical Depression Ten, dissipated on September 30, well before the average dissipation date of a season&#x27;s last tropical cyclone; this represented the earliest end to the hurricane season in ten years.

The most intense hurricane, Emily, was a Category 3 on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale that paralleled close to the North Carolina coastline causing minor damage and a few deaths before moving out to sea. The most destructive named storm of the season was Hurricane Gert, a tropical cyclone that devastated several countries in Central America and Mexico. Throughout the impact areas, damage totaled to $170 million (1993 USD) and 102 fatalities were reported. The remnants of Gert reached the Pacific Ocean and was classified as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E.The deadliest system was Tropical Storm Bret, which resulted in 184 deaths, in addition to causing $25 million in losses as it tracked generally westward across Trinidad, Venezuela, Colombia, and Nicaragua. In the Pacific Ocean, the remnants of Bret were attributed to the development of Hurricane Greg. Three other tropical cyclones brought minor to moderate effects on land; they were Tropical Depression One and Tropical Storms Arlene and Cindy. The storms of the 1993 Atlantic hurricane season collectively caused 382 fatalities and $322.3 million in losses.

==Seasonal forecasts==
===Pre-season forecasts===
Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by Dr. William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University (CSU) and the Weather Research Center (WRC). A normal season as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has 12.1 named storms, of which 6.4 reach hurricane strength, and 2.7 become major hurricanes. In December 1992, Gray anticipated a near average season with 11 named storms, 6 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes. Another predication on April 16, 1993 was unchanged from the previous forecast. In June, Gray revised the number of hurricanes to seven, though the forecast of named storms and major hurricanes remained the same. By August, the number hurricanes predicted was lowered back to six, matching the December 1992 and April forecasts. The sole prediction made by the WRC called for seven named storms and five hurricanes, though no forecast was made on the numbers of major hurricanes.
== Season summary ==
The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, thus activity began a day early with the development of Tropical Depression One on May 31. It was a below average season in which 10 tropical depressions formed. Eight of the depressions attained tropical storm status, and four of these attained hurricane status. In addition, one tropical cyclone eventually attained major hurricane status, which is below the 1981–2010 average of 2.7 per season. The low amount of activity is attributed to abnormally strong wind shear across the Atlantic basin. Only one hurricane and three tropical storms made landfall during the season; Tropical Depression One and Hurricane Emily also caused land impacts. However, the storm collectively caused 382 deaths and $322.3 million in damage. The last storm of the season, Tropical Depression Ten, became extratropical on September 30, two months before the official end of the season on November 30.

Tropical cyclogenesis in the 1993 Atlantic hurricane season began with the development of Tropical Depression One on May 31. However, in the following two months, minimal activity occurred, with only one named storm, Arlene, in June. August was the most active month, with four systems developing: Tropical Storms Bret, Cindy, and Dennis, as well as Hurricane Emily. September, normally the climatological peak of hurricane season, had only three named storms form: Hurricanes Floyd, Gert, and Harvey. The final Atlantic tropical cyclone of 1993, Tropical Depression Ten, became extratropical on September 30, two months before the official end of the season on November 30.

Overall, the season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 39. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding or tropical storm strength. Subtropical cyclones are excluded from the total.

== Systems ==

=== Tropical Depression One ===
A westward-moving tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression One near the Isle of Youth on May 31. Due to strong wind shear and its proximity to land, the depression was unable to strengthen and struck western Cuba later that day. It emerged into the Straits of Florida early on June 1 and began to organize and intensify slightly further, but nonetheless remained below tropical storm intensity. Around that time, an approaching shortwave trough accelerated the depression northeastward across the western Bahamas. Thereafter, the wind field of the depression began expanding and lost all tropical characteristics while located northeast of The Bahamas on June 2.

Heavy rainfall in Cuba caused flooding in the central and eastern portions of the country, forcing the evacuation of 40,000 people, destroying 1,860 homes and damaging an additional 16,500. Additionally, crops suffered severe impact from the flooding, just two months after significant agricultural damage in Cuba from the Storm of the Century in March. Overall, the depression left seven fatalities and another five people were listed as missing. In Haiti, flooding from the outer bands of the storm killed thousands of livestock and resulted in 13 deaths. Heavy precipitation in Florida peaked at nearly , though it caused little impact other than bringing drought relief. Impact, if any in The Bahamas, is unknown.
=== Tropical Storm Arlene ===
A tropical wave was tracked in the Caribbean Sea beginning on June 9 and subsequently moved across Central America. Eventually, the system entered the Gulf of Mexico, though further development was interrupted by unfavorable wind shear. After conditions became somewhat more favorable, the wave developed into Tropical Depression Two on June 18. The depression slowly strengthened as it tracked west-northwestward and eventually north-northwestward across the western Gulf of Mexico. By June 19, the depression became Tropical Storm Arlene. At 09:00 UTC on the following day, Arlene made landfall on Padre Island, Texas with winds of . The storm quickly weakened inland and degenerated into a remnant low pressure area on June 21.

In El Salvador, rainfall from the precursor tropical wave caused mudslides throughout the country, which in turn resulted in 20 fatalities. Immense amounts of precipitation in Mexico caused flooding in the states of Veracruz, Campeche, Yucatán, San Luis Potosí, Quintana Roo, Nuevo León, and Jalisco. Five deaths and $33 million in damage was reported in Mexico. Arlene also dropped torrential rainfall in Texas, peaking at Angleton, while precipitation amounts elsewhere was mainly between . Throughout the state, numerous roads were inundated and more than 650 houses, including 25 mobile homes, suffered water damage. Agriculture losses in eastern Texas include 20% of cantaloupe, 10% of watermelon, and 18% of tomatoes. One fatality occurred and damage in Texas reached $22 million. Overall, Tropical Storm Arlene caused 26 deaths and $55 million in losses.
=== Tropical Storm Bret ===
A westward-moving tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Three while located about west of Cape Verde on August 4. The depression strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Bret on the following day. It strengthened slightly and reached winds of and maintained that intensity until crossing Trinidad on August 7. Later that day, Bret made landfall near Macuro, Venezuela, before briefly re-emerging into the Caribbean Sea. Bret made another landfall in Venezuela on August 8 and crossed northern Colombia. It weakened over the mountainous terrain and fell to tropical depression intensity over the southwestern Caribbean Sea. Bret re-strengthened to a tropical storm before making landfall in southern Nicaragua on August 10. It crossed into the Pacific Ocean and dissipated, although it later regenerated into Hurricane Greg.

In Trinidad, winds left 35,000 people without electricity, while rainfall caused minor damage to crops and roads, with losses totaling to about $909,000. Rainfall in Venezuela reached in some areas. As a result, widespread mudslides were reported, which in turn destroyed 10,000 houses and caused 173 deaths. One fatality was reported in neighboring Colombia. In Nicaragua, the storm destroyed 850 houses and damaged an additional 1,500. Overall, 35,000 people were left homeless in that country. In addition, the destruction of 25 medical centers, 10 schools, and 10 churches occurred. Road infrastructure damage was also reported, with 12 bridges collapsing during the passage of Bret. There were 10 fatalities in Nicaragua, 9 of which were drowning victims after a Spanish vessel sank. Overall, Tropical Storm Bret caused 184 deaths and about $25 million in damage.
=== Tropical Storm Cindy ===
A tropical wave entered the Atlantic Ocean from northwest Africa on August 8. It traversed the Atlantic and organized into Tropical Depression Four on August 14, while located within to the north of Barbados. After six hours, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Cindy, while crossing the island of Martinique. Due to a poor upper-level structure, Cindy barely intensified as it tracked west-northwestward across the eastern Caribbean Sea. Nonetheless, the storm peaked with winds of on August 16. However, interaction with the terrain of Hispaniola caused Cindy to weaken. Late on August 16, the storm had been reduced to a tropical depression, around the time of landfall near Barahona, Dominican Republic. Cindy rapidly weakened inland and dissipated by early on August 17.

The storm dropped torrential rainfall in Martinique, peaking at in Saint-Joseph, which fell in only two hours. Further, fell in just six minutes. Several rivers overflowed as a result, which in turn caused widespread flooding and mudslides. Several roads were washed out, numerous cars were swept away, and at least 150 houses were destroyed, leaving about 3,000 people homeless. Overall, the storm caused two fatalities, 11 injuries, and ₣107 million (US$19 million) in damage. On other Lesser Antilles, the storm caused minimally impact, limited to mostly small amounts of precipitation, light winds, and minor beach erosion, especially on Puerto Rico. In Dominican Republic, street and minor river flooding was reported, which affected hundreds of residents. In addition, Cindy left two deaths in the Dominican Republic.
=== Hurricane Emily ===
A tropical wave passed through Cape Verde on August 17. The system moved northwestward and slowly acquired a low-level center of circulation. At 18:00 UTC on August 22, Tropical Depression Five developed while located several hundred miles east-northeast of the Lesser Antilles on August 22. Initially, it headed northwestward while minimal intensification, though by August 25, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Emily. The storm then became nearly stationary while southeast of Bermuda and steadily strengthened during that time. Late on August 26, Emily briefly became a hurricane, though it weakened back to a tropical storm early on the following day. However, by late on August 27, Emily was a hurricane once again. The storm then moved northwestward and maintained Category 1 intensity until becoming a Category 2 hurricane on August 31. By 18:00 UTC, Emily became a Category 3 hurricane while just offshore Cape Hatteras.

However, the storm veered out to sea later on August 29 and weakened, falling to tropical storm intensity while located northeast of Bermuda on September 3. After curving southward and then back to the northeast, Emily weakened to a tropical depression on September 4. The storm lost all tropical characteristics on September 6, while located several hundred miles southeast of Newfoundland. The outer bands of Emily lashed the Outer Banks of North Carolina with heavy rainfall, high tides, and strong winds. The combination of those effects damaged 553 homes beyond repair. Sinkholes formed along North Carolina Highway 12 and strong winds uprooted trees, downed power lines, and tore off roofs. Further north, two fishermen near Nags Head drowned, while a 15-year-old boy also drowned. Light rainfall was also reported in Maryland and Delaware. Losses reached $45 million, with all damage in North Carolina.
=== Tropical Storm Dennis ===

A tropical wave and its associated low pressure area emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on August 21. By the following day, two METEOSAT satellites indicated that the system had a distinct cyclonic rotation and increasing deep convection. At 12:00 UTC on August 23, Tropical Depression Six developed while located about west-southwest of Brava, Cape Verde. Initially, a weak deep-layer mean flow caused the depression to track west-northwest. It is estimated that by 12:00 UTC on August 24, the depression became Tropical Storm Dennis, based on satellite imagery.

Early on August 25, Dennis attained its peak intensity with winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . After peak intensity, a relatively strong mid- to upper-level trough caused Dennis to turn north-northwestward on August 26. Thereafter, an increase in vertical wind shear and a decrease in sea surface temperatures caused the storm to begin weakening. Eventually, the low-level circulation became nearly void of deep convection. On August 27, Dennis was downgraded to a tropical depression. The storm later curved west-southwestward, while located about midway between Bermuda and the southernmost islands of Cape Verde.
=== Hurricane Floyd ===

A tropical wave crossed the west coast of Africa on August 28. Although had it a well-defined low-level circulation, the system was not classified as a tropical cyclone. While tracking west, deep convection diminished and was nearly non-existent by August 31, though the cloud pattern began re-developing on September 3. Eventually, the system curved northwestward and remained well away from the Lesser Antilles. Because a reconnaissance flight into the system indicated a low-level circulation with persistent deep convection, it is estimated that the system became Tropical Depression Seven at 12:00 UTC on September 7, while located about north-northwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Only six hours after becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Floyd. Initially, strong southwesterly wind shear prevented further significant intensification.

The storm accelerated north-northwestward after becoming embedded within fast air currents, which was as Floyd moved between a strong trough and a subtropical high pressure area. Later on September 8, the storm passed about west of Bermuda. By early on September 9, convection developed along the once exposed low-level circulation. After a buoy reported a two-minute sustained wind speed of and an eye appeared on satellite imagery, Floyd was upgraded to a hurricane at 18:00 UTC on September 9. While accelerating at nearly , the storm began losing tropical characteristics as a result of colder sea surface temperatures and became extratropical at 18:00 UTC on September 10. The remnants of Floyd continued rapidly eastward and struck Brittany, France, at an intensity equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane. While passing southeast of Newfoundland, the storm produced light rainfall, peaking at about .
=== Hurricane Gert ===
A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on September 5. The system slowly organize while tracking across the Atlantic Ocean and much of the Caribbean Sea. It developed into a tropical depression while located north of Panama on September 14. On the following day, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gert before moving ashore in Nicaragua. After weakening to a tropical depression, it proceeded into Honduras and reorganized into a tropical storm over the Gulf of Honduras on September 17. Gert made landfall in Belize on the following day and again weakened to a depression while inland. After crossing the Yucatán Peninsula, Gert emerged over warm water in the Bay of Campeche, and strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane on September 20. The hurricane then made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Mexico near Tuxpan, Veracruz, with winds of . Rugged terrain quickly disrupted its structure and Gert entered the Pacific Ocean as a tropical depression from Nayarit on September 21. Five days later, the depression dissipated near Baja California.

Because Gert had a broad wind circulation, it produced widespread and heavy rainfall across Central America, which, combined with saturated soil from Tropical Storm Bret a month earlier, caused significant flooding of property and crops. Although hurricane-force winds occurred upon landfall in Mexico, the worst effects in the country were due to flooding and mudslides induced by torrential rain. Following the overflow of several rivers, deep flood waters submerged extensive parts of Veracruz and Tamaulipas and forced hundreds of thousands to evacuate, including 200,000 in the Tampico area alone. The heaviest rainfall occurred further inland over the mountainous region of San Luis Potosí, where as much as of precipitation were measured. In the wake of the disaster, the road networks across the affected countries were severely disrupted and thousands of people became homeless. Extensive, but less severe flooding occurred in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Throughout the effected areas, flooding damaged or destroyed more than 40,000 buildings. The storm caused at least 102 fatalities and more than $170 million in damage.
=== Hurricane Harvey ===

A tropical wave passed south of Cape Verde on September 12. By the following day, satellite imagery indicated a cloud system center. The system tracked northwestward across the Atlantic Ocean with slow further development. Due to interaction with an upper-level low on September 18, the system began to significantly organize. After a ship known as &quot;ELFS&quot; reported winds of , it is estimated that Tropical Depression Nine developed at 18:00 UTC on September 18, while located about south-southeast of Bermuda. The depression initially moved north-northwest, though an approaching short-wave trough eventually caused it to move northeastward.

Convection remained disorganized and the low-level circulation was exposed on September 19. However, by the following day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Harvey. Thereafter, the storm began to rapidly intensify and developed an eye appeared on satellite imagery. While accelerating northeastward, Harvey was upgraded to a hurricane at 18:00 UTC on September 20. However, decreasing sea surface temperatures caused Harvey to immediately weaken back to a tropical storm, while also losing tropical characteristics. At 18:00 UTC on September 21, Harvey transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while located well east of Newfoundland. Six hours later, the extratropical remnants of Harvey were absorbed into a frontal band.
=== Tropical Depression Ten ===

Tropical Depression Ten developed about southeast of Bermuda at 18:00 UTC on September 29. Initially, convection associated with the depression was confined to north and east of the center. The depression was difficult to track, though wind observations in Bermuda suggested that it passed just north of the island between 0300 and 07:00 UTC on September 30. Although no intensification was predicted, the National Hurricane Center noted that interaction with the approaching cold front could result in baroclinic strengthening. The depression did not organize further and merged with the cold front at 00:00 UTC on October 1.
== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 1993. This was the same list used for the 1987 season. No names were retired following the season, so the list was used again for the 1999 season.

<text>Orchitis is inflammation of the testicles. It can also involve swelling, pains, and frequent infection, particularly of the epididymis, as in epididymitis. The term is from the Ancient Greek meaning &quot;testicle&quot;; same root as &quot;orchid&quot;.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of orchitis are similar to those of testicular torsion. These can include:
* hematospermia (blood in the semen)
* hematuria (blood in the urine)
* severe pain
* visible swelling of a testicle or testicles and often the inguinal lymph nodes on the affected side.

==Causes==
Orchitis can be related to epididymitis infection that has spread to the testicles (then called &quot;epididymo-orchitis&quot;), sometimes caused by the sexually transmitted infections chlamydia and gonorrhea. It has also been reported in cases of males infected with brucellosis. Orchitis can also be seen during active mumps, particularly in adolescent boys.

Ischemic orchitis may result from damage to the blood vessels of the spermatic cord during inguinal herniorrhaphy, and may in the worst event lead to testicular atrophy.

==Diagnosis==

* Blood – ESR high
* Urine – Cultural &amp; Sensitivity test
* Ultrasound scanning

==Treatment==
In most cases where orchitis is caused by epididymitis, treatment is an oral antibiotic such as cefalexin or ciprofloxacin until the infection clears up. In both causes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen or ibuprofen are recommended to relieve pain. Sometimes stronger pain medications in the opiate category are called for and are frequently prescribed by experienced emergency department physicians.

== Other animals ==
Orchitis is not rare in bulls and rams. It has also been described in roosters.

<doc id="759382" wikidata="Q2290527" url="?curid=759382" title="Bowman's layer">
<text>The Bowman&#x27;s layer (Bowman&#x27;s membrane, anterior limiting lamina, anterior elastic lamina) is a smooth, acellular, nonregenerating layer, located between the superficial epithelium and the stroma in the cornea of the eye. It is composed of strong, randomly oriented collagen fibrils in which the smooth anterior surface faces the epithelial basement membrane and the posterior surface merges with the collagen lamellae of the corneal stroma proper.

In adult humans, Bowman&#x27;s layer is 8-12 μm thick. With ageing, this layer becomes thinner.

The function of the Bowman&#x27;s layer remains unclear and it appears to have no critical function in corneal physiology. Recently, it is postulated that the layer may act as a physical barrier to protect the subepithelial nerve plexus and thereby hastens epithelial innervation and sensory recovery. Moreover, it may also serve as a barrier that prevents direct traumatic contact with the corneal stroma and hence it is highly involved in stromal wound healing and the associated restoration of anterior corneal transparency at the morphological level.

Part of the Bowman&#x27;s layer is ablated by the photorefractive keratectomy refractive surgery (commonly known as PRK). As the layer is non-generative, the section of the layer ablated in the procedure is lost forever.

== History ==
The Bowman&#x27;s layer is named after Sir William Bowman (1816–1892), an English physician, anatomist and ophthalmologist, who discovered this structure. Bowman&#x27;s layer is not a true basement membrane, despite being originally referred to as such.

<doc id="759385" wikidata="Q3183509" url="?curid=759385" title="Carlton, South Yorkshire">
<text>Carlton is a village in the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley in South Yorkshire, England. It is situated between the villages of Athersley and Royston.
The village is split into two parts, one half in the Monk Bretton ward and the rest in the Royston ward of the Barnsley MBC.
It was built up on coking and coal mining industries and now has one of the largest industrial estates within the surrounding area. In the industrial estate lies a glass recycling plant, called Rexam. To its east stands the Mr Kipling cake factory, owned by Premier Foods. Until 1974 it was in the West Riding of Yorkshire.

Carlton has two Church of England churches and a Methodist chapel, which is now private housing. A Kingdom Hall of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses serves both the Carlton and Athersley congregations.

An ancient sacred spring or holy well existed near to the modern-day Carlton Road and became associated with St Helen in early Christian times. The name St Helen&#x27;s was used for a 20th-century secondary school near the site of the old well, which merged with the original Edward Sheerien School in 1992 (the new Edward Sheerian School merged with Royston High in 2009 to form Carlton Community College). The school is now known as Outwood Academy Carlton, after gaining academy status in 2016 following a report from OFSTED placing the school in special measures.

Carlton has its own village group, www.carltonvillage.co.uk, that is accessible to all villagers. Carlton also has a junior football team called the Bridge Tigers, which has teams ranging from u-7s to u-15s playing at Carlton park.

== History ==
Carlton was formerly a township in the parish of Roystone, in 1866 Carlton became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1938 the parish was abolished and merged with Barnsley and Royston. In 1931 the parish had a population of 2317. It is now in the unparished area of Barnsley.

<doc id="759386" wikidata="Q984249" url="?curid=759386" title="Lundwood">
<text>Lundwood is a village in Barnsley in South Yorkshire, England.

==History==
Lying about three miles east-north-east of Barnsley town centre, Lundwood takes its name from the Lund Wood, the substantially wooded portion of the area of the old manor of Monk Bretton (or Burton). The name Lund is derived from the Old-Norse &quot;Lundr&quot;, meaning woodland, sometimes of sacred woodland, but usually of economically important woods. The name Lundwood is therefore a tautology (meaning Wood wood), a common feature of place-names where two languages are combined as in this case.

The Lund Wood was entirely within the old manor of Monk Bretton. The wood itself was still significant even in the nineteenth century and covered much of the land bounding Cudworth in the east almost down to the River Dearne near Storrs Wood. The ruins of Monk Bretton Priory which was founded in 1154 as the Priory of St Mary Magdalene of Lund by Adam FitzSwaine lie within modern day Lundwood near Cundy Cross. The road from the Priory ran towards the village of Monk Bretton by way of the hamlet of Littleworth. Littleworth is now subsumed within Lundwood but is remembered in the old road which is named Littleworth Lane, and also in the name of the local primary school.

The development of Lundwood as it is seen today was the result of the building of the turnpike road from Barnsley to Cudworth Bridge in 1825. The Act tells us in its preamble that the turnpike followed the old Barnsley to Pontefract road, inferring that the road was established and merely taken over by the turnpike trust. However, section 31 of the Act refers to &quot;the making of this new piece of road&quot; and authorises the trust to stop up &quot;old roads and footways in the township of Monk Bretton, otherwise Burton&quot; because they had become unnecessary and useless. Maps that were made just a relatively short time before, such as Thomas Jefferys (1771–72, Yorkshire), confirm that the road through Lundwood that we see today did not exist, and neither did the road through Beaver&#x27;s Hole, so this &quot;new piece&quot; was quite extensive. The old road ran from Barnsley across the Dearne at Old Mill Lane and then turned east on the Burton Road, passing through Monk Bretton and down to Cudworth at Cudworth Bridge. The route of this new road may well have followed existing footways but nothing large enough to have been recorded on a contemporary map, nor large enough to cope with the intended traffic.

==Amenities==
In its boundaries it features four schools ranging from nursery to comprehensive. Two public houses, the Lundwood WMC and the Lundwood Hotel, known locally as the &quot;club&quot; (still standing) and the &quot;Top Boozer&quot; (Demolished 2011), respectively. It also features several shops selling everything from clothes to takeaway food. In 2009, the local Community Partnership opened Dress 4 Less as an established social enterprise to create funds to assist in community regeneration

==Schools==
Littleworth Grange Primary Learning Centre is currently the only primary school in Lundwood. It was built to merge Grange Gate Junior School and Littleworth Infants School into a larger primary school. The building is located on the site of the infants school which was demolished in 2005.
The only secondary school in Lundwood was Priory School and Sports College. The school was originally built as a junior school but then was transformed into a secondary school after Grange Gate Junior School (Which was being used as Priory School&#x27;s canteen) was built. It has won many awards in the world of sport including cross country and football. As of September 2011, the school has merged with another school in Barnsley, Willowgarth High School, creating Shafton Advanced Learning Centre (now Outwood Academy Shafton). The building was renamed as Shafton A.L.C. Lundwood site, but has since been demolished following the January 2012 move to Shafton.

==Recent events==

The church at Lundwood, St. Mary Magdalene, featured on the 2005 Channel 4 documentary &quot;Priest Idol&quot;, which featured an American priest, Father James McCaskill, as he attempted to get the local population back into the rundown church. This was largely a success as his congregation multiplied fourfold. It received a blow when a fire broke out in the church hall as workmen replaced roof felting. The fire destroyed the roof of the hall and gutted the interior. The damage was estimated at £300,000 by insurers. The remnants of the old hall were demolished to allow for a new building. A new church hall was built in 2012. In 2009, Father James McCaskill decided to take a posting in a parish in Washington D.C. which was also on the verge of closing.

<text>A city-building game, or town-building game, is a genre of simulation video game where players act as the overall planner and leader of a city or town, looking down on it from above, and being responsible for its growth and management strategy. Players choose building placement and city management features such as salaries and work priorities, and the city develops accordingly.

City-building games such as &quot;SimCity&quot;, &quot;Cities XXL&quot; or &quot;&quot; are considered a type of construction and management simulation.

== History ==
The earliest city-building game was &quot;The Sumerian Game&quot; (1964), a text-based mainframe game written by Mabel Addis, based on the ancient Sumerian city of Lagash. It was subsequently adapted into &quot;The Sumer Game&quot; (1968), later known as &quot;Hamurabi&quot;.

The city-building game genre was established in 1989 with &quot;SimCity&quot;, which emphasized continuous building rather than a set victory condition. Players followed personal preferences in design and growth. Indicators of success were maintaining positive budget balance and citizen satisfaction. Subsequent &quot;SimCity&quot; titles such as &quot;SimCity 4&quot; soon followed when high sales of the game demonstrated its popularity.

The first sim game, &quot;Utopia&quot; (1982) developed for the Mattel Intellivision console system, covered many of these same elements, but was limited by the primitive screen resolutions of its era. Unlike the thousands of individual spaces possible a few years later in &quot;SimCity&quot;, each island in &quot;Utopia&quot; held only 29 &quot;buildable&quot; spaces for schools, factories and other constructions. The player&#x27;s score was based on the well-being of his people.

A second boost in the popularity of the genre came in 1993 with the release of various games. Including &quot;The Settlers&quot;, which is set in medieval times and simulates a complex settlement and economic system, which was revolutionary at the time. It started a series that has continued ever since.
In the same year, a blockbuster game which modeled cities in ancient Rome was published: &quot;Caesar&quot;. Subsequent titles in the &quot;City Building Series&quot; followed, all simulating cities in past civilizations. Those games followed the style of &quot;Sim City&quot; over historical accuracy, such as including schools and hospitals, but not slavery. 

The PC game &quot;Stronghold&quot; also appeared in 1993, and was advertised as &quot;&quot;SimCity&quot; meets &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; in 3D&quot;. Elves, humans and dwarves each built neighborhoods with unique architecture within the player&#x27;s town. The title also had elements of real-time strategy games when enemies attacked the city, and the line between city-building and RTS games has often been blurred with this kind of hybrid title. True 3D graphics were not yet possible at that time, so the advertised 3D was actually a clever use of 2D graphics (an isometric projection) with mathematically generated terrain and overlaid bitmaps and sprites.

The &quot;Anno&quot; series started in 1998 and established a high level of detail in graphics as well as an intense economy simulation and a distinct gameplay.

&quot;SimCity 4&quot;, released in 2003, was praised as a standard-setter among city-builders and is still regarded by Matt Smith of Makeuseof.com as one of the best games in the genre, despite its complexity and steep learning curve. Subsequent games in the series attempted to remedy this, such as &quot;SimCity Societies&quot; (2007), which did not further deepen the gameplay along the line of city simulation but incorporates different gameplay elements such as social management. The changes to the formula polarized critics and its fan base alike. The reboot, &quot;SimCity&quot;, released in 2013, attempted to bring the franchise back to its roots but was panned by critics and traditional fans for its forced online requirements, consistent server issues at launch, bugs in the simulation, failure to add promised features and restrictions on city sizes, all of which ultimately led to the discontinuation of SimCity as a franchise. The waning dominance of the &quot;SimCity&quot; franchise in the genre caused several other companies to release similarly themed games, like &quot;Cities XL&quot; (2009). The game &quot;&quot; published in 2015 and was very successful with the audience of the genre and was followed up by a sequel, &quot;&quot;, which released in October 2023.

Starting with &quot;Anno 2070&quot; in 2011, continued by &quot;Anno 2205&quot; in 2015, and emphasized by &quot;Surviving Mars&quot; and &quot;Frostpunk&quot; in 2018, futurist settings became again widely popular with the audience of the genre.

With the rise of social gaming, mobile gaming, freemium and micropayment model in the 2010s, there has been a surge of casual city-building games with different mechanisms like time-based &quot;produce and upgrade&quot; feature, including &quot;CityVille&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;City Island&quot;. Although most traditional followers of the genre dislike these games due to factors like simple, dumbed-down mechanics and microtransactions, they have gained greater commercial success around the world than most prior city building games.

<text>Cawthorne is a village and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England. The village was once a centre of the iron and coal mining industry; today it is part of an affluent commuter belt west of Barnsley. At the 2001 census it had a population of 1,108, increasing to 1,151 at the 2011 Census.

The village pub, the Spencer Arms, is named after the Spencer-Stanhope family, who once owned large swathes of the local area. Their home was Cannon Hall, the park of which borders the village.

Two earlier residences in Cawthorne were Barnby Hall, home of the Barnby family, and Banks Hall, the seat of the Misses Spencer-Stanhope and of a branch of the Greene family.

Cawthorne is frequented by ramblers as many walking routes start from the village.

The Victoria Jubilee Museum, built to commemorate Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, was opened in 1889 and contains numerous unusual exhibits including a stuffed cheetah and a two-headed lamb.

All Saints&#x27; Church overlooks the village, and there is a Methodist church on Darton Road. All Saints contains memorials to the Barnby and Spencer families.

In the heart of the village stands Malt Kiln Row, originally the malt kiln for Cannon Hall. 

Kate Rusby, English folk singer-songwriter, lives in the village with her husband and two children.

<text>Cubley is a village in the metropolitan borough of Barnsley in South Yorkshire, England. It is about a mile to the south of Penistone town centre and essentially is now a part of Penistone. The village falls within the Penistone West ward of Barnsley MBC.

Originally Cubley consisted of the few houses now on the south edge of the village and the associated nearby farms and Cubley Hall (initially a farm and country residence, then a children&#x27;s home and now a pub, restaurant and hotel). Now due to extensive building in the 20th and early 21st Centuries these old cottages are now connected right up to Penistone town itself.

Cubley currently has no shops or other services (other than Cubley Hall) serving the village and people have to walk (or catch the bus) for the mile or so trip into Penistone town centre for their basic shopping.

Cubley has no schools, with most children going to St John the Baptist Infant and Junior Schools in Penistone and then on to Penistone Grammar School.

== History ==
Before the 20th century Cubley was little more than a collection of cottages, a few farms and Cubley Hall. The cottages that made up Cubley are now referred to as &#x27;Old Cubley&#x27; and lie at the southern edge of Cubley, furthest from Penistone. During the first 30 years of the 20th century, a number of houses were built along the main road from Penistone. Sporadically this house building continued throughout the 20th century.

The vinegar brewery used to sit at Cubley Brook at the bottom of the big dip in the road from Penistone. This closed in the 1960s or 1970s. The land was mostly converted into houses during the 1980s.

Before the 1960s there was a shop, which was part of a large house on Mortimer Road, adjacent to where Hackings Avenue forked away from Mortimer Road. This was run by a Miss Credland. From the 1960s a bungalow on Mortimer Road (just before Cubley Hall on the road from Penistone) had its garage converted into a shop. This was the only shop in Cubley. Some point before the early 1990s this shop closed and left Cubley totally reliant on the shops in Penistone.

During the 1990s an attempt was made to build on the land between Cubley and old Cubley. This failed when the company funding the project went bankrupt. This left two half built buildings.

Around the turn of the Millennium or possible a few years either side the last large building project in Cubley happened - the construction of a new housing estate to the south of the houses in Cubley. This finally joined up the cottages of old Cubley with a continuous line of development right into Penistone town.

<doc id="759396" wikidata="Q954528" url="?curid=759396" title="Cudworth, South Yorkshire">
<text>Cudworth ( ) is a village in the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley in South Yorkshire, England. It had a population of 10,977 in the 2011 Census.

The modern village is part of the Cudworth ward of Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council and has a mix of housing types with a great many developments from the inter-war and post-war periods. These supplement a small residual number of more ancient dwellings and buildings reflecting the importance of the rural economy before the opening of the deep mine collieries in the near vicinity at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries. 

The village is still surrounded by open space, including green belt, regenerated public open spaces that were formerly part of neighbouring collieries and the remaining agricultural land which still dominates the south and south-east sides of the village. Cudworth has two distinct historic centres known as Upper or Over Cudworth and Low or Nether Cudworth.

==Governance==
Since the local government reforms of 1974 Cudworth has been a ward within the Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council and returns three ward councillors. This same Act saw the establishment of the South Yorkshire metropolitan county, but its council was later abolished and the four constituent boroughs became unitary authorities.

Before the establishment of the Poor Law Union, almost every aspect of local governance had been shared between three authorities; the Justices of the Peace for the West Riding in their Quarter or Special sessions; the Parish of Royston and its Vestry, and the Manor of Cudworth with its Court Baron and Court Leet.

In the period before 1900, Cudworth&#x27;s governance passed through a number of changes introduced by the Government at Westminster due to the increasing population. The 1873 and 1875 Public Health Acts created Rural Sanitary Districts which effectively gave control of the sewers and other health matters to the local board of Guardians, who had hitherto been responsible for the workhouse and other matters relating to the Poor Laws. The Barnsley Rural Sanitary District which included most of the Barnsley Poor Law Union of which Cudworth was a part was abolished under the 1894 Local Government Act when the Barnsley Rural District Council with elected councillors took over the responsibilities previously administered by the Poor Law Guardians. The new Barnsley Rural District very quickly began to lose territory as the rapid population expansion due to the opening of the deep mine collieries created the need for the urban district councils to act as the first tier of the local authority. Cudworth was the third of the eight civil parishes within Barnsley RDC to leave when the UDC was established in 1900.

Cudworth Urban District existed between 1900 and the 1974 reforms. It had an urban district council as the second tier local authority under the West Riding County Council. The Cudworth Urban District Council was responsible for a great many changes within its boundaries including the development of a number of housing estates, including the Newtown and Birkwood estates and the much later Crown estate. In order to build the Newtown Estate it was necessary to demolish the old Manor House which previously stood on the site occupied by the houses on Lunn Road bearing the inscription commemorating the new estate in 1922.

==Transport==
A railway station served between 1840 and 1968. Regular bus services serve the village including service 28 to Barnsley. Most bus routes are operated by Stagecoach Yorkshire.

==Churches and places of worship==

Cudworth was a township and a constituent part of the large rural Anglican parish of Royston until it became part of Monk Bretton chapelry in 1843; it finally became a separate Anglican chapelry in 1893. The District Chapelries of both Monk Bretton and Cudworth later became parishes quite independent of Royston. The church dedicated to St John the Baptist was consecrated before the official commencement of the chapelry district in succession to a chapel of ease previously occupying the buildings of the charity school near the pond. St John&#x27;s is situated on the High Royd, the highest part of Low Cudworth. The parish was established finally by 10 November 1893, when the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of the Church of England made a double announcement of the vicarage and curacy, with a stipend based upon two benefactions made to the Church. The Commissioners received the benefaction and promised to pay a stipend of £15 per annum and £120 per annum from it. They also set out their rights to any tithe in recompense.
The Commissioners received a further benefaction, and agreed to defray the costs of the building of a parsonage in a decision dated 5 April 1900.

In 1920, a war memorial was erected in the churchyard to commemorate the servicemen of Cudworth who died in World War I; the men and women lost in World War II were added later. The Local Heritage Group organised for the memorial to be refurbished at which time more names were added, including those fallen in more recent conflicts.

St John the Baptist Cudworth is ordinarily a part of the deanery of Barnsley, Archdeaconry of Pontefract, Diocese of Wakefield and Province of York. The parish has petitioned for pastoral care by a bishop who is not a supporter of the ordination of women, currently therefore the parish is in the care of the Bishop of Pontefract, suffragan in the diocese of Wakefield.

The Roman Catholic church of St Mary Magdelene in Prospect Street was also erected to serve the growing population of miners, railway and other workers who arrived after 1890. This church is within the Deanery of Barnsley and Bishopric of Hallam and Province of Liverpool.

The Methodist traditions have been strong in Cudworth since Charles and John Wesley first set out on their circuits, especially on the Sheffield circuit. The village was the birthplace of John Smith in January 1794, his parents lived in Low Cudworth. His father, William or &quot;Billy&quot; was a tailor and lay preacher. John was not an adherent of his father&#x27;s Methodist ideas; he was reputed to have attended a prize-fight in Barnsley and was returning with his drinking companions to Cudworth when he had a Damascene moment. He was sent for training as a Methodist minister and became successful earning the epithet of &quot;The Revivalist&quot; and a global reputation. There are many anecdotal references to John and Charles Wesley preaching on steps alongside White Cross Road and of Charles Wesley sleeping overnight in a cottage that still stands near the slip road for Low Cudworth Green. The original Methodist chapel was on the side of the High Royd facing White Cross Road above what is today Quarry Vale.

<doc id="759415" wikidata="Q5367508" url="?curid=759415" title="Elsecar">
<text>Elsecar (, ) is a village in the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley in South Yorkshire, England. It is near to Jump and Wentworth, it is also south of Hoyland, south of Barnsley and north-east of Sheffield. Elsecar falls within the Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Ward of Hoyland Milton.

Elsecar is unique as a name. It is thought to derive from the Old English personal name of &quot;Aelfsige&quot; (mentioned in Cartulary of Nostell Priory, 1259–66) and the Old Norse word kjarr, denoting a marsh or brushwood.

From the late 18th century, Elsecar was transformed into an &#x27;industrial estate village&#x27; for nearby Wentworth Woodhouse, with multiple collieries and two major ironworks. It is seen as one of the UK&#x27;s first model villages and a precursor to Saltaire.

A 1795 Newcomen steam engine at the Elsecar New Colliery is the oldest steam engine still in situ, anywhere in the world.

The village now attracts over 500,000 visitors each year, to its heritage centre, historic sites and award-winning park.

==History==
In 1870–72, John Marius Wilson&#x27;s Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described Elsecar as having a population of 1912 and 353 dwelling places.

The village had developed rapidly since a century before, when it had been just a handful of cottages around a village green and a scattering of shallow coal pits, in a valley alongside an ancient stream.

===An Industrial Estate Village===
Elsecar&#x27;s development from the late 18th century can be seen as a microcosm of the whole Industrial Revolution in Britain. The village was nothing more than a series of farms until the 18th century. Although coal had been mined in the area since the 14th century, the first major colliery, Elsecar Old, was not sunk until 1750. It was taken on by the Marquis of Rockingham in 1752, later consolidated onto a hilltop to the west of the village and is thought to have been painted by George Stubbs, around the same time he painted Whistle Jacket.

The village was transformed from the 1790s at the direction of the 4th Earl Fitzwilliam of Wentworth Woodhouse, with the sinking of its first deep colliery, the cutting of a canal, the building of two ironworks and associated housing designed by architect John Carr of York. As a result, Elsecar is now recognised to be one of the first model villages in the UK and a precursor to historic places such as Saltaire.

The subsequent development and expansion of the village continued to be closely overseen by the Fitzwilliam dynasty. Uniquely in Europe, Elsecar is understood to have been an &#x27;industrial estate village&#x27;, built and operated in addition to the family&#x27;s traditional aristocratic estate village of Wentworth.

Additions to the village instructed by the Earls in the mid 19th century included rows of miners and ironworkers&#x27; cottages, a miners lodging house, church, indoor market, coaching inn, school, cricket club and architecturally impressive workshops, known as the New Yard. A private railway station for the Earl, including a waiting room for privileged and Royal guests, was added in 1870 and now serves as a nursery for local children.

=== The Elsecar Collieries ===

The Earls oversaw expansion of deep coalmining and sinking of new collieries for over a century and maintained a direct controlling interest in the management of the village&#x27;s collieries until nationalisation in 1947.

In 1794-5, the village&#x27;s first deep colliery was sunk, a few metres to the east of the village&#x27;s proposed canal basin. Over the following years, Elsecar New Colliery was expanded and the original Elsecar (Old) Colliery modernised. In the 1840s and 1850s, two state-of-the-art collieries were sunk, Simon Wood and Elsecar Low (later renamed Hemingfield). The latter survives, has been rescued and is now in community ownership.

In 1851, Queen Victoria was taken outside the Great Exhibition, to see a column of Barnsley Seam coal which had been somehow mined intact by Elsecar miners and taken to London.

The last colliery to open was Elsecar Main in 1908. King George V went underground there in 1912, for which he received respect and recognition, as news had come through that morning of a terrible disaster at Cadeby Colliery. King George was not the first Royal to go underground in the UK, as he acknowledged during his visit. King William IV, when Duke of Clarence, had been taken into Elsecar Old Colliery in 1828.

Elsecar Main Colliery was closed in October 1983. Many Elsecar colliers went to work at Cortonwood, just down the canal towpath, where a few months later the Miners Strike of 1984-5 began. Elsecar Workshops were sold off by British Coal soon after, ending the village&#x27;s ties to the coal industry.

In the following years, the village suffered from severe economic and social problems, as did all the mining villages in the region. The mid-1990s saw the repurposing of the former colliery workshops into a new visitor destination, Elsecar Heritage Centre.

=== The Elsecar Newcomen Engine ===
During the sinking of the Elsecar New Colliery in 1795, Earl Fitzwilliam had a large atmospheric beam engine installed to pump water from deep underground.

It is of the type invented by Thomas Newcomen in 1712. Newcomen invented the world&#x27;s first practical steam engine, creating mechanical power using steam for the first time. Newcomen&#x27;s genius was to use the force of atmospheric pressure acting on a piston at the top of a steam-filled cylinder, into which water had been injected to create a vacuum, to move the piston and a beam attached to it.

James Watt made the steam engine far more efficient half a century later, but by that time Newcomen engines were widely established and powering industry across the UK and further afield.

Now a Scheduled Ancient Monument, the Elsecar Newcomen is understood to be the oldest steam engine in the world still in situ where it was originally built.

The engine pumped water from the colliery workings from 1795 to 1923. In 1928, Henry Ford visited Elsecar and tried to purchase the engine to take it back to his new museum in America. His request was refused by Earl Fitzwilliam.

In 2014, a major project was completed to rescue and conserve the engine, supported by Barnsley Council, the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Historic England. It now runs on hydraulics with regular open days from Easter to October each year when visitors can also look down the New Colliery mineshafts.

=== The Elsecar &amp; Milton Ironworks ===
John and William Darwin &amp; Co. of Sheffield opened the first furnace at Elsecar Ironworks (at the bottom of Forge Lane) in 1795. In 1799 another ironworks was founded at Milton, by the Walker Brothers of Rotherham, less than a mile to the west of Elsecar, on a hilltop in full view of the village of Wentworth just across the valley.

The Earls maintained a close involvement in the village&#x27;s two ironworks. Although leased to a series of major ironmasters from their establishment in the 1790s to closure in the 1880s. the ironworks were at times managed direct as part of the Wentworth Woodhouse estate. In the second half of the 19th century, both ironworks were leased and operated together by famous ironmakers the Dawes Brothers, originally from West Bromwich.

In 1838 a horse-drawn tramroad was constructed to link the Dearne and Dove Canal with the Milton Ironworks, Tankersley Park ironstone mines, Lidgett Colliery and the Thorncliffe Ironworks at Chapeltown. Stationary engines were used for the incline sections, and remained in operation until about 1880.
The two Elsecar Ironworks are credited with a variety of major achievements, including making iron for John Rennie&#x27;s bridge over the Thames at Southwark which opened in 1819, bridges designed for the Isle de Bourbon (now Reunion) by Marc Isambard Brunel, the steam engine at Leawood on the Cromford Canal, iron with which armour plate was rolled for HMS Warrior and replacement bridges for Sheffield when the city&#x27;s bridges were destroyed in the Great Sheffield Flood of 1864.Two smaller family-run forges were also established in the mid 19th century and survived well into the 20th century, including the Davey Brothers foundry, whose drain and manhole covers can still be seen across the village.

The two main Elsecar ironworks were closed in the 1880s.

The Milton Ironworks was on the site of what is now the Forge Playing Field. Remains include what&#x27;s left of the blast wall, a bank running across the field, and furnace ponds by The Furnace pub.

The Elsecar ironworks is once of the best surviving industrial complexes from the mid-19th century. After the ironworks was closed in the 1880s, its buildings were integrated into the colliery workshops and the ironworks largely forgotten until very recently.

A Scheduled Ancient Monument as of 2018, the casting shed, rolling mill, workshop, entrance arch and offices have survived intact. The impressive blast wall, blowing engine house, waggon ways, ironworks reservoir and charging plateau have survived in ruinous form and plans are being made for their future conservation.

=== The Elsecar Valley ===
The landscape around the village has extensive archaeological remains and historic sites, which can be explored on organised guided tours.

They include ironworks ruins and ponds, furnace charging plateau, collieries, bell pits, footrills, mineshafts, waggon ways, the industrial canal and reservoir, canal basins, early-Victorian railway, clinker-reinforced trackways, lime kiln sites, coking furnaces and much else.

Built heritage that survives in the village is similarly extensive, including miners and ironworkers housing, historic pubs, cricket club, parsonage, vicarage, toll house, miners lodging house, the Milton Hall exhibition hall, the church, steam mill, two schools, and the extensive buildings of the New Yard workshops and Elsecar Ironworks.

=== Elsecar-by-the-Sea ===
In 1910 a local amateur photographer, Herbert Parkin, took photographs of families paddling in the local reservoir and sent them into the &quot;Sheffield Star&quot; with the caption Elsecar-by-the-Sea.

The name caught on and with the help of a good transport link from Sheffield via the local railway station, a thriving tourism business was established.

Between the wars, Hoyland Nether Urban District Council created a public park to take advantage of the influx of visitors, on land granted by Earl Fitzwilliam, adding a boating jetty to the reservoir, a pavilion cafe and bandstands. The village flourished as &#x27;the seaside resort at the heart of the Yorkshire coalfield&#x27;.

Since 2008, the name Elsecar-by-the-Sea has been used for the village gala, which takes place in the park each September.

=== The Elsecar Heritage Action Zone ===
In March 2017 Elsecar was designated as one of ten Heritage Action Zones (HAZ) by Historic England with the benefit that the area would receive a share of £6 million.

As part of the HAZ project, in 2019 a Historic Area Assessment was developed, &quot;intended to illustrate the varied character and significance of the village and its setting in order to inform interpretation, conservation and development under the direction of revised planning guidance&quot;.

To inform this, there was an extensive programme of historical research, archaeology, architectural investigation and community involvement.

Of particular note, two major community digs, planned and carried out involving dozens of volunteers, took place on the Milton Ironworks and the New Colliery boiler house. In 2017 Caesium magnetometer, Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Earth Resistance Tomography (ERT) surveys were conducted at Elsecar to attempt to determine the location of a number of former industrial buildings.

A major legacy of the Elsecar Heritage Action Zone was the creation of two new Scheduled Ancient Monuments at Hemingfield Colliery and the Elsecar Ironworks, the extension of the village conservation areas and extensive listings, creating many new Grade II* listed buildings.

==Attractions==

Elsecar Heritage Centre is a visitor attraction based in the former New Yard colliery workshops. Operated by Barnsley Museums, it has independent shops, studios, galleries, cafes and a large antiques centre.

A visitor centre and regular tours share the unique history of the village, and includes a highly detailed digital reconstruction of the village and valley as it was in the 1880.

The former rolling mill of the Elsecar Ironworks is now a major event space, with standing capacity of up to 1000 people.

Elsecar Park has a bandstand, children&#x27;s playground, a cafe, and a pitch and putt golf course. The reservoir, now a local nature reserve, is adjacent to the upper park.

The landscape and valley have extensive archaeological remains, but many are on private land or in dangerous locations. It is recommended that all visitors keep to public rights of way or take organised tours.

==Transport==
Elsecar has its own railway station on the Hallam and Penistone lines so it is possible to make direct journeys to Barnsley, Sheffield, Leeds, Huddersfield, and Wakefield. Buses run to and from Barnsley, Rotherham and Sheffield.

Elsecar Junction was located on the Woodhead Line, some distance from Elsecar, close to the Wath marshalling yard. The line including the marshalling yard closed in 1988.

Elsecar Heritage Railway was based next to the heritage centre. It ran a pleasure service between Rockingham Station, a replica station built in the 1990s in the centre of the Elsecar Ironworks, and Hemingfield Canal Basin, although passengers could not alight at Hemingfield Basin.

The charitable trust which operated the railway ceased operating the line at the start of the COVID pandemic and in July 2020 handed their lease back to the local Council. The Council has released statements that it hopes to create a sustainable future for a new heritage railway attraction in the village.

In 1793 An Act of Parliament authorised the making of the Dearne and Dove Canal between Swinton and Barnsley, with two branches, one to Worsbrough and another to Elsecar at a location then known as Cobcar .

The canal was later extended into the centre of village, next to the New Colliery and Elsecar Ironworks, and was fully opened in 1798. The upper stretch of the canal was restored in the 1990s. Its towpath is now part of the Trans Pennine Trail and has recently been restored and widened with funding from the South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority.

==Sport==
The village has its own cricket club, established in 1854, which plays in the South Yorkshire Cricket League. It also has several junior teams that play in the Barnsley &amp; District Junior Cricket Association.

It was represented in the FA Cup by Elsecar Main F.C. in the 1900s.

==Notable people==
* George Utley, football player, was born in Reform Row in Elsecar.
*Bobby Knutt, comedian and entertainer, lived in Elsecar for several years.
*Laban Solomon (d. 1903), hymn composer and a favourite of Queen Victoria, lived on Church Street and is buried in Elsecar churchyard beneath a kneeling angel.

<doc id="759417" wikidata="Q2104895" url="?curid=759417" title="Ingbirchworth">
<text>Ingbirchworth is a village in the civil parish of Gunthwaite and Ingbirchworth in the Barnsley district of South Yorkshire, England. It is close to the boundary with Kirklees in West Yorkshire. At the 2001 Census, the parish population was 400, and it increased to 460 at the 2011 Census, and is now estimated to be around 600.
The village is notable for its reservoir, the oldest of the three situated in the area (the others being Royd Moor and Scout Dike). During extreme droughts in the summer the reservoir has dried up to the extent that the old bridge over the original stream, Summer Ford Bridge, can be seen. Development is mostly laid out along two roads: older houses and farms along the former turnpike, Huddersfield Road, the A629 and newer housing estates along Wellthorne Lane. It has one public house, the Fountain Inn, which reopened in 2021 having been saved from demolition. There is an agricultural suppliers and hardware shop on the edge of the village on Huddersfield Road.

The Grange is the oldest extant building in the village, dating to 1624. This and a number of other properties in the older part of the village are Grade II listed.

==Recent changes==
The Rose And Crown public house was demolished in 2006 and its site was redeveloped for housing. The Methodist church was sold in 2014 and has been converted to dwellings. On 6 November 2015, a new war memorial was dedicated on a site on Wellthorne Avenue. This is the first permanent memorial of its type in the village. The village shop closed in 2016 but a handful of &quot;honesty box&quot; local producers have opened up in the last couple of years.

== Governance ==
Ingbirchworth was a township in the ancient parish of Penistone. Ingbirchworth was a civil parish from 1866 until 1 April 1938 when the parish was abolished and merged with Gunthwaite to form &quot;Gunthwaite and Ingbirchworth&quot;. In 1931 the parish had a population of 274.

<doc id="759421" wikidata="Q3425495" url="?curid=759421" title="Jump, South Yorkshire">
<text>Jump is a village in the metropolitan borough of Barnsley in South Yorkshire, England.
It is north-east of Hoyland, separated from it by the Jump Valley, through which a stream runs. According to local legend, Jump village was named by the local coal miners having to &#x27;jump&#x27; over the stream to go to work.

Until 1974, Jump was part of the Wombwell Urban District, in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Jump came under the Hoyland Nether STD dialling code area 022674 until 1980.

==History==
Flints from the late Mesolithic have been found in the Roebuck Hill area, along with Neolithic and Bronze Age material. No evidence of permanent settlement has been found from these periods. Pre-Roman Iron Age settlement of the area is known of because of post-holes, indicating the presence of a late-Iron Age roundhouse. A locally made beehive quern is one of many artefacts found at the site. Later Post-Medieval use of the site shows the construction of a kiln, possibly used to produce iron.

==Amenities==

The parish church is St George&#x27;s, in the Diocese of Sheffield.

Jump has a Working Mens Club and a small selection of pubs:
*The Flying Dutchman
*The Coach And Horses 
*The Wellington Inn

Also, the village hosts a traditional Fish and Chip shop, a butcher, a hairdresser, a convenience store and a Post Office. Recently opening in the village is a Sure Start nursery school, which is in the centre of the village. The village also has a local school for young children, Jump Primary School.

==Sport==

Two football teams from the village have competed in the FA Cup: Jump Working Mens Club F.C. (season 1920–21) and Jump Home Guard F.C. (during 1949–51).

==Transport==
The village is accessible by public transport via two bus routes, the 66 (one way), which runs approximately every ten minutes and the Jump Circular 67, which runs in both directions every hour. The nearest railway station is just a short walk up the hill in Elsecar.

<doc id="759422" wikidata="Q367664" url="?curid=759422" title="Data modeling">
<text>Data modeling in software engineering is the process of creating a data model for an information system by applying certain formal techniques. It may be applied as part of broader Model-driven engineering (MDE) concept.

== Overview ==
Data modeling is a process used to define and analyze data requirements needed to support the business processes within the scope of corresponding information systems in organizations. Therefore, the process of data modeling involves professional data modelers working closely with business stakeholders, as well as potential users of the information system.

There are three different types of data models produced while progressing from requirements to the actual database to be used for the information system. The data requirements are initially recorded as a conceptual data model which is essentially a set of technology independent specifications about the data and is used to discuss initial requirements with the business stakeholders. The conceptual model is then translated into a logical data model, which documents structures of the data that can be implemented in databases. Implementation of one conceptual data model may require multiple logical data models. The last step in data modeling is transforming the logical data model to a physical data model that organizes the data into tables, and accounts for access, performance and storage details. Data modeling defines not just data elements, but also their structures and the relationships between them.

Data modeling techniques and methodologies are used to model data in a standard, consistent, predictable manner in order to manage it as a resource. The use of data modeling standards is strongly recommended for all projects requiring a standard means of defining and analyzing data within an organization, e.g., using data modeling:

* to assist business analysts, programmers, testers, manual writers, IT package selectors, engineers, managers, related organizations and clients to understand and use an agreed upon semi-formal model that encompasses the concepts of the organization and how they relate to one another
* to manage data as a resource
* to integrate information systems
* to design databases/data warehouses (aka data repositories)

Data modeling may be performed during various types of projects and in multiple phases of projects. Data models are progressive; there is no such thing as the final data model for a business or application. Instead a data model should be considered a living document that will change in response to a changing business. The data models should ideally be stored in a repository so that they can be retrieved, expanded, and edited over time. Whitten et al. (2004) determined two types of data modeling: 
* Strategic data modeling: This is part of the creation of an information systems strategy, which defines an overall vision and architecture for information systems. Information technology engineering is a methodology that embraces this approach.
* Data modeling during systems analysis: In systems analysis logical data models are created as part of the development of new databases.

Data modeling is also used as a technique for detailing business requirements for specific databases. It is sometimes called &quot;database modeling&quot; because a data model is eventually implemented in a database.

== Topics ==

=== Data models ===
Data models provide a framework for data to be used within information systems by providing specific definitions and formats. If a data model is used consistently across systems then compatibility of data can be achieved. If the same data structures are used to store and access data then different applications can share data seamlessly. The results of this are indicated in the diagram. However, systems and interfaces are often expensive to build, operate, and maintain. They may also constrain the business rather than support it. This may occur when the quality of the data models implemented in systems and interfaces is poor.

Some common problems found in data models are:
* Business rules, specific to how things are done in a particular place, are often fixed in the structure of a data model. This means that small changes in the way business is conducted lead to large changes in computer systems and interfaces. So, business rules need to be implemented in a flexible way that does not result in complicated dependencies, rather the data model should be flexible enough so that changes in the business can be implemented within the data model in a relatively quick and efficient way.
* Entity types are often not identified, or are identified incorrectly. This can lead to replication of data, data structure and functionality, together with the attendant costs of that duplication in development and maintenance. Therefore, data definitions should be made as explicit and easy to understand as possible to minimize misinterpretation and duplication.
* Data models for different systems are arbitrarily different. The result of this is that complex interfaces are required between systems that share data. These interfaces can account for between 25 and 70% of the cost of current systems. Required interfaces should be considered inherently while designing a data model, as a data model on its own would not be usable without interfaces within different systems.
* Data cannot be shared electronically with customers and suppliers, because the structure and meaning of data have not been standardised. To obtain optimal value from an implemented data model, it is very important to define standards that will ensure that data models will both meet business needs and be consistent.

=== Conceptual, logical and physical schemas ===
In 1975 ANSI described three kinds of data-model &quot;instance&quot;:

* Conceptual schema: describes the semantics of a domain (the scope of the model). For example, it may be a model of the interest area of an organization or of an industry. This consists of entity classes, representing kinds of things of significance in the domain, and relationships assertions about associations between pairs of entity classes. A conceptual schema specifies the kinds of facts or propositions that can be expressed using the model. In that sense, it defines the allowed expressions in an artificial &quot;language&quot; with a scope that is limited by the scope of the model. Simply described, a conceptual schema is the first step in organizing the data requirements.
* Logical schema: describes the structure of some domain of information. This consists of descriptions of (for example) tables, columns, object-oriented classes, and XML tags. The logical schema and conceptual schema are sometimes implemented as one and the same.
* Physical schema: describes the physical means used to store data. This is concerned with partitions, CPUs, tablespaces, and the like.

According to ANSI, this approach allows the three perspectives to be relatively independent of each other. Storage technology can change without affecting either the logical or the conceptual schema. The table/column structure can change without (necessarily) affecting the conceptual schema. In each case, of course, the structures must remain consistent across all schemas of the same data model.

=== Data modeling process ===

In the context of business process integration (see figure), data modeling complements business process modeling, and ultimately results in database generation.

The process of designing a database involves producing the previously described three types of schemas – conceptual, logical, and physical. The database design documented in these schemas is converted through a Data Definition Language, which can then be used to generate a database. A fully attributed data model contains detailed attributes (descriptions) for every entity within it. The term &quot;database design&quot; can describe many different parts of the design of an overall database system. Principally, and most correctly, it can be thought of as the logical design of the base data structures used to store the data. In the relational model these are the tables and views. In an object database the entities and relationships map directly to object classes and named relationships. However, the term &quot;database design&quot; could also be used to apply to the overall process of designing, not just the base data structures, but also the forms and queries used as part of the overall database application within the Database Management System or DBMS.

In the process, system interfaces account for 25% to 70% of the development and support costs of current systems. The primary reason for this cost is that these systems do not share a common data model. If data models are developed on a system by system basis, then not only is the same analysis repeated in overlapping areas, but further analysis must be performed to create the interfaces between them. Most systems within an organization contain the same basic data, redeveloped for a specific purpose. Therefore, an efficiently designed basic data model can minimize rework with minimal modifications for the purposes of different systems within the organization

=== Modeling methodologies ===
Data models represent information areas of interest. While there are many ways to create data models, according to Len Silverston (1997) only two modeling methodologies stand out, top-down and bottom-up: 
* Bottom-up models or View Integration models are often the result of a reengineering effort. They usually start with existing data structures forms, fields on application screens, or reports. These models are usually physical, application-specific, and incomplete from an enterprise perspective. They may not promote data sharing, especially if they are built without reference to other parts of the organization.
* Top-down logical data models, on the other hand, are created in an abstract way by getting information from people who know the subject area. A system may not implement all the entities in a logical model, but the model serves as a reference point or template.
Sometimes models are created in a mixture of the two methods: by considering the data needs and structure of an application and by consistently referencing a subject-area model. In many environments the distinction between a logical data model and a physical data model is blurred. In addition, some CASE tools don&#x27;t make a distinction between logical and physical data models.

=== Entity–relationship diagrams ===
There are several notations for data modeling. The actual model is frequently called &quot;entity–relationship model&quot;, because it depicts data in terms of the entities and relationships described in the data. An entity–relationship model (ERM) is an abstract conceptual representation of structured data. Entity–relationship modeling is a relational schema database modeling method, used in software engineering to produce a type of conceptual data model (or semantic data model) of a system, often a relational database, and its requirements in a top-down fashion.

These models are being used in the first stage of information system design during the requirements analysis to describe information needs or the type of information that is to be stored in a database. The data modeling technique can be used to describe any ontology (i.e. an overview and classifications of used terms and their relationships) for a certain universe of discourse i.e. area of interest.

Several techniques have been developed for the design of data models. While these methodologies guide data modelers in their work, two different people using the same methodology will often come up with very different results. Most notable are:

* Bachman diagrams
* Barker&#x27;s notation
* Chen&#x27;s notation
* Data Vault Modeling
* Extended Backus–Naur form
* IDEF1X
* Object-relational mapping
* Object-Role Modeling and Fully Communication Oriented Information Modeling
* Relational Model
* Relational Model/Tasmania

=== Generic data modeling ===
Generic data models are generalizations of conventional data models. They define standardized general relation types, together with the kinds of things that may be related by such a relation type. 
The definition of generic data model is similar to the definition of a natural language. For example, a generic data model may define relation types such as a &#x27;classification relation&#x27;, being a binary relation between an individual thing and a kind of thing (a class) and a &#x27;part-whole relation&#x27;, being a binary relation between two things, one with the role of part, the other with the role of whole, regardless the kind of things that are related.

Given an extensible list of classes, this allows the classification of any individual thing and to specify part-whole relations for any individual object. By standardization of an extensible list of relation types, a generic data model enables the expression of an unlimited number of kinds of facts and will approach the capabilities of natural languages. Conventional data models, on the other hand, have a fixed and limited domain scope, because the instantiation (usage) of such a model only allows expressions of kinds of facts that are predefined in the model.

=== Semantic data modeling ===

The logical data structure of a DBMS, whether hierarchical, network, or relational, cannot totally satisfy the requirements for a conceptual definition of data because it is limited in scope and biased toward the implementation strategy employed by the DBMS. That is unless the semantic data model is implemented in the database on purpose, a choice which may slightly impact performance but generally vastly improves productivity.

Therefore, the need to define data from a conceptual view has led to the development of semantic data modeling techniques. That is, techniques to define the meaning of data within the context of its interrelationships with other data. As illustrated in the figure the real world, in terms of resources, ideas, events, etc., is symbolically defined by its description within physical data stores. A semantic data model is an abstraction which defines how the stored symbols relate to the real world. Thus, the model must be a true representation of the real world.

The purpose of semantic data modeling is to create a structural model of a piece of the real world, called &quot;universe of discourse&quot;. For this, three fundamental structural relations are considered:
* Classification/instantiation: Objects with some structural similarity are described as instances of classes
* Aggregation/decomposition: Composed objects are obtained joining its parts
* Generalization/specialization: Distinct classes with some common properties are reconsidered in a more generic class with the common attributes

A semantic data model can be used to serve many purposes, such as:
* Planning of data resources
* Building of shareable databases
* Evaluation of vendor software
* Integration of existing databases

The overall goal of semantic data models is to capture more meaning of data by integrating relational concepts with more powerful abstraction concepts known from the artificial intelligence field. The idea is to provide high level modeling primitives as integral part of a data model in order to facilitate the representation of real world situations.

<text>Monk Bretton is a village in the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley in South Yorkshire, England. It lies approximately two miles north-east from Barnsley town centre. Until 1974 it was in the West Riding of Yorkshire.

==History==
Monk Bretton has been a settlement since medieval times and was originally known as just &#x27;Bretton&#x27;. It is sometimes thought to have taken its name from the twelfth-century Adam fitz Swain de Bretton, whose family owned much land in the area and who also founded Monk Bretton Priory. However, in the Domesday Book of 1086 the area is already known as Brettone, and the name may have originally meant &#x27;Farmstead of the Britons&#x27;, suggesting that a remnant of the old Romano-British population may have lived here into the Anglo-Saxon period. According to Domesday Book, the local Saxon lord in 1066 had been an individual called Wulfmer, who by 1086 had been replaced by a Norman lord, Illbert de Lacey, a major landholder associated with many other locations in the county. By 1225 the village was referred to as Munkebretton, ‘munke’ referring to the monks of the nearby Priory.

In 1444, Sir William de Bretton gave to Thomas Haryngton, esquire, and other trustees, lands and tenements in Monk Bretton, which his father and grandfather had leased to the prior and convent for a term of years.

The mediaeval village cross, today known as the ‘Butter Cross’, still survives, standing at the junction of High Street and Cross Street. This precious monument had the go ahead for a traffic island to protect it in 2011. The scheme, costing £106,000 also saw the road junction widened for buses and other large vehicles to pass on the correct side of the road rather than the opposite as in previous years. The cross may have had a social as well as a religious function, a place to meet and hear news. The village park also shows traces of mediaeval ridge and furrow cultivation.

The Manor of Wakefield Act 1609 (7 Jas. 1. c. &quot;1&quot;) gave all freeholders of Monk Bretton manorial rights and, since it was not repealed, technically everyone who owns freehold property or land is a &#x27;lord&#x27; of the manor.

On Burton Bank is a Quaker burial ground dating from the 1650s. The land was donated by a local benefactor, George Ellis, and the first recorded burial on the site took place in 1657. Later a small meeting house was erected, which became a focus for local Quakers up until the 19th century. An almshouse was founded in 1654 by a Dame Mary Talbot and was still in existence 180 years later.

Although the nearby Priory formed a Christian community (until dissolution by Henry VIII), Monk Bretton did not possess a church until 1838. The village formed part of the extensive parish of Royston. In 1838 the foundation stone for the first church was laid on a site donated by Sir George Wombwell, at the corner of Cross Street and Burton Road. A new chapelry district, separating Monk Bretton (with Cudworth) from Royston parish and enabling &#x27;baptisms, churchings and burials&#x27;, was created by Queen Victoria by an order in Council on 22 July 1843. The first church was replaced (on the same site) by the present St Paul&#x27;s Church in 1878. The church, built in the late Decorated style, is now a grade II listed building. The churchyard contains 16 burials from the 1866 Oaks Colliery explosion.

In 1801, Monk Bretton had a population of 480. By the 1870s, this had grown to just over 1900, according to John Marius Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales&quot; 1870–72. Wilson also stated that besides its church, Monk Bretton had three Methodist chapels, as well as a national school and six alms-houses.
Monk Bretton Colliery opened in 1870, extracting coal from the Barnsley Seam. The colliery was modernised on nationalisation and pit head baths, which still stand today, were opened. A village Miners&#x27; Welfare Hall was opened in Cross Street. The colliery was closed in 1968.

In February 1888 Monk Bretton was the location of a notorious murder, when the local doctor, William Burke, shot dead his own nine-year-old daughter Aileen Burke in the Norman Inn before attempting suicide with the same weapon. Despite shooting himself in the chest, Burke survived and was convicted of murder. He was sentenced to death but the sentence was later commuted. However, Burke subsequently died in prison in May 1889.

Monk Bretton once possessed some of the most historic buildings in the Barnsley area, but these were never preserved.
The Manor House and several other interesting structures on Cross Street and High Street disappeared in the 1960s. Also demolished was Monk Bretton &#x27;Castle&#x27;, a folly on Burton Bank built by a local priest as a look-out tower or observatory and subsequently used for the lighting of beacons on occasions such as royal events and the end of wars. Only Manor Farm remains, and the oldest structure still standing is a 17th-century barn at the junction of Cross Street and Westgate, belonging to the farm. The village greatly expanded in the 19th and 20th centuries with the building of new housing estates, so that today Monk Bretton more or less merges into nearby Lundwood, Carlton, Athersley and Smithies.

Monk Bretton was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Roystone, in 1866 Monk Bretton became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1921 the parish was abolished and merged with Barnsley. In 1921 the parish had a population of 5135. From 1894 to 1921 Monk Bretton was an urban district that contained the parish. It is now in the unparished area of Barnsley.

== Transport and amenities ==

The village is served by several pubs, shops, a post office, library and various other local amenities, and is a 10-minute car journey from Barnsley town centre. A Stagecoach bus service connects the village with Barnsley Interchange. The village was served by railway station on the Midland Main Line until the stop closed in 1937; a short fragment of the mainline remains in place serving a nearby glass works.

== Sites of interest ==

There is a disused former Quaker burial ground, a site described by Barnsley historian Brian Elliott as being &#x27;of regional and national importance, as one of the earliest Quaker burial grounds in the country&#x27;. There is also a modern cemetery, which contains the grave of former Barnsley, Manchester United and England striker Tommy Taylor, who was killed in the Munich air disaster on 6 February 1958. He was born in Barnsley on 29 January 1932 and lived in the town until he joined Manchester United in 1953.

The nearby Priory of St Mary Magdalene of Lund, a ruined former Cluniac (later Benedictine) house, is commonly known as Monk Bretton Priory although it actually lies outside the modern village in what is today called Lundwood and close to the old hamlet of Littleworth. The Priory, Littleworth and the village were all constituent parts of the manor of Monk Bretton.

The Ardagh Glass plant, previously Redfearns Glass, lies at the edge of the village and was formerly the largest glassworks in Europe. It keeps alive Barnsley&#x27;s glassmaking tradition, represented by a glassblower on the Barnsley coat of arms.

A war memorial stands on Cross Street, consisting of a paved area and two large pillars bearing the names of Monk Bretton&#x27;s war dead from the Great War.

Monk Bretton has an 8.7 acre park featuring a wildlife pond. The site shows undulations indicative of ridge and furrow cultivation. The Monk Bretton Miners&#x27; Welfare Committee was granted £4,760 in 1925 for the purpose of purchasing the former farmland for recreational use. In 1927 it was conveyed to the County Borough of Barnsley to be held in trust. The inscription MINERS&#x27; WELFARE SCHEME 1925 can still be seen on the old gateposts at the eastern end of the park. To the north of the park lies Winn&#x27;s Wood.

The ‘Butter Cross’ or ‘Market Cross’ at the junction of Cross Street and High Street is mediaeval in origin and was converted into a lamp post in the early 1800s.

The Working Men&#x27;s Club on Cross Street was founded in 1888. It is said to be the oldest Working Men&#x27;s Club left in the county still to be in its original building. Two of Monk Bretton&#x27;s pubs, the Pheasant Inn on High Street and the Sun Inn on Burton Road, are marked on Ordnance Survey maps from 1855.

== Notable residents ==
George Wood, an early member of a prominent local gentry family, was born in Monk Bretton in 1534 and died there in 1589. He was the ancestor of the 19th century Liberal politician Charles Wood, who took the title 1st Viscount Halifax of Monk Bretton for his 1866 peerage. 
Famous people from Monk Bretton include Yorkshire, Essex and England cricketer Darren Gough. Keith Laybourn, long serving Professor of History at Huddersfield University, was born in Monk Bretton. Julian Booker, Professor of Mechanical Design Engineering at the University of Bristol was born in Monk Bretton. As a youth, the renowned cricket umpire Dickie Bird is said to have worked at the colliery.

<doc id="759424" wikidata="Q484292" url="?curid=759424" title="Chinghiz Aitmatov">
<text>Chinghiz Torekulovich Aitmatov (12 December 1928 – 10 June 2008) was a Kyrgyz author who wrote mainly in Russian, but also in Kyrgyz. He is one of the best known figures in Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s literature.

== Life ==
He was born to a Kyrgyz father and Tatar mother. Aitmatov&#x27;s parents were civil servants in Sheker. In 1937, his father was charged with &quot;bourgeois nationalism&quot; in Moscow, arrested, and executed in 1938.

Aitmatov lived at a time when Kyrgyzstan was being transformed from one of the most remote lands of the Russian Empire to a republic of the USSR. The future author studied at a Soviet school in Sheker. He also worked from an early age. At fourteen, he was an assistant to the Secretary at the Village Soviet. He later held jobs as a tax collector, a loader, and an engineer&#x27;s assistant and continued with many other types of work.

In 1946, he began studying at the Animal Husbandry Division of the Kirghiz Agricultural Institute in Frunze, but later switched to literary studies at the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute in Moscow, where he lived from 1956 to 1958. For the next eight years he worked for Pravda. He joined the Soviet Communist Party in 1959, at the time of de-Stalinization, and later was a member of the Supreme Soviet. He endorsed the glasnost policies of Mikhail Gorbachev.

By 1990 he fulfilled a number of board and administrative positions including on the Supreme Soviet&#x27;s Committee for Culture and National Languages and the Union of Soviet Writers.

He was a member of the jury at the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival, in 1961; at the 7th Moscow International Film Festival, in 1971; and in 2002 was president of the jury at the 24th Moscow International Film Festival. In 1994, he was a member of the jury at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival.

On 16 May 2008, Aitmatov was admitted with kidney failure to a hospital in Nuremberg, Germany, where he died of pneumonia on 10 June 2008 at the age of 79. Aitmatov&#x27;s remains were flown to Kyrgyzstan, where there were numerous ceremonies before he was buried in the village Koy-Tash, Alamüdün District, Chüy Region, Kyrgyzstan, on the Ata-Beyit cemetery, which he had helped to found and where his father most likely is buried.

His obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; characterized him as &quot;a Communist writer whose novels and plays before the collapse of the Soviet Union gave a voice to the people of the remote Soviet republic of Kyrgyz&quot; and adds that he &quot;later became a diplomat and a friend and adviser to the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.&quot;

== Literary career ==
Chinghiz Aitmatov belonged to the post-war generation of writers. His output before his well-known work &quot;Jamila&quot; in 1958 was not significant. Aitmatov&#x27;s first two publications appeared in 1952 in Russian: &quot;Газетчик Дзюйо&quot; (&quot;The Newspaper Boy Dziuio&quot;) and &quot;Ашым&quot; (&quot;Ashim&quot;). His first work published in Kyrgyz was &quot;Ак Жаан&quot; (&quot;White Rain&quot;, 1954). Two other short novels from that period are &quot;Трудная переправа&quot; (&quot;A Difficult Passage&quot;, 1956) and &quot;Лицом к лицу&quot; (&quot;Face to Face&quot;, 1957). But it was &quot;Jamila&quot; that came to prove the author&#x27;s work. Seen through the eyes of an adolescent boy, it tells of how Jamila, a village girl, separated from her soldier husband by the war, falls in love with a disabled former soldier staying in their village as they all work to bring in and transport the grain crop.

1980 saw his first novel &quot;The Day Lasts More Than a Hundred Years&quot;; his next significant novel, &quot;The Place of the Skull&quot;, was published in 1987. &quot;The Day Lasts More than a Hundred Years&quot; and other writings were translated into several languages.

Aitmatov&#x27;s art was glorified by admirers. But even critics of Aitmatov mentioned the high quality of his work. Aitmatov&#x27;s writing has some elements that are unique specifically to his creative process. His work drew on folklore, not in the ancient sense of it; rather, he tried to recreate and synthesize oral tales in the context of contemporary life. This is prevalent in his work; in nearly every story he refers to a myth, a legend, or a folktale. In &quot;The Day Lasts More Than a Hundred Years,&quot; a poetic legend about a young captive turned into a &quot;mankurt&quot; serves as a tragic allegory and becomes a significant symbolic expression of the philosophy of the novel.

His work also touches on Kyrgyzstan’s transformation from the Russian empire to a republic of the USSR and the lives of its people during the transformation. This is prevalent in &quot;Farewell, Gyulsary!&quot; Although the short story touches on the idea of friendship and loyalty between a man and his stallion, it also serves a tragic allegory of the political and USSR government. It explores the loss and grief that many Kyrgyz faced through the protagonist character in the short story.

A second aspect of Aitmatov&#x27;s writing is his ultimate closeness to our &quot;little brothers&quot; the animals, for their and our lives are intimately and inseparably connected. The two central characters of &quot;Farewell, Gyulsary!&quot; are a man and his stallion. A camel plays a prominent role in &quot;The Day Lasts More Than a Hundred Years&quot;; one of the key turns of the novel which decides the fate of the main character is narrated through the story of the camel&#x27;s rut and riot. &quot;The Place of the Skull&quot; starts off and finishes with the story of a wolf pack and the great wolf-mother Akbara and her cub; human lives enter the narrative but interweave with the lives of the wolves.

In 1963, Aitmatov was honored with the Lenin Prize for the compilation &quot;Повести гор и степей&quot; (the title translates into English &quot;Tales of the Mountains and Steppes&quot;) which had been published earlier that same year containing the four novels &quot;Джамиля&quot; (&quot;Jamila&quot;), &quot;Тополек мой в красной косынке&quot; (&quot;To Have and to Lose&quot;), &quot;Верблюжий глаз&quot; (&quot;Camel&#x27;s Eye&quot;) and &quot;Первый учитель&quot; (&quot;Duishen&quot; / &quot;The First Teacher&quot;). This collection in Russian should not be confused with the 1969 collection in English titled as well &quot;Tales of the Mountains and Steppes&quot; which is a different compilation containing the three novels &quot;Jamila&quot;, &quot;Duishen&quot; and &quot;Farewell, Gyulsary!&quot; (besides an introduction by A. Turkov &quot;Speak out in Golden Words of Truth&quot;). He was later awarded a State prize for &quot;Farewell, Gyulsary!&quot;.

Some of his stories were filmed, like &quot;The First Teacher&quot; in 1965, &quot;Jamila&quot; in 1969, and several times &quot;To Have and to Lose&quot;.

As with many educated Kyrgyz, Aitmatov was fluent in both Kyrgyz and Russian. As he explained in one of his interviews, Russian was as much of a native language for him as Kyrgyz. Most of his early works he wrote in Kyrgyz; some of these he later translated into Russian himself, while others were translated into Russian by other translators. From 1966, he was writing in Russian. By the mid-1990s, as his reputation in Kyrgyzstan was well established, Russian critics attacked him and his 1995 novel &quot;Tavro Kassandry&quot; (&quot;The Mark of Cassandra&quot;)--unfairly, according to literary critic Keneshbek Asanaliev, who commented that Aitmatov&#x27;s Kyrgys detractors simply reprinted an attack piece by Russian critic V. Bondarenko. The latter also claimed that Aitmatov was anti-Russian, a claim that Asanaliev ridicules.

== Diplomatic career ==
In addition to his literary work, Chinghiz Aitmatov was from 1990 to 1993 the ambassador for the Soviet Union and then Russia to Belgium and, later, for Kyrgyzstan to the European Union, NATO, UNESCO and the Benelux countries.

<doc id="759427" wikidata="Q4862424" url="?curid=759427" title="Baron Grey of Ruthin">
<text>Baron Grey of Ruthin (or Ruthyn) was a noble title created in the Peerage of England by writ of summons in 1324 for Sir Roger de Grey, a son of John, 2nd Baron Grey of Wilton, and has been in abeyance since 1963. Historically, this branch of the Grey family was seated at Ruthin Castle in Wales.

The Bearers of the Great Golden Spurs, or Saint George&#x27;s Spurs, the emblems of knighthood and chivalry, perform their service &quot;jure sanguinis&quot;, dependent upon descent from William, Earl of Pembroke, heir to his brother, John le Marshal, who carried the Spurs at the Coronation of Richard I in 1189. The Marshals failed in the male line and the hereditary right descended in the female line through the Hastings family to the Lords Grey de Ruthyn, later Marquesses of Hastings. The male line failed again and an equal right in the female line descended in 1911 to the Earl of Loudoun (Abney-Hastings) and Lord Grey de Ruthyn (Clifton).

<doc id="759429" wikidata="Q1618033" url="?curid=759429" title="Thurnscoe">
<text>Thurnscoe is a village in the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley in South Yorkshire, England. The village falls within the Dearne North ward of the Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council, and along with Goldthorpe and Bolton upon Dearne is part of the Dearne Towns. Historically within the West Riding of Yorkshire, the village is approximately from Barnsley and from Doncaster. It is served by Thurnscoe railway station with bus links provided by Stagecoach. In 2011, it had a population of 8,687.

== History ==
Set in the heart of the Dearne Valley, historically, Thurnscoe was a farming village and in Roman times it was situated on the Roman road Ryknild Street, which ran down a track, (known locally as &quot;the cow track&quot; as it was the route for the dairy herds until the farm closed in recent years), to the east of what is now Rectory Lane. It continues up Southfield Lane by the side of the cemetery and over fields to the south of the village, and up Clayton Lane to the north. Thurnscoe was known in early times as Turnesc, this becoming Terunsc by the time of its mention in the Domesday Book, with the name Thurnscoe is derived from Old Norse for Thorn Tree Wood. Parts of the village were owned by Roche Abbey, who dug Magnesian Limestone in an area known locally as &quot;Cave Wood&quot; which is a craggy geography between the overlying Cadeby Formation and underlying Yellow Sands Formation, both late Permian. Cadeby limestone from Thurnscoe was a moderately significant export in medieval times.

Thurnscoe&#x27;s oldest building is the Church of St. Helen on High Street, built in 812 by the Angles and rebuilt in 1087 by the Normans though only the tower of the original structure remains. Excavations during renovation work (under the former Rector, John Hall) on the church revealed Anglo-Saxon remains, including a skeleton, indicating that it was used as a sacred site before the Christian church was established here. The western side of the village has more history to it, including Thurnscoe Hall (now a nursing home) and the 1715 Blacksmith&#x27;s Cottage near St Helen&#x27;s Church. Red House Cottage on High Street is the oldest building in the village dating back to the 16th century.
Before the mines opened, Thurnscoe was once a wealthy farming community, famous in the Middle Ages for the quality of its cheese. There were a number of historic farms and arable and livestock fields all around the village, but most of the farms have now gone and most of the fields have been covered by modern housing.

In 1931, the civil parish had a population of 10,548. Thurnscoe became an urban district in 1908 which contained the parish. On 1 April 1937 the parish and urban district were abolished and merged with Dearne.

=== Mining years and after ===
Mining began in the 17th century from small surface mines (Benson and Neville 1976) but exploded along with the population after Hickleton Main Colliery found the Barnsley seam in 1894. Almost the entire of the village east of the railway was built to accommodate the coal miners, including St. Hilda&#x27;s Church in 1935 (deconsecrated 2017). In 1980 mining accounted for 81% of all male employment in the area. It was one of many mining villages in the Yorkshire coalfield that suffered high levels of unemployment when the British coal mining industry was restructured in the 1980s. Hickleton Colliery was merged with Goldthorpe in 1986 before that too was closed in 1994.

From 1983 to 1986, Thurnscoe was one of four areas in South Yorkshire where the Probation Service ran a victim/offender mediation project (one of the first of its kind in the country).

The main pit waste tip has been landscaped and converted, with the aid of the environmental body &quot;Groundwork&quot;, into &quot;Phoenix Park&quot; which contains a climbing wall, picnic areas and many pieces of art which were developed by and in conjunction with the local community. Poems by local resident Desiree Chipp are carved into three at the entrances to the site. There is a small car park accessible off Lidget Lane.
Towards the end of the 20th century many of the historic buildings have been demolished, including the Victorian primary and infant schools, the Station Hotel (which had an inn sign which was featured on a Royal Mail postage stamp) and Broadway Buildings Ballroom. The village once also had a swimming baths, cinema and an active market, the former site of the market eventually was replaced with a car park for the village&#x27;s Home Bargains store, which opened in 2017.

A series of character areas are being created, defined by housing type and form, and set within an overall master planning strategy to ensure the development of an integrated neighbourhood. The project started on site in early 2010.
Some new social housing was built on the redeveloped site of the old colliery buildings adjacent to the former colliery officers&#x27; club. The total investment for the scheme is £2.1 million which also includes environmental works to improve the boundary wall to the social club and to upgrade the access to the public open space adjacent to the site.

A brook which runs through the western extent, travelling under the village in a culvert, flooded during the gales and heavy rain of 1987, briefly threatening the local primary school, Gooseacre, and flooding several homes along Merrill Road. Litter from the school was stated to be the cause of the flood, and a grille was installed on the brook&#x27;s culvert entrance. Council records show that the water table is very close to the surface in Thurnscoe, as little as 18 inches below the surface in parts. This has led to local concerns about the building of new houses over the green areas of the village and resulted in a petition against this in 2007. Another flood on 26 June 2007 flooded Houghton Road outside the Thurnscoe Hotel and burst the banks of all the dykes in Thurnscoe. Merrill Road was once again flooded and it flooded as far as Westfield Crescent. In parts of Thurnscoe the water was up to waist level. Also the road between Thurnscoe and Great Houghton was flooded severely. Dearnlea Old People&#x27;s home on Welfare Road had to be evacuated.

==Geography and environment==
Thurnscoe&#x27;s geography is characteristic of glacial moraine, with gentle inclines, good arable clay/loam soil and no irregular boulders. The village was once known for its numerous springs and dykes.
High Street (which is not the main road) is a meandering residential street which was once a river. Many of the dykes were enclosed into pipelines during the 1960s and 1970s as flooding had traditionally been a problem in the lower part of the village.

The village is bisected, east/west, by a railway, originally laid to serve the colliery, into Thurnscoe and Thurnscoe East. The residents do not consider the two to be separate villages. Locals refer to Thurnscoe East as &quot;the top end&quot;. The eastern half is characterised by low cost terraced housing (built to serve the former colliery) and a small business park on the site of the former colliery. The western side of the village is also known as &quot;Old Thurnscoe&quot;, or &quot;the bottom end&quot; by locals from the &quot;top end&quot;.

== Sports ==
Thurnscoe Park Avenue F.C. competed in the FA Cup from 1919 to 1921, and Thurnscoe Victoria F.C. competed in the same competition during the 1930s and 1940s.
Thurnscoe is also home to Thurnscoe Institute Cricket Club, and a sports ground near the village&#x27;s Asda supermarket.

== Notable people ==
*Billy Whitehurst, former Hull City and Newcastle United striker, was born in the village.
*Leonard Parkin (1929–1993), Journalist and newscaster on ITN’s News at One and News at 5:45. Originally with the BBC.

<doc id="759432" wikidata="Q5580371" url="?curid=759432" title="Goldthorpe">
<text>Goldthorpe is a small town in the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley, in South Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire. It was anciently a small medieval farming village, Goldthorpe is recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; a part of the Manor of Bolton upon Dearne which was once owned by Roger de Busli. The town is in the Dearne North Ward of Barnsley MBC and had a population of 6,051 at the 2011 Census.

==History==

Early prehistoric pottery, a flint flake, Bronze Age cremation sites and Romano-British ditches and field systems have been found in the Goldthorpe area suggesting ancient occupation of the area over a long period of time.

In the early 18th century, Barnsley Attorney William Henry Marsden Esquire of Burntwood Hall bought the Manor of Bolton on Dearne with Goldthorpe for £10,000 including over of land. Goldthorpe is recorded in the 1761–1767 Inclosure Awards. The Marsden family held the manor until 1815.

St John and St Mary Magdalene Church, Goldthorpe, built in 1916, is an early example of a ferro-concrete building. According to Nikolaus Pevsner, the pulpit bought by the church in 1931 is 18th-century Flemish.

Goldthorp, Goldthorpe, Gouldthorpe and all variations of this surname, derive from this placename. A marriage took place in 1361, when Robert de Goldthorpe alias Robertson, son of Robert Lord of the Manor of Goldthorpe married Esabul de Shepley daughter of William de Shepley, half heiress with her sister Dionyssia to the Manor of Shepley. Descendants with the surname Goldthorpe were the major land owners for almost 200 years, until the final heir sold the land and left the area. Cadet branches remained in the Huddersfield area for many centuries mainly as wool weavers.

The significant industry in the area for much of the 19th and 20th century was coal mining. This ended in the immediate area in 1994 with the closure of Goldthorpe Colliery. The 1984-85 Miners&#x27; Strike affected the area significantly. In 1984 two teenage boys had died in Goldthorpe while collecting coal during the strike; a memorial to them was built in 2011.

==Economy==

The area is now commonly referred to as the Dearne Valley and was a major coal mining area. There is a small industrial estate to the north of the village but in the absence of new industries the area has become deprived. The village is connected to areas of wider employment such as Leeds, Wakefield and Barnsley by public transport.

There have been attempts to regenerate the village in the twenty first century. In the 2010s several residential streets are part of the village centre were demolished and a new school constructed. Regeneration proposals have been made for Co-operative Street. The village is plagued by many abandoned houses which have become unlettable and lie often in states of dereliction.

==Facilities==
Goldthorpe railway station opened in 1988 on the Wakefield Line, with services to Leeds, Wakefield Westgate and Doncaster.

Goldthorpe Library is a modern building (the previous library having been burnt down in an arson attack) in the middle of the town.

In the 2010s the village centre of Goldthorpe was remodelled. The shops to the eastern end of the centre were replaced with Dearne Goldthorpe Primary School. The market area on Market Street was also closed and is now housing. The remaining parts of the centre along the western section of Doncaster Road have been refurbished with new flagged pedestrian pavements.
The village has one pub remaining; The Rusty Dudley. There were two banks; a Natwest and a Yorkshire Bank, the latter of which has now been converted into a bank; The New Bank. There are three working mens&#x27; clubs; Goldthorpe Reform Working Mens&#x27; Club, The Golden Nugget Working Mens&#x27; Club and the Union Jack Memorial Club. There were previously two other pubs; the Horse and Groom which has since been demolished and The Goldthorpe which lies in a state of significant dereliction at the eastern end of Doncaster Road.

There are two supermarkets; an Aldi and an Asda. There was previously a Co-op supermarket in Doncaster Road but this has since closed.

==Schools==
The main secondary school in the area is Astrea Academy Dearne, a school that caters for around 1,300 pupils aged 11–16 years. There are three main primary schools: Dearne Goldthorpe Primary School (3–11, community school), Dearne Highgate Primary School (3–11, community school) and Sacred Heart Catholic Primary School (3–11, voluntary aided school).

==Sports==
Goldthorpe was represented in the FA Cup during the 1920s and 1930s by Goldthorpe United F.C. Goldthorpe is home to Dearne CC, a cricket club established in 1926 and currently playing in Division 5 of the South Yorkshire Senior Cricket League.

<text>Gawber is an area of Barnsley in South Yorkshire, England. The area falls within the Darton West ward of the Barnsley MBC. There is a primary school, Gawber Primary School, a preschool, Gawber Pre-School, and a church, St Thomas.
The origin of the place-name is from the Old English words &quot;galga&quot; and &quot;beorg&quot; meaning gallows hill and appears as &quot;Galgbergh&quot; in 1304.

In &quot;A Topographical Dictionary of England&quot; (1848) Gawber is noted for its collieries. The North Gawber Colliery which closed in 1988 was located to the north in Mapplewell and the East Gawber Hall Colliery, of which the buried remains of the colliery fanhouse are a scheduled monument, was to the north-east of Gawber.

<doc id="759435" wikidata="Q502268" url="?curid=759435" title="Johnnie Walker">
<text>Johnnie Walker is a brand of Scotch whisky produced by Diageo in Scotland. It was established in the Scottish burgh of Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire in 1820, and continued to be produced and bottled at the town&#x27;s Hill Street plant, once the world&#x27;s largest bottling plant, until its closure in 2012, a decision announced by Diageo in 2009 which would bring the 190-year association between the brand and Kilmarnock to an end.

The brand was first established by grocer John Walker, a native of Kilmarnock, who originally established the business and a grocery shop in 1820, with his son Alexander &quot;Alec&quot; Walker and grandson Alexander Walker II, being largely responsible for establishing the whisky as a favoured brand. It is the world&#x27;s highest selling Scotch whisky, sold in almost every country, with annual sales of the equivalent of over 223.7 million bottles in 2016 [].

== History ==
=== John Walker, founder ===
John Walker was born on 25 July 1805. His farmer father died in 1819, and the family sold the farm. Their trustees invested the proceeds, £417, in an Italian warehouse, grocery, and wine and spirits shop on the High Street in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, Scotland. Walker managed the grocery, wine, and spirits segment as a teenager in 1820. The Excise Act 1823 relaxed strict laws on distillation of whisky and reduced, by a considerable amount, the extremely heavy taxes on the distillation and sale of whisky. By 1825, Walker, a teetotaller, was selling spirits, including rum, brandy, gin, and whisky.

In short order, he switched to dealing mainly in whisky. Since blending of grain whiskies with malt whiskies was still banned, he sold both blended malt whiskies and grain whiskies. They were sold as made-to-order whiskies, blended to meet specific customer requirements, because he did not have any brand of his own. He began using his name on labels years later, selling a blended malt as &quot;Walker&#x27;s Kilmarnock Whisky&quot;. John Walker died in 1857.

=== Death of Walker and takeover by son ===
The brand became popular, but after Walker&#x27;s death it was his son Alexander &#x27;Alec&#x27; Walker and grandson Alexander Walker II who were largely responsible for establishing the whisky as a favoured brand. The Spirits Act 1860 legalised the blending of grain whiskies with malt whiskies and ushered in the modern era of blended Scotch whisky. Blended Scotch whisky, lighter and sweeter in character, was more accessible, and much more marketable to a wider audience. Andrew Usher of Edinburgh, was the first to produce a blended whisky, but the Walkers followed in due course.

Alexander Walker had introduced the brand&#x27;s signature square bottle in 1860. This meant more bottles fitting the same space and fewer broken bottles. The other identifying characteristic of the Johnnie Walker bottle was – and still is – the label, which, since that year, is applied at an angle of 24 degrees upwards left to right and allows text to be made larger and more visible. This also allowed consumers to identify it at a distance. One major factor in his favour was the arrival of a railway in Kilmarnock, carrying goods to merchant ships travelling the world. Thanks to Alec&#x27;s business acumen, sales of Walker&#x27;s Kilmarnock reached 100,000 gallons (450,000 litres) per year by 1862.

In 1865, Alec created Johnnie Walker&#x27;s first commercial blend and called it &quot;Old Highland Whisky&quot;, before registering it as such in 1867.

Under John Walker, whisky sales represented eight percent of the firm&#x27;s income; by the time Alexander was ready to pass on the company to his own sons, that figure had increased to between 90 and 95 percent.

=== Expansion and growth ===
In 1893, Cardhu distillery was purchased by the Walkers to reinforce the stocks of one of the Johnnie Walker blends&#x27; key malt whiskies. This move took the Cardhu single malt out of the market and made it the exclusive preserve of the Walkers. Cardhu&#x27;s output became the heart of the &quot;Old Highland Whisky&quot; and after the rebranding of 1909, the prime single malt in Johnnie Walker Red and Black Labels.

From 1906 to 1909, John&#x27;s grandsons George and Alexander II expanded the line and had three blended whiskies in the market, &quot;Old Highland&quot; at 5 years old, &quot;Special Old Highland&quot; at 9 years old, and &quot;Extra Special Old Highland&quot; at 12 years old. These three brands had the standard Johnnie Walker labels, the only difference being their colours: white, red, and black, respectively. They were commonly referred to in public by the colours of their labels. In 1909, as part of a rebranding that saw the introduction of the Striding Man, a mascot used to the present day that was created by cartoonist Tom Browne, the company re-branded their blends to match the common colour names. The Old Highland was renamed &quot;Johnnie Walker White Label&quot; and made at 6 years old, the Special Old Highland became &quot;Johnnie Walker Red Label&quot; at 10 years old, and &quot;Extra Special Old Highland&quot; was renamed &quot;Johnnie Walker Black Label&quot;, remaining 12 years old.

Sensing an opportunity to expand the scale and variety of their brands, Walker acquired interests in Coleburn distillery in 1915, quickly followed by Clynelish Distillery Co. and Dailuaine-Talisker Co. in 1916. This ensured a steady supply of single-malt whisky from the Cardhu, Coleburn, Clynelish, Talisker, and Dailuaine distilleries. In 1923, Walker bought Mortlach distillery, in furtherance of their strategy. Most of their output was used in Johnnie Walker blends, whose burgeoning popularity required increasingly vast volumes of single malts.

Johnnie Walker White was dropped during World War I. In 1932, Alexander II added &quot;Johnnie Walker Swing&quot; to the line, the name originating from the unusual shape of the bottle, which allowed it to rock back and forth.

The company joined Distillers Company in 1925. Distillers Company was acquired by Guinness in 1986, and Guinness merged with Grand Metropolitan to form Diageo in 1997. That year saw the introduction of the blended malt, Johnnie Walker Pure Malt, renamed Johnnie Walker Green Label in 2004.

=== Closure of Kilmarnock plant ===

In July 2009, the brand&#x27;s current owners, Diageo, decided to close all operations in Kilmarnock by 2012. This met with backlash from local people, politicians, and then-First Minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond. Despite petitions, public campaigns, and a large-scale march around Kilmarnock, Diageo proceeded with the closure. The Johnnie Walker plant in Kilmarnock closed its doors in March 2012 and the buildings were subsequently demolished a year later. The site is now occupied by the Kilmarnock campus of Ayrshire College and HALO Urban Regeneration.

In July 2020, Johnnie Walker announced plans to release a new environmentally-friendly paper bottle set to debut in early 2021.

In October 2021, Johnnie Walker announced a new label, &quot;Jane Walker&quot;, created by the distillery&#x27;s first female master blender.

== Blends ==
For most of its history Johnnie Walker only offered a few blends. Since the turn of the century, there has been a spate of special and limited bottlings.


* Red Label: A non-age-stated blend. It has been the best selling Scotch whisky in the world since 1945. It is primarily used for making mixed drinks.
* Black Label: Aged 12 years, it is one of the world&#x27;s best-selling Scotch whiskies.
* Double Black: Made available for general release in 2011 after a successful launch in travel retail. The whisky was created taking Black Label as a blueprint, adding more peaty malt whiskies to it, and maturing it in heavily charred old oak casks.
* Johnnie Walker Swing: Supplied in a distinctive bottle whose irregular bottom allows it to rock back and forth. This type of bottle design was originally used aboard sailing ships. It was Alexander Walker II&#x27;s last blend: it features a high proportion of Speyside malts, complemented by malts from the northern Highlands and Islay.
* Green Label: First introduced in 1997 as Johnnie Walker Pure Malt 15 Year Old, it was renamed Johnnie Walker Green Label in 2004. Green Label is a blended malt whisky, meaning it is made by mixing single malts with no grain whisky added. All whiskies used are a minimum of 15 years old. Diageo discontinued Green Label globally in 2012 (except for Taiwan, where demand for blended malts is very strong) as part of a reconstruction of the range that saw the introduction of Gold Label Reserve and Platinum Label. The brand was reintroduced in 2016 and is again globally available.
* Gold Label: A blend of over 15 single malts, it was derived from Alexander Walker II&#x27;s blending notes for a whisky to commemorate Johnnie Walker&#x27;s centenary. Originally, Gold Label was bottled at 18 years and labelled &quot;the Centenary blend&quot;. In 2013, Gold Label was renamed &quot;Gold Label Reserve&quot; and now carries no age statement.
* Platinum Label: Originally introduced to replace the original Gold Label in the Asian market and sold alongside Gold Label Reserve. The Platinum Label name was discontinued in mid-2017 in favour of &quot;Johnnie Walker Aged 18 Years&quot;, but the Platinum Label name was later restored.
* Blue Label: Johnnie Walker&#x27;s premium blend. Johnnie Walker Blue Label is blended to re-create the character and taste of some of the earliest whisky blends created in the 19th century. It bears no age statement. Bottles are numbered serially and sold in a silk-lined box accompanied by a certificate of authenticity. It is one of the most expensive blended Scotch whiskies on the market, with prices in the range of US$174–450. Over 25 Blue Label–based Limited Editions have been released to date.

== Marketing ==
The Walkers created their primary marketing strategy in 1908 with advertisements featuring Browne&#x27;s Striding Man, using the slogan, &quot;Johnnie Walker: Born 1820, still going strong&quot;. Photographs replaced the drawings in the 1930s, and the Striding Man was miniaturised to a coloured logo in 1939; it first appeared on the Johnnie Walker labels in 1960. In the late 1990s, the direction of the Striding Man was reversed as part of a &quot;Keep Walking&quot; campaign. The Striding Man icon was most recently redrawn in 2015.

In 2009, the advertising agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty (BBH) created a new short film, starring Robert Carlyle and directed by Jamie Rafn, titled &quot;The Man Who Walked Around the World&quot;, which outlined the history of the Johnnie Walker brand.

In April 2015, Diageo produced the Johnny Drama, named after the Entourage HBO series character Johnny &quot;Drama&quot; Chase, to promote the release of the movie version of Entourage.

In October 2018, Diageo teamed up with HBO to produce &quot;White Walker by Johnnie Walker&quot; whisky, inspired by the army of the undead in the TV series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; as part of the marketing for the series&#x27; final season. Diageo then released a collection of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;–inspired single malt whiskies, followed by two more whiskies by Johnnie Walker in mid-2019.

== Accolades ==
Johnnie Walker spirits have received strong scores at international spirits ratings competitions and from liquor review bodies. The Green Label received a string of three double gold medals from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition between 2005 and 2007. The Gold Label received double gold medals from the San Francisco competition in 2008 and 2009 and won a gold in 2010. Spirits ratings aggregator proof66.com, which averages scores from the San Francisco Spirits Competition, Wine Enthusiast, and others, puts the Black, Blue, Gold and Green Labels in its highest performance category (&quot;Tier 1&quot; Spirits). Johnnie Walker spirits have several times taken part in the Monde Selection&#x27;s World Quality Selections and have received a Gold and Grand Gold Quality Award. Johnnie Walker Gold Label Reserve won the World&#x27;s Best Blended—Best Scotch Blended in World Whiskies Awards 2018.

== Sponsorships ==
Johnnie Walker was the official whisky of Formula One, and was a sponsor for McLaren and Racing Point. Johnnie Walker is also the title namesake for the F1 Grand Prix race in Spa, Belgium.

Johnnie Walker sponsored the Johnnie Walker Classic, an Asia-Pacific golf tournament, up to 2009 and the Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles, a golf tournament in Scotland up to 2013. Diageo sold the Gleneagles Hotel and Golf Course, the site of the tournament, mid-2015 to focus on its core business.

== Cultural figures ==
Winston Churchill&#x27;s favourite whisky was Johnnie Walker Red Label, which he mixed with a large amount of water and drank throughout the day.

&quot;Vanity Fair&quot; writer Christopher Hitchens was partial to Johnnie Walker Black Label cut with Perrier sparkling mineral water and referred to it as &quot;Mr Walker&#x27;s Amber Restorative&quot;.

At the height of his fame in the late 1960s, New York Jets quarterback Joe Namath said, &quot;I like my girls blonde and my Johnnie Walker red&quot;. 

Johnnie Walker Blue Label was a favourite of US president Richard Nixon&#x27;s; Nixon used to enjoy it with ginger ale and a wedge of lime.

A number of singers and songwriters have referenced Johnnie Walker in their works, from Amanda Marshall to ZZ Top. Elliott Smith&#x27;s Oscar-nominated &quot;Miss Misery&quot; has the narrator &quot;[making] it through the day with some help from Johnnie Walker Red.&quot; Heavy metal band Black Label Society was named after Johnnie Walker Black Label whisky, as Zakk Wylde was very fond of the drink. George Thorogood name checks &quot;Johnny Walker and his brothers Black and Red&quot; in &quot;I Drink Alone&quot;.The name appears also in the song &quot;Remember to Forget&quot; by Passenger.

Polish fictional humorous character Jakub Wędrowycz is a wordplay based on the Polish translation of &quot;Johny Walker&quot;.

In the 2007 film &quot;The Man from Earth&quot;, the main character John Oldman (David Lee Smith) produces a bottle of Johnnie Walker Green Label, with his friends commenting on its quality.

In the 1982 film &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, Harrison Ford&#x27;s character Rick Deckard is seen drinking Johnnie Walker Black Label, which he also drinks in the sequel, &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; (2017). Coinciding with the release of &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot;, Johnnie Walker released a &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; edition of its Black Label, which was bottled at a higher proof.

<text>Hoyland is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley in South Yorkshire, England. The town developed from the hamlets of Upper Hoyland, Hoyland, and Hoyland Common.

The town has also been known as &quot;Nether Hoyland&quot;. When the urban district council was formed the name they used was &quot;Hoyland Nether Urban District Council&quot;. This was also applied to the area run by Hoyland UDC. However, most locals have always known it simply as Hoyland. Hoyland Nether comprised Hoyland Town, Hoyland Common, Upper Hoyland, Elsecar, Milton, Platts Common and Wentworth.

Hoyland is part of the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley in the metropolitan county of South Yorkshire, but it lies within the historic boundaries of the West Riding of Yorkshire. In 2001 it had a population of 15,497. At the 2011 Census the appropriate ward (Hoyland Milton) had a population of 11,852.

==Governance==

Hoyland Nether UDC was formed in 1894. Its jurisdiction covered Elsecar, Hoyland Common, Platts Common and Skiers Hall (until 1938, when boundary changes took place Alderthwaite and part of Harley) were administered by Hoyland. This land was exchanged with Rotherham RDC for some land in Brampton Bierlow, which included the site of Elsecar Main Colliery, as well as Hoyland itself. It lasted until 1974 at which point it was merged into Barnsley MBC. Hoyland Town Hall is still standing and its upper floors have been converted into apartments.

==Buildings==

The town is home to an 18th-century folly called Lowe Stand, built as a lookout and hunting lodge shortly before his death by the first Marquess of Rockingham, at the highest point in the area some 593 ft above sea level. On the sloping ground below this folly is Upper Hoyland Hall, the former home of a notable family of yeoman farmers, the Townends, who owned extensive land in Hoyland.

The Church of England parish church is St Peter&#x27;s, a Grade II listed building dating from 1830. It is in the Gothic Revival style and is built of sandstone and slate roofed. The Roman Catholic church (1929) is of brick and tile construction in the Italian Romanesque style, with a square bell tower. The former Princess Theatre on West Street is a brick building dating from 1893.

Among Hoyland&#x27;s remaining notable older residences and former residences are Hoyland Hall, a late Georgian property, situated in a small park off Market Street and sometime home to William Vizard, first owner of Hoyland Silkstone Colliery, who was the attorney to Queen Caroline at her celebrated trial in the House of Lords. Also in or off Market Street are Kirk House, Kirk Cottage, Bark House, Thistle House and Riversdale. Netherfield House is situated near the town centre and Hoyland&#x27;s oldest known surviving residence and at one time the home of a Townend, being in recent years used as a dentist&#x27;s, is situated in West Street (formerly Finkle Street). Many of Hoyland&#x27;s fine Georgian properties, consisting of cottages, shops and chapels were demolished in the 1960s and 1970s.

The trunkline follows five overall segments: a southeasterly track from South Haven to Oshtemo Township (just west of Kalamazoo), a northerly path to Plainwell, a southeasterly route to Richland, a northeasterly course to the Hastings area and an easterly route through the Lansing area.

The M-43 designation dates back to at least July 1, 1919, when it was used on a series of roadways running between Kalamazoo and St. Charles. Its northern- and easternmost sections were transferred to other highways in the 1930s. Additions to M-43 extended it to its current termini. Several sections of the highway were realigned during its history, one of these changes led to the creation of a business loop in Grand Ledge. Another former segment of the trunkline in the Lansing area has been renumbered M-143. In January 2019, the highway was rerouted north to bypass downtown Kalamazoo, where it had historically formed a high traffic trunkline through the city. The former segment between Kalamazoo and Richland was renumbered M-343.

==Route description==
M-43 begins at an intersection with BL I-196 in South Haven. Known locally as Bailey Avenue, the road heads out of the city to the southwest, intersecting County Road A-2 before running over Interstate 196 (I-196). From there, the road continues to the southeast near the airport through the rural areas of Van Buren County. The road runs through mixed woodland and fields before passing through Bangor. After Bangor, the route heads due east past Glendale and then intersects M-40 north of Paw Paw.

After the junction with M-40, the highway then enters Kalamazoo County and has an interchange with US Highway 131 (US 131). At that interchange, M-43 turns northward running concurrently along the freeway. US 131/M-43 intersects the northern end of Business US 131 (Bus. US 131) at a partial interchange; southbound freeway traffic can exit to the business route, and traffic from Bus. US 131 can only enter northbound US 131/M-43. Further north, the freeway enters Allegan County, and at Plainwell, M-43 departs US 131 to follow M-89 southeasterly. The two highways briefly cross through Barry County before crossing back into Kalamazoo County. M-43 and M-89 separate about a mile (1.6 km) north of Richland. M-89 continues southward into town, and M-43 turns northward.

After the concurrency ends, M-43 turns east and then back north to run between Little Long and Gull lakes. It is at this point where M-43 begins its northward trek. The road continues on a general north-northeast track through rural areas and beside several lakes in Barry County before meeting M-179 and M-37. M-43 merges with the latter highway and together they run into Hastings. Downtown, M-37 leaves town to the south, while M-43 heads north before curving around the east, passing through farm fields approaching the community of Woodland. After leaving town, the road meets M-66, and together they head north to a junction with M-50.
M-43 then turns east with M-50, and they briefly run together before M-50 diverges to the southeast. Now known as the Grand Ledge Highway, M-43 continues its easterly path across northern Eaton County before dipping south briefly to travel around the south side of Grand Ledge. Just south of town, M-43 has a junction with M-100 and then follows Saginaw Highway. The highway then has a junction with I-96/I-69 in Delta Township before continuing into Lansing, merged with BL I-69.

In Lansing, the highway travels splits to follow the one-way streets of Saginaw (eastbound) and Oakland (westbound) near the Sparrow Specialty Hospital. BL I-69/M-43 then crosses the Grand River and passes Marshall Park. The trunkline then passes over US 127 just before the paired one-way streets merge back together on Grand River Avenue. After the merge, M-43 heads southeast through East Lansing, passing the main campus of Michigan State University and Spartan Stadium. The road continues on its southeast path, traveling by the Meridian Mall as it enters Meridian Township. From here the road travels through Williamston before terminating at an interchange with I-96 just south of Webberville at exit 122.

The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) maintains M-43 like all other state trunkline highways. As a part of those responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic along its roadways using a metric called average annual daily traffic. This is a calculation of the traffic levels for a roadway segment for any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT determined that the highest traffic volume along M-43 was east of the I-96/I-69 interchange at 38,927 vehicles per day. The highest commercial traffic was west of the interchange at 645 trucks daily. The lowest volumes were at Woodland with only 1,700 vehicles and 120 trucks traveling along that section of the highway daily. Two segments of M-43 are listed on the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility. The first is between Oshtemo Township and Plainwell, where M-43 runs concurrently with US 131. The second is between I-96/I-69 in Delta Township and the junction between Saginaw Street and Grand River Avenue in East Lansing.

==History==
When M-43 was first commissioned by July 1, 1919, it ran from M-17 in Kalamazoo to Hastings. It also extended north to Ionia and Stanton before turning east through Ithaca to St. Charles. In 1929, the western end was extended from Kalamazoo to South Haven, with a section still under construction. By the end of 1930, the sections of M-43 north and east of Woodbury were redesignated as parts of other highways. The Woodbury–Stanton segment was renumbered M-14, and the Stanton–St. Charles highway became M-57. In 1938, the road was extended to the east, replacing the routing of M-39 from Woodbury all the way to East Lansing where it intersected US 16 as it existed on Grand River Avenue.

The next year, M-37 was realigned, which created a concurrency with M-43 in the Hasting area. When M-43 was rerouted in 1954, the new course of the highway ran concurrently with M-66 for a few miles in rural northeastern Barry County. All of the highway was completely paved in 1956 when a new routing opened northeast of Hastings, bypassing Coats Grove. The fourth change in the Barry County routing was made by the next year; the highway was rerouted due northward out of Hastings along Broadway Street.

Around 1959, M-43 was shifted to bypass Grand Ledge. The former route through town was retained as a state highway, designated Bus. M-43. M-43 was extended from its eastern end in Lansing in 1962 along a section of highway that was formerly part of US 16 on Grand River Avenue; the extension to Webberville was made when the I-96 freeway opened that year. Through the Lansing area, M-43 was rerouted off Michigan Avenue downtown. This former routing was renumbered M-143.

The City of Kalamazoo accepted jurisdiction of the trunklines within the city&#x27;s downtown from MDOT in January 2019; M-43 was rerouted out of the city as a result, following US 131 north from Oshtemo Township to Plainwell and M-89 from Plainwell southeasterly to Richland Township. The overlap with M-89 through Richland was removed, and the section of M-43 between Kalamazoo and Richland that remained in state control was renumbered M-343. Signage reflecting these changes was erected in August 2019.

==Major intersections==









==Business loop==

Business M-43 (Bus. M-43) was a business loop through the city of Grand Ledge. It ran east along Jefferson Street. The street curves to the southeast at a bend in the Grand River. M-100 merges in from the northeast at Bridge Street. The two highways ran concurrently south to Saginaw Highway. There, Bus. M-43 ended at the intersection with M-43 while M-100 continued south.

The business loop was created when M-43 was rerouted to a new roadway southwest of downtown Grand Ledge. This roadway opened on November 14, 1959, at which time the business loop was signed along the former route in town. In 1968, Bus. M-43 was decommissioned. The section not concurrent with M-100 was turned over to local control and removed from the state trunkline highway system.

<text>Little Houghton is a hamlet and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England. At the 2001 census it had a population of 618, increasing to 659 at the 2011 Census.

Access to the hamlet of Little Houghton is gained by travelling along Middlecliff Lane through the village of Middlecliffe. The larger village is made up of mainly council and ex-council houses.

Little Houghton was previously the site of two large coal mines. Houghton Main was a deep shaft mine and Dearne Valley a drift mine. Both mines are now closed and their sites have been landscaped, which has been partly funded by money from the European Union. Before the coal mines, the village was involved in agriculture and there were a number of farms in the village with associated cottages. Only two of the old farm buildings remain, but some have recently been converted into housing.

The two settlements come under Little Houghton Parish Council.

==Sports==
In September 2006, Houghton Main, the local village cricket team won the Village Cup Final, held at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground.

<text>Silkstone Common is a village in the metropolitan borough of Barnsley in South Yorkshire, England. It is to the south of Silkstone.

==History==
One of the most notable events in the history of the village was the Huskar Pit Disaster, which occurred on 4 July 1838 when a freak storm flooded part of the mine, killing 26 children; the youngest was 7 years, the oldest 17. A historical account of this event has been documented in the book entitled &quot;Children of the Dark&quot;.
In 1877, the South Yorkshire Coal and Iron Company built a planned housing development in southwest Silkstone Common called the South Yorkshire Buildings. The buildings are &quot;laid out in a regular pattern surrounded by small allotment gardens&quot; as opposed to &quot;the rest of the settlement, which consists of terraces strung out along existing roads&quot;.

==Transport==
Silkstone Common is served by the railway station of the same name, which opened in 1852. Silkstone Waggonway extends to Silkstone Common. There is also the Station Inn.

==Education==

The village has a Junior and Infants School. It is also in close proximity to Penistone Grammar School.

==Amenities==
Silkstone Common is home to a handful of pubs and shops, including the Cottage Bakery Shop.
The village has a Methodist Church.

Notable buildings include Knabb&#x27;s Hall which was built in late 17th century for William and Elizabeth Wood of Wortley Forge, and the Old Station House, a building located directly beside the railway line which once housed the railway owner but now functions as a residential building.

<text>Stairfoot is a ward in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England. It is perhaps so named because it lies at the bottom of a valley in between the undulations of two small hills on the old road from Barnsley to Doncaster. Stairfoot is surrounded by the villages of Kendray and Ardsley.

Stairfoot is known widely throughout South Yorkshire for its roundabout. Controlled by traffic signals, it is notorious for its delays to the local traffic system and has inspired a local song. The ward used to have its own railway station, but this closed in 1957 due to competition from local buses.

The area supports over 300 businesses, including retail outlets such as McDonald&#x27;s, Dunelm Mill and Tesco, along with various restaurants and convenience stores.

The Trans Pennine Trail also passes through Stairfoot using the old railway bridges which cross the roads leading to the roundabout, and the old railway bedding which has been mainly tarmacked. It is suitable for cyclists, pushchairs and wheelchair users, and some parts are open to horse riding.

==Hope Glass Works==
In 1867, Ben Rylands founded the Hope Glass Works at Stairfoot on what is now derelict land alongside the Aldi supermarket. During 1873, Rylands was heavily involved in perfecting the manufacture process for Hiram Codd&#x27;s new globe-stoppered mineral water bottle. Codd rewarded him with a licence to manufacture the bottle in April 1874 and the business took off. Orders for the new bottle were so good that Rylands could not meet demand from his original works, so work was commenced on a second factory on land that was occupied by Beatson Clark. Hiram Codd joined Ben Rylands in partnership at Stairfoot in May 1877.

In 1881, after four years together, Ben died leaving Codd to carry on the business alone. In 1882, Codd admitted Ben&#x27;s son, Dan Rylands as a business partner. Dan Rylands took over the partnership after his father&#x27;s death but this new alliance was doomed to failure, even though they patented &#x27;the crystal&#x27; (valve codd) in 1882. On October 6, 1884, probably resenting the young Rylands inventive intrusion, Hiram Codd allowed his partner to buy him out of the business and left to pursue other interests. The Hope Glass Works under the stewardship of Dan Rylands was now the largest factory of its kind in the world.

<text>The Indian XXXIV Corps was formed in March 1945 to be part of the British Fourteenth Army for Operation Zipper, the invasion of British Malaya. Significant formations under Fourteenth Army for &#x27;Zipper,&#x27; possibly under XXXIV Corps, included 5th Indian Division, 23rd Indian Division, 25th Indian Infantry Division, and 26th Indian Infantry Division.

Since Japan surrendered before the operation could be executed, the corps, under the command of Lieutenant-General Ouvry Roberts, did not see wartime service. It did, however, see occupation duty after the conflict was over.

XXXIV Corps was still active in September 1945 in Malaya, with HQ 2nd British Infantry Division, 25th Indian Division, 50th Indian Tank Brigade, and 150th Indian Infantry Brigade, which was en route to Hong Kong.

<doc id="759473" wikidata="Q3389408" url="?curid=759473" title="Pitt Stadium">
<text>Pitt Stadium was an outdoor athletic stadium in the eastern United States, located on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Opened in 1925, it served primarily as the home of the university&#x27;s Pittsburgh Panthers football team through 1999. It was also used for other sporting events, including basketball, soccer, baseball, track and field, rifle, and gymnastics.

Designed by University of Pittsburgh graduate W. S. Hindman, the $2.1 million stadium was built after the seating capacity of the Panthers&#x27; previous home, Forbes Field, was deemed inadequate in light of the growing popularity of college football. Pitt Stadium also served as the second home of the Pittsburgh Steelers, the city&#x27;s National Football League (NFL) franchise. After demolition, the Pittsburgh Panthers football team played home games at Three Rivers Stadium in 2000, before moving to the new Heinz Field (now Acrisure Stadium) in 2001, where the Panthers have played their home games ever since.

==History==
The Pittsburgh Panthers played home football games at the Pittsburgh Pirates&#x27; Forbes Field from 1909 to 1924. In the 1910s and 1920s, Pitt football achieved great success under head coach Glenn Scobey &quot;Pop&quot; Warner, completing several undefeated seasons and claiming several national championships. The popularity of college football was rising across the country and in Pittsburgh. Subsequently, due to tickets reserved for alumni and students, the general public&#x27;s demand for tickets to see Pitt play at Forbes Field surpassed supply. In the early 1920s, the university administration decided to build an on-campus stadium to alleviate the seating problem. It purchased nine acres of land adjacent to university property for the Pitt Stadium site; university and private funding provided $2.1 million for site acquisition and construction. W. S. Hindman, a Pitt graduate, was the stadium&#x27;s designer and engineer.
The Turner Construction Company built the stadium from August 7, 1924 to September 1, 1925. The venue was designed to hold a capacity of 69,400, with provisions for an upper deck that could provide for an additional 30,000 seats. On September 26, 1925, Pitt played its first football game at the new Pitt Stadium, a victory over Washington and Lee.

Starting in 1929, the stadium also hosted the football team of the Carnegie Tech Tartans, which played their home games there on a split schedule with the Panthers until 1943.

By the 1940s, new safety rules from the city fire marshal prohibited temporary bleacher seats on the rim of the stadium and in the track area. In order to provide comfort to larger spectators, the Department of Athletics also widened seats from , reducing the final capacity to The original grass surface was replaced with AstroTurf in 1970. SuperTurf was installed in 1984, but after six years AstroTurf returned. In the late 1970s, the original of wood seating was replaced with metal bleachers. Temporary lighting was installed at Pitt Stadium in 1985, but was made permanent before the 1987 season. A scoreboard was installed at the eastern end of the stadium in 1995; this was followed in 1997 with the installation of the &quot;PantherVision videoboard&quot;, which allowed fans to see instant replays of the games. The highest attended game was in 1938, when 68,918 saw the Panthers defeat Fordham on 

The NFL&#x27;s Steelers played home games at Forbes Field from their 1933 inception to 1957. They first played at Pitt Stadium in 1942, in an exhibition match for U.S.O. charity against the Fort Knox &quot;Armoraiders&quot; on November 15. From 1958 to 1963, the Steelers split home games between Forbes Field and Pitt Stadium. Fans were able to purchase season ticket packages for one site or the other. In 1964, the Steelers began to play home games exclusively at Pitt Stadium, which they continued until moving to the new Three Rivers Stadium in 1970. Of historic note, the iconic photo of New York Giants quarterback Y. A. Tittle, helmet-less, bloodied and kneeling, was taken at Pitt Stadium in 1964 following a Giants&#x27; loss to the Steelers on September 20. The photo, taken by &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; photographer Morris Berman, now hangs in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

In the late 1980s, then athletic director Ed Bozik unveiled a massive overhaul plan for Pitt Stadium that entailed gutting the stadium and rebuilding it from the ground up. In addition to luxury boxes, the $55 million renovation would have added a dome to the stadium.

By the mid-1990s, it was apparent that Pitt Stadium needed further renovations to keep up with the times. When the cost of the needed renovations proved prohibitive, athletic director Steve Pederson decided to demolish the stadium and replace it with a long-awaited convocation center and basketball arena on its footprint.
The final game at Pitt Stadium took place on November 13, 1999, when the Panthers defeated Notre Dame, 37–27. The final touchdown in Pitt Stadium was scored by Kevan Barlow at 7:06 pm, just minutes prior to fans rushing onto the field. Some of the 60,190 spectators—the largest crowd in 16 years—ran onto the field with nine seconds remaining in the game, tearing down both goal posts and removing pieces of turf. The Panthers played their home games of the 2000 season at Three Rivers Stadium, before moving to Heinz Field in 2001. Demolition of Pitt Stadium began in December 1999. Concrete from the stadium was ground and left on site for use in the Petersen Events Center and student housing which was built at the site; construction began in June 2000 and the Petersen Events Center opened up in April 2002.

===The Pitt Pavilion===
The Pitt Pavilion, located beneath the ramps inside Gate 2 of Pitt Stadium, was the home of the Panthers basketball team from January 6, 1925 (with a loss to Geneva College) to February 26, 1951 with a Backyard Brawl victory. The Pavilion contained both permanent and temporary bleachers for a capacity of approximately 4,000 spectators. However, with only one dressing room, visiting teams were forced to use the visitors&#x27; football locker room to dress and then walk 60-yards outdoors to get to the basketball court. Future coach John Wooden and Notre Dame&#x27;s Moose Krause were basketball stars that played against the Panthers at the Pavilion. While there, the Panthers themselves featured several All-Americans, including Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Charlie Hyatt, and recorded the school&#x27;s only undefeated season in 1928. On February 26, 1951, the Panthers won the final game at the Pavilion, defeating rival West Virginia 74-72 on a last-second shot by Scott Phillips, his only points in the game. The basketball team moved to the Fitzgerald Field House for the 1951-52 season. The Pavilion also hosted WPIAL playoff games and pre-season games of the American Basketball League&#x27;s Pittsburgh Rens. The Pitt Pavilion was removed in 1994 when ground was broken for the stadium&#x27;s Duratz Athletic Complex.

<doc id="759490" wikidata="Q1068037" url="?curid=759490" title="Chinatown, Sydney">
<text>Chinatown (; ) is an urban enclave situated in the southern part of the Sydney central business district, in New South Wales, Australia. It comprises the majority of the Haymarket suburb, between Central station and Darling Harbour. It is part of the local government area of the City of Sydney, and is Australia&#x27;s largest Chinatown.

Sydney, and the colony of New South Wales, experienced Chinese migration as early as 1828. The first group of Chinese labourers from Amoy (modern day Xiamen) embarked for New South Wales in 1848. With the discovery of gold in 1851 Chinese immigration increased, and by 1855 the number of Chinese immigrants reached around 17,000. The Chinese population had traditionally been represented by those who came from Southern China (i.e. provinces such as Guangdong and Fujian), due to the majority of colonial ports being located in the southern coast of China.

==History==

One of the many nationalities to arrive in Australia during the Gold Rush years of the 1850s were the Chinese, and large groups stayed on after the Gold Rush itself ended. They settled largely in their own communities, working in locations across Sydney, with many of these Chinese immigrants becoming market gardeners on the city&#x27;s fringe. By 1861 there were some 13,000 Chinese living in New South Wales, and during this time the Chinatown was in The Rocks district, also known as the &#x27;Chinese Quarter&#x27;. Anti-immigration sentiment was rife during the 1880s, and a Royal Commission into &quot;Alleged Chinese Gambling and Immorality&quot; began in 1892, due to the number of opium dens and brothels that were found in the area, similar to Melbourne&#x27;s Chinatown. This attitude of negativity towards the Chinese had settled down by the time of Federation in 1901. By the 1920s, Sydney&#x27;s Chinatown migrated over to Campbell Street, in the vicinity of the popular Capitol Theatre. 

Since 2019, Dixon Street and other intersecting streets are completely vehicle-free every Friday from 4pm, in order to host the Friday night markets. Different stalls selling Asian street food, desserts, and confectionery line the streets and alleyways, and the markets can become extremely busy.

== Location ==

=== Traditional boundaries ===
Officially, Chinatown does not have clearly defined borders, due to its continuous growth. The traditional core of the Haymarket Chinatown has been centred around Dixon Street, a pedestrian street mall with many Chinese restaurants, and with a paifang (a traditional Chinese gateway) at each end. At the eastern side, running parallel with Dixon Street, are Sussex Street and George Street, Sydney city&#x27;s main thoroughfare. Other streets and lanes within Sydney&#x27;s Chinatown include Factory Street, Goulburn Street, Little Hay Street, Kimber Lane and Thomas Street.

At the eastern end of Chinatown, at the corner of George Street and Hay Street, there is a sculpture made from a dead tree trunk; created by artist Lin Li in 1999 and named &quot;Golden Water Mouth&quot;. Its designer believed that it would bring good fortune to the Chinese community.

=== Recent expansion ===
The current location of modern day Chinatown is actually the third known area to have been considered a Chinatown. When Sydney&#x27;s produce market moved from what became the site of the Queen Victoria Building to the Belmore Markets, the Haymarket and Surry Hills areas became the focus for Sydney&#x27;s Chinese citizens. By the 1920s Chinatown began to consolidate at its current location.On Hay Street, the construction of The Peak Apartments, a residential skyscraper, in 1996 and the newly renovated Market City shopping complex built over the Paddy&#x27;s Market further consolidated Chinatown. Market City contains food courts with chain restaurants (such as Haidilao), an 800+ seat Dim Sum Restaurant (&quot;The Eight Modern Chinese Restaurant&quot;), boutique shops, City Amusements (a large indoor entertainment complex), and the Haymarket Paddy&#x27;s Markets, a Wednesday-to-Sunday produce and flea market. Likewise, the completion of Darling Square in late 2017 adjacent to Market City added multiple new apartment complexes and a plethora of new facilities and restaurants that fully integrated Chinatown into the urban core of Sydney.

Unlike the Chinatowns in some other countries, Sydney&#x27;s Chinatown has been relatively free of crime and hygiene issues. However, since there are many skyscrapers in Sydney, there are some concerns within the Chinese community about the building height restrictions imposed by the image-conscious local government authorities.

=== Suburbification ===
There are also satellite Chinatowns that have emerged in the past two decades in several Sydney suburbs such as Ashfield, Hurstville, Eastwood, Campsie, Parramatta, Chatswood, Burwood, Flemington and Kingsford. Each of these suburbs are increasingly diverse in that people from specific regions in China settle together in one suburb, traditionally known as an ethnic enclave. For example, Ashfield is known as &#x27;little Shanghai&#x27; whilst Hurstville has a high concentration of people from Hong Kong. However, Sydney&#x27;s Chinatown still remains both a social and cultural centre for the Chinese Australian community in Sydney as it continues to expand.

== Demographics ==

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in 2016 the Chinatown and Haymarket area included a significant population of Chinese (31.9%), Thai (18.3%), Indonesian (5.6%), English (5.1%) and Korean (4.8%) population. The most spoken languages at home apart from English were Thai (20.4%), Mandarin (20.3%), Indonesian (10.2%), Cantonese (5.1%), and Korean (4.8%). Furthermore, there is a significant student population from Asia, due to the close proximity of educational institutions such as the University of Technology Sydney, Technical and Further Education (TAFE NSW), and the University of Sydney. As of 2016, 25.9% of the residents in Chinatown were studying at university or TAFE and 33.4% of individuals in the Haymarket area had a attained a bachelor&#x27;s degree or above.

As a centrally located Chinatown (that is adjacent to, and being gradually absorbed by the growing central business district), there are many white collar workers. Out of the 65,950 workers in the surrounding area in 2017, 18% worked in finance &amp; financial services, 17% in the government, and 13.6% in professional &amp; business services. The median weekly household income in 2016 was $1,696, slightly above the national average of $1,659 in 2019.

==Chinese Garden of Friendship==

Sydney is the sister city of Guangzhou in China, and as a gift to Sydney during the Australian Bicentenary in 1988, the Chinese Garden of Friendship () was constructed west of Chinatown in the Darling Harbour precinct. The relationship between Sydney and Guangzhou (previously romanized as Canton), the capital of Guangdong province, is particularly strong because of trade and migration since the earliest days of colonisation. The agreement stipulated Guangdong would provide the design of the garden and key building materials, furniture and artworks that are intrinsic to the classic garden typology, while New South Wales would manage and fund its construction through the Darling Harbour Authority.
It is one of the few public traditional Chinese gardens outside of China and is a horticultural expression of a private garden and can also be classified as a scholar&#x27;s or classical garden. The gardens were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 October 2018. The garden hosts activities such as lessons on its history and design philosophy, landscape tours, school visits, wedding functions, koi fish feeding, among others.

==Bilingual street signs ==
There are many bilingual street signs across Chinatown, denoting the name of streets, lanes, and roads in both English and Chinese. Some of the names are based on their Cantonese pronunciation (e.g. Hay Street; 禧街 which is pronounced &quot;Hēi Gāai&quot; in Cantonese, but &quot;Xǐ Jiē&quot; in Mandarin&quot;) whilst others are based on their Mandarin pronunciation (e.g. Liverpool Street; 利物浦街 which is pronounced &quot;Lìwùpǔ Jiē&quot; in Mandarin, but &quot;Léihmáhtpóu Gāai&quot; in Cantonese). 

Some of these signs are accompanied by their official City of Sydney street signs. On the bottom of each of these signs, it reads, &quot;Welcome to Chinatown&quot; and &quot;歡迎光臨華埠&quot;.

<text>The Redskins were a 1980s English band, notable for their far left-wing politics, skinhead image and catchy, danceable songs. Their music combined influences from soul, rockabilly, pop and punk rock.

== History ==
The band formed in York, England in 1982 (from the demise of punk band No Swastikas), with Chris Dean (vocals/guitar), Martin Hewes (bass/backing vocals) and Nick King (drums). Chris Dean wrote for &quot;NME&quot; magazine under the name &quot;X. Moore&quot;. Dean and Hewes were members of the Socialist Workers Party. The band members wore skinhead clothing styles and helped inspire the redskin movement.

The band released their first single, &quot;Lev Bronstein&quot;, on the CNT record label in 1982. They released one more single, &quot;Lean on Me&quot;, on CNT before signing to London Records. &quot;Lean on Me&quot; was ranked at number 6 among the top ten &quot;Tracks of the Year&quot; for 1983 by &quot;NME&quot;.

On 10 June 1984, a group of white power skinheads attacked the band and their audience during a performance at the free GLC-sponsored &quot;Jobs for a Change&quot; festival at Jubilee Gardens, South Bank. In November 1984, an appearance on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Tube&quot; saw accusations of censorship after the band invited a striking miner on stage to deliver a speech during their performance, and his microphone connection was allegedly cut.

King was replaced in 1985 by Paul Hookham, although for the recording of the band&#x27;s first EMI/Decca single &quot;Bring it Down&quot;, Style Council drummer Steve White was brought in to perform. Shortly afterwards, Hookham took over full-time drum duties. Their next single, &quot;Kick Over The Statues&quot;, was rush-released on an independent label with an uncredited sleeve after London/Decca rejected its release as a benefit for the anti-apartheid movement. The band released one full album, &quot;Neither Washington Nor Moscow&quot;, and two final singles before splitting at the end of 1986.

<text>NBCNews.com, formerly known as msnbc.com, is a news website owned and operated by NBCUniversal as the online arm of NBC News. Along with original and wire reporting, it features content from NBC shows such as &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, &quot;Meet The Press&quot;, and &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;, the MSNBC cable channel, and partners such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

The site was founded in 1996 as a 50-50 venture between NBC and Microsoft at the same time as the two companies formed a separate joint venture for the cable news network MSNBC. Although they shared the same name, msnbc.com and MSNBC maintained separate corporate structures and news operations, with msnbc.com headquartered on the West Coast on the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Washington, and MSNBC in the NBC headquarters in New York. Microsoft divested its stake in the MSNBC channel in 2005, and divested its stake in msnbc.com in July 2012.

==History==

The site was established as msnbc.com in 1996 at the same time as the MSNBC cable news channel. Both were initially joint ventures with the software company Microsoft, with boards of directors composed of senior executives from Microsoft and NBC Universal. The MSNBC TV channel was based in New Jersey, and msnbc.com was based at Microsoft&#x27;s headquarters in Redmond, Washington. While NBC bought Microsoft&#x27;s stake in MSNBC in 2005, msnbc.com remained a partnership between the two companies, with MSNBC and msnbc.com remaining separate entities. Msnbc.com also acquired several other news websites, including community-driven news site Newsvine in October 2007, and the hyperlocal news site EveryBlock in August 2009. It also launched an internal start-up, BreakingNews.com.

Despite sharing its name with the MSNBC channel, the content of the two outlets had become increasingly distinct. While msnbc.com remained a traditional, nonpartisan news service with its own staff of journalists, the MSNBC channel now primarily carried liberal-leaning opinion-based programming covering U.S. politics. NBC&#x27;s staff were concerned about the differences, as some readers may have believed that the msnbc.com site was also a liberal-oriented news outlet like the channel. Plans were drafted to re-brand its conventional news site under a different name, such as NBCNews.com, and to re-purpose msnbc.com as a website for the MSNBC channel itself.

On July 14, 2012, NBCUniversal officially announced that Microsoft had sold back its half share of msnbc.com for $300 million. On the same day, NBC also announced the immediate renaming of msnbc.com to NBCNews.com, and the planned launch of a new website for MSNBC in 2013 that would focus on its programming and personalities. Despite the separation of msnbc.com from Microsoft, the site would still be a part of and receive traffic from Microsoft&#x27;s MSN.com portal. NBC shut down the three msnbc.com start-ups: Newsvine, Everyblock, and BreakingNews.

Gregory Gittrich, the former editor-in-chief of NBC Local Integrated Media and, before that, the assistant managing editor of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, was named vice president and executive editor of msnbc.com in October 2012, and began to sharply reduce the news staff, pulling back from doing original journalism online.
He reported to Vivian Schiller, former chief executive officer of National Public Radio. By 2014, with the msnbc.com staff greatly reduced, Gittrich was at Vocativ, with Schiller soon to join him as a consultant there.

=== 2014 redesign ===

On February 5, 2014, a major redesign of NBCNews.com was introduced; NBC News president Deborah Turness explained that the new design is intended to &quot;[tear] down the walls that traditionally have divided TV and digital&quot;, by emphasizing multimedia content, original features, and more original reporting from NBC News personalities. The new site uses a responsive design with an infinite scrolling grid of stories, along with new original features such as &quot;Know It All&quot;, &quot;The Debunker&quot;, and &quot;Show Me&quot;.

Reception to the new design was mixed, with criticism directed towards its image-oriented layout rather than a clearer, headline-oriented design; however, the redesign did result in a significant increase in traffic for the site, especially on mobile devices—which saw a 186% increase in traffic. Executive editor Gregory Gittrich admitted that the site&#x27;s staff members &quot;weren’t surprised by the initial feedback because the change was so significant, but that’s why the data and metrics were obviously important.&quot; Changes were made to the design to address these shortcomings, including the addition of dedicated areas with a listing of recent headlines, followed by an overhaul of the home page to use a more traditional layout, but still incorporating large images for major headlines.

==Ranking==

As of May 2009, NBCNews.com had ranked first in U.S. unique users among global news sites for 12 months in a row. In May it had 37.2 million unique users in the U.S. for the month, according to Nielsen/NetRatings. In second place was Yahoo! News with 35.8 million, then CNN with 34.4. At last count, NBCNews.com also served the most online video of any new site, with more than 125 million video streams in May 2008.

September 2014 rankings show NBCNews.com at number 7 among most popular news websites at 63 million unique visitors a month. Less than half of Yahoo! News (175M) and Google News (150M).

==Content==

NBCNews.com covers national and international news of general interest, using original and wire service reporting, as well as videos from the network&#x27;s television division, and partners including &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

A major focus is online content for the NBC News family of programming, including Today, NBC Nightly News, Dateline, Meet the Press, and programming on MSNBC television. This content includes blogs such as &quot;The Daily Nightly&quot;, a narrative of the broadcast day and a window into the editorial process at NBC Nightly News; &quot;First Read&quot;, analysis of the day&#x27;s political news from the NBC News Political Unit; &quot;allDAY&quot;, allowing viewers to see behind the scenes of Today; and Zeitgeist, a satirical video blog hosted by MSNBC&#x27;s Willie Geist. Original content from international correspondents and producers is posted on World News on NBCNews.com.

Video is distributed via the MSN Video service. Additionally, the website provides stock quotes through MSN Money, weather forecasts through Weather.com, RSS feeds, podcasts, and netcasts of the network&#x27;s broadcasts. Following the introduction of CNN&#x27;s iReport concept, NBCNews.com also introduced a citizen journalism section titled &quot;First Person&quot;. The section allows viewers to upload video, photos and stories in response to suggested topics.

In 2017, NBCNews.com introduced new verticals such as &quot;Mach&quot;, which covers science and technology, and &quot;Better&quot;, with health and life tips, along with a digital opinion section called &quot;THINK&quot;.

==Recognition==
As the former msnbc.com, the site won several journalism and online publishing awards, including the Society of Professional Journalists award for online investigative reporting, Online News Association&#x27;s Online Journalism Award for General Excellence and Best Use of Multiple Media; National Press Club&#x27;s Best Journalism Site; for its coverage of Hurricane Katrina, &quot;Rising from Ruin&quot;, and the Best in Business Award from the Society of American Business Editors and Writers and Best Use of Multiple Media.

<doc id="759522" wikidata="Q269192" url="?curid=759522" title="London Library">
<text>The London Library is an independent lending library in London, established in 1841. It was founded on the initiative of Thomas Carlyle, who was dissatisfied with some of the policies at the British Museum Library. It is located at 14 St James&#x27;s Square, in the St James&#x27;s area of the City of Westminster, which has been its home since 1845. Membership is open to all, on payment of an annual subscription, and life and corporate memberships are also available. As of December 2023 the Library had around 7,500 members.

T. S. Eliot, a long-serving President of the Library, argued in July 1952 in an address to members that, &quot;whatever social changes come about, the disappearance of the London Library would be a disaster to civilisation&quot;.

==Trustees and governance==
The London Library is a self-supporting, independent institution. It is a registered charity whose sole aim is the advancement of education, learning, and knowledge. It was incorporated by Royal Charter on 13 June 1933, with a supplemental Royal Charter granted on 21 October 1988. On 6 July 2004, Elizabeth II granted the Library a new Royal Charter, which revoked both the 1933 and 1968 charters. It has its own byelaws and the power to make or amend its rules. It has a royal patron, an elected president and vice presidents, and is administered by an elected board of a maximum of 15 trustees, including the Chairman and the Treasurer.

==History==

The chief instigator in the Library&#x27;s foundation was Thomas Carlyle. He had become frustrated by the facilities available at the British Museum Library, where he was often unable to find a seat (obliging him to perch on ladders), where he complained that the enforced close confinement with his fellow readers gave him a &quot;museum headache&quot;, where the books were unavailable for loan, and where he found the library&#x27;s collections of pamphlets and other material relating to the French Revolution and English Civil Wars inadequately catalogued. In particular, he developed an antipathy for the Keeper of Printed Books, Anthony Panizzi (despite the fact that Panizzi had allowed him many privileges not granted to other readers), and criticised him, as the &quot;respectable Sub-Librarian&quot;, in a footnote to an article published in the &quot;Westminster Review&quot;. Carlyle&#x27;s eventual solution, with the support of a number of influential friends, was to call for the establishment of a private subscription library from which books could be borrowed.
The Earl of Clarendon was the Library&#x27;s first President, William Makepeace Thackeray its first auditor, and William Gladstone and Sir Edward Bunbury sat on the first committee. The Belgian freedom fighter and former Louvain librarian Sylvain Van de Weyer was a vice-president from 1848 to 1874. (Van de Weyer&#x27;s father-in-law Joshua Bates was a founder of the Boston Public Library in 1852.)

A vigorous and long-serving presence in later Victorian times was Richard Monckton-Milnes, later Lord Houghton, a friend of Florence Nightingale. Charles Dickens was among the founder members. In more recent times, Kenneth Clark and T. S. Eliot have been among the Library&#x27;s presidents, and Sir Harold Nicolson, Sir Rupert Hart-Davis and the Hon Michael Astor have been Chairmen.

(Sir) Charles Hagberg Wright, who served as Secretary and Librarian from 1893 to 1940, is remembered as &quot;the real architect of the London Library as it is today&quot;. He oversaw the rebuilding of its premises in the 1890s, the re-cataloguing and rearrangement of its collections under its own unique classification system, and the publication of its catalogue in 1903, with a second edition in 1913–14 and later supplements.

In 1957 the Library received an unanticipated demand from Westminster City Council for business rates (despite being registered as a tax-free charity), and the Inland Revenue also became involved. At that time, most publishers donated free copies of their books to the library. A final appeal was turned down by the Court of Appeal in 1959, and a letter in &quot;The Times&quot; of 5 November from the President and Chairman (T. S. Eliot and Rupert Hart-Davis) appealed for funds. A subsequent letter from Winston Churchill commented that &quot;The closing of this most worthy institution would be a tragedy&quot;. Financial donations reached £17,000, and an auction of books, manuscripts and artworks on 22 June 1960 raised over £25,000 – enough to clear debts and legal expenses of £20,000. At the sale some T. E. Lawrence items donated by his brother fetched £3,800, Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; fetched £2,800, and Lytton Strachey&#x27;s &quot;Queen Victoria&quot; £1,800, though 170 inscribed books and pamphlets from John Masefield fetched only £200, which Hart-Davis thought &quot;shamefully little&quot;. Queen Elizabeth II donated a book from Queen Victoria&#x27;s library, and the Queen Mother a Sheffield plate wine cooler.

In the 1990s, the Library was one of a number of academic and specialist libraries targeted by serial book thief William Jacques. The identification of several rare books put up for auction as having been stolen from the Library led the police to investigate Jacques and to his eventual prosecution and conviction. Security measures at the Library have since been improved.

==Collections==
The Library&#x27;s collections, which range from the 16th century to the present day, are strong within the fields of literature, fiction, fine and applied art, architecture, history, biography, philosophy, religion, topography, and travel. The social sciences are more lightly covered. Pure and natural sciences, technology, medicine and law are not within the library&#x27;s purview, although it has some books in all of those fields; books on their histories are normally acquired. Periodicals and annuals on a wide range of subjects are also held in the collections. Special collections include subjects of hunting, field sports, Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, and of Jewish interest.

The Library now holds more than one million items, and each year, it acquires approximately 8,000 new books and periodicals. 97% of the collection is available for loan, either on-site or through the post. It is the largest lending library in Europe. Members play a central role in the selection and development of the collections, bequeathing their personal libraries, donating copies of their own books, serving on the Books Selection Committee, making suggestions for acquisition and more.

The Library also subscribes to many ejournals and other online databases. All post-1950 acquisitions are searchable on the on-line catalogue, and pre-1950 volumes are progressively being added as part of the Retrospective Cataloguing Project.

95% of the collection is housed on open shelves (the remaining 5% includes rare books held in secure storage). This open access policy – which contrasts with that in many other large libraries, including the British Library – is greatly valued by members. Colin Wilson remembered his first visit to the library in the mid 1960s: &quot;I have always had an obsession about books, and in this place I felt like a sex maniac in the middle of a harem&quot;. Arthur Koestler recorded how in 1972, commissioned to report on the Spassky–Fischer chess championship in Reykjavík, he visited the Library to carry out some background research:
Peter Parker wrote in 2008:
And Roger Kneebone wrote in 2015:
In 1944, the Library lost some 16,000 volumes to bomb damage, and in 1970 its few incunabula were sold. With those exceptions, it was formerly library policy to retain virtually all items acquired since its foundation, on the grounds that, as books are never entirely superseded, and therefore never redundant, the collections should not be weeded of material merely because it was old, idiosyncratic or unfashionable. In 2019, under pressure for space, the decision was taken to reverse this policy, and to introduce a new strategy of withdrawing from the collections some journal and government publication material now available online, some foreign language journals, duplicate copies of books, and other material considered obsolete; and also to move some low-use material to off-site storage.

==Buildings==
Following its foundation in 1841, the Library spent four years occupying rooms on the first floor of 49 Pall Mall. In 1845 it moved to 14 St James&#x27;s Square, and this site has been its home ever since. However, its premises have undergone a considerable number of changes and extensions over the years as the collections have grown.

The property in St James&#x27;s Square first occupied by the Library was a house, Beauchamp House, built in 1676 and renovated at later dates. A proposal in the 1770s (when it was owned by Lord Newhaven) to rebuild it to a design by Robert Adam was abandoned, but it was refronted shortly afterwards. It was located in the north-west corner of the square, and had a much smaller frontage than its neighbours, being described by A. I. Dasent in 1895 as &quot;admittedly the worst house in the Square&quot;. The Library rented the house from 1845, but in 1879 bought the freehold. In the early years, to defray costs, some of the rooms were let to the Statistical Society of London, the Philological Society, and the Institute of Actuaries.

In 1896–1898 the premises were completely rebuilt to the designs of James Osborne Smith, and this building survives as the front part of the present library complex. The facade, overlooking St James&#x27;s Square, is constructed in Portland stone in a broadly Jacobethan style, described by the Survey of London as &quot;curiously eclectic&quot;. The main reading room is on the first floor; and above this three tall windows light three floors of bookstack. Another four floors of bookstacks were built to the rear. In 1920–22, an additional seven-storey bookstack was built further back still, again designed by Osborne Smith. (This new stack was notable for its opaque glass floors: an unforeseen drawback of the combination of glass floors and structural metal shelving was that browsers in the stacks were liable to receive periodic jolts of static electricity, a problem which continues to catch new members unawares, and for which no solution has ever been found.) In 1932–34 another extension was carried out to the north, incorporating a committee room (named the Prevost Room, after a major benefactor; now converted to use as a reading room), an Art Room, and five more floors of bookstacks: the architects on this occasion were the firm of Mewès &amp; Davis.

In February 1944, during the Second World War, the northern bookstacks suffered considerable damage when the Library suffered a direct hit from a bomb: 16,000 volumes were destroyed, including most of the Biography section. Although the library reopened in July, repairs to the buildings were not completed until the early 1950s.

Following the war, the Library continued to experience a need for increased space, although the practical possibilities for expansion were limited. A mezzanine was inserted within the Art Room in the early 1970s; four floors of bookstack were constructed above the north bay of the reading room in 1992; and in 1995 the Anstruther Wing (named after its benefactor, Ian Anstruther) was erected at the extreme rear of the site, a nine-storey building on a small footprint designed principally to house rare books storage.
In 2004, the Library acquired Duchess House, a four-storey 1970s office building adjoining the north side of the existing site, which increased overall capacity by 30%. The building was renamed T. S. Eliot House in 2008. The opportunity was taken for a major rationalisation and overhaul of the greater part of the library&#x27;s premises. Staff activities were concentrated in T. S. Eliot House (freeing up space in the older buildings for book storage and members&#x27; facilities); a new reading room was inserted in a lightwell; the Art Room was completely restructured and redesigned; the main Issue Hall remodelled; new circulation routes created; and other alterations made elsewhere. The first phase of work, the modification and refurbishment of T. S. Eliot House, was completed in 2007; and the second phase in 2010. The architects for the redevelopment were Haworth Tompkins with Price &amp; Myers acting as consulting structural engineers; while the toilets were designed in collaboration with Turner Prize-winning artist Martin Creed.

The building has been listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England since February 1958.

==Subscription==
In 1903 the annual membership subscription was £3. During the 1930s it was £4 4s and fees remained at this level into the 1950s. In November 1981 the annual subscription was £60. Following the acquisition of T. S. Eliot House, from 2008 the subscription was significantly increased from £210 to £375. As of September 2024 the annual fee for standard membership is £615.

==Awards and competitions==
In 2011 the Library launched its Student Prize, a writing competition open to final-year undergraduates at higher education institutions in the UK. The theme was &quot;The future of Britain lies with the right-hand side of the brain&quot;, and the winner was announced in March 2012 as Ben Mason, a student at Trinity College, Oxford. The prize was awarded for a second time in 2013 to Kathryn Nave, a student at King&#x27;s College London, but has now been discontinued.

==175th anniversary==
In May 2016 the Library marked the 175th anniversary of its foundation with a three-day literary festival, &quot;Words In The Square&quot;, held in St James&#x27;s Square. It was organised by James Runcie and David Kynaston, and speakers included the novelists Sebastian Faulks, Victoria Hislop, Nick Hornby, Philippa Gregory and Elif Safak; historians Antony Beevor, Simon Schama and Jerry White; actors Simon Russell Beale, Eleanor Bron and Simon Callow; and former England cricket captains Michael Atherton and Mike Brearley.

<text>Donk! Samurai Duck! is a video game featuring a duck named Donk, who was raised by samurai warriors. To prove himself he has set off to collect crystals from 112 levels of earth. Once the target quota of gems has been reached, Donk escape from each level through one of its many exits, giving the game a similar structure to &quot;Alien Breed: Tower Assault&quot;. Magical powers can be collected along the way, including the ability to turn into an inflatable toy duck, which makes it possible to float across water. There is a simultaneous split-screen 2-player mode included as well.

==Development==
The game was originally going to be released with the title &quot;Dong&quot;, but the British developers did not want to cause offence as the word can mean &quot;penis&quot; in English speaking countries. The name was changed at the last moment to &quot;Donk&quot;. Some demo versions distributed on Amiga cover disks still bore the name &quot;Dong&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 2006-2007, there was an attempt to port the game to the Dreamcast involving the original creators of &quot;Donk!&quot;. The project was never completed.

<text>Mōkōlea Rock is an islet in Kailua Bay along the windward coast of Oahu in Hawaii and located east of Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH). Like most of the small islets off the coastline of a major island in the Hawaiian Islands, Mōkōlea is a State Bird Sanctuary containing many types of birds. Access to the islet requires a permit, and is only allowed to people involved in protecting the islet&#x27;s fauna. The islet is more commonly known to local residents as &quot;Birdshit Island&quot;, &quot;Birdshit&quot;, or simply &quot;Bird&quot; because its black lava rock surface is heavily coated with bird droppings. 
There is no vegetation on the islet, which is actually three connected outcroppings, the highest of which is no more than above mean sea level. All three consist of barren, jagged lava. Mokolea is part of the windward rim of the Kawainui volcanic caldera. About from this outcropping on the side facing Kailua Beach a shelf juts up from deep water to a depth of . The shelf is a moderately interesting spot for scuba diving, although much of the time the area is rough, and anchoring a boat is difficult.

Mokolea has been described as a shore dive by some, but it should not be attempted from the shore due to strong currents and the distance between the dive spot and Kailua Beach.

<doc id="759549" wikidata="Q708934" url="?curid=759549" title="A. C. Benson">
<text>Arthur Christopher Benson, (24 April 1862 – 17 June 1925) was an English essayist, poet and academic, and the 28th Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge. He wrote the lyrics of Edward Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Coronation Ode&quot;, including the words of the patriotic song &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; (1902). His literary criticism, poems, and volumes of essays were highly regarded. He was also noted as an author of ghost stories.

==Early life and family==
Benson was born on 24 April 1862 at Wellington College, Berkshire, as one of six children of Edward White Benson (1829–1896), the first headmaster of the college, who would later be Archbishop of Canterbury from 1883 to 1896. His mother, Mary Sidgwick Benson, was a sister of the philosopher Henry Sidgwick.

Benson&#x27;s literary family included his brothers Edward Frederic Benson, best remembered for his &quot;Mapp and Lucia&quot; novels, and Robert Hugh Benson, a priest of the Church of England before converting to Roman Catholicism, who wrote many popular novels. Their sister Margaret Benson was an artist, author, and amateur Egyptologist.

Though exceptionally accomplished, the Benson family met tragic times: a son and daughter died young, while another daughter and Arthur himself suffered from a mental condition that may have been bipolar disorder or manic-depressive psychosis, seemingly inherited from their father. None of the children married.

Despite his illness, Arthur was to become a distinguished academic and a prolific author. From the ages of 10 to 21, he lived in cathedral closes, first at Lincoln where his father was Chancellor of Lincoln Cathedral, and then at Truro, where his father was the first Bishop of Truro. He retained a love of church music and ceremony.

In 1874 he won a scholarship to Eton from Temple Grove School, a preparatory school in East Sheen. In 1881 he went up to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he was a scholar (King&#x27;s College had closed scholarships for which only Etonians were eligible) and achieved first-class honours in the Classical tripos in 1884.

==Career==
From 1885 to 1903 Benson taught at Eton, but returned to Cambridge in 1904 as a Fellow of Magdalene College to lecture in English Literature. He became president of the college (the Master&#x27;s deputy) in 1912, and he was Master of Magdalene (head of the college) from December 1915 until his death in 1925. From 1906, he was a governor of Gresham&#x27;s School.
The modern development of Magdalene was shaped by Benson, as a generous benefactor with a marked impact on the appearance of the college grounds; he appears in at least 20 inscriptions around the college. In 1930, the new Benson Court was named after him.

Benson worked with Lord Esher in editing the correspondence of Queen Victoria, which appeared in 1907. His poems and essay volumes, such as &quot;From a College Window&quot; and &quot;The Upton Letters&quot; (essays in the form of letters) were famous in his time; and he left one of the longest diaries ever written: some four million words. His literary criticisms of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward FitzGerald, Walter Pater and John Ruskin rank among his best work.

Benson wrote the lyrics of the &quot;Coronation Ode&quot;, set to music by Edward Elgar for the coronation of Edward VII and Alexandra in 1902. It has as its finale one of Britain&#x27;s best-known patriotic songs, &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot;.

==Ghost stories==

Like his brothers Edward Frederic and Robert Hugh, Benson was noted as an author of ghost stories. The bulk of them, in two volumes, &quot;The Hill of Trouble and Other Stories&quot; (1903) and &quot;The Isles of Sunset&quot; (1904), were written for his pupils as moral allegories. After Arthur&#x27;s death, Fred Benson found a collection of unpublished ghost stories and included two in a book, &quot;Basil Netherby&quot; (1927). The title story was renamed &quot;House at Treheale&quot; and the volume completed by a long piece, &quot;The Uttermost Farthing&quot;, but the fate of the other stories is unknown.

&quot;Paul the Minstrel and Other Stories&quot; (1911, reprinted 1977) collects the contents of &quot;The Hill of Trouble and Other Stories&quot; and &quot;The Isles of Sunset&quot;. Nine of Arthur&#x27;s ghost stories are included in David Stuart Davies (ed.), &quot;The Temple of Death: The Ghost Stories of A. C. &amp; R. H. Benson&quot; (Wordsworth, 2007), together with seven by his brother R. H. Benson, while nine of Arthur&#x27;s and ten of Robert&#x27;s appear in &quot;Ghosts in the House&quot; (Ash-Tree, 1996) – the contents of the joint collections are similar but not identical.

==Views==
In &quot;The Schoolmaster&quot;, Benson summarised his views on education after 18 years&#x27; experience at Eton. He criticised a trend he found prevalent in English public schools, to &quot;make the boys good and to make them healthy&quot; to the detriment of their intellectual development.

A Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, he founded the Benson Medal in 1916 &quot;in respect of meritorious works in poetry, fiction, history and belles lettres&quot;.

==Death==

A. C. Benson died of cardiac arrest at Magdalene and was buried at St Giles&#x27;s Cemetery in Cambridge.

==Critical reception==
Horror critic R. S. Hadji included Benson&#x27;s &quot;Basil Netherby&quot; on a list of &quot;unjustly neglected&quot; horror books.

Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch included Benson&#x27;s poem &quot;The Phoenix&quot; in the first and second editions of &quot;The&quot; &quot;Oxford Book of English Verse&quot;.

<text>The Japan national rugby union team, also known as the Cherry Blossoms, the Brave Blossoms (), or simply Sakura, represents Japan in men&#x27;s international rugby union. Japan is traditionally the strongest rugby union power in Asia and has enjoyed and endured mixed results against non-Asian teams over the years. Rugby union in Japan is administered by the Japan Rugby Football Union (JRFU), which was founded in 1926. They compete annually in the Pacific Nations Cup (PNC) and previously in the Asia Rugby Championship (ARC). They have also participated in every Rugby World Cup (RWC) since the tournament began in 1987, and hosted the event in 2019.

Rugby was first played in Japan&#x27;s treaty ports as early as 1866. Popular participation by local university teams was established in 1899 and Japan&#x27;s first recorded international match was a match against a Canadian team in 1932. Notable games for Japan include a victory over the Junior All Blacks in 1968, and a narrow 6–3 loss to England in 1971. Famous wins by Japan include a 28–24 victory over a Scotland XV in 1989 and a 23–8 victory over Wales in 2013. In 2011, Japan displayed its progress by winning the 2011 IRB Pacific Nations Cup, played against Fiji, Samoa and Tonga. Further progress was displayed in 2014 when Japan completed a string of ten consecutive test wins (a record for a tier 2 team) to rank in the world&#x27;s top 10 teams. This continued into 2015 where they produced the first of their three biggest upsets when, in a Rugby World Cup pool match against South Africa, they won 34–32.

In the years between, Japan faced quality opposition, playing relatively well with solid results including a tie against France, and a narrow loss to Wales at Cardiff. Their second shock win was a 19–12 defeat of world number-two ranked Ireland in a 2019 Rugby World Cup pool game. Emerging undefeated from the tournament&#x27;s pool stage after a 28–21 victory over Scotland, Japan made their first-ever World Cup quarter-final appearance, going down 3–26 to eventual world champions South Africa.

==History==
The first recorded instance of a team being established and rugby being played in Japan was in 1866 with the founding of the Yokohama Foot Ball Club. Games, mainly between service personnel, were played on the Garrison Parade Ground in Yamate, Yokohama. In 1874 records also illustrate British sailors staging a game in Yokohama. Other games were played at other treaty ports such as Kobe between teams of long-term foreign residents and visiting ships&#x27; crews and garrisons, but they rarely involved Japanese players. The date of local Japanese participation in the sport is most frequently cited as 1899, when students at Keio University were introduced to the game by Professor Edward Bramwell Clarke and Ginnosuke Tanaka both graduates of Cambridge University.

The formation of a national team and effectively Japan&#x27;s first international match took place in Osaka on 31 January 1932 when a trade delegation from Canada to Japan supported an overseas tour by the Canada national rugby union team. The Japanese won this first match 9–8. In a second test match in Tokyo 11 days later again the Japanese side beat the Canadians 38–5.

Japan beat the Junior All Blacks 23–19 in 1968 after losing the first four matches on a tour of New Zealand, but they won the last five. The Japanese (coached by Tetsunosuke Onishi, a professor of Waseda University) lost by just 3–6 to England in Tokyo on 29 September 1971 in the RFU&#x27;s centenary year. The 1973 Japan rugby union tour of Wales, England and France was less successful with the side winning only two of their eleven matches, and losing the international matches against Wales and France. Ten years later Japan gave Wales a fright in losing by a slim five-point margin, 24–29, at Cardiff Arms Park on 2 October 1983.

On 28 May 1989, a strong Japan coached by Hiroaki Shukuzawa defeated an uncapped Scotland, missing nine British Lions on tour in Australia, for the first time at Chichibunomiya Rugby Stadium, 28–24. The Japan team included such Kobe Steel stalwarts as centre Seiji Hirao (captain), and locks Atsushi Oyagi and Toshiyuki Hayashi (38 Japan caps and a member of Oxford University&#x27;s all-time best XV). Sinali Latu at No. 8 was then a fourth year student at Daito Bunka University, and speedy Yoshihito Yoshida on the wing (no. 14) was a third year at Meiji University. Scotland missed an incredible seven penalties and refused the kicking tee which was generously offered – as a surviving video of the game shows. It was almost the same Japanese team which defeated Zimbabwe in RWC1991.

===Under Shogo Mukai (2001–2003)===
After Hirao resigned, Toshiba Brave Lupus coach Shogo Mukai was appointed in March 2001 to lead Japan up to the 2003 Rugby World Cup. After mixed fortunes in his first two years in charge, Japan put in some impressive performances at the tournament with good efforts against and , nevertheless they still left the tournament having failed to reach their target of winning some matches but still won admirers for their exciting brand of play. Mukai left his post after the tournament to spend more time with his family.

===Under Mitsutake Hagimoto (2004–2005)===
After Shogo Mukai left after the 2003 Rugby World Cup, the JRFU initially tried to appoint Eddie Jones from his post with but were unsuccessful and instead appointed Mitsutake Hagimoto in March 2004 after he won the inaugural Top League with the Kobelco Steelers. Under Hagimoto, Japan decided they would not select foreign born players after Mukai had been criticised for playing too many at the World Cup.

Hagimoto&#x27;s first match in charge was a disappointing draw with , but his first few matches in charge after that were promising with wins over and to win the Super Powers Cup and pushed close losing 32–19.

However, in November 2004, Japan went on a disastrous tour to Europe where they were embarrassingly thrashed 100–8 by and 98–0 by and also were comfortably defeated by . Japan&#x27;s performances were described as &quot;pathetic&quot;, and the squad was called &quot;a joke&quot; with some key players ignored or not given permission to travel.

This disastrous tour forced a rethink from Hagimoto and foreign born players were brought back into the side in 2005, but after losing twice to in June he was sacked and with just 5 wins from 15 matches was the least successful coach for Japan in the professional era.

===Under Jean-Pierre Élissalde (2005–2006)===
After Hagimoto left his post at the end of June 2005, Jean-Pierre Élissalde who had been appointed backs coach three months earlier took full charge and became the first foreigner to be the head coach for Japan. His first match in charge was a 44–29 win over in November 2005.

In 2006, despite a disappointing campaign in the inaugural Pacific Nations Cup in June where Japan lost all their matches, and also lost to heavily to 52–6, Élissalde was backed to lead the side to the 2007 Rugby World Cup. But Élissalde was later sacked in September after he took on a job with Bayonne without consulting the JRFU and then refused to give up his job with them. Assistant coach Osamu Ota took over as caretaker coach for two Rugby World Cup qualifiers in November 2006.

===Under John Kirwan (2007–2011)===
John Kirwan was appointed head coach on in October 2006 after Elissalde was sacked. He initially worked as an advisor to caretaker coach Osamu Ota before taking over the job completely in 2007.

After starting with large wins over the Asian opposition, Japan only won one of their remaining 10 fixtures in 2007, although in the 2007 Rugby World Cup they did gain a draw with a last minute touchline conversion from Shotaro Onishi against Canada to end a long losing streak of World Cup matches stretching back to 1991.

Results began to pick up after the 2007 World Cup and Kirwan led Japan up to a high of 13th in the IRB Rankings and to win their first ever Pacific Nations Cup title in 2011 after they beat away for the first ever time in Japan&#x27;s history.

However, despite more positive results in between World Cups, Japan had a disappointing 2011 Rugby World Cup, losing 31–18 to who they had beaten four times in a row since 2008, and drawing again to who they had beaten 46–8 and 27–6 in 2009, and Japan left the World Cup winless meaning they still had not won a match at the tournament since 1991. Kirwan came under pressure after the tournament and he resigned from his post after his contract came to the end at the end of the year.

The tenure of Kirwan as coach was notable for a large number of imports he selected. Players who originated from New Zealand such as James Arlidge, Bryce Robins, Shaun Webb, Ryan Nicholas, Luke Thompson or Tonga such as Alisi Tupuailei and Sione Vatuvei all featured prominently under Kirwan. The large percentage of foreigners in the national team also caused criticism for Kirwan. However, despite failing to bring Japan a World Cup win, Kirwan left his post as the most successful Japan coach of the professional era with a win rate of 58.18% from 55 matches.

===Under Eddie Jones (2012–2015)===
Kirwan chose not to renew his contract as head coach when it expired at the end of 2011, and the Japan Rugby Football Union announced that former Australia coach Eddie Jones would be his successor. Jones stated that his intention was to take the Japanese national team into the top 10 on the international rankings, and that they must develop a style of play to allow them to win games against teams such as Scotland.

Jones made his debut as Japan head coach against Kazakhstan. He had selected a total of 10 uncapped players out of the 22 selected players. They went on to win the match 87–0. They then had a big win over United Arab Emirates where young 18-year-old Yoshikazu Fujita set a new Asian Five Nations record for the most tries in a single match with a total of 6. This was also Fujita&#x27;s international debut.

In 2013, Jones led Japan to their sixth consecutive championship win in the Asian Five Nations, where Japan achieved a tournament record score of 121–0 against the Philippines. In May, the nation lost their opening match of the 2013 IRB Pacific Nations Cup to Tonga, followed by a defeat to Fiji in the second round. Following these matches, Japan faced a 2-test series against Wales. Japan lost narrowly, 18–22, in the first test, but won the second test 23–8, and the series ended in a 1–1 draw. This was the first time that Japan had recorded a victory over the Welsh.

On 16 October 2013, Jones was hospitalised after having a suspected stroke and was released from hospital 2 days later on 18 October 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.abc.net&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After his release from hospital, it was announced that Jones would miss Japan&#x27;s 2013 end-of-year rugby union tests against New Zealand, Scotland, Gloucester, Russia and Spain, and former Australia skills coach and current technical adviser for Japan Scott Wisemantel would interim coach Japan for their 2013 end-of-year rugby union tests.
On 19 September 2015, Japan stunned South Africa by a last minute try from Karne Hesketh to win 34–32 in their opening group pool game at the 2015 Rugby World Cup in Brighton, England. BBC reported the win as &quot;arguably the biggest upset in rugby union history&quot;. In 2015, Japan became the first team in World Cup history to win three pool games but still be eliminated at the group stage, due to their heavy loss to Scotland.

===Under Jamie Joseph (2016–2023)===
Jamie Joseph, former coach of New Zealand&#x27;s Highlanders Super Rugby team and the Māori All Blacks, took over as head coach for Japan (and the Sunwolves Super Rugby team) in 2016. In the 2017 Asia Rugby Championship, Japan sealed their twelfth consecutive Asia Rugby Championship, winning all four games. They went on to defeat Romania 33–21 in the 2017 June rugby union tests, but lost to Ireland 2–0, during their first test series since 2005, losing the first test 50–22 and the second 35–13. In November 2017, Joseph led his side to a single win and a draw in four games. They started their End-of-year series with two consecutive home losses, a 27–47 loss to a World XV side and a 30–63 loss to Australia. Japan&#x27;s first win came against Tonga 39–6 in Toulouse, France, before going on to draw with France 23–23, which was the first time that these two nations had drawn with one another.

During the 2018 June tests, Joseph led Japan to a 1–all series draw with Italy, winning the first test 34–17, and losing the second 25–22. The team then beat Georgia 28–0 at the Toyota Stadium.

In 2019, Japan won the Pacific Nations Cup with wins against Fiji, Tonga and the United States, with no losses.

Japan hosted the Rugby World Cup in 2019, and the team repeated their feat of a shock win in Brighton at the 2015 World Cup, this time beating world No. 2-ranked Ireland 19–12 at Shizuoka Stadium in Fukuroi, Shizuoka They reached the quarter-finals for the first time in the team&#x27;s history after beating Scotland 28–21 at the International Stadium Yokohama in Yokohama that was battered by Typhoon Hagibis only the night before.

==Kits==
Japan traditionally plays with white and red hooped shirts (with white collar and cuffs) with a Sakura embroidered on the chest, paired with white shorts and white socks with red splashes. Between 2003 and 2011, the shirt was predominantly red with two white parallel hoops on the chest with white accents, sometimes with black or navy socks and shorts.

Since its first test against Canada in 1930, Japan played with the traditional hooped red and white shirts, the emblem on the shirt originally depicted the Sakura as &quot;bud, half-open and full-bloomed&quot;. The current version of the emblem, depicting three full-bloomed Sakura, was dated 1952, when Japan played against Oxford University XV at Hanazono, Higashi-Osaka, on 1 October 1952.

On 4 July 2019 the Japan Rugby Football Union on Thursday unveiled the national team&#x27;s jersey for this year&#x27;s Rugby World Cup, the shirt featuring a samurai helmet motif representing the tradition of Japan&#x27;s warrior spirit. The combination of Samurai and Sakura (Cherry Blossom) has long been linked in Japanese culture.

The away kit usually consist of a navy blue uniform, white or navy shorts and navy blue socks, sometimes with white collar or panels, or black.
The kit supplier since 1997 is Canterbury. Before that, the kits were manufactured by Japanese company Sceptre between 1987 and 1995 and in 1982, by Suzuki Sports.
Currently, the jersey sponsors are Lipovitan D (in the front) and Toshiba (in the back). Previously, between 1997 and 2001, the shirt sponsor was Japan Telecom.

Despite this, they experienced little success until the 2015 tournament, with just one victory over Zimbabwe in 1991, and two draws with Canada in 2007 and 2011. In 2015 they defeated South Africa with a score of 34–32, their first win since 1991 against Zimbabwe, which they followed up with victories over Samoa and the United States in the same pool stage, but despite their 3–1 record failed to reach the knockout round.

They were the home team for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, which was held in Japan.

In the 2019 World Cup, Japan were drawn in Group A alongside Ireland, Russia, Samoa, and Scotland. After a nervy opening night win against Russia (30–10), Japan went on to beat Ireland 19–12, a huge upset and a result few predicted. Their third group game against Samoa ended in another win, this time 38–19, while also securing a highly important bonus point (for scoring four or more tries).

In the highly anticipated final group game against Scotland, both teams needed to win to progress to the knockout stages at the expense of the other. The match went ahead despite pre-game worries that it would have to be cancelled due to the ongoing issues caused by Typhoon Hagibis. The pre-tournament rules stated that if the typhoon was sufficient to intervene, the game would be cancelled, and the result declared a draw. This controversial rule would have allowed Japan to progress by default due to previous results.

After final safety checks, the game was allowed to commence. Japan edged out Scotland 28–21 to register their second shock win of the tournament. They also became the first Asian nation to top their group at a Rugby World Cup, and the first Asian team to progress to the knockout stages.

Japan played South Africa in the quarter-finals in Tokyo on Sunday 20 October 2019, kick off 19:15 JST. They kept pace with South Africa in the first half, but two tries and three penalties in the second half for South Africa put the game out of reach and Japan lost 26–3.

<text>The North Warning System (NWS, ) is a joint United States and Canadian early-warning radar system for the atmospheric air defense of North America. It provides surveillance of airspace from potential incursions or attacks from across North America&#x27;s polar region. It replaced the Distant Early Warning Line system in the late 1980s.

==Overview==
The NWS consists of both long range AN/FPS-117 and short range AN/FPS-124 surveillance radars, operated and maintained by North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). There are 13 long range sites and 36 short range sites.

In Canada, the station sites are owned or leased by the Government of Canada, which also owns most of the infrastructure. The radars and tactical radios are owned by the United States Air Force. The Alaska Regional Operations Control Center (ROCC) at Elmendorf AFB, Alaska controls the stations in Alaska; the Canada East and Canada West Regional Operations Control Centres (ROCCs) at CFB North Bay, Ontario control the stations in Canada. ROCC information is then passed to the NORAD Combat Operations Centre (COC) at Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Each Long Range site consists of accommodation buildings, radar towers and radomes, generator and fuel systems, satellite terminals, automated weather station, and UHF and VHF ground-air-ground radio. Short Range sites consist of a single AN/FPS-124 radar, satellite terminals, power generation and fuel systems, and a small emergency shelter that can accommodate six people. Some short range stations lack weather stations and UHF Tactical Radios.

==History==
The Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line, constructed in the late 1950s, was reaching obsolescence in the 1980s. With the signing of North American Air Defence Modernization agreement at the &quot;Shamrock Summit&quot; between Prime Minister Mulroney and President Reagan in Quebec City on 18 March 1985, the DEW Line began its eventual upgrading and transition becoming the North Warning System (NWS) of today.

The NWS began limited operation in 1988 with the commissioning and acceptance of the three newly constructed east coast sites BAF-3 Brevoort Island, Nunavut, LAB-2 Saglek and LAB-6 Cartwright, both in Labrador. Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, new NWS LRR radars replaced former DEW Line sites. DEW sites that were not transitioned to North Warning operation were eventually closed down. The official activation of the NWS and inactivation of the DEW Line took place on 15 July 1993.

The bi-national North Warning System Office (NWSO) is located in Ottawa, Ontario and staffed with both Canadian and American military and civilian personnel. Staffed sites are operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force, but physically staffed by civilian contractors. Logistical and maintenance support for the NWS is supplied by the Air Force Materiel Command of the United States Air Force, located at Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC), Hill Air Force Base, Utah.

== Site remediation==
The former DEW Line sites were operated using practices and materials accepted by the environmental standards of the time. With their closure and many of them rebuilt as NWS sites, a clean-up project was undertaken to remove surplus infrastructure, treat chemically contaminated soils, and stabilize landfill sites. The clean-up was designed to keep chemical contamination from the DEW Line sites out of the Arctic food chain, and ensure that the sites are restored to an environmentally safe condition. In 1989, the Canadian Department of National Defence (DND) started investigating the environmental conditions of the DEW Line sites and commenced clean-up work at two sites in 1996. The clean-up of 21 sites was scheduled to be completed in 2013. In March 2014 DND announced the remediation project was complete.

== Stations ==

The NWS consists of 15 long-range radars (11 in Canada, of which eight were DEW Line sites) and 39 short-range radars (36 in Canada). The system forms a long and wide &quot;tripwire&quot; stretching from Alaska to southern Labrador. Minimally-attended NWS Long Range Radar AN/FPS-117 radar sites shaded in blue.

== Distant Early Warning Line sites not included ==

The following table lists the DEW Line sites not included in the NWS. Most of these sites not included were Intermediate sites closed in 1963 when they were declared obsolete. The stations consisted of a module train, a warehouse, a vehicle garage, an Inuit house, POL (&quot;P&quot;etroleum, &quot;O&quot;il, &quot;L&quot;ubricant) tanks and a continuous wave radar tower. Others were some Auxiliary sites that were replaced with new NWS stations. DEW Line stations in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska were inactivated due to budget reductions in 1969. The DYE Stations in Greenland and Iceland were transferred to the USAF Air Forces Iceland in 1980.

The primary DEW line radars were the Raytheon AN/FPS-19 long range L-Band search radar in Canada and Alaska at main and auxiliary sites; Bendix AN/FPS-30 at the four Greenland DYE radar stations. Motorola AN/FPS-23 short range search radar was installed at the Intermediate sites, used as fillers to cover any Long Range Radar surveillance gaps.

<doc id="759598" wikidata="Q1197607" url="?curid=759598" title="The Dreamstone">
<text>The Dreamstone is a British animated television series that aired from 1990 to 1995, with four series and 52 episodes. The series&#x27; original concept and artwork was created by Michael Jupp, and it was written by Sue Radley and Martin Gates and produced by Martin Gates Productions (MGP) for a wholly-owned subsidiary of Central, a part of Independent Television, and FilmFair. Distribution rights for the Martin Gates catalogue, including &quot;The Dreamstone&quot;, are currently owned by Monster Entertainment.

&quot;The Dreamstone&quot; is set in the dream worlds of the Land of Dreams and the Land of Nightmares and follows the struggle between good, personified by The Dream Maker, and evil, personified by Zordrak, Lord of Nightmares.

==Principal characters==
===Land of Dreams===
The Land of Dreams is populated by the humanoid Noops, whose lifestyle is similar to humans, and the Wuts, defenders of the realm who fly around on leaves and use staffs to communicate with each other and ward off Zordrak&#x27;s forces.

*The Dream Maker (voiced by John Franklyn-Robbins): A wise and elderly wizard responsible for creating and sending dreams to the world.
*Albert (voiced by Richard Tate): The Dream Maker&#x27;s pet dogfish, who is said to have been created when he saw him in a dream and liked him so much that he decided to make him real. Albert later became the mascot/logo for Martin Gates&#x27; production company.
*Rufus (voiced by Stuart Lock): The main protagonist of the series. A Noop who enjoys dreaming so much that he has vivid daydreams, which has caused him to have trouble finding a job. After being fired from the waxworks, Amberley suggests that Rufus apply for the position of the Dream Maker&#x27;s assistant, which is ideal for him because of his daydreaming. Although his mind often wanders and he tends to get into things he should not, he is creative and imaginative. In the pilot episode he is voiced by Christian Bale.
*Amberley (voiced by Nancy Hendry): Rufus&#x27; best friend, who is practical and resourceful. However, her level-headedness is sometimes clouded by her short temper, which sometimes causes her to rush into situations. She was named after Amberley, West Sussex, a village that creator Mike Jupp visited regularly.
*Pildit (voiced by Derek Wright): The leader of the Wuts and a long-time friend of the Dream Maker, who is his most trusted ally and often called upon to defend the Land of Dreams from Zordrak&#x27;s forces. He teaches Rufus and Amberley how to use the special leaves the Wuts use to fly. Pildit is rather mellow and deadpan, in contrast to his grandmother.
* Wildit (voiced by Jacqueline Clarke): Pildit&#x27;s grandmother and the leader of the Wut Flying Squadron.
*Spildit (voiced by Ellie Beaven): Wildit&#x27;s niece, who often gets into trouble and has a friendly rivalry with the Urpneys, often taking pity on them during their less antagonistic moments or unknowingly assisting in their schemes.
*Mr. Blossom (voiced by Anthony Jackson): An elderly Wut and the Dream Maker&#x27;s gardener, whose dedication to his duty is more important to him than issues like the Dreamstone being stolen. 
*Wottles (voiced by Ellie Beaven): Creatures that are similar to Wuts, but are smaller and have furry chests. Their job is to look after the Dream Bottle trees from underground and ensure that they are healthy. Notable Wottles are Hat and Egg, who often accompany Rufus and Amberley on their adventures.
*Planet Dreamstone (voiced by Jacqueline Clarke): A sentient planet that is an authority figure in the Council of Dreammakers and the source of power for all Dreamstones in the universe.

===Land of Nightmares===
The Land of Nightmares is populated mainly by Urpneys, lizard-like humanoids who live in Viltheed, a mountainous wasteland that Zordrak inhaits. Although all Urpneys in Viltheed are male, female Urpneys do exist, as Urpgor has an aunt and a niece.

*Zordrak (voiced by Gary Martin): The Lord of Nightmares and the main antagonist of the series. Zordrak was once a Dream Maker, but was banished from the council for corrupting dreams into nightmares, after which he transformed into his current form and arrived in Viltheed, vowing vengeance on the Dream Maker. He rarely leaves his throne, instead relying on his henchman to carry out his work; he can also transform into a mist/apparition to leave Viltheed. His initial motive for stealing the stone is to freely send nightmares to the Sleeping World, but he later reveals his intention to use its powers to make himself Lord of the Universe. In Mike Jupp&#x27;s original draft of the story, Zordrak was known as &quot;Nasta Shelfim&quot;, an anagram for &quot;&quot;Satan himself&quot;,&quot; but his name was changed to Zordrak due to the original name being too dark.
*Urpgor (voiced by Leonard Whiting (Series 1–3), Colin Marsh (Series 4)): The chief Urpney scientist, who hates the Urpneys and secretly seeks to take the throne for himself. While his inventions work, they are often hindered by their complexity and reliance on Urpney muscle power to operate them. He is the only Urpney shown to have relatives, having an aunt and a niece, Urpip.
*Sergeant Blob (voiced by Richard Tate): The military leader of the Urpneys, who takes over Operation Dreamstone after the former commanding officer, Captain Crigg, is executed. He usually has Nug and Frizz accompany him on missions, having appointed them his &quot;elite squad&quot; in the pilot episode because they were slow to flee with the others.
*Corporal Frizz (voiced by Melvyn Hayes): An Urpney who gained a position of responsibility because he could not run away as fast as the others. He dislikes Urpgor more than the other Urpneys, and occasionally tries to attack him, notably after meeting his aunt.
*Corporal Nug (voiced by Anthony Jackson): A member of Blob&#x27;s Urpney squad. Though he can often come across as dimwitted, he is sometimes shown to be more perceptive than the other Urpneys, sometimes suggesting good ideas that are usually taken by Blob and passed off as his own.
*Captain Crigg: The original commander of the Urpneys, who questioned Zordrak&#x27;s leadership and often fell behind schedule. As a result of his failures, Zordrak banished him to the Pit of No Return, where he was eaten by the Frazznats. After his death, Blob was promoted to the position of commander.
*Argorribles: Incorpereal purple clouds that Zordrak sends each night to deliver nightmares to the sleeping world. While often thwarted by the power of the Dreamstone, with the power of the Nightmare stone, they gain more power and are more likely to bypass the Dreamstone&#x27;s defences.
*Zarag (voiced by Jacqueline Clarke): Zordrak&#x27;s sister, who was sealed in a bottle for five hundred years until Nug accidentally releases her and is implied to have been romantically involved with the Dream Maker. She also seeks the Dreamstone, but to wear as a hair accessory rather than to unleash nightmares upon the world. Her last appearance was &quot;The Substitute&quot; where, as part of an arrangement with the Urpneys, she poses as a Dream Maker to corrupt the Noops&#x27; dream bottles with Argoribbles in an attempt to steal the Dreamstone. 
*Frazznats: Creatures that live in the Pit of No Return and feed on Urpneys.

==Episodes==

==Soundtrack==

The show was notable for its musical score, which was unique among cartoons in that it was performed by a full-size professional orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra. The score, by Mike Batt, was heavily characterised by the use of leitmotifs and thematic variations, particularly in the two main songs used in the series, &quot;Better Than a Dream&quot;, which characterised the Noops and the Wuts, and &quot;War Song of the Urpneys&quot;, which characterised the Urpneys.

Ozzy Osbourne, Frank Bruno, and Billy Connolly provided lead vocals on the &quot;War Song of the Urpneys&quot; single and album track, although the version heard in the series was mainly sung by composer Mike Batt. Other artists who sang for soundtrack included Bonnie Tyler, who recorded a duet with Mike entitled &quot;Into the Sunset&quot;, which was intended to be used as the show&#x27;s official love song, but went unused. Joe Brown and Gary Glitter performed &quot;The Vile Brothers Mountain Band&quot;, which was used in the episode &quot;Albert is Fishnapped&quot;.

The TV version of &quot;Better Than a Dream&quot; contained different lyrics than the version included on the soundtrack. The TV version reflected Rufus&#x27;s personality, with the lyrics &quot;I always dream myself to somewhere else each night&quot; and &quot;I know I dream much more than other people do&quot;. The soundtrack version instead has the lyrics &quot;I used to dream myself to someone else each night&quot; and &quot;until I chanced upon this road that led to you&quot;, among other changed lyrics. Mike Batt re-recorded the chorus, which was used in the ending credits from the latter half of Series 1 until series 4, in which it was shortened. In 2012, Katie Melua released a version of &quot;Better Than a Dream&quot;.

The soundtrack was re-released as part of the Mike Batt Music Cube release in December 2009 by Dramatico Records. However, instead of the TV soundtrack, the CD featured five newly recorded orchestral overtures, as well as &quot;Better Than a Dream&quot;, &quot;The War Song of the Urpneys&quot;, &quot;Into the Sunset&quot;, and a shorter version of &quot;The Dreamdance&quot;, which omits the vocal clips from the show. &quot;The Vile Brothers Mountain Band&quot; was omitted from the soundtrack due to the controversy surrounding Gary Glitter.

*This is not the only track to be called Dreamstone Overture no.5. The &quot;Better Than a Dream&quot; 7-inch vinyl and CD single versions features the track &quot;Dreamstone Overture no.5&quot;, which is different from the Music Cube re-release and is an orchestral version of &quot;Into the Sunset&quot;, while the Dreamstone Overtures on the Music Cube re-release are selections of orchestral tracks from the original series. The &quot;Dreamstone Overture no.5&quot; present on the single has a runtime of 6:48.

The Dreamstone soundtrack is currently out of print as of 2015. However, the five Overture tracks from the Music Cube re-release are included on Mike Batt&#x27;s album &quot;A Classical Tale&quot;, released on CD on 24 July 2015 by Dramatico Records.

==Home media releases and online distribution==
In the United Kingdom, there were several video releases from the Video Collection, covering all of series 1, including the unedited opening special, except for the episode &quot;Megattack&quot;, as well as several releases of most episodes from Series 1 from Tring Video UK. BMG Video UK released one video release, which featured four episodes from Series 2.

The first two episodes were originally combined as one episode, the opening special, which contained extra footage that was removed from the 22-minute TV version of the special. The first six episodes of the series were released on DVD in the UK by Abbey Home Media, when the rights to the show were owned by Cookie Jar Entertainment, but these two volumes have since gone out of print. The company&#x27;s Jaroo website used to stream episodes from the first two series.

There were six video releases by Australian company Reel Entertainment, which was released in Australia and featured the first 12 episodes of Series 3. There was also another video release by Video Distributors International in 1992, which featured the first three episodes of Series 1.

In the United States, Fisher-Price released a video release of &quot;The Dreamstone&quot;.

Pidax Film released the first 13 episodes on DVD in Germany, with English and German audio, on 23 February 2018. Series 2 was released on 18 May 2018. Series 3 was released on 27 July 2018, and Series 4 was released on 28 September 2018.,

The first series was available in the UK through Amazon Prime, but lacked the series finale, &quot;Megattack&quot;. Since 2020, however, the episodes are no longer available on Amazon. iTunes has added the first 12 episodes to their service.

In late 2018, Monster Entertainment began the &quot;Official Dreamstone&quot; channel on YouTube and uploaded all 52 episodes, but in June 2019, they set most of the episodes to &quot;private&quot;. As of January 2020, they have been re-uploaded.

In September 2022, the series was released on PZAZ TV Worldwide.

==Production==

Although the show was produced in the United Kingdom, it was animated in the Philippines. As with American produced cartoons, Martin Gates Productions used foreign studios for the overall animation work. Fil-Cartoons, owned by Hanna-Barbera, did animation for series 1, while Moving Images International did animation for series 2–4.

In 1985, Mike Jupp and Martin Gates produced a pilot for the series, &quot;The Dream Thief&quot;. It was animated by the studio Mill Valley Animation in Novato, California, when Mike was working in America. The pilot has several differences from the TV series, most of which came from Jupp&#x27;s original manuscript for the idea, and featured a 12-year-old Christian Bale as the voice of Rufus.

==Merchandise and other media==

In 1991, London Edition published a comic book series based on episodes from the series. The first issue consisted entirely of screenshots, while the next five featured art drawn by Tim Perkins. The comic ran for six issues and adapted plotlines from the episodes &quot;The Dreamstone/Into Viltheed&quot;, &quot;The Daydream Bubble&quot;, &quot;Albert Is Fishnapped&quot;, &quot;The Knitted Balloon&quot;, &quot;The Shrinking Stone&quot;, and &quot;The Invisible Blob&quot;.

BMI (Print Division) Ltd. released a board game based on &quot;The Dreamstone&quot; in 1993, containing The Dreamstone Game, which involved rolling to move and collecting pieces of the Dreamstone, and Dream Chase, a variant of Snakes and Ladders. A jigsaw puzzle depicting the Dream Maker, Rufus, Amberley, and Albert walking through the Noops&#x27; town was also produced, along with other puzzles produced by British puzzle/board game manufacturer Waddingtons.

In October 2019, Oakbound Studio announced that it would produce a licensed miniatures range and game based on &quot;The Dreamstone&quot; to mark its 30th anniversary. The role-playing game, miniatures game, and a range of 27 initial collectable figurines based on the show were funded through Kickstarter and released on Oakbound&#x27;s website in July 2021. Zordrak was also announced as a second Kickstarter project launching in December 2022, with a third miniatures release and supplement to the games being planned for 2022.

<text>Emil Osann (May 25, 1787 – January 11, 1842) was a German physician and physiologist from Weimar. He was a founder of scientific balneology.

He was the brother of philologist Friedrich Gotthilf Osann (1794-1858) and chemist Gottfried Osann (1796-1866).

He studied medicine in Jena and Göttingen, and later worked an assistant in a Berlin polyclinic founded by his uncle, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland (1762–1836). In 1826 he became a full professor of &quot;Heilmittellehre&quot; (medical instruction), and in 1833 became director of the aforementioned clinic.

Osann is remembered for his work on the effects of mineral springs from a physical and medical standpoint. Among his writings was a two-volume work on European mineral spas, titled &quot;Physikalisch-medicinische Darstellung der bekannten Heilquellen der vorzüglichsten Länder Europas&quot;. It is considered to be the first comprehensive publication in the field of balneology.

In 1837 Osann became sole editor of the &quot;Journal der praktischen Heilkunde&quot; (Journal of Practical Medicine).

<text>Harold Marion Osborn D.O. (April 13, 1899 – April 5, 1975) was an American track athlete. He won a gold medal in Olympic decathlon and high jump in 1924 and was the first athlete to win a gold medal in both the decathlon and an individual event.

== Biography ==
After high school, Osborn attended the University of Illinois from 1919 through 1922, majoring in agriculture, where he was a founding member of the Eta chapter of Kappa Delta Rho fraternity. Both of Osborns parents were of entirely English ancestry. All of Osborn&#x27;s ancestors came to North America from England and all of them emigrated to the Province of Massachusetts Bay before the year 1700. Osborn was descended from Richard Sears, John Underhill, Myles Standish, George Soule and John Woodbridge.

Osborn won gold medals and set Olympic records in both the high jump and the decathlon at the 1924 Olympics. His 6&#x27;6&quot; high jump remained the Olympic record for 12 years, while his decathlon score of 7,710.775 points also set a new world record, and resulted in worldwide press coverage calling him the &quot;world&#x27;s greatest athlete.&quot;

On May 27, 1924, Osborn&#x27;s 6&#x27; 8-¼&quot; (=2m 03.835 cm) high jump set a world record at an AAU meet held at the University of Illinois campus in Urbana. The following year Osborn won the British AAA Championships title in the high jump event at the 1925 AAA Championships. At the same Championships he finished second behind Elemér Somfay in the triple jump event.

Osborn competed in the Olympics again in 1928. In the high jump, four competitors tied for second place. The initial tying jumps for second place were 6&#x27; 3- ½&quot;, just an inch behind gold medalist, Bob King, who jumped 6&#x27; 4½&quot;.

== Titles and records ==
Osborn won 17 national titles and set six world records during his career. He held world indoor records in the standing hop, step, and jump; the 60-yard high hurdles; and the running high jump. His holds the world record in the standing high jump of 5&#x27; 5¾&quot; which he achieved at the age of 37. Osborn was enshrined as a charter member of the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1974. He modified the Western roll technique by developing an efficient side‑to‑the‑bar clearance, which resulted in more height and consistency.

<text>There have been three baronetcies created for descendants of the ancient Lancashire family of Gerard.

The Baronetcy of Gerard of Bryn Lancashire was created in the Baronetage of England in 1611 for Thomas Gerard, Member of Parliament for Liverpool, Lancashire, and Wigan who was a direct descendant of the family of Bryn. From him derived a line of baronets that was elevated to the peerage in 1879, when the baronetcy was merged with the title of Barons Gerard of Bryn, with which it descends to the present holder, the seventeenth baronet.

The Baronetcy of Gerard of Harrow on the Hill was created in the Baronetage of England on 12 April 1620 for Gilbert Gerard of Flambards, Harrow on the Hill, Middlesex, (a grand-nephew of Gilbert Gerard, Attorney General 1559–81, of Gerards Bromley, Staffordshire) who was Member of Parliament for Wigan 1614, Middlesex 1621–48 and Lancaster 1660. His son Francis, the second Baronet represented Seaford 1641–48, Middlesex 1659 and Bossiney in 1660. His son Charles, third Baronet, was the member for Middlesex 1685–95 and Cockermouth 1695–98. His two brothers followed as fourth and fifth Baronets but the Baronetcy was extinct on the death of the latter in 1716. The Flambards estate passed to the daughter of the third Baronet and was sold off in 1767.

The Baronetcy of Gerard of Fiskerton, Lincolnshire was created on 17 November 1666 for Gilbert Gerard a great-grandson of Gilbert Gerard, Attorney General. His second wife was Mary Cosin, daughter of John Cosin the Bishop of Durham. Sir Gilbert acquired an estate at Gateshead Durham and was elected Member of Parliament for Northallerton in 1661. He was appointed by his father in law as High Sheriff of Durham in 1665. He was buried in York Minster in 1687. He was succeeded by his son Gilbert Cosin-Gerard on whose death in 1730 the Baronetcy was extinct.

<text>Thomas Mott Osborne (September 23, 1859 – October 20, 1926) was an American prison officer, prison reformer, industrialist and New York State political reformer. In an assessment of Osborne&#x27;s life, a &quot;New York Times&quot; book reviewer wrote: &quot;His career as a penologist was short, but in the interval of the few years he served he succeeded in revolutionizing American prison reform, if not always in fact, then in awakening responsibility... He was made of the spectacular stuff of martyrs, to many people perhaps ridiculous, but to those whose lives his theories most closely touched, inspiring and often godlike.&quot;

==Biography==

He was born on September 23, 1859, in Auburn, New York, to David Munson Osborne (1822–1886) and Eliza Lidy Wright (1822–1886). Auburn was a center of progressive political activity, particularly anti-slavery activism before and during the American Civil War. His family included a number of eminent reformers, particularly his grandmother, Martha Coffin Wright and her sister, Lucretia Coffin Mott and his uncle William Lloyd Garrison, who were organizers of the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention on women&#x27;s rights, with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, in Seneca Falls, New York.

His grandmother, Martha Coffin Wright, and in succession her daughter and Osborne&#x27;s mother, Eliza Wright Osborne, and a niece, Josephine Osborne, oversaw the finances of Harriet Tubman, who spent her last half-century in Auburn. Martha&#x27;s home in Auburn was part of the Underground Railroad where she harbored fugitive slaves. Both women frequented the Osborne household during Thomas Mott Osborne&#x27;s upbringing. Thomas Osborne&#x27;s aunt, Ellen, or as she is known to her descendants, Nella, married William Lloyd Garrison Jr., the son of the noted abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison. Thomas Mott Osborne&#x27;s mother, Eliza Wright Osborne, wife of David Munson Osborne, was also a feminist leader, though of lesser note.

===Early years===

Thomas Osborne attended Adams Academy in Quincy, Massachusetts, and graduated from Harvard University with honors in 1884, where he was among the founders of the Harvard Cooperative Society.

Upon David Munson Osborne&#x27;s death in 1886, Thomas Osborne became president of his family&#x27;s manufacturing company, DM Osborne &amp; Co. He married Agnes Lithgow Devens in 1886. His wife died of cancer just a few months after giving birth to their fourth son on March 26, 1896.

Thomas Mott Osborne served on the Auburn School Board from 1885 to 1896, becoming the youngest chairman in its history. In 1896, he became a trustee on the board of the George Junior Republic, a self-governing youth colony, and soon its chairman, just in time to lead a campaign to prevent New York State from shutting it down.

At the New York state election, 1898, he ran on the Independent Citizens&#x27; ticket for Lieutenant Governor of New York.

Osborne was elected mayor of Auburn in 1902, serving two terms. He was known to disguise himself and visit local taverns to eavesdrop on conversations to get a sense of public opinion.

By 1903 DM Osborne &amp; Co. grew to become North America&#x27;s third largest producer of agricultural implements. In 1903, the family sold the company to the International Harvester Trust, leaving Osborne to pursue social reform and public service. International Harvester took over management in 1905.

In 1905 he launched a daily newspaper, the &quot;Auburn Daily Citizen&quot;, as a progressive voice to counter the city&#x27;s dominant daily, &quot;the Auburn Daily Advertiser&quot;. The Osborne family still edits and owns &quot;The Nation&quot;, first published during the 1836 abolitionist movement.

===Reformer===

In 1907, Governor Charles Evans Hughes selected Osborne to serve as upstate commissioner on the state&#x27;s first New York Public Service Commission. At one point, to determine whether railroads could safely trim staff as they proposed, Osborne dressed as a hobo and rode the rails and was once arrested by police in Syracuse, New York in the course of his sleuthing. His report to the commission, however, was instrumental in persuading the panel to order railroad staff maintained. However, his propensity to travel in a variety of odd disguises and his close relationship with Louis Schaedeline, a handyman with whom Osborne was rumored to be having a homosexual affair, proved fatal to Osborne&#x27;s future political ambitions.

Between 1910 and 1912, Osborne teamed with Franklin Delano Roosevelt, then a New York State senator, and Louis McHenry Howe in unsuccessful efforts to reform the New York State Democratic Party. FDR, Howe, and Osborne were upstate New York&#x27;s best-known foes of Tammany Hall and William Randolph Hearst. But after the 1912 national Democratic Convention, where the three worked for the presidential nomination of Woodrow Wilson, Wilson ignored their faction of the state Democratic party and instead selected the larger, Tammany Hall-led wing of the Democratic party to represent the state. Osborne quit politics in disgust.

In 1912, sick in bed, Osborne was inspired to read &quot;My Life In Prison&quot; by Donald Lowrie, a former inmate of San Quentin prison in California. The following year, he persuaded New York Governor William Sulzer to appoint him chairman of a new State Commission on Prison Reform. On behalf of the commission that year he entered the Auburn Prison, now Auburn Correctional Facility, in prison garb insisting to the administration that he be treated like any other prisoner. On September 29, Osborne began six days of imprisonment as &quot;Tom Brown,&quot; Inmate 33,333X. He recorded his experiences in &quot;Within Prison Walls&quot;. Its publication in 1914 made him the most prominent prison reform crusader of his day.

===Warden of Sing Sing===

Osborne was appointed Warden of Sing Sing prison in Ossining, New York, on December 1, 1914, replacing Judge George S. Weed. After addressing the prisoners in chapel, he undertook a week&#x27;s stay inside the prison, again experiencing the prison from the prisoners&#x27; point of view. He next stunned the guards and prisoners by visiting the prison yard unarmed and unescorted. He established a system of internal self-rule called the &quot;Mutual Welfare League&quot; within the prison and quickly won enthusiastic support from both guards and prisoners.

His principal opponents were prisoners who had lived comfortably within the system before his reforms, by intimidating others or using their financial resources to bribe guards for privileges. One of these, a former Manhattan banker in prison for larceny, used his financial and political connections to instigate a rigged &quot;investigation&quot; of Osborne&#x27;s administration. When he was indicted for perjury, neglect of duty, and &quot;unlawful [sexual] acts with inmates,&quot; Osborne fought back with a speaking tour of the state. Carnegie Hall saw two mass meetings supporting his defense, one attended by the retired president of Harvard University Charles William Eliot. The prison guards wrote a letter in support as well. After the judge in the case directed a verdict of acquittal, Osborne returned to Sing Sing in triumph. The front page of the New York Times described the celebration at the prison: &quot;Convicts&#x27; Carnival Welcomes Osborne; Prisoners, in Costume and Wild with Joy, Give Pageant for Him at Sing Sing, Hundreds of Spectators.&quot;

He resigned his position as Sing Sing&#x27;s warden later in 1916, tired of battling his superiors and New York State Governor Charles S. Whitman.

===Commander at Portsmouth===

In 1916 Josephus Daniels, the Secretary of the Navy at the likely suggestion of Assistant Secretary Franklin Delano Roosevelt, an ally of Osborne from his years in New York State reform politics, commissioned a report on conditions at the Portsmouth Naval Prison in Kittery, Maine. Osborne again investigated conditions by living inside the prison like any other inmate. He found a facility in desperate need of his reforms. In a speech at the Twentieth Century Club in New York City, he denounced &quot;degrading&quot; uniforms and &quot;absurd&quot; procedures: &quot;When the men return from working on the seawall, a place where they could not possibly obtain anything but sand, boulders and seaweed, they are stripped and searched.&quot;

In July 1917, now a lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy, he took up the position of commander of the Portsmouth Naval Prison, a post he held for two and a half years. It was during these years Osborne, as senior officer, met and mentored Austin MacCormick. Austin MacCormick would continue after Osborne&#x27;s death in 1926 to publish his seminal work, &quot;The Education of Adult Prisoners&quot; in 1931. MacCormick would also become Dean of Criminology at U.C. Berkeley and executive director of Osborne Association, a prison reform organization still active to this day.

During his tenure at Portsmouth, Osborne also met and became a long-term mentor to prisoner and future author Victor Folke Nelson. In 1921, it would be Osborne who would convince Nelson to turn himself in after escaping from Charlestown State Prison in Boston.

==Later career==
His books, public speaking and notoriety helped end the so-called &quot;rule of silence,&quot; floggings and other prisoner abuses common in U.S. prisons at the time. But Osborne&#x27;s cherished prisoner self-government plan, the &quot;Mutual Welfare League,&quot; vanished soon after his death in 1926. His initial experiments had been greeted by the press largely with derision, but over the course of his life he won grudging admiration from both the press and the public.

===Death===
He died on October 20, 1926, in Auburn, New York. He was buried in Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn dressed in a Portsmouth prison uniform.

==Legacy==
In 1933, the Welfare League Association and several other organizations Osborne had created were merged and reorganized as Osborne Association. The Association now works at every point of the criminal justice system, from arrest and &quot;pre-entry,&quot; to programs in prison and in the community following release. True to Osborne&#x27;s founding spirit, the Association&#x27;s 25 programs are all designed to offer individuals the opportunity, the tools, and the support to build or rebuild their lives.

<text>The Pensacola News Journal is a daily morning newspaper serving Escambia and Santa Rosa counties in Florida. It is Northwest Florida&#x27;s most widely read daily.

The &quot;News Journal&quot; is owned by Gannett, a national media holding company that owns newspapers such as &quot;USA Today&quot; and the &quot;Arizona Republic&quot;, among others.

==History==
The heritage of the &quot;News Journal&quot; can be traced back to 1889, when a group of Pensacola businessmen founded the &quot;Pensacola Daily News&quot;. The &quot;Daily News&quot; printed its first issue on 5 March 1889, with an initial circulation of 2,500 copies. Then, in March 1897, a Pensacolian named M. Loftin founded a newsweekly, the &quot;Pensacola Journal&quot;. The &quot;Journal&quot; converted to a daily format a year later.

The two dailies competed fiercely, each driving the other to edge of bankruptcy in the struggle to be recognised as Pensacola&#x27;s top daily newspaper. By 1922, the &quot;Journal&quot; was in dire financial trouble, and was eventually purchased by New York City businessman John Holliday Perry, who at about the same time also acquired papers in Jacksonville and Panama City. Two years later, Perry bought the &quot;Daily News&quot; and merged the two newspapers&#x27; operations. For the next six decades, the &quot;Pensacola Journal&quot; continued to appear mornings and the &quot;Pensacola News&quot; afternoons, with a combined Sunday edition as the &quot;Pensacola News Journal&quot;.

John H. Perry developed the &quot;News Journal&quot; into an extremely popular and successful newspaper. By the early 1950s, the &quot;News Journal&quot; had developed into one of the most modern and efficient newspaper operations in the Southeast. Under the leadership of Perry&#x27;s son, John Holliday Perry Jr., who succeeded his father in 1952, the &quot;News Journal&quot; continued to expand. Perry Publications, Inc., eventually owned 28 newspapers throughout Florida.

On July 1, 1969, the younger Perry announced he was selling the &quot;News&quot; and the &quot;Journal&quot; to Gannett, then based in Rochester, New York, for $15.5 million.

Like many U.S. afternoon newspapers in the post-war period, the &quot;News&quot; sustained declining circulation. Finally, in 1985, the &quot;News&quot; and &quot;Journal&quot; merged into a single morning newspaper under the &quot;News Journal&quot; name.

The paper gained nationwide notoriety in 1997 and 1998 with a series of investigative reports about the Brownsville Revival at the Brownsville Assembly of God. The paper had initially written glowing reports about the revival, but after former members told the paper that all was not as it appeared, the &quot;News Journal&quot; began a four-month investigation that revealed the revival had been &quot;well planned and orchestrated&quot; from the very start. It also called many of the claims made by the church&#x27;s leaders into question, and delved heavily into the church&#x27;s finances.

The &quot;News Journal&quot; had a peak daily circulation of 64,041 and a Sunday circulation of 81,633 in 2002, declining to a daily circulation of 29,981 and a Sunday circulation of 47,892 in 2015.

After over a century, the production departments moved to Mobile, Ala., on 2 June 2009.

In August 2014, the &quot;Pensacola News Journal&quot; moved to its new headquarters at 2 N. Palafox St. The longtime headquarters at 101 E. Romana St. was demolished in 2015 by its new owners, Quint Studer&#x27;s Daily Convo, who will build apartments, retail shops and a new YMCA on the site. In mid-2023, &quot;Pensacola News Journal&quot; moved out of the 2 N. Palafox St. building. The new mailing address is 101 N E Street according to the contact us page on pnj.com.

In March 2024, the newspaper switched from carrier to postal delivery.

== Controversies ==
In 2021, the paper faced national backlash for an allegedly misogynistic cartoon drawn by its cartoonist, Andy Marlette. During the coverage of the backlash, allegations of racism arose against Marlette for a cartoon he drew while in college, including the use of racial epithets. Marlette was quoted as saying the objections of racism against him came solely from irrational and unreasonable readers. The coverage of the incident raised questions about the paper&#x27;s hiring practices.

Marlette left the paper shortly after the controversy. It is unclear whether Marlette was fired.

<text>Frances Sargent Osgood (née Locke; June 18, 1811 – May 12, 1850) was an American poet and one of the most popular women writers during her time. Nicknamed &quot;Fanny&quot;, she was also famous for her exchange of romantic poems with Edgar Allan Poe.

==Life==

===Early life===
Frances Sargent Locke was born in Boston, Massachusetts to Joseph Locke, a wealthy merchant, and his second wife, Mary Ingersoll Foster. Her father&#x27;s first wife, Martha Ingersoll, was the sister of Mary, his second wife. Mary was also the widow of Benjamin Foster, by whom she had two children: William Vincent Foster and Anna Maria Wells, who would also become a published poet and close associate of Frances. Joseph and Mary had seven children, including another writer, Andrew Aitchison Locke.
She grew up in Hingham, Massachusetts and as a young woman she attended the prestigious Boston Lyceum for Young Ladies. Her poetry was first published when she was fourteen in a bimonthly periodical of children&#x27;s poetry called &quot;Juvenile Miscellany&quot; by editor Lydia Maria Child.

===Marriage===

In 1834, while composing poems inspired by paintings, Frances met Samuel Stillman Osgood, a young portrait artist at the Boston Athenaeum. He asked her to sit for a portrait. They were engaged before the portrait was finished and married on October 7, 1835.

After their marriage, the couple moved to England. On July 15, 1836, their first daughter, Ellen Frances, was born. In 1838, while in England, she published her collection of poems &quot;A Wreath of Flowers from New England&quot; which included &quot;Elfrida&quot;, a dramatic poem in five acts. She then published another volume of poetry, &quot;The Casket of Fate&quot;.

Due to her father&#x27;s death, the Osgoods returned to Boston in 1839. After the birth of their second daughter, May Vincent, on July 21, 1839, they moved to New York City. Osgood became a popular member of the New York literary society and a prolific writer. Many of her writings were published in the widely popular literary magazines of the time. She sometimes wrote under the pseudonyms &quot;Kate Carol&quot; or &quot;Violet Vane&quot;. Her book, &quot;The Poetry of Flowers and the Flowers of Poetry&quot; was published in 1841. Some of her other published works were &quot;The Snowdrop, a New Year Gift for Children&quot; (1842), &quot;Rose, Sketches in Verse&quot; (1842), &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; (1842), &quot;The Marquis of Carabas&quot; (1844) and &quot;Cries in New York&quot; (1846).

Although she was successful in her professional life, her personal life suffered. It is speculated that the Osgoods separated by 1843. Frances Osgood&#x27;s third daughter, Fanny Fay Osgood, was born in June of 1846.

===Relationship with Poe===
In February 1845, Poe gave a lecture in New York in which he criticized American poetry, especially that of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. He made special mention, however, of Osgood, saying she had &quot;a rosy future&quot; in literature. Though she missed the lecture, she wrote to her friend, saying Poe was &quot;called the severest critic of the day&quot;, making his compliment that much more impressive.

It is believed Poe and Osgood first met in person when introduced by Nathaniel Parker Willis in March 1845 when Osgood had been separated from (but not divorced from) her husband. Poe&#x27;s wife, Virginia, was still alive, but in ill health. Poe may have been attracted to Osgood because they were both born in Boston and possibly due to her childlike qualities which were similar to Virginia&#x27;s. She may have already been in an early stage of tuberculosis, just like Virginia.
In 1845, Poe used his role as one-third owner of the &quot;Broadway Journal&quot; to print some of Osgood&#x27;s poems, including some flirtatious ones: &quot;The Rivulet&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1845), &quot;So Let It Be. To--&quot; (1845), &quot;Love&#x27;s Reply&quot; (1845), &quot;Spring&quot; (1845), &quot;Slander&quot; (1845), &quot;Echo-Song&quot; (1845), &quot;To--&quot; (1845), &quot;A Shipwreck&quot; (1845) and &quot;To &#x27;The Lady Geraldine&quot; (1845). Poe responded with published poems of his own, occasionally under his pseudonym of Edgar T. S. Grey. Most notable is his poem &quot;A Valentine&quot;. The poem is actually a riddle that conceals Osgood&#x27;s name, found by taking letter 1 from line 1, letter 2 from line 2, and so on. Despite these passionate interchanges, the relationship between Poe and Osgood is often considered purely platonic.

Oddly, Poe&#x27;s wife Virginia approved of the relationship and often invited Osgood to visit their home. Virginia believed their friendship had a &quot;restraining&quot; effect on her husband. Poe had given up alcohol to impress Osgood, for example. Virginia may also have been aware of her own impending death and was looking for someone who would take care of Poe. Osgood&#x27;s husband, Samuel, also did not object, apparently used to his wife&#x27;s impetuous behavior; he himself had a reputation as a philanderer.

Fellow poet Elizabeth F. Ellet, whose affection Poe had scorned, spread rumors about Poe and Osgood&#x27;s friendship, even contacting Virginia about alleged improprieties. Ellet even suggested that Osgood&#x27;s third child, Fanny Fay, was not her husband&#x27;s, but Poe&#x27;s. Fanny Fay was born in June 1846, but died in October. Poe biographer Kenneth Silverman says that Poe being Fanny Fay&#x27;s father is &quot;possible but most unlikely&quot;. Osgood, in an attempt to protect her public character, sent Margaret Fuller and Anne Lynch to request Poe return her personal letters to him to be destroyed. In July 1846, Osgood&#x27;s husband, Samuel, demanded Ellet apologize to his wife, lest he sue her for defamation. Ellet responded in a letter, retracted her statements, and put the blame on Poe and his wife, Virginia. Osgood and Poe did not interact after 1847.

Poe was not the only man to engage in literary flirtation with Osgood. Several men wrote of their affection for her, including Rufus Wilmot Griswold, to whom Osgood dedicated a book of poetry. She also wrote a Valentine poem that mingled her own name with Griswold&#x27;s. The competition between Griswold and Poe for Osgood may have led to their infamous rivalry, best exemplified in Griswold&#x27;s character assassination of Poe after Poe&#x27;s death.

===Death===

Osgood and her husband reconciled in 1846, and moved to Philadelphia for a short time to get away from the scandal. Although she was ill, she continued to write. She was confined to her room because of her illness by 1847, when her daughters were eleven and eight years old; much of her poetry from this period reflects her concern for them. Her husband, having difficulty making money as a painter, left her again in 1849 to join the California Gold Rush. He returned shortly before her death.

Osgood died of tuberculosis in 1850 at her home in New York. By then, she had lost her ability to speak; her last word, &quot;angel&quot;, was written on a slate to her husband. She was buried in her parents&#x27; lot at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1851, a collection of her writings was published by her friends and titled &quot;The Memorial, Written by Friends of the Late Mrs. Frances Sargent Locke Osgood&quot;. It was reissued as &quot;Laurel Leaves&quot; in 1854 and was edited with a biographical introduction by Griswold. The volume was meant to raise money for her memorial headstone. However, Fanny Fern noted that, by 1854, the plot remained unmarked and criticized Samuel Osgood in her book &quot;Fern Leaves from Fanny&#x27;s Port-Folio&quot;. Samuel Osgood noted in the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; that he had already designed a monument, inspired by her poem &quot;The Hand That Swept the Sounding Lyre&quot;, which was soon installed.

Osgood&#x27;s two daughters died the year after their mother; May Vincent Osgood died on June 26, 1851, and Ellen Frances died August 31.

==Writing==
Osgood was a prolific writer and contributed to most of the leading periodicals of the time. She was one of the most admired women poets during the mid-1840s. Osgood was very open and personal in her writings, often discussing the relationships she had with others, despite her shy personality. A large portion of her body of work is love poetry but she also addresses poems to her mother, her sister, her husband, and several friends. The poems written to her children are not sentimental, but literary historian Emily Stipes Watts wrote that they &quot;are honest attempts to express thoughts and emotions never so fully expressed before by women in poetry&quot; depicting a sincere concern for their development and well-being.

Griswold once said that she created poems &quot;with almost the fluency of conversation&quot;. Poe, in a review of her work, wrote that she was &quot;absolutely without rival, we think, either in our own country or in England&quot;. He reviewed her poetry collection &quot;A Wreath of Flowers from New England&quot; in the September 1846 issue of &quot;Godey&#x27;s Lady&#x27;s Book&quot;, saying that its author exhibits &quot;deep feeling and exquisite taste&quot; and her work deserved wider circulation.

<doc id="759640" wikidata="Q1396334" url="?curid=759640" title="Samuel Osgood">
<text>Samuel Osgood (February 3, 1747 – August 12, 1813) was an American merchant and statesman born in Andover, Massachusetts, currently a part of North Andover, Massachusetts. His family home still stands at 440 Osgood Street in North Andover and his home in New York City, the Samuel Osgood House, served as the country&#x27;s first Presidential mansion. He served in the Massachusetts and New York State legislatures, represented Massachusetts in the Continental Congress and was the fourth Postmaster General of the United States (the first under the current Constitution), serving during George Washington&#x27;s first term.

In 1812, he was elected the first president of the newly formed City Bank of New York, which later became Citibank, predecessor of today&#x27;s Citigroup.

==Early life==
John Osgood came to Massachusetts from Andover in England in 1638. In 1646 he started a new settlement there and named it Andover for his home town. Four generations later, Captain Peter Osgood lived there and in 1747 he had a third son whom he named Samuel.

Samuel attended Dummer Academy (now The Governor&#x27;s Academy), and then Harvard College, where he studied theology and graduated in 1770. Later, he returned to Andover to follow a mercantile career. He joined the local militia, was elected to represent the town in the colonial assembly, and in 1775 to the provincial congress that functioned as a revolutionary government.

==The Revolution==
During the American Revolution, Osgood led a local company of minutemen into the Battle of Lexington and Concord in the spring of 1775. They followed the retreating British, and became part of the Siege of Boston. As more troops assembled, he was made Major of a brigade while serving at Cambridge. He became an aide to General Artemas Ward, and was promoted to Colonel. When the siege succeeded in the spring of 1776 Osgood left the army and returned to the provincial congress.

The Provincial Congress named Osgood to the Massachusetts Board of War and he served there until 1780 when the government was reorganized. He was a delegate to the state&#x27;s constitutional convention in 1779-1780. Under the new Constitution he was elected to the Massachusetts State Senate in 1780 and served two terms. The new government named Osgood as one of their delegates to the Continental Congress and he served there from 1782 until 1784.

After a brief term in the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1784, the governor appointed Osgood a judge in 1785 but he soon resigned when the National Congress made him a commissioner of the Treasury later that year. He moved to New York City to take up this office, which he held until the Congressional Government ended.

==Postmaster General and New York career==
When a new U.S. government was installed in 1789, President Washington appointed Osgood the first Postmaster General under the new U.S. Constitution, replacing Ebenezer Hazard who was commissioned postmaster of the city of New York by the Continental Congress. Osgood served as Postmaster from 1789 to 1791. One of the first things Osgood would do is make the Post Office in Baltimore the new regional headquarters, whose postmaster was Mary Katherine Goddard. Osgood ordered Goddard to resign from her post and was replaced by John White.

The seat of the Federal Government at that time was in New York City and the official residence of the President was located at the Samuel Osgood House at 1 Cherry Street, which was the home of Samuel Osgood and his family. Osgood offered the mansion to Washington so that the President and his wife would have what was then considered the finest house in the city as their home. The residence thus became America&#x27;s first executive mansion.

When the Federal Government moved to Philadelphia for a ten-year period before finally settling in Washington, D.C., Osgood chose to remain in New York and resigned his post in 1791. Osgood was a presidential elector in 1792, and cast his votes for George Washington and George Clinton.

He was a member of the New York State Assembly in 1800-01 and 1802, and was Speaker in 1800-01. In 1803, he was appointed by President Thomas Jefferson as Naval Officer of the Port of New York, a position he held until his death. For the last year of his life, he was president of the new City Bank of New York.

Osgood was a member of the American Philosophical Society, and in his later years devoted time to writing and study. He had an extensive correspondence with George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, among others.

==Personal life==
On January 4, 1775, Osgood married Martha Brandon, who died in 1778.
On May 24, 1786, Osgood married Maria Bowne (1754–1813), widow of Walter Franklin and mother of Maria Franklin Clinton, first wife of New York Governor DeWitt Clinton. They had a daughter named Martha Brandon Osgood, who married diplomat Edmond-Charles Genêt. 
Osgood&#x27;s brother, Isaac, married Sarah Pickman (1772–1791) on October 12, 1790; following her death, he married her sister, Rebecca Taylor Pickman (1775–1801), on December 8, 1794. They had a son, Isaac Osgood Jr., whose daughter Charlotte married Moses T. Stevens, and a daughter, Sally Pickman Osgood, who married Bailey Loring and had a son, George B. Loring. Thirdly, Isaac married Mary Pickman in 1802, the cousin of his first two wives. His first two wives were cousins of, and his third wife a sister of, Benjamin Pickman.

==Death==
Osgood died in New York City in 1813.

His birthplace in North Andover, Massachusetts, is located on a street named for his family, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as is his New York residence. Col. Osgood&#x27;s portrait has been housed in the President&#x27;s Room of the U.S. Capitol since Lincoln&#x27;s presidency.

<text>Andreas Osiander (; 19 December 1498 – 17 October 1552) was a German Lutheran theologian and Protestant reformer.

== Career ==
Born at Gunzenhausen, Ansbach, in the region of Franconia, Osiander studied at the University of Ingolstadt before being ordained as a Catholic priest in 1520 in Nuremberg. In the same year he began work at an Augustinian convent in Nuremberg as a Hebrew tutor. In 1522, he was appointed to the church of St. Lorenz in Nuremberg, and at the same time publicly declared himself to be a Lutheran. During the First Diet of Nuremberg (1522), he met Albert of Prussia, Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, and played an important role in converting him to Lutheranism. He also played a prominent role in the debate which led to the city of Nuremberg&#x27;s adoption of the Reformation in 1525, and in the same year Osiander married.

Osiander attended the Marburg Colloquy (1529), the Diet of Augsburg (1530) and the signing of the Schmalkalden articles (1531). The Augsburg Interim of 1548 made it necessary for him to leave Nuremberg, settling first at Breslau (Wrocław), then, in 1549, at Königsberg (Kaliningrad) as professor of the newly founded Königsberg University, appointed by Albert of Prussia. Osiander lived and worked in Königsberg until his death in 1552. Osiander&#x27;s son Lukas (1534–1604), and grandsons Andreas (1562–1617) and Lukas (1571–1638) also worked as theologians. His niece Margarete married the future Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer.

== Works ==
Osiander published a corrected edition of the Vulgate Bible, with notes, in 1522. In 1533, Brandenburg-Nuernbergische Kirchenordnung vom Jahre 1533 was published, with Osiander assisting in both the source material and the final editing. This combined order of worship and catechism was the first work to include the Keys section of Luther&#x27;s Small Catechism, of which Osiander is a suspected author. He wrote a gospel harmony published in Basel in 1537, the &quot;Harmoniae Evangelicae&quot;, which had his Greek harmony on one page and a Latin translation on the facing page. He also included annotations that explained how he had arrived at the order and how he had merged parallel accounts. Osiander&#x27;s gospel harmony was popular and influential. One quirk of Osiander&#x27;s approach was that due to his opinions on the inspiration of the Scriptures - that they were practically a transcript of precise wordings - his approach to handling nearly any difference between gospel accounts was to assert that similar events had happened multiple times. For example, his annotations argue there were four separate but similar healings of blind men at Jericho; Peter warmed himself at a fire four separate times; Jairus&#x27; daughter was raised from the dead on two separate occasions; Jesus was crowned with thorns two times at his trial; and so on. Luther and Calvin seem to have disagreed with Osiander&#x27;s approach, with Luther seemingly making a veiled jab at Osiander&#x27;s harmony in one of his writings, although not naming him directly.

In 1543, Osiander oversaw the publication of the book &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; (On the revolutions of the celestial spheres) by Copernicus. He added a preface suggesting that the model described in the book was not necessarily true, or even probable, but was useful for computational purposes. This was certainly not the opinion of Copernicus, who was probably unaware of the addition. As a result, many readers, unaware that Osiander was the author of the preface, believed that Copernicus himself had not believed that his hypothesis was actually true. Osiander also did not sign the preface added to Copernicus&#x27; book, therefore many readers at the time assumed that this is what Copernicus had actually thought himself.

In 1550 Osiander published two controversial disputations, &quot;De Lege et Evangelio&quot; and &quot;De Justificatione&quot;. In these, he set out his view that justification by faith was instilled in (rather than ascribed to) humanity by Christ&#x27;s divinity, a view contrary to those of Martin Luther and John Calvin although he agreed with Lutheranism&#x27;s fundamental opposition to Roman Catholicism. These beliefs were maintained after his death by Johann Funck (his son-in-law) but disappeared after 1566. Osiander&#x27;s view has been described as similar to Eastern Orthodox teachings on theosis.

Some historians, such as Tuomo Mannermaa, have argued that Luther&#x27;s own views of justification, especially early in his life, were actually closer to the views of Osiander than to those of Flacius or what would later become confessional Lutheranism.

== Theology ==

Osiander was a Christian mystic and his theology incorporated the idea of mystical union with Christ and the Word of God. He believed that justification for a Christian believer resulted from Christ dwelling in a person. Contrary to Luther&#x27;s belief that justification was imputed by God&#x27;s grace, Osiander believed that the righteousness of a believer was accomplished by the indwelling of God; thus, God finds one righteous because Christ is in that person. Calvin rejected these views of Osiander, as did Melanchthon and Flacius. Flacius&#x27; opposing view was that God justifies us by Christ&#x27;s work of obedience on the cross, not by his presence in us.

<doc id="759651" wikidata="Q2528245" url="?curid=759651" title="Viscount Taaffe">
<text>The title Viscount Taaffe, of Corren, was created in the Peerage of Ireland in 1628, together with the subsidiary title Baron Ballymote. From 1661 to 1738, the Viscounts Taaffe were also the Earls of Carlingford.

From the 18th century onwards, the holders of these titles mainly lived in the Holy Roman Empire and subsequently in the Austrian Empire, where they also held the title of Graf Taaffe (German: Count Taaffe), the continental equivalent of an Earl. In 1919, as a consequence of siding with the enemies of Britain in World War I, the viscountcy was one of only three primary titles (together with the royal dukedoms of Albany and Cumberland) to be forfeit under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917. Also in 1919, the family&#x27;s Holy Roman Empire title was no longer recognised by the new Austrian Republic, along with all other Austrian noble titles. In any case, with the death of the 12th Viscount&#x27;s heir in 1967, all these titles, and any claims to them, are now extinct.

==History==
===The Taaffes in Great Britain and Ireland===

From the 13th century, the Taaffes had been one of the leading families in the north of Ireland. Legend suggests that the whole Taaffe family moved from Wales (Britain) to Ireland around 1196; in Britain, they lived in the area currently known as Taff Vale. According to official Irish records, in 1320, William Taaffe had his seat at Smarmore Castle. Another branch of the family, which died out in about 1400, was based at Liscarton Castle in County Meath.

In 1628, Sir John Taaffe was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Viscount Taaffe, of Corren, and Baron Ballymote. He left fifteen children, of whom the eldest, Theobald, who succeeded him as 2nd Viscount Taaffe, took a prominent part in the English Civil War and on the Restoration was created Earl of Carlingford. The 1st Earl was succeeded by his second son Nicholas, who had served in the Anglo-Spanish War, as 2nd Earl. He was killed at the 1690 Battle of the Boyne fighting for the former King James II of England against William III of Orange, when his title was attainted and his estates forfeited. Another son Fr. James Taaffe O.F.M., a Franciscan priest and teacher, served as papal nuncio to Ireland, chaplain to the exiled queen mother Henrietta Maria, in Paris.

===The Taaffes in continental Europe===

The 2nd Earl&#x27;s younger brother, Francis, studied at the University of Olomouc (Olmütz) in the Imperial Margraviate of Moravia, and served at the court of Emperor Ferdinand III as well as under Duke Charles IV of Lorraine, whose most intimate friend he became. He rose to be a Field Marshal in the Habsburg Army, having greatly distinguished himself at the 1683 Battle of Vienna and in the other Turkish campaigns, and was a member of the Order of the Golden Fleece. He was sent on many important diplomatic missions, and at the end of his life was Chancellor and Chief Minister to the Duke of Lorraine. Despite the Jacobite connections of his family, Francis Taaffe was confirmed as 3rd Earl of Carlingford by King William III, and the attainder and forfeiture of the estates incurred by his elder brother was repealed. This favour he owed to his position at the court of the Holy Roman Emperor, William&#x27;s most important ally in the Grand Alliance.

On the 3rd Earl&#x27;s death, his titles and estates went to his nephew Theobald, who succeeded as 4th Earl. His father had fallen during the 1689 Siege of Derry, and he had himself served with distinction in the Habsburg Army.

On the 4th Earl&#x27;s death in 1738, the Earldom of Carlingford became extinct; both the Imperial and Irish estates as well as the viscountcy of Taaffe went to a cousin, Nicholas, who succeeded as 6th Viscount while his Irish estates were claimed under the Popery Act 1704 (2 Anne c. 6 (I)) by a Protestant heir, leading to a lengthy lawsuit. Like so many of his family, Nicholas Taaffe had been brought up in Lorraine, was Chancellor of Duke Leopold and joined the Habsburg Army; he fought in the Silesian Wars against Prussia. After years of fighting for his Irish estates, the case was ended by a compromise embodied in a private act of Parliament, by which the estates were sold and one-third of the value given to Nicholas Taaffe. With the money he acquired the castle of Ellischau (Nalžovy) in Bohemia; he had also inherited other property in the Habsburg dominions. He was naturalised in Bohemia, and left on record that the reason for this step was that he did not wish his descendants to be exposed to the temptation of becoming Protestants so as to avoid the operation of the Penal Laws. Nicholas Taaffe had a distinguished career in the Habsburg Army; he eventually rose to the rank of a Field Marshal, and was created Graf von Taaffe (Count of Taaffe) by Empress Maria Theresa. The Taaffe family thus held titles of nobility from different countries, governed by different rules. While the Irish titles descended according to strict primogeniture, the title of Count was under Austrian and Holy Roman Empire law and applied equally to &quot;all&quot; male-line descendants of the original grantee in perpetuity; male family members were thus styled &quot;Graf&quot;, female family members were styled &quot;Gräfin&quot;.

With the Taaffes now living mainly in the lands of the Habsburgs, a Committee of Privileges of the House of Lords in 1860 recognized the right of the family to hold the Irish title.

Eduard Graf Taaffe, 11th Viscount Taaffe had a distinguished political career in the service of the Habsburgs and served for two terms as Minister-President of Austria under Emperor Francis Joseph I, leading cabinets from 1868 to 1870 and 1879 to 1893. Upon his death in 1895, his peerages passed to Heinrich Graf Taaffe, 12th Viscount Taaffe.

===Loss of both titles===

In World War I, Heinrich Graf Taaffe, 12th Viscount Taaffe and his family remained loyal to the Austrian monarch. Thus in 1919, the 12th Viscount was deprived of the viscountcy following the enactment of the Titles Deprivation Act 1917. Under the provisions of the Act, his heirs and successors were entitled to petition the British Crown for restoration of the title. However, on the death of his last male-line descendant Richard in 1967 no eligible heirs came forward and the title became extinct.

Independent of the legal situation in Britain, the monarchy was abolished in Austria on 12 November 1918, and on 28 April 1919 the newly established Republic of German-Austria under a coalition of the Social Democratic and Christian Social parties abolished all noble titles for Austrians through the &quot;Adelsaufhebungsgesetz&quot;, a law which still remains in effect. This meant that Heinrich Graf Taaffe was no longer recognised as such by the Austrian State, although in society circles and private newspapers, he still appeared as Count.

<text>Distress is a 1995 science fiction novel by Australian writer Greg Egan.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Distress&quot; describes the political intrigue surrounding a mid-twenty-first century physics conference, at which is to be presented a unified Theory of Everything. In the background of the story is an epidemic mental illness, related in some way to the imminent discovery of the TOE. The action takes place on an artificial island called &quot;Stateless&quot;, which has earned the wrath of the world&#x27;s large biotech companies for its pilfering of their intellectual property.

The narrator is a journalist for a science channel called SeeNet named Andrew Worth who carries video recording software in an intestinal implant. He is offered a story on a new illness called Distress, but declines. He journeys to Stateless through a series of convoluted flights to cover a presentation by 27-year-old South African physicist Violet Mosala, supplanting the preproduction by a colleague, Sarah Knight. When he arrives, he is informed by an asex anthrocosmologist named Akili that Violet&#x27;s life is in danger. Violet is finishing her Theory of Everything, which she intends to present on the conference&#x27;s last day.

Through interfacing with a talkative local, Worth learns that Violet plans to emigrate to Stateless after the conference to use her celebrity status to provide an opportunity for South Africa and other nations to end their support for the United Nations boycott of Stateless. He also witnesses the islands&#x27; physical underpinnings: it is basically held up by the activity of millions of micro-organisms. After meeting with a faction of anthrocosmologists, he learns that they believe in the concept that the universe is created by one person&#x27;s Theory of Everything. That person is called the Keystone.

Worth becomes deathly ill and believes he has been infected with cholera by a faction of anthrocosmologists who wanted him to transmit the disease to Violet Mosala. He recovers and is kidnapped by this group, who are led by a rival physicist Worth saw with Violet at the conference. Worth and Akili are held on a tanker where it is explained that these cultists believe Violet&#x27;s TOE will destroy the world. Worth signals for help by connecting his implant to a port on the ship. He and Akili are rescued by citizens of Stateless.

Worth returns to the conference and learns that a biotech conglomerate sent a militia to Stateless, angry at the technology they have appropriated. He negotiates with the militia to let a suddenly ill Violet return to South Africa, where she dies. Before her illness, however, she tasked an AI to synthesize her final theory. The militia moves to take over the main city of Stateless, brutalizing the citizens as they evacuate to the outskirts. While seemingly helpless to do anything at first, they soon strike back at the invaders by having triggered microorganisms consume the cities structural underpinning, sinking it into the ocean. Worth is fired from SeeNet and Sarah Knight replaces him, covering the war. Worth discovers that Sarah was working with the cultists, and that AIs are exhibiting symptoms of the titular mental illness as well. Believing that the AI that wrote the paper became the Keystone and that Distress will continue until a human reads it, Worth downloads and reads the paper, and realizes that all minds, together, collaborate in being &quot;the&quot; Keystone, giving all of humanity an intuitive connection with the universe.

==Themes==
The novel contains a great deal of commentary on gender identities, multinational capitalism, and postmodern thought. It also features Egan&#x27;s usual playful exploration of physical, metaphysical, and epistemological theories.
===Gender roles===
Egan uses his hypothetical future to postulate the existence of not just one but &quot;five&quot; new genders, and introduces a set of new pronouns for gender neutral people. One of the central characters of the novel, Akili Kuwale, provides a demonstration of this change and its implications. As an asexual human, Akili has had all reproductive organs removed entirely. Within the scope of the novel, Egan uses the pronouns &#x27;ve&#x27;, &#x27;ver&#x27;, and &#x27;vis&#x27; to represent Akili&#x27;s definitive gender neutrality.

===Anarchism===
Egan also uses the hypothetical technological advances in &quot;Distress&quot; to explore ideas about anarchism, especially when its protagonist, Andrew Worth, a journalist, travels to the anarchistic man-made island named Stateless. Andrew meets some minor characters on Stateless who explain to him the relationship between anarchistic principles and various ideas such as quantum physics, information theory and independent spirituality.

Worth also meets a painter, Munroe, who attempts to explain how anarchy functions on Stateless.

Munroe is an Australian as are Andrew Worth and Greg Egan himself. Egan uses Munroe to deliver a critique of Australian culture.

A major theme running through Egan&#x27;s presentation of a futuristic anarchism is something called &quot;Technolibération&quot;, which is to do with the liberation of technology and information from corporate control as well as the idea of using advanced technology to enable liberatory social movements.

<text>The Spanish miracle () refers to a period of exceptionally rapid development and growth across all major areas of economic activity in Spain during the latter part of the Francoist regime, 1959 to 1974, in which GDP averaged a 6.5 percent growth rate per year, and was itself part of a much longer period of an above average GDP growth rate from 1951 to 2007. The economic boom came to an end with the 1970s international oil and stagflation crises that disrupted the industrialised world although several scholars have argued that &quot;liabilities accumulated during years of frenzied pursuit of economic development&quot; were in fact to blame for the slow economic growth of the late 1970s.

== Initiation of boom ==

After a very slow recovery from the devastation of the civil war of 1936-1939, the &quot;economic miracle&quot; was initiated by the reforms promoted by a group of economic &quot;technocrats&quot; who, with the backing of Francisco Franco, put in place new policies for the economic development of Spain. The &quot;technocrats&quot;, many of whom were members of Opus Dei, were a new breed of politician that had replaced the old Falangist guard. They abandoned a policy of autarky and implemented &quot;development plans&quot; which saw the liberalization of trade and the rapid growth of industry. From 1960 to 1975, Spain enjoyed the second highest growth rate in the world, behind only Japan, and grew to become the ninth largest economy in the world.

==Industrialization==
The rapid economic expansion reinvigorated old industrial areas: the Basque Country and Ferrol northern coast (iron and steel, shipbuilding), and in and around Barcelona (machinery, textiles, cars and petrochemicals). It also drove an enormous expansion in refining, petrochemicals, chemicals and engineering. To help achieve the rapid development, there was massive government investment through key state-owned companies like the national industrial conglomerate Instituto Nacional de Industria, the mass market car company SEAT in Barcelona, the big steel plant of Ensidesa in Avilés and the shipbuilder Empresa Nacional Bazán. With heavy protection from foreign competition in the domestic Spanish market, those companies led the industrialisation of the country, restoring the prosperity of industrial areas like Barcelona and Bilbao and creating new industrial areas, most notably around Madrid. Although there was economic liberalisation in the period, key enterprises remained under state control.

===Automotive industry===
The automotive industry was one of the most powerful (&quot;locomotives&quot;) of the Spanish Miracle. From 1958 to 1972, it grew at a yearly compound rate of 21.7%. In 1946, there were only 72,000 private cars in Spain, but in 1966, there were over 1 million. That growth rate had no equal in the world. The icon of the &quot;desarrollo&quot; was the SEAT 600 car, produced by the Spanish state company SEAT. More than 794,000 of them were made between 1957 and 1973. At the beginning of that period, it was the first car for many Spanish working-class families. However, at the end of the period, it was the second car for many more.

<doc id="759670" wikidata="Q6876987" url="?curid=759670" title="Miss Lonelyhearts">
<text>Miss Lonelyhearts is a novella by Nathanael West. He began writing it early in 1930 and completed the manuscript in November 1932. Published in 1933, it is an Expressionist black comedy set in New York City during the Great Depression. It is about a male newspaper advice columnist who provides advice to lonesome people. He becomes so affected by their desperate letters that he spirals into depression, drinking, and ill-considered sexual affairs, which lead to his downfall.

==Synopsis==
In the story, Miss Lonelyhearts is the pseudonym for an unnamed male newspaper columnist writing an advice column for the lovelorn and lonesome, a duty that the other newspaper staff consider to be a joke. As Miss Lonelyhearts reads letters from desperate New Yorkers, he feels terribly burdened and falls into a cycle of depression, accompanied by heavy drinking and occasional bar fights. He is also the victim of the pranks and cynical advice of Shrike, his feature editor at the newspaper.

Miss Lonelyhearts tries several approaches to escape the terribly painful letters he has to read: religion, trips to the countryside with his fiancée Betty, and sexual affairs with Shrike&#x27;s wife and Mrs. Doyle, a reader of his column. However, Miss Lonelyhearts&#x27;s efforts do not seem to ameliorate his situation. After his sexual encounter with Mrs. Doyle, he meets her husband, a poor crippled man. The Doyles invite Miss Lonelyhearts to have dinner with them. When he arrives, Mrs. Doyle tries to seduce him again, but he responds by beating her. Mrs. Doyle tells her husband that Miss Lonelyhearts tried to rape her.

In the last scene, Mr. Doyle hides a gun inside a rolled newspaper and decides to take revenge on Miss Lonelyhearts. Lonelyhearts, who has just experienced a religious enlightenment after three days of sickness, runs toward Mr. Doyle to embrace him. The gun &quot;explodes&quot;, and the two men roll down a flight of stairs together.

==Major themes==
The general tone of the novel is one of extreme disillusionment with Depression-era American society, a consistent theme in West&#x27;s novels. However, the novel is a black comedy, characterized by a dark sense of humor and irony. Justus Neiland, among others, has pointed out the use of laughter influenced by philosopher Henri Bergson, in which &quot;the attitudes, gestures, and movements of the human body are laughable in exact proportion as that body reminds us of a machine.&quot;

Literature professors Diane Hoeveler and Rita Bernard analyzed the novel through a Marxist lens as a condemnation of Marx&#x27;s theory of alienation and the colonization of social life by commodification, foreshadowing the stance of the Situationists and Guy Debord in particular. Miss Lonelyhearts is unable to fulfill his role as advice-giver in a world in which both people and advice (in the form of newspaper ads, for example) are mass-produced. People are machines for the sole purpose of laboring and producing value as far as the rest of society is concerned (thus Miss Lonelyhearts&#x27; name), and any advice for them is as mass-produced as an instruction manual for a machine. Lonelyhearts is unable to find a personal solution to his problems because they have systemic causes. West, who worked in the newspaper business before writing &quot;Miss Lonelyhearts&quot;, is also an advice giver of a sort as a novelist. &quot;Miss Lonelyhearts&quot; is similar to a Situationist détournement because it uses a form to critique the same form. The novel also condemns itself by condemning art, which is repeatedly derided by Shrike and compared to religion as an opiate of the masses.

Many of the problems described in &quot;Miss Lonelyhearts&quot; describe actual economic conditions in New York City during the Great Depression, although the novella carefully avoids questions of national politics. Moreover, Marian Crowe declared the novel is particularly important due to its existential import. The characters seem to be living in an amoral world. Hence, they resort to heavy drinking, sex, and parties. Miss Lonelyhearts has a &quot;Christ complex&quot;, which stands for his belief in religion as a solution to a world devoid of values.

==Adaptations==
===1933 film===
In 1933, the novella was very loosely adapted as a movie, &quot;Advice to the Lovelorn&quot;, starring Lee Tracy, produced by Twentieth Century Pictures—before its merger with Fox Film Corporation—and released by United Artists. Greatly changed from the novel, it became a comedy/drama about a hard-boiled reporter who becomes popular when he adopts a female pseudonym and dispenses fatuous advice. He agrees (for a hefty payment) to use the column to recommend a line of medicines, but finds out they are actually harmful drugs when his mother dies. He then agrees to help the police track down the criminals. The movie ends with the main character happily married.

===1957 Broadway play===
In 1957, the novella was adapted into a stage play entitled &quot;Miss Lonelyhearts&quot; by Howard Teichmann. It opened on Broadway at the Music Box Theatre on October 3, 1957, in a production directed by Alan Schneider and designed by Jo Mielziner and Patricia Zipprodt. It starred Pat O&#x27;Brien. It ran for only twelve performances.

===1958 film===

In 1958 the plot was again filmed as &quot;Lonelyhearts&quot;, starring Montgomery Clift, Robert Ryan, and Myrna Loy, produced by Dore Schary and released by United Artists. Although following the plot of the book more closely than &quot;Advice to the Lovelorn&quot;, many changes were made. The movie greatly softens the cynical edge of the original book, and the story is once more given a happy ending—the woman&#x27;s husband is talked out of shooting Miss Lonelyhearts, who finds happiness with his true love, and Shrike is considerably kinder at film&#x27;s end.

===1983 film===
The novella was adapted by Robert E. Bailey and Michael Dinner into a 1983 TV movie, &quot;Miss Lonelyhearts&quot;, starring Eric Roberts in the lead role. Eric Roberts would coincidentally play the lead role in the unrelated 1991 film &quot;Lonely Hearts&quot;.

===2006 opera===
In 2006, composer Lowell Liebermann completed &quot;Miss Lonelyhearts&quot;, a two-act opera. The libretto was written by J. D. McClatchy. The opera, which received its premiere in 2006 at the Juilliard Opera Center, was commissioned by the Juilliard School for its centennial celebration.

The opera was co-produced by the Thornton School of Music Opera Program at University of Southern California, and received its West Coast premiere at the school in 2007. Both premieres were directed by Thornton faculty member Ken Cazan.

==In popular culture==

<text>Michael Lutrell &quot;Pinball&quot; Clemons (born January 15, 1965) is an American-Canadian sports executive and former running back and return specialist who serves as general manager for the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL). He is considered by many to be one of the greatest and most famous Argonauts players of all time, as well as one of the most popular professional athletes in the history of Toronto.

A native of Dunedin, Florida, Clemons played college football at the College of William &amp; Mary and was drafted in the eighth round of the 1987 NFL draft by the Kansas City Chiefs. After two years in the NFL, Clemons joined the Argonauts in 1989, playing with them for twelve seasons where he was a two-time All-Star and a three-time Grey Cup Champion. After retiring from playing, he twice served as their head coach before becoming an administrator, since winning five more Grey Cups. His no. 31 jersey is one of only four that have been retired by the Argonauts.

==Early life==

Clemons was born on January 15, 1965, in Dunedin, Florida, to an 18-year-old single mother, Anna Marie Bryant, who had just graduated from a segregated high school. His father, Willie Clemons, lived an hour and a half away from them while finishing up his university education and later became a school teacher.

Clemons started playing football at age 8 with the Dunedin Golden Eagles, a youth organization co-ordinated by the Police Athletic League.

Clemons and his mother lived in public housing across the street from the city&#x27;s sewer plant until he was 14 years old. At this point in Clemons&#x27; life, his mother married his stepfather and would also become the first African-American to get an administrative job for the City of Dunedin.

Clemons&#x27;s mother was also a heavy influence in him becoming a devout Christian as she was also a clerk at a Baptist church in Dunedin. Clemons and his family currently attend the Meeting House in Oakville, Ontario.

Clemons later formed a relationship with his father, Willie, during his college years. Even then, the relationship between him and his father was more like a nephew to an uncle, being limited to visits during his family vacations down in Florida and regular phone calls. Willie was also invited to the 2003 CFL Eastern Division semi-final game his son was coaching in Toronto vs. the B.C. Lions, marking the first time his father had actually seen him in any capacity with the Argonauts. Shortly afterwards, his father died.

==College career==
Clemons played college football at the College of William and Mary, where he played as a running back and return specialist on the football team, as well as playing varsity soccer for a year. In his four-year college football career, he compiled 4,778 all-purpose yards and was named a Division I-AA all-American.

==Professional career==
Clemons was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the eighth round of the 1987 NFL draft. During the 1987 NFL season, Clemons played in eight games, predominantly as a punt returner, where he collected 19 returns for 162 yards.

When Clemons first joined the Toronto Argonauts in 1989, guest running backs coach Tom Cudney nicknamed him &quot;Pinball&quot; because of his running style. His diminutive size and extraordinary balance allowed him to bounce between defensive players much like a pinball inside a pinball machine. During home games, The Who song &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; would play on the P.A. each time Clemons was involved in a great play. In his first game with the Argonauts, Clemons was named the player of the game. In 1990, Clemons received the CFL&#x27;s Most Outstanding Player Award after setting a single season record for all-purpose yards (3,300). The following year, Clemons won his very first football championship as his Argonauts defeated the Calgary Stampeders to win the Grey Cup. Clemons went on to win two more Grey Cups as a player when Doug Flutie led the Argonauts to win back-to-back titles during the 1996 &amp; 1997 seasons. In 1997, Clemons surpassed his own single season all-purpose yards record from 1990 by recording 3,840 all-purpose yards. This mark stood until 2012, when it was broken by Chad Owens. On September 15, 2000, Clemons played his last ever game as an Argonaut. During his 12-year playing career with the Argonauts he set many team records including career pass receptions (682), punt return yards (6,025), punt returns (610), punt return touchdowns (8), kickoff return yards (6,349), and kickoff returns (300). He also set single season single-season punt return yards (1,070 in 1997), punt returns (111 in 1997), and kickoff returns (49 in 1997). Clemons also amassed a career 25,438 combined yards during the regular season, a CFL record.

In 2008, Clemons was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame, and was also inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2009. In 2016, he was awarded the Order of Sport, marking his induction into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame.

== Coaching career ==

Upon ending his playing career, Clemons became interim head coach of the Toronto Argonauts in 2000, replacing John Huard, who resigned after compiling a 1–6–1 record. When offered the head coaching job by team general manager J. I. Albrecht, Clemons was reluctant to accept it, wanting to spend more time with his family. According to Clemons, &quot;it was an awkward situation. After saying no, they said do us the favour of going home and discussing it with your family. The burden was that this team, this organization, had given our family so much that Canada was going to be our home. The Argos had everything to do with my family becoming a part of this country. Because of all I had been given I decided it was my time to reciprocate.&quot; As interim head coach, Clemons coached the Argos to 6 wins out of their remaining 8 games. He had the interim tag removed from his title at the end of the season. In November 2001, he was promoted to President of the Argonauts and relinquished his role as head coach in the process to Gary Etcheverry.

When Etcheverry was fired as head coach on September 17, 2002, Clemons returned as head coach on an interim basis with 6 games remaining in the 2002 CFL season. Clemons was officially given the head coaching job again on December 17, 2002, while also relinquishing his role as team president. He remained the head coach until 2007. Clemons was nominated for the Annis Stukus Trophy every year from 2002 to 2007, coming up short each time.

In the 2004 CFL season, Clemons was the first black head coach to ever appear in a Grey Cup game. He became the first black head coach to win a Grey Cup championship during that same Grey Cup game, while also being the second black coach to ever guide his team to a pro football championship in North America. (Darren Arbet of the San Jose SaberCats was the first to do so in 2002 with an ArenaBowl XVI victory.) Clemons downplayed this milestone achievement, saying, &quot;To tell you the truth, I don&#x27;t know what it means to be the first Black coach in the (Grey) Cup and to win it. I know that I can&#x27;t do anything by myself, and on my own strength I&#x27;m very little good. Anything I accomplish has to be with the aid of individuals, and this team became like a family and &quot;is&quot; a family, it had very little to do with the colour of my skin&quot;.

Clemons has the second most head coaching wins in Argonauts history with 67. (Bob O&#x27;Billovich is first with 89.) Clemons&#x27; record is 67–54–1 in the regular season over parts of seven seasons, with a 6–5 playoff record (including 1–0 in his lone Grey Cup appearance). As a coach, his nickname was often shortened to &quot;Pinner&quot; by his players. After retiring as head coach, he became the team&#x27;s chief executive officer in 2008.

== Sports administrator ==
From November 2001 to September 2002, Clemons served as the Toronto Argonauts President. He ended his tenure as president to resume his second stint as the team&#x27;s head coach. In 2003, Clemons shared both responsibilities as the team&#x27;s head coach &amp; general manager. Though he was the de facto GM of the Argonauts as a result of an administrative shake up of the team, much of the player roster management duties were deferred to Greg Mohns, the team&#x27;s director of football operations &amp; player personnel. Clemons would relinquish his GM title to Adam Rita at the end of the season. On December 4, 2007, Clemons stepped down as head coach of the Argonauts to become their new chief executive officer. At the end of the 2008 Toronto Argonauts season, Clemons announced that he would no longer act in the day-to-day business of the organization and on May 6, 2009, Bob Nicholson was announced as the new president and chief executive officer of the Argonauts. On that same day, Clemons was appointed the vice-chair of the team. In his new role, Clemons advises the president &amp; C.E.O. on key sales and corporate partner programs, significant community initiatives, and brand and media relations. On October 8, 2019, Clemons was named as the new general manager of the team, replacing Jim Popp who was relieved of his GM duties with 4 games remaining in the 2019 Toronto Argonauts season. Clemons would also work closely with John Murphy, the team&#x27;s vice president of player personnel, in assembling the roster.

==Personal life==

Clemons is also a motivational speaker, making frequent public appearances throughout the community. He is also a partner of the children&#x27;s brand Simply Kids, a line of diapers, baby food and healthcare products found in supermarkets across Canada and the United States.

Currently, Clemons resides in Oakville, Ontario with his wife, Diane (a native Floridian), and three daughters (who were all born in Canada); Rachel, Raven and Rylie. Clemons has described himself (borrowing a quote from C.D. Howe) as an &quot;American by birth but Canadian by choice&quot;. In 2000, Clemons became a permanent resident of Canada. It had once been suggested that Clemons had remained an American citizen to rebuff any calls for him to run for political office, such as for mayor of Toronto. Clemons was the subject of &quot;Pinball: The Making of a Canadian Hero&quot; () a biography written by Perry Lefko published in 2006.

In April 2007, he visited Calderstone Middle School in Brampton to help start a reading program.

On August 21, 2007, Clemons founded the &quot;Michael &#x27;Pinball&#x27; Clemons Foundation&quot; which is dedicated to helping disadvantaged youth.

On March 23, 2009, Clemons appeared on the CTV News @ 6 as a celebrity guest host to do the weather in celebration of Dave Devall&#x27;s retirement. He also worked with Marc Kielburger and Craig Kielburger, founders of Free the Children, in an initiative to build schools and clean water systems in Africa.

On November 14, 2012, Clemons visited and gave a speech about life topics in Markham, Ontario for York Regional District School Board&#x27;s annual QUEST Forum to promote Student Achievement and Well-Being.

On February 28, 2014, Clemons visited the Scouts Canada National Leadership summit to speak about teamwork and working as one team to kick off the new program and strategic plan announcement.

On April 28, 2015, Clemons officially became a naturalized citizen of Canada.

Clemons was recognized on February 10, 2017, by the College of William and Mary, his alma mater, with an honorary degree during Charter Day ceremonies, where he also was principal speaker.

From February 10–26, 2017, Clemons partnered with Global Pet Foods and Air Miles for the &quot;Show Us Your Heart&quot; event. Its goal is to raise money for homeless pets, rescue groups, and animal shelters across Canada through donations made at Global Pet Food stores.

<text>The Plan of San Luis Potosí () is a key political document of the Mexican Revolution, written by presidential candidate Francisco I. Madero following his escape from jail. He had challenged President Porfirio Díaz in the 1910 presidential elections, when Díaz was 80 years old, and garnered a broadbased following. Díaz jailed him when it became clear Madero might win. Madero escaped and drafted the plan to explain why armed rebellion against Díaz was now the only way to remove him from office. It was published on 5 October 1910. It called for nullifying the fraudulent 1910 election of Porfirio Díaz, proclaimed Madero as provisional president, and called on the Mexican people to revolt on 20 November 1910.

==Background events==
Liberal general and politician Porfirio Díaz had come to the presidency of Mexico in 1876 by means of coup against Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada. With a short interregnum in 1880–84, Díaz returned to power and remained there continuously until 1911. He gave an interview to a journalist working for a U.S. publication, James Creelman, saying that he would not run for another term in the 1910 presidential elections. This set off a flurry of political activity, including the entry into politics of a wealthy landowner from the state of Coahuila, Francisco I. Madero. Madero penned a work titled &quot;The Presidential Succession of 1910&quot; and gathered support in Mexico for his candidacy, creating the Anti-Re-electionist Party. Díaz changed his mind about retiring from politics and ran for re-election. To assure his victory, Díaz had Madero jailed. Madero escaped and fled north, crossing the U.S. border at Laredo, Texas, on 7 October 1910. The plan was drafted and reviewed in San Antonio, Texas, but &quot;it was dated, for reasons of convenience, dignity, and neutrality, as in San Luis Potosí, the fifth of October, the last day Madero was in the city&quot;. He asked several Anti-Re-electionists, including Federico González Garza, Roque Estrada, Juan Sánchez Azcona, and Enrique Bordes Mangel, to review his rough draft, but it remained his work. It was &quot;formulated to serve as the ideological banner of the revolution.&quot; The plan was published in November 1910 and secretly distributed. It called for the revolt to begin at 6 p.m. on 20 November 1910.

==Text==
This document contained many reasons why Díaz should not be in power anymore: scandalous elections, stripping away of land, degrading citizens, and the causing of bankruptcy. The document, or &#x27;plan&#x27;, called for the destruction of Díaz&#x27;s authoritarian presidency and the re-institution of democracy through violent direct action on the part of the populace. The results of this document were the start of the Mexican Revolution and the collapse of the presidency of Porfirio Díaz.

The Plan declared the 1910 election illegal, and declared Madero provisional president pending new elections. It called for the people to rise up in arms on Sunday, 20 November 1910, at 6:00 pm and revolt against Diaz and overthrow his government. Few initially heeded the call.

==Subsequent impact==
A series of revolts – particularly in Mexico&#x27;s north and in the state of Morelos, close to Mexico City – put pressure on the Díaz government. Díaz resigned in May 1911 and went into exile in Paris. An interim government was installed and new elections held, with Madero winning. He held office until February 1913, when disorder in Mexico City, known as the Ten Tragic Days (&quot;la decena trágica&quot;) provided the opportunity for a military coup by the head of the federal army, Victoriano Huerta. Madero and his vice president, José María Pino Suárez, resigned under pressure and were then murdered. Forces counter to the Huerta government rose up, with Venustiano Carranza, a politician and wealthy land owner, becoming the leader of the northern forces. He issued the Plan of Guadalupe.

November 20, the date of Madero&#x27;s plan, is celebrated as Revolution Day in Mexico.

<doc id="759690" wikidata="Q624619" url="?curid=759690" title="Slip ring">
<text>A slip ring is an electromechanical device that allows the transmission of power and electrical signals from a stationary to a rotating structure. A slip ring can be used in any electromechanical system that requires rotation while transmitting power or signals. It can improve mechanical performance, simplify system operation and eliminate damage-prone wires dangling from movable joints.

Also called rotary electrical interfaces, rotating electrical connectors, collectors, swivels, or electrical rotary joints, these rings are commonly found in slip ring motors, electrical generators for alternating current (AC) systems and alternators and in packaging machinery, cable reels, and wind turbines. They can be used on any rotating object to transfer power, control circuits, or analog or digital signals including data such as those found on aerodrome beacons, rotating tanks, power shovels, radio telescopes, telemetry systems, heliostats or ferris wheels.

A slip ring (in electrical engineering terms) is a method of making an electrical connection through a rotating assembly. Formally, it is an electric transmission device that allows energy flow between two electrical rotating parts, such as in a motor.

== Composition ==

Typically, a slip ring consists of a stationary graphite or metal contact (brush) which rubs on the outside diameter of a rotating metal ring. As the metal ring turns, the electric current or signal is conducted through the stationary brush to the metal ring making the connection. Additional ring/brush assemblies are stacked along the rotating axis if more than one electrical circuit is needed. Either the brushes or the rings are stationary and the other component rotates.
This simple design has been used for decades as a rudimentary method of passing current into a rotating device.

== Alternative names and uses ==

Some other names used for slip ring are collector ring, rotary electrical contact and electrical slip ring. Some people also use the term commutator; however, commutators are somewhat different and are specialized for use on DC motors and generators. While commutators are segmented, slip rings are continuous, and the terms are not interchangeable. Rotary transformers are often used instead of slip rings in high-speed or low-friction environments.

A slip ring can be used within a rotary union to function concurrently with the device, commonly referred to as a rotary joint. Slip rings do the same for electrical power and signal that rotary unions do for fluid media. They are often integrated into rotary unions to send power and data to and from rotating machinery in conjunction with the media that the rotary union provides.

== History ==
The basic principle of slip rings can be traced back to the late 19th century when they were initially used in early electrical experiments and the development of electrical generators and motors. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution and the increasing demand for electrical power, the technology behind slip rings started to evolve. They became essential components in large-scale electrical machinery, such as turbines and generators, allowing for the transfer of power and signals in machines where a part of the machinery needed to rotate continuously.

== Types ==

Slip rings are made in various types and sizes; one device made for theatrical stage lighting, for example, had 100 conductors. The slip ring allows for unlimited rotations of the connected object, whereas a slack cable can only be twisted a few times before it will bind up and restrict rotation.

=== Mercury-wetted slip rings ===
Mercury-wetted slip rings, noted for their low resistance and stable connection use a different principle which replaces the sliding brush contact with a pool of liquid metal molecularly bonded to the contacts. During rotation the liquid metal maintains the electrical connection between the stationary and rotating contacts. However, the use of mercury can pose safety concerns if not properly handled, as it is a toxic substance. The slip ring device is also limited by temperature, as mercury solidifies at approximately -40 °C.

=== Pancake slip rings ===
A pancake slip ring has the conductors arranged on a flat disc as concentric rings centered on the rotating shaft. This configuration has greater weight and volume for the same circuits, greater capacitance and crosstalk, greater brush wear and more readily collects wear debris on its vertical axis. However, a pancake offers reduced axial length for the number of circuits, and so may be appropriate in some applications.

=== Wireless slip rings ===

Wireless slip rings do not rely on the typical friction-based metal and carbon brush contact methods that have been employed by slip rings since their invention, such as those explored above. Instead, they transfer both power and data wirelessly via a magnetic field, which is created by the coils that are placed in the rotating receiver, and the stationary transmitter. Wireless slip rings are considered an upgrade from — or alternative to — traditional slip rings, as their lack of standard mechanical rotating parts means they are typically more resilient in harsh operating environments and require less maintenance. However, the amount of power that can be transmitted between coils is limited; typically a traditional contact-type slip ring can transmit orders of magnitude more power in the same volume.

<doc id="759697" wikidata="Q3842034" url="?curid=759697" title="DC motor">
<text>A DC motor is an electrical motor that uses direct current (DC) to produce mechanical force. The most common types rely on magnetic forces produced by currents in the coils. Nearly all types of DC motors have some internal mechanism, either electromechanical or electronic, to periodically change the direction of current in part of the motor.

DC motors were the first form of motors to be widely used, as they could be powered from existing direct-current lighting power distribution systems. A DC motor&#x27;s speed can be controlled over a wide range, using either a variable supply voltage or by changing the strength of current in its field windings. Small DC motors are used in tools, toys, and appliances. The universal motor, a lightweight brushed motor used for portable power tools and appliances can operate on direct current and alternating current. Larger DC motors are currently used in propulsion of electric vehicles, elevator and hoists, and in drives for steel rolling mills. The advent of power electronics has made replacement of DC motors with AC motors possible in many applications.

==Electromagnetic motors==
A coil of wire with a current running through it generates an electromagnetic field aligned with the center of the coil. The direction and magnitude of the magnetic field produced by the coil can be changed with the direction and magnitude of the current flowing through it.

A simple DC motor has a stationary set of magnets in the stator and an armature with one or more windings of insulated wire wrapped around a soft iron core that concentrates the magnetic field. The windings usually have multiple turns around the core, and in large motors there can be several parallel current paths. The ends of the wire winding are connected to a commutator. The commutator allows each armature coil to be energized in turn and connects the rotating coils with the external power supply through brushes. (Brushless DC motors have electronics that switch the DC current to each coil on and off and have no brushes.)

The total amount of current sent to the coil, the coil&#x27;s size, and what it is wrapped around decide the strength of the electromagnetic field created.

The sequence of turning a particular coil on or off dictates what direction the effective electromagnetic fields are pointed. By turning on and off coils in sequence, a rotating magnetic field can be created. These rotating magnetic fields interact with the magnetic fields of the magnets (permanent or electromagnets) in the stationary part of the motor (stator) to create a torque on the armature which causes it to rotate. In some DC motor designs, the stator fields use electromagnets to create their magnetic fields which allows greater control over the motor.

At high power levels, DC motors are almost always cooled using forced air.

Different number of stator and armature fields as well as how they are connected provide different inherent speed and torque regulation characteristics. The speed of a DC motor can be controlled by changing the voltage applied to the armature. Variable resistance in the armature circuit or field circuit allows speed control. Modern DC motors are often controlled by power electronics systems which adjust the voltage by &quot;chopping&quot; the DC current into on and off cycles which have an effective lower voltage.

Since the series-wound DC motor develops its highest torque at low speed, it is often used in traction applications such as electric locomotives, and trams. The introduction of DC motors and an electrical grid system to run machinery starting in the 1870s started a new second Industrial Revolution. DC motors can operate directly from rechargeable batteries, providing the motive power for the first electric vehicles and today&#x27;s hybrid cars and electric cars as well as driving a host of cordless tools. Today DC motors are still found in applications as small as toys and disk drives, or in large sizes to operate steel rolling mills and paper machines. Large DC motors with separately excited fields were generally used with winder drives for mine hoists, for high torque as well as smooth speed control using thyristor drives. These are now replaced with large AC motors with variable frequency drives.

If external mechanical power is applied to a DC motor it acts as a DC generator, a dynamo. This feature is used to slow down and recharge batteries on hybrid and electric cars or to return electricity back to the electric grid used on a street car or electric powered train line when they slow down. This process is called regenerative braking on hybrid and electric cars. In diesel electric locomotives they also use their DC motors as generators to slow down but dissipate the energy in resistor stacks. Newer designs are adding large battery packs to recapture some of this energy.

== Commutation ==

=== Brushed ===


The brushed DC electric motor generates torque directly from DC power supplied to the motor by using internal commutation, stationary magnets (permanent or electromagnets), and rotating electromagnets.

Advantages of a brushed DC motor include low initial cost, high reliability, and simple control of motor speed. Disadvantages are high maintenance and low life-span for high intensity uses. Maintenance involves regularly replacing the carbon brushes and springs which carry the electric current, as well as cleaning or replacing the commutator. These components are necessary for transferring electrical power from outside the motor to the spinning wire windings of the rotor inside the motor.

Brushes are usually made of graphite or carbon, sometimes with added dispersed copper to improve conductivity. In use, the soft brush material wears to fit the diameter of the commutator, and continues to wear. A brush holder has a spring to maintain pressure on the brush as it shortens. For brushes intended to carry more than an ampere or two, a flying lead will be molded into the brush and connected to the motor terminals. Very small brushes may rely on sliding contact with a metal brush holder to carry current into the brush, or may rely on a contact spring pressing on the end of the brush. The brushes in very small, short-lived motors, such as are used in toys, may be made of a folded strip of metal that contacts the commutator.

=== Brushless ===
Typical brushless DC motors use one or more permanent magnets in the rotor and electromagnets on the motor housing for the stator. A motor controller converts DC to AC. This design is mechanically simpler than that of brushed motors because it eliminates the complication of transferring power from outside the motor to the spinning rotor. The motor controller can sense the rotor&#x27;s position via Hall effect sensors or similar devices and can precisely control the timing, phase, etc., of the current in the rotor coils to optimize torque, conserve power, regulate speed, and even apply some braking. Advantages of brushless motors include long life span, little or no maintenance, and high efficiency. Disadvantages include high initial cost, and more complicated motor speed controllers. Some such brushless motors are sometimes referred to as &quot;synchronous motors&quot; although they have no external power supply to be synchronized with, as would be the case with normal AC synchronous motors.

=== Uncommutated ===
Other types of DC motors require no commutation.

* Homopolar motor – A homopolar motor has a magnetic field along the axis of rotation and an electric current that at some point is not parallel to the magnetic field. The name homopolar refers to the absence of polarity change. Homopolar motors necessarily have a single-turn coil, which limits them to very low voltages. This has restricted the practical application of this type of motor.
* Ball bearing motor – A ball bearing motor is an unusual electric motor that consists of two ball bearing-type bearings, with the inner races mounted on a common conductive shaft, and the outer races connected to a high current, low voltage power supply. An alternative construction fits the outer races inside a metal tube, while the inner races are mounted on a shaft with a non-conductive section (e.g. two sleeves on an insulating rod). This method has the advantage that the tube will act as a flywheel. The direction of rotation is determined by the initial spin which is usually required to get it going.

== Permanent magnet stators ==

A permanent magnet (PM) motor does not have a field winding on the stator frame, instead relying on PMs to provide the magnetic field against which the rotor field interacts to produce torque. Compensation windings in series with the armature may be used on large motors to improve commutation under load. Because this field is fixed, it cannot be adjusted for speed control. PM fields (stators) are convenient in miniature motors to eliminate the power consumption of the field winding. Most larger DC motors are of the &quot;dynamo&quot; type, which have stator windings. Historically, PMs could not be made to retain high flux if they were disassembled; field windings were more practical to obtain the needed amount of flux. However, large PMs are costly, as well as dangerous and difficult to assemble; this favors wound fields for large machines.

To minimize overall weight and size, miniature PM motors may use high energy magnets made with neodymium or other strategic elements; most such are neodymium-iron-boron alloy. With their higher flux density, electric machines with high-energy PMs are at least competitive with all optimally designed singly fed synchronous and induction electric machines. Miniature motors resemble the structure in the illustration, except that they have at least three rotor poles (to ensure starting, regardless of rotor position) and their outer housing is a steel tube that magnetically links the exteriors of the curved field magnets.

== Wound stators ==


There are three types of electrical connections between the stator and rotor possible for DC electric motors: series, shunt/parallel and compound (various blends of series and shunt/parallel) and each has unique speed/torque characteristics appropriate for different loading torque profiles/signatures.

=== Series connection ===
A series DC motor connects the armature and field windings in series with a common D.C. power source. The motor speed varies as a non-linear function of load torque and armature current; current is common to both the stator and rotor yielding current squared (I^2) behavior. A series motor has very high starting torque and is commonly used for starting high inertia loads, such as trains, elevators or hoists. This speed/torque characteristic is useful in applications such as dragline excavators, where the digging tool moves rapidly when unloaded but slowly when carrying a heavy load.

A series motor should never be started at no load. With no mechanical load on the series motor, the current is low, the counter-Electro motive force produced by the field winding is weak, and so the armature must turn faster to produce sufficient counter-EMF to balance the supply voltage. The motor can be damaged by overspeed. This is called a runaway condition.

Series motors called universal motors can be used on alternating current. Since the armature voltage and the field direction reverse at the same time, torque continues to be produced in the same direction. However they run at a lower speed with lower torque on AC supply when compared to DC due to reactance voltage drop in AC which is not present in DC. Since the speed is not related to the line frequency, universal motors can develop higher-than-synchronous speeds, making them lighter than induction motors of the same rated mechanical output. This is a valuable characteristic for hand-held power tools. Universal motors for commercial utility are usually of small capacity, not more than about 1 kW output. However, much larger universal motors were used for electric locomotives, fed by special low-frequency traction power networks to avoid problems with commutation under heavy and varying loads.

=== Shunt connection ===

A shunt DC motor connects the armature and field windings in parallel or shunt with a common D.C. power source. This type of motor has good speed regulation even as the load varies, but does not have the starting torque of a series DC motor. It is typically used for industrial, adjustable speed applications, such as machine tools, winding/unwinding machines and tensioners.

=== Compound connection ===

A compound DC motor connects the armature and fields windings in a shunt and a series combination to give it characteristics of both a shunt and a series DC motor. This motor is used when both a high starting torque and good speed regulation is needed. The motor can be connected in two arrangements: cumulatively or differentially. Cumulative compound motors connect the series field to aid the shunt field, which provides higher starting torque but less speed regulation. Differential compound DC motors have good speed regulation and are typically operated at constant speed.

<doc id="759701" wikidata="Q57211" url="?curid=759701" title="Hasso von Manteuffel">
<text>Hasso Eccard Freiherr von Manteuffel (14 January 1897 – 24 September 1978) was a German baron born to the Prussian noble von Manteuffel family and was a general during World War II who commanded the 5th Panzer Army. He was a recipient of the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds of Nazi Germany.

After the war, he was elected to the Bundestag (West German legislature) and was the defense-policy spokesman of the Free Democratic Party. A proponent of West German rearmament, he was responsible for coining the new name for the post-World War II West German armed forces, the Bundeswehr.

==Early career==
Hasso von Manteuffel began his military career during the First World War. In 1919, he joined the &quot;Freikorps&quot; and then the newly created &quot;Reichswehr&quot;. In February 1937 he joined the Panzer Troop Command of the OKH, and in February 1939 became a senior professor at Panzer Troop School II in Berlin.

==World War II==
During Operation Barbarossa, Manteuffel commanded a battalion in the 7th Panzer Division, in the Army Group Centre.

In early 1943, Manteuffel was sent to Africa, where on 5 February he became the commander of the Division von Broich/von Manteuffel, serving in 5th Panzer Army. Here Manteuffel took part in the Battle of Tunisia. Manteuffel assumed command of the 7th Panzer Division on 22 August 1943 and was posted to the Eastern Front, which had by then collapsed following the Battle of Kursk and the resulting Soviet counteroffensive. The division retreated during the resulting Battle of the Dnieper.

Manteuffel was appointed commander of the Grossdeutschland Division on 1 February 1944. The division engaged the Red Army west of Kirovograd, then retreated across Ukraine. In late July Großdeutschland was ordered to East Prussia, following the collapse of Army Group Centre in Soviet Operation Bagration. The division failed to break through to the Army Group North in the Courland Pocket.

On 1 September 1944, Manteuffel was promoted to General of Panzer Troops and given command of the 5th Panzer Army on the Western Front, which took part in the Ardennes Offensive. Manteuffel&#x27;s 5th Panzer Army achieved the deepest penetration of Allied lines during the offensive, almost reaching the Meuse River, and engaging the U.S. forces at the Battle of Bastogne. On 10 March 1945 Manteuffel was made the commander of the 3rd Panzer Army on the Eastern Front, attached to Army Group Vistula. His army was assigned to defend the banks of the Oder River north of the Seelow Heights. On 25 April the Soviet 2nd Belorussian Front broke through Third Panzer Army&#x27;s line, forcing a German retreat. On 3 May 1945 Manteuffel surrendered his troops to the British Army at Hagenow, Germany.

==Post-war==

At first Manteuffel was interned at the British-administered Island Farm Special Camp 11 for high-ranking Wehrmacht officers. In 1946 he was handed over to the Americans and took part in the U.S. Army Historical Division project, for which he produced a monograph on the mobile warfare aspect of the Ardennes Offensive.

After his release in December 1946, he entered politics and was a representative of the Free Democratic Party of Germany (FDP) in the German Bundestag from 1953 to 1957. In 1957 he joined the German Party. In the early 1950s Manteuffel advised on the redevelopment of the Bundeswehr.

Manteuffel was charged in 1959 for having a deserter shot in 1944 (he reversed the court martial&#x27;s original verdict of imprisonment and decided for a death sentence, using the Führer Order No.7 as a basis). He was convicted and sentenced to 18 months in prison. Alaric Searle comments that Manteuffel exceeded his powers as a divisional commander, but at the same time: &quot;Manteuffel&#x27;s purely military arguments—that signs of disintegration had appeared on other sectors of the front, that the night before the incident a case of desertion had occurred, and that his division&#x27;s task, in a precarious situation, was to help protect a critical evacuation point—would probably have been accepted in most other Western countries as justifying his action.&quot; Searle agrees with Hermann Balck&#x27;s comment that such a trial would be &quot;unthinkable&quot; for a French or British officer.

He spoke eloquent English; in 1968 he lectured at the United States Military Academy at West Point, speaking about combat in deep snow conditions and worked as a technical adviser on war films. He was interviewed in &quot;The World at War&quot; episode 19 - &quot;Pincers&quot; (August 1944 – March 1945) in 1973. Manteuffel died in 1978.

<text>Rain Joan of Arc Phoenix ( Bottom; born November 21, 1972) is an American actress, musician, and singer. She is the older sister of Joaquin, Liberty and Summer Phoenix and younger sister of River Phoenix.

==Early life==
Phoenix was born Rain Joan of Arc Bottom in Crockett, Texas, the second child of John Lee Bottom and Arlyn Sharon (née Dunetz). Her mother was born in New York to Jewish parents from Russia. Her father was from California. Before Phoenix was born, her mother moved to California, meeting Phoenix&#x27;s father while hitch-hiking. They married in 1969 and joined The Children of God cult working as missionaries in South America. It was there, at the age of three, that Phoenix (accompanied by elder brother River on guitar) first began to sing. They would perform on the streets of Caracas, Venezuela, while handing out Children of God flyers to passers by. The family set out for California in order for the children to enter the entertainment industry. In West Los Angeles, Phoenix and her siblings would perform on the streets for crowds of people. Arlyn took a job at NBC and eventually secured all five Phoenix children with an agent.

Phoenix sang with brother River as an audience warm up act on the show &quot;Real Kids&quot; (1982). Various bit parts followed in TV shows, including an episode of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; in 1986 (billed sometimes as Rainbow Phoenix) and &quot;Family Ties&quot; in 1987. Also in 1987, Phoenix landed a part in the feature film &quot;Maid to Order&quot; alongside Ally Sheedy.

At 15, Phoenix returned to her roots in music and formed the band Aleka&#x27;s Attic with her then 17-year-old brother River. River, along with bass player Josh McKay, wrote music and lyrics while Rain sang backup. The band secured gigs in and around their home town of Gainesville, Florida. By this time, River&#x27;s career had taken off and so the band was often put on hold for River&#x27;s demanding schedule. In 1988, Aleka&#x27;s Attic were signed to a development deal with Island Records and in 1989 released the track &quot;Across The Way&quot; on a benefit album for the animal rights group PETA. In 1991, they made a tour of east coast clubs and colleges. At this time, Phoenix joined her brother River on the set of his tenth movie, &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot;. She met director Gus Van Sant, to whom River suggested she would be perfect for a role in his upcoming project, a film adaptation of Tom Robbins&#x27;s cult novel &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot;. She was cast as head cowgirl Bonanza Jellybean, alongside Uma Thurman.

==River Phoenix&#x27;s death==

A few months after the completion of &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot;, Phoenix flew to Los Angeles with her brother Joaquin to meet River during a break from &quot;Dark Blood&quot;. On the evening of October 30, 1993, they set out, joined by River&#x27;s girlfriend Samantha Mathis, for a night at the Los Angeles club The Viper Room. It would be the last evening Phoenix would spend with her brother River; he died later that night from, according to the coroner&#x27;s report, &quot;acute multiple drug intoxication,&quot; namely an overdose of heroin and cocaine, a concoction called a &quot;speedball.&quot;

Phoenix dealt simultaneously with the loss of her older brother and the media attention that followed. Aleka&#x27;s Attic, by that time consisting of a different line-up, had been working on an album that River had been funding himself. The album was near completion so Phoenix began the long process of mixing and producing the scraps of recordings. The album was never released.

==Late &#x27;90s and 2000s==
In 1994, Phoenix joined R.E.M. in the studio to record backup vocals on the song &quot;Bang and Blame&quot;, to be released on the 1994 album &quot;Monster&quot;, an album dedicated to River. In 1995 Phoenix joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers as a backup singer on their &quot;One Hot Minute&quot; tour. Chili Peppers bassist Flea, who appeared in My Own Private Idaho, was close friends with River, and was there the night he died. The band wrote their song &quot;Transcending&quot; as a tribute to River. She also features in the video for R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;At My Most Beautiful.&quot;

In 1997, Phoenix joined the punk/new wave band The Causey Way, which also included her younger sisters Summer and Liberty. They disbanded in 2001 after the release of two albums and two EPs.

Phoenix returned to acting in 1998 with parts in &quot;I Woke Up Early the Day I Died&quot; (1998), &quot;O&quot; (2001), &quot;Harry and Max&quot; (2004) and &quot;Hitch&quot; (2005).

== Music ==

===Papercranes===
Phoenix formed the band Papercranes in 2003 as lead singer and lyricist. Their self-titled EP was released in 2004 and their first album, &quot;Vidalia&quot;, in 2006. In 2010, Papercranes signed with Manimal Vinyl and in 2011 they released their second album &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Babies in the Woods&quot;. In 2012 came their third and final release – a concept record &quot;Three&quot; followed by a multi-platform artist residency entitled &quot;I.You.We.Three&quot;. Guest musicians include Phoenix&#x27;s younger sisters Summer and Liberty, as well as actor Dermot Mulroney, Libby Lavella, Norm Block, Jenny O, Kirk Hellie and Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who also was a guest musician on tracks for Aleka&#x27;s Attic in the &#x27;90s.

===Venus and the Moon===
In 2013, Phoenix along with Frally Hynes formed the galactic country band Venus and the Moon, which included Chris Stills. The band released a self-titled 7-inch double-A side vinyl in 2014 and, in 2015 , a record titled &quot;Brother, Son&quot;, which wasrecorded on her late brother River&#x27;s 4-track recorder, mixed by Dave Way, and produced by Phoenix.

===Rain Phoenix===
In February 2019, &quot;Time Gone&quot; marked Phoenix&#x27;s first release as a solo artist, with the single &quot;Time Is the Killer&quot; featuring R.E.M.&#x27;s Michael Stipe. The vinyl also contained two previously unreleased tracks by Aleka&#x27;s Attic, &quot;Where I&#x27;d Gone&quot; and &quot;Scales &amp; Fishnails&quot;. It was released on Kro Records in collaboration with Phoenix&#x27;s own LaunchLeft imprint.

Her first solo record, titled &quot;River&quot;, was slated for release on Halloween 2019 via LaunchLeft. The first single &quot;Immolate&quot; was released on what would have been River&#x27;s 49th birthday, August 23, 2019. The record boasts eight tracks and includes a new piano version of &quot;Time is the Killer&quot; featuring Michael Stipe as well as a song entitled &quot;Lost in Motion&quot; co-written by Kirk Hellie and Phoenix&#x27;s late brother River. The record was produced by Kirk Hellie, mixed by Dave Way and mastered by Dave McNair.
==Social initiatives==

Phoenix, together with her brother Joaquin Phoenix, is on the board of directors for the Lunchbox Fund, a non-profit organization that provides a daily meal to students of township schools in Soweto, South Africa. Phoenix also serves on the board of the River Phoenix Center for Peacebuilding, which was founded by her mother and stepfather. Phoenix also works closely with the artists charity the Art of Elysium.

=== Gift Horse Project===
In 2010 Rain created the non-profit Gift Horse Project, which brought together well-known and emerging artists in the service of charity. In 2011, Gift Horse Project released a compilation record to benefit the Lunchbox Fund with artists such as Bright Eyes, Albert Hammond JR, Cobra Starship, Joseph Arthur, Jenny O, Jonathan Wilson, and many more.

===LaunchLeft===
LaunchLeft evolved out of Gift Horse Project, taking the ethos of &quot;artists helping artists&quot; to the for-profit sector. LaunchLeft has produced large events for various non-profit organizations, namely the Art of Elysium (Genesis 2014) and the Bernie Sanders Campaign (&quot;Feel the Bern&quot; the Red Hot Chili Peppers + &quot;Berniechella&quot; 2016).

LaunchLeft is now a podcast hosted by Rain and Summer Phoenix where &quot;famed creatives launch the next wave of music rebels.&quot;

<text>Alan Shorter (May 29, 1932 – April 5, 1988) was an American free jazz trumpet and flugelhorn player, and the older brother of composer and saxophone player Wayne Shorter.

==Biography==
Shorter was born in the Ironbound District in Newark, New Jersey. He started on alto saxophone, but switched to trumpet after graduating from high school. He attended Howard University but soon rebelled against the ultra-conservative atmosphere and dropped out. He later graduated from New York University.

He played his first professional gigs with a local bebop big band called the Jackie Bland Band (other members included his brother Wayne, trombonist Grachan Moncur III, and pianist Walter Davis, Jr.). He was very much a bebop player in his early years, but soon gravitated towards free jazz, and with the exception of six months he spent in a US Army Band, continued to play in that style for the rest of his career.

Shorter recorded two albums as a leader: &quot;Orgasm&quot; (1968) and &quot;Tes Esat&quot; (1971). Both were out of print for many years until re-issued by Verve Records in 2004 and 2005, respectively. He also recorded five albums with saxophonist Archie Shepp (1964–1970), including the classic &quot;Four for Trane&quot; (1964), two albums with Marion Brown (1965–1966), one album with Alan Silva (1970), and made an appearance on one of his brother&#x27;s albums (&quot;The All Seeing Eye&quot; [1965]). Several of these albums feature his unusual compositions, his most famous being &quot;Mephistopheles&quot;.

In the mid-1960s, Shorter moved to Europe, leading his own avant-garde gigs in Geneva and Paris. His style of free jazz sometimes proved to be too far-out for European audiences (his brother remembered that Shorter&#x27;s gigs in Europe would often end with him responding to the crowd&#x27;s boos by yelling, &quot;You&#x27;re not ready for me yet!&quot;), but he generally found European audiences more receptive than those in the U.S. Eventually, he returned to the United States, where he taught briefly at Bennington College but otherwise faded into obscurity. He died of a ruptured aorta in Los Angeles, California in 1988, at age 55, shortly after becoming engaged to Ruth Ann Hancock, a cousin of Herbie Hancock.

Shorter&#x27;s playing is comparable to that of Don Cherry, but with a more aggressive, anarchic bent. His own albums feature his groups functioning as a unit, rather than focusing on his own singular virtuosity. Reportedly, Shorter&#x27;s musical style was akin to his personality: deep and intellectual, thought sometimes intentionally strange (his childhood nickname was &quot;Doc Strange&quot;).

<doc id="759759" wikidata="Q3120087" url="?curid=759759" title="John La Farge">
<text>John La Farge (March 31, 1835 – November 14, 1910) was an American artist whose career spanned illustration, murals, interior design, painting, and popular books on his Asian travels and other art-related topics. La Farge made stained glass windows, mainly for churches on the American east coast, beginning with a large commission for Henry Hobson Richardson&#x27;s Trinity Church in Boston in 1878, and continuing for thirty years. La Farge designed stained glass as an artist, as a specialist in color, and as a technical innovator, holding a patent granted in 1880 for superimposing panes of glass. That patent would be key in his dispute with contemporary and rival Louis Comfort Tiffany.

La Farge rented space in the Tenth Street Studio Building at its opening in 1858, and he became a longtime presence in Greenwich Village. In 1863 he was elected into the National Academy of Design; in 1877 he co-founded the Society of American Artists in frustration at the National Academy&#x27;s conservatism. In 1892 La Farge was brought on as an instructor with the Metropolitan Museum of Art Schools to provide vocational training to students in New York City. He served as president of the National Society of Mural Painters from 1899 to 1904. In 1904, he was one of the first seven artists chosen for membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

==Early life==

La Farge was born in New York City to wealthy French parents, Jean Frédéric &quot;John Frederick&quot; La Farge and Louise Joséphine &quot;Louisa&quot; La Farge (&quot;née&quot; Binsse de Saint-Victor), and was raised bilingually. As a child, he and his brothers produced a handmade magazine in French entitled &quot;Le Chinois&quot;.

His interest in art began during his studies at Mount St. Mary&#x27;s University in Maryland and St. John&#x27;s College (now Fordham University) in New York. He studied law. His first visit to Paris in 1856 induced him to study painting with Thomas Couture, and become acquainted with an artistic and literary social circle. La Farge&#x27;s earliest drawings and landscapes showed marked originality, especially in the handling of color values.

La Farge returned from Europe in October 1857, which ended his relationship with Couture. He returned to continue his law studies although, in his own words, at the same time &quot;stealing as much time as I could for some of my new friends, the painters and architects.&quot; These included William James Stillman, George Henry Boughton, and members of the second generation of the Hudson River School. These circumstances changed with the death of his father in June 1858: the pressure to attend law school was gone, and there was a significant inheritance which gave him the freedom to take studio space in the newly created Tenth Street Studio Building at 51 West 10th Street in Greenwich Village. The building&#x27;s communal spaces for artists set the conditions for social networking; its central atrium and traditional Saturday receptions were important in the careers of its tenants, and to the artistic reputation of the Village. Its architect Richard Morris Hunt recommended that La Farge study under his brother William Morris Hunt in Newport, Rhode Island. The artist Hunt was also a product of Couture&#x27;s &quot;atelier&quot;.

==Career==
Between 1859 and 1870, La Farge took up illustration, with Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Enoch Arden&quot; and Robert Browning&#x27;s &quot;Men and Women&quot;, and worked on children&#x27;s magazine illustrations with engraver Henry Marsh (American, 1826–1912).

In the 1870s, La Farge began to paint murals, which became popular for public buildings as well as churches. His first mural was painted in Trinity Church, Boston, in 1873. Then followed his decorations in the Church of the Ascension (the large altarpiece) and St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel, New York. In his lunette mural &quot;Athens&quot; at Bowdoin College Museum of Art, a building designed by Charles Follen McKim, the model for the central figure was the African-American muse Hettie Anderson. (Anderson also owned one of his paintings of Samoa.) He also took private commission from wealthy patrons (e.g. Cornelius Vanderbilt) and was reputedly worth $150,000 at one point. La Farge continued to create murals through his career: for the Minnesota State Capitol at St. Paul, at age 71, he executed four great lunettes representing the history of law. Also among his final works were six murals on the theme of eminent lawgivers, beginning with Moses, for the Baltimore City Court House, now the Clarence M. Mitchell Jr. Courthouse.

During an 1880s renovation of the Samuel J. Tilden Mansion, now home to the National Arts Club, La Farge was one of several artisans hired by lead architect Calvert Vaux. He created stained glass panels for the interior of the mansion which remain today.

La Farge traveled extensively in Asia and the South Pacific, which inspired his painting. He visited Japan in 1886 in the company of Henry Adams, and the South Seas in 1890 and 1891, in particular spending time absorbing the culture of Samoa, Tahiti and Fiji, again in Adams&#x27; company. In Hawaii in September 1890 he painted scenic spots on Oahu and traveled to the Island of Hawaii to paint an active volcano. These travels are extensively recounted in his book &quot;Reminiscences of the South Seas,&quot; and in Adams&#x27; letters.

In 1863 he was elected into the National Academy of Design; in 1877 he co-founded the Society of American Artists in frustration at the National Academy&#x27;s conservatism (although he retained his National Academy membership). In 1892 La Farge was brought on as an instructor with the Metropolitan Museum of Art Schools to provide vocational training to students in New York City. He served as president of the National Society of Mural Painters from 1899 to 1904. In 1904, he was one of the first seven artists chosen for membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters. La Farge also received the Cross of the Legion of Honor from the French Government.

==Stained glass==
In 1875, La Farge began experimenting with problems of shifting and deteriorating color, especially in the medium of stained glass. At this time, stained glass had not yet been widely adopted as a medium in the United States, making his early efforts critical to its success. His work rivaled the beauty of medieval windows and added new resources by his use of opalescent glass and by his original methods of layering and welding the glass, which created a sense of three-dimensionality. Opalescent glass had been used for centuries in tableware, but it had never before been formed into flat sheets for use in stained-glass windows and other decorative objects. For his early endeavors, La Farge had had to custom-order flat sheets of opalescent glass from a Brooklyn glass manufacturer.

La Farge filed a patent application on Nov. 10, 1879, shortly after a newspaper account praised a recent window he made for Richard Derby of Long Island as &quot;the first application of a new material [opalescent glass] to windows.&quot; He was granted patent no. 224,831 on February 24, 1880, for a &quot;Colored-Glass Window&quot;, with technical details about manufacturing opalescent sheet glass and layering it to create windows.

* John Harvard Window, Southwark Cathedral, London, England (1907)

Several of his windows, including &quot;Peonies Blown in the Wind&quot; (1880), are in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.

=== Dispute with Tiffany ===

La Farge apparently introduced Tiffany to the new use of opalescent glass sometime in the mid-1870s, showing him his experiments. Sometime in the late 1870s or early 1880s, however, relations between the artists soured, probably due to a lawsuit between the two men.

Eight months later, Tiffany applied for a similar patent, which was granted in 1881 as no. 237,417. The major difference in their patents is that Tiffany lists somewhat different technical details, for instance relating to the air space between glass layers. Since La Farge&#x27;s patent focused more on the material and Tiffany&#x27;s more on its use in construction, it appeared that the two patents might be mutually dependent, prohibiting either artist from making stained-glass windows without the other&#x27;s permission. There is some indication that La Farge may have come to some kind of agreement with Tiffany on the use of La Farge&#x27;s patent, but the details are unclear and disputed by scholars. What does seem certain is that around 1882 La Farge planned to sue Tiffany, claiming that Tiffany had infringed his patent by appropriating some of his working methods for opalescent sheet glass. Official records of the lawsuit have not been found, suggesting it was never filed, but there are multiple references to it in the correspondence of both men. Possibly, as stained glass increased in popularity, drawing other artists to the medium, both La Farge and Tiffany decided it would be too much trouble to legally defend their patents.

==Personal life==

On October 15, 1860, he was married to Margaret Mason Perry (1839–1925) at Newport, Rhode Island. She was the daughter of Christopher Grant Perry, and the granddaughter of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, and great-granddaughter of Sarah Franklin Bache. They were descendants of colonial leaders Governor Thomas Prence (1599–1673) and Elder William Brewster (c. 1567–1644), who had been a passenger on the Mayflower.

Together, Margaret and John had eight children:

* Christopher Grant La Farge (1862–1938), who was a partner in the New York-based architectural firm of Heins &amp; LaFarge. He designed projects in Beaux-Arts style, notably the original Byzantine Cathedral of St. John the Divine, the Yale undergraduate society St. Anthony Hall (extant 1893–1913) and the original Astor Court buildings of the Bronx Zoo.
* Emily Marie La Farge (1862–1890), who married William Rehn Claxton
* John Louis Bancel La Farge (1865–1938), who married Mabel Hooper
* Margaret Angela La Farge (1867–1956)
* Oliver Hazard Perry La Farge (1869–1936), who also became an architect and real estate developer. Part of his career in real estate was in a Seattle partnership with Marshall Latham Bond, Bond &amp; La Farge. He designed the Perry Building, still standing in the city. Later in life O.H.P. La Farge designed buildings for General Motors.
* Joseph Raymond La Farge (1872–1872), who died in infancy
* Frances Aimee La Farge (1874–1951), who married Edward H. Childs (b. 1869)
* John La Farge, Jr., S.J. (1880–1963), who became a Jesuit priest and a strong supporter of anti-racist policies.

La Farge died at Butler Hospital, in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1910. The interment was at Green-Wood Cemetery, in Brooklyn, New York.

Through his eldest son Christopher, he was the grandfather of Christopher La Farge, a novelist and poet, and Oliver La Farge, a noted writer and anthropologist. Peter La Farge, son of Oliver, was a celebrated songwriter in Greenwich Village in the 1960s. He penned &quot;The Ballad of Ira Hayes,&quot; made famous by Johnny Cash.

Through his daughter Frances, he was the grandfather of Frances Sergeant Childs, who was a member of the founding faculty of Brooklyn College, where she was a professor of history.

<text>Tickle Me Elmo is a children&#x27;s plush toy from Tyco Preschool, a division of Tyco Toys, of the Muppet character Elmo from the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. When squeezed, Elmo recites his trademark giggle. When squeezed three times, Elmo shakes and vibrates.

The toy was first produced in the United States in 1996 and slowly became a fad, reaching its apex during the 1996 Christmas shopping season, with some instances of violence reported over the limited available supply. &quot;People&quot; reported that the toy, which retailed for $28.99 according to its MSRP, was being re-sold by scalpers in newspapers and on the Internet for up to $1,500 by the end of 1996.

== Development ==
&quot;Tickles The Chimp&quot;, the precursor to Tickle Me Elmo, was invented by Greg Hyman and Ron Dubren, who had invented Alphie the Robot (a children&#x27;s learning computer) several years prior. In 1995 it was presented to Tyco Preschool as &quot;Tickles The Chimp,&quot; which was a toy monkey with a computer chip which laughed when tickled. At the time, Tyco did not have rights to make the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; plush, but did have the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; plush rights. The toy was worked on for several months as Tickle Me Tasmanian Devil, and sold at the WB Studio Store in California. A short time later, Tyco lost the rights to use the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; property in their products, but gained the rights to &quot;Sesame Street,&quot; thus leading to the creation of Tickle Me Elmo. The invention was originally introduced under Cabbage Patch at Hasbro Industries.

Neil Friedman, who was then president of Tyco Preschool, recalled years later that, &quot;When you played with Tickle Me Elmo for the first time, it brought a smile to everyone&#x27;s face. It was a magical surprise.&quot;

==1996 phenomenon==
Tickle Me Elmo was released in July 1996, with a supply of 400,000 units. The dolls sold well and remained widely available in stores until the day after Thanksgiving, when they suddenly sold out. With the Christmas shopping season approaching, Tyco Preschool ordered 600,000 more dolls from their suppliers. Promotion was helped by Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, who had shown the toy on her TV show in early October, although peak demand and stock shortages did not occur until nearly two months later.

The scarcity of the new toy provoked a shopping frenzy. Two women were arrested in Chicago for fighting over the doll, while in New York City some people ran after delivery trucks hoping to get their hands on Elmo before it reached stores. Someone allegedly purchased a Tickle Me Elmo for $7,100 in Denver. KBIG in Los Angeles had a radio auction for charity December 20, 1996; Bob&#x27;s Pharmacy won and purchased a Tickle-Me-Elmo for $18,500. Robert Waller, a clerk working at a Wal-Mart store in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, was among those injured by &quot;Elmo-mania&quot;. During a Midnight Madness sale on December 14, Robert was unpacking the latest shipment of Tickle Me Elmo, when he became uncomfortably aware of a crowd of about 300 people watching him carefully. He opened a box, pulled out an Elmo - and the crowd stampeded down the aisle. Trampled, he suffered &quot;a pulled hamstring, injuries to his back, jaw and knee, a broken rib and a concussion&quot;.

By the end of December, the entire stock of one million &quot;Tickle Me Elmo&quot; toys had been sold.

==Other &quot;Tickle Me&quot; products==
In early 1997, Tyco released new &quot;Tickle Me&quot; toys based on other characters from &quot;Sesame Street&quot; – first &quot;Tickle Me Ernie&quot; and &quot;Tickle Me Big Bird&quot;, then &quot;Tickle Me Cookie Monster&quot; – but despite good sales, none of these toys achieved as much fame as Tickle Me Elmo. With the re-release of Tickle Me Elmo, &quot;Mini Tickle Me Cookie Monster&quot; and &quot;Mini Tickle Me Ernie&quot; were also put on the market.

The Tickle Me Elmo Surprise, released in late 2001, was an elaborate contest. In its normal play mode, the player would have to find which spot on Elmo&#x27;s body would make him laugh, using clues like &quot;Elmo isn&#x27;t ticklish there&quot; and &quot;Elmo&#x27;s just a little ticklish there&quot;. These versions of the dolls came with an inbuilt real-time clock and would stop its normal play mode on January 9, 2002. Five of the dolls were programmed to deliver a message on this date that the owner had won a prize. The grand prize was US$200,000; other prizes included cars, computers, Power Wheels, and other Fisher-Price products.

===TMX (2006-2007)===
For the tenth anniversary of Tickle Me Elmo, Fisher-Price released a new Elmo doll in 2006 called &quot;TMX&quot;, meaning &quot;Tickle Me (Elmo) Ten&quot; or &quot;Tickle Me Xtreme&quot;. The toy, which was designed by Bruce Lund of Lund and Co. Invention (River Forest, Illinois), was first announced at the American International Toy Fair. Rather than simply vibrating like the original, the TMX rolls around on the floor, laughing and smashing his fist on the ground, begging for the tickler to stop.

The full look of the doll was not revealed until it debuted live on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and arrived on store shelves on September 19, 2006. Toy experts said that the delay was unprecedented, with only a few people in the media allowed to preview the product, and only after signing confidentiality agreements. The packaging was designed so that the doll could not be seen without purchasing it. The box includes a preview flap, but upon opening, only the doll&#x27;s eyes are visible. It requires six AA batteries and costs approximately $40. In a promotional clip, Jim Silver, co-publisher of &quot;Toy Wishes&quot; magazine said, &quot;The first reaction I had was, &#x27;Where are the wires?&#x27; Because I didn&#x27;t think anything like that could move on its own.&quot;.
Toy analyst Chris Byrne told &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;This is a quantum leap forward, another breakthrough in the preschool plush category.&quot; Byrne believed sales would be high, but the reaction would not be as unprecedented. &quot;The culture has moved beyond that, the whole hot-toy phenomenon.&quot; He cited the fact there has not been such a craze since Furby in 1998. However, some members of the media expected a large response. Toys &quot;R&quot; Us stores and Amazon had a pre-sale program for the doll, the first included elaborate in-store displays with a digital countdown to the doll&#x27;s launch. Amazon took more presale orders than it could fulfill. As with the original Tickle Me Elmo doll, demand for the new toy gave rise to some extreme acts. One person in Tampa, Florida was allegedly threatened with a gun to hand over a TMX toy. This was parodied on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, which said the man &quot;was subdued by the new &#x27;Gimmie a Reason Bert&#x27;&quot;.

TMX and other toys helped Mattel&#x27;s earnings for the third quarter of the 2006 financial year to grow by six percent and beat the expectations of financial analysts. 

In January 2007, Mattel announced it would release &quot;TMX Friends&quot;, featuring Elmo, Ernie and Cookie Monster.

===LOL Elmo (2012)===
Playskool released the toy again as &quot;LOL Elmo&quot;. Not a single image of the toy was revealed until the American International Toy Fair 2012; in the Hasbro showroom&#x27;s Sesame Street section, there is a sign printed &quot;Laughter Unleashed! Fall 2012&quot;. Above it was a video of kids giggling. The toy was released in September. It is also known as Tickle Time Elmo. Unlike traditional Tickle Me Elmo dolls, this one features a capacitive sensor on its tummy instead of a button, allowing the player to literally tickle the doll.

===Tickle Me Elmo (2017)===
Playskool made a new version of this toy once again but they made it part of their Playskool Friends lineup. Its behavior is like the 1996 version but has more phrases like &quot;Elmo is one ticklish monster&quot;. This version released in August 2017. It could be found at Walmart, Books-A-Million, Best Buy, Target and Toys-R-Us, among others.

===Tickle Me Elmo (2024)===
Just Play made a new version of this toy once again as part of the Sesame Street toy Range. Its behavior is like the 1996 Tyco version but shakes more and has more ticklish parts. This version was released in April 2024. It could be found online at Amazon.

== Legacy ==
Tickle Me Elmo helped the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop recover from its financial problems that it had been dealing with since the 1980s, and also helped in boosting the popularity of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, which had been facing stiff competition from other children&#x27;s shows throughout the 1990s. Likely as a response to this craze, the show began pushing Elmo to a starring role more heavily, a practice that is still done on the show today. This most noticeably resulted in the show dedicating the last few minutes of every episode to the character, beginning in 1998 with &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot;, with three other Elmo-centric segments debuting on the show since then.

<doc id="759765" wikidata="Q6543025" url="?curid=759765" title="Licence to kill (concept)">
<text>A licence to kill, or license to kill in American English, is a licence granted by a government or government agency to a particular operative or employee to initiate the use of lethal force in the delivery of their objectives. The initiation of lethal force is in contrast to the use of lethal force in self-defence or the protection of life. It is well known as a literary device used in espionage fiction, particularly in the James Bond stories.

==History==
The legitimacy of deadly force usage from country to country is generally controlled by statute, particular and direct executive orders, the common law, or rules of engagement.

Sir Richard Dearlove, former head of the UK Secret Intelligence Service MI6, testified in court as part of the 2007–2008 Diana, Princess of Wales Inquest in agreement with a statement that the SIS (MI6) could only use force &quot;likely to cause injury&quot; if specially authorized to do so by the UK Foreign Secretary.

Dearlove also testified in the same inquest that he was unaware of anyone ever having been assassinated by MI6 during his time as head from 1999 to 2004.

Former MI6 agent Matthew Dunn stated that MI6 agents do not need a licence to kill as a spy&#x27;s primary job is to violate the law in other countries, and if an agent is compromised, they are at the mercy of the authorities of that country.

The idea of a licence to kill is popularly known from the &quot;James Bond&quot; novels and films, where it is signified by the &quot;00&quot; (Double O) designation given to the agents in the series who are licensed to kill; Bond himself is famously agent 007.

<text>Sint-Michiels () is a sub-municipality of the city of Bruges located in the province of West Flanders, Flemish Region, Belgium. It was a separate municipality until 1971. On 1 January 1971, it was merged into Bruges.

The amusement park Boudewijn Seapark with the dolphinarium is situated in Sint-Michiels.

== Bus &amp; Car ==
In 1959 the American long distance bus (coach) operator Continental Trailways made an agreement with the Belgian firm of La Brugeoise et Nivelles to assemble 85 highway coaches, named NEW Silver Eagles, for the American market. The parts and tooling for this venture were supplied by Kässbohrer-SETRA of Germany. SETRA had a contract with Continental to produce the buses but wanted out so it could use all of its production capacity to serve its European customers. La Brugeoise et Nivelles, primarily a maker of railway equipment, agreed to assemble the buses with parts and tooling from SETRA, which arrived in 1960. BN also agreed to help Continental set up its own factory and train its original workers. The BN-built buses were based on the last SETRA Silver Eagles made in 1958. After the contract was fulfilled, BN kept the assembly line open in its factory and it was then operated under the name of Bus &amp; Car, N.V. (Inc.). By the mid-1970s the US dollar had lost significant value on world markets, making production in Belgium uneconomic for customers in the USA. Continental sold its Belgian assets to MOL N.V. of Hooglede, Belgium and the factory closed around 1980. La Brugeoise et Nivelles changed its name to BN and was later bought out by Bombardier of Canada. BN&#x27;s longtime specialty was railway equipment. BN also made several hundred PCC streetcars or trams for the cities of Brussels, Antwerp and Gent in Belgium plus the Dutch capital of The Hague. BN recently started production in 2018 of a large order of double deck passenger equipment for the Belgian Railways. The factory is expected to close when the order is completed in about three more years. The former Bus &amp; Car factory building still exists and is presently a large shopping center.

<doc id="759780" wikidata="Q1618347" url="?curid=759780" title="Alamodome">
<text>The Alamodome is a 64,000-seat domed indoor multi-purpose stadium in San Antonio, Texas. It is located on the southeastern fringe of downtown San Antonio. The facility opened on May 15, 1993, having been constructed at a cost of $186 million.

The multi-purpose facility was intended to increase the city&#x27;s convention traffic and attract a professional football franchise. It also placated the San Antonio Spurs&#x27; demands for a larger arena. The Spurs played in the Alamodome for a decade, then became disenchanted with the facility and convinced Bexar County to construct a new arena for them, now called the Frost Bank Center. The Alamodome&#x27;s regular tenants are currently the San Antonio Brahmas of the United Football League and the UTSA Roadrunners. Recent tenants include the San Antonio Commanders of the Alliance of American Football and the San Antonio Talons of the Arena Football League.

==Features==
The facility is a rectilinear 5-level stadium which can seat up to 64,000 spectators for a typical football game and marching band competitions and is expandable to hold 72,000 spectators.

The stadium was designed to easily convert into a basketball or hockey arena. Converting the stadium for basketball and hockey takes 12–18 hours to set up retractable seating and installing the playing surface. In this configuration, typically only the two lower levels at one or both ends are used. The arena configuration seats 20,662 spectators, but is expandable to 39,500 when the upper level is opened. The stadium can also be adapted into a smaller auditorium space (branded as the &quot;Illusions Theater&quot;), with an intimate, enclosed setting, seating upwards of 11,000 using floor space and the north grandstand.

The Alamodome opened with 38 luxury suites and 6,000 club level seats. The original design specifications called for 66 luxury suites. However, since the Spurs were the only full-time tenant at the time, only 38 luxury suites in the north end of the facility were built. The footprints for the 28 unbuilt luxury suites were open floor space just behind the club level seats that surround the south end of the facility. In 2006, the Alamodome underwent an expansion to accommodate 14 new luxury suites. The Sports Club and the Top of the Dome restaurant also received renovations in 2004.

The Alamodome has two permanent Olympic-size ice rinks that can be used for NHL games, figure skating and speed skating. The facility also contains of meeting rooms and of continuous exhibit space.

==Events and tenants==

The Alamodome is currently the home of the San Antonio Brahmas of the UFL and the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) Roadrunners. Previously, it was home to the San Antonio Spurs of the NBA from 1993 to 2002, the San Antonio Texans of the CFL in 1995, and the San Antonio Commanders of the Alliance of American Football (AAF) in 2019.

The facility also hosts special events such as the annual Alamo Bowl football game, UTSA&#x27;s graduation ceremonies, as well as most of Northside ISD&#x27;s high school graduation ceremonies.

UIL State Football Playoff games are regularly held in the Alamodome, including State Quarterfinals/Region 4 Finals and championship games in 2006, 2007, and 2009.

===NBA basketball===
The Alamodome&#x27;s ability to easily accommodate basketball made it attractive to then-Spurs owner Red McCombs, who had been looking for some time for a larger arena to replace their longtime home, HemisFair Arena. The Spurs moved to the Alamodome after the 1992–93 NBA season. They played nine seasons in the Alamodome from 1993 to 2002, including their first NBA championship season, which was played against the New York Knicks in 1999.

During the regular season, most of the upper level was curtained off. However, on certain weekends and when popular opponents came to town, the Spurs expanded the Alamodome&#x27;s capacity to 35,000 by opening three portions of the upper level. More sections of the upper level were opened for the playoffs, expanding capacity to 39,500. Attendance was 39,514 for Game 1 of the 1999 NBA Finals and 39,554 for Game 2.

Though the late 1990s saw the Spurs soar in popularity, the decision was made to move the team out of the spacious stadium and build a new arena. While the Alamodome had been designed to accommodate basketball, it was primarily a football stadium. As the years passed, Spurs management and fans grew increasingly dissatisfied with its poor sight lines and cavernous feel. Part of the problem was the manner in which the Alamodome was configured for basketball. The basketball court was at one end of the venue with temporary stands on one side of the court, leaving over half of the stadium curtained off (the same problem and configuration existed for the Detroit Pistons in the mid-1980s during their tenancy at the Pontiac Silverdome). Television broadcast trucks were usually set up on the unused half of the playing surface. By comparison, more modern domed stadiums that can accommodate basketball, such as AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, place the basketball court in the center of where the football field would be, allowing for much larger attendances. Additionally, the Spurs tied up the Alamodome for most of the winter and spring due to their deep playoff runs (they only missed the playoffs once in their nine years there). With the Alamodome booked solid well into April, it was difficult to accommodate conventions, concerts or even a prospective football team. Moving the Spurs out of the Alamodome opened up more contiguous dates allowing the facility to schedule more events, though it has yet to host a Super Bowl. The Spurs moved to the new SBC Center after the 2001–02 season.

The 1996 NBA All-Star Game was played in the Alamodome.

The Spurs hosted the Golden State Warriors at the Alamodome to celebrate their 50th anniversary in San Antonio on January 13, 2023, marking the first NBA game held at the Dome since Game 4 of the 2002 Western Conference semifinals. The game set a regular season single-game attendance record with 68,323 spectators.

===College and high school football===

====Alamo Bowl====
The Alamodome is the site of the annual Alamo Bowl, which matches the second-choice teams from the Pac-12 Conference and the Big 12 Conference. The 2006 Alamo Bowl between the Texas Longhorns and the Iowa Hawkeyes was attended by 65,875, which set a facility-record crowd for a sporting event, only to have that record broken by an Alamo Bowl event the next year between Texas A&amp;M and Penn State, which drew 66,166 attendees.

====Corps Classic====
September 16, 2006, marked the first game in a college football &quot;home and home&quot; series, known as the AT&amp;T Corps Classic, between the Texas A&amp;M Aggies and the Army Black Knights. Army has elected to play its &quot;home&quot; game at the Alamodome in order to increase the program&#x27;s exposure around the nation, as it competes as an independent. A sell-out crowd of 64,583 watched the Aggies defeat the Black Knights 28–24. The second game was played at Kyle Field in College Station in 2008.

====East–West Shrine Game====
The 2006 East–West Shrine Game was played in the Alamodome on January 21, 2006. The game is an annual post-season college football all-star game. For most of its history, the game has been played in the San Francisco Bay Area, at San Francisco&#x27;s Kezar Stadium and at Stanford Stadium. In recent years it has been played at AT&amp;T Park. In 2006, the game was played in the Alamodome, moving out of the San Francisco Bay Area for the first time in decades. The Shrine Game was moved once again for its 2007 event, to Robertson Stadium in Houston.

====Texas Football Classic====
From 1999 to 2011, the Alamodome was home to the Texas Football Classic, which featured prominent high school programs from across the state and kicked off the high school football season in Texas. Former participants include former Chicago Bears and University of Texas running back Cedric Benson, University of Iowa quarterback Drew Tate, University of Houston quarterback Kevin Kolb, and University of Missouri quarterback Chase Daniel.

====All-American Bowl====
Since 2002, the Alamodome has hosted the All-American Bowl—a national all-star game for U.S. high school football. Played in early-January, the game features teams representing the eastern and western United States. The 2017 edition hosted a record 40,568 spectators.

====Texas vs. the Nation====
In 2011, the Texas vs. The Nation game was moved to San Antonio and was renamed the NFLPA Game, after the new sponsor of the event. The concept of The NFLPA Game remained &quot;Texas vs. the Nation&quot; with seniors having ties to the state of Texas taking on top seniors from across the Nation. That was a one-year deal; the game became the NFLPA Collegiate Bowl in 2012.

====UTSA Roadrunners====
The UTSA Roadrunners football program began using the stadium in 2011. The Roadrunners set records for largest attendance at an initial game for a start-up NCAA college football program at 56,743, and largest average attendance for a start-up program&#x27;s first season at 35,521. Its standard capacity of 64,000 for football made the Alamodome the largest stadium in Conference USA during UTSA&#x27;s tenure in that conference, and it is also the largest dedicated college stadium in the Roadrunners&#x27; current home of the American Athletic Conference (two NFL stadiums used by other American Conference teams are slightly larger). However, for most games, UTSA only sells tickets for the lower bowl, with a capacity of 36,582.

=====Attendance Records=====
====Conference USA Championship====
The Alamodome hosted the Conference USA Football Championship Game in 2021 and 2022 with UTSA defeating Western Kentucky 49-41 and North Texas 48–27.

====Big 12 Conference championship====
The Alamodome hosted the Big 12 Football Championship Game in 1997, 1999 and 2007.

===Professional football===

====NFL====
The Alamodome has played host to six National Football League preseason games. Two each were played in 1993 and 1994, one in 1995, and one in 2001.

In 2005, the NFL announced that the Alamodome would host three of the New Orleans Saints&#x27; regular season &quot;home&quot; games due to the damage caused to the Louisiana Superdome by Hurricane Katrina. The Saints played the Buffalo Bills (week 4), the Atlanta Falcons (week 6), and the Detroit Lions (week 16) at the Alamodome. Although there have been many NFL preseason games held in San Antonio over the years, these games were the first NFL regular season games played in the city. The Saints also played one 2005 season &quot;home&quot; game in Giants Stadium (against the New York Giants) in East Rutherford, New Jersey, and four others in LSU&#x27;s Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Overall, the Saints averaged 62,665 fans in the 64,000-seat Alamodome for the three games held there, a solid showing despite the short notice to sell tickets due to the hurricane. The Saints and the NFL announced that the team would return to Louisiana for the 2006 season even though at the time the NFL was uncertain where they would play their home games.

Additionally, former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue indicated that if the NFL expands again, San Antonio would be on the short list of candidate cities. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has acknowledged his support for the city&#x27;s efforts to become home to an NFL franchise even though public opinion is that he would never let go of his team&#x27;s presence in the San Antonio market.

The Dallas Cowboys held their 2002, 2003, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2011 preseason training camps at the Alamodome.

On July 29, 2014, it was reported by the &quot;San Antonio Express-News&quot; that Mark Davis met with officials from the city of San Antonio, Texas, to discuss the possibility of relocating the Raiders to San Antonio. Davis confirmed that he did speak with San Antonio city officials while visiting San Antonio to honor former Raiders wide receiver Cliff Branch&#x27;s induction into a local Hall of Fame, but did not comment on whether he was considering relocation to San Antonio. If the Raiders had relocated to San Antonio, the Alamodome would almost certainly have been used as a temporary home until a new NFL stadium was built. The Raiders decided against moving to San Antonio, first proposing unsuccessfully to return to its previous home in Los Angeles, then ultimately receiving permission to relocate to Las Vegas in 2020 by constructing Allegiant Stadium.

====CFL====
The Alamodome was also home to the San Antonio Texans for the 1995 CFL season. The stadium was attractive to the Canadian Football League (which made an ill-fated attempt to expand to the U.S. between 1993 and 1995) since it was one of the rare American facilities that could fully accommodate the CFL&#x27;s larger playing field and, having just recently opened, was one of the most modern facilities in a league where the majority of its teams were playing in decades-old or poorly fit stadiums. Its seating could be retracted to fit the full 65-yard width and 150-yard length of a regulation Canadian football field (which is 34% larger than the American field).

In the first CFL playoff game ever played between two U.S.-based franchises, the Texans defeated the Birmingham Barracudas 52–9 at the Alamodome on November 5, in front of 13,031 fans. The team then lost to the eventual champion Baltimore Stallions, 21–11, in Baltimore six days later, ending their season. This also proved to be the last game in franchise history; despite respectable attendance (15,573 average for ten home games) and manageable financial losses, widespread dysfunction among most of the rest of new American franchises led to the Texans&#x27; demise. (This made the Texans-Stallions game the last significant CFL game to be played in the United States.)

====Arena football====
From 2012 to 2014, the Alamodome was home to the San Antonio Talons of the Arena Football League. The Talons, who relocated from Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 2011, won the Central Division title in 2012 with a 14–4 record but were upset in the first round of the playoffs by Utah. The team slipped to 10–8 in 2013, missing the playoffs, then to 3-15 the following year, after which they folded. Attendance at the Dome for the Talons was mediocre at best, averaging 7,209 for 28 home games.

====Alliance of American Football (AAF)====
In 2019, the Alamodome was the home of the San Antonio Commanders of the Alliance of American Football, with the Commanders playing the AAF&#x27;s inaugural game on February 9, 2019, against the San Diego Fleet. The Alamodome hosted each of the fledgling league&#x27;s four best crowds, averaging 27,391 per contest (more than double that of the league&#x27;s other seven teams, who averaged 13,524) before the AAF was shuttered in April 2019.

====The Spring League====
In October 2020, Fox Sports 1 reached a multi-year agreement to televise The Spring League along with the option to acquire a minority stake in TSL. The initial agreement was to play a mini-season in late October and November 2020. The league began its fall season October 27 with six teams competing in a 12-game format over four weeks in a bubble environment, based out of the Alamodome. After experiencing problem with the COVID-19 virus at the Dome, however, the final week&#x27;s games were rescheduled for a high school field in San Antonio, then cancelled. The TSL championship game, also originally scheduled to be played at the Alamodome, was held at Camping World Stadium in Orlando on December 15, 2020.

====XFL/UFL====
The XFL announced that the San Antonio Brahmas would play at the Alamodome for the 2023 season on July 28, 2022. The Brahmas opened the season on February 19, 2023, in an 18–15 loss against the St. Louis Battlehawks in front of a crowd of 24,245.

The Alamodome hosted the inaugural XFL championship game on May 13, 2023. San Antonio was chosen to host because of its history of large events at the Alamodome.

===College basketball===
The NCAA Final Four was first hosted at the Alamodome in 1998; Kentucky won the tournament. Then in 2004, it hosted when Connecticut defeated Georgia Tech in the championship game. It again hosted in 2008, with Kansas defeating Memphis. The Final Four returned in 2018 with Villanova defeating Michigan; this time, the event used the current &quot;center court&quot; configuration mandated by the NCAA, where the game is played on an elevated court and all seating is utilized, allowing a crowd of over 70,000. The Final Four is scheduled to be hosted again in 2025.

The Alamodome has also hosted the Women&#x27;s Final Four in 2002, 2010, and 2021 (will be hosted again in 2029), as well as the 2011 NCAA women&#x27;s volleyball Final Four.

===Baseball===
From 2013 to 2017, the Texas Rangers played exhibition games at the Alamodome to close out their spring training camp, the only time baseball has been played there. The Rangers took on the San Diego Padres in 2013, the Houston Astros in 2014, the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2015, the Kansas City Royals in 2016, and the Cleveland Indians in 2017.

The stadium is considered unsuitable for regular baseball use, since the right-field fence is only 272 feet from home plate, well below the required 325 feet.

===Soccer===
Due to San Antonio&#x27;s proximity to Mexico, the Alamodome has hosted Mexican soccer teams in various events since the mid-2000s in addition to American teams.

The Mexican national soccer team first played in the Alamodome on June 19, 2004, in a FIFA World Cup qualifier, defeating Dominica 10–0 in front of 37,642 fans. Mexico returned on November 10 for a friendly against Guatemala, winning 2–0 in front of 22,000 fans. Mexico played an exhibition match against South Korea on January 29, 2014, attended by 54,313 people. An exhibition match between Mexico and the United States on April 15, 2015, sold out the stadium, attracting a crowd of 64,369. The US won the game 2–0, thanks to goals from Jordan Morris and Juan Agudelo. The match was marred by Mexico&#x27;s displeasure with the temporary grass field laid on the Alamodome floor, which was described as &quot;uneven&quot; and &quot;full of patches&quot;.

The United States women&#x27;s national soccer team played an exhibition match against Trinidad and Tobago at the Alamodome on December 11, 2015, as part of their &quot;Victory Tour&quot; following the 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. The match was attended by 10,690 people.

The Alamodome was announced as a host venue for a doubleheader at the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup, and played host to a double-header on July 16, 2017, between Mexico and Curaçao and El Salvador and Jamaica.

Two matches in the 2005 InterLiga series were played on the Alamodome on January 6, 2005, featuring Mexican club teams Club América, Chiapas F.C., Deportivo Toluca F.C., and Club Necaxa. Club América returned for an exhibition match against Santos Laguna on July 9, 2016.

The Alamodome was to be the home venue of a planned Major League Soccer (MLS) franchise in 2005, but the league was unable to come to an agreement with the city. A new expansion bid plans to use Toyota Field, a soccer-specific stadium used by San Antonio FC, for the MLS team instead of the Alamodome.

===Other sports===

The 1993 U.S. Olympic Festival held some of the first paid events in the Alamodome in July and August 1993, including the opening and closing ceremonies and ice skating events.

The now-defunct San Antonio Dragons of the International Hockey League played some games in 1997 and 1998 at the Alamodome when its home, Freeman Coliseum, was unavailable during the annual San Antonio Stock Show &amp; Rodeo (a similar scheduling conflict the Spurs now face at the newer Frost Bank Center). The Professional Bull Riders (PBR) has held two Built Ford Tough Series events in the Alamodome (2007, 2008).

Two NHL pre-season games were held at the Alamodome. The Dallas Stars faced off against the Los Angeles Kings in back-to-back seasons at the Alamodome in 1994 and 1995. The Stars defeated the Kings 3–2 on September 27, 1994, with 14,342 fans in attendance (this was one of the last hockey games to take place before the 1994–95 NHL lockout). The following year Dallas claimed a 4–2 victory over the Kings in front of 8,122 hockey fans on September 26, 1995. Hockey Hall of Fame forward Wayne Gretzky participated in both preseason matchups.

In college football, Notre Dame has played two Shamrock Series (home-away-from-home) games here against Washington State in 2009 and Army in 2016.

===Music===
After the opening ceremonies, the first major event held at the facility was Paul McCartney&#x27;s The New World Tour concert, which took place on May 29, 1993.

The Alamodome has played host to music festivals, including Ozzfest. It has also hosted concerts to artists such as Shakira, The Rolling Stones, U2, Prince, Elton John, Tina Turner, Rod Stewart, AC/DC, George Strait, Britney Spears, Guns N&#x27; Roses, *NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, Janet Jackson, Metallica, Pink Floyd, Alice Cooper, Def Leppard, Mötley Crüe, Scorpions, Rammstein and many more.

Every summer, Drum Corps International hosts its DCI San Antonio – Southwestern Championships at the Alamodome. This event marks the first time in the DCI season all the World Class drum corps compete against each other on the same field, and therefore get scored by the same judges.

The Alamodome also hosts the Bands of America Super-Regional Championships every year in November, as well as the University Interscholastic League State Marching Band Contest.

===Other events===
The Alamodome was used as a filming location for the film &quot;Selena&quot;, a biographical film chronicling the life of Tejano musician Selena. It was used as a stand-in for the Astrodome in Houston.

From July 5 to July 16, 2006, the Alamodome hosted the ELCA Youth Gathering. Approximately 40,000 youth and adult leaders attended the event, between the two weeks it was spread.

On September 10, 1993, Julio César Chávez Sr. challenged Pernell Whitaker for the WBC welterweight boxing championship title. The match, infamously, ended in a draw. In April 2013, Austin Trout fought the undefeated Canelo Alvarez at the Alamodome.

The Alamodome hosted the 2015 General Conference Session of Seventh-day Adventists.

Over the Fourth of July weekend in 2010, San Antonio hosted its largest convention ever. The 75th annual World convention of alcoholics anonymous. Over 50,000 people from 75 different countries attended meetings and seminars around the city The three main meetings of the convention were held in the Alamodome.

The Alamodome hosted Impact Wrestling&#x27;s Lockdown event on March 10, 2013.

The Alamodome has hosted WWE&#x27;s Royal Rumble pay-per-view event three times. The first occurrence took place on January 19, 1997, in front of a packed crowd of just over 60,000 and saw San Antonio native Shawn Michaels defeat Sycho Sid for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in the main event. The event also saw Texas native Stone Cold Steve Austin win the first of his record-setting three Royal Rumble matches. The second Royal Rumble to be held at the Alamodome took place 20 years later on January 29, 2017, in front of just over 52,000 fans in attendance. Randy Orton last eliminated Roman Reigns to win the Royal Rumble match in the night&#x27;s main event. Five years later in September 2022, WWE announced the Royal Rumble would return to the Alamodome for the 2023 event on January 28. The event had an attendance of 51,338. Rhea Ripley and Cody Rhodes won their respective Royal Rumble matches at the event. Roman Reigns defeated Kevin Owens in the main event to retain the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship and was betrayed by his Bloodline member Sami Zayn afterwards.

On March 20–24, 2022, it was used for the qualifying rounds of American Ninja Warrior&#x27;s Season 14.

==Renovations==
On April 15, 2005, the San Antonio City Council voted to spend close to $6.5 million to renovate the Alamodome in an effort to lure a Major League Soccer franchise to the city. After the election of Phil Hardberger as the new mayor, those efforts were abandoned, though the approved renovations to the facility continued as planned. The city administration and local business leaders have re-focused their efforts to bringing an NFL franchise to San Antonio.

On April 19, 2007, the San Antonio City Council unanimously approved an additional $8.3 million to fund renovations and enhancements to the facility.

In the summer of 2008 the audio system was upgraded.

In 2009 new LED video panels were added to the 5th level.

Although when the Alamodome was built for NFL football, by today&#x27;s standards the facility would have to undergo renovations and add a considerable number of luxury suites in order to make it a profitable venue for an NFL team. In 2024, the city estimated a renovated Alamodome, anchoring a new sports park in downtown San Antonio, could combine to cost $3-4 billion.

In 2011, the Alamodome introduced a new configuration branded as the Illusions Theater, wherein the north end of the stadium can be partitioned into a smaller, pop-up auditorium setting with a ceiling, carpeting, and stage. The configuration includes up to 1,000 seats of floor space, and can seat up to 11,600 when using the existing grandstand. The configuration was designed to host mid-sized events (which, prior to its closure and renovation, were primarily held at the San Antonio Municipal Auditorium), including concerts, conventions, and graduation ceremonies. The project had a budget of $1 million.

In 2016, the San Antonio City Council approved $50 million worth of upgrades to modernize the facilities to keep it competitive for NCAA events. The improvements include a new media center, upgrades to the locker rooms, expanded concourses and added concessions, 4 new video screens and ribbon boards wrapping the 5th level, a new sound system, and other technology upgrades, and upgraded lighting.

<text>Ten Years and Running is a compilation album by American punk rock band MxPx, released on May 21, 2002 on Tooth and Nail Records, the album consists of nineteen songs spanning MxPx&#x27;s career, mostly from Tooth and Nail releases but including a song each from the A&amp;M releases &quot;Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo&quot;, &quot;The Ever Passing Moment&quot;, &quot;The Broken Bones&quot;, and Fat Wreck Chords&#x27; &quot;The Renaissance EP&quot;. The band self-produced a re-recording of &quot;Punk Rawk Show&quot; and two new songs, &quot;My Mistake&quot; and &quot;Running Away,&quot; for the compilation. A music video was made for &quot;My Mistake.&quot; Tim Palmer either mixed or remixed all of the songs except &quot;My Life Story&quot; and &quot;The Broken Bones.&quot;

The album is not a greatest hits album, as it omits MxPx&#x27; more well-known singles &quot;Responsibility&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m OK, You&#x27;re OK,&quot; but is considered a retrospective of the first ten years of the band.

<text>Caryl Whittier Chessman (May 27, 1921 – May 2, 1960) was a convicted robber, kidnapper, serial rapist, and writer who was sentenced to death for a series of crimes committed in January 1948 in the Los Angeles area. Chessman was charged with 17 counts and convicted under a loosely interpreted &quot;Little Lindbergh law&quot; – later repealed, but not retroactively – that defined kidnapping as a capital offense under certain circumstances. His case attracted worldwide attention, and helped propel the movement to end the use of capital punishment in the state of California.

While in prison, Chessman filed numerous legal actions of dubious merit that led to him being considered vexatious. One judge wrote in 1957: &quot;[Chessman is] playing a game with the courts, stalling for time while the facts of the case grow cold.&quot; Chessman wrote four books, including his 1954 memoir &quot;Cell 2455, Death Row&quot;. The book was adapted for the screen in 1955 and stars William Campbell as a character modelled after Chessman.

He was executed in California&#x27;s gas chamber in 1960.

==Early years==
Chessman was born Carol Whittier Chessman ( was, at the time, a popular name for boys of Danish descent; Chessman himself later changed the spelling to ) in St.Joseph, Michigan, the only child of Serl Whittier and Hallie Lillian (&quot;née&quot; Cottle) Chessman, both devout Baptists. In 1922, the family relocated to Glendale, California. Chessman&#x27;s father became despondent after failing at each of a series of jobs, and attempted suicide twice. In 1929, Chessman&#x27;s mother was paralyzed in a car accident. As a child, Chessman had asthma, which left him weak, and he also contracted encephalitis, which he later claimed changed his personality. After recovering he began to rebel against his parents&#x27; strict Baptist upbringing by committing petty crimes. The family was hit hard by the Depression, and Chessman later recalled that he stole food and other items as an adolescent to help his parents.

In July 1937, Chessman was caught stealing a car and sent to Preston School of Industry (also known as Preston Castle), a reform school in Northern California. He was released in April 1938, only to return a month later after stealing another car. In October 1939, Chessman was sent to the Los Angeles County Road Camp after yet another car theft. It was there that he met a group of young criminals known as the &quot;Boy Bandit Gang.&quot; After his release from the road camp he joined the gang and, in April 1941, was arrested in connection with a number of gang-related robberies and shootouts with police. As the gang&#x27;s leader, Chessman was convicted of robbery and sent to San Quentin State Prison, then transferred to the California Institution for Men in Chino. He escaped in October 1943 but was arrested a month later. Convicted on another robbery charge, Chessman was sentenced to five years to life and served the minimum, mostly at Folsom State Prison. He was released in December 1947 and returned to Glendale.

==Crimes and conviction==
In the first three weeks of January 1948, a number of robberies and thefts were reported throughout the Greater Los Angeles Area. On January 3, two men robbed a haberdashery in Pasadena with a .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol. On January 13, a 1946 Ford coupe was stolen from a Pasadena street. On January 18, a man driving a car described as a 1947 Ford coupe fitted with a police red light stopped a vehicle near Malibu Beach, then used a .45 caliber pistol to rob the vehicle&#x27;s occupants. Later that day a second couple were robbed in the same manner near the Rose Bowl. Police quickly began to suspect a common perpetrator, and Los Angeles newspapers dubbed the suspect &quot;The Red Light Bandit.&quot; On January 19, a third couple were robbed as they sat parked on a hill in West Pasadena, and the woman, Regina Johnson, was forced to perform oral sex on her assailant. On January 22, a fourth couple returning home from a church dance was pulled over on Mulholland Drive. The assailant dragged the girl, 17-year-old Mary Alice Meza, a short distance to his vehicle. Her boyfriend then drove away and was pursued by the assailant. After an unsuccessful attempt to force the male victim off the road, the perpetrator drove Meza to a secluded area where he forced her to engage in oral and anal sex, threatening to kill her boyfriend if she did not comply.

The following day, police in North Hollywood attempted to stop a 1946 Ford coupe matching the description given by Meza and her boyfriend, and also by witnesses to a robbery at a clothing store in Redondo Beach earlier that day. After a high-speed chase, the vehicle&#x27;s occupants, Chessman and David Knowles, were captured and arrested. After a 72-hour interrogation, during which Chessman later claimed he was beaten and tortured, Chessman confessed to the &quot;Red Light Bandit&quot; crimes. He was also positively identified by the rape victims, Johnson and Meza. In late January 1948, Chessman was indicted on 18 counts of robbery, kidnapping, and rape. After a three-week trial in May, he was convicted on 17 of the 18 counts, and was sentenced to death. The prosecution was led by district attorney J. Miller Leavy. Chessman&#x27;s accomplice, Knowles, was tried and convicted as an accessory in the store robberies, but his conviction was reversed on appeal in 1950 due to an absence of direct incriminating evidence and &quot;impermissible abuse of the law.&quot;

==Appeals and controversy==

Part of the controversy surrounding the Chessman case stemmed from the state&#x27;s unusual application of the death penalty. At the time, under California&#x27;s version of the &quot;Little Lindbergh Law,&quot; a crime that involved kidnapping with bodily harm could be considered a capital offense. Two of the counts against Chessman alleged that he dragged Johnson 22 feet from her car before demanding oral sex, and that he abducted Meza against her will, driving her a considerable distance before raping her. The court ruled that both actions fit the law&#x27;s definition of kidnapping with bodily harm, thus making Chessman subject to the death penalty under the law. The law was repealed by the time his trial began but was in effect at the time of the crimes; the repeal was not applied retroactively.

Chessman asserted his innocence from the outset, arguing throughout the trial and the appeals process that he was alternately the victim of mistaken identity, or of a conspiracy to frame him; he also claimed to know the identity of the real perpetrator, but refused to reveal it. He further alleged that the confession he signed during his initial police interrogation was coerced through force and intimidation.

Over the course of nearly twelve years on death row Chessman filed dozens of appeals, acting as his own attorney, and successfully avoided eight execution deadlines, often by a few hours. Most appeals were based on assertions that he was forced to go to trial unprepared; that the trial itself was unfair; that confessions obtained by force and intimidation and promises of partial immunity were used in evidence against him; that California&#x27;s &quot;Little Lindbergh Law&quot; was unconstitutional; and that the transcript of record forwarded upon appeal to the state supreme court was incomplete, and important parts of the proceedings were missing or incorrectly recorded. In 1957 the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the State of California to conduct a full review of the transcripts. The review concluded that the transcripts were substantially accurate.

Chessman also took his case to the public through letters, essays and books. His four books—&quot;Cell 2455, Death Row&quot;; &quot;Trial by Ordeal&quot;; &quot;The Face of Justice&quot;; and &quot;The Kid Was a Killer&quot;—became bestsellers. He sold the rights to &quot;Cell 2455, Death Row&quot; to Columbia Pictures, which made a 1955 film of the same name, directed by Fred F. Sears, with William Campbell as Chessman. Chessman&#x27;s middle name, Whittier, was used as the surname of his alter ego protagonist in the film. The manuscript of his fourth book, &quot;The Kid Was a Killer,&quot; was seized by San Quentin warden Harley O. Teets in 1954 as a product of “prison labor.&quot; It was eventually returned to Chessman in late 1957, and published in 1960.

Chessman&#x27;s books and public campaign ignited a worldwide movement to spare his life, while focusing attention on the larger question of the death penalty in the United States, at a time when most Western countries had abandoned it, or were in the process of doing so. The office of California Governor Pat Brown was flooded with appeals for clemency from noted authors and intellectuals from around the world, including Aldous Huxley, Ray Bradbury, Norman Mailer, Dwight Macdonald, and Robert Frost, and from such other public figures as former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, Marlon Brando, and Billy Graham.

The Chessman affair put Brown, an opponent of the death penalty, in a difficult position. He was unable to grant Chessman executive clemency as the California Constitution required the commutation of a two-time felon&#x27;s death sentence to be ratified by the California Supreme Court, which declined ratification by a vote of 4–3. After a long period of inaction Brown finally issued a 60-day stay a few hours before the February 19, 1960, scheduled execution. He issued the stay, he said, out of concern that the execution could threaten the safety of President Dwight D. Eisenhower during an official visit to South America, where the Chessman case had inflamed anti-American sentiment. Pat Brown&#x27;s son and future Governor Edmund G. &quot;Jerry&quot; Brown unsuccessfully lobbied his father to spare Chessman.

==Execution==
Brown&#x27;s stay of execution, along with Chessman&#x27;s last appeals, ran out in April 1960, and Chessman finally went to the gas chamber at San Quentin Prison on May 2, twenty-five days before his 39th birthday. According to some sources, a last-minute attempt by a California Supreme Court justice to impose a new stay pending a habeas corpus motion failed when a court secretary misdialed the prison&#x27;s phone number; by the time the call was routed to the execution chamber, the execution had begun and could not be halted. During the execution Chessman vigorously nodded his head, a pre‑arranged signal to reporters that he was experiencing pain. Chessman&#x27;s body was cremated, as per his wishes, at the Mount Tamalpais Mortuary and Cemetery in San Rafael, California. He requested that his ashes be interred with his parents&#x27; at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, but Forest Lawn refused the request on &quot;moral grounds.&quot; His ashes were buried at the Mount Tamalpais Cemetery, then disinterred in 1974 by Chessman&#x27;s attorney Rosalie Asher and scattered off the coast of Santa Cruz Island.

Chessman was dubbed &quot;the first modern American executed for a non-lethal kidnapping.&quot; His time on death row – eleven years and ten months – was then the longest ever in the United States, a record that was broken in the post-&quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; era on March 15, 1988, when Willie Darden Jr. was executed in Florida&#x27;s electric chair for a 1973 murder. Several months after Chessman&#x27;s execution, Billy Wesley Monk was executed on November 21, 1960, for kidnapping two women, attempting to rape the first and raping the second, and was the last to be executed for a non-lethal kidnapping in the United States. Further executions for non-lethal offenses, including robbery and rape, occurred as late as 1964, but have not been carried out since the 1960s. Such convictions were also considerably focused on the Southern states, whereas the executions of Chessman, Monk and Rudolph Wright, gassed in 1962 for an assault (with deadly outcome, although without &quot;mens rea&quot;) possibly faced greater scrutiny for occurring in California.

==In popular culture==
Megan Terry’s play, &quot;The People vs Ranchman&quot;, loosely based on Chessman’s crimes and punishment, was produced Off-Broadway in New York during the 1968–1969 season.

Author Dominique Lapierre visited Chessman several times during his incarceration. Lapierre was then a young reporter working for a French newspaper. His account of Chessman appears in the book &quot;A Thousand Suns.&quot;

Artist Bruce Conner created his sculpture &quot;Child&quot; in 1959–60 as an homage to Chessman.

The radio version of &quot;Dragnet&quot; referenced the Chessman case and the Redlight Bandit in a 1949 episode. The producers changed the storyline of his crimes, allowing the rape victim to die in the fictitious version, justifying the death penalty.

Chessman&#x27;s execution is referenced in Lucio Fulci&#x27;s 1969 giallo &quot;One on Top of the Other&quot;, in which the character of George Dumurrier (Jean Sorel) is prepared to be executed in San Quentin&#x27;s gas chamber. Not only were these sequences shot on location in San Quentin, but several of the prison personnel who were responsible for Chessman&#x27;s death acted in them; a fact that was especially highlighted in the film&#x27;s trailer.

Chessman is mentioned in Neil Diamond&#x27;s 1970 song &quot;Done Too Soon&quot; and in French singer Nicolas Peyrac&#x27;s song &quot;So far away from LA&quot;.

Chessman&#x27;s execution in the gas chamber is mentioned in Richard Brautigan&#x27;s 1967 novella &quot;Trout Fishing in America&quot;.

In 1977, Alan Alda starred in an NBC television movie about Chessman&#x27;s life, &quot;Kill Me If You Can.&quot; This was sometimes shown, subsequently, as &quot;The Caryl Chessman Story.&quot;

The song &quot;The Ballad of Caryl Chessman,&quot; written by the songwriting team of Al Hoffman and Dick Manning, includes the chorus &quot;let him live, let him live, let him live&quot;. It was a minor hit single for Ronnie Hawkins two months before Chessman&#x27;s execution.

Country music star Merle Haggard stated in an interview in 1995 that many years earlier, when he was a prison inmate, observing Chessman&#x27;s preparations for his execution helped to set him on the straight and narrow.

&quot;Chessman&quot;, a 2016 play by Joe Rodota, tells the story of the execution from the viewpoint of Governor Pat Brown.

The song &quot;Broadway Melody of 1974&quot; by the rock group Genesis, off their album &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot;, contains the lyrics: &quot;The cheerleader waves her cyanide wand with the smell of peach blossoms and bitter almond.&quot; (Gas chamber reference) then: &quot;Caryl Chessman sniffs the air and leads the parade, he knows, in a scent, you can bottle all you made.&quot; &quot;Sniffs the air&quot; likely refers to the execution method; also the singer Gabriel pronounces &quot;in a scent&quot; indistinguishably from &quot;innocent&quot;.

Mexican professional &quot;luchador&quot;, &quot;Chessman, the red light killer,&quot; from AAA, is named after Chessman.

A fictionalized version of Chessman appears in James Ellroy&#x27;s 2021 novel &quot;Widespread Panic&quot;.

Chessman is believed by the fictional serial killer Thomas Bishop to be his biological father in the 1979 novel, &quot;By Reason of Insanity&quot; by Shane Stevens.

<text>The Metamorphoses of Apuleius, which Augustine of Hippo referred to as The Golden Ass (Latin: &quot;Asinus aureus&quot;), is the only ancient Roman novel in Latin to survive in its entirety.

The protagonist of the novel is Lucius. At the end of the novel, he is revealed to be from Madaurus, the hometown of Apuleius himself. The plot revolves around the protagonist&#x27;s curiosity (&quot;curiositas&quot;) and insatiable desire to see and practice magic. While trying to perform a spell to transform into a bird, he is accidentally transformed into an ass. This leads to a long journey, literal and metaphorical, filled with inset tales. He finally finds salvation through the intervention of the goddess Isis, whose cult he joins.

==Origin==

The date of composition of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; is uncertain. It has variously been considered by scholars as a youthful work preceding Apuleius&#x27; &quot;Apology&quot; of 158–159, or as the climax of his literary career, and perhaps as late as the 170s or 180s. Apuleius adapted the story from a Greek original of which the author&#x27;s name is said to be an otherwise unknown &quot;Lucius of Patrae&quot;, also the name of the lead character and narrator.

This Greek text by Lucius of Patrae has been lost, but there is &quot;Lucius or the Ass&quot; (, &quot;Loukios ē onos&quot;), a similar tale of disputed authorship, traditionally attributed to the writer Lucian, a contemporary of Apuleius. This surviving Greek text appears to be an abridgement or epitome of Lucius of Patrae&#x27;s text.

==Manuscripts==
The &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; has survived in about 40 manuscripts, all or almost all of which are descendants of codex Laurentianus 68.2 (also called F in critical apparatuses), an extant 11th-century manuscript produced in Monte Cassino. Editors of the text have therefore seen it as their goal to apply textual criticism to this particular manuscript, ignoring the rest except for occasional consultation. The text is characterized by a number of non-standard spellings, notably the frequent interchange of the letters &quot;b&quot; and &quot;v&quot;.

==Plot==
===Book One===

The prologue establishes an audience and a speaker, who defines himself by location, education, occupation, and his kinship with the philosophers Plutarch and Sextus of Chaeronea. The narrator journeys to Thessaly on business. On the way, he runs into Aristomenes and an unnamed traveler. The unnamed traveler refuses to believe Aristomenes&#x27; story. The narrator insults the unnamed traveler and tells a short story about a sword swallower. He promises Aristomenes a free lunch if he will retell his tale. The narrator believes Aristomenes&#x27; tale and becomes more eager to learn about magic. The narrator arrives at Hypata, where he stays with Milo, a friend and miser, and his wife Pamphile. Photis, a serving girl in Milo&#x27;s household, takes the narrator to the baths, after which the narrator goes to the marketplace. There, he buys some fish and runs into his old friend Pytheas, who is now a market official. Pytheas reveals the narrator&#x27;s name as Lucius. Pytheas says that Lucius overpaid for the fish and humiliates the fish-monger by trampling on the fish. Lucius returns to Milo&#x27;s house, hungry and empty-handed. Milo asks Lucius about his life, his friends, and his wanderings, which Lucius grows bored with. Lucius goes to sleep hungry.

===Book Two===

The next morning, Lucius meets up with his aunt Byrrhena in the town, and she brings him home and warns him that Milo&#x27;s wife is an evil witch who wants to kill Lucius, who is interested in becoming a witch himself. He then returns to Milo&#x27;s house, where he makes love to Photis. The next day, Lucius goes to his aunt&#x27;s home for dinner, and there meets Thelyphron, who relates his tale about how witches cut off his nose and ears. After the meal, Lucius drunkenly returns to Milo&#x27;s house in the dark, where he encounters three robbers, whom he soon slays before retiring to bed.

===Book Three===

The next morning, Lucius is abruptly awoken and arrested for the murder of the three men. He is taken to court where he is laughed at constantly and witnesses are brought against him. They are just about to announce his guilt when the widow demands to bring out the dead bodies; but when the three bodies of the murdered men are revealed, they turn out to be puffed-up wineskins. It turns out that it was a prank played by the town upon Lucius, to celebrate their annual Festival of Laughter. Later that day, Lucius and Photis watch Milo&#x27;s wife perform her witchcraft and transform herself into a bird. Wishing to do the same, Lucius begs Photis to transform him, but she accidentally turns him into an ass, at which point Photis tells him that the only way for him to return to his human state is to eat a fresh rose. She puts him in the stable for the night and promises to bring him roses in the morning, but during the night Milo&#x27;s house is raided by a band of thieves, who steal Lucius the ass, load him up with their plunder, and leave with him.

===Book Four===

On a break in his journey with the bandits, Lucius the ass trots over to a garden to munch on what seem to be roses (but are actually poisonous rose-laurels) when he is beaten by the gardener and chased by dogs. The thieves reclaim him and he is forced to go along with them; they talk about how their leader Thrasileon has been killed while dressed as a bear. The thieves also kidnap a rich young woman, Charite, who is housed in a cave with Lucius the ass. Charite starts crying, so an elderly woman who is in league with the thieves begins to tell her the story of Cupid and Psyche.

Psyche is the most beautiful woman on earth, and Venus jealously arranges for Psyche&#x27;s destruction, ordering her son Cupid to arrange for her to fall in love with a worthless wretch. An oracle tells Psyche&#x27;s parents to expose her on a mountain peak, where she will become the bride of a powerful, monstrous being. Psyche is left on the mountain, and carried away by a gentle wind.

===Book Five===

The elderly woman continues telling the story of Cupid and Psyche. Cupid, Venus&#x27;s son, secretly protects Psyche; Cupid becomes Psyche&#x27;s mysterious husband, who is invisible to her by day and visits her only at night. Psyche&#x27;s jealous sisters arouse her curiosity and fear about her husband&#x27;s identity; Psyche, against Cupid&#x27;s commands, looks at him by lamplight which wakes Cupid; Cupid abandons Psyche, who wanders in search of him, and takes revenge on her wicked sisters.

===Book Six===

The elderly woman finishes telling the story of Cupid and Psyche, as Psyche is forced to perform various tasks for Venus (including an errand to the underworld) with the help of Cupid and an assortment of friendly creatures, and is finally reunited with her husband. Then Jupiter transforms Psyche into a goddess. That is the end of the tale. Lucius the ass and Charite escape from the cave but they are caught by the thieves, and sentenced to death.

===Book Seven===

A man appears to the thieves and announces that he is the renowned thief Haemus the Thracian, who suggests that they should not kill the captives but sell them. Haemus later reveals himself secretly to Charite as her fiancé Tlepolemus, and gets all of the thieves drunk. When they are asleep he slays them all. Tlepolemus, Charite and Lucius the ass safely escape back to the town. Once there, the ass is entrusted to a horrid boy who torments him but the boy is later killed by a she-bear. Enraged, the boy&#x27;s mother plans to kill the ass.

===Book Eight===

A man arrives at the mother&#x27;s house and announces that Tlepolemus and Charite are dead, caused by the scheming of the evil Thrasillus who wants Charite to marry him. After hearing the news of their master&#x27;s death, the slaves run away, taking the ass Lucius with them. The large group of travelling slaves is mistaken for a band of robbers and attacked by farmhands of a rich estate. Several other misfortunes befall the travelers until they reach a village. Lucius as the narrator often digresses from the plot in order to recount several scandal-filled stories that he learns of during his journey. Lucius is eventually sold to a Gallus priest of Cybele. He is entrusted with carrying the statue of Cybele on his back while he follows the group of priests on their rounds, who perform ecstatic rites in local farmsteads and estates for alms. While engaging in lewd activity with a local boy, the group of priests is discovered by a man in search of a stolen ass who mistakes Lucius&#x27; braying for that of his own animal. The priests flee to a new city where they are well received by one of its chief citizens. They are preparing to dine when his cook realizes that the meat that was to be served was stolen by a dog. The cook, at the suggestion of his wife, prepares to kill Lucius in order to serve his meat instead.

===Book Nine===

Lucius&#x27; untimely escape from the cook coincides with an attack by rabid dogs, and his wild behavior is attributed to their viral bites. The men barricade him in a room until it is decided that he is no longer infected. The band of Galli eventually pack up and leave.

The narrative is interrupted by The Tale of the Wife&#x27;s Tub.

Soon after, the Galli are accosted by an armed troop who accuse them of stealing from their village temple, and are subsequently detained (with the treasures returned). Lucius is sold into labor, driving a baker&#x27;s mill-wheel. Lucius, though bemoaning his labor as an ass, also realizes that this state has allowed him to hear many novel things with his long-ass ears.

The Tale of the Jealous Husband and The Tale of the Fuller&#x27;s Wife mark a break in the narrative. The theme of the two intervening stories is adultery, and the text appropriately follows with the adultery of the baker&#x27;s wife and the subsequent murder of the baker.

Lucius the ass is then auctioned off to a farmer. The Tale of the Oppressive Landlord is here told. The farmer duly assaults a legionary who makes advances on his ass, Lucius, but he is found out and jailed.

===Book Ten===

Lucius comes into the legionary&#x27;s possession, and after lodging with a decurion, Lucius recounts the Tale of the Murderous Wife. He is then sold to two brothers, a confectioner and a cook, who treat him kindly. When they go out, Lucius secretly eats his fill of their food. At first a source of vexation, when the ass is discovered to be the one behind the disappearing food it is much laughed at and celebrated.

Again he is sold, and he is taught many amusing tricks. Rumor spreads, and great fame comes to the ass and his master. As it happens, a woman is so enamored with the sideshow ass that she bribes his keeper and takes Lucius the ass to her bed. Lucius is then scheduled to have sex in the arena with a multiple murderess before she is to be eaten by wild beasts; the Tale of the Jealous Wife tells her backstory.

After an enactment of the judgment of Paris, and a brief digression on philosophy and corruption, the time comes for Lucius to make his much-anticipated appearance. At the last moment he decides that copulating with such a wicked woman would be repugnant to him, and, moreover, the wild beasts would likely eat him along with her; and so he runs away to Cenchreae, eventually to nap on the beach.

===Book Eleven===

Lucius wakes up in a panic during the first watch of the night. Considering Fate to be done tormenting him, he takes the opportunity to purify himself by seven consecutive immersions in the sea. He then offers a prayer to the Queen of Heaven, for his return to human form, citing all the various names the goddess is known by to people everywhere (Venus, Ceres, Diana, Proserpine, etc.). The Queen of Heaven appears in a vision to him and explains to him how he can be returned to human form by eating the crown of roses that will be held by one of her priests during a religious procession the following day. In return for his redemption, Lucius is expected to be initiated through the Navigium Isidis into Isis&#x27; priesthood, Isis being the Queen of Heaven&#x27;s true name. Lucius follows her instructions and is returned to human form and, at length, initiated into her priesthood.

Lucius is then sent to his ancestral home, Rome, where he continues to worship Isis under the local name, Campensis. After a time, he is visited once more by the goddess, who speaks again of mysteries and holy rites which Lucius comes to understand as a command to be initiated into the mysteries of Isis. He does so.

Shortly afterwards, he receives a third vision. Though he is confused, the god appears to him and reassures him that he is much blessed and that he is to become once more initiated that he might supplicate in Rome as well.

The story concludes with the goddess, Isis, appearing to Lucius and declaring that Lucius shall rise to a prominent position in the legal profession and that he shall be appointed to the College of Pastophori (&quot;shrine-bearer&quot;, from ) that he might serve the mysteries of Osiris and Isis. Lucius is so happy that he goes about freely exposing his bald head.

==Inset stories==

Similar to other picaresque novels, &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; features several shorter stories told by characters encountered by the protagonist. Some act as independent short stories, while others interlock with the original novel&#x27;s plot developments.

===Aristomenes&#x27; Tale===

At the beginning of Book One, Lucius encounters two men arguing on the road about the truth of one&#x27;s story. Lucius is interested, and offers the teller a free lunch for his tale.

Aristomenes goes on business for cheese and he runs into his friend Socrates, who is disheveled and emaciated. Aristomenes clothes Socrates and takes him to the bathhouse. Aristomenes berates Socrates for leaving his family. While they are eating lunch, Socrates tells about his affair with Meroë. Socrates tells Aristomenes that Meroë is an ugly witch who turns her ex-lovers into rather unfortunate animals. Aristomenes doesn&#x27;t believe Socrates&#x27; tale but is nevertheless afraid. Aristomenes barricades the door and they both go to bed. In the middle of the night, Meroë and Panthia break in, cut open Socrates, drain his blood, rip out his heart, and replace it with a sponge. Before leaving, they urinate on Aristomenes. The witches spare Aristomenes because they want him to bury Socrates in the land. Aristomenes fears that he will be blamed for the death of his friend and attempts to hang himself, but is comically stopped when the rope is revealed to be too rotten to support his weight. In the morning, Socrates wakes up and everything seems to be normal. They continue travelling and reach a stream, where Socrates bends to take a drink, which causes the sponge to fall out and him to die. Aristomenes buries Socrates in the ground, and then proceeds on his way.

===Thelyphron&#x27;s Tale===

In Book Two, Thelyphron hesitantly relates a story requested at a dinner party that was previously popular with his friends:

While a student, Thelyphron partakes in many wanderings and eventually runs out of funds. At Larissa, he encounters a large sum being offered to watch over a corpse for the night. Thelyphron is bemused and asks if the dead are accustomed to flee in Larissa. When he asks, a citizen criticises him and tells Thelyphron not to make fun of the task and warns him that shape-shifting witches are quite common in the area, using pieces of human flesh to fuel incantations. Thelyphron takes the job for a thousand drachme and is warned to stay very alert all through the night. The widow is at first hesitant, taking inventory of the body&#x27;s intact parts. Thelyphron requests a meal and some wine, to which she promptly refuses and leaves him with a lamp for the night. A weasel enters the room and Thelyphron, frightened by its appearance, quickly chases it out, then falls into a deep sleep. At dawn, Thelyphron awakes and rushes over to the body in the room; to his relief, he finds the body intact. The widow enters, and calls for Thelyphron to be paid, satisfied with the intact corpse. Thanking the widow, Thelyphron is suddenly attacked by the crowd and narrowly escapes. He witnesses an elder of the town approach the townspeople desperately and claim that the widow had poisoned her husband to cover up a love affair. The widow protests and supposedly fakes her sadness and a necromancer is called to bring back the deceased for the only truly reliable testimony. The corpse awakes, and affirms the widow&#x27;s guilt. The corpse then continues to talk and thanks Thelyphron for his trouble; during the night the witches entered as small animals and began to call the corpse and wake him up. By chance, Thelyphron was both the name of the corpse and the guard. Consequently, the witches steal pieces of his ears and nose instead of from the corpse. The witches cleverly replace the missing flesh with wax to delay discovery. Thelyphron touches his nose and ears to find wax fall out of where they once were in the crowd. The crowd laughs at Thelyphron&#x27;s humiliation.

===Tale of Cupid and Psyche===
In Book Four, an elderly woman tells the story to comfort the bandits&#x27; captives. The story is continued through Books Five and Six.

Psyche, the most beautiful woman in the world, is envied by her family as well as by Venus. An oracle of Venus demands she be sent to a mountaintop and wed to a murderous beast. Sent by Venus to destroy her, Cupid falls in love and flies her away to his castle. There she is directed to never seek to see the face of her husband, who visits and makes love to her in the dark of night. Eventually, Psyche wishes to see her sisters, who jealously demand she seek to discover the identity of her husband. That night, Psyche discovers her husband is Cupid while he is sleeping, but accidentally burned him with her oil lamp. Infuriated, he flies to heaven and leaves her banished from her castle. In attempted atonement, Psyche seeks the temple of Venus and offers herself as a slave. Venus assigns Psyche four impossible tasks. First, she is commanded to sort through a great hill of mixed grains. In pity, many ants aid her in completing the task. Next, she is commanded to retrieve wool of the dangerous golden sheep. A river god aids Psyche and tells her to gather clumps of wool from thorn bushes nearby. Venus next requests water from a cleft high beyond mortal reach. An eagle gathers the water for Psyche. Next, Psyche is demanded to seek some beauty from Proserpina, Queen of the Underworld. Attempting to kill herself to reach the underworld, Psyche ascends a great tower and prepares to throw herself down. The tower speaks, and teaches Psyche the way of the underworld. Psyche retrieves the beauty in a box, and, hoping to gain the approval of her husband, opens the box to use a little. She is put into a coma. Cupid rescues her, and begs Jupiter that she may become immortal. Psyche is granted Ambrosia, and the two are forever united.

The story is the best-known of those in &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; and frequently appears in or is referred to directly in later literature.

===Tale of the Wife&#x27;s Tub===

In the course of a visit to an inn in Book Nine, a smith recounts an anecdote concerning his wife&#x27;s deceit:

During the day, her husband absent at his labors, the smith&#x27;s wife is engaged in an adulterous affair. One day, the smith, work finished well ahead of schedule, returns home prematurely—obviously to his wife&#x27;s great consternation. Panicked, the faithless woman hides her lover in an old tub. After absorbing his spouse&#x27;s efforts at distraction, which take the form of bitter reproaches that his coming back so early betokens a laziness that can only worsen their poverty, the smith announces that he has sold the tub for six drachmae; to this his wife responds by saying that she has in fact already sold it for seven, and has sent the buyer into the tub to inspect it. Emerging, the lover complains that his supposed purchase is in need of a proper scrubbing if he is to close the deal, so the cuckolded smith gets a candle and flips the tub to clean it from underneath. The canny adulteress then lies atop of the tub and while her lover pleasures her, instructs her hapless husband as to where he should apply his energies. To add insult to injury, the ill-used man eventually has to deliver the tub to the lover&#x27;s house himself.

===Tale of the Jealous Husband===

In Book Nine, a baker&#x27;s wife of poor reputation is advised by a female &#x27;confidant&#x27; to be wary of choosing her lover, suggesting she find one very strong of body and will. She relates the story of one of the wife&#x27;s previous school friends:

Barbarus, an overbearing husband, is forced to leave on a business trip, and commands his slave, Myrmex, to watch his wife, Aretë, closely to assure she is being faithful during his time away. Barbarus tells Myrmex that any failure will result in his death. Myrmex is so intimidated that he does not let Aretë out of his sight. Aretë&#x27;s looks charm Philesietaerus who vows to go to any lengths to gain her love. Philesietaerus bribes Myrmex with thirty gold pieces and the promise of his protection for allowing him a night with Aretë. Becoming obsessed with gold, Myrmex delivers the message to Aretë and Philesietaerus pays Myrmex a further ten pieces. While Aretë and Philesietaerus are making love, Barbarus returns but is locked out of the house. Philesietaerus leaves in a hurry, leaving behind his shoes. Barbarus does not notice the strange shoes until the morning, at which point he chains Myrmex&#x27;s hands and drags him through town, screaming, while looking for the shoes&#x27; owner. Philesietaerus spots the two, runs up, and with great confidence shouts at Myrmex, accusing him of stealing his shoes. Barbarus allows Myrmex to live, but beats him for the &#x27;theft&#x27;.

===Tale of the Fuller&#x27;s Wife===

In Book Nine the baker&#x27;s wife attempts to hide her lover from her husband, and entertains to her husband&#x27;s story of the Fuller:

While coming home with the Baker for supper, the Fuller interrupts his wife&#x27;s love-making with a lover. She frantically attempts to hide her lover in a drying cage in the ceiling, hidden by hanging clothes soaked in sulphur. The lover begins to sneeze, and at first the Fuller excuses his wife. After a few sneezes, the Fuller gets up and turns over the cage to find the lover waiting. The Fuller is talked out of beating the young man to death by the Baker, who points out that the young man will shortly die from the sulphur fumes if left in the cage. The Fuller agrees and returns the lover to the cage.

The tale is used to contrast the earlier tale told to the Baker&#x27;s wife of high suspicion and quick judgments of character by her &#x27;auntie&#x27; with the overly naive descriptions of nefarious people by her husband.

===Tale of the Jealous Wife===

In Book Ten a woman condemned to public humiliation with Lucius tells him her crimes:

A man goes on a journey, leaving his pregnant wife and infant son. He commands his wife that if she bears a daughter, the child is to be killed. The child is indeed a daughter, and in pity, the mother convinces her poor neighbours to raise her. Her daughter grows up ignorant of her origin, and when she reaches a marriageable age, the mother tells her son to deliver her daughter&#x27;s dowry. The son begins preparation to marry the girl off to a friend, and lets her into his home under the guise of her being an orphan to all but the two of them. His wife is unaware the girl is his sister, and believes he keeps her as a mistress. His wife steals her husband&#x27;s signet ring and visits their country home accompanied by a group of slaves. She sends a slave with the signet to fetch the girl and bring her to the country home. The girl, aware that the husband is her brother, responds immediately, and on arrival at the country home is flogged by the wife&#x27;s slaves, and put to death by a torch placed &#x27;between her thighs&#x27;. The girl&#x27;s brother takes the news and falls gravely ill. Aware of suspicions around her, his wife asks a corrupt doctor for instant poison. Accompanied by the doctor, she brings the poison to her husband in bed. Finding him surrounded by friends, she first tricks the doctor into drinking from the cup to prove to her husband the drink is benign, and giving him the remainder. Unable to return home in time to seek an antidote, the doctor dies telling his wife what happened and to at least collect a payment for the poison. The doctor&#x27;s widow asks for payment but first offers the wife the remainder of her husband&#x27;s collection of poisons. Finding that her daughter is next of kin to her husband for inheritance, the wife prepares a poison for both the doctor&#x27;s widow and her daughter. The doctor&#x27;s widow recognizes early the symptoms of the poison and rushes to the Governor&#x27;s Home. She tells the Governor the whole of the connected murders and dies. The wife is sentenced to death by wild beasts and to have public intercourse with Lucius the ass.

==Overview==

The text is a precursor to the literary genre of the episodic picaresque novel, in which Francisco de Quevedo, François Rabelais, Giovanni Boccaccio, Miguel de Cervantes, Voltaire, Daniel Defoe and many others have followed. It is an imaginative, irreverent, and amusing work that relates the ludicrous adventures of one Lucius, a virile young man who is obsessed with magic. Finding himself in Thessaly, the &quot;birthplace of magic,&quot; Lucius eagerly seeks an opportunity to see magic being used. His overenthusiasm leads to his accidental transformation into an ass. In this guise, Lucius, a member of the Roman country aristocracy, is forced to witness and share the miseries of slaves and destitute freemen who are reduced, like Lucius, to being little more than beasts of burden by their exploitation at the hands of wealthy landowners.

&quot;The Golden Ass&quot; is the only surviving work of literature from the ancient Greco-Roman world to examine, from a first-hand perspective, the abhorrent condition of the lower classes. Yet despite its serious subject matter, the novel remains imaginative, witty, and often sexually explicit. Numerous amusing stories, many of which seem to be based on actual folk tales, with their ordinary themes of simple-minded husbands, adulterous wives, and clever lovers, as well as the magical transformations that characterize the entire novel, are included within the main narrative. The longest of these inclusions is the tale of Cupid and Psyche, encountered here for the first but not the last time in Western literature.

===Style===
Apuleius&#x27; style is innovative, mannered, baroque and exuberant, a far cry from the more sedate Latinity familiar from the schoolroom. In the introduction to his translation of &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;, Jack Lindsay writes:

Lindsay&#x27;s own version is: &quot;She was lewd and crude, a toper and a groper, a nagging hag of a fool of a mule.&quot;

Sarah Ruden&#x27;s recent translation is: &quot;A fiend in a fight but not very bright, hot for a crotch, wine-botched, rather die than let a whim pass by—that was her.&quot;

Apuleius&#x27; vocabulary is often eccentric and includes some archaic words. S. J. Harrison argues that some archaisms of syntax in the transmitted text may be the result of textual corruption.

===Final book===

In the last book, the tone abruptly changes. Driven to desperation by his asinine form, Lucius calls for divine aid, and is answered by the goddess Isis. Eager to be initiated into the mystery cult of Isis, Lucius abstains from forbidden foods, bathes and purifies himself. Then the secrets of the cult&#x27;s books are explained to him and further secrets revealed, before going through the process of initiation which involves a trial by the elements in a journey to the underworld. Lucius is then asked to seek initiation into the cult of Osiris in Rome, and eventually becomes initiated into the &quot;pastophoroi&quot;, a group of priests that serves Isis and Osiris.

==Adaptations and influence==

The style of autobiographical confession of suffering in &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; influenced Augustine of Hippo in the tone and style—partly in polemic—of his &quot;Confessions&quot;. Scholars note that Apuleius came from the Algerian city of M&#x27;Daourouch in Souk Ahras Province, where Augustine would later study. Augustine refers to Apuleius and &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; particularly derisively in &quot;The City of God&quot;.

The writing of William Shakespeare was influenced by &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; e.g. &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; from c. 1595 where the character Bottom&#x27;s head is transformed to that of an ass.

In 1517, Niccolò Machiavelli wrote his own version of the story, as a terza rima poem. It was uncompleted at the time of his death.

In 1708, Charles Gildon published an adaptation of &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;, titled &quot;The New Metamorphosis&quot;. A year later in 1709, he published a re-adaptation, titled &quot;The Golden Spy&quot;, which is regarded as the first, fully-fledged it-narrative in English.

In 1821, Charles Nodier published &quot;Smarra ou les Demons de la Nuit&quot; influenced by a reading of Apuleius.

In 1883, Carlo Collodi published &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot; which includes an episode in which the puppet protagonist is transformed into an ass. Another character who is transformed alongside him is named Lucignolo (Candlewick or Lampwick), a possible allusion to Lucius. The episode is frequently featured in its subsequent adaptations.

In 1885, Walter Pater published &quot;Marius the Epicurean&quot;, a coming-of-age novel set in Ancient Rome. In Chapter V, he included his own translation of Apuleius&#x27; tale of Cupid and Psyche, which profoundly influenced the protagonist&#x27;s philosophical, aesthetic, and intellectual development.

In 1915, Franz Kafka published the short story &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; under a quite similar name, about a young man&#x27;s unexpected transformation into an &quot;Ungeziefer&quot;, a verminous bug.

In 1956, C. S. Lewis published the allegorical novel, &quot;Till We Have Faces&quot;, retelling the Cupid–Psyche myth from books four through six of &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; from the point of view of Orual, Psyche&#x27;s jealous ugly sister. The novel revolves upon the threat and hope of meeting the divine face to face. It has been called Lewis&#x27;s &quot;most compelling and powerful novel&quot;.

In 1985, comic-book artist Georges Pichard adapted the text into a graphic novel titled &quot;Les Sorcières de Thessalie&quot;.

In April 1999, the Canadian Opera Company produced an operatic version of &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; by Randolph Peters, the libretto of which was written by celebrated Canadian author Robertson Davies. An operatic production of &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; also appears as a plot device in Davies&#x27;s novel &quot;A Mixture of Frailties&quot; (1958).

In 1999, comic-book artist Milo Manara adapted the text into a fairly abridged graphic novel version named &quot;Le metamorfosi o l&#x27;asino d&#x27;oro&quot;.

In the fantasy novel &quot;Silverlock&quot; by John Myers Myers, the character Lucius Gil Jones is a composite of Lucius, Gil Blas in &quot;Gil Blas&quot; by Alain-René Lesage, and Tom Jones in &quot;The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling&quot; by Henry Fielding.

<text>Crowley Lake is a reservoir on the upper Owens River in southern Mono County, California, in the United States. Crowley Lake is south of Mammoth Lakes.

The lake was created in 1941 by the building of the Long Valley Dam by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP), as storage for the Los Angeles Aqueduct and for flood control. The dam is high and impounds . For more on the history of the lake, see Owens Lake.

It is known for its trout fishing. Between 6,000 and 10,000 anglers hit the lake on opening day. Crowley Lake Fish Camp, run in cooperation with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, is the only way to access the lake, and visitors can rent boats, book camping sites, and buy supplies at the Fish Camp.

The lake is named after Fr. John J. Crowley, &quot;the desert Padre&quot;, who was a key figure in Owens Valley history and a local hero. When it became obvious that the city of Los Angeles&#x27;s appropriation of the water supply had made agriculture impossible in the Owens Valley, many of the residents of the Valley lost all hope. Father Crowley traveled the Valley, convincing many of them that it could become a tourist destination; however, he was critical of where the dam was to be located. Father Crowley was killed in 1940 in an automobile accident.
== Columns ==

Upon completion of the reservoir in 1941, strange columnar formations were spotted along its eastern shore. These formations feature spaced columns, some rising tall, spanned at the top with arches and resembling the arcades of Moorish architecture. For decades speculative theories of their natural origin were proposed, but no detailed study was conducted.

In 2015 geologists from UC Berkeley concluded that the formations are the result of snowmelt seeping down into volcanic ash from the catastrophic eruption of the Long Valley Caldera, then rising up again as steam. The water deposited erosion-resistant minerals that remained behind as the ash eroded around them. The researchers counted nearly 5,000 such pillars, which appear in groups and vary widely in shape, size, and color over an area of . Some of the columns stand erect approximately a foot apart and feature ringed apertures. Others are warped or leaning at various angles, and others are half-submerged and resemble the petrified remains of dinosaur vertebrae.

<text>Hank McCamish Pavilion, nicknamed The Thrillerdome and originally known as Alexander Memorial Coliseum, is an indoor arena located on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia. It is the home of the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men&#x27;s basketball and Yellow Jackets women&#x27;s basketball teams.

The venue previously hosted the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1968 to 1972 and again from 1997 to 1999. Tech&#x27;s women&#x27;s volleyball team occasionally uses the facility as well, primarily for NCAA tournament games and other matches that draw crowds that would overflow the O&#x27;Keefe Gymnasium.

==History==

===Alexander Memorial Coliseum===

The Alexander Coliseum opened in 1956 at the intersection of 10th Street and Fowler on the northeast end of the Georgia Tech campus. The building was named for William A. Alexander, Georgia Tech&#x27;s football coach from 1920 to 1944 and the third athletic director (after John W. Heisman); his tenure as coach included the 1928 Rose Bowl team (the 1928 season, the Rose Bowl itself was played on January 1, 1929). The huge dome was constructed by Calvert Iron Works, Co., a local Atlanta company that built many Atlanta landmarks. It was designed and built without any support pillars to obstruct the view of any fans during games. It served as a replacement for the Third Street Gymnasium (later known as the Heisman Gym) on the campus of Georgia Tech, an 1,800-seat arena opened just 18 years before. The arena&#x27;s original capacity was 6,996 seats, though crowds larger than that sometimes assembled for big games.

Between 1956 and 1996, the Coliseum had undergone three major renovations. In 1986, 2,150 seats were added in what was previously an upper walkway around the rim of the arena. In 1989–1990, 750 seats were added in the end zone areas. At this point official capacity attained 9,596 seats, which would be the peak capacity in the Coliseum&#x27;s history. The last major renovation was during 1995–1996, prior to the 1996 Summer Olympics. The floor was lowered to increase seating, 12 luxury suites were added, and many of the benches were replaced with chairback seats. Sightlines were also improved for those sitting in the first few rows of the side of the court opposite the benches. Connected to the south end of the Coliseum are the Luck Building, and the Coliseum Annex. The facility was renamed Alexander Memorial Coliseum at McDonald&#x27;s Center for 10 seasons from 1996 to 2005 in conjunction with a $5.5 million donation to help pay for the mid-1990s renovation, which decreased seating capacity to 9,191.

The Coliseum played host to the Atlanta Hawks after they moved from St. Louis while The Omni was under construction, and again between 1997 and 1999, after the Omni was demolished and while Philips Arena was being built on its site. During the latter period, the Hawks played most of their home games at the Georgia Dome with the remainder at the Coliseum. The team again played at McCamish Pavilion during October 2017 for preseason games, when Philips Arena improvements forced the Hawks to play there a third time.

During the 1996 Summer Olympics, the arena hosted the Olympic boxing tournament.

For most of its life, the Coliseum has hosted many rounds of the Georgia High School Association men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s state tournament games. The first integrated high school state tournament in Georgia history was played there before record overflow crowds in 1967.

The arena received its nickname, &quot;The Thrillerdome,&quot; from former Tech color radio announcer and former ESPN broadcaster Brad Nessler, for the many close games it witnessed during the 1983–84 season.

In 2003, the playing surface was renamed &quot;Cremins Court&quot; in honor of Bobby Cremins, Georgia Tech&#x27;s head coach from 1979 to 2000.

On February 21, 2008, the men&#x27;s basketball game between Georgia Tech and the University of Virginia was cancelled due to a leak in the roof that was caused by hard rainfall that had accumulated over the day. The decision to cancel the game was based on the fact that officials and staff at the game could not find where the water was coming through and they had no way to stop it. The game was delayed for about a half-hour, and then ultimately postponed until March 3, 2008.

On March 14, 2008, a tornado ripped through downtown Atlanta, causing damage to the CNN Center, Philips Arena, and Georgia Dome. During the weekend, the SEC men&#x27;s basketball tournament was set to play at the Georgia Dome on Thursday through Sunday. The tornado struck while the third of four quarterfinal games was in overtime. While that game was completed, SEC officials decided not to risk playing the fourth. Later that night, the conference decided to move the tournament, including the championship game, to the smaller Coliseum (damage to the Dome&#x27;s roof was confirmed shortly thereafter). Due to the reduced capacity, only players&#x27; families, school officials, credentialed media and 400 fans from each school were allowed to attend the remaining games.

===Hank McCamish Pavilion===

On October 19, 2010, Georgia Tech announced that Alexander Memorial Coliseum would undergo a $45 million renovation and would be renamed McCamish Pavilion after Hank McCamish in honor of a $15 million donation from the McCamish family. The facility&#x27;s extensive renovation included reconstruction of the seating bowl, the addition of an upper level balcony and club seating, and the expansion of the concourse and plaza area. During the renovation, Georgia Tech&#x27;s basketball teams played their 2011–2012 games at Philips Arena or Gas South Arena.
The first game in the renovated arena was on November 9, 2012, when the Yellow Jacket men&#x27;s basketball team defeated Tulane in front of a sold-out crowd of 8,600 people. The playing surface retained the title &quot;Cremins Court&quot; from its predecessor.

On August 22, 2016, the Atlanta Dream of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) announced that they would play the entirety of their 2017 and 2018 home schedules as well as any 2016 home playoff games at McCamish Pavilion due to renovations at Philips Arena conflicting with the WNBA schedule. Georgia State University held its Spring 2017 commencement ceremonies at McCamish Pavilion, due to the Georgia Dome&#x27;s closure and scheduled demolition as well as other venues within Metro Atlanta being either unavailable, undersized, or too distant.

On January 14, 2019, McCamish Pavilion served as the venue for the swearing in of Georgia&#x27;s 83rd Governor, Brian Kemp, as well as other recently elected state officials.

In recent years, McCamish has been the home of many upset wins for the Tech men&#x27;s basketball team. Since the 2012 renovation, 14 ranked teams have lost at McCamish, five of those being in the top ten.

On June 27, 2024, the arena acted as the &quot;spin room&quot; for the first Presidential Debate in 2024.

On October 28, 2024, it served as the venue for a Republican political rally led by former president Donald Trump in the final days of the 2024 United States presidential election.

<text>Chinese imperial roof decorations or roof charms or roof-figures () or &quot;walking beasts&quot; () or &quot;crouching beasts&quot; () were statuettes placed along the ridge line of official buildings of the Chinese empire. Only official buildings (palaces, government buildings, and some temples) were permitted to use such roof decorations.

==Overview==
Chinese roofs are typically of the hip roof type, with small gables, so decorations along the ridge line were highly visible to observers. Variant versions are still widespread in Chinese temples and has spread to the rest of East Asia and parts of Southeast Asia.

Along the ridges (unions between the roof panels), near the corner, a row of small figures is placed. These are often made of glazed ceramic and form an outward marching procession. Here we see the imperial yellow glaze reserved for the emperor. At the tail of the procession will be an imperial dragon, representing the authority of the state. At the head of the procession will be a man riding a Phoenix, one legend suggests that this represents a minion of the emperor who grew greedy for power and was hanged from the roof gable for treason. Another version of this figurine is an immortal riding a fenghuang-bird or qilin. Yet another interpretation is that this is a person serving the emperor, being watched by the following beasts. In between will be mythical beasts, usually an odd number of them. The mythical beasts are set to pounce upon the man and devour him should he stray from performing his duties with faithfulness and rectitude.

In the illustration at the top there is only one beast; the number of beasts indicating the importance of the duties performed within the building or within the courtyard protected by a gate. The maximum number of beasts is nine, including evil-dispelling bull, courageous goat-bull (), wind- and storm-summoning fish (), mythical lion (), auspicious seahorse, heavenly horse, lion, and chiwen (, a son of dragon). The maximum number is seen in the lower image, taken at the Hall of Supreme Harmony. Note the addition of an immortal guardian (, &quot;hangshi&quot;, &quot;ranked tenth&quot;) in front of the dragon holding to a sword like a cane. During imperial times, this figure was unique to this single building, being the throne hall and therefore the building with the highest status in the entire empire.

These examples are found within the Forbidden City, Beijing, China. Other examples can be found on functional structures such as gates and barracks of the Great Wall of China, as well as the roofs of the Summer Palace outside of Beijing.

With the fall of the empire (in 1911 C.E.) such decorations are now seen on commercial structures and tourist boats.

<doc id="759810" wikidata="Q3040557" url="?curid=759810" title="Dubnobasswithmyheadman">
<text>Dubnobasswithmyheadman (stylised as dubnobasswithmyheadman) is the third studio album by British electronic music group Underworld, released in the United Kingdom on Junior Boy&#x27;s Own on 24 January 1994. It was the first Underworld album after the 1980s version of the band had made the transition from synth-pop to electronic dance music and is also the first album to feature Darren Emerson as a band member.

==Background==
The original line-up of Underworld had split up after a 1989 tour of North America as the support act to Eurythmics. After the tour Karl Hyde had stayed in the United States for two months to work at Prince&#x27;s Paisley Park Studios in Minneapolis as a session musician, and then toured with Debbie Harry and Chris Stein of Blondie. When Hyde returned to the UK he found his former bandmate Rick Smith had been collaborating on dance tracks with a teenage DJ named Darren Emerson, a friend of Hyde&#x27;s brother-in-law, at Hyde and Smith&#x27;s studio in Romford: Emerson had been eager to learn how to use the equipment in a recording studio, and in turn Smith had been keen to have somebody who could introduce him to electronic music and club culture, which he had grown increasingly interested in. The three men started to swap ideas and create songs, resulting in a series of singles released throughout 1992 and 1993 under the names Underworld and Lemon Interupt.

==Composition==
Underworld&#x27;s approach to songwriting was very fluid, and based on the idea that everything was valid. Hyde told &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;re grabbing elements from all different times and areas of music and taking them somewhere else. We don&#x27;t want to simply regurgitate the past, and even though we&#x27;re using vocals and guitars, we&#x27;re trying to do it in new ways. We&#x27;re trying to find ways which makes those elements relevant to today. By not following a blueprint, we&#x27;re able to base a song on acoustic guitar, or we can do a pure techno track, based on an oscillator. In the past, Rick and I have often been excited by a poem or a film or something and thought, &#x27;That&#x27;s inspired us to do a great reggae tune but we can&#x27;t because we&#x27;re not in a reggae band&#x27;. Now we would think, &#x27;Fuck yes, let&#x27;s do it&#x27;.&quot; Smith added, &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of cutting and pasting, especially with the vocals. Something which is recorded for one track one day may well end up on three different tracks a few months down the line. Nothing is fixed. They&#x27;re just points for us to jump off of.&quot;

Many of Hyde&#x27;s lyrics were written during his sojourn in the US: &quot;Dark and Long&quot; was intended to evoke the open prairies of Minnesota that he had visited while working in Minneapolis, and &quot;Mmm Skyscraper... I Love You&quot; was inspired by walking around Greenwich Village in New York City. Hyde stated that the biggest influences at the time on his writing style had been Lou Reed&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;New York&quot;, and playwright Sam Shepard&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Motel Chronicles&quot;.

==Artwork==
Tomato, the art design collective that includes Underworld&#x27;s Rick Smith and Karl Hyde, designed the artwork for &quot;Dubnobasswithmyheadman&quot;. It features black and white type that has been &quot;multiplied, smeared, and overlaid&quot; so much that it is nearly unreadable, alongside a &quot;bold symbol consisting of a fractured handprint inside a broken circle&quot;. The artwork was originally intended for Tomato&#x27;s book &quot;Mmm... Skyscraper I Love You: A Typographic Journal of New York&quot;, published in 1994.

According to the authors of &quot;The Greatest Album Covers of All Time&quot;, the cover &quot;set a new standard of presentation for subsequent Dance albums&quot;. In &quot;Graphic Design: A New History&quot;, Stephen Eskilson cites the cover as a notable example of the &quot;expressive, chaotic graphics&quot; that developed in the 1990s, a design style he calls &quot;grunge&quot;. In an article published in the journal &quot;Substance&quot; Paul Zelevansky says that &quot;the packaging... replays the visual poetry of the 1960s and &#x27;70s and fast forwards to the alchemical transformations of computer graphics packages&quot;.

The album artwork also features excerpts of lyrics to the band&#x27;s 1996 hit &quot;Born Slippy .NUXX&quot;, a track which was released two years after the album.

Karl Hyde told &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine in 2014 that the album&#x27;s title had come from him misreading Rick Smith&#x27;s writing on a cassette tape box.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Dubnobasswithmyheadman&quot; received widespread acclaim from music critics. Writing in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, a year before he left to co-found the specialist dance music magazine &quot;Muzik&quot;, Ben Turner proclaimed that &quot;&quot;Dubnobasswithmyheadman&quot; is the most important album since &quot;The Stone Roses&quot; and the best since &quot;Screamadelica&quot; ... While others are content to go techno techno techno techno [a reference to the lyrics of &quot;No Limit&quot; by 2 Unlimited, a UK No. 1 hit the previous year], Underworld have taken a step back, utilising Karl Hyde and Rick Smith&#x27;s experience in rock music and throwing it full in the face of 22-year-old DJ, Darren Emerson. The result is utterly contemporary, the sound of the moment, beautifully capturing melodic techno, deranged lyricism, historic bass and lead guitars and astounding walls of rhythm ... This breathtaking hybrid marks the moment that club culture finally comes of age and beckons to everyone.&quot; Dele Fadele of &quot;NME&quot; said, &quot;Before Underworld&#x27;s startling remixes for Björk and Orbital last year, no-one would&#x27;ve put money on ex-members of ... popsters Freur making the first visionary record of &#x27;94 ... The sheer weight of ideas on offer and the constant variance of sounds and textures add up to a coherent, cogent whole, not a series of jack-tracks sequenced together, nor a series of hits with filler thrown in ... By writing &#x27;songs&#x27;—albeit playful, deranged ones—Underworld have come up with a solution for the facelessness that blights some dance music.&quot; &quot;Vox&quot; writer Phil Strongman wrote that &quot;apart from the lumbering blasphemy of &#x27;Dirt Epic&#x27; [&quot;sic&quot;], the only non-event here, it&#x27;s all go-with-the-flow stuff laced with intricacies ... Attractive, undulating and with moments of innovation, this Underworld offering transcends many of the limitations of its genre.&quot; At the end of 1994, &quot;Dubnobasswithmyheadman&quot; was ranked at number 16 on &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s list of the year&#x27;s best albums.

In 1999, &quot;Q&quot; included &quot;Dubnobasswithmyheadman&quot; in its list of the 90 best albums of the 1990s. The following year, &quot;Alternative Press&quot; named it as one of &quot;10 Essential Dance Albums That Rock&quot;. In a retrospective review, John Bush from AllMusic wrote that the album&#x27;s &quot;innovative blend of classic acid house, techno, and dub&quot; showed that &quot;in a decade awash with stale fusion&quot;, Underworld were &quot;truly a multi-genre group&quot;. Adie Nunn from &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; viewed &quot;Dubnobasswithmyheadman&quot; as a groundbreaking dance music album, noting that few other acts in the dance scene managed to produce an album with crossover appeal to &quot;indie kids and pop kids... as well as the electronic elite&quot; whilst retaining &quot;credibility&quot;. Sal Cinquemani from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; deemed the album Underworld&#x27;s &quot;greatest overall contribution to electronic music&quot;.

===2014 reissue===

In 2014, the album was reissued on vinyl, Blu-Ray, and 2-CD and 5-CD expanded editions. Reviewing the reissue, &quot;Q&quot; described the album as &quot;superb&quot; and proposed that Hyde and Smith&#x27;s previous 14 years of making music &quot;was why the uncannily undated &quot;Dubnobasswithmyheadman&quot; still exudes such multidimensional sophistication&quot;. &quot;Uncut&quot; praised the material on the extra four discs, but felt that the original album was still Underworld&#x27;s key record, claiming that Hyde&#x27;s lyrical vision was able to make Romford sound as exotic as the USA he had seen on his travels, and that this was the reason why &quot;twenty years later, the results of that crazy belief still sound like dance music&#x27;s dirtiest epic&quot;.

==Track listing==
All tracks are produced by Underworld (Darren Emerson, Rick Smith and Karl Hyde). Writing credits are often missing or inconsistent; for example, the original Lemon Interupt single credits Smith, Hyde and Emerson as writers of &quot;Dirty&quot;, while later editions only credit Smith and Hyde.

=== CD track listing ===


===20th anniversary 5-CD super deluxe edition===

The original version of &quot;Dirty&quot; is almost a minute longer, at 11:14. The remastered version cuts a coda that contained a sample from &quot;Dolls&#x27; Polyphony&quot; from the soundtrack to the anime film &quot;Akira&quot;.

=== Vinyl track listing ===
===Early prototype===
On 3 October 2008, a DAT from 1993 surfaced on Underworld&#x27;s official messageboard, which featured a different running order, some extended mixes and three previously unreleased songs: &quot;Big Meat Show&quot;, &quot;Organ&quot; and &quot;Can You Feel Me&quot;, an outtake from previous sessions. The poster of the DAT called it &quot;just a sampling of the type of songs the band was creating, showing any potential label that was interested ...&quot;

<text>The Owens River Gorge is a steep 10 mi (16 km) canyon on the upper [[Owens River]] in eastern California in the United States. The canyon is located at the eastern edge of the Sierra Nevada mountains in southern Mono County, along the stretch of the river where it exits the Long Valley near its source and enters the north end of Owens Valley. The gorge is a popular destination for rock climbing.

==Geology==

The Owens River Gorge was formed when the Owens River cut through the Bishop Tuff: a layer of welded ash formed from the eruption of the Long Valley Caldera. This erosion exposed the tuff layers, including rare columnar rhyolite formations.

==Water restoration==
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power constructed the Long Valley Dam at the head of the Owens River Gorge as part of a hydropower project in 1941, and completely dewatered the 16-km Lower Gorge reach from 1953 to 1991. Beginning in 1991, a limited range of flows
has been released to rewater the reach, recreate riparian habitat, and reestablish a brown trout sport fishery while maintaining hydropower
diversions.

<doc id="759821" wikidata="Q848669" url="?curid=759821" title="Second Toughest in the Infants">
<text>Second Toughest in the Infants is the fourth studio album by British electronic music group Underworld, and the second in their &quot;MK2&quot; line-up with Darren Emerson. With this album, Underworld expanded on their progressive palette, while developing their signature sound of abrasive beats and anthemic melodies. The name of the album derives from a comment made by member Rick Smith&#x27;s six-year-old nephew, Simon Prosser, when asked on his progress at infant school (the level of schooling attended by four- to seven-year-old children in the United Kingdom). &quot;Second Toughest&quot; featured the single &quot;Pearl&#x27;s Girl&quot;. The re-issue featured the band&#x27;s best known single, &quot;Born Slippy .NUXX&quot;.

The album was remastered and re-released on 20 November 2015 with deluxe and super-deluxe expanded editions.

==Overview==
The album opens with the multi-song suite &quot;Juanita : Kiteless : To Dream of Love&quot;, which features all three parts intersecting each other at various points during the piece; hence, the use of colons instead of slashes in its name. The loungy, drum and bass track &quot;Banstyle&quot; follows, alongside its downtempo, half-speed counterpart &quot;Sappy&#x27;s Curry&quot;. The rest of the record showcases advancements in the Underworld sound: both &quot;Rowla&quot; and &quot;Pearl&#x27;s Girl&quot; feature club-ready abrasive beats and basslines, while &quot;Blueski&quot; and &quot;Stagger&quot; incorporate live acoustic guitar and light, melancholic arrangements, respectively. &quot;Pearl&#x27;s Girl&quot; is one of the few Underworld songs to use breakbeats.

Due to the success of the single &quot;Born Slippy .NUXX&quot;, &quot;Second Toughest&quot; was re-issued with a bonus disc containing the single-only tracks &quot;Born Slippy .NUXX&quot; and &quot;Rez&quot;; Japanese editions also featured &quot;Cherry Pie&quot; and the &quot;(Carp Dreams... Koi)&quot; mix of &quot;Pearl&#x27;s Girl&quot;.

The song titles &quot;Sappy&#x27;s Curry&quot;, &quot;Pearl&#x27;s Girl&quot; and &quot;Born Slippy&quot; all come from the names of greyhounds from an English racing stadium. These greyhounds finished third, second, and first during Underworld&#x27;s visit to the races.

==Critical reception==

Like their previous effort &quot;Dubnobasswithmyheadman&quot;, &quot;Second Toughest in the Infants&quot; received critical acclaim. Anya Sacharow of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described the album as &quot;no dumb-bass dance music&quot;, adding that Underworld &quot;know how to expand the frenzy of techno and jungle and then retreat to an ambient cool&quot;. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; called Underworld &quot;modest/cynical/smart enough to borrow jungle&#x27;s finest trademarks&quot;, while &quot;NME&quot; praised them as &quot;smooth of touch, sleek of footing and downright slippery of rhythm&quot; and concluded that they &quot;breezily persevere in their quest for Western groove domination.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that &quot;Second Toughest in the Infants&quot; &quot;carries the same knockout punch of their debut, &quot;Dubnobasswithmyheadman&quot;, but it&#x27;s subtler and more varied, offering proof that the outfit is one of the leading dance collectives of the mid-&#x27;90s.&quot;

&quot;Melody Maker&quot; named &quot;Second Toughest in the Infants&quot; the fifth best album of 1996, and the album was also ranked at number 37 in &quot;NME&quot;&#x27;s 1996 critics&#x27; poll. In 2006, the album was ranked at number 96 on &quot;Mojo&quot;″s list of &quot;Modern Classics&quot;, with an accompanying write-up stating: &quot;Everything with Underworld is in the detail – never has the introduction of a hi-hat seemed quite so exciting.&quot; The album is featured in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

In a retrospective review, AllMusic critic Paul Simpson said that &quot;&quot;Second Toughest in the Infants&quot; endures as a landmark album, spotlighting Underworld at their creative peak, and remaining an important document of an era when experimental, cerebral electronic dance music received significant mainstream attention.&quot;

===2015 reissue===

In 2015, the album was reissued on vinyl and 2-CD and 4-CD expanded editions. Highlighting alternate mixes, remixes and unreleased songs, the 4-CD version includes a full CD of variations of &quot;Born Slippy .NUXX&quot;, from one of the song&#x27;s earliest versions in 1994, up until its final form a year later (which is included here in its 1996 extended form).

<text>Alumni Stadium is a college football stadium located on the lower campus of Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. It is approximately west of downtown Boston, located just inside the Boston city limits near the border with Newton. It is the home of the Boston College Eagles football program and also hosts lacrosse games on occasion. Its present seating capacity is 44,500.

==History==

Alumni Field, Boston College&#x27;s first stadium, opened in 1915 and was located just south of Gasson Quadrangle, on the site of the present Stokes Hall, an academic building for the humanities that opened in 2013. Before the building of Stokes, the area was known as The Dustbowl, a nickname that originated as a description of Alumni Field in the years when it was intensely used as a practice field, a baseball diamond, and a running track. Formally dedicated &quot;as a memorial to the boys that were&quot; on October 30, 1915, Alumni Field and its distinctive &quot;maroon goal-posts on a field of green&quot; were hailed in that evening&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Boston Saturday Evening Transcript&quot; as &quot;one of the sights in Boston.&quot; The original grandstands, which could accommodate 2,200 spectators in 1915, were enlarged over the subsequent years to 25,000. Nonetheless Alumni Field often proved too small for BC football games, which were frequently held at Fenway Park, and later Braves Field, beginning in the 1930s.

On September 21, 1957, Alumni Stadium opened on Boston College&#x27;s lower campus. The new stadium incorporated a football field encircled by a regulation track with a seating capacity of 26,000. The dedication game, a match-up with the Midshipmen of the U.S. Naval Academy, was orchestrated with the help of Boston College benefactor and then U.S. Senator John F. Kennedy. Kennedy, who received his honorary degree at Commencement Exercises in Alumni Field the previous year, returned to Alumni Stadium on a number of occasions over the course of his political career, including to give the 1963 Convocation Address, one of his last public appearances prior to his assassination on November 22, 1963.

Alumni Stadium has hosted numerous intellectual and cultural luminaries, religious leaders and heads of state as the venue for Boston College&#x27;s annual Commencement Exercises since 1957. In addition to being the permanent home of the Boston College football team, Alumni Stadium hosted the Boston Patriots of the American Football League during the 1969 season.

As the home of the Boston College Eagles, Alumni Stadium has been the site of numerous notable moments in Boston College football history. On September 17, 2005, Alumni Stadium hosted BC&#x27;s inaugural game as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference.

Alumni Stadium in its present form has hosted 40 sellout crowds of 44,500 or greater, most recently on November 9, 2024 against Syracuse.

===Renovations===
In 1971, the stadium was expanded to 32,000 seats and artificial turf and lights were installed. The stadium was rebuilt again in 1988, adding near-identical upper decks on each sideline as well as a new press box, built into the new Conte Forum. 

The stadium underwent a major renovation, bringing it into its current form, before the 1994 season. The track was eliminated, and the entire lower bowl was removed, leaving only the two sideline upper decks intact, which are structurally a part of Conte Forum and the Beacon Street parking garage. A new rectangular lower bowl was installed, fully enclosing the stadium for the first time and bringing seats closer to the sidelines. Matching upper decks were installed above each end zone, and new scoreboards were installed.

Since 1998, a -high bubble of inflatable vinyl has covered the stadium from December to March and allowed the field to be used as a winter practice facility. The field surface itself was converted to FieldTurf before the 2004 season. In the summer before the 2005 football season, the $27 million Yawkey Athletics Center opened at Alumni Stadium&#x27;s north end zone, and the logo of the Atlantic Coast Conference was added to the FieldTurf. For the 2012 season, Alumni Stadium was outfitted with new FieldTurf. New scoreboards, ribbon boards, and lights were installed before the 2024 season.

<text>William James Lendrim VC (1 January 1830 – 28 November 1891) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was 25 years old, and a corporal in the Royal Sappers and Miners, British Army during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 14 February 1855 during the Siege of Sevastopol, Crimea, Corporal Lendrim superintended 150 French Chasseurs in building No. 9 Battery left attack and replacing the whole of the capsized gabions under a heavy fire. On 11 April he got on top of a magazine under fire, and extinguished burning sandbags, making good the breach. On 20 April he was one of four volunteers who destroyed the screen which the Russians had erected to conceal their advance rifle-pits.

==Further information==
He later achieved the rank of Sergeant-Major, and worked at the Staff College, Frimley. He married Louisa and had 12 children – all alive in 1881. William died Camberley, Surrey, 28 November 1891 and is buried at the Royal Military Academy Cemetery, plot 182.

He was initiated in Lodge of the Thirty-seventh Company of Royal Engineers, No. 963 on 8 July 1863 and passed on 12 August the same year. As the Lodge warrant was withdrawn on 22 February 1864, he was raised in United Chatham Lodge of Benevolence, No. 184, Chatham on 12 April 1864, resigning in November the same year. He was the first Junior Warden of the Albert Edward Lodge No. 1714 chartered by the United Grand Lodge of England in the province of Surrey in 1877, and its third Worshipful Master in 1879. He was appointed to Provincial Grand Steward in the province of Surrey in 1878, and Provincial Grand Pursuivant of Surrey in 1881

<text>In game theory, the best response is the strategy (or strategies) which produces the most favorable outcome for a player, taking other players&#x27; strategies as given. The concept of a best response is central to John Nash&#x27;s best-known contribution, the Nash equilibrium, the point at which each player in a game has selected the best response (or one of the best responses) to the other players&#x27; strategies.

== Correspondence ==
Reaction correspondences, also known as best response correspondences, are used in the proof of the existence of mixed strategy Nash equilibria. Reaction correspondences are not &quot;reaction functions&quot; since functions must only have one value per argument, and many reaction correspondences will be undefined, i.e., a vertical line, for some opponent strategy choice. One constructs a correspondence , for each player from the set of opponent strategy profiles into the set of the player&#x27;s strategies. So, for any given set of opponent&#x27;s strategies , represents player ″s best responses to .
Response correspondences for all normal form games can be drawn with a line for each player in a unit square strategy space. Figures 1 to 3 graphs the best response correspondences for the stag hunt game. The dotted line in Figure 1 shows the optimal probability that player Y plays &#x27;Stag&#x27; (in the -axis), as a function of the probability that player X plays Stag (shown in the -axis). In Figure 2 the dotted line shows the optimal probability that player X plays &#x27;Stag&#x27; (shown in the -axis), as a function of the probability that player Y plays Stag (shown in the -axis). Note that Figure 2 plots the independent and response variables in the opposite axes to those normally used, so that it may be superimposed onto the previous graph, to show the Nash equilibria at the points where the two player&#x27;s best responses agree in Figure 3.

There are three distinctive reaction correspondence shapes, one for each of the three types of symmetric games: coordination games, discoordination games, and games with dominated strategies
(the trivial fourth case in which payoffs are always equal for both moves is not really a game theoretical problem). Any payoff symmetric game will take one of these three forms.

===Coordination games===
Games in which players score highest when both players choose the same strategy, such as the stag hunt and battle of the sexes, are called coordination games. These games have reaction correspondences of the same shape as Figure 3, where there is one Nash equilibrium in the bottom left corner, another in the top right, and a mixing Nash somewhere along the diagonal between the other two.

===Anti-coordination games===

Games such as the game of chicken and hawk-dove game in which players score highest when they choose opposite strategies, i.e., discoordinate, are called anti-coordination games. They have reaction correspondences (Figure 4) that cross in the opposite direction to coordination games, with three Nash equilibria, one in each of the top left and bottom right corners, where one player chooses one strategy, the other player chooses the opposite strategy. The third Nash equilibrium is a mixed strategy which lies along the diagonal from the bottom left to top right corners. If the players do not know which one of them is which, then the mixed Nash is an , as play is confined to the bottom left to top right diagonal line. Otherwise an uncorrelated asymmetry is said to exist, and the corner Nash equilibria are .
===Games with dominated strategies===
Games with dominated strategies have reaction correspondences which only cross at one point, which will be in either the bottom left, or top right corner in payoff symmetric games. For instance, in the single-play prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, the &quot;Cooperate&quot; move is not optimal for any probability of opponent Cooperation. Figure 5 shows the reaction correspondence for such a game, where the dimensions are &quot;Probability play Cooperate&quot;, the Nash equilibrium is in the lower left corner where neither player plays Cooperate. If the dimensions were defined as &quot;Probability play Defect&quot;, then both players best response curves would be 1 for all opponent strategy probabilities and the reaction correspondences would cross (and form a Nash equilibrium) at the top right corner.

===Other (payoff asymmetric) games===
A wider range of reaction correspondences shapes is possible in games with payoff asymmetries. For each player there are five possible best response shapes, shown in Figure 6. From left to right these are: dominated strategy (always play 2), dominated strategy (always play 1), rising (play strategy 2 if probability that the other player plays 2 is above threshold), falling (play strategy 1 if probability that the other player plays 2 is above threshold), and indifferent (both strategies play equally well under all conditions).

While there are only four possible types of payoff symmetric games (of which one is trivial), the five different best response curves per player allow for a larger number of payoff asymmetric game types. Many of these are not truly different from each other. The dimensions may be redefined (exchange names of strategies 1 and 2) to produce symmetrical games which are logically identical.

=== Matching pennies ===
One well-known game with payoff asymmetries is the matching pennies game. In this game one player, the row player (graphed on the y dimension) wins if the players coordinate (both choose heads or both choose tails) while the other player, the column player (shown in the -axis) wins if the players discoordinate. Player Y&#x27;s reaction correspondence is that of a coordination game, while that of player X is a discoordination game. The only Nash equilibrium is the combination of mixed strategies where both players independently choose heads and tails with probability 0.5 each.

== Dynamics ==
In evolutionary game theory, best response dynamics represents a class of strategy updating rules, where players strategies in the next round are determined by their best responses to some subset of the population. Some examples include:
*In a large population model, players choose their next action probabilistically based on which strategies are best responses to the population as a whole.
*In a spatial model, players choose (in the next round) the action that is the best response to all of their neighbors.
Importantly, in these models players only choose the best response on the next round that would give them the highest payoff . Players do not consider the effect that choosing a strategy on the next round would have on future play in the game. This constraint results in the dynamical rule often being called myopic best response.

In the theory of potential games, best response dynamics refers to a way of finding a Nash equilibrium by computing the best response for every player:

==Smoothed==

Instead of best response correspondences, some models use smoothed best response functions. These functions are similar to the best response correspondence, except that the function does not &quot;jump&quot; from one pure strategy to another. The difference is illustrated in Figure 8, where black represents the best response correspondence and the other colors each represent different smoothed best response functions. In standard best response correspondences, even the slightest benefit to one action will result in the individual playing that action with probability 1. In smoothed best response as the difference between two actions decreases the individual&#x27;s play approaches 50:50.

There are many functions that represent smoothed best response functions. The functions illustrated here are several variations on the following function:

formula_1

where represents the expected payoff of action , and is a parameter that determines the degree to which the function deviates from the true best response (a larger implies that the player is more likely to make &#x27;mistakes&#x27;).

There are several advantages to using smoothed best response, both theoretical and empirical. First, it is consistent with psychological experiments; when individuals are roughly indifferent between two actions they appear to choose more or less at random. Second, the play of individuals is uniquely determined in all cases, since it is a correspondence that is also a function. Finally, using smoothed best response with some learning rules (as in Fictitious play) can result in players learning to play mixed strategy Nash equilibria.

<text>Beaucoup Fish is the fifth album by Underworld, released in 1999. Following the huge success of the single &quot;Born Slippy .NUXX&quot; from its use in the film &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, &quot;Beaucoup Fish&quot; was Underworld&#x27;s most anticipated release. It spawned several successful singles, including &quot;Push Upstairs&quot;, &quot;Jumbo&quot; and &quot;Moaner&quot;, which was previously used in the film &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;.

It is the last studio album to feature Darren Emerson, who departed in 2001, and the third album by the techno/house orientated version of Underworld which became active in about 1991/1992 (tracks were being released around this time under the names Lemon Interupt and Underworld).

The album was remastered and re-released in 2017 with deluxe and super-deluxe expanded editions.

==Overview==
&quot;Beaucoup Fish&quot; was released after the successful single &quot;Born Slippy .NUXX&quot;; a single that began to define Underworld&#x27;s signature sound of stream of consciousness lyrics, anthemic melodies and driving beats and rhythms. Lead single &quot;Push Upstairs&quot;, with its energetic piano melody, exemplified this new sound.

The album&#x27;s working title was &quot;Tonight Matthew, I&#x27;m Going to be Underworld&quot;, inspired by the famous catchphrase &quot;Tonight [host name], I&#x27;m going to be...&quot;, used on the British celebrity impersonation TV programme &quot;Stars in Their Eyes&quot;. The title was changed to &quot;Beaucoup Fish&quot; (&quot;beaucoup&quot; being French for &quot;much&quot;), on the basis that the tongue-in-cheek title would be incomprehensible to listeners outside of the United Kingdom. The current title comes from a sampled voice used in &quot;Jumbo&quot;, of an American from the Southern United States using the regional pronunciation, &quot;bookoo fish.&quot;

&quot;King of Snake&quot; features a tape-edited guitar intro titled &quot;Shudder&quot;, leading into a lively house track, before fading into sampled dialogue about the blood sport of snake baiting. &quot;Skym&quot; is a minimal ballad, inspired by This Mortal Coil and featuring little more than a solo keyboard and light piano chords over Karl Hyde&#x27;s vocals, while &quot;Bruce Lee&quot; has more akin to rock music than trance. &quot;Beaucoup Fish&quot; also features a downtempo re-imagining of &quot;Push Upstairs&quot;, playfully titled &quot;Push Downstairs&quot;; only the vocal track is kept between the two. &quot;Moaner&quot;, a song featured in the 1997 film &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, is presented on &quot;Beaucoup Fish&quot; in its slightly edited soundtrack album version, previously available on an Underworld CD single.

&quot;Push Upstairs&quot; and second single &quot;Jumbo&quot; were both hits on the dance charts and in clubs. &quot;Beaucoup Fish&quot; was well-received critically (one review calling it &quot;electronica&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;&quot;) and remains Underworld&#x27;s most successful album, with over two million copies sold.

==Artwork==
The art for &quot;Beaucoup Fish&quot; was once again designed by Tomato, the art firm that Underworld is a part of. Each page of the liner notes featured a stylised shape in a large blue field. The shapes used are a circle for CD; a square for vinyl; and an elongated rectangle for MiniDisc and cassette formats.

Due to delays, the packaging incorrectly lists 1998 as the release year.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Beaucoup Fish&quot; was well received by music critics and it continues to be Underworld&#x27;s best selling album to date. It has a score of 79/100 on Metacritic based on 20 reviews, which indicates &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

John Bush from AllMusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars saying &quot;the trio is still the best at welding obtuse songcraft onto an uncompromising techno framework and making both sound great&quot;.

David Browne from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album an A rating stating that &quot;Beaucoup Fish&quot; &quot;gently tweaks the naysayers by demonstrating how many more places this music can wander, how it can grow and reinvent itself. Albums like this (and Fatboy Slim&#x27;s kaleidoscopic &quot;You&#x27;ve Come a Long Way, Baby&quot;) are comparable to Lauryn Hill&#x27;s recent work in the way they make an overly familiar style of music seem vital again. In its own lush, detached manner, &quot;Beaucoup Fish&quot; is the rebirth of the cool.&quot;

John Wojtowicz from &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave it a very favourable review saying it is &quot;A shiny little appliance that fragments its 11 tracks into nearly as many subgenres, doing away with the seamless sprawl of their earlier records&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave it 3.5 stars out of 5 saying that &quot;Their specialty is an undulating trance throb that shimmers with shades of rock, contemporary symphonics, dub, disco, house, spoken word, whatever. The result still sounds like Underworld, and the fiftieth play sounds better than the fifth&quot;.

&quot;NME&quot; gave the album 8/10 saying that &quot;Beaucoup Fish is a pure, seamless flow, pinned together with trance-techno beats that hark back to classic Detroit house and early Underworld singles like &#x27;Cowgirl&#x27; and &#x27;Spikee&#x27;&quot; and also adding that &quot;There are rare moments when even the longest albums feel like they should go on forever: this, emphatically, is one of them&quot;.
* &quot;Spin&quot; (4/99, pp. 157–158) - 7 (out of 10) - &quot;...the British trio hit on a formula that mixes and gibberish in just the right proportions...&quot;
* &quot;Q&quot; (4/99, p. 107) - 3 Stars (out of 5) - &quot;...Beaucoup Fish finds them continuing down an individualistic path as they pull in strands from electronic influences such as Kraftwerk...Giorgio Moroder...and Yello...&quot;
* &quot;Magnet&quot; (4/99, pp. 81–82) - &quot;...Rather than adopt the happy faces of house, the saintly roar of modern minimalist/classical, the bugged-out rhythms of drum &#x27;n&#x27; bass or the sloped dope of dub, the first great album of &#x27;99 revels in all these styles...[Underworld] seems to be funkin&#x27; for nirvana...&quot;
* &quot;Muzik&quot; (1/00, p. 69) - &quot;A brutal, bruising take on the band&#x27;s unique techno template...the melodies were infectious as ever. Trance tunes, swirling basslines and stupendous piano chuggers...&quot;
* CMJ (4/12/99, p. 3) - &quot;...showcases a more mature, album-oriented Underworld, travelling from over-the-top club maelstroms to ominous, gothic ballads to choppy, experimental rap...&quot;
* &quot;Mojo&quot; (03/99, p. 84) - &quot;...BEAUCOUP FISH proves that the real deal with electronic music is not that it is fast and crazy...but allows for perfect recall of sounds and moments...music like Underworld&#x27;s can have a texture as rich, emotive and individual as memory itself.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
* &quot;Muzik&quot; (1/00, p. 69) - Ranked No. 10 in Muzik&#x27;s &quot;Albums of the Year &#x27;99&quot;
* CMJ (1/10/00, p. 5) - Ranked No. 14 in CMJ&#x27;s &quot;Top 30 Editorial Picks [for 1999].&quot;
* &quot;Mojo&quot; (1/00, p. 30) - Ranked No. 18 in Mojo Magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best of 1999&quot;

===2017 reissue===

In 2017 the album was reissued, with expanded 2-LP vinyl and 4-CD editions. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Philip Sherburne dismissed the two remix CDs as &quot;mainly of interest to collectors&quot; and the alternate takes as &quot;not much more essential&quot; in an otherwise positive review. Chris Todd of &quot;The Line of Best Fit&quot; similarly pans the extra discs, but calls the original album &quot;weirdly brilliant.&quot;

<text>JA (Junior Achievement) Worldwide is a global non-profit youth organization. It was founded in 1919 by Horace A. Moses, Theodore Vail, and Winthrop M. Crane. JA works with local businesses, schools, and organizations to deliver experiential learning programs in the areas of work readiness, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship to students.

== History ==
The &quot;Boys&#x27; and Girls&#x27; Bureau of the Eastern States &quot;was founded in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1919 as a spinoff of the Eastern States Exposition, to help educate young people moving from rural areas to the cities about the means of production and free enterprise. The following year, the organization&#x27;s name was changed to the Junior Achievement Bureau. The name was modified again in 1926 to Junior Achievement, Inc.

Following World War II, the organization grew from a regional into a national organization. In the 1960s, JA began its growth into an international organization.

Beginning in 1944, Junior Achievement organized an annual national conference, known as the National Junior Achievers Conference, NAJAC, to bring together student representatives of local programs to participate in contests. In 1949, the organization began allowing conference delegates to elect national leadership to play an active role contributing to program development, increasing public awareness and supporting fundraising.

In 1975, Junior Achievement introduced its first in-school program, Project Business, to help volunteers teach local middle school students about business and personal finance.

JA educates 12 million students in more than 100 countries around the world. Programs are delivered by 450,000 JA volunteers.

JA Worldwide has six regional offices: JA Africa, JA Americas, JA Asia Pacific, JA Europe, JA Middle East and Africa (INJAZ Al-Arab), together with its American headquarters, Junior Achievement USA.

== Notable alumni ==

Notable JA alumni include former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala, U.S. Congressman Bob Clement, Subway restaurant founder Fred DeLuca, American actor Arte Johnson, journalist Dan Rather, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, comedian Amy Sedaris, and British Labour Party Politician David Lammy.

Notable Canadian JA alumni include entrepreneur and television personality Manjit Minhas (Alberta), marketing executive Jennifer Wilnechenko (British Columbia), executive director of The DMZ at Ryerson University Abdullah Snobar (Ontario), and young philanthropist Ben Sabic (Manitoba).

== In fiction ==
The July 1962 issue of &quot;Analog Science Fact &amp; Fiction&quot; published a short story by William M. Lee called &quot;Junior Achievement&quot;, about a JA group consisting of genius children who invent and sell products beyond the comprehension of their adult leader.

== Leadership ==

From its founding in 1919 until 1962, JA was managed by volunteers from the business community. In 1962, the organization hired its first, full-time, paid president.

<doc id="759851" wikidata="Q4744320" url="?curid=759851" title="American League Park">
<text>American League Park, known by historians as American League Park I, was a baseball park that formerly stood in the Trinidad neighborhood of Washington, D.C., at the corner of Florida Avenue and Trinidad Avenue NE on land previously belonging to the Washington Brick Company. It hosted the Washington Senators from the 1901 season through the 1903 season. and Washington Potomacs ( 1923-24)

The ballpark&#x27;s left-field fence would become Neal Street NE; its third-base line ran along Trinidad Avenue; its first-base line ran along Florida Avenue NE; and its right-field fence ran along present-day Bladensburg Road. 

On March 20, 1901, the district commissioners granted permission to the American League to establish a baseball park at the location following an application including plans and specifications for the grand stand and the other supporting structures. Snowden Ashford was the building inspector who handled the case. The land had been previously occupied by the Washington Brick Company in an area sparsely built at the time; the closest buildings were located more than from the outlines of the grounds. Therefore, it was considered that it would not cause more menace to the area then if a lumber yard was established there. No specific regulations for the establishment of baseball grounds were in place in the District of Columbia at the time. No opposition from nearby landowners was received, therefore permission was granted.

The grandstands were made out of wood as most ballparks of the time. The left-field line ran roughly north–south, with the left field measuring .

Boundary Field, in Northwest DC, had been the preferred site for the American League Senators, but its usage had been blocked by the National League, which still had rights to the site despite no longer having a franchise in Washington. Once peace was reached between the leagues, the Senators moved to that site for the 1904 season, which became known as American League Park II or National Park. The stands from American League Park I were transported to the new location along with the team. By 1907, there was no longer a baseball field on the site.

<doc id="759855" wikidata="Q3273820" url="?curid=759855" title="A Hundred Days Off">
<text>A Hundred Days Off is the sixth album by Underworld. The album produced two UK Singles Chart entries: &quot;Two Months Off&quot;, which reached no. 12 and &quot;Dinosaur Adventure 3D&quot;, which reached no. 34. Although this was the first album since Darren Emerson&#x27;s departure from the group in 2001, the album is not a huge stylistic makeover as the main focus of the band is still trance, techno, and house, although without the thumping beats that defined their previous album &quot;Beaucoup Fish&quot;. Instead, the album explores more of an ambient and experimental music style.

==Critical reception==
&quot;A Hundred Days Off&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. It has a score of 71/100 on Metacritic based on 18 reviews indicating as &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; gave the album 8/10 describing it as &quot;Their best album since their &quot;Dubnobasswithmyheadman&quot; debut, Karl and Rick have pulled off a comeback in fine style and laid some demons to rest&quot; and also stating that &quot;Underworld prove that you&#x27;re only as old as the technology you use&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album 3 out of 5 stars saying that &quot;The beauty of A Hundred Days Off is that it pumps and churns so suggestively; it somehow evokes the blues of the otherwise successful modern man, who goes out every night and dances alone in his head&quot;. &quot;Uncut&quot; gave the album 4 out of 5 stars saying it is &quot;A very fine album--Underworld don&#x27;t make any other kind...a beautiful and baffling enigma.&quot;

==Promo version==
In the Spring of 2011, an alternate version of the album was distributed by a fan who was previously unaware that it was not widely heard. This version of the album was called &quot;Ansum&quot;, and was apparently an early un-mastered cut of the album burned onto a CD-R for internal use at V2. Most of the tracks are very similar, if not identical, to the final album version; however, the track order is changed; &quot;Little Speaker&quot; is omitted; &quot;Mo Move&quot; is doubled in length and shares its second half with a re-worked version of the b-side &quot;Ansum&quot;; &quot;Twist&quot; contains an extended drum outro; and &quot;Ballet Lane&quot; and &quot;Trim&quot; contain minor percussion differences.
