<text>Ptolemy Ceraunus ( ; c. 319 BC – January/February 279 BC) was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty and briefly king of Macedon. As the son of Ptolemy I Soter, he was originally heir to the throne of Ptolemaic Egypt, but he was displaced in favour of his younger brother Ptolemy II Philadelphus. He fled to King Lysimachus of Thrace and Macedon where he was involved in court intrigue that led to the fall of that kingdom in 281 BC to Seleucus I, whom he then assassinated. He then seized the throne of Macedon, which he ruled for seventeen months before his death in battle against the Gauls in early 279 BC. His epithet &quot;Ceraunus&quot; is Greek for &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; and referred to his impatient, impetuous, and destructive character.

==Early life and departure from Egypt==
Ptolemy was the eldest son of Ptolemy I Soter, King of Egypt, and his first wife Eurydice, daughter of Antipater, regent of Macedon. His father was a general of Alexander the Great, whom he succeeded, and founded the Ptolemaic dynasty. He was probably born in 319 BC, soon after his parents&#x27; marriage, being the first of their six children. Sometime between 317 and 314 BC, Ptolemy I married one of Eurydice&#x27;s ladies-in-waiting, Berenice and had further children, including another son, the future Ptolemy II. Initially Ptolemy Ceraunus was the heir presumptive, but as Berenice&#x27;s son grew older, a power struggle developed between the two half-brothers, which culminated in Ptolemy Ceraunus&#x27; departure from Egypt around 287 BC. Ptolemy II was formally elevated to the status of co-regent by Ptolemy I on 28 March 284 BC.

==Fall of Lysimachus and Seleucus==

Following his departure from Egypt, Ptolemy Ceraunus went to the court of Lysimachus, who ruled Macedon, Thrace and western Asia Minor and who may have been his father-in-law. Lysimachus’ court was divided on the question of supporting Ceraunus. On the one hand, Lysimachus himself had been married to Ptolemy II&#x27;s full sister, Arsinoe II, since 300 BC. On the other hand, Lysimachus&#x27; heir, Agathocles, was married to Ceraunus&#x27; full sister Lysandra. The two sisters were already engaged in conflict over the succession, which Ceraunus&#x27; arrival probably exacerbated. Lysimachus ultimately chose to support Ptolemy II and sealed that decision at some point between 284 and 281 BC by marrying his daughter Arsinoe I to Ptolemy II.

Continued conflict within Lysimachus&#x27; court led to the execution of Agathocles in 282 BC. The course of events and Ptolemy Ceraunus&#x27; role in them is unclear. According to one historian, Memnon, it was Ptolemy Ceraunus who carried out the murder of Agathocles. All other sources that mention Ceraunus place him on Agathocles&#x27; side in this dispute and report that he accompanied Agathocles&#x27; widow, his full-sister Lysandra, in her flight to the court of Seleucus I. The murder provoked a massive outcry from Lysimachus&#x27; subjects. Seeing an opportunity to intervene for his own gain, Seleucus invaded Lysimachus&#x27; kingdom early in 281 BC. This campaign culminated in the Battle of Corupedium, at which Lysimachus was killed and Seleucus annexed his kingdom to his empire. After the Battle of Corupedium, Ptolemy Ceraunus came into Seleucus&#x27; control. Seleucus took Ceraunus into his inner circle and perhaps planned to use him as a bargaining chip in the event of conflict with Ptolemaic Egypt.

In September 281 BC, Seleucus crossed the Hellespont and prepared to invade Macedon. But as Seleucus was sacrificing at a place called Argos, Ptolemy Ceraunus murdered him, intending to seize control of the territories of his former protector. Ceraunus was thus responsible for the death of the last surviving successor of Alexander the Great.

==King of Macedon==

After assassinating Seleucus, Ceraunus rushed to Lysimachia where he had himself acclaimed king by the portion of Seleucus&#x27; army that was present there. At this time he also formally relinquished his claim to the Egyptian throne. A series of gold staters and silver tetradrachms minted at Lysimachia appear to belong to this period. They have the same design as earlier coinage of Lysimachus: the head of Alexander the Great with the horn of Ammon on the obverse and a depiction of Athena seated, holding up a Nike on the reverse. The legend of the coins reads ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΛΥΣΙΜΑΧΟΥ (of King Lysimachus) and the reverse includes two small symbols: a lion&#x27;s head, which was the symbol of Lysimachus, and a tiny elephant. Since the elephant was the symbol of Seleucus, these coins have sometimes been connected with the short period of Seleucus&#x27; rule over the region between the battle of Corupedium and his assassination. However, Hollstein has argued that these were coins of Ptolemy Ceraunus, intended to present him as the legitimate heir of Lysimachus and in possession of a formidable force of elephants. The issue was very small; Ceraunus never issued coins in his own name.

Antigonos Gonatas, whose father Demetrius I Poliorcetes had been king of Macedon from 294-288 BC, attempted to seize control of Macedon, but Ptolemy Ceraunus defeated him in a naval battle and confined him to the city of Demetrias, Thessaly. A series of tetradrachms minted at Amphipolis (the main Macedonian mint), which feature a small Triton blowing a trumpet, have sometimes been associated with this victory, but this has been questioned, since they appear to have been minted a year after Ceraunus&#x27; death.

Ptolemy Ceraunus also made an alliance with Pyrrhus of Epirus, who had controlled the western portion of Macedon from 288-284 BC, ending the threat of attack from him. The alliance freed Pyrrhus to invade Italy to fight against the Roman Republic in the Pyrrhic War. Justin reports that Ceraunus provided Pyrrhus with a large number of troops: 5,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry, and 50 elephants, and says that the alliance was sealed by the marriage of a daughter of Ceraunus to Pyrrhus. Some scholars have been sceptical of this report, suggesting that Justin has confused Ptolemy Ceraunus with Ptolemy II, since they doubt that Ceraunus could have spared such a large number of troops at this moment. The existence of the marriage is also disputed. If the daughter did exist, her subsequent fate is unknown.
Arsinoe II, the widow of Lysimachus, had fled with her young sons after Lysimachus&#x27; defeat at Corupedium to Ephesus (which had been renamed Arsinoeia in her honour). The Ephesians rioted against her, forcing her to leave the city and sail to Macedon, where she took control of the city of Cassandreia. Ptolemy Ceraunus entered into negotiations with Arsinoe II and proposed to marry her, even though she was his half-sister. She agreed on the condition that her young sons were kept safe. On their wedding day, however, Ptolemy Ceraunus murdered her two younger sons. Arsinoe fled to Samothrace and then to Egypt, where she would eventually marry Ptolemy II. Her eldest son, Ptolemy Epigonos fled north to the kingdom of the Dardanians.

Ptolemy Ceraunus was next attacked by a son of Lysimachus and an Illyrian king called Monunius. The son is not certainly identified by the surviving source, but Elizabeth D. Carney argues that it was Ptolemy Epigonos, the eldest son of Arsinoe by Lysimachus. Monunius may have been a king of the Dardanians who took him in after the murder of his younger brothers. This war seems to have occupied Ptolemy Ceraunus for most of 280 BC.

==Death==
In January or February 279 BC, perhaps taking advantage of the ongoing conflict between Ptolemy Ceraunus and Ptolemy Epigonos, a group of Gauls led by Bolgius invaded Macedon from the north. Diodorus Siculus reports that the impetuous Ptolemy refused to wait for his full force to arrive before attacking Bolgius&#x27; army, while Justin reports that he rudely rebuffed diplomatic overtures from Bolgius. He also rudely refused help from a force of 20.000 Dardanians, offered by a Dardanian king. When the forces joined battle, Ceraunus was wounded and captured by the Gauls, who killed him, mounted his head on a spear and carried it around the battlefield. When the Macedonians saw that their leader was dead, they fled. Ptolemy Ceraunus&#x27; death brought anarchy, as the Gauls streamed through the rest of Greece and into Asia Minor. Immediately after Ceraunus&#x27; death the throne of Macedon was taken by his younger brother Meleager, but he was deposed by his troops within months. A series of short-lived kings followed. This situation lasted about two years, until Antigonos Gonatas defeated the Gauls in a battle near Lysimachia, Thrace, in 277 BC. After this victory he was recognised as king of Macedon and his power extended eventually to the rest of Greece.

==Marriages and issue==
Ptolemy Ceraunus apparently had a daughter, who married Pyrrhus in late 281 or 280 BC. The existence of this marriage is disputed, but if it did take place, Ceraunus must have married her mother around 300-295 BC. Christopher Bennett proposes that she may have been a daughter of Lysimachus, with whom Ptolemy I contracted a number of marriage alliances in those years.

Ptolemy agreed to marry Lysimachus&#x27; widow Arsinoe II, his own half-sister, in late 281 or early 280 BC, as part of a plot to seize the city of Cassandreia and murder her children. It is unclear whether the marriage was actually consummated, but Arsinoe fled Macedon immediately after the wedding.

<doc id="766968" wikidata="Q464990" url="?curid=766968" title="Yvonne Ridley">
<text>Yvonne Ridley (born 23 April 1958) is a British journalist, author and politician who holds several committee positions with the Alba Party in Scotland. She was a former chair of the National Council of the now-defunct Respect Party. 

Ridley made global headlines when she was captured by the Taliban in 2001 after the events of 9/11 and before the start of the U.S.-led war. Two years later she converted to Islam. She is a vocal supporter of the Palestinian movement, which she took up as a schoolgirl in her native County Durham. She is an avid critic of Zionism and of Western media portrayals and foreign policy in the war on terror, and has undertaken speaking tours throughout the Muslim world as well as America, Europe and Australia. 

She has been called &quot;something close to a celebrity in the Islamic world&quot; by the journalist Rachel Cooke, and in 2008 Ridley said that she had been voted the &quot;most recognisable woman in the Islamic world&quot; by Islam Online. She has frequently made comments considered anti-Semitic.

==Biography==
Ridley was born in the working class mining town of Stanley, County Durham, the youngest of three girls, and had an upbringing in the Church of England. She began her career at the local &quot;Stanley News,&quot; which was part of the Durham Advertiser Series. From there she moved to Newcastle upon Tyne and worked for The Sunday Sun and the Newcastle Journal for Thomson Regional Newspapers as well as The Northern Echo which was part of the Westminster Press group. She attended the London College of Printing. As a journalist, she was employed by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot;, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and the &quot;News of the World&quot;. She was deputy editor and acting editor of &quot;Wales on Sunday&quot;, and was chief reporter when the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; sent her to Afghanistan after 9/11.

In one interview she mentions having &quot;a reputation as the &#x27;Patsy Stone of Fleet Street&#x27;&quot; that she was happy to have left behind with her conversion to Islam. Her passion for left-wing, anti-imperialist causes predates her conversion; she joined the Labour Party as a teenager before resigning over the decision to invade Iraq in March 2003.

===Capture by the Taliban===
Ridley was captured by the Taliban in Afghanistan on 28 September 2001, and held for 11 days, while working for the &quot;Sunday Express&quot;. In the days before the beginning of the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, after being refused an entrance visa, she decided to follow the example of BBC reporter John Simpson, who had crossed the border anonymously in a burqa.

She entered on 26 September and spent two days undercover in Afghanistan. It was on her return, travelling with her guides, that she was uncovered when the donkey she was on bolted, and her camera was seen by a Taliban soldier. She was accused of being a spy, which carried a death sentence, and at the very least faced jail for illegally entering Afghanistan.

The publisher of Express Newspapers, Richard Desmond, sent a team of negotiators to talk directly with Taliban officials at the Afghan embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan. It soon became clear the regime wanted neither money nor aid but proof that Ridley was a bonafide journalist. The British high commissioner to Pakistan, Hilary Synnott, met the Afghan ambassador in Islamabad, Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, and asked for her release. Following her release on 8 October, Ridley was escorted to the border, where she was handed over to the Pakistani authorities. It had been feared that this would be jeopardised by the bombing of Afghan targets as part of the War in Afghanistan that had commenced the previous day.

Ridley revealed that she had kept a concealed diary inside a box for a toothpaste tube and inside of a soap wrapper. She had been on hunger strike throughout her captivity and described her experience as terrifying but she was not physically hurt.

After her release, her guides Jan Ali and Nagibullah Muhmand, as well as his five-year-old daughter Basmena, were held in prison in Kabul. At least three of Muhmand&#x27;s relatives were also arrested for aiding Ridley after the Taliban developed the film in her camera. All were subsequently released without charge or harm.

===Conversion to Islam===
She said in her book, &quot;In the Hands of the Taliban&quot;, that, while she was in captivity, she was treated with respect by the men of the Taliban and was, subsequently, amazed by their courtesy. All men that she came in contact with lowered their gazes (to her), which left her bewildered. She had initially thought they had already decided to have her executed and therefore could not look her in the eyes. Only later did she discover they were showing her a sign of respect. While in captivity she gave an undertaking to read the Qur&#x27;an and study Islam if they let her go. Fulfilling the promise and setting out on what she described as &quot;an academic exercise&quot; she said she was shocked to discover &quot;the Quran makes it clear that women are equal in spirituality, worth, and education. What everyone forgets is that Islam is perfect; people are not.&quot;

She converted to Islam in the middle of 2003, claiming that her new faith helped put behind her broken marriages and embrace &quot;the biggest and the best family in the world.&quot;

===Subsequent career===
After her conversion, she delivered lectures on issues relating to Iraq, Israel, Afghanistan, Chechnya, Kashmir, Uzbekistan, women in Islam, the War on Terror, and journalism at universities across the US, Australia, South Africa and the Middle East. She has authored and contributed towards a number of books called &quot;In The Hands of the Taliban&quot; and &quot;Ticket to Paradise&quot;. A later book entitled &quot;Torture: Does It Work&quot; was published by Military Press Studies in 2016. In 2019 she authored the book &quot;The Rise of the Prophet Muhammad: Don&#x27;t Shoot the Messenger&quot; published by academic house Cambridge Scholars Publishing.

Ridley was a patron of the UK-based pressure groups Cageprisoners until December 2014, the European President of the International Muslim Women&#x27;s Union, and the Secretary General of the European Muslim League based in Milan and Geneva. She is a member of the Stop the War Coalition, for which she has spoken at its rallies, and was a member of the Respect Party, for which she stood in parliamentary elections before resigning both leadership and from the party in early 2014.

==== Writing, speaking and advocacy ====
In December 2001, Ridley&#x27;s memoir &quot;In the Hands of the Taliban&quot; was published, which includes an account of the 10 days she was held captive. In it, she expressed worries that officers from Mossad, the Israeli secret service, or from other intelligence agencies, were plotting to have her killed in an effort to boost public support for the war in Afghanistan, having been shown incriminating documents by a journalist for the Arabic channel, Al Jazeera.

Ridley left her job with Express Newspapers, and announced she would return to Afghanistan to work on a sequel to her book. The sequel has not yet materialised, although she produced a programme for BBC Radio Four called &quot;The Return&quot;. This was after she returned in 2002 and then the following year as part of a travel feature for &quot;The Observer&quot; with her daughter Daisy.

Ridley was employed in 2003 by the Qatar-based media organisation Al Jazeera, where, as a senior editor, she helped launch their English-language website. In November of that year she was dismissed because Al Jazeera found her &quot;overly-vocal and argumentative style&quot; was incompatible with the station&#x27;s programme. Her termination of her employment was also attributed to her campaigning for journalists&#x27; rights on the Al Jazeera English channel and website. She brought a case for unfair dismissal against the organisation, winning that case and the subsequent appeals which took four years. She was awarded 100,000 Qatari riyals, which equated to around £14,000. In December 2003, she released a novel, &quot;Ticket to Paradise&quot;, based on the backdrop of 9/11.

She began presenting &quot;The Agenda With Yvonne Ridley&quot;, the Islam Channel&#x27;s politics and current affairs programme, in October 2005. In 2007, the Islam Channel was fined £30,000 by Ofcom after a series of breaches relating to her show and another show. She resigned in April 2007, complaining that she had effectively been dismissed after relations between her and the channel&#x27;s CEO, Mohamed Ali Harrath, broke down. She brought another case of unfair dismissal and sex discrimination. In April 2008, Ridley again won her case and was awarded £26,000 damages against the Islam Channel.

Ridley is a freelance journalist and presenter, and for several years regularly worked for Press TV, the Iranian English-language 24-hour news channel. She hosted a weekly current affairs and politics show called &quot;The Agenda&quot;. She also wrote a column for the now-closed &quot;Daily Muslims&quot;, an online newspaper for North American Muslims. It was in this paper that an obituary calling Chechen militant Islamist Shamil Basayev a &quot;shaheed&quot;, a Muslim honorific for &quot;martyr&quot;, was published.

In May 2008, in an assignment for Press TV, she and the film-maker David Miller shot a documentary on the Guantanamo Bay detention camp where they filmed on-site and also interviewed former inmates. Their film &quot;Guantanamo: Inside the Wire&quot; was nominated in the 2009 Roma Film Fest in Italy, and in the 2010 Aljazeera International Documentary Film Festival in Qatar. Another film made in 2009 was also nominated in the 2010 Aljazeera festival; &quot;In Search of Prisoner 650&quot;, directed by Hassan Ghani, claimed that Aafia Siddiqui was held prisoner in secret by the US.

In 2008, Ridley interviewed Gazan Prime Minister Ismael Haniyeh for Press TV. In early 2009, Ridley helped organise and took part in the Viva Palestina convoy of around 100 vehicles bearing aid across North Africa to Gaza via the Rafah border.

In July 2009, in the wake of Press TV&#x27;s coverage of the 2009 Iranian presidential election and the subsequent protests, Ridley and other journalists working for Press TV were accused of being stooges for the Iranian regime.

===Election candidate===

Ridley was first on the Respect list for the 2004 European Elections for the North East England region, but was not elected; the party placed last with 1.1% of the vote. She stood for Respect in the Leicester South by-election in 2004, where she came fourth with 12.7% of the vote. When she stood there again in the 2005 general election, although she still placed fourth, her share of the vote fell to 6.4%. In the local government elections in 2006, she stood unsuccessfully for a seat on Westminster City Council.

In the 2012 Rotherham by-election, held on 29 November, Ridley was the Respect Party candidate. &quot;Respect Yourself&quot;, a leaflet distributed during the campaign which accused the Labour Party of racism, was attributed by Labour to Respect. Labour reported the matter to the police and the returning officer. Respect put the incident down to &quot;dirty tricks&quot;; the leaflet was without the legally required notice identifying the source. In the final result, Ridley came fourth with 1,778 votes or just over 8% of the total votes cast.

Ridley stood as an independent candidate in Newcastle upon Tyne Central and West against Labour MP Chi Onwurah in the 2024 general election, coming 4th with 8.8%.

==Views and opinions==
Ridley has given vocal support for Muslim causes involving Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan, Kashmir, Chechnya, Xinjiang and Uzbekistan at anti-war demonstrations.

She has been highly critical of Britain&#x27;s foreign policy. In complaining of patriotic sentiments voiced by British Muslim pop star Sami Yusuf, and the enthusiasm for him shown by his Muslim fans, she has said:How can anyone be proud to be British? Britain is the third most hated country in the world. The Union Jack is drenched in the blood of our brothers and sisters across Iraq, Afghanistan, and Palestine. Our history is steeped in the blood of colonialism, rooted in slavery, brutality, torture, and oppression. During a February 2006 meeting at Imperial College London, Ridley described Israel as &quot;that disgusting little watchdog of America that is festering in the Middle East&quot; and said that Respect &quot;is a Zionist-free party ... if there was any Zionism in the Respect Party they would be hunted down and kicked out. We have no time for Zionists,&quot; while both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats were &quot;riddled with Zionists.&quot; She described the British politician David Miliband, then foreign secretary (and Jewish), on her blog in 2008 as being &quot;a gutless little weasel who lost more than his foreskin when he was circumcised?&quot; Ridley has compared the Israeli Government to the Nazis and has argued that the Israeli Parliament &quot;is on the path of reviving the policies of Adolf Hitler&quot; and that Israeli politicians are &quot;promoting a Final Solution for Gaza&quot;.

At the &quot;Muslimer i Dialog&quot; conference in Copenhagen in September 2005, Ridley was asked by Danish terror expert Lars Erslev Andersen if she saw it as a problem that militant Islamists distribute recruiting videos of Iraqi insurgents killing hostages. She replied that Muslims used the videos at home as an alternative form of news to what she perceived as the propaganda of Western media. At the same meeting, she compared British Prime Minister Tony Blair with Pol Pot. She returned to Copenhagen in May 2006 to take part in an Islam Channel conference on Islamophobia, where she urged Muslims not to &quot;kneel before their enemies&quot; or &quot;kiss the hand that slaps them&quot;.

In a 2003 speech at IslamExpo, she protested the attention given honour killings and female genital mutilation by the media, which &quot;have nothing to do with Islam&quot;. The idea that Islam oppresses women is the biggest obstacle to women accepting Islam, she argued. She herself had believed it, but in keeping her promise to her Taliban captors that she would read the Quran, she &quot;realized I had been lied to&quot;, and converted. On the subject of the compulsory hijab, she said: &quot;I was in Iran last year. I know the hijab is a pain for them, but they will get no sympathy from me. It is clear that the hijab is an obligation, not a choice.&quot;

Among her controversial opinions is that the Chechen terrorist leader and architect of the Beslan school massacre, Shamil Basayev, was a &#x27;shaheed&#x27; i.e. Islamic martyr. When the family of Al-Qaeda leader Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi denounced him, Ridley declared this &quot;cowardly&quot; and said she would &quot;rather put up with a brother like Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi any day than have a traitor or a sell-out for a father, son or grandfather&quot;.

At a meeting of Respect on 6 June 2006, following the Forest Gate raid, Ridley urged all Muslims in Britain to &quot;boycott the police and refuse to co-operate with them in any way, shape or form until the boys are released&quot;, including &quot;asking the community copper for directions to passing the time of day with a beat officer.&quot; Her comments were labelled as &quot;sheer, undiluted madness&quot; by Shadow Home Secretary David Davis, who added that &quot;To not co-operate would be of no benefit to the Muslim community; no benefit to the police; and no benefit to the security of our country.&quot; Respect&#x27;s only MP, George Galloway, quickly distanced himself from her comments, saying Ridley was wrong and, &quot;Our policy is not that we should withdraw co-operation from the police&quot;. Ridley later said that she only wanted Muslim leaders, not the whole community, to stop co-operating.

Initially, Ridley said that she strongly opposed the Western intervention in the 2011 Libyan Civil War, and spoke in a rally opposing it held in central London where she likened asking for Western support to making a pact with the Devil. However, she later travelled to rebel-held territory, where she said that she became a wholehearted supporter of the Libyan rebels&#x27; cause and accepted that they had no choice but to ask for help from the West.

In 2012, she expressed her strong support for the end of secret evidence used in the SIAC case against the Jordanian Islamist cleric, Abu Qatada, and her opposition to Home Secretary Theresa May&#x27;s plans to deport him on the basis of the secret evidence from the UK.

In February 2018, Ridley was invited to speak at the Oxford Union as part of a debate entitled &quot;This House Believes We Cannot Thrive Without Religion&quot;. The invitation was criticised by the Oxford University Jewish Society, who released a statement which claimed that &quot;Ms. Ridley has a long and detailed history of making exactly the sort of comments that cause Jewish students to feel targeted and unsafe on campus&quot;. She has been widely criticised as an antisemite.

In February 2025, Ridley appeared on Talk with journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer and stated that Hamas had shown &quot;kindness&quot; to the Israeli hostages they had kidnapped in the October 7, 2023 attack, only to have their efforts &quot;backlashed&quot; by the Israelis. In a heated exchange, Hartley-Brewer demanded &quot;Are you kidding me? Do tell me what the acts of kindness were. The pita bread once every three days for those men kept in a tunnel for 16 months?&quot; to which Ridley replied, &quot;They gave [the hostages they released in February 2025] goody bags. I don&#x27;t know what was in them, but they gave them gifts. They gave them little mementos, Palestinian mementos.” An astonished Hartley-Brewer called Ridley a &quot;Hamas apologist&quot; and said &quot;Acts of kindness from your hostage-taker, the man who&#x27;s kidnapped you and terrified you and starved you for months? Yvonne, what&#x27;s happened to you?”

===Denial of entry===
In January 2013, Ridley was scheduled to attend the Spring of Islam Conference organised by the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind in Hyderabad, India. She was given all necessary clearances by the external affairs ministry, but was denied a visa at the last minute because of the tense situation in Hyderabad following the arrest of controversial local legislator Akbaruddin Owaisi a few days before the event was scheduled to take place. However Ridley, via video conference, addressed three sessions of girls, women and journalists during the conference.

===Views on ISIL===
Ridley said there is a clear difference between the ideologies of the Taliban and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also called ISIS and Daesh), arguing that while the Taliban aims to form an Islamic state within the borders of Afghanistan, ISIL was working to create a border-less Islamic state and disregarded the sovereignty of other nations. She also claimed that ISIL recruited by promising financial supports and power, and the Taliban is largely run and supported by Afghan people. These were taken from her 2015 interview with Iranian newspaper &quot;Shargh&quot;. She wrote a damning chapter on the exploits of ISIL in her book &quot;The Rise of the Prophet Muhammad: Don&#x27;t Shoot the Messenger&quot;. In 2013, Ridley offered to swap places with ISIL hostage David Haines, according to reports published later.

==Personal life==
Ridley has been married five times. She first married when she was 22; her second marriage, to a policeman, lasted seven years; her third husband was Daoud Zaaroura, the CEO of North of England Refugee Service and a former PLO head of intelligence, whom she met in Cyprus, where she was working on an assignment for the Newcastle-based &quot;Sunday Sun&quot;, and they have one daughter, Daisy Ridley, who was born in 1992; her fourth husband, to whom she was married until 1999, was an Israeli businessman, Ilan Hermosh; her fifth husband is an Algerian.

During her time on the &quot;Sunday Sun&quot; newsdesk, she told colleagues she was an officer in the Territorial Army, based on Teesside, specialising in intelligence. She had also told the same to colleagues on &quot;The Northern Echo&quot; and repeated it in interviews.

Ridley resides in Scotland, where she moved to in 2011, and was a Scottish National Party (SNP) member, largely in her newly-found desire to support and aid Scottish independence. She is also a feminist and a socialist. In 2021, Ridley confirmed that she had left the SNP and joined the Alba Party, primarily over her disagreement with SNP policy around gender recognition.

In January 2014, Ridley was nominated for the Muslim Woman of the Year award at the British Muslim Awards. She has worked with the non-governmental organisation Protect the Rohingya, when she helped a team of South African lawyers take statements of alleged war crimes from refugees who had fled Myanmar. She has also worked with Syrian women prisoners who were victims of torture and abuse while held by the Assad regime in Syria.

She was portrayed by Hattie Morahan in the film &quot;Official Secrets&quot;.

<text>Manchester Museum is a museum displaying works of archaeology, anthropology and natural history and is owned by the University of Manchester, in England. Sited on Oxford Road (A34) at the heart of the university&#x27;s group of neo-Gothic buildings, it provides access to about 4.5 million items from every continent. It is the UK’s largest university museum and serves both as a major visitor attraction and as a resource for academic research and teaching. It has around 430,000 visitors each year.

==History==
The museum&#x27;s first collections were assembled by the Manchester Society of Natural History formed in 1821 with the purchase of the collection of John Leigh Philips. The society established a museum in Peter Street, Manchester, on a site later occupied by the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association, in 1835. In 1850 the collections of the Manchester Geological Society (founded 1838) were added. By the 1860s both societies encountered financial difficulties and, on the advice of the evolutionary biologist Thomas Huxley, Owens College (now the University of Manchester) accepted responsibility for the collections in 1867. The museum in Peter Street was sold in 1875 after Owens College moved to new buildings in Oxford Street.

The college commissioned Alfred Waterhouse, architect of London&#x27;s Natural History Museum, to design a museum to house the collections for the benefit of students and the public on a site in Oxford Road (then Oxford Street). The Manchester Museum was opened to the public in 1888. At the time, the scientific departments of the college were immediately adjacent, and students entered the galleries from their teaching rooms in the Beyer Building.

Two subsequent extensions mirror the development of its collections. The 1912 pavilion was largely funded by Jesse Haworth, a textile merchant, to house the archaeological and Egyptological collections acquired through excavations he had supported. The 1927 extension was built to house the ethnographic collections. The Gothic Revival street frontage which continues to the Whitworth Hall has been ingeniously integrated by three generations of the Waterhouse family. When the adjacent University Dental Hospital of Manchester moved to a new site, its old building was used for teaching and subsequently occupied by the museum.

The museum is one of the University of Manchester&#x27;s &#x27;cultural assets&#x27;, along with the Whitworth Art Gallery, John Rylands Library, Jodrell Bank visitor centre and others.

===2020s redevelopment===
Manchester Museum temporarily closed on 29 August 2021 for redevelopment. During this time the Museum underwent the final phase of a £13.5 million reconstruction programme. The renovated museum includes a two-storey extension and new galleries including a large Exhibition Hall, Belonging Gallery, the Lee Kai Hung Chinese Culture Gallery and the South Asia Gallery. The South Asia Gallery is a partnership with the British Museum and will be the first ever permanent exhibition space in the UK dedicated to the stories, experiences and contributions of South Asian communities. The museum reopened 18 February 2023 and managed to attract 52,000 visitors in its first week after reopening.

==Galleries and redevelopment==

In 1997 the museum was awarded £12.5 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund and with funding from the European Regional Development Fund, the University of Manchester, the Wellcome Trust, the Wolfson Foundation and other sponsors, the museum was refurbished and reopened in 2003. At this time the Fossils Gallery and Living Cultures Galleries were developed and The Vivarium was established on the second floor of the 1885 building.

The Manchester Gallery explores the changing relationship between the museum, Manchester and the rest of the world. It explores where collections came from and how they relate to colonialism and empire.

Living Worlds opened in April 2011 as a new type of natural history gallery to encourage visitors to reflect on their attitudes to nature. The gallery was designed by Brussels-based design firm villa eugenie. Exhibits include a mounted demoiselle crane with a piece of rubble from the Hiroshima atomic bomb blast and hundreds of origami cranes. Themed exhibits explore attitudes to nature and environmental issues. The gallery has a smartphone app, &#x27;Living Worlds&#x27;. This gallery has an allotment in the courtyard in front of the museum, where volunteers grow fruit and vegetables and show visitors how to grow and look after plants.

Ancient Worlds opened in October 2012 and transformed the main galleries of the 1912 building. Discovering Archaeology explores how people make sense of the past using objects and includes exhibits on facial reconstruction and some of the characters who were involved in the development of archaeology and the museum, including William Flinders Petrie and William Boyd Dawkins. Egyptian Worlds, takes visitors on a journey through the landscape, customs and practices of the Ancient Egyptians. Exploring Objects, reveals the archaeology collections through &#x27;visible storage&#x27; with a difference. The gallery incorporates a haptic interactive.
In June 2013 time-lapse footage showing a 10-inch Egyptian statue in the museum&#x27;s collection, apparently spinning around unaided, attracted worldwide media attention. Various theories were put forward, with the university&#x27;s Professor Brian Cox suggesting &quot;differential friction&quot; between the glass shelf and the object, possibly caused by vibrations made by visitors, caused the object to move. The museum&#x27;s Egyptologist Campbell Price, said &quot;it has been on those surfaces since we have had it and it has never moved before. And why would it go around in a perfect circle?&quot;. The &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; reported that the incident &quot;sent visitor numbers soaring at the Manchester Museum&quot;, and Tim Manley, head of marketing and communications, commented that &quot;There&#x27;s been a definite spike in visitors&quot;.

Nature&#x27;s Library opened in April 2013 displaying the museum&#x27;s range of natural history, using a design inspired by a Gothic library to capitalise on the gallery&#x27;s Gothic Revival architecture. Displays explore the variety of the natural world, where the collection came from, why people collect specimens, how they are used, and what they can tell scientists.

In 2004 the museum acquired a reproduction cast of a fossil &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; which is mounted in a running posture. &quot;Stan&quot;, as it is called, is based on the second most complete T. rex excavated in 1992 in South Dakota, by Stan Sacrison.

Alchemy was a project initiating and facilitating artists&#x27; access to the museum and university. Funded by Arts Council England it offered four Alchemy Artist Fellowships, curated artist interventions in the permanent galleries and facilitated research and the loan of the museum&#x27;s collections for contemporary art projects. Alchemy was the museum&#x27;s first such sustained research programme. It aimed to reinvigorate displays, encourage diverse approaches and present alternative voices.

In August 2007, a temporary exhibition &quot;Myths About Race&quot; was opened. Many Victorian institutions are now viewed as having contributed to the racist thinking that justified slavery. As part of the &quot;Revealing Histories: Remembering Slavery&quot; project, it explored difficult and sensitive issues.

Lindow Man was on display for a year from April 2008, on loan from the British Museum.

==Collections==

===Anthropology===

The collection totals about 16,000 artefacts, nearly half of which are from Africa. Material from Oceania makes up a quarter and much of the remainder comes from Asia and the Americas. The first large donation came from Robert Dukinfield Darbishire (1826–1908), beginning in 1904/05. Darbishire gave about 700 items, including ceramics from Peru and Eskimo carvings. In 1922, Charles Heape donated his Oceanian and American collection, amounting to about 1500 items. It included a collection of weapons and paddles from the Pacific islands, collected by missionaries and others. Some items from Aboriginal Australians of Victoria, Australia were acquired while Heape was resident. The Lloyd collection of Japanese metalwork, carvings and ceramics were the bequest of R. W. Lloyd. There are two collections obtained in the field by professional anthropologists. Frank Willett collected pottery, masks and ritual regalia in Nigeria in 1956 and Peter Worsley collected basketry and other items from the Wanindiljaugwa people of Groote Eylandt, Australia in 1952.

===Archaeology===

The major collecting areas in archaeology have been Western Europe, the Mediterranean, Egypt and Western Asia. Large accessions of material from Egypt and Western Asia came from the excavations of Sir Flinders Petrie and subsequently archaeologists from the university have been involved in expeditions to Western Asia and brought more finds. The Egyptological collections include finds from Kahun and Gurob, presented in 1890 by Jesse Haworth and Martyn Kennard. By 1912 the growth of this area had been so great that a new wing was added for the Egyptian material to which Jesse Haworth made a major donation of funds. Its first keeper was Winifred M. Crompton.

The Egyptian Mummy Research Project, begun in 1973 under Rosalie David&#x27;s direction, has yielded much information on health and social conditions in ancient Egypt and radiology and endoscopy have been used extensively. One of the mummies studied was the first mummy to be completely unwrapped in Britain since 1908. This was mummy no. 1770 in 1975. From 1979 the researchers developed non-destructive techniques by a combination of radiology and endoscopy. The results are held on the International Mummy Data Base, stored on the university computer. A redesign of the galleries in 1984/85 resulted in improved displays. The archaeology collections were redisplayed in 2011 in the Ancient Worlds galleries. A bog body, Worsley Man, is also in the care of the museum. Lindow Man, another bog body had previously been displayed.
===Archery===
The nucleus of the archery collection of about 2,000 exhibits was formed by Ingo Simon and donated in 1946. Simon was an accomplished archer who spent many years researching its history and the development of bows. From 1914 to 1933 he held the world record for a flight-shot at 462 yards; he died in 1964 and his widow Erna (lady world champion, 1937, died 1973) endowed a trust to conserve and develop the collection which includes artefacts from Great Britain, Brazil, Europe, India, Pakistan, Japan, Central Asia, Africa, and the Pacific islands. Inger K. Frith, President of the Fédération Internationale de Tir à l&#x27;Arc from 1961 to 1977, was very involved in the curation and setting up of the collection.

===Botany===
The Manchester Herbarium contains upwards of 950,000 specimens collected during the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries and most countries are represented. Accessions are still made and many specialist enquiries are received. Only a small part of the collection is exhibited. Important contributions came from Charles Bailey and James Cosmo Melvill and some specimens from Carolus Linnæus, the expeditions of Charles Darwin and Admiral Sir John Franklin are included. The small collection made by Leopold H. Grindon which includes many cultivated plants is also important.

===Earth sciences===

The geological collections are of more than local importance and consist of more than 9,000 mineralogical specimens and several hundred thousand fossils. Approximately one twentieth of the collection is displayed and the remainder in storage but available for study by interested persons. Much of the collecting was done in the second half of the 19th century and among the collections are the David Homfray collection from the Cambrian and Ordovician strata of Wales and the collections of George H. Hickling and D. M. S. Watson from the Silurian of the Dudley district, West Midlands and from the Old Red Sandstone. Other specimens include the fossilised plants of the Coal Measures, the S. S. Buckman collection of ammonites, an ichthyosaur from Whitby and 40,000 mammalian bones from an excavation at Creswell Crags, Derbyshire and the David Forbes World Collection of minerals. Since the 1920s there has been a policy of complementary collecting by the museum and the university Department of Geology by which the museum specialises in hard rock petrology.
The museum&#x27;s collection of zeolite group minerals originated from a donation by Caroline Birley in 1894.

===Entomology===
The museum&#x27;s collection amounts to nearly 3 million specimens. It has 10,500 type specimens (of 2,300 species) and additions are frequently made to it. Coleoptera represent about half the total number of specimens. The British collections constitute about 1,250,000 specimens and only a small proportion of the known species are unrepresented. Harry Britten, assistant keeper 1918–1938, had a leading role in the development of the collection. Coleoptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera specimens amount to some 1,100,000 in total. Of the Manchester moth (&quot;Euclemensia woodiella&quot;) captured on Kersal Moor in 1829, one of only three specimens known to be in existence is here. The remainder of the collection is of foreign origin and W. D. Hincks and John R. Dibb contributed great quantities of specimens, particularly of Coleoptera. Coleoptera number some 900,000 out of an approximate total 1,750,000. The Chrysomedinae-Cassidinae collection of Franz Spaeth is among the finest collections of tortoise-beetles.

===Numismatic collection===
The first coins were donated by the businessman Reuben Spencer in 1895 and the rest of his collection of European coins and commemorative medals in various metals was donated in instalments. Alfred Güterbock deposited, then bequeathed a collection of 380 Greek gold, silver and copper coins together with some Roman coins. In the next forty years four benefactions were made: in 1912 from William Smith Churchill (European coins of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries); in 1925 William Smith Ogden&#x27;s collection of antiquities, including Greek and Roman coins; in 1939 Egbert Steinthal, honorary keeper of the coin room, presented his collection of English copper coins; and in 1958 Harold Raby&#x27;s bequest of Greek and Roman coins. Harold Raby succeeded Steinthal as honorary keeper and they were responsible for work on the arrangement and identification of the coins. The museum also holds the Great Jackson Street Hoard a hoard of 26 Roman coins found in Manchester near the junction of Chester Road and Great Jackson Street at some point in the 1890s. The hoard is unusual for British hoards in that 19 of the coins were struck in third century Alexandria.

===Amphibians===
The museum&#x27;s collection of live amphibians, housed in the Vivarium, includes some of the most critically endangered neotropical species in the world. The Vivarium&#x27;s displays offer an opportunity to observe the behaviour of a wide variety of species from Madagascar, South and Central America, and Australasia, in naturalistic exhibits. The maintenance of the museum&#x27;s live animals operates under the highest Zoo Licence standards to ensure their health and care is optimised. A conservation research collection of rare neotropical frogs is maintained off display. These form part of non-invasive research projects and captive breeding programmes to support the &quot;in-situ&quot; and &quot;ex-situ&quot; conservation of the species concerned. These include the Lemur Leaf Frog, the Yellow-eyed Leaf Frog, and the Splendid Leaf Frog. The live collection at the museum is used as an important educational resource, and related engagement work extends to environmental education programmes developed in Costa Rica and Panama.

===Mammals===
The collection includes several thousand mammal specimens. Many mounted specimens are from the original Manchester Natural History Society collection. Mounted mammals include a lowland gorilla, an aye aye, and a red panda collected by Brian Houghton Hodgson. Most mammal groups are represented. Mr Potter&#x27;s cow is a member of the British White breed from the extinct Gisburne herd from the 1830s. The museum holds a number of examples of taxidermy by Rowland Ward for Maurice Egerton (Lord Egerton of Tatton Park). The collection includes bones and skulls of a wide range of mammals, covering most major groups. Many of the collections were transferred from the Anatomy Department in the 1980s. The museum holds the bone collection put together by Derek Yalden.

===Birds===
The collection includes approximately 15,000 bird study skins from more than 2,000 species mostly from 1850 to 1950. A collections of birds was transferred from the Natural History Museum in 1895, including a warbler finch collected by Charles Darwin on the Galapagos in 1835. The bird skin collection of Henry Eeles Dresser acquired in 1895 includes Palaearctic bird species, bee-eaters and rollers that formed the basis of Dresser&#x27;s books. The bird skin collection of approximately 7,500 specimens includes specimens that John Gerrard Keulemans and Joseph Wolf used to prepare illustrations for &#x27;A History of the Birds of Europe&#x27;. Dresser was a member of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union and the Zoological Society of London. His collection includes specimens from Nikolai Prjevalsky, Robert Swinhoe, Henry Tristram, Alfred Wallace and Henry Seebohm. A collection of birds from the Hawaiian Islands was received from the Royal Society in the 1890s including species that are now extinct. The museum holds the collections of Thomas Coward, Richard Spiers Standen and Robert Coombes who specialised in Eurasian goose species; this collection was acquired in the 1990s. The collection of bones includes many bird skulls. The collection formed by Derek Yalden includes skeletons of thousands of birds that were sexed. The egg collection includes approximately 10,000 sets of eggs.

Notable specimens include a male and female huia, bones of the dodo, an elephant bird egg, the only known egg of the slender-billed curlew, two study skins, a mount and several eggs of the passenger pigeon, bones of the great auk, a male and female ivory-billed woodpecker, three specimens of the paradise parrot and a warbler finch collected by Charles Darwin.

===Corals===
The museum has many specimens of coral that came from Sydney Hickson, a specialist on corals and one-time Professor of Zoology at the University of Manchester. These include a number of type specimens of names published by Hickson and others, including Stanley Gardiner.

===Bryozoa===
The museum holds the bryozoa collection of Arthur Waters, a naturalist who lived near Manchester. Waters described the bryozoa of the &quot;Challenger&quot; expedition. The collection includes approximately 10,000 specimens including hundreds of type specimens. The museum also holds the bryozoa collection of Eliza Jelly, another eminent 19th-century bryozoologist.

===Molluscs===
The museum has the fourth largest mollusc collection in Britain with 166,000 lots. The collection grew around that of the Manchester Society for the Promotion of Natural History, which acquired one of William Swainson&#x27;s shell collections in 1825 and which also included the collection of Captain Thomas Brown. Catalogue of type specimens was published in 2008.

Type material is found in the collections of Alexander Abercrombie (India), Robert Dukinfield Darbishire, Professor Alfred Cort Haddon (Torres Straits), Reverend James Hadfield (Lifu, Loyalty Islands), Lewis John Shackleford (especially &quot;Marginella&quot;), George Cooper Spence (especially African land snails and &quot;Urocoptis&quot; and many specimens from Matthew William Kemble Connolly and Hugh Berthon Preston), Frederick W. Townsend (Persian Gulf), syntype material from the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition (1902–1904) and that received from the Smithsonian Institution in 1973 in an exchange. Material from the collections of Alexander Abercrombie, Alfred Cort Haddon, Rev. James Hadfield, Lewis John Shackleford, Frederick W. Townsend and the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition was described by James Cosmo Melvill II who had close connections with the museum; many species were described with Robert Standen of the museum.

===Spirit collection===
The collection includes around 5,000 spirit specimens (wet specimens) from the 19th and early 20th century, although more recent acquisitions include the alligator collection formed by Professor Mark Ferguson of the Faculty of Life Sciences and Renovo plc.

===Microscope slides===
The collection includes the foraminifera collection of Frederick Pearcey, who served on the Challenger Expedition and worked at one time in the museum. Other collections of forams come from Joseph Sidebotham and E. Halkyard.

==Repatriation of artefacts==
In late October 2019 the first collection of many sacred artefacts belonging to Indigenous Australian peoples held in US museums were returned by Illinois State Museum to Australia. This was the first phase of the project coinciding with the 250th anniversary of Captain James Cook&#x27;s first voyage to Australia in 2020, working to repatriate a large number of artefacts from foreign museums. The next phase of the project is to bring back 40 culturally significant objects from the Manchester Museum, including &quot;body ornaments made from feathers, teeth and wood, hair bundles and belts&quot;. These would be returned to the Aranda, Yukulta / Ganggalidda, Garawa, Nyamal and Yawuru peoples. In November 2019 the Museum returned 43 secret sacred and ceremonial items from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders communities back to Australia.

In September 2023, Manchester Museum returned 174 artefacts to Indigenous Australian people, encouraging cultural institutions to &quot;recognize harm but also encourage healing&quot;. The director for culture and emergencies at UNESCO, Krista Pikkat, said &quot;May this occasion be a source of inspiration, encouraging others to embark on similar journeys.&quot; The Anindilyakwa women attending the ceremony at the Museum received objects from the collection including carvings, baskets, decorations and a major collection of shell dolls.

<text>The Manchester Jewish Museum is a Jewish history museum, located on 190 Cheetham Hill Road in Manchester, England, in the United Kingdom. The museum occupies the site of a former Orthodox Jewish synagogue, the place of worship for the Congregation of Spanish &amp; Portuguese Jews, called the Spanish &amp; Portuguese Synagogue, also the Sha&#x27;are Tephillah Synagogue. The congregation worships in the Sephardic rite from premises located at 18 Moor Lane, Kersal, Salford.

The building, used as a synagogue from 1874 until 1984, was listed as a Grade II* building in 1974.

== History ==
The former synagogue for Spanish and Portuguese Jews was completed in 1874. However, the building became redundant through the migration of the Jewish population away from the Cheetham area further north to Prestwich and Whitefield. It re-opened as a museum in March 1984 telling the story of the history of Jewish settlement in Manchester and its community over more than 200 years.

The museum reopened on 2 July 2021 following a 6 million redevelopment and extension. The museum includes a new gallery, vegetarian café, shop and learning studio and kitchen, as well as complete restoration of the former Spanish and Portuguese synagogue.

Following completion of the renovation works, Manchester Jewish Museum won two awards at the annual British Construction Industry Awards (Cultural and Leisure Project of the Year and Best Small Project of the Year) alongside architects Citizens Design Bureau and structural engineers Buro Happold.

The museum holds over 31,000 items in its collection, documenting the story of Jewish migration and settlement in Manchester. It includes over 530 oral history testimonies, over 20,000 photographs, 138 recorded interviews with Holocaust survivors and refugees and other objects, documents and ephemera.

==Moorish Revival building==
The 1874 synagogue was completed in the Moorish Revival style, designed by Edward Salomons, a prominent Manchester architect. Although the synagogue was not the largest or most magnificent of the world&#x27;s many Moorish Revival synagogues, which include the opulent Princes Road Synagogue in Liverpool, it was considered to be a &quot;jewel&quot;. The style, a homage to the architecture of Moorish Spain, perhaps seemed particularly fitting for the home of a Sephardic congregation. The two tiers of horseshoe windows on the façade were emblematic of the style, and the recessed doorway and arcade of five windows on the floor above the entrance are particularly decorative. Inside, a horseshoe arch frames the heichal and polychrome columns support the galleries. The mashrabiyya latticework on the front doors is particularly fine.

<text>Kiel Auditorium was an indoor arena located in St. Louis, Missouri. It was the home of the Saint Louis University basketball team, and hosted the NBA&#x27;s St. Louis Hawks from 1955 to 1968.

From 1913 to 1930, the site was home to Charles H. Turpin&#x27;s Booker T. Washington Theater where performers included his brother Tom Turpin. 

The Municipal Arena was completed in 1934 at a cost of $6 million. It seated 9,300 and was built by Fruin-Colnon Construction. The Kiel Auditorium replaced the St. Louis Coliseum as the city&#x27;s main indoor arena. The Kiel was originally named the Municipal Auditorium, but was renamed in honor of former St. Louis Mayor Henry Kiel in 1943. A unique feature of the auditorium was that it was split into two; the front of the building was the Kiel Opera House. It was possible to use both sides at once as the stages were back to back. President Harry Truman gave a speech there in which both sides were opened to see his speech.

In 1955, the auditorium was the venue for the second international conference of Alcoholics Anonymous, which established the service conference structure for the movement.

Kiel Auditorium played host to a variety of concerts and sports events until its closure in 1991. In 1983, it was the host of the Miss Universe Pageant. From the 1950s until the 1970s, the Kiel Auditorium was behind only Madison Square Garden as North America&#x27;s most famous wrestling arena, hosting three NWA World Heavyweight Championship title changes from 1959 until 1986. The most notable wrestling event that took place at the Kiel Auditorium was WCW&#x27;s premier event, Starrcade 1990. The building was demolished in 1992, but not before hosting the Missouri Valley Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament the preceding year.

After its demolition, its games and concerts temporarily went to the St. Louis Arena.

The Enterprise Center (originally named &quot;Kiel Center&quot;, then &quot;Savvis Center&quot;, then &quot;Scottrade Center&quot;, before the current naming rights were purchased) now stands on the site of the former Kiel Auditorium. The Opera House portion of the building, on the northern part of the property, facing Market Street, was not torn down. It remained vacant for a while, but was renovated and reopened under the name Peabody Opera House in 2011. It is now known as the Stifel Theatre.

<text>This is a list of cathedrals in the United States, including both actual cathedrals (seats of bishops in episcopal Christian groups, such as Catholicism, Anglicanism, Eastern Orthodoxy and the Armenian Apostolic Church) and a few prominent churches from non-episcopal denominations that have the word &quot;cathedral&quot; in their names.

The United States is, according to some measures, home to the largest cathedral in the world: the Cathedral of St. John the Divine (Episcopal) in New York City.

<doc id="766979" wikidata="Q14709045" url="?curid=766979" title="Little River (North Umpqua River tributary)">
<text>The Little River is a tributary of the North Umpqua River, about long, in southwestern Oregon in the United States. It drains part of the western side of the Cascade Range east of Roseburg, between the North and South Umpqua.

Little River rises north of Quartz Mountain in eastern Douglas County in the Umpqua National Forest. It flows west-northwest and joins the North Umpqua from the south at Glide, approximately 12 miles (19 km) east-northeast of Roseburg. The confluence is known as Colliding Rivers because of the nearly head-on angle at which the streams meet.

The current Colliding Rivers Information Center was originally the North Umpqua Ranger Station of the Umpqua National Forest. It was built in 1938 by the Civilian Conservation Corps and United States Forest Service (USFS). It was converted to a residence in the 1950s, but in 1990 the building began to be restored to be similar to the original condition for use as an information center. Opened in 1992, the visitor center is managed jointly by the Forest Service, the Roseburg Visitor and Convention Bureau and the Bureau of Land Management. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Name==
An early name for the river was the &quot;East Umpqua&quot;. In 1855, a pioneer settler, Meshek Tipton, filed a donation land claim near the confluence of the East Umpqua and North Umpqua rivers. Tipton had lived near the Little River in Tennessee before emigrating to Oregon. It is thought that Tipton changed the East Umpqua&#x27;s name to &quot;Little River&quot; in memory of his birthplace.

==Course==
Little River begins north of Quartz Mountain and east of Hemlock Lake in the Umpqua National Forest of southwestern Oregon. Flowing north for about , it turns west before plunging over Yakso Falls. Beyond the falls, it receives Hemlock Creek from the left and then Junction and Pinnacle creeks from the right. Cedar Creek enters from the right about from the mouth. Over the next , Taft Creek enters from the right and then Clover and Black creeks from the left.

Downstream of Black Creek, the Little River turns northwest and receives Little Taft and Poore creeks from the right and White Creek from the left. White Creek Campground is on the left at the mouth of White Creek. Below this, Negro Creek enters from the left, and Cool Water Campground is on the right at river mile (RM) 17. About later, the river arrives at Emile Creek Campground. Over the next stretch, Little River receives Emile and Shivigny creeks from the right before passing by Wolf Creek Campground. The river then receives Little Creek from the right, Wolf Creek from the left, and Greenman Creek from the right.

Boundary Creek enters from the right at about RM 9. Slightly more than a mile later, Bond Creek enters from the right, then Cavitt Creek and Jim Creek from the left at RM 7. At this point, Cavitt Creek Falls and Cavitt Creek County Park is on the left, and the river passes under Cavitt Creek Bridge, a covered bridge. Further downstream, the river turns north and over the next receives Eagles Creek and Rattlesnake Creek, both from the right. Turning west again, the river receives Williams Creek from the right and Fall and Buckhorn creeks from the left before heading north and northwest for the final . Little River passes under Oregon Route 138 and meets the North Umpqua River near Glide, from the larger stream&#x27;s confluence with the South Umpqua River.

For much of its length, Little River is paralleled by Forest Road 27, which is gravel along the upstream stretches but becomes paved for the lowermost . Below that, it is known as County Road 17 (Little River Road), a paved highway that follows the river all the way to Route 138 and the river mouth.

==Watershed==
The heavily forested Little River watershed, which extends from the western Cascades to the Umpqua Valley hills, includes a variety of conifers, hardwoods, and prairie vegetation. As of 2006, 63 percent of the land was publicly owned, and 37 percent was private. The U.S. Forest Service administered about of the public land and the Bureau of Land Management about . Roughly 97 percent of the land, public and private, was devoted to forestry.

Homes and ranches are located mainly near the lower river and along Cavitt Creek. There are no large population centers in the watershed; most of the unincorporated community of Glide lies outside the basin. It is estimated that in 2000 only 1,200 people lived in the watershed.

Sea-going fish species in the watershed include chinook and coho salmon, steelhead, Pacific lamprey, and coastal cutthroat trout. Non-seagoing species include resident rainbow, brook, and cutthroat trout as well as kokanee. Little River and Cavett Creek provide good spawning habitat for coho salmon and other migrating species.

<doc id="766981" wikidata="Q7997298" url="?curid=766981" title="Who Killed Marilyn?">
<text>&quot;Who Killed Marilyn?&quot; is a 1981 song by Glenn Danzig, about questions surrounding the death of actress Marilyn Monroe, with the titular question suggesting she was murdered. Though Danzig&#x27;s first solo single, other recordings of the song have since been included on various collections by Danzig&#x27;s group The Misfits.

The B-side, &quot;Spook City USA&quot;, was also recorded previously with the Misfits during the &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; EP session, but that much faster version was not released until the 1996 release of the Misfits box set.

Danzig claims that he and Misfits drummer Googy could not get Jerry and guitarist Doyle to practice and perform more often, and &quot;Who Killed Marilyn?&quot; fulfilled Danzig&#x27;s need to perform and release his songs on a more regular basis. Jerry claims he had no reason not to do the songs and doesn&#x27;t know why Danzig released a solo single.

&quot;Who Killed Marilyn?&quot; continued Danzig&#x27;s obsession with the darker underside of American pop culture, as seen from the very first single&#x27;s &quot;She&quot; (about Patty Hearst) to such songs as &quot;Violent World&quot; and &quot;American Nightmare&quot;. Other versions of this song have been released by the Misfits (&quot;Legacy of Brutality&quot;, the box set, etc.), but the Glenn Danzig version recorded on this 45, along with the B-side, &quot;Spook City USA&quot;, are only available on this 45 and have never been released on CD.

== Cover versions ==
&quot;Who Killed Marilyn?&quot; was covered by Link 80 as a hidden track on their debut 1996 album &quot;17 Reasons&quot;. It was not included on the tracklist, and played eight minutes after the last listed song.

It was also covered by Steve Zing&#x27;s band Doomtree when they performed live on WMFU radio on March 27, 2003

<text>This is a list of cathedrals in France and in the French overseas departments, territories and collectivities, including both actual and former diocesan cathedrals (seats of bishops). Almost all cathedrals in France are Roman Catholic, but any non-Roman Catholic cathedrals are listed here as well.

The list is intended to be complete as far as current cathedrals and co-cathedrals are concerned. It is not yet an exhaustive list of former cathedrals, although it includes most of them.

A number of large churches in France are known as &quot;cathedral&quot; as a mark of distinction or historical importance but have never been the seats of bishops. These are not included here.

<text>The Reverend Noble Huston (died 1944), was the minister of the First Presbyterian Church in Ballynahinch, County Down and a breeder of dogs, credited with saving the Irish Red and White Setter from extinction in the early the twentieth century. According to Anna Redlich in &quot;The Dogs of Ireland&quot; (Dundalgan Press 1949), he &quot;mated his half red and half red and white bitch Gyp to Johnnie, and later on to Glen of Rossmore ... Thus in due time and by judicious selection , he managed to build up a kennel of Red and White Setters...&quot;

In addition to his canine pursuits, the Rev. Huston kept bees.

<text>The Wayfarer is a wooden or fibreglass hulled fractional Bermuda rigged sailing dinghy of great versatility; it can be used for short &#x27;day boat&#x27; trips, for longer cruises and for racing. Over 11,000 have been produced as of 2016.

The boat is long, and broad and deep enough for three adults to comfortably sail for several hours. Longer trips are undertaken by enthusiasts, notably Frank Dye who sailed W48 &#x27;Wanderer&#x27; from Scotland to Iceland and Norway, crossing the North Sea twice. The Wayfarer&#x27;s size, stability and seaworthiness have made it popular with sailing schools, and led it to be used as a family boat in a wide variety of locations.

Not only a versatile cruising dinghy, Wayfarers are also raced with a Portsmouth Number of 1105. As of 2013, it has a Portsmouth Yardstick rating of 91.6.

From the original wooden design by Ian Proctor in 1957 many subsequent versions of the Wayfarer have been produced. There is also a double-hulled Canadian clone, known as the CL 16, featuring a simplified rig but otherwise identical. Genuine Wayfarers can be identified by the &quot;W&quot; symbol on their sails.

The sail plan consists of a Bermuda rig with a main, jib, and symmetrical spinnaker. The boat uses a retractable centreboard. An optional asymmetric spinnaker and spinnaker chute is available; also available is a &quot;sail patch&quot; which provides flotation for the mast in the event of a capsize (and particularly to prevent mast inversion Turtling).

One-design racing is active and competitive regionally, nationally and internationally.

==Versions==
Over its history several versions of the Wayfarer have been developed, as follows.

===Mark I Wood===
This was the original wooden Wayfarer designed in 1957 to be manufactured by Small Craft Limited and also by amateur builders working from
authorised kits, using the measured templates and jigs supplied, with a hull and deck made from plywood. Frank Dye&#x27;s famous W48 Wanderer was of course of this type, a testament to its robust construction. The boat is now in the collection of the National Maritime Museum Cornwall in Falmouth. Other boats of this model are still racing after 60 years, and new ones can still be purchased today (on a custom basis) from Porter Brothers. The hull is of a &#x27;three plank&#x27; construction, that is with two chines. This provides a good compromise between stability and ease of construction. Both forward and aft buoyancy compartments are fitted with large watertight hatches and this provides ample stowage space for cruising. The large floor space with flat floorboards and good clearance under thwart makes the Mark I a comfortable boat for two people to sleep in, when a boom-tent is erected for shelter. The mast is held in a tabernacle, which when rigged with a tackle on the forestay allows the mast to be lowered to pass beneath bridges. This feature was retained in subsequent models, as was the hull shape.

===Mark I GRP===
A Glass Reinforced Plastic version was introduced in 1965 and was similar in layout to the wooden boat. Over two thousand copies of this model were made and many are still in use through the world. In contrast to other GRP models, this version has a large hatch to the forward buoyancy compartment useful for stowage when cruising, and a forward bulkhead extending right up to the foredeck level. The Mark I has no side buoyancy, and consequently does not suffer from a tendency to invert when capsized that plagued later models. The Mark I was also available as a &quot;composite&quot; model with a GRP hull and bulkheads but plywood fore- and side-decks.

===Mark II GRP===

The Mark II was introduced in 1974 supposedly as an improvement. The front and rear buoyancy tanks were built into the hull before bonding on the deck. The forward buoyancy compartment has a gap above it and under the foredeck. This would have been useful for a spinnaker chute, but class regulations of the time did not allow that. The forward compartment had a small circular inspection hatch thus removing much of the useful dry stowage space. Side buoyancy compartments gave this model a tendency to invert, and those owned by sailing schools soon sported socks filled with polystyrene to provide a righting moment when capsized. Reduced clearance under the thwart made this boat uncomfortable to sleep in.

A version with a self draining cockpit, the Mark II SD, was introduced in 1986. This was especially suitable for boats kept on moorings. However, the buoyancy sealed in the floor increases the inverting tendency and, when righted after a capsize, the trapped water causes instability. To help overcome this drain tubes through the aft tank were later introduced.

===Mark 1A===
This GRP model was introduced in 1987, combining the structural improvements of the Mark II with greater storage space in the bow. A horizontal bulkhead divides the bow buoyancy tank, and both the upper and lower sections have large access hatches creating secure stowage spaces.

===Wayfarer Plus S===
First produced in 1991 the Wayfarer Plus S was made with a sandwich construction for the hull and chines. This produced a boat that could compete with the original wooden boats in stiffness and weight, while having the maintenance advantages of GRP. The forward tank has a full-height bulkhead like the Mark I. The cruising version has a large hatch in the bulkhead to allow the tank to be used for stowage.

===Wayfarer World===
The Wayfarer World was introduced in 1997 and was designed as a collaboration between Ian Proctor and his son Keith. Made in GRP with no woodwork it has a removable aft storage tank, a self draining cockpit, and a spinnaker chute. The rudder stock is of aluminium alloy. Until the MkIV this was the only version with an asymmetric spinnaker, although it can not be used in class races [except in the UK]. It has proved successful in both racing and cruising, including a North Sea crossing 1998.

===Wayfarer World S Type===
The Wayfarer World S Type is generally similar to the Wayfarer World but is made using the same foam sandwich construction as the Wayfarer Plus S.

===Mark III (North America only)===
Built by Abbott Boats in Canada, production stopped in 2006 after a fire in which the molds were destroyed. The company sustained a multimillion-dollar loss.

An updated version (incorporating the 2008 design improvements by Phil Morrison of the Mark IV) is scheduled to begin future production in Canada; the &quot;Wayfarer Cruiser&quot; includes an optional asymmetrical spinnaker, which would not be allowed in racing.

===Mark IV (Hartley Wayfarer)===
Introduced in 2007 the MkIV was a significant redesign by Phil Morrison. The design is intended to be more modern and spacious inside, and easier to right and drain after a capsize. This version was also designed to be &quot;as fast as but no faster than the fastest&quot; of the older Wayfarers. The Mark IV is also available in the United States.

It has been pointed out by some experienced sailors that designs closer to the original Mark 1 boats are more suitable for cruising because of their better stability and storage spaces. The latest versions are more prone to turtling and righting them can be very difficult. This is the reason many cruising sailors prefer the older Wayfarer versions.

<text>The People&#x27;s History Museum (the National Museum of Labour History until 2001) in Manchester, England, is the United Kingdom&#x27;s national centre for the collection, conservation, interpretation and study of material relating to the history of working people in the UK. It is located in a Grade II listed, former hydraulic pumping station on the corner of Bridge Street and Water Street designed by Manchester Corporation city architect, Henry Price.

The museum tells the history of workers&#x27; rights and democracy in Great Britain and about people&#x27;s lives at home, work and leisure over the last 200 years. The collection contains printed material, physical objects and photographs of people at work, rest and play. Some of the topics covered include popular radicalism, the Peterloo Massacre, 19th century trade unionism, the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, dockers, the cooperative movement, the 1945 general election, and football. It also includes material relating to friendly societies, the welfare movement and advances in the lives of working people.

==History==

The Trade Union, Labour and Co-operative History Society operated a collection at Limehouse Town Hall between 1975 and 1986. The museum moved to Manchester and re-opened in 1990 at the Grade II* listed former Mechanics&#x27; Institute at 103 Princess Street.

In 1994, the museum opened the Pump House People&#x27;s History Museum containing a public gallery at the present site on Bridge Street. The two sites were renamed the People&#x27;s History Museum (PHM) in 2001. The Bridge Street site closed for a £12.5 million redevelopment in October 2007. The redevelopment included the refurbishment of the existing Pump House and the construction of a four-storey extension alongside it. A glass walkway was constructed to link the two buildings. The museum reopened on 13 February 2010.

==Collection==
The PHM holds one of the largest collections of political material in Britain, beginning with the early 19th century. It focuses on the history of democracy with objects relating to the right to vote making up a large part of the objects on display. The collection includes 2,000 posters focused on elections and political campaigns, 300 political cartoons, 7,000 trade union badges and tokens, as well as 95,000 photographs. With over 400 trade union and political banners, the PHM holds the largest banner collection in the world and visitors to the museum can see banners being conserved in Main Gallery Two in the Textile Conservation studio.

The museum actively collects contemporary material; it has tried to find and acquire, among other things, the EdStone upon which Labour engraved their six main manifesto pledges in the 2015 general election, and the copy of Mao&#x27;s Little Red Book which shadow chancellor John McDonnell threw across the House of Commons dispatch box at George Osborne. Through projects such as &quot;Play Your Part&quot;, the museum makes the historic collections relevant to present day issues.
The PHM also houses the Labour History Archive and Study Centre, an important archive of material relating to the history of working people in Britain. Its collections include the archives of the Labour Party, the former Communist Party of Great Britain, the co-operative movement and the Department for Work and Pensions. It also contains documents relating to Chartism, general elections, the First World War, women&#x27;s suffrage and the 1984–1985 miners&#x27; strike.

<doc id="766996" wikidata="Q2070581" url="?curid=766996" title="Battle of the Morannon">
<text>In J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s epic fantasy novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the Battle of the Morannon or the Battle of the Black Gate is the final confrontation in the War of the Ring. Gondor and its allies send a small army ostensibly to challenge Sauron at the entrance to his land of Mordor; he supposes that they have with them the One Ring and mean to use it to defeat him. In fact, the Ring is being carried by the hobbits Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee into Mordor to destroy it in Mount Doom, and the army is moving to distract Sauron from them. Before the battle, a nameless leader, the &quot;Mouth of Sauron&quot;, taunts the leaders of the army with the personal effects of Frodo and Sam. Battle is joined, but just as it seems the army of Gondor will be overwhelmed, the Ring is destroyed, and the forces of Sauron lose heart. Mount Doom erupts, and Sauron&#x27;s tower, Barad-dûr, collapses, along with the Black Gate. The army of Gondor returns home victorious, the War of the Ring won.

== Context ==

The final battle against Sauron in the War of the Ring, fought at the Morannon, the Black Gate of Mordor. The Army of the West, led by Aragorn, marched on the gate to distract Sauron&#x27;s attention from the hobbits Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee, who were dangerously carrying the One Ring into Mordor. It was hoped that Sauron would think Aragorn had the Ring and was now trying to use it to overthrow Mordor. As the journey progressed, Aragorn was credited openly as &quot;the King Elessar&quot; by their heralds to challenge Sauron.

Aragorn had around 7,000 soldiers of Gondor and Rohan, some 6,000 foot and 1,000 horse. The army included King Éomer of Rohan; Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth; Elladan &amp; Elrohir, the twin sons of Elrond; Beregond, a Guard of the Citadel of Minas Tirith; and five of the eight surviving members of the Fellowship of the Ring (Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli and Pippin).

They were ambushed by Orcs and Easterlings on the very spot where Faramir and the Rangers of Ithilien had ambushed a company of Haradrim some two weeks earlier, but the enemy was beaten back without much loss. Aragorn realized that this was an intentionally weak feint, meant to lure them into thinking that Sauron&#x27;s army was exhausted. Later, some whose fear overcame them were sent to retake and hold the island of Cair Andros. Thus the Army of the West was less than 6,000 strong at the Black Gate.

== Battle ==

The battle took place on 25 March. Before the battle began, Sauron sent the Black Númenórean called the Mouth of Sauron to speak with the Captains of the West. He tried to trick Gandalf into believing Sauron held Frodo captive, displaying as evidence Sam&#x27;s sword, an Elven cloak, and Frodo&#x27;s &quot;mithril&quot; shirt. The Mouth threatened that Frodo would be tortured if the West did not agree to Sauron&#x27;s terms of surrender. Gandalf took the items from the Mouth of Sauron, and dismissed him.

The forces of Sauron advanced and surrounded the Army of the West. Sauron&#x27;s army outnumbered that of the West by at least ten to one. The Army of the West divided itself into two rings upon hills of rubble opposite the gate: Aragorn, Gandalf, and the sons of Elrond &quot;with the Dúnedain about them&quot; were on the left, with Éomer, Imrahil, and the Knights of Dol Amroth on the right. Against them were hordes of Orcs, Trolls, and Men, Easterlings and Haradrim. The Olog-hai, improved versions of Trolls, appeared for the first time. During the battle, the hobbit Pippin Took, marching as a Guard of the Citadel of Minas Tirith, killed a Troll. The surviving Nazgûl hovered over the Army of the West and spread fear and confusion. The giant Eagles of the Misty Mountains, led by Gwaihir the Windlord, attacked the Ringwraiths. 

At that moment, when all hope seemed lost, Frodo put on the One Ring, revealing to Sauron that Frodo was inside Mount Doom, and the Ring was in peril. He immediately summoned the Nazgûl from the battle to intercept Frodo; the army of Mordor, bereft of Sauron&#x27;s attention, was thrown into disarray. Gollum bit the Ring off Frodo&#x27;s finger. As Gollum celebrated, he fell with the ring into the Crack of Doom, destroying Sauron&#x27;s power. The Nazgûl perished. Barad-dûr, the Black Gate and the Towers of the Teeth collapsed as their foundations were built with the power of the Ring. Sauron perished; his gigantic shadow formed in the sky and reached out in wrath, but was blown away and his spirit was left forever bodiless and impotent.

The Orcs and other creatures of Sauron were left directionless with his demise, and were easily defeated by the Army of the West. Some killed themselves, while others fled. The proud Easterlings and Haradrim fought on bravely, though eventually many surrendered, to be sent home in peace by Aragorn as he established the renewed and united Kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor.

The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey writes that Tolkien, a Roman Catholic, comes very close to allegory and writing about Christian revelation in moments of what Tolkien called &quot;eucatastrophe&quot;. When the One Ring is destroyed and Sauron is overthrown for ever, an eagle comes as messenger to report the glad news. The eagle sings a song that, Shippey notes, sounds very much like Psalms 24 and 33 in the Bible, complete with Authorised Version words like &quot;ye&quot; and &quot;hath&quot;. When the eagle sings &quot;and the Black Gate is broken&quot;, Shippey writes, the surface meaning is the Gate of the Morannon, but it could &quot;&quot;very easily&quot; apply to Death and Hell&quot;, as in Matthew 16:18. In his view, this degree of double meaning was &quot;deliberate&quot;, as the date was 25 March, for the Anglo-Saxons the date of Christ&#x27;s Crucifixion, and the Annunciation, and the last day of Creation.

=== Courage ===

The Tolkien critic Paul H. Kocher states that while commentators have noted the &quot;self-sacrificial courage&quot; of the hobbits Frodo and Sam crossing Mordor to destroy the One Ring, far fewer had spoken of the &quot;equal if less solitary unselfish daring&quot; of the 7,000 men who offered battle at the Morannon. Kocher notes that if Frodo and Sam had completed their mission an hour later, the whole army would have been lost, given the &quot;desperate&quot; odds; the hobbits saved the army, but just as much, the army &quot;saved the hobbits and so the West&quot;.

=== 20th century parallels ===

Commentators have drawn parallels between the Mouth of Sauron and notable figures during World War II: Gandalf&#x27;s refusal to negotiate with a mere mouthpiece of Sauron and turning down his master&#x27;s harsh terms of occupation was described as an echo of Winston Churchill by Daniel Timmons, while Shippey compared the Mouth of Sauron&#x27;s offer of peace in exchange for the Army of the West&#x27;s surrender in slavery to Vichy France under Nazi German occupation.

=== Psychological quest ===

Gregory Bassham and Eric Bronson&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit and Philosophy&quot; notes that the hobbit Pippin, who starts out on the quest playful and childish, is radically altered by his experiences, as shown by his killing of a troll in the Battle of the Morannon.

== Adaptations ==

In 1957, Morton Grady Zimmerman and colleagues proposed to Tolkien with a screenplay that they make a film of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; combining animation, miniatures and live action. The final drama of the Battle of the Black Gate was to feature Gandalf&#x27;s turning each of the ringwraiths to stone in front of the watching armies. Tolkien was strongly opposed to their approach and nothing came of it.


Peter Jackson&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;The Return of the King&quot; is interspersed with scenes of Frodo and Sam at Mount Doom, and focuses mainly on the characters of Gandalf, Aragorn, and the rest of the Fellowship. Aragorn fights a troll, a departure from the book; Large numbers of extras were used for the battle, and some hundreds of soldiers from New Zealand&#x27;s army to give an impression of the battle&#x27;s enormous scale. Jackson had at one stage intended Aragorn to fight the Dark Lord Sauron in person, but &quot;wisely&quot; reduced this to combat with a troll.

The Mouth of Sauron appears in the extended edition of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, where he is played by Bruce Spence, though his scenes are cut in the theatrical release. This version of the character has a diseased and disfigured appearance: a helmet covers Spence&#x27;s entire face except the mouth, which is digitally increased to disproportionate size and disfigured by blackened, cracked lips and rotting teeth. According to director&#x27;s commentary bundled with the film&#x27;s extended edition DVD release, the idea behind this visual interpretation is that the repetition of Sauron&#x27;s messages has such an evil effect that it has warped the character&#x27;s body.

<text>Steamboat Creek is a short tributary of the North Umpqua River in southwestern Oregon in the United States. Approximately long, the creek is located on a remote part of the upper North Umpqua in the Calapooia Mountains west of the Cascade Range. It rises in southeastern Lane County at and flows southwest to join the North Umpqua from the north at Steamboat.

The North Umpqua and its tributaries renowned for its prolific runs of summer steelhead, including a high percentage of native fish. Steamboat Creek has been closed to fishing since 1932.

The watershed of the creek was extensively clearcut during the late 1950s and 1960s until forestry practices were changed. The recovery of the river, including the anadromous fish population is closely monitored as a test case for riparian habitat management.

<text>The Pankhurst Centre, 60–62 Nelson Street, Manchester, England, is a pair of Victorian villas, of which No. 62 was the home of Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters Sylvia, Christabel and Adela and the birthplace of the suffragette movement in 1903.

== History ==
62 Nelson Street was the home of Emmeline Pankhurst at the time she founded the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union in 1903. She moved there after the death of her husband, Richard Pankhurst, in 1898.

On 9 June 1974, the site became a Grade II* listed building. In 1978, there was an application submitted to demolish the building, sparking a notable protest to keep the building as a museum and centre committed to women&#x27;s issues.

The parlour was the first room in the Pankhurst Centre to be redecorated and was the centre of attraction when Barbara Castle and Helen Pankhurst opened the centre on 10 October 1987.

The centre would merge with Manchester Women&#x27;s Aid in 2014 to offer women&#x27;s charity services.

The Representation of the People Act 1918 gave the vote to all men aged 21 and over and women aged 30 and over who met certain property qualifications. In its centenary year of 2018, calls were made to fund the Pankhurst Centre to make it a major museum that tells the story of women&#x27;s suffrage and the women&#x27;s rights movement.

The Pankhurst Centre suffered a break-in on 1 October 2019. Since then, donations have been made to repair the damage, including £10,000 from The Co-operative Group.

The centre reopened on 29 August 2021 after a major redevelopment project in the two galleries and the parlour during 2020.

==Description==
The Pankhurst&#x27;s villas now form a centre that is a women-only space which creates a unique environment for women to learn together, work on projects and socialise.

Part of the centre is a museum, The Pankhurst Parlour, which has become a memorial to the suffragette movement. Its Edwardian style furnishings evoke the home of Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters. It is the only museum dedicated to telling the story of women&#x27;s fight for the right to vote.

The Pankhurst Centre is run by volunteers and receives no public funding, relying solely on donations. 

== Pankhurst Centre Garden ==
In September 2018, a newly designed garden by Janet Leigh (a garden designer based in Stockport), was opened at the Pankhurst Centre. The garden marks the centenary of Votes for Women, and acknowledges the work of suffragettes. The garden was funded by an outsourcing campaign, with over 500 people contributing over £24,000 in 2017. The garden also provides a relaxation space for the women and children residents of Manchester Women&#x27;s Aid.

<doc id="767026" wikidata="Q1511266" url="?curid=767026" title="We've Come for You All">
<text>We&#x27;ve Come for You All is the ninth studio album by American heavy metal band Anthrax. It was released on May 6, 2003 through Nuclear Blast in Europe and Sanctuary Records in North America. This was the first Anthrax record to feature Rob Caggiano on lead guitar and their last studio album with John Bush on vocals. The album was recorded over a one-year span at the BearTracks Recording Studio in Suffern, New York. The cover art was designed by comic book artist Alex Ross, while the production was handled by Scrap 60 Productions team. The Who vocalist Roger Daltrey and Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell made guest appearances on the album.

The album received positive reviews by contemporary music critics, with About.com crediting it for &quot;getting the band back on track&quot;. Despite this, the album only reached number 122 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with first week sales of 10,000 copies. To date, &quot;We&#x27;ve Come for You All&quot; has sold over 62,000 copies in the United States. It was nominated for Outstanding Hard Rock Album at the 2004 California Music Awards, but lost to Blink 182&#x27;s untitled album.

==Background and recording==
This album followed &quot;Volume 8: The Threat Is Real&quot;, which was released in 1998. Anthrax decided to sign with record label Nuclear Blast for the release of their upcoming album. Asked if changing the record company will affect the songwriting, guitarist Scott Ian replied: &quot;To be honest, I don&#x27;t care about that at all. You know, business is business and the creative side is the creative side. Creatively, there was no big challenge. We just wanted to try to make the best record we can.&quot;

The band started writing new material during the months of May and June 2001, and entered the studio in November the same year. The recording process was shortly interrupted because the band went on a tour with Judas Priest early in 2002. They returned to the studio in March and in the next few months worked on the record and successfully finished it. According to Ian, the whole process of making the album took the band a year. Ian also said that there is no leftover material out of the recording sessions, except for the song &quot;Ghost&quot;, which was released as a B-side on the single &quot;Taking the Music Back&quot;. The Who vocalist Roger Daltrey and Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell made guest appearances on the album, as well as E-Town Concrete vocalist Anthony Martini. Daltrey was featured in the song &quot;Taking the Music Back&quot;, Martini provided vocals on “Refuse to be Denied”, while Darrell contributed to the songs &quot;Cadillac Rock Box&quot; and &quot;Strap It On&quot;. The band explained their appearances by saying they &quot;felt the need to invite some friends to make something special for the album and the result is simply fantastic.&quot;

The album was produced by Scrap 60 Productions team, consisted of Anthrax guitarist Rob Caggiano, Eddie Wohl, and Steve Regina. The front cover was designed by comic book artist Alex Ross. Vocalist John Bush stated that the band was honored to work with Ross, who also did the artwork for their previous pair of recordings. Bush explained that the band gave Ross a complete freedom over the concept of the artwork. Apart from suggesting the album&#x27;s title as an idea, Bush said that the other members had not participated much in creating the cover art.

==Release==
The release date of the album was delayed several times. The album was originally set for a release on February 4, 2003 in Europe and Japan, and on February 24 in the US and Canada. After the prolongation of the release date for territories outside Japan and Europe, drummer Charlie Benante posted an explanation on the band&#x27;s official website: &quot;I hate to tell you this but ... the record got pushed back to April 15. It&#x27;s only been 73 years since &quot;Vol. 8&quot; [was released], what&#x27;s another week or two? The record company needed the extra time to put more time into the promotion. One day all this crap will be over, you&#x27;ll be rocking out to some killer shit.&quot; It was later announced that the release date for Europe would be also pushed back to March 3, 2003, eventually setting it on May 6. The problems occurred after a breakdown in negotiations between Beyond Records and Sanctuary Records over a buy-out of the band&#x27;s contract. According to Blabbermouth, Beyond Records was in the process of selling their entire catalog to Sanctuary, but the arrangement had fallen through. However, the problems were resolved and the record was successfully distributed through Sanctuary in North America and Nuclear Blast in Europe.

The album debuted at No. 122 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart with first week sales of just under 10,000 units. Since its release in May 2003, &quot;We&#x27;ve Come for You All&quot; sold about 62,000 copies in the United States. Apart from entering the French Albums Chart at number 95, the record did not manage to chart in any other country. Referring to the low record sales, Ian posted a message on the band&#x27;s official web site saying: &quot;That&#x27;s more than I thought it would do after five years away. That&#x27;s basically what [the group&#x27;s last album] &quot;Volume 8&quot; did in its first week and this one was based on mostly just Internet promo.&quot;

==Composition==
Bush opined that this record wasn&#x27;t very different from their previous releases. &quot;It&#x27;s still an Anthrax album with many different parts that can appeal to a wide audience. Our sound is recognizable each time you listen to one of our songs and that&#x27;s something we really want for our music. You have the fastest rhythms, the more danceable ones, you have everything you can expect from an Anthrax record.&quot; Benante said that elements from their earlier albums are still present on the record, though it explores &quot;other territories&quot;.

Johnny Loftus from AllMusic described the music as a strained fusion of thrash and traditional heavy metal, accompanied by the harsh vocals of Bush. He noted the record for using modern production techniques, as well as displaying melodies and instrumentation that have always been Anthrax&#x27;s trademark. Magazine &quot;Rock Hard&quot; observed that the record was a combination of &quot;tradition and modernity&quot;, with strong vocals and &quot;thrashy&quot; tunes. They pointed that the sound was extremely complex with &quot;super fat&quot; production, having nothing similar with the nu metal sound of the early 2000s. &quot;Exclaim!&quot; wrote that the songs had rock-based structures, unlike the band&#x27;s earlier releases which featured &quot;brutal beats and razor riffs&quot;. Gregory Bradley also noted that a couple of songs had &quot;distinct hard-rock vibe&quot;, while others demonstrated &quot;very metal&quot; sound. In their guide to Anthrax discography, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; wrote that &quot;We&#x27;ve Come for You All&quot; was &quot;leaning towards a groove-orientated hard rock sound&quot; with several slower and radio friendly efforts.

==Critical reception==
&quot;We&#x27;ve Come for You All&quot; received positive reviews upon release, with About.com crediting it for &quot;getting the band back on track&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Johnny Loftus noted the album for its &quot;pile-driving thrash&quot; sound, which reminded him of the group&#x27;s earlier days. Loftus concluded that &quot;We&#x27;ve Come for You All&quot; was the definitive thrash metal album, released in a period when albums from that genre were not common. In a review for Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Harry Guerin wrote that the band has preserved their sense of melody and aggression. He praised the fast blast beat percussion on &quot;Black Dahlia&quot;, and finished the review by saying that the album would likely exceed the expectations of their most devoted fans.

Writing for &quot;Metal Review&quot;, Gregory Bradley stopped short of calling the album a return to form, but asserted that the record was an &quot;acceptable&quot; release. Bradley did, however, credit the album for having some &quot;very metal&quot; songs, singling out &quot;What Doesn&#x27;t Die&quot; and &quot;Black Dahlia&quot; in particular. Chris Ayers from &quot;Exclaim!&quot; opined that &quot;We&#x27;ve Come for You All&quot; was the band&#x27;s strongest release since &quot;Sound of White Noise&quot; (1993) and easily the best of the John Bush era: &quot;Grittier and more confident, the self-produced &quot;We&#x27;ve Come for You All&quot; is a certified classic that proves the ageless Anthrax are still a viable metal option.&quot; Vik Bansal, of MusicOMH, summarized the album as &quot;a bold, sleek and raucous slab of modern metal&quot;, containing elements that were absent from many heavy metal albums at the time. Bansal cited &quot;What Doesn&#x27;t Die&quot; for particular praise, noting the &quot;razor-sharp&quot; riffs on the song. He noted &quot;Cadillac Rock Box&quot; for sounding similar to bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd and Black Sabbath. Bansal summed up his review by stating that &quot;We&#x27;ve Come for You All&quot; is a &quot;mighty album from a still mighty band&quot;.

==First Constitution of Ohio (1803–1851)==

Under the first constitution, joint sessions of the legislature elected judges to seven-year terms. Elections were generally in January, with judges seated in February. The state had three or four judges through this period.

==Second Constitution of Ohio (1851–1912)==

Under the second constitution, five judges were elected to five-year terms, with one seat elected each autumn. The first election was autumn of 1851, with the top five candidates assigned terms by lot. Chief Justice was not voted separately, but chosen by other means. Change of law added a sixth judge for the 1892 election, with term starting February 1893, and terms were increased to six years. No elections were held in 1906 or 1907, when the state transitioned to electing two judges each in even numbered years and terms of sitting judges were extended to fit the new schedule.

<doc id="767065" wikidata="Q7284501" url="?curid=767065" title="Rain fade">
<text>Rain fade refers primarily to the absorption of a microwave radio frequency (RF) signal by atmospheric rain, snow, or ice, and losses which are especially prevalent at frequencies above 11 GHz. It also refers to the degradation of a signal caused by the electromagnetic interference of the leading edge of a storm front. Rain fade can be caused by precipitation at the uplink or downlink location. It does not need to be raining at a location for it to be affected by rain fade, as the signal may pass through precipitation many miles away, especially if the satellite dish has a low look angle. From 5% to 20% of rain fade or satellite signal attenuation may also be caused by rain, snow, or ice on the uplink or downlink antenna reflector, radome, or feed horn. Rain fade is not limited to satellite uplinks or downlinks, as it can also affect terrestrial point-to-point microwave links (those on the Earth&#x27;s surface).

Rain fade is usually estimated experimentally and also can be calculated theoretically using scattering theory of raindrops. Raindrop size distribution (DSD) is an important consideration for studying rain fade characteristics. Various mathematical forms such as Gamma function, lognormal or exponential forms are usually used to model the DSD. Mie or Rayleigh scattering theory with point matching or t-matrix approach is used to calculate the scattering cross section, and specific rain attenuation. Since rain is a non-homogeneous process in both time and space, specific attenuation varies with location, time and rain type.

Total rain attenuation is also dependent upon the spatial structure of rain field. Horizontal, as well as vertical, extension of rain again varies for different rain type and location. Limit of the vertical rain region is usually assumed to coincide with 0˚ isotherm and called rain height. Melting layer height is also used as the limits of rain region and can be estimated from the bright band signature of radar reflectivity. The horizontal rain structure is assumed to have a cellular form, called rain cell. Rain cell sizes can vary from a few hundred meters to several kilometers and dependent upon the rain type and location. Existence of very small size rain cells are recently observed in tropical rain.

The rain attenuation on satellite communication can be predicted using rain attenuation prediction models which lead to a suitable selection of the Fade Mitigation Technique (FMT). The rain attenuation prediction models require rainfall rate data which, in turn, can be obtained from in either the prediction rainfall maps, which may reflect inaccurate rain performance prediction, or by actual measured rainfall data that gives more accurate prediction and hence the appropriate selection of FMT. Substantially, the earth altitude above the sea level is an essential factor affecting the rain attenuation performance. The satellite system designers and channel providers should account for the rain impairments at their channel setup.

Possible ways to overcome the effects of rain fade are site diversity, uplink power control, variable rate encoding, and receiving antennas larger than the requested size for normal weather conditions.

== Uplink power control ==

The simplest way to compensate the rain fade effect in satellite communications is to increase the transmission power: this dynamic fade countermeasure is called uplink power control (UPC). Until more recently, uplink power control had limited use, since it required more powerful transmitters – ones that could normally run at lower levels and could be increased in power level on command (i.e. automatically). Also uplink power control could not provide very large signal margins without compressing the transmitting amplifier. Modern amplifiers coupled with advanced uplink power control systems that offer automatic controls to prevent transponder saturation make uplink power control systems an effective, affordable and easy solution to rain fade in satellite signals.

== Parallel fail-over links ==

In terrestrial point to point microwave systems ranging from 11 GHz to 80 GHz, a parallel backup link can be installed alongside a rain fade prone higher bandwidth connection. In this arrangement, a primary link such as an 80 GHz 1 Gbit/s full duplex microwave bridge may be calculated to have a 99.9% availability rate over the period of one year. The calculated 99.9% availability rate means that the link may be down for a cumulative total of ten or more hours per year as the peaks of rain storms pass over the area. A secondary lower bandwidth link such as a 5.8 GHz based 100 Mbit/s bridge may be installed parallel to the primary link, with routers on both ends controlling automatic failover to the 100 Mbit/s bridge when the primary 1 Gbit/s link is down due to rain fade. Using this arrangement, high frequency point to point links (23 GHz+) may be installed to service locations many kilometers farther than could be served with a single link requiring 99.99% uptime over the course of one year.

== CCIR interpolation formula ==
It is possible to extrapolate the cumulative attenuation distribution at a given location by using
the CCIR interpolation formula:

: &quot;A&quot;&quot;p&quot; = &quot;A&quot;001 0.12 &quot;p&quot;−(0.546 − 0.0043 log10 &quot;p&quot;).

where &quot;A&quot;&quot;p&quot; is the attenuation in dB exceeded for a &quot;p&quot; percentage of the time and &quot;A&quot;001 is the attenuation exceeded for 0.01% of the time.

== ITU-R frequency scaling formula ==
According to the ITU-R, rain attenuation statistics can be scaled in frequency in the range 7 to 55 GHz by the formula

:formula_1

where

:formula_2

and &quot;f&quot; is the frequency in GHz.

<doc id="767067" wikidata="Q521863" url="?curid=767067" title="Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome">
<text>Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome (; abbreviated BWS) is an overgrowth disorder usually present at birth, characterized by an increased risk of childhood cancer and certain congenital features. A minority (&lt;15%) of cases of BWS are familial, meaning that a close relative may also have BWS, and parents of an affected child may be at increased risk of having other children with BWS. While children with BWS are at increased risk of childhood cancer, most children with BWS do not develop cancer and the vast majority of children who do develop cancer can be treated successfully.

==Presentation==
No consensus clinical diagnostic criteria for Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) exist. Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) &quot;should be suspected&quot; in individuals who have one or more of the following major and/or minor findings.

&quot;Major findings associated with BWS&quot;
* Macrosomia (traditionally defined as weight and length/height &gt;97th centile)
* Macroglossia
* Hemihyperplasia (asymmetric overgrowth of one or more regions of the body)
* Omphalocele (also called exomphalos) or umbilical hernia
* Embryonal tumor (e.g., Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma) in childhood
* Visceromegaly involving one or more intra-abdominal organs including liver, spleen, kidneys, adrenal glands, and/or pancreas
* Cytomegaly of the fetal adrenal cortex (pathognomonic)
* Renal abnormalities including structural abnormalities, nephromegaly, nephrocalcinosis, and/or later development of medullary sponge kidney
* Anterior linear ear lobe creases and/or posterior helical ear pits
* Placental mesenchymal dysplasia
* Cleft palate (rare in BWS)
* Cardiomyopathy (rare in BWS)
* Positive family history (≥1 family members with a clinical diagnosis of BWS or a history or features suggestive of BWS)
* Congenital hyperinsulinism

&quot;Minor findings associated with BWS&quot;
* Pregnancy-related findings including polyhydramnios and prematurity in fetuses with the condition.
* Neonatal hypoglycemia
* Vascular lesions including nevus simplex (typically appearing on the forehead, glabella, and/or back of the neck) or hemangiomas (cutaneous or extracutaneous)
* Characteristic facies including midface retrusion and infraorbital creases
* Structural cardiac anomalies or cardiomegaly
* Diastasis recti
* Advanced bone age (common in overgrowth/endocrine disorders)

&quot;The diagnosis of BWS is established&quot; in a proband with either of the following:
* Three major or two major plus at least one minor criteria (BWS should be considered a clinical spectrum, with some affected individuals having only one or two suggestive clinical findings. Therefore, the generally accepted clinical criteria proposed here should not be viewed as absolute but rather as guidelines. In other words, they cannot be used to rule out a diagnosis of BWS and cannot substitute for clinical judgment.)
* An epigenetic or genomic alteration leading to abnormal methylation at 11p15.5 or a heterozygous BWS-causing pathogenic variant in CDKN1C in the presence of one or more clinical findings

Most children with BWS do not have all of these features. In addition, some children with BWS have other findings including: nevus flammeus, prominent occiput, midface hypoplasia, hemihypertrophy, genitourinary anomalies (enlarged kidneys), cardiac anomalies, musculoskeletal abnormalities, and hearing loss. Also, some premature newborns with BWS do not have macroglossia until closer to their anticipated delivery date.

Given the variation among individuals with BWS and the lack of a simple diagnostic test, identifying BWS can be difficult. In an attempt to standardize the classification of BWS, DeBaun et al. have defined a child as having BWS if the child has been diagnosed by a physician as having BWS and if the child has at least two of the five common features associated with BWS (macroglossia, macrosomia, midline abdominal wall defects, ear creases, neonatal hypoglycemia). Another definition presented by Elliot et al. includes the presence of either three major features (anterior abdominal wall defect, macroglossia, or prepostnatal overgrowth) or two major plus three minor findings (ear creases, nevus flammeus, neonatal hypoglycemia, nephromegaly, or hemihyperplasia).

In general, children with BWS do very well and grow up to become adults of normal size and intelligence, usually without the syndromic features of their childhood.

===Neoplasms===

Most children (&gt;80%) with BWS do not develop cancer; however, children with BWS are much more likely (~600 times more) than other children to develop certain childhood cancers, particularly Wilms&#x27; tumor (nephroblastoma), pancreatoblastoma, and hepatoblastoma. Individuals with BWS appear to only be at increased risk for cancer during childhood (especially before age four) and do not have an increased risk of developing cancer in adulthood. If 100 children with BWS were followed from birth until age ten, about 10 cases of cancer would be expected in the group before age four, and about 1 case of cancer in the group would be expected between age four and ten.
In addition to Wilms tumor and hepatoblastoma, children with BWS have been shown in individual case reports to develop ganglioneuroma, adrenocortical carcinoma, acute lymphoid leukemia, liver sarcoma, thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and mesoblastic nephroma.

Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, and mesoblastic nephroma can usually be cured if diagnosed early. Early diagnosis allows physicians to treat the cancer when it is at an early stage. In addition, there is less toxic treatment. Given the importance of early diagnosis, all children with BWS should be offered cancer screening.

An abdominal ultrasound every 3 months until at least eight years of age is recommended and a blood test to measure alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) every 6 weeks until at least four years of age. Families and physicians should determine screening schedules for specific patients, especially the age at which to discontinue screening, based upon their own evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio.

==Genetics==
Most (&gt;85%) cases of BWS are sporadic, meaning that, typically, no one else in that family has BWS, and parents of an affected child are not at increased risk of having other children with BWS. However, some (&lt;15%) cases of BWS are familial, meaning that a close relative may also have BWS, and parents of an affected child may be at increased risk of having other children with BWS. BWS has been shown to specifically involve mutations in a defined region on the short arm of chromosome 11 referred to as 11p15.5, that leads to overactivity of the IGF-2 gene (growth factor) and/or no active copy of CDKN1C (inhibitor of cell proliferation gene).

BWS can be caused by a range of different genetic defects. Over five distinct errors involving 11p15.5 have been identified in different BWS patients. Some patients have maternal chromosomal rearrangements of 11p15.5. Other patients have paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 11, meaning that the maternal copy of this chromosome is replaced with an extra paternal copy. Many other patients have abnormal DNA methylation in different areas of 11p15.5, meaning that normal epigenetic marks that regulate imprinted genes in this region are altered. A few other patients have a single gene copy located within 11p15, instead of two copies.

The absence of a mutation in a child with clinical findings suggestive of BWS should not preclude a diagnosis of BWS. Even after extensive molecular testing, the specific defect causing BWS in an affected individual may remain unknown. BWS remains a clinical, rather than genetic, diagnosis, since physicians cannot identify and test for all the genetic causes of BWS. The clinical definition used for BWS is limited, because no standard diagnostic criteria exist that have been independently verified with patients who have either genetic or epigenetic mutations. When molecular analyses were completed in 10 children who met a research criterion for BWS, only 7 of the 10 children had genetic or epigenetic mutations.

Given that the genetics of BWS are complex, a child with BWS should be offered the medical care of a geneticist or an expert in the management of BWS.

Genes involved are IGF-2, CDKN1C, H19, and KCNQ1OT1.

=== Association with CDKN1C ===

CDKN1C is a protein-coding gene that encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that acts as a negative regulator of cell proliferation, effectively making CDKN1C a tumor suppressor gene. CDKN1C also works during fetal development, preventing the fetus from becoming too large. It is located on the short arm of the human chromosome 11 in the ICR2 region, along with many other imprinted genes. Since CDKN1C is preferentially maternally expressed, hypomethylation in the ICR2 region of the maternal allele can result in pathologies such as cancer or a defect known as Beckwith-Weidemann Syndrome. Beckwith-Weidemann Syndrome (BWS) may also be brought about by CDKN1C 11p15 epimutations. It may also be a result of deletions of small amounts of DNA that cause chromosomal abnormalities, rendering the gene inactive. This leaves only the paternally expressed IGF2 to promote cell proliferation. The reduction of growth restriction results in the overgrowth of many tissues, leading to the common symptoms of BWS. These symptoms may include macroglossia, organomegaly, periorbital fullness, and hernias. Knockout models for CDKN1C in mice do exist; in fact, many of the affected offspring exhibit fetal and neonatal lethality and have most of the features related to Beckwith-Weidemann Syndrome.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is usually clinical and lab inclined. If the clinical features commonly associated with this syndrome are identified a confirmatory histological investigation is done.

==Management==
Abdominal wall defects are common in newborns with BWS and may require surgical treatment. These defects can range in severity from omphalocele (most serious) to umbilical hernia and diastasis recti (least serious). An &quot;omphalocele&quot; is a congenital malformation in which a newborn&#x27;s intestines, and sometimes other abdominal organs, protrude out of the abdomen through the umbilicus. Newborns with an omphalocele typically require surgery to place the abdominal contents back into the abdomen in order to prevent serious infection or shock. An &quot;umbilical hernia&quot; is also a defect in which abdominal contents come through weak abdominal wall muscle at the umbilicus. In general, newborns with umbilical hernias do not require treatment because often these hernias spontaneously close by age four. If, after this time, a hernia is still present, surgery may be recommended. &quot;Diastasis recti&quot; is a separation of the left and right sides of the rectus abdominis muscle that are normally joined. Children with diastasis recti usually require no treatment because the condition resolves as the child grows.

Neonatal hypoglycemia, low blood glucose in the first month of life, occurs in about half of children with BWS. Most of these hypoglycemic newborns are asymptomatic and have a normal blood glucose level within days. However, untreated persistent hypoglycemia can lead to permanent brain damage. Hypoglycemia in newborns with BWS should be managed according to standard protocols for treating neonatal hypoglycemia. Usually this hypoglycemia can easily be treated with more frequent feedings or medical doses of glucose. Rarely (&lt;5%) children with BWS will continue to have hypoglycemia after the neonatal period and require more intensive treatment. Such children may require tube feedings, oral hyperglycemic medicines, or a partial pancreatectomy.

Macroglossia, a large tongue, is a very common (&gt;90%) and prominent feature of BWS. Infants with BWS and macroglossia typically cannot fully close their mouth in front of their large tongue, causing it to protrude out. Macroglossia in BWS becomes less noticeable with age and often requires no treatment; but it does cause problems for some children with BWS. In severe cases, macroglossia can cause respiratory, feeding, and speech difficulties. Children with BWS and significant macroglossia should be evaluated by a craniofacial team.

The best time to perform surgery for a large tongue is not known. Some surgeons recommend performing the surgery between 3 and 6 months of age. Surgery for macroglossia involves removing a small part of the tongue so that it fits within the mouth to allow for proper jaw and tooth development.

These children are often managed by a multidisciplinary craniofacial team. These teams include speech and language therapists, craniofacial and paediatric plastic surgeons, and orthodontists who decide the appropriateness and timing of tongue reduction surgery. Some countries have designated centres for the management of macroglossia. For example, in the United Kingdom, children who have macroglossia associated with Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome are managed in a national specialised service. The service is commissioned as highly specialised service by NHS England and is located at Great Ormond Street Hospital.

Nevus flammeus (port-wine stain) is a flat, red birthmark caused by a capillary (small blood vessel) malformation. Children with BWS often have nevus flammeus on their forehead or the back of their neck. Nevus flammeus is benign and commonly does not require any treatment.

Hemihypertrophy (hemihyperplasia) is an abnormal asymmetry between the left and right sides of the body occurring when one part of the body grows faster than normal. Children with BWS and hemihypertrophy can have an isolated asymmetry of one body part, or they can have a difference affecting the entire one side of the body. Individuals who do not have BWS can also have hemihypertrophy. Isolated hemihypertrophy is associated with a higher risk for cancer. The types of cancer and age of the cancers are similar to children with BWS. As a result, children with hemihypertrophy should follow the general cancer screening protocol for BWS.

Hemihypertrophy can also cause various orthopedic problems, so children with significant limb hemihyperplasia should be evaluated and followed by an orthopedic surgeon.

Hemihyperplasia affecting the face can sometimes cause significant cosmetic concerns that may be addressed by a cranial facial team.

==Prognosis==
In general, the prognosis is very good. Children with BWS usually do very well and grow up to become the heights expected based on their parents&#x27; heights. While they are at increased risk of childhood cancer, most of them do not develop the disease, and the vast majority of the children who do can be treated successfully.

Children with BWS for the most part had no significant delays when compared to their siblings. However, some of them do have speech problems that could be related to macroglossia or hearing loss.

Advances in treating neonatal complications and premature infants in the last twenty years have significantly improved the true infant mortality rate associated with BWS. In a review of pregnancies that resulted in 304 children with BWS, no neonatal deaths were reported. This is compared to a previously reported mortality rate of 20%. The data from the former study was derived from a BWS registry, a database that may be slightly biased towards involving living children; however, death was not an exclusion criterion to join the registry. This suggests that while infants with BWS are likely to have a higher than normal infant mortality risk, it may not be as high as 20%.

== Assisted reproductive technology ==

Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is a general term referring to methods used to achieve pregnancy by artificial or partially artificial means. According to the CDC, in general, ART procedures involve surgically removing eggs from a woman&#x27;s ovaries, combining them with sperm in the laboratory, and returning them to the woman&#x27;s body or donating them to another woman. ART has been associated with epigenetic syndromes, specifically BWS and Angelman syndrome. Three groups have shown an increased rate of ART conception in children with BWS. A retrospective case control study from Australia found a 1 in 4000 risk of BWS in their in-vitro population, several times higher than the general population. Another study found that children conceived by in vitro fertilisation (IVF) are three to four times more likely to develop the condition. No specific type of ART has been more closely associated with BWS. The mechanism by which ART produces this effect is still under investigation.

== Epidemiology ==

Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome has an estimated incidence of one in 13,700; about 300 children with BWS are born each year in the United States. The exact incidence of BWS is unknown because of the marked variability in the syndrome&#x27;s presentation and difficulties with diagnosis. The number of reported infants born with BWS is most likely low because many are born with BWS, but have clinical features that are less prominent and therefore missed. BWS has been documented in a variety of ethnic groups and occurs equally in males and females.

Children conceived through in vitro fertilization have a three to fourfold increased chance of developing Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome. It is thought that this is due to genes being turned on or off by the IVF procedures.

==History==
In the 1960s, Dr. John Bruce Beckwith, an American pathologist and Dr. Hans-Rudolf Wiedemann, a German pediatrician, independently reported cases of a proposed new syndrome. Originally termed EMG syndrome (for &quot;exomphalos&quot;, &quot;macroglossia&quot;, and &quot;gigantism&quot;), this syndrome over time became known as Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome or Wiedemann Beckwith syndrome.

Originally, Dr. Hans-Rudolf Wiedemann (born 16 February 1915, Bremen, Germany, died 4 August 2006, Kiel) coined the term exomphalos-macroglossia-gigantism (EMG) syndrome to describe the combination of congenital abdominal wall defects as hernia (exomphalos), large tongues (macroglossia), and large bodies and/or long limbs (gigantism). Over time, this constellation was renamed Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome following the autoptical observations of Prof. John Bruce Beckwith (born 18 September 1933, Spokane, Washington), who also observed a severe increase in the size of the adrenal glands in some of these patients.

<text>United States Senate elections in Ohio occur when voters in the U.S. state of Ohio select an individual to represent the state in the United States Senate in either of the state&#x27;s two seats allotted by the Constitution. Regularly scheduled general elections occur on Election Day, coinciding with various other federal, statewide, and local races.

Each state is allotted two U.S. Senators elected to staggered six-year terms, which were originally selected by the state legislature. The Senate is divided into three classes to stagger the terms of its members such that one-third of the Senate would be up for re-election every two years. Upon Ohio&#x27;s admission to the Union in 1803, the state was assigned a Class 1 seat and a Class 3 seat, first elected in 1803. Since the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, U.S. Senators are elected directly by the voters of each state. Special elections may be held to fill mid-term vacancies to elect an individual to serve the remainder of the unexpired term.

The list below contains results from all U.S. Senate elections held in Ohio after the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment, sorted by year. The next scheduled election for the Class 1 seat is in 2030, while the Class 3 seat will hold its next election in 2026.

<text>Maryknoll School is a private, coeducational Catholic school serving children in kindergarten through twelfth grade in Honolulu, Hawaii. The school is located on the island of Oahu and is administered by the Diocese of Honolulu in association with its original founders, the Maryknoll Society of brothers and priests and the Maryknoll Congregation also called the Maryknoll Sisters. The school is the largest Catholic School in the state of Hawaii, and the fifth largest private school in the state. Maryknoll has developed 6 sister schools and 5 affiliated school connections, in China, Japan, and Vietnam.

The school started out as a one-story wood-frame building containing four classrooms. It was blessed and dedicated in 1927 and opened with a student body of 93 boys and 77 girls in the lower grade levels. The six Maryknoll Sisters, who had arrived from New York just four days before opening day, comprised the first faculty.

In 1931, the Maryknoll Sisters expanded the school to accommodate older students; in 1935, Maryknoll School graduated its first class. As of the 2017 - 2018 school year, Maryknoll School has a student body of nearly 1,100 students.

<text>Thomas Kirk (1765–1797) was an English artist, book illustrator, and engraver of the late 18th century.

A pupil of Richard Cosway, Kirk exhibited the first of 25 works at the Royal Academy in 1785. 
Although he illustrated James Thomson&#x27;s &quot;The Seasons&quot; in 1793, he was employed most consistently by Charles Cooke for his editions of celebrated works of literature. &quot;Cooke&#x27;s Pocket Edition of English Poets&quot; (1796-8) was especially popular. Kirk&#x27;s illustrations impressed many of his contemporaries. Edward Dayes said of him: &#x27;He passed like a meteor through the region of art&#x27;. 

He created many famous engravings based either upon his own work or works by, amongst others, Angelica Kauffman, Richard Westall, and Sir Joshua Reynolds.
After his death appeared &quot;Outlines from the figures and compositions upon the Greek, Roman, and Etruscan vases of the late Sir William Hamilton : with engraved borders / drawn and engraved by the late Mr. Kirk&quot;.

Original drawings by him are rare, often in oval format, and owe much to the influence of Kauffman. The draughtsmanship is of the highest quality and some his pictures are described as &#x27;ornamented&#x27; by R. W. Satchwell, who occasionally drew the surrounds.

His promising career was cut short by illness. Working to the end, he died in 1797 of consumption (i.e. tuberculosis), having exhibited his final works at the Royal Academy (&quot;Evening&quot; and &quot;A Dream&quot;) the previous year. His last known address was 8 Judd Place West, New Road (renamed Euston Road in 1857), London.

<doc id="767078" wikidata="Q1537534" url="?curid=767078" title="Vaginoplasty">
<text>Vaginoplasty is any surgical procedure that results in the construction or reconstruction of the vagina. It is a type of genitoplasty. Pelvic organ prolapse is often treated with one or more surgeries to repair the vagina. Sometimes a vaginoplasty is needed following the treatment or removal of malignant growths or abscesses to restore a normal vaginal structure and function. Surgery to the vagina is done to correct congenital defects to the vagina, urethra and rectum. It may correct protrusion of the urinary bladder into the vagina (cystocele) and protrusion of the rectum (rectocele) into the vagina. Often, a vaginoplasty is performed to repair the vagina and its attached structures due to trauma or injury.

Congenital disorders such as adrenal hyperplasia can affect the structure and function of the vagina and sometimes the vagina is absent; these can be reconstructed or formed, using a vaginoplasty. Other candidates for the surgery include babies born with a microphallus, people with Müllerian agenesis resulting in vaginal hypoplasia, trans women, and women who have had a vaginectomy after malignancy or trauma.
==Medical uses==
Vaginoplasty is the description of the following surgical interventions:

* separation of congenitally fused urethra and vagina
* repair of a urethra that is short
* vaginal construction
* vaginal reconstruction
* vaginal vault prolapse
* vaginal suspension and fixation
* operations on recto-uterine pouch
* repair of cystoceleand rectocele
* retropubic paravaginal repair
* the repair of a cystocele using a graft or prosthesis
* the repair of a cystocele and a rectocele in the same procedure using a graft or prosthetic device
* the repair of a rectocele using a graft or prosthetic material
* the vaginal construction using a graft or prosthetic material
* the vaginal reconstruction using a graft or prosthetic material
* the vaginal suspension and stabilization using with graft or prosthetic material
* treatment of MRKH syndrome (vaginal agenesis)
* hymenorrhaphy

In some instances, extra tissue is needed to reconstruct or construct the vagina. These grafts used in vaginoplasty can be an allotransplantation, a heterograft, or an autologous material. A woman can use an autologous in vitro cultured tissue taken from her vaginal vestibule as transplanted tissue to form the lining of the reconstructed vagina. A reconstructed or newly constructed vagina is called a neovagina.

===Vaginoplasties in children===

Conditions such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia virilize genetic females due to a 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Specific procedures include: clitoral reduction, labiaplasty, normalizing appearance, vagina creation, initiating vaginal dilation. Vaginal atresia, or congenital absence of the vagina, can be another reason for surgery to construct a normal and functional vagina. Vaginoplasty is used as part of the series of surgeries needed to treat those girls and women born with the bladder located outside of their abdomen. After the repairs, women have been able to give birth but are at risk of prolapse.

There are human rights concerns about vaginoplasties and other genital surgeries in children who are not old enough to consent, including concern with post-surgical sexual function, and assumptions of cisnormativity. There is no consensus attitude among clinicians about their necessity, timing, method or evaluation. Vaginoplasties may be performed in children or adolescents with intersex conditions or disorders of sex development.

==Techniques==
Non-surgical vagina creation was used in the past to treat the congenital absence of a vagina. The procedure involved the wearing of a saddle-like device and the use of increasing-diameter dilators. The procedure took several months and was sometimes painful. It was not effective in every instance. Uncommon growths, cysts, septums in the vagina can also require vaginoplasty.

===Reconstructive surgery after cancer treatment===
Radiological cancer treatment can result in the destruction or alteration of vaginal tissues. Vaginoplasty is often performed to reconstruct the vagina and other genital structures. In some cases, normal sexual function can be restored.

===McIndoe surgical technique===
A canal is surgically constructed between the urinary bladder and urethra in the anterior portion of the pelvic region and the rectum. A skin graft is used from another area of the person&#x27;s body. The graft is removed from the thigh, buttocks, or inguinal region. Other materials have been used to create the lining of the new vagina. These have been cutaneous skin flaps, amniotic membranes, and buccal mucosa.

===Gender-affirming surgery===
Several techniques may be used in gender-affirming surgery to create a neovagina.

====Penile inversion====
Inversion of the penile skin is the method most often selected to create a neovagina by surgeons performing gender-affirming surgery. The inverted penile skin uses inferior pedicle skin or abdominal skin for the lining of the neovagina. The skin is cut to form an appropriate-sized flap. The skin flap is sometimes combined with a scrotal or urethral flap.

The penile inversion technique was pioneered by Georges Burou in his Morocco clinic in the 1950s. By the 1970s he had performed hundreds of them, and gave his first public presentation of his technique to a conference at Stanford University in 1973, after which it gradually became the predominant technique worldwide.

====Bowel vaginoplasty====

====Peritoneal vaginoplasty====

====Other methods====
Penile-scrotal skin flaps are also used. Nongenital full-thickness graft (FTG) or split-thickness skin grafts from other parts of the body have been used.

===Elective vaginoplasty===
Critics have labeled such surgery as the &quot;designer vagina&quot;. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued a warning against these procedures in 2007 as did the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and a commentary in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; strongly criticized the &quot;designer vagina&quot; in 2009. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada published a policy statement against elective vaginoplasty based upon the risks associated with unnecessary cosmetic surgery in 2013.

The World Health Organization describes any medically unnecessary surgery to the vaginal tissue and organs as female genital mutilation.

Vaginal rejuvenation is a form of elective plastic surgery. Its purpose is to restore or enhance the vagina&#x27;s cosmetic appearance.

===Hymen surgical procedures===

An imperforate hymen is the presence of tissue that completely covers the vaginal opening. It is cut to allow menstrual flow to exit during a short surgical procedure. A hymenorrhaphy is the surgical procedure that reconstructs the hymen.

===Balloon vaginoplasty===
In this procedure, a Foley catheter is laparoscopically inserted to the rectouterine pouch whereupon gradual traction and distension are applied to create a neovagina.

===Pull through or Vecchietti procedure===
In treating Müllerian agenesis, the Vecchietti procedure is a laparoscopic surgical technique that produces a vagina of dimensions (depth and width) comparable to those of a normal vagina (ca. 8 cm deep). A small, plastic sphere called an olive is threaded (sutured) against the vaginal area; the threads are drawn though the vaginal skin, up through the abdomen, and through the navel. There, the threads are attached to a traction device, and then daily are drawn tight so that the olive is pulled inwards and stretches the vagina, by approximately 1 cm per day, thereby creating a vagina, approximately 7 cm deep by 7 cm wide, in 7 days. The mean operating room (OR) time for the Vecchietti vaginoplasty is approximately 45 minutes; yet, depending upon the patient and her indications, the procedure might require more time. The outcomes of Vecchietti technique via the laparoscopic approach are found to be comparable to the procedure using laparotomy. In vaginal hypoplasia, traction vaginoplasty such as the Vecchietti technique seems to have the highest success rates both anatomically (99%) and functionally (96%) among available treatments.

Other surgical techniques that have been developed include ileal neovagina (Monti&#x27;s technique), Creatsas vaginoplasty, Wharton–Sheares–George neovaginoplasty, or the Davydov procedure. The most widely used is the Vecchietti laparoscopic procedure. Sometimes sexual intercourse can result in the dilation of a newly constructed vagina.

===Vaginal dilators and expanders===

The most techniques of vaginoplasty are using inflatable vaginal expanders or vaginal stents to design the vaginal diameter and length. At the end of the procedure the device stays in place to maintain the neovagina against the pelvic wall which also favors the process of microscopic neovascularization and reduces the risks of hematoma. In post-operative setting the expander can be used regularly to prevent post-operative vaginal retraction. Solid vaginal dilators can also be used immediately after surgery to keep the passage from attachments, and regularly thereafter to maintain the viability of the neovagina. The frequency required to use decreases over time, however remains obligatory lifelong.

==Risks and complications==
Reconstructive vaginoplasty in children and adolescents carries the risk of superinfection.

In adults, rates and types of complications varied with gender-affirming surgery. Necrosis of the clitoral region was 1–3%. Necrosis of the surgically created vagina was 3.7–4.2%. Vaginal shrinkage occurred was documented in 2–10% of those treated. Stricture, or narrowing of the vaginal orifice was reported in 12–15% of the cases. Of those reporting stricture, 41% underwent a second operation to correct the condition. Necrosis of two scrotal flaps has been described. Posterior vaginal wall is a rare complication. Genital pain was reported in 4–9%. Rectovaginal fistula is also rare with 1% documented. Vaginal prolapse was seen in 1–2% of people assigned male at birth undergoing this procedure.

The ability of emptying the bladder was affected for some patients after this procedure: 13% reported improvement, 68% said that there was no change and 19% reported that voiding got worse. Those reporting a negative outcome who experienced loss of bladder control and urinary incontinence were 19%. Urinary tract infections occurred in 32% of those treated.

==History==
Reports of people seeking vaginoplasty go back to the 2nd century. The first modern vaginoplasty was performed in 1931 on Dora Richter. Lili Elbe also underwent a vaginoplasty the same year.

<text>Historical thinking is a set of critical literacy skills for evaluating and analyzing primary source documents to construct a meaningful account of the past. Sometimes called historical reasoning skills, historical thinking skills are frequently described in contrast to historical content knowledge such as names, dates, and places. This dichotomous presentation is often misinterpreted as a claim for the superiority of one form of knowing over the other. The distinction is generally made to underscore the importance of developing thinking skills that can be applied when individuals encounter any historical content. History educators have varying perspectives about the extent they should emphasize facts about the past, moral lessons, connections to current events, or historical thinking skills and different belief about what historical thinking involves.

== U.S. Academic Standards and Disciplinary Frameworks ==
In the United States, the National Center for History in the Schools at the University of California, Los Angeles has developed history standards that include benchmarks for both content in U.S. and world history and historical thinking skills in Kindergarten thru grade 4 and grades 5-12. In both of these age ranges, the Center defines historical thinking in five parts:

# Chronological Thinking 
# Historical Comprehension 
# Historical Analysis and Interpretation 
# Historical Research Capabilities 
# Historical Issues-Analysis and Decision-Making

As part of the national assessment effort called “The Nation’s Report Card, ” the United States Department of Education also developed benchmarks for student achievement in U.S. history. Their rubric divides history learning into three basic dimensions: major historical themes, chronological periods, and ways of knowing and thinking about history. The third dimension is further divided into two parts: historical knowledge and perspective, and historical analysis and interpretation.

==History Textbooks==
History textbooks draw much attention from history educators and educational researchers. The use of textbooks is nearly universal in history, government, and other social studies courses at the primary, and secondary levels in the U.S.; however, the role of textbooks in these courses remains controversial. Arguments against reliance on textbooks have ranged from ideological to pragmatic. While textbooks are often presented as the objective truth, they include constructed versions of a selected period in the past.

The construction and adoption of textbooks can be political, with groups fighting over the version of history they think should be presented to schoolchildren. For example, Texas history textbooks did not include slavery as a central cause of the Civil War until 2018, even though slavery has long been understood to be a core issue causing the Civil War.

Historical thinking has been suggested as a way to avoid presenting only one narrative as the truth. In response to the controversy over Texas textbooks, University of Northern Colorado History Department Chair, Fritz Fischer said that &quot;many of these problems could be solved if the school board prioritized making primary documents available to students, rather than deciding on which version of events ought to be taught.&quot;

Still, other critics believe that using textbooks undermines the process of learning history by sacrificing thinking skills for content—that textbooks allow teachers to cover vast amounts of names, dates, and places while encouraging students simply to memorize instead of question or analyze historical events. For example, Sam Wineburg argues, &quot;Traditional history instruction constitutes a form of information, not a form of knowledge. Students might master an agreed-upon narrative, but they lacked any way of evaluating it, of deciding whether it or any other narrative, was compelling or true” (41).

Despite their drawbacks, most textbook critics concede that textbooks are necessary tools in history education. Proponents of textbook-based curricula point out that history teachers require resources to support the broad scope of topics covered in the typical history classroom. Well-designed textbooks can provide a foundation on which enterprising educators can build other classroom activities that develop historical thinking.

== Teaching Models ==
Models for historical thinking have been developed to better prepare educators in facilitating historical thinking literacies in students.

=== Benchmarks for Historical Thinking ===
Peter Seixas, a professor at the University of British Columbia and creator of &quot;The Historical Thinking Project&quot;, outlines six distinct but closely interrelated historical thinking concepts that constitute historical thinking literacy in students. The concepts focus on developing the skills necessary for students to create an account of the past using primary source documents and narratives, or what Seixas terms &quot;traces&quot; and &quot;accounts.&quot; Although these benchmarks provide a model to develop historical literacies, Seixas states that these concepts can only can be applied with substantial learning about the past
* Establishing Historical Significance is the ability to identify which events, issues, and trends are historically significant and how they connect to one another. Historical significance varies over time and between groups thus the criteria for determining what to study varies (e.g. Canadians will study Canadian history due to national connections).
* Using Primary Sources as Evidence involves locating, choosing, understanding, and providing context for the past using primary sources of evidence. When teaching with primary sources, it is important to understand the differences between First, Second, and Third order sources, which are ordered by the originality of material and their proximity to the source of origin. &quot;First Order Sources&quot; or primary sources are contemporaneous records of events as they were first described or as they happened, without interpretive commentary (e.g., reports, speeches, letters). Meanwhile, &quot;second order or secondary sources&quot; are those that corroborate, restate, explain, or interpret first order documents (e.g., commentaries, reviews, analyses). Finally &quot;third order or tertiary sources&quot; list or catalog other sources (e.g., encyclopedias). While second and third order sources are read for information, first order sources require students to draw inferences and make comparisons about the purposes, values, and world views of the authors to construct a narrative argument about history or assess what questions cannot be answered.
* Identifying Continuity is the ability to understand how issues change or stay the same over time and identify the change as progress or decline. Placing historical events in chronological order is a way of identifying continuity and the ability to group events into identifiable periods helps to better understand their interconnection.
* Analyze Case and Consequences requires students to recognize how humans can cause change that impacts present day social, political and natural (e.g., geographic) issues. Seixas and Peck note that this benchmark requires understanding causes and/or circumstances, that include &quot;...long-term ideologies, institutions, and conditions, and short-term motivations, actions and events&quot; that lead to particular consequences in history and affect the present.
* Taking a Historical Perspective is understanding different social, cultural, intellectual, and emotional perspectives that formed the experiences and actions of people from the past.
* Understanding the Moral Dimension of History involves learning about moral issues today by examining the past. This is an important step in historical literacy because it requires reserving present day moral judgments to understand actions from the past without approving of those actions.

=== SCIM-C Strategy ===
Created by David Hicks, Peter E. Doolittle &amp; E. Thomas Ewing, the SCIM-C strategy of historical thinking focuses on developing self-regulating practices when engaging with primary sources. The SCIM-C strategy focuses on the development of historical questions to be answered when analyzing primary sources. This strategy provides a scaffold for students as they build more complex investigation and analysis practices identified in the &quot;capstone stage&quot;. The capstone stage in the SCIM-C model relies on students having analyzed a number of historical documents and having built some historical knowledge about the time, event, or issue being studied.
* Summarizing is the process of finding information using a primary source. This information can include the type of source (e.g. text, photograph), creator, subject, date it was created, and the opinion or perspective of the author.
* Contextualizing is the skill of identifying when and in what context the primary source was created. By placing the primary source in context the source can more easily be treated a historical document separate from contemporary morals, ethics, and values.
* Inferring is the ability to use the information gathered during the summarizing and contextualizing of a source to develop a greater understanding of the sub-text of a primary source. This stage relies on the ability to ask questions requiring inference on what is not stated directly in the source.
* Monitoring (Capstone Stage) involves identifying initial assumptions that may have been a part of the historical question asked. This stage requires an analysis of the original question and whether the historical information found has answered that question or whether more questions need to be considered.
* Corroborating is the final stage that can only occurs once several historical documents have been analyzed. This stage involves comparing evidence from a number of sources. This comparison includes looking for similarities and differences in perspectives, gaps in the information, and contradictions.

<text>Odivelas () is a municipality in the Lisbon metropolitan area, Portugal. The municipality is located 8 km northwest of the center of Lisbon. Predominantly a residential suburb, the population in 2021 was 148 034, in an area of 26.54 km2 (one of the smallest municipalities in Portugal).

==Geography==
Situated in the old district of Lisbon (historical Estremadura province), the municipality of Odivelas is in the metropolitan area of Lisbon, bordering the municipalities of Loures, Sintra, Amadora and Lisbon.

The region is situated in an extensive plain that extends from Pontinha to Póvoa de Santo Adrião, running through Odivelas and Olival Basto. The rest of the territory is formed by semi-rugged hilltops and valleys, dotted with pine forests and some small agricultural lands (some grazing sheep). Caneças maintains an agricultural character, through cultivation in greenhouses and fields, especially of flowers and ornamental plants.

Administratively, the municipality is divided into 4 civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;):
* Odivelas
* Pontinha e Famões 
* Póvoa de Santo Adrião e Olival Basto
* Ramada e Caneças

==History==

The origin of the name &quot;Odivelas&quot; is caught up in a peculiar legend that developed from the reign of King Denis. In the legend, King Denis had a habit of travelling late at night to the area of Odivelas, in order to have liaisons with women. On one of these nights, the Queen (Elizabeth of Portugal) waited for her wandering husband, and confronted him about the nightly trips, asking him: 
:&quot;Ides vê-las senhor...?&quot; (&quot;Going to see them sir?&quot;)
The phrase was, therefore, corrupted into &quot;Odivelas&quot;, or &quot;where the King went to see them [the ladies]&quot;. Another interpretation stems from the component words: &quot;odi&quot; and &quot;velas&quot;. The first, of Arab origin, means &quot;water course&quot;, while the second, from the Latin reference for the sails of a windmill. Both a river and vestiges of ancient windmills can be identified in the central part of the community.

The dolmen in Pedras Grandes and Batalhas (in the parish of Caneças), the castro of Amoreira (in the parish of Ramada), vestiges of Roman settlements in Póvoa de Santo Adrião, Arab implements in the sub-soils of Paiã (in the parish of Pontinha), indicate that the territory of Odivelas have been occupied continuously over the centuries, owing to its fertile land and temperate climate.

In the main square of Odivelas on 1415, Philippa of Lancaster blessed her three sons (Edward, Peter and Henry) when they departed on horseback for Restelo, where they would begin their overseas voyage to take the city-state of Ceuta.

It was in the &quot;Monastery of São Dinis&quot; that was first presented in 1534 &quot;Auto da Cananeia&quot;, by the author Gil Vicente, which was commissioned by Mother-Superior Violente, sister of Pedro Álvares Cabral. The lands around Pontinha become a fertile center during this century, as more and more farmers and nobility migrated into this region (along with Póvoa de Santo Adrião and Caneças). Some property-owners, such as the painter Vieira Lusitano, were part of an influx of cultural residents into Odivelas. In Póvoa de Santo Adrião, the painter Pedro Alexandrino, would later contribute to the works in the Sé Cathedral in Lisbon, the Queluz National Palace and the Coach Museum in Belém.

The theft from the main church of Odivelas (on 11 May 1671) was the origin to the monument dedicated to the &quot;Senhor Roubado&quot; (), and which would give rise to the first political cartoon, that would criticize the activities of the Inquisition. This was a period when missionaries returning from Asia and Africa would visit the Convent of Rilhafoles, in Paiã (Pontinha). Another controversy arose in 1723, when the sisters in the monastery were aghast at the assumption that a Brazilian nun could be Jewish, and had infiltrated their order (assuming to save herself from persecution by the Inquisition). They went so far as to present the case to the Cardinal-Inquisitor, and upon that failure, to the King (who refused to arbitrate). The nuns were eventually summarily carted-off by soldiers and returned to the monastery. Ironically, much later, Mother Paula de Odivelas (real name Paula Teresa da Silva e Almeida), with whom King John V (30 years her senior) had a passionate affair, would join the sisters. Their relationship would last until the death of the monarch, although the King would provide a generous monthly stipend after his death.

In 1731, John V decreed the beginning of the construction of the Águas Livres Aqueduct, that began in the &quot;Fonte das Águas Livres&quot; near Carenque and ended in reservoir in Amoreira (completed in 1834). The Amoreira reservoir (), albeit a beautiful space, has a capacity for which were transported through tunnels to the numerous fountains in Lisbon. The aqueduct was never totally efficient, and its waters were impure and in low quantities. Much later, in 1833, the &quot;Quinta da Pentieira&quot; was constructed in the parish of Pontinha, as a cemetery for victims of cholera. Until the 19th century, Lisbon was a city infected by epidemics with poor quality sources of water. Many of the richer citizens paid men (many from Caneças) to deliver to their homes potable water. Water from Caneças was of a good quality, and its fountains provided a quantity of water that was transported by carriage or barrel to residents of Lisbon, in addition to laundry services and horticultural products.

After the religious orders were suppressed, Odivelas began to occupy an important social role, sought after for its open spaces and natural environment; many members of Lisbon&#x27;s elite built small country estates, or in the beginning of the 20th century, summer homes. The parishes of Odivelas and Pontinha were part of the municipality of Belém, during the era of the writer Alexandre Herculano. Later, they were integrated into the municipality of Olivais (in 1885). In 1886, the municipality of Loures was established, which included many of the other parishes of Odivelas. 
In 1915, the civil parish of Caneças was official constituted. Development in this area began to move away from agriculture, and more and more homes were built. The connection to Lisbon, and the construction of roadways, resulted in the purchase of lands in the region.

In Pontinha, the command post of the Movimento das Forças Armadas (&quot;Armed Forces Movement&quot;) was responsible for assisting the establishment of a democratic Portugal on 25 April 1974 (Carnation Revolution).

Regional intensification, caused by the subdivision of land, greatly affected the local landscape. Twenty-five years after the Carnation Revolution, 85 clandestine barrios developed. Simultaneously, the explosion of civil construction projects (due to a lack of affordable homes in Lisbon) occurred in all the parishes of the municipality (except in Famões), which translated into an increase in the resident population. The political organs developed to support these changes, resulting in the creation of the civil parishes of Pontinha in 1984 and Olival Basto, Ramada and Famões in 1989. Póvoa de Santo Adrião became a town in 1986, Odivelas was elevated to the status of city in 1990, Pontinha to town in 1991 along with Olival Basto in 1997. In this same year, in order to defend local plan for development, a group of citizens established the &quot;Movimento Odivelas a Concelho&quot; (&quot;Odivelan Movement for Municipal Status&quot;). On 19 November 1998, with a unanimous vote of members of the National Assembly, the creation of the Municipality of Odivelas was approved, with its seat in the city of Odivelas. On 20 January 1999, the &quot;Comissão Instaladora do Município de Odivelas&quot; was empowered by the Minister of Equipment, Planning and Administration of the Territory João Cravinho with its new transitional administrative duties. Three years later, the commission ceased to function, and after municipal elections in December 2001, the first municipal government for Odivelas was sworn in. Since then the city became a bastion of the Socialist Party which carried every local election and all but one of the national legislative elections.

==Historical highlights==
The most famous monument in Odivelas is the women&#x27;s Convent of Saint Denis of Odivelas, founded by King Dinis I around 1295. Many famous religious women lived in the convent, which was frequently visited by Kings and Queens (indeed, several Kings had illegitimate sons with the nuns). The Gothic convent was very much damaged in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, but the apse has survived, as well as the tomb of King Dinis and his daughter, &quot;Princess Maria Afonso&quot;. The Convent also has interesting architecture in Manueline and Baroque styles.

Another interesting sight is the &quot;Odivelas Memorial&quot;, a curious, early 14th century monument. It carries a coat-of-arms of Portugal in the late 15th century style, when the monument may have been restored. The purpose of this monument is not exactly known, but it may have been erected to mark the arrival of the body of King Dinis in Odivelas, to be buried in the Convent.

In the early 18th century, King John V, ordered the construction of an aqueduct to transport water from the parish of Caneças to the city of Lisbon, which suffered from chronic lack of water. The Águas Livres Aqueduct, which began to operate in 1748, is one of the masterpieces of ancient Portuguese engineering.

In Pontinha the command post of the Armed Forces Movement that led the 1974 Carnation Revolution is now a museum.

==Sports==
Odivelas Futebol Clube is the most representative sporting association in the city, with three soccer fields, gymnasium, and other facilities.

<doc id="767086" wikidata="Q421177" url="?curid=767086" title="Cotinine">
<text>Cotinine is an alkaloid found in tobacco and is also the predominant metabolite of nicotine, typically used as a biomarker for exposure to tobacco smoke. Cotinine is currently being studied as a treatment for depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Cotinine was developed as an antidepressant as a fumaric acid salt, cotinine fumarate, to be sold under the brand name Scotine, but it was never marketed.

Similarly to nicotine, cotinine binds to, activates, and desensitizes neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, though at much lower potency in comparison. It has demonstrated nootropic and antipsychotic-like effects in animal models. Cotinine treatment has also been shown to reduce depression, anxiety, and fear-related behavior as well as memory impairment in animal models of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Nonetheless, treatment with cotinine in humans was reported to have no significant physiologic, subjective, or performance effects in one study, though others suggest that this may not be the case. 

Because cotinine is the main metabolite to nicotine and has been shown to be pharmacologically active, it has been suggested that some of nicotine&#x27;s effects in the nervous system may be mediated by cotinine and/or complex interactions with nicotine itself.

==Pharmacology==
A few studies indicate that the affinity for cotinine to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) is about 100 times lower than nicotine&#x27;s. Some work suggests that cotinine may be a positive allosteric modulator of α7 nAChRs. If this is true, cotinine would facilitate endogenous neurotransmission without directly stimulating nAChRs.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Cotinine has an in vivo half-life of approximately 20 hours, and is typically detectable for several days (up to one week) after the use of tobacco. The level of cotinine in the blood, saliva, and urine is proportionate to the amount of exposure to tobacco smoke, so it is a valuable indicator of tobacco smoke exposure, including secondary (passive) smoke. People who smoke menthol cigarettes may retain cotinine in the blood for a longer period because menthol can compete with enzymatic metabolism of cotinine. African American smokers generally have higher plasma cotinine levels than Caucasian smokers. Males generally have higher plasma cotinine levels than females. These systematic differences in cotinine levels were attributed to variation in CYP2A6 activity. At steady state, plasma cotinine levels are determined by the amount of cotinine formation and the rate of cotinine removal, which are both mediated by the enzyme CYP2A6. Since CYP2A6 activity differs by sex (estrogen induces CYP2A6) and genetic variation, cotinine accumulates in individuals with slower CYP2A6 activity, resulting in substantial differences in cotinine levels for a given tobacco exposure.

===Detection in body fluids===
Drug tests can detect cotinine in the blood, urine, or saliva. Salivary cotinine concentrations are highly correlated to blood cotinine concentrations, and can detect cotinine in a low range, making it the preferable option for a less invasive method of tobacco exposure testing. Urine cotinine concentrations average four to six times higher than those in blood or saliva, making urine a more sensitive matrix to detect low-concentration exposure.

Cotinine levels &lt;10 ng/mL are considered to be consistent with no active smoking. Values of 10 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL are associated with light smoking or moderate passive exposure, and levels above 300 ng/mL are seen in heavy smokers — more than 20 cigarettes a day. In urine, values between 11 ng/mL and 30 ng/mL may be associated with light smoking or passive exposure, and levels in active smokers typically reach 500 ng/mL or more. In saliva, values between 1 ng/mL and 30 ng/mL may be associated with light smoking or passive exposure, and levels in active smokers typically reach 100 ng/mL or more. Cotinine assays provide an objective quantitative measure that is more reliable than smoking histories or counting the number of cigarettes smoked per day. Cotinine also permits the measurement of exposure to second-hand smoke (passive smoking).

However, tobacco users attempting to quit with the help of nicotine replacement therapies (i.e., gum, lozenge, patch, inhaler, and nasal spray) will also test positive for cotinine, since all common NRT therapies contain nicotine that is metabolized in the same way. Therefore, the presence of cotinine is not a conclusive indication of tobacco use. Cotinine levels can be used in research to explore the question of the amount of nicotine delivered to the user of e-cigarettes, where laboratory smoking machines have many problems replicating real-life conditions.

Serum cotinine concentration has been used for decades in US population surveys of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to monitor tobacco use, to monitor levels and trends in exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, and to study the relationship between tobacco smoke and chronic health conditions. An estimated one in four nonsmokers (approximately 58 million persons) were exposed to secondhand smoke during 2013-2014. Nearly 40% of children aged 3–11 years were exposed as were 50% of non-Hispanic blacks.

<text>Nona Gaprindashvili (; born 3 May 1941) is a Georgian chess Grandmaster. Noted for her aggressive style of play, she was the women&#x27;s world chess champion from 1962 to 1978, and in 1978 was the first woman ever to be awarded the FIDE title of Grandmaster. She was inducted into the World Chess Hall of Fame in 2013 and the Presidential Order of Excellence in 2015.

Gaprindashvili began playing chess when she was five years old; in 1954, she moved to Tbilisi to train under Grandmasters. In 1962, she became women&#x27;s world chess champion by a sweeping victory in a match against the incumbent, Elisaveta Bykova. This won her widespread acclaim throughout Georgia. She successfully defended her title on four occasions: three times against Alla Kushnir and once against Nana Alexandria. She narrowly lost her title to Maia Chiburdanidze in 1978. Gaprindashvili participated in men&#x27;s tournaments during her career, including a performance at Lone Pine International which earned her the title of Grandmaster. She later competed regularly in the Women&#x27;s World Senior Championship.

Besides her chess career, Gaprindashvili maintained an active presence in Georgian politics: she served as a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Georgian SSR, as president of the Georgian National Olympic Committee, and as a member of the People&#x27;s Assembly group that organized the 2011 Georgian protests. In 2021, Gaprindashvili filed a defamation lawsuit against Netflix after it erroneously described her in &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Gambit&quot; as never having competed against men; Netflix settled in 2022.

== Early life ==
Nona Gaprindashvili was born in Zugdidi in 1941, the youngest of six children and the only girl. Her family was highly athletic, and the neighborhood children would often gather at the Gaprindashvili&#x27;s home to play table tennis, billiards, and football. They had her play goalkeeper during their football games because she was the girl of the family. She first learned to play chess from her father while she was five years old and from watching her brother play. When Gaprindashvili was eleven or twelve, she accompanied her brother to a chess tournament, and when he was unable to play, she played in his stead. Here she was noticed by chess trainer . Her parents had her live with her aunt in Tbilisi, where she could train with chess Grandmasters beginning in 1954. By 1956, at the age of fourteen, she won the semi-final of the Women&#x27;s Soviet Union Championship.

==World champion and Grandmaster==
Gaprindashvili won the Women&#x27;s Candidates Tournament in 1961, making her eligible to challenge Elisaveta Bykova, the reigning world champion in women&#x27;s chess. Gaprindashvili&#x27;s favorite football team, FC Dinamo Tbilisi attended the game as spectators to support her. Gaprindashvili won the 1962 match against Bykova with a large victory of nine points against Bykova&#x27;s two. The game was adjourned, to be resumed the following morning, but Bykova conceded by phone later that night.

After her victory, Gaprindashvili was a celebrity in Georgia, and crowds gathered to meet her as she returned from the World Championship match. Woman Grandmaster Jennifer Shahade described Gaprindashvili as a symbol of Georgian nationalism and merit during the country&#x27;s time as a constituent republic of the Soviet Union. Her victory marked the beginning of a &quot;women&#x27;s chess revolution&quot; in Georgia. Woman Grandmaster Rusudan Goletiani said that this went even further, with her success helping inspire a broader &quot;intellectual revolution&quot; for Georgian women. Many women took up chess afterward, and Georgia became one of the most prominent countries in women&#x27;s chess, producing numerous masters during Gaprindashvili&#x27;s career.

Gaprindashvili went on to defend her title successfully three times against the Soviet player Alla Kushnir. In 1975, Gaprindashvili was challenged by the Georgian player Nana Alexandria. The competition between the two Georgians was widely followed in their home country; Gaprindashvili won with 8.5 points against Alexandria&#x27;s 3.5.

During her career Gaprindashvili successfully competed in tournaments that were traditionally played by men, winning, amongst others, the Hastings Challengers tournament in 1963/4. She tied for second place at Sandomierz in 1976, tied for first place at Lone Pine International in 1977, and tied for second at the Dortmund Sparkassen Chess Meeting in 1978. Her performance at Lone Pine made her the first woman ever to earn a norm for the title of Grandmaster. Her win at Lone Pine was also the first elite tournament victory by a woman. Her performances at Sandomierz and Dortmund did not earn grandmaster norms, which would have contributed to her earning a Grandmaster title, as she was one-half point short in each case. At the meeting of the FIDE Congress in 1978, Gaprindashvili was awarded the title of Grandmaster, although the normal requirement was three norms totaling 24 games. She considers her Lone Pine performance and her subsequent awarding of Grandmaster to be her greatest achievement in chess.

The same year, Gaprindashvili was challenged for her title by another Georgian player, Maia Chiburdanidze, who was only seventeen years old at the time of the tournament. Their first three rounds were draws. Chiburdanidze then won three rounds in a row, followed by two victories for Gaprindashvili. The final round was to determine who would take the championship. It was won by Chiburdanidze, and Gaprindashvili lost her title as world champion.

== Later career ==

Gaprindashvili played for the Soviet Union in the Women&#x27;s Chess Olympiads of 1963, 1966, 1969, 1972, 1974, 1978, 1980, 1982, 1984, 1986, 1990, and for Georgia in 1992. She was one of the contributing players of the Soviet Union team that dominated the Women&#x27;s Olympiads of the 1980s. She won 25 medals, including eleven team gold medals and nine individual gold medals. At the Olympiad of Dubai 1986 she won all ten games she played. Gaprindashvili was a five-time winner of the USSR Women&#x27;s Chess Championship: in 1964, 1973/74, 1981, 1983, and 1985. She achieved her peak FIDE rating of 2495 in July 1987. Gaprindashvili went on to train young female chess players, including Ana Matnadze and Tea Lanchava. As of her 2022 win, she has eight victories at the Women&#x27;s World Senior Championship, a championship for female players at least 65 years of age.

Besides chess, Gaprindashvili was also active politically, serving as a member of the Soviet Parliament of Georgia. She then served as president of the Georgian National Olympic Committee from 1989 to 1996. She was active in the protests against President Eduard Shevardnadze in 2002. Gaprindashvili was then among the most prominent members of the People&#x27;s Assembly, a political opposition movement that protested the presidency of Mikheil Saakashvili. She and the People&#x27;s Assembly were involved in the 2011 Georgian protests.

In 2005, at the age of 64, Gaprindashvili won the BDO Chess Tournament held in Haarlem, the Netherlands, with a score of 6½/10 points and a performance rating of 2510. In 2020, she appeared in the documentary &quot;Glory to the Queen&quot;, alongside Nana Alexandria, Maia Chiburdanidze and Nana Ioseliani.

The Netflix series &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Gambit&quot; and its story were influenced by Gaprindashvili&#x27;s life. The show erroneously described her as a Russian chess player who had never competed against men, while in fact she had played against at least 59 men in 1968 alone (including 10 male grandmasters), and is actually from Georgia. In response, she filed a lawsuit against Netflix for US$5 million for false light, invasion of privacy, and defamation on 16 September 2021. In September 2022, Netflix settled with Gaprindashvili on undisclosed terms.

==Personal life==
In December 1969, Gaprindashvili married Anzor Chichinadze in Tbilisi.

== Playing style and philosophy ==
Gaprindashvili has been noted for her competitiveness and aggressive playing style. Following her victory over Bykova in 1962, it became common for young female chess players to emulate Gaprindashvili&#x27;s style of aggressive and technical play. As a child, Gaprindashvili had a reputation for handling losses poorly. She has expressed an appreciation for the fact that arbitrators do not have a significant role in chess, having seen problems in other sports. Gaprindashvili has said that she does not like to compare chess players, as she sees each chess player as having their own body of work rather than a single factor that can be compared. Among those she considers great chess players, she has listed Bobby Fischer, Mikhail Tal, and Paul Morphy.

== Honors and awards ==

Gaprindashvili was awarded the Presidential Order of Excellence in 2015 by President of Georgia Giorgi Margvelashvili for &quot;her outstanding contribution to the country and nation&quot; and &quot;representing Georgia at an international level&quot;. In 2013, she was inducted into the World Chess Hall of Fame.

Tbilisi&#x27;s Chess Palace is dedicated to Gaprindashvili. The town of Zugdidi put up a statue in Gaprindashvili&#x27;s honor. On her 60th birthday, the government of Georgia gave her two cars. In 2016, FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov gave her a representation of Caïssa, in the shape of a chess queen, made by the Lobortas Classic Jewelry House.

<text>Eilean Donan () is a small tidal island situated at the confluence of three sea lochs (Loch Duich, Loch Long and Loch Alsh) in the western Highlands of Scotland, about from the village of Dornie. It is connected to the mainland by a footbridge that was installed early in the 20th century and is dominated by a picturesque castle that frequently appears in photographs, film and television. The island&#x27;s original castle was built in the thirteenth century; it became a stronghold of the Clan Mackenzie and their allies, the Clan MacRae. In response to the Mackenzies&#x27; involvement in the Jacobite rebellions early in the 18th century, government ships destroyed the castle in 1719. The present-day castle is Lieutenant-Colonel John Macrae-Gilstrap&#x27;s 20th-century reconstruction of the old castle.

Eilean Donan is part of the Kintail National Scenic Area, one of 40 in Scotland. In 2001, the island had a recorded population of just one person, but there were no &quot;usual residents&quot; at the time of the 2011 census.

Eilean Donan, which means simply &quot;island of Donnán&quot;, is named after Donnán of Eigg, a Celtic saint who was martyred in 617. Donnán is said to have established a church on the island, though no trace of this remains.

==History==
It is possible that an early Christian monastic cell was founded on the island in the 6th or 7th century, and that it was dedicated to Donnán of Eigg, an Irish saint who was martyred on Eigg in April 617. No remains of any Christian buildings survive, though fragments of vitrified stone (stone that has been subjected to very high temperatures) have been discovered, indicating that there was an Iron Age or early medieval fortification on the island.

===Origins of the castle===
In the earlier thirteenth century, during the reign of Alexander II (ruled 1214–1249), a large curtain-wall castle (wall of enceinte) was constructed; it enclosed much of the island. At this time, the area around the island was at the boundary of the Norse-Celtic Lordship of the Isles and the Earldom of Ross: Eilean Donan provided a strong defensive position against Norse expeditions. A founding legend has it that the son of a chief of the Mathesons acquired the power to communicate with birds; as a result of this power, and after many adventures overseas, he gained wealth, power, and the respect of Alexander II, who asked him to build the castle to defend his realm.

At a later date, the island became a stronghold of the Mackenzies of Kintail, originally vassals of William I, Earl of Ross. At this early stage, the castle is said to have been garrisoned by Macraes and Maclennans, both clans that were later closely associated with the Mackenzies. Traditional Mackenzie clan histories relate that Earl William sought advantage from the Treaty of Perth of 1266, by which King Magnus VI of Norway ceded the Hebrides to Scotland, and demanded that his kinsman Kenneth Mackenzie return the castle to allow his expansion into the islands. Mackenzie refused, and Earl William led an assault against Eilean Donan that the Mackenzies and their allies repulsed.

The Mackenzie clan histories also claim (with little, if any, supporting contemporary evidence), that Robert the Bruce sheltered at Eilean Donan during the winter of 1306 to 1307; the castle escaped any other involvement in the Wars of Scottish Independence. In 1331 Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray, sent an officer to Eilean Donan to warn the occupants of his forthcoming visit. In preparation 50 wrongdoers were rounded up and executed, their heads being displayed on the castle walls to Moray&#x27;s approval. By the middle of the 14th century the Mackenzies are said to have been on the losing side in the ongoing feuding with the Earls of Ross. William III, Earl of Ross granted Kintail to Raghnall Mac Ruaidhrí in 1342. With the assistance of Leod Macgilleandrais, the Earl allegedly apprehended Kenneth Mackenzie, 3rd of Kintail, and had him executed in 1346 at Inverness. Through this period Eilean Donan is said to have been held by Duncan Macaulay for the Mackenzies, against the Earl and his allies. Kenneth&#x27;s young son Murdo Mackenzie supposedly evaded the Earl&#x27;s attempts to eliminate him, and on the return of David II from exile Murdo Mackenzie was allegedly confirmed in the lands of Kintail and Eilean Donan by a charter of 1362 (of which, however, no trace survives to the present day). At some point in the earlier 14th century it is thought that the Clan Macrae began to settle in Kintail as a body, having migrated from the Beauly Firth, and there gained the trust of the Mackenzie lairds through possible kinship and an advantageous marriage. The Macraes began to act as Mackenzie&#x27;s bodyguards, acquiring the soubriquet &quot;Mackenzie&#x27;s shirt of mail&quot;.

===Clan feuding===

James I, determined to pacify the Highlands, journeyed to Inverness in 1427 and invited the principal chiefs to meet him there. Allegedly among them was the young Alexander Mackenzie, 6th Earl of Kintail. James then arrested him, along with the other chiefs, on their arrival. Mackenzie clan histories relate that, although several chiefs were executed or imprisoned, Alexander, due to his youth, was instead sent to Perth to attend school. Alexander&#x27;s uncles attempted to seize control of Kintail, but the constable Duncan Macaulay continued to hold Eilean Donan on his behalf. Fionnla Dubh mac Gillechriosd, considered by clan historians to be the founder of the Clan Macrae in Kintail, was dispatched to fetch the young laird back. During his lairdship Alexander appears to have supported the monarchy against the MacDonald Lords of the Isles and was allegedly rewarded by another charter of Kintail in 1463. Alexander died in about 1488 at a great age, and was succeeded by Kenneth Mackenzie, 7th of Kintail who won the Battle of Blar Na Pairce against the MacDonalds. Kenneth died a few years later and was succeeded first by his eldest son, then on his death in 1497 by his second son, John of Killin, who was still a minor. His uncle, Hector Roy Mackenzie, attempted to usurp the Mackenzie lands and installed his own constable in Eilean Donan, Malcolm Mac Ian Charrich Macrae. Hector&#x27;s lawless activities caused the Mackenzies to be branded rebels, and in 1503 the Earl of Huntly offered to deliver Eilean Donan to the king, and to hold it on his behalf. James IV supplied a ship to support the enterprise. Eventually, John compelled his uncle to relinquish his claim, and Hector agreed to hand over Eilean Donan. The constable refused however, and John&#x27;s supporters laid siege. Malcolm Mac Ian Charrich was eventually persuaded by Hector to relinquish the castle, after which he was dismissed as constable and Christopher Macrae (Gillechriosd Mac Fionnlagh Mhic Rath) was appointed in his place in around 1511. John of Killin obtained a further charter of Kintail and Eilean Donan in 1509.

In 1539, Donald Gorm Macdonald of Sleat ravaged the lands of MacLeod of Dunvegan on Skye and then attacked the Mackenzie lands of Kinlochewe, where Miles (Maolmure), brother of Christopher Macrae, was killed. After a series of retaliatory raids, Donald Gorm learned that Eilean Donan was weakly garrisoned and launched a surprise attack. In fact, only two people were in the castle: the recently appointed constable Iain Dubh Matheson and the warden. Duncan MacGillechriosd of the Clan Macrae, son of the former constable, arrived at the start of the attack and killed several MacDonalds at the postern gate. Arrows launched by the attackers killed Matheson and the warden, but MacGillechriosd managed to hit Donald Gorm with his last arrow, fatally wounding Gorm, and the Macdonalds retreated. Duncan MacGillechriosd expected to be appointed as the new constable but was considered too headstrong: the local clergyman John MacMhurchaidh Dhuibh (John Murchison) was appointed as a compromise between rival Macrae and Maclennan interests. Furious at this treatment, MacGillechriosd left Kintail and joined the service of Lord Lovat, though he eventually returned to settle at Inverinate. Meanwhile, an aggrieved Maclennan apparently shot MacMhurchaidh in the buttocks with an arrow.

MacGillechriosd&#x27;s son Christopher Macrae became constable of Eilean Donan in turn, and held the castle during yet another clan feud, this time between the Mackenzies and the MacDonalds of Glengarry. Feuding broke out in 1580 and continued for almost 25 years. In around 1602 Eilean Donan was the base for a sea skirmish at the narrows of Kyle Rhea led by Christopher&#x27;s son Duncan. During the action the MacDonalds were driven on to the Cailleach Rock at the eastern tip of Skye and Angus, son of MacDonald of Glengarry, was killed. Christopher was succeeded as constable by the Rev. Murdoch Murchison, minister of Kintail.

===17th century===
The Rev. Farquhar Macrae, son of Christopher Macrae, was born at the castle in 1580. After attending Edinburgh University and taking holy orders, in 1618 he was appointed constable of the castle and minister of Kintail on the death of Murdoch Murchison. Colin Mackenzie of Kintail was created Earl of Seaforth in 1623. He lived mainly at Chanonry of Ross in Fortrose, but made regular visits to Eilean Donan where the constable was required to entertain him and his retinue of between 300 and 500 retainers, as well as the neighbouring lairds. In 1635 George Mackenzie, 2nd Earl of Seaforth, appointed Farquhar as tutor to his six-year-old son Kenneth, who was subsequently raised at Eilean Donan.

In the civil wars of the mid 17th century, the Earl of Seaforth sided with Charles I. In 1650, after the king&#x27;s execution, the Parliament of Scotland ordered a garrison to Eilean Donan. The local people did not welcome the garrison. When a party of 30 soldiers came out from the castle to request provisions from the local people, a band of 10 men who opposed their demands met the occupiers. An argument broke out, which led to the garrison men being driven off with several casualties. Shortly thereafter the garrison departed. The following year the Earl&#x27;s brother, Simon Mackenzie of Lochslin, gathered troops for the royalist cause around Eilean Donan. For reasons unrecorded, he fell out with Farquhar Macrae and demanded his removal from the castle. Farquhar initially resisted, and despite interventions by the young Kenneth, had to be marched out by Lochslin and George Mackenzie (later Earl of Cromartie). He was finally persuaded to leave without violence, stating that he was too old to dwell in the cold castle. Farquhar was thus the last constable to dwell in Eilean Donan until its reconstruction, although he retained the ministry of Kintail until his death in 1662, at the age of 82.

After this time, the castle was briefly occupied by the Earl of Balcarres and his wife, who were in the Highlands in support of the Earl of Glencairn&#x27;s royalist uprising, although Balcarres later disagreed with Glencairn and departed. In June 1654 General Monck, Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s military governor in Scotland, marched through Kintail while suppressing the uprising. His troops destroyed much property, and stole 360 of Farquhar Macrae&#x27;s cattle, though only one man was killed.

===Jacobite rising and destruction of the castle===
In 1689, King James VII of the House of Stuart was declared to have to forfeit the throne, and the crown was offered to William of Orange, in the so-called &quot;Glorious Revolution&quot;. The revolution also established Presbyterianism in Scotland, although the Highlands generally remained Roman Catholic and loyal to the Stuarts. A series of Jacobite risings followed, leading to an increased military presence in Scotland as government forces attempted to penetrate and subdue the Highlands. In 1714 while surveying fortifications for the government, the military engineer Lewis Petit made the only surviving drawing of Eilean Donan. The sketch-elevation and carefully drawn plan show a dilapidated castle, largely roofless but for a small building by the entrance.

A major Jacobite uprising took place in 1715. Led by the Earl of Mar, it was an attempt to restore the exiled James Stuart, the &quot;Old Pretender&quot;, to the throne. William Mackenzie, 5th Earl of Seaforth, joined the Jacobite army, leading out men of the Clan Mackenzie and Clan Macrae. The Macraes mustered at Eilean Donan, and are said to have danced on the roof of the castle before setting out to the Battle of Sheriffmuir where 58 Macraes were among the Jacobite dead. The battle was indecisive and the rising collapsed soon after.

Following the failure of the rising of 1715, the Jacobites found new support from Spain, now opposing both Britain and France in the War of the Quadruple Alliance. The Duke of Ormonde led the main invasion fleet from Spain, while an advance party of 300 Spanish soldiers under George Keith, 10th Earl Marischal, arrived in Loch Duich in April 1719, and occupied Eilean Donan Castle. The expected uprising of Highlanders did not occur, and the main Spanish invasion force never arrived. At the beginning of May, the Royal Navy sent ships to the area. Early in the morning on Sunday 10 May 1719 , and anchored off Eilean Donan and sent a boat ashore under a flag of truce to negotiate. When the Spanish soldiers in the castle fired at the boat, it was recalled and all three frigates opened fire on the castle for an hour or more. The next day the bombardment continued while a landing party was prepared. In the evening under the cover of an intense cannonade, a detachment went ashore in the ships&#x27; boats and captured the castle against little resistance. According to &quot;Worcester&quot;″s log, in the castle were &quot;an Irishman, a captain, a Spanish lieutenant, a serjeant, one Scottish rebel and 39 Spanish soldiers, 343 barrels of powder and 52 barrels of musquet shot.&quot; The naval force spent the next two days in the castle and landed 27 barrels of gunpowder. The frigates&#x27; official logs are curiously worded, perhaps to conceal the reputed fact that the Macraes succeeded in destroying the castle although in naval hands, in order to prevent the English from garrisoning it: at all events, the castle was demolished by the gunpowder exploding. &quot;Flamborough&quot; then took the Spanish prisoners to Edinburgh. The remaining Spanish troops were defeated on 10 June at the Battle of Glen Shiel.

===Restoration and reuse===
Between 1919 and 1932, the castle was rebuilt by Lt. Col. John MacRae-Gilstrap. The restoration included the construction of an arched bridge to give easier access to the island. Macrae-Gilstrap also established a war memorial dedicated to the men of the MacRae clan who died in the First World War. The memorial is adorned with lines from John McCrae&#x27;s poem &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot;, and is flanked by grey field guns from the war. Eilean Donan was opened to the public in 1955, and has since become a popular attraction: over 314,000 people visited in 2009, making it the third-most-visited castle in Scotland. In 1983 ownership of the castle was transferred to the Conchra Charitable Trust, established by the Macrae family to maintain and restore the castle, and a purpose-built visitor centre was opened on the landward side of the bridge in 1998.

The castle is regularly described as one of the most photographed monuments in Scotland, and is a recognised Scottish icon, frequently appearing on packaging and advertising for shortbread, whisky and other products. Eilean Donan has made several appearances in films, beginning with &quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot; in 1948 and &quot;The Master of Ballantrae&quot; in 1953. It featured in the opening episode of the 1976 TV series, The New Avengers. The castle was the setting for the 1980 short film Black Angel, filmed to accompany screenings of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; in cinemas. In 1984, Scottish singer and composer Jesse Rae filmed his music video &quot;Over The Sea&quot; at the location. It featured prominently in &quot;Highlander&quot; (1986) as the home of Clan MacLeod. It was the backdrop to a dance scene in the Bollywood movie &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; in 1998. In 1999, it served as the Scottish headquarters of MI6 in &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;. In 2007, Eilean Donan stood in for Fotheringhay Castle in England in &quot;&quot;. In the movie &quot;Made of Honor&quot; Eilean Donan can be seen as home of the groom&#x27;s family. The Tamil song &quot;Kandukondain Kandukondain&quot; from the movie of the same name was filmed in this location.

==Architectural development==
Eilean Donan Castle went through several phases of development from the earliest fortifications of the 13th century through to its destruction in 1719, and the subsequent reconstruction in the 20th century. The first phase comprised a curtain wall enclosing much of the island with a tower house added in the 14th century. In the 14th or 15th century the outer wall was abandoned and a smaller enclosure built around the tower house. More development within this courtyard took place in the 16th century, as well as the addition of defences on the eastern side. The castle was almost totally destroyed in 1719, after which almost 200 years passed before reconstruction began. Although some archaeological evidence has been recovered from the island, much material was lost during the reconstruction works making it difficult to build a clear picture of the early castle. Very little historical evidence survives. Mapmaker Timothy Pont (c. 1565–1614) left a description:

The only drawing of the castle prior to its destruction was made in 1714 by Lewis Petit (c. 1665–1720), a military engineer with the Board of Ordnance who came to Scotland in 1714 to survey Fort William and other defences in the area. Among the drawings he produced are a plan and elevation of Eilean Donan, which clearly show that the castle was largely derelict by this time, with only a building at the southeast corner being roofed.

===Early enclosure===
In the 13th century, a curtain wall or wall of &quot;enceinte&quot; was constructed around the island, enclosing most of the area above the high tide line. Scant remains of these walls can be traced on the ground, running around the northern end of the island. The eastern and southern segments of this wall are largely obscured by later development, although the enclosure is assumed to have contained an area of around . At the northern point of the wall the foundations of a large tower survive, measuring around and the remains of foundations suggest further towers at the north-east and southwest corners of the enclosure. The enclosure was accessed via a sea-gate in the north-west curtain wall, where a small beach would have allowed boats to be drawn up. Another beach to the southwest may have formed a second access. Archaeological excavations in 2008 and 2009 confirmed the presence of these walls, and also found evidence that metalworking was taking place in the northern part of the castle. A tower house or keep was built against the curtain wall at the high point of the island, probably in the 14th century. The tower measured , with walls thick. The vaulted ground floor was originally divided in two, with a stair in the north wall giving access to the first-floor hall. Above this were probably another two storeys, including a garret. The tower, according to Petit&#x27;s later drawing, was topped by crowstep gables, and surrounded by a walkway and bartizans (small turrets) at the corners.

===Reduced castle===

At an unknown period, probably in the later 14th century or early 15th century, the outer wall was abandoned in favour of a smaller defensive enclosure, around square. The entrance to this smaller courtyard was from the east. The reasons for this change are unclear, though it is suggested that the smaller area would have been easier to defend. During the 16th century, two buildings were added to the southern periphery of the enclosure. A small house was constructed within the southeast angle of the wall, with a circular stair-tower on its northern side giving access to the walkway along the eastern curtain wall. Located just inside the gate, this is likely to have served as a house for the castle&#x27;s constable or keeper, and is the only building shown with a roof on Petit&#x27;s survey. At the southwest corner of the enclosure, an L-plan block was put up, possibly as late as the early 17th century. The southern part is sited outside the line of the inner curtain wall, with a northern wing, which may have been a slightly later addition, inside the wall.

===Hornwork===

In the later 16th century, the castle was extended eastward to create a bastion or &quot;hornwork&quot;, providing a more securely defended entrance. The hornwork comprises a pair of walls enclosing a triangular courtyard, linking the east wall of the castle with an irregular hexagonal (or heptagonal) structure. This structure, across, contains a well at its lowest level, across and deep. This led MacGibbon and Ross to describe the structure as a water tower or cistern. However, the presence of a door on its eastern side is shown in 19th century photographs, indicating that it was built as the main entrance to the castle. The water-filled interior would have been crossed by a removable bridge, presenting an obstacle to attackers. From the bridge, access to the castle would have been up a flight of steps, into the triangular courtyard, and through the gate in the east curtain wall. It is possible that the hexagonal bastion was roofed to serve as an artillery position. Dredging of the reservoir in 1893 recovered two brass guns, referred to as &quot;double hagbuts&quot;, and measuring around long with a bore of around . Also recovered was a yett, an iron gate, probably installed in the east door to the bastion, but now on display inside the castle. At some point in the 17th century, this elaborate access was abandoned and a more convenient entrance opened in the south wall of the hornwork. By 1714, Lewis Petit&#x27;s drawing clearly shows that the castle was largely derelict, with only the house at the southeast corner being roofed. Four years later, it was completely demolished, and, by 1912, very little of the castle was still standing.

===Modern castle===

The present castle buildings are entirely the result of 20th-century reconstruction by Macrae-Gilstrap, who commissioned Edinburgh architect George Mackie Watson to draw up the plans. Although the rebuilding followed the extant ground plan, the details of the present castle differ from its original appearance. The survey drawings by Lewis Petit were not rediscovered until the restoration was almost complete, and the restorers therefore were forced to rely on less accurate interpretations such as the work of MacGibbon and Ross, who attempted a plan of the remains in the late 19th century. The clerk of works, Farquhar Macrae, is said to have based the reconstruction on a dream in which he saw the restored Eilean Donan. Rather than a genuinely medieval castle, Eilean Donan is described as &quot;a romantic reincarnation in the tradition of early 20th-century castle revivals.&quot; John Gifford, analysing the building against the Petit survey, notes a &quot;fussy elaboration of what was probably plain originally, and an omission of decoration where it once existed&quot;, and describes the interior as &quot;a rubbly Edwardian stage-set for life in the Middle Ages&quot;.

The castle is today entered from the south, via a modern portal complete with a portcullis. Above the door is a Gaelic inscription which in translation reads: &quot;As long as there is a Macrae inside, there will never be a Fraser outside&quot;, referring to a bond of kinship between the two clans, and a similar inscription which once adorned the Fraser&#x27;s home at Beaufort Castle. Above this is carved the coat of arms of John Macrae-Gilstrap. The portal gives access to the courtyard, the level of which has been lowered exposing the bedrock around the tower house. The present buildings at the southeast of the castle reflect the form of the earlier structures, including the circular stair tower, but are larger in extent. To the southwest only the southern portion of the L-shaped block was reconstructed, as a plain three-storey house, while in place of the northern wing is an open platform giving views over the loch. A small tower occupies the north-west angle. The keep itself follows the original dimensions, though the formerly subdivided ground floor is now a single room: the tunnel-vaulted Billeting Hall. Above on the first floor is the Banqueting Hall with an oak ceiling, and decorated with coats of arms and 15th-century style fireplace. The main ceiling beams in the Banqueting Hall are of Douglas Fir and were shipped from British Columbia, Canada as a gift from the Macraes of Canada. Small mural chambers within the walls are accessed from each hall.

<text>The Sword and the Rose is a family/adventure film produced by Perce Pearce and Walt Disney and directed by Ken Annakin. The film features the story of Mary Tudor, a younger sister of Henry VIII of England.

Based on the 1898 novel &quot;When Knighthood Was in Flower&quot; by Charles Major (1856-1913), of Shelbyville, Indiana. It was originally made into an early silent film in 1908 in the Nickelodeon era and again fifteen years later in another silent film but with a much longer, more developed plot. The 1953 subsequent Disney version under the different title was further adapted for the screen from Major&#x27;s 1898 novel by Lawrence Edward Watkin. The film was shot at Denham Film Studios in the United Kingdom and was the third of Disney&#x27;s British film productions following &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Story of Robin Hood&quot; (1952). From January 4–11 1956, it was broadcast on American television as episodes 36–37 of Disney&#x27;s Sunday night anthology program &quot;Disneyland&quot; on ABC-TV in two parts under the title of the original source material.

== Plot ==
Mary Tudor falls in love with a new arrival to court, Charles Brandon. She persuades her brother King Henry VIII to make him his Captain of the Guard. Meanwhile, Henry is determined to marry her off to the aging King Louis XII of France as part of a peace agreement. Mary&#x27;s longtime suitor the Duke of Buckingham takes a dislike to Charles as he is a commoner and the Duke wants Mary for himself. However, troubled by his feelings for the princess, Brandon resigns and decides to sail to the New World. Against the advice of her lady-in-waiting Lady Margaret, Mary dresses up like a boy and follows Brandon to Bristol. Henry&#x27;s men find them and throw Brandon in the Tower of London. King Henry agrees to spare his life if Mary will marry King Louis and tells her that when Louis dies she is free to marry whomever she wants. Meanwhile, Mary asks the Duke of Buckingham for help but he only pretends to help Brandon escape from the Tower, really planning to have him killed while escaping. The duke thinks he is drowned in the Thames, but he survives.

Mary marries King Louis and encourages him to drink to excess and be active so that his already deteriorating health worsens. His heir Francis makes it clear that he will not return Mary to England after the king&#x27;s death, but keep her for himself. When she goes to him for help, the Duke of Buckingham tells Lady Margaret that Brandon is dead and decides to go &quot;rescue&quot; Mary himself. Lady Margaret discovers that Brandon is alive and learning of the duke&#x27;s treachery they hurry back to France. Louis dies and the Duke of Buckingham arrives in France to bring Mary back to England. He tells her that Brandon is dead and tries to force her to marry him. Charles arrives in time, rescues her and wounds the duke in a duel. Mary and Brandon are married and remind Henry of his promise to let her pick her second husband. He forgives them and makes Charles Duke of Suffolk.

==Production==
At the end of 1948, funds from Walt Disney Productions stranded in foreign countries, including the United Kingdom, exceeded $8.5 million. Walt Disney decided to create a studio in Britain, RKO-Walt Disney British Productions, Ltd. in association with RKO Radio Pictures and started production of &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1950). With the success of &quot;Robin Hood and His Merrie Men&quot; (1952), Disney wanted to keep the production team to make a second film; he chose &quot;The Sword and the Rose&quot; inspired by the novel &quot;When Knighthood Was in Flower&quot; (1898) by Charles Major. This team consisted of the director Ken Annakin, producer Douglas Pierce, writer Lawrence Edward Watkin, and the artistic director Carmen Dillon.

The film was officially announced in June 1952. In July the title was changed from &quot;When Knighthood was in Flower&quot; to &quot;The Sword and the Rose&quot;.

At the beginning of production, Annakin and Dillon went to Burbank, Disney Studios in order to develop the script and set the stage with storyboards, a technique used by Annakin on production of &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. During this step, each time a batch of storyboards was finished, it was presented to Walt Disney who commented and brought his personal touch. Annakin was granted great freedom with the dialogue.

Walt Disney came to oversee the production of the film in the UK from June to September 1952. The team spent several months researching period details to make the film more realistic. Working in pre-production had helped reduce the need for natural settings in favor of studio sets designed by Peter Ellenshaw. Ellenshaw painted sets for 62 different scenes in total. According to Leonard Maltin, Ellenshaw&#x27;s work was such that it is sometimes impossible to tell where the painting ends and reality begins.

Annakin later wrote: &quot;I had learned on &quot;Robin Hood&quot; that if you agreed to work for Walt, you must sublimate some of your own opinions and judgements and faithfully try to interpret the Master’s vision. He paid well, provided wonderful sets, actors and costumes, and clearly knew what his public wanted. Every time he came on to the set and concentrated on what I was doing, he would pick out something which might be elaborated or improved on — always something no one else had thought of. This was part of his show-biz genius.&quot;

Filming began in July 1952 at Pinewood Studios.

Todd was thrown from a horse while filming the trailer and was in bed for three weeks. There was a &quot;go slow&quot; strike at the studio during production.

It was distributed by RKO under a new arrangement between that film and Disney.

==Reception==
The film&#x27;s budget exceeded that of &quot;Robin Hood and His Merrie Men&quot;, but it earned only $2.5 million.

The film disappointed at the US box office but did better in other countries. However, the relative failure of this and &quot;Rob Roy, the Highland Rogue&quot; caused Disney to become less enthusiastic about costume pictures.

The film was serialized in the show &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;.

==Analysis==
Leonard Maltin surmised that &quot;The Sword and the Rose&quot; is historically equivalent to &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (1940) although it remains primarily a dramatic entertainment featuring costumed actors. However, it was greeted coolly in the UK mainly because of its historical approximations despite reviews from &quot;The Times&quot; that said that Mary had &quot;remarkably alive moments&quot; and James Robertson Justice&#x27;s King Henry had &quot;a royal air&quot;. On the other side of the Atlantic in the United States the &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewed the film as &quot;a time consuming tangle of mild satisfaction&quot;. Despite these criticisms, the team responsible for the film was reassembled for another film &quot;Rob Roy, the Highland Rogue&quot;.

Peter Ellenshaw&#x27;s work on set allowed him to get a &quot;lifetime contract&quot; with the Disney studio. He moved to the United States after the shooting of &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; (1954).

Douglas Brode draws a parallel between &quot;The Sword and the Rose&quot; and &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; (then in production) in which two female characters of noble lineage are enamored of a poor male character.

Steven Watts sees &quot;The Sword and the Rose&quot; and &quot;Rob Roy&quot; as showing the Disney studio&#x27;s concern for individual liberty fighting against powerful social structures and governments. He is joined in this opinion by Douglas Brode. Brode sees the film and the ball scene, not as a conservative, but as an incentive to &quot;dance crazes&quot; (as the twist) for the American youth of the 1950s and 1960s. The ballroom dancing bears more resemblance to a dance competition in the 1950s than to a minuet of pre-Elizabethan England. Brode sees a form of rebel involvement. The proximity of the dancers, and rhythms not resemble the flip is introduced to the court by Mary Tudor near the rebellious teenager. Moreover, Henry VIII took advantage of the proximity afforded by this dance to flirt with a young lady of his court. Brode cites the reply of Mary to the older Catherine of Aragon, who is shocked by this dance: &quot;Shall I not have what music and dances I like at my own ball?&quot;. Brode said that two years later rock and roll would similarly upset the American nation.

==Historical inaccuracies==
There are many historical inaccuracies in the film. Charles Brandon was actually a childhood friend of King Henry and not a newcomer to court as is depicted in the film; he had already received the title of Duke of Suffolk from Henry in 1514. Furthermore, the couple&#x27;s aborted attempt to sail to the New World never happened; indeed, this is an anachronism as the earliest serious English attempts at North American colonization would only occur under Queen Elizabeth I of England, some fifty years later. It was Brandon and not the Duke of Buckingham who escorted Mary back to England after the death of Louis. The duke&#x27;s involvement is purely fictitious and his wife Eleanor Percy is eliminated entirely from the story.

The Duke of Buckingham is also referred to as a Plantagenet, however, the real Buckingham&#x27;s closest Plantagenet ancestor was his great-great grandmother, Anne of Gloucester. In contrast, Mary Tudor&#x27;s nearest Plantagenet ancestor was her mother, the Plantagenet heiress Elizabeth of York.

King Henry is portrayed as a middle-aged and corpulent figure, although at the time he was only 23. His wife Catherine of Aragon is also shown as a brunette although she was a redhead.

<text>Gary Masyk (born 1960) is a businessman and politician in Alberta, Canada.

Born in High Prairie, Masyk owned Garco Oilfield Service and Masyk Lumber Company before entering politics. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta as a Progressive Conservative to represent Edmonton–Norwood in 2001.

Masyk once attracted controversy when he advocated sending criminals to work in salt mines. Masyk is probably best known for his highly controversial comments that ran in an &quot;Edmonton&quot; Journal column on February 27, 2003; elaborating on his proposal to send repeat offenders to Russian salt mines, Masyk seemingly praised the hardline intimidation tactics employed in Soviet Union gulags during the Stalinist era. Appearing to disparage human rights, Masyk was forced by Premier Ralph Klein to issue an apology on the following day.

On June 29, 2004, Masyk left the Tory caucus after Premier Klein&#x27;s health care policies became an issue and, according to Masyk, a factor in the outcome of the 2004 federal election. Masyk blamed Klein for the federal Conservative Party&#x27;s defeat, and joined the upstart Alberta Alliance. He became that party&#x27;s first Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). However, it was more likely that Masyk&#x27;s defection was an act of defiance to a party that chastised him and removed his seat from the Edmonton electoral map, making it difficult for Masyk to gain a new Conservative nomination.

Before the 26th Alberta general election, the Edmonton Norwood electoral district was merged with Edmonton Highlands. Although Masyk sought re-election in the November 22 vote, he ran in Edmonton—Decore to avoid a run against Alberta New Democratic Party leader, Brian Mason.

The Alliance proved to have little support in a city that was more interested in supporting a tight three-way race between the Tories, Liberals and NDP. On election day, Masyk placed fourth. Despite Masyk&#x27;s loss, he was replaced in the Legislature by Paul Hinman from Cardston-Taber-Warner as the sole Alliance representative.

<text>Oahu College (originally and later, Punahou School; 1853-1934) was located in Honolulu, Hawaii. It was a school for the children of Protestant missionaries serving throughout the Pacific region. It was the first school west of the Rocky Mountains and east of Asia with classes in English only. In 1795, King Kamehameha I overtook the land known as &quot;Ka Punahou&quot; in battle. Along with Ka Punahou, he gave a total of of land (from the slope of Round Top to the current Central Union Church, which included a tract of Kewalo Basin) to chief Kameeiamoku as a reward for his loyalty. After Kameeiamoku died, the land passed to his son, Ulumāheihei Hoapili, who lived there for 20 more years. When Hoapili left to become governor of Maui, he gave the land to his daughter, Kuini Liliha. Liliha and her husband, Oahu Governor Boki, gave Ka Punahou to Reverend Hiram Bingham, one of the first Protestant missionaries in Hawaii. Queen Kaahumanu was a strong supporter of the mission and built a house for herself near Bingham. A portion of the stone wall she had built to protect the compound from roaming cattle has been preserved. The first class was held on July 11, 1842, and had 15 students. Daniel Dole was Punahou&#x27;s first principal.

==History==
Early in the 1830s, the advantages of Punahou as a site for a boarding school were observed by the Mission, and long before Mr. Bingham&#x27;s return to the United States in 1840, he had fully approved of its being set apart for that purpose. At that period, no missionary could hold an individual title to land. The project of founding such a school was brought up in 1837, but postponed for financial reasons.

In the meeting of May 1841, the school was definitely founded, the sum of appropriated for the buildings, supplemented by private subscriptions, and Rev. Daniel Dole and his wife, who had just arrived, together with Miss Marcia Smith, were appointed teachers. During that year, the site was prepared under the direction of Mr. Chamberlain and Dr. Judd, a cellar dug, and one-story adobe thatched buildings erected, enclosing two courts, open towards the sea. Four additional rooms were built in 1844. They lasted for 40 years. Rice Hall was built in 1846, and Dole Hall in 1848.

The school was opened at Punahou, July 11, 1842, with 15 pupils in attendance. During the first year, there were 34 pupils, of whom 15 were boarders. In the summer of 1844, the faculty was reinforced by Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Rice, who were transferred from Hana, Maui, to assist in the school. where they remained till 1854, Mr. Rice having special charge of financial matters and of the out-of-door work.

A charter was granted by the government June 6, 1849, to the Trustees of the Punahou School, seven in number, empowering the Mission to fill all future vacancies in the corporation. The Rocky Hill pasture and the Manoa wood lot were purchased and enclosed during the same year. In 1855, the land of Punahou was conveyed by Royal Patent No. 1958, to the American Board, and by that body, of it, together with the buildings and improvements thereon, were deeded to the Trustees of Oahu College March 12, 1863.

The Old School House was built of stone quarried from Rocky Hill in 1852.

A new and enlarged charter was applied for and granted May 23, 1853, under the title of &quot;Oahu College,&quot; with thirteen Trustees, including the President. The Rev. E. G. Beckwith, who had conducted the Royal School with remarkable success for three years, was formally installed as President under the new charter, September 25, 1854.

In 1857, an effort was made to raise an endowment for the school, for which about was contributed in the United States, besides a special grant from the American Board of , and more to build the first President&#x27;s house, known as the &quot;Octagon.&quot; The Hawaiian Government afterwards granted the land of Hamakuapoko on Maui and three small lands on Kauai, the sale of which realized . In consideration of this grant to the endowment, the Government had the right of appointing two out of fifteen Trustees, until 1901.

In February, 1859, occurred the famous expedition of the faculty and twenty of the students on the schooner &quot;Kinoole&quot; to visit the great eruption of Mauna Loa of that year. On the 22nd of the following August, President Beckwith resigned on account of his wife&#x27;s ill health. The Rev. Eli Corwin acted as President pro tem. until the arrival of Rev. C. T. Mills in November, 1860.

When failing heaith obliged President Mills to resign his position in the summer of 1864, he had brought up the school from a position of partial dependence on the American Board to a self-supporting basis. Among the improvements made during his administration were the laying of water pipes from the spring to the buildings in 1861, and the addition of verandas to the old school hall in 1863, the funds for which were raised by a concert given by the school.

He was succeeded by Professor W. D. Alexander, who served seven years, retiring in the spring of 1871 to accept the position of surveyor-general.

The 25th anniversary of the founding of the school was celebrated June 15, 1866, with much enthusiasm. Professor Edward Payson Church was promoted to fill the place, which he occupied with much acceptance for four years. During this time two omnibuses were purchased by the Trustees, which were run between Nuuanu and Punahou until the inauguration of street tram cars in 1889. A small printing press was purchased by the students, and a small weekly newspaper, the &quot;Punahou Journal,&quot; published by them for several years. Mr. Amasa Pratt succeeded President Church, serving for three years. The Rev. William L. Jones then accepted the position, entering upon its duties in June 1878. The fortieth anniversary of the founding of the school was celebrated June 16, 1881, when a strong appeal was made to its friends for a building fund of . In 1880 the &quot;lower pasture,&quot; containing , was divided into building lots, and streets laid out in it. The sale of these lots has added to the endowment.

In 1882, was contributed to the building fund, and during the next year Bingham Hall was built under President Jones&#x27; supervision. In January, 1883, the Armstrong lot at the head of Richards street was purchased from the Roman Catholic Mission, and the Punahou Preparatory School opened there.

In the summer of that year, President Jones retired and was succeeded by the Rev. William Channing Merritt, who served for seven years.

In 1884, the Bishop Hall of Science was built and furnished with a laboratory by the liberality of Hon. C. R. Bishop. A house for the president was built by friends of the college in the fall of 1885. In 1888 a large swimming tank was added to the attractions of Punahou, to replace the old bathing pond which had been filled up. In the following year, was added to the endowment, of which sum was given by Hon. C. R. Bishop, and by other friends of the college.

After seven years of efficient service, Mr. Merritt retired in the summer of 1890, and was succeeded by Mr. Frank Alvan Hosmer, who served the college for ten years. On the 25th and 26 June 1891, the semi-centennial celebration of the founding of Punahou School was held, at which General S. C. Armstrong made the leading address. During this decade Pauahi Hall was built, at a cost of and dedicated May 21, 1896. This beautiful building was the gift of Hon. C. R. Bishop, the generous patron of education throughout these islands. The assembly hall was furnished with a pipe-organ by Mrs. Mary T. Castle. Much was also done to beautify the grounds, as well as to enlarge the courses of study.

President Hosmer resigned in Jun 1900, and was succeeded by Arthur Maxson Smith, Ph.D., who entered upon his duties September 17. The principal event of his administration was the removal of the Preparatory School to Punahou. Experience has shown the wisdom of this change. The corner stone of the building now known as Chas. R. Bishop Hall was laid with impressive ceremonies October 4, 1901. It was completed in the following summer at a cost of about , which was defrayed, as usual, by our constant benefactor whose name it bears.

During the year 1900, the &quot;upper pasture,&quot; now known as &quot;College Hills,&quot; was divided into building lots, (most of which have since been sold), and has now become the most attractive suburb of Honolulu. President Smith retired in June 1902, and was succeeded by Mr. Arthur Floyd Griffiths, who arrived here September 6, 1902. His accession has been followed by a period of unexampled progress in every department of the college.

On April 19, 1905, a memorial tablet was unveiled with appropriate ceremonies on the spot where Father Bingham&#x27;s cottage once stood. With the completion of the new buildings in course of erection, of the library and the athletic field, the college entered upon a new era of usefulness but lacked an adequate endowment.

<text>The Porto Metropolitan Area (; abbreviated as AMP) is a metropolitan area in northern Portugal centered on the City of Porto, Portugal&#x27;s second largest city. The metropolitan area, covering 17 municipalities, is the second largest urban area in the country and one of the largest in the European Union, with a population in 2021 of 1,737,395 in an area of 2,040.31 km².

The Porto Metropolitan Area is a major economic engine in Portugal, with a very high HDI (Human Development Index) and a GDP above the European average. Porto has been Portugal&#x27;s largest manufacturing region since the Industrial Revolution and is home to many of the country&#x27;s largest corporations.

It is chaired by Eduardo Vítor Rodrigues (PS).

==History==
The original &quot;Metropolitan Area of Porto&quot; was constituted by nine municipalities: Porto (the capital), Espinho, Gondomar, Maia, Matosinhos, Póvoa de Varzim, Vila Nova de Gaia, Valongo, and Vila do Conde. 
The process of enlargement: 
*Arouca (joined 08/01/2005)
*Oliveira de Azeméis (joined 01/09/2008)
*Paredes (joined 12/09/2013)
*São João da Madeira (joined 08/01/2005)
*Santa Maria da Feira (joined 08/01/2005)
*Santo Tirso (joined 08/01/2005)
*Trofa (joined (08/01/2005)
*Vale de Cambra (joined (01/09/2008)

==Government==

The metropolitan area is governed by the &quot;Junta Metropolitana do Porto&quot; (JMP), headquartered in Avenida dos Aliados, in downtown Porto under the presidency of Hermínio Loureiro, also the mayor of Oliveira de Azeméis municipality, since the Municipal Elections held in 2013, when he succeeded Rui Rio, mayor of Porto.

The &quot;Assembleia Metropolitana do Porto&quot; (Porto Metropolitan Assembly) is composed of 43 MPs, the PSD party has 20 seats, the PS 16, the CDS 3, CDU 3 and the BE, one.

Although the government has halted the intention of creating new metropolitan areas and urban communities, it is keen to ensure greater autonomy to Porto and Lisbon metropolitan areas.

==Urban areas and agglomeration==
The Porto metropolitan area is the second largest metropolitan area of Portugal, with about 1.7 million people. It groups the larger &quot;Porto Urban Area&quot;, the second largest in the country, assembled by the municipalities of Porto, Matosinhos, Vila Nova de Gaia, Gondomar, Valongo and Maia. It also includes three smaller urban areas: Póvoa de Varzim-Vila do Conde, Trofa-Santo Tirso and Santa Maria da Feira-São João da Madeira-Oliveira de Azeméis.

The urban-metropolitan agglomeration known as &quot;Porto Metropolitan Arch&quot; is a regional urban system of polycentric nature that encompasses the Porto Metropolitan Area and the sub-regions of Cávado, Ave and Tâmega e Sousa, including cities such as Braga and Guimarães.

==Population==
==Transportation==
The Metropolitan area is keen to develop its transportation network. Porto Metro is a Rapid transit system that links the municipalities of Porto, Vila Nova de Gaia, Matosinhos, Gondomar, Maia, Vila do Conde and Póvoa de Varzim.

The Porto/ Francisco de Sá Carneiro Airport / Pedras Rubras (OPO), between the municipalities of Maia, Matosinhos, and Vila do Conde, is also one of its greater investments. It was transformed from an old and obsolete airport to a modern transportation centre, linked to Porto Metro. The JMP is also trying to pressure the government to add a TGV line to link Vigo in Galicia to Porto Airport in order to make Porto the air traffic centre of the North-Western Iberian Peninsula and to tighten its historical ties with that Spanish province.

Greater Porto is served by a great number of Motorways linking the main central areas of the metropolitan region and the region with other main Portuguese cities (cidades portuguesas).
Main Harbour: Leixões (Matosinhos).
Motorways:
*A1 - Lisbon - Porto (North Motorway)
*A3 - Porto - Valença
*A4 - Porto - Quintanilha/Espanha
*A7 - Póvoa de Varzim - Vila Pouca de Aguiar
*A20 - Carvalhos - Nó de Francos (CRIP - Porto Inner-Ring Motorway)
*A28 - Porto - Caminha (Northern Littoral Motorway)
*A29 - Angeja - Porto
*A32 - Oliveira de Azeméis - Porto
*A41 - Perafita - Espinho (CREP - Porto Outer-Ring Motorway)
*A42 - A41 - Felgueiras
*A43 - Porto (A-20) - Aguiar de Sousa
*A44 - Gulpilhares (A29) - A20

<doc id="767107" wikidata="Q1319515" url="?curid=767107" title="Semi-Pelagianism">
<text>Semi-Pelagianism (or Semipelagianism) is a historical Christian theological and soteriological school of thought about the role of free will in salvation. In semipelagian thought, a distinction is made between the beginning of faith and the increase of faith. Semi-Pelagian thought teaches that the latter half – growing in faith – is the work of God, while the beginning of faith is an act of free will, with grace supervening only later. 

The term &quot;semi-Pelagianism&quot;, a 16th-century coinage, is considered a misnomer by many modern scholars.&quot;Semi-Pelagianism&quot; has frequently been used in a pejorative sense.

Semi-Pelagianism was, in the theory, originally developed as a compromise between Pelagianism and the teaching of Church Fathers such as Saint Augustine. Adherents to Pelagianism hold that people are born untainted by sin and do not need salvation unless they choose to sin, a belief which had been dismissed as heresy. In contrast, Augustine taught that people cannot come to God without the grace of God. Like Pelagianism, what is now called Semi-pelagianism was labeled heresy by the Western Church at the Second Council of Orange in 529.

In contrast, most Christian communions teach that the initiative for faith comes from God. Some, notably Catholics and Orthodox, teach that it then requires free collaboration on the part of man (synergism): &quot;The fatherly action of God is first on his own initiative, and then follows man&#x27;s free acting through his collaboration&quot;. &quot;Since the initiative belongs to God in the order of grace, no one can merit the initial grace of forgiveness and justification at the beginning of conversion. Moved by the Holy Spirit and by charity, we can then merit for ourselves and for others the graces needed for our sanctification, for the increase of grace and charity, and for the attainment of eternal life.&quot;

==Pelagian and semi-Pelagian theology==

Pelagianism is the teaching that people have the capacity to seek God in and of themselves apart from any movement of God or the Holy Spirit, and therefore that salvation is effected by their own efforts. The doctrine takes its name from Pelagius, a British monk who was accused of developing the doctrine (he himself appears to have claimed in his letters that man does not do good apart from grace, claiming only that all men have free will by God&#x27;s gift); it was opposed especially by Augustine of Hippo and was declared a heresy by Pope Zosimus in 418. Rejecting the existence of original sin, it teaches that man is in himself and by nature capable of choosing good.

In so-called Semi-Pelagian thought, both God and the human person always participate in the salvation process. Humans make free will choices, which are aided by God through creation, natural grace, &quot;supernatural&quot; grace, God&#x27;s restrictions on demonic invasion; God continually brings the human person to real choices, which God also aids, in the process of spiritual growth to be saved. The entire process is grace; snapshot focus on the specific moments of decision are always in the context of the overarching grace of God. Semipelagianism is similar to synergism, which is the traditional patristic doctrine.

==Patristic era==
The term &quot;Semi-Pelagianism&quot; was unknown in antiquity, appearing for the first time only in the last quarter of the 16th century in connection with Luis de Molina&#x27;s doctrine of grace: opponents of this theologian believed they saw a close resemblance to the views advocated by monks of Southern Gaul at and around Marseille after 428. 

Even after this confusion between the ideas of Molina and those of the monks of Marseille had been exposed as an error, the newly coined term &quot;Semi-Pelagianism&quot; was retained in learned circles as an apt designation for the views of those monks, most notably John Cassian, which were said to have aimed at a compromise between Pelagianism and Augustinism. It was condemned as heresy at the local Council of Orange (529) after disputes extending over more than a hundred years. The monks, however, consistent with the Desert Fathers, considered their teaching to be the ancient teaching of the Church.

Several historical teachings have been wrongly claimed to be semi-Pelagian without actually being about the issue of the priority of grace before human will. In particular, in the late 400s Gallic Bishop Faustus of Riez had answered a parishioner&#x27;s question about whether a deathbed confession by someone in mortal sin was legitimate: in Faustus&#x27; opinion there could be no effective absolution despite the decision to repent because there had been no satisfaction (public repudiation of sin, reparation, prayer, etc.) attempted. Faustus&#x27; formulation contradicted e.g. the declaration of Pope Celestine I in 1428 against &quot;despair in God&#x27;s mercy&quot; and was rebutted by the writings of Bishop Avitus of Vienne, that the intention to give satisfaction (if the sinner lived, in accordance with canon 13 of the First Council of Nicaea) was perfectly adequate for a genuine repentance. So Faustus&#x27; claims concern faith versus the necessity of penitence, not the priority of grace before human will.

==Development of the term and subsequent use==

===Early use of the term===
The first use of the term &quot;Semi-Pelagian&quot; was by Theodore Beza. The Epitome of the Lutheran Formula of Concord (1577) rejects &quot;the false dogma of the Semi-Pelagians, who teach that man by his own powers can commence his conversion, but can not fully accomplish it without the grace of the Holy Spirit&quot;.
Between 1590 and 1600, the term &quot;Semi-Pelagianism&quot; was applied to Luis de Molina&#x27;s doctrine of grace, which at that time was accused of similarity to the teaching of the Massilians.

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
The Orthodox Church generally emphasizes the synergistic doctrine of &quot;theosis&quot; in its conception of salvation as a process of personal transformation to the likeness of God in Christ through the Spirit. Theosis closely links the ideas of justification and sanctification; salvation is acquired through the divinization of man. This doctrine is sometimes dismissed as semipelagian by theologians of the classical Protestant traditions on the grounds that it suggests that man contributes to his own salvation. The accusation is rejected by Orthodox Christianity, which unlike the established Western traditions remained for the most part uninfluenced by Augustinian theology and holds that &quot;for the regenerated to do spiritual good – for the works of the believer being contributory to salvation and wrought by supernatural grace are properly called spiritual – it is necessary that he be guided and prevented [preceded] by grace … Consequently, he is not able of himself to do any work worthy of a Christian life&quot;.

John Cassian, known particularly for his teachings on theosis, is considered a Saint in the Eastern Churches as well as in Roman Catholicism. He is generally considered to have been an early proponent of semi-Pelagianism. But some recent scholars deny that his views were in fact semi-Pelagian. Lauren Pristas writes: &quot;For Cassian, salvation is, from beginning to end, the effect of God&#x27;s grace. It is fully divine.&quot; Augustine Casiday states that Cassian &quot;baldly asserts that God&#x27;s grace, not human free will, is responsible for &#x27;everything which pertains to salvation&#x27; – even faith&quot;. Others hold that &quot;the view of Cassian as the ringleader of &#x27;semi-Pelagianism&#x27; rests on a conjectural chronology&quot;. The Roman Catholic Church includes John Cassian in its official list of recognized saints, with a feast day on 23 July, and cites him in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. It did not endorse Augustine entirely and, while later Catholic theologians accepted Augustine&#x27;s authority, they interpreted his views in the light of writers such as Cassian. West and East consider both John Cassian and Augustine of Hippo as saints.

===Calvinism and Arminianism===
In more recent times, the term &quot;semi-pelagian&quot; has been used by some Reformed Protestants to label anyone who deviates from Augustinian doctrines of sovereignty, original sin and grace -- most notably Arminian Protestants and Roman Catholics. Although Calvinist and Lutheran theologies of salvation differ significantly on issues such as the nature of predestination and the salvific role of the sacraments (see means of grace), both branches of historic Protestantism claim the theology of Augustine as a principal influence.

Many Arminians have disagreed with this generalization, believing it is libelous to Jacobus Arminius (from whose name Arminianism derives) and the Remonstrants who maintained his &quot;Arminian&quot; views after his death. John Wesley (an Anglican defender of Arminianism and founder of Wesleyan Methodism) and other prominent classical and Wesleyan Arminians maintain a doctrine of sin that he called &quot;total corruption&quot; and &quot;entire deprivation&quot; of the human race, which is close but not identical to the Calvinist doctrine of original sin and total depravity. For Wesley, God is constantly seeking to recover his lost sheep, &quot;not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance&quot; (2 Peter 3:9, NIV). As theologian Thomas Oden describes Wesley&#x27;s view, prevenient grace &quot;begins to &quot;enable&quot; [not just &quot;aid&quot;, as in semi-pelagianism] one to choose further to cooperate with saving grace. By offering the will the restored capacity to respond to grace, the person then may freely and increasingly become an active, willing participant in receiving the conditions for justification.&quot;

===Jansenism and the Jesuits===
The Roman Catholic Church, as mentioned above, condemned semi-pelagianism at the Council of Orange (529), but also does not accept the Calvinist interpretation of Augustine. In the 18th century, the Jesuits accused the Jansenists of affirming the radical Augustinian doctrines of Calvinism; the Jansenists, in turn, accused the Jesuits of semipelagianism. The 1713 papal bull of Pope Clement XI, &quot;Unigenitus&quot;, in declaring Jansenism heretical, upheld the Jesuits&#x27; objections.

===Modern===
The term &quot;semi-Pelagianism&quot;, a 16th-century coinage, is considered a misnomer by many modern scholars. Proposed alternatives include semi-Augustinianism, anti-Augustinianism, and antipredestinarianism. The historical theological dispute is also known as the Augustinian controversy. &quot;Semi-Pelagianism&quot; has frequently been used in a pejorative sense.

<doc id="767123" wikidata="Q2603938" url="?curid=767123" title="The Singularity Is Near">
<text>The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology is a 2005 non-fiction book about artificial intelligence and the future of humanity by inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil. A sequel book, &quot;The Singularity Is Nearer&quot;, was released on June 25, 2024.

The book builds on the ideas introduced in Kurzweil&#x27;s previous books, &quot;The Age of Intelligent Machines&quot; (1990) and &quot;The Age of Spiritual Machines&quot; (1999). In the book, Kurzweil embraces the term &quot;the singularity&quot;, which was popularized by Vernor Vinge in his 1993 essay &quot;The Coming Technological Singularity.&quot;

Kurzweil describes his &quot;Law of Accelerating Returns&quot;, which predicts an exponential increase in technologies like computers, genetics, nanotechnology, robotics and artificial intelligence. Once the singularity has been reached, Kurzweil says that machine intelligence will be infinitely more powerful than all human intelligence combined. The singularity is also the point at which machines&#x27; intelligence and humans would merge; Kurzweil predicts this date: &quot;I set the date for the Singularity—representing a profound and disruptive transformation in human capability—as 2045&quot;.

==Content==

===Exponential growth===
Kurzweil characterizes evolution throughout all time as progressing through six epochs, each one building on the one before. He says the four epochs which have occurred so far are &quot;Physics and Chemistry&quot;, &quot;Biology and DNA&quot;, &quot;Brains&quot;, and &quot;Technology&quot;. Kurzweil predicts the singularity will coincide with the next epoch, &quot;The Merger of Human Technology with Human Intelligence&quot;. After the singularity he says the final epoch will occur, &quot;The Universe Wakes Up&quot;.

Kurzweil explains that evolutionary progress is exponential because of positive feedback; the results of one stage are used to create the next stage. Exponential growth is deceptive, nearly flat at first until it hits what Kurzweil calls &quot;the knee in the curve&quot; then rises almost vertically. In fact Kurzweil believes evolutionary progress is super-exponential because more resources are deployed to the winning process. As an example of super-exponential growth Kurzweil cites the computer chip business. The overall budget for the whole industry increases over time, since the fruits of exponential growth make it an attractive investment; meanwhile the additional budget fuels more innovation which makes the industry grow even faster, effectively an example of &quot;double&quot; exponential growth.

Kurzweil dictates evolutionary progress looks smooth, but that really it is divided into paradigms, specific methods of solving problems. Each paradigm starts with slow growth, builds to rapid growth, and then levels off. As one paradigm levels off, pressure builds to find or develop a new paradigm. So what looks like a single smooth curve is really series of smaller S curves. For example, Kurzweil notes that when vacuum tubes stopped getting faster, cheaper transistors became popular and continued the overall exponential growth.

Kurzweil calls this exponential growth the law of accelerating returns, and he believes it applies to many human-created technologies such as computer memory, transistors, microprocessors, DNA sequencing, magnetic storage, the number of Internet hosts, Internet traffic, decrease in device size, and nanotech citations and patents. Kurzweil cites two historical examples of exponential growth: the Human Genome Project and the growth of the Internet. Kurzweil claims the whole world economy is in fact growing exponentially, although short term booms and busts tend to hide this trend.

===Computational capacity===

A fundamental pillar of Kurzweil&#x27;s argument is that to get to the singularity, computational capacity is as much of a bottleneck as other things like quality of algorithms and understanding of the human brain. Moore&#x27;s Law predicts the capacity of integrated circuits grows exponentially, but not indefinitely. Kurzweil feels the increase in the capacity of integrated circuits will probably slow by the year 2020. He feels confident that a new paradigm will debut at that point to carry on the exponential growth predicted by his law of accelerating returns. Kurzweil describes four paradigms of computing that came before integrated circuits: electromechanical, relay, vacuum tube, and transistors. What technology will follow integrated circuits, to serve as the sixth paradigm, is unknown, but Kurzweil believes nanotubes are the most likely alternative among a number of possibilities:
nanotubes and nanotube circuitry, molecular computing, self-assembly in nanotube circuits, biological systems emulating circuit assembly, computing with DNA, spintronics (computing with the spin of electrons), computing with light, and quantum computing.

Since Kurzweil believes computational capacity will continue to grow exponentially long after Moore&#x27;s Law ends it will eventually rival the raw computing power of the human brain. Kurzweil looks at several different estimates of how much computational capacity is in the brain and settles on 1016 calculations per second and 1013 bits of memory. He writes that $1,000 will buy computer power equal to a single brain &quot;by around 2020&quot; while by 2045, the onset of the singularity, he says the same amount of money will buy one billion times more power than all human brains combined today. Kurzweil admits the exponential trend in increased computing power will hit a limit eventually, but he calculates that limit to be trillions of times beyond what is necessary for the singularity.

===The brain===

Kurzweil notes that computational capacity alone will not create artificial intelligence. He asserts that the best way to build machine intelligence is to first understand human intelligence. The first step is to image the brain, to peer inside it. Kurzweil claims imaging technologies such as PET and fMRI are increasing exponentially in resolution while he predicts even greater detail will be obtained during the 2020s when it becomes possible to scan the brain from the inside using nanobots. Once the physical structure and connectivity information are known, Kurzweil says researchers will have to produce functional models of sub-cellular components and synapses all the way up to whole brain regions. The human brain is &quot;a complex hierarchy of complex systems, but it does not represent a level of complexity beyond what we are already capable of handling&quot;.

Beyond reverse engineering the brain in order to understand and emulate it, Kurzweil introduces the idea of &quot;uploading&quot; a specific brain with every mental process intact, to be instantiated on a &quot;suitably powerful computational substrate&quot;. He writes that general modeling requires 1016 calculations per second and 1013 bits of memory, but then explains uploading requires additional detail, perhaps as many as 1019 cps and 1018 bits. Kurzweil says the technology to do this will be available by 2040. Rather than an instantaneous scan and conversion to digital form, Kurzweil feels humans will most likely experience gradual conversion as portions of their brain are augmented with neural implants, increasing their proportion of non-biological intelligence slowly over time.

Kurzweil believes there is &quot;no objective test that can conclusively determine&quot; the presence of consciousness. Therefore, he says nonbiological intelligences will claim to have consciousness and &quot;the full range of emotional and spiritual experiences that humans claim to have&quot;; he feels such claims will generally be accepted.

===Genetics, nanotechnology and robotics (AI)===
Kurzweil says revolutions in genetics, nanotechnology and robotics will usher in the beginning of the singularity. Kurzweil feels with sufficient genetic technology it should be possible to maintain the body indefinitely, reversing aging while curing cancer, heart disease and other illnesses. Much of this will be possible thanks to nanotechnology, the second revolution, which entails the molecule by molecule construction of tools which themselves can &quot;rebuild the physical world&quot;. Finally, the revolution in robotics will really be the development of strong AI, defined as machines which have human-level intelligence or greater. This development will be the most important of the century, &quot;comparable in importance to the development of biology itself&quot;.

Kurzweil concedes that every technology carries with it the risk of misuse or abuse, from viruses and nanobots to out-of-control AI machines. He believes the only countermeasure is to invest in defensive technologies, for example by allowing new genetics and medical treatments, monitoring for dangerous pathogens, and creating limited moratoriums on certain technologies. As for artificial intelligence Kurzweil feels the best defense is to increase the &quot;values of liberty, tolerance, and respect for knowledge and diversity&quot; in society, because &quot;the nonbiological intelligence will be embedded in our society and will reflect our values&quot;.

===The singularity===

Kurzweil touches on the history of the singularity concept, tracing it back to John von Neumann in the 1950s and I. J. Good in the 1960s. He compares his singularity to that of a mathematical or astrophysical singularity. While his ideas of a singularity is not actually infinite, he says it looks that way from any limited perspective.

During the singularity, Kurzweil predicts that &quot;human life will be irreversibly transformed&quot; and that humans will transcend the &quot;limitations of our biological bodies and brain&quot;. He looks beyond the singularity to say that &quot;the intelligence that will emerge will continue to represent the human civilization.&quot; Further, he feels that &quot;future machines will be human-like, even if they are not biological&quot;.

Kurzweil claims once nonbiological intelligence predominates the nature of human life will be radically altered: there will be radical changes in how humans learn, work and play. Kurzweil envisions nanobots which allow people to eat whatever they want while remaining thin and fit, provide copious energy, fight off infections or cancer, replace organs and augment their brains. Eventually people&#x27;s bodies will contain so much augmentation they&#x27;ll be able to alter their &quot;physical manifestation at will&quot;.

Kurzweil says the law of accelerating returns suggests that once a civilization develops primitive mechanical technologies, it is only a few centuries before they achieve everything outlined in the book, at which point it will start expanding outward, saturating the universe with intelligence. Since people have found no evidence of other civilizations, Kurzweil believes humans are likely alone in the universe. Thus Kurzweil concludes it is humanity&#x27;s destiny to do the saturating, enlisting all matter and energy in the process.

As for individual identities during these radical changes, Kurzweil suggests people think of themselves as an evolving pattern rather than a specific collection of molecules. Kurzweil says evolution moves towards &quot;greater complexity, greater elegance, greater knowledge, greater intelligence, greater beauty, greater creativity, and greater levels of subtle attributes such as love&quot;. He says that these attributes, in the limit, are generally used to describe God. That means, he continues, that evolution is moving towards a conception of God and that the transition away from biological roots is in fact a spiritual undertaking.

==Predictions==
Kurzweil does not include an actual written timeline of the past and future, as he did in &quot;The Age of Intelligent Machines&quot; and &quot;The Age of Spiritual Machines&quot;, however he still makes many specific predictions. Kurzweil writes that by 2010 a supercomputer will have the computational capacity to emulate human intelligence and &quot;by around 2020&quot; this same capacity will be available &quot;for one thousand dollars&quot;. After that milestone he expects human brain scanning to contribute to an effective model of human intelligence &quot;by the mid-2020s&quot;. These two elements will culminate in computers that can pass the Turing test by 2029. By the early 2030s the amount of non-biological computation will exceed the &quot;capacity of all living biological human intelligence&quot;. Finally the exponential growth in computing capacity will lead to the singularity. Kurzweil spells out the date very clearly: &quot;I set the date for the Singularity—representing a profound and disruptive transformation in human capability—as 2045&quot;.

==Reception==

===Analysis===
A common criticism of the book relates to the &quot;exponential growth fallacy&quot;. As an example, in 1969, humans landed on the moon. Extrapolating exponential growth from there one would expect huge lunar bases and crewed missions to distant planets. Instead, exploration stalled or even regressed after that. Paul Davies writes &quot;the key point about exponential growth is that it never lasts&quot; often due to resource constraints. On the other hand, it has been shown that the global acceleration until recently followed a hyperbolic rather than exponential pattern.

Theodore Modis says &quot;nothing in nature follows a pure exponential&quot; and suggests the logistic function is a better fit for &quot;a real growth process&quot;. The logistic function looks like an exponential at first but then tapers off and flattens completely. For example, world population and the United States&#x27;s oil production both appeared to be rising exponentially, but both have leveled off because they were logistic. Kurzweil says &quot;the knee in the curve&quot; is the time when the exponential trend is going to explode, while Modis claims if the process is logistic when you hit the &quot;knee&quot; the quantity you are measuring is only going to increase by a factor of 100 more.

While some critics complain that the law of accelerating returns is not a law of nature others question the religious motivations or implications of Kurzweil&#x27;s singularity. The buildup towards the singularity is compared with Judeo-Christian end-of-time scenarios. Beam calls it &quot;a Buck Rogers vision of the hypothetical Christian Rapture&quot;. John Gray says &quot;the Singularity echoes apocalyptic myths in which history is about to be interrupted by a world-transforming event&quot;.

The radical nature of Kurzweil&#x27;s predictions is often discussed. Anthony Doerr says that before you &quot;dismiss it as techno-zeal&quot; consider that &quot;every day the line between what is human and what is not quite human blurs a bit more&quot;. He lists technology of the day, in 2006, like computers that land supersonic airplanes or in vitro fertility treatments and asks whether brain implants that access the internet or robots in our blood really are that unbelievable.

In regard to reverse engineering the brain, neuroscientist David J. Linden writes that &quot;Kurzweil is conflating biological data collection with biological insight&quot;. He feels that data collection might be growing exponentially, but insight is increasing only linearly. For example, the speed and cost of sequencing genomes is also improving exponentially, but our understanding of genetics is growing very slowly. As for nanobots Linden believes the spaces available in the brain for navigation are simply too small. He acknowledges that someday humans will fully understand the brain, except not on Kurzweil&#x27;s mythical timetable.

===Reviews===
Paul Davies wrote in &quot;Nature&quot; that &quot;The Singularity is Near&quot; is a &quot;breathless romp across the outer reaches of technological possibility&quot; while warning that the &quot;exhilarating speculation is great fun to read, but needs to be taken with a huge dose of salt.&quot;

Anthony Doerr in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote &quot;Kurzweil&#x27;s book is surprisingly elaborate, smart, and persuasive. He writes clean methodical sentences, includes humorous dialogues with characters in the future and past, and uses graphs that are almost always accessible.&quot; while his colleague Alex Beam points out that &quot;Singularitarians have been greeted with hooting skepticism&quot;. Janet Maslin in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;The Singularity is Near&quot; is startling in scope and bravado&quot;, but says &quot;much of his thinking tends to be pie in the sky&quot;. She observes that he&#x27;s more focused on optimistic outcomes rather than the risks.

==Film adaptations==

In 2006, Barry Ptolemy and his production company Ptolemaic Productions licensed the rights to &quot;The Singularity Is Near&quot; from Kurzweil. Inspired by the book, Ptolemy directed and produced the film &quot;Transcendent Man&quot;, which went on to bring more attention to the book.

Kurzweil also directed his own film adaptation, produced in partnership with Terasem; &quot;The Singularity is Near&quot; mixes documentary interviews with a science-fiction story involving his robotic avatar Ramona&#x27;s transformation into an artificial general intelligence. Screened at the World Film Festival, the Woodstock Film Festival, the Warsaw International FilmFest, the San Antonio Film Festival in 2010 and the San Francisco Indie Film Festival in 2011, the movie was released generally on July 20, 2012. It is available on DVD or digital download.

<text>The Little Joe 1B was a launch escape system test of the Mercury spacecraft, conducted as part of the U.S. Mercury program. The mission also carried a female rhesus monkey (&quot;Macaca mulatta&quot;) named Miss Sam in the Mercury spacecraft. The mission was launched January 21, 1960, from Wallops Island, Virginia. The Little Joe 1B flew to an apogee of 9.3 statute miles (15.0 km) and a range of 11.7 miles (18.9 km) out to sea. Miss Sam survived the 8 minute 35 second flight in good condition. The spacecraft was recovered by a Marine helicopter and returned to Wallops Island within about 45 minutes. Miss Sam was one of many monkeys used in space travel research.

<text>Auray (; , or simply ) is a commune in the Morbihan department, administrative region of Brittany, northwestern France.

Inhabitants of Auray are called &quot;Alréens&quot; (French) and &quot;Alreiz&quot; (Breton).

==Geography==
The city is surrounded by the communes of Crac&#x27;h to the south and the west, Brech to the north and Pluneret to the east. It is crossed by the Loch, a small coastal river, which flows into the Gulf of Morbihan. The town is high on the west bank of the river Auray on the edge of the Armorican plateau which is cut deeply by the river. The port of Saint-Goustan is also in the valley, east of the river.

==History==

The Battle of Auray on 29 September 1364 was the last battle of the Breton War of Succession. Kerblois, the place in Brech at which the defeated Charles de Blois was killed is marked by a crucifix.

In 1632, sailors departed from the port of Saint-Goustan to re-capture the town of Port Royal in Acadia on behalf of Cardinal Richelieu.

Benjamin Franklin arrived at the port of Saint-Goustan on 3 December 1776 at the beginning of the US War of Independence to seek military aid from Louis XVI.

In 1795, after the failure of the Quiberon Expedition, part of the royalist Chouannerie rebellion, and the surrender of the Armée des émigrés ordered by Sombreuil on 21 July, most prisoners were transferred to Auray. After a summary trial by a military commission made up of citizens of the town, 750 people were shot and buried in a meadow in Brech on the western shore of the Loch, now called the &quot;Champ des martyrs&quot; (). In 1829, their bones were exhumed and deposited in the vault of a memorial chapel at the Auray monastery.

The railway station was strategically important during the Second World War. Concrete used to build bunkers on the region&#x27;s beaches travelled through the station. After the war, the collection of military scrap material led to the creation of business in Pi-park.

==Heraldry==

Auray&#x27;s historic coat of arms: A shield of or and azure lozenges.
Auray&#x27;s modern coat of arms: A field of gules, a stoat running with a floating scarf of ermine. A charge of azure with three fleur-de-lis of or.

==Population==
==Language==

Historically, the people of Auray have spoken the Vannes dialect of Breton but the citizens spoke French from the eighteenth century onwards. Breton was used for preaching in Auray parishes until the 1930s. In September 2008, 3.27% of children enrolled in primary schools in the town were bilingual.

==Transport==
===Port===
The port of Saint-Goustan is the site of the original town. It is located on the River Auray at the highest tidal reach of the river that ships can access. It was open to ships until the nineteenth century and was also a trading port which was particularly active in its routes with Spain and Britain. The decline of trade in the port began with the arrival of the railway in 1862 and today it is a marina and port of call on tours of the Gulf of Morbihan.

===Roads===
Saint-Goustan, located in the lower town, was the first point at which the river could be bridged on the coastal road between Vannes and Quimper. Downstream, the River Auray is wide and steep. Upstream, the marshes of the Loch valley makes passage difficult to Tréauray which is 4 km to the north. The Roman road from Lyon to Gésocribate (Le Conquet) via Nantes, passes the commune.

In the mid-19th century, the construction of a new road on an embankment on the marshes of Loch allowed direct access to the town from Vannes. In 1950, the Vannes-Lorient route nationale bypassed the centre of Auray to the north. In 1989, the four-carriageway Kerplouz viaduct was built on the RN165 over the Auray river downstream from St. Goustan. This rid the town of transit traffic, and created an industrial area south of the city centre.

===Railways===
Auray railway station is located on the Savenay - Landerneau line and marks the end of the Auray - Quiberon line. The station was inaugurated at the opening of the Rennes - Redon and the Savenay - Landerneau lines on 26 September 1862.

On 18 December 1864, a rail link to Pontivy was opened. The building of the Pontivy - Saint-Brieuc section in 1872 completed a route that crosses Brittany from the south to the north. The Pontivy - Auray section was closed to passenger traffic on 2 October 1949 but is still used for transporting goods.

On 24 July 1882, the Auray-Quiberon line was opened. Known as the &quot;Tire-bouchon&quot; (), it currently runs only in the summer.

Auray station is located more than 2 km north of the town centre because of the problem of building a viaduct crossing the Loch Valley. A new area was developed in the late 19th century along the road from Brech which has a junction with the Lorient road at the northern exit of the town next to the station. In particular, the Saint-Goustan port trading companies created premises there. The establishment of a train depot and a maintenance workshop for locomotives in the early 20th century attracted a greater workforce.

Today, the station is served by the Paris - Rennes - Quimper TGV and Brittany TER. In the summer, the station experiences a significant increase in activity. It is one of the boarding points for the car-train service and the Auray - Quiberon line has been reopened to passenger traffic. The freight business is very small, like everywhere else in Morbihan.

==Sights==

* The port of Saint-Goustan.
* The church of St Gildas. Built in 1636 and classified as a historic monument, it contains an altar-piece from Laval and a 19th-century organ.
* The Chapel of the Holy Spirit. Built in the thirteenth century, it is the last remnant of the headquarters of the Montpellier Ordre du Saint-Esprit. In the fourteenth century, this &quot;Maison Magistrale Conventuelle et Hospitalière du Saint-Esprit à Auray&quot;, referred to in 1289 by Jean Monette, would become one of the major houses in France and, under his authority, one of some fifty foundations. In 1762, Pope Clement XIII abolished the Ordre du Saint-Esprit. Auray installed the headquarters of a general hospital on the site and later, in 1790, a military hospital. In the early 19th century, what remains of the buildings was converted into a barracks. Restoration work took place from 1990-1994 which returned the chapel to its earlier form and it has taken the name of Caserne Dugesclin. The restoration has allowed the building to regain its original form: a unique space of five spans and a shape uncommon to Brittany. The building was classed as a historical monument on 4 November 1982.
* The Town Hall, built in the 18th century has been a historical monument since 1963.
* The church of Saint-Sauveur. Built in the 19th century (its door dates to the sixteenth century), it contains a model battleship armory dating from 1865.

* The Chapel of Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes (1862–1878).
* The Saint-Goustan bridge. The first mention of a stone bridge linking the lower town to the upper is from the thirteenth century. In 1464, after its rebuilding, it was renamed Pont Neuf. Its final form dates to 1752 and its last restoration was in 1983. A toll-house building is on the right-hand-side.
* The Chazelles fountain. Located on the Martin dock, it dates from 1821 and was used to supply water to people and passing boats.
* The Auray monastery, north of the Auray railway station, is in Brech.

<text>The Calapooya Mountains are a mountain range in Lane and Douglas counties of southwestern Oregon in the United States. The range runs for approximately west from the Cascade Range between Eugene on the north and Roseburg on the south.

== Geology ==

The Calapooya Mountains are composed of volcanic rocks and newer sedimentary strata. The mountains have been deeply eroded by the Coast Fork Willamette River and its tributaries. In the southern drainage, the tributaries of the North Umpqua River have cut into the southern slopes. The soil is silty, clay loam formed from sandstone, sediment, and igneous rocks.

== Topography ==

The Calapooya Mountains and the Calapooya Divide are two parts of a spur of the Western Cascade mountains in the U.S. state of Oregon that form the divide between the watersheds of the Willamette and Umpqua rivers. At its southeastern end, the spur joins the Cascade Range near Cowhorn Mountain near the headwaters of the Middle Fork Willamette River and the North Umpqua River. A topographic map in the &quot;Atlas of Oregon&quot; shows the Calapooya Mountains curving northwest from near Potter, McGowan, and Balm mountains past Bohemia Mountain to Holland Point, south of Oakridge. From near Bohemia Mountain, a block of mountains connected to the Calapooya Mountains runs due west along the border between Lane and Douglas counties to the vicinity of Interstate 5 (I-5) near Rice Hill. This block is known as the Calapooya Divide. To the north along I-5 are Cottage Grove and Eugene and to the south are Sutherlin and Roseburg.

Streams flowing south from the Calapooyas into the North Umpqua River include Steamboat, Canton, and Rock creeks, while Calapooya Creek flows west from the divide into the Umpqua main stem. Streams flowing north or east into the Middle Fork Willamette River include Tumblebug, Staley, Coal, and Packard creeks. Flowing northwest or west into the Coast Fork Willamette River or its major tributary, the Row River, are Brice, Layng, and Mosby creeks and Big River. The Umpqua flows west through the Oregon Coast Range to the Pacific Ocean at Reedsport, while the Willamette flows north to the Columbia River, which flows northwest to the Pacific Ocean at Astoria.

The highest peaks in the range include Balm Mountain at above sea level, Potter Mountain at , and McGowan Mountain at , all near the southeastern end of the range. Along the divide, Huckleberry Mountain in the east rises to , while Ben More Mountain near I-5 is only high. Bohemia Mountain and its close neighbor Fairview Peak reach identical peak elevations of , while Holland Point near Oakridge is high.

== Climate ==

The climate in the Calapooya Mountains follows a pattern of wet winters and dry summers. Precipitation generally increases with elevation, ranging from an average of per year in the valleys to on the mountain peaks. Above , a significant part of this falls as snow.

== History ==

Throughout the history of the region, the range has provided a geographic and cultural barrier between the Willamette Valley and the Umpqua Valley, effectively separating Western Oregon from Southern Oregon. In the 19th century, it separated the tribal domains of the Kalapuya and Umpqua tribes of Native Americans. During the 1840s, the mountains proved a barrier to white settlers seeking to move into southern Oregon or to move southward to the California gold fields. The Applegate Trail, blazed in the late 1840s, provided the first reliable path for white settlement through the western end of the mountains. Interstate 5 essentially follows the route of the trail between Eugene and Roseburg.

The mountains have been an important timber source in the 20th century. The eastern end of the mountains are largely within the Umpqua National Forest in the south and Willamette National Forest in the north.

<doc id="767137" wikidata="Q7318424" url="?curid=767137" title="Revised English Bible">
<text>The Revised English Bible (REB) is a 1989 English-language translation of the Bible that updates the New English Bible (NEB) of 1970. As with its predecessor, it is published by the publishing houses of both the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. It is not to be confused with the &quot;Revised English Bible&quot; of 1877, which was an annotated and slightly emended King James Bible.

==Translation philosophy==
The REB is the result of both advances in scholarship and translation made since the 1960s and also a desire to correct what have been seen as some of the NEB&#x27;s more egregious errors (for examples of changes, see the references). The changes remove many of the most idiosyncratic renderings of the NEB, moving the REB more in the direction of standard translations such as the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) or the New International Version (NIV).

The translation is intended to take account of gender-inclusive usage, though not to the same extent as translations such as the NRSV. Psalm 1 offers an illustration of the REB&#x27;s middle-ground approach to gender-inclusive language. On one side are more literal translations, such as the King James Version (KJV), Revised Standard Version (RSV), and the English Standard Version (ESV), that use the word &quot;man&quot; and the masculine singular pronoun in Psalm 1. The RSV/ESV, for example, read &quot;Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked...; but his delight is in the law of the Lord.&quot; On the other side are more dynamic translations aiming for gender-inclusivity, such as the NRSV, that avoid exclusively masculine English nouns and pronouns. For instance, in Psalm 1, the NRSV uses plurals: &quot;Happy are those who do not follow the advice of the wicked...; but their delight is in the law of the Lord.&quot; By comparison, the REB walks a middle path between both approaches. In Psalm 1, the REB avoids using a male noun (&quot;man&quot;) while also retaining the masculine singular pronouns (&quot;his&quot;): &quot;Happy is the one who does not take the counsel of the wicked for a guide... His delight is in the law of the Lord.&quot;

The style of the REB has been described as more &quot;literary&quot; than that of the NRSV or NIV. It tends slightly further in the direction of &quot;dynamic equivalence&quot; than those translations, but still translates Hebrew poetry as poetry and reflects at least some of the characteristics of that poetry. The REB&#x27;s general accuracy and literary flavour have led Stephen Mitchell and others to praise it as one of the best English language renderings. The translators of the REB gave particular attention to its suitability for public reading, especially in the Book of Psalms.

According to the American Bible Society, the NEB had a &quot;considerable British flavor&quot; but the REB &quot;removed much of this distinctiveness and aimed to be more accessible to an international audience&quot;.

The REB is authorised for liturgical use in the Episcopal Church, Church of England, and Anglican Church of Canada.

<text>James Edwin &quot;Ted&quot; Meredith (November 14, 1891 – November 2, 1957) was an American athlete, winner of two gold medals at the 1912 Summer Olympics.

==Biography==
Meredith made the 1912 Olympic team shortly after his graduation from Williamson Free School of Mechanical Trades in 1911 while he was a student at Mercersburg Academy under Scots-American coach Jimmy Curran. In Stockholm, he won a gold medal in the 800 m run with a world record 1:51.9. He ran on to the 880 yard mark and also set a world record for that distance with a 1:52.5. He won another gold medal on the 4 × 400 m relay team, also taking fourth in the 400 metres competition.

Williamson Free School of Mechanical Trades now has the largest repository of Olympic great Meredith memorabilia in existence thanks to Jack Lemon, author of the book &quot;Immortal of the Cinder Path – The Saga of James &#x27;Ted&#x27; Meredith&quot; who donated his entire collection of Meredith memorabilia recently.

After Stockholm, Meredith entered the University of Pennsylvania. He was the IC4A 440 yards champion from 1914 to 1916 and the 880 yard champion in 1914 and 1915. He also won the AAU 440 yard title in 1914 and 1915. In 1916, he set a world record in the 440 yards of 47.4, which wasn&#x27;t broken until 1928. In the same year, he lowered his own world 880 yard record to 1:52.2. In April 1915, he ran the last lap for the University of Pennsylvania team that broke the world mile relay record. Requiring a time of 48 3/5 seconds, he proceeded to run 48 2/5. Also part of the quartet was Donald Lippincott.

Meredith retired from competition in 1917 and served in the army during World War I. He made a comeback for the 1920 Summer Olympics, where he was eliminated in the semifinal of the 400 metres competition and ran on the relay team that finished fourth in the 4 × 400 m relay event.

After his second retirement from competition, he became a real estate broker but retained an active interest in athletics. In 1924, he attended the Olympic Games in Paris as a reporter, working for the Christy Walsh Syndicate. In 1928, he was hired as an assistant coach at the University of Pennsylvania under Lawson Robertson. In 1936, he attended the Olympic Games in Berlin as the coach of the Czechoslovakia team. During 1937 and 1938, he trained the Cuban team for the Central American Games.

==Death and funeral==
Meredith&#x27;s funeral service was held in Haddonfield, New Jersey. Attendees were a roll call of early 20th century American and Pennsylvanian sports, including Jimmy Curran, Earl Eby, Donald Lippincott, Sherman Landers, Wallace McCurdy, Larry Brown, Joe Lockwood, Robert Bolger, Joe Berry, Allie Miller, Ed Harter, and Paul Costello.

<text>Access Grid is a collection of resources and technologies that enables large format audio and video based collaboration between groups of people in different locations. The Access Grid is an ensemble of resources, including multimedia large-format displays, presentation and interactive environments, and interfaces with grid computing middleware and visualization environments. In simple terms, it is advanced videoconferencing using big displays and with multiple simultaneous camera feeds at each node (site). The technology was invented at Argonne National Laboratory, Chicago.

The &quot;Alliance Chautauqua 99&quot;, a series of two-day conferences on computational science organised by the NCSA, was the first large-scale Access Grid event. The Access Grid was later demonstrated at Supercomputing&#x27;99 in Portland to an international audience. 

 there are well over 500 nodes around the world that allow for various forms of creative and academic collaborations. Access Grid users tend to use XMPP as their text-based back-end. Indeed, the new version of the Access Grid Toolkit integrates an XMPP client with the Access Grid software.
==International Access Grid==
===Australia and New Zealand===

The Access Grid has generated interest and activity in Australia, where factors such as widely disparate geographic locations and relatively low population-densities have previously presented great obstacles to &quot;in-person&quot; collaborations.

The International Centre of Excellence for Education in Mathematics (ICE-EM) have funded 10 Australian universities to construct nodes. The nodes allow the mathematics postgraduate community and professionals access to international experts who are visiting Australia. The nodes also provide a means of carrying out collaborative research with peers within Australia and internationally.

Australia&#x27;s first Access Grid node was built at Sydney VisLab at the Australian Technology Park in August 2001.

By 2007 the Australian AG network has grown to more than 30 sites serviced by Asia Pacific Access Grid (APAG) venue servers at University of Sydney (AG2) and University of Queensland (AG3).

The University of Queensland began providing AG facilities in 2002, with increasing usage every year since then. In 2004, the UQ Vislab began providing the Access Grid installation packages for various Linux distributions, as well as FreeBSD, to the wider AG community, although intellectual property concerns have placed the future of the Linux-based technologies into doubt. It has also been active in developing various enhancements and add-ons including shared applications for remote sensor monitoring shared application, Remote Thermo
and shared GIS based on 
GRASS.

By December 2006 each New Zealand university has an operational AG node, and use of the grid is increasing.

Current development work includes a 
federated data management using Storage Resource Broker (SRB)
and high definition video communications.

===United Kingdom===

UK academic community support for Access Grid Toolkit, IOCOM and EVO technologies on JANET is provided by the JANET Videoconferencing Management Centre.

The first Access Grid (AG) node was built at the University of Manchester in 2001, with Jisc-funded support from the Access Grid Support Centre (AGSC) in Manchester from April 2004 to July 2011. There are now over three hundred AG nodes registered in the UK, ranging from full room nodes to small individual desktop nodes.

There are a number of academic projects using AG technologies such as the Taught Course Centre and MAGIC (postgraduate mathematics) mathematics projects.

<doc id="767143" wikidata="Q671299" url="?curid=767143" title="Amphibalus">
<text>Amphibalus is a venerated early Christian priest said to have converted Saint Alban to Christianity. He occupied a place in British hagiography almost as revered as Alban himself. According to many hagiographical accounts, including those of Gildas, Bede, Geoffrey of Monmouth, and Matthew of Paris, Amphibalus was a Roman Christian fleeing religious persecution under Emperor Diocletian. Amphibalus was offered shelter by Alban in the Roman city of Verulamium, in modern-day England. Alban was so impressed with the priest&#x27;s faith and teaching that he began to emulate him in worship, and eventually became a Christian himself. When Roman soldiers came to seize Amphibalus, Alban put on Amphibalus&#x27; robes and was punished in his place. According to Matthew Paris, after Alban&#x27;s martyrdom, the Romans eventually caught and martyred Amphibalus as well.

==Name and authenticity==
Gildas (), Bede () and the three texts of Alban&#x27;s &quot;Passio,&quot; going back as far as the 5th century, do not name Amphibalus in their accounts of Alban. They refer to Amphibalus not as a saint but simply as a priest and do not report his martyrdom. Amphibalus gained his name and title when Geoffrey of Monmouth wrote his (&quot;History of the Kings of Britain)&quot; in the 12th-century. It is possible that Geoffrey had been repeating a name for the priest that had come into common usage in his time, but it is also possible that Geoffrey misunderstood the Latin word used for the cloak, &quot;amphiboles&quot;, which was worn by Alban.

Wilhelm Levison noted that the story of the name, which goes back to a 5th-century &quot;Passio Albani&quot;, is composed of borrowings from other lives of saints and it has, in his words, &quot;no place in the ranks of &quot;Acta martyrum sincera&quot;; it is a legendary tale...&quot;

==Geoffrey of Monmouth==
Geoffrey repeated the story of Alban&#x27;s martyrdom as given by Bede in his famous &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (c. 1136), with the addition of the name of the confessor he shelters, &quot;Amphibalus&quot;. He recounts a church of Amphibalus at Winchester where King Constantine consigned his son, Constans, to become a monk and where another, later, Constantine killed one of the sons of Mordred. Geoffrey may have gotten the name from Gildas, who describes his contemporary, Constantine, King of &quot;Dumnonia&quot;, as having dressed in the &quot;amphibalo&quot;, or &#x27;cloak&#x27;, of an abbot to murder two royal youths in a church. This could also be the inspiration for Geoffrey&#x27;s story about the murder of the son of Mordred, and his association of Amphibalus&#x27; church with kings called Constantine. How, or why the story about Alban became connected to the story of king Constantine remains somewhat mysterious, but might be an effect of Geoffrey&#x27;s enterprising imagination, and confusion of sources.

==New cult invented in 12th-century==
Other details about Amphibalus&#x27;s cult originate with texts that appear to have been written with the purpose of creating a new cult, particularly to give a supportive context to the &quot;inventio&quot;, or &#x27;discovery&#x27;, of the body of Amphibalus at Redbourn, near St Albans in 1177. The texts were produced at St Albans Abbey in the second half of the 12th-century written by a monk, William of St Albans, during the abbacy of Simon (1167–1183). He provided an elaborate version of the story of Saint Alban and gave a prominent role in it to a new martyr-saint, Amphibalus, whose name he states to have found in Geoffrey&#x27;s work.

Wilhelm Levison, stated that: &quot;The abbey had incurred heavy debts; anyone who knows the medieval misuse of pious belief and offering, will not be surprised to learn that just at this time the generosity of the devotees was stimulated by the discovery of the history and, what is more, of the relics of St Amphibalus.&quot; Benjamin Gordon-Taylor also suggests that &quot;a principal motive for the initiation of the cult of St Amphibalus was the success of the cult of St Thomas of Canterbury&quot; (murdered in 1170).

The new story about Amphibalus that emerged (see below) is based on associations with Saint Alban. Wilhelm Levison noted, that in the 6th-century account of Gildas were another two martyrs, Julius and Aaron, said to have been martyred together by the 8th-century at Urbs Legionis, identified as Caerleon in Wales. Meanwhile, the large number of people supposedly martyred together with Amphibalus may have their origin in a mistranscription made in the course of the transmission of the &quot;Martyrologium Hieronymianum&quot; (St Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Martyrology&quot;), which connected the large number of martyrs originally associated with Rufinus of Alexandria, with Alban, under the date of 22 June.

The location of the &quot;inventio&quot; at Redbourn was discovered near ancient Anglo-Saxon burial mounds. There were two knives said to have been found with Amphibalus, typical of an ancient pagan Anglo-Saxon burial.

Gordon-Taylor notes that: &quot;The cult of St. Amphibalus and his companions is unique in late twelfth-century England ... in that we are seeing a cult beginning almost from scratch.&quot; This phenomenon bears witness to the influence of Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum&quot; at the time which lay behind the discovery of the grave of King Arthur at Glastonbury Abbey. This was around the same time that the bodies of Amphibalus and his companions were discovered, which Gordon-Taylor suggests was also motivated in part by competition with the new Canterbury cult of St Thomas Becket to gain pilgrims.

==Hagiography==
Most of what is known of Amphibalus&#x27;s life is derived from hagiographic texts centred on Alban, written hundreds of years after his death. He was believed to be a citizen of Caerleon during the 3rd or 4th century. During a religious persecution, Alban sheltered Amphibalus from persecutors in his home. The priest was believed to be pious and faithful, and while in Alban&#x27;s home he prayed and kept watch day and night. He instructed Alban with &quot;wholesome admonitions&quot;, influencing Alban to abandon his previous religious beliefs and follow Amphibalus in the Christian faith. Alban was so inspired by his guest that he chose to sacrifice his own life in order to save Amphibalus. 

After the martyrdom of Alban, Amphibalus was believed to have returned to Caerleon, where he converted many others to Christianity, including the saints Julius and Aaron. It is believed that he was eventually captured by the Romans and returned to Verulamium, where he was killed for his faith. Where and how he was killed is unclear. Some sources say he was beheaded others say he was stabbed. A later version of the legend says that Amphibalus and some companions were stoned to death a few days afterwards at Redbourn, four miles from St. Albans. Amphibalus is known for being one of four martyrs of the early Christian church in Roman Britain along with Albus, Julius and Aron. There is little known about any of the four early saints except that they seemed to all be acquainted with each other.

In 1178, some 800 years after Amphibalus&#x27; traditional death date, his remains were discovered at Redbourn in Hertfordshire, England, near the town of St Albans. According to the tale, Saint Alban appeared in a vision to a monk named Robert, indicating that he wished to make the location of the remains of Amphibalus known. Robert followed the spirit of Alban and was led by the saint to the remains of Amphibalus and his companions. Healing miracles were performed immediately, and the abbot ordered the site to be excavated. Several bodies were discovered, and one body seemed consistent with the manner of Amphibalus&#x27; death. The body believed to belong to Amphibalus was moved to St Alban&#x27;s, where a shrine was constructed for the veneration of the relics.

==Veneration==
The first shrine of St Amphibalus stood before the Great Rood Screen in the Norman Abbey of St Alban&#x27;s, near the high altar on the north side of the shrine of St Alban. In 1323, a portion of the abbey roof collapsed, damaging the shrine. The shrine was then moved to the north aisle of the chancel. Eventually, around 1350, the shrine was given a position in the centre of the retrochoir, east of St Alban&#x27;s own shrine in the &#x27;Saint&#x27;s Chapel&#x27;, complete with a stone tomb, paintings, and a silver gilt plate.

The shrine was destroyed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII and the pieces were used to block the eastern arches of &quot;Saints&#x27; Chapel&quot;. The relics were scattered; however, the remains of the shrine were discovered in the 19th-century during renovations, and were reassembled in 1872 under the direction of Sir George Gilbert Scott. The stone shrine was restored in 2021 by the Skillington Workshop and can be seen in St Albans Cathedral. The shrine features a new masked figure to commemorate its reconstruction during the Covid pandemic.

Traditionally, Amphibalus&#x27; feast day was held on 22 June. Winchester Cathedral was under the patronage of St Amphibalus before it was dedicated to St Swithin circa the year 971, so there has to be, if not doubt, a question in the context of the source and chronology of the much later cult of Amphibalus.

<doc id="767148" wikidata="Q421342" url="?curid=767148" title="Phenylbutazone">
<text>Phenylbutazone, often referred to as &quot;bute&quot;, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for the short-term treatment of pain and fever in animals.

In the United States and United Kingdom, it is no longer approved for human use (except in the United Kingdom for ankylosing spondylitis), as it can cause severe adverse effects such as suppression of white blood cell production and aplastic anemia. This drug was implicated in the 2013 meat adulteration scandal. Positive phenylbutazone tests in horse meat were uncommon in the UK, however.

==Uses==

===In humans===
Phenylbutazone was originally made available for use in humans for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and gout in 1949. However, it is no longer approved, and therefore not marketed, for any human use in the United States. In the UK it is used to treat ankylosing spondylitis, but only when other therapies are unsuitable.

===In horses===
Phenylbutazone is the most commonly used NSAID for horses in the United States. It is used for the following purposes:

* Analgesia: It is used for pain relief from infections and musculoskeletal disorders, including sprains, overuse injuries, tendinitis, arthralgias, arthritis, and laminitis. Like other NSAIDs, it acts directly on musculoskeletal tissue to control inflammation, thereby reducing secondary inflammatory damage, alleviating pain, and restoring range of motion. It does not cure musculoskeletal ailments or work well on colic pain.
* Antipyresis: It is used for reduction of fevers. Its antipyretic qualities may mask other symptoms.

====History of phenylbutazone in racing====
In the 1968 Kentucky Derby, Dancer&#x27;s Image, the winner of the race, was disqualified after traces of phenylbutazone were allegedly discovered in a post-race urinalysis. Owned by prominent Massachusetts businessman Peter D. Fuller and ridden by jockey Bobby Ussery, Dancer&#x27;s Image was the first horse to win the Kentucky Derby and then be disqualified. Phenylbutazone was legal on most tracks around the United States in 1968, but had not yet been approved by Churchill Downs.

Controversy and speculation still surround the incident. In the weeks prior to the race, Fuller had given previous winnings to Coretta Scott King, the widow of slain civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr., which brought both praise and criticism. The previous year, King held a sit-in against housing discrimination which disrupted Derby week. Forty years later, Fuller still believed Dancer&#x27;s Image was disqualified due to these events.

Although Forward Pass had been named the winner, after many appeals the Kentucky Derby official website lists both Dancer&#x27;s Image and Forward Pass as the winner. The website&#x27;s race video commentary states that on the winner&#x27;s plaque at Churchill Downs, both Dancer&#x27;s Image and Forward Pass are listed as the 1968 winner of the Kentucky Derby.

===In dogs===
Phenylbutazone is occasionally used in dogs for the longer-term management of chronic pain, particularly due to osteoarthritis. About 20% of adult dogs are affected with osteoarthritis, which makes the management of musculoskeletal pain a major component of companion animal practice. The margin of safety for all NSAIDs is narrow in the dog, and other NSAIDs are more commonly used (etodolac, and carprofen). Gastrointestinal-protectant drugs, such as misoprostol, cimetidine, omeprazole, ranitidine, or sucralfate, are frequently included as a part of treatment with any NSAID. Dogs receiving chronic phenylbutazone therapy should be followed with regular blood work and renal monitoring.

Side effects of phenylbutazone in dogs include gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration, bone marrow depression, rashes, malaise, blood dyscrasias, and diminished renal blood flow.

==Dosage and administration in horses==
Phenylbutazone has a plasma elimination half-life of 4–8 hours, however the inflammatory exudate half life is 24 hours, so single daily dosing can be sufficient, although it is often used twice per day. The drug is considered fairly non-toxic when given at appropriate doses (2.2-4.4 mg/kg/day), even when used repeatedly. This dose has been doubled for diseases that cause severe pain, such as laminitis, but is toxic if repeated long-term, and exceptionally high doses (15 mg/kg/d or higher) can kill the animal in less than a week.

Phenylbutazone can be administered orally (via paste, powder or feed-in) or intravenously. It should not be given intramuscularly or injected in any place other than a vein, as it can cause tissue damage. Tissue damage and edema may also occur if the drug is injected repetitively into the same vein.

==Side effects and disadvantages==
Side effects of phenylbutazone are similar to those of other NSAIDs. Overdose or prolonged use can cause gastrointestinal ulcers, blood dyscrasia, kidney damage (primarily dose-dependant renal papillary necrosis), oral lesions if given by mouth, and internal hemorrhage. This is especially pronounced in young, ill, or stressed horses which are less able to metabolize the drug. Effects of gastrointestinal damage include edema of the legs and belly secondary to leakage of blood proteins into the intestines, resulting in decreased appetite, excessive thirst, weight loss, weakness, and in advanced stages, kidney failure and death. Phenylbutazone can also cause agranulocytosis.

Phenylbutazone amplifies the anticoagulant effect of vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin or phenprocoumon. Phenylbutazone displaces warfarin from plasma binding sites, and toxic blood levels leading to haemorrhage can occur. It may aggravate kidney or liver problems.

Phenylbutazone may be toxic to the embryo and can be transferred via the umbilical cord and by milk.

Phenylbutazone can be used in foals. Premature foals, septicemic foals, foals with questionable kidney or liver function and foals with diarrhea require careful monitoring. Drugs to protect the GI tract such as omeprazole, cimetidine, and sucralfate are frequently used with phenylbutazone.

High doses of phenylbutazone may be considered a rules violation under some equestrian organizations, as the drug may remain in the bloodstream four to five days after administration.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer places it in Group 3; i.e., &quot;not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans&quot;.

Use in horses is limited to those not intended for food. Metabolites of phenylbutazone can cause aplastic anaemia in humans.

==Investigations into potential carcinogenicity==

Opinions are conflicting regarding the carcinogenicity of phenylbutazone in animals; no evidence indicates it causes cancer in humans at therapeutic doses. Maekawa &quot;et al.&quot; (1987) found no increased cancer incidence in DONRYU rats fed a diet containing 0.125% or 0.25% phenylbutazone over two years. On the other hand, Kari &quot;et al.&quot; (1995) found a rare type of kidney cancer in rats (13 of 100) and an increased rate of liver cancer in male rats fed 150 and 300 mg/kg body weight of phenylbutazone for two years. Tennant (1993) listed phenylbutazone as a non-mutagenic carcinogen. Kirkland and Fowler (2010) acknowledged that, while phenylbutazone is not predicted to be a mutagen by computer software that simulates the chemicals interaction with DNA, one laboratory study indicated phenylbutazone subtly altered the structure of chromosomes of bone marrow cells of mice. Kirkland and Fowler (2010) furthermore explained that the theoretical carcinogenic effects of phenylbutazone in humans cannot be studied because patients prescribed the drug were given doses far below the level any effect may become apparent (&lt;1 mM). The World Health Organization&#x27;s International Agency For Research On Cancer (IARC) stated in 1987 that there was inadequate evidence for a carcinogenic effect in humans.

== Interactions ==

Other anti-inflammatory drugs that tend to cause GI ulcers, such as corticosteroids and other NSAIDs, can potentiate the bleeding risk. Combination with anticoagulant drugs, particularly coumarin derivatives, also increases the risk of bleeding. Avoid combining with other hepatotoxic drugs.

Phenylbutazone may affect blood levels and duration of action of phenytoin, valproic acid, sulfonamides, sulfonylurea antidiabetic agents, barbiturates, promethazine, rifampicin, chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine, and penicillin G.

==Overdose==
Overdoses of phenylbutazone can cause kidney failure, liver injury, bone marrow suppression, and gastric ulceration or perforation. Early signs of toxicity include loss of appetite, and depression.

==Chemistry==
Phenylbutazone is a crystalline substance. It is obtained by condensation of diethyl &quot;n&quot;-butylmalonate with hydrazobenzene in the presence of base. In effect, this represents the formation of the heterocyclic system by simple lactamization.

Oxyphenbutazone, the major metabolite of phenylbutazone, differs only in the &quot;para&quot; location of one of its phenyl groups, where a hydrogen atom is replaced by a hydroxyl group (making it 4-butyl-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenyl-3,5-pyrazolidinedione).

<text>The Selsdon Group is a British free-market economics pressure group, closely associated with the Conservative Party. Selsdon Group members believe that economic freedom is the indispensable condition for political and social freedom. The group&#x27;s President is John Redwood MP.

It was created in 1973 by a group of young libertarian Conservatives, with David Alexander as first chairman and Nicholas Ridley as first president, in order to promote free-market economic policies. This followed a conference held in January 1970 by Edward Heath and his shadow cabinet at the Selsdon Park Hotel in Selsdon, with the purpose of generating fresh policy ideas. The Selsdon Group took its name from this event.

The result of the 1970 discussions was a radical free-market agenda, ridiculed by the then Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson as the work of &quot;Selsdon Man&quot;. Wilson lost the subsequent general election to Heath. After a short period, however, Heath abandoned the 1970 manifesto in the face of bitter opposition from the trade unions. This historic U-turn was the catalyst for the formation of the Selsdon Group in 1973. A handful of young libertarian Conservatives, including David Alexander, Stephen Eyres, Philip Vander Elst, Anthony Vander Elst, and Richard S. Henderson created the new group, with Nicholas Ridley as president, in order to uphold and promote the free-market policies that they believed had won the Conservative Party the 1970 general election.

The &quot;Selsdon Declaration&quot;, to which all members must subscribe, was adopted at the Selsdon Group&#x27;s first meeting, held at the Selsdon Park Hotel in September 1973. Nicholas Ridley closed his keynote speech at that meeting by citing the &quot;Ten Cannots&quot; of William J. H. Boetcker, adding that it &quot;could well become the guiding principle of the Selsdon Group&quot;. (As often occurs with citations of Boetcker&#x27;s document, Ridley wrongly attributed the quotation to Abraham Lincoln.) Early members informally stressed that the Group commemorated and advanced the general principles of the Selsdon Declaration, rather than the detail of what they regarded as an inadequate document.

The group was criticised by many figures within the Conservative Party establishment at the time. Many of its policies, however, influenced later governments led by Margaret Thatcher and John Major.

<text>Bonne of Luxemburg or Jutta of Luxemburg (20 May 131511 September 1349), was born Jutta (Judith), the second daughter of King John of Bohemia, and his first wife, Elisabeth of Bohemia. She was the first wife of King John II of France; however, as she died a year prior to his accession, she was never a French queen. Jutta was referred to in French historiography as Bonne de Luxembourg, since she was a member of the House of Luxembourg. Among her children were Charles V of France, Philip II, Duke of Burgundy, and Joan, Queen of Navarre.

==Biography==
In June or July 1315, Jutta was betrothed to the future King Casimir the Great of Poland but he married Aldona of Lithuania in 1325 instead.

In 1326, Jutta was next betrothed to Henry of Bar. This arrangement was broken, however, and she stayed at the abbey of Saint-Esprit until her marriage to John, Duke of Normandy and future King John II of France.

Jutta was married to John, Duke of Normandy, on 28 July 1332 at the Collegiate Church of Notre-Dame, Melun. She was 17 years old, and the future king was 13. Her name Jutta (or Guta), translatable into English as Good (in the feminine case), was changed by the time of her marriage to Bonne (French) or Bona (Latin). Upon marriage, Bonne was the wife of the heir to the French throne, becoming Duchess of Normandy and Countess of Anjou and Maine. The wedding was celebrated in the presence of six thousand guests. The festivities were prolonged by a further two months when the young groom was finally knighted at the cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris. John was solemnly granted the arms of a knight in front of a prestigious audience bringing together the kings of Bohemia and Navarre, and the dukes of Burgundy, Lorraine and the Brabant.

Bonne was a patron of the arts, the composer Guillaume de Machaut being one of her favorites.

She died on 11 September 1349 of the bubonic plague in Maubuisson, France at the age of thirty-four. She was buried in the Abbey of Maubuisson.

Less than six months after Bonne&#x27;s death, John married Joan I, Countess of Auvergne.

===Issue===
John and Bonne had the following children together:
* Charles V of France (21 January 133816 September 1380)
* Catherine (13381338) died young
* Louis I, Duke of Anjou (23 July 133920 September 1384)
* John, Duke of Berry (30 November 134015 June 1416)
* Philip II, Duke of Burgundy (17 January 134227 April 1404)
* Joan (24 June 13433 November 1373)
* Marie (12 September 1344October 1404), married Robert, Duke of Bar in 1364
*Agnes (13451349), died young
*Margaret (13471352), died young
* Isabelle (1 October 134811 September 1372), married Gian Galeazzo Visconti in 1360

<doc id="767169" wikidata="Q751582" url="?curid=767169" title="Jerusalem Bible">
<text>The Jerusalem Bible (JB or TJB) is an English translation of the Bible published in 1966 by Darton, Longman &amp; Todd. As a Catholic Bible, it includes 73 books: the 39 books shared with the Hebrew Bible, along with the seven deuterocanonical books, as the Old Testament, and the 27 books shared by all Christians as the New Testament. It also contains copious footnotes and introductions.

For roughly half a century, the Jerusalem Bible has been the basis of the lectionary for Mass used in Catholic worship throughout much of the English-speaking world outside of North America, though in recent years various bishops&#x27; conferences have begun to transition to newer translations, including the English Standard Version, Catholic Edition, in the United Kingdom and India and the Revised New Jerusalem Bible in Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland.

== History ==
In 1943 Pope Pius XII issued an encyclical letter, &quot;Divino afflante Spiritu&quot;, which encouraged Catholics to translate the scriptures from the Hebrew and Greek texts, rather than from Jerome&#x27;s Latin Vulgate. As a result, a number of Dominicans and other scholars at the École Biblique in Jerusalem translated the scriptures into French. The product of these efforts was published as &quot;La Bible de Jérusalem&quot; in 1956.

This French translation served as the impetus for an English translation in 1966, the Jerusalem Bible. For the majority of the books, the English translation was a translation of the Hebrew and Greek texts; in passages with more than one interpretation, the interpretation chosen by the French translators is generally followed. For a small number of Old Testament books, the first draft of the English translation was made directly from the French, and then the general editor (Fr Alexander Jones) produced a revised draft by comparing this word-for-word with the Hebrew or Aramaic texts.

== Translation ==
The editor of the &quot;New Jerusalem Bible&quot;, Henry Wansbrough, claims the Jerusalem Bible &quot;was basically a translation from the French &quot;Bible de Jérusalem&quot;, conceived primarily to convey to the English-speaking world the biblical scholarship of this French Bible. The translation of the text was originally no more than a vehicle for the notes&quot;. He also writes: &quot;Despite claims to the contrary, it is clear that the Jerusalem Bible was translated from the French, possibly with occasional glances at the Hebrew or Greek, rather than vice versa.&quot;

The Jerusalem Bible was the first widely-accepted Catholic English translation of the Bible since the Douay–Rheims Version of the 17th century. It has also been widely praised for an overall very high level of scholarship, and is widely admired and sometimes used by liberal and moderate Protestants. The Jerusalem Bible is one of the versions authorized to be used in services of the Episcopal Church.

J. R. R. Tolkien translated the Book of Jonah for the Jerusalem Bible, although its final version was heavily edited, and he is listed among its &quot;principal collaborators&quot;.

=== Translation of the tetragrammaton ===
The Jerusalem Bible returned to the use of the historical name Yahweh as the name of God in the Old Testament, rendered as such in 6,823 places within this translation. If &quot;La Bible de Jerusalem&quot; of 1956 had been followed literally, this name would have been translated as &quot;the Eternal&quot;. The move has been welcomed by some. 

On 29 June 2008, Cardinal Francis Arinze, Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, wrote to the presidents of all conferences of bishops at the behest of Pope Benedict XVI, stating that the use of the name Yahweh was to be dropped from Catholic Bibles in liturgical use (most notably the &quot;CTS New Catholic Bible&quot; which uses the &quot;Jerusalem Bible&quot; text), as well as from songs and prayers, since pronunciation of this name violates long-standing Jewish and Christian tradition.

== Updates ==
* In 1973, the French translation received an update. A third French edition was produced in 1998.
* In 1985, the English translation was completely updated. This new translation – known as the &quot;New Jerusalem Bible&quot; – was freshly translated from the original languages and not tied to any French translation (except indirectly, because it maintained many of the stylistic and interpretive choices of the French Jerusalem Bible).
* In 2007 the Catholic Truth Society published the &quot;CTS New Catholic Bible&quot;, consisting of a revision of the original 1966 &quot;Jerusalem Bible&quot; text in order to make its text match the text which is contained in the lectionaries which are used in most English-speaking countries, in conformity with the directives of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments and the Pontifical Biblical Commission. The name &quot;Yahweh&quot; has been replaced with &quot;the LORD&quot; throughout the Old Testament, and the Psalms have been completely replaced with the 1963 Grail Psalter. The revised text is accompanied by new introductions, and textual and liturgical notes, supplemented as needed with material from the notes to the &quot;New Jerusalem Bible&quot;.
* Last updated in 1998, the French &quot;La Bible de Jérusalem&quot; is currently the subject of a revision project operating under the title &quot;The Bible in its Traditions.&quot; According to the notes, more weight will be given to the Septuagint in the translation of the Hebrew Bible scriptures, though the Masoretic Text will remain the primary source. The French portion of the &quot;Demonstration Volume&quot; is available online, together with a single sample of the English translation.
*Publisher Darton, Longman and Todd published the &quot;Revised New Jerusalem Bible&quot; in 2019. Substantially revising the JB and NJB texts, the new translation &quot;applies formal equivalence translation for a more accurate rendering of the original scriptures, sensitivity to readable speech patterns and more inclusive language&quot;. It contains new study notes and book introductions written by Henry Wansbrough.

<text>The University of Hawaiʻi – West Oʻahu (UHWO) is a public college in Kapolei, Hawaii, United States. It is part of the University of Hawaiʻi system. It offers baccalaureate degrees in liberal arts and professional studies. UHWO opened in January 1976. In 1981 it was accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission or its predecessor. In 2007, the school added first- and second-year subjects, becoming a four-year college.

In 2019 UHWO was the fastest-growing public baccalaureate college in the US. It has one of the most diverse student populations among four-year public institutions, according to the &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;. It is the university&#x27;s newest campus. It was established in part to provide access to higher education in Leeward Oʻahu.

The college offers undergraduate education. It enrolled 3,182 students in fall 2018, many from Leeward Oahu. UHWO also reaches students around the state with its Distance Learning program. About 10 percent of UHWO &#x27;s enrollment listed another island as their permanent address.

As of 2017 UHWO had the highest percentage of distance and online courses and programs and the highest percentage of part-time students in University of Hawaiʻi. UHWO supports the study of Hawaiian language, history and culture. The student:faculty ratio is 24:1. Tuition is among the lowest in the nation.

==History==
The idea for opening a second UH campus on Oahu formed in the mid-1960s over concern that the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa could not accommodate everyone.

In 1966 the University of Hawaiʻi Board of Regents approved a plan calling for the opening of such a campus. In 1970, UH executive Richard Kosaki was appointed chancellor for the proposed school known as West Oahu College. Kosaki proposed a new campus to serve the growing population in Leeward Oahu, where college attendance lagged other areas on the island.

Opponents held that another campus was not needed and would take resources from other campuses.

The college was approved by the Board of Regents as an upper division school in 1975. It opened in January 1976 enrolling 75 students at Mililani, Campbell and Pearl City high schools. It moved later that year to a Newtown Square office building in ʻAiea, Hawaiʻi, offering day and evening classes.

<doc id="767180" wikidata="Q6800835" url="?curid=767180" title="McDaniel College">
<text>McDaniel College is a private college in Westminster, Maryland. Established in 1867, it was known as Western Maryland College until 2002 when it was renamed McDaniel College in honor of an alumnus who gave a lifetime of service to the college. The college also has a satellite campus, McDaniel College Budapest, in Budapest, Hungary. McDaniel College is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. The college owns and manages a shopping center and residential properties through its for-profit arm.

==History==
The college was founded in 1867 as Western Maryland College, and was named for the Western Maryland Railroad because the college&#x27;s first Board chairman, John Smith of Wakefield, was also the president of the railroad. (Neither the railroad nor the Methodist Protestant Church contributed funds to facilitate the establishment of the college. Some contributions, however, were received from Methodist Protestant laymen, including John Smith.) It had a voluntary fraternal affiliation with the Methodist Protestant (later United Methodist) Church from 1868 until 1974; the adjacent but separate institution, the Westminster Theological Seminary, was a principal site for training Methodist Protestant (later United Methodist) clergy in the Maryland region. The ties with the United Methodist Church were cut over a court case in which Western Maryland and other religiously affiliated schools in Maryland were being challenged over state funding received by the colleges because of their religious ties. The other schools retained their affiliations and won the case.

The college&#x27;s first building went up in 1866–1867, with an inaugural class of 37 men and women in September 1867. Western Maryland was the first coeducational institution south of the Mason–Dixon line and was among the first in the nation. The school&#x27;s original charter read that the school would exist: &quot;For the benefit of students without regard to race, religion, color, sex, national or ethnic origin ... without requiring or enforcing any sectarian, racial or civil test, and without discrimination on the basis of sex, national or ethnic origin, nor shall any prejudice be made in the choice of any officer, teacher, or other employee in the said college on account of these factors.&quot; However, Western Maryland College was primarily a school without minority race representation until the 1960s.

Baker Memorial Chapel was dedicated April 20, 1958. The chapel, was built in memory of W.G. Baker, Joseph D. Baker, Daniel Baker, and Sarah Baker. The organ in the new chapel has been given by two alumni, father and son, Roger J. Whiteford, a prominent Washington attorney and graduate in 1906, and his son Joseph S. Whiteford a graduate in 1943, president of the Aeolian-Skinner Organ Company, Boston, Mass. The chapel was designed by architects Otto Eugene Adams and E.G. Riggs, of Baltimore. The Chapel steeple, 113 feet tall, is visible for miles around and was originally topped by a stainless steel cross 6 feet in height. The wood panels of the chancel have been designed to complement the antique organ console which was originally in the Bruton Parish Church, at Williamsburg, Virginia. The organ, with its 2,310 pipes, is held to be the largest in the area. The Whitefords also gave the carillon installed in the steeple.

In 1975 the college agreed to permanently remove religious symbols atop campus chapels and to introduce strict quotas on Methodist representation on the college board and among the faculty as a result of a settlement with the American Civil Liberties Union and Americans United for Separation of Church and State. Up until the 1980s, there was a specially constructed bunker in the basement of Lewis Hall, the science building, that would have housed the Wartime Information Security Program, a Cold War-era group that would have been responsible for censorship in the aftermath of a nuclear war.

McDaniel College Budapest (formerly known as Western Maryland College Budapest), the European campus of McDaniel College was established in collaboration with College International Budapest in 1994. McDaniel College was also home to the summer training camp of the Baltimore Colts and later Baltimore Ravens NFL team until the 2011 Season when the team relocated training camp to their Owings Mills facility. Newer buildings on campus include the Science Hall, gymnasium, library, and student union center. On January 11, 2002, the trustees announced their unanimous decision to change the name of the college. On July 1, 2002, WMC officially became McDaniel College, honoring alumnus William Roberts McDaniel and his 65-year association with the school. The naming process during the spring of 2002 included input from students, faculty and alumni about possible names.

Since Roger Casey, former McDaniel President, took office in 2010, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranking of the College decreased from 122 in 2010 to 134 in 2018. Over the same period, the enrollment decreased by 17%. In 2019 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; removed McDaniel from the list of National Liberal Art Colleges. In May 2016, Fitch Ratings revised its outlook for McDaniel from Stable to Negative. In June 2016 adjunct faculty at McDaniel voted to unionize. McDaniel is the second four-year university in the state with collective bargaining for the part-time employees. Adjuncts are represented by Service Employees International Union Local 500. In 2017 Forbes assigned McDaniel financial grade C+.

McDaniel College&#x27;s current president, Julia Jasken, was inaugurated in November 2021.

===2019 suspension of majors===
In February 2019, the Board of Trustees at the College approved the suspension of enrollment for future students in the majors of Art History, Religious Studies, French, German, and Music. Courses in all of these programs, except for German, will still be offered. In a letter to students and faculty, McDaniel officials wrote that the number of students currently enrolled in the affected programs makes up fewer than 3 percent of the student body. The future of faculty in the affected programs is unclear. An online petition against the decision, &quot;Open Letter in Support of Faculty in Art History, Religious Studies, French, German, Music, Latin, and Deaf Education at McDaniel College&quot; collected more than 650 signatures.

==Athletics==
McDaniel athletic teams are the Green Terror. The college is a member of the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Centennial Conference (an athletic conference that it&#x27;s a charter member) since the 1992–93 academic year for all sports (originally for football since the 1981–82 academic year).

McDaniel has 24 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, tennis, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball.

McDaniel&#x27;s nickname was rank 13th for &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; weirdest mascot names in 1999. The name originated from how teams would describe the Western Maryland Players as &quot;Terrors&quot; on the field. The name stuck and since October 1923 McDaniel College has been known as the Green Terror.

===Football===
The Green Terror have a long and storied program including: inventing the forward pass, Inventing the Shovel pass, first team invited to the Orange bowl and claiming the 1929 national championship.

McDaniel football dates back to 1891 when the first game was played against northern rival Gettysburg College.

Until 2010 the Baltimore Ravens, and before that the Baltimore Colts, held their training camps at McDaniel College. Head coach John Harbaugh still hosts clinics at McDaniel.

In 2011, McDaniel was ranked 6th in the country for best tailgating by the Weather Channel. This is due to the fans being able park their cars practically on the field and grill &amp; drink during the game, a tradition that dates to the 1920s. McDaniel College was also ranked in &quot;Southern Living&quot; magazine for the top 20 of the &quot;South&#x27;s Best Tailgates.&quot; At football games McDaniel can have an average attendance over 5,000 and highs as much as 8,750 even during a losing season, ranking in the top five in the country for D3 football.

<doc id="767187" wikidata="Q333578" url="?curid=767187" title="Norman St John-Stevas">
<text>Norman Antony Francis St John-Stevas, Baron St John of Fawsley, ( ; born Norman Panayea St John Stevas; 18 May 1929 – 2 March 2012) was a British Conservative politician, author and barrister. He served as Leader of the House of Commons in the government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher from 1979 to 1981. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Chelmsford from 1964 to 1987 and was made a life peer in 1987. His surname was created by compounding those of his father (Stevas) and mother (St John-O&#x27;Connor).

==Early life==
Stevas was born in London. His birth certificate specified that his Christian names were Norman Panayea St John, and that his father was Spyro Stevas, a hotel proprietor of Greek origin. In his &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; entry he gave his father as Stephen Stevas, an engineer and company director. His mother was Kitty St John O&#x27;Connor. His parents divorced, whereupon his mother hyphenated the name St John. He was reputedly closer to his mother than to his father. His older sister was the actress Juno Alexander, first wife of actor Terence Alexander.

Stevas was educated at St Joseph&#x27;s Salesian School, Burwash, East Sussex, and then at the Catholic school Ratcliffe College, Leicester. He was active in the Young Conservatives as a speaker for Conservative and Catholic causes. He was a contemporary of Gordon Reece, whom he reported to his superiors for atheism.

Subsequently, he was for six months enrolled at the English College, Rome, a seminary for the Roman Catholic priesthood, but found that he had no vocation. He remained a Catholic throughout his life, however. He then read law at what was then Fitzwilliam Hall, now Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge. As an undergraduate, he lived at St Edmund&#x27;s House (now St Edmund&#x27;s College, which at the time was a predominantly Roman Catholic institution) and served as President of the Cambridge Union in 1950. He graduated with first class honours and won the Whitlock Prize.

He studied also at Oxford University, where he gained a Second in the examination for the BCL degree at Christ Church and was the Secretary of the Oxford Union. He then studied for a PhD degree with a thesis titled &quot;A study of censorship with special reference to the law governing obscene publications in common law and other jurisdictions&quot; (on the early work of Walter Bagehot) from the University of London and a JSD degree from Yale University. He was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in 1952.

==Academic and legal career==
St John-Stevas was appointed as a lecturer at Southampton University (1952–1953) and King&#x27;s College London (1953–1956). He then went to Oxford University to tutor in Jurisprudence at Christ Church (1953–1955) and Merton College (1955–1957). He also lectured in the United States and held a visiting professorship at the University of California, Santa Barbara. From 1954 to 1959 he was legal adviser to Sir Alan Herbert&#x27;s Committee on book censorship.

Stevas also won many prizes and scholarships: the Blackstone and Harmsworth Scholarship (1952); the Blackstone Prize (1953); the Yorke Prize of Cambridge University (1957); a fellowship at Yale Law School (1958); a Fulbright award; and a Fund for the Republic fellowship (1958).

In 1956 his book &quot;Obscenity and the Law&quot; was published. This &quot;became a key work of reference during subsequent reforms&quot; and also &quot;reflected an intellectual shift toward the law&#x27;s retreat from the pulpit&quot;. He also wrote &quot;Life, Death and the Law&quot; (1961), &quot;The Right to Life&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Law and Morals&quot; (1964). These were &quot;earnest...with a liberal Catholic lawyer addressing difficult questions in a thoughtful spirit&quot;.

In 1959, he joined &quot;The Economist&quot; and became its Legal and Political Correspondent. Stevas edited the collected works of the Victorian journalist and politician Walter Bagehot. Between 1965 and 1986, &quot;The Economist&quot; itself published his edition &quot;to great acclaim&quot;, what have been called fifteen &quot;beautifully produced and highly regarded volumes&quot;. These volumes have been labelled Stevas&#x27;s &quot;memorial&quot;.

==Politician==
A founding member of the Conservative Bow Group, in 1951 St John-Stevas stood unsuccessfully for the safe Labour seat of Dagenham. He was later elected as Member of Parliament for the safe Conservative seat of Chelmsford in Essex at the 1964 general election holding this seat until stepping down at the 1987 general election. In later elections, the seat became marginal, and his majority at his final election contest in 1983 was less than a thousand votes.

He had opposed Sir Anthony Eden&#x27;s invasion of Suez in 1956, was a long-standing opponent of capital punishment and immigration restrictions based on race, and favoured a relaxation of the obscenity laws. Owing to his Catholic views, he opposed Leo Abse&#x27;s Divorce Bill and David Steel&#x27;s Abortion Bill. In 1966, he was a co-sponsor of Abse&#x27;s private member&#x27;s bill to reform the law to permit homosexual acts between consenting adults, which became the Sexual Offences Act 1967.

In the later stages of Prime Minister Edward Heath&#x27;s government, St John-Stevas was Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Education and Science (where Margaret Thatcher was the Secretary of State), and the Minister for the Arts (1973–1974).

Following the defeat of Heath&#x27;s government, St John-Stevas supported Heath in the first ballot of the 1975 Conservative Party leadership election but switched his vote to Thatcher in the second ballot. He then served as a member of the shadow cabinet from 1974 to 1979, being the Shadow Spokesman for Education between 1975 and 1978. His deputy was Sir Rhodes Boyson, a working-class Thatcherite from Lancashire. Stevas and Boyson did not get along and loathed each other. Stevas gave Boyson the ironic nickname &quot;Colossus&quot;. He became Shadow Leader of the House of Commons in 1978. When the Conservative Party was returned to power at the 1979 general election, he was appointed as Minister for the Arts for a second time from 1979 to 1981, while simultaneously holding the roles of Leader of the House of Commons and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.

In his role as Leader of the House, he has been credited with the creation of the House of Commons&#x27; system of select committees. These committees enable backbench MPs to hold ministers to account, and exert considerable influence within Parliament. In January 1981, St John-Stevas was the first of the Tory &quot;wets&quot; to be dismissed from the Cabinet by Margaret Thatcher (whom he had previously nicknamed &quot;Tina&quot; for her &quot;there is no alternative&quot; rhetoric). Thatcher explained to Roy Strong, &quot;Norman was too much&quot;, and added, &quot;Look at the way he&#x27;d done his office up. No sense of economy&quot;.

Now on the back-benches, Stevas remained loyal to Thatcher whilst criticising Thatcherite economic policies: &quot;He was a One Nation Conservative who looked to Disraeli rather than Milton Friedman&quot;. In 1984 appeared his book &quot;The Two Cities&quot;, in which he said that Thatcher could see &quot;everything in black and white [but] the universe I inhabit is made up of many shades of grey&quot;. He continued his interest in Parliamentary accountability, in 1983, he won the ballot for private members&#x27; bills and brought in the bill which became the National Audit Act 1983 establishing the UK&#x27;s National Audit Office and making it clear that the Comptroller and Auditor General, its head, was an officer of the House of Commons with rights to inspect the value for money of government spending.

St John-Stevas stood down from the House of Commons at the 1987 general election, being created a life peer in the House of Lords with the title Baron St John of Fawsley of Preston Capes in the County of Northamptonshire on 19 October 1987.

==Chairman of the Royal Fine Art Commission==
He was Chairman of the Royal Fine Art Commission from 1985 to 1999. His tenure was wracked by controversy. It was hoped that his appointment would revitalise and popularise the commission, which had not even produced an annual report for many years. Stevas succeeded in &quot;inject[ing] a bit of panache and excitement&quot; into the commission. However it also became a mouthpiece for Lord St John&#x27;s own views and preferences (most prominently in the annual Building of the Year award). Lord St John adorned his office with paintings from national collections, documents were presented in red boxes and he was served by a chauffeur and ex-civil servants, in accommodation more lavish than that of most secretaries of state: prompting one commentator to quip that &quot;if he cannot have power, he must have the trappings&quot;. The necessity of such extravagance was questioned in a government report by Sir Geoffrey Chipperfield.

The Commission strongly criticised the plans for the Millennium Wheel on London&#x27;s South Bank even though three of the Commissioners were enthusiastic about it. After an ill-tempered meeting in which Stevas was allegedly rude to the Wheel&#x27;s architects, Sherban Cantacuzino, the commission&#x27;s secretary, wrote to the architects saying: &quot;I am sure that he enjoys putting people down, all of us have suffered from his bullying&quot;.

Despite all predictions, in 1995 Stevas was reappointed for a third term as chairman.

==Master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge==
His tenure as Master of Emmanuel College at Cambridge University (1991 to 1996) was at times controversial. He built a new lecture theatre with ancillary rooms (the Queen&#x27;s Building) at the cost of some £8 million, the costs of which were pushed upwards by Lord St John&#x27;s insistence on re-opening the quarries in Ketton, Rutland, to obtain limestone from the same source from which the college&#x27;s Wren chapel was built. Some of the college&#x27;s fellows apparently first had doubts about the wisdom of appointing Stevas when several of his friends were caught naked one night in the Fellows&#x27; Garden swimming pool.

Stevas succeeded in promoting the college through &quot;House and Garden&quot; and &quot;Hello!&quot;, although some fellows were angered when Mohammed al-Fayed, who had donated £250,000 to a new extension of the college, was rewarded with a &quot;Harrods Room&quot; and an honorary membership of the college, an honour Stevas invented. The relationship between Master and College worsened to the point that &quot;one tutor started handing out copies of the Master&#x27;s pronouncements in his role as &#x27;constitutional expert&#x27; with a prize for the student who spotted the greatest number of legal mistakes&quot;.

Stevas&#x27;s critics alleged that he spent too much time with a small clique of public school-educated young men who &quot;were favoured with introductions to royalty and captains of industry, to dinners at White&#x27;s, private theatrical performances at the Master&#x27;s Lodge and long, affectionate letters&quot;. Stevas would also cut undergraduates off in mid-sentence with a cutting remark in Latin and to members of other colleges Emmanuel gained the nickname &quot;Mein Camp&quot;.

Following his retirement as Master he maintained his ties with Emmanuel College, which he used from time to time as a venue for events of the Royal Fine Art Commission Trust.

==Personal life==
Lord St John was a prominent Roman Catholic. He was also Patron of the Anglican Society of King Charles the Martyr, and Grand Bailiff for England and Wales of the Military and Hospitaller Order of Saint Lazarus (statuted 1910).

He was chairman of the Catholic New Bearings group in the early 1970s whose members included the Bishop Augustine Harris. New Bearings&#x27; purpose was to provide support to priests and nuns who were struggling with their vocation and operated independently from the church.

His partner of over fifty years was Adrian Stanford. They met in 1956 at Oxford, where Lord St John taught Stanford law. They entered into a civil partnership shortly before Lord St John&#x27;s death enabling only the latter to face inheritance tax when he died. Without this 40% of £3.3 million would be instantly liable to tax but lessened by any agricultural, active own business and charity bequests, which are not published in the public calendars of probate.

He was noted for his many personal affectations, including proffering his hand in papal fashion, lapsing into Latin whilst speaking, and deliberately mispronouncing modern words. A loyal monarchist, Lord St John enjoyed a close relationship with the British Royal Family. Soon after his elevation to the Lords, photographs of him in purple bedroom slippers appeared in &quot;Hello!&quot; magazine while he lounged in the bedroom of his former rectory home in Northampton with a signed photograph of Princess Margaret prominently displayed. All personal notes were written in purple ink. After his elevation to the Lords, he was an active member and used only official House of Lords-headed stationery. He lived in Montpellier Square, Knightsbridge, and had a house in Northamptonshire.&quot;

&quot;The Catholic Herald&quot;, a newspaper that St John-Stevas had contributed to on many occasions, wrote on his death that &#x27;Unlike a lot of people who have trodden the corridors of power, he was not in the least secretive about his experiences. He idolised the Queen Mother, Princess Margaret and Pius IX. His house in Northamptonshire was filled with relics and pictures of all three. He even had a cassock which was supposed to have belonged to the Blessed Pius, and ... on occasions, he wore it to fancy dress parties&#x27;.

He died at his home in London on 2 March 2012, aged 82, after a short illness. His homosexuality was summarised by Simon Hoggart in &quot;The Guardian&quot; obituary note: &quot;He lived in that period where gay politicians never came &quot;out&quot;, yet were happy for everyone to know. He lived life as a camp performance.&quot;

<text>Woman in the Moon (German Frau im Mond) is a German science fiction silent film that premiered 15 October 1929 at the UFA-Palast am Zoo cinema in Berlin to an audience of 2,000. It is often considered to be one of the first &quot;serious&quot; science fiction films. It was directed by Fritz Lang, and written by his wife Thea von Harbou, based on her 1928 novel &quot;The Rocket to the Moon&quot;. It was released in the US as &quot;By Rocket to the Moon&quot; and in the UK as &quot;Girl in the Moon&quot;. The basics of rocket travel were presented to a mass audience for the first time by this film, including the use of a multi-stage rocket. The film was shot between October 1928 and June 1929 at the UFA studios in Neubabelsberg near Berlin.

==Plot summary==

Helius is an entrepreneur with an interest in space travel. He seeks out his friend Professor Mannfeldt, a visionary who wrote a treatise claiming that there was probably much gold on the Moon, only to be ridiculed by his peers. Helius recognizes the value of Mannfeldt&#x27;s work. However, a gang of evil businessmen have also taken an interest in Mannfeldt&#x27;s theories, and send a spy who identifies himself as &quot;Walter Turner&quot;.

Meanwhile, Helius&#x27;s assistant Windegger has announced his engagement to Helius&#x27;s other assistant, Friede. Helius, who secretly loves Friede, avoids their engagement party.

On his way home from his meeting with Professor Mannfeldt, Helius is enticed by a henchwoman of the gang posing as a violet seller. The research that Professor Mannfeldt had entrusted to Helius is stolen, and they also burgle Helius&#x27;s home, taking other valuable material. Turner then presents Helius with an ultimatum: the gang knows he is planning a voyage to the Moon; either he includes them in the project, or they will sabotage it and destroy his rocket, which is named &quot;Friede&quot; (&quot;peace&quot;). Reluctantly, Helius agrees to their terms.

The rocket team is assembled: Helius; Professor Mannfeldt and his pet mouse Josephine; Windegger; Friede; and Turner. After &quot;Friede&quot; blasts off, the team discovers that Gustav, a young boy who has befriended Helius, has stowed away, along with his collection of science fiction pulp magazines. During the journey, Windegger emerges as a coward, and Helius&#x27;s feelings for Friede begin to become known to her, creating a romantic triangle.

They reach the far side of the Moon and find it has a breathable atmosphere, per the theories of Peter Andreas Hansen, who is mentioned near the beginning of the film. Mannfeldt discovers gold, proving his theory. When confronted by Turner, Mannfeldt falls to his death in a crevasse. Turner, with samples of the gold, attempts to hijack the rocket, and in the struggle, he is shot and killed. Gunfire damages the oxygen tanks, and they come to the grim realization that there is not enough oxygen for all to make the return trip. One person must remain on the Moon.

Helius and Windegger draw straws to see who must stay and Windegger loses. Seeing Windegger&#x27;s anguish, Helius decides to drug Windegger and Friede with a last drink together and take Windegger&#x27;s place, letting Windegger return to Earth with Friede. Friede senses that something is in the wine. She pretends to drink and then retires to the compartment where her cot is located, closes and locks the door. Windegger drinks the wine, becoming sedated. Helius makes Gustav his confidant and the new pilot for the ship. Helius watches it depart, then starts out for the survival camp originally prepared for Windegger. He discovers that Friede has decided to stay with him on the Moon. They embrace, and Helius weeps into her shoulder while Friede strokes his hair and whispers words of comfort to him.

==Influence==

Lang, who also made &quot;Metropolis&quot;, had a personal interest in science fiction. When returning to Germany in the late 1950s, he sold his extensive collection of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, and &quot;Galaxy&quot; magazines. Several prescient technical/operational features are presented during the film&#x27;s 1920s launch sequence, which subsequently came into common operational use during America&#x27;s postwar space race:
* The rocket ship &quot;Friede&quot; is fully built in a tall building and moved to the launch area
* As launch approaches, intertitles count down the seconds from six to &quot;now&quot; (&quot;now&quot; was used for zero), and &quot;Woman in the Moon&quot; is often cited as the first occurrence of the &quot;countdown to zero&quot; before a rocket launch
* The rocket ship blasts off submerged in a pool of water; water is commonly used today on launch pads to absorb and dissipate the extreme heat and to damp the noise generated by the rocket exhaust
* In space, the rocket ejects its first stage and fires its second stage rocket, predicting the development of modern multistage orbital rockets
* The crew recline on horizontal beds to cope with the G-forces experienced during lift-off and pre-orbital acceleration
* Floor foot straps are used to restrain the crew during zero gravity (Velcro is used today).

These items and the overall design of the rocket led to the film being banned in Germany from 1933–1945 during World War II by the Nazis, due to similarities to their secret V-2 project.

Rocket scientist Hermann Oberth worked as an advisor on this movie. He had originally intended to build a working rocket for use in the film, but time and technical constraints prevented this from happening. The film was popular among the rocket scientists in Wernher von Braun&#x27;s circle at the &quot;Verein für Raumschiffahrt&quot; (VfR). The first successfully launched V-2 rocket at the rocket-development facility in Peenemünde had the &quot;Frau im Mond&quot; logo painted on its base. Noted post-war science writer Willy Ley also served as a consultant on the film. Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s 1973 novel &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, which deals with the V-2 rockets, refers to the movie, along with several other classic German silent films.
Oberth also advised Hergé for &quot;Destination Moon&quot; and &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot; (1953/4), which has plot points strongly influenced by &quot;Woman in the Moon&quot;.

<text>The Navy Distinguished Service Medal is a military decoration of the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps which was first created in 1919 and is presented to Sailors and Marines to recognize distinguished and exceptionally meritorious service to the United States while serving in a duty or position of great responsibility. 

Navy Distinguished Service Medal is equivalent to the Army&#x27;s Distinguished Service Medal, Air and Space Forces&#x27; Air Force Distinguished Service Medal, and the Coast Guard Distinguished Service Medal. The Navy Distinguished Service Medal was originally senior to the Navy Cross, until August 1942 when the precedence of the two decorations was reversed. Currently, it is worn after the Defense Distinguished Service Medal and before the Silver Star Medal.

==History==
At the start of World War I, the Department of the Navy had the Medal of Honor as the only decoration with which to recognize heroism. To recognize acts deserving recognition, but at a level below that required for the Medal of Honor, the Navy Distinguished Service Medal and the Navy Cross were created by on 4 February 1919. The law made the award retroactive to 6 April 1917. The first award of the decoration was a posthumous presentation to Brigadier General Charles A. Doyen, USMC, on 13 March 1919. Originally senior in precedence to the Navy Cross, the Navy Distinguished Service Medal assumed its current place below the Navy Cross by Congressional action on 7 August 1942.

==Criteria==
The Navy Distinguished Service Medal is bestowed upon members of the Navy or Marine Corps who distinguish themselves by exceptionally meritorious service to the United States government in a duty of great responsibility. To justify this decoration, exceptional performance of duty must be clearly above that normally expected, and contributes to the success of a major command or project. Generally, the Distinguished Service Medal is awarded to officers in principal commands at sea, or in the field, whose service is of a manner to justify the award. However, this does not preclude the award of the Navy Distinguished Service Medal to any individual who meets the service requirements. The term &quot;great responsibility&quot; implies senior military responsibility, and the decoration is normally only bestowed to senior Navy flag officers and Marine Corps general officers, or extremely senior enlisted positions such as the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy or the Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps. In rare instances, it has also been awarded to Navy captains and Marine Corps colonels, typically those in positions of significant responsibility in direct support of senior flag and general officers, and then only by exception (usually at retirement).

==Appearance==
The Navy Distinguished Service Medal is a gilt bronze medallion in diameter. The obverse of the medal depicts an American bald eagle in the center displaying its wings. The eagle holds an olive branch in its right talon and arrows in its left talons. The eagle is surrounded by a blue enameled ring with the words, &quot;• UNITED • STATES • OF • AMERICA •&quot; at the top and &quot;• NAVY •&quot; at the bottom. Surrounding the blue enamel ring is a gold border of scroll waves depicted moving in a clockwise direction. The medal is surmounted by a white five-pointed star, point up, the points of the star being tipped with gold balls. In the center of the star is a blue anchor, while gold rays radiate between the arms of the star.

The reverse of the medal depicts a trident surrounded by a laurel wreath. The wreath is surrounded by a blue enamel ring containing the inscription &quot;FOR DISTINGUISHED SERVICE&quot;. Like the obverse, the blue enamel ring on the reverse is surrounded by scroll waves.

The medal&#x27;s suspension and service ribbon is navy blue with a single central stripe of yellow. Additional awards of the Navy Distinguished Service Medal are denoted by gold and silver 5/16 inch stars worn on the medal&#x27;s suspension and service ribbon.

<doc id="767210" wikidata="Q2091915" url="?curid=767210" title="Battle of Bomarsund">
<text>The Battle of Bomarsund, in August 1854, took place during the Åland War, which was part of the Crimean War, when an Anglo-French expeditionary force attacked a Russian fortress. It was the only major action of the war to take place at Bomarsund in the Baltic Sea.

== Background ==
Bomarsund was a 19th-century fortress, the construction of which had started in 1832 by Russia in Sund, Åland, in the Baltic Sea. Bomarsund had not been completed (only two towers of the planned twelve subsidiary towers had been completed). When the war broke out the fortress remained vulnerable especially against forces attacking over land. Designers of the fortress had also assumed that narrow sea passages near the fortress would not be passable for large naval ships; while this assumption had held true during the time of sailing ships, it was possible for steam powered ships to reach weakly defended sections of the fortress.

== First battle ==
On 21 June 1854, three British ships bombarded the Bomarsund fortress. Artillery from the shore, however, responded and, while both sides suffered some damage, the casualties were light. The first battle was indecisive. During the battle, Charles Davis Lucas tossed a shell overboard which had landed on board. The shell exploded before it reached water. For saving his ship he was the first man to be awarded the Victoria Cross.

== Second battle ==
While the first battle had been a brief clash and artillery duel, the second battle was a different affair. By the end of July 1854, a British fleet of 25 ships had surrounded the fortress and only waited for the French ground troops to arrive. Both defender and attacker had acknowledged that the fort could not be defeated by naval forces alone and made preparations accordingly, Russian forces destroyed the surrounding countryside in an effort to force British and French forces to break away from the assumed siege.

On 8 August, a force of 7,000 French soldiers from the regiments &quot;Chasseurs de Vincennes&quot;, &quot;2e Régiment d&#x27;Infanterie Légère&quot;, &quot;3e Régiment d&#x27;Infanterie&quot;, &quot;48e Régiment d&#x27;Infanterie&quot; and &quot;51e Régiment d&#x27;Infanterie&quot; landed south of Bomarsund, while the remaining 2,000 French soldiers and a small force of 900 British marines landed on the north. Two days later the artillery landed; the British troops established a battery of three 32-pounder guns on a hill, the French establishing several batteries. On 13 August 1854, the French artillery opened fire on a tower and by the end of the day were in a position that while artillery suppressed the defenders of subsidiary tower of &quot;Brännklint&quot;, French infantry assaulted it. Defenders found their position to be hopeless and withdrew the bulk of their forces to the main fort leaving only a small detachment behind to supervise demolition of the tower. While French troops managed to capture the tower before it was demolished, it did not save the tower since the Russian artillery now opened fire at the captured tower and on 15 August 1854 scored a hit to the gunpowder magazines. The resulting explosion demolished the tower.
The bombardment of the main fortress started late on 15 August 1854 with land based guns and the navy opening fire. The second tower, &quot;Notvik&quot;, was also destroyed after British artillery opened fire from their hill opposite to the tower. With only a few guns capable of firing in the direction of the bombarding ships, the Russian forces hoped that the French and British forces would attack by land. However, after the bombardment continued into the 16 August without any indication of landings, it became apparent to the Russian commander that British and French intended to reduce the fortress with artillery fire. After eight hours of bombardment they managed to create a gaping hole in the fortress&#x27;s walls. After most of the guns had been destroyed, the commandant of the tower surrendered to the British and French forces on 16 August 1854.

The early surrender came as a surprise to the French and British. 2,000 men laid down their arms and became prisoners.

== Aftermath ==

After the surrender, French and British forces demolished the fortress. British engineers remained until mid-September to ensure it could not be easily rebuilt. 700,000 bricks from it were brought in barges to Helsinki and then used in the construction of the Uspenski Cathedral.

Three hundred Finnish grenadiers defending the fortress were among the captured, and they were taken to Lewes to be imprisoned there until the end of the war. Upon the conclusion of the war they were released and given passage back to Finland, and they returned with a song about their experiences during the war, called the &quot;War of Åland&quot; (&quot;Finnish: &quot;Oolannin sota&quot;, Swedish: &quot;Det Åländska kriget). The Russian Memorial was erected in Lewes in 1877 to commemorate those who died while they were prisoners of war.

In the Treaty of Paris 1856, the entire Åland Islands were demilitarized, which is a status that has been preserved until this day.

<doc id="767213" wikidata="Q6025246" url="?curid=767213" title="Individual Ready Reserve">
<text>The Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) is a category of the Ready Reserve of the Reserve Component of the Armed Forces of the United States composed of former active duty or reserve military personnel. Its governing statute is codified at . For soldiers in the National Guard of the United States, its counterpart is the Inactive National Guard (ING). As of 22 June 2004, the IRR had approximately 112,000 members (does not include all service IRR populations) composed of enlisted personnel and officers, with more than 200 Military Occupational Specialties are represented, including combat arms, combat support, and combat service support.

==Overview==
An individual assigned to the IRR typically receives no pay and is not obligated to drill, conduct annual training, or participate in any military activities (except for periodic Muster activities) unless activated by Presidential Reserve Callup Authority or electing to drill, train, or serve in a &quot;Drill without Pay&quot; or an &quot;Active Duty&quot; role. Unlike members of the Standby Reserve (active and inactive) and Retired Reserve, IRR personnel are members of the Ready Reserve and as such, they retain their status as uniformed military personnel, their military specialty (e.g., pilot, surface warfare officer, infantryman, intelligence officer or enlisted intelligence specialist, etc.) and rank/pay grade. The IRR, Selected Reserve, and Inactive National Guard comprise the three Ready Reserve programs.

IRR personnel also receive benefits similar to other members of the reserve components of the United States Armed Forces to include entitlement to the United States Uniformed Services Privilege and Identification Card and for their dependents, PX/BX/NEX/MCX/CGX (exchange) benefits, commissary benefits, and MWR (Morale, Welfare and Recreation) benefits. Note that these benefits are only available to IRR members in the &quot;CONUS&quot; (contiguous United States). An individual assigned to the IRR may receive pay and full benefits (including medical care and dental care for member and dependents) for voluntarily performing specific types of active duty. Because members of the IRR rarely serve on extended active duty and are not retired from military service, most are not eligible for TRICARE. However, if honorably discharged, they do have the VA for medical benefits.

By law, IRR members are required to retain possession of their service uniforms, retain their military identification card, and notify their service branch if they move and change their address. Upon being called up, service members will usually be screened for their medical and personal status in order to qualify or disqualify them for activation. During the process, IRR members who seek to delay, defer, or exempt their activations have the opportunity to present their case to the mobilization authority for a decision. An enlisted service member&#x27;s IRR service ends after the completion of their mandatory service obligation (MSO), usually eight years.

In the case of military retired personnel, they can be recalled to active service up to age 60 if they had completed more than 20 years on active duty and are physically capable.

==Callup authority and activation==
&quot;Presidential Reserve Callup Authority&quot; (PRCA) is a provision of a public law (US Code, Title 10 (DOD), section 12304) that provides the President a means to activate, without a declaration of national emergency, not more than 200,000 members of the Selected Reserve and the Individual Ready Reserve (of whom not more than 30,000 may be members of the Individual Ready Reserve), for not more than 400 days to meet the support requirements of any operational mission. Members called under this provision may not be used for disaster relief or to suppress insurrection. This authority has particular utility when used in circumstances in which the escalatory national or international signals of partial or full mobilization would be undesirable. Forces available under this authority can provide a tailored, limited-scope, deterrent or operational response, or may be used as a precursor to any subsequent mobilization.

When the nation is under a presidentially declared state of national emergency in accordance with the National Emergencies Act the President has even broader authority, allowing them to activate not more than 1,000,000 members of the Ready Reserve with no further limitation. The United States has been in a state of national emergency since November 14, 1979.

When activated by Presidential Reserve Callup Authority, soldiers are required to follow the activation instructions contained in Army Regulation 135-91 specifying that members of the IRR can be required to join an Army Reserve unit if they are statutorily obligated and have a skill needed by the Army. Reserve soldiers are normally obligated to serve up to two years active duty, a requirement that is waiverable by the individual soldier, mission constraints, or the needs of the Army. The Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), the portion of the public law that primarily governs the military as a subset of the general population, is applicable to soldiers activated from the Individual Ready Reserve as of the date that their activating orders require them to report. This subjects them to the possibility of punishment under UCMJ for being Absent Without Leave (AWOL) if they choose to resist activation.

==Activations since the War on Terror==
Until the War on Terror, members of the Individual Ready Reserve had not been called up since Operation Desert Shield. A major difficulty in activating the IRR stems from the fact that many of its members, typically those from the junior enlisted ranks, are unaware that they are even in the military. This results from such members typically being informed that they are &quot;discharged&quot; upon release from active duty when in fact they have been transferred to the inactive reserves. To solve this situation, many military separation transition courses now spend additional time explaining the nature of the inactive reserve. As of 2005, the military also began to enact &quot;IRR Musters&quot; which were once a year occurrences where an IRR member would be required to report to a military base, confirm their personal and contact information, and sign acknowledgement paperwork that they were members of the IRR.

===Army===
In March 2004, Army Human Resources Command began identifying IRR soldiers with Military Occupational Specialties that met the needs of the Army at that time. In June 2004, those soldiers were transferred into Selected Reserve units to begin drilling, training, and preparing for deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.

===Marines===
The Marines began activating their IRR members beginning in 2001. They were allotted up to 2,500 Marines to be activated at any one time. So far, two major activations have occurred, targeting mostly corporals and sergeants and those with high-demand training (combat arms, logistics, maintenance, etc.).

===History of War on Terror activations===

February 2003:
* Marine Corps Arabic linguists and other support personnel were recalled to active duty to serve in Iraq. This activation was the first time that the IRR had been called upon since the 1991 Gulf War, when approximately 20,000 IRR troops were called up in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.

29 July 2004:
* 5,600 members of the IRR, mainly with specialties as military police or Civil Affairs, were called to active duty to support U.S. forces in Iraq.

April 2005:
* Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld authorized the Army to mobilize up to 6,500 Individual Ready Reservists at any one time.
* 3,900 IRR members with critical specialities called to active duty.
* About 550 of those called failed to report for duty, some claimed exemptions, others ignored their orders.

August 2006:
* President Bush authorized the U.S. Marine Corps to recall 2,500 troops to active duty.

March 2007:
* Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates approved the recall of 1800 Marines not in their first or last year of their IRR contract, 1200 of which were Sergeants and Captains joining the I MEF in Iraq. Specialties recalled included:
** Aviation maintenance, 361
** Logistics support, 225
** Infantry, tanks and artillery, 223
** Motor transport, 178
** Communications, 97
** Intelligence, 95
** Military police, 21

They were used for early rotation into a 2008 deployment. If more troops were needed, another recall was planned for July.

August 2007:
* The Marines sent out another recall for a September 2007 muster and screening for possible activation in early 2008.
April 2008:
* The Marines sent out another recall for a May 30 muster and screening for a possible activation in October 2008.
* In September 2008, The Marines sent out another notification of recall for an involuntary muster and screening on October 12 for activation on May 18, 2009.

As of March 2009, the US Army had recalled 26,954 ready reservists since September 11, 2001. Of those, 10,592 requested exemptions of which 6,352 were granted.

On 16 October 2014, President Obama ordered the activation of the IRR in support of Operation United Assistance.

=== History of activations and authorized since COVID-19 Pandemic ===
On 27 March 2020, President Trump authorized the Secretary of Defense &amp; the Secretary of Homeland Security to order up to 1,000,000 IRR members to active duty.

On 13 July 2023, President Biden authorized the Secretary of Defense &amp; the Secretary of Homeland Security to order up to 450 IRR members to active duty in order to support Operation Atlantic Resolve. 

==Delay, Deferment &amp; Exemption (DD&amp;E)==
Delay, Deferment and Exemption (DD&amp;E) are the methods by which a service member may be relieved of immediate activation.
* Delay – When a service member cannot be activated immediately (for example, they are getting married soon), but they are for all other reasons qualified and can be called up later for activation. Usually, the delay will last up to 4–6 months depending on the needs of the activation.
* Deferment – The service member cannot serve immediately for a fixed amount of time (for example, the service member is in school and will graduate within a year) but can be called up later when the situation changes.
* Exemption – The service member has an immutable characteristic which will never qualify them for activation (for example, the service member is an ordained religious member).

<doc id="767220" wikidata="Q310000" url="?curid=767220" title="Ludvík Svoboda">
<text>Ludvík Svoboda (; 25 November 1895 – 20 September 1979) was a Czech general and politician. He fought in both World Wars, for which he was regarded as a national hero, and he later served as the president of Czechoslovakia from 1968 to 1975.

== Early and personal life ==
Svoboda was born in Hroznatín, Margraviate of Moravia, Austria-Hungary, to the family of Jan Svoboda. His father died when he was one year old and he was raised by his mother Františka who remarried to František Nejedlý. Svoboda attended the agricultural school at Velké Meziříčí and worked at a vineyard. In 1915, he had to join the Austro-Hungarian Army.

Svodoba married Irena Svobodová (1901–1980) in 1923. Their children include the Czech economist and academic, Zoe Klusáková-Svobodová (1925–2022).

==World War I==
Svoboda was sent to the Eastern Front, and fell into Russian captivity on 18 September 1915 at Tarnopol. He joined the Czechoslovak Legion and took part in the battles of Zborov and Bakhmach. He returned home through a &quot;Siberian anabasis&quot;.

==Interwar period==
Svoboda worked at his father&#x27;s estate before launching his military career in the Czechoslovak Army as a member of the 3rd (Jan Žižka) infantry regiment in Kroměříž in 1921. He married Irena Stratilová in 1923. In the same year, Svoboda was transferred to the 36th infantry regiment in Uzhhorod, Subcarpathia, then part of Czechoslovakia, until 1931. He passed several courses and also learned the Hungarian language, which he taught between 1931 and 1934 at the Military Academy. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1934 and transferred back to the 3rd infantry regiment. Lieutenant Colonel Svoboda served in several positions, and became a battalion commander until the German occupation of the rest of Czechoslovakia on 15 March 1939.

==World War II==
After the German occupation and the establishment of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia Lieutenant Colonel Svoboda became a member of a secret underground organization &quot;Obrana národa&quot; (&quot;Defence of the Nation&quot;). It is supposed that at the same time he established a connection with Soviet intelligence. In June 1939 he fled to Poland, and as the oldest and most senior officer formed a Czechoslovak military unit in Kraków. Hundreds of emigrating junior officers passed through this camp. Within three months, 1,200 airmen were dispatched to France. Those soldiers who remained in Poland joined the Czech Republic military unit on the territory of Poland.

The Polish president allowed the Czechoslovaks a military unit designated the &quot;Legion of Czechs and Slovaks&quot; only on 3 September 1939, the third day after the German invasion of Poland, so Svoboda had little opportunity to intervene in the fighting. After the defeat of Poland in September 1939, Svoboda transferred a group of more than 700 officers and soldiers to the Soviet Union (USSR) for asylum. The escape of the group to Romania was ruled out because there was a threat that the Romanians would hand them over to the Germans. In the USSR, the group was immediately renamed the &quot;Eastern Group of the Czechoslovak Republic army&quot;. The group crossed without weapons and in civilian clothes, but as a military unit with the consent of the Czechoslovak ambassador in Poland, Juraj Slávik, and after negotiations with the Soviet diplomatic authorities on the territory of Poland. In order not to disperse as civilian emigrants to the Soviet Union, which at that time had a mutual non-aggression agreement with Germany (within the so-called Ribbentrop–Molotov Pact), the soldiers were isolated from the public in internment camps, where they lived according to Czechoslovak Republic army regulations. These internment camps were neither POW camps, nor labor camps, nor gulags.

During the internment, the &quot;Čs. Eastern military groups&quot; moved successively to Kamenec Podolský, Olchovce, Jarmolince, Oranky and the Spaso-Jevfimij Monastery in Suzdal. There was no Czechoslovak diplomatic representation on the territory of the USSR at that time, so Lt. Col. Svoboda led diplomatic negotiations with the Soviet authorities for two years, until the invasion of the Soviet Union by Germany. His goals were to keep the Czechoslovak military group together, to keep it materially supported, and to transport the larger part of its officers and non-commissioned officers to countries that fought against Germany—that is, first to France, then after France&#x27;s fall, to Great Britain, and finally to the Middle East. A total of 12 transports with 662 men, 12 women and 6 children were dispatched with the help of the Soviets. At that time the Czechoslovak government in exile, led by President Edvard Beneš, was not yet recognized by Czechoslovakia&#x27;s pre-Munich allies—that is, France and Great Britain. They had not yet declared the Munich Agreement and the borders of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia invalid. Czechoslovak airmen had to serve in the French Foreign Legion in France until it was invaded by Germany, but their military ranks were reduced or not recognized.

On 18 July 1941, one month after Germany attacked the USSR, Czechoslovak political representatives signed an agreement with the Soviet Union on the restoration of diplomatic relations and mutual cooperation in the war against Germany. The agreement made it possible to organize a separate Czechoslovak military unit in the Soviet Union. Lt. Col. Svoboda was significantly involved in the preparation of this military agreement and also in negotiating the conditions for the cooperation of the Soviet and Czechoslovak intelligence services. On the Czechoslovak side, the liaison officer was Colonel Heliodor Píka. Because of this, Svoboda left the USSR several times for Istanbul, Turkey. 

Colonel Pika had already been leading a secret Czechoslovak military mission in Moscow during the spring of 1941, with Lt. Col. Svoboda as his deputy. At the turn of May and June 1941, Svoboda and intelligence officer Hieke-Stoj contacted L. Krna, the deputy ambassador of the Slovak Republic (a client state of Nazi Germany) in Moscow. Hieke-Stoj persuaded the diplomat to cooperate. In connection with this action, Svoboda was detained by Soviet counter-intelligence and accused of conspiring with Germany, the enemy of the Soviet Union, and of espionage. The misunderstanding was cleared up and Svoboda was acquitted of the charges. According to the speculative considerations of some historians, at that time Svoboda &quot;committed to cooperation with the Soviet secret service, in which he remained until the end of his life&quot;. However, no evidence has been found for this claim. In Svoboda&#x27;s diary, there is an entry related to this matter, which clarifies the reason for his detention and accusation of espionage. The head of the mission, Col. Píka, neglected to announce his and other members of the mission&#x27;s contacts with the Slovak diplomat Dr. Krn. By this omission, “… he brought the mission, especially himself and me, into a very unpleasant situation, and thereby his and my position in the USSR was greatly deteriorated and confidence was shaken. I believe that this was the reason why the encryption key was demanded from us and the control over the radio traffic was tightened.&quot;

In the spring of 1942, attaché Josef Berounský sailed from Murmansk back to Great Britain on the cruiser &quot;HMS Edinburgh&quot;. He carried an important message from the head of the Czechoslovak military mission, Col. Heliodor Píka for the Czechoslovak government—a report on Czechoslovak citizens imprisoned in Soviet gulags co-signed by Lt. Col. Svoboda. On 30 April 1942, the cruiser was attacked by a German submarine and Josef Berounský died in his cabin. This event also influenced the work of Svoboda. With the death of Berounský, he lost hope that the conditions in which the Czechoslovak unit was formed would change. Svoboda blamed the Soviets for delaying the implementation of the agreement and had sharp disputes with Ambassador Zdeněk Fierlinger, the representative of the Czech government in exile, on the subject. The possibility of Svoboda going abroad was also dropped.

The activity of Svoboda throughout the rest of the war was connected with the organization and command of the Czechoslovak troops in the USSR. Svoboda, together with a group of 93 officers and non-commissioned officers that he prepared during the internment (the Oran Group), organized an independent field battalion from volunteers—Czechoslovak citizens who signed up from all over the USSR—which became the germ of the 1st Czechoslovak Army Corps. However, this battalion had to be organizationally included in the structure of the Red Army. The unit included not only Czechs, Slovaks, Ruthenians from Subcarpathian Rus, Czechoslovak Jews and expatriates living in the territory of the USSR, but also German and Hungarian anti-fascists with Czechoslovak citizenship. Svoboda also accepted women into the army, although this was not in accordance with the rules of the Czechoslovak Republic. army. With the arrival of other volunteers, especially Rusyns who came from the gulags and Slovaks who went into Soviet captivity during the war—in which the puppet Slovak state was involved on the side of the Third Reich—the battalion gradually grew into an independent mixed brigade and then into an army corps. It became the largest Czechoslovak military unit abroad. Czechoslovak soldiers served on the Eastern Front the longest of all units of the Czechoslovak foreign army fighting against Germany in the Second World War.

Before going to the front—on 30 January 1943—Svoboda was promoted to colonel. Colonel Svoboda commanded a battalion that distinguished itself at Sokolovo (in the fight against the retaliatory operation of the German army for Stalingrad and Kharkiv). He commanded a brigade that played a significant role in the liberation of the capital of Ukraine, Kiev, and in the battles for western Ukraine. In December 1943, after the liberation of Kiev, he was appointed brigadier general. The brigade under his command liberated the cities of Ruda, Bíla Cerkev and many others. At Žaškov, the brigade took part in the Battle of Korsun–Cherkassy.

On 18 May 1944, Brigadier General Jan Kratochvíl was appointed commander of the 1st Czechoslovak Army Corps. Under his command, the corps was deployed in the Carpathian-Dukel operation. &quot;On 10 September 1944, command of the 1st Czechoslovak Corps passed from Brigadier General Jan Kratochvíl to Brigadier General Ludvík Svoboda (by order of the commander of the 1st Ukrainian Front, Marshal of the USSR Konev). The change of commander was related to the unsuccessful start of the operation on 9 September 1944.&quot; Historian Jiří Bílek evaluates Kratochvíl&#x27;s dismissal as &quot;unjustified&quot;. Jan Bystrický quotes the assessment of the MS. Ministry of National Defense in London, which recognized the reasons for Koněv&#x27;s decision.

The corps was further organized on the basis of the arrival of other volunteers, especially Volyn Czechs. The corps distinguished itself in the Carpathian-Dukel operation—the largest mountain operation of the Second World War and the largest operation in the Czechoslovak Republic army in its history. The artillerymen of the army corps took part in a massive artillery training in the Jaslo operation, aimed at the liberation of Kraków and eastern Poland. The army corps was liberating Slovakia and eastern Moravia. After the mobilization of Slovaks and the involvement of local partisans, the number of soldiers increased to roughly 50,000. On 3 April 1945, General Karel Klapálek took command of the corps. A tank brigade and a mixed air division from the corps took part in the Moravia–Ostrava offensive.

In January 1945, after the entry of the corps into Slovak territory, Svoboda established a corps counterintelligence service at the direct request of Soviet General Lev Zacharovič Mechlis, a member of the military council of the 4th Ukrainian Front, who coordinated the activities of the intelligence services of the front. General Svoboda originally wanted to entrust Major František Sedláček with command of the counterintelligence service, but Gen. Mechlis advocated for First Lieutenant Bedřich Reicin and prevailed.

On 4 April 1945, President Edvard Beneš appointed Zdeněk Fierlinger&#x27;s First Cabinet. Svoboda was appointed as a non-partisan Minister of National Defense and entrusted General Klapálek with the command of the army corps. Klapálek, along with several other generals and a number of junior officers, came from England on his request. These officers reinforced the command corps of the unit. Some came to the brigade before battle of Kyiv, some even to the corps and took part in the liberation of Slovakia and eastern Moravia.

Svoboda was promoted to divisional general on 10 May 1945. He became an army corps general on 1 August 1945.

==Post-war political career==
In World War II a substantial part of Czechoslovakia was liberated by the Red Army and the 1st Czechoslovak Army Corps under the leadership of Svoboda. Svoboda was appointed Minister of Defense while being welcomed as a hero of the Eastern Front. The Soviet Union enjoyed great popularity among the population, and in the elections of 1946 the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia won 38% of the vote nationwide.

On 22 February 1948, nearly all of the non-Communist cabinet ministers resigned in protest against the practices of Communist Party chairman Klement Gottwald and the other Communists. Minister of Defense Svoboda was one of the few who remained in office. The Communist-dominated Revolutionary Trade Union Movement voted unanimously to replace the 12 departed ministers with pro-Communist ministers. As armed workers and the People&#x27;s Militias took to the streets, Svoboda refused to quell the insurrection with military force, saying &quot;the army will not march against the people&quot;. Two days later (and one day after a general strike in which 2.5 million citizens participated), President Edvard Beneš gave in to growing pressure from Gottwald and appointed a government dominated by Communists and pro-Soviet Social Democrats—in effect, giving legal sanction to a Communist coup. The takeover was completely bloodless. Svoboda, whose label had been that of an &quot;apolitical&quot; minister since the first days of his term, then joined the Communist Party and was elected as a deputy to the National Assembly at the 1948 election.

Svoboda was forced out of the army (in which he had reached the rank of Army General in November 1945) in 1950 under pressure from the Soviets. He was Deputy Prime Minister from 1950 to 1951. In the purges which followed, Svoboda was imprisoned and &quot;recommended&quot; to save his image by committing suicide, but eventually released and stripped of all offices. His return to public life took place upon a personal wish of Khrushchev, whom Svoboda had met during the war, and he subsequently headed the Klement Gottwald Military Academy.

In 1946 he was awarded the title People&#x27;s Hero of Yugoslavia. Svoboda was also awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 24 November 1965, and Hero of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (he was awarded the latter title again in 1970 and 1975). He was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize (1970).

==Presidency==

In early 1968, Antonín Novotný was forced to resign, a pivotal moment leading to the Prague Spring. Svoboda was elected President of Czechoslovakia on 30 March 1968, on the recommendation of Alexander Dubček, the First Secretary. He was an acceptable candidate for both Czechs and Slovaks, and as a war hero and a victim of the purges of the early 1950s, he enjoyed a very high esteem among the population.

President Svoboda was mildly supportive of the reform process of the new Party leadership until the Warsaw Pact intervention in August 1968. On 17 August 1968, at a meeting with the Soviet ambassador, Stepan Chervonenko, Svoboda warned against an invasion, saying it would be a &quot;catastrophe&quot; and would cause the peoples of Czechoslovakia &quot;to lose all faith in the Soviet Union for many generations to come ... Don&#x27;t you dare resort to military means to resolve the situation&quot;. Horrified at his experiences in two world wars, he signed an order preventing the Czechoslovak Army from getting involved with the invading Warsaw Pact troops. He traveled to Moscow in order to secure the release of Dubček and the other reform leaders, who had been kidnapped by the invading forces. However, when Svoboda arrived, Leonid Brezhnev demanded that he appoint a &quot;peasant-workers&#x27; government&quot; in order to give credence to the planned official line—that hardliners in the KSČ (Czechoslovak Communist Party) had themselves requested the invasion. Svoboda not only refused, but threatened to put a bullet into his head in the presence of Brezhnev unless Dubček and the other reformists were released.

Nevertheless, Svoboda could do nothing to prevent Brezhnev from forcing the Czechoslovak representatives to sign the notorious Moscow protocols. These were kept secret and permitted what an October parliamentary session would euphemistically call a &quot;temporary stay&quot; for Warsaw Pact armies in Czechoslovakia. The protocols also mandated the Party leadership to promote political, cultural and other changes to stop the reform process. Svoboda also supported Minister of Defence Martin Dzúr, who ordered the Czechoslovak army not to show any resistance.

== Normalization period ==

President Svoboda survived the removal of reformist Communists in Czechoslovakia in the aftermath of the Prague Spring, while passively witnessing the purges and the suffocation of the civil liberties that had briefly been restored. He even helped muzzle the press and contributed to Dubček&#x27;s replacement with Gustáv Husák in April 1969. To the day he died, he believed and maintained that his submissive conduct before Brezhnev helped save thousands of lives from &quot;immense consequences&quot;; and he defended this policy by invoking his own memories of the horrors of war.

Husák never trusted Svoboda, and made numerous attempts to oust him. Svoboda was able to resist until 1975, when he was forced to retire through a constitutional act (paragraph 64 Nr.143/1968 Sb.). This act stated that if the incumbent president was unable to carry out his duties for a year or more, the Federal Assembly had the right to elect a permanent successor. In Svoboda&#x27;s case, he had been in ill health for some time, making the act relevant. Husák succeeded him.

Despite being misused by politicians for their goals several times, Svoboda still enjoys some credibility among Czechs and Slovaks, probably due to his bravery during crucial moments of Czechoslovak history. Squares and streets in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia continue to bear his name, while those of most other Communist-era leaders were removed after the Velvet Revolution. His attitude can be perhaps explained in his own words: &quot;All I have ever done must be measured by my intention to serve best my people and my country.&quot;

<text>A stipulative definition is a type of definition in which a new or currently existing term is given a new specific meaning for the purposes of argument or discussion in a given context. When the term already exists, this definition may, but does not necessarily, contradict the dictionary (lexical) definition of the term. Because of this, a stipulative definition cannot be &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;incorrect&quot;; it can only differ from other definitions, but it can be useful for its intended purpose.

For example, in the riddle of induction by Nelson Goodman, &quot;grue&quot; was &quot;stipulated&quot; to be &quot;a property of an object that makes it appear green if observed before some future time &quot;t&quot;, and blue if observed afterward&quot;. &quot;Grue&quot; has no meaning in standard English; therefore, Goodman created the new term and gave it a &quot;stipulative definition&quot;.

==On stipulative definitions==
Stipulative definitions of existing terms are useful in making theoretical arguments, or stating specific cases. For example:
*Suppose we say that to love someone is to be willing to die for that person.
*Take &quot;human&quot; to mean any member of the species &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;.
*For the purposes of argument, we will define a &quot;student&quot; to be &quot;a person under 18 enrolled in a local school&quot;.

Some of these are also precising definitions, a subtype of stipulative definition that may not contradict but only extend the lexical definition of a term. Theoretical definitions, used extensively in science and philosophy, are similar in some ways to stipulative definitions (although theoretical definitions are somewhat normative, more like persuasive definitions).

Many holders of controversial and highly charged opinions use stipulative definitions to attach the emotional or other connotations of a word to the meaning they would like to give it; for example, defining &quot;murder&quot; as &quot;the killing of any living thing for any reason&quot;. The other side of such an argument is likely to use a different stipulative definition for the same term: &quot;the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought&quot; or &quot;the premeditated killing of a human being&quot;. The lexical definition in such a case is likely to fall somewhere in between.

When a stipulative definition is confused with a lexical definition within an argument there is a risk of equivocation.

<doc id="767228" wikidata="Q932482" url="?curid=767228" title="Barry Horne (activist)">
<text>Barry Horne (17 March 1952 – 5 November 2001) was an English animal rights activist. He became known around the world in December 1998 when he engaged in a 68-day hunger strike in an effort to persuade the government to hold a public inquiry into animal testing, something the Labour Party had said it would do before it came to power in 1997. The hunger strike took place while Horne was serving an 18-year sentence for planting incendiary devices in stores that sold fur coats and leather products, the longest sentence handed down to any animal rights activist by a British court.

The hunger strike left Horne with kidney damage and failing eyesight, but it was neither the first nor the last he embarked upon, and when he died of liver failure three years later, he had not eaten for 15 days. Media reaction to his death in the UK was hostile, where he was widely described as a terrorist by journalists and politicians. He is viewed as a martyr within the more radical wing of the animal rights movement.

==Early life==
Horne was born in Northampton, the son of a postman. He left school at 15 and took a series of jobs as a road sweeper and dustman.

==Activism==
===Northampton Animal Concern===
Horne became interested in animal rights at the age of 35, when his second wife, Aileen, persuaded him to attend an animal liberation meeting. After watching videos of animal testing, he decided to become a vegetarian and hunt saboteur. He became active with Northampton Animal Concern in the spring of 1987, which organised a raid of a Unilever laboratory, and picketed Beatties, a department store that sold fur coats.

===Rocky the dolphin===
Horne first came to public attention in 1988 when he tried to rescue Rocky, a bottlenose dolphin captured in 1971 off the Florida Panhandle then kept for 20 years, most of the time alone, in a small concrete pool at Marineland in Morecambe, Lancashire. Horne and four other activists planned to move Rocky, who weighed , 200 yards from the pool to the sea, using a ladder, a net, a home-made stretcher, and a hired Austin-Rover Mini Metro.

Horne and his friends had already been visiting the dolphinarium secretly at night, getting into the pool with the dolphin in an effort to get to know him. On the night of the action, after arriving at the poolside with their equipment, they realised the logistics of the operation were beyond them, and they left without Rocky. A police car stopped them on the way back to their car, which contained a large dolphin stretcher for which, as one of the activists put it, &quot;we had no legitimate explanation.&quot; After a five-day trial, they were convicted of conspiracy to steal the animal. Horne, Jim O&#x27;Donnell, Mel Broughton, and Jim Buckner were fined £500, and Horne and Broughton were given an additional six-month suspended sentence.

Horne and the others continued with their mission to free Rocky, and in 1989 launched the Morecambe Dolphinarium Campaign, picketing the dolphinarium, handing out leaflets to tourists, organising rallies, and lobbying the local council. Losing ticket sales, the management of Marineland eventually agreed to sell the dolphin for £120,000, money that was raised with the help of a number of animal charities, including the Born Free Foundation, and supported by the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot;, which launched the &quot;Into the Blue&quot; campaign to free Britain&#x27;s captive dolphins. In 1991, Rocky was transferred to an lagoon reserve in the Turks and Caicos Islands, then released, and within days was seen swimming with a pod of wild dolphins. Peter Hughes of the University of Sunderland cites Horne&#x27;s campaign as an example of how promoting an animal rights perspective created a cultural shift in the UK toward seeing dolphins as &quot;individual actors&quot; who should be viewed in the wild if tourists want to interact with them. As a result, Hughes writes, there are now no captive dolphins in the UK.

===Harlan Interfauna raid===

Together with Keith Mann and Danny Attwood, Horne was part of a small Animal Liberation Front cell that raided Harlan Interfauna, a British company in Cambridge that supplies laboratory animals and organs, on 17 March 1990, Horne&#x27;s 38th birthday. The activists entered Interfauna&#x27;s animal units through holes they punched in the roof, removing 82 beagle puppies and 26 rabbits. They also removed documents listing Interfauna&#x27;s customers, which included Boots, Glaxo, Beechams, and Huntingdon Research Centre, as well as a number of universities. A vet who was an ALF supporter removed the tattoos from the dogs&#x27; ears, and they were dispersed to new homes across the UK. As a result of evidence found at the scene and in one of the activists&#x27; homes, Mann and Attwood were convicted of conspiracy to burgle and were sentenced to nine months and 18 months respectively.

===Exeter College raid===
Early 1990s, Horne was one of a number of protesters who attacked an animal research conference at Exeter College, Oxford. They overturned tables and smashed 50 bottles of vintage claret, after fighting with police to enter the conference hall. Horne and five others were charged with violent disorder.

===1991: Imprisonment===
In 1991, Horne was sentenced to three years for possession of explosive substances. His attitude appeared to harden while in jail. In June 1993, he wrote in the &quot;Support Animal Rights Prisoners Newsletter&quot;: &quot;The animals continue to die and the torture goes on in greater and greater measure. Peoples&#x27; answer to this? More vegeburgers, more Special Brew and more apathy. There is no longer any Animal Liberation Movement. That died long ago. All that is left is a very few activists who care, who understand and who act ... If you don&#x27;t act then you condone. If you don&#x27;t fight then you don&#x27;t win. And if you don&#x27;t win then you are responsible for the death and suffering that will go on and on.&quot;

===Firebombing and arrest===
After his release in 1994, Horne reportedly began to operate alone. Keith Mann noted that the nature of police interest in animal rights activists was such that working alone was safer, and Horne was anyway a reserved man, happy to go out alone and &quot;do stuff,&quot; as he put it.

A number of night-time firebomb attacks, using home-made incendiary devices, took place over the next two years in Oxford, Cambridge, York, Harrogate, London, Bristol, as well as Newport and Ryde on the Isle of Wight. The attacks targeted Boots stores, Halfords, stores selling leather goods, and stores run by cancer research charities. Some of the attacks were claimed by the Animal Rights Militia, a name used by activists unwilling to abide by the Animal Liberation Front&#x27;s policy of non-violence. Mann writes that it &quot;wasn&#x27;t rocket science&quot; to deduce that Horne had something to do with the attacks, because very few activists were willing to plant incendiary devices, and Horne was known to be one of the hard core who would. The police were therefore watching him closely. According to Mann, Horne knew he would be caught, but he saw animal rights activism as a war, and he was willing to become a casualty. 

Police raided Horne&#x27;s home in Swindon, Wiltshire, after the bombing campaign on the Isle of Wight, and reportedly found material advocating such attacks, but he was not charged. Police kept him under surveillance, and he was arrested in July 1996 and charged with planting two incendiary devices in the Broadmead shopping centre in Bristol — one in a charity shop and the second in British Home Stores, set to explode at midnight, when he assumed they would be empty. Police found a further four devices in his pockets.

===1997: 18-year sentence===
Horne&#x27;s trial for arson began on 12 November 1997, six weeks after the end of the second hunger strike, at Bristol Crown Court. He pleaded guilty to attempted arson in Bristol, but denied involvement in the Isle of Wight attacks. Although there was no direct evidence to link Horne to the Isle of Wight incidents, the prosecution argued successfully that the devices used in Bristol and the Isle of Wight were so similar that Horne should be regarded as responsible for both. He was put through 14 ID parades but was picked out in none of them.

Judge Simon Darwall-Smith described him as an &quot;urban terrorist,&quot; though he also said, &quot;I do accept that you did not intend an attack on human life.&quot; On 5 December 1997, the judge handed down an 18-year sentence, the longest given to any animal-rights protester. Because of the similarity between the Bristol devices and others used on the Isle of Wight, Horne was also accused of having caused damage estimated at £3 million in 1994 by destroying a branch of Boots in Newport, because the company tests its products on animals. He was further accused of having set fire to department stores on the island that sold fur coats. At his trial, he admitted the Bristol charges, but denied involvement in the Isle of Wight attacks, which had been claimed by the Animal Rights Militia. Robin Webb of the Animal Liberation Press Office writes that he himself narrowly escaped a conspiracy charge over the same incidents.

==Hunger strikes==
===January 1997: 35 days===
On 6 January 1997, six months after being jailed on remand for the firebombings, as a Category A prisoner, Horne announced that he would refuse all food unless John Major&#x27;s Conservative government pledged to withdraw its support for animal testing within five years. Because Labour was regarded as likely to win the next general election, due to be held in May 1997, Horne ended his action on 9 February after 35 days without food, when Elliot Morley, then Labour animal welfare spokesperson, wrote that &quot;Labour is committed to a reduction and an eventual end to vivisection.&quot;

The hunger strike sparked an increase in animal rights activism, including the removal of cats from Hill Grove farm in Oxfordshire, which bred cats for laboratories; damage to Harlan breeding centre and the removal of beagles from Consort Kennels; the destruction of seven lorries at Buxted poultry plant in Northamptonshire; a blockade of the port of Dover and heavy damage to a McDonald&#x27;s in the town; and the removal of rabbits being bred for vivisection in Homestead Farm.

===August 1997: 46 days===
The second hunger strike began on 11 August 1997. Horne&#x27;s aim was that the new Labour government withdraw all animal testing licences within an agreed timeframe. There was another increase in animal-rights activism in his support. On 12 September 1997, protests were held in London and Southampton in the UK, in The Hague, in Cleveland, US and at Umeå University in Sweden, where activists tried to storm the university&#x27;s laboratories. Four hundred people marched on Shamrock Farm, a primate-holding facility near Brighton, 300 on Wickham Laboratories, a contract testing facility, and Labour Party offices were picketed, as was the home of Jack Straw, the Home Secretary. Activists set up a camp opposite Huntingdon Life Sciences on the A1 in Cambridgeshire, digging tunnels to make eviction harder. Newchurch guinea pig farm was raided in September and 600 guinea pigs removed.

Horne ended the hunger strike on 26 September, after 46 days without food, when Lord Williams of Mostyn, then a Home Office minister and later Attorney-General, contacted Horne&#x27;s supporters with an offer of talks between them and the government. This was the first time a member of the government had agreed formally to talk to the animal liberation movement, and it was seen by Horne and his supporters as an important step forward.

===October 1998: 68 days===
Horne&#x27;s longest hunger strike began on 6 October 1998 and ended 68 days later on 13 December. It brought the issue of animal experimentation to the forefront of British politics, while his deteriorating condition made headlines around the world, as activists threatened further disruption should he die, with some issuing death threats against several scientists.

This time, Horne&#x27;s demands were extensive and specific. He asked for an end to issuing licences for animal experiments, and that no current licences be renewed; a ban on all vivisection conducted for non-medical purposes; a commitment to end all vivisection by 6 January 2002; an immediate end to all animal experimentation at the Porton Down defence establishment; and the closure of the Animal Procedures Committee, a government advisory body that Horne regarded as a &quot;Government sponsored front for the vivisection industry.&quot; He issued a statement, now quoted by the movement as a rallying cry:

The fight is not for us, not for our personal wants and needs. It is for every animal that has ever suffered and died in the vivisection labs, and for every animal that will suffer and die in those same labs unless we end this evil business now. The souls of the tortured dead cry out for justice, the cry of the living is for freedom. We can create that justice and we can deliver that freedom. The animals have no one but us. We will not fail them.

Keith Mann writes that, this time, Horne found the hunger strike tougher going, perhaps because of the physical damage from the first two. He was in D Wing in Full Sutton prison to begin with, then was moved to the hospital wing on day 10 without food, where he was reportedly placed in the &quot;hunger strike cell&quot; with no toilet or sink and with just a cardboard chair and cardboard table. He was moved to a regular cell after pressure from supporters. He was read the Last Rites on day 43, having lost 25 per cent of his body fat.

The Labour government publicly refused to give in to what it called blackmail, and said it would not negotiate with Horne or his supporters, but privately, it held talks with them. Horne&#x27;s MP, Tony Clarke, visited Horne in prison on 12 November to negotiate another meeting between Horne&#x27;s supporters and the Home Office, which took place on 19 November, 44 days into the strike. After the meeting, Horne released a statement saying there was nothing new on offer, and that his hunger strike would continue. He then reduced his demands to asking for a Royal Commission on animal testing, which the Labour Party had indicated that it would hold if elected.

On day 46, he was moved to York Hospital, suffering from dehydration after having spent the week vomiting. By day 52, he was reportedly in severe pain, was finding it hard to see, and was danger of falling into a coma. According to Mann, his supporters were bringing him tape recordings of the talks with the government, which he was having difficulty concentrating on. Mann writes that Horne decided to take some orange juice and sweet tea for three days, in order to stave off the coma so that he could understand the negotiations. This later caused the media to refer to the hunger strike as a fraud.

====Activism in support of Horne====

There was an international response by activists in support of Horne. In York and London, protesters kept vigil outside the hospital, and opposite the Houses of Parliament in Westminster, holding candles, placards, and photographs of Horne, joined at one point by Alan Clark, the Conservative Member of Parliament, who despite his support for the cause referred to the protesters in his diary as &quot;dysfunctional.&quot;

On 24 November, at the State Opening of Parliament, activists dropped a banner in support of Horne in front of the Queen&#x27;s official car as it drove towards the Houses of Parliament. Shortly after this, two activists parked a car at the end of Downing Street, slashed its tyres, and used D-Locks to attach themselves by the neck to the steering wheel, while protesters demonstrated nearby. Activists marched on BIBRA labs in south-west London and at Windmill mink farm in Dorset. In Finland, 400 foxes and 200 racoons were released from a fur farm. The offices of the Research Defence Society in London were raided. Demonstrations were held outside British embassies and consulates around the world, laboratories were raided, and government buildings picketed.

====Death threats====
When it appeared that Horne might die, the Animal Rights Militia (ARM) issued a statement through Robin Webb of the Animal Liberation Press Office, threatening to assassinate four named individuals and six unnamed scientists, should Horne die. The named targets were Colin Blakemore, a British scientist who studies vision; Clive Page of King&#x27;s College, London, a professor of pulmonary pharmacology and chair of the animal science group of the British Biosciences Federation; Mark Matfield of the Research Defence Society; and Christopher Brown, owner of Hill Grove Farm in Oxfordshire, who was breeding cats for laboratories.

Those on the ARM&#x27;s list were given immediate police protection, which in some cases lasted years, and Special Branch increased its surveillance of activists, in particular of Robin Webb. Clive Page told the BBC that he was in Italy when he heard his name was on the list. He had to return home to explain the situation to his family. &quot;It&#x27;s difficult to tell your children, &#x27;Daddy&#x27;s going to be murdered&#x27;,&quot; he said. The police wired his home up directly to Special Branch, he was advised to take different routes each day to work, and he had to speak to his children&#x27;s schools about the possibility of abduction.

====Moved back to prison====
By day 63, Horne was deaf in one ear, blind in one eye, his liver was failing, and he was in considerable pain. A meeting was arranged for day 66 at noon with his supporters to show him the documents that were being faxed through by the Home Office regarding offers the government might be willing to make. It was agreed that, if there was any substance to them, Horne would call off the strike. Early on the morning of 10 December 1998, the 66th day of his hunger strike, Horne was moved out of hospital and back to Full Sutton Prison. The Home Office said that, because he was refusing treatment, there was no need for him to be in hospital. By now, Horne was hallucinating and could no longer remember why he was on hunger strike.

====End of the hunger strike====
There are two versions of why Horne ended the hunger strike. Mann wrote that Horne called it off without explanation two days after being moved back to prison, and was promptly returned to the hospital. The media reported that a Labour MP had arranged for Michael Banner, the chair of the Animal Procedures Committee, to agree to attend a meeting with Ian Cawsey, head of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Animal Welfare, to discuss animal testing practices in the UK. This was interpreted by Horne as a concession on the part of the government, and he agreed to start eating again on 13 December 1998. His friends suspect that something happened to him during the two days he was back in Full Sutton out of contact with them. Mann writes: &quot;Whatever happened to him between leaving the hospital and returning to prison may never be known, but all those close to him suspect something did and he was never the same again.&quot;

The British media response to the end of the hunger strike was hostile. Newspapers focused on the period Horne had been drinking orange juice and sweet tea, writing that the hunger strike had been a fraud throughout. Mann wrote that the media turned three days of trying to stabilise his condition with sips of sweet liquid into &quot;68 days of feasting.&quot;

===October 2001: 15 days===

Horne did not recover his physical health. Mann wrote that he continued to go on countless hunger strikes in prison without any cohesive strategy and with little support. It got to the point where no one apart from the guards knew whether he was eating or not. He embarked on his final hunger strike on 21 October 2001, and died 15 days later of liver failure. He had signed a directive refusing medical treatment, and was regarded by psychiatrists as of sound mind, which caused the prison authorities not to intervene.

The hostile media response continued after his death. Kevin Toolis wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot;: In life he was a nobody, a failed dustman turned firebomber. But in death Barry Horne will rise up as the first true martyr of the most successful terrorist group Britain has ever known, the animal rights movement. He was buried in his home town of Northampton under an oak tree in a woodland cemetery, wearing a Northampton Town football shirt. Seven hundred people attended the pagan funeral service and accompanied the coffin through the town, carrying a banner that read: &quot;Labour lied, Barry died&quot;.

<text>In computing, an X terminal is a display/input terminal for X Window System client applications. X terminals enjoyed a period of popularity in the early 1990s when they offered a lower total cost of ownership alternative to a full Unix workstation.

An X terminal runs an &#x27;X server&#x27;. In X, the usage of &quot;client&quot; and &quot;server&quot; is from the viewpoint of the programs: the X server supplies a screen, keyboard, mouse and touchscreen to client applications. This connects to an X display manager (introduced in X11R3) running on a central machine, using XDMCP (X Display Manager Control Protocol, introduced in X11R4).

Thin clients have somewhat supplanted X terminals in that they are equipped with added flash memory and software for communication with remote desktop protocols.

==Vendors==
In the early 1990s, several vendors introduced X terminals including HP, DEC (including the VT1000 series), IBM, Samsung, NCD, Gipsi, Tektronix, and Visual Technology.

<text>Moses Ilyich Schönfinkel (; 29 September 1888 – ) was a logician and mathematician, known for the invention of combinatory logic.

==Life==
Moses Schönfinkel was born on in Ekaterinoslav, Russian Empire (now Dnipro, Ukraine). Moses Schönfinkel was born to a Jewish family. His father was Ilya Girshevich Schönfinkel, a merchant of first guild, who was in а grocery store trade, and his mother, Maria “Masha” Gertsovna Schönfinkel (née Lurie) came from a prominent Lurie family. Moses had siblings named Deborah, Natan, Israel and Grigoriy. Schönfinkel attended the Novorossiysk University of Odessa, studying mathematics under Samuil Osipovich Shatunovskii (1859–1929), who worked in geometry and the foundations of mathematics. From 1914 to 1924, Schönfinkel was a member of David Hilbert&#x27;s group at the University of Göttingen in Germany. On 7 December 1920 he delivered a talk entitled &quot;Elemente der Logik&quot; (&quot;Elements of Logic&quot;) to the group where he outlined the concept of combinatory logic. Heinrich Behmann, a member of Hilbert&#x27;s group, later revised the text and published it in 1924. In 1928, Schönfinkel had one other paper published, on special cases of the decision problem (&quot;Entscheidungsproblem&quot;), that was prepared by Paul Bernays.

After he left Göttingen, Schönfinkel returned to Moscow. By 1927 he was reported to be mentally ill and in a sanatorium. His later life was spent in poverty, and he died in Moscow some time in . His papers were burned by his neighbors for heating.

==Work==
Schönfinkel developed a formal system that avoided the use of bound variables. His system was essentially equivalent to a combinatory logic based upon the combinators B, C, I, K, S and a combinator for a universally quantified nand function which he called U. Schönfinkel stated that the system could be reduced to just K, S, and U (a colleague stated that U could be factored to the end of any expression and thus not always explicitly written) and outlined a proof that a version of this system had the same power as predicate logic.

His paper also showed that functions of two or more arguments could be replaced by functions taking a single argument. This replacement mechanism simplifies work in both combinatory logic and lambda calculus and would later be called currying, after Haskell Curry. While Curry attributed the concept to Schönfinkel, it had already been used by Frege (an example of Stigler&#x27;s law).

The complete known published output of Schönfinkel consists of just two papers: his 1924 &quot;On the Building Blocks of Mathematical Logic&quot;, and another, 31-page paper written in 1927 and published 1928, coauthored with Paul Bernays, entitled &quot;Zum Entscheidungsproblem der mathematischen Logik&quot; (&quot;On the Decision Problem of Mathematical Logic&quot;).

<doc id="767242" wikidata="Q1755764" url="?curid=767242" title="Tactile corpuscle">
<text>Tactile corpuscles or Meissner&#x27;s corpuscles are a type of mechanoreceptor discovered by anatomist Georg Meissner (1829–1905) and Rudolf Wagner. This corpuscle is a type of nerve ending in the skin that is responsible for sensitivity to pressure. In particular, they have their highest sensitivity (lowest threshold) when sensing vibrations between 10 and 50 hertz. They are rapidly adaptive receptors. They are most concentrated in thick hairless skin, especially at the finger pads.

==Structure==
Tactile corpuscles are encapsulated myelinated nerve endings, surrounded by Schwann cells. The encapsulation consists of flattened supportive cells arranged as horizontal lamellae surrounded by a connective tissue capsule. The corpuscle is 30–140 μm in length and 40–60 μm in diameter. A single nerve fiber meanders between the lamellae and throughout the corpuscle.

===Location===
They are distributed on various areas of the skin, but concentrated in areas especially sensitive to light touch, such as the fingers, lips and male prepuce.
More specifically, they are primarily located in glabrous skin just beneath the epidermis within the dermal papillae.

===Comparison with other receptors===
Feelings of deep pressure (from a poke, for instance) are generated from lamellar corpuscles (the only other type of phasic tactile mechanoreceptor), which are located deeper in the dermis, and some free nerve endings.

Also, tactile corpuscles do not detect noxious stimuli; this is signaled exclusively by free nerve endings.

==Development==
The number of tactile corpuscles per square millimeter of human skin on the fingertips drops fourfold between the ages of 12 and 50. The rate at which they are lost correlates well with the age-related loss in touch sensitivity for small probes.

==Function==
Tactile corpuscles are rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors. They are sensitive to shape and textural changes in exploratory and discriminatory touch. Their acute sensitivity provides the neural basis for reading Braille text. Because of their superficial location in the dermis, these corpuscles are particularly sensitive to touch and vibrations, but for the same reasons, they are limited in their detection because they can only signal that something is touching the skin.

Any physical deformation of the corpuscle will cause sodium ions to enter it, creating an action potential in the corpuscle&#x27;s nerve fiber. Since they are rapidly adapting or phasic, the action potentials generated quickly decrease and eventually cease (this is the reason one stops &quot;feeling&quot; one&#x27;s clothes).

If the stimulus is removed, the corpuscle regains its shape and while doing so (i.e.: while physically reforming) causes another volley of action potentials to be generated.

<doc id="767251" wikidata="Q314905" url="?curid=767251" title="Bertrand du Guesclin">
<text>Bertrand du Guesclin (; 1320 – 13 July 1380), nicknamed &quot;The Eagle of Brittany&quot; or &quot;The Black Dog of [[Brocéliande]]&quot;, was a Breton knight and an important military commander on the French side during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. From 1370 to his death, he was Constable of France for King Charles V. Well known for his Fabian strategy, he took part in seven pitched battles and won the five in which he held command.

== Origins ==

Bertrand du Guesclin was born at Motte-Broons near Dinan, in Brittany, first-born son of Robert du Guesclin and Jeanne de Malmaines. His date of birth is unknown but is thought to have been sometime in 1320. His family was of minor Breton nobility, the seigneurs of Broons.
His native language was Gallo, a langue d&#x27;oïl.

Bertrand&#x27;s family may have claimed descent from Aquin, the legendary Muslim king of Bougie in Africa (Viking in effect, the legend conflates Saracens and Arabs with Normans and places Aiquin&#x27;s origins in the north country) a conceit derived from the &quot;Roman d&#x27;Aquin&quot;, a thirteenth-century French &quot;chanson de geste&quot; from Brittany.

==Career==
=== Service in Brittany ===
He initially served Charles of Blois in the Breton War of Succession (1341–1364). Charles was supported by the French crown, while his rival, Jean de Montfort, was allied with England. 

Du Guesclin was knighted in 1354 while serving Arnoul d&#x27;Audrehem, after countering a raid by Hugh Calveley on the Castle of Montmuran. In 1356–57, Du Guesclin successfully defended Rennes against a Breton-English siege by Henry of Grosmont, using guerrilla tactics. During the siege, he killed the English knight William Bamborough who had challenged him to a duel.

The resistance of du Guesclin helped restore Breton-French morale after Poitiers, and du Guesclin came to the attention of the Dauphin Charles.

When he became King in 1364, Charles sent Du Guesclin to deal with Charles II of Navarre, who hoped to claim the Duchy of Burgundy, which Charles hoped to give to his brother, Philip. On 16 May, he met an Anglo-Navarrese army under the command of Jean de Grailly, Captal de Buch at Cocherel and proved his ability in pitched battle by routing the enemy. The victory forced Charles II into a new peace with the French king, and secured Burgundy for Philip.

On 29 September 1364, at the Battle of Auray, the army of Charles of Blois was heavily defeated by John IV, Duke of Brittany and the English forces under Sir John Chandos. De Blois was killed in action, ending the pretensions of the Penthievre faction in Brittany. After chivalric resistance, Du Guesclin broke his weapons to signify his surrender. He was captured and ransomed back to Charles V for 100,000 francs.

=== Service in Castile===

In 1366, Bertrand persuaded the leaders of the &quot;free companies&quot;, who had been pillaging France after the Treaty of Brétigny, to join him in an expedition to Castile to aid Count Henry of Trastámara against Pedro I of Castile. In 1366, du Guesclin, with Guillaume Boitel, his faithful companion, leader of his vanguard, captured many fortresses (Magallón, Briviesca and finally the capital Burgos). 

After Henry&#x27;s coronation at Burgos, he proclaimed Bertrand his successor as Count of Trastámara and had him crowned as King of Granada, although that kingdom was yet to be reconquered from the Nasrids. Bertrand&#x27;s elevation must have taken place at Burgos between 16 March and 5 April 1366.

Henry&#x27;s army was however defeated in 1367 by Pedro&#x27;s forces, now commanded by Edward, the Black Prince, at Nájera. Du Guesclin was again captured, and again ransomed to Charles V, who considered him invaluable. However, the English army suffered badly in the battle as four English soldiers out of five died during the Castilian Campaign. The Black Prince, affected by dysentery, soon withdrew his support from Pedro.

Du Guesclin and Henry of Trastámara renewed the attack, defeating Pedro at the decisive Battle of Montiel (1369). 

After the battle, Pedro fled to the castle at Montiel, from whence he made contact with du Guesclin, whose army was camped outside. Pedro bribed du Guesclin to obtain escape. Du Guesclin agreed, but also told it to Henry who promised him more money and land if he would only lead Pedro to Henry&#x27;s tent. Once there, after crossed accusations of bastardy, the two half-brothers started a fight to the death, using daggers because of the narrow space. At a moment when they fought on the floor, Pedro got the upper hand and was about to finish Henry. But then Du Guesclin, who had stayed inactive for he was compromised to both, made his final choice. He grabbed Pedro&#x27;s ankle and turned him belly-up, thus allowing Henry to stab Pedro to death and gain the throne of Castile. While turning Pedro down, du Guesclin is claimed to have said &quot;Ni quito ni pongo rey, pero ayudo a mi señor&quot; (I neither remove nor put a King, but I do help my Sire), which has since that moment become a common phrase in Spanish, to be used by anyone of lesser rank who does what he is ordered or expected to do, avoiding any concern about the justice or injustice of such action, and declining any responsibility.

Bertrand was made Duke of Molina, and the Franco-Castilian alliance was sealed.

=== Constable of France ===
War with England was renewed in 1369, and Du Guesclin was recalled from Castile in 1370 by Charles V, who had decided to make him Constable of France, the country&#x27;s chief military leader. By tradition, this post was always given to a great nobleman, not to someone like the comparatively low-born Du Guesclin, but Charles needed someone who was an outstanding professional soldier. In practice, du Guesclin had continual difficulties in getting aristocratic leaders to serve under him, and the core of his armies was always his personal retinue. He was formally invested with the rank of Constable by the King on 2 October 1370. 

He immediately defeated the remnant of an English army, which had been led by Robert Knolles until his retreat at Du Guesclin&#x27;s coming, at the Battle of Pontvallain, and then reconquered Poitou and Saintonge, forcing the Black Prince to leave France.

In 1372, the Franco-Castillan fleet destroyed the English fleet at the Battle of La Rochelle, where more than 400 English knights and 8000 soldiers were captured. Master of the Channel, du Guesclin organized destructive raids on the English coasts in retaliation for the English chevauchées.

Du Guesclin pursued the English into Brittany from 1370 to 1374 and again defeated the English army at the Battle of Chizé in 1373.

He disapproved of the confiscation of Brittany by Charles V in 1378, and his campaign to make the independent duchy submit to a French king was halfhearted.

==== Death and burial ====
An able tactician and a loyal and disciplined warrior, Du Guesclin had reconquered much of France from the English when he died of illness at Châteauneuf-de-Randon while on a military expedition in Languedoc in 1380. He was buried at Saint-Denis in the tomb of the Kings of France, which was later sacked and destroyed during the French Revolution. His heart is kept at the basilica of Saint-Sauveur at Dinan.

== Later reputation ==
Because of du Guesclin&#x27;s allegiance to France, the 20th century Breton nationalists considered him to be a &#x27;traitor&#x27; to Brittany. During World War II, the pro-Nazi Breton Social-National Workers&#x27; Movement destroyed a statue of him in Rennes. In 1977 the Breton Liberation Front destroyed a statue of him in Broons.

Bertrand du Guesclin appears as a character in Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s 1891 historical novel &quot;The White Company&quot;, set in 1366. The protagonists first encounter him in Chapter 24, &quot;How a Champion Came Forth From the East to the Lists&quot;, and again in Chapter 28, &quot;How the Comrades Came over the Marches of France&quot;.

He is also a major character in the trilogy of Dutch historical youth novels &quot;Geef me de Ruimte&quot;, by Thea Beckman, the first part of which was published in 1976. The main protagonist, a free-spirited young Flemish woman, ends up in Brittany during the 100 Years&#x27; War. She and her husband first meet Bertrand in 1353, and become his Trouvères in 1354 after the Battle of Montmuran.

<doc id="767253" wikidata="Q2046647" url="?curid=767253" title="Kosambi–Karhunen–Loève theorem">
<text>In the theory of stochastic processes, the Karhunen–Loève theorem (named after Kari Karhunen and Michel Loève), also known as the Kosambi–Karhunen–Loève theorem states that a stochastic process can be represented as an infinite linear combination of orthogonal functions, analogous to a Fourier series representation of a function on a bounded interval. The transformation is also known as Hotelling transform and eigenvector transform, and is closely related to principal component analysis (PCA) technique widely used in image processing and in data analysis in many fields.

There exist many such expansions of a stochastic process: if the process is indexed over , any orthonormal basis of yields an expansion thereof in that form. The importance of the Karhunen–Loève theorem is that it yields the best such basis in the sense that it minimizes the total mean squared error.

In contrast to a Fourier series where the coefficients are fixed numbers and the expansion basis consists of sinusoidal functions (that is, sine and cosine functions), the coefficients in the Karhunen–Loève theorem are random variables and the expansion basis depends on the process. In fact, the orthogonal basis functions used in this representation are determined by the covariance function of the process. One can think that the Karhunen–Loève transform adapts to the process in order to produce the best possible basis for its expansion.

In the case of a &quot;centered&quot; stochastic process (&quot;centered&quot; means for all ) satisfying a technical continuity condition, admits a decomposition

:formula_1

where are pairwise uncorrelated random variables and the functions are continuous real-valued functions on that are pairwise orthogonal in . It is therefore sometimes said that the expansion is &quot;bi-orthogonal&quot; since the random coefficients are orthogonal in the probability space while the deterministic functions are orthogonal in the time domain. The general case of a process that is not centered can be brought back to the case of a centered process by considering which is a centered process.

Moreover, if the process is Gaussian, then the random variables are Gaussian and stochastically independent. This result generalizes the &quot;Karhunen–Loève transform&quot;. An important example of a centered real stochastic process on is the Wiener process; the Karhunen–Loève theorem can be used to provide a canonical orthogonal representation for it. In this case the expansion consists of sinusoidal functions.

The above expansion into uncorrelated random variables is also known as the &quot;Karhunen–Loève expansion&quot; or &quot;Karhunen–Loève decomposition&quot;. The empirical version (i.e., with the coefficients computed from a sample) is known as the &quot;Karhunen–Loève transform&quot; (KLT), &quot;principal component analysis&quot;, &quot;proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)&quot;, &quot;empirical orthogonal functions&quot; (a term used in meteorology and geophysics), or the &quot;Hotelling transform&quot;.

== Formulation ==
*Throughout this article, we will consider a random process defined over a probability space and indexed over a closed interval , which is square-integrable, has zero-mean, and with covariance function . In other words, we have: 
::formula_2
::formula_3
::formula_4

The square-integrable condition formula_5 is logically equivalent to formula_6 being finite for all formula_7.

*We associate to a linear operator (more specifically a Hilbert–Schmidt integral operator) defined in the following way:
::formula_8
:Since is a linear operator, it makes sense to talk about its eigenvalues &quot;λk&quot; and eigenfunctions , which are found solving the homogeneous Fredholm integral equation of the second kind 
::formula_9

== Statement of the theorem ==
Theorem. Let be a zero-mean square-integrable stochastic process defined over a probability space and indexed over a closed and bounded interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;], with continuous covariance function .

Then is a Mercer kernel and letting be an orthonormal basis on formed by the eigenfunctions of with respective eigenvalues admits the following representation

:formula_10

where the convergence is in , uniform in &quot;t&quot; and

:formula_11

Furthermore, the random variables have zero-mean, are uncorrelated and have variance &quot;λk&quot;

:formula_12

Note that by generalizations of Mercer&#x27;s theorem we can replace the interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] with other compact spaces &quot;C&quot; and the Lebesgue measure on [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] with a Borel measure whose support is &quot;C&quot;.

==Proof==
*The covariance function satisfies the definition of a Mercer kernel. By Mercer&#x27;s theorem, there consequently exists a set , of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of forming an orthonormal basis of , and can be expressed as
::formula_13

*The process can be expanded in terms of the eigenfunctions as:
::formula_10
:where the coefficients (random variables) are given by the projection of on the respective eigenfunctions
::formula_15

*We may then derive
::formula_16
:where we have used the fact that the are eigenfunctions of and are orthonormal.

*Let us now show that the convergence is in . Let 
::formula_17
:Then:
::formula_18
:which goes to 0 by Mercer&#x27;s theorem.

== Properties of the Karhunen–Loève transform ==

=== Special case: Gaussian distribution ===
Since the limit in the mean of jointly Gaussian random variables is jointly Gaussian, and jointly Gaussian random (centered) variables are independent if and only if they are orthogonal, we can also conclude:

Theorem. The variables have a joint Gaussian distribution and are stochastically independent if the original process is Gaussian.

In the Gaussian case, since the variables are independent, we can say more:

:formula_19
almost surely.

=== The Karhunen–Loève transform decorrelates the process ===
This is a consequence of the independence of the .

=== The Karhunen–Loève expansion minimizes the total mean square error ===
In the introduction, we mentioned that the truncated Karhunen–Loeve expansion was the best approximation of the original process in the sense that it reduces the total mean-square error resulting of its truncation. Because of this property, it is often said that the KL transform optimally compacts the energy.

More specifically, given any orthonormal basis } of , we may decompose the process as:

:formula_20

where

:formula_21

and we may approximate by the finite sum

:formula_22

for some integer &quot;N&quot;.

Claim. Of all such approximations, the KL approximation is the one that minimizes the total mean square error (provided we have arranged the eigenvalues in decreasing order).
=== Explained variance ===
An important observation is that since the random coefficients &quot;Z&quot;&quot;k&quot; of the KL expansion are uncorrelated, the Bienaymé formula asserts that the variance of &quot;X&quot;&quot;t&quot; is simply the sum of the variances of the individual components of the sum:

:formula_23

Integrating over [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] and using the orthonormality of the &quot;e&quot;&quot;k&quot;, we obtain that the total variance of the process is:

:formula_24

In particular, the total variance of the &quot;N&quot;-truncated approximation is

:formula_25

As a result, the &quot;N&quot;-truncated expansion explains

:formula_26

of the variance; and if we are content with an approximation that explains, say, 95% of the variance, then we just have to determine an formula_27 such that

:formula_28

=== The Karhunen–Loève expansion has the minimum representation entropy property ===
Given a representation of formula_29, for some orthonormal basis formula_30 and random formula_31, we let formula_32, so that formula_33. We may then define the representation entropy to be formula_34. Then we have formula_35, for all choices of formula_36. That is, the KL-expansion has minimal representation entropy.

Proof:

Denote the coefficients obtained for the basis formula_37 as formula_38, and for formula_30 as formula_40.

Choose formula_41. Note that since formula_42 minimizes the mean squared error, we have that

: formula_43

Expanding the right hand size, we get:

: formula_44

Using the orthonormality of formula_30, and expanding formula_46 in the formula_30 basis, we get that the right hand size is equal to:

: formula_48

We may perform identical analysis for the formula_37, and so rewrite the above inequality as:

: formula_50

Subtracting the common first term, and dividing by formula_51, we obtain that:

: formula_52

This implies that:

: formula_53

== Linear Karhunen–Loève approximations ==
Consider a whole class of signals we want to approximate over the first vectors of a basis. These signals are modeled as realizations of a random vector of size . To optimize the approximation we design a basis that minimizes the average approximation error. This section proves that optimal bases are Karhunen–Loeve bases that diagonalize the covariance matrix of . The random vector can be decomposed in an orthogonal basis

:formula_54

as follows:

:formula_55

where each

:formula_56

is a random variable. The approximation from the first vectors of the basis is

:formula_57

The energy conservation in an orthogonal basis implies

:formula_58

This error is related to the covariance of defined by

:formula_59

For any vector we denote by the covariance operator represented by this matrix,

:formula_60

The error is therefore a sum of the last coefficients of the covariance operator

:formula_61

The covariance operator is Hermitian and Positive and is thus diagonalized in an orthogonal basis called a Karhunen–Loève basis. The following theorem states that a Karhunen–Loève basis is optimal for linear approximations.

Theorem (Optimality of Karhunen–Loève basis). Let be a covariance operator. For all , the approximation error

:formula_62

is minimum if and only if

:formula_63

is a Karhunen–Loeve basis ordered by decreasing eigenvalues.

:formula_64

== Non-Linear approximation in bases ==
Linear approximations project the signal on &quot;M&quot; vectors a priori. The approximation can be made more precise by choosing the &quot;M&quot; orthogonal vectors depending on the signal properties. This section analyzes the general performance of these non-linear approximations. A signal formula_65 is approximated with M vectors selected adaptively in an orthonormal basis for formula_66

:formula_67

Let formula_68 be the projection of f over M vectors whose indices are in :

:formula_69

The approximation error is the sum of the remaining coefficients

:formula_70

To minimize this error, the indices in must correspond to the M vectors having the largest inner product amplitude

:formula_71

These are the vectors that best correlate f. They can thus be interpreted as the main features of f. The resulting error is necessarily smaller than the error of a linear approximation which selects the M approximation vectors independently of f. Let us sort

:formula_72

in decreasing order

:formula_73

The best non-linear approximation is

:formula_74

It can also be written as inner product thresholding:

:formula_75

with

:formula_76

The non-linear error is

:formula_77

this error goes quickly to zero as M increases, if the sorted values of formula_78 have a fast decay as k increases. This decay is quantified by computing the formula_79 norm of the signal inner products in B:

:formula_80

The following theorem relates the decay of to formula_81

Theorem (decay of error). If formula_82 with then

:formula_83
and
:formula_84
Conversely, if formula_85 then

formula_86 for any .

=== Non-optimality of Karhunen–Loève bases ===
To further illustrate the differences between linear and non-linear approximations, we study the decomposition of a simple non-Gaussian random vector in a Karhunen–Loève basis. Processes whose realizations have a random translation are stationary. The Karhunen–Loève basis is then a Fourier basis and we study its performance. To simplify the analysis, consider a random vector &quot;Y&quot;[&quot;n&quot;] of size &quot;N&quot; that is random shift modulo &quot;N&quot; of a deterministic signal &quot;f&quot;[&quot;n&quot;] of zero mean

:formula_87
:formula_88

The random shift &quot;P&quot; is uniformly distributed on [0, &quot;N&quot; − 1]:

:formula_89

Clearly

:formula_90

and

:formula_91

Hence

:formula_92

Since RY is N periodic, Y is a circular stationary random vector. The covariance operator is a circular convolution with RY and is therefore diagonalized in the discrete Fourier Karhunen–Loève basis

:formula_93

The power spectrum is Fourier transform of :

:formula_94

Example: Consider an extreme case where formula_95. A theorem stated above guarantees that the Fourier Karhunen–Loève basis produces a smaller expected approximation error than a canonical basis of Diracs formula_96. Indeed, we do not know a priori the abscissa of the non-zero coefficients of &quot;Y&quot;, so there is no particular Dirac that is better adapted to perform the approximation. But the Fourier vectors cover the whole support of Y and thus absorb a part of the signal energy.

:formula_97

Selecting higher frequency Fourier coefficients yields a better mean-square approximation than choosing a priori a few Dirac vectors to perform the approximation. The situation is totally different for non-linear approximations. If formula_98 then the discrete Fourier basis is extremely inefficient because f and hence Y have an energy that is almost uniformly spread among all Fourier vectors. In contrast, since f has only two non-zero coefficients in the Dirac basis, a non-linear approximation of Y with gives zero error.

== Principal component analysis ==
We have established the Karhunen–Loève theorem and derived a few properties thereof. We also noted that one hurdle in its application was the numerical cost of determining the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of its covariance operator through the Fredholm integral equation of the second kind

:formula_99

However, when applied to a discrete and finite process formula_100, the problem takes a much simpler form and standard algebra can be used to carry out the calculations.

Note that a continuous process can also be sampled at &quot;N&quot; points in time in order to reduce the problem to a finite version.

We henceforth consider a random &quot;N&quot;-dimensional vector formula_101. As mentioned above, &quot;X&quot; could contain &quot;N&quot; samples of a signal but it can hold many more representations depending on the field of application. For instance it could be the answers to a survey or economic data in an econometrics analysis.

As in the continuous version, we assume that &quot;X&quot; is centered, otherwise we can let formula_102 (where formula_103 is the mean vector of &quot;X&quot;) which is centered.

Let us adapt the procedure to the discrete case.

=== Covariance matrix ===
Recall that the main implication and difficulty of the KL transformation is computing the eigenvectors of the linear operator associated to the covariance function, which are given by the solutions to the integral equation written above.

Define Σ, the covariance matrix of &quot;X&quot;, as an &quot;N&quot; × &quot;N&quot; matrix whose elements are given by:
:formula_104

Rewriting the above integral equation to suit the discrete case, we observe that it turns into:

:formula_105

where formula_106 is an &quot;N&quot;-dimensional vector.

The integral equation thus reduces to a simple matrix eigenvalue problem, which explains why the PCA has such a broad domain of applications.

Since Σ is a positive definite symmetric matrix, it possesses a set of orthonormal eigenvectors forming a basis of formula_107, and we write formula_108 this set of eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors, listed in decreasing values of . Let also be the orthonormal matrix consisting of these eigenvectors:

:formula_109

=== Principal component transform ===
It remains to perform the actual KL transformation, called the &quot;principal component transform&quot; in this case. Recall that the transform was found by expanding the process with respect to the basis spanned by the eigenvectors of the covariance function. In this case, we hence have:

:formula_110

In a more compact form, the principal component transform of &quot;X&quot; is defined by:
:formula_111

The &quot;i&quot;-th component of &quot;Y&quot; is formula_112, the projection of &quot;X&quot; on formula_113 and the inverse transform yields the expansion of on the space spanned by the formula_113:

:formula_115

As in the continuous case, we may reduce the dimensionality of the problem by truncating the sum at some formula_116 such that

:formula_117

where α is the explained variance threshold we wish to set.

We can also reduce the dimensionality through the use of multilevel dominant eigenvector estimation (MDEE).

== Examples ==

=== The Wiener process ===
There are numerous equivalent characterizations of the Wiener process which is a mathematical formalization of Brownian motion. Here we regard it as the centered standard Gaussian process W&quot;t&quot; with covariance function
:formula_118

We restrict the time domain to [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]=[0,1] without loss of generality.

The eigenvectors of the covariance kernel are easily determined. These are
:formula_119
and the corresponding eigenvalues are
:formula_120
\right)+B\cos\left(\frac{t}{\sqrt{\lambda}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are two constants to be determined with the boundary conditions. Setting &quot;t&quot; = 0 in the initial integral equation gives &quot;e&quot;(0) = 0 which implies that &quot;B&quot; = 0 and similarly, setting &quot;t&quot; = 1 in the first differentiation yields &quot;e&#x27; &quot;(1) = 0, whence:

:formula_121

which in turn implies that eigenvalues of &quot;T&quot;&quot;K&quot;&quot;X&quot; are:

:formula_122

The corresponding eigenfunctions are thus of the form:

:formula_123

&quot;A&quot; is then chosen so as to normalize &quot;e&quot;&quot;k&quot;:

:formula_124
This gives the following representation of the Wiener process:

Theorem. There is a sequence {&quot;Z&quot;&quot;i&quot;}&quot;i&quot; of independent Gaussian random variables with mean zero and variance 1 such that
:formula_125
Note that this representation is only valid for formula_126 On larger intervals, the increments are not independent. As stated in the theorem, convergence is in the L2 norm and uniform in &quot;t&quot;.

=== The Brownian bridge ===
Similarly the Brownian bridge formula_127 which is a stochastic process with covariance function
:formula_128
can be represented as the series
:formula_129

== Applications ==

Adaptive optics systems sometimes use K–L functions to reconstruct wave-front phase information (Dai 1996, JOSA A).
Karhunen–Loève expansion is closely related to the Singular Value Decomposition. The latter has myriad applications in image processing, radar, seismology, and the like. If one has independent vector observations from a vector valued stochastic process then the left singular vectors are maximum likelihood estimates of the ensemble KL expansion.

=== Applications in signal estimation and detection===

====Detection of a known continuous signal &quot;S&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)====
In communication, we usually have to decide whether a signal from a noisy channel contains valuable information. The following hypothesis testing is used for detecting continuous signal &quot;s&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) from channel output &quot;X&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), &quot;N&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the channel noise, which is usually assumed zero mean Gaussian process with correlation function formula_130

:formula_131
:formula_132

====Signal detection in white noise====
When the channel noise is white, its correlation function is

:formula_133

and it has constant power spectrum density. In physically practical channel, the noise power is finite, so:

:formula_134

Then the noise correlation function is sinc function with zeros at formula_135 Since are uncorrelated and gaussian, they are independent. Thus we can take samples from &quot;X&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) with time spacing

:formula_136

Let formula_137. We have a total of formula_138 i.i.d observations formula_139 to develop the likelihood-ratio test. Define signal formula_140, the problem becomes,

:formula_141

:formula_142

The log-likelihood ratio

:formula_143

As , let:

:formula_144

Then &quot;G&quot; is the test statistics and the Neyman–Pearson optimum detector is

:formula_145

As &quot;G&quot; is Gaussian, we can characterize it by finding its mean and variances. Then we get

:formula_146
:formula_147

where

:formula_148

is the signal energy.

The false alarm error

:formula_149

And the probability of detection:

:formula_150

where Φ is the cdf of standard normal, or Gaussian, variable.

====Signal detection in colored noise ====
When N(t) is colored (correlated in time) Gaussian noise with zero mean and covariance function formula_151 we cannot sample independent discrete observations by evenly spacing the time. Instead, we can use K–L expansion to decorrelate the noise process and get independent Gaussian observation &#x27;samples&#x27;. The K–L expansion of &quot;N&quot;(&quot;t&quot;):

:formula_152

where formula_153 and the orthonormal bases formula_154 are generated by kernel formula_155, i.e., solution to

:formula_156

Do the expansion:

:formula_157

where formula_158, then

:formula_159

under H and formula_160 under K. Let formula_161, we have

:formula_162 are independent Gaussian r.v&#x27;s with variance formula_163

:under H: formula_164 are independent Gaussian r.v&#x27;s. 
::formula_165

:under K: formula_166 are independent Gaussian r.v&#x27;s. 
::formula_167

Hence, the log-LR is given by

:formula_168

and the optimum detector is

:formula_169

Define

:formula_170

then formula_171

=====How to find &quot;k&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)=====
Since

:formula_172

k(t) is the solution to

:formula_173

If &quot;N&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)is wide-sense stationary,

:formula_174

which is known as the Wiener–Hopf equation. The equation can be solved by taking fourier transform, but not practically realizable since infinite spectrum needs spatial factorization. A special case which is easy to calculate &quot;k&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is white Gaussian noise.

:formula_175

The corresponding impulse response is &quot;h&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = &quot;k&quot;(&quot;T&quot; − &quot;t&quot;) = &quot;CS&quot;(&quot;T&quot; − &quot;t&quot;). Let &quot;C&quot; = 1, this is just the result we arrived at in previous section for detecting of signal in white noise.

=====Test threshold for Neyman–Pearson detector=====
Since X(t) is a Gaussian process,

:formula_176

is a Gaussian random variable that can be characterized by its mean and variance.

:formula_177

Hence, we obtain the distributions of &quot;H&quot; and &quot;K&quot;:

:formula_178
:formula_179

The false alarm error is

:formula_180

So the test threshold for the Neyman–Pearson optimum detector is

:formula_181

Its power of detection is

:formula_182

When the noise is white Gaussian process, the signal power is

:formula_183

=====Prewhitening=====
For some type of colored noise, a typical practise is to add a prewhitening filter before the matched filter to transform the colored noise into white noise. For example, N(t) is a wide-sense stationary colored noise with correlation function

:formula_184
:formula_185

The transfer function of prewhitening filter is

:formula_186

====Detection of a Gaussian random signal in Additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)====
When the signal we want to detect from the noisy channel is also random, for example, a white Gaussian process &quot;X&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), we can still implement K–L expansion to get independent sequence of observation. In this case, the detection problem is described as follows:

:formula_187
:formula_188

&quot;X&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is a random process with correlation function formula_189

The K–L expansion of &quot;X&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is

:formula_190

where

:formula_191

and formula_192 are solutions to

:formula_193

So formula_194&#x27;s are independent sequence of r.v&#x27;s with zero mean and variance formula_163. Expanding &quot;Y&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) and &quot;N&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) by formula_192, we get

:formula_197

where

:formula_198

As &quot;N&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is Gaussian white noise, formula_162&#x27;s are i.i.d sequence of r.v with zero mean and variance formula_200, then the problem is simplified as follows,

:formula_201
:formula_202

The Neyman–Pearson optimal test:

:formula_203

so the log-likelihood ratio is

:formula_204

Since

:formula_205

is just the minimum-mean-square estimate of formula_194 given formula_207&#x27;s,

:formula_208

K–L expansion has the following property: If

:formula_209

where

:formula_210

then

:formula_211

So let

:formula_212

Noncausal filter &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;t&quot;,&quot;s&quot;) can be used to get the estimate through

:formula_213

By orthogonality principle, &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;t&quot;,&quot;s&quot;) satisfies

:formula_214

However, for practical reasons, it&#x27;s necessary to further derive the causal filter &quot;h&quot;(&quot;t&quot;,&quot;s&quot;), where &quot;h&quot;(&quot;t&quot;,&quot;s&quot;) = 0 for &quot;s&quot; &gt; &quot;t&quot;, to get estimate formula_215. Specifically,

:formula_216

<doc id="767256" wikidata="Q1547268" url="?curid=767256" title="House of Nobility (Sweden)">
<text>The House of Nobility () in Stockholm, Sweden, is a corporation and a building that maintains records and acts as an interest group on behalf of the Swedish nobility.

==Name==
The name is literally translated as &quot;House of Knights&quot;, as the knights () belong to the higher ranks of the Swedish nobility, sometimes also together with titles as count () and baron (). All esquires are also represented in the corporation (most of the families are so called &quot;untitled nobility&quot;, ). This is a tradition from the Middle Ages when Sweden during the Kalmar Union only had one knight: Sten Sture.

== History ==
Between the 17th and the 19th century the House of Nobility was a chamber in the Riksdag of the Estates.

In the 18th century, the building was often used for public concerts. From 1731, public concerts were performed here by Kungliga Hovkapellet. Elisabeth Olin is believed to have debuted here in the 1750s, and foreign artists performed such as Elisabetta Almerighi, Giovanni Ansani (1772) and Rosa Scarlatti.

In 1866, the Parliament of the Estates was replaced by the new &quot;Riksdag&quot; (Parliament of Sweden). From then on, the House of Nobility served as a quasi-official representative body for the Swedish nobility, regulated by the Swedish government. Since 2003, it has been a private institution which maintains records and acts as an interest group on behalf of the Swedish nobility, its main purpose being to maintain old traditions and culture.

Since 1990 the House is a member of CILANE.

== Organization ==

The House of Nobility is governed by the House of Nobility Act. Currently it’s the 1866 Act governing the body, but the first such act was introduced as far back as 1626. 

The primary decision making body of the House is the Assembly of Nobles (Swedish: ), which convenes every 3 years to make decisions regarding how the nobility shall operate until the next meeting. The Head of each noble house which has been introduced into the house is entitled to attend and vote at the assembly. They may also send another member of their house to represent them. 

Decisions taken by the assembly are then to be implemented over the next 3 years by the Directorate of the Swedish Nobility Foundation. This body is elected by the assembly and consists of a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman, 6 members and 3 deputy members. There is also a Chancery of the House of Nobility assisting the Directorate in implementing decisions of the assembly.

== Building ==
The &quot;Riddarhuset&quot; is also the name of the building maintained by the corporation in Stockholm old town. The French-born architect Simon de la Vallée started the planning of the building, but was killed by a Swedish nobleman in 1642. The plans were eventually finished by his son, Jean de la Vallée, in 1660.

The south end of the building carries the Latin inscription , &quot;after the clear example of the forefathers&quot;, and holds a statue of Gustav Vasa, the king of Sweden 1523-1560. North of the building is a park in which is a statue of Axel Oxenstierna.

The architecture of the old main library in Turku, Finland, was influenced by the Swedish House of Nobility.

== Digitized archive records ==
The older genealogical collections in the House of Nobility, spanning from the 1600s to the 1800s, have been digitized by the Swedish company Arkiv Digital.

<text>Angus John Macdonald, Baron Macdonald of Tradeston, (born 20 August 1940) is a Scottish television executive, life peer and former Labour member of the House of Lords.

==Early life==
Macdonald was born in Larkhall, Scotland. His father, a Highlander, had poor health and gambled. His mother, who was from a local mining family, worked multiple jobs to support and raise the family.

He won a scholarship to Allan Glen&#x27;s School, Glasgow, but left at 14 to become an apprentice marine engineer at Alexander Stephen and Sons shipyard in Linthouse on the River Clyde and where he was one of the leaders for the apprentices&#x27; strike in 1959 along with fellow members, Billy Connolly and Alex Ferguson. Macdonald was leader of the Govan and Gorbals branch of the Labour Party&#x27;s Young Socialists.

He moved to London in 1962 where he was briefly involved in revolutionary socialist politics as a member of the International Socialists, living at the London home of its foremost member, Tony Cliff. He has said that he returned to his political roots working at the Labour weekly &quot;Tribune&quot; around 1964, where he was appointed as the circulation manager by Michael Foot.

==Television==
He has worked as a journalist on &quot;The Scotsman&quot; and as a member of the Insight team on &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. Originally taken on as a researcher, he was with Granada Television from 1967 to 1986 where he was soon appointed joint editor of &quot;World in Action&quot; with John Birt; Macdonald had an association with the programme for many years. He also presented Granada&#x27;s &quot;What the Papers Say&quot; as well as &quot;Right to Reply&quot; and &quot;Union World&quot; on Channel 4.

Macdonald returned to Scotland in 1986 as Director of Programmes for Scottish Television. After four years he became managing director, replacing William Brown in 1990. While at STV he overhauled the station&#x27;s Current Affairs output and cut the core workforce from 800 to 330 and the market value of the company grew from £50m to around £500m. The company took over two newspapers, &quot;The Herald&quot; and the &quot;Evening Times&quot;, plus the other ITV contractor in Scotland, Grampian Television. He became non-executive chairman of Scottish Media Group plc at the end of 1997, and Chairman of Taylor and Francis plc in 1998. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for services to broadcasting in the 1997 Birthday Honours.

==House of Lords==
A year after the Labour won the United Kingdom general election Macdonald was made life peer on 2 October 1998 as Baron Macdonald of Tradeston, &quot;of Tradeston in the City of Glasgow&quot;. As a member of the House of Lords he was then appointed to be Minister for Business and Industry in the Scottish Office (1998–99), followed by Minister for Transport in the Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions, in attendance at cabinet (1999–2001) and Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (2001–03)

Member of Cabinet Office Advisory Committee on Business Appointments. Also member of House of Lords&#x27; Select Committees on Economic Affairs (2004–2008), and Communications (2009–2012).Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Humanist Group.

He retired from the House of Lords on 27 April 2017.

==Other interests==
In 2004, he was appointed as an adviser to fund managers Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (Europe) Limited in relation to a new European Infrastructure fund which aimed to invest in road and rail projects. He is on Steering Group of the OECD Futures Programme on Infrastructure and advisory board of OECD International Transport Forum. In 2011, he was invited to deliver the MacMillan Memorial Lecture to the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland and chose the subject &quot;Bridging the Infrastructure Gap&quot;.

Macdonald was installed as Chancellor of Glasgow Caledonian University in October 2007, succeeding Magnus Magnusson. He also served as a Governor of the British Film Institute, a member of the council (2006–2008) and of Court (2009–) at the University of Sussex and is Patron of the Dystonia Society.

<text>George Wells Beadle (October 22, 1903 – June 9, 1989) was an American geneticist. In 1958 he shared one-half of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Edward Tatum for their discovery of the role of genes in regulating biochemical events within cells. He also served as the 7th President of the University of Chicago.

Beadle and Tatum&#x27;s key experiments involved exposing the bread mold &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot; to x-rays, causing mutations. In a series of experiments, they showed that these mutations caused changes in specific enzymes involved in metabolic pathways. These experiments led them to propose a direct link between genes and enzymatic reactions, known as the One gene-one enzyme hypothesis.

==Education and early life==
George Wells Beadle was born in Wahoo, Nebraska. He was the son of Chauncey Elmer Beadle and Hattie Albro, who owned and operated a farm nearby. George was educated at the Wahoo High School and might himself have become a farmer if one of his teachers at school had not directed his mind towards science and persuaded him to go to the College of Agriculture in Lincoln, Nebraska. In 1926 he earned his Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Nebraska and subsequently worked for a year with Professor F.D. Keim, who was studying hybrid wheat. In 1927 he earned his Master of Science degree, and Professor Keim secured for him a post as Teaching Assistant at Cornell University, where he worked, until 1931, with Professors R.A. Emerson and L.W. Sharp on Mendelian asynapsis in &quot;Zea mays&quot;. For this work he obtained, in 1931, his Doctor of Philosophy degree.

==Career and research==
In 1931 Fellowship at the California Institute of Technology at Pasadena, where he remained from 1931 until 1936. During this period he continued his work on Indian corn and began, in collaboration with Professors Theodosius Dobzhansky, S. Emerson, and Alfred Sturtevant, work on crossing-over in the fruit fly, &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;.

In 1935 Beadle visited Paris for six months to work with Professor Boris Ephrussi at the Institut de Biologie physico-chimique. Together they began the study of the development of eye pigment in Drosophila which later led to the work on the biochemistry of the genetics of the fungus Neurospora for which Beadle and Edward Lawrie Tatum were together awarded the 1958 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.

In 1936 Beadle left the California Institute of Technology to become Assistant Professor of Genetics at Harvard University. A year later he was appointed Professor of Biology (Genetics) at Stanford University and there he remained for nine years, working for most of this period in collaboration with Tatum. This work of Beadle and Tatum led to an important generalization. This was that most mutants unable to grow on minimal medium, but able to grow on “complete” medium, each require addition of only one particular supplement for growth on minimal medium. If the synthesis of a particular nutrient (such as an amino acid or vitamin) was disrupted by mutation, that mutant strain could be grown by adding the necessary nutrient to the minimal medium. This finding suggested that most mutations affected only a single metabolic pathway. Further evidence obtained soon after the initial findings tended to show that generally only a single step in the pathway is blocked. Following their first report of three such auxotroph mutants in 1941, Beadle and Tatum used this method to create series of related mutants and determined the order in which amino acids and some other metabolites were synthesized in several metabolic pathways. The obvious inference from these experiments was that each gene mutation affects the activity of a single enzyme. This led directly to the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis, which, with certain qualifications and refinements, has remained essentially valid to the present day. As recalled by Horowitz, the work of Beadle and Tatum also demonstrated that genes have an essential role in biosynthesis. At the time of the experiments (1941), non-geneticists still generally believed that genes governed only trivial biological traits, such as eye color, and bristle arrangement in fruit flies, while basic biochemistry was determined in the cytoplasm by unknown processes. Also, many respected geneticists thought that gene action was far too complicated to be resolved by any simple experiment. Thus Beadle and Tatum brought about a fundamental revolution in our understanding of genetics.

In 1946 Beadle returned to the California Institute of Technology as Professor of Biology and Chairman of the Division of Biology. Here he remained until January 1961 when he was elected Chancellor of the University of Chicago and, in the autumn of the same year, President of this university.

After retiring, Beadle undertook a remarkable experiment in maize genetics. In several laboratories he grew a series of Teosinte/Maize crosses. Then he crossed these progeny with each other. He looked for the rate of appearance of parent phenotypes among this second generation. The vast majority of these plants were intermediate between maize and Teosinte in their features, but about 1 in 500 of the plants were identical to either the parent maize or the parent teosinte. Using the mathematics of Mendelian genetics, he calculated that this showed a difference between maize and teosinte of about 5 or 6 genetic loci. This demonstration was so compelling that most scientists now agree that Teosinte is the wild progenitor of maize.

During his career, Beadle has received many honors. These include the Honorary Doctor of Science of the following Universities: Yale (1947), Nebraska (1949), Northwestern University (1952), Rutgers University (1954), Kenyon College (1955), Wesleyan University (1956), the University of Birmingham and the University of Oxford, England (1959), Pomona College (1961), and Lake Forest College (1962). In 1962 he was also given the honorary degree of LL.D. by the University of California, Los Angeles. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1946. He also received the Lasker Award of the American Public Health Association (1950), the Dyer Award (1951), the Emil Christian Hansen Prize of Denmark (1953), the Albert Einstein Commemorative Award in Science (1958), the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1958 with Edward Tatum and Joshua Lederberg, the National Award of the American Cancer Society (1959), and the Kimber Genetics Award of the National Academy of Sciences (1960).

===Awards and honors===
In addition to the Nobel Prize, Beadle received numerous other awards. Beadle was a member of several learned societies, he was a Member of the National Academy of Sciences (and Chairman of Committee on Genetic Effects of Atomic Radiation), the Genetics Society of America (President in 1946), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (President in 1955), the American Cancer Society (Chairman of Scientific Advisory Council), a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) of London, the Danish Royal Academy of Science and the American Philosophical Society.

The George W. Beadle Award of the Genetics Society of America is named in his honor. George Beadle Middle School in Millard, Nebraska (Part of the Millard Public Schools district) was named after him. It opened in 2001. The Beadle Center, which houses the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, is also named after George Beadle.

==Personal life==
Beadle was married twice. By his first wife he had a son, David, who now lives at The Hague, the Netherlands. His second wife, Muriel McClure (1915–1994), a well-known writer, was born in California. Beadle&#x27;s chief hobbies were rockclimbing, skiing, and gardening. He is credited with the first ascent of Mount Doonerak in Alaska. He was a member of FarmHouse fraternity while at the University of Nebraska.

Beadle died on June 9, 1989 at a retirement community in Pomona, California from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, aged 85. He was an atheist.

<text>Pronoia describes a state of mind that is the opposite of paranoia. Whereas a person suffering from paranoia feels that persons or entities are conspiring against them, a person experiencing pronoia believes that the world around them conspires to do them good. The belief can be an irrational belief subject to medical diagnosis, or an enthusiastic, spiritual belief. 

== Definition ==

The word appeared in the psychological literature in 1982, when the academic journal &quot;Social Problems&quot; published an article entitled &quot;Pronoia&quot; by Dr. Fred H. Goldner of Queens College in New York City, in which Goldner described a phenomenon opposite to paranoia and provided numerous examples of specific persons who displayed such characteristics:

Pronoia is the positive counterpart of paranoia. It is the delusion that others think well of one. Actions and the products of one&#x27;s efforts are thought to be well received and praised by others. Mere acquaintances are thought to be close friends; politeness and the exchange of pleasantries are taken as expressions of deep attachment and the promise of future support. Pronoia appears rooted in the social complexity and cultural ambiguity of our lives: we have become increasingly dependent on the opinions of others based on uncertain criteria.

<doc id="767281" wikidata="Q955005" url="?curid=767281" title="Imprimatur">
<text>An imprimatur (sometimes abbreviated as &quot;impr.&quot;, from Latin, &quot;let it be printed&quot;) is a declaration authorizing publication of a book. The term is also applied loosely to any mark of approval or endorsement. The imprimatur rule in the Catholic Church effectively dates from the dawn of printing, and is first seen in the printing and publishing centres of Germany and Venice; many secular states or cities began to require registration or approval of published works around the same time, and in some countries such restrictions still continue, though the collapse of the Soviet bloc has reduced their number.

==Catholic Church==

In the Catholic Church an imprimatur is an official declaration by a Church authority that a book or other printed work may be published; it is usually only applied for and granted to books on religious topics from a Catholic perspective. Approval is given in accordance with canons 822 to 832 of the Code of Canon Law, which do not require the use of the word &quot;imprimatur&quot;.

The grant of imprimatur is normally preceded by a favourable declaration (known as a &quot;nihil obstat&quot;) by a person who has the knowledge, orthodoxy, and prudence necessary for passing a judgement about the absence from the publication of anything that would &quot;harm correct faith or good morals.&quot; In canon law such a person is known as a &quot;censor&quot; or sometimes as a &quot;censor librorum&quot; (Latin for &quot;censor of books&quot;). The episcopal conference may draw up a list of persons who can suitably act as censors or can set up a commission that can be consulted, but each ordinary may make his own choice of person to act as censor.

An imprimatur is not an endorsement by the bishop of the contents of a book, not even of the religious opinions expressed in it, being merely a declaration about what is &quot;not&quot; in the book. In the published work, the imprimatur is sometimes accompanied by a declaration of the following tenor:

The nihil obstat and imprimatur are declarations that a book or pamphlet is free of doctrinal or moral error. No implication is contained therein that those who have granted the nihil obstat or imprimatur agree with the contents, opinions or statements expressed.
The person empowered to issue the imprimatur is the local ordinary of the author or of the place of publication. If he refuses to grant an imprimatur for a work that has received a favourable nihil obstat from the censor, he must inform the author of the reasons for doing so. This gives the author the opportunity to make changes so as to overcome the ordinary&#x27;s difficulty in granting approval.

If further examination shows that a work is not free of doctrinal or moral error, the imprimatur granted for its publication can be withdrawn. This happened three times in the 1980s, when the Holy See judged that complaints made to it about religion textbooks for schools were well founded and ordered the bishop to revoke his approval.

The imprimatur granted for a publication is not valid for later editions of the same work or for translations into another language. For these, new imprimaturs are required.

The permission of the local ordinary is required for the publication of prayer books, catechisms, and other catechetical texts and for school textbooks on Scripture, theology, canon law, church history, or religious or moral subjects. It is recommended, but without obligation, that books on the last-mentioned subjects not intended to be used as school textbooks and all books dealing especially with religious or moral subjects be submitted to the local ordinary for judgement.

A Catholic Imprimatur is often accompanied by a Maltese Cross ✠ before the name of the Bishop.

In 2011, Bishop Kevin C. Rhoades was the first bishop to grant an imprimatur to an iPhone application.

==English law==
English laws of 1586, 1637, and 1662 required an official licence for printing books. The Licensing of the Press Act 1662 (14 Cha. 2. c. 33) required books, according to their subject, to receive the authorization, known as the imprimatur, of the Lord Chancellor, the Earl Marshall, a principal secretary of state, the Archbishop of Canterbury, or the Bishop of London. This law finally expired in 1695.

==Other senses==
In commercial printing the term is used, in line with the meaning of the Latin word, for final approval by a customer or his agent, perhaps after review of a test printing, for carrying out the printing job.

As a metaphor, the word &quot;imprimatur&quot; is used loosely of any form of approval or endorsement, especially by an official body or a person of importance, as in the newspaper headline, &quot;Protection of sources now has courts&#x27; imprimatur&quot;, but also much more vaguely, and probably incorrectly, as in &quot;Children, the final imprimatur to family life, are being borrowed, adopted, created by artificial insemination.&quot;

==Judaism==
Haskama (approval, הַסְכָּמָה) is a rabbinic approval of a religious book concerning Judaism. It is written by a prominent rabbi in his own name, not in the name of a religious organization or hierarchy.

It is often in the form of a letter, possibly on stationery, and generally includes not only &quot;approbation, recommendation, or endorsement&quot; of the work, but also a blessing for the success of the author in this and other accomplishments. As a result, at times a Haskama given to the author is printed, verbatim, in later works from the same author.

An additional value for haskama letters, long ago, was to serve as a form of copyright, to protect the author or the printer from any unauthorized reproduction.

<doc id="767287" wikidata="Q205303" url="?curid=767287" title="Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa">
<text>Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa (1532–1592) was a Spanish adventurer, author, historian, mathematician, and astronomer. His birthplace is not certain and may have been Pontevedra, in Galicia, where his paternal family originated, or Alcalá de Henares in Castile, where he later is known to have studied . His father Bartolomé Sarmiento was born in Pontevedra and his mother María Gamboa was born in Bilbao, Basque Country.

==Biography==

===Early life===
At the age of 18, Sarmiento de Gamboa entered the royal military in the European wars. Between 1550 and 1555 the future navigator fought in the armies of Emperor Charles V. In 1555 he began his exploring career, sailing across the Atlantic Ocean. His first destination was New Spain (in what is today Mexico), where he lived for two years. Little is known of this period in his life, other than that he encountered difficulties with the Inquisition. He then sailed to Peru, where he lived for more than twenty years, gaining a reputation as a navigator.

In Lima he was accused by the Inquisition of possessing two magic rings and some magic ink and of following the precepts of Moses. He then joined Álvaro de Mendaña&#x27;s expedition through the southern Pacific Ocean to find the &quot;Terra Australis Incognita&quot;, which, had Mendaña followed Sarmiento&#x27;s indications, should have reached New Zealand or/and Australia; but they discovered the Solomon Islands instead, in 1568. The expedition failed to find gold and attempts at establishing a settlement in the Solomon Islands ended in failure.

In order to take credit of the discoveries for himself Mendaña threw the journals and maps made by Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa overboard and abandoned him in Mexico. However, a trial was then held in Lima, with the result giving Sarmiento credit for the discoveries.

In 1572 he was commissioned by Francisco de Toledo, the fifth Viceroy of Peru, to write a history of the Incas. Toledo hoped such a history would justify Spanish colonisation by revealing the violent history of the Incas. Sarmiento collected oral accounts first hand from Inca informants and produced a history (commonly titled &quot;The History of the Incas&quot;) that chronicles their violent conquest of the region.

===&quot;The History of the Incas&quot;===
Written in Cuzco, the capital of the Inca Empire, just forty years after the arrival of the first Spaniards in the city, Sarmiento&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Incas&quot; contains extremely detailed descriptions of Inca history and mythology. The royal sponsorship of the work guaranteed Sarmiento direct access to the highest Spanish officials in Cuzco. It also allowed him to summon influential natives, as well as those who had witnessed the fall of the Inca Empire, so that they could relate their stories. Sarmiento travelled widely and interviewed numerous local leaders and lords, members of the royal Incan families, and the few remaining Spanish conquistadors who still resided in Cuzco. Once the first draft of the history was completed, in an unprecedented effort to establish the unquestionable authenticity of the work, his manuscript was read, chapter by chapter, to forty-two indigenous authorities for their commentary and correction. After the public reading, which occurred on 29 February and 1 March 1572, the manuscript was entrusted to a member of the viceroy&#x27;s personal guard. He was to take the manuscript to Spain and deliver it to King Philip II, along with four painted cloths showing the history of the Incas and a number of other artefacts and objects that Toledo had collected. However, due to a series of unusual events, this document of Inca history was relegated to obscurity for centuries.

===Strait of Magellan===

He became the commander of the naval station in the Pacific in 1578, when Sir Francis Drake attacked the coasts of Peru and Mexico. Sarmiento de Gamboa sailed out of the port of Callao with eleven vessels in 1579 to capture Drake. He did not find Drake, who had gone westward through the Pacific Ocean, but he explored the southern Pacific Coast of South America, passed the Magellan Strait from west to east for the second time, drawing precious maps of many points of the Strait, and, after an impressive sailing of the Atlantic Ocean from southwest to northeast, he reached Spain in late 1580.

On his reporting the results of his expedition to King Philip II of Spain, the latter resolved to fortify the Strait, and in 1581 sent an expedition of twenty-four vessels with 2,500 men from Cadiz, under the command of Sarmiento de Gamboa and Diego Flores Valdez. The expedition lost eight vessels in a storm, and Flores, on account of rivalry with Sarmiento de Gamboa, abandoned him with twelve vessels in the entry of the Strait and returned to Spain. With only four vessels, Sarmiento de Gamboa continued the voyage, arriving in January 1583 at a favorable point, where he established a fort and colony garrisoned by 300 men which he called &quot;Rey Don Felipe&quot;. The settlement failed shortly after he left, and when Thomas Cavendish visited the ruins in 1587 he renamed the place Port Famine.

In 1584 Sarmiento de Gamboa sailed for Europe, but he was captured by an English fleet under to Sir Walter Raleigh and carried to England where he was presented to Queen Elizabeth I of England. They had a conversation in Latin, which was their only common language, and despite Spain&#x27;s official policy of keeping all navigational information secret, he shared his maps with British cartographers. Queen Elizabeth gave him a &quot;Letter of Peace&quot; to be carried to King Philip II of Spain. However, on his way back to Spain he was captured by French Huguenots and was kept prisoner until 1588. During that time Spain mounted the Spanish Armada and attacked the English fleet. If Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s &quot;Letter of Peace&quot; had been delivered in time to Spain, there might not have been a war. Meanwhile, his colony dissolved and gradually perished of starvation; one of the survivors was rescued by Cavendish&#x27;s fleet in 1587, and another by Meriche in 1589. After his liberation, Sarmiento de Gamboa made a representation of his experience and a complaint against Flores to King Philip II; it seems that his complaint was neglected.

===Later life===
Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa spent the rest of his life dedicating himself to his writings and worked as an editor of poetry. On his last naval mission in the service of the king he was made Admiral of an armada of galleons en route to the Indies. He died while on the mission, near the coast of Lisbon.

==Legacy==
Due to his experiences Sarmiento became a byword for bad luck; Riesenberg tells us &#x27;people would say, glibly, &quot;So and so has the luck of Pedro de Sarmiento&quot;&#x27;.

Sarmiento de Gamboa is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of South American lizard, &quot;Liolaemus sarmientoi&quot;.

A Spanish research vessel, &quot;BO Sarmiento de Gamboa&quot;, also carries his name.

<text>Burton Lane ( Levy; February 2, 1912 – January 5, 1997) was an American composer and lyricist primarily known for his theatre and film scores. His most popular and successful works include &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; in 1947 and &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever&quot; in 1965.

==Biography==
He was born Burton Levy, in New York City; his father was Lazarus Levy. At some later time he became known as Burton Lane. One source erroneously gives his birth name as &quot;Morris Hyman Kushner&quot;.

Burton Lane studied classical piano as a child. At age 14 the theatrical producers the Shuberts commissioned him to write songs for a revue, &quot;Greenwich Village Follies&quot;. At the age of 18, he contributed the music for at least two songs for the revue, &quot;Three&#x27;s A Crowd&quot;: &quot;Forget All Your Books&quot; and &quot;Out in the Open Air.&quot;

He was known for his Broadway musicals, &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; (1947) and &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever&quot; (1965). He also wrote the music for the less remembered Broadway shows, &quot;Hold On to Your Hats&quot; (1940), &quot;Laffing Room Only&quot; (1944), and &quot;Carmelina&quot; (1979), the latter with lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner, who had also written lyrics to Lane&#x27;s music for &quot;On a Clear Day&quot; and the film &quot;Royal Wedding&quot; (1951). Lane mainly wrote music for films, such as &quot;Dancing Lady&quot; (1933), and &quot;Babes on Broadway&quot; (1941), writing for more than 30 movies.

He was president of the American Guild of Authors and Composers from 1957 and for the next 10 terms, during which period he campaigned against music piracy. He also served three terms on the board of directors of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP).

Lane&#x27;s best-known songs include &quot;Old Devil Moon,&quot; &quot;How Are Things in Glocca Morra?,&quot; &quot;Too Late Now,&quot; &quot;How About You?,&quot; and the title song from &quot;On a Clear Day.&quot; He shared a Grammy Award in 1965 for Best Broadway Cast Album of the year (&quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever&quot;).

&quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; has had four major revivals (1955, 1960, 1967, and 2009), and was also made into a film starring Fred Astaire and Petula Clark, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, in 1968. In 2004 and 2016 the Irish Repertory Theatre staged an Off-Broadway production. New York&#x27;s City Center Encores! series performed a critically acclaimed concert version of the musical in March 2009. Directed and choreographed by Warren Carlyle, it starred Jim Norton and Kate Baldwin as Finian and Sharon, with Cheyenne Jackson as Woody and Jeremy Bobb as Og, the leprechaun. The most recent Broadway revival opened on October 29, 2009, at the St. James Theatre with most of the Encores! cast. Newly added to the Broadway cast are Christopher Fitzgerald as Og and Chuck Cooper as Billboard; Jim Norton, Kate Baldwin and Cheyenne Jackson all reprise their roles.

==Discovery of Judy Garland==
Lane is credited with discovering the 13-year-old Frances Gumm (Judy Garland). He caught her sisters&#x27; act at the Paramount theater in Hollywood which featured a movie and a live stage show. The sisters, Virginia and Mary Jane, brought on their younger sister, Frances, who sang &quot;Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart.&quot; Lane immediately called Jack Robbins, head of the music department at MGM, and told him he&#x27;d just heard a great new talent.

Robbins told him to bring her in next day for an audition which Lane did. Robbins was knocked out by the little girl&#x27;s voice (Lane played the audition piano for her), rushed upstairs and dragged Louis B. Mayer down to listen to her belt out some songs. Mayer was so impressed he ordered every writer, director and producer on the lot to hear her with the result that the audition, which began at 9 am, finished at 7:30 pm. Frances (Judy) was signed, and that was the start of her career. Because of circumstance, and contractual arrangements, Burton Lane didn&#x27;t work with her again for seven years (&quot;Babes on Broadway&quot;), but it was definitely he who discovered her.

<text>WACY-TV (channel 32) is an independent television station licensed to Appleton, Wisconsin, United States, serving the Green Bay area. It is owned by the E.W. Scripps Company alongside NBC affiliate WGBA-TV (channel 26). The two stations share studios on North Road near Airport Drive/WIS 172 in the Green Bay suburb of Ashwaubenon; WACY-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located in the Shirley section of Glenmore, Wisconsin.

==History==

===Early history and troubles===
The station first signed on the air on March 7, 1984, as WXGZ-TV, and was the first television station licensed to and based out of Appleton; it was originally owned by Appleton Midwestern Television. The station&#x27;s original studio was located on North Marshall Road, southwest of the Interstate 41/WI 441 interchange on Appleton&#x27;s north side. &quot;The Post-Crescent&quot; reported on January 31 that the station began operations by testing its signal, although it formally began programming on March 7. WXGZ originally operated as an independent station during its first three years, showing off-network sitcoms and other syndicated programming. On October 6, 1986, under the &quot;Super 32&quot; moniker, WXGZ became a charter affiliate of the Fox network. However, like most early Fox affiliates, the station continued to essentially program itself as an independent station. The network&#x27;s only program at the time was the late night talk program &quot;The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers&quot;; prime time programming followed in 1987. After joining Fox, WXGZ became the first station in the Green Bay–Appleton television market to begin broadcasting in stereo.

A noted local personality on WXGZ was &quot;Oscor the Clown&quot; (played by Wayne Lowney), who served as the mascot of the WXGZ children&#x27;s lineup and hosted a Sunday morning program starting in 1986 called &quot;Oscor&#x27;s Place&quot;, a show whose major sponsor was Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s predecessor brand, ShowBiz Pizza Place. Outside of Fox programming, WXGZ was noteworthy for airing the successful first-run syndicated programs &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;.

By November 1991, Appleton Midwestern Television ran into financial problems and declared bankruptcy. After an unsuccessful search for a new buyer for the station or more financing, WXGZ was forced to sign-off permanently on the night of February 14, 1992, ending its eight-year history with a half-hour retrospective featuring on-air and behind-the-scenes footage at the station. WXGZ staff announcer Ed Myers and general manager Roy Smith said the last of the station&#x27;s goodbyes, after which WXGZ closed operations. The next morning, fellow independent station WGBA-TV (channel 26) became the market&#x27;s new Fox affiliate, and acquired some of WXGZ&#x27;s syndicated programming inventory (including &quot;Arsenio&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;).

After WXGZ&#x27;s shut down, the station&#x27;s license was left in the hands of a holding company from March to August 1992, at which point it was bought by Ace TV Incorporated, a corporation solely owned by Shirley A. Martin. Channel 32 remained off-the-air for two years with occasional word that the station intended to begin broadcasting again &quot;in the near future&quot;.

===Revival as WACY-TV===
WXGZ&#x27;s license to operate was put back into use in June 1994. License holder Ace TV put WXGZ back on the air with the help of WGBA and its then-owner Aries Telecommunications, who arranged to put WXGZ on solid financial footing through the entrance of a local marketing agreement with Ace TV, allowing WGBA to operate and program WXGZ through its studios and sell advertising time for the station.

At the outset, programming on WXGZ (whose logo was an ace of spades as a nod to its owner) consisted of second-run airings of off-network reruns (including such series as &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; and &quot;Newhart&quot;), along with select airings of Milwaukee Brewers baseball and Milwaukee Bucks basketball games (which WGBA previously aired but no longer had room to run due to its own commitments with Fox). By the fall of 1994, first-run syndicated programming would be included on WXGZ&#x27;s schedule, including &quot;Family Feud&quot; and programming from the Prime Time Entertainment Network syndication service. On January 16, 1995, WXGZ became a charter affiliate of the United Paramount Network (UPN). The station also maintained a secondary affiliation with The WB for the network&#x27;s first four years before WIWB (channel 14, now WCWF) became the Green Bay market&#x27;s WB affiliate in June 1999.

By August 1995, the station – which would change its call sign that month to WACY-TV – benefited from WGBA&#x27;s affiliation switch to NBC (due to WLUK-TV, channel 11, joining Fox). With WGBA now committed to NBC and its programming lineup, programs that WGBA no longer had room to broadcast were moved over to WACY, including some syndicated programming (most notably reruns of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;) and daytime children&#x27;s programming. With this move, WACY adopted the &quot;WACkY 32&quot; branding for its kids&#x27; lineup (running roughly 6–11 a.m. and 1–5 p.m.), which over the years would include &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot;, &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, &quot;Pokémon&quot;, &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; and &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;; programs from the UPN Kids, BKN and The Disney Afternoon blocks (as well as from Kids&#x27; WB as the Green Bay television market did not have a full-time WB affiliate); and educational and informational-compliant programs like &quot;The New Zoo Revue&quot;. The live character &quot;Cuddles the Clown&quot; provided host continuity for &quot;WACkY 32&quot; programming. The station&#x27;s children&#x27;s lineup would dwindle over the years, thanks in part to increased cable competition from cable channels such as Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon and the decreased financial justification of airing a more-than-necessary amount of children&#x27;s programming, although it would continue to air UPN&#x27;s &quot;Disney&#x27;s One Too&quot; until the network discontinued its daily children&#x27;s block in 2003. After that, WACY would rely on general syndicated entertainment and infomercials for its daytime lineup.

One of WACY&#x27;s most durable programs was called &quot;Who, What, When, Where&quot;, a show hosted by Oshkosh public-access television personalities Jim C. Hoffman and Dan Davies. &quot;Who, What, When, Where&quot; featured various interviews, advertisements (notably Ron and Lloyd&#x27;s supermarket and WNAM radio), and entertainment sketches performed by Davies. The show would be rechristened &quot;N.E.W. Now&quot; (for &quot;North East Wisconsin&quot;) in early 1997, its last year on the air. Later local shows on WACY included the legal affairs show &quot;It&#x27;s the Law&quot;, produced by Hoffman and hosted by Oshkosh attorney George W. Curtis, and the Sunday morning polka music show &quot;Polka, Polka, Polka&quot;, which originated from a Manitowoc supper club/dance hall (&quot;Polka, Polka, Polka&quot; now airs on WCWF).

In 2004, Milwaukee-based Journal Communications (owner of that city&#x27;s WTMJ-TV), purchased WGBA from Aries Telecommunications for $43.25 million. As part of the deal, Journal would take over the local marketing agreement with WACY, as well as acquire the option to purchase channel 32 from Ace TV if the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ever relaxed or waived its media ownership rules to allow the purchase.

===MyNetworkTV affiliation (2006–2022)===
On February 22, 2006, News Corporation announced the launch of a new &quot;sixth&quot; network called MyNetworkTV, which would be operated by Fox Television Stations and its syndication division Twentieth Television. MyNetworkTV was created to compete against another upstart network that would launch at the same time that September, The CW (an amalgamated network that was originally consisted primarily of UPN and The WB&#x27;s higher-rated programs) as well as to give UPN and WB stations that were not mentioned as becoming CW affiliates another option besides converting to independent stations. WACY reached a turning point with the pending loss of UPN programming, as a result of the shutdown of the network and The CW&#x27;s launch. The CW chose WIWB as its Green Bay affiliate, as that station&#x27;s then-owner ACME Communications had a deep relationship with WB management (ACME&#x27;s founder Jamie Kellner was a former president of The WB). On March 22, 2006, WACY announced that it would affiliate with MyNetworkTV, bringing channel 32&#x27;s affiliation with a Fox-owned network full-circle.

After the 2005–06 television season ended, WACY began distancing itself from UPN, reducing its carriage of the network&#x27;s programming on Monday through Thursdays to only one hour per night during the summer of 2006, with infomercials filling the dropped second hour. WACY severed ties with UPN completely on September 4 (the night prior to MyNetworkTV&#x27;s debut), leaving WIWB to air the balance of UPN programming as a transitional secondary affiliation alongside its WB shows (including weekend airings of &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; and &quot;WWE Friday Night SmackDown&quot;).

After affiliating with MyNetworkTV, WACY adopted a new branding in late-July 2006, becoming &quot;My New 32&quot;—with &quot;New&quot; referring to both the &quot;new&quot; network, and as an abbreviation of &quot;Northeast Wisconsin&quot;—and in the process downplaying the WACY call sign (aside from official station identification) and abandoning the ace of spades logo that the station used in some form since its return to the air in 1994.

As far back as the latter years of WACY&#x27;s UPN affiliation, the station aired a weekly high school football game featuring local schools on Friday nights in the fall (billed as &quot;Friday Night Thunder&quot;), with select University of Wisconsin–Green Bay men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball games added in 2007. All sports broadcasts on WACY featured WGBA&#x27;s sports anchors, while visual presentation depended on the in-house camera system from the arena where the game was played instead of station-owned cameras. The broadcasts of high school games were discontinued in 2008, in part due to the addition of &quot;SmackDown&quot; to MyNetworkTV&#x27;s Friday night lineup and also due to a lean financial period for the stations during the Great Recession, at a time when WGBA&#x27;s news and sports staff were cut back due to budget concerns, WTMJ began to take control of several of WGBA&#x27;s newscasts, and infomercials occupied portions of WACY&#x27;s programming schedule. Sports broadcasts would return to WACY in August 2011 under the &quot;N.E.W. Sports Showdown&quot; banner, featuring both high school sports as well as St. Norbert College athletics (added in 2011) and Wisconsin Timber Rattlers baseball (added in the spring of 2013 until 2017, returned/revived in 2024).

A late-night feature that aired on WACY&#x27;s weekend lineup was the movie program &quot;Ned the Dead&quot;. Hosted by the ghoulish &quot;Ned&quot; (played by local actor and radio personality Steve Brenzel), the show – which began on WLUK-TV in the 1980s as &quot;Ned the Dead&#x27;s Chiller Theater&quot; before eventually moving to WACY – featured presentations of B-movies (mainly sci-fi or horror features from the 1950s), with &quot;Ned&quot; providing wraparound segments of comic relief. Over the years, &quot;Ned&quot; would move toward airings of low-budget color films and additional segments of Ned and his colorful troupe of sidekicks. Though &quot;Ned the Dead&quot; would move around WACY&#x27;s schedule during its time on the station, the show aired mainly at 11 p.m. on Saturdays and was sponsored by the Van Vredee&#x27;s chain of local furniture/appliance stores (Brenzel serves as the stores&#x27; spokesperson). &quot;Ned the Dead&quot; ended its WACY run on December 12, 2010.

====2012 full purchase of station by Journal====
In May 2012, Journal Communications commenced on a plan to purchase WACY from Ace TV, Inc. for $4.65 million. Although Journal obtained the option to purchase WACY when it bought WGBA in the mid-2000s, it could not proceed with a purchase of WACY due to FCC duopoly limits placed on markets such as Green Bay–Appleton, which has fewer than eight independently owned full-power television stations. In paperwork filed with the FCC on May 3, 2012, Journal included a &quot;failing station waiver&quot; that would allow it to purchase WACY and keep it on the air, an avenue that LIN TV Corporation used in purchasing Green Bay&#x27;s WCWF in 2011 and creating a duopoly with WLUK-TV. As the petitioner, Journal needed to prove in its waiver request that WACY was in an economically non-viable position (reasoning that LIN also cited in its purchase of WCWF).

The FCC would approve Journal&#x27;s request of WACY&#x27;s license transfer on September 4, 2012, specifically citing two points Journal had included in its request: The financial and operational status of WACY before the grandfathered LMA commenced in 1994 (and which Journal inherited when it bought WGBA in 2004), and WGBA&#x27;s ability to &quot;produce and broadcast [on WACY] programming that furthers the public interest,&quot; programming that WACY would otherwise not have been able to produce. Also cited was channel 32&#x27;s bankruptcy as WXGZ. On October 23, the deal was consummated. It was the third station that Journal acquired through a failed station waiver, after KNIN-TV in Boise and KWBA in Tucson.

=== Summer 2013 Time Warner Cable carriage dispute ===
After several extensions of the original June 30, 2013, expired agreement, and the invocation of the sweeps rule disallowing cable providers from pulling the main signal of a carried station during local sweeps periods (which includes July), the main signals of WGBA and WACY were pulled off Time Warner Cable systems in the market at midnight on July 25, 2013. The MeTV subchannel had been pulled earlier on July 10 as those were not under the same protection under the sweeps rule. WTMJ was also affected in the Milwaukee market, along with Journal stations in Omaha and Palm Springs, California. The main effect of the blackout on Time Warner Cable systems was the carriage of three Packers preseason games on WTMJ and WGBA, which were blacked out on the provider due to the dispute, though the games were still available via the Spanish language simulcast using the Packers Television network camera positions produced for Milwaukee&#x27;s Telemundo affiliate WYTU-LD (channel 63/49.4), which is carried on the subchannel tier in the Green Bay market (and was simulcast on WACY), with the suggestion to listen to English play-by-play via either WTMJ radio from Milwaukee or the local FM stations in Green Bay or Appleton carrying Packers Radio Network coverage. The later replays of the games were also available via replays on NFL Network through the week.

A class action lawsuit was also filed by viewers against Time Warner Cable on August 8 under grounds of breach of contract. Journal Broadcast Group has also made claims via its website detailing their version of the carriage dispute that TWC was distracted due to the other dispute involving CBS Corporation&#x27;s Television Stations group and Showtime Networks premium channel suites.

By August 15, WGBA and WACY&#x27;s channel slots on Time Warner Cable were replaced with a simulcast of GSN, with Starz Kids &amp; Family airing on the channel 994 subchannel slot usually carrying MeTV. Journal Broadcast Group also asked state authorities to intervene in their dispute with Time Warner Cable.

Journal and Time Warner Cable came to an agreement for carriage on September 20, 2013, to last at least through the 2016 Summer Olympics, returning WGBA and WACY to their lineups as of 7 p.m. that evening. However, Journal conceded that the analog and cable-ready positions were less important than carriage in the high definition tier, so while WGBA&#x27;s high definition signal remained on channel 1007, the standard definition signal moved to channel 13, WACY&#x27;s former SD slot, with WACY shifting to channel 83 with high definition coverage coming at the start of the year. However, MeTV subchannel 26.2 remained removed from Time Warner systems, though southern portions of the Green Bay market already receive MeTV Milwaukee flagship WBME-CD (channel 41) on the basic lifeline tier.

===Sale to the E. W. Scripps Company===
On July 30, 2014, the E. W. Scripps Company announced that it would acquire Journal Communications in an all-stock transaction. The combined firm would retain their broadcast properties, including WTMJ-TV and its radio siblings, with the print assets being spun off as Journal Media Group. The deal was approved by the FCC on December 12, 2014, with shareholders of the two companies approving it on March 11, 2015; the merger/spin-off between Journal and Scripps formally closed on April 1.

E. W. Scripps and Time Warner Cable announced a new multi-year carriage agreement on February 1, 2016, that includes WGBA and WACY, along with WACY&#x27;s new subchannels also coming to Time Warner in addition to those of WGBA.

In October 2021, WACY-TV began to discontinue the &quot;MyNew32&quot; branding (and its secondary &quot;My32&quot; branding used since 2016) in favor of the on-air &quot;TV 32&quot; branding, downplaying their affiliation with MyNetworkTV.

===Return to independence (2022–present)===
On June 3, 2022, WACY ended their affiliation with MyNetworkTV with no public notice, and returned to being an unaffiliated independent station for the first time since January 1995. The station replaced MyNetworkTV programming with &quot;Dateline&quot; and &quot;Chicago P.D.&quot; (both of which are also carried with MyNetworkTV). The schedule of the service quietly returned to the market in February 2023, when WBAY-TV picked it up as a late night offering on their third subchannel carrying Circle (currently The365); the move of MyNetworkTV to a late night slot on a subchannel has become an increasingly common fate for the service.

==Local programming==
Locally-produced programming includes the cooking show &quot;Mad Dog &amp; Merril&#x27;s Midwest Grillin&quot; (Mad Dog and Merril are longtime Northeast Wisconsin-based cooking experts). The station also airs local high school and college sports, under the umbrella title of &quot;N.E.W. Sports Showdown&quot;. The same title is also used for a broad schedule of professional minor league sports carried by the station, including the United States Hockey League&#x27;s Green Bay Gamblers. Beginning with the 2017–18 season, the station also broadcasts NBA G League games involving the Oshkosh-based Wisconsin Herd, which is owned by the Milwaukee Bucks and affiliates with that team.

Until 2016 when WCWF acquired local rights to the Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association state basketball and hockey championships, it carried those tournaments for the Green Bay market. Unique for an English-language station, it also simulcasts Spanish-language coverage of preseason Green Bay Packers football produced by Milwaukee Telemundo affiliate WYTU-LD for the convenience of over-the-air viewers; both WACY and WYTU-LD have availability on local cable systems. When WGBA has NBC network commitments to the Summer Olympics, English-language coverage airs, along with the team&#x27;s Family Night scrimmage.

On June 15, 2020, WACY debuted a half-hour weeknight 9 p.m. newscast produced by WGBA, titled &quot;My News at 9&quot; with a repeat of &quot;NBC 26 Tonight&quot; (originally aired at 6:30 p.m. on WGBA) at 9:30 p.m. before its later cancellation; it now airs as of July 2024 as &quot;NBC 26 News at 9 on TV 32&quot;.

Since 2024, WACY has an agreement with the University of Wisconsin–Green Bay to air and produce select home men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball games, which are aired beyond Green Bay and the visiting school&#x27;s broadcast partner on ESPN+ under their general rights agreement with the Horizon League.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WACY-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 32, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 27, using virtual channel 32.

One week after the transition, Journal chose to suffix all of their owned television stations with the &quot;-TV&quot; suffix as part of the FCC&#x27;s one-time allowance during the transition to allow stations to suffix either &quot;-TV&quot; or &quot;-DT&quot; to their call signs if not previously included on their permanent digital channel; this included WACY despite its separate ownership by ACE TV at the time, which became WACY-TV in FCC correspondence and on-air station identifications on June 17, 2009.

<text>Alexander Wiley (May 26, 1884 – October 26, 1967) was an American politician who served four terms in the United States Senate for the state of Wisconsin from 1939 to 1963. When he left the Senate, he was its most senior Republican member.

==Biography==

Wiley was born in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. He received his undergraduate education at Augsburg College in Minnesota and the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He received his law degree from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1907 and was also admitted to the bar the same year. He served as the Chippewa County district attorney from 1909 to 1915.

Wiley was the Republican candidate for governor of Wisconsin in 1936, but his bid failed. Philip La Follette and the new Wisconsin Progressive Party, which split from the Republicans in 1934, won the election. In 1938, Wiley was elected to the U.S. Senate, first defeating Tax Court judge Stephen J. McMahon to win the Republican nomination, and then defeating Democratic incumbent F. Ryan Duffy to win the seat. In 1944, Wiley was challenged by United States Marine Corps Captain Joseph R. McCarthy in the Republican primary. He defeated McCarthy and won the general election. Wiley, then an isolationist in foreign policy, and Governor Walter S. Goodland supported Republican presidential nominee Thomas E. Dewey in the 1944 race over incumbent Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Dewey won Wisconsin&#x27;s electoral votes but fell short nationally.

Wiley was re-elected two more times, in 1950 and 1956. He was challenged by U.S. Representative Glenn Robert Davis in the 1956 Republican primary, but again prevailed. Wiley voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In 1962, Wiley lost his bid for a fifth term to Governor Gaylord Nelson, a liberal Democrat. Wiley was the last Republican to serve as a U.S. Senator from Wisconsin until former 9th district congressman Bob Kasten took office in 1981.

Wiley had a distinguished Senate career that included the chairmanship of both the Foreign Relations and Judiciary committees.

Wiley died in Germantown, Pennsylvania at age 83. He was interred at Forest Hill Cemetery in Chippewa Falls. During his lifetime he was a member of the Freemasons, the Knights Templar, the Elks Club, the Kiwanis, the Knights of Pythias, the Moose International, the Sons of Norway, and Sigma Phi Epsilon.

<doc id="767292" wikidata="Q200670" url="?curid=767292" title="Backflow prevention device">
<text>A backflow prevention device is used to protect potable water supplies from contamination or pollution due to backflow.

In water distribution systems, water is normally maintained at a significant pressure to enable water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may fail or be reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.

==Terminology==
Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.

Back-siphonage occurs when higher pressure fluids, gases, or suspended solids move to an area of lower pressure fluids. For example, when a drinking straw is used to consume a beverage, suction reduces the pressure of fluid inside the straw, causing liquid to move from the cup to inside the straw and then into the drinker&#x27;s mouth. A significant drop of pressure in a water delivery system creates a similar suction, &quot;pulling&quot; possibly undesirable material into the system. This is an example of an indirect cross-connection.

Back-pressure occurs for example when air is blown through the straw and bubbles begin to erupt at the submerged end. If, instead of air, natural gas had been forced into a potable water tank, the gas in turn could be carried to a kitchen faucet. This is an example of a direct cross-connection, with undesirable material being &quot;pushed&quot; into the system.

Back pressure can force an undesirable contaminant to enter potable water piping. Sources of back pressure may be boilers, heat exchanging equipment, power washing equipment, fire sprinklers, or pumps in the water distribution system. In some cases there may be an almost continuous risk of overcoming the static water pressure in the piping. To reduce the risk of contamination, a backflow preventer can be fitted. A backflow preventer is also important when potentially toxic chemicals are used, for instance for commercial/industrial descaling of boilers, or when chemical bleaches are used for residential power washing.

A closely related device is the backwater valve, which is designed to prevent sewage from backing up into a building and causing basement flooding.

==Preventive devices==

The simplest, most reliable way to provide backflow prevention is to provide an air gap. An air gap is simply an open vertical space between any device that connects to a plumbing system (like a valve or faucet) and any place where contaminated water can collect or pool. A simple air gap has no moving parts, other than flowing water. Many plumbing codes specify a minimum air gap distance required for various circumstances, such as a drain connection for a dishwasher, e.g., BS 6282.

Alternatively, a specialized backflow preventer valve may be installed at strategic locations in the plumbing system wherever there is a risk of contaminated fluids entering the water supply pipes. These valves are used where there is not sufficient vertical clearance or physical space to install an air gap, or when pressurized operation or other factors rule out use of an air gap. Because these valves use moving parts, they are often required to be inspected or tested periodically.

==Regulatory requirements==
To prevent contamination due to back pressure, many health regulatory regimes require an air gap or mechanical backflow prevention assembly between the delivery point of mains water and local storage or use. Where submerged mains inflow is permitted, a backflow prevention assembly is required, which protects the potable water system from contamination hazards. A check valve is a basic form of backflow prevention, but often more complex devices are required because check valves are not considered to be reliable, when compared to more sophisticated devices with redundancies and reduced-pressure zones.

In many countries. approved backflow prevention assemblies are required by law, and must be installed in accordance with plumbing or building codes. A typical backflow assembly has test cocks and shut-off valves, and must be tested when installed, if relocated or repaired, and also on a periodic basis.

In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) holds local water suppliers responsible for maintaining a certain amount of purity in potable water systems. Many states and/or local municipalities require annual testing of backflow prevention assemblies. In most cases, the law requires a double check (DC), reduced pressure principle device (RP) device, or an air gap when backflow prevention is mandated.

<text>Roger Norman Freeman, Baron Freeman, PC (born 27 May 1942), is a British politician. A member of the Conservative Party, he served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in the Cabinet of Prime Minister John Major from 1995 to 1997. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) representing the constituency of Kettering from 1983 to 1997, and was made a life peer in 1997.

== Early life and career ==
Freeman was born in the Wirral, and privately educated at Whitgift School, Croydon

He then studied at Balliol College, Oxford. When he was at Oxford, he was the President of the Oxford University Conservative Association in Hilary Term 1964. Before entering Parliament, he was a Chartered Accountant working for an investment bank.

==Political career==
After an unsuccessful attempt to be elected as MP for Don Valley in 1979, Freeman was finally elected as MP for Kettering in 1983. Before joining the Cabinet, he served as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the Armed Forces (1986–88), Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Health (1988–90), and Minister for Public Transport (1990–1995) ranking as Minister of State. In that post he was responsible for steering through the House of Commons the Railways Bill, providing for the privatisation of British Rail and enacted as the Railways Act 1993. At the time he achieved a degree of notoriety with his comment on a &quot;cheap and cheerful&quot; rail service being provided for typists.

In the 1993 Birthday Honours, Freeman was sworn of the Privy Council.

In 1995, he was brought into the Cabinet by John Major as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. In this role, he made a ministerial visit to Lancaster Royal Grammar School in 1995.

He also inaugurated the process of privatisation of HM Stationery Office (HMSO), though as a former minister for MOD Procurement, one of HMSO&#x27;s major customers, he could be adjudged to have had a conflict of interest. He therefore misjudged the effect of privatisation on HMSO, which, rather than preserve the business as a whole, and protecting jobs, hastened the already-established process of splitting the business into its various parts, resulting in the destruction of some, and the sale of others to foreign owners. The loss of jobs has been massive. The National Audit Office later denounced the whole process as a debacle. It could be argued that he, along with his colleague Lord North in the other place, may have misled the house.

He did his best to make the dying days of the Major government more colourful by appearing on Channel 4&#x27;s &#x27;bottom up&#x27; television programme &quot;The People&#x27;s Parliament&quot;. Appearing by video link, he was quizzed by the female Scots host on the alleged unapproachability of politicians &quot;in grey suits&quot;. Freeman quipped: &quot;Well, I can&#x27;t just start turning up to work in a jumper!&quot;. Freeman&#x27;s remark though was better-judged than any viewer might have realised at the time. The Major government&#x27;s strategy weekend where Cabinet members arrived wearing jumpers was much lampooned.

Narrowly defeated in the 1997 general election, he was shortly afterwards raised to the peerage as Baron Freeman, &quot;of Dingley in the County of Northamptonshire&quot; in the 1997 Prime Minister&#x27;s Resignation Honours. He sat in the House of Lords until his retirement on 1 October 2020.

==Charitable Associations==
Lord Freeman was the chairman of the Charity SkillForce from 2004 to 2016. He is now Patron of SkillForce and the Independent Transport Commission.

==Personal life==
His wife, Jennifer Freeman, is a former Secretary of the Victorian Society and is a specialist developer of architecturally historic buildings.

<doc id="767299" wikidata="Q14708039" url="?curid=767299" title="Moores Creek National Battlefield">
<text>Moores Creek National Battlefield is a battlefield managed by the U.S. National Park Service. The park commemorates the 1776 victory of a thousand patriots over about eight hundred loyalists at Moore&#x27;s Creek. The battle dashed the hopes of British provincial governor Josiah Martin for regaining control of North Carolina for the Crown. The loyalist defeat simultaneously ended British plans for an invasionary force to land in Brunswick Town. The Second Continental Congress voted to declare independence from the British on July 4, 1776, shortly after the battle; which took place in the Wilmington area near Currie in Pender County in southeastern North Carolina. The national military park was established on June 2, 1926, and was redesignated as a national battlefield on September 8, 1980.

==Background==
Loyalists, mostly Scottish Highlanders, many of whom did not have muskets and were wielding broadswords, expected to find only a small Patriot force on February 27, 1776. Before the arrival of the Loyalists, the Patriots removed the planks from the bridge that crossed Moore&#x27;s Creek. After removing the planks of wood, they smeared the remaining crossing beams with lard. This forced the Loyalists to cross the bridge in single file. As the Loyalists advanced across the bridge, Patriot shots rang out and dozens of Loyalists fell into the creek below, including their commanders. At the time, the creek was an estimated six feet deep. One commander, Lieutenant Colonel Donald McLeod, died in the battle. Another commander was Colonel Allan MacDonald, the husband of Flora MacDonald of Highland lore who aided Bonnie Prince Charlie following the Jacobite defeat at Culloden Moor in 1746.

Stunned, outgunned and leaderless, the Loyalists either surrendered or retreated in confusion. Wagons, weapons and British Pound sterling worth more than $1 million by today&#x27;s value were seized by the Patriots in the days following the battle.

This dramatic victory ended British authority in the colony and greatly influenced North Carolina to be the first colony to vote for independence. The Battle of Moores Creek Bridge, coupled with the Battle of Sullivan&#x27;s Island near Charleston, South Carolina, a few months later, were the first open conflicts of the American Revolution. Both ultimately led the Thirteen Colonies to declare independence on July 4, 1776.

==Description and administrative history==

The central Moores Creek most likely was named in honor of Elizabeth Moore, a pioneer settler.

Throughout the park, there are remnants of the 1776 road traveled by Patriot and Loyalist forces. A 1-mile (1.6-km) trail with wayside exhibits leads through the battlefield and across Moores Creek. The historic bridge site is located along the trail. The park, located in a rural area, offers a visitor center with exhibits and audio-visual program, a 0.3-mile (500 m) colonial forest trail, and a picnic area.
