<text>Kayak is a Dutch rock band formed by Ton Scherpenzeel and Pim Koopman in Hilversum in 1972. In 1973, their debut album &quot;See See the Sun&quot; was released, including three hit singles. Their popularity was mainly in the Netherlands, with their top hit &quot;Ruthless Queen&quot; reaching No. 6 on the Dutch charts in March 1979. They disbanded in 1982 after releasing nine albums.

In 1999, the band was asked to perform on the TV show &quot;De Vrienden van Amstel Live&quot;. After this performance, they decided to reform, and released nine further studio albums and three live albums.

==History==
Co-founder Ton Scherpenzeel is the only member who has played on every Kayak album. Apart from keyboards, he also plays accordion, occasional bass guitar (for instance on the entire &quot;Nostradamus&quot; album) and double bass. He also provides backing vocals and sings lead vocals on the song &quot;Love&#x27;s Aglow&quot; on the original &quot;Merlin&quot; album.

Singer/drummer Max Werner provided lead vocals on the first five albums. He switched to drums and percussion in 1978, a position he held for the following four albums. In 1999, he returned as lead singer for the &quot;Close to the Fire&quot; album. After that album, he did a short tour with Kayak, but left the band in 2000. Werner has released four solo albums and he had a hit in Europe in 1981 with the single &quot;Rain in May&quot;.

Johan Slager played guitar on every album until the split in 1982. He joined the band for the occasional live performances in the 1990s, but was not involved in the reunion of 1999. He was replaced by Rob Winter, who played on two albums before Joost Vergoossen became the next lead guitarist.

Drummer Pim Koopman was also a founding member. After &quot;The Last Encore&quot; in 1976, he decided to leave the band; he was offered a job as a full-time producer, working with Dutch artists Maywood, Valensia, Robby Valentine, and Petra Berger. He came back as drummer in 1999 and did not leave the drum stool until his death on 23 November 2009, aged 56. Apart from drums, Koopman played occasional keyboards and guitar, as well as providing lead and backing vocals. After leaving the band in 1976, he was replaced by Charles Schouten, who was subsequently replaced by vocalist Max Werner in 1978 until the band&#x27;s breakup in 1982. Following his death, he was replaced by Hans Eijkenaar.

Original bass player Cees van Leeuwen left in 1975 to concentrate on his studies. He became a lawyer, and in 2002, he became the Dutch State Secretary of Culture and Media in the short lived Balkenende 1 cabinet. He was replaced by Bert Veldkamp, who played bass in from 1975 to 1976 and returned for the 1999 reunion. After the 2003 album &quot;Merlin – Bard of the Unseen&quot;, Veldkamp left Kayak because he could not combine his work in a band with his own career.

Peter Scherpenzeel, Ton&#x27;s younger brother, was Kayak&#x27;s roadie in the early days. In 1978, he joined as the band&#x27;s bass player, when Theo de Jong left after just one album. Peter played bass on Kayak&#x27;s best-selling album &quot;Phantom of the Night&quot;, as well as on the two following albums.

Long-time Kayak fan Edward Reekers became lead singer in 1978, when Max Werner changed to drums. The first song he recorded was &quot;Ruthless Queen&quot;, which became Kayak&#x27;s biggest hit. He remained lead singer until 1982. After that, he did two solo albums and worked as a backing vocalist, doing commercials, and lending his voice to cartoon films and children&#x27;s TV shows. When singer Bert Heerink had other commitments in 2003, Reekers replaced him at some &quot;Merlin&quot; concerts. It was the beginning of his comeback, followed by the &quot;Nostradamus&quot; album in 2005 on which Edward plays the part of the monk. After that album, Heerink left the band and Reekers was Kayak&#x27;s only male lead singer again.

From 1978 until 1981, Kayak was augmented by two female background singers; Katherine Lapthorn, wife of bassist Peter Scherpenzeel, sang on three studio albums. After the split in 1982, she left the music business. Ton Scherpenzeel&#x27;s wife Irene Linders not only sang backing vocals, but also developed into the band&#x27;s main lyricist. When Kayak reunited in 1999, she became the band&#x27;s manager.

=== Since the 1999 reunion ===
Bert Heerink (ex Vandenberg) was asked to help the band out on tour in 2000. The plan was that on stage he would do the songs that Edward Reekers did originally, leaving more room for Max Werner to do his own Kayak songs and play percussion. But when Werner left, he was not replaced, so Heerink became lead singer. He did three studio albums and one live album before concentrating on his solo career.

Rob Vunderink joined in 2001 as extra guitarist and vocalist. Vunderink is an experienced musician who played in many Dutch bands since the 1960s. He collaborated with Pim Koopman in the Diesel band, which reached No. 25 on the American Billboard Hot 100 charts with the single &quot;Sausalito Summernight&quot;.

In 2003, female singer Cindy Oudshoorn joined Kayak for the &quot;Merlin&quot; album and tour, and she decided to stay.

In 2005, Jan van Olffen joined Kayak as their bass player. He had previously worked with Sister Sledge amongst others, and played in the house band for many Dutch stage musicals. Monique van der Ster also joined the band briefly in 2005 as a vocalist.

On 4 January 2008, the band released &quot;Coming Up for Air&quot;. That same day saw the start of their 35th anniversary tour. On 7 October 2008, they ended the tour at the Paradiso in Amsterdam. The concert was released on CD and DVD as &quot;The Anniversary Box&quot; in December 2008.

In October 2009, the band embarked on a Dutch tour. According to Ton Scherpenzeel (on the band&#x27;s website), after that tour, Kayak would no longer do the album-tour-album-tour cycle. They would probably keep on making new music though, as Scherpenzeel stated. But the sudden and unexpected death of Pim Koopman in November 2009 (halfway through the tour) made the future of the band uncertain.

In May 2010, the band&#x27;s website announced a tribute concert for Pim Koopman. The concert was held on 22 November at the Paradiso. It involved not only Kayak, but also some artists with whom Koopman had worked in the past. Some of the names that appeared on stage: Pussycat, Karen Maywood, Alides Hidding, José Hoebee and Michael Robinson. Okkie Huysdens (with whom Koopman formed The President) and Jeroen Engelbert (one of many members of Koopman&#x27;s band Diesel) also performed. For the occasion, Kayak used Hans Voerman as an extra keyboard player. The drum stool was occupied by Hans Eijkenaar. After the concert, Kayak announced that Eijkenaar was the new drummer of Kayak. With Eijkenaar on drums, Kayak released their album &quot;Anywhere But Here&quot; in September 2011.

After the Pim Koopman Tribute in 2010, drummer Hans Eijkenaar was asked to become a full member. Besides playing drums, he was also responsible for the mixing of the Kayak albums &quot;Anywhere But Here&quot; and &quot;Cleopatra – The Crown of Isis&quot;. Eijkenaar was not always available for Kayak concerts; Sjoerd Rutten was the drummer when he was unable to perform.

On 21 September 2012, it was exactly 40 years ago that the band&#x27;s name was chosen. To celebrate this, Kayak went on a tour titled &quot;Journey Through Time&quot; after one of their songs. They played at least one song from each studio album. Also included was an excerpt from their forthcoming album &quot;Cleopatra – The Crown of Isis&quot;. That excerpt was also released on an EP, backed by a newly recorded version of &quot;Symmetry&quot;, a song that Scherpenzeel and Koopman originally wrote in 1971. The album &quot;Cleopatra – The Crown of Isis&quot; was released in November 2014.

In October 2014, both Edward Reekers and Cindy Oudshoorn announced that they would not take part in the live performances of the &quot;Cleopatra&quot; album in 2015. At the end of 2014, both announced their departure from Kayak, leaving the band without lead vocalists. At a one-off live performance of &quot;Cleopatra&quot; in March 2015 on the Dutch isle of Texel, Oudshoorn was replaced by Marjolein Teepen, who had worked with Kayak before. Male vocalists were Martin van der Starre, Alexander van Breemen—both of whom also sang on the album—and Rolf Koster.

In the summer of 2017, Kayak announced: &quot;The band that will go on tour features keyboardist Ton Scherpenzeel, guitarist Marcel Singor and vocalist Bart Schwertmann, as well as bass player Kristoffer Gildenlöw (who can be heard on the new album &#x27;Seventeen&#x27;) and- recently added to the band- drummer Collin Leijenaar.&quot; However, during their European tour of 2018, Kayak and Leijenaar decided to discontinue their collaboration. Hans Eijkenaar returned for the remaining part of the tour. In November 2021, Kayak announced that their next tour - scheduled for April/May 2022 - would be their last.

<text>181 Eucharis is a large, slowly rotating main-belt asteroid that was discovered by French astronomer Pablo Cottenot on February 2, 1878, from Marseille Observatory. It was his only asteroid discovery. This object was named after Eucharis, a nymph from the 17th-century novel &quot;Les Aventures de Télémaque&quot;.

In the Tholen classification system, it is categorized as a stony S-type asteroid, while the Bus asteroid taxonomy system lists it as an Xk asteroid. Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Goat Mountain Astronomical Research Station in Rancho Cucamonga, California during 2007 gave a light curve with a leisurely rotation period of 52.23 ± 0.05 hours.

This object is the namesake of a family of 149–778 asteroids that share similar spectral properties and orbital elements; hence they may have arisen from the same collisional event. All members have a relatively high orbital inclination.

<text>Berserker (also known as Berserker: The Nordic Curse) is a 1987 American slasher film written and directed by Jefferson Richard. The film centers on a group of campers who are stalked and murdered by a Viking berserker.

==Plot==

According to an old Nordic legend, a Berserker was a bloodthirsty warrior who ate human flesh, was forbidden a restful death and fated to be reincarnated in their blood kin. A summer camp accidentally stumbles across the Berserker legend when it arises in Rainbow Valley, an area settled by Norwegian immigrants. The camp is abuzz with rumours of a wild bear killing people in the area, including speculation about an old couple who get lost. But is it really a bear?

==Cast==

* Rodney Montague as Larry Fishman
* Valerie Sheldon as Kathy
* Shannon Engemann as Kristi
* Beth Toussaint as Shelly
* Mike Riley as Berserker
* John F. Goff as Officer Walt Hill
* George &quot;Buck&quot; Flower as Pappy Nyquist
* Oscar Rowland as Homer Roberts
* Beverly Rowland as Edna Roberts

==Production==

Parts of the film were shot at Big Cottonwood Canyon in Utah.

==Release==
===Home media===
The film was released on DVD by Quantum Leap on October 22, 2001. It was later released by Hollywood DVD on August 2, 2004. Vinegar Syndrome released the film on Blu-ray in 2019.

==Reception==

Andrew Smith from &quot;Popcorn Pictures&quot; awarded the film a score of 3/10, writing, &quot;Berserker&quot; sounded great and could have become a little slasher gem but the lack of the berserker on-screen is disappointing and ‘Gentle Ben’ the bear doesn’t have any need to be in here. One to avoid unless you have a burning desire to see every 80s slasher film&quot;. Todd Martin from &quot;HorrorNews.net&quot; offered the film similar criticism, calling it &quot;a boring, confusing, hokey, mess of a film&quot;. Will and Roni agreed that the Viking angle was underplayed.

<text>Berserker, also known as Berserker: Hell&#x27;s Warrior, is a fantasy-action-horror film based on Norse mythology. It was written, directed and produced by Paul Matthews and had its main release in 2004.

==Plot==
The film begins with a voice-over by Barek who refers to a Norse legend. According to the saga, Odin was spurned by Brunhild. The irate Norse god chained her to an altar in Asgard, surrounded by a ring of eternal fire. He decreed that only a pure-hearted man could overcome the supernatural flames and save the alluring Valkyrie. Her saviour&#x27;s fate should then be connected to hers forever. As Barek explains, he and his only brother learned about this as little boys and craved more and more to rescue the legendary beauty as they grew older.

As it is later on successively revealed by flashbacks, Boar eventually could not resist anymore and entered the ring of fire. Hereby he suffered severe burns. Barek followed him into the fire and remained wondrously unharmed. He unchained the Valkyrie and persuaded her to save Boar&#x27;s life. Unfortunately her bite turned Boar into a cannibalistic Berserker.

When their father, Viking leader Thorsson is in need of reinforcements because he is in war with the Army of the Nord, he joins an alliance with the Berserkers who are now led by Boar. Following their combined campaign, they fight each other. Thorsson uses fire against the otherwise immortal Berserker Boar. Barek cannot bear see his brother burning and calls Odin for help. Odin complies with Barek&#x27;s request but from now the fates of Barek, Boar, and Brunhilda are interlinked by a timeless curse.

==Cast==
* Paul Johansson as Barek 
* Craig Sheffer as Boar 
* Kari Wuhrer as Brunhilda / Anya
* Patrick Bergin as Thorsson

==Reception==
The film was called &quot;over-ambitious&quot; and even a &quot;train wreck&quot;. The sounds of the valkyries reminded another critic of the &quot;hissing&quot; of his cat &quot;when she sees another cat&quot;. In February 2018, the film was released with Rifftrax commentary.

<text>The Acrochordidae, commonly known as wart snakes, Java wart snakes, file snakes, elephant trunk snakes, or dogface snakes are a monogeneric family created for the genus Acrochordus. This is a group of basal aquatic snakes found in Australia and tropical Asia. Currently, three species are recognized.

==Description==

All are entirely aquatic, lacking the broad belly-scales found in most other snakes and possessing dorsally located eyes. Their most notable feature is their skin and scales. The skin is loose and baggy, giving the impression of being several sizes too large for the snake, and the scales, rather than overlapping, are tiny pyramidal projections that led to their common names.

This type of snake are ambush predators, lurking at the bottom of rivers, streams and estuaries, and waiting for fish to approach, which they grip with their coils. The rough scales allow them to hold the fish despite the mucus coating. Adults grow to between 60 cm and 2.43 m in length.

==Geographic range==
Found from western India and Sri Lanka through tropical Southeast Asia to the Philippines, south through the Indonesian island group to Timor, east through New Guinea to the northern coast of Australia to Mussau Island, the Bismarck Archipelago and Guadalcanal Island in the Solomon Islands.

==Commercial exploitation==
These animals are rapidly becoming rare as their hides are used for handbags and leather (stripped of scales, of course). Numerous attempts have been made by both zoos and private reptile collectors to keep them, but in all cases, they have been reluctant to feed and prone to skin infections.

==Taxonomy==
There are many synonyms for the family Acrochordidae including: Acrochordina , Acrochordidae , Acrochorniens , Acrochordidae , Acrochordinae , Acrochordoidae , Acrochordini 

There are also many synonyms for the genera &quot;Acrochordus&quot; including: &quot;Acrochordus&quot; , &quot;Chersydrus&quot; , &quot;Chersidrus&quot; , &quot;Acrochordus&quot; , &quot;Chersydreas&quot; , &quot;Chershydrus&quot; , &quot;Verrucator&quot; , &quot;Chersydraeas&quot; , &quot;Potamophis&quot; , &quot;Chersydraeus&quot; , &quot;Acrochordus&quot;

<doc id="775452" wikidata="Q144279" url="?curid=775452" title="182 Elsa">
<text>182 Elsa () is a Massalia or background asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 7 February 1878, by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa at the Austrian Naval Observatory in today&#x27;s Croatia. The S-type asteroid has a very long rotation period of 80 hours and likely an elongated shape. The origin of its name is uncertain.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Elsa&quot; is a member of the Massalia family (), a very large inner belt asteroid family consisting of stony asteroids. In a different HCM-study, however, it has been found to be a non-family asteroid from the main belt&#x27;s background population.

It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.0–2.9 AU once every 3 years and 9 months (1,371 days; semi-major axis of 2.42 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.19 and an inclination of 2° with respect to the ecliptic.

== Naming ==

The origin of this minor planet&#x27;s name is uncertain. Originally, the asteroid was named &quot;Elsbeth&quot; – the Austrian variant of &quot;Elisabeth&quot; – and only later changed into a more lyrical &quot;Elsa&quot; with the consent of the discoverer, Johann Palisa. It may have been named after the character in the legend of Lohengrin perpetuated by Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera of the same name. It may also refer to the Empress Elisabeth of Austria (1854–1898), or to a relative of Admiral Bourgignon, who requested the naming, as he was the military superior of the discoverer at the Naval Observatory at Pola. Finally, the name &quot;Elsbeth&quot; just might have been chosen generically as it is one of the most common feminine Christian names.

== Physical characteristics ==

&quot;Elsa&quot; has been characterized as a common, stony S-type asteroid in both the Tholen and SMASS classification.

=== Rotation period ===

The asteroid is a relatively slow rotator. In 1980, its rotation period was estimated to be about 3.3 Earth days. In 2008, a collaborative effort from three different sites under the lead of Frederick Pilcher was used to build a complete lightcurve for the asteroid, which showed a period of hours with a brightness variation of in magnitude. A possible companion has been proposed to explain the slow rotation. Other period determinations gave similar results between 80.166 and 80.23 hours with an outlier by the Palomar Transient Factory.

Elsa has very amplified lightcurve indicating an elongated or irregular body. It was one of five minor planets included in the 1993 study, Transition Comets -- UV Search for OH Emissions in Asteroids, which was research involving amateur astronomers who were permitted to make use of the Hubble Space Telescope.

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, &quot;Elsa&quot; measures between 36 and 45.72 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.196 and 0.2106.

During 2002, &quot;Elsa&quot; was also observed by radar from the Arecibo Observatory. The return signal matched an effective diameter of .

<doc id="775456" wikidata="Q2660946" url="?curid=775456" title="Fascio">
<text>&#x27; (; : fasci&quot;) is an [[Italian language|Italian]] word literally meaning &quot;a bundle&quot; or &quot;a sheaf&quot;, and figuratively &quot;league&quot;, and which was used in the late 19th century to refer to [[political groups]] of many different (and sometimes opposing) orientations. A number of [[nationalism|nationalist]] &quot;fasci&quot; later evolved into the 20th centuryFasci movement&quot;&#x27;, which became known as &quot;fascism&quot;.

==Origin==
During the 19th century the bundle of rods, in Latin called &quot;fascis&quot; and in Italian &quot;fascio&quot;, came to symbolise strength through unity, the point being that whilst each independent rod was fragile, as a bundle they were strong. By extension, the word &quot;fascio&quot; came into modern Italian political usage to mean group, union, band or league. It was first used in this sense in the 1870s by groups of revolutionary democrats in Sicily, to describe themselves. The most famous of these groups was the Fasci Siciliani during 1891–94. Thereafter, the word retained revolutionary connotations. It was these connotations which made it attractive, for example, to young nationalists who demanded Italian intervention in World War I. The &quot;fasci&quot; they formed were scattered over Italy, and it was to one of these spontaneously created groups, devoid of party affiliations, Benito Mussolini belonged.

==History==

===World War I===
On 18 August 1914 Italian syndicalist Alceste de Ambris, speaking from the rostrum of the Milanese Syndical Union (USM), began a ferocious attack against neutrality in World War I and urged intervention against German reaction and the necessity of aiding France and the United Kingdom. He equated the war with the French Revolution.

This caused a deep split within the Unione Sindacale Italiana (USI). The majority opted for neutrality. The Parma Labor Chamber, the USM, and other radical syndicalists left the USI and on 1 October 1914 founded the &quot;Fasci d&#x27;Azione rivoluzionaria internazionalista&quot;. On October 5 Angelo Oliviero Olivetti published his manifesto in the first issue of a new series of &quot;Pagine libere&quot;. Benito Mussolini shortly thereafter joined this group and took leadership.

====Mussolini&#x27;s split====
On 11 December 1914 Mussolini started a political group, &quot;Fasci d&#x27;azione rivoluzionaria&quot;, which was a fusion of two other movements: the above group, &quot;Fasci d&#x27;azione rivoluzionaria internazionalista&quot; and a previous group he started called the &quot;Fasci autonomi d&#x27;azione rivoluzionaria&quot;.

This new group was also referred to as the Milan &quot;fascio&quot;, of which Mussolini was the leader. 24 January 1915 was the turning point in the history of the &quot;fasci&quot; as their leaders met in Milan and formed a national organization.

===After World War I===
In 1919, after the war had ended, Mussolini reconstituted the Milan &quot;fascio&quot;, using the new name Fasci italiani di combattimento (&quot;Italian league of combatants&quot;). Other &quot;fasci&quot; of the same name were created, with the common goal of opposing all those– including the king and state– whose specific leanings were deemed to be depriving Italy of the fruits of victory in the war. According to H. W. Schneider, the new Milan &quot;fascio&quot; was formed of roughly the same people who had been members of the older &quot;fascio&quot; in 1915, but with a new name and a new objective.

On 7 November 1921 the Partito Nazionale Fascista (PNF), National Fascist Party, came into existence.

===After World War II===
In Italy, after World War II, the term &quot;fascio&quot; is used as a pejorative for &quot;neo-fascista&quot;.

===Other Italian Fasci===
*Fasci of the Veneto, led by Dino Grandi and Pietro Marsich

<text>Out Stack () is an island in Shetland, and the northernmost point of Scotland, the United Kingdom, and the British Isles.

It lies northeast of Muckle Flugga and north of the island of Unst.

It is one of the North Isles of the Shetland Islands and lies within the Hermaness National Nature Reserve.

It is uninhabited and there is no landfall directly to the north.

==Description==
Out Stack is little more than a rocky outcrop, and is uninhabited. It has been described as &quot;the full stop at the end of Britain&quot;. Travellers would not encounter any further land masses between Out Stack and the North Pole if heading directly north.

==Jane Franklin==
Jane Franklin, the wife of the Arctic explorer John Franklin, landed on Out Stack after John Rae&#x27;s reports of the fate of the Franklin expedition had reached Stromness, Orkney, where she lived, in 1853/54.

==Hermaness National Nature Reserve==
The Hermaness National Nature Reserve covers the Muckle Flugga rocks and Out Stack, as well as the seabird cliffs and moorland of Hermaness.

<doc id="775493" wikidata="Q7920567" url="?curid=775493" title="Venus Alley, Butte">
<text>Venus Alley (also known as Whore, Peasant and Piss Alley) was a famous red-light district once located in Butte, Montana in the United States. It flourished from the late 19th century through the early 20th century and was one of the last openly tolerated urban prostitution districts in the American West, along with the one in Reno, Nevada. It was closed in the 1970s.

==History==
Venus Alley rose in the 1880s during the heyday of Butte as a wide-open copper-mining town, full of hundreds of saloons and gambling halls. The block-long district was located in the center of town off Wyoming Street. The name &quot;Venus Alley&quot; came from the rear entrance of the famous Dumas Brothel, one of the longest running houses of prostitution in the U.S. The brick-lined alley was lined with &quot;cribs&quot;, overhung with a single white light bulb over each entrance. Although made illegal in 1890 by the city fathers, the establishments continued to operate by bribery of the city police.

The north side of the alley was lined with the famous &quot;double-deckers&quot;, where the alley-level cribs were surmounted by a wooden planks and a second row of cribs. The women who worked the cribs typically wore brightly colored and short-skirted dresses, and would stand in the windows to attract customers. The cribs were equipped with call boxes for ordering drinks or food from nearby bars and noodle parlors.

In 1903, prostitution was regulated in Butte. The women were ordered to wear longer dresses with high necklines, and blinds had to be installed in the windows. The prostitutes banded together and protested. Street solicitation was banned, so doorways were opened up into the cribs and passageways between then built, creating a labyrinth off of the street where the women continued to solicit.

The area expanded in around 1916 when the price of copper rose to a new high, but was closed down the following year by Federal law designed to protect WW1 soldiers from venereal disease. However prostitution continued underground.

The area reopened in the 1930s, and a screening fence erected at the end of the alley to keep the activities hidden from the public view. In 1943 prostitution was prohibited in Butte, the cribs closed down although the more discreet brothels continued to operate.

==Decline==
After WW2 the cribs reopened, but were demolished in 1954, following the city&#x27;s designation as a National Historic Landmark the year before. The Windsor Hotel, a brothel, was closed by arson in 1968. Its madam, Beverly Snodgrass, went to Washington to complain to her senator about the loss of her income. She claimed she had been paying the Butte police $700 a month for protection. Senator Mike Mansfield decided this was a local matter not a federal one. Following an eight part series on vice in the &quot;Great Falls Tribune&quot;, the remaining three brothels in Butte closed. The Dumas Brothel soon reopened and continued to operate until 1982. Its closure coincided with the closure of the last copper mine in the area.

The structure of the Dumas Brothel, as well as the brick-lined alley, still stands in uptown Butte and has become a tourist attraction.

<text>183 Istria is a stony background asteroid from the central regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 8 February 1878, by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa at the Austrian Naval Observatory in Pola, in what is now Croatia. The S-type asteroid has a rotation period of 11.77 hours. It was named for the Istrian Peninsula.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Istria&quot; is a non-family asteroid from the main belt&#x27;s background population. It orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 1.8–3.8 AU once every 4 years and 8 months (1,703 days; semi-major axis of 2.79 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.35 and an inclination of 26° with respect to the ecliptic.

== Physical characteristics ==

&quot;Istria&quot; has been characterized as a common, stony S-type asteroid in both the Tholen and SMASS classification.

=== Rotation period ===

In August 1979, a rotational lightcurve of &quot;Istria&quot; was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer Alain Harris. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of 11.77 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.31 magnitude (). Observations by French amateur astronomer Laurent Bernasconi gave a similar period of 11.6 hours ().

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, &quot;Istria&quot; measures between 30.779 and 35.43 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.1890 and 0.2582.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named after the Istrian Peninsula in the Adriatic Sea, where the city of Pula (then Pola) with its discovering observatory is located. A the time the peninsula was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The asteroid&#x27;s name was given by Vice-Admiral Bernhard von Wüllerstorf-Urbair, who is known as the captain of the first Austrian circumnavigatory adventure with the sail frigate SMS &quot;Novara&quot;. The official naming citation was mentioned in &quot;The Names of the Minor Planets&quot; by Paul Herget in 1955 ().

<text>Merkur (, &quot;Mercury&quot;) is a North American brand of automobiles marketed by the Lincoln-Mercury division of Ford Motor Company for model years 1985-1989. Drawing its name from the German word for Mercury, Merkur, the brand targeted buyers of European executive cars, marketing two captive import models manufactured by Ford of Europe&#x27;s German division.

Following the 1989 model year, Lincoln-Mercury withdrew Merkur, making it one of the most short-lived automotive brands in modern American automotive history, lasting one model year longer than the Edsel.

== Background ==
During the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United States and Canada, buyer preferences in the luxury-vehicle segment began shifting from once traditional Cadillac, Lincoln and Chrysler models towards more European-produced and inspired vehicles. As a response, the Japanese automotive industry launched luxury-oriented brands developed for North America, including Honda&#x27;s Acura brand launched in 1985 and Nissan and Toyota launching Infiniti and Lexus, respectively, in 1989.

In its own response, Ford created the Merkur brand in November 1983 with an expected launch for the 1985 model year. Instead of developing all-new products, Merkur adapted vehicles from Ford of Europe to meet American safety and emissions regulations. During the 1970s, the Mercury Capri had been imported from West Germany, becoming the most-imported car in the United States behind the Volkswagen Beetle.

In the initial launch of Merkur, approximately 800 Lincoln-Mercury dealers signed on to represent the brand. Advertising and PR materials urged using the German pronunciation of the brand name, German for &quot;Mercury&quot;, and vehicle emblems highlighted their manufacture by &quot;Ford Werke AG-Cologne, West Germany&quot; (Cologne Body &amp; Assembly).

==Models==
Merkur marketed two models: the three-door XR4Ti hatchback and the five-door Scorpio hatchback. North American regulations dictated numerous modifications, including 5-mph bumpers, FMVSS 108-compliant headlamps, and an instrument panel with non-metric gauges.

===XR4Ti===
Introduced for 1985 as the introductory Merkur vehicle, the Merkur XR4Ti was a performance-oriented hatchback. Sized nearly identically to the Ford Mustang hatchback, the XR4Ti was a slightly rebodied version of the Ford Sierra XR4i, the mid-range sporting model of the Sierra. Its name highlighted its turbocharged engine (see below), exchewing anything that might conflict with General Motors&#x27; branding, e.g., the GMC Sierra and Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera nameplates. 

Its engine was a modified version of the a 2.3L turbocharged inline-4 used by the Ford Mustang SVO and the Ford Thunderbird Turbo Coupe, with its intercooler deleted. The engine made when paired with a 5-speed manual transmission and with a 3-speed automatic transmission. 

The body of the XR4Ti was shared with the Sierra XR4i, modified for American regulations and using the C-pillar windows of the 5-door Sierra and opening rear quarter windows behind the front doors. In line with the Sierra XR4i, the Merkur XR4Ti was distinguished by a large biplane rear spoiler, similar to that of the Ford Mustang SVO.

Adapting the Merkur XR4Ti for North American sale required final assembly by specialty manufacturer Karmann in Rheine, West Germany. Prior to the 1988 introduction of the Merkur Scorpio, the XR4Ti was the sole Merkur model. In early 1989, the XR4Ti was discontinued.

===Scorpio===
Introduced in mid-1987 as a 1988 model, the Merkur Scorpio targeted the executive sedan segment. Recalling the styling of the Mercury Sable and Ford Taurus, the Scorpio was an extended-wheelbase version of the Ford Sierra, making it the largest car sold by Ford of Europe. 

As an entry-level luxury car, the Merkur Scorpio competed against sedans including the Acura Legend, Audi 100, Mercedes-Benz 190E, Saab 9000, Sterling 827, and Volvo 740. In sharp contrast to many of its competitors, the Scorpio was offered only as a 5-door hatchback (a configuration otherwise only offered by Saab and Sterling in North America). The model offered an optional Touring Package upgrade. 

The Merkur Scorpio (unlike the XR4Ti) was assembled on the Ford Cologne assembly line in West Germany. The body was largely unchanged for North America, with the exception of 5-mph bumpers, and US-market bumpers; Merkurs are also distinguished by badging and full-width taillamps. Powertrain modifications were minimal, as the 2.9L V6 was an engine used in North America (by the Ranger and Bronco II). While a 5-speed manual transmission was standard, nearly every Scorpio sold was equipped with a 4-speed automatic transmission. 

One of the shortest-lived vehicles ever produced by Ford Motor Company, the Merkur Scorpio was discontinued at the end of the 1989 model year, marking the end of the Merkur brand.

==Discontinuation==
In the United States and Canada, Merkur was ultimately not considered a success by Ford. Projected to sell 15,000–20,000 vehicles annually, the brand only sold 26,000 XR4Tis in its first two years; sales declined nearly 50% for 1987. On average, each Lincoln-Mercury dealer would sell one to two Merkur vehicles each year. 

Several factors led to the slow sales of the Merkur line, including an unfavorable exchange rate between the dollar and the West German Deutsche mark, leading to unstable pricing. By 1989, the Merkur Scorpio rivaled the Lincoln Town Car in price, despite its strong visual resemblance to the far more affordable Mercury Sable. Alongside the lack of sales from either the Scorpio and the XR4Ti, the fate of the Merkur line was ultimately sealed by passive restraint requirements in North America. To bring the two vehicles into compliance for 1990, the two vehicles would have required the addition of airbag(s) or a passive restraint system (automatic seatbelts), requiring an expensive redesign for both model lines (the Ford Sierra and Ford Scorpio did not receive airbags until their 1993 and 1994 replacements, respectively). 

As slow sales of the brand did not justify the expense of such a redesign, Ford withdrew the XR4ti in early 1989, with sales of the Scorpio ending at the end of the model year.

<text>John Prettyjohns, VC (11 June 1823 – 20 January 1887) was a Royal Marine and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Prettyjohns was born at Dean Prior, near to Buckfastleigh, Devon, to William Pethyjohns (1800–1889) and his wife Margaret ( Pow, 1805–1866). His early years were spent labouring in Buckfastleigh.

==Military career==
On 10 June 1844, Prettyjohns enlisted as a private in the 59th Company, Plymouth Division, for unlimited service – and collected 2s 6d for attestation. On the following day, he collected a bounty of £3 17s 6d for oath of allegiance. He embarked on to south-east America and East Indies on 22 March 1845, being flogged for an unknown misdemeanour on 28 June. He disembarked at Chatham on 23 August 1849, and joined HMS &quot;Bellerophon&quot; on 7 November 1850. On this ship, he embarked for the Mediterranean in January 1852, being promoted to corporal on 15 January. On 17 October 1854, HMS &quot;Bellerophon&quot; bombarded Sevastopol during the Crimean War.

On 5 November 1854, Corporal John Prettyjohns won the Victoria Cross during the Battle of Inkerman.


On 16 January 1856, Prettyjohns was promoted to sergeant and embarked on for Hong Kong on 12 March 1857. He was promoted to colour sergeant on 29 April, and on 26 June a VC was sent to the Admiralty and despatched to China for presentation. On 16 July, he sailed for Singapore and Calcutta on , arriving in Fort William, Calcutta later that year. On 28 December he took part in the capture of Canton before embarking on for Vancouver and San Juan Island. On 17 December 1863 his final tour of duty came to an end. He was discharged on 16 June 1865 after 21 years and 6 days service – 16 years 94 days of which were spent at sea or abroad.

==Personal life==
Prettyjohns married his first cousin, Elizabeth Prettyjohns (7 May 1826 – 19 August 1912), at Plymouth Register Office on 10 February 1850. They had two children: Elizabeth (Bessie) Prettyjohns (1857 – 13 July 1889); and Alice Maud Prettyjohns (28 February 1865 – 4 July 1960).

Following his discharge, Prettyjohns retired to the Greater Manchester area, and became a Golf Club steward at Whalley Range Bowling Club, Albert Road, Withington, Lancashire. He died on 20 January 1887 at Chorlton upon Medlock, Lancashire and is buried in the Southern Cemetery, Manchester.

==Legacy==
The Royal Marines hold a procession each autumn to honour the memory of Prettyjohns. His Victoria Cross and other medals are displayed at the Royal Marines Museum, Southsea, England.

<text>184 Dejopeja is a large M-type Main belt asteroid. It was discovered by Johann Palisa on February 28, 1878, and was named after Deiopea, a Roman nymph.

This is an X-type asteroid with a diameter of 66 km and a geometric albedo of 0.190. Based upon Photometric observations taken during 2000, it has a synodic rotation period of 6.441 ± 0.001 h. The light curve is tri-modal, most likely due to an angular shape, with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.19 ± 0.01 in magnitude.

<text>185 Eunike is a dark and very large main-belt asteroid, with an approximate diameter of 157 kilometres. It has a primitive carbonaceous composition.

It was discovered by C. H. F. Peters on March 1, 1878, in Clinton, New York and named after Eunike, a Nereid in Greek mythology whose name means &#x27;happy victory&#x27;. The name was chosen to celebrate the Treaty of San Stefano (1878).

Based upon photometric observations made between 2010 and 2014, this asteroid has a rotation period of 21.812 ± 0.001 hours and a brightness
variation of 0.08 ± 0.01 in magnitude. At opposition, the absolute magnitude was measured at 7.45 ± 0.01. It displays a hemispheric albedo dichotomy similar to that on 4 Vesta.

As of 17 September 2020, there have been thirteen observed occultations of stars by Eunike.

<doc id="775536" wikidata="Q234386" url="?curid=775536" title="The 4400">
<text>The 4400 (pronounced &quot;the forty-four hundred&quot;) is a science fiction television series produced by CBS Paramount Network Television in association with BSkyB, Renegade 83, and American Zoetrope for USA Network in the United States and Sky One in the United Kingdom. It was created and written by Scott Peters and René Echevarria, and it starred Joel Gretsch and Jacqueline McKenzie. The series ran for four seasons from July 11, 2004, to September 16, 2007.

==Premise==
In the series&#x27; pilot episode, a ball of light deposits a group of 4400 people in the Cascade Range foothills near Mount Rainier, Washington, in the United States. Each of the 4400 had disappeared in a beam of green light in 1946 or after. None of them have aged from the time of their disappearance. Confused and disoriented, they have no memories of what transpired prior to their return.

==Title==
Creator Scott Peters has stated that the series was originally titled &quot;A Light in the Sky&quot;, but looking for something unique he decided to &quot;play around with numbers&quot; instead and arrived at &quot;4400&quot; because it &quot;just sounded cool&quot; and &quot;was a very round number with two 4s and two 0s&quot;.

== Synopsis ==

The National Threat Assessment Command (NTAC), a division of the Department of Homeland Security, is in charge of dealing with the return of the 4400. Dennis Ryland is the head of NTAC. Ryland assigns Tom Baldwin and Diana Skouris as the lead team to investigate the 4400. In the second season, Ryland goes to Washington and is replaced by Nina Jarvis. In the fourth season, Meghan Doyle takes over as the head of NTAC.

Many of the returnees have trouble getting their lives back on track after being gone from the world for years. More significantly, a small number of the returnees begin to manifest paranormal abilities, such as telekinesis, telepathy and precognition, as well as other &quot;gifts&quot;. For example, in the pilot, Shawn Farrell manifests an ability to heal the broken neck of a dead bird, bringing it back to life. In addition, one of the 4400, Lily Moore, has become pregnant between her disappearance and return.

The first-season finale, &quot;White Light&quot;, reveals that the 4400 were abducted not by aliens, but by humans from the Earth&#x27;s future, that Kyle Baldwin was to be their &quot;messenger&quot;, and that they were returned to avert a catastrophe.

By the second season, it is revealed that all 4400 have a fictional neurotransmitter, promicin, in their brains, which gives them their powers. The government, afraid of what this large group would do with such power, had secretly been dosing all of the 4400 with a promicin inhibitor, which had worked on most, but not all, of the 4400. One of the inhibitor&#x27;s side effects is a potentially fatal immune deficiency. The inhibitor is ultimately removed from the 4400 by a dose of promicin extracted by Kevin Burkhoff from the blood of the infant Isabelle, who was never given the inhibitor.

At the beginning of the third season, the Nova Group, a terrorist faction made up of 4400s, emerges. Originally formed as a &quot;defensive&quot; group in the aftermath of the promicin-inhibitor scandal, the Nova Group eventually carries out numerous terrorist attacks against the government and NTAC. The group is responsible for many terrorist attacks including the assassination of the men involved with the promicin-inhibitor conspiracy; the attempted assassination of Ryland; the framing of Baldwin for murder; and the driving of another person to insanity.

During the third and fourth season, it is revealed that only a certain faction from the future wants to see history changed. Another faction, which prefers the status quo, opposes the 4400, and has sent their own operatives, including Isabelle Tyler and &quot;the Marked&quot;, into the past. The exact motives of both factions were not revealed.

Eventually, Jordan Collier, a returnee who declares himself the savior of humanity, makes promicin shots available to the general public. However, only half of the human population can actually tolerate promicin, and thus develop superhuman abilities, while the other half die upon taking the shot. Although the government outlaws promicin use, thousands of previously ordinary people have developed superhuman abilities, severely complicating NTAC&#x27;s task. Collier later annexes a part of Seattle and transforms it into &quot;Promise City&quot;, a self-proclaimed paradise open to all people with superhuman abilities. The US government attempts to reclaim Promise City but meets with little success.

At the conclusion of the series, Danny Farell&#x27;s uncontrolled ability exposed some of the residents of Seattle to promicin, resulting in about 9,000 deaths and as many newly empowered humans, while at the same time forcing the remains of NTAC (now themselves mostly promicin-positive) to ask Jordan Collier and his followers (as the only group immune to the 50% chance of death from exposure) to become the &quot;de facto&quot; government of Seattle. The series ended with a cliffhanger, with Collier pledging to build the future he had promised, while the government watches uneasily as Collier&#x27;s militia remains in control of Seattle, now known as Promise City.

===Promicin===
In the series, promicin is a fictional neurotransmitter the human body produces that controls and regulates bodily functions. In the 4400, it enables every member to use parts of the cerebellum no human has previously used. This is the cause of the new abilities in each returnee. Promicin&#x27;s behavior and effects are unpredictable, potentially giving any ability. As part of a government conspiracy, every 4400 is regularly injected with a promicin-inhibitor, suppressing their potential new abilities.

Since the government ceases injecting promicin inhibitor, every 4400 develops an ability.

Dr. Kevin Burkhoff devises a way to artificially create 4400 abilities through a series of promicin injections, using himself as a test subject, giving him regenerative abilities. The government finds out about this breakthrough and builds up its own stockpile of a much purer promicin (extracted from Isabelle Tyler), which they in turn use to create at least one group of soldiers with 4400 abilities, as demonstrated by the government&#x27;s attack on Promise City. Jordan Collier steals the government&#x27;s supply, and begins distributing it via human couriers to anyone who wants the shot.

An injection of promicin has a 50% chance of either killing the person taking the injection (by way of an aneurysm) or giving them a 4400 ability. In the fourth season, Dr. Burkhoff claims to have discovered how promicin interacts with the body, thus being able to predict whether a person will survive the shot or not. It is explained that nine out of ten left-handed people who take the shot survive. In the brain there is a small part called the corpus callosum. It is essentially a bundle of neural fibres that connects the two hemispheres and it is usually slightly larger in left-handed people than it is in right-handed people. That is why left-handed people survive; the size of that part of the brain helps determine whether or not a person will be able to integrate a new neurotransmitter. With further research, Dr. Burkhoff believes a simple CAT scan will be able to tell how anyone&#x27;s body will react to a promicin shot.

There exists a substance that can eliminate all traces of promicin in the human body, effectively robbing the injected individual of any 4400 powers and in addition making this person allergic to promicin. The identity and makeup of this substance is not stated, and the only known source of it so far is from the future. A second method also exists for removing promicin from non-4400 humans, through the promicin-neutralizing ability of Jordan Collier.

There also appears to be a substance that can counteract the anti-promicin&#x27;s effects as Tom Baldwin, during his time as a member of the &quot;Marked&quot;, uses this substance to help Isabelle Tyler regain her powers by removing her promicin allergy. Like the anti-promicin, this substance appears to be from the future.

As discovered by Marco in the episode &quot;The Starzl Mutation&quot;, Seattle Presbyterian Hospital started using a flawed radiation machine to treat cancer patients in 1969. The microswitches that controlled the machine were not functioning properly, so the doses were incorrect. This went on for just under five years. Once the hospital recognized the issue, they tested everyone who had ever been exposed to it and in some cases the radiation induced a small mutation. This mutation was a slight alteration of the eleventh chromosome, named the &quot;Starzl mutation&quot; after the manufacturer of the faulty machine.

The mutation is hereditary, meaning people that got it passed it onto their children. The Starzl mutation is both harmless and conserved in those offspring; they live normal healthy lives. While the offspring of a returnee normally do not retain the ability to generate promicin, a second-hand report from John Shaffner (an ex-special operations soldier) suggested that the offspring of a 4400 and a Starzl mutant will be &quot;promicin-positive&quot;, meaning they will have abilities. This is believed by Tom Baldwin and Diana Skouris to be the reason the abductees were returned to the Seattle area – it is the only place they are likely to encounter individuals who possess the Starzl mutation and therefore the only place they are likely to produce children with 4400 abilities.

The promicin-inhibitor &quot;piggybacks on glucose&quot;, after entering the brain through facilitated diffusion. It is a binding protein; that is, it binds itself to promicin in the body and neutralizes it. If there is no promicin for it to bind to, it remains in the body. Eventually, it builds up to toxic levels in the lymph nodes, damaging the immune system. The result is a chemically induced immunodeficiency.

To counteract the promicin inhibitor, Dr. Burkhoff develops a serum containing Isabelle&#x27;s pure promicin. This serum neutralizes the charge so the inhibitor is not able to cross membranes and can be flushed out of the body.

===Setting===
&quot;The 4400&quot; is set in Seattle, Washington, United States, but actually filmed in the Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, area. Settings include:
*Promise City: founded by Jordan Collier with the guidance of Kyle Baldwin. It is created as a haven for people who are promicin-positive (P-positives), and also serves as the base of Collier&#x27;s movement to spread promicin to the world. Collier intends for Promise City to be a model for the future, and the first stage to creating &quot;Heaven on Earth&quot;. Though the characters claim that the location is on the Duwamish River delta, the map used and the footage featuring Promise City makes it clear this is impossible. The commentary states that Promise City was shot in Vancouver on the Burrard Inlet below the Second Narrows Bridge.
*Haspel Corporation: a fictional company whose name is also abbreviated as HaspelCorp, Haspelcorp, or Haspel Corp. The corporation&#x27;s name and logo are introduced in the last minute of the episode &quot;Graduation Day&quot;, where it is also implied that its building possesses at least 24 floors. A private defense contracting company of which Dennis Ryland is an executive, Haspel Corporation is the only known manufacturer of promicin, which they had been getting by filtering the blood from Isabelle Tyler. In the book &quot;Welcome to Promise City&quot;, Haspel Corporation has been banished out of Promise City&#x27;s limits. The filming location used for HaspelCorp is the Life Sciences Centre at the University of British Columbia. It is home to the university&#x27;s Life Sciences Institute and one of the medical research facilities on campus.
*The 4400 Center: a fictional building founded by Jordan Collier between the first and second seasons as a place where 4400s could take sanctuary and learn to harness their abilities, and where non-4400s could seek out the &quot;inner&quot; 4400 in themselves. A side effect of non-4400s joining the scheme was that they brought a great deal of money into the center. When Jordan was assassinated, Shawn Farrell (Jordan&#x27;s &quot;protégé&quot;) took over the operation of the center. Characters in the show sometimes call the 4400 Center a cult. The center was closed down and seized by the government in the third-season finale. In the fourth season, Shawn reopens the center as a base for his healing foundation. In the 4400 book &quot;Promises Broken&quot;, the 4400 center stands as the last stand against the government in the Battle for Promise City. According to a postcard in the third-season episode &quot;Gone&quot;, the fictional location of the center is 6265 Crescent Road, Seattle, Washington. The same street address in Vancouver is the address for the Chan Centre, the real-life building portrayed as the 4400 Center.

== Episodes ==

&quot;The 4400&quot; ran for four seasons. The first season is presented as a miniseries of five episodes, which aired weekly from July 11, 2004, to August 8, 2004, with a two-hour premiere. The second, third and fourth seasons are each 13-episode seasons (counting the two-hour premieres in the second and third seasons as two episodes). A special episode, &quot;The 4400: Unlocking the Secrets&quot;, aired between the second and third seasons, on June 3, 2006, originally on NBC.

Production of the third season was shot in Vancouver until July 26, 2006. The third season premiered June 11, 2006, with 4.2million viewers tuning in. Executive Producer Ira Steven Behr described the third season as &quot;bigger and more mythic. It feels like 26 episodes instead of 13 because we&#x27;re cramming so much stuff in&quot;. Billy Campbell, the actor who plays Collier, took most of the third season off to sail around the world, returning in the final four episodes.

Production of the fourth and final season began in early 2007 for a mid-year premiere, returning with the episode &quot;The Wrath of Graham&quot;.

== Books ==

* &quot;The Vesuvius Prophecy&quot;, by Greg Cox, is the first book based on the series. It was released in June 2008. Set during the show&#x27;s third season, the plot revolves around Maia&#x27;s prophecy of the eruption of Mount Rainier.
* &quot;Wet Work&quot;, by Dayton Ward and Kevin Dilmore, is the second original novel based on the series. Published in October 2008, it is set during the show&#x27;s second season. Its plot concerns Tom and Diana&#x27;s hunt for a rogue government assassin who uses her promicin powers to kill people.
* &quot;Welcome to Promise City&quot;, by Greg Cox, is the third book based on the series, and the first set after the events of the end of the series. It was published on July 28, 2009.
* &quot;Promises Broken&quot;, by David Mack, is the fourth book based on the series and the second set after the end of the show. It concludes most of the saga of the 4400, but it too ends on a cliffhanger. It was published on October 27, 2009.

== Production ==

On September 14, 2000, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that American Zoetrope, an independent film production company owned by the family of filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola, had made two television production deals; one of them being made with Viacom to produce full-length television series, having themselves been in the television production industry before with miniseries and made-for-television films like &quot;Dark Angel&quot; and &quot;Moby Dick&quot; and already produced their first full-length series &quot;First Wave&quot; for Space in Canada and the Sci-Fi Channel in the United States. &quot;The 4400&quot; was the only product to ever come out of the American Zoetrope/Viacom deal, as Viacom would split at the start of 2006 into CBS Corporation and a new Viacom, the former of which took over Viacom&#x27;s place as co-producer of the series.

The theme song of the show is &quot;A Place in Time&quot;, written by Robert Phillips and Tim Paruskewitz and performed by Amanda Abizaid. All seasons are filmed in high-definition with closed captioning. USA Network broadcast episodes after the first season in fullscreen format; the DVD releases contain the episodes in their native widescreen format.

NBC/Universal created several sites targeted at fictional members of the 4400 universe:

* Anti-promicin
* Undecided
* Pro-promicin

Subsequent to the cancellation of the series, these web sites were allowed to lapse and none of them are active any further. Most of them have now been parked.

=== Cancellation ===
Writer and co-creator Scott Peters announced on December 18, 2007, that due to the ongoing Writers Guild of America strike, budgetary problems, and lower-than-anticipated ratings, &quot;The 4400&quot; had been cancelled and would not be returning for a fifth season.

=== Soundtrack ===
The soundtrack to &quot;The 4400&quot; was released on May 8, 2007, by Milan Records and includes music from the first three seasons, as follows:
# Bosshouse featuring Amanda Abizaid – &quot;A Place in Time&quot; (Theme from &quot;The 4400&quot;)
# Switchfoot – &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;
# People in Planes – &quot;Falling by the Wayside&quot;
# Thirteen Senses – &quot;Into the Fire&quot;
# Ivy – &quot;Worry About You&quot;
# Engineers – &quot;How Do You Say Goodbye?&quot;
# Maroon 5 – &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot;
# Jacqueline McKenzie – &quot;Shy Baby&quot;
# Bedroom Walls – &quot;Do the Buildings and Cops Make You Smile?&quot;
# Billie Holiday – &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot;
# John Van Tongeren – &quot;Salvation&quot;
# The Landau Orchestra – &quot;A Place in Time&quot; (instrumental arrangement)
The last track does not appear in the series. Although not included on the soundtrack, &quot;Life for Rent&quot; by Dido was used in the episode &quot;The Gospel According to Collier&quot;. The song &quot;Where Is My Mind?&quot; by the Pixies was later used in the series finale.

==Home media==
The first season was released on Blu-ray in Germany during August 2017, with the remaining seasons releasing in the subsequent months.

Via Vision Entertainment released the complete series on Blu-ray in Australia on November 25, 2020.

==Reception==
&quot;The 4400&quot; received positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 95% approval rating.

== Reboot ==

In November 2018, it was announced that a reboot of &quot;The 4400&quot; was in development at The CW. Taylor Elmore and Craig Sweeny, the latter of whom worked on the original series throughout its entire run as a writer and later as a supervising producer, would write and serve as executive producers of the &quot;reimagined&quot; series through their deals with the original series&#x27; producer, CBS Television Studios. Elmore would serve as showrunner should the project move forward.

In February 2019, it was reported that the project would roll over to the next development cycle to allow Elmore and Sweeny to finish the pilot script. In February 2021, The CW ordered the show straight-to-series for the Fall 2021 season. &quot;Riverdale&quot; co-executive producer Ariana Jackson and Anna Fricke will serve as showrunners. In March 2021, Joseph David-Jones and Khailah Johnson were cast as series regulars. In April 2021, Brittany Adebumola, Jaye Ladymore and Amarr Wooten joined the cast as series regulars. In May 2021, TL Thompson, Cory Jeacoma, Ireon Roach, Derrick A. King and Autumn Best were also cast. The series premiered on October 25, 2021. In May 2022, the series was canceled after one season.

<text>186 Celuta is a 50 km Main belt asteroid. It was discovered by the French astronomers Paul Henry and Prosper Henry on April 6, 1878. This was the last discovery credited to the Prosper brothers. It is classified as an S-type asteroid.

The asteroid is named after Céluta, a female character in two works of fiction by François-René de Chateaubriand, &quot;Atala&quot; (1801) and &quot;René&quot; (1802). The Henry brothers had already named another of their discoveries, 152 Atala, after the heroine of &quot;Atala&quot;. Both Atala and Céluta are American Indian fictional characters.

Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico during 2010 gave a light curve with a period of 19.842 ± 0.001 hours and a brightness variation of 0.54 ± 0.02 in magnitude.

<text>Henri Jean Cochet (; 14 December 1901 – 1 April 1987) was a French tennis player. He was a world No. 1 ranked player, and a member of the famous &quot;Four Musketeers&quot; from France who dominated tennis in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

Born in Villeurbanne, Rhône, Cochet won a total 22 majors including seven Grand Slam singles, five doubles and three mixed doubles. In addition he won three singles, two doubles and one mixed doubles ILTF majors. He also won one professional major in singles. During his major career, he won singles and doubles titles on three different surfaces: clay, grass and wood. He was ranked as world No. 1 player for four consecutive years, 1928 through 1931 by A. Wallis Myers. Cochet turned professional in 1933, but after a less than stellar pro career, he was reinstated as an amateur in 1945 after the end of World War II.

The Four Musketeers were inducted simultaneously into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island in 1976. Cochet died in 1987 in Paris at age 85.

==Early life and family==
Henri Cochet was born on 14 December 1901 in Villeurbanne to Gustave Cochet and Antoinette Gailleton. His father was a groundkeeper at a Lyonnaise tennis club where Henri worked as a ball boy and thus had a chance to practise for free. He began playing at the age of eight along with his sister. The president of the club, a silk-factory owner and French-ranked player Georges Cozon, recognized his talent and volunteered to coach him. He entered his first local tournament in 1920 where he met his mentor in the final. Cochet then moved on to win a series of matches at Aix-les-Bains mostly scratch and handicap matches. In 1921 he decided to compete in Paris, which was the center of tennis life, and registered for the French Covered Courts tournament second-class draw, in which he reached the final where he beat Jean Borotra in five sets. That qualified him for entry at the 1921 French Closed Championships where he repeated his victory over Borotra and subsequently broke into the top ten French rankings at the end of the year. Also in 1921 he won the Military Championship of France. Meanwhile, his sister Aimée (Charpenel) Cochet also became a tennis player and competed in the main draw of the 1930 Wimbledon Championships.

==Tennis career==
===Rise to prominence (1922–1925)===
In February 1922 Cochet traveled to the World Covered Court Championships in Saint Moritz in Switzerland where he defeated Borotra in a five-set final and formed a team with him to gain the doubles trophy against Jacques Brugnon and Marcel Dupont. He clinched the 1922 World Hard Court Championships in Brussels defeating Count Manuel de Gomar in the singles final and triumphing in the doubles events, partnering Jean Borotra and Suzanne Lenglen respectively. After his success abroad Cochet claimed the French Closed Championships by defeating defending champion Jean Samazeuilh in the final. Afterwards Cochet topped the French rankings. In June 1922 he debuted in the French Davis Cup team against Denmark and won both his singles and the doubles match. In the next round the team only composed of him and André Gobert and fell to the Australasian team. Cochet also found moderate success in the minor tournaments; at the South of France Championships he lost to Russian Count Mikhail Sumarokov-Elston. At the Côte d&#x27;Azur Championships Cochet warded off the Englishman Morgan for his first Riviera title. After winning the Hard and Clay Court World Championships in 1922 Cochet was ranked 6th by A. Wallis Myers&#x27;s world&#x27;s best ten list.

In February 1923 Cochet retained his World Covered Court Championships title, defeating John B. Gilbert in the final in straight sets. On 1 April 1924 he met René Lacoste in the championships match for the Beausite trophy of Cannes and beat his compatriot in straight sets. At the 1924 Summer Olympics Cochet won the silver medal in both the singles and doubles with his teammate Borotra, while Vincent Richards took the gold for the United States in both events, pairing with Frank Hunter for the latter. He was ranked the number one player of France alongside Lacoste and Borotra at the end of the year and was ranked 9th in A. Wallis Myers&#x27; world ranking list for 1924. Due to his business affairs and injuries Cochet missed most of the 1925 season, while he kept his French first place shared with Borotra. The French International Championships of that year marked the first instance of an all-Four Musketeers final in the doubles of the Championships where Brugnon and Lacoste were victorious against Cochet and Borotra.

===The Musketeers Era (1926–1933)===

====International success (1926–1927)====

In January 1926, Cochet defeated Henry Mayes for the New Courts of Cannes Championships and repeated this feat on the first day of February in the final of the Gallia L.T.C. of Cannes tournament. In March for his first Menton crown he engaged in a five set battle against Hungarian champion Béla von Kehrling and prevailed. Cochet again came short to win a triple crown the following week at the Parc Impérial where despite winning both doubles with Julie Vlasto and Italian champion Umberto de Morpurgo he dropped the singles to his latter doubles partner. A week later at the Côte d&#x27;Azur Championships he overcame Swiss champion Charles Aeschlimann in straights finishing the match with a love set. Cochet also won the mixed title with Helen Wills. At the 1926 French Championships in June he dethroned René Lacoste as the titleholder and reached the top spot again in the French rankings. A month later he clinched his first non-francophone title in the 1926 Wimbledon Championships doubles playing with Jacques Brugnon. In September the 1926 U.S. National Championships were invaded by the French top players and they each reached the quarterfinal stage. Their opponents were Americans Bill Tilden, Vincent Richards, Bill Johnston and Norris Williams. At the so-called &quot;Black Thursday&quot;, three Americans yielded to the French, Cochet defeated Tilden, ending his six-year winning streak at Forest Hills and only lost to compatriot Lacoste who became the first foreign US champion since Laurence Doherty in 1903. Cochet was ranked in the top three in A. Wallis Myers 1926 World rankings and world second in doubles with Jean Borotra.

He began his 1927 training in Cannes in January by collecting back-to-back series of French Riviera cups, including a triple crown victory at the Métropole Club and Carlton Club, and a doubles at the New Courts L.T.C. He continued with a triple crown at Gallia L.T.C. also in Cannes and a second triple feat at the Nice Lawn Tennis Club. Cochet triumphed at the doubles events at the Hotel Bristol of Beaulieu in mid-February. In Marseilles he was upset by Christian Boussus in the semi-finals. In April at the Championnats de la Côte Basque of Pau he overcame Eduardo Flaquer in singles, and with Jacques Brugnon finished second behind the Spanish duo of Flaquer and Raimundo Morales-Marquez, while the mixed went also to Cochet and Germaine le Conte. In June the Four Musketeers held their second all-French doubles final of the 1927 French Championships where Cochet and Brugnon beat Borotra and Lacoste.

All these achievements were a prelude to the 1927 Wimbledon Championships where in successive rounds fourth-seeded Cochet defeated two leading Americans Frank Hunter and Bill Tilden and finally Jean Borotra in remarkable five set matches, all of whom had a two-sets advantage against him. Tilden served for the match, leading 5–1 in the third set and had a match ball. In the final Borotra left six match points unconverted to open the route for Cochet&#x27;s revival. With the latter one Cochet set a Wimbledon final comeback record that stands up to this day. He then again met Hunter and Tilden in the final of the doubles, this time he joining forces with Jacques Brugnon and lost the championship despite having a match point. This was the first of three consecutive encounters between the French and American teams as in early September the 1927 Davis Cup final took place in the United States where the US Davis Cup team led by Tilden and Hunter faced the challenging team of the Musketeers. France won 3–2 with Cochet victorious in the decider against Bill Johnston and reclaiming the Davis Cup for France the first time since 1920. A couple of days later the French troupe went to compete in the U.S. National Championships at the West Side Tennis Club in New York. Cochet and Eileen Bennett became the mixed doubles champions. When he returned home in the first week of October Cochet took revenge on Christian Boussus in their second meeting in the final of the Coupe Porée of Paris. The same week he was ranked third in the world for the second consecutive year although this time he finished ahead of compatriot Borotra. In November he won the Swiss Covered Courts Internationals in a short twenty-five-minute final against Donald Greig.

====Breakthrough season (1928)====

1928 was the first year of Cochet&#x27;s hegemony of the world rankings. This was the result of his overall season, that as usual commenced on the French Riviera. Prior to that he was drafted into a Queen&#x27;s Club – Sporting Club de Paris warm-up team challenge. He contributed to the Parisian victory with two mixed and a singles win. The following month he swept almost all available Riviera titles from February to March. He kicked off the tour by winning his first mixed New Courts L.T.C title with his U.S. Championships partner Eileen Bennett. In February he successfully defended his Métropole Club and Gallia L.T.C. singles titles by defeating Henry Mayes twice in a row. In the Monaco Cup at the La Festa Country Club Cochet turned the tide from two sets down against two-times reigning champion Béla von Kehrling, the first meeting of a rivalry that continued onward into the year. They both reached the mixed doubles final, which remained unplayed and the prize was divided. The Cochet – Brugnon pair also won the Butler Cup there (reserved for doubles of the same nationality). At the Nice Lawn Tennis Club tournament they met again for the singles contest and Cochet won in straight sets. Cochet completed his second triple crown there. In Menton at the official Riviera Championships eventual singles victor Von Kehrling and former Danish Champion Erik Worm warded off Cochet and Count Salm in the doubles final. In the mixed Von Kehrling and Cilly Aussem beat the seasoned duo Cochet–Bennett. His third Côte d&#x27;Azur Championships trophy was granted to him after Otto Froitzheim traveled home before the final and gave him a walkover. One week later at the 50th Cannes Championships he reached the final to face Henry Mayes again, but due to misunderstandings he was 10 minutes late and had been defaulted from the tournament. Subsequently, he lost the mixed doubles match alongside Phyllis Satterthwaite and only found his form in the doubles with Jack Hillyard at the expense of their opponents Count Salm and Worm. In April at the Biarritz tournament Cochet routed compatriot Roger George in four sets. He was victorious in Marseilles versus Emmanuel du Plaix and in the mixed with Cilly Aussem. The Miramar L.T.C. tournament in Juan-les-Pins resulted in a three set final between René Gallèpe of Monaco and Cochet and ended in favor of the Frenchman.

Cochet then set to compete across Europe. As the reigning champions the French Davis Cup team had only one scheduled challenge match during the season and could skip the preliminary rounds. Lacoste and Cochet entered the British Hard Court Championships. Pat Spence eliminated Cochet in the semi-final stage but lost to Lacoste in the final. Cochet and Bennett gained the mixed doubles title. In May he accepted a one-on-one and a doubles challenge with Béla von Kehrling and the Hungarian Davis Cup team in Budapest. In front of a local crowd of 3000, Cochet won in four sets against the home favorite. The doubles match between Von Kehrling – Jenő Péteri and Cochet – Roger Danet was indefinitely suspended due to bad light conditions at one set each. The next stop was in Vienna where he won the Austrian International Championships. Returning home he secured his French International Championships title by overcoming Lacoste in the final in four sets. The doubles were won by Jean Borotra and Jacques Brugnon despite the efforts of Cochet and René de Buzelet. Cochet and recurring partner Bennett added the French hard courts mixed title to their set of accolades after defeating Helen Wills, women&#x27;s world champion, and Frank Hunter, the No. 2 USLTA player in a three-set championship match. On 6 July at the 1928 Wimbledon Championships Lacoste equalized with a victory over Cochet and deprived him of the title. Cochet and Bennett lost in the mixed quarterfinals. Cochet and Brugnon won the doubles again over Gerald Patterson and John Hawkes after their 1926 triumph. At the end of July in the Challenge round of the Davis Cup at Roland Garros the Musketeers, with the absence of Brugnon, defeated the United States to keep the trophy in French possession. Cochet won all three of his rubbers.

The overseas campaign of Cochet started at the U.S. National Championships, which he kept for France for the third straight time. His opponent in the final was Frank Hunter who was defeated in a five-set match. In October the French supremacy continued with him and Christian Boussus sharing the final Pacific Southwest Championships of Los Angeles, Cochet claimed that title as well. In early December Racing Club de Paris, Cochet&#x27;s club, visited Hamburg for an inter-club match. The French team left with a landslide victory over the German top ranked players; the score was eleven to one. He finished the year with the Coupe de Noël in Paris during the last days of December. The final saw Jean Borotra forfeiting to Cochet.

Cochet was ranked World No. 1 amateur in 1928 by A. Wallis Myers, Pierre Gillou (&quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;), Bill Tilden, F. Gordon Lowe (&quot;The Scotsman&quot;), W. J. Daish and Vincent Richards.

====French dominance (1929)====
The 1929 season did not begin as flawless as the previous one; on 20 January Jean Borotra beat Cochet in their first ever Belgian Covered Courts tournament final, which took five sets to decide. Cochet won the Gallia tournament for the fourth time and the Monte Carlo Cup for the second time, eliminating Italian aces Giorgio de Stefani in the semi-final and Umberto de Morpurgo for the former championships and de Morpurgo again for the latter. He also defended his Monaco mixed title for the first time and the Butler Cup for the third. But he lost in Roubaix and in Biarritz to Christian Boussus (5th in French rankings) and Pierre Henri Landry (7th in French rankings) respectively, which raised concerns and let to newspaper speculation about a loss of form. In Berlin at the Rot-Weiss Club Tournament he defeated Roderich Menzel in the singles event and clinched the doubles with Jacques Brugnon. His only loss came in the mixed doubles with Cilly Aussem against teammate Brugnon and Bobby Heine, which went to three sets. He successfully defended the Austrian championships against Franz Wilhelm Matejka and claimed the doubles with Roger Danet. He claimed the Czechoslovakian Championships from fellow countryman Christian Boussus. They joined forces and together won the doubles.

In May at the 34th French Championships the men&#x27;s doubles tournament took place first. With Lacoste – Borotra&#x27;s victory over Tilden – Hunter and Cochet – Brugnon&#x27;s easy win over Gregory – Collins in the semi-finals secured the Four Musketeers their third doubles face-to-face final. Unfortunately for Cochet in the fifth set they were serving for the match and had thirty-love in the game, when Brugnon missed an easy ball when three match points were at stake. Lacoste and Borotra revived from that moment on and closed out the final set 8–6. In singles he was put out of the contest by Borotra in the semi-finals and thus was unable to retain his title. However, Cochet did not leave without a trophy as the mixed championship was earned by him and Eileen Bennett Whittingstall.

Cochet then set out for an exhibition tour through central Europe in June, playing in Budapest, Belgrade and Vienna.

=====Rivalry with the United States team=====
Cochet was seeded first at the 1929 Wimbledon Championships. He marched through the earlier rounds, having only one five-set match against Irish champion George Lyttleton-Rogers. In the quarterfinals he beat Hendrik Timmer in straights, then Bill Tilden in the semi-finals also in straights and second seeded compatriot Jean Borotra for the championship in his third straight sets victory in a row. Despite this he lost 63 games throughout the tournament, which was the most among the seeded players (third-seeded semi-finalist Tilden only lost 27). In doubles he reached the quarterfinals with Jacques Brugnon but was beaten by Wilmer Allison and John Van Ryn, who later became champions. In the mixed doubles draw the titleholders Cochet and Eileen Bennett Whittingstall lost to eventual runners-up Joan Fry and Ian Collins in three sets. The singles victory marked the sixth straight time that a French player won Wimbledon and the fifth time that the final was contested between two Frenchmen, counting from the first French victory in 1924. A couple of days later in the Regent&#x27;s Park the top Wimbledon players participated in an exhibition event to raise funds for children of the British war cripples.

In July the French team was challenged by the United States team in the 1929 Davis Cup three-day final. On 26 July 12,000 people watched the first day of the encounter at the Roland Garros stadium. The French squad took the lead when Borotra beat George Lott. The second match was scheduled between Cochet and Tilden. The American started off poorly; he was not able to win one single point in the first game, hit many unforced errors, especially in the longer rallies, and Cochet pulled away and took the set. In the second Tilden forced a backhand game, but it did not pay off, and he lost that set as well, six games to one. Tilden relied on his serves but was only capable of winning six games in the whole match when he lost the third set six to two. According to contemporary statistics Cochet did not hit any unforced errors of faults during the match. The next day French captain Pierre Gillou sent Cochet and Borotra for the doubles rubber. Cochet was exhausted and showed the opposite form compared to the previous day. Despite all efforts by his partner Borotra, Cochet hit most of the balls out or into the net. The American duo of Wilmer Allison and John Van Ryn took a three-set win. The third day Tilden saved the hopes for his team when he beat Borotra in front of a capacity crowd of 15,000. The deciding rubber was between Cochet and George Lott. Cochet won in four sets and claimed the Cup for France for the third time.

After the Davis Cup tie Cochet only played in minor tournament and doubles matches. He won the singles in La Baule against Raymond Rodel and the mixed doubles in Vals-les-Bains. Rodel, Cochet, Jacques Brugnon and Pierre Henri Landry, representing the Racing Club de Paris, sailed to Japan for a series of friendly matches against the Japanese Davis Cup team where Cochet suffered a surprise defeat against Takeichi Harada. They then visited India to face the Indian Davis Cup team in a series of exhibitions. Cochet won all of his matches. In 1929 Cochet was ranked World number one amateur by A Wallis Myers, Hungarian tennis magazine &quot;Tennisz és Golf&quot;, edited by Béla von Kehrling, by rival Bill Tilden, F. Gordon Lowe, &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot; and Vincent Richards Evidently he led the French rankings as well. In December he was inducted as Honorary Member to the U.S.L.T.A. in New York.

====The Four Musketeers become three (1930)====
In early 1930 Cochet decided to rest and only compete in doubles contests. He won at Gallia L.T.C., Carlton L.T.C. (also in mixed doubles with Elizabeth Ryan), Biarritz, La Baule mixed doubles with Ryan. His only singles loss came at the Belgian International Championships to Jean Borotra. His most successful French Championships came in this year when he was close to winning a triple crown after being victorious in singles over Bill Tilden, in doubles with Jacques Brugnon over Harry Hopman and James Willard and was a finalist in the mixed tournament as well. At the 1930 Wimbledon Championships he was seeded first but made an early exit after his straight-set loss to Wilmer Allison in the quarterfinals. In the doubles Cochet—Brugnon lost in the semi-finals as well as in mixed doubles with Eileen Bennett Whittingstall.

While playing tennis he took up volunteer coaching, training French children in Paris every Sunday. In the sixth straight United States–France Davis Cup final the American team had a great start thanks to Bill Tilden, who handed Borotra the first loss of the tie. Cochet equalized against George Lott, winning in straight sets. In the doubles Cochet—Brugnon were selected to compete against Wimbledon champions John van Ryn and Wilmer Allison. Contrary to expectations it was Borotra who was the engine of the French pair. He won every service game, except for the third set where Cochet made a lot of errors at the net, and the French pair took the victory. Borotra thrilled the French spectators by beating Lott and keeping the Cup in France for another year. The dead rubber between Cochet and Tilden was won by the former. At the end of the year Cochet was ranked World number one amateur by A. Wallis Myers, Pierre Gillou, and Didier Poulain (&quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;) but came second in the list of Bill Tilden behind Borotra.

====Health issues (1931)====
In 1931 Cochet retained the Carlton L.T.C. doubles with Brugnon. In March he defeated George Lyttleton-Rogers for his third Monaco Cup crown. With Eileen Bennett Whittingstall they were crowned the mixed victors. Cochet became the Danish Covered Courts champion for the first time after defeating Danish national champion Einer Ulrich in Copenhagen. He won the mixed contest as well with Simone Barbier. He was invited by his hometown club F.C. Lyon to an interclub match with German Uhlenhorster Klipper. Cochet won all three of his matches. In the Moncean Club of Paris he partnered Paul Féret and Colette Rosambert and swept the doubles and mixed doubles respectively.

At mid-season, Zürich newspaper &quot;Sport&quot; ranked the top 15 European players, and listed Cochet first (Borotra second, Brugnon ninth). At that time Cochet was struggling with a shoulder injury. For the 50th anniversary of the Wiener Park Club of Vienna a tournament was organized with an international line-up. The two biggest contenders Cochet and Roderich Menzel met in the final, Cochet made a comeback from one set down to lift the trophy. He then toured Europe to give exhibitions in Cluj-Napoca, Budapest and Prague. Because of fever and a sore throat Cochet missed the French Championships. He did not recover from his illness before the second Italian International Championships but this did not prevent Cochet from signing up for the competition. With titleholder Tilden having turned professional and Cochet&#x27;s condition, the championships went easily to George Patrick Hughes. Cochet entered the finals of the doubles too, but his partner André Merlin could not make up for Cochet&#x27;s bad shape and they lost to Alberto Del Bono and singles victor Hughes.

After these losses Cochet took two weeks off to recover. Despite the rest in the 1931 Wimbledon Championships he shocked the tennis world by losing in the very first round to Nigel Sharpe. In the mixed doubles Cochet and Eileen Bennett Whittingstall were not more successful, falling in the fourth round. The doubles final remained unconquered for Brugnon and Cochet as the team of George Lott and John Van Ryn came back from 3–2 down in the fifth set to win the match. In July the Four Musketeers were ready to be challenged for the fifth time in the Davis Cup final. This time the opponent was the British Davis Cup team. In the first rubber Cochet was facing two set points for a two sets-love lead by Bunny Austin but fought back to claim the second set and won the next two for the match. Fred Perry battled through Borotra while the doubles were won by Cochet and Brugnon. Austin brought back the British hopes after a four set victory over the exhausted Borotra. The match was suspended multiple times due to rain, which made the court almost unsuitable for playing, which left its mark on the deciding rubber between Cochet and Perry. The recurring slight rain in the first set led Perry to drop the set from a 4–1 advantage. The second set went to Perry after he utilized passing shots as a counter for Cochet&#x27;s net play. The third and fourth set however were taken by Cochet which gave the French team its fifth successive Davis Cup.

Despite his turbulent year Cochet was ranked number one by A. Wallis Myers, Pierre Gillou, Didier Poulain, Stanley Doust, Bill Tilden, Noel Dickson (&quot;Melbourne Herald&quot;), &quot;Service&quot; (&quot;Western Mail&quot;) and &quot;Sport&quot; magazine (Zurich).

====Rivalry with Vines and turning professional (1932–33)====

During 1932 Cochet restricted his schedule to appearances at Monaco Cups, the French Championships, Wimbledon, U.S. National Championships and the Davis Cup and a minor tournament in Paris. In Monaco the Butler Trophy were won by Cochet and Jacques Brugnon over the Czechoslovakian duo of Roderich Menzel and Ferenc Marsalek. The mixed doubles was granted to Cochet and Colette Rosambert following the retirement of Béla von Kehrling and Elizabeth Ryan prior to the match due to the leg pain of Ryan. After that good start Cochet was ranked number one by Pierre Gillou right ahead of Ellsworth Vines and Bunny Austin.

In early June he won his fifth and last French Championships, beating Giorgio de Stefani in the final in four sets. Cochet also won his third doubles French Championships, this time with Jacques Brugnon. In the mixed event he reached the last four partnering Eileen Whittingstall and came up short against Fred Perry and Betty Nuthall. His combined record-breaking ten French titles of the 17 title matches are the most possessed by a male player.

A couple of weeks later in late June in the Wimbledon singles he again suffered a surprise loss to Ian Collins in the second round. In the mixed event Cochet and Whittingstall lost in semi-final stage, this time to Enrique Maier and Elizabeth Ryan. The singles competition was won by Ellsworth Vines, his first non-American title. The American Davis Cup team traveled back to France to challenge the reigning holder at the Stade Roland Garros. The French Musketeers secured the cup for the sixth and final time after four rubbers, losing only the doubles match. Cochet and Vines met in the dead fifth rubber. The face-off between the two was one of the few encounters that later had a decisive effect on the rankings. Vines ameliorated his team&#x27;s result by defeating Cochet in five sets. The two European major champions then met in the final of the U.S. National Championships final in September. Vines kept the national title home with his second win, a straight sets 6–4 victory over Cochet. Vines and Keith Gledhill subsequently beat Cochet and Marcel Bernard in the doubles final. Cochet and Virginia Rice were dropped out in the mixed semi-final while Vines reached the finals. These losses sealed the fate of the year-end rankings.

In November Cochet only competed in the Toussaint tournament, held at the Tennis Club de Paris, alongside Colette Rosambert with whom he lost to Jean Borotra and his more skilled female partner Helen Wills Moody. The year 1932 marked the first time Cochet slipped off the top of the charts after switching places with Vines. In June 1933 Cochet, seeded first, relinquished his French Championships title to Australian Jack Crawford, who overwhelmed him in the final in three straight sets, becoming the first non-French player to possess it. In July the French team lost the Davis Cup for the first time since 1927. In front of their home crowd on the clay courts of Roland Garros, but without Lacoste and Borotra, the French team lost 3–2 to Great Britain. Cochet was defeated by Fred Perry and won against Bunny Austin, both in five sets. At the 1933 Wimbledon Championships first-seeded Vines conquered Cochet, who was seeded third, in straight sets in the semi-final. It was the third time in a row that Vines beat Cochet. These events marked the end of the Four Musketeers era.

===Professional career (1933–1939)===
;1933
On 9 September 1933 Cochet turned professional, signing a contract with the Tilden Tennis Tour for a guaranteed annual payment of £25,000 and he joined the team of Bill Tilden and Martin Plaa. Although he was still featured on the amateur world rankings published on the 20th of the month, where he was listed one spot behind Ellsworth Vines at number six, Cochet was also on Pierre Gillou&#x27;s list in fourth place, also right after Vines. Cochet made his professional debut in a Franco-American match on 22 September and defeated Bruce Barnes. Three days later he lost to Tilden in straight sets. He also made appearances at the French Riviera with Plaa with back and forth matches across France. On 10 October Tilden signed Vines to the pro tour and from then Cochet&#x27;s archrival and him competed within the same league again.

;1934
In early 1934 Cochet went on to showcase in Santiago and Vina del Mar, where he was challenged by the Pilo Facondi and Perico Facondi brothers, Chile&#x27;s leading professionals, who both lost two matches each against Cochet. Plaa and Cochet returned in February to the Madison Square Garden where Vines and Tilden were already practising and waiting for them. In New York, Vines and Tilden outclassed Cochet in a four and five-set match respectively and the Americans were victorious in the doubles over the French pair as well. During the ten-city tour across the United States and Canada, the Tilden-Cochet match was always the main fixture. Tilden finished the tour as winner by an eight to two head-to-head margin against Cochet. In April in Providence Cochet was drawn to play Vincent Richards in singles and with Plaa played Barnes and Richards, both matches resulted in a French two straight sets victory. Cochet and Richards toured North America in April and May.

The first official tournament of a new tournament circuit was held in May at the Park Avenue Tennis Club, New York and was called the Eastern Pro Championships. Cochet finished in fourth place in the concluding round-robin. In late May Philadelphia hosted the Middle States tournament at its Germantown Cricket Club; Cochet advanced to the semi-final where Tilden&#x27;s superiority proved to be his undoing. Cochet then sailed home to France and consequently missed the US Pro Tennis Championships. He chose instead to gather money in exhibition matches in Havana, Haiti, and Martinique on his way home. In France the official tour continued in Bayonne in August, where Cochet dropped his two singles matches to Tilden and Keith Gledhill in front of a home crowd. A Marseilles team event was scheduled in September where Cochet lost to Tilden, equalized against Gledhill and lost again in the doubles with Plaa to the Americans, who took the final victory as well. Two weeks later in a single-elimination tournament at Cochet&#x27;s native Lyon Football Club he almost delighted the crowd with home victory but Tilden stole the second and third set to spoil the feat. Cochet subsequently suffered from an illness and missed the following events. Throughout the season Cochet earned a total of $17.381.

;1935
Cochet spent most of 1935 with a promotional tour across the globe, sponsored by the French government, which included Egypt, India, East Indies, Singapore, the Philippines, Vietnam, China and its final destination Australasia. At the Milton Courts in Brisbane his invited opponent was the recently turned professional Jack Cummings whom he battled twice, finishing one-all. The next opponent was James Willard and the match set up in Rushcutters Bay of Sydney, which served as a less-hard victory than that over Cummings. In a combined amateur and professional world ranking published by Pierre Gillou, president of the Fédération Française de Tennis (FFT), Cochet was ranked 10th.

;1936
In 1936 Cochet had a second chance to regain his spotlight when he was first seeded French Pro Championship after Bill Tilden and Bruce Barnes failed to show up due to travel issues. Cochet had a clean march to the final beating Martin Plaa on the way and faced Robert Ramillon for the title. In the end he celebrated his first Pro Major triumph since leaving the amateur class. He and his Irish partner Albert Burke were also the doubles champions with a win over the said French professionals. Next came the International Pro Championship of Britain where the round robin format resulted in a decider between Cochet and Hans Nüsslein. The German proved to be unstoppable as he scored a 6–3, 6–2, 6–2 upset over Cochet. Cochet found consolation in the doubles, where he completed a round robin flawless streak with his teammate Ramillon especially the last match over the American pair Lester Stoefen and Bill Tilden. He then held tennis shows across the Soviet Union including Moscow, Leningrad, and Kyiv.

;1937
In June 1937 he did not succeed in defending his French Pro title as Hans Nüsslein took it from him in three sets. The doubles final was played between Stoefen–Tilden and Cochet-Ramillon with the former team crowned champions in the end. Cochet then repeated the Soviet tour and missed the German Pro and the Bonnardel Cup. He returned to the tour at the end of September at the Wembley Pro where he won one match and was then knocked out at the semifinal stage by Tilden. Cochet then was a part of a rather fruitless Italian tour, his only notably victory came in the Foro Italico against Tilden. In late November and early December 1937, Tilden and Cochet toured Egypt.

;1938
1938 was spent mostly with Cochet-Tilden headlined trips to Asia and Ireland. Cochet also returned to the Soviet Union for the third straight time to accept a coaching venture, which turned out to be a short-term assignment as the Soviet government accused him of espionage and expelled him.

;1939
In the last pre-World War II year Cochet&#x27;s pro status allowed him to accept the request of the Hungarian Davis Cup team to become its trainer. He was then invited to the World Pro Championships, which was held at the Roland Garros in June–July. Cochet and Tilden were on the same half of the draw and it set up a quarter-final clash which Cochet was forced out of the tournament in five sets. He and Ramillon had a shot at the doubles title but they came short against pro newcomer Don Budge and veteran Ellsworth Vines.

===During Second World War (1939–1945)===
In 1940 France was overrun by Nazi Germany and for a brief period of time Cochet fell into war captivity. After his release he was not allowed to leave the country. He launched his own sporting goods store in Paris and lived on a farm in the outskirts. He gave tennis broadcasts, and accepted the Vichy government&#x27;s offer to head its youth tennis program and after that to become a sports commissioner, who organized sport programmes for the deported French armament workers. In December 1940 the first open tennis tournament, combining amateur and professional players, was organized in Paris where Cochet lost to Paul Féret. In December 1941 he regained his amateur status granted by the French Tennis Association. This was in line with the sports policy of the Vichy regime which opposed professionalism. The policy was administered by Borotra who had been appointed General Commissioner for Education and Sports in August 1940.

In 1942 a Closed French Championships was announced and the doubles was won by Cochet and Bernard Destremau. In 1943 he reached the singles finals in the same nationals losing it to Yvon Petra. He also participated in charity matches to raise funds for the prisoners of the Axis powers. The next year Cochet met Petra for the title and lost for the second consecutive time. In the last wartime championships of France he won the doubles title alongside Pierre Pellizza. Despite being a reinstated amateur he was still ranked 9th in the first official pro rankings published by the World&#x27;s Professional Tennis Association in 1945. After the End of World War II in Europe he played his first international match in Paris against Bill Sidwell, which he easily won.

===Last amateur years (1945–1958)===
Post-war tennis life resumed at the 1945–46 International Christmas Tournament of Barcelona where Yvon Petra dismissed Cochet in four sets. They reunited for the doubles event, which went to the home favorite duo of Jaime Bartrolí and Pedro Masip. At the time Cochet was the coach of Petra. In January the following year he reached the doubles final of the Estoril International Tournament partnering Robert Abdesselam. They met in singles competition in March at the Egypt International Championships where Cochet outplayed Abdesselam in straight sets. In July he celebrated his first Dutch championships title at Noordwijk with an overwhelming victory over Eustace Fannin. In 1948 a rivalry emerged between him and Spaniard Masip. They met in the French Covered Court Championship final where it took five sets to decide the outcome in favor of Masip.
Also in Paris in April Cochet failed to capture the International Championships title dropping it to Marcel Bernard. In the 1948–49 International Christmas Tournament of Barcelona Cochet met Masip in the doubles final, where the Spanish team of Masip-Carles granted a walkover to Cochet and Australian Jack Harper. In April 1949 Cochet knocked out Masip from the Paris International Tournament in the quarterfinals. They joined forces for the doubles contest, which they subsequently won. In May he faced Masip again in the championships match of the British Hard Court Championships, and lost to him in four sets. In August he was a singles and doubles finalist in the International Championships of Istanbul. In singles he was overcome by Gottfried von Cramm and in doubles by von Cramm and Harper. In December he finally acquired the Barcelona title by beating Harper in five sets.

Cochet played one of his last matches at the Swiss covered courts championships in St. Moritz, returning to the scene of his very first tennis triumph after a 36-year hiatus. At the age of 56 with his partner Bernard Destremau he managed to pass the first round of the doubles contest with a 6–2, 6–1 win over locals D. Wegs and H. Flury. Cochet retired from tennis later that year.

==Personal life==
Cochet married Germaine Desthieux on 16 April 1926. He taught her how to play tennis and later entered minor tournaments together. Apart from playing tennis Cochet was an amateur ice-hockey player. He ran a sporting goods store in Paris. Cochet was an occasional coach as well and in 1930 he coached the French junior tennis team once a week for free including his brother-in-law Georges Desthieux who won the New Malden tournament that year. He was awarded the Red Ribbon of the Legion of Honour for his sport merits in 1951. He died on 1 April 1987, aged 85, in Saint-Germain-en-Laye.

<text>187 Lamberta is a main-belt asteroid that was discovered by Corsican-born French astronomer Jérôme Eugène Coggia on April 11, 1878, and named after the astronomer Johann Heinrich Lambert. It was the second of Coggia&#x27;s five asteroid discoveries.

The spectrum matches a classification of a C-type asteroid, which may mean it has a composition of primitive carbonaceous materials. It is a dark object as indicated by the low albedo and has an estimated size of about 131 km.

<text>Jean Laurent Robert Borotra (, ; 13 August 1898 – 17 July 1994) was a French tennis champion. He was one of the &quot;Four Musketeers&quot; from his country who dominated tennis in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Borotra was imprisoned in Itter Castle during the latter years of World War II and subsequently fought in the Battle for Castle Itter.

==Career==
Borotra was born in Domaine du Pouy, Biarritz, Aquitaine, the oldest of four children.

Known as &quot;the Bounding Basque&quot;, he won four Grand Slam singles titles in the French, Australian, and All England championships. The 1924 French Championship does not count towards his grand slam total as the French was only open to French nationals and members of French clubs. He only failed to win the U.S. Championships, as he was defeated in the final by his countryman René Lacoste in straight sets, thus missing a career Grand Slam. His 1924 Wimbledon victory made him the first player from outside the English-speaking world to win the tournament. His first appearance was in the French Davis Cup team of 1921. He also made the final of the World Covered Court Championships in 1922, losing to Henri Cochet, but won the doubles and mixed doubles. The other major he did well in was the World Hard Court Championships (played on clay) – he won the doubles with Henri Cochet there in 1922.

Borotra was ranked as high as world No. 1 by Bill Tilden in 1930, although Tilden didn&#x27;t include himself in the ranking. He was ranked No. 2 by A. Wallis Myers of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 1926. Borotra won his last major in 1936 when he teamed up with Marcel Bernard for the French Championship doubles at Roland Garros.

In 1974, Borotra was one of the last three people to be awarded the IOC&#x27;s Olympic Diploma of Merit. And in 1976, he along with the three other Musketeers were inducted simultaneously into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island. In 1984, Borotra received a Distinguished Service award from the United States Sports Academy in recognition of his achievements. As the oldest living gentleman&#x27;s singles champion, Borotra was invited to present the singles champion his trophy at the 100th Wimbledon Championship in 1986.

On 17 July 1994, Borotra, founder and president of honour of the CIFP (International Committee for Fair Play) died at the age of 95, after a short illness. He was buried at Arbonne.

The International Fair Play Committee, which recognises achievements annually, awards a Jean Borotra World Fair Play Trophy. In 1998, the International Club (IC) introduced the Jean Borotra Sportsmanship Award, to recognise tennis players deemed to have shown outstanding sportsmanship throughout their career.

===Jean Borotra Sportsmanship Award===
The Jean Borotra Sportsmanship Award is an International Club (IC) award. It was introduced in 1998 to recognise tennis players deemed to have shown outstanding sportsmanship throughout their career.

The selection process involves a panel of international tennis journalists selecting a group of players who meet the IC&#x27;s core value, namely to &quot;develop, encourage and maintain the highest standards of sportsmanship and understanding among players of all nations and among young players in particular.&quot; The shortlist is then endorsed (or added to) by the 38 International Clubs around the world, from which a winner is picked.

The recipient typically receives their award in a private ceremony in London at the All England Club during the Wimbledon Championships.

==Personal life==
In 1938 Borotra married Mabel de Forest and they had one son. The couple divorced in 1947. In 1988 he married Janine Bourdin.

A member of François de la Rocque&#x27;s &quot;Parti social français&quot; (PSF), he became 1st General Commissioner for Education and Sports from August 1940 to April 1942 during Vichy France, leading the &quot;Révolution nationale&quot;″s efforts in sports policy.

Arrested by the Gestapo in November 1942, Borotra was deported to a concentration camp in Germany and then Itter Castle in North Tyrol until May 1945. He was freed from the castle after the Battle of Castle Itter, in which he played a courageous role by vaulting from the fortress and running to a nearby town to summon reinforcements.

== Grand Slam finals==
=== Singles: 10 (4 titles, 6 runners-up) ===
=== Doubles: 12 (9 titles – 3 runners-up)===
=== Mixed doubles: 5 titles ===

<text>188 Menippe is a main belt asteroid. The object has a bright surface and rocky composition. It was discovered by C. H. F. Peters on June 18, 1878, in Clinton, New York, and named after Menippe, one of the daughters of Orion in Greek mythology.

Photometric observations during 2010 showed a synodic rotation period of 11.98 ± 0.02 hours and a brightness variation of 0.28 ± 0.02 in magnitude. Because the rotation period is close to twelve hours, observations were needed at two widely separated observatories in order to build a light curve for the complete rotation.

<text>Jacques Marie Stanislas Jean Brugnon (11 May 1895 – 20 March 1978), nicknamed &quot;Toto&quot;, was a French tennis player, one of the famous &quot;Four Musketeers&quot; from France who dominated tennis in the late 1920s and early 1930s. He was born in and died in Paris.

He was primarily a doubles specialist who won 10 Grand Slam doubles titles in the French, American, Australian and British championships. Additionally he won two mixed doubles titles at Roland Garros partnering Suzanne Lenglen. He was also a fine singles player but never won a major title. He played in 20 Wimbledon Championships between 1920 and 1948 and achieved his best singles result in 1926 when he reached the semifinals, losing in a close five-set match to Howard Kinsey. He also competed at the 1920 Summer Olympics and the 1924 Summer Olympics.

Between 1921 and 1934, he played 31 times for the French Davis Cup team, mainly as a doubles player, compiling a record of 26 wins versus 11 losses. He was part of the famous Four Musketeers team that conquered the Cup in 1927 against the US, and a member of four of the five teams that defended it successfully through 1931.

Brugnon was ranked World No. 9 for 1927 by A. Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph.

The Four Musketeers were inducted simultaneously into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1976.

<text>George Reginald Cohen (22 October 1939 – 23 December 2022) was an English professional footballer who played as a right-back. He spent his entire professional career with Fulham and won the 1966 FIFA World Cup with England. He is a member of the English Football Hall of Fame and was the uncle of rugby union World Cup winner Ben Cohen.

==Playing career==
===Fulham===
Cohen was a one-club footballer, joining Fulham professionally in 1956 and remaining there until retirement through injury 13 years later in March 1969. Fulham had been relegated to the Second Division the season before he retired as a player and did not return to the top flight for 33 years. He ended his career with 459 appearances for the club, a figure surpassed by only five other players in Fulham&#x27;s history. As a full-back he also managed to score six League goals for Fulham.

===England===

Blackpool&#x27;s Jimmy Armfield played in the 1962 World Cup in Chile. In April 1964, however, Armfield won his 41st cap in a 1–0 defeat to an Alan Gilzean of Scotland goal at Hampden Park. England coach Alf Ramsey duly tried out Cohen for his international debut a month later in a 2–1 win over Uruguay. With Armfield suffering an injury – badly timed with the World Cup imminent – Cohen went on to play in 21 of the next 23 internationals. Armfield managed two more caps in preparation for the 1966 tournament after regaining his fitness, but Cohen was Ramsey&#x27;s first choice by the time the England-hosted competition started.

Ramsey&#x27;s team played without conventional wingers, allowing extra strength in midfield and relying on young, stamina-based players like Martin Peters and Alan Ball to drift from centre to flank and back again as required. When these players were occupied in more central positions, or chasing high up the flank and needing support, attacking full-backs like Cohen proved their worth.

After England&#x27;s win over Argentina in the quarter-finals, Cohen was featured in a photograph in which Ramsey prevented him from swapping shirts as customary with an opponent – Ramsey had referred to the Argentine players as &quot;animals&quot; for their fouling and gamesmanship during the match.

Three days later, one of Cohen&#x27;s overlapping runs and near-post passes contributed to Charlton&#x27;s semi-final clincher as England edged out Portugal.

As vice-captain in the final against West Germany Cohen won his 30th cap. He blocked the last-minute Lothar Emmerich free-kick that subsequently found its way across the England six-yard box for Wolfgang Weber to equalise 2–2. England won 4–2 in extra-time.

Cohen played seven of the next eight internationals. His 37th and final England appearance was a 2–0 win over Northern Ireland at Wembley on 22 November 1967. Although he never scored for England, Cohen was regarded as &quot;England&#x27;s greatest right-back&quot; due to his skilled attacking intent. He was the first of England&#x27;s 1966 XI to retire from international football.

==Coaching career==
Following his retirement, Cohen coached the Fulham youth team and the England under-23 team for a time. He also briefly managed non-league Tonbridge, who he led to victory in the Kent Senior Cup in 1974–75.

==Accolades==
Manchester United&#x27;s George Best described Cohen as &quot;the best full-back I ever played against,&quot; while Alf Ramsey called Cohen &quot;England&#x27;s greatest right-back&quot;. Cohen also bears the distinction of being the only Fulham player to have won a World Cup winner&#x27;s medal while at the Cottagers.

Cohen was awarded the MBE in 2000, along with four teammates from 1966 after a campaign from sections of the media who were surprised that the quintet had never been officially recognised for their part in England&#x27;s success. The others were Ball, Wilson, Nobby Stiles and Roger Hunt.

In October 2016, a statue of Cohen was unveiled at Craven Cottage by club chairman Shahid Khan to commemorate their former player and mark the 50th anniversary of the England World Cup win. Cohen attended the ceremony. Hammersmith &amp; Fulham Council announced that it was making the former footballer a freeman of the borough.

In a documentary on Channel 4 to find the greatest England XI, Cohen was given the right-back spot by the public, ahead of Phil Neal and Gary Neville. He was one of four veterans of the 1966 team to make it.

His attacking intent has been regarded as an encouragement for modern day full-backs as well.

==Later life==
In 2003, Cohen published &quot;George Cohen: My Autobiography&quot;. (). He was a frequent guest at functions around the country as well as at Craven Cottage raising money for cancer charities. He hosted a luncheon before every home game at Craven Cottage in the George Cohen Restaurant.

In 2010, Cohen criticized changes to the design of footballs following the intense criticism of the Adidas Jabulani used at the 2010 World Cup. He was quoted: &quot;Designers have constantly tried to create more goals by using lighter and lighter balls. It was thought they would fly further and everyone loves to see a 30-yard screamer bend into the top corner. But things have gone too far.&quot;

Cohen was also known for being vocal in his demands for a public inquiry into dementia in football, following research that suggested ex-professionals were more than three times at risk of getting the condition.

==Personal life and death==
Born in Kensington, Cohen was brought up in Fulham, where his Irish-born mother, Catherine (née Gibbs), was a stores manager at the local Lots Road power station and his father, Louis (known as Harry) Cohen, was a gas fitter. Though of Jewish heritage on his father&#x27;s side, with some of his family originally from Ukraine, he was brought up in the Church of England. He married his wife Daphne in 1962. They had two sons.

He had a history of bowel cancer, being first diagnosed with the condition in 1976. He was ultimately declared cancer-free in 1990.

His nephew Ben Cohen is an English former rugby union player and Rugby World Cup winner with England in 2003.

Cohen died on 23 December 2022, at the age of 83. He was known as one of the few &quot;greatest one-trophy wonders&quot;, winning solely a World Cup winner&#x27;s medal in his career.

<text>Arizona State Route 51 (SR 51), also known as the Piestewa Freeway, is a numbered state highway in Phoenix, Arizona. It connects Interstate 10 and Loop 202 just outside downtown Phoenix with Loop 101 on the north side of Phoenix, making it one of the area&#x27;s major freeways. It is a largely north–south route and is known for traversing the Piestewa Peak Recreation Area. The peak was named after Lori Piestewa, the first Native American woman to die in combat in the U.S. military. Prior to this time, the freeway was known as the &quot;Squaw Peak Parkway&quot;, a name considered offensive by Native Americans. Rapid growth and increased traffic demand on the east side of Metro Phoenix made the Piestewa Freeway necessary.

The freeway was proposed at least as far back as 1955. It was intended to become part of a never-constructed Interstate 510.

==Route description==
SR 51 begins at an interchange with I-10 and Loop 202 immediately east of downtown Phoenix. The route heads north from the interchange through the northern sections of Phoenix. The freeway travels through some major areas of Phoenix and past some major services such as the Phoenix Children&#x27;s Hospital, Arizona Heart Hospital and Heart Institute, and the Camelback Colonnade at 20th Street and Camelback Road. The highway then begins to climb to the top of Dreamy Draw, a mountain passage between Piestewa Peak and North Mountain, before descending into the Paradise Valley area of North Phoenix. It reaches its northern terminus at a three-way interchange with Loop 101 by Desert Ridge. The entire length of SR 51 features HOV lanes.

==History==
General Location of National System of Interstate Highways, a 1955 proposal for what would become the Interstate Highway System, included a spur freeway from what would become Interstate 10, proceeding north along a route similar to the modern Piestewa Freeway. The road was later designated I-510.
The routing of the freeway later appeared in route logs in 1968 under the designation of State Route 510 and the name Squaw Peak Freeway.

The freeway was originally named the Squaw Peak Parkway. The modern usage of the word squaw, which can be perceived as a derogatory term for Native American women, had led to guidelines from the U.S. Board on Geographic Names that the word should be phased out of the names of natural features. In 2003, Governor Janet Napolitano announced her intent to rename the peak for which the freeway was named. That same year, U.S. Army specialist and Arizona native Lori Piestewa was killed in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. According to U.S. Army records, Piestewa was the first known Native American woman to be killed on foreign soil while serving in combat for the military. As such, Governor Napolitano thought this was an appropriate new name for the peak, which by extension affected the name of the freeway.

The original of the freeway between McDowell Road and Glendale Avenue were constructed by the city of Phoenix (as the Squaw Peak Parkway) between 1986 and 1991. The first overpass to be completed was in 1986 at Osborn Road. In 1987, the bridge over the Grand Canal had been completed, as well as the overpass at McDowell Road and the southbound connector to eastbound I-10. On December 18, 1987, SR 510 was renumbered SR 51. Also completed in 1987 were the overpasses at Colter Street and Missouri Avenue that passed over the freeway. Several more overpasses were completed in 1988 including those located at Indian School Road, Highland Avenue, Camelback Road and Bethany Home Road. Also in 1988, the state established a corridor for the freeway from Glendale Avenue north to Loop 101. In 1989, the bridge over the Arizona Canal was complete, as well as the overpass at Thomas Road. The southbound Route 51 connector ramp to eastbound Loop 202 and the 20th Street overpass were completed in 1990. The city of Phoenix had the freeway completed as far north as Glendale Avenue in 1991. During much of the road&#x27;s early days in the 1990s, several decorative pots were mounted on top of the noise mitigation walls, which were a source of controversy at the time of their installation due to cost and aesthetics. One resident installed a gold toilet in protest. Some were taken down, however, during the ADOT reconstruction project between McDowell Road and Shea Boulevard in 2004.

In 1992, the southern portion was handed over to the Arizona Department of Transportation. Since then, it has been extended to Loop 101 and retrofitted with rubberized asphalt, standardized signage, an additional general purpose lane to create three lanes in each direction, and a high-occupancy vehicle lane up to Loop 101.

In 2007, construction began to widen the Piestewa Freeway between Shea Boulevard and the Loop 101 interchange to include a high occupancy vehicle lane in each direction and on ramps to Loop 101 eastbound. Work was completed in the summer of 2008.

In March 2016, a new interchange from the road&#x27;s existing terminus at Loop 101 to an intersection with Black Mountain Boulevard opened.

<doc id="775612" wikidata="Q317205" url="?curid=775612" title="Tushratta">
<text>Tushratta (Akkadian: and ) was a king of Mitanni, 1358–1335 BCE, at the end of the reign of Amenhotep III and throughout the first half the reign of Akhenaten. He was the son of Shuttarna II. Tushratta stated that he was the grandson of Artatama I. His sister Gilukhipa (Gilu-ḫepa in Hurrian) and his daughter Tadukhipa (Tadu-ḫepa in Hurrian) were married to the Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep III; Tadukhipa later married Akhenaten who took over his father&#x27;s royal harem.

He had been placed on the throne after the murder of his brother Artashumara. He was probably quite young at the time and was destined to serve as a figurehead only, but he managed to dispose of the murderer. A tablet was found in a Mitanni building at Tell Brak which stated it was witnessed &quot;in the presence of Tushratta, the king&quot; and had a seal of an earlier king Shaushtatar on the reverse, which was a common practice.

==Name==
Recorded in three distinct spellings—, , —Tushratta&#x27;s name is an Akkadianised rendition of an Indo-Aryan name meaning &quot;[one with, having] a charging chariot&quot;.

==Initial conflict with the Hittites==

At the beginning of his reign, the Hittite King Suppiluliuma I reconquered Kizzuwatna, then invaded the western part of the Euphrates valley and conquered the Amurru and Nuhašše in Hanigalbat. According to the Suppiluliuma-Shattiwaza treaty, Suppiluliuma had made a treaty with Artatama, a rival of Tushratta. Nothing is known of Artatama&#x27;s previous life or connection, if any, to the royal family. The document calls him king of the Hurrians, while Tushratta is given the title of &quot;King of Mitanni&quot;, which must have disagreed with Tushratta. Suppiluliuma started to plunder the lands of the west bank of the Euphrates river and he annexed Mount Lebanon. Tushratta threatened to raid beyond the Euphrates if even a single lamb or kid was stolen.

Suppiluliuma then recounts how the land of Isuwa on the upper Euphrates had seceded in the time of his grandfather. Attempts to conquer it failed. In the time of his father, other cities rebelled. Suppiluliuma claims to have defeated them, but the survivors fled to the territory of Isuwa that must have been part of Tushratta&#x27;s realm. A clause to return fugitives was part of many treaties made at the time, so possibly the harbouring of fugitives by Isuwa formed the pretext for the Hittite invasion. A Hittite army crossed the border, entered Isuwa and returned the fugitives (or deserters or government exiles) to Hittite rule. &quot;I freed the lands which I captured; they dwelt in their places. All the people whom I released rejoined their peoples and Hatti incorporated their territories,&quot; Suppiluliuma later boasted.

The Hittite army then marched through various districts towards the Mitanni capital of Washshukanni. Suppiluliuma claims to have plundered the district and to have brought loot, captives, cattle, sheep and horses back to Hatti. He also claims that Tushratta fled, but obviously he failed to capture the capital. While the campaign weakened Tushratta&#x27;s kingdom, he still held onto his throne.

==A second campaign==

In a second campaign, the Hittites again crossed the Euphrates and subdued Halab, Mukish, Niya, Arahati, Apina, and Qatna as well as some cities whose names have not been preserved. Charioteers are mentioned among the booty from Arahati, who were brought to Hatti together with all their possessions. While it was common practice to incorporate enemy soldiers in the army, this might point to a Hittite attempt to counter the most potent weapon of the Mitanni, the war-chariots, by building up or strengthening their own chariot forces.

Tushratta had possibly suspected Hittite intentions on his kingdom, for the Amarna letters include several tablets from Tushratta concerning the marriage of his daughter Tadukhipa with Akhenaten, explicitly to solidify an alliance with the Egyptian kingdom. However, when Suppiluliuma invaded his kingdom, the Egyptians failed to respond in time—perhaps because of the sudden death of Akhenaten, and the resulting struggle for control of the Egyptian throne.

According to a treaty later made between Suppiluliuma and Shattiwaza, a son of Tushratta, after a third devastating Hittite raid led to the fall of Carchemish, Tushratta was assassinated by a group led by one of his sons. A time of civil war followed which came to an end when Suppiluliuma placed Shattiwaza on the Mitannian throne.

==Amarna letters==

Six of the Tushratta letters, including EA 24, were subjected to Neutron Activation Analysis to match the clay composition to potential sites for Waššukanni. The results ruled out a Tell Fakhariyah location.

<text>Aak is a genre of Korean court music. It is an imported form of the Chinese court music &quot;yayue&quot;, and means &quot;elegant music&quot;. &quot;Aak&quot; was performed almost exclusively in state sacrificial rites, and in the present day it is performed in certain Confucian ceremonies.

==Background==

&quot;Aak&quot; was brought to Korea in 1116 through a large gift of 428 musical instruments as well as 572 costumes and ritual dance objects from China, a gift to Emperor Yejong of Goryeo from Emperor Huizong of Song. It remained very popular for a time (there were originally no fewer than 456 different melodies in use) before dying out. It was revived in 1430, based on a reconstruction of older melodies, and preserved in &quot;Treatise on Ceremonial Music&quot; (&quot;Aak Po&quot;), a chapter of the Sejong Annals.

&quot;Aak&quot; is one of three types of Korean court music; the other two are &quot;dangak&quot; and &quot;hyangak&quot;. &quot;Aak&quot; is similar to &quot;dangak&quot; in that both have Chinese origins. All the instruments used in &quot;aak&quot; are derived from Chinese originals, and very few of these are used in other kinds of traditional Korean music. Aak was first performed at the Royal Ancestral Shrine in the Goryeo period as ritual music of the court. The definition of &quot;aak&quot; later became narrowed to music for Confucian rituals, although &quot;aak&quot; in its broadest sense can still mean any kind of refined or elegant music and therefore can arguably encompass &quot;dangak&quot; and &quot;hyangak&quot;.

The music is now performed by members of the Kungnip Kugagwŏn National Center for Korean Traditional Performing Arts in Seoul, Korea.

==Performance==
The music is now highly specialized, and it is played only at certain ceremonies, in particular the &quot;Seokjeon Daeje&quot; held each spring and autumn at the Munmyo shrine in the ground of Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul to honour Confucius. It may also be performed at special concerts.

There are two instrumental ensembles – a &quot;terrace&quot; ensemble located on the porch of the main shrine, and a &quot;courtyard&quot; ensemble located near the main entrance in front of the main shrine building. The music performances or &quot;munmyo jeryeak&quot; may be accompanied by dances called &quot;munmyo ilmu&quot;. There are two forms of dances; one a &quot;civil&quot; dance, the other a &quot;military&quot; dance, performed by 64 dancers in an 8x8 formation.

The modern repertoire of &quot;aak&quot; consists of just two different surviving melodies. Both the two surviving pieces have 32 notes that last around 4 minutes when performed, and one of the two is performed in a number of transpositions. The music is played very slowly. Each note is drawn out for around four seconds, with the wind instruments rising in pitch at the end of the note, giving it a distinctive character.

<text>Ben Christopher Cohen, (born 14 September 1978) is an English activist and former rugby player. He began his professional career with Northampton Saints in 1996; in 2007 he moved to France to represent Brive before returning to England two years later to join Sale Sharks. Cohen was a member of the England team that won the 2003 Rugby World Cup. 

Cohen was a member of the England team that won the 2003 Rugby World Cup. His main position was winger. In May 2011, Cohen retired from professional rugby. He founded The Ben Cohen StandUp Foundation to combat homophobia and bullying.

==Early life==
Cohen was born in Northampton. He was educated at Kingsthorpe Upper School. (Kingsthorpe College as known today) This was not a rugby playing school and at age 12 he first started playing with Northampton Old Scouts RFC.

Regarding his background, Cohen has stated, &quot;My family&#x27;s not Jewish, but a few generations back they used to be. I think it was my great-grandfather that married a non-Jewish girl and broke with tradition.&quot;

==Club career==
===Northampton===
When he was 17 he joined Northampton Saints and made his first team debut against Treorchy in the 1996/97 season, following which his name was rarely left off the team sheet. Cohen had long been linked with a move away from the club. Whilst at Northampton he started in the victorious 2000 Heineken Cup Final as they defeated Munster.

===Brive===
Following his release from contract from Northampton RFC in 2007, Cohen had been linked with midlands rivals Leicester Tigers, other English and French rugby union clubs and a switch of codes to rugby league at Harlequins or Wigan. His future had remained uncertain after he failed to join a Guinness Premiership club, several games into the season. He was selected for the Barbarians, appearing in the game wearing the socks of his first club, Northampton Old Scouts RFC. It was rumoured of a move to Harlequins RL with then chairman Ian Lenagan supposedly talking to Cohen over recent months, however nothing official was ever announced and he shortly afterwards signed for Brive.

Cohen signed a deal with Brive who play in the Top 14 competition in France. Fellow 2003 World Cup-winning and Northampton Saints teammate Steve Thompson was also at the club. He signed a contract until 2009. Cohen&#x27;s move to the Limousin based club came after Cohen had stated &quot;I won&#x27;t be moving house.&quot;

===Sale Sharks===
In March 2009, Sale Sharks announced the signing of Cohen from Brive on a two-year contract. The move was called a &quot;coup&quot; by Sale&#x27;s director of rugby, Kingsley Jones. At the time Cohen believed that he could make a return to international rugby through representing Sale. Unable to participate in Sale&#x27;s pre-season warm-up matches for the 2009/10 season, Cohen made his competitive debut for Sale in September 2009 in a Guinness Premiership fixture against Exeter. The following month, Cohen scored his first try for Sale in a 36–17 defeat to Toulouse in the Heineken Cup. Cohen is one of the club&#x27;s senior players and plays a role in developing Sale&#x27;s young players. 

In September 2010 he noted that &quot;I&#x27;m coming towards the end of my career and I&#x27;ve learnt a hell of a lot over the course of my career from some of the best coaches in the world. I think you&#x27;ve got to pass some of that experience down ... You have to have that blend of experience and youth and helping the younger guys out is something that I enjoy doing anyway.&quot; In late December, Cohen picked up a knee injury during Sale&#x27;s 54–21 defeat to Leicester that side-lined him for six to eight weeks. It was announced in March that Cohen&#x27;s contract with Sale would not be renewed and he would be leaving the club at the end of the season. He commented that &quot;Sale don&#x27;t want me anymore because they&#x27;re trying to spend more money in the pack&quot;. 

Cohen, who represented Sale in over 50 matches, also said that if he could not secure a contract with a Premiership club he would consider retiring. On 15 May 2011 Cohen announced his retirement from the sport to focus on his anti-bullying campaign.

==Representative career==
At the time of his retirement, Cohen was third in the list of all time England try scorers behind Rory Underwood and Will Greenwood.

In February 2000, Cohen made his England debut against Ireland in the inaugural Six Nations Championship, scoring two tries. In June 2001, he joined the Lions tour to Australia, and although he did not figure in the Tests series he did score twice in the midweek match against New South Wales Country Cockatoos at Coffs Harbour.

During the 2002–03 season he played in all of England&#x27;s matches, scoring against the All Blacks and putting in a try-saving tackle on Ben Blair, he scored twice against the Australians at Twickenham. He also scored against Australia in June 2003 as England won by 25–14, to complete their southern hemisphere tour unbeaten. In England&#x27;s successful World Cup campaign he started in all but one of England&#x27;s matches.

In the 2004 Six Nations Cohen was named man of the match against Wales, partly for two striking tries. He was a replacement in two of England&#x27;s 2004 Autumn internationals.

Cohen initially endured a difficult time after helping England lift the World Cup, admitting that he had lost his appetite for the game and he did not feature in the 2005 Six Nations Championship. However, strong club form saw him win a try-scoring recall against Australia in November 2005. He stayed among the England setup throughout 2006 and during the Autumn internationals, but missed out on the Elite England squad for the 2007 Six Nations.

He regained a place in the squad for the summer tour of South Africa and raised the prospects for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. However, in May 2007 Cohen ruled himself out of both England&#x27;s summer tour and the World Cup, stating that he wished to spend time with his pregnant wife.

=== International tries ===

== The Ben Cohen StandUp Foundation ==
In 2011, Cohen founded The Ben Cohen StandUp Foundation, Inc., which is, according to its website, &quot;the world&#x27;s first foundation dedicated to raising awareness of the long-term, damaging effects of bullying, and funding those doing real-world work to stop it&quot;.

Following his retirement he announced plans to focus on the Foundation.

==Personal life==
In November 2000, Cohen&#x27;s father Peter Cohen, brother of English World Cup winning football player George Cohen, was fatally injured while protecting an attack victim at the Eternity nightclub in Northampton, which he managed. He died a month later from head injuries sustained in the assault. Three men were found guilty of violent conduct.

Cohen has tinnitus and is clinically deaf, with about 30 to 33 percent hearing loss in each ear. He has been involved in efforts to make rugby more accessible to the hard of hearing, especially young deaf players.

During March 2011 High and Mighty, the big and tall menswear specialist, appointed Cohen as the new face of the brand for 2011.

Cohen was married to Abby Blayney in 2003, and they had twin daughters in 2008. The couple separated in 2014, and divorced in March 2016. On 13 November 2022, Cohen and Kristina Rihanoff, with whom he had a daughter in 2016, announced their engagement.

===Status as a gay icon===
Cohen appeared on the cover of &quot;Compete Magazine&quot; July 2011 issue and the cover of &quot;Out&quot; in August 2011.

On 18 June 2013, he was named as one of the initial inductees to the National Gay and Lesbian Sports Hall of Fame newly established in Chicago, Illinois.

In 2010, Cohen donated a signed jockstrap to support GMFA, a British charity addressing gay men&#x27;s health issues, which was sold at auction at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern. He also featured on the front cover and in an interview section of GMFA&#x27;s printed FS Magazine in November 2010.

Cohen founded The Ben Cohen StandUp Foundation to combat bullying, and he has specifically noted homophobia as one of the bullying problems on the StandUp agenda.

===TV appearances===
In September 2013, Cohen took part as a contestant in the eleventh series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. He was partnered with Russian professional dancer Kristina Rihanoff. The couple were later eliminated from the competition.

In January 2016, Cohen took part as a contestant on the third series of &quot;The Jump&quot;, as a replacement for Mark-Francis Vandelli. He later won the series on 6 March 2016, beating Dean Cain.

In 2017, Cohen was a contestant on season 7, episode 8 of &quot;The Celebrity Chase&quot;.

In January 2018, he participated in &quot;And They&#x27;re Off!&quot; in aid of Sport Relief.

In December 2023, Cohen participated in ITV’s &quot;The Real Full Monty&quot; to raise awareness of cancer.

<text>Activity-based costing (ABC) is a costing method that identifies activities in an organization and assigns the cost of each activity to all products and services according to the actual consumption by each. Therefore, this model assigns more indirect costs (overhead) into direct costs compared to conventional costing.

The UK&#x27;s Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), defines ABC as an approach to the costing and monitoring of activities which involves tracing resource consumption and costing final outputs. Resources are assigned to activities, and activities to cost objects based on consumption estimates. The latter utilize cost drivers to attach activity costs to outputs.

The Institute of Cost Accountants of India says, ABC systems calculate the costs of individual activities and assign costs to cost objects such as products and services on the basis of the activities undertaken to produce each product or services. It accurately identifies sources of profit and loss.

The Institute of Cost &amp; Management Accountants of Bangladesh (ICMAB) defines activity-based costing as an accounting method which identifies the activities which a firm performs and then assigns indirect costs to cost objects.

== Objectives ==

With ABC, a company can soundly estimate the cost elements of entire products, activities and services, that may help inform a company&#x27;s decision to either:

*Identify and eliminate those products and services that are unprofitable and lower the prices of those that are overpriced (product and service portfolio aim), or
*Identify and eliminate production or service processes which are ineffective, and allocate processing concepts that lead to the very same product at a better yield (process re-engineering aim)
In a business organization, the ABC methodology assigns an organization&#x27;s resource costs through activities to the products and services provided to its customers. ABC is generally used as a tool for understanding product and customer cost and profitability based on the production or performing processes. As such, ABC has predominantly been used to support strategic decisions such as pricing, outsourcing, identification and measurement of process improvement initiatives.

==Prevalence==
Following strong initial uptake, ABC lost ground in the 1990s compared to alternative metrics, such as Kaplan&#x27;s balanced scorecard and economic value added. An independent 2008 report concluded that manually driven ABC was an inefficient use of resources: it was expensive and difficult to implement for small gains, and a poor value, and that alternative methods should be used. Other reports show the broad band covered with the ABC methodology.

However, application of an activity based recording may be applied as an addition to activity based accounting, not as a replacement of any &quot;costing&quot; model, but to transform concurrent process accounting into a more authentic approach.

=== Historical development ===
Traditionally, cost accountants had arbitrarily added a broad percentage of analysis into the indirect cost. In addition, activities include actions that are performed both by people and machine.

However, as the percentages of indirect or overhead costs rose, this technique became increasingly inaccurate, because indirect costs were not caused equally by all products. For example, one product might take more time in one expensive machine than another product—but since the amount of direct labor and materials might be the same, additional cost for use of the machine is not being recognized when the same broad &#x27;on-cost&#x27; percentage is added to all products. Consequently, when multiple products share common costs, there is a danger of one product subsidizing another.

ABC is based on George Staubus&#x27; Activity Costing and Input-Output Accounting. The concepts of ABC were developed in the manufacturing sector of the United States during the 1970s and 1980s. During this time, the &quot;Consortium for Advanced Management-International&quot;, now known simply as &quot;CAM-I&quot;, provided a formative role for studying and formalizing the principles that have become more formally known as Activity-Based Costing.

Robin Cooper and Robert S. Kaplan, proponents of the Balanced Scorecard, brought notice to these concepts in a number of articles published in &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; beginning in 1988. Cooper and Kaplan described ABC as an approach to solve the problems of traditional cost management systems. These traditional costing systems are often unable to determine accurately the actual costs of production and of the costs of related services. Consequently, managers were making decisions based on inaccurate data especially where there are multiple products.

Instead of using broad arbitrary percentages to allocate costs, ABC seeks to identify cause and effect relationships to objectively assign costs. Once costs of the activities have been identified, the cost of each activity is attributed to each product to the extent that the product uses the activity. In this way, ABC often identifies areas of high overhead costs per unit and so directs attention to finding ways to reduce the costs or to charge more for more costly products.

Activity-based costing was first clearly defined in 1987 by Robert S. Kaplan and W. Bruns as a chapter in their book &quot;Accounting and Management: A Field Study Perspective&quot;. They initially focused on manufacturing industry where increasing technology and productivity improvements have reduced the relative proportion of the direct costs of labor and materials, but have increased relative proportion of indirect costs. For example, increased automation has reduced labor, which is a direct cost, but has increased depreciation, which is an indirect cost.

Like manufacturing industries, financial institutions have diverse products and customers, which can cause cross-product, cross-customer subsidies. Since personnel expenses represent the largest single component of non-interest expense in financial institutions, these costs must also be attributed more accurately to products and customers. Activity based costing, even though originally developed for manufacturing, may even be a more useful tool for doing this.

Activity-based costing was later explained in 1999 by Peter F. Drucker in the book &quot;Management Challenges of the 21st Century&quot;. He states that traditional cost accounting focuses on what it costs to &quot;do something&quot;, for example, to cut a screw thread; activity-based costing also records the cost of &quot;not doing&quot;, such as the cost of waiting for a needed part. Activity-based costing records the costs that traditional cost accounting does not do.

The overhead costs assigned to each activity comprise an activity cost pool.

From a historical perspective the practices systematized by ABC were first demonstrated by Frederick W. Taylor in Principles of Scientific Management in 1911 (1911. Taylor, Frederick Winslow (1919) [1911]. The Principles of Scientific Management. Harper &amp; Brothers – via Internet Archive (Prelinger Library) Free access icon. LCCN 11-10339; OCLC 233134 (all editions).
The Principles of Scientific Management – via Project Gutenberg Free access icon.). Those were the basis of the famous time and motion studies (Time and motion study) that predated the later work by Walter Shewhart (Walter A. Shewhart) and W Edwards Deming (W. Edwards Deming). Kaplan&#x27;s work tied the earlier work to the modern practice of accounting.

=== Alternatives ===

Lean accounting methods have been developed in recent years to provide relevant and thorough accounting, control, and measurement systems without the complex and costly methods of manually driven ABC.

Lean accounting is primarily used within lean manufacturing. The approach has proven useful in many service industry areas including healthcare, construction, financial services, governments, and other industries.

Application of Theory of constraints (TOC) is analysed in a study showing interesting aspects of productive coexistence of TOC and ABC application. Identifying cost drivers in ABC is described as somewhat equivalent to identifying bottlenecks in TOC. However the more thorough insight into cost composition for the inspected processes justifies the study result: ABC may deliver a better structured analysis in respect to complex processes, and this is no surprise regarding the necessarily spent effort for detailed ABC reporting.

==Methodology==

Methodology of ABC focuses on cost allocation in operational management. ABC helps to segregate
* Fixed cost
* Variable cost
* Overhead cost
If achieved, the split of cost helps to identify cost drivers. Direct labour and materials are relatively easy to trace directly to products, but it is more difficult to directly allocate indirect costs to products. Where products use common resources differently, some sort of weighting is needed in the cost allocation process. The &quot;cost driver&quot; is a factor that creates or drives the cost of the activity. For example, the cost of the activity of bank tellers can be ascribed to each product by measuring how long each product&#x27;s transactions (cost driver) take at the counter and then by measuring the number of each type of transaction. For the activity of running machinery, the driver is likely to be machine operating hours, looking at labor, maintenance, and power cost during the period of machinery activity.

==Application==
ABC has proven its applicability beyond academic discussion.

ABC
*is applicable throughout company financing, costing and accounting:
*is a modeling process applicable for full scope as well as for partial views.
*helps to identify inefficient products, departments and activities.
*helps to allocate more resources on profitable products, departments and activities.
*helps to control the costs at any per-product-level level and on a departmental level.
*helps to find unnecessary costs that may be eliminated.
*helps fixing the price of a product or service with any desired analytical resolution.

A report summarizes reasons for implementing ABC as mere unspecific and mainly for case study purposes (in alphabetical order):
* Better Management
* Budgeting, performance measurement
* Calculating costs more accurately
* Ensuring product /customer profitability
* Evaluating and justifying investments in new technologies
* Improving product quality via better product and process design
* Increasing competitiveness or coping with more competition
* Management
* Managing costs
* Providing behavioral incentives by creating cost consciousness among employees
* Responding to an increase in overheads
* Responding to increased pressure from regulators
* Supporting other management innovations such as TQM and JIT systems

Beyond such selective application of the concept, ABC may be extended to accounting, hence proliferating a full scope of cost generation in departments or along product manufacturing. Such extension, however requires a degree of automatic data capture that prevents from cost increase in administering costs.

==Implementation==
According to Manivannan Senthil Velmurugan, Activity-based costing must be implemented in the following ways:

#Identify and assess ABC needs - Determine viability of ABC method within an organization.
#Training requirements - Basic training for all employees and workshop sessions for senior managers.
#Define the project scope - Evaluate mission and objectives for the project.
#Identify activities and drivers - Determine what drives what activity. 
#Create a cost and operational flow diagram – How resources and activities are related to products and services.
#Collect data – Collecting data where the diagram shows operational relationship.
#Build a software model, validate and reconcile. 
#Interpret results and prepare management reports.
#Integrate data collection and reporting.

===Public sector usage===
When ABC is reportedly used in the public administration sector, the reported studies do not provide evidence about the success of methodology beyond justification of budgeting practise and existing service management and strategies.

Usage in the US Marine Corps started in 1999.

Use of ABC by the UK Police has been mandated since the 2003-04 UK tax year as part of England and Wales&#x27; National Policing Plan, specifically the Policing Performance Assessment Framework.

== Integrating EVA and process based costing ==

Recently, Mocciaro Li Destri, Picone &amp; Minà (2012) proposed a performance and cost measurement system that integrates the economic value added (EVA) criteria with process based costing (PBC).

Authors note that activity-based costing system is introspective and focuses on a level of analysis which is too low. On the other hand, they underscore the importance to consider the cost of capital in order to bring strategy back into performance measures.

== Limitations ==

Applicability of ABC is bound to cost of required data capture. That drives the prevalence to slow processes in services and administrations, where staff time consumed per task defines a dominant portion of cost. Hence the reported application for production tasks do not appear as a favorized scenario.

===Treating fixed costs as variable ===

The potential problem with ABC, like other cost allocation approaches, is that it essentially treats fixed costs as if they were variable. This can, without proper understanding, give some people an inaccurate understanding which can then lead to poor decision making. 
For example, allocating PPE to individual products, may lead to discontinuation of products that seem unprofitable after the allocation, even if in fact their discontinuation will negatively affect the bottom line.

===Tracing costs ===

Even in ABC, some overhead costs are difficult to assign to products and customers, such as the chief executive&#x27;s salary. These costs are termed &#x27;business sustaining&#x27; and are not assigned to products and customers because there is no meaningful method. This lump of unallocated overhead costs must nevertheless be met by contributions from each of the products, but it is not as large as the overhead costs before ABC is employed.

Although some may argue that costs untraceable to activities should be &quot;arbitrarily allocated&quot; to products, it is important to realize that the only purpose of ABC is to provide information to management. Therefore, there is no reason to assign any cost in an arbitrary manner.

=== Transition to automated activity-based costing accounting ===

The prerequisite for lesser cost in performing ABC is automating the data capture with an accounting extension that leads to the desired ABC model. Known approaches for event based accounting simply show the method for automation. Any transition of a current process from one stage to the next may be detected as a relevant event. Paired events easily form the respective activity.

The state of the art approach with authentication and authorization in IETF standard RADIUS gives an easy solution for accounting all workposition based activities. That simply defines the extension of the &quot;Authentication and Authorization&quot; (AA) concept to a more advanced &quot;AA and Accounting&quot; (AAA) concept. Respective approaches for AAA get defined and staffed in the context of mobile services, when using smart phones as e.a. intelligent agents or smart agents for automated capture of accounting data .

<text>Climbing guidebooks are used by mountaineers, alpinists, ice climbers, and rock climbers to locate, grade, and navigate climbing routes on mountains, climbing crags, or bouldering areas. Modern route guidebooks include detailed information on each climbing route, including topo diagrams, route beta, protection requirements, and the ethics and style that are in place for a given climbing area (i.e can sport climbing bolts be used).

Modern climbing guidebooks are increasingly available in digital format, and even as searchable smartphone apps with extensive beta and three-dimensional diagrams of routes. Extensive online &#x27;opensource&#x27; climbing databases of routes now exist, however, the publication of &#x27;physical guidebooks&#x27; for technical climbing routes is still ongoing given the unique demands of climbing (with many having both a physical and online edition).

Climbing route guidebooks began to proliferate at the turn of the 20th century in Europe and became an important chronicle of the history and stories of climbing areas and routes (e.g. who made the first free ascent) and played an important part in promoting the sport of climbing and the attractiveness of particular areas. Certain notable guidebooks played an important role in standardizing the grading systems that are in use today.

==Content and information==

Before discussing individual routes, a climbing guidebook will outline the history and current status of climbing ethics applicable for the location including for example whether the use of bolts for sport climbing is allowed, and other local customs (e.g. use if non-clean aid climbing techniques), and the legal position around access to the location.

Guidebooks can locate a given route by verbal description (for example: &quot; &quot;start in the third left-facing corner below the large, orange roof, left of the route &quot;Something Interesting&quot;&quot;). Starting in the 1980s, a diagram style was developed, with detailed diagrams (or photographs) of the routes with the key obstacles and challenges encountered explicitly marked/overlaid, which came to be called &quot;topos&quot; (see image opposite).

Modern guidebooks include a range of standard details for each specific route, including the length of a route and its climbing grade. The description can also include varying amounts of information about how to climb the route, such as the location of the crux and any special techniques needed (i.e. bridging, laybacking, or the need for aid climbing)—when the information on &#x27;how to climb&#x27; a route is very detailed it is collectively known as &quot;beta&quot;, and can affect the style of the ascent (i.e. onsighting). The guidebook may also include the type of equipment needed and particularly for climbing protection. In a definitive guide, the route&#x27;s history (e.g. credits for first free ascents) would also be included.

In 2022, two Austrian climbers published &quot;Klimafreundlich Klettern&quot; (or &quot;Sustainable Climbing&quot;), a guidebook on the Tyrol whose climbing routes could be accessed via public transport or bicycle, thus reducing the carbon footprint of the climbers.

===Sandbagging===

The grading of modern climbing routes is increasingly concentrated around a small number of dominant systems, such as the Yosemite Decimal System and the V-scale in North America, and the French sport system and Font-scale in Europe. An aspect of climbing guidebooks is the consistency of applying these dominant grading systems with that of other climbing areas and guidebooks so that visiting climbers to an area can accurately assess the scale of a route&#x27;s challenge. Where a guidebook&#x27;s grades are materially &#x27;easier&#x27; than what they should be so that the listed grades underestimate the challenge and difficulty of the routes, it is known as &#x27;sandbagging&#x27;.

&#x27;Sandbagging&#x27; is a source of debate amongst climbers, some consider it a source of unnecessary danger to visiting climbers, while others consider &#x27;sandbagging&#x27; a reflection of local customs and historical grading that should be preserved in guidebook grades. Certain climbing areas are notable for systemic sandbagging (i.e. most of the grades in their guidebooks understate the true difficulty of their routes), with examples in North America being Yosemite, Shawangunk Ridge (the &quot;Gunks&quot;), and Eldorado Canyon. Some guidebooks will try to alert the reader on sandbagged routes (e.g. &quot;often considered sandbagged at the grade&quot;), or with more subtle wordings to avoid upsetting local climbers such as &quot;stiff at the grade&quot;.

==Publication and authorship==

Guidebooks may be compilations of selected popular or well-regarded routes (e.g. &quot;Fifty Classic Climbs of North America&quot; or &quot;Hard Rock&quot;), or exhaustive compilations of all known climbing routes in a region (e.g. the 512-page &quot;Lancashire Rock&quot; in Britain). The books may be published by national/regional mountaineering bodies (e.g. the British Mountaineering Council and Climbers&#x27; Club in Britain, the Club Alpino Italiano in Italy, or the Sierra Club in the US), by commercial publishers (e.g. Rockfax and Cicerone in Europe or Falcon Guides, Wolverine, and SuperTopo in the US), or self-published by local enthusiasts, which is how climbing areas get started. 

Regardless of publication, in many cases, the authorship of the climbing guidebook will explicitly (i.e. named on the front cover), or implicitly (listed as contributors/advisors), include well-regarded climbers who are associated with the climbing area in question. There are however notable climbing guidebook authors who are not specifically associated with an area, but whose authorship and climbing insights are equally well-regarded, examples being Britain&#x27;s Ken Wilson and America&#x27;s Steve Roper, who wrote many notable climbing guidebooks for a wide range of locations and types of rock in their respective countries. 

As a climbing area develops, new editions of the guidebook for the area will be published to capture the details of new climbing routes, to update details for existing routes, and in particular to show any change in the consensus grade of existing climbing routes. The task of re-grading existing climbs, and ensuring that the guidebook accurately and fairly reflects the assessments of respected climbers in the area, can be lengthy—and can lead to many heated debates amongst climbers, which need to be &#x27;consensus-driven&#x27;. Between editions, &#x27;new routes updates&#x27; are often held online.

===Climbing databases===
In recent years, many climbing guidebooks have been published in digital format, often for display in smartphone applications as apps. This medium offers the benefit of continuous updates, as well as rapid searching, and in some cases, GPS navigation and three dimensional diagrams. There are now several major online climbing route databases including &#x27;theCrag.com&#x27; and &#x27;MountainProject.com&#x27;, however, climbing authors note that the need for &#x27;physical guidebooks&#x27; that can be carried by climbers to (often) remote crags remains (many have physical and online editions).

==Influence and notable books==

Some of the earliest dedicated climbing guidebooks can be dated back to the mid-19th century and the Golden Age of Alpinism, with the British Alpine Club&#x27;s &quot;Peaks, Passes, and Glaciers&quot; in 1859 being arguably being one of the earliest published guidebooks dedicated to climbing. Climbing guidebooks became an important part of developing the culture of climbing, and the promotion of the activity as a sport, and they became increasingly common by the turn of the 20th century in Europe and after World War Two in North America. 

As well as promoting an area to outside climbers, guidebooks chronicle the history and stories of climbing areas and individual climbing routes, and delineate what is considered to be good and/or acceptable style in a particular area and what is not acceptable (e.g use of sport climbing bolts). There have been instances where local climbers have strongly objected to the publication of a guidebook due to differences in opinion on local climbing ethics, and/or the prospect of attracting increased visitors (e.g. at Pike&#x27;s Peak in Colorado).

Certain guidebooks had a significant impact on the standardization of climbing and the adoption of grading systems in particular. For example, Steve Roper&#x27;s 1964 big wall climbing guidebook, &quot;A Climber&#x27;s Guide to Yosemite Valley&quot;, cemented the nascent Yosemite Decimal System as the dominant grading system in North America. Similarly, John Sherman&#x27;s 1991 bouldering guidebook &quot;Hueco Tanks Climbing and Bouldering Guide&quot; introduced the V-scale to American bouldering, where it became the dominant system.

Climbing guidebooks that are considered historically notable include:

===British Isles===
*&quot;Some Gritstone Climbs&quot; (1913).
*&quot;Hard Rock&quot; (1974).

===Continental European===
* &quot;Peaks, Passes, and Glaciers. A Series of Excursions by the Members of the Alpine Club&quot; (1959).
* &quot;Alpine Club Guide&quot; (, commonly shortened to &quot;AV Führer&quot; or &quot;AVF&quot;).
* &quot;Guida dei Monti d&#x27;Italia&quot; (in English &quot;Guidebook to the Italian mountains&quot;).

===North American===
* &quot;A Climber&#x27;s Guide to the Teton Range&quot; (1956).
* &quot;A Climber&#x27;s Guide to Yosemite Valley&quot; (1964).
* &quot;Fifty Classic Climbs of North America&quot; (1979).
* &quot;Hueco Tanks Climbing and Bouldering Guide&quot; (1991).

==Libraries and collections==

Several mountaineering organizations maintain extensive libraries and collections of current and historical climbing guidebooks, including the British Mountaineering Council, who have been compiling an updated &quot;Bibliography of British and Irish Guidebooks (from 1894)&quot;. The library of the American Alpine Club is also noted for its collection of climbing guidebooks. A noted online database of information on climbing routes—including verified ascensionists—is the late Elizabeth Hawley&#x27;s, The Himalayan Database.

==Awards==

The Banff Mountain Book Festival has at times given a &#x27;Best Guidebook Award&#x27; for outstanding guidebooks.

<text>Christian Georges Cziffra (; born Cziffra Krisztián György; 5 November 192115 January 1994) was a Hungarian-French virtuoso pianist and composer. He is considered to be one of the greatest virtuoso pianists of the twentieth century. Among his teachers was Ernő Dohnányi, a pupil of István Thoman, who was a favourite pupil of Franz Liszt.

Born in Budapest, he became a French national in 1968. Cziffra is known for his recordings of works of Franz Liszt, Frédéric Chopin and Robert Schumann, and also for his technically demanding arrangements or paraphrases of several orchestral works for the piano, including Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Flight of the Bumblebee&quot; and Johann Strauss II&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Danube&quot;. Cziffra left a sizeable body of recordings.

He died in Senlis in 1994 aged 72.

==Early years==
Cziffra was born to a poor Romani family of musicians in Budapest in 1921. In his memoirs, Cziffra describes his father, a player of the cimbalom, as &quot;a cabaret artist&quot;. His parents had lived in Paris before World War I, when they were expelled as enemy aliens.

His earliest exposure to the piano came from watching his elder sister Yolande practice. She had decided she was going to learn the piano after finding a job which allowed her to save the required amount of money for buying an upright piano. Cziffra, who was weak as a child, often watched his sister practice, and mimicked her. He learned without sheet music, instead repeating and improvising over tunes sung by his parents. Later he earned money as a child improvising on popular music at a local circus.

In 1930 Cziffra began to study at the Franz Liszt Academy under the tuition of Ernő Dohnányi until 1941, when he was conscripted into the Hungarian Army. He gave numerous concerts in Hungary, Scandinavia and the Netherlands.

==Later years==

Hungary was allied with the Axis during the Second World War. Cziffra had just married his wife Soleilka, who was pregnant when he entered military training. His unit was sent to the Russian front; however he was captured by Russian partisans and held as a prisoner of war. After the war, he earned a living playing in Budapest bars and clubs, touring with a European jazz band from 1947 to 1950 and earning recognition as a superb jazz pianist and virtuoso.

After attempting to escape Hungary in 1950, Cziffra was again imprisoned and subject to hard labour in the period 1950–1953. In 1956, he successfully escaped with his wife and son to Vienna, where he was warmly received. His successful Paris debut the following year preceded his London debut at the Royal Festival Hall playing Liszt&#x27;s first piano concerto and &quot;Hungarian Fantasy&quot; which was also well received. His career continued with concerts throughout Europe and debuts at the Ravinia Festival (Grieg and Liszt concertos with Carl Schuricht) and Carnegie Hall, New York with Thomas Schippers.

Cziffra frequently performed with a large leather wristband to support the ligaments of his wrist, which were damaged after he was forced to carry 130 pounds of concrete up six flights of stairs during his two years in a labor camp.

In &quot;Cannons and Flowers&quot;, his autobiography, which has been described as &quot;a hallucinatory journey through privation, acclaim, hostility and personal tragedy&quot;, Cziffra recounts his life story up until 1977. In 1966, he founded the Festival de musique de La Chaise-Dieu in the Auvergne, whose pipe organ restoration he sponsored, and three years later he inaugurated a piano competition bearing his own name in Versailles.

In 1968 he took French citizenship and adapted his hitherto-Hungarian forenames to the French language. In 1977 he founded the Cziffra Foundation, situated in the Saint Frambourg chapel in Senlis, Oise. Cziffra bought and restored the building, with the aim of helping young musicians at the outset of their careers.

Cziffra&#x27;s son, György Cziffra Jr., was a professional conductor and participated in several concerts and recordings with his father. However, his promising career was cut short by his death in an apartment fire in 1981. Cziffra never again performed or recorded with an orchestra, and some critics have commented that the severe emotional blow affected his playing quality.

Cziffra died in Longpont-sur-Orge, Essonne, France, aged 72, from a heart attack resulting from a series of complications from lung cancer. He is buried next to his son.

<text>190 Ismene is a very large main belt asteroid. It was discovered by German-American astronomer C. H. F. Peters on September 22, 1878, in Clinton, New York, and named after Ismene, the sister of Antigone in Greek mythology.

Being a P-type asteroid, it has a very dark surface. Ismene orbits near the outer edge of the asteroid belt. It is one of the largest members of the Hilda asteroid family, which are locked in 3:2 resonance with the planet Jupiter.

<doc id="775647" wikidata="Q660629" url="?curid=775647" title="Vernon A. Walters">
<text>Vernon Anthony Walters (January 3, 1917 – February 10, 2002) was a United States Army officer and a diplomat. Most notably, he served from 1972 to 1976 as Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, from 1985 to 1989 as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations and from 1989 to 1991 as Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany during the decisive phase of German Reunification. Walters rose to the rank of lieutenant general in the U.S. Army and is a member of the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame.

==Background==
Walters was born in New York City, his father being a British immigrant and insurance salesman. From age 6 he lived in Britain and France with his family. His formal education beyond elementary school consisted only of boarding school instruction at Stonyhurst College, a Jesuit school in Lancashire, England, and he did not attend university. At the age of sixteen he left school and returned to the United States to work for his father as an insurance claims adjuster and investigator.

In later years he seemed to enjoy reflecting on the fact that he had risen high and accomplished much despite an almost total lack of formal education.

He was fluent in French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese as well as his native English. He also spoke German fluently, but, as he joked, inaccurately, and knew the basics of several other languages. His simultaneous translation of a speech by United States President Richard Nixon in France prompted French President Charles de Gaulle to say to Nixon, &quot;You gave a magnificent speech, but your interpreter was eloquent.&quot;

==Military career==
===1940s and 50s===

Walters joined the Army in 1941 and was one of the over 12,000 Ritchie Boys serving at Camp Ritchie. Soon after he was commissioned. He served in Africa and Italy during World War II. He served as a link between the commands of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force and U.S. Fifth Army, earning medals for distinguished military and intelligence achievements.

He served as an aide and interpreter for several Presidents. He was at President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s side as an interpreter in key meetings with America&#x27;s Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking Latin American allies. His language skills helped him win Truman&#x27;s confidence, and he accompanied the President to the Pacific in the early 1950s, serving as a key aide in Truman&#x27;s unsuccessful effort to reach a reconciliation with an insubordinate General Douglas MacArthur, the Commander of United Nations forces in Korea.

In Europe in the 1950s, Walters served President Dwight Eisenhower and other top US officials as a translator and aide at a series of NATO summit conferences. During this period he participated in the famous visit of Eisenhower to General Franco. He also worked in Paris at Marshall Plan headquarters and helped set up the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe. He was with Vice President Richard Nixon in 1958 when an anti-American crowd stoned their car in Caracas, Venezuela. Walters suffered facial cuts from flying glass. The Vice President escaped injury.

===1960s===
In the 1960s, Walters served as a U.S. military attaché in France, Italy, and Brazil. In 1961, he proposed an American military intervention in Italy if the Socialist Party had participated in the Government.

While serving as a military attaché in Paris from 1967 to 1972, Walters played a role in secret peace talks with North Vietnam. He arranged to smuggle National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger into France for secret meetings with a senior North Vietnamese official, and then smuggle him out again. He accomplished this by borrowing a private airplane from an old friend, French President Georges Pompidou. He had previously been chosen by Richard Nixon to be their translator/interpreter during Pompidou&#x27;s 1970 trip to the United States.

===1970s===

Nixon had favored Walters since together surviving the 1958 Caracas attack. As president, Nixon appointed Walters as deputy director for Central Intelligence (DDCI) in 1972. (Following the abbreviated incumbency of James R. Schlesinger, Walters also served as Acting DCI for two months in the summer of 1973.) During his four years as DDCI he worked closely with four successive Directors as the Agency and the nation confronted such major international developments as the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, the subsequent oil crisis, the turbulent end of the Vietnam War, the Chilean military coup against the Allende government and the Letelier assassination. According to a close colleague, Walters also averted &quot;a looming catastrophe&quot; for the CIA in connection with the Watergate scandal:

Despite numerous importunings from on high, [Walters] flatly refused to ... cast a cloak of national security over the guilty parties. At the critical moment he ... refused to involve the Agency and bluntly informed the highest levels of the executive [branch] that further insistence from that quarter would result in his immediate resignation.

Walters himself reflected on those challenging days in his 1978 autobiography &quot;Silent Missions&quot;:

I told [President Nixon&#x27;s White House counsel] that on the day I went to work at the CIA I had hung on the wall of my office a color photograph showing the view through the window of my home in Florida. When people asked me what it was, I told them [this] was what was waiting [for me] if anyone squeezed me too hard.

==Diplomatic career==

During the presidency of Jimmy Carter, Walters worked as a business consultant. The election of Ronald Reagan ended Walter&#x27;s first retirement from public life. He served as ambassador-at-large, visiting 108 countries. Reagan used prominent Catholics in his government such as Walters to brief the pope during the Cold War.
Walters was then United States Ambassador to the United Nations from 1985 to 1989 and ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany from 1989 to 1991, being responsible on behalf of the United States for the preparations of the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany. In 1986, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 1987 he visited Fiji, two weeks after Timoci Bavadra came to office. Bavadra wanted to create a nuclear-free zone in Fiji. William Bodde Jr. had said previously about this: &quot;a nuclear free zone would be unacceptable to the US given our strategic needs (...) the US must do everything possible to counter this movement&quot;. Walters spoke with Bavadra and Sitiveni Rabuka. Two weeks later Bavadra was overthrown by Rabuka.

==Retirement and death==
&quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote in 1985 that despite being unknown to the public, &quot;no one has been closer to this country&#x27;s foreign affairs since World War II&quot;. CIA director Richard Helms said &quot;I can&#x27;t think of anyone who has had a more extraordinary career. Who&#x27;s been to all the places that Dick Walters has been to?&quot; Walters said &quot;I think I tell a lot&quot; in his autobiography, but believe me, I couldn&#x27;t tell the half of it&quot;.

During the 1990s, after he had again retired from public life, Walters worked as a business consultant and was active on the lecture circuit. On November 18, 1991, he was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George H. W. Bush. He wrote another book, &quot;The Mighty and the Meek&quot; (published in 2001), which profiled famous people with whom he had worked during his life.

Walters was a bachelor, stating that he &quot;married the U.S. government a long time ago&quot;. Upon his death in 2002 he was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

==In popular culture==
Walters was portrayed by Garrick Hagon in the 2002 BBC production of Ian Curteis&#x27;s controversial &quot;The Falklands Play&quot;.

<text>Ernst Ising (; May 10, 1900 – May 11, 1998) was a German physicist, who is best remembered for the development of the Ising model. He was a professor of physics at Bradley University until his retirement in 1976.

== Life ==
Ernst Ising was born in Cologne in 1900. Ernst Ising&#x27;s parents were the merchant Gustav Ising and his wife Thekla Löwe. After school, he studied physics and mathematics at the University of Göttingen and University of Hamburg. In 1922, he began researching ferromagnetism under the guidance of Wilhelm Lenz. He earned a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Hamburg in 1924 when he published his doctoral thesis (an excerpt or a summary of his doctoral thesis was published as an article in a scientific journal in 1925 and this has led many to believe that he published his full thesis in 1925, see,). His doctoral thesis studied a problem suggested by his teacher, Wilhelm Lenz. He investigated the special case of a linear chain of magnetic moments, which are only able to take two positions, &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down,&quot; and which are coupled by interactions between nearest neighbors. Mainly through following studies by Rudolf Peierls, Hendrik Kramers, Gregory Wannier and Lars Onsager the model proved to be successful explaining phase transitions between ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states.

After earning his doctorate, Ernst Ising worked for a short time in business before becoming a teacher, in Salem, Strausberg and Crossen, among other places. In 1930, he married the economist Dr. Johanna Ehmer (February 2, 1902 – February 2, 2012; later known as Jane Ising and just barely becoming a supercentenarian). As a young German–Jewish scientist, Ising was barred from teaching and researching when Hitler came to power in 1933. In 1934, he found a position, first as a teacher and then as headmaster, at a Jewish school in Caputh near Potsdam for Jewish students who had been thrown out of public schools. Ernst and his wife Dr. Johanna Ising, née Ehmer, lived in Caputh near the famous summer residence of the Einstein family. In 1938, the school in Caputh was destroyed by the Nazis, and in 1939 the Isings fled to Luxembourg, where Ising earned money as a shepherd and railroad worker. After the German Wehrmacht occupied Luxembourg, Ernst Ising was forced to work for the army. In 1947, the Ising family emigrated to the United States. Though he became Professor of Physics at Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois, he never published again. Ising died at his home in Peoria in 1998, just one day after his 98th birthday.

==Work==

The Ising model is defined on a discrete collection of variables called &quot;spins&quot;, which can take on the value 1 or −1. The spins formula_1 interact in pairs, with energy that has one value when the two spins are the same, and a second value when the two spins are different.

The energy of the Ising model is defined to be:
:formula_2

where the sum counts each pair of spins only once. Notice that the product of spins is either +1 if the two spins are the same (&quot;aligned&quot;), or −1 if they are different (&quot;anti-aligned&quot;). J is half the difference in energy between the two possibilities. Magnetic interactions seek to align spins relative to one another. Spins become randomized when thermal energy is greater than the strength of the interaction.

For each pair, if
::formula_3 the interaction is called &quot;ferromagnetic&quot;
::formula_4 the interaction is called &quot;antiferromagnetic&quot;
::formula_5 the spins are &quot;noninteracting&quot;

A ferromagnetic interaction tends to align spins, and an antiferromagnetic tends to antialign them.

The spins can be thought of as living on a graph, where each node has exactly one spin, and each edge connects two spins with a nonzero value of J. If all the Js are equal, it is convenient to measure energy in units of J. Then a model is completely specified by the graph and the sign of J.

The &quot;antiferromagnetic one-dimensional Ising model&quot; has the energy function:
:formula_6
where i runs over all the integers. This links each pair of nearest neighbors.

In his 1924 PhD thesis, Ising solved the model for the 1D case. In one dimension, the solution admits no phase transition. On the basis of this result, he incorrectly concluded that his model does not exhibit phase transition in any dimension.

It was only in 1949 that Ising knew the importance his model attained in scientific literature, 25 years after his Ph.D. thesis. Today, each year, about 800 papers are published that use the model to address problems in such diverse fields as neural networks, protein folding, biological membranes and social behavior.

The Ising model had significance as a historical step towards recurrent neural networks. Glauber in 1963 studied the Ising model evolving in time, as a process towards equilibrium (Glauber dynamics), adding in the component of time. Shun&#x27;ichi Amari in 1972 proposed to modify the weights of an Ising model by Hebbian learning rule as a model of associative memory, adding in the component of learning. This was popularized as the Hopfield network (1982).

<text>191 Kolga is a large, dark main-belt asteroid that was discovered by German-American astronomer C. H. F. Peters on September 30, 1878, in Clinton, New York. It is named after Kólga, the daughter of Ægir in Norse mythology.

In 2009, Photometric observations of this asteroid were made at the Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The resulting light curve shows a synodic rotation period of 17.625 ± 0.004 hours with a brightness variation of 0.30 ± 0.03 in magnitude. Previous independent studies produced inconsistent results that differ from this finding.

<text>Eric Pierpoint (born November 18, 1950) is an American actor and author. He is perhaps best known for his role as George Francisco on Fox Network&#x27;s &quot;Alien Nation&quot;. He has also notably appeared on each of the first four &quot;Star Trek&quot; television spin-offs.

==Early life==
Pierpoint is the son of Patricia Adams Pierpoint and stepson of former CBS news White House correspondent Robert Pierpoint. He was born in Redlands, California, the middle of three children and lived there until age nine. His mother relocated to Washington, DC in 1959 upon marrying the elder Pierpoint, who legally adopted all three children. He graduated from Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda, Maryland and was on the wrestling, soccer, and tennis teams. He spent time accompanying his stepfather on news assignments during his teen years, often meeting high ranking US Government officials. He then attended the University of Redlands in Redlands, California, majoring in philosophy and receiving his Bachelor&#x27;s Degree. He was captain of the soccer team, and took his first drama course as a senior and began his pursuit of acting after graduation. He then attended The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he received his Master&#x27;s Degree in Fine Arts.

==Career==

===Acting===
Pierpoint&#x27;s onscreen career began in 1984, landing his first role in the film &quot;Windy City&quot;. Later that same year, he was cast in his first lead role in the short-lived television series &quot;Hot Pursuit&quot;, which was produced by Kenneth Johnson. He continued to appear in guest roles on TV series during the 1980s, including winning a recurring role on the sixth season of the popular show &quot;Fame&quot;. In 1989, he was again cast by Kenneth Johnson in another TV series, the television adaption of the 1988 film &quot;Alien Nation&quot;. Pierpoint would take over the role of Detective Samuel &quot;George&quot; Francisco, originated by Mandy Patinkin in the film, starring opposite Gary Graham as Detective Matthew Sikes. The series, though very popular among fans, was canceled after one season. Pierpoint went on to play the character in five subsequent &quot;Alien Nation&quot; TV movies from 1993 to 1997. Between 1993 and 2005, he starred in five separate guest roles on all four &quot;Star Trek&quot; series spin offs. He also continues to work regularly outside of science fiction, garnering many roles in popular films and TV shows during his career, including the 1997 film &quot;Liar, Liar&quot; and the more recent TV series &quot;Hart of Dixie&quot; and &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;.

In addition to numerous roles on television and film, Pierpoint has been active in theater, starring in many plays throughout his career. His most recent role was in The Lion In Winter for the Ensemble Theater Company.

===Writing===
In 2013, he completed his first book, a Young Adult Historical Fiction novel titled &quot;The Last Ride of Caleb O&#x27;Toole&quot;, which was published on September 3, 2013. His second novel, also historical fiction, is currently being written.

In addition to reading his work to middle school children in an educational book tour, he also teaches guest master classes in acting at various universities.

==Personal life==
Pierpoint has been active in the Big Brothers of Greater Los Angeles for a number of years. He currently resides in Topanga, California.

<text>The Treaty of Åbo or the Treaty of Turku was a peace treaty signed between the Russian Empire and Sweden in Åbo () on in the end of the Russo-Swedish War of 1741–1743.

== History ==
By the end of the war, the Imperial Russian Army had occupied most of Finland, prompting Field Marshal Trubetskoy and Chancellor Aleksey Bestuzhev to demand the application of &quot;uti possidetis&quot; principle in this case. By acquiring Finland, Russian politicians aspired to move the Swedish border considerably to the north, thus reducing the danger of Swedish attack on the Russian capital, Saint Petersburg. In the hope of gaining independence, the Finnish estates offered the ephemeral throne of their country to Duke Peter of Holsten-Gottorp, the heir apparent to the Russian Crown.

Another party at the Russian court, represented by pro-Swedish Count Jean Armand de Lestocq and Peter&#x27;s Holsteinian relatives, proposed to return Finland to the Swedes in recompense for having his uncle, Adolf Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp, elected as heir to the throne of Sweden. Empress Elizabeth of Russia lent her support to the latter faction, partly because she fondly remembered Adolf Frederick&#x27;s brother, her projected spouse who had died several months before the wedding could take place (in June 1727).

According to the resultant treaty, Sweden ceded to Russia the areas east of the Kymi River with the fortress of Olavinlinna and the towns of Lappeenranta and Hamina. Hence, the Swedish border was moved to the north in accordance with the wishes of Bestuzhev&#x27;s faction. On the other hand, the Swedes agreed to elect Adolf Frederick as the crown prince. This move exposed the country to the risk of war against Denmark-Norway, hence the Baltic Fleet sailed to Stockholm to protect the Swedish capital in case of Danish attack. The territories were incorporated into the Governorate of Vyborg.

After the treaty, Russia came to control the southern part of Karelia. However, Elizabeth guaranteed religion, properties, laws and privileges of the inhabitants of ceded territories. For example, these territories had just a few years earlier adopted (together with the rest of then-Sweden) the 1734 General Law of Sweden.

<doc id="775681" wikidata="Q2353133" url="?curid=775681" title="M-49 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-49 is a north–south state trunkline highway in the south-central portion of the US state of Michigan. It runs from the Ohio state line north to Litchfield through rural Hillsdale County. M-49 is the only Michigan highway in which the road crossing into another state has the same state highway number. M-49 continues as State Route 49 (SR 49), near the Indiana–Michigan–Ohio tripoint south of Camden. The highway dates back to 1930 and was only altered once in the 1940s. M-49 runs through Southern Michigan farmlands connecting several small towns along its path. At one point, M-49 briefly runs concurrently with US Highway 12 (US 12).

==Route description==

M-49 starts as the continuation of SR 49 into Michigan from Ohio. The highway crosses the state line south of Camden east of the tripoint with Indiana and Ohio. Running north through rural Hillsdale County, the roadway follows Edon Road through farm land. The highway follows two sweeping curves to cross Territorial Road and continue into the village of Camden. M-49 follows Main Street through town and turns northeasterly on the north side of the village on the way to Reading. Returning to a due-north course, the highway crosses a branch of the Indiana Northeastern Railroad on the south side of Reading. The Edon Road name gives way to Main Street through the city. M-49 runs north out of Reading, once again called Edon Road, through farm lands dotted with occasional trees. At Weston Road on the southeast side of Allen, the highway turns to the northeast to a junction with US 12 (Chicago Road). M-49 turns west along US 12, running concurrently into the village. M-49 resumes its northerly course at Railroad Street, separating from US 12 in the process. Outside of town, the roadway changes names to Allen Road, and through more Southern Michigan farmland, M-49 runs north to Genesee Road. The highway turns east on Genesee to Anderson Road, and then north to Litchfield. Crossing into that city, M-49 follows Chicago Street to the intersection with M-99 downtown. At that junction, M-49 terminates nearly north of the state line. No part of the highway has been listed on the National Highway System, a system of highways important to the nation&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

==History==
M-49 was added to the state highway system in 1930, running along its current routing between M-9 (now M-99) in Litchfield and the Ohio state line south of Camden. Near the state line, the highway jogged along Territorial Road for a short distance to make the connection with the continuation of SR 49. The second version of M-120 ran concurrently with M-49 on this section of Territorial Road starting in 1939. This concurrency was removed in late 1946 or early 1947 when M-49 was realigned to smooth out the corners in the roadway at M-120. The routing of M-49 has remained the same since. It is currently the only state highway that connects with a like-numbered state highway from another state. The only other highways in Michigan to share a number with a cross-border connection are components of the Interstate Highway System or the United States Numbered Highways.

<text>192 Nausikaa is a large main-belt S-type asteroid. It was discovered by Johann Palisa on February 17, 1879, at Pula, then in Austria, now in Croatia. The name derives from Nausicaä, a princess in Homer&#x27;s Odyssey.

This is an S-type asteroid around 86 km with an elliptical ratio of 1.51. The sidereal rotation period is 13.6217 hours.

Based on the lightcurve data obtained from Nausikaa, a possible satellite was reported in 1985. However, this has not been confirmed. A shape model of Nausikaa has been constructed, also based on the lightcurve data. It indicates a roughly cut, but not very elongated body. In 1998 an occultation of a star by the asteroid was observed from the United States.

In 1988 a search for satellites or dust orbiting this asteroid was performed using the UH88 telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatories, but the effort came up empty.

Nausikaa&#x27;s orbital period is 3.72 years, its distance from the Sun varying between 1.81 and 2.99 AU. The orbital eccentricity is 0.246. Nausikaa brightened to magnitude 8.3 at a quite favorable opposition on 2 September 2011, when it was 1.875 AU from the Sun and 0.866 AU from the Earth.

<text>193 Ambrosia (Symbol:) is a main belt asteroid that was discovered by the Corsican-born French astronomer J. Coggia on February 28, 1879, and named after Ambrosia, the food of the gods in Greek mythology.

In 2009, photometric observations of this asteroid were made at the Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The resulting light curve shows a synodic rotation period of 6.580 ± 0.001 hours with a brightness variation of 0.11 ± 0.02 in magnitude. This result is consistent with an independent study performed in 1996.

<text>Boiga is a large genus of rear-fanged, mildly venomous snakes, known commonly as cat-eyed snakes or simply cat snakes, in the family Colubridae. Species of the genus &quot;Boiga&quot; are native to southeast Asia, India, and Australia, but due to their extremely hardy nature and adaptability, have spread to many other suitable habitats around the world. There are 38 recognized species in the genus. According to the study done by Jiří Smíd regarding Old World cat snakes, the ancestor of the cat snake originated in Africa, from where it diversified and expanded to other countries. Despite this diversity however, the different species have very similar needs in terms of temperature and precipitation.

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was original described in a genus other than &quot;Boiga&quot;.

==Phylogeny==

DNA analysis indicates that &quot;Boiga&quot; is a sister group to &quot;Toxicodryas&quot; and &quot;Dasypeltis&quot;.

Three main clades were identified: (A) &quot;B. kraepelini&quot;; (B) seven species, &quot;B. jaspidea, B. barnesii, B. beddomei, B. ceylonensis, B. quincunciata, B. trigonata, maculata–ochracea&quot;; (C) remainder of approximately seventeen species. Within Clade C, subclades include: &quot;B. bouretti&quot;, &quot;drapezii&quot; group, &quot;cynodon&quot; group, &quot;irregularis&quot; group, &quot;B. philippina&quot;, &quot;B. nigriceps&quot;, &quot;dendrophila&quot; group.

==Description==
Cat snakes are long-bodied snakes with large heads and large eyes. They vary greatly in pattern and color. Many species have banding, but some are spotted and some are solid-colored. Colors are normally black, brown, or green with white or yellow accents.

==Behaviour==
Snakes of the genus &quot;Boiga&quot; are primarily arboreal, nocturnal snakes.

==Diet==
Snakes of the genus &quot;Boiga&quot; prey on various small species of lizards, snakes, birds, and mammals.

==Venom==
The toxicity of &quot;Boiga&quot; venom varies from species to species, but is not generally considered to be life-threatening to humans.
Since their venom does not usually harm humans, they are popular exotic pets.

==Reproduction==
&quot;Boiga&quot; species are oviparous.

==In captivity==
&quot;Boiga dendrophila&quot; is by far the most common species in captivity, but &quot;B. cyanea&quot; and &quot;B. nigriceps&quot; are also found. Nowadays, &quot;B. cynodon&quot;, &quot;B. philippina&quot; and a “Katherine morph” of &quot;B. irregularis&quot; are also circulating in the South-East Asian exotic pet trade. Others are not commonly available. They are hardy and adaptable and tend to do well in captivity after the initial period of stress from the importation process is passed. They are not bred commonly in captivity, so most specimens available are wild caught, and thus are prone to heavy internal parasite load. Adjusting them to a rodent only diet can be difficult for the inexperienced reptile keeper.

==Invasive species==
&quot;Boiga irregularis&quot; in particular has been federally banned in the United States because of its effect by accidentally being introduced to the island of Guam. Some time during the 1950s, some &quot;B. irregularis&quot; of both sexes (or possibly a single female with eggs) reached the island, possibly having hidden in imported plant pots. The island of Guam lacks native snakes or predators that can deal with snakes the size and aggressiveness of &quot;B. irregularis&quot;. As a result, it has bred unchecked as an invasive species, and has begun consuming the island&#x27;s bird life in extreme numbers. Dozens of bird species have been completely eradicated from the island, many species that were found nowhere else on earth, and the snake has reached astonishing population densities, reported to be as high as 15,000 snakes per square mile. In addition to devouring the native fauna, this species will routinely crawl into power transformers, and this typically results in both an electrocuted snake and substantial blackouts. In addition, there has been many cases in Guam where deaths are recorded due to the venomous bites from the Boiga snakes. Although they are an invasive species, there has been evidence where there is reverse- colonization of South-East Asia from the Philippines, and the Australasia from Wallacea from multiple lineages within Boiga.

<text>194 Prokne is a main-belt asteroid that was discovered by German-American astronomer C. H. F. Peters on March 21, 1879, in Clinton, New York, and named after Procne, the sister of Philomela in Greek mythology. Stellar occultations by Prokne have been observed twice, in 1984 from Italy and again in 1999 from Iowa (United States).

Observations from the W. M. Keck Observatory show the asteroid to be around 151 km across, with a size ratio of between the major and minor axes. For comparison, observations by the IRAS observatory gave a diameter of 164 km. The spectrum matches a classification of a C-type asteroid, indicating it has a primitive carbonaceous composition. Judging from radar data, the near surface solid density of the asteroid is 3.6.

Based upon a light curve that was generated from photometric observations of this asteroid at Pulkovo Observatory, it has a rotation period of hours and varies in brightness by in magnitude.

<text>Michael Dante (born Ralph Vitti, September 2, 1931) is an American actor and former professional minor league baseball player.

==Early life==
Dante was born Ralph Vitti in Stamford, Connecticut on September 2, 1931. Growing up, he would sneak into a local movie theater with his friends to watch Westerns. &quot;I grew up wanting to be the sidekick of The Lone Ranger and wanting to follow my heroes&quot;, Dante told a reporter in 2006.

He was a shortstop on the Stamford High School baseball team, then played for &quot;The Advocate All-Stars&quot; team which won a 1949 New England baseball championship. After graduating from high school, as Ralph Vitti signed a bonus contract with the Boston Braves. He used his $6,000 bonus to buy his family a four-door Buick with whitewalls.

==Career==
During spring training with the former Washington Senators, Dante took drama classes at the University of Miami. Bandleader Tommy Dorsey arranged a screen test for him at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. His first film, &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me&quot;, was released in 1956. He changed his name at the urging of studio boss Jack L. Warner, who thought &quot;Vitti&quot; would not fit well on theater marquees. Warner suggested some first names, from which the actor picked &quot;Michael&quot;. He chose the last name &quot;Dante&quot; as it had belonged to some relatives.

Dante has appeared in 30 films and 150 television shows. He spent seven years in supporting roles under contract to three major studios at once: MGM, Warner Brothers and Twentieth Century Fox. He considers his best performances the role that he played in &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; on the CBS television series &quot;Desilu Playhouse&quot;, along with his roles in the movies &quot;Westbound&quot; (1959), &quot;Seven Thieves&quot; (1960) and &quot;Winterhawk&quot; (1975).

Other film credits include &quot;Fort Dobbs&quot; (1958), &quot;Kid Galahad&quot; (1962), &quot;Operation Bikini&quot; (1963), &quot;The Naked Kiss&quot; (1964), &quot;Apache Rifles&quot; (1964), &quot;Harlow&quot; (1965), &quot;Arizona Raiders&quot; (1965), &quot;Willard&quot; (1971), &quot;That&#x27;s the Way of the World&quot; (1975), &quot;The Farmer&quot; (1977), &quot;Missile X: The Neutron Bomb Incident&quot; (1978), &quot;Beyond Evil&quot; (1980), &quot;Return from the River Kwai&quot; (1989), and &quot;Cage&quot; (1989).

Dante appeared on a few ABC/Warner Brothers series, including the Westerns &quot;Colt .45&quot;. On &quot;Maverick&quot;, he portrayed the killer Turk Mason in the 1957 episode &quot;The Third Rider&quot;, with Jack Kelly. He appeared on &quot;Bourbon Street Beat&quot;, &quot;Rescue 8&quot;, and in three episodes of CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Texan&quot;.

Dante made two guest appearances on &quot;Perry Mason&quot; starring Raymond Burr. In 1959, he played Arthur Manning in &quot;The Case of the Dangerous Dowager&quot;, and, in 1965, he played murder victim Douglas Kelland in &quot;The Case of the Feather Cloak.&quot;

He appeared on &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series in the role of &quot;Maab&quot; in the 1967 episode, &quot;Friday&#x27;s Child&quot; alongside Julie Newmar. Dante has appeared at &quot;Star Trek&quot; conventions.

In 1969, he played Clay Squires, a bitter young half-breed man, in the episode &quot;Long Night at Fort Lonely&quot; on the syndicated &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, with Robert Taylor (actor) as Ben Cotterman and June Dayton as Cotterman&#x27;s wife, Rachel and in 1972 he played a harried TV commercial director in &quot;My Three Sons&quot;. In 1974, he played Julio Tucelli in &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; episode, &quot;Dr. Wells Is Missing&quot;. Dante had recurring roles on the television serials &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

In the 1970s, Dante met John Wayne, whom he watched on screen as a child. Wayne had seen Dante in &quot;Winterhawk&quot; and asked him to co-host a charity event in Newport Beach, California. That started a friendship between the two actors, and they co-hosted other events until Wayne&#x27;s death in 1979.

Michael Dante hosted his own syndicated radio talk show, from 1995 to 2007, called &quot;On Deck&quot; and previously known as the &quot;Michael Dante Celebrity Talk Show&quot;. His program guests included Milton Berle, Tony Curtis, Ron Ely, Bryant Gumbel, Stack Pierce, Connie Stevens and Stella Stevens. An avid golfer, he once hosted the annual Michael Dante Celebrity Golf Tournament, a charitable fund-raiser held annually in Palm Springs, California, beginning in 1991.

In 2006, Dante told an interviewer that he had written a script for a sequel to &quot;Winterhawk&quot; and was trying to get funding for the projected movie.

<text>196 Philomela is a large and bright main-belt asteroid. It is an S-type asteroid. 

It was discovered by C. H. F. Peters on May 14, 1879, in Clinton, New York and named after Philomela, the woman who became a nightingale in Greek mythology.

In the late 1990s, a network of astronomers worldwide gathered light curve data that was ultimately used to derive the spin states and shape models of 10 new asteroids, including 196 Philomela. The shape model for this asteroid is described as asymmetrical and smooth, while the light curve varies by up to 0.4 in magnitude.

To date there have been two reported Philomelian stellar occultations.

<text>Jean Louis Georges Poiret (25 April 1872 - 1932) was Lieutenant-Governor of Guinea when it was a French colony. Born in Le Mans, he served twice as acting Governor of French Guinea; 9 May 1912 to 7 March 1913 and from 23 October 1915 to 12 October 1916. After that, he continued to serve as governor until 21 July 1929. Poiret was known for breaking strikes, he believed African workers did not have the right to go on strike. He believed in enforcing a rigid colonial hierarchy, he lowered pay for African workers and raised pay for European workers who were doing the same tasks, believing that this would further reinforce the power structure. Poiret did not like the évolué system, and he had almost as évolué bureaucrats in the colony fired and replaced with white French bureaucrats. This included every single employee of the railway system that was not involved exclusively with manual labor.

<text>197 Arete is an asteroid in the asteroid belt. It has a very bright surface, even so when compared to other rocky S-type asteroid.

It was discovered by J. Palisa on May 21, 1879, and named after Arete, the mother of Nausicaa in Homer&#x27;s &quot;The Odyssey&quot;. Every 18 years, this asteroid approaches within 0.04 AU of 4 Vesta. During these encounters, Vesta causes a gravitational perturbation of Arete, allowing the mass of Vesta to be directly determined.

Photometric observations during 1984 showed a rotation period of 6.54 ± 0.02 hours and a brightness variation of 0.10 ± 0.01 in magnitude. The light curve shows &quot;four well defined extrema with two asymmetric maxima&quot;.

<text>198 Ampella is a Main belt asteroid that was discovered by Alphonse Borrelly on June 13, 1879. The name seems to be the feminine form of Ampelos, a satyr and good friend of Dionysus in Greek mythology. It could also derive from the Ampelose (plural of Ampelos), a variety of hamadryad. It is an S-type asteroid.

So far Ampella has been observed occulting a star once, on November 8, 1991, from New South Wales, Australia.

This asteroid has been resolved by the W. M. Keck Observatory, resulting in a size estimate of 53 km. It is oblate in shape, with a size ratio of 1.22 between the major and minor axes. Measurements from the IRAS observatory gave a similar size estimate of 57 km. Photometric measurements made in 1993 give a rotation period of 10.38 hours.

<doc id="775808" wikidata="Q7487278" url="?curid=775808" title="Shallow donor">
<text>A shallow donor refers to a donor that contributes an electron that exhibits energy states equivalent to atomic hydrogen with an altered expected mass i.e. the long range coulomb potential of the ion-cores determines the energy levels. Essentially the electron orbits the donor ion within the semiconductor material at approximately the bohr radius. This is in contrast to deep level donors where the short range potential determines the energy levels, not the effective mass states. This contributes additional energy states that can be used for conduction.

==Overview==
Introducing impurities in a semiconductor which are used to set free additional electrons in its conduction band is called doping with donors. In a group IV semiconductor like silicon these are most often group V elements like arsenic or antimony. However, these impurities introduce new energy levels in the band gap affecting the band structure which may alter the electronic properties of the semiconductor to a great extent.

Having a shallow donor level means that these additional energy levels are not more than formula_1 (0.075 eV at room temperature) away from the lower conduction band edge. This allows us to treat the original semiconductor as unaffected in its electronic properties, with the impurity atoms only increasing the electron concentration. A limit to donor concentration in order to allow treatment as shallow donors is approximately 1019 cm−3.

Energy levels due to impurities deeper in the bandgap are called deep levels.

<doc id="775811" wikidata="Q935101" url="?curid=775811" title="U.S. Route 111">
<text>U.S. Route 111 (US 111) was a U.S. Highway that extended from Baltimore, Maryland north to the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania area. It replaced part of the Susquehanna Trail, partially signed as Pennsylvania Route 4, and was in turn replaced by Interstate 83 (I-83). Portions of its pre-freeway alignment are now Maryland Route 45 and I-83 Business (I-83 Bus.). Other old sections in Pennsylvania are now unsigned Quadrant Routes or township-maintained roads. US 111 extended north to the Pennsylvania–New York state line where U.S. Route 15 now crosses it between 1928 and 1937.

==Route description==
This route description features US 111 as it existed in 1945, with references to today&#x27;s highways to provide context.

===Maryland===

The Maryland portion of US 111 followed the entire length of what is now MD 45 from Baltimore to Maryland Line. The highway began at US 1 (North Avenue) and followed Greenmount Avenue north to 42nd Street, where the highway&#x27;s name became York Road through the rest of Baltimore and all of Baltimore County. US 111 left Baltimore and continued to Towson, where the highway entered downtown by passing under the Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad at the modern MD 45–Towsontown Boulevard intersection. In the center of the county seat, where Towson Circle now sits, the U.S. Highway intersected the southern end of the original MD 144 (Dulaney Valley Road), which is now MD 146; the western end of MD 148 (Joppa Road); and the eastern end of MD 141 (Allegany Avenue).

US 111 continued north through Lutherville, where the route met the eastern end of MD 131 (Seminary Avenue), and Timonium. In Cockeysville, the highway met the western end of MD 143 (Warren Road) and passed under the Northern Central Railway at an oblique angle, but did not intersect MD 145 (Ashland Road), which did not yet extend west of Loch Raven Reservoir. US 111 passed through Hereford, where the highway met MD 137 (Mount Carmel Road) and MD 138 (Monkton Road), before crossing Gunpowder Falls and meeting the west end of MD 142 (Wiseburg Road). The U.S. Highway passed through Parkton, where the highway followed its present course over the Northern Central Railway, which is now the Torrey C. Brown Rail Trail. US 111 entered Maryland Line at its acute intersection with MD 439 (Old York Road). The U.S. highway met the eastern end of MD 409 (Freeland Road) before crossing the Mason–Dixon Line into Pennsylvania.

===Pennsylvania===
US 111 continued north from the state line along what is now SR 3001 (Susquehanna Trail) all the way to the city limits of York. The highway intersected the Stewartstown Branch of the Northern Central Railway and became Main Street through the borough of Shrewsbury, where the highway intersected PA 851 (Forrest Avenue). US 111 continued north and met the eastern end of PA 216 (Glen Rock Road) northeast of Glen Rock. The U.S. Highway continued through Loganville and Jacobus, following Main Street through both boroughs. US 111 crossed the East Branch of Codorus Creek, ascended to the village of Leader Heights, and entered the city of York next to the York Hospital just north of where I-83 Business now intersects Susquehanna Trail. The U.S. Highway continued along what is now I-83 Business (South George Street) into downtown York. At the central square, US 111 intersected Market Street, which carried US 30, PA 24, and PA 74.

US 111 continued along North George Street concurrent with PA 24. The two highways intersected the Northern Central Railway just before they crossed Codorus Creek. Just north of the creek, US 111 and PA 24 left the city of York and passed through the borough of North York along what is both I-83 Business and SR 3065. Just after leaving the borough, US 111 and PA 24 separated at what is today the intersection of US 30 and PA 181. PA 24 continued north along North George Street while US 111 veered northwest along Arsenal Road, then north onto Susquehanna Trail, which is today designated SR 4005. The U.S. Highway followed the modern course of SR 4005 north to modern PA 238 (Church Road), then followed a township road to its intersection with PA 921 (Canal Road) just north of Little Conewago Creek at Zions View.

US 111 continued north along what is now PA 297 (renamed from PA 295 in 2018). The U.S. highway followed the modern state highway except it continued straight where the state highway curves through its interchange with I-83 at Strinestown. US 111 followed modern PA 297 to just north of Conewago Creek, where PA 297 now turns east. The U.S. Highway followed Old Trail Road, which is a township road north to the village of Newberrytown. There, US 111 had an acute intersection with PA 24 (York Haven Road), which is today PA 382. The two highways ran concurrently through Newberrytown as Old Trail Road and split west of the village, with PA 24 continuing along PA 382&#x27;s modern path on Lewisberry Road and US 111 following Old Trail Road, which is again a township road. Part of the U.S. Highway&#x27;s course south of the village of Yocumtown was removed by construction of I-83, but resumes along part of PA 392 from Fishing Creek until PA 392 turns east onto Yocumtown Road. US 111 continued along a pair of township roads on either side of the boundary of Newberry Township and Fairview Township, where the highway&#x27;s name changes to Old York Road. The township road ends at the modern intersection of PA 262 (Valley Road) and PA 177 (Wyndamere Road).

US 111 followed current PA 262 then split northeast from PA 262 (Fishing Creek Road) along present-day SR 1003. The U.S. Highway had a few tight curves as it descended a hill just south of where the road now crosses the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The highway passed to the west of the New Cumberland Defense Depot and what is today Capital City Airport and met the northern end of PA 24 (Lewisberry Road, now PA 114). US 111 passed along the edge of the village of New Market and crossed the York–Cumberland county line at Yellow Breeches Creek. The U.S. Highway followed what is now SR 2035 through the borough of New Cumberland. US 111 left New Cumberland and its name changed to Third Street on entering the borough of Lemoyne south of what is today the street&#x27;s crossing of I-83, where the U.S. Highway then crossed over the Reading Railroad. US 111 crossed over the Pennsylvania Railroad immediately before reaching its northern terminus at US 11 and US 15 (Market Street), which is today SR 1010.

==History==

===Creation and original routing===
In the preliminary 1925 plan for what were then called &quot;Interstate Highways&quot;, US 111 was assigned to the Baltimore-Harrisburg route; it met its &quot;parent&quot; - U.S. Route 11 - at Harrisburg. The changes made by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) during the next year included the creation of U.S. Route 220 from Cumberland, Maryland north to the New York state line at Lawrenceville. It did not continue into New York due to the insistence of Frederick S. Greene of that state to designate only the most major highways, &quot;thinking that [other states] wanted to justify their great amount of roads by having New York pursue the same ridiculous policy.&quot;

However, Pennsylvania soon objected (after the final plan had been approved), on the basis that the U.S. Highways did not follow the existing auto trails. In particular, the Washington-Buffalo Susquehanna Trail had four numbers in Pennsylvania - US 111 to Harrisburg, U.S. Route 11 to Northumberland, U.S. Route 120 to Williamsport, and U.S. Route 220 north to New York, as opposed to the single number - Pennsylvania Route 4 - that had been assigned in 1924. Maryland did not object; US 111 was established in Maryland in 1926, from Baltimore to the Mason-Dixon line. By April 1927, Pennsylvania and AASHO had come to an agreement: US 111 was extended north, concurrent with US 11 and US 120 to Williamsport, where it took over former US 220 to New York. (US 220 itself was rerouted to its current alignment along what had been U.S. Route 711.) The extension took effect in the summer of 1928.

===Extension to New York===
US 111 was extended beyond its northern terminus at the Mason-Dixon line to Lemoyne; it ran concurrent with US 11 to Northumberland. The combined US 11 and US 111 crossed the Susquehanna River three times: the Market Street Bridge between Wormleysburg and Harrisburg, the Clarks Ferry Bridge north of Harrisburg, and the Route 11 Bridge over the West Branch Susquehanna River at Northumberland. Between the bridges, US 11 and US 111 used the main roads along the river.

In Northumberland, US 11 and US 111 split at the intersection of Water Street (still US 11) and Duke Street (now Pennsylvania Route 147). U.S. Route 120 also passed through Northimberland on the present alignment of PA 147, running concurrent with US 111 to Williamsport. Along this section, US 111 and US 120 roughly followed the east bank of the West Branch Susquehanna River along PA 147, Pennsylvania Route 405 and a number of Quadrant Routes. However, between Milton and Muncy, the alignment was more inland, fairly close to the present Interstate 180. (Much of this road is still known as Susquehanna Trail.) At Water Street (now PA 405) in Muncy, US 111 and US 120 met U.S. Route 220, which joined the other routes the rest of the way to Williamsport. The three routes passed through Williamsport on Washington Street, Market Street, 7th Street, Hepburn Street and Park Avenue. US 120 and US 220 split at Campbell Street, heading south and then west on 4th Street, while US 111 continued along Park Avenue and High Street. From the end of High Street, US 111 used former and current alignments of U.S. Route 15 the rest of the way to New York. (By 1940, US 111 - by then US 15 - and the other routes through Williamsport had moved to Washington Boulevard, Harris Place, Hepburn Street and High Street, with the split still occurring at Campbell Street.)

===Truncation and deletion===

US 111 was truncated back to Lemoyne in 1937, and U.S. Route 15 was extended north from Lemoyne along and parallel to the former US 111 and beyond to Rochester, New York. Soon after 1940, US 15 was rerouted to roughly its present alignment, only crossing the Susquehanna River once - on the Market Street Bridge at Williamsport.

Later changes to US 111 included an extension to Front Street and Walnut Street in Wormleysburg when US 11 was moved to its present alignment, relocations to the new freeway (now I-83) south of Lemoyne, and finally a relocation from Lemoyne over the John Harris Bridge with I-83 to end at U.S. Route 22 in Lower Paxton Township. In 1961, the Pennsylvania Department of Highways announced that the route would be replaced with the I-83 and Business Loop 83. On December 1, 1962, the American Association of State Highway Officials approved the elimination of the US 111 designation. The route was deleted in April 1963, by then completely replaced by I-83, and running along I-83 except inside the Baltimore Beltway (where it used present Maryland Route 45 to the end).

==U.S. Route 111 Alternate==
U.S. Route 111 Alternate (US 111 Alt.) was an alternate route of US 111 that ran through York, Pennsylvania, while US 111 bypassed the city to the east along I-83. US 111 Alt. began at an interchange with I-83/US 111 south of York, heading north as a divided highway. The route narrowed to an undivided road and headed north into York along South George Street. At Jackson Street, US 111 Alt. split into the one-way pair of South Duke Street northbound and South George Street southbound. In the downtown area of York, the route intersected US 30/PA 24/PA 74 at the one-way pair of Market Street eastbound and Philadelphia Street westbound. Here, US 111 Alt. became concurrent with PA 24 as North Duke Street northbound and North George Street southbound. Past North Street, US 111 Alt./PA 24 continued north along two-way North George Street, crossing the Codorus Creek. The two routes headed north out of York and continued to an interchange with I-83/US 111. Here, US 111 Alt. ended while PA 24 continued to the north. US 111 Alt. was designated in the 1950s after US 111 was rerouted to bypass York to the east along I-83. The alternate route ran along the former alignment of US 111 on George Street in York, while the southern portion followed a new highway connecting I-83/US 111 to George Street. US 111 Alt. was decommissioned in the 1960s concurrent with US 111 being decommissioned in favor of I-83; the former alignment of US 111 Alt. was renumbered to I-83 Bus.

<text>200 Dynamene is a large dark main-belt asteroid that was discovered by German-American astronomer Christian Heinrich Friedrich Peters on July 27, 1879, in Clinton, New York. The name derives from Dynamene, one of the fifty Nereids in Greek mythology. Based upon its spectrum, 200 Dynamene is classified as a C-type asteroid, indicating that it probably has a primitive composition similar to the carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. The spectra of the asteroid displays evidence of aqueous alteration.

Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico in 2011 gave a light curve with a period of 37.394 ± 0.002 hours and a brightness variation of 0.10 ± 0.01 in magnitude. The curve is asymmetrical with four uneven minima and maxima.

Occultation data from October 9, 2006, using 15 chords shows the asteroid is about 130 km in diameter.

<text>Ephraim Chambers ( – 15 May 1740) was an English writer and encyclopaedist, who is primarily known for producing the &quot;Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences&quot;. Chambers&#x27; &quot;Cyclopædia&quot; is known as the original source material for the French &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; that started off as a translation of &quot;Cyclopædia.&quot;

==Biography==
Chambers was born in Milton near Kendal, Westmorland, England. Little is known of his early life but he attended Heversham Grammar School, 
then was apprenticed to a globe maker, John Senex, in London from 1714 to 1721. It was here that he developed the plan of the &quot;Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences&quot;. After beginning the &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot;, he left Senex&#x27;s service and devoted himself entirely to the encyclopedia project. He also took lodging in Gray&#x27;s Inn, where he remained for the rest of his life. Chambers died in Canonbury House in Islington and was buried in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey.

==Writing==
The first edition of the &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot; appeared by subscription in 1728 and was dedicated to George II, King of Great Britain. When he died in 1740, he left materials for a Supplement; edited by George Lewis Scott, this was published in 1753.

He also wrote for, and possibly edited, the &quot;Literary Magazine&quot; (1735–1736), which mainly published book reviews. Chambers worked on translating other works in French on perspective and chemistry from 1726 to 1727, including the &quot;Practice of Perspective&quot; from the French of Jean Dubreuil. He also worked with John Martyn to translate the &quot;History and Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris&quot; (1742).

==Legacy==
Chambers&#x27; epitaph, written by himself, was published in both the original Latin and in English in the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, volume 10, as follows (translation is the original):

&lt;poem&gt;
Multis pervulgatus
paucis notus
Qui vitam inter lucem et umbram 
Nec eruditus nec idiota 
Literis deditus transegit, sed ut homo
Qui humani nihil a se alienum putat
Vita simul et laboribus functus 
Hic requiescere voluit
EPHRAIM CHAMBERS.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In English thus:

&lt;poem&gt;
Heard of by many, 
Known to few,
Who led a Life between Fame and Obscurity
Neither abounding nor deficient in Learning
Devoted to Study, but as a Man
Who thinks himself bound to all Offices of Humanity,
Having finished his Life and Labours together, 
Here desires to rest
EPHRAIM CHAMBERS.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; of Diderot and d&#x27;Alembert owed its inception to a French translation of Chambers&#x27;s work.

<text>The Zodiac Milpro Futura Commando 470 or in short FC470 combat rubber raiding craft (CRRC), also known as the &quot;combat rubber reconnaissance craft,&quot; is a specially fabricated rubber inflatable boat often used by the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, the U.S. Army, and others. The CRRC is typically called &quot;Zodiac,&quot; referring to the boat&#x27;s manufacturer, Zodiac Milpro.

==Function==
The boat can be used for over-the-horizon transportation, inserting lightly armed raiding parties or reconnaissance teams onto beaches, piers, offshore facilities and larger vessels. The CRRC can be inflated in minutes by foot pump, compressor or CO2 tank and can be deployed from shore and a variety of vessels. Additionally, it can be launched from several types of aircraft and submarines equipped with a special lockout chamber or a Dry Deck Shelter. Its chief advantages are light weight, compact size when stowed, stealth, versatility, and the safety imparted by its super-buoyant nature (which gives it the ability to operate in relatively high seas).

A total of eight individual airtight chambers comprise the FC470. The main hull or gunwale contains five intercommunicating chambers, which are separated by internal baffles and valves. This means that a single leak will not result in loss of pressure throughout the boat, and that air can be bled between chambers to compensate for loss in one. Two additional chambers, located below the gunwale on either side and called &quot;speed skags,&quot; provide cushioning for the boat&#x27;s occupants and additional buoyancy in case of pressure loss in the hull. The final chamber is an inflatable keel tube which runs the length of the craft and gives the bottom of the hull a &quot;V&quot; shape, imparting directional stability and additional shock absorption. A wooden &quot;transom&quot; board at the stern provides a mounting point for the outboard engine(s). The deck (floor) is composed of four interlocking aluminum plates, which are fixed to the &quot;thrust board&quot; at the bow end and the transom at the stern. This rigid structure, spanning the entire internal area of the boat, prevents the hull from collapsing or &quot;taco-ing&quot; under power.

A ready-for-use craft includes an outboard engine (two in some configurations); removable aluminium deckplates or roll-up slatted decking; paddles; a bow line for securing the docked boat and a &quot;righting&quot; line which is used to flip the boat in the event of capsizing. At the bow of the boat are storage bags for equipment (foot pumps, extra lines, etc.) and a special fuel bladder, which can be of either 6- or 18-gallon capacity and which feeds the engine via a flexible hose. Deflated and rolled up, the boat and all necessary equipment can easily fit into the bed of a small pickup. Most military CRRC&#x27;s use a two-stroke engine with a pump-jet propulsor, which consists of a shrouded impeller. This design reduces the risk of serious injury to personnel in the water when compared to the traditional open propeller. It also reduces the risk of the propulsion system being seriously damaged by submerged objects.

A specially-trained coxswain sits at the stern (rear) of the boat and controls it via the tiller arm, attached to an outboard engine. The coxswain is considered the commander of the craft and is ultimately responsible for its operation, regardless of whether a senior-ranking individual is on board. Across from him sits the assistant coxswain, who relays hand signals from other boats and aids the coxswain as required. The remaining passengers (six raiders plus the two coxswains make up a full team) normally lay on and straddle the gunwale, keeping a low silhouette to help avoid detection and leaving room on the deck for weapons, equipment and (if necessary) additional fuel bladders.

Because the CRRC offers no protection to its occupants and is itself highly vulnerable to small-arms fire, operations involving it almost always take place at night and depend on the elements of stealth and surprise. To alleviate this, Zodiac introduced ArmorFlate, the world&#x27;s first inflatable bulletproof system for inflatable boats, in 2002. It can be installed on the Zodiac FC470 and inflates in 40 seconds.

<text>Chalybeate () waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral spring waters containing salts of iron.

==Name==
The word &quot;chalybeate&quot; is derived from the Latin word for steel, , which follows from the Greek word . is the singular form of or Chalybes, who were a people living on Mount Ida in north Asia Minor and who were expert in iron working.

&quot;Ferruginous&quot; () comes from the Latin word &#x27;of a rusty colour&#x27;, from &#x27;iron rust&#x27;, from &#x27;iron&#x27;.

==History==

Early in the 17th century, chalybeate water was said to have health-giving properties and many people once promoted its qualities. Dudley North, 3rd Baron North, discovered the chalybeate spring at Tunbridge Wells in 1606. His eldest son&#x27;s physician said the waters contained &quot;vitriol&quot; and the waters of Tunbridge Wells could cure:

the colic, the melancholy, and the vapours; it made the lean fat, the fat lean; it killed flat worms in the belly, loosened the clammy humours of the body, and dried the over-moist brain.

He also apparently said, in verse:

&lt;poem&gt;:These waters youth in age renew
:Strength to the weak and sickly add
:Give the pale cheek a rosy hue
:And cheerful spirits to the sad.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In 1689, a spring of ferruginous water rich in gas and tasting pleasantly was discovered by Count Lelio Piovene of Vicenza. Local residents called the water from this spring &quot;Saint Anthony&#x27;s miraculous water&quot; believing it had therapeutic properties. This spring, known today as the Recoaro Spa, is located on the outskirts of Vicenza, in northeastern Italy.

John Radcliffe (1652–1714) discusses the benefits of various mineral waters in the chapter entitled &quot;Of Chalybeat Waters&quot; in his book &quot;Dr. Radcliffe&#x27;s practical dispensatory : containing a complete body of prescriptions, fitted for all diseases, internal and external, digested under proper heads&quot;.

Anthony Relhan (c. 1715–1776), promoted the drinking of mineral waters and particularly water from the chalybeate spring in St Anne&#x27;s Well Gardens, Hove and published &quot;A Short History of Brighthelmstone; with Remarks on its Air, an Analysis of its Waters, Particularly of an uncommon Mineral one, long discovered, though but lately used&quot; in 1761. This led to a substantial increase in public interest in drinking mineral water. The town of Enfield, New Hampshire, even changed its name temporarily to Relhan because of the profound public interest in this form of therapy.

Princess Victoria, later Queen Victoria, drank the waters every day during her stay in Tunbridge Wells in 1834. She and her mother, the Princess Victoria, Duchess of Kent, would pay a visit to the spring and then stroll along the Pantiles. The water contains a significant level of dissolved mineral salts, with iron and manganese contributing to its characteristic flavour.

The Spire Southampton Private Hospital in Chalybeate Close, Southampton, UK was formerly known as The Chalybeate Hospital until 2007.

==Content of the chalybeate waters from Tunbridge Wells==

An analysis in 1967 showed it to contain (parts per million):
*Iron(II) carbonate, FeCO3 25.3
*Manganese(II) carbonate, MnCO3 4.6
*Calcium sulfate, CaSO4 60.9
*Magnesium sulfate, MgSO4 13.4
*Magnesium chloride, MgCl2 7.8
*Sodium chloride, NaCl 57.2
*Potassium chloride, KCl 7.3

==Notable chalybeate springs==

Chalybeate springs are found in:

Caledon, Western Cape, South Africa. 
This spring contains the most iron of any chalybeate globally (Darley-Hartley, 1940) and is also the hottest. The thermal waters emerge from the hillside above the small brewing town of Caledoni at 48.889 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) and feed into the Bath River.

The site was known to the Khoi people and was developed into a Victorian spa in the 1800s. The resort has been expanded and receives large numbers of visitors.

<text>The Irish ( or &quot;Na hÉireannaigh&quot;) are an ethnic group and nation native to the island of Ireland, who share a common ancestry, history and culture. There have been humans in Ireland for about 33,000 years, and it has been continually inhabited for more than 10,000 years (see Prehistoric Ireland). For most of Ireland&#x27;s recorded history, the Irish have been primarily a Gaelic people (see Gaelic Ireland). From the 9th century, small numbers of Vikings settled in Ireland, becoming the Norse-Gaels. Anglo-Normans also conquered parts of Ireland in the 12th century, while England&#x27;s 16th/17th century conquest and colonisation of Ireland brought many English and Lowland Scots to parts of the island, especially the north. Today, Ireland is made up of the Republic of Ireland (officially called Ireland) and Northern Ireland (a part of the United Kingdom). The people of Northern Ireland hold various national identities including Irish, British or some combination thereof.

The Irish have their own unique customs, language, music, dance, sports, cuisine and mythology. Although Irish (Gaeilge) was their main language in the past, today most Irish people speak English as their first language. Historically, the Irish nation was made up of kin groups or clans, and the Irish also had their own religion, law code, alphabet and style of dress.

There have been many notable Irish people throughout history. After Ireland&#x27;s conversion to Christianity, Irish missionaries and scholars exerted great influence on Western Europe, and the Irish came to be seen as a nation of &quot;saints and scholars&quot;. The 6th-century Irish monk and missionary Columbanus is regarded as one of the &quot;fathers of Europe&quot;, followed by saints Cillian and Fergal. The scientist Robert Boyle is considered the &quot;father of chemistry&quot;, and Robert Mallet one of the &quot;fathers of seismology&quot;. Irish literature has produced famous writers in both Irish- and English-language traditions, such as Eoghan Rua Ó Súilleabháin, Dáibhí Ó Bruadair, Jonathan Swift, Oscar Wilde, W. B. Yeats, Samuel Beckett, James Joyce, Máirtín Ó Cadhain, Eavan Boland, and Seamus Heaney. Notable Irish explorers include Brendan the Navigator, Sir Robert McClure, Sir Alexander Armstrong, Sir Ernest Shackleton and Tom Crean. By some accounts, the first European child born in North America had Irish descent on both sides. Many presidents of the United States have had some Irish ancestry.

The population of Ireland is about 6.9 million, but it is estimated that 50 to 80 million people around the world have Irish forebears, making the Irish diaspora one of the largest of any nation. Historically, emigration from Ireland has been the result of conflict, famine and economic issues. People of Irish descent are found mainly in English-speaking countries, especially Great Britain, the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. There are also significant numbers in Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, and The United Arab Emirates. The United States has the most people of Irish descent, while in Australia those of Irish descent are a higher percentage of the population than in any other country outside Ireland. Many Icelanders have Irish and Scottish Gaelic ancestors due to transportation there as slaves by the Vikings during their settlement of Iceland.

==Origins and antecedents==
===Prehistoric and legendary ancestors===

During the past 33,000 years, Ireland has witnessed different peoples arrive on its shores.

Pytheas made a voyage of exploration to northwestern Europe in about 325 BC, but his account of it, known widely in Antiquity, has not survived and is now known only through the writings of others. On this voyage, he circumnavigated and visited a considerable part of modern-day Great Britain and Ireland. He was the first known scientific visitor to see and describe the Celtic and Germanic tribes.

The terms &quot;Irish&quot; and &quot;Ireland&quot; are probably derived from the goddess Ériu. A variety of tribal groups and dynasties have inhabited the island, including the Airgialla, Fir Ol nEchmacht, Delbhna, the mythical Fir Bolg, Érainn, Eóganachta, Mairtine, Conmaicne, Soghain, and Ulaid. In the cases of the Conmaicne, Delbhna, and perhaps Érainn, it can be demonstrated that the tribe took their name from their chief deity, or in the case of the Ciannachta, Eóganachta, and possibly the Soghain, a deified ancestor. This practice is paralleled by the Anglo-Saxon dynasties.

One legend states that the Irish were descended from the Milesians, who supposedly conquered Ireland around 1000 BC or later.

Haplogroup R1b is the dominant haplogroup among Irish males, reaching a frequency of almost 80%. R-L21 is the dominant subclade within Ireland, reaching a frequency of 65%. This subclade is also dominant in Scotland, Wales and Brittany and descends from a common ancestor who lived in about 2,500 BC.

According to 2009 studies by Bramanti et al. and Malmström et al. on mtDNA, related western European populations appear to be largely from the Neolithic and not Paleolithic era, as previously thought. There was discontinuity between Mesolithic central Europe and modern European populations mainly due to an extremely high frequency of haplogroup U (particularly U5) types in Mesolithic central European sites.

The existence of an especially strong genetic association between the Irish and the Basques was first challenged in 2005, and in 2007 scientists began looking at the possibility of a more recent Mesolithic- or even Neolithic-era entrance of R1b into Europe. A new study published in 2010 by Balaresque et al. implies either a Mesolithic- or Neolithic- (not Paleolithic-) era entrance of R1b into Europe. Unlike previous studies, large sections of autosomal DNA were analyzed in addition to paternal Y-DNA markers. They detected an autosomal component present in modern Europeans which was not present in Neolithic or Mesolithic Europeans, and which would have been introduced into Europe with paternal lineages R1b and R1a, as well as the Indo-European languages. This genetic component, labelled as &quot;Yamnaya&quot; in the studies, then mixed to varying degrees with earlier Mesolithic hunter-gatherer and Neolithic farmer populations already existing in western Europe.
A more recent whole genome analysis of Neolithic and Bronze Age skeletal remains from Ireland suggested that the original Neolithic farming population was most similar to present-day Sardinians, while the three Bronze Age remains had a large genetic component from the Pontic-Caspian steppe. Modern Irish are the population most genetically similar to the Bronze Age remains, followed by Scottish and Welsh, and share more DNA with the three Bronze Age men from Rathlin Island than with the earlier Ballynahatty Neolithic woman.

A 2017 genetic study done on the Irish shows that there is fine-scale population structure between different regional populations of the island, with the largest difference between native &#x27;Gaelic&#x27; Irish populations and those of Ulster Protestants known to have recent, partial British ancestry. They were also found to have most similarity to two main ancestral sources: a &#x27;French&#x27; component (mostly northwestern French) which reached highest levels in the Irish and other Celtic populations (Welsh, Highland Scots and Cornish) and showing a possible link to the Bretons; and a &#x27;West Norwegian&#x27; component related to the Viking era.

 As of 2016, 10,100 Irish nationals of African descent referred to themselves as &quot;Black Irish&quot; in the national census. The term &quot;Black Irish&quot; is sometimes used outside Ireland to refer to Irish people with black hair and dark eyes. One theory is that they are descendants of Spanish traders or of the few sailors of the Spanish Armada who were shipwrecked on Ireland&#x27;s west coast, but there is little evidence for this.

=== Irish Travellers ===
Irish Travellers are an ethnic people of Ireland. A DNA study found they originally descended from the general Irish population, however, they are now very distinct from it. The emergence of Travellers as a distinct group occurred long before the Great Famine, a genetic analysis shows. The research suggests that Traveller origins may in fact date as far back as 420 years to 1597. The Plantation of Ulster began around that time, with native Irish displaced from the land, perhaps to form a nomadic population.

==History==

===Early expansion and the coming of Christianity===

One Roman historian records that the Irish people were divided into &quot;sixteen different nations&quot; or tribes. Traditional histories assert that the Romans never attempted to conquer Ireland, although it may have been considered. The Irish were not, however, cut off from Europe; they frequently raided the Roman territories, and also maintained trade links.

Among the most famous people of ancient Irish history are the High Kings of Ireland, such as Cormac mac Airt and Niall of the Nine Hostages, and the semi-legendary Fianna. The 20th-century writer Seumas MacManus wrote that even if the Fianna and the Fenian Cycle were purely fictional, they would still be representative of the character of the Irish people:

The introduction of Christianity to the Irish people during the 5th century brought a radical change to the Irish people&#x27;s foreign relations. The only military raid abroad recorded after that century is a presumed invasion of Wales, which according to a Welsh manuscript may have taken place around the 7th century. In the words of Seumas MacManus:
Following the conversion of the Irish to Christianity, Irish secular laws and social institutions remained in place.

===Migration and invasion in the Middle Ages===

The &#x27;traditional&#x27; view is that, in the 4th or 5th century, Goidelic language and Gaelic culture was brought to Scotland by settlers from Ireland, who founded the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata on Scotland&#x27;s west coast. This is based mostly on medieval writings from the 9th and 10th centuries. The archaeologist Ewan Campbell argues against this view, saying that there is no archaeological or placename evidence for a migration or a takeover by a small group of elites. He states that &quot;the Irish migration hypothesis seems to be a classic case of long-held historical beliefs influencing not only the interpretation of documentary sources themselves but the subsequent invasion paradigm being accepted uncritically in the related disciplines of archaeology and linguistics.&quot; Dál Riata and the territory of the neighbouring Picts merged to form the Kingdom of Alba, and Goidelic language and Gaelic culture became dominant there. The country came to be called &quot;Scotland&quot;, after the Roman name for the Gaels: &quot;Scoti&quot;. The Isle of Man and the Manx people also came under massive Gaelic influence in their history.

Irish missionaries such as Saint Columba brought Christianity to Pictish Scotland. The Irishmen of this time were also &quot;aware of the cultural unity of Europe&quot;, and it was the 6th-century Irish monk Columbanus who is regarded as &quot;one of the fathers of Europe&quot;. Another Irish saint, Aidan of Lindisfarne, has been proposed as a possible patron saint of the United Kingdom, while Saints Kilian and Vergilius became the patron saints of Würzburg in Germany and Salzburg in Austria, respectively.
Irish missionaries founded monasteries outside Ireland, such as Iona Abbey, the Abbey of St Gall in Switzerland, and Bobbio Abbey in Italy.

Common to both the monastic and the secular bardic schools were Irish and Latin. With Latin, the early Irish scholars &quot;show almost a like familiarity that they do with their own Gaelic&quot;. There is evidence also that Hebrew and Greek were studied, the latter probably being taught at Iona.

Since the time of Charlemagne, Irish scholars had a considerable presence in the Frankish court, where they were renowned for their learning. The most significant Irish intellectual of the early monastic period was the 9th century Johannes Scotus Eriugena, an outstanding philosopher in terms of originality. He was the earliest of the founders of scholasticism, the dominant school of medieval philosophy. He had considerable familiarity with the Greek language, and translated many works into Latin, affording access to the Cappadocian Fathers and the Greek theological tradition, previously almost unknown in the Latin West.

The influx of Viking raiders and traders in the 9th and 10th centuries resulted in the founding of many of Ireland&#x27;s most important towns, including Cork, Dublin, Limerick, and Waterford (earlier Gaelic settlements on these sites did not approach the urban nature of the subsequent Norse trading ports). The Vikings left little impact on Ireland other than towns and certain words added to the Irish language, but many Irish taken as slaves inter-married with the Scandinavians, hence forming a close link with the Icelandic people. In the Icelandic &quot;Laxdœla saga&quot;, for example, &quot;even slaves are highborn, descended from the kings of Ireland.&quot; The first name of Njáll Þorgeirsson, the chief protagonist of &quot;Njáls saga&quot;, is a variation of the Irish name Neil. According to &quot;Eirik the Red&#x27;s Saga&quot;, the first European couple to have a child born in North America was descended from the Viking Queen of Dublin, Aud the Deep-minded, and a Gaelic slave brought to Iceland.

The arrival of the Anglo-Normans brought also the Welsh, Flemish, Anglo-Saxons, and Bretons. Most of these were assimilated into Irish culture and polity by the 15th century, with the exception of some of the walled towns and the Pale areas. The Late Middle Ages also saw the settlement of Scottish gallowglass families of mixed Gaelic-Norse and Pict descent, mainly in the north; due to similarities of language and culture they too were assimilated.

===Surnames===

The Irish were among the first people in Europe to use surnames as we know them today. It is very common for people of Gaelic origin to have the English versions of their surnames beginning with &#x27;Ó&#x27; or &#x27;Mac&#x27; (Over time however many have been shortened to &#x27;O&#x27; or Mc). &#x27;O&#x27; comes from the Irish Ó which in turn came from Ua, which means &quot;grandson&quot;, or &quot;descendant&quot; of a named person. Mac is the Irish for son.

Names that begin with &quot;O&#x27;&quot; include: Ó Bánion (O&#x27;Banion), Ó Briain (O&#x27;Brien), Ó Ceallaigh (O&#x27;Kelly), Ó Conchobhair (O&#x27;Connor, O&#x27;Conor), Ó Chonaill (O&#x27;Connell), O&#x27;Coiligh (Cox), Ó Cuilinn (Cullen), Ó Domhnaill (O&#x27;Donnell), Ó Drisceoil (O&#x27;Driscoll), Ó hAnnracháin, (Hanrahan), Ó Máille (O&#x27;Malley), Ó Mathghamhna (O&#x27;Mahony), Ó Néill (O&#x27;Neill), Ó Sé (O&#x27;Shea), Ó Súilleabháin (O&#x27;Sullivan), Ó Caiside/Ó Casaide (Cassidy), Ó Brádaigh/Mac Bradaigh (Brady) and Ó Tuathail (O&#x27;Toole).

Names that begin with Mac or Mc include: Mac Cárthaigh (McCarthy), Mac Diarmada (McDermott), Mac Domhnaill (McDonnell), and Mac Mathghamhna (McMahon) Mac(g) Uidhir (Maguire), Mac Dhonnchadha (McDonagh), Mac Conmara (MacNamara), Mac Craith (McGrath), Mac Aodha (McGee), Mac Aonghuis (McGuinness), Mac Cana (McCann), Mac Lochlainn (McLaughlin) and Mac Conallaidh (McNally). Mac is commonly anglicised Mc. However, &quot;Mac&quot; and &quot;Mc&quot; are not mutually exclusive, so, for example, both &quot;MacCarthy&quot; and &quot;McCarthy&quot; are used. Both &quot;Mac&quot; and &quot;Ó&#x27;&quot; prefixes are both Irish in origin, Anglicized Prefix Mc is far more common in Ireland than Scotland with 2/3 of all Mc Surnames being Irish in origin However, &quot;Mac&quot; is more common in Scotland and Ulster than in the rest of Ireland; furthermore, &quot;Ó&quot; surnames are less common in Scotland having been brought to Scotland from Ireland. The proper surname for a woman in Irish uses the feminine prefix nic (meaning daughter) in place of mac. Thus a boy may be called Mac Domhnaill whereas his sister would be called Nic Dhomhnaill or Ní Dhomhnaill – the insertion of &#x27;h&#x27; follows the female prefix in the case of most consonants (bar H, L, N, R, &amp; T).

A son has the same surname as his father. A female&#x27;s surname replaces Ó with Ní (reduced from Iníon Uí – &quot;daughter of the grandson of&quot;) and Mac with Nic (reduced from Iníon Mhic – &quot;daughter of the son of&quot;); in both cases the following name undergoes lenition. However, if the second part of the surname begins with the letter C or G, it is not lenited after Nic. Thus the daughter of a man named Ó Maolagáin has the surname &quot;Ní Mhaolagáin&quot; and the daughter of a man named Mac Gearailt has the surname &quot;Nic Gearailt&quot;. When anglicised, the name can remain O&#x27; or Mac, regardless of gender.

There are a number of Irish surnames derived from Norse personal names, including Mac Suibhne (Sweeney) from Swein and McAuliffe from &quot;Olaf&quot;. The name Cotter, local to County Cork, derives from the Norse personal name Ottir. The name Reynolds is an Anglicization of the Irish Mac Raghnaill, itself originating from the Norse names Randal or Reginald. Though these names were of Viking derivation some of the families who bear them appear to have had Gaelic origins.

&quot;Fitz&quot; is an old Norman French variant of the Old French word (variant spellings , , , etc.), used by the Normans, meaning &quot;son&quot;. The Normans themselves were descendants of Vikings, who had settled in Normandy and thoroughly adopted the French language and culture. With the exception of the Gaelic-Irish Fitzpatrick (Mac Giolla Phádraig) surname, all names that begin with Fitz – including FitzGerald (Mac Gearailt), Fitzsimons (Mac Síomóin/Mac an Ridire) and FitzHenry (Mac Anraí) – are descended from the initial Norman settlers. A small number of Irish families of Goidelic origin came to use a Norman form of their original surname—so that Mac Giolla Phádraig became Fitzpatrick—while some assimilated so well that the Irish name was dropped in favour of a new, Hiberno-Norman form. Another common Irish surname of Norman Irish origin is the &#x27;de&#x27; habitational prefix, meaning &#x27;of&#x27; and originally signifying prestige and land ownership. Examples include de Búrca (Burke), de Brún, de Barra (Barry), de Stac (Stack), de Tiúit, de Faoite (White), de Londras (Landers), de Paor (Power). The Irish surname &quot;Walsh&quot; (in Irish ) was routinely given to settlers of Welsh origin, who had come during and after the Norman invasion. The Joyce and Griffin/Griffith (Gruffydd) families are also of Welsh origin.

The Mac Lochlainn, Ó Maol Seachlainn, Ó Maol Seachnaill, Ó Conchobhair, Mac Loughlin and Mac Diarmada families, all distinct, are now all subsumed together as MacLoughlin. The full surname usually indicated which family was in question, something that has been diminished with the loss of prefixes such as Ó and Mac. Different branches of a family with the same surname sometimes used distinguishing epithets, which sometimes became surnames in their own right. Hence the chief of the clan Ó Cearnaigh (Kearney) was referred to as An Sionnach (Fox), which his descendants use to this day. Similar surnames are often found in Scotland for many reasons, such as the use of a common language and mass Irish migration to Scotland in the late 19th and early to mid-20th centuries.

===Late Medieval and Tudor Ireland===


The Irish people of the Late Middle Ages were active as traders on the European continent. They were distinguished from the English (who only used their own language or French) in that they only used Latin abroad—a language &quot;spoken by all educated people throughout Gaeldom&quot;. According to the writer Seumas MacManus, the explorer Christopher Columbus visited Ireland to gather information about the lands to the west, a number of Irish names are recorded on Columbus&#x27; crew roster preserved in the archives of Madrid and it was an Irishman named Patrick Maguire who was the first to set foot in the Americas in 1492; however, according to Morison and Miss Gould, who made a detailed study of the crew list of 1492, no Irish or English sailors were involved in the voyage.

An English report of 1515 states that the Irish people were divided into over sixty Gaelic lordships and thirty Anglo-Irish lordships. The English term for these lordships was &quot;nation&quot; or &quot;country&quot;. The Irish term &quot;oireacht&quot; referred to both the territory and the people ruled by the lord. Literally, it meant an &quot;assembly&quot;, where the Brehons would hold their courts upon hills to arbitrate the matters of the lordship. Indeed, the Tudor lawyer John Davies described the Irish people with respect to their laws:

Another English commentator records that the assemblies were attended by &quot;all the scum of the country&quot;—the labouring population as well as the landowners. While the distinction between &quot;free&quot; and &quot;unfree&quot; elements of the Irish people was unreal in legal terms, it was a social and economic reality. Social mobility was usually downwards, due to social and economic pressures. The ruling clan&#x27;s &quot;expansion from the top downwards&quot; was constantly displacing commoners and forcing them into the margins of society.

As a clan-based society, genealogy was all important. Ireland &#x27;was justly styled a &quot;Nation of Annalists&quot;&#x27;. The various branches of Irish learning—including law, poetry, history and genealogy, and medicine—were associated with hereditary learned families. The poetic families included the Uí Dhálaigh (Daly) and the MacGrath. Irish physicians, such as the O&#x27;Briens in Munster or the MacCailim Mor in the Western Isles, were renowned in the courts of England, Spain, Portugal and the Low Countries. Learning was not exclusive to the hereditary learned families, however; one such example is Cathal Mac Manus, the 15th century diocesan priest who wrote the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot;. Other learned families included the Mic Aodhagáin and Clann Fhir Bhisigh. It was this latter family which produced Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh, the 17th century genealogist and compiler of the &quot;Leabhar na nGenealach&quot;. (see also Irish medical families).

===Plantations===

The 16th century Age of Discovery brought an interest among the English to colonize Ireland with the reign of the Tudors. King Henry IV established surrender and regrants to the Irish, but it was not until the Catholic queen Mary I of England who started the first plantations in Ireland in 1550, this would become the model for English colonization moving forward in Ireland and would later form the British imperial model The 1550 plantation counties were known as Philipstown (now Daingean) and Maryborough (now Portlaoise) named by the English planters at the time. A group of explorers, known as the West Country Men, were active in Ireland at around this time.

The Enterprise of Ulster which pitted Shane O&#x27;Neill (Irish chieftain) against Queen Elizabeth I was a total failure This was followed by the somewhat successful first British-English colony the Munster planations which had a population of 4,000 in 1580 and in the 1620s may have grown to 16,000

After the defeat of the Irish in Ulster in the Nine Years&#x27; War (Ireland); which was not exclusively confined to Ulster. The English would try again to colonize Ireland fearing another rebellion in Ulster, using previous colonial Irish endeavours as their influence. King James would succeed Queen Elizabeth the I, because King James I was previously King James VI of Scotland, he would plant both English and Scottish in the plantations of Ulster drawing upon the Munster Plantations, this proved to be the most successful they were settled in what&#x27;s mostly Now Northern Ireland. The Plantations of Ireland introduced Tudor English settlers to Ireland, while The Plantation of Ulster in the 17th century introduced a great number of Scottish and to a lesser extent English as well as French Huguenots as colonists. All previous endeavours were solely an English venture. The Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell (1653–1658) after the defeat of the Irish rebels would also plant New English in Ireland, known as the Protestant ascendency.

===Enlightenment Ireland===

There have been notable Irish scientists. The Anglo-Irish scientist Robert Boyle (1627–1691) is considered the father of chemistry for his book &quot;The Sceptical Chymist&quot;, written in 1661. Boyle was an atomist, and is best known for Boyle&#x27;s Law. The hydrographer Rear Admiral Francis Beaufort (1774–1857), an Irish naval officer of Huguenot descent, was the creator of the Beaufort scale for indicating wind force. George Boole (1815–1864), the mathematician who invented Boolean algebra, spent the latter part of his life in Cork. The 19th century physicist George Stoney introduced the idea and the name of the electron. He was the uncle of another notable physicist, George FitzGerald.
The Irish bardic system, along with the Gaelic culture and learned classes, were upset by the plantations and went into decline. Among the last of the true bardic poets were Brian Mac Giolla Phádraig (c. 1580–1652) and Dáibhí Ó Bruadair (1625–1698). The Irish poets of the late 17th and 18th centuries moved toward more modern dialects. Among the most prominent of this period were Séamas Dall Mac Cuarta, Peadar Ó Doirnín, Art Mac Cumhaigh, Cathal Buí Mac Giolla Ghunna, and Seán Clárach Mac Domhnaill. Irish Catholics continued to receive an education in secret &quot;hedgeschools&quot;, in spite of the Penal laws. A knowledge of Latin was common among the poor Irish mountaineers in the 17th century, who spoke it on special occasions, while cattle were bought and sold in Greek in the mountain market-places of County Kerry.

For a comparatively small population of about 6 million people, Ireland made an enormous contribution to literature. Irish literature encompasses the Irish and English languages. Notable Irish writers, playwrights and poets include Jonathan Swift, Laurence Sterne, Oscar Wilde, Oliver Goldsmith, James Joyce, George Bernard Shaw, Samuel Beckett, Bram Stoker, W.B. Yeats, Séamus Heaney and Brendan Behan.

===19th century===
====The Great Famine / An Górta Mór====
Known as &quot;An Górta Mór&quot; (&quot;The Great Hunger&quot;) in the Irish language, during the famine millions of Irish people died and emigrated during Ireland&#x27;s largest famine. The famine lasted from 1845 - 1849, and it was worst in the year 1847, which became known as Black &#x27;47. The famine occurred due to the extremely impoverished Irish population&#x27;s staple food the potato being infected with Blight, and the British administration appropriating all other crops and livestock to feed her armies abroad. This meant the crop failed and turned black. Starving people who tried to eat them would only vomit it back up soon afterwards. Soup kitchens were set up but made little difference. The British government produced little aid, only sending raw corn known as &#x27;Peel&#x27;s Brimstone&#x27; to Ireland. It was known by this name after the British Prime Minister at the time, Robert Peel, and the fact that many Irish weren&#x27;t aware of how to cook corn. This led to little or no improvement. The British government set up workhouses which were disease-ridden (with cholera, TB and others) but they also failed as little food was available and many died on arrival as they were overworked. Some British political figures at the time saw the famine as a purge from God to exterminate the majority of the native Irish population.
Irish people emigrated to escape the famine journeying predominantly to the east coast of the United States, especially Boston and New York, as well as Liverpool in England, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Many records show the majority of Irish emigrants to Australia were in fact prisoners. A substantial proportion of these committed crimes in hopes of being extradited to Australia, favouring it to the persecution and hardships they endured in their homeland. Emigrants travelled on &#x27;Coffin Ships&#x27;, which got their name from the often high mortality rates on board. Many died of disease or starved. Conditions on board were abysmal - tickets were expensive so stowaways were common, and little food stuff was given to passengers who were simply viewed as cargo in the eyes of the ship workers. Notable coffin ships include the Jeanie Johnston and the Dunbrody.

There are statues and memorials in Dublin, New York and other cities in memory of the famine. The Fields of Athenry is a late-20th century song about the Great Famine and is often sung at national team sporting events in memory and homage to those affected by the famine.

The Great Famine is one of the biggest events in Irish history and is ingrained in the identity on the nation to this day. It was a major factor in Irish nationalism and Ireland&#x27;s fight for independence during subsequent rebellions, as many Irish people felt a stronger need to regain independence from British rule after the famine.

===20th century===

After the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921) the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed which led to the formation of the independent Irish Free State (now the independent Republic of Ireland) which consisted of 26 of Ireland&#x27;s 32 traditional counties. The remaining six counties in the northeast remained in the United Kingdom as Northern Ireland. It is predominantly religion, historical, and political differences that divide the two communities of (nationalism and unionism). Four polls taken between 1989 and 1994 revealed that when asked to state their national identity, over 79% of Northern Irish Protestants replied &quot;British&quot; or &quot;Ulster&quot; with 3% or less replying &quot;Irish&quot;, while over 60% of Northern Irish Catholics replied &quot;Irish&quot; with 13% or less replying &quot;British&quot; or &quot;Ulster&quot;. A survey in 1999 showed that 72% of Northern Irish Protestants considered themselves &quot;British&quot; and 2% &quot;Irish&quot;, with 68% of Northern Irish Catholics considering themselves &quot;Irish&quot; and 9% &quot;British&quot;. The survey also revealed that 78% of Protestants and 48% of all respondents felt &quot;Strongly British&quot;, while 77% of Catholics and 35% of all respondents felt &quot;Strongly Irish&quot;. 51% of Protestants and 33% of all respondents felt &quot;Not at all Irish&quot;, while 62% of Catholics and 28% of all respondents felt &quot;Not at all British&quot;.

==Recent history==
===Religion in Ireland===

In the Republic of Ireland, as of 2022, 3.5 million people or about 69.1% of the population are Catholic. In Northern Ireland, about 41.6% of the population are Protestant (19.1% Presbyterian, 13.7% Church of Ireland, 3.0% Methodist, 5.8% other Christian) whilst approximately 40.8% are Catholic as of 2011.
The 31st International Eucharistic Congress was held in Dublin in 1932, that year being the supposed 1,500th anniversary of Saint Patrick&#x27;s arrival. Ireland was then home to 3,171,697 Catholics, about a third of whom attended the Congress. It was noted in &quot;Time Magazine&quot; that the Congress&#x27; special theme would be &quot;the Faith of the Irish&quot;. The massive crowds were repeated at Pope John Paul II&#x27;s Mass in Phoenix Park in 1979. The idea of faith has affected the question of Irish identity even in relatively recent times, apparently more so for Catholics and Irish-Americans. Today the majority of Irish people in the Republic of Ireland identify as Catholic, although church attendance has significantly dropped in recent decades. In Northern Ireland, where almost 50% of the population is Protestant, there has also been a decline in attendances.

This has been a matter of concern over the last century for the followers of nationalist ideologists such as DP Moran.

===Irish identity===
Thomas Davis, a prominent Protestant Irish nationalist and founder of the Irish nationalist Young Ireland movement, identified the Irish as a Celtic nation. He estimated that ethnically, 5/6ths of the nation were either of Gaelic Irish-origin, or descended from returned Scottish Gaels (including much of the Ulster Scots) and some Celtic Welsh (such as his own ancestors and those carrying surnames such as Walsh and Griffiths). As part of this he was a staunch supporter of the Irish language as the &quot;national language&quot;. In regards to the Germanic minority in Ireland (of Norman and Anglo-Saxon origin) he believed that they could be assimilated into Irishness if they had a &quot;willingness to be part of the Irish Nation&quot;.

===Europe===
The Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom joined the European Community in 1973, and Irish citizens became additionally Citizens of the European Union with the Maastricht Treaty signed in 1992. This brought a further question for the future of Irish identity; whether Ireland was &quot;closer to Boston than to Berlin:&quot;

==Irish diaspora==


The Irish diaspora consists of Irish emigrants and their descendants in countries such as the United States, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and nations of the Caribbean such as Jamaica and Barbados. These countries all have large minorities of Irish descent, who in addition form the core of the Catholic Church in those countries.

Many famous and influential figures have claimed Irish ancestry such as Che Guevara, Walt Disney, Barack Obama, JFK, Muhammad Ali and &quot;Maréchal&quot; The 1st Duke of Magenta, the second President of the Third Republic.

Many Irish people were also transported to the island of Montserrat, to work as indentured servants, exiled prisoners or slaves. Unlike African chattel slaves, the majority of Irish labourers who were sent to Montserrat did so by personal choice. Some were Irish Confederate troops exiled by the English Parliamentarian Oliver Cromwell following the Irish Confederate Wars. The African slave population on the island attempted a rebellion against the Irish plantation owners on 17 March 1768. The date was chosen with the idea that the plantation owners would be distracted by St. Patrick&#x27;s day festivities, but the plot was ultimately discovered and several of those involved were put to death. To this day, the Island celebrates St. Patrick&#x27;s Day as a public holiday to commemorate the revolt and honour those who lost their lives. People of Irish descent also feature strongly in Latin America, especially in Argentina and important minorities in Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. In 1995, President Mary Robinson reached out to the &quot;70 million people worldwide who can claim Irish descent&quot;. Today the diaspora is believed to contain an estimated 80 million people.


There are also large Irish communities in some mainland European countries, notably in Spain, France and Germany. Between 1585 and 1818, over half a million Irish departed Ireland to serve in the wars on the Continent, in a constant emigration romantically styled the&quot;Flight of the Wild Geese&quot; and, before that, in the &#x27;Flight of the Earls&#x27;, just before the Plantation of Ulster. In the early years of the English Civil War, a French traveller remarked that the Irish &quot;are better soldiers abroad than at home&quot;. Later, Irish brigades in France and Spain would fight in the Wars of the Spanish and Austrian Succession and the Napoleonic Wars. In the words of Field Marshal The 1st Duke of Wellington, the Irish-born &#x27;Iron Duke&#x27;, a notable representative of the Irish military diaspora, &quot;Ireland was an inexhaustible nursery for the finest soldiers&quot;.

The British Legions were units that fought under Simón Bolívar against Spain for the independence of Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Peru. Venezuelans called them the Albion Legion. They were composed of over seven thousand volunteers, mainly Napoleonic War veterans from Great Britain and Ireland. Volunteers in the British Legion were motivated by a combination of both genuine political and mercenary motives. The most famous cause of emigration was the Great Famine of the late 1840s. A million are thought to have emigrated to Liverpool as a result of the famine. For both the Irish in Ireland and those in the resulting diaspora, the famine entered folk memory and became a rallying point for various nationalist movements.

There are Afro-Caribbean people descended from Irish immigrants in the Caribbean, especially on Barbados, Jamaica, and Montserrat. They often have Irish surnames, speak a form of Caribbean English influenced by the Irish vernacular and, in some cases, sing Irish songs.


People of Irish descent are the second largest self-reported ethnic group in the United States, after German Americans. Nine of the signatories of the American Declaration of Independence were of Irish origin. Among them was the sole Catholic signatory, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, whose family were the descendants of Ely O&#x27;Carroll, an Irish prince who had suffered under Cromwell. At least twenty-five presidents of the United States have some Irish ancestral origins, including George Washington. Since John F. Kennedy took office in 1961, every American President (with the exception of Gerald Ford and Donald Trump) has had some Irish blood. An Irish-American, James Hoban, was the designer of the White House. Commodore John Barry, who was born in County Wexford, was the &quot;Father of the United States Navy&quot;.

In the mid-19th century, large numbers of Irish immigrants were conscripted into Irish regiments of the United States Army at the time of the Mexican–American War. The vast majority of the 4,811 Irish-born soldiers served in the U.S. Army, but some deserted to the Mexican Army, primarily to escape mistreatment by Protestant officers and the strong anti-Catholic discrimination in America. These were the &quot;San Patricios&quot;, or Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion—a group of Irish led by Galway-born John O&#x27;Riley, with some German, Scottish and American Catholics. They fought until their surrender at the decisive Battle of Churubusco, and were executed outside Mexico City by the American government on 13 September 1847. The battalion is commemorated in Mexico each year on 12 September.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, 300,000 free emigrants and 45,000 convicts left Ireland to settle in Australia. Today, Australians of Irish descent are one of the largest self-reported ethnic groups in Australia, after English and Australian. In the 2006 Census, 1,803,741 residents identified themselves as having Irish ancestry either alone or in combination with another ancestry. However this figure does not include Australians with an Irish background who chose to nominate themselves as &#x27;Australian&#x27; or other ancestries. The Australian embassy in Dublin states that up to thirty per cent of the population claim some degree of Irish ancestry.

It is believed that as many as 30,000 Irish people emigrated to Argentina between the 1830s and the 1890s. This was encouraged by the clergy, as they considered a Catholic country, Argentina, preferable to a more Protestant United States. This flow of emigrants dropped sharply when assisted passage to Australia was introduced at which point the Argentine government responded with their own scheme and wrote to Irish bishops, seeking their support. However, there was little or no planning for the arrival of a large number of immigrants, no housing, no food. Many died, others made their way to the United States and other destinations, some returned to Ireland, a few remained and prospered. Thomas Croke Archbishop of Cashel, said: &quot;I most solemnly conjure my poorer countrymen, as they value their happiness hereafter, never to set foot on the Argentine Republic however tempted to do so they may be by offers of a passage or an assurance of comfortable homes.&quot; Some notable Argentines of Irish descent and Irish people who settled in Argentina include Che Guevara, former president Edelmiro Julián Farrell, and admiral William Brown.

There are people of Irish descent all over South America, such as the Chilean liberator Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins and the Peruvian photographer Mario Testino. Although some Irish retained their surnames intact, others were assimilated into the Spanish vernacular. The last name &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot;, for example, became &quot;Obregón&quot;.

People of Irish descent are also one of the largest self-reported ethnic groups in Canada, after English, French and Scottish Canadians. As of 2006, Irish Canadians number around 4,354,155.

<text>Starbuck Island (or Volunteer Island) is an uninhabited coral island in the central Pacific, and is part of the Central Line Islands of Kiribati. Its former names include &quot;Barren Island&quot;, &quot;Coral Queen Island&quot;, &quot;Hero Island&quot;, &quot;Low Island&quot;, and &quot;Starve Island&quot;.

==Geography, flora and fauna==
Located just east from the geographic center of the Pacific Ocean (), and measuring east-to-west and north-to-south, Starbuck Island has a land area of . It is a low, dry, coral limestone island with a steep beach backed by a bank composed of large coral fragments. Several hypersaline lagoons form on the island&#x27;s eastern side. These occasionally dry up, and are said to be dangerous to approach: one worker during the island&#x27;s guano-mining days sank up to his neck in salty mud before being rescued.

There is no freshwater on the island, which is one of the drier atolls in the Line Island group. Annual yearly rainfall averages approximately .

Little vegetation exists on Starbuck; stunted &quot;Sida fallax&quot; scrub and low herbs and grasses predominate, along with a few &quot;Cordia subcordata&quot; bushes and bunch grass. Photos have shown a few palm trees growing near the center of the island.

The island boasts a large colony of sooty terns, estimated at 1.5 million pairs, together with Polynesian rats, feral cats, green turtles, and around fifteen other species of seabirds. Other accounts estimate the sooty tern population to be as high as three to six million birds.

==History==
James Henderson, merchant captain of the East India Company ship &quot;Hercules&quot;, sighted the island in 1819 while sailing from South America to Calcutta, India. Soon after his arrival a local newspaper, &quot;The Calcutta Journal (or Political, Commercial, and Literary Gazette)&quot;, published Henderson&#x27;s report of three islands which he had encountered during his voyage, but did not state the exact date for his sighting of modern Starbuck Island. Henry Evans Maude estimated that this may have been in early February 1819. The next captain known to have seen it was Obed Starbuck, captain of the whaler &quot;Hero&quot; out of Nantucket, on September 5, 1823.

The island was sighted again on December 12, 1823 by Obed&#x27;s first cousin, Valentine Starbuck, the American-born master of the British whaling ship . &quot;L&#x27;Aigle&quot; was carrying King Kamehameha II of Hawaii and Queen Kamāmalu and their retinue to England. Valentine Starbuck is the first non-Pacific Islander known to have set foot on the island.

The island was finally charted in 1825 by Captain The 7th Lord Byron (a cousin of the famous poet). Byron, commanding the British warship , was returning to London from a special mission to Honolulu to repatriate the remains of the Hawaiian royal couple, King Kamehameha II and Queen Kamāmalu, who had died of measles while trying to visit King George IV. Lord Byron also sighted and charted Mauke and Malden Island, which he named after his surveying officer.

Starbuck Island was claimed by the United States under the 1856 Guano Islands Act, but was controlled by Britain after 1866, when possession was taken by Commodore Swinburn of . The island was mined for phosphate between 1870 and 1893. It formed part of the British Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony prior to the independence of Kiribati in 1979. American claims to the atoll were formally vacated in the Treaty of Tarawa, signed the same year.

At its highest point, the island rises to only about 5 meters. Due to its low profile and dangerous surrounding reefs, a number of ships were wrecked at Starbuck Island in the late 19th century. The French transport &quot;Euryale&quot; wrecked there in March 1870 and the crew was marooned on the atoll for 35 days. The experience allowed the captain of &quot;Euryale&quot;, future contre-admiral Albert Des Portes, to finally chart the correct geographical location of the island. All members of the crew were eventually rescued and returned to France.

On August 7, 1896 the Norwegian ship &quot;Seladon&quot; was wrecked against the barrier. The crew went into the lifeboats and drifted for 30 days until they landed on the island of Niulakita, Tuvalu. They lived together with a few natives for 10 months until they were rescued by a passing ship.

Starbuck Island has been designated as the Starbuck Island Wildlife Sanctuary. In 2014 the Kiribati government established a 12-nautical-mile fishing exclusion zone around each of the southern Line Islands: Caroline (commonly called Millennium), Flint, Vostok, Malden, and Starbuck.

Unlike the string quartet (of 4 string instruments) with its homogeneous blend of sound color, the instruments in a wind quintet differ from each other considerably in technique, idiom, and timbre. The modern wind quintet sprang from the octet ensemble favored in the court of Joseph II in late 18th century Vienna: two oboes, two clarinets, two (natural) horns, and two bassoons. The influence of Haydn&#x27;s chamber writing suggested similar possibilities for winds, and advances in the building of these instruments in that period made them more useful in small ensemble settings, leading composers to attempt smaller combinations.

It was Anton Reicha&#x27;s twenty-four quintets, begun in 1811, and the nine quintets of Franz Danzi that established the genre, and their pieces are still standards of the repertoire. Though the form fell out of favor in the latter half of the 19th century, there has been renewed interest in the form by leading composers in the 20th century, and today the wind quintet is a standard chamber ensemble, valued for its versatility and variety of tone color.

<text>Hendrik Petrus Berlage (; 21 February 185612 August 1934) was a Dutch architect and designer. He is considered one of the fathers of the architecture of the Amsterdam School.

==Life and work==
Hendrik Petrus Berlage, son of Nicolaas Willem Berlage and Anna Catharina Bosscha, was born on 21 February 1856 in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Anna Catharina Bosscha&#x27;s uncle was Johannes Bosscha, a scientist who taught in Polytechnische School te Delft.

Berlage studied architecture at the Zurich Institute of Technology between 1875 and 1878 after which he traveled extensively for three years through Europe. In the 1880s he formed a partnership in the Netherlands with Theodore Sanders which produced a mixture of practical and utopian projects. A published author, Berlage held memberships in various architectural societies including CIAM I.

Berlage was influenced by the Neo-Romanesque brickwork architecture of Henry Hobson Richardson and of the combination of structures of iron seen with brick of the Castle of the Three Geckos of Domènech i Montaner. This influence is visible in his design for the Amsterdam Commodities Exchange, for which he would also draw on the ideas of Viollet-le-Duc. The load-bearing bare brick walls and the notion of the primacy of space, and of walls as the creators of form, would be the constitutive principles of the &#x27;Hollandse Zakelijkheid&#x27;.

A visit Berlage made to the U.S. in 1911 greatly affected his architecture. From then on the organic architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright would be a significant influence. Lectures he gave when returned to Europe would help to disseminate Wright&#x27;s thoughts in Germany.

A notable overseas commission was the 1916 Holland House, built as offices for a Dutch shipping company in Bury Street in the City of London (behind Norman Foster&#x27;s 30 St Mary Axe of 2003).

Considered the &quot;Father of Modern architecture&quot; in the Netherlands and the intermediary between the Traditionalists and the Modernists, Berlage&#x27;s theories inspired most Dutch architectural groups of the 1920s, including the Traditionalists, the Amsterdam School, De Stijl and the New Objectivists. He received the British RIBA Royal Gold Medal in 1932.

Berlage died on 12 August 1934 in The Hague. His son, also named Hendrik Petrus Berlage, was an astronomer in Royal Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory in Batavia, Dutch East Indies (now Jakarta, Indonesia), whose name has been immortalized as a lunar crater (Berlage).

== Legacy ==
The Berlage Institute has been a postgraduate school for architecture since 1990.

Works of Berlage are in the public collections of Museum de Fundatie, Gemeentemuseum Den Haag, and Kröller-Müller Museum.

<text>Pandolfo Petrucci (14 February 1452 – 21 May 1512) was a ruler of the Italian Republic of Siena during the Renaissance.

==Biography==
Petrucci was born and raised in Siena, into an aristocratic family of wealthy merchants. When Petrucci was still a child, in 1456, his family was forced into exile due to his uncle, Antonio Petrucci, being involved in a failed conspiracy against the Republic of Siena. The family moved to Pisa. In 1480 the presence in Tuscany of the army of Duke Alfonso of Calabria allowed the exiles to return to the city. 

In 1481, he was admitted to the People&#x27;s Council with his brothers Alessandro and Vittorio. In October 1482 he married Eufrasia Martinozzi. He joined his brother Vittorio in Paganico, where the family had property. He then moved to Montepulciano, before joining his brother Giacoppo in Pisa. 

By 1487, he had married his second wife, Aurelia Borghesi, daughter of Niccolo, one of the most important men in Siena. When the Noveschi returned to prominence, Petrucci seized power in a coup, with the support of Cardinal Piccolomini, nephew of Pope Pius II, and assistance from his brother Giacopo (d. 1497). He later became captain of the city guard in 1495. He was part of the committee that hired Francesco di Giorgio Martini to renovate the city&#x27;s defenses. 

===Rise to power===

When his brother Giacopo died in 1497, Petrucci assumed all of his offices and seized control of his fortune. With his father-in-law&#x27;s backing, Petrucci assumed a number of public offices and gained a vast amount of political power. He subsequently used this power to sell public offices or to give them to his lackeys, a strategy which allowed him to become the most powerful man in Siena. However, Petrucci&#x27;s power and his organization of followers in Siena&#x27;s government gained him many enemies, including his father-in-law. Niccolò and other influential citizens of Siena conspired to assassinate Petrucci, but Petrucci uncovered the plot and had Niccolò murdered in 1500.

With his enemies out of the way, Petrucci ruled as absolute tyrant over Siena. Petrucci subsequently stopped selling public offices in order to consolidate his own power. Although a brutal authoritarian and absolutist, Petrucci was careful to pacify the people of Siena by improving the city&#x27;s economy and encouraging the advancement of art. He also managed to avoid a war with Florence, which had been at odds with Siena for over a century due to a dispute over Siena&#x27;s control of Montepulciano. 

When France and Spain invaded the Italian Peninsula, Petrucci became involved in a number of political intrigues. During this time period, Petrucci tried to gain the powerful Cesare Borgia&#x27;s trust by diplomatically procuring French-controlled Piombino for Borgia. However, he secretly plotted against Borgia in the hopes of increasing his own power. Borgia, who had never trusted Petrucci, learned of the Sienese tyrant&#x27;s plans and invited him to a meeting at Senigallia in 1502, where Petrucci would have been assassinated along with Cesare&#x27;s other enemies. Petrucci suspected his life was in danger and avoided the meeting, but nevertheless fled Siena in January 1503 in order to appease Borgia. He subsequently resided in Lucca. With the assistance of his ally King Louis XII of France, however, Petrucci was returned to power two months later. Je later, in 1509, sent a small military contingent to assist the French against Venice in the Battle of Agnadello.

===Later years===
Before his death, Petrucci was known to have plotted in secret with Spain and Pope Julius II against his old allies, the French. He was also rumored to have had Pope Pius III poisoned in 1503.

With Borgia&#x27;s death in 1507, Petrucci became one of the most powerful men in Italy. In his final years, Petrucci supported Pisa militarily in its war against Florence. However, Pope Julius II and Spain forced Petrucci to make peace with Florence, to which he reluctantly gave the territory of Montepulciano in 1512. In return, the pope made Petrucci&#x27;s son, Alfonso Petrucci, a cardinal. Later that year, Petrucci handed control of Siena over to his son, Borghese Petrucci, and died shortly afterwards in San Quirico d&#x27;Orcia, Italy.

He was a generous patron of the Basilica dell&#x27;Osservanza, where he was buried next to his father.

Following Pandolfo&#x27;s death, the Petrucci family ruled Siena until 1524.

<text>In the jargon of computer programming, a source upgrade is a modification of a computer program&#x27;s source code, which adds new features and options to it, improves performance and stability, or fixes bugs and errors from the previous version. There are two popular types of source upgrades, which are listed here:

* Patch: source upgrade, where the modification of original source is provided in a special patch program. The patch is released by the developer of software. Generally, this type of source upgrade focus on bug and error fixing, not on adding new features to the engine. Patches are available on sites or FTP&#x27;s of application developer. They can be also obtained from various computer magazines.
* Source port, which is a user modification (mod). The source port modification focuses on changes in original source code (mostly adding new features – like 3D renderers support, new graphic technologies usage or porting the game into other platform, which the original was not available for), without editing the other resources of software. Most of source ports are created for old, classic games — for example: &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Quake I/II&quot;, &quot;Strife&quot;, &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;, &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot;. The source code of those applications can be easily and legally downloaded from the Internet under GPL license – they were released by the developers. Of course, those are custom applications and are not supported by the producers of software in any way.

<text>Vostok Island is an uninhabited coral island in the central Pacific Ocean, part of the Line Islands belonging to Kiribati. Other names for the island include Anne Island, Bostock Island, Leavitts Island, Reaper Island, Wostock Island or Wostok Island. The island was first sighted in 1820 by the Russian explorer Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen, who named the island for his ship &quot;Vostok.&quot;

== Geography, flora and fauna ==

Vostok covers a land area of . Its nearest neighbors are Flint Island, south-southeast; Caroline Atoll (renamed Millennium Island), to the east; and Penrhyn, to the west. It is in length, and is triangular-shaped.

Beaches on the island range between wide, composed of coral sand and rubble. There is no lagoon or fresh water on the island, and no known freshwater lens. Vostok&#x27;s major portion is covered with a pure stand of &quot;Pisonia&quot; trees rooted in moist peat soil one meter thick. These trees, with heights of up to , grow so densely that no other plants can grow beneath them. 
The island&#x27;s dense foliage looks dark from when viewed above. This gives the island the appearance of a mysterious black hole when seen on Google Earth which generated speculation in 2021, leading to many to believe that the island is being censored from public view. However this conclusion is easily refuted by other mapping services and publicly available images. 

The herbs &quot;Boerhavia repens&quot; and &quot;Sesuvium portulacastrum&quot; round out the known vegetation. Although coconut seedlings were planted on Vostok in 1922 they failed to grow despite being successfully cultivated on the nearby islands of Caroline and Flint.

Noteworthy fauna includes several species of seabirds, including the red-footed booby (&quot;Sula sula&quot;), great frigatebird (&quot;Fregata minor&quot;), lesser frigatebird (&quot;F. ariel&quot;), black noddy (&quot;Anous minutus&quot;), white tern (&quot;Gygis alba&quot;), masked booby (&quot;Sula dactylatra&quot;), brown booby (&quot;S. leucogaster&quot;) and brown noddy (&quot;Anous stolidus&quot;). The Polynesian rat and the copper-tailed skink (&quot;Emoia cyanura&quot;), together with coconut crabs and green turtles, completes the known land fauna.

== History ==
According to a 1966 article in &quot;Pacific Islands Monthly&quot;, there is no evidence of Polynesian settlement of Vostok Island prior to European discovery. Cook Islanders from Manihiki and Penrhyn atoll – the nearest inhabited islands to Vostok – interviewed in 1924 reported that they had no name for the island and were unaware of its existence.

The island was first sighted in 1820 by the Russian explorer Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen, who named the island for his ship &quot;Vostok&quot; (the name means &quot;East&quot; in Russian). Various whalers sighted the island over the following decades and believed it to be undiscovered, giving it the additional names of Stavers Island, Reaper Island, Leavitts Island and Anne Island.

In 1841, the island was visited by USS &quot;Porpoise&quot; of the United States Exploring Expedition, which was unable to land due to heavy surf. Vostok was claimed by the United States under the &quot;Guano Act of 1856&quot;, but was never mined for phosphate. In 1874, guano entrepreneur John T. Arundel was granted licence to the island by the British Colonial Office. The coal barque &quot;Tokatea&quot; was wrecked on the island in 1879, with its crew making the first recorded landing and subsequently escaping to Tetiꞌaroa in the ship&#x27;s boats. Arundel visited Vostok in 1883 to assess its potential and completed a survey for the Admiralty Office.

Vostok formed part of the British Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony, until becoming a part of newly independent Kiribati in 1979. American claims on the island were vacated in the Treaty of Tarawa in the same year.

Vostok Island is designated as the &quot;Vostok Island Wildlife Sanctuary&quot;. In 2014 the Kiribati government announced the establishment of a 12-nautical-mile fishing exclusion zone around each of the southern Line Islands (Caroline, Flint, Vostok, Malden, and Starbuck).

Its isolated nature means it is rarely visited, save by the occasional scientist or yachter. Passengers aboard the &quot;Golden Princess&quot; see it on the ship&#x27;s route from French Polynesia to Hawaii. Landing is said to be difficult, and no harbor or anchorage exists.

<doc id="775924" wikidata="Q1295340" url="?curid=775924" title="Last Interglacial">
<text>The Last Interglacial, also known as the Eemian, was the interglacial period which began about 130,000 years ago at the end of the Penultimate Glacial Period and ended about 115,000 years ago at the beginning of the Last Glacial Period. It corresponds to Marine Isotope Stage 5e. It was the second-to-latest interglacial period of the current Ice Age, the most recent being the Holocene which extends to the present day (having followed the last glacial period). During the Last Interglacial, the proportion of in the atmosphere was about 280 parts per million. The Last Interglacial was one of the warmest periods of the last 800,000 years, with temperatures comparable to and at times warmer (by up to on average 2 degrees Celsius) than the contemporary Holocene interglacial, with the maximum sea level being up to 6 to 9 metres higher than at present, with global ice volume likely also being smaller than the Holocene interglacial.

The Last Interglacial is known as the Eemian in northern Europe (sometimes used to describe the global interglacial), Ipswichian in Britain, the Mikulino (also spelled Milukin) interglacial in Russia, the Kaydaky in Ukraine, the Valdivia interglacial in Chile, and the Riss-Würm interglacial in the Alps. Depending on how a specific publication defines the Sangamonian Stage of North America, the Last Interglacial is equivalent to either all or part of it.

The period falls into the Middle Paleolithic and is of some interest for the evolution of anatomically modern humans, who were present in Western Asia (Skhul and Qafzeh hominins) as well as in Southern Africa by this time, representing the earliest split of modern human populations that persists to the present time (associated with mitochondrial haplogroup L0). As the most recent point in time with a climate comparable to the Holocene, the Last Interglacial is also of relevance as a point of reference (baseline) for nature conservation.

== Definition ==
 The Last Interglacial was first recognized from boreholes in the area of the city of Amersfoort, Netherlands, by Pieter Harting (1875). He named the beds &quot;Système Eémien&quot;, after the river Eem on which Amersfoort is located. Harting noticed the marine molluscan assemblages to be very different from the modern fauna of the North Sea. Many species from the Last Interglacial layers nowadays show a much more southern distribution, ranging from South of the Strait of Dover to Portugal (Lusitanian faunal province) and even into the Mediterranean (Mediterranean faunal province). More information on the molluscan assemblages is given by Lorié (1887), and Spaink (1958). Since their discovery, Last Interglacial beds in the Netherlands have mainly been recognized by their marine molluscan content combined with their stratigraphical position and other palaeontology. The marine beds there are often underlain by tills that are considered to date from the Saalian, and overlain by local fresh water or wind-blown deposits from the Weichselian. In contrast to e.g. the deposits in Denmark, the Last Interglacial deposits in the type area have never been found overlain by tills, nor in ice-pushed positions.
Van Voorthuysen (1958) described the foraminifera from the type site, whereas Zagwijn (1961) published the palynology, providing a subdivision of this stage into pollen stages. At the end of the 20th century, the type site was re-investigated using old and new data in a multi-disciplinary approach (Cleveringa et al., 2000). At the same time a was selected in the Amsterdam glacial basin in the Amsterdam-Terminal borehole and was the subject of a multidisciplinary investigation (Van Leeuwen, et al., 2000). These authors also published a U/Th age for late Last Interglacial deposits from this borehole of 118,200 ± 6,300 years ago. A historical review of Dutch Last Interglacial research is provided by Bosch, Cleveringa and Meijer, 2000.

==Climate==
===Global temperatures===
The Last Interglacial climate is believed to have been warmer than the current Holocene. The temperature of the Last Interglacial peaked during the early part of the period, around 128,000 to 123,000 years Before Present, before declining during the latter half of the period. Changes in the Earth&#x27;s orbital parameters from today (greater obliquity and eccentricity, and perihelion), known as Milankovitch cycles, probably led to greater seasonal temperature variations in the Northern Hemisphere. As the Last Interglacial cooled, &quot;p&quot;CO2 remained stable.

During the northern summer, temperatures in the Arctic region were about 2–4 °C higher than in 2011. The Arctic Last Interglacial climate was highly unstable, with pronounced temperature swings revealed by δ18O fluctuations in Greenlandic ice cores, though some of the instability inferred from Greenland ice core project records may be a result of mixing of Last Interglacial ice with ice from the preceding or succeeding glacial intervals.

The warmest peak of the Last Interglacial was around 125,000 years ago, when forests reached as far north as North Cape, Norway (which is now tundra) well above the Arctic Circle at . Hardwood trees such as hazel and oak grew as far north as Oulu, Finland. At the peak of the Last Interglacial, the Northern Hemisphere winters were generally warmer and wetter than now, though some areas were actually slightly cooler than today. A cooling event similar to but not exactly mirroring the 8.2-kiloyear event is recorded from Beckentin during the E5 phase of the Eemian, some 6,290 years after the start of interglacial afforestation. A 2018 study based on soil samples from Sokli in northern Finland identified abrupt cold spells ca. 120,000 years ago caused by shifts in the North Atlantic Current, lasting hundreds of years and causing temperature drops of a few degrees and vegetation changes in these regions. In Northern Europe, winter temperatures rose over the course of the Last Interglacial while summer temperatures fell. During an insolation maximum from 133,000 to 130,000 BP, meltwater from the Dnieper and Volga caused the Black and Caspian Seas to connect. During the middle of the Last Interglacial, a weakened Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) began to cool the eastern Mediterranean region. The period closed as temperatures steadily fell to conditions cooler and drier than the present, with a 468-year-long aridity pulse in central Europe at about 116,000 BC, and by 112,000 BC, ice caps began to form in southern Norway, marking the start of a new glacial period. The Eemian lasted about 1,500 to 3,000 years longer in Southern Europe than in Northern Europe. Kaspar &quot;et al.&quot; (GRL, 2005) performed a comparison of a coupled general circulation model (GCM) with reconstructed Last Interglacial temperatures for Europe. Central Europe (north of the Alps) was found to be warmer than present; south of the Alps, conditions were 1–2 °C cooler than today. The model (generated using observed greenhouse gas concentrations and Last Interglacial orbital parameters) generally reproduces these observations, leading them to conclude that these factors are enough to explain the Last Interglacial temperatures.

Meltwater pulse 2B, approximately 133,000 BP, substantially weakened the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM).

Trees grew as far north as southern Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago: currently, the northern limit is further south at Kuujjuaq in northern Quebec. Coastal Alaska was warm enough during the summer due to reduced sea ice in the Arctic Ocean to allow Saint Lawrence Island (now tundra) to have boreal forest, although inadequate precipitation caused a reduction in the forest cover in interior Alaska and Yukon Territory despite warmer conditions. The prairie-forest boundary in the Great Plains of the United States lay further west near Lubbock, Texas, whereas the current boundary is near Dallas.

Interglacial conditions ended on Antarctica while the Northern Hemisphere was still experiencing warmth.

== Sea level ==
Sea level at peak was probably higher than today, with Greenland contributing , thermal expansion and mountain glaciers contributing up to , and an uncertain contribution from Antarctica. A 2007 study found evidence that the Greenland ice core site Dye 3 was glaciated during the Last Interglacial, which implies that Greenland could have contributed at most to sea level rise. Recent research on marine sediment cores offshore of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet suggest that the sheet melted during the Last Interglacial, and that ocean waters rose as fast as 2.5 meters per century. Global mean sea surface temperatures are thought to have been higher than in the Holocene, but not by enough to explain the rise in sea level through thermal expansion alone, and so melting of polar ice caps must also have occurred.

Because of the sea level drop since the Last Interglacial, exposed fossil coral reefs are common in the tropics, especially in the Caribbean and along the Red Sea coastlines. These reefs often contain internal erosion surfaces showing significant sea level instability during the Last Interglacial.

Along the Central Mediterranean Spanish coast, sea levels were comparable to those of the present. Scandinavia formed an island due to the area between the Gulf of Finland and the White Sea being drowned. Vast areas of northwestern Europe and the West Siberian Plain were inundated.

== Fauna ==
The warmness of the interval allowed temperate-adapted taxa to extend their range considerably northward, with the range of the hippopotamus (&quot;Hippopotamus amphibius&quot;) notably extending as far north as North Yorkshire in northern England, though their range outside of southern Europe did not extend much further east of than the Rhine. The temperate landscapes of Europe were inhabited by large now extinct megafauna including the straight-tusked elephant (&quot;Palaeoloxodon antiquus&quot;), the narrow-nosed rhinoceros (&quot;Stephanorhinus hemitoechus&quot;), Merck&#x27;s rhinoceros (&quot;Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis&quot;), Irish elk (&quot;Megaloceros giganteus&quot;) and aurochs (&quot;Bos primigenius&quot;), alongside still-living species like red deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;), fallow deer (&quot;Dama dama&quot;), roe deer (&quot;Capreolus capreolus&quot;) and wild boar (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;), with predators including lions (the extinct &quot;Panthera spelaea&quot;) and cave hyenas (&quot;Crocuta&quot; (&quot;Crocuta&quot;) &quot;spelaea&quot;), brown bears (&quot;Ursus arctos&quot;) and wolves (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;). The Last Interglacial ecosystems of Europe, which existed prior to the global wave of megafauna extinctions that occurred during the following Last Glacial Period, has been suggested as a &quot;baseline&quot; reference point for the analysis and restoration of modern European ecosystems.

Following the melting of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, a number of North American megafauna species migrated northwards to inhabit northern Canada and Alaska during the Last Interglacial, including the American camel &quot;Camelops hesternus,&quot; mastodons (genus &quot;Mammut&quot;) the large ground sloth &quot;Megalonyx jeffersonii,&quot; and the bear sized giant beaver &quot;Castoroides,&quot; with the lower latitudes of Canada being inhabited (in addition to the aformentioned taxa) by species like Columbian mammoth (&quot;Mammuthus columbi&quot;), stag-moose (&quot;Cervalces&quot;), and the llama &quot;Hemiauchenia&quot;. The steppe bison (&quot;Bison priscus&quot;) migrated into the heartlands of North America from Alaska at the beginning of the Last Interglacial, giving rise to the giant long-horned bison &quot;Bison latifrons&quot; (which is first known from the Snowmass site in Colorado, dating to around 120,000 years ago) and ultimately all North American bison species, and marking the beginning of the Rancholabrean faunal age in North America. Also during this time period the American lion (&quot;Panthera atrox&quot;) appeared and become widespread across North America, having descended from populations of the Eurasian cave lion (&quot;Panthera spelaea&quot;) that had migrated into Alaska during the preceding Penultimate Glacial Period.

The range of cold-adapted taxa like the woolly mammoth (&quot;Mammuthus primigenius&quot;) contracted towards refugia.

== Paleoanthropology ==
Neanderthals managed to colonise the higher latitudes of Europe during this time interval, after having retreated from the region due to unfavourable conditions during the Penultimate Glacial Period. However, unlike previous interglacials, they were absent from Britain, likely due to Britain being an island during this time. During the Last Interglacial, Neanderthals engaged in a variety of food-gathering activities, including fishing, as well as big-game hunting, including the largest animals living in Europe at the time, straight-tusked elephants. Modern humans were present outside Africa in Arabia during this interval, as far east as the Persian Gulf.

<text>Aymaran (also Jaqi or Aru) is one of the two dominant language families in the central Andes alongside Quechuan. The family consists of Aymara, widely spoken in Bolivia, and the endangered Jaqaru and Kawki languages of Peru.

Hardman (1978) proposed the name &quot;Jaqi&quot; for the family of languages (1978), Alfredo Torero &quot;Aru&quot; &#x27;to speak&#x27;, and Rodolfo Cerrón Palomino &quot;Aymaran&quot;, with two branches, Southern (or Altiplano) Aymaran and Central Aymaran (Jaqaru and Kawki). Other names for the family are Jaqui (also spelled Haki) and Aimara. 

Quechuan languages, especially those of the south, share a large amount of vocabulary with Aymara, and the languages have often been grouped together as Quechumaran. This proposal is controversial, however; the shared vocabulary may be better explained as intensive borrowing due to long-term contact.

==Family division==
Aymaran consists of two or three languages:
*Aymara. Southern and Central dialects divergent and sometimes considered separate languages.
*Jaqaru (Haqearu, Haqaru, Haq&#x27;aru, Aru).
*Kawki (Cauqui, Cachuy).

Aymara has approximately 2.2 million speakers; 1.7 million in Bolivia, 350,000 in Peru, and the rest in Chile and Argentina. Jaqaru has approximately 725 speakers in central Peru, and Kawki had 9 surviving speakers as of 2005. Kawki is little documented though its relationship with Jaqaru is quite close. Initially, they were considered by Martha Hardman (on very limited data at the time) to be different languages, but all subsequent fieldwork and research has contradicted that and demonstrated that they are mutually intelligible but divergent dialects of a single language.

==History==
The Aymaran urheimat may have been the southern Peruvian coast, particularly the area of the Paracas culture and the later Nazca culture. Aymaran speakers then migrated into the highlands and played a role in the Huari Empire. Sometime between the collapse of the Tiwanaku Empire and the rise of the Inca, some Aymaran speakers invaded the Altiplano, while others moved to the northwest, presumably ancestral to the Jaqaru and influencing Quechua I. Aymaran varieties were documented in the southern Peruvian highlands (including Lucanas, Chumbivilcas, and Condesuyos) by the 1586 Relaciones geográficas, and they appear to have persisted up until the 19th century. The eastern and southern Bolivian highlands were still predominantly Aymara-speaking around 1600, but may have adopted Quechua as a result of development of the mining industry.

==Language contact==
Jolkesky (2016) notes that there are lexical similarities with the Kechua, Kunza, Leko, Uru-Chipaya, Arawak, and Pukina language families due to contact.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
Aymaran languages have only three phonemic vowels , which in most varieties of Aymara and Jaqaru are distinguished by length. Length is commonly transcribed using diaereses in Aymara and length diacritics in Jaqaru.

=== Consonants ===
Though Aymaran languages vary in terms of consonant inventories, they have several features in common. Aymara and Jaqaru both contain phonemic stops at labial, alveolar, palatal, velar and uvular points of articulation. Stops are distinguished by ejective and aspirated features. Both also contain alveolar, palatal, and velar fricatives and several central and lateral approximants.

=== Morphophonology ===
Aymaran languages differ from Quechuan languages in that all verbal and nominal roots must end in a vowel, even in loanwords: Spanish &quot;habas&quot; (&quot;beans&quot;) became Aymara &quot;hawasa&quot; and Jaqaru &quot;háwaša&quot;. This feature is not found in other Andean languages. 

Like Quechuan languages, Aymaran languages are highly agglutinative. However, they differ in that many agglutinative suffixes trigger vowel suppression in the preceding roots. An example is the loss of final vowel in the word &quot;apa&quot; (&quot;to take&quot;), when it becomes &quot;ap-su&quot; (&quot;to take out&quot;).

<text>Duke Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle (, literally &quot;The Blue-Bearded Duke&#x27;s Castle&quot;) is a one-act Symbolist opera by composer Béla Bartók to a Hungarian libretto by his friend and poet Béla Balázs. Based on the French folk legend, or &quot;conte populaire&quot;, as told by Charles Perrault, it lasts about an hour and deploys just two singing characters: Bluebeard () and his newest wife Judith (); the two have just eloped and she is coming home to his castle for the first time.

&quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot;, Sz. 48, was composed in 1911 (with modifications made in 1912 and a new ending added in 1917) and first performed on 24 May 1918 at the Royal Hungarian Opera House in Budapest. Universal Edition published the vocal (1921) and full score (1925). The Boosey &amp; Hawkes full score includes only the German and English singing translations while the Dover edition reproduces the Universal Edition Hungarian/German vocal score (with page numbers beginning at 1 instead of 5). A revision of the UE vocal score in 1963 added a new German translation by Wilhelm Ziegler, but seems not to have corrected any errata. Universal Edition and Bartók Records has published a new edition of the work in 2005 with a new English translation by , accompanied by an extensive errata list.

==Composition history==

Balázs originally conceived the libretto for his roommate Zoltán Kodály in 1908, and wrote it during the following two years. It was first published serially in 1910 with a joint dedication to Kodály and Bartók, and in 1912 appeared with the prologue in the collection &quot;Mysteries&quot;. Bartók was motivated to complete the opera in 1911 by the closing date of the Ferenc Erkel Prize competition, for which it was duly entered. A second competition, organised by the music publishers Rózsavölgyi and with a closing date in 1912, encouraged Bartók to make some modifications to the work in order to submit it to the Rózsavölgyi competition.

Little is known about the Ferenc Erkel Prize other than that &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot; did not win. The Rózsavölgyi judges, after reviewing the composition, decided that the work (with only two characters and a single location) was not dramatic enough to be considered in the category for which it was entered: theatrical music. It is thought that the panel of judges who were to look at the musical (rather than the theatrical) aspects of the competition entries never saw Bartók&#x27;s entry.

In 1913 Balázs produced a spoken performance at which Bartók played some piano pieces on a separate part of the program. A 1915 letter to Bartók&#x27;s young wife, Márta, (to whom he dedicated the opera) ends: &quot;Now I know that I will never hear it in this life. You asked me to play it for you—I am afraid I would not be able to get through it. Still I&#x27;ll try so that we may mourn it together.&quot;

==Performance history==

The success of the ballet &quot;The Wooden Prince&quot; in 1917 paved the way for the May 1918 première with the same conductor, Egisto Tango. Oszkár Kálmán was the first Bluebeard and the first Judith. Following Balázs&#x27; exile in 1919 and the ban on his work there were no revivals until 1936. Bartók attended rehearsals and reportedly sided with the new Bluebeard, Mihály Székely, over the new conductor Sergio Failoni, who was insisting on fidelity to the printed score.

Productions in Germany followed in Frankfurt (1922) and Berlin (1929).

&quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot; was first performed in Italy at the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino on 5 May 1938. The production was conducted by Sergio Failoni and starred Mihály Székely in the title role and Ella Némethy as Judith. The Teatro di San Carlo mounted the opera for the first time under Ferenc Fricsay on 19 April 1951 with Mario Petri and Ira Malaniuk. The work&#x27;s La Scala debut occurred on 28 January 1954 with Petri and Dorothy Dow. This was followed by several other productions at major opera houses in Italy, including the Teatro Regio di Torino (1961), Teatro dell&#x27;Opera di Roma (1962), Teatro Comunale di Bologna (1966), La Fenice (1967), and the Teatro Regio di Parma (1970).

The first American performance was by the Dallas Symphony Orchestra broadcast on NBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Orchestras of the Nation&quot; on 9 January 1949, followed by a concert performance at the Music Hall at Fair Park in Dallas, Texas, on 10 January. Both performances were led by conductor Antal Doráti, a former Bartók student. Other sources mention a 1946 concert performance in Dallas. The first fully staged American production was at the New York City Opera on 2 October 1952 with conductor Joseph Rosenstock and singers James Pease and Catherine Ayres. The Metropolitan Opera mounted the opera for the first time on 10 June 1974 with conductor Sixten Ehrling and singers David Ward and Shirley Verrett.

The South American premiere was in Buenos Aires&#x27;s Teatro Colón, 23 September 1953 conducted by Karl Böhm.

&quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot; received its French premiere on 17 April 1950 in a radio broadcast on Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française. Ernest Ansermet conducted the performance, which featured Renée Gilly as Judith and Lucien Lovano as Bluebeard. The first staged production of the work in France was at the Opéra national du Rhin on 29 April 1954 with Heinz Rehfuss in the title role, Elsa Cavelti as Judith, and conductor Ernest Bour. The first performance in Paris was at the Opéra-Comique on 8 October 1959 with soprano Berthe Monmart and bass Xavier Depraz. The production was directed by Marcel Lamy and used a French translation by Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi.

The London première took place on 16 January 1957 at the Rudolf Steiner Theatre during the English tour of Scottish composer Erik Chisholm directing the University of Cape Town Opera Company whose Désirée Talbot was Judith. A few years earlier, Chisholm had premièred this work in South Africa at the Little Theatre in Cape Town.

The work was first performed in Japan on 29 April 1954 by the Youth Group of the Fujiwara Opera Company (under conductor Yoichiro Fukunaga with piano accompaniment). The opera was presented with full orchestra in the 348th regular concert of the NHK Symphony Orchestra on 16 March 1957.

The opera&#x27;s Austrian premiere took place at the Salzburg Festival on 4 August 1978 with conductor George Alexander Albrecht, Walter Berry and Katalin Kasza.

In Israel, the opera premiered on 15 December 2010 at the New Israeli Opera in Tel Aviv. Vladimir Braun was Bluebeard and Svetlana Sandler sang Judith. Shirit Lee Weiss directed and Ilan Volkov conducted. The sets, originally used in the Seattle Symphony&#x27;s 2007 performance were designed by glass artist Dale Chihuly.

In 1988 the BBC broadcast an adaptation of the opera as &quot;Duke Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot; directed by Leslie Megahey. It starred Robert Lloyd as Bluebeard and Elizabeth Laurence as Judith.

The Taiwanese première, directed and conducted by Tseng Dau-Hsiong, took place in the National Theater in Taipei on 30 December 2011. In January 2015, the Metropolitan Opera presented its first production of &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot; in the original Hungarian, starring Mikhail Petrenko as Bluebeard and Nadja Michael as Judith. In 2022 the Teatro Colón of Buenos Aires broadcast a staging directed by Sophie Hunter.

==Roles==

Bartók includes the Castle on the dramatis personæ page.

==Synopsis==
:Place: A huge, dark hall in a castle, with seven locked doors.
:Time: Not defined.

Judith and Bluebeard arrive at his castle, which is all dark. Bluebeard asks Judith if she wants to stay and even offers her an opportunity to leave, but she decides to stay. Judith insists that all the doors be opened, to allow light to enter into the forbidding interior, insisting further that her demands are based on her love for Bluebeard. Bluebeard refuses, saying that there are private places not to be explored by others, and asking Judith to love him but ask no questions. Judith persists, and eventually prevails over his resistance.

The first door opens to reveal a torture chamber, stained with blood. Repelled, but then intrigued, Judith pushes on. Behind the second door is a storehouse of weapons, and behind the third a storehouse of riches. Bluebeard urges her on. Behind the fourth door is a secret garden of great beauty; behind the fifth, a window onto Bluebeard&#x27;s vast kingdom. All is now sunlit, but blood has stained the riches, watered the garden, and grim clouds throw blood-red shadows over Bluebeard&#x27;s kingdom.

Bluebeard pleads with her to stop: the castle is as bright as it can get, and will not get any brighter, but Judith refuses to be stopped after coming this far, and opens the penultimate sixth door, as a shadow passes over the castle. This is the first room that has not been somehow stained with blood; a silent silvery lake is all that lies within, &quot;a lake of tears&quot;. Bluebeard begs Judith to simply love him, and ask no more questions. The last door must be shut forever. But she persists, asking him about his former wives, and then accusing him of having murdered them, suggesting that their blood was the blood everywhere, that their tears were those that filled the lake, and that their bodies lie behind the last door. At this, Bluebeard hands over the last key.

Behind the door are Bluebeard&#x27;s three former wives, but still alive, dressed in crowns and jewellery. They emerge silently, and Bluebeard, overcome with emotion, prostrates himself before them and praises each in turn (as his wives of dawn, midday and dusk), finally turning to Judith and beginning to praise her as his fourth wife (of the night). She is horrified and begs him to stop, but it is too late. He dresses her in the jewellery they wear, which she finds exceedingly heavy. Her head drooping under the weight, she follows the other wives along a beam of moonlight through the seventh door. It closes behind her, and Bluebeard is left alone as all fades to total darkness.

== Symbolism ==
The Hungarian conductor István Kertész believed that we should not relate this to the fairy tale on which it was based, but that Bluebeard was Bartók himself, and that it portrays his personal suffering and his reluctance to reveal the inner secrets of his soul, which are progressively invaded by Judith. In this way he can be seen as Everyman, although the composer himself was an intensely private man. Here the blood that pervades the story is the symbol of his suffering. The Prologue (often omitted) points to the story that is portrayed as occurring in the imagination of the audience. While Kertész felt Judith is a villain in this sense, Christa Ludwig, who had sung the role, disagreed, stating that she only voices all that she has heard about Bluebeard. She refers repeatedly to the rumours (&quot;hír&quot;), &quot;Jaj, igaz hír; suttogó hír&quot; (Ah, truthful whispered rumours). Ludwig also believed that Judith was telling the truth every time she says to him, &quot;Szeretlek!&quot; (I love you!).

Another Judith, Nadja Michael, had a somewhat different, more symbolic interpretation. In a broadcast from the Metropolitan Opera on 14 February 2015, she stated that it does not matter who Judith is; she symbolises a human being who has to face up to all the fears that she brings from her past.

In 2020, the Bayerische Staatsoper presented a transformed staging of Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle into a work they titled &quot;Judith&quot;. The opera is preceded by a film that sets up the revised drama, using Bartok&#x27;s &quot;Concerto for Orchestra&quot; as the audio backdrop. Judith is a Police Detective and expert in undercover work. Instead of becoming Bluebeard&#x27;s next victim, she frees the three previous wives and kills the perpetrator. The reinterpretation has received many positive reviews, such as this one.

== Staging ==
Traditionally, the set is a single dark hall surrounded by the seven doors around the perimeter. As each door is opened, a stream of symbolically colored light comes forth (except in the case of the sixth door, for which the hall is actually darkened). The symbolic colors of the seven doors are as follows:
# (The torture chamber) Blood-red
# (The armory) Yellowish-red
# (The treasury) Golden
# (The garden) Bluish-green
# (The kingdom) White (the stage directions read: &quot;in a gleaming torrent, the light streams in&quot;, &quot;blue mountains&quot;)
# (The pool of tears) Darkness; the main hall is darkened, as if a shadow had passed over
# (The wives) Silvery (stage directions: &quot;silver like the moon&quot;)

The slow orchestral introduction to the work is preceded by a spoken prologue, also by Balázs, published as &quot;Prologue of the Bard&quot; independently of the play. This poses to the audience the questions &quot;Where is the stage? Is it outside, or inside?&quot; as well as offering a warning to pay careful attention to the events about to unfold. The prologue warns the audience that the morals of the tale can apply to the real world as well as to that of Bluebeard and Judith. The character of the bard (or &quot;regős&quot; in the Hungarian language) is traditional in Hungarian folk music, and the words of the prologue (notably its opening lines &quot;Haj, regő, rejtem&quot;) are associated with traditional Hungarian &quot;regősénekek&quot; (Regős songs), which Bartók had previously studied. The prologue is frequently omitted from performances.

The stage directions call also for occasional ghostly sighs that seemingly emanate from the castle itself when some of the doors are opened. Productions implement these in different ways, sometimes instrumentally, sometimes vocally.

== Music and instrumentation ==
The most salient characteristic of the music from &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot; is the importance of the minor second, an interval whose dissonance is used repeatedly in both slow and fast passages to evoke aching sadness/disquiet or danger/shock respectively. The minor second is referred to as the &#x27;blood&#x27; motif, for it is used whenever Judith notices blood in the castle. Overall the music is not atonal, although it is often polytonal, with more than one key center operating simultaneously (e.g. the leadup to the climactic opening of the fifth door). However, there are some passages (for example, door 3) where the music is tonal and mostly consonant. Many critics have found an overall key plan, as one would find in a tonal piece of music. The opera starts in a mode of F, modulating towards C in the middle of the piece (tonally, the greatest possible distance from F), before returning to F towards the end. The text and setting at these points has suggested to some that the F-C dichotomy represents darkness/light.

The vocal parts are very challenging due to the highly chromatic and speech-rhythm-inflected style that Bartók uses. For non-native speakers, the Hungarian-language libretto can also be difficult to master. These reasons, coupled with the static effect of the stage action, combine to make staged performances of the opera a comparative rarity; it more often appears in concert form.

To support the psychological undertones, Bartók calls for a large orchestra. The instrumentation is as notated below:

4 flutes (3rd and 4th doubling two piccolos), 2 oboes, cor anglais, 3 clarinets in A and B (1st and 2nd doubling two E clarinets, 3rd doubling bass clarinet), 4 bassoons (4th doubling contrabassoon), 4 horns, 4 trumpets in B, 4 trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, side drum, tamtam, cymbals, suspended cymbals, xylophone (originally a keyboard xylophone – now usually played by two players), triangle, 2 harps, celesta, organ, and strings.

In addition, Bartók calls for &quot;Musica di scena&quot; (&#x27;Stage music&#x27;) of an extra 4 trumpets and 4 alto trombones.

==Translations==
The original German translation by Wilhelm Ziegler appears in the 1921 first edition of the vocal score. In 1963 a revised singing translation by Wilhelm Ziegler replaced it. The English translation printed in the 1963 miniature score is by Christopher Hassall. The one in the full score is by Chester Kallman. Another singing translation is that made by John Lloyd Davies for the Scottish Opera in 1989 (in British National Opera Guide No. 44, 1991). A reasonably faithful version in French is that of Natalia and Charles Zaremba (&quot;&quot;, 1992).

In 2023 Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle was staged in Ukrainian translation in Kyiv, but translator&#x27;s name remained unknown.

== Film adaptation ==

<text>Chlorfenvinphos is an organophosphorus compound that was widely used as an insecticide and an acaricide. The molecule itself can be described as an enol ester derived from dichloroacetophenone and diethylphosphoric acid. Chlorfenvinphos has been included in many products since its first use in 1963. However, because of its toxic effect as a cholinesterase inhibitor it has been banned in several countries, including the United States and the European Union. Its use in the United States was discontinued in 1991.

The pure chemical is a colorless solid, but for commercial purposes, it is often marketed as an amber liquid. The insecticides, mostly used in liquid form, contain between 50% and 90% chlorfenvinphos. The substance easily mixes with acetone, ethanol, and propylene glycol. Furthermore, chlorfenvinphos is corrosive to metal and hydrolyzes in the environment.

It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.

==Pesticide use==

===History===
Dermaton was the first registered product containing chlorfenvinphos. It was introduced in the United States in 1963 and was used as an insecticide and acaricide for controlling fleas and ticks on domestic pets and other animals. Between 1963 and 1970, additional uses were registered, including the use as fly spray, surface spray and larvicide. Because of these effects, chlorfenvinphos was often used on farms to control adult flies in dairy barns, milk rooms, poultry houses and yards, and in other animal buildings. Furthermore, it was used to control larval flies in manure storage pits and piles and other refuse accumulation areas around dairies and feedlots. In the early 1980s, chlorfenvinphos was registered for additional uses in a dust formulation for use in dog kennels and in dog collars for the control of fleas and ticks.
Outside the United States, chlorfenvinphos, registered under the trade names Birlane, C8949, CGA 26351, Sapecron, Steladone and Supona, was used as a soil insecticide for controlling root maggots, root worms and cutworms. Chlorfenvinphos was also used against Colorado beetles on potatoes and scale insects and mite eggs on citrus. Furthermore, the compound had the same uses as in the United States.

There is no quantitative information on the total volume of chlorfenvinphos really used as a pesticide in the United States or elsewhere. Since all uses of the chemical in the United States were canceled in 1991, use is likely to have declined, although there are no data showing this trend.

===Regulation and advisories===
No international regulations exist for the use of chlorfenvinphos, although standards and guidelines have been set to protect people from the possible harmful effects of the toxin. No regulation exists for inhalation exposure, but multiple minimal risk levels (MRL) have been estimated for oral exposure. These data have been developed from lowest observed adverse effect levels (LOAEL) in test rats, based on adverse neurological effects. The acute oral MRL has been established at 0.002 mg/kg/day, while the chronic MRL has been established somewhat lower, at 0.0007 mg/kg/day.

Furthermore, chlorfenvinphos is one of the chemicals regulated under “The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know act of 1986”. This means that owners and operators of certain facilities that manufacture, import, process or otherwise use the chemical, are obligated to report their annual release of the chemical to any environmental media.

However, the use of chlorfenvinphos has now been banned in the European Union and in the United States. In Europe it is banned as a plant protection product. An exception is Switzerland, where chlorfenvinphos is still allowed for use in crops and certain vegetables under the brand name Birlane. In Australia, chlorfenvinphos is partially banned. Thus, it was withdrawn in alfalfa, potatoes and mushrooms, while it is still used in veterinary medicine for combating ectoparasites until 2013.

==Production==
Chlorfenvinphos was first introduced in the United States in 1963, by the Shell International Chemical Company Ltd., Ciba AG (now Ciba-Geigy AG) and by Allied Chemical Corporation. Its main use was as an insecticide and acaricide used to control insect pests on livestock and household pests such as flies, fleas, and mites. Since its first application, many manufacturers included chlorfenvinphos in their products. Some common trade names are Birlane, Dermaton, Sapercon, Steladone, and Supona. Since 1991, however, information on current production of chlorfenvinphos has been conflicting. One source lists base producers of the compound as the American Cyanamid Company. However, no producers of chlorfenvinphos were identified in a 1993 Directory of Chemical Producers for the United States of America. Moreover, there have been no registered uses for this compound as a pesticide in the United States since 1995.

Chlorfenvinphos is produced by reaction of triethylphosphite (P(OEt)3) with 2,2,2&quot;,4&quot;-tetrachloro acetophenone (C8H4Cl4O). In the production process, both the Z and E isomers are formed in a ratio (Z:E) of 8.5:1. The technical grade material therefore contains over 92% chlorfenvinphos.

Unfortunately, no data is available in the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) database on total environment releases of this compound from facilities. This is mainly because chlorfenvinphos was not considered a dangerous toxin until the early 1990s. Therefore, chlorfenvinphos is not one of the compounds about which facilities were required to report to the Toxic Release Inventory.

==Toxicokinetics==
Chlorfenvinphos is most commonly absorbed into the body through either ingestion of food products that have been treated with the pesticide, or through dermal absorption, though the latter is much less efficient.

Once absorbed, chlorfenvinphos is widely distributed throughout the body, and has been detected in a variety of bodily fluids. However, as an organophosphorus compound, it does not accumulate well in tissues.

The first and most important step of metabolism of chlorfenvinphos in humans is accomplished by the enzyme cytochrome P450 in liver microsomes. This enzyme facilitates oxidative dealkylation of the compound to acetaldehyde and 2-chloro-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl) vinylethylhydrogen phosphate, the latter of which quickly breaks down to acetophenone. Acetophenone is then reduced to an alcohol and conjugated by glutathione transferases.,

Excretion of chlorfenvinphos is fairly rapid. In rats, an administered dose is excreted in 4 days, mostly in urine.

==Mechanism of toxicity==
The toxicity of chlorfenvinphos is primarily caused by its inhibition of cholinesterase activity. Chlorfenvinphos reacts with the acetylcholine binding sites of enzymes that hydrolyze acetylcholine, thereby preventing their catalysis of this reaction. The reaction itself is a phosphorylation, which is reversible. The phosphorylated enzymes can undergo conformational changes and additional reactions however, which prevent the dephosphorylation. This “aging” results in irreversible inhibition of the cholinesterase.

Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter in the nervous system, it targets muscarinic and nicotinic receptors and receptors in the central nervous system. These receptors are used to pass on an action potential across the synaptic cleft between neurons. Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase enzymes results in the accumulation of acetylcholine at its receptors. This leads to continuous or excessive stimulation of neurons that respond to acetylcholine. Cholinergic poisoning leads to different symptoms, depending on the part of the nervous system that is affected. The most likely cause of death in chlorfenvinphos is respiratory failure due to paralysis and bronchoconstriction.

==Toxicity==

===Toxic effects===
The toxic effects of accumulation of acetylcholine can be divided into three categories, based upon its actions in different parts of the nervous system. Muscarinic receptors that respond to acetylcholine are found in smooth muscles, the heart and exocrine glands. The muscarinic symptoms of cholinergic poisoning are therefore tightness in the chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, bradycardia, miosis, increased salivation, lacrimation and sweating and increased peristalsis, which leads to nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.

Nicotinic receptors responding to acetylcholine can be found in skeletal muscle and the autonomic ganglia. The nicotinic symptoms of cholinergic poisoning are therefore fatigue, involuntary twitching, muscular weakness, hypertension and hyperglycemia.

Symptoms of accumulation of acetylcholine in the central nervous system are diverse and include tension, anxiety, ataxia, convulsions, depression of the respiratory and circulatory centers and coma.

===Acute toxicity===
The acute toxicity of chlorfenvinphos varies widely between species. Oral LD50 values range from 9.6–39 mg/kg in rats to &gt;12,000 mg/kg in dogs.
Though no direct data on the acute toxicity in humans is available, an &quot;in vitro&quot; study of the detoxification of chlorfenvinphos has shown that human liver enzymes were almost as effective as those of rabbits, who have an oral LD50 of 412-4,700 mg/kg.,

===Long-term toxicity===
Prolonged exposure to chlorfenvinphos has been observed to decrease plasma and erythrocyte cholinesterase activity in humans. No significant genotoxicity, carcinogenicity or teratogenicity has been reported. On the basis of a NOAEL of 0.05 mg/kg observed in rats, an acceptable daily intake for humans of 0.0005 mg/kg has been established.

==Biomarkers==

===Biomarkers of exposure===
Traces of unchanged chlorfenvinphos and its polar metabolites can be detected in animals, which have been exposed to chlorfenvinphos. These small amounts can be used to prove that chlorfenvinphos exposure has occurred and the method of analysis is non-invasive.

Another method to assess chlorfenvinphos exposure is to measure the activity of cholinesterases in the blood. Two pools of cholinesterases exist in the blood: acetylcholinesterase in erythrocytes and pseudocholinesterase in plasma. The acetylcholinesterase in erythrocytes is identical to the acetylcholinesterase found in neuromuscular tissue. The function of plasma pseudocholinesterase is unknown, but its activity is considered to be a more sensitive biomarker for organophosphate exposure than erythrocyte cholinesterase activity. The inhibition of the individual cholinesterases or the inhibition of their combined activity can be used as a marker of exposure. However, cholinesterase inhibition is caused by all anticholinesterase compounds and is therefore not a specific biomarker for chlorfenvinphos. In addition, the activity of cholinesterases in the blood varies in populations and there are no studies which have measured a correlation between chlorfenvinphos exposure and cholinesterase inhibition. There have been suggestions that chlorfenvinphos or its metabolites would be a better biomarker of exposure than its cholinesterase activity inhibition.

===Biomarkers of effect===
In combination with analysis of reductions in cholinesterase activity in the blood, symptoms of organophosphate poisoning can be used to identify victims of organophosphate poisoning. These symptoms are not specific for chlorfenvinphos, but for anticholinesterase compounds in general.

==Treatments of exposure==

Ingestion of chlorfenvinphos, either by accident or through suicidal intent, can be treated as with other acute organophosphate poisonings. This includes a combination of three approaches:
# Administration of an anticholinergic such as atropine, considered an antidote;
# Administration of a cholinesterase reactivator, in the pyridinium oxime family, usually pralidoxime;
# Administration of anticonvulsants, e.g. benzodiazepines (of which diazepam is most effective).

The efficacy of oxime treatment is controversial. Ingestion of organophosphates as residues on food rarely reaches clinically relevant doses.

<doc id="775985" wikidata="Q840407" url="?curid=775985" title="Enthusiasm">
<text>In modern usage, enthusiasm refers to intense enjoyment, interest, or approval expressed by a person. The term is related to playfulness, inventiveness, optimism, zest, verve, and high energy. The word was originally used to refer to a person possessed by God, or someone who exhibited intense piety.

==Historical usage==

The word &quot;enthusiasm&quot; originates from the Greek from (, “in”) and (, “god”), meaning &quot;inspired or possessed by [a] god&quot;. Applied by the Greeks to manifestations of divine possession, by Apollo (as in the case of the Pythia), or by Dionysus (as in the case of the Bacchantes and Maenads), the term enthusiasm was also used in a transferred or figurative sense. Socrates taught that the inspiration of poets is a form of enthusiasm. The term was confined to a belief in religious inspiration, or to intense religious fervor or emotion.

From this, a Syrian sect of the fourth century was known as the Enthusiasts. They believed that &quot;by perpetual prayer, ascetic practices, and contemplation, man could become inspired by the Holy Spirit, in spite of the ruling evil spirit, which the fall had given to him&quot;. From their belief in the efficacy of prayer, they were also known as Euchites.

Several Protestant Christian denominations that emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries, especially those who hold revivals, were called enthusiastic.

=== Pejorative use ===
During the years that immediately followed the Glorious Revolution, &quot;enthusiasm&quot; was a British pejorative term for advocacy of any political or religious cause in public, i.e. fanaticism. Such &quot;enthusiasm&quot; was seen in the time around 1700 as the cause of the previous century&#x27;s English Civil War and its attendant atrocities, and thus it was an absolute social sin to remind others of the war by engaging in enthusiasm. The Royal Society bylaws stipulated that any person discussing religion or politics at a Society meeting was to be summarily ejected for being an &quot;enthusiast.&quot;

During the 18th century, popular Methodists such as John Wesley or George Whitefield were accused of blind enthusiasm, a charge against which they defended themselves by distinguishing fanaticism from &quot;religion of the heart.&quot; Methodists who enthusiastically preach about and experience the new birth (first work of grace) and entire sanctification (second work of grace) often have emotional experiences.

<text>Cyclopædia: or, an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences is a British encyclopedia prepared by Ephraim Chambers and first published in 1728. Six more editions appeared between 1728 and 1751, and there was a &quot;Supplement&quot; in 1753. The &quot;Cyclopædia&quot; was one of the first general encyclopedias produced in English.

==Noteworthy features==
The title page of the first edition summarizes the author’s aims:
The first edition included numerous cross-references meant to connect articles scattered by the use of alphabetical order, a dedication to the king, George II, and a philosophical preface at the beginning of Volume 1. Among other things, the preface gives an analysis of forty-seven divisions of knowledge, with classed lists of the articles belonging to each, intended to serve as a table of contents and also as a directory indicating the order in which the articles should be read.

==Printing history==
A second edition appeared in 1738 in two volumes in folio, with 2,466 pages. This edition was supposedly retouched and amended in a thousand places, with a few added articles and some enlarged articles. Chambers was prevented from doing more because booksellers were alarmed by a bill in Parliament containing a clause to oblige publishers of all improved editions of books to print their improvements separately. The bill, after passing the House of Commons, was unexpectedly thrown out by the House of Lords; but fearing that it might be revived, the booksellers thought it best to retreat, though more than twenty sheets had been printed.

Five other editions were published in London from 1739 to 1751–1752. An edition was also published in Dublin in 1742; this and the London editions were all two volumes in folio. An Italian translation appearing in Venice, 1748–1749, 4to, nine volumes, was the first complete Italian encyclopaedia. When Chambers was in France in 1739, he rejected very favorable proposals to publish an edition there dedicated to Louis XV.

Chambers&#x27; work was carefully done and popular. However, it had defects and omissions, as he was well aware; by his death on 15 May 1740, he had collected and arranged materials for seven new volumes. George Lewis Scott was employed by the booksellers to select articles for the press and to supply others, but he left before the job was finished. The job was then given to John Hill. The &quot;Supplement&quot; was published in London in 1753 in two folio volumes with 3307 pages and 12 plates. Hill was a botanist, and the botanical part, which had been weak in the &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot;, was the best.

Abraham Rees, a nonconformist minister, published a revised and enlarged edition in 1778–1788, with the supplement and improvements incorporated. It was published in London as a folio of five volumes, 5,010 pages ( not paginated), and 159 plates. It was published in 418 numbers at 6d. each. Rees claimed to have added more than 4,400 new articles. At the end, he gave an index of articles, classed under 100 heads, numbering about 57,000 and filling 80 pages. The heads, with 39 cross references, were arranged alphabetically.

==Precursors ==

Among the precursors of Chambers&#x27;s &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot; was John Harris&#x27;s &quot;Lexicon Technicum&quot; of 1704 (later editions from 1708 to 1744). By its title and content, it was &quot;An Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves.&quot; While Harris&#x27;s work is often classified as a technical dictionary, it also took material from Newton and Halley, among others.

== Successors ==

Chambers&#x27;s &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot; in turn became the inspiration for the landmark &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert, which owed its inception to a proposed French translation of Chambers&#x27;s work begun in 1744 by John Mills, assisted by Gottfried Sellius. The later &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Encyclopaedia&quot; (1860–1868) had no connection to Ephraim Chambers&#x27;s work but was the product of Robert Chambers and his brother William.

<doc id="776006" wikidata="Q1025090" url="?curid=776006" title="Caddoan languages">
<text>The Caddoan languages are a family of languages native to the Great Plains spoken by tribal groups of the central United States, from present-day North Dakota south to Oklahoma. All Caddoan languages are critically endangered, as the number of speakers has declined markedly due to colonial legacy, lack of support, and other factors.

==Family division==
Five languages belong to the Caddoan language family:
* Caddoan languages
** Caddo (2 speakers)
** Northern Caddoan
*** Wichita 
*** Pawnee–Kitsai
**** Kitsai 
**** Pawnee–Arikara
***** Pawnee (10 speakers)
***** Arikara (10 speakers)
Kitsai and Wichita have no speakers left. Kitsai stopped being spoken in the 19th century when its members were absorbed into the Wichita tribe. Wichita stopped being spoken in 2016, when the last native speaker of Wichita, Doris McLemore (who left recordings and language materials), died.

All of the remaining Caddoan languages spoken today are severely endangered. As of 2007, both the Pawnee and Arikara languages only had 10 speakers, with the Caddo language only spoken by 2 (as of 2023). Caddo and Pawnee are spoken in Oklahoma by small numbers of tribal elders. Arikara is spoken on the Fort Berthold Reservation in North Dakota.

Prior to colonization and US expansion, speakers of Caddoan languages were more widespread. The Caddo, for example, lived in northeastern Texas, southwestern Arkansas, and northwestern Louisiana, as well as southeastern Oklahoma. The Pawnee formerly lived along the Platte River in what is now Nebraska.

==Prehistory==

Glottochronology is a controversial method of reconstructing, in broad detail, the history of a language and its relationships, though it may still provide useful insights and generalizations regarding a family&#x27;s history. In the case of Proto-Caddoan, it appeared to have divided into two branches, Northern and Southern, more than 3000 years ago (The division of the language implies also a geographic and/or political separation).

South Caddoan, or Caddo proper, evolved in north-eastern Texas and adjacent Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana. Other than Caddo, no daughter languages are known, but some unrecorded ones likely existed in the 16th and the 17th centuries.

Northern Caddoan evolved into several different languages. The language that became Wichita, with several different dialects, branched off about 2000 years ago. Kitsai separated from the Northern Caddoan stem about 1200 years ago, and Pawnee and Arikara separated 300 to 500 years ago.

==External relations==
Adai, a language isolate from Louisiana is known only from a 275-word list collected in 1804, and may be a Caddoan language, however documentation is too scanty to determine with certainty. Adjacent to the Caddo lived the Eyeish or Ais—not to be confused with the Ais of Florida—who also spoke a language that may have been related to Caddoan. 

Some linguists believe that the Caddoan, Iroquoian, and Siouan languages may be connected in a Macro-Siouan language family, but their work is suggestive and the theory remains hypothetical. Similar attempts to find a connection with the Algonquian languages have been inconclusive. There is insufficient evidence for linguists to propose a hypothetical Macro-Algonquian/Iroquoian language family.

==Reconstruction==
Some Proto-Northern Caddoan reconstructions by Chafe (1979):

For Proto-Caddoan, Chafe (1979) reconstructs the following phonemes.
*stops: /p t k/
*affricate: /ts/ 
*spirant: /s/
*resonants: /w n r/ and /j/ 
*laryngeals: /ʔ h/
*vowels: /i a u/

==Vocabulary==
Below is a list of basic vocabulary of Northern Caddoan languages from Parks (1979):

<text>Dariusz Kajetan Rosati (born 8 August 1946 as Gaetano Dario Rosati) is a Polish professor of economics and a politician who served as a member of the European Parliament from 2004–2009 and 2014-2019, and a deputy of the Sejm from 2011-2014 and 2019-2023.

==Biography==
===Academic===
Dariusz Rosati graduated from the Faculty of International Trade at the SGH Warsaw School of Economics in 1969 and immediately afterwards started working there as an assistant. In 1973 he defended his doctoral thesis and in 1978 he received his &quot;habilitacja&quot; in economic sciences. He has been a professor of economics since 1990.

He is a supporter of a united Europe, the author of numerous publications on European integration and the rector of Lazarski School of Commerce and Law in Warsaw (&quot;).

From 1966–1990 he was a member of Polish United Workers Party (PZPR) and in the 1980s he was an economic adviser to Mieczysław Rakowski&#x27;s government, the last such government of the communist Polish People&#x27;s Republic (PRL). In the 1990s he was a supporter (but not a member) of the post-communist parties, first Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), and today Social Democratic Party of Poland (SDPL).

Dariusz Rosati was a co-founder and director of the Global Economy Institute (Instytut Gospodarki Światowej) and the Institute of Economic Situations and Prices (Instytut Koniunktur i Cen). He worked as an expert in various international organisations, including the Economic Commission for Europe of the United Nations in Geneva and adviser to the Chairman of the European Commission in Brussels.

In 2014 he was once more elected to the European Parliament and joined the European People&#x27;s Party Group (EPP Group). He represented the Lubuskie Region as well as Western Pomerania. He was a member of the ECON Committee as well as the PANA Committee, where he also served at the EPP&#x27;s Coordinator.

In 2009 he founded Alliance for the Future, however the party was very short-lived.

In 2019, after failing to be re-elected as a MEP, he was subsequently elected as a deputy of the Sejm for the Civic Platform (PO) in constituency No. 19 Warsaw with 25,061 votes. In 2021, he became a full member of the Civic Platform, having co-operated with said party since 2011.

===Alleged collaboration with communist secret service===
In November 2007, the Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) said that Dariusz Rosati was registered as a secret collaborator &quot;candidate&quot; and &quot;protection&quot; by the Ministry of Interior I Department and II Department. Later on he was registered as an operational contact. However, in July 2007 Dariusz Rosati has made a statement in which he denied that cooperation went beyond sporadic contacts. His vetting (lustracja) declaration was approved by the Ombudsman of the Public Interest and prosecutor of the IPN. Thus he was not a secret collaborator at any time during his life.

==Personal life==
Dariusz Rosati&#x27;s father, the Italian-born Angelo, was held as a prisoner of war in Poland during World War II, and after the war briefly settled in Łódź. His mother, Wanda, worked as a forced labourer in Nazi Germany. His parents divorced shortly after his birth, and his father left for France. When Rosati was ten years old, his mother renounced his Italian citizenship on his behalf, and also Polonised and rearranged his name.

Rosati met his future wife Teresa (born 1946) while studying at university, and married in 1971. They have two children, a son (Marcin) and a daughter (Weronika).

<text>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling. It is the seventh and final novel in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. It was released on 21 July 2007 in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury Publishing, in the United States by Scholastic, and in Canada by Raincoast Books. The novel chronicles the events directly following &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; (2005) and the final confrontation between the wizards Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort.

&quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; shattered sales records upon release, surpassing marks set by previous titles of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. It holds the Guinness World Record for most novels sold within 24 hours of release, with 8.3 million sold in the US and 2.65 million in the UK. Reception to the book was generally positive, and the American Library Association named it a &quot;Best Book for Young Adults&quot;.

A film adaptation of the novel was released in two parts: &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot; in November 2010 and &quot;Part 2&quot; in July 2011.

==Plot==
The young wizard Harry Potter is about to turn seventeen and therefore lose the protective magic shield his mother&#x27;s sacrifice gave him. He is being escorted to The Burrow by members of the Order of the Phoenix when the group is attacked by Death Eaters, who kill &quot;Mad-Eye&quot; Moody and injure George Weasley. Lord Voldemort attempts to kill Harry but fails. 

Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger begin searching for Voldemort&#x27;s four remaining Horcruxes. They learn that the locket Horcrux is in the possession of Dolores Umbridge at the Ministry of Magic. Harry and his friends infiltrate the Ministry and steal the locket from Umbridge, but are unable to destroy it. The locket&#x27;s Dark magic affects Ron, who abandons Harry and Hermione. In Godric&#x27;s Hollow, Harry and Hermione are attacked by Voldemort&#x27;s snake Nagini, but manage to escape. One night, a Patronus guides Harry to a pond containing the Sword of Gryffindor. When he tries to recover it, the locket tightens around his neck, nearly drowning him. Ron returns and saves Harry, then destroys the Horcrux with the sword.

The three friends visit Xenophilius Lovegood, who tells them of the mythical objects known as the Deathly Hallows: the Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Cloak of Invisibility. Xenophilius then alerts the Ministry of Magic to the presence of the trio in his home, but Harry and his friends escape. Soon after, they are captured by Snatchers, bounty hunters hired by Voldemort, and imprisoned in Malfoy Manor. Harry and Ron are thrown into the cellar with Dean Thomas, Luna Lovegood, Mr Ollivander and Griphook the goblin, while the Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange tortures Hermione for information. The house-elf Dobby helps all seven prisoners escape, but is killed in the process. 

After a brief stay at Bill and Fleur’s cottage, Harry, Ron and Hermione break into Gringotts Bank and retrieve another Horcrux from the vault of Bellatrix Lestrange. Harry has visions which inform him that another Horcrux is hidden at Hogwarts. After the trio enters the school with the help of Aberforth Dumbledore, Voldemort prepares to assault the castle. As the Death Eaters enter the school and fight the professors and students, Ron and Hermione destroy the Horcrux from Gringotts. They then accompany Harry to the Room of Requirement, where they discover the next Horcrux which is the Diadem of Ravenclaw. Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle ambush them, and Crabbe casts a powerful fire spell which grows out of his control and kills both him and the Horcrux.

After stealing the Elder Wand from Albus Dumbledore&#x27;s tomb, Voldemort is unable to make it obey him. Believing that Severus Snape is the master of the wand, Voldemort uses Nagini to mortally wound him, seemingly transferring ownership of the wand to Voldemort. Before dying, Snape passes his memories to Harry, who views them in the Pensieve. The memories reveal that Snape loved Harry&#x27;s mother, and acted as a double agent against Voldemort in an attempt to protect her. Dumbledore had learned he was dying, and decided to plan his own death at the hands of Snape so that Snape could gain Voldemort&#x27;s trust. The memories also reveal that Harry himself accidentally became a Horcrux when Voldemort first tried to kill him. Now, Harry must die to render Voldemort mortal. On his way to surrender himself to Voldemort, Harry instructs Neville Longbottom to destroy Voldemort&#x27;s final Horcrux, Nagini. He also uses the Resurrection Stone to communicate with four deceased loved ones: his parents, Sirius Black, and Remus Lupin, one last time.

Voldemort casts the Killing Curse on Harry, who then awakens in a dreamlike version of King&#x27;s Cross Station. He is greeted by Dumbledore, who explains that the curse destroyed the fragment of Voldemort&#x27;s soul inside Harry, and that Harry can now return to life. Harry subsequently regains consciousness and pretends to be dead. Voldemort orders Hagrid to carry Harry&#x27;s body back to Hogwarts, and demands that the professors and students surrender. Neville, however, pulls the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat and kills Nagini, Voldemort&#x27;s last Horcrux, rendering him mortal. The battle resumes, during which Molly Weasley kills Bellatrix. Harry reveals himself to be alive and duels with Voldemort, who casts another Killing Curse. However, the Elder Wand refuses to kill Harry, because Harry is its true master: Draco disarmed Dumbledore, the original owner, and Harry later disarmed Draco, transferring ownership to himself. This causes Voldemort&#x27;s spell to rebound and kill him.

In the novel&#x27;s epilogue, set nineteen years later, Harry and his friends see their children off to Hogwarts. Harry and Ginny, now married, have three children: James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna. Ron and Hermione have a daughter named Rose and a son named Hugo.

==Background==
===Series===
The first novel in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, was published by Bloomsbury in 1997. It was followed by &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; (1998), &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; (1999), &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; (2000), &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; (2003) and &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot; (2005).

=== Title ===
The title of the novel refers to three mythical objects featured in the story, which are collectively known as the &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;. Rowling announced the title in December 2006 through a Christmas-themed hangman puzzle on her website. Other titles that Rowling considered were &quot;Harry Potter and the Elder Wand&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Peverell Quest&quot;.

===Writing===

Rowling completed the novel in January 2007 while staying at the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh. In a statement on her website, she said, &quot;I&#x27;ve never felt such a mixture of extreme emotions in my life, never dreamed I could feel simultaneously heartbroken and euphoric.&quot; She compared her mixed feelings to those expressed by Charles Dickens in the preface of the 1850 edition of &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, &quot;a two-years&#x27; imaginative task&quot;. &quot;To which,&quot; she added, &quot;I can only sigh, try seventeen years, Charles&quot;. She ended her message by saying &quot;&quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; is my favourite, and that is the most wonderful way to finish the series&quot;.

When asked before publication about the forthcoming book, Rowling stated that she could not change the ending even if she wanted. &quot;These books have been plotted for such a long time, and for six books now, that they&#x27;re all leading a certain direction. So, I really can&#x27;t&quot;. She also commented that the final volume related closely to the previous book in the series, &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, &quot;almost as though they are two-halves of the same novel&quot;. She said the last chapter of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; was written around 1990 as part of her earliest work on the series. She also revealed that the last sentence was originally something akin to &quot;Only those who he loved could see his lightning scar&quot;. She changed the sentence to &quot;All was well&quot; because she wanted it to be clear that Harry had triumphed over Voldemort and that he would not have to face him again.

==Release==
===Marketing and promotion===
The launch of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; was celebrated by an all-night book signing and reading by Rowling at the Natural History Museum in London. The 1,700 guests in attendance were chosen by ballot. Rowling toured the United States in October 2007, where another event was held at Carnegie Hall in New York City with tickets allocated by sweepstake.

Scholastic, the American publisher of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, launched a multimillion-dollar &quot;There will soon be 7&quot; marketing campaign with a Knight Bus travelling to 40 libraries across the United States, online fan discussions and competitions, collectible bookmarks, tattoos, and the staged release of seven &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; questions most debated by fans.

Rowling arranged with her publishers for a poster bearing the face of the missing British child Madeleine McCann to be made available to book sellers when &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; was launched on 21 July 2007, and said that she hoped that the posters would be displayed prominently in shops all over the world.

After it was announced that the novel would be released on 21 July 2007, Warner Bros. stated that the film adaptation of &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; would be released on 13 July. In response, fans proclaimed July 2007 as the month of &quot;Harry Potter&quot;.

===Spoiler embargo===
Bloomsbury invested £10 million in an attempt to keep the book&#x27;s contents secure until 21 July, the release date. Arthur Levine, US editor of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, denied distributing any copies of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; in advance for press review, but two US papers published early reviews anyway. There was speculation that some shops would break the embargo and distribute copies of the book early, as the penalty imposed for previous instalments—that the distributor would not be supplied with any further copies of the series—would no longer be a deterrent.

===Online leaks and early delivery===
In the week before its release, a number of texts purporting to be genuine leaks appeared in various forms. On 16 July, a set of photographs representing all 759 pages of the US edition was leaked and was fully transcribed prior to the official release date. The photographs later appeared on websites and peer-to-peer networks, leading Scholastic to seek a subpoena in order to identify one source. This represented the most serious security breach in the Harry Potter series&#x27; history. Rowling and her lawyer confirmed that there were genuine online leaks. Reviews published in both &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; on 18 July 2007, corroborated many of the plot elements from this leak, and about one day prior to release, &quot;The New York Times&quot; confirmed that the main circulating leak was real.

Scholastic announced that approximately one-ten-thousandth (0.0001) of the US supply had been shipped early — interpreted to mean about 1,200 copies. One reader in Maryland received a copy of the book in the mail from DeepDiscount.com four days before it was launched, which evoked incredulous responses from both Scholastic and DeepDiscount. Scholastic initially reported that they were satisfied it had been a &quot;human error&quot; and would not discuss possible penalties; however, the following day Scholastic announced that it would be launching legal action against DeepDiscount.com and its distributor, Levy Home Entertainment. Scholastic filed for damages in Chicago&#x27;s Circuit Court of Cook County, claiming that DeepDiscount engaged in a &quot;complete and flagrant violation of the agreements that they knew were part of the carefully constructed release of this eagerly awaited book.&quot; Some of the early-release books soon appeared on eBay, in one case being sold to &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; for US$250 from an initial price of US$18.

===Price wars and other controversies===
Asda, along with several other UK supermarkets, having already taken pre-orders for the book at a heavily discounted price, sparked a price war two days before the book&#x27;s launch by announcing they would sell it for just £5 a copy. Other retail chains then also offered the book at discounted prices. At these prices the book became a loss leader. This caused uproar from traditional UK booksellers who argued they had no hope of competing in those conditions. Independent shops protested loudest, but even Waterstone&#x27;s, the UK&#x27;s largest dedicated chain bookstore, could not compete with the supermarket price. Some small bookstores hit back by buying their stock from the supermarkets rather than their wholesalers. Asda attempted to counter this by imposing a limit of two copies per customer to prevent bulk purchases. Philip Wicks, a spokesman for the UK Booksellers Association, said, &quot;It is a war we can&#x27;t even participate in. We think it&#x27;s a crying shame that the supermarkets have decided to treat it as a loss-leader, like a can of baked beans.&quot; Michael Norris, an analyst at Simba Information, said: &quot;You are not only lowering the price of the book. At this point, you are lowering the value of reading.&quot;

In Malaysia, a similar price war caused controversy regarding sales of the book. Four of the biggest bookstore chains in Malaysia, MPH Bookstores, Popular Bookstores, Times and Harris, decided to pull &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; off their shelves as a protest against Tesco and Carrefour hypermarkets. The retail price of the book in Malaysia was MYR 109.90, while the hypermarkets Tesco and Carrefour sold the book at MYR 69.90. The move by the bookstores was seen as an attempt to pressure the distributor Penguin Books to remove the books from the hypermarkets. However, as of 24 July 2007, the price war had ended, with the four bookstores involved resuming selling the books in their stores with discount. Penguin Books has also confirmed that Tesco and Carrefour were selling the book at a loss, urging them to practise good business sense and fair trade.

The book&#x27;s early Saturday morning release in Israel was criticised for violating Shabbat. Trade and Industry Minister Eli Yishai commented &quot;It is forbidden, according to Jewish values and Jewish culture, that a thing like this should take place at 2 am on Saturday. Let them do it on another day.&quot; Yishai indicated that he would issue indictments and fines based on the Hours of Work and Rest Law.

===Editions===
&quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; was released in hardcover on 21 July 2007 and in paperback in the United Kingdom on 10 July 2008 and the United States on 7 July 2009. In SoHo, New York, there was a release party for the American paperback edition, with many games and activities. An &quot;Adult Edition&quot; with a different cover illustration was released by Bloomsbury on 21 July 2007. To be released simultaneously with the original US hardcover on 21 July with only 100,000 copies was a Scholastic deluxe edition, highlighting a new cover illustration by Mary GrandPré. In October 2010, Bloomsbury released a &quot;Celebratory&quot; paperback edition, which featured a foiled and starred cover. Lastly, on 1 November 2010, a &quot;Signature&quot; edition of the novel was released in paperback by Bloomsbury.

===Translations===

As with previous books in the series, &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; has been translated into many languages. The first translation to be released was the Ukrainian translation, on 25 September 2007 (as &quot;Гаррі Поттер і смертельні реліквії&quot; – &quot;Harry Potter i smertel&#x27;ni relikviji&quot;). The Swedish title of the book was revealed by Rowling as &quot;Harry Potter and the Relics of Death&quot; (&quot;Harry Potter och Dödsrelikerna&quot;), following a pre-release question from the Swedish publisher about the difficulty of translating the two words &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; without having read the book. This is also the title used for the French translation (&quot;Harry Potter et les reliques de la mort&quot;), the Spanish translation (&quot;Harry Potter y las Reliquias de la Muerte&quot;), the Dutch translation (&quot;Harry Potter en de Relieken van de Dood&quot;), the Serbian translation (&quot;Хари Потер и реликвије смрти&quot; – &quot; Hari Poter i relikvije smrti&quot;) and the Brazilian Portuguese translation (&quot;Harry Potter e as Relíquias da Morte&quot;). The first Polish translation was released with a new title: &quot;Harry Potter i Insygnia Śmierci&quot; – &quot;Harry Potter and the Insignia of Death&quot;. The Hindi translation &quot;Harry Potter aur Maut ke Tohfe&quot; (), which means &quot;Harry Potter and the Gifts of Death&quot;, was released by Manjul Publication in India on 27 June 2008. The Romanian version was released on 1 December 2007 using the title (&quot;Harry Potter și Talismanele Morții&quot;).

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Upon release, &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; was generally well-received. On Metacritic, the book received a 83 out of 100 based on 16 critic reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. &quot;The Bookseller&quot; reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of &quot;Top form&quot;, &quot;Flawed but worth a read&quot;, and &quot;Disappointing&quot;: &quot;Daily Express&quot;, &quot;Guardian&quot;, &quot;Independent&quot;, &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; reviews under &quot;Top form&quot;. &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; critic, Mary Carole McCauley, noted that the book was more serious than the previous novels in the series and had more straightforward prose. Furthermore, reviewer Alice Fordham from &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Rowling&#x27;s genius is not just her total realisation of a fantasy world, but the quieter skill of creating characters that bounce off the page, real and flawed and brave and lovable&quot;. Fordham concluded, &quot;We have been a long way together, and neither Rowling nor Harry let us down in the end&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; writer Michiko Kakutani agreed, praising Rowling&#x27;s ability to make Harry both a hero and a character that can be related to.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Lev Grossman named it one of the Top 10 Fiction Books of 2007, ranking it at No. 8, and praised Rowling for proving that books can still be a global mass medium. Novelist Elizabeth Hand criticised that &quot;... the spectacularly complex interplay of narrative and character often reads as though an entire trilogy&#x27;s worth of summing-up has been crammed into one volume.&quot; In a starred review from &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;, the reviewer said, &quot;Rowling has shown uncommon skill in playing them with and against each other, and also woven them into a darn good bildungsroman, populated by memorable characters and infused with a saving, irrepressible sense of fun&quot;. They also praised the second half of the novel, but criticised the epilogue, calling it &quot;provocatively sketchy&quot;. In another review from &quot;The Times&quot;, reviewer Amanda Craig said that while Rowling was &quot;not an original, high-concept author&quot;, she was &quot;right up there with other greats of children&#x27;s fiction&quot;. Craig went on to say that the novel was &quot;beautifully judged, and a triumphant return to form&quot;, and that Rowling&#x27;s imagination changed the perception of an entire generation, which &quot;is more than all but a handful of living authors, in any genre, have achieved in the past half-century&quot;.

In contrast, Jenny Sawyer of &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; said that, &quot;There is much to love about the Harry Potter series, from its brilliantly realised magical world to its multilayered narrative&quot;, however, &quot;A story is about someone who changes. And, puberty aside, Harry doesn&#x27;t change much. As envisioned by Rowling, he walks the path of good so unwaveringly that his final victory over Voldemort feels, not just inevitable, but hollow&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Christopher Hitchens compared the series to World War Two-era English boarding school stories, and while he wrote that &quot;Rowling has won imperishable renown&quot; for the series as a whole, he also stated that he disliked Rowling&#x27;s use of deus ex machina, that the mid-book camping chapters are &quot;abysmally long&quot;, and Voldemort &quot;becomes more tiresome than an Ian Fleming villain&quot;. Catherine Bennett of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised Rowling for putting small details from the previous books and making them large in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, such as Grindelwald being mentioned on a Chocolate Frog Card in the first book. While she points out &quot;as her critics say, Rowling is no Dickens&quot;, she says that Rowling &quot;has willed into a fictional being, in every book, legions of new characters, places, spells, rules and scores of unimagined twists and subplots&quot;.

Stephen King criticised the reactions of some reviewers to the books, including McCauley, for jumping too quickly to surface conclusions of the work. He felt this was inevitable, because of the extreme secrecy before launch which did not allow reviewers time to read and consider the book, but meant that many early reviews lacked depth. Rather than finding the writing style disappointing, he felt it had matured and improved. He acknowledged that the subject matter of the books had become more adult, and that Rowling had clearly been writing with the adult audience firmly in mind since the middle of the series. He compared the works in this respect to &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; and &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; which achieved success and have become established classics, in part by appealing to the adult audience as well as children.

===Sales===

Sales for &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; were record-setting. The initial US print run for &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; was 12 million copies, and more than a million were pre-ordered through Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble, 500 per cent higher than pre-sales had been for &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;. On 12 April 2007, Barnes &amp; Noble declared that &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; had broken its pre-order record, with more than 500,000 copies pre-ordered through its site. On opening day, a record 8.3 million copies were sold in the United States (over 96 per second), and 2.65 million copies in the United Kingdom. It holds the Guinness World record for fastest selling book of fiction in 24 hours for US sales. At WH Smith, sales reportedly reached a rate of 15 books sold per second. By June 2008, nearly a year after it was published, worldwide sales were reportedly around 44 million.

===Awards and honours===
&quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; has won several awards. In 2007, the book was named one of &quot;The New York Times&quot; 100 Notable Books, and one of its Notable Children&#x27;s Books. The novel was named the best book of 2007, by &quot;Newsweek&quot; critic Malcolm Jones. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; also listed &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; among their Best Books of 2007. Also in 2007 the book received the Andre Norton Award for Young Adult Science Fiction and Fantasy at the Nebula Awards. In 2008, the American Library Association named the novel one of its Best Books for Young Adults, and also listed it as a Notable Children&#x27;s Book. Furthermore, &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; received the 2008 Colorado Blue Spruce Book Award.

==Themes==
===Death===
In a 2006 interview, Rowling said that the main theme of the series is Harry dealing with death, which was influenced by her mother&#x27;s death in 1990. Lev Grossman of &quot;Time&quot; asserted that the main theme of the series is the importance of continuing to love in the face of death.

===Living in a corrupted society===
Academics and journalists have developed many other interpretations of themes in the books, some more complex than others, and some including political subtexts. Themes such as normality, oppression, survival, and overcoming imposing odds have all been considered as prevalent throughout the series. Similarly, the theme of making one&#x27;s way through adolescence and &quot;going over one&#x27;s most harrowing ordeals—and thus coming to terms with them&quot; has also been considered. Rowling has stated that the books comprise &quot;a prolonged argument for tolerance, a prolonged plea for an end to bigotry&quot; and that also pass on a message to &quot;question authority and ... not assume that the establishment or the press tells you all of the truth&quot;. Timothy Snyder in his 2017 book &quot;On Tyranny&quot; mentioned the novel as a recent example illustrating resistance to totalitarianism.

===Christian allegories===
The &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series has been criticised for supposedly supporting witchcraft and the occult. Before publication of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, Rowling refused to speak out about her religion, stating, &quot;If I talk too freely, every reader, whether 10 or 60, will be able to guess what&#x27;s coming in the books&quot;. However, many have commented on Christian allegories that appear in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;. For example, Harry dies and then comes back to life to save mankind, like Christ. The location where this occurs is King&#x27;s Cross. Rowling also stated that &quot;my belief and my struggling with religious belief ... I think is quite apparent in this book&quot;, which is shown as Harry struggles with his faith in Dumbledore.

&quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; begins with a pair of epigraphs, one by Quaker leader William Penn and one from Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;The Libation Bearers&quot;. Of this, Rowling said &quot;I really enjoyed choosing those two quotations because one is pagan, of course, and one is from a Christian tradition. I&#x27;d known it was going to be those two passages since &quot;Chamber&quot; was published. I always knew [that] if I could use them at the beginning of book seven then I&#x27;d cued up the ending perfectly. If they were relevant, then I went where I needed to go. They just say it all to me, they really do&quot;.

When Harry visits his parents&#x27; grave, the biblical reference &quot;The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death&quot; (1 Corinthians 15:26) is inscribed on the grave. The Dumbledores&#x27; family tomb also holds a biblical quote: &quot;Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also&quot;, which is from Matthew 6:21. Rowling states, &quot;They&#x27;re very British books, so on a very practical note Harry was going to find biblical quotations on tombstones ... [but] I think those two particular quotations he finds on the tombstones at Godric&#x27;s Hollow, they sum up – they almost epitomise the whole series&quot;.

&quot;Harry Potter&quot; pundit John Granger additionally noted that one of the reasons the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books were so popular is their use of literary alchemy (similar to &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Perelandra&quot; and Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;) and vision symbolism. In this model, authors weave allegorical tales along the alchemical magnum opus. Since the medieval period, alchemical allegory has mirrored the passion, death and resurrection of Christ. While the entire series utilises symbols common in alchemy, the &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; completes this cycle, tying themes of death, rebirth, and the Resurrection Stone to the principal motif of alchemical allegory, and topics presented in the first book of the series.

==Adaptations==
===Films===
The two-part film adaptation of &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; was directed by David Yates, written by Steve Kloves and produced by David Heyman, David Barron and J. K. Rowling. Part 1 was released on 19 November 2010, and Part 2 on 15 July 2011. Filming began in February 2009, and ended on 12 June 2010. However, the cast confirmed they would reshoot the epilogue scene as they only had two days to shoot the original. &quot;Part 1&quot; ended at Chapter 24 of the book, when Voldemort regained the Elder Wand. However, there were a few omissions, such as the appearances of Dean Thomas and Viktor Krum, and Peter Pettigrew&#x27;s death. James Bernadelli of &quot;Reelviews&quot; said that the script stuck closest to the text since &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, yet this was met with negativity from some audiences as the film inherited &quot;the book&#x27;s own problems&quot;.

===Audiobooks===
&quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; was released simultaneously on 21 July 2007, in both the UK and the United States. The UK edition features the voice of Stephen Fry and runs about 24 hours while the US edition features the voice of Jim Dale and runs about 21 hours. Both Fry and Dale recorded 146 different and distinguishable character voices, and was the most recorded by an individual on an audiobook at the time.

For his work on &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, Dale won the 2008 Grammy Award for the Best Spoken Word Album for Children. He also was awarded an Earphone Award by &quot;AudioFile&quot;, who claimed, &quot;Dale has raised the bar on audiobook interpretation so high it&#x27;s hard to imagine any narrator vaulting over it.&quot;

===Video games===
Two action-adventure video games were produced by Electronic Arts (EA) to coincide with the release of the film adaptations, as with each of the previous &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films. Part 1 was released on 16 November 2010, and Part 2 on 12 July 2011. Both games received a mixed to negative reaction from critics.

==Subsequent works==
===&quot;The Tales of Beedle the Bard&quot;===
On 4 December 2008, Rowling released &quot;The Tales of Beedle the Bard&quot; both in the UK and US. &quot;The Tales of Beedle the Bard&quot; is a spin-off of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; and contains fairy tales that are told to children in the &quot;Wizarding World&quot;. The book includes five short stories, including &quot;The Tale of the Three Brothers&quot; which is the story of the Deathly Hallows.

Amazon released an exclusive collector&#x27;s edition of the book which is a replica of the book that Amazon purchased at auction in December 2007.
Seven copies were auctioned off in London by Sotheby&#x27;s. Each was illustrated and handwritten by Rowling and is 157 pages. It was bound in brown Moroccan leather and embellished with five hand-chased hallmarked sterling silver ornaments and mounted moonstones.

===&quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&quot;===
In 2016, &quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&quot; was released, a two-part play written by Jack Thorne based on an original story by Rowling, Thorne, and John Tiffany. Billed as the eighth story in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, it picks up where the epilogue of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; left off, following an adult Harry Potter and his son, Albus Severus Potter. Previews of the play began at the Palace Theatre, London, on 7 June 2016, and it premiered on 30 July 2016. The play opened on Broadway on 21 April 2018 at the Lyric Theatre, with previews starting on 16 March 2018.

Both parts of the stage play&#x27;s script have been released in print and digital formats as &quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Parts I &amp; II&quot;. The first edition, the Special Rehearsal Edition, corresponded to the script used in the preview shows and was published on 31 July 2016, the date of Harry&#x27;s birthday in the series and Rowling&#x27;s birthday, as well. Since revisions to the script continued after the book was printed, an edited version was released on 25 July 2017, as the &quot;Definitive Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;. According to CNN, this was the most preordered book of 2016.

<doc id="776056" wikidata="Q1763509" url="?curid=776056" title="Lovebug">
<text>The lovebug (Plecia nearctica) is a species of march fly found in parts of Central America and the southeastern United States, especially along the Gulf Coast. It is also known as the honeymoon fly or double-headed bug. During and after mating, matured pairs remain together, even in flight, for up to several days.

The species was first described in 1940 by D. E. Hardy, though it had been observed in Louisiana as early as 1911. At the time, Hardy reported the distribution of lovebugs to be widespread, but more common in Texas and Louisiana than other Gulf States. By the end of the 20th century the species had spread to all areas bordering the Gulf of Mexico, the entirety of Florida, and had spread as far as Georgia and South Carolina. The species is also present in other countries, including Australia. L. A. Hetrick, writing in 1970, found the bug was also widespread in central and northern Florida and described its flights as reaching altitudes of and extending several kilometers over the Gulf.

Lovebugs&#x27; larvae feed on partially decayed vegetation in the landscape and, in this respect, are beneficial to humans. Adults primarily feed on nectar from various plants, particularly sweet clover, goldenrod, and Brazilian pepper. The lovebug is considered a nuisance by many motorists, especially in the state of Florida, due to its swarming behavior during the species&#x27; mating season.

==Semi-annual pest status==
Male/female pairs (joined tail-to-tail) will hover in the air, drifting slowly. Two major flights occur each year; the spring flight occurs during late April and May, and the summer flight occurs during late August and September. Flights extend over periods of four to five weeks. In south Florida, a third (but smaller) flight can occur in December. Mating takes place almost immediately after emergence of the females. Adult females live only three to four days, while males live a little longer. They have to stick to each other at all times.

This species&#x27; reputation as a public nuisance is due not to any bite or sting (it is incapable of either), but to its slightly acidic body chemistry. There are no health risks to humans, as disease cannot be transmitted through them. Because airborne lovebugs can exist in enormous numbers near highways, they die in large numbers on automobile windshields, hoods, and radiator grilles when vehicles travel at highway speeds. If left for more than an hour or two, the remains become extremely difficult to remove. Their body chemistry has a nearly neutral 6.5 pH but may become acidic at 4.25 pH if left on the car for a day. In the past, the acidity of the dead adult body, especially the female&#x27;s egg masses, often resulted in pits and etches in automotive paint and chrome if not quickly removed. However, advances in automotive paints and protective coatings have reduced this threat significantly. Now the greatest concern is excessive clogging of vehicle radiator air passages by the bodies of the adults, with a reduction of the cooling effect on engines, and the obstruction of windshields when the remains of the adults and egg masses are smeared on the glass.

Lovebug adults are attracted to light-colored surfaces, especially if they are freshly painted, but adults congregate almost anywhere, apparently reacting to the effects of sunlight on automobile fumes, asphalt, and other products affected by environmental factors still not completely understood.

==Folklore==
Urban legend holds that lovebugs are synthetic—the result of a University of Florida genetics experiment gone wrong.

Research by L.L. Buschman showed that migration explained the introduction of the lovebug into Florida and other southeastern states, contrary to the urban myth that the University of Florida created them by manipulating DNA to control mosquito populations.

Much speculation about the lovebug still thrives. This is partly because the larval form of this insect is seldom seen, as it lives and feeds in the thatch of grasses for most of the year. While various fungi are suspected of being natural controls for this species, biological control of these non-pest flies is not a priority for funding.

==Management==
Lovebugs are subject to some significant natural controls, such as various parasitic fungi, and dry weather, which dries out the thatch, resulting in a higher mortality rate for the immature. As the lovebug migrated around the Gulf Coast, first to Texas, then Louisiana, then further eastward, the initial populations for many years were so excessive that they caused public concern and initiated rumors of their origin. However, as pest populations migrate naturally, their natural controls are usually not far behind. While it often took decades, lovebug flights are no longer present in the huge numbers that once existed simply because their natural controls (mostly fungi) caught up with established populations. In many areas, local lovebug flights may only be present in excessively large numbers due to occasional local conditions that may not be repeated in successive years.

While lovebugs are not a favored food of most insectivores due to their acidic taste, lovebug larvae—and some adults—are food for birds such as quail and robins. Arthropod predators include spiders, some predatory insects such as earwigs, at least two species of beetle larvae, and centipedes.

==Life cycle==
Female lovebugs can lay as many as 350 eggs and regularly lay these eggs around decaying material on the top layer of ground soil. Lovebug eggs generally hatch after 2–4 days, depending on flight season. Once the eggs have hatched, the larvae start feeding on the decaying material around them, such as decaying plants on the soil and other organic material, and live and remain in the soil until they develop to the pupa stage. During the warmer months the lovebug larvae remain in the larvae phase for approximately 120 days and approximately 240 days during the cooler months. Lovebugs typically stay in the pupa stage about 7–9 days before reaching the adult phase, in which they can start reproducing.

Once adults, lovebugs are ready to start copulating to begin reproducing. Adult male lovebugs emerge first from the pupal stage and hover around until female lovebugs emerge. Mating between lovebugs takes place immediately after emergence of the adult females. A male lovebug copulates and will remain paired up until the female has been fully fertilized. Copulation takes place for 2–3 days before the female detaches, lays her eggs, and dies. Adult females have been recorded to live up to seven days, while adult males may live up to two to five days, but on average lovebugs live three to four days. However, Thornhill (1976c) recorded recapture data that showed males lived longer in the field than females.

<text>Jules Régis Debray (; born 2 September 1940) is a French philosopher, journalist, former government official and academic. He is known for his theorization of mediology, a critical theory of the long-term transmission of cultural meaning in human society, and for associating with Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara in Bolivia in 1967 and advancing Salvador Allende&#x27;s presidency in Chile in the early 1970s. He returned to France in 1973 and later held various official posts in the French government.

== Life ==
=== 1960 to 1973 ===
Born in Paris, Régis Debray studied at the École Normale Supérieure where he was taught by Louis Althusser. He appeared as himself in the cinema verité movie &quot;Chronique d&#x27;un été&quot; by Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin in 1960. He became an &quot;agrégé de philosophie&quot; in 1965.

During the late 1960s, he was a professor of philosophy at the University of Havana in Cuba and became an associate of Che Guevara in Bolivia. He wrote the book &quot;Revolution in the Revolution?&quot;, which analysed the tactical and strategic doctrines then prevailing among militant socialist movements in Latin America, and acted as a handbook for guerrilla warfare that supplemented Guevara&#x27;s own manual concerning the topic. It was published in Cuba in the &quot;Cuadernos&quot; collection by Casa de las Americas in 1967, by Maspero in Paris, in New York (Monthly Review Press and Grove Press), Montevideo (Sandino), Milan (Feltrinelli), and Munich (Trikont).

 Guevara was captured in Bolivia in October 1967; on 20 April 1967 Debray had been arrested in the small town of Muyupampa, also in Bolivia. Convicted of having been part of Guevara&#x27;s guerrilla group, Debray was sentenced on 17 November to 30 years in prison. He was released in 1970 after an international campaign for his release which included appeals by Jean-Paul Sartre, André Malraux, General Charles de Gaulle, and Pope Paul VI. He sought refuge in Chile, where he wrote &quot;The Chilean Revolution&quot; (1972) after interviews with Salvador Allende.

Debray returned to France in 1973 following the coup by Augusto Pinochet in Chile.

=== 1981 to 1996 ===

After the election in France of President François Mitterrand in 1981, he became an official adviser to the Président on Foreign Affairs. In this capacity, he developed a policy that sought to increase France&#x27;s freedom of action in the world, decrease dependence on the United States, and promote closeness with the former colonies. He was also involved in the development of the government&#x27;s official ceremonies and recognition of the bicentennial of the French Revolution. He resigned in 1988.

Until the mid-1990s he held a number of official positions in France, including an honorary counselorship at France&#x27;s supreme administrative court, Conseil d&#x27;État.

In 1996, he published a memoir of his life, translated into English as &quot;Régis Debray, Praised Be Our Lords&quot; (Verso, 2007).

=== 2003 onwards ===

Debray was a member of the 2003 Stasi Commission, named for Bernard Stasi, which examined the origins of the 2003 French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools. Debray endorsed the 2003 law. This was in defence of French &quot;laïcité&quot; (separation of church and state) which intends to maintain citizens&#x27; equality by the prohibition of religious proselytism in the school system. Debray, however, seems to have encouraged a more subtle treatment of religious issues with regard to school history teaching in France.

Debray is preoccupied with the situation of Christian minorities in the Near East (and with the status of the Holy Places in Jerusalem, Bethlehem and elsewhere), a traditional interest of the French state, and has established an observatory to monitor the situation. His recent work investigates the religious paradigm as a social able to assist collective orientation on a wide, centuries-long scale. This caused him to propose the project of an &quot;Institut Européen en Sciences des Religions&quot;, a French institute founded in 2005 for monitoring sociological religious dynamics, and informing the public about religious issues through conferences and publications.

== Work: mediology ==

Debray is the initiator and chief exponent of the discipline of &quot;médiologie&quot; or &quot;mediology&quot;, which attempts to scientifically study the transmission of cultural meaning in society, whether through language or images. Mediology is characterized by its multi-disciplinary approach. It is expounded best in the English-language book &quot;Transmitting Culture&quot; (Columbia University Press, 2004). In &quot;Vie et mort de l&#x27;image&quot; (Life and Death of Image, 1995), an attempted history of the gaze, he distinguished three regimes of the images (icon, idol and vision). He also strove explicitly to prevent misunderstandings by differentiating mediology from a simple sociology of mass media. He also criticized the basic assumptions of the history of art which present art as an atemporal and universal phenomenon. According to Debray, art is a product of the Renaissance with the invention of the artist as producer of images, in contrast with previous acheiropoieta icons or other types of so-called &quot;art,&quot; which did not primarily fulfil an artistic function but rather a religious one.

== Current political views ==

In a February 2007 opinion-editorial in the newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot;, Debray criticized the tendency of the entire French political class towards conservatism. He also deplored the influence of the &quot;videosphere&quot; on modern politics, which he claimed has a tendency to individualize everything, forgetting both past and future (although he praised the loss of 1960s &quot;messianism&quot;), and rejecting any common national project. He criticized the new generation in politics as competent but without character, and lacking ideas: &quot;So they [think they] have recruited philosophy with André Glucksmann or Bernard-Henri Lévy and literature with Christine Angot or Jean d&#x27;Ormesson&quot;. He asked voters to endorse the &quot;left of the left,&quot; in an attempt to end a modern &quot;anti-politics&quot; which has become political marketing.

== Personal life ==
Debray was married to Venezuelan Elizabeth Burgos; they have a daughter together, Laurence (born 1976).

<text>Captive import is a marketing term and a strategy for a vehicle that is foreign-built and sold under the name of an importer or by a domestic automaker through its own dealer distribution system.

The foreign vehicle may be produced by a subsidiary of the same company, be a joint venture with another firm, or be acquired under license from a completely separate entity. The brand name used may be that of the domestic company, the foreign builder, or an unrelated marque entirely (this is one type of &quot;badge engineering&quot;).

==Background==
Captive import arrangements are usually made to increase the competitiveness of the domestic brand by filling a perceived target market not currently served by its model lineup that is either not practical or not economically feasible to fill from domestic production or a mutually beneficial agreement that helps automakers without a strong distribution network or a presence in a specific country to benefit from the distribution network and stronger brand image of an established automobile manufacturer in that location. One example is the agreement between Chrysler and Mitsubishi Motors, which started in 1971. Chrysler imported Mitsubishi-manufactured vehicles into the United States to fill a void in their compact lineup with cars like the Dodge Colt. Mitsubishi began selling vehicles under their name in the United States in 1982.

In countries or regions where a foreign manufacturer might have a wholly owned subsidiary that develops and manufactures vehicles or a strong manufacturing presence, a captive import can be a vehicle from the manufacturers&#x27; indigenous country or an affiliated manufacturer worldwide. Holden was the Australian subsidiary of American General Motors and was considered to be a domestic manufacturer in Australia until Australian domestic production completely ended in 2017. In the past, Holden has also imported the Mexican-built Holden Suburban, a variant of the North American Chevrolet Suburban, along with the Holden Jackaroo built by General Motors&#x27; Japanese affiliate Isuzu in Japan. An example of an Australian captive import is the Holden Barina, which has since 1985 been the Suzuki Cultus, two generations of the European Opel Corsa, and is also the Korean Daewoo Kalos (marketed internationally as the Chevrolet Aveo).

For countries that do not have native manufacturers or a development/manufacturing presence, a captive import is a vehicle not manufactured by the specific company that imported the vehicle but sold under its brand. Usually, the vehicle manufacturer might be an affiliate of the importer. The Chevrolet Forester was sold in India by General Motors, where its manufacturer, Japan-based Subaru, does not have a sales presence, and the importation agreement started during the period when the manufacturer of Subaru, Fuji Heavy Industries, was affiliated with General Motors.

A vehicle manufactured in a country where the manufacturers&#x27; indigenous nation has a free-trade agreement with other countries in the same region, such as the European Union for Europe, NAFTA for North America, or ASEAN for Southeast Asia, and manufactured in a plant wholly or partially owned by that company should not be considered a captive import. 

The integration of manufacturing operations between Canada, Mexico, and the United States has been due to the hospitable trade environment created by the North American Free Trade Agreement (and before NAFTA, the US-Canada Auto Pact), coupled with the proximity of these nations to the U.S. Vehicles made and marketed by European automakers that were eventually acquired by the Big Three automakers, such as Land Rover, Volvo, and Saab, are generally not considered to be captive imports.

Automobile companies have made efforts since the 1990s to streamline operations and become increasingly globalized, making it more challenging to determine the national origin of vehicles and even more complicated when considering outsourcing the worldwide sources of components and parts used to make them.

== American market ==
In the American market, captive imports &quot;blurred national distinctions&quot; because they were designed and built elsewhere, but have a domestic nameplate. The chief reason domestic automakers market captive imports is because &quot;it is cheaper to import those cars than to produce them&quot; in the United States.

The Nash-Healey two-seat sports car was produced for the U.S. market between 1951 and 1954. It combined a Nash Ambassador drivetrain with a European chassis and body and was a product of a partnership between Nash-Kelvinator Corporation and British automaker Donald Healey. After the first model year, the Nash-Healey was restyled and assembled by Pinin Farina in Italy.

The Nash Metropolitan, sold in the U.S. from 1954 until 1962, was a captive import for Nash Motors. It was designed by Nash, unlike most captive imports built by another company, and produced by Austin in the UK specifically for sale in the U.S. By entering into a manufacturing arrangement, Nash would avoid the expense associated with tooling, body panels, and components. When Nash launched this two-seater sub-compact car, it was the first time an American-designed car had been only built in Europe and never assembled in the United States. Unlike typical European cars of the era, its look was &quot;American&quot;, and it had a design resemblance to the large or &quot;senior&quot; U.S.-built Nashes. It became one of the few small cars to sell well during the most bulk-obsessed period of U.S. automotive history.

When Mercedes-Benz was seeking entry into the American market in the 1950s, the company signed a marketing agreement with Studebaker–Packard and became a captive brand in their showrooms. Around the same time, Pontiac dealers sold the GM&#x27;s British-built Vauxhalls from 1958 until 1962.

Ford, who had invented the modern captive-import system in 1948 with the British Anglia and Prefect, added its own European Ford Cortina to its North American dealer network until low demand led to its discontinuation in 1970 when the company introduced its domestic Pinto replacement, and its European market Ford Capri to its U.S. Mercury line in the 1970s. Although the car had features to make it great, the marketing was flawed with a mismatch to the models traditionally sold by Lincoln-Mercury dealers. Ford returned to importing the Mk1 Fiesta in 1978 when the company developed the North American market Escort/Lynx twins until 2013 when the &quot;One Ford&quot; business strategy was in operation, and the European market Mondeo and Fiesta were manufactured in both North America and Europe.

During the same period, Dodge marketed several small Mitsubishi models, mostly sold as Dodge Colts (versions of which would later be marketed under the Plymouth and Eagle brands). Chrysler Corporation did not develop its in-house subcompacts during the late 1960s (which GM and Ford Motor Company had done with the Vega and Pinto), where they partnered with an overseas manufacturer with Mitsubishi and Hillman.

The &quot;Plymouth Cricket&quot; (a rebadged Hillman Avenger) was introduced to the U.S. market in the early 1970s to counter the growing demand for small cars, but not successful.

General Motors marketed its German-built Opel models like the Kadett through Buick dealers in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This venture yielded ambivalent results; the Opels were generally well-regarded, and sales were decent but never substantial. In the 1970s, when Buick decided to phase out its Opels and sell small Isuzus instead, the result was a handful of cars carrying a global brand, &quot;Buick Opel, by Isuzu.&quot; Buick was not the first to rebadge Isuzus — Chevrolet did the same with their LUV pickup truck in 1972.

The Daewoo-built line of LeMans-branded small cars were marketed by GM in several nations and through Pontiac dealers in the U.S. starting in 1988. They shared nothing with the original 1960s LeMans models. In the late 1980s, GM consolidated most of its various captive imports of the time under the Geo brand, which was exclusively handled by Chevrolet dealers. The cars, built variously by Toyota (the Prizm), Isuzu (Spectrum, Storm) and Suzuki (Metro, Tracker).

Examples of captive imports in the U.S. have included the Cadillac Catera, a rebadged Opel Omega, the Chevrolet Aveo, built by GM Daewoo, and the Chrysler Crossfire — an American design which mostly uses Mercedes-Benz mechanicals, but was built by Karmann in Germany. The Pontiac GTO, which was built alongside the Australian Holden Monaro, also qualifies. The Saturn Astra is another example. It is a rebadged Opel Astra that is imported from Belgium. The successor for Pontiac&#x27;s seventh generation Grand Prix, the Pontiac G8, was a modified Holden VE Commodore imported from Australia.

In 2004, GM began marketing the Chevrolet Aveo subcompact, a rebadged Daewoo Kalos (now a rebadged Daewoo Gentra) assembled in South Korea. In 2008, GM started marketing the Saturn Astra, which is a rebadged Opel Astra, assembled in Belgium. Before the brand&#x27;s phaseout, Pontiac also returned to the captive idea by selling Holden vehicles, first the Holden Monaro as the Pontiac GTO and then the Holden VE Commodore as the Pontiac G8. Pontiac dealers also briefly received a version of the Kalos/Gentra/Aveo, which was sold in Canada as the G3 Wave and in the U.S. as the G3.

In 2011, GM once again used a Holden model, the WM/WN Caprice, as a captive import for its Caprice PPV, but designed for law enforcement agencies in the United States and Canada.

In 2013, GM used the Holden VF Commodore as the Chevrolet SS performance sedan for the 2014 model year.

== Other markets ==
In Europe, there have been relatively few cases of captive imports, and most have been unsuccessful. The Chevrolet Venture minivan was sold as the Opel/Vauxhall Sintra (SWB) and Chevrolet Trans Sport (LWB) in the late-1990s, but was not only not to European tastes, but also gained a bad reputation due to poor results in safety tests. The practice has been revived by PSA Peugeot Citroën with the Peugeot 4007, Peugeot 4008, Citroën C-Crosser, and Citroën C4 Aircross, which are rebadged versions of the Mitsubishi Outlander and Mitsubishi ASX, respectively. However, the introduction of the Ford Mustang to Europe in 2015 has been successful, owing to the Mustang&#x27;s image and unique positioning.

In Brazil, the Australian-built Holden Commodore has been sold since 1998 as Chevrolet Omega, replacing the locally built car bearing the same name. Despite being well received by the press and public, sales are much worse than its locally built counterpart, simply because of its high price. However, it is used very often as official government cars. Chevrolet also rebranded the Argentine-built Suzuki Vitara as the Chevrolet Tracker after Suzuki stopped selling cars in Brazil, but it never achieved the same sales figures as the original car.

In Japan, where foreign car manufacturers have traditionally struggled to compete in the local market, even rebadging of U.S. models like the Chevrolet Cavalier as a Toyota has failed to improve sales.

In Australia, GM&#x27;s Holden operation sold the 1975-84 Isuzu Bellett/Gemini, itself a license-built version of the then-current Opel Kadett, as the Holden Gemini. The name was originally Holden-Isuzu Gemini, but after the first TX series, the Isuzu cobranding was dropped. Perhaps the original idea was to foster the Japanese-ness of the model at a time when customers might have seen that as a positive, the Nissan&#x27;s 610 Bluebird being marketed as the Datsun 180B being a big seller at the time. The Gemini was assembled in Australia at Acacia Ridge in Queensland and Holden was still the highest-selling brand. The Chevrolet LUV produced by Isuzu was also sold from 1973 for a couple of years, the only official Chevrolet branded model available in Australia at the time (and since). Ford sold the Taurus in Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong in 1996, but stopped in 1999. In 1998, the Chevrolet Suburban, was marketed in Australia and New Zealand as a rebadged Holden Suburban with intentions to launch the full-sized SUV in a region that was used to having small to mid-sized SUVs, and the model was discontinued in 2001.

== Reasons for failure ==

Captive imports often fail, and a shift in exchange rates can raise prices to uncompetitive levels.

Some models have been criticized for marginal quality, such as the spate of Daewoo models marketed under domestic General Motors marques during the 2000s, or for being a bad match for the local driving environment.

The commitment of domestic sales and service staff to an unfamiliar vehicle has been questioned, particularly if the import is seen as reducing sales of other, more profitable vehicles in the lineup.

Others fail due to no fault of their own; the Sunbeam Tiger, for instance, an early 1960s example of the concept of an American Ford Windsor engine in a British (Sunbeam Alpine) body and chassis, enjoyed substantial success until Sunbeam became a captive import of Chrysler Corporation in North America. Chrysler could not be realistically expected to sell a car with a Ford engine, and Chrysler V8 engines all had the distributor positioned at the rear of the engine, unlike the front-mounted distributor of the Ford V8, making it impossible to fit the Chrysler engine into the Sunbeam engine bay without major and expensive revisions. Thus this niche of the automotive market was left to be filled with legendary success by the Ford engined Shelby Cobra.

There may be a deeper, structural issue at work, however. It could simply be that a domestic buyer is unlikely to want an import, and an import buyer is unlikely to enter a domestic showroom. Also, consumers of a specific domestic brand might feel that a captive import does not have the qualities that they want and expect from vehicles of domestic vehicles manufactured by that brand. A captive thus easily falls between two stools. This is probably why the practice of using a separate brand name, such as Merkur and General Motors&#x27; short-lived Geo, has ceased — the foreignness of the car is thus discreetly made less apparent. Another factor concerns servicing where captives often do not share components with their domestic counterparts - this often leads to parts incompatibility and/or backorders.

Another view is that the practice could be seen by the public as simply dishonest, causing complete rejection. Certainly in cases when identical models are available at the same time with only the badges differentiating them such as what happened under the failed Button car plan in Australia during the 1980s.

== Exceptions ==
Not every vehicle that appears to be a captive import really is. A foreign-designed or badged vehicle assembled in the market where it is sold does not fall into this category. Such vehicles are frequently the result of joint venture or strategic alliance arrangements between automakers.

For example, the Renault Alliance was sold through American Motors (AMC) dealers starting in the fall of 1982 until production ended on 5 June 1987 Chrysler acquired AMC. The Alliance was assembled by AMC as part of a tie-up with the French company. The 1985 through 1988 Chevrolet Nova and the later Geo Prizm were a Toyota design and shared the Chevrolet showroom with many captives, were built in the U.S. by the GM-Toyota NUMMI joint venture. The Eagle Talon and Plymouth Laser, both related to the Mitsubishi Eclipse, were manufactured in the U.S. by Diamond-Star Motors, a Chrysler-Mitsubishi Motors joint venture. Although Australia&#x27;s Holden often shared planning and hardware with the rest of GM&#x27;s global operations, which included Opel and Isuzu, it preferred assembling its versions of such vehicles locally. Rover and Honda have co-produced models for the European market, as have Alfa Romeo and Nissan. None of these would be considered imports. With the complete ceasing of automotive production in Australia by Holden and Ford Australia in 2016, who were both considered indigenous Australian automakers, both will be switching to a wholly imported lineup. No vehicle sold by Holden or Ford after the end of Australian production should be considered a captive import since neither maintains an Australian manufacturing presence.

<text>The siege of Malta in World War II was a military campaign in the Mediterranean theatre. From June 1940 to November 1942, the fight for the control of the strategically important island of the British Crown Colony of Malta pitted the air and naval forces of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany against the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Royal Navy.

The opening of a new front in North Africa in June 1940 increased Malta&#x27;s already considerable value. British air and sea forces based on the island could attack Axis ships transporting supplies and reinforcements from Europe. General Erwin Rommel, de facto field commander of &quot;Panzerarmee Afrika&quot; in North Africa, recognised its importance quickly. In May 1941, he warned that &quot;Without Malta the Axis will end by losing control of North Africa&quot;.

The Axis resolved to bomb or starve Malta into submission, to soften it up for invasion, by attacking its ports, towns, cities, and Allied shipping supplying the island. Malta was one of the most intensively bombed areas during the war. The German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and Italian &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; flew a total of 3,000 bombing raids over two years, dropping 6,700 tons of bombs on the Grand Harbour area alone. Their success would have allowed a combined German–Italian amphibious landing (Operation Herkules) supported by German airborne forces (&quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot;) but this did not happen.

Allied convoys were able to supply and reinforce Malta, while the RAF defended its airspace, though at great cost in materiel and lives. In November 1942 the Axis lost the Second Battle of El Alamein and the Allies landed forces in Morocco and Algeria in Operation Torch. The Axis diverted forces to the Tunisia campaign and reduced attacks on Malta, ending the siege. In December 1942, air and sea forces operating from Malta went over to the offensive. By May 1943, they had sunk 230 Axis ships in 164 days, the highest Allied sinking rate of the war. The Allied victory in Malta played a major role in the eventual Allied success in North Africa.

==Background==
Malta was a military and naval fortress, being the only Allied base between Gibraltar and Alexandria, Egypt. In peacetime it was a way station along the British trade route to Egypt and the Suez Canal to India and the Far East. When the route was closed, Malta remained a forward base for offensive action against Axis shipping and land targets in the central Mediterranean. Owing to its exposed position close to Italy, the British had moved the headquarters of the Royal Navy Mediterranean Fleet from Valletta, Malta, in the mid-1930s to Alexandria in October 1939.

Malta is with an area of just under . It had a population of around 250,000 in June 1940, all but 3% or 4% of them native Maltese. According to the 1937 census, most of the inhabitants lived within of Grand Harbour, where the population density was more than six times that of the island average. Amongst the most congested spots was Valletta, the capital and political, military and commercial centre, where 23,000 people lived in an area of around . Across Grand Harbour, in the Three Cities, where the Malta Dockyard and the Admiralty headquarters were located, 28,000 people were packed into . It was these small areas that suffered the heaviest, most sustained and concentrated aerial bombing in history.

There were hardly any defences on Malta because of a pre-war conclusion that the island was indefensible. The Italian and British surface fleets were evenly matched in the region but the Italians had far more submarines and aircraft. The Admiralty had to protect the Suez Canal with the Mediterranean Fleet (Admiral Andrew Cunningham) and Gibraltar with Force H (Vice-Admiral James Somerville). In October 1939, the Mediterranean Fleet was transferred eastwards to Egypt, stripping the island of its naval protection. Only the monitor and a few British submarines were still based at the island. When the Maltese government questioned British reasoning, they were told that the island could be defended just as adequately from Alexandria as from Grand Harbour, which was untrue. This led the Maltese to doubt the British commitment to defend the island.
Despite concerns that the island, far from Britain and close to Italy, could not be defended, the British decided in July 1939 to increase the number of anti-aircraft guns and fighter aircraft on Malta. The British leadership had further doubts about whether to hold the island in May 1940, when during the Battle of France the French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud suggested that the Italian prime minister and dictator Benito Mussolini might be appeased by concessions, including Malta. After some discussion, Winston Churchill convinced the British War Cabinet that no concessions should be made. With the British home islands in danger, the defence of Malta was not the priority and it was lightly protected. Only six obsolete Gloster Sea Gladiator biplanes were stationed on the island, with another six in crates when, on 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on the United Kingdom and France. In the 1930s, Italy had sought to expand in the Mediterranean and Africa, regions dominated by the British and French. The Allied defeat in France from May–June 1940 removed the French Navy from the Allied order of battle and tilted the balance of naval and air power in Italy&#x27;s favour.

Upon declaring war, Mussolini called for an offensive throughout the Mediterranean and within hours, the first bombs were dropped on Malta. After the French surrender on 25 June, Mussolini tried to exploit the situation, conducting &quot;Operazione E&quot;, the Italian invasion of Egypt, in September. The 10th Army was crushed in Operation Compass, a British counter-stroke, and Adolf Hitler decided to come to the aid of his ally. In February 1941, the &quot;Deutsches Afrikakorps&quot; (DAK, German Africa Corps under General Erwin Rommel) was sent to North Africa as a blocking detachment (). RAF and Royal Navy anti-shipping squadrons and submarines on Malta threatened the Axis supply line to North Africa and both sides recognised the importance of Malta in controlling the central Mediterranean.

In 1940, an Italian assault on Malta stood a reasonable chance of gaining control of the island, an action giving the Italians naval and air supremacy in the central Mediterranean. The Mediterranean would have been split in two, separating the British bases at Gibraltar and Alexandria. The reluctance of the Italians to act directly against Malta throughout 1940 was strengthened by the Battle of Taranto, in which much of the Italian surface fleet was put out of action by Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm (FAA) torpedo bombers. The Italians adopted an indirect approach and cut off the island. To the Italians (and later the Germans), air power was the key weapon against Malta.

==Italian siege (June–December 1940)==

===Italian air actions===

Air power was the method chosen to attack Malta. The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; (Italian Air Force) began the aerial bombardment of the island from airbases in Sicily. On the first day, 55 Italian bombers and 21 fighters flew over Malta and dropped 142 bombs on the three airfields at Luqa, Hal Far and Ta Qali. Later, 10 Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79s and 20 Macchi C.200s flew over the island, with no air opposition. At the time of these first air raids, the defending fighters on Malta consisted of obsolete Gloster Sea Gladiators, in the Hal Far Fighter Flight. Ten Gladiators in crates for transit were assembled and as no more than three aircraft flew at once, were called &#x27;Faith&#x27;, &#x27;Hope&#x27; and &#x27;Charity&#x27;. The pilots were flying boat aircrew and other fliers with no experience of fighter operations. One Gladiator was shot down but the rest managed to shoot down several Italian aircraft.

The Italians flew at around and the monitor &quot;Terror&quot; and gunboats and opened fire. In the afternoon, another 38 bombers escorted by 12 fighters raided the capital. The raids were designed to affect the morale of the population rather than inflict damage to dockyards and installations. A total of eight raids were flown on that first day. The bombing did not cause much damage and most of the casualties suffered were civilian. No interception of the raiders was made because there was no RAF force ready to meet them. No RAF airfield on Malta was operational at that time; one, at Luqa, was near to completion.

Despite the absence of any operational airfields, at least one RAF Gladiator flew against a raid of 55 Savoia Marchetti SM 79 and their 20 escorting fighters on 11 June. It surprised the Italians, but the defences, almost non-existent on the ground and in the air, failed to impede the Italian force. On 12 June an Italian aircraft on a reconnaissance flight over Malta was shot down.

Twelve Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers escaped from southern France following the French capitulation and flew to the French colony of Tunisia. They then flew on arriving at the FAA base at Hal Far, 767 (Training) NAS, on 19 June. They formed the nucleus of what was to become 830 Naval Air Squadron, providing Malta with its first offensive strike aircraft. Before June was out, they raided Sicily and sank one Italian destroyer, damaged a cruiser and destroyed oil storage tanks in the port of Augusta.

By the start of July, the Gladiators had been reinforced by Hawker Hurricanes and the defences organised into No. 261 Squadron RAF in August. Twelve aircraft were delivered by in August, the first of several batches ferried to the island by the carrier. A further attempt (Operation White) to fly 12 Hurricanes into Malta on 17 November, led by a FAA Blackburn Skua, ended in disaster with the loss of eight Hurricanes; they took off too far west of the island due to the presence of the Italian fleet and ran out of fuel, and several pilots were lost. A further two Hurricanes crashed, with one of the pilots rescued by a Short Sunderland flying boat. The arrival of more fighters was welcome. After eight weeks, the original force of Hurricane units was grounded owing to a lack of spare parts.

By the year&#x27;s end, the RAF claimed 45 Italian aircraft had been shot down. The Italians admitted the loss of 23 bombers and 12 fighters, with a further 187 bombers and seven fighters having suffered damage, mainly to anti-aircraft artillery.

===Invasion plan DG10/42===
In 1938 Mussolini had considered an invasion of Malta under Plan DG10/42, in which a force of 40,000 men would capture the island. Nearly all 80 purpose-built sea craft that would land the Italian Army ashore were expected to be lost but landings would be made in the north, with an attack upon the Victoria Lines, across the centre of the island. A secondary landing would be made on Gozo, north-west of Malta and the islet of Comino, between the two. All of the Italian navy and 500 aircraft would be involved, but the lack of supplies led the planners to believe that the operation could not be carried out. With the German success in the Battle of France from May–June 1940, the plan was reduced to 20,000 men with the addition of tanks. The Allied defeat in France gave the Italians an opportunity to seize Malta but Italian intelligence overestimated the Maltese defences and Mussolini thought that an invasion would be unnecessary once Britain made peace. Mussolini also expected Francoist Spain to join the Axis and capture Gibraltar, which would close the Mediterranean to the British from the west.

===War at sea===
The reluctance of the Italian Admiralty () to act was also due to other considerations. The Italians believed they could keep the Royal Navy&#x27;s fleet of ageing battleships bottled up in Alexandria. Another factor was the lack of crude oil (the Italians did not discover the large reserves in Libya during their occupation of the country). The Germans took most of the oil from Romania and left few resources for Italy to pursue large-scale operations in the Mediterranean. Not only did this preclude any large-scale naval operations, it also left the Italians without adequate fuel for combat training at sea. By the start of 1941, a limited petroleum stockpile meant only seven months of fuel could be guaranteed. On the other hand, British confidence was eroded when aircraft began to dominate the actions at sea later on in 1941 and 1942, as the Royal Navy had long been expected to be the principal defender of the island.

Cunningham brought to light the reluctance of the Italian Navy to engage by probing their defences. On 9 July 1940, the Battle of Calabria was the only time the main Italian and British (with supporting Royal Australian Navy [RAN] vessels) fleets engaged each other. Both sides claimed victory, but in fact the battle was inconclusive, and everyone returned to their bases as soon as possible. It confirmed to the Maltese people that the British still controlled the seas, if not from the Grand Harbour. This was confirmed again in March 1941, when the Royal Navy decisively defeated the Italian Navy in the Battle of Cape Matapan. The Italians had been heading to intercept the British convoys transporting reinforcements to aid Greece in the Greco-Italian War.

===British counter-attacks===

When it became clear to the British that the Italian air forces were limited and having little impact on the population, which could endure, a steady stream of reinforcements arrived. The potential of the base was realised and Whitehall ordered further aircraft into the island; including Hurricane fighters, Martin Marylands, Sunderlands, Vickers Wellingtons, more Swordfish and submarines. It provided an increasingly potent offensive arm. The Wellingtons arrived in October 1940, from No. 148 Squadron RAF.

Meanwhile, the Italian invasion of Egypt had failed to achieve its goals and the British counter-offensive, Operation Compass, destroyed several divisions of the Italian army at Cyrenaica. The diversion of the North African Campaign drew away significant Italian air units which were rushed from Italy and Sicily to deal with the disasters and support the Italian ground forces embattled in Egypt and Libya. The relief on Malta was significant as the British could now concentrate their forces on offensive, rather than defensive operations. In November 1940, after months of poorly coordinated Italian air strikes, the FAA and Royal Navy struck at Italian naval forces in the Battle of Taranto, a victory for sea-air power and definite proof that aircraft could wreak havoc on naval vessels without air cover. Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers disabled a number of Italian heavy units during the battle. The withdrawal of the Italian fleet to Naples, out of reach of British aircraft, was a strategic victory which handed naval supremacy to the British for the time being.

The Royal Navy&#x27;s submarines also began a period of offensive operations. British U-class submarines began operations as early as June. Larger submarines also began operations, but after 50% losses per mission, they were withdrawn. U-class submarines operated from the Manoel Island Base known as . Unfortunately no bomb-proof pens were available as the building project had been scrapped before the war, owing to cost-cutting policies. The new force was named the Tenth Submarine Flotilla and was placed under Flag Officer Submarines, Admiral Max Horton, who appointed Commander G.W.G. Simpson to command the unit. Administratively, the Tenth Flotilla operated under the First Submarine Flotilla at Alexandria, itself under Cunningham. In reality, Cunningham gave Simpson and his unit a free hand. Until U-class vessels could be made available in numbers, British T-class submarines were used. They had some successes, but suffered heavy losses when they began operations on 20 September 1940. Owing to a shortage of torpedoes, enemy ships could not be attacked unless the target in question was a warship, tanker or other &quot;significant vessel&quot;.

The performance of the fleet was mixed at first. They sank of Italian shipping, half of which was claimed by one vessel, . It accounted for one Italian submarine, nine merchant vessels and one motor torpedo boat (MTB). The loss of nine submarines and their trained crews and commanders was serious. Most of the losses were due to mines. On 14 January 1941, U-class submarines arrived, and the submarine offensive began in earnest.

==&quot;Luftwaffe&quot; arrives (January–April 1941)==

===German intervention===
German intervention over Malta was more a result of the Italian defeats in North Africa than Italian failures to deal with the island. Hitler had little choice other than to rescue his Italian ally or lose the chance of taking the Middle Eastern oilfields in Arabia. The &quot;Deutsche Afrika Korps&quot; (DAK or Africa Corps) under Erwin Rommel was dispatched to secure the Axis front in Africa in February 1941. Operation Colossus signalled a dramatic turn around. The Germans launched Operation Sonnenblume, which reinforced the Italians in North Africa. They then began a counter-offensive and drove the British back into Egypt. But operating overseas in Africa meant most of the supplies to Axis forces would come via the sea. This made Malta a dangerous threat to Axis logistical concerns. In response, the &quot;Oberkommando der Luftwaffe&quot; (OKL or Air Force High Command) sent &quot;Fliegerkorps X&quot; (Flying Corps Ten) to Sicily, which arrived in January 1941, to strike at naval forces in and around Malta, and RAF positions on the island, to ease the passage of supplies.

The British submarines failed to interdict the German ships transporting the German forces to Libya. The damaging of the 7,889-ton German ship &quot;Duisburg&quot; was the only noteworthy attack. On 9 February 1941, three submarines missed the same convoy bringing supplies to Tripoli, the principal Italian port in Libya. The port facilities could unload six ships at a time, making the port the best facility west of Alexandria, to the east. A large part of the Axis defensive success was due to naval mines. The Italians deployed 54,000 mines around Malta to prevent it being supplied. These mines were the bane of the Royal Navy&#x27;s submarines. Around 3,000 mines were laid off Tunisia&#x27;s coast by Italian naval forces as well.

The failure to intercept Axis shipping was evident in the figures which extended far beyond February 1941. From January–April, the Axis sent 321,259 tons to Libya and all but 18,777 tons reached port. This amounted to a 94% success rate for convoy safety running the British interdiction. Of the 73,991 men sent by sea, 71,881 (97%), arrived in Africa. On 10 December 1940, &quot;Fliegerkorps X&quot;, under the command of Hans Ferdinand Geisler, and with support of his chief of staff Major Martin Harlinghausen, was ordered to Sicily to attack Allied shipping in the Mediterranean. By the start of the first German operation, Geisler had 95 aircraft and 14,389 men in Sicily. Geisler persuaded the OKL to give him four more dive-bomber &quot;gruppen&quot; (Groups). On 10 January, he could muster 255 (179 serviceable) aircraft including 209 dive and medium bombers.

By 2 January 1941, the first German units reached Trapani on Sicily&#x27;s southern coast. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s two units were both Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; &quot;Gruppen&quot; (Groups). The first was I./&quot;Sturzkampfgeschwader 1&quot; and II./&quot;Sturzkampfgeschwader 2&quot; (I and II Group Dive Bomber Wings 1 and 2). The units numbered some 80 Ju 87s. This led to a notable increase in the bombing of Malta. A &quot;Stabsstaffel&quot; of &quot;Sturzkampfgeschwader 3&quot; (StG 3) arrived. &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; Karl Christ, &quot;Geschwaderkommodore&quot; of StG 3 gave orders to intercept heavy units. One particular target was aircraft carriers. Days later, he ordered the Ju 87 &quot;gruppen&quot; to sink the new carrier . It had played the key role in the Battle of Taranto, handing naval supremacy to the British, hence it became top of the Axis&#x27; target list.

===&quot;Excess&quot; and &quot;Illustrious&quot; &quot;blitz&quot;===
The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; crews believed four direct hits would sink the ship and began practice operations on floating mock-ups off the Sicilian coast. The vast flight deck offered a target of 6,500 square metres. An opportunity to attack the vessel came on 6 January. The British Operation Excess was launched, which included a series of convoy operations by the British across the Mediterranean Sea. On 10 January they were within range of the Ju 87 bases. II./StG 2 sent 43 Ju 87s with support from I./StG 1. Ten Italian SM 79s had drawn off the carrier&#x27;s Fairey Fulmar fighters while the escorting cruiser sank the . Some 10 Ju 87s attacked the carrier unopposed. Witnessed by Andrew Cunningham, C-in-C of the Fleet from the battleship , the Ju 87s scored six hits. One destroyed a gun, another hit near her bow, a third demolished another gun, while two hit the lift, wrecking the aircraft below deck, causing explosions of fuel and ammunition. Another went through the armoured deck and exploded deep inside the ship. Two further attacks were made without result. Badly damaged, but with her main engines still intact, she steered for the now dubious haven of Malta. The attack lasted six minutes; killed 126 crew members and wounded 91. Within sight of Malta, Italian torpedo bombers also attacked the carrier, but were driven off by intense anti-aircraft fire.

The British operation should not have been launched: Ultra had informed the Air Ministry of &quot;Fliegerkorps X&quot;″s presence on Sicily as early as 4 January. They did not pass on the intelligence to the Admiralty, who probably would not have sailed within range of the Ju 87s if they had known. The RAF was in no condition to prevent a major German air attack, with only 16 Hurricanes and a couple of Gladiator aircraft serviceable. On 11 January 1941, 10 more Ju 87s were sent to sink &quot;Illustrious&quot;. They chanced upon the light cruisers and . Hits were scored on both; &quot;Southampton&quot; was so badly damaged her navy escorts scuttled her. Over the next 12 days, the workers at the shipyard in the Grand Harbour repaired the carrier under determined air attack so that she might make Alexandria. On 13 January, the Ju 87s, now equipped with SC 1000 bombs, failed to achieve a hit. On 14 January, 44 Ju 87s scored a hit on the ill-fated after lift. On 18 January, the Germans switched to attacking the airfields at Hal Far and Luqa in an attempt to win air superiority before returning to &quot;Illustrious&quot;. On 20 January, two near misses breached the hull below the water line and hurled her hull against the wharf. Nevertheless, the engineers won the battle. On 23 January, she slipped out of Grand Harbour, and arrived in Alexandria two days later. The carrier later sailed to America where she was kept out of action for a year.

The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; had failed to sink the carrier. However, their losses were few—three aircraft on 10 January and four Ju 87s over several weeks—and the Germans had impressed the British with the effectiveness of land-based air power. They withdrew their fleet&#x27;s heavy units from the central Mediterranean and risked no more than trying to send cruisers through the Sicilian Narrows. Both the British and Italian navies digested their experiences over Taranto and Malta.

===German and Italian air superiority===
The appearance in February of Messerschmitt Bf 109 E-7 fighters of 7. Staffel (squadron) Jagdgeschwader 26 (26th Fighter Wing or JG 26), led by Oberleutnant Joachim Müncheberg, quickly led to a rise in RAF losses; the German fighter pilots were experienced, confident, tactically astute, better-equipped and well-trained. The Allied pilots on Malta had little combat experience and their Hawker Hurricanes were worn-out and for four months, JG 26 had few losses. The Luftwaffe claimed 42 air victories, 20 of them (including one over Yugoslavia) credited to Müncheberg. The RAF Hurricanes were kept operational by being patched up and cannibalised and their performance, already inferior to the Bf 109E-7, deteriorated. Five Hurricanes arrived at Malta in early March, another six on 18 March. but five Hurricanes and five pilots were lost.&quot;&quot;

On 1 March, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; attacks on airfields destroyed all of the Wellingtons brought in in October. Royal Navy warships and Sunderland flying boats could not use the island for offensive operations, and the main fighter squadrons, Nos. 261 and 274, were put under severe pressure. There were several raids per day and over 107 Axis attacks took place in February and 105 in March, with Bf 109 fighters strafing any signs of movement on the ground. By February around 14,600 men, of the island&#x27;s work force, had volunteered, rationing began reducing morale even more, and all males from ages 16 to 56 were conscripted to join the volunteers, the Royal Malta Artillery guarding Grand Harbour.

The Allies had a success in April, with victory in the Battle of the Tarigo Convoy. Allied surface forces managed to sink only one small Axis convoy in daylight hours during the whole North African Campaign but on the night of 15/16 April, Axis ships were intercepted by Commander P. J. Mack&#x27;s 14th Destroyer Flotilla, comprising , , &quot;Mohawk&quot;, &quot;Juno&quot; and &quot;Nubian&quot;. The destroyers sank &quot;Sabaudia&quot; (1,500 tons), &quot;Aegina&quot; (2,447 tons), &quot;Adana&quot; (4,205 tons), &quot;Isetlhon&quot; (3,704 tons) and &quot;Arta&quot;. The Italian destroyers &quot;Tarigo&quot;, &quot;Lampo&quot; and &quot;Baleno&quot; were sunk for the loss of &quot;Mohawk&quot;.

The flotilla had been officially formed on 8 April 1941, in response to the need for a Malta Strike Force. This formation was to interdict Axis convoys. Commander Lord Louis Mountbatten&#x27;s 5th Destroyer Flotilla was later ordered to merge with Mack&#x27;s fleet to increase its striking power. The destroyers , , , , and were a part of Mountbatten&#x27;s fleet. The cruisers and &quot;Gloucester&quot; accompanied the ships as part of the force. The strike force had considerable success, which justified basing it at Malta despite the danger from air attack. On 21 May, the force was sent to join the Battle of Crete. It was several months before the depleted strike force returned.

Further success was had by the Malta Convoys. An urgent supply convoy from Gibraltar to Alexandria (Operation Tiger) coincided with reinforcements for the Mediterranean Fleet, two small convoys from Egypt to Malta and 48 more Hurricanes flew off HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and in Operation Splice, with only the loss of the SS &quot;Empire Song&quot;, which hit a mine and sank with 10 Hurricane fighters and 57 tanks on board. Convoy &quot;Tiger&quot; transported 295 Matilda II tanks, new Crusader tanks and 24,000 tons of oil for operations in North Africa. They were completed on 12 May. I., II., and III.; StG 1 made a determined effort against &quot;Tiger&quot; and Malta without result.

The Axis air forces maintained air superiority; Hitler ordered &quot;Fliegerkorps X&quot; to protect Axis shipping, prevent Allied shipping passing through the central Mediterranean and neutralise Malta as an Allied base. Around 180 German and 300 Italian aircraft carried out the operation, and the RAF struggled to fly more than six or eight fighter sorties. Occasionally, 12 Hurricanes were flown in from British carriers but the replacements were soon used up. By mid-May, the central Mediterranean was again closed to Allied shipping and the DAK in North Africa was able to receive reinforcements, only 3% of its supplies, personnel and equipment being lost en route. From 11 April – 10 May, 111 Axis raids were carried out against military installations on Malta. Most of the heavy equipment in Grand Harbour was destroyed and the dry-docks could only be operated by hand. Efficiency of most workshops was reduced to 25% – 50%.

During the first four months of German operations, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; dropped 2,500 tons of high explosives on Malta. It was many more times the tonnage dropped by the Italians, but far short of the amount dropped the following year. More than 2,000 civilian buildings were destroyed as opposed to only 300 during the Italian siege. Civilian casualties were low, and after the bombing of HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot; most civilians moved to safer surroundings in the countryside; by May 1941, nearly 60,000 people had left the cities, some 11,000 people ( or 66% of the population) leaving Valletta. To illustrate the scale of the damage, by the close of 1941 approximately 70% of churches on the island had been reduced to rubble. The British had concentrated on protecting military targets and few shelters were available for civilians. Eventually, 2,000 miners and stonemasons were recruited to build public shelters but the pay was poor and the miners threatened to strike, and were threatened with conscription into the army. The workers capitulated but instituted a go-slow, trebling the cost of the work.

===German withdrawal===
In April, Hitler was forced to intervene in the Balkans which led to the campaign of that name; it was also known as the German invasion of Yugoslavia and included the Battle of Greece. The subsequent campaign and the heavy German losses in the Battle of Crete convinced Hitler that air drops behind enemy lines, using paratroopers, were no longer feasible unless surprise was achieved. German airborne forces did not undertake any such operations again. This had important consequences for Malta, as it indicated the island was only at risk from an Axis siege. When, in June, Hitler attacked the Soviet Union under Operation Barbarossa, &quot;Fliegerkorps X&quot; departed for the Eastern Front, and the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; was left to continue its highly effective air campaign against Malta in the coming months. Geisler, commanding the remnants of &quot;Fliegerkorps X&quot;, could only count upon mine-laying aircraft from &quot;Kampfgeschwader 4&quot; (KG 4) and Ju 87s in night operations. Supply issues were bad, the small German force left was forced to abandon operations on 22 April 1941. By early May 1941, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; had flown 1,465 bomber, 1,144 fighter and 132 reconnaissance missions for just 44 losses. III./&quot;Kampfgeschwader 30&quot; (KG 30) and III./&quot;Lehrgeschwader 1&quot; (KG 1) flew sporadic night attacks during April.

==Allied recovery (April–October 1941)==

===Hugh Lloyd===
On 1 June, Air Vice Marshal Forster Maynard, Malta&#x27;s Air Officer Commanding, was replaced by Air Commodore Hugh Lloyd. When he arrived on the island Lloyd found little to work with. Still, he had every intention of taking the offensive. Outside his office, in the underground headquarters at Lascaris, he hung a sign outside; &quot;Less depends on the size of the dog in the fight than on the size of the fight in the dog&quot;.

Within a few hours Lloyd had made an inspection tour of the airfields and the main workshops at Kalafrana. The state of the island was worse than he expected. The slackening of German air activity had allowed the number of aircraft to increase, but the RAF still had fewer than 60 machines of all types. Maintenance was difficult. Hardly any spare or replacement parts were available—spares had to be obtained by sifting through the debris of wrecks or by cannibalising undamaged aircraft. Furthermore, the airfields were too small; there was no heavy equipment to work with; and even the commonest sorts of tools, such as hammers and wrenches, were all but impossible to find. All refuelling had to be done by hand from individual drums. The shelter was also inadequate, so there was little protection for what equipment they did have. Most aircraft were clustered together on open runways, presenting tempting targets. At Kalafrana, all the buildings were close together and above ground. The single engine-repair facility on Malta was located right next to the only test benches. Lloyd himself said, &quot;a few bombs on Kalafrana in the summer of 1941 would have ruined any hope of Malta ever operating an air force&quot;.

Usually, the protection of air defences and naval assets on the island would have had priority. Certainly bringing in more supplies would have made greater strategic sense, before risking going on to the offensive and thus in turn risking the wrath of the enemy. But the period was an eventful one. In North Africa, the DAK was on the move and Rommel was pressing his army towards the Suez Canal and Alexandria in Egypt. RAF forces on Malta could not afford to sit idle; they could prevent Rommel&#x27;s advance, or slow it down, by striking at his supply lines. Malta was the only place from where British strike aircraft could launch their attacks. Lloyd&#x27;s bombers and a small flotilla of submarines were the only forces available to harass Rommel&#x27;s supply lines into the autumn. Only then did the surface fleets return to Malta to support the offensive.

===Allied reinforcement===
With the exception of coal, fodder, kerosene and essential civilian supplies were such that a reserve of 8–15 months was built up. Operation Substance was particularly successful in July 1941. The supplies included spares and aircraft. Around 60 bombers and 120 Hurricanes were now available. Around 65,000 tons eventually reached Malta in July despite heavy damage inflicted by the Italian navy and air forces. No supplies were sent in August, but Operation Halberd in September 1941 brought in 85,000 tons of supplies, shipped by nine merchant vessels escorted by one aircraft carrier, five cruisers and 17 destroyers. One cargo ship, the &quot;Imperial Star&quot; was sunk, and the battleship was damaged by a torpedo. This convoy proved critical to saving Malta, as its supplies were deemed to be essential when the Germans returned in December.

In mid-1941, new squadrons—No. 185 and No. 126—were formed and the defenders received the first cannon-armed Hurricane Mk IICs. Naval carriers flew in a total of 81 more fighters in April–May. By 12 May, there were 50 Hurricanes on the island. On 21 May, No. 249 Squadron RAF arrived, taking over from No. 261. 46 Squadron arrived in June, to be renumbered 126 Squadron. In May 1941, 47 Hurricanes were flown into the island. From May–December, the first Bristol Blenheim units (No. 113 Squadron RAF and 115 Squadron) began to arrive and Bristol Beaufighter units, 252 and 272 Squadrons. Malta was now being used as a base for supplying Egypt. Between July and December 1941, 717 RAF fighters passed through Malta and 514 left for North Africa. By early August, Malta now had 75 fighters and 230 anti-aircraft guns. Bristol Blenheim bombers also joined the defenders and began offensive operations.

Besides preparing for offensive operations and reinforcing the RAF on the island, Lloyd also rectified many of the deficiencies. Thousands of Maltese and 3,000 British Army soldiers were drafted in to better protect the airfields. Even technical staff, clerks and flight crews helped when required. Dispersal strips were built, repair shops were moved underground from dockyards and airfields. Underground shelters were also created in the belief that the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; would soon return. On 26 July, a night attack was carried out by Italian fast attack craft of the elite &quot;Decima Flottiglia MAS&quot; unit. The force was detected early on by a British radar facility, and the coastal artillery at Fort Saint Elmo opened fire on the Italians. In the attack, 15 men were killed and 18 captured, and most of the boats were lost. An MT boat hit St Elmo Bridge, which collapsed. The bridge was never restored, and it was only in 2011 that a new one was built in its place.

===Allied offensive===
The Allies were able to launch offensive operations from Malta and some 60% of Axis shipping was sunk in the second half of 1941. The DAK and its partners were not receiving the of supplies a month they needed, and as a result they were unable to resist a strong counter-offensive by British forces in Operation Crusader.

In July 62,276 tons of supplies were landed by the Axis, half of the figure in June. In September 1941, 830 Naval Air Squadron sank or damaged the ships &quot;Andrea Gritti&quot; (6,338 tons) and the &quot;Pietro Barbaro&quot; (6,330 tons). Ultra intercepts found that 3,500 tons of aerial bombs, 4,000 tons of ammunition, 5,000 tons of food, one entire tank workshop, 25 Bf 109 engines and 25 cases of glycol coolant for their engines were lost. Further success was had later in the month, although British losses from anti-aircraft fire from Italian ships were often heavy. One reason for accepting heavy losses was the difficulty in bombing accurately. Lloyd asked his bombers to attack at mast-height, increasing accuracy but making them easier targets for Italian anti-aircraft defences. Losses averaged 12% during this time. 38 Squadron, 40 Squadron and 104 Squadron, equipped with Wellington bombers, hit Axis convoys in Tripoli. In concert with Royal Navy submarines, the RAF and FAA sank 108 Axis ships (300,000 grt) between June and September. In September, 33% of the 96,000 tons of supplies dispatched were lost to British submarine and air attack.

Part of the reason for this favourable outcome in November 1941, was the arrival of Force K of the Royal Navy, which during the Battle of the Duisburg Convoy sank all the ships, which practically blockaded Libyan ports. Soon after, Force K was reinforced by the arrival in Malta of Force B with the light cruisers and and the K-class destroyers, &quot;Kimberley&quot; and &quot;Kingston&quot;, on 27 November. Joint operations with the RAF were so effective that during November 1941, Axis fuel losses amounted to 49,365 tons out of 79,208 tons. Among the contributors to the sinking of Axis shipping was 828 Naval Air Squadron, 830 Naval Air Squadron, the British 10th Naval Flotilla and 69 Squadron which shadowed convoys with their Maryland aircraft. Special flights of RAF Wellingtons fitted with air-to-surface vessel (ASV) radar, were important to Force K operations, and Ultra intelligence reached Malta on Axis convoy movements. The RAF Malta Command would then dispatch the ASV-Wellingtons to sweep the seas and direct the British naval forces to the convoy.

On 13 November, the carrier HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot;— returning to Gibraltar after transporting aircraft to Malta—was sunk by a U-boat. Twelve days later, the battleship was sunk by a U-boat, followed by the light cruiser on 15 December. On 19 December, ships from both forces ran into a minefield while pursuing an Italian convoy. Damage from the mines sank the cruiser &quot;Neptune&quot; and damaged the cruiser . The destroyer was also mined while attempting to assist &quot;Neptune&quot;. &quot;Kandahar&quot; was scuttled the next day by the destroyer . Following the disaster and with a resurgence of the Axis aerial bombardment of Malta, surface ships were withdrawn from the central Mediterranean in January 1942.

While Italian bombing was again proving successful against the British, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; returned in force in December 1941 to renew intensive bombing. The &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; sent nearly half of all the German U-boats on operations in the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean to support the effort against Malta and by 15 December, half of these vessels were either in the Mediterranean, or en route, having to run the gauntlet past the RAF and the navy based in Gibraltar. Until the return of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; over Malta, the RAF defenders had claimed 199 aircraft shot down from June 1940 to December 1941, while losses were at least 90 Hurricanes, three Fairey Fulmars and one Gladiator in air combat; 10 more Hurricanes and one Gladiator destroyed in accidents and many more destroyed on the ground. Eight Marylands, two other aircraft, three Beaufighters, one Blenheim fighter and many bombers were also lost. No. 185 Squadron claimed 18 destroyed, seven probable victories and 21 damaged for 11 killed or missing. Among those losses was Squadron Leader Peter &quot;Boy&quot; Mould. Actual Axis losses amounted to 135 bombers (80 German) and 56 fighters plus a number of other aircraft.

==Axis returns (December 1941 – August 1942)==

===Kesselring (&quot;OB Süd&quot;)===
By June 1941, Geisler had been moved to Libya to support the DAK in the North African Campaign. In the Mediterranean and on Malta, the Allies recovered and began offensive operations against Axis shipping bringing supplies to the DAK in North Africa. The mounting shipping supply losses affected Geisler&#x27;s ability to support Erwin Rommel and his forces, which caused tension between the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. Geisler was to be returned to Sicily with his remaining air strength to solve the issue. However, the Germans backed down over Italian protests. On 6 October Geisler did extend his air sector responsibilities to cover the Tripoli-Naples sea route to curtail losses. On 2 October, Hermann Göring, commander-in-chief of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; met with his &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; counterpart Francesco Pricolo, to discuss reinforcements. Hans Jeschonnek, Göring&#x27;s chief of staff, suggested sending &quot;Luftflotte 2&quot; and its commander Albert Kesselring to Sicily from the Eastern Front. Göring agreed, and was willing to send 16 &quot;Gruppen&quot; to Sicily, anticipating a Soviet collapse in the east; &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; II (Bruno Loerzer), arrived in January 1942, with Kesselring as &quot;Oberbefehlshaber Süd&quot; (&quot;OB Süd&quot;, Commander-in-Chief South) from 1 December 1941. Meanwhile, Pricolo was replaced by &quot;Generale di squadra aerea&quot; Rino Corso Fougier on 14 November after the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; &#x27;s failure to defend Axis convoys and to provide a anti-shipping capability.

===Axis pressure, Spitfire arrival===
Messerschmitt Bf 110s and Ju 88 night fighters from &quot;Zerstörergeschwader 26&quot; (ZG 26, Destroyer Wing 26) and &quot;Nachtjagdgeschwader 1&quot; (NJG 1, Night Fighter Wing 1), were flown into Sicily to support &quot;Fliegerkorps II&quot;. They quickly eliminated Malta&#x27;s striking force, which was beyond the range of fighter escort while over the Mediterranean. In the first two months, around 20 RAF bombers and reconnaissance aircraft were shot down. The success against Axis shipping soon dried up. The only notable triumph was the sinking of the 13,089-ton &quot;Victoria&quot; merchant ship, one of the fastest merchantmen afloat, by a Fairey Albacore of 826 Squadron, flown by Lieutenant Baxter Ellis, on 23 January.

Over the island, the defensive arm of the RAF was also put under pressure. Kesselring began 1942 with a raid on New Year&#x27;s Day, the 1,175th raid of the war. In January the RAF lost 50 Hurricanes on the ground and another eight shot down. Of the 340 fighters that had passed through or stayed on the island since the war began, only 28 remained. The Axis conducted 263 raids in that month, compared to 169 in December 1941. &quot;Fliegerkorps II&quot; was recovering from its losses in the Soviet Union, and could only contribute 118 aircraft in January but grew to 390 in March, reaching a peak strength of 425 aircraft.

One-third of raids were directed against airfields. At Ta&#x27; Qali, 841 tons of bombs were dropped, because the Germans believed the British were operating an underground hangar; the Germans used rocket-assisted PC 18000RS Panther bombs. The usual tactic involved a sweep ahead of the bombers by German fighters to clear the skies; this worked and air superiority was maintained. Only slight losses were suffered by the bombers. One notable loss was the &quot;Geschwaderkommodore&quot; of KG 77, Arved Crüger. Around 94 per cent of the attacks were in daylight and the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; supported the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; by flying 2,455 sorties in February and March.

Lieutenant-general William Dobbie was governor and commander in chief of Malta. Dobbie and the British naval and air commanders argued for modern aircraft, particularly Spitfires, to be sent to Malta. The AOC Middle East, Arthur Tedder, sent Group Captain Basil Embry to Malta to assess the situation. The pilots told Embry that the Hurricanes were useless and that the Spitfire was their only hope. They claimed that the Germans purposely flew in front of the Hurricanes in their Bf 109Fs to show off the performance superiority of their fighters. The squadron leaders argued the inferiority of their aircraft was affecting morale. Embry agreed and recommended that Spitfires be sent; the type began arriving in March 1942.

===Axis invasion plan===

On 29–30 April 1942, a plan for the invasion of the island was approved by Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini during a meeting at Berchtesgaden. It envisaged an airborne assault with one German and one Italian airborne division, under the command of German General Kurt Student. This would have been followed by a seaborne landing of two or three divisions protected by the &quot;Regia Marina&quot;. The Italians, in agreement with Kesselring, made the invasion of Malta the priority in the region. However, two major factors stopped Hitler from giving the operation the green light. The first was Erwin Rommel. Due to Kesselring&#x27;s pounding of the island the supply lines to North Africa had been secured. He was able to gain the ascendancy in North Africa once again. Although Rommel believed Malta should be invaded, he insisted the conquest of Egypt and the Suez Canal, not Malta, was the priority. The second was Hitler himself. After the Battle of Crete in May–June 1941, Hitler was nervous about using paratroopers to invade the island since the Crete campaign had cost these units heavy losses, and he started to procrastinate in making a decision. Kesselring complained. Hitler proposed a compromise. He suggested that if the Egyptian border was reached once again in the coming months (the fighting at the time was taking place in Libya), the Axis could invade in July or August 1942 when a full moon would provide ideal conditions for a landing. Although frustrated, Kesselring was relieved the operation had seemingly been postponed rather than shelved.

===RAF air superiority===

Before the Spitfires arrived, other attempts were made to reduce losses. In February 1942, Squadron Leader Stan Turner arrived to take over 249 Squadron. Lloyd had requested a highly experienced combat leader be sent and Turner&#x27;s experience flying with Douglas Bader over Europe meant he was qualified to lead the unit. He began the adoption of the loose finger-four formation to cut RAF losses by introducing more flexible tactics to compensate for technical inferiority. The outmoded Hurricanes still struggled against the very latest Bf 109Fs of &quot;Jagdgeschwader 53&quot; (JG 53) and Italian Macchi C.202s; the Junkers Ju 88 bomber also proved a difficult enemy. The Hurricanes had occasional victories against the Bf 109Fs; during one attack in February 1942 three managed to break up a raid by fifty Bf 109s.

On 7 March 1942, a contingent of sixteen Spitfire Mk Vs flew to Malta from the aircraft carrier as part of Operation Spotter. A further run by &quot;Eagle&quot; delivered nine Spitfires. The Club Run (delivery of aircraft to Malta by carrier) became more frequent through 1942. Then, despatched 47 more aircraft (Operation Calendar) on 13 April 1942. All but one reached the island. While the Spitfires were a match for the Axis aircraft, many of those delivered in March and April were destroyed on the ground and in the air, where they were outnumbered; for five days in April there was just one Spitfire available to defend the island, for two days there were none. The Germans had watched their delivery and pressed home heavy attacks. By 21 April 1942 just 27 Spitfires were still airworthy and by evening that had fallen to 17. The overwhelming Axis bombardments had also substantially eroded Malta&#x27;s offensive naval and air capabilities. By March–April 1942, it was clear the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; had achieved a measure of air superiority. The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; also pressed home attacks with determination. Often, three to five Italian bombers would fly very low over their targets and drop their bombs with precision, regardless of the RAF attacks and ground fire.

Along with the advantage in the air, the Germans soon discovered that British submarines were operating from Manoel Island, not Grand Harbour, and exploited their air superiority to eliminate the threat. The base came under attack, the vessels had to spend most of their time submerged and the surrounding residences where crews had enjoyed brief rest periods were abandoned. Mine-laying by Axis aircraft also caused a steady rise in submarine losses. By the end of March 1942, 19 submarines had been lost. The effectiveness of the air attacks against Allied naval assets was apparent in the Italian naval records. In April, 150,389 tons of supplies that were sent to North Africa from Italy reached their destination out of a total of 150,578. Hitler&#x27;s strategy of neutralising Malta by siege seemed to be working. Kesselring reported to the German High Command that &quot;There is nothing left to bomb&quot;. Between 20 March and 28 April 1942, the Germans flew 11,819 sorties against the island and dropped 6,557 tons of bombs (3,150 tons on Valletta). The Germans lost 173 aircraft in the operations.

The Allies moved to increase the number of Spitfires on the island. On 9 May, &quot;Wasp&quot; and &quot;Eagle&quot; delivered 64 more Spitfires (Operation Bowery). Malta now had five full Spitfire squadrons; 126 Squadron, 185 Squadron, 249 Squadron, 601 Squadron and 603 Squadron. The impact of the Spitfires was apparent. On 9 May, the Italians announced 37 Axis losses. On 10 May, the Axis lost 65 aircraft destroyed or damaged in large air battles over the island. The Hurricanes were able to focus on the Axis bombers and dive-bombers at lower heights, while the Spitfires, with their superior rate of climb, engaged enemy aircraft at higher levels. From 18 May to 9 June, &quot;Eagle&quot; made three runs carrying another 76 Spitfires to Malta. With such a force established, the RAF had the firepower to deal with any Axis attacks.

By the spring of 1942, the Axis air forces ranged against the island were at their maximum strength. The main adversaries for the defenders were the 137 Bf 109Fs of JG 53 and II./JG 3 &#x27;Udet&#x27; and the 80 Macchi C.202s of the 4th and 51st &quot;Stormo&quot;. Bomber units included 199 Ju 88s of II./&quot;Lehrgeschwader 1&quot;, II and III./&quot;Kampfgeschwader 77&quot;, I./&quot;Kampfgeschwader 54&quot;, and 32–40 Ju 87s. In May the numerical and technical improvements in the RAF defences wrested air superiority from the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. By the end of May 1942, Kesselring&#x27;s forces had been reduced to just 13 serviceable reconnaissance aircraft, six Bf 110s, 30 Bf 109s and 34 bombers (mostly Ju 88s): a total of 83 compared with several hundred aircraft two months earlier.

===Axis target convoys===

After the battles of May and June, the air attacks were much reduced in August and September. While air superiority had been won back by the RAF, German pressure had allowed Axis convoys to re-supply the Panzer Army Africa. The island appeared to the Axis forces to be neutralised as a threat to their convoys. Rommel could now look forward to offensive operations with the support of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; in North Africa. At the Battle of Gazala he won a major victory, while the Battle of Bir Hakeim was less successful. Even so, he was soon back in Egypt fighting at El Alamein.

Despite the reduction in direct air pressure over Malta itself, the situation on the island was serious. It was running out of all essential commodities, particularly food and water, as the bombing had crippled pumps and distribution pipes. Clothing was also hard to come by. All livestock had been slaughtered, and the lack of leather meant people were forced to use curtains and used tyres to replace clothing and shoe soles. Although the civilian population was enduring, the threat of starvation was very real. Poor nutrition and sanitation led to the spread of disease. Soldiers&#x27; rations were also reduced, from four to two thousand calories a day and the British prepared to supply the island with two convoy operations.

In June, the Royal Navy sent two convoys, Operation Harpoon from Gibraltar and Operation Vigorous from Haifa and Port Said, to Malta. The move was designed to split Axis naval forces attempting to intervene. Lloyd the AOC, wanted to give No. 601 Squadron over to convoy escort duty. Although he could afford this diversion, he could maintain a standing patrol of only four Spitfires over the convoy. If Axis aircraft attacked as they were withdrawing, they had to stay and fight. Bailing out if the pilots ran low on fuel was the only alternative to landing on Malta. The pilots had to hope that they would be picked up by the ships. The western convoy lost the destroyer , three merchants and a tanker after being engaged by the Italian cruisers and , supported by a number of destroyers and Axis aircraft. The Polish destroyer was sunk and another merchant was damaged by mines near Malta. The eastern convoy was forced to turn back after a series of naval and air engagements, despite the British ships still having 20% of their ammunition left—it was considered insufficient to see them into Malta, especially with the Italian fleet still in the area and ready to intercept them. The losses of the convoy were heavy. Among the British losses was the cruiser . Three destroyers and 11 merchant vessels were also sunk. Malta sent Bristol Beauforts to engage the Italian fleet and German U-boats attacking the convoy. They torpedoed and sank the heavy cruiser and damaged the battleship . Two freighters of the western convoy reached Malta and delivered supplies, making them the only ships out of a total of 17 to deliver their loads, 25,000 tons of supplies. A further 16 Malta-based pilots were lost in the operations.

In August, the Operation Pedestal convoy brought vital relief to the besieged island, but at heavy cost. It was attacked from the sea and from the air. Some 146 Ju 88s, 72 Bf 109s, 16 Ju 87s, 232 Italian fighters, and 139 Italian bombers (a large number being the highly effective SM.79 torpedo bomber) took part in the action against the convoy. Out of the 14 merchant ships sent, nine were sunk. Moreover, the aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Eagle&quot;, one cruiser and three destroyers were sunk by a combined effort from the Italian Navy, &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, and &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. Nevertheless, the operation, though costly in lives and ships, was vital in bringing in much-needed war materials and supplies. British destroyers saved 950 of &quot;Eagle&quot;″s crew. The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; had played the central role against the convoy. Indeed, according to Sadkovich and others, to pretend that the air offensive against Malta had been a purely German affair is misleading. According to Sadkovich,

The surface convoys were not the only supply line to Malta. British submarines also made a substantial effort. The submarine was converted into an underwater supply ship. She could not go as deep or dive as quickly as the T- and U-class types, but she still made nine supply missions to Malta, which was more than any other vessel of its type. The ability of the submarine to carry large loads enabled it to be of great value in the campaign to lift the siege.

===Arrival of Keith Park===
In July, Lloyd was relieved of RAF command on Malta. It was felt that a man with past experience of fighter defence operations was needed. For some reason, the Air Staff did not choose to do this earlier, when the bombing ceased in 1941, and the RAF forces on Malta became primarily fighter-armed while the principal aim changed to one of air defence. Air Vice Marshal Keith Park replaced Lloyd as AOC. Park arrived on 14 July 1942 by flying boat. He landed in the midst of a raid although Lloyd had specifically requested he circle the harbour until it had passed. Lloyd met Park and admonished him for taking an unnecessary risk.

Park had faced Kesselring before during the Battle of Britain. During that battle, Park had advocated sending small numbers of fighters into battle to meet the enemy. There were three fundamental reasons for this. First, there would always be fighters in the air covering those on the ground if one did not send their entire force to engage at once. Second, small numbers were quicker to position and easier to move around. Third, the preservation of his force was critical. The fewer fighters he had in the air (he advocated 16 at most), the smaller target the numerically superior enemy would have. Over Malta, he reversed these tactics owing to changed circumstances. With plenty of Spitfires to operate, Park sought to intercept the enemy and break up his formations before the bombers reached the island. Until this point, the Spitfires had fought defensively. They scrambled and headed south to gain height, then turned around to engage the enemy over the island.

Now, with improved radar and quicker take off times (two to three minutes) and improved air-sea rescue, more offensive action became possible. Using three squadrons, Park asked the first to engage the escorting fighters by &#x27;bouncing them&#x27; out of the sun. The second would strike at the close escort, or, if unescorted, the bombers themselves. The third was to attack the bombers head-on. The impact of Park&#x27;s methods was instant. His &quot;Forward Interception Plan&quot;, issued officially on 25 July 1942, forced the Axis to abandon daylight raids within six days. The Ju 87s were withdrawn from operations over Malta altogether. Kesselring responded by sending in fighter sweeps at even higher altitudes to gain the tactical advantage. Park retaliated by ordering his fighters to climb no higher than . While this did give away a considerable height advantage, it forced the Bf 109s to descend to altitudes more suitable for the Spitfire than the German fighter. The methods would have great effect in October when Kesselring returned.

==Allied victory (October–November 1942)==

===British offensive operations===
While the RAF and Royal Navy defensive operations dominated for the most part, offensive strikes were still being carried out. The year 1942 was particularly impressive for offensive operations as well. Two-thirds of the Italian merchant fleet was sunk; 25% by British submarines, 37% by Allied aircraft. Axis forces in North Africa were denied around half of their supplies and two-thirds of their oil.

The submarines of Simpson&#x27;s 10th Flotilla were on patrol constantly, except for the period May–July 1942, when Kesselring made a considerable effort against their bases. Their success was not easy to achieve, given most of them were the slow U-class types. Supported by S- and T-class vessels, they dropped mines. British submarine commanders became aces while operating from Malta. Commanders Ian McGeoch (commanding ), Hugh &quot;Rufus&quot; Mackenzie and David Wanklyn had particular success. Lieutenant Commander Lennox Napier sank the German tanker &quot;Wilhelmsburg&quot; (7,020 tons). It was one of the few German tankers exporting oil from Romania. The loss of the ship led Hitler to complain directly to Karl Dönitz, while comparing the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; unfavourably with the Royal Navy. Dönitz argued that he did not have the resources to protect the convoy, though the escort of the ship exceeded that which the Allies could have afforded to give a large convoy in the Atlantic at that point in the war. It was fortunate for Dönitz that Hitler did not probe the defence of the ship further.

The submarine proved to be one of the most potent weapons in the British armoury when combating Axis convoys. Simpson, and George Phillips, who replaced him on 23 January 1943, had much success. The estimated tonnage sunk by British U-class submarines alone was 650,000 tons, with another 400,000 tons damaged. The island base, HMS &quot;Talbot&quot;, supplied 1,790 torpedoes at that time. The number fired by the 10th Flotilla was 1,289, with a hit rate of 30%. The Chief of Staff of the DAK, Fritz Bayerlein once claimed: &quot;We should have taken Alexandria and reached the Suez Canal had it not been for the work of your submarines&quot;.
Wing Commander Patrick Gibbs and 39 Squadron, flew their Beauforts against shipping and increased the pressure on Rommel by attacking his supply lines in September. Rommel&#x27;s position was now critical. The army in North Africa was starved of supplies while the British reinforced their lines in Egypt, prior to the Second Battle of El Alamein. He complained to the OKW that he was severely short of ammunition and fuel for offensive action. The Axis organised a convoy to relieve the difficulties. Ultra intercepted the Axis communications, and Wellingtons of 69 Squadron confirmed the Axis operation was real. Gibbs&#x27;s Beauforts sank two ships and one of Simpson&#x27;s submarines sank a third. Rommel still hoped another tanker, &quot;San Andreas&quot;, would deliver the 3,198 tons of fuel needed for the Battle of Alam el Halfa. Rommel did not wait for it to dock, and launched the offensive before its arrival. The ship was sunk by an attack led by Gibbs. Of the nine ships sent, five were sunk by Malta&#x27;s forces. The Beauforts were having a devastating impact on Axis fuel supplies which were now nearly used up. On 1 September, Rommel was forced to retreat. Kesselring handed over &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; fuel, but this merely denied the German air units the means to protect the ground forces, thereby increasing the effectiveness of British air superiority over the frontline.

In August, Malta&#x27;s strike forces had contributed to the Axis&#x27; difficulties in trying to force an advance into Egypt. In that month, 33% of supplies and 41% of fuel were lost. In September 1942, Rommel received only 24% of the 50,000 tons of supplies needed monthly to continue offensive operations. During September, the Allies sank 33,939 tons of shipping at sea. Many of these supplies had to be brought in via Tripoli, many kilometres behind the battle front. The lack of food and water caused a sickness rate of 10% among Axis soldiers. The British air-submarine offensive ensured no fuel reached North Africa in the first week of October 1942. Two fuel-carrying ships were sunk, and another lost its cargo despite the crew managing to salvage the ship. As the British offensive at El Alamein began on 23 October 1942, Ultra intelligence was gaining a clear picture of the desperate Axis fuel situation. On 25 October, three tankers and one cargo ship carrying fuel and ammunition were sent under heavy air and sea escort, and were likely to be the last ships to reach Rommel while he was at El Alamein. Ultra intelligence intercepted the planned convoy route, and alerted Malta&#x27;s air units. The three fuel-carrying vessels were sunk by 28 October. It cost the British one Beaufighter, two Beauforts, three (out of six) Blenheims and one Wellington. Rommel lost 44% of his supplies on October, a jump from the 20% lost in September.

===Siege lifted===
By August 1942, 163 Spitfires were on hand to defend Malta of which 120 were serviceable. On 11 and 17 August and 24 October 1942, under the respective actions, Operation Bellows, Operation Baritone and Operation Train, HMS &quot;Furious&quot; brought another 85 Spitfires to Malta. Often, the Spitfires were asked to undertake flights of five and a half hours; this was achieved using 170-gallon ferry tanks. The ferry tanks, combined with a 29-gallon tank in the rear fuselage, brought the total tank capacity up to 284 gallons.

Despite the success of Allied convoys in getting through, the month was as bad as any other, combining bombing with food shortages. In response to the threat Malta was now posing to Axis supply lines, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; renewed its attacks on Malta in October 1942. Recognising the critical battle was approaching in North Africa (the Second Battle of El Alamein), Kesselring organised &quot;Fliegerkorps II&quot; in Sicily to neutralise the threat once and for all. On 11 October, the defenders were mass equipped with Spitfire Mk VB/Cs. Over 17 days, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; suffered 34 Ju 88s and 12 Bf 109s destroyed and 18 damaged. RAF losses amounted to 23 Spitfires shot down and 20 crash-landed. The British lost 12 pilots killed. On 16 October, it was clear to Kesselring that the defenders were too strong. He called off the offensive. The situation in North Africa required German air support, so the October offensive marked the last major effort by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; against Malta.

==Aftermath==
The losses left the Axis air forces in a depleted state. They could not offer the air support needed at the frontline. The situation on the island was still stringent going into November, but Park&#x27;s victory in the air battle was soon followed by news of a major success at the front. At El Alamein in North Africa the British had broken through on land, and by 5 November were advancing rapidly westward. News soon reached Malta of Operation Torch, the Allied landing in Vichy French Morocco and French Algeria on 8 November. Some 11 days later, news of the Soviet counterattack during the Battle of Stalingrad increased morale even more. The extent to which the success in North Africa benefited Malta was apparent when a convoy (Operation Stoneage) reached Malta from Alexandria on 20 November virtually unscathed. This convoy is seen as the end of the two-year siege of Malta. On 6 December, another supply convoy under the codename Operation Portcullis reached Malta without suffering any losses. After that, ships sailed to Malta without joining convoys. The capture of North African airfields and the bonus of having air protection all the way to the island enabled the ships to deliver 35,000 tons. In early December, another 55,000 tons arrived. The last air raid over Malta occurred on 20 July 1943. It was the 3,340th alert since 11 June 1940.

In addition 111 churches, 50 hospitals, institutions or colleges, 36 theatres, clubs, government offices, banks, factories, flour mills and other commercial buildings suffered destruction or damage, a total of 30,000 buildings in all. The Royal Opera House, Auberge d&#x27;Auvergne, Auberge de France and Palazzo Correa in Valletta, the Birgu Clock Tower, Auberge d&#x27;Allemagne and Auberge d&#x27;Italie in Birgu, parts of the fortifications of Senglea, and the Governor&#x27;s House of Fort Ricasoli were destroyed. Other buildings such as Auberge de Castille, Auberge de Bavière, the Casa del Commun Tesoro and parts of Fort Manoel also suffered extensive damage but were rebuilt after the war. A War Damage Commission was set up to compensate those whose property was destroyed or damaged during the war.

===Axis shipping losses===

Total Axis losses in the Mediterranean were moderate. Human casualties amounted to 17,240 personnel at sea. In supplies, the Axis lost 315,090 tons. This was more than reached Malta. The Allied navies sank 773 Axis ships, totalling 1,364,337 t (1,342,789 long tons). Mines sank another 179 ships of 214,109 tons in total. The navies and air forces shared in the destruction of 25 ships for 106,050 tons and aircraft sank 1,326 ships, for a total of 1,466,208 tons. Mines and naval craft shared a further ship destroyed between them, of 1,778 tons. In all, 2,304 Axis ships were sunk, with a combined tonnage of 3,130,969.

==In popular culture==

===In film===
* The war propaganda short film &quot;Malta G.C.&quot; was commissioned in 1942 by the British government to popularise the endurance of the Maltese people and the awarding of the George Cross. It features real footage of the bombings and their effects.
* The 1953 British film &quot;Malta Story&quot; is the fictional story of a photo reconnaissance RAF pilot in Malta during the siege. It features real footage and re-enactments with authentic aircraft.

===In literature===

In his novel &quot;The Kappillan of Malta&quot; (1973) Nicholas Monsarrat gives an account of the siege of Malta from June 1940 to August 1942 as experienced by the fictional Catholic priest Father Salvatore. The novel is interspersed with brief episodes from other periods of Maltese history.

Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s 1963 debut novel &quot;V.&quot; features a chapter devoted to life during the siege of Malta.

In his 2016 novel &quot;Everyone Brave is Forgiven,&quot; Chris Cleave presents the misery and horror of the siege through the eyes of British officers whose experiences are loosely based on those of his grandfather David Hill, who served in the Royal Artillery.
