<text>Sir John Harington (4 August 1560 – 20 November 1612), of Kelston, Somerset, England, but born in London, was an English courtier, author and translator popularly known as the inventor of the flush toilet. He became prominent at Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s court, and was known as her &quot;saucy Godson&quot;, but his poetry and other writings caused him to fall in and out of favour with the Queen. He was the author of the description of a flush-toilet forerunner installed in his Kelston house, appearing in &quot;A New Discourse of a Stale Subject, called the Metamorphosis of Ajax&quot; (1596), a political allegory and coded attack on the monarchy which is nowadays his best-known work.

==Early life and family==

Harington was born in Kelston, Somerset, England, the son of poet John Harington of Stepney (b.c.1529) and his second wife Isabella Markham, a gentlewoman of Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s privy chamber. He was the grandson of an Alexander Harington of Stepney, London; about whom little is known. He was honoured as a godson of the childless Elizabeth, one of 102.

He was educated at Eton and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

Harington married Mary Rogers, daughter of George Rogers of Cannington (son of Sir Edward Rogers) and Jane Winter, on 6 September 1583.

==Courtier under Elizabeth I==
Although he had studied the law, Harington was attracted early in life to the royal court, where his free-spoken attitude and poetry gained Elizabeth&#x27;s attention. Elizabeth encouraged his writing, but Harington was inclined to overstep the mark in his somewhat Rabelaisian and occasionally risqué pieces.

His attempt at a translation of Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; caused his banishment from court for some years. Angered by the raciness of his translations, Elizabeth told Harington that he was to leave and not return until he had translated the entire poem. She chose this punishment rather than actually banishing him, but she considered the task so difficult that it was assumed Harington would not bother to comply. Harington, however, chose to follow through with the request and completed the translation in 1591. It received great praise, and is one of the translations still read by English speakers today.

One of his epigrams is widely quoted:
: Treason doth never prosper? What&#x27;s the reason?
: for if it prosper, none dare call it treason.

Around that time, Harington also devised England&#x27;s first flushing toilet – called the Ajax (i.e., a &quot;jakes&quot;, then a slang word for toilet). It was installed at his manor in Kelston. This forerunner to the modern flush toilet had a flush valve to let water out of the tank, and a wash-down design to empty the bowl. What it lacked was an S-bend or U-bend to curb noxious smells, which was later invented by Alexander Cumming. Many toilet manufacturers have had the name &quot;John&quot; as part of the company&#x27;s title, and there is dispute over whether the current American term &quot;john&quot; has any connection with Harington as its inventor.

In 1596, Harington, under the pseudonym Misacmos, wrote a book called &quot;A New Discourse upon a Stale Subject: The Metamorphosis of Ajax&quot; about his invention. The book made political allusions to the Earl of Leicester, which angered Elizabeth. It was a coded attack on the &quot;stercus&quot; or excrement that was poisoning society with torture and state-sponsored &quot;libels&quot; against his relatives Thomas Markham and Ralph Sheldon. After its publication, he was again banished from the court. Elizabeth&#x27;s mixed feelings for him may have been the only thing that saved Harington from being tried at the Star Chamber.

===Campaigns in Ireland===
In 1599, Elizabeth sent an army, led by Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, to Ireland during the Nine Years War (1594–1603), to subdue a major rebellion by the Gaelic chieftains, led by Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone. After her strong recommendation that Essex include him in his army, Harington was put in command of horsemen under Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton. Harington&#x27;s legacy from this campaign was his letters and journal, which served to give Elizabeth good intelligence about the progress of the campaign and its politics. Harington wrote: &quot;I have informed myself reasonably well of the whole state of the country, by observation and conference: so I count the knowledge I have gotten here worth more than half the three hundred pounds this journey hath cost me.&quot; During the campaign, Essex conferred a knighthood on Harington for his services. Essex fell into disfavour with Elizabeth for concluding the campaign by making a truce with Tyrone, which amounted to a virtual capitulation to the Irish rebels – she snapped at Essex: &quot;If I had meant to abandon Ireland, it had been superfluous to send you there&quot; – and for the large number of knighthoods he awarded.

Harington, present at the truce negotiations, accompanied Essex back to court to account to Elizabeth, but met with royal wrath: &quot;Tell my witty godson to get him home ... it is no season to fool it here!&quot; However, his wit and charm soon secured forgiveness: despite his closeness to Essex, he survived his downfall with his own reputation more or less unsullied. During what proved to be the Queen&#x27;s last Christmas, he tried to lighten her mounting moods of melancholy by reading from his comic verses. Elizabeth thanked him, but said sadly, &quot;When thou dost feel creeping time at thy gate, these fooleries will please thee less – I am past my relish for such matters&quot;.

==Courtier under James I==
After the Queen&#x27;s death, Harington&#x27;s fortunes faltered at the court of the new King, James I. He had stood surety for his cousin Sir Griffin Markham&#x27;s debts of £4000, when Markham had become involved in the Bye and Main Plots. Not able to meet his cousin&#x27;s debts without selling his own lands, and unwilling to languish in gaol, he escaped from custody in October 1603. However, James I had already recognised his loyalty and granted him the properties forfeited on Markham&#x27;s exile.

He claimed to be unhappy at James&#x27;s court, owing specifically to the heavy drinking by both sexes, but in fact, he seems to have derived amusement from the antics of the courtiers. He left a description of a disastrous attempt by Sir Robert Cecil to stage a masque at Theobalds in honour of a visit by the King&#x27;s brother-in-law, Christian IV of Denmark in 1606, when some of the players were too drunk to stand up: &quot;The entertainment and show went forward, and most of the presenters went backward, or fell down, wine did so occupy their upper chambers.&quot;

Towards the end of his life, Harington tutored Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales. He annotated for him a copy of Francis Godwin&#x27;s &quot;De praesulibus Angliae&quot; (Of the rulers of England). Harington&#x27;s grandson, John Chetwind published these annotations in 1653 under the title &quot;A Briefe View of the State of the Church&quot;. While tutoring the Prince, Harington also translated from Italian to English verse &quot;Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum&quot; (Health regimen of the School of Salernum), a medieval collection of health tips. The translation was published in 1607 in London.

Harington fell ill in May 1612 and died on 20 November 1612 at the age of 52, soon after Henry Frederick, who had died on 6 November. He was buried in Kelston.

==In popular culture==
In the television series &quot;South Park&quot;, Harington appears as a ghost in the episode &quot;Reverse Cowgirl&quot;. He explains how to use his invention, the toilet, properly.

<doc id="788079" wikidata="Q54543" url="?curid=788079" title="Helen Wills">
<text>Helen Newington Wills (October 6, 1905 – January 1, 1998), also known by her married names Helen Wills Moody and Helen Wills Roark, was an American tennis player. She won 31 Grand Slam tournament titles (singles, doubles, and mixed doubles) during her career, including 19 singles titles.

Wills was the first American woman athlete to become a global celebrity, making friends with royalty and film stars despite her preference for staying out of the limelight. She was admired for her graceful physique and for her fluid motion. She was part of a new tennis fashion, playing in knee-length pleated skirts rather than the longer ones of her predecessors, and was known for wearing her hallmark white visor. Unusually, she practiced against men to hone her craft, and she played a relentless predominantly baseline game, wearing down her female opponents with power and accuracy. In February 1926 she played a high-profile and widely publicized match against Suzanne Lenglen which was called the Match of the Century.

Wills had a 180-match win streak from 1927 until 1933. In 1933, she beat the eighth-ranked US male player in an exhibition match. Her record of eight wins at Wimbledon was not surpassed until 1990 when Martina Navratilova won her ninth. She was said to be &quot;arguably the most dominant tennis player of the 20th century&quot;, and has been called by some (including Jack Kramer, Harry Hopman, Mercer Beasley, Don Budge, and AP News) the greatest female player in history.

==Early life==

She was born as Helen Newington Wills on October 6, 1905, in Centerville, Alameda County, California (now Fremont), near San Francisco. She was the only child of Clarence A. Wills, a physician and surgeon at Alameda County Infirmary and Catherine Anderson, who had graduated with a B.S. degree in Social Science at the University of California at Berkeley. Her parents had married on July 1, 1904, in Yolo County, California.

She was tutored by her mother at home until she was eight years old. After her father enlisted in the military in December 1917 and was posted in France with the American Expeditionary Forces her mother enrolled her at Bishop Hopkins Hall in Burlington, Vermont. When World War I ended the family moved back to Northern California, to Berkeley, where they took up residence near Live Oak Park. Wills enrolled as a ninth-grader at the Anna Head School, a private day and boarding school, where she graduated in 1923 at the top of her class. Her father&#x27;s family grew wheat and kept a ranch near Antioch, and she occasionally practiced her tennis game nearby at the Byron Hot Springs resort. Wills attended the University of California, Berkeley, as both her parents had done, on an academic scholarship, and graduated in 1925 as a member of Phi Beta Kappa honor society.

When she was eight years old, her father bought her a tennis racket and they practiced on the dirt courts next to the Alameda County Hospital as well as at Live Oak Park. Wills&#x27; interest in tennis was kindled after watching exhibition matches by famous Californian players including May Sutton, Bill Johnston and her particular favorite, Maurice McLoughlin. In August 1919, she joined the Berkeley Tennis Club as a junior member on the advice of tennis coach William &quot;Pop&quot; Fuller who was a friend of her father. In the spring of 1920, she practiced for a few weeks with Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman, four-time winner of the U.S. Championships singles title, on strokes, footwork and tactics.

== Tennis career ==
=== 1919-21: First tournaments and titles ===
In September 1919, at the age of 13, she entered her first tournament, the California State Championships, held at her own Berkeley Tennis Club. After a bye in the first round she lost in two close sets to Marjorie Wale. Reporting on the tournament the San Francisco Examiner commented that &quot;she will bear watching in the future&quot;. By the end of 1919 she was the 7th ranked junior player in California. In 1920 she competed in four tournaments in Northern California (Sacramento, Berkeley and San Francisco) and at the end of 1920 she was the 9th ranked singles player in California. In July 1921 she traveled to the East Coast for the first time where she played in four warm-up tournaments on grass in preparation for the U.S. Girls National Championships in Forest Hills. The trip was sponsored by the California Tennis Association. In September 1921, Wills won the singles and doubles titles at the California State Championships, defeating Helen Baker in the final in three sets. At the end of 1921 Wills was ranked No. 14 in the national singles, No. 2 in the Californian ranking, behind Helen Baker and No. 1 in the national juniors.

=== 1922: U.S. Championships finalist ===
In May 1922 she won the singles title at the Pacific Coast Championships, beating Ream Leachman in the final. During Wills&#x27;s run of East Coast grass court tournaments in the run up to the U.S. Championships she lost four times to Leslie Bancroft. At the 1922 U.S. Championships she participated for the first time in the women&#x27;s singles event and reached the final, losing just one set to Marion Zinderstein Jessup in the quarterfinal. The New York Times described the final between 16-year old Wills against 38-year old six-time champion Molla Mallory as the &quot;battle of youth against experience&quot;. Mallory won the final in two sets to gain her seventh title. Wills won her first Grand Slam title in the doubles event, partnering Zinderstein Jessup, after a three-sets victory in the final against Mallory and Edith Sigourney. Partnering Howard Kinsey she was runner-up in the mixed doubles event to Mary Browne and Bill Tilden. She also took part in the girls&#x27; singles championship and successfully defended her 1921 title. At the end of the year she was the No. 3 ranked singles player nationally and the top-ranked player in California.

=== 1923: First U.S. Championships title ===
Wills defended her Pacific Coast Championships singles title in June when she defeated Charlotte Hosmer in the final. On August 10, 1923 Wills made her debut in the inaugural Wightman Cup, the annual team tennis competition for women contested between teams from the United States and Great Britain. She won both her singles matches against Mabel Clayton and Kitty McKane as well as her doubles match with Mallory. Directly following the Wightman Cup she entered the U.S. Championships and won her first women&#x27;s U.S. national title at the age of 17 after a straight-sets victory in the final against seven-time champion Molla Mallory, making her the youngest champion at that time. After returning to California she won her final tournament of the year, the California State Championships, against Hosmer in the final. She finished the year ranked No. 1 in California as well as nationally. A. Wallis Myers of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; ranked her No. 3 in the world behind Lenglen and McKane.

=== 1924: Olympic and U.S. champion ===
During the winter months Wills worked on her game and according to her trainer Pop Fuller she had improved her overhead, service and footwork. In April the United States Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA) selected Wills for the Olympic team and for the Wightman Cup and the Wimbledon Championships leading up to the Olympics. On May 14 Wills departed New York on board the RMS &quot;Berengaria&quot; for her first trip to Europe. There was excitement in the press about the prospect of an encounter with Suzanne Lenglen, the French world No. 1 player and five-time Wimbledon champion. Upon her arrival in England Wills focused on practice sessions to get accustomed to the grass courts instead of playing warm-up tournaments. The Wightman Cup was played in June on the Wimbledon grass courts at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. Wills lost both her singles matches, to Phyllis Covell and Kitty McKane, but won the doubles with Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman. Wills entered her first Wimbledon Championships a few days after the conclusion of the Wightman Cup. She came through the draw with ease and reached the final without the loss of a set. Her opponent in the final McKane had received a walkover in the semifinal after Lenglen withdrew due to illness. Wills won the first set and led 4–1 in the second with a game point for 5–1 but McKane staged a comeback with attacking play and won the next two sets, and the title, against a tiring Wills. It would be Will&#x27;s only loss in the Wimbledon singles event during her career. She did win the doubles event partnering Hotchkiss Wightman, her first Wimbledon title, after a win in two sets in the final against Covell and McKane.

Wills entered the singles and doubles competitions at the 1924 Olympics in Paris, France. The tennis tournament was played on outdoor clay courts at the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir in Colombes, a northwestern suburb of Paris. It was the last Olympics where tennis was a medal event until the sport returned at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Wills won the Olympic gold medal in both the singles and doubles events. In the singles event she had a bye in the first round and won her next four matches in straight sets to reach the final which was played on July 19. Her opponent in the final was Julie Vlasto of France who was defeated in two sets. In the doubles event she partnered veteran Hazel Wightman. The team reached the semifinal without playing, after a bye in the first round followed by two walkovers. The final against Covell and McKane was a repeat of the Wimbledon final and again the result was a two-sets victory for Wightman and Wills. In early August she returned to the United States to compete in the U.S. Championships. For the first time in her career she won all three titles in the singles, doubles and mixed doubles events. For the third successive year she played against Mallory in the singles final and like in 1923 won in straight sets. The mixed doubles event was played at the Longwood Cricket Club in Brookline where she partnered Vinnie Richards to win the final against Mallory and Tilden. In September she won the California State Championships against May Sutton in the final. She was again ranked No. 3 in the world behind Lenglen and McKane by A. Wallis Myers.

=== 1925: Third U.S. Championships title ===

On advice of her mother, Wills did not travel to Europe and therefore did not take part in the Wimbledon Championships or in the first French Championships that were open to players who were neither French citizens nor residents of France. Wills won an invitational tournament in Pasadena in February. In July, she traveled to the East Coast to play the tradition grass court warm-up events for the U.S. Nationals. She won the singles titles at the Longwood Invitational in Brookline, against Marion Zinderstein Jessup, and at the Essex Country Club Invitational against Mary Browne. At the Seabright Invitational she lost the final to Elizabeth Ryan who, playing without shoes, dealt better with the heavy, soggy courts which prevented Wills from playing her usual driving game. It would be her only singles loss of the year. At the New York State Championships in Westchester she defeated Mallory in the final in three sets. The third edition of the Wightman Cup was played in August at Forest Hills. Wills won both her singles matches against Joan Fry and McKane but lost the decisive doubles match with Mary Brown against Evelyn Colyer and McKane. At the U.S. Championships which started on August 17, she came back from being a set down in both the quarterfinal, against Fry, and the semifinal, against Eleanor Goss, to reach the singles final. In the final against McKane she again lost the first set but won the next two to win her third consecutive U.S. Championships title at the age of 19. In mid September she also won the California State Championships for the third consecutive time, defeating Lucy McCune in the final without the loss of a game. In late September A. Wallis Myers ranked Wills No. 2 in the world behind Lenglen. Also in September she was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society by the University of California.

=== 1926: Match of the Century and appendicitis ===
On January 6 Wills departed New York en route to Le Havre, France with the aim to compete in the clay court Riviera tournaments and play against Suzanne Lenglen. She stated that she also wanted to do sightseeing and study art. At the end of January she won the Metropole and Gallia tournaments in Cannes. On February 16, 1926, the 20-year-old Wills met 26-year-old Suzanne Lenglen, six-time Wimbledon champion, in the final of a tournament at the Carlton Club in Cannes in the Match of the Century. It was the only time they played each other in singles competition. Public anticipation of their match was immense, resulting in high scalper ticket prices. Roofs and windows of nearby buildings were crowded with spectators, including King Gustaf V of Sweden. Both players were nervous, with Lenglen drinking brandy and water at one point to calm her nerves. Lenglen won the match 6–3, 8–6 after being down 2–1 in the first set and 5–4 in the second set. Wills had a set point in the second set and believed she had won the point, but a linesman disagreed. In one of the few times she showed emotion on court, she spoke angrily to the linesman over the call. After the match, Lenglen&#x27;s father advised her that she would lose her next match to Wills if they met again soon, and Lenglen avoided Wills for the remainder of the spring. Following the Lenglen match Wills won the Riviera tournaments in Beaulieu, Monte Carlo, Menton, as well as the South of France Championships and the Cannes Club tournament. Lenglen did not take part in these singles events. Wills did not get a second chance to meet Lenglen due to an emergency appendectomy on June 5, during the French Championships, which caused her to default her second-round match and withdraw from Wimbledon, which also was considered a default. Lenglen turned professional after the 1926 season.

After she returned to the United States in July, Wills attempted a comeback from her appendectomy. She won the East Hampton tournament against Mary Brown but at Seabright she lost the final to Elizabeth Ryan for the second year running. After another defeat, in the semifinal of the New York State Championships to Mallory, and on the advice of her doctor, she withdrew from that year&#x27;s U.S. Championships and returned to Berkeley. She did not play any tournaments for the remainder of the year and instead focused on her studies at Berkeley. Apart from those two losses, beginning with the 1923 U.S. Championships, Wills lost only five matches in three years: once to Lenglen, twice to Kathleen McKane Godfree, and twice to Elizabeth Ryan. Wills had winning overall records against the latter two.

=== 1927: Wimbledon and U.S. champion ===
Wills&#x27; season started in March at the Hotel Huntington Invitation which she won in the final against Marrion Williams. Together with her mother she traveled to England in May and in June won the North London Championships against Elisabeth Ryan and the Kent Championships in Beckenham against Kitty McKane Godfree. She did not take part in the French Championships. At the Wimbledon Championships full seedings were used for the first time and Wills was the top-seeded singles player. She lost a set to Gwen Sterry in the first round, the last set she would lose in singles until 1933, but won all other matches in straight sets, including the final against fourth-seeded Lilí de Álvarez, to win her first Wimbledon singles title. Partnering Elizabeth Ryan she won her second Wimbledon doubles title against the South African pair of Bobbie Heine and Irene Peacock. Directly after Wimbledon she returned to the United States where she won the Essex Country Club Invitational, defeating 18-year old Helen Jacobs in the final. It was the first competitive encounter with Jacobs in what would become an intense rivalry. Wills won both her singles matches and her doubles with Hotchkiss Wightman to help the U.S. team win the fifth edition of the Wightman Cup against Great Britain. At the U.S. Championships in August she defeated Kea Bouman, winner of the French Championships, in the quarterfinal and Helen Jacobs in the semifinal to reach her fifth final, where she met 16-year old Betty Nuthall from Great Britain who served underhand. Wills was victorious in straight sets to win her fourth U.S. title. After the Championships she stayed in New York and did not play any tournaments for the rest of the year. For the first time in her career she was ranked No. 1 in the world by A. Wallis Myers, in front of Álvarez and Ryan.

=== 1928: French, Wimbledon and U.S. champion ===
The 1928 season started in April when Wills traveled to France to compete in the French Championships. She was seeded first in a field of 37 players and won the singles title with ease after a victory in the final against eighth-seeded Eileen Bennett. The &quot;American Lawn Tennis&quot; magazine commented that &quot;Miss Wills [...] so far outclasses the top flights of women throughout the world that she has no one who really can extend here.&quot; She was runner-up in the mixed doubles with Frank Hunter, losing the final to Eileen Bennett and Henri Cochet. Wills then traveled to The Hague in May to compete in an international match against the Netherlands, beating Madzy Rollin Couquerque and Kea Bouman, before traveling to the All England Club in London for the sixth edition of the Wightman Cup. Wills won both her singles matches but lost to deciding doubles match with Penelope Anderson against Eileen Bennett and Phoebe Holcroft Watson. At Wimbledon Wills, seeded first, won her second consecutive singles title, again after a two-sets victory in the final against Lilí de Álvarez. She did not take part in the doubles event and reached the semifinal of the mixed doubles with Francis Hunter. Upon return to the United States she defended her title at the Essex Country Club Invitational against Edith Cross and won at East Hampton against Helen Jacobs. At the U.S. Championships which started on August 20 Wills went through the tournament without losing a set and beat Helen Jacobs is the final. It was the first time two met in a Grand Slam final. With Hotchkiss Wightman she won the doubles final against compatriots Edith Cross and Anna McCune Harper and subsequently she traveled to Boston where she won the mixed doubles event partnering John Hawkes. In her autobiography &quot;Fifteen-Thirty&quot; she commented that Hawkes was the best mixed doubles partner she had ever played with. For the second time she was ranked No. 1 in the world by A. Wallis Myers, in front of Álvarez and Daphne Akhurst.

=== 1929: Defense of French, Wimbledon and U.S. titles ===

As in 1928 Wills&#x27; season started in April when she traveled to France to compete in the French Championships which started on May 20. Edith Cross joined her on the trip. She successfully defended her French singles title by defeating sixth-seeded home favorite Simonne Mathieu in the final. In the doubles event she teamed up with Edith Cross and lost in the quarterfinals to eventual champions Lilí de Álvarez and Kea Bouman. She played in the mixed doubles with Frank Hunter and were beaten in the final by the Anglo-French team of Eileen Bennett and Henri Cochet. Wills then played international matches, as part of a U.S. team, against the Netherlands in May, beating Madzy Rollin Couquerque and Kea Bouman, and against Germany, played at the Rot-Weiss Tennis Club in Berlin in June, where she won against Cilly Aussem and Paula von Reznicek. At the Wimbledon Championships a third final against Lilí de Álvarez was anticipated but instead Wills faced fifth-seeded Helen Jacobs, their first encounter in a Grand Slam final. Wills won her third consecutive Wimbledon singles title in straight sets. With Edith Cross she lost in the third round of the doubles to Ermyntrude Harvey but won the mixed doubles title with Frank Hunter against Ian Collins and Joan Fry. In the seventh edition of the Wightman Cup, played on August 8 and 9 at the West Side Tennis Club, Wills won both her singles matches, including a close two-sets win against Betty Nuthall, to help the U.S. team reclaim the cup but lost her doubles match with Cross against Phoebe Holcroft Watson and Peggy Michell. Later that month she won her sixth U.S. National Championships singles title after a victory in the final against second-seeded foreign player Phoebe Holcroft Watson. She played no further tournaments that year and, despite only competing in three tournaments, was ranked No. 1 in the world by A. Wallis Myers for the third successive time, this time ahead of Holcroft Watson and Jacobs.

=== 1930: French and Wimbledon titles ===
After her marriage in December 1929 she played tournaments under her married name Helen Wills Moody. Her first tournament of the year was the Hotel Huntington Invitation in Pasadena in March where she defeated friend and frequent doubles partner Edith Cross in the final. In late April she traveled to Paris to compete in the French Championships. She won her third singles title in succession after defeating seventh-seeded Helen Jacobs in the final. Partnering Elizabeth Ryan the doubles title was added to her list of trophies after a win in the final against the French pairing Simone Barbier and Simonne Mathieu. The eighth edition of the Wightman Cup, held at the All England Club in June, was won by the British team despite two victories in the singles by Wills. At the Wimbledon Championships first-seeded Wills reached the final after wins against seventh-seeded Phyllis Mudford in the quarterfinal and fifth-seeded Simonne Mathieu in the semifinal. She defeated Elizabeth Ryan, seeded eighth, in straight sets to win her fourth consecutive Wimbledon singles title and with Ryan also won the doubles title against Edith Cross and Sarah Palfrey. Wills did not defend her title at the U.S. Championships as she wanted to spend more time at home with her husband. She did compete at the Pacific Coast Championships where she won her fourth singles title after a victory in the final against Anna McCune Harper. For the fourth successive year she was ranked No. 1 in the world by A. Wallis Myers but she was excluded from the national ranking by the USLTA.

=== 1931: Regained U.S. title ===
In 1931 Wills did not travel to Europe to defend her French and Wimbledon titles and only played in tournaments in the United States. Her first tournament was in July at the Essex Country Club Invitation in Massachusetts where she defeated McCune Harper in the final, losing just one game. In early August Wills won the Seabright Invitational title for the first time after a double-bagel victory in the final against Helen Jacobs. At the 1931 Wightman Cup in August in Forest Hills, she won both her singles matches but lost the doubles with McCune Harper. At the U.S. National Championships she won her seventh (and last) singles title via a win in a 35-minute final against the British player Eileen Bennett Whittingstall. In the fall she and her husband traveled to Japan, China and the Philippines and Wills played exhibition matches in Tokyo, Kobe and Yokohama. For the fifth time in succession she was ranked the No. 1 player in the world.

=== 1932: Back to Europe: French and Wimbledon titles ===

Due to the economic depression in the United States Wills and her husband decided to travel to several European countries. Wills departed New York in late April and said she wanted to compete in Europe every other year. She entered all three events of the French Championships, which was held from May 22 through June 6, without having played any warm-up tournaments. In the quarterfinal and semifinal of the singles event she survived setpoints but nevertheless won the title without losing a set when she beat Simonne Mathieu in the final. Her level of play was not quite as dominant as in previous years. She teamed up with Elizabeth Ryan to win the doubles title against Betty Nuthall and Eileen Bennett Whittingstall and in the mixed doubles she lost the final with Sidney Wood to Nuthall and Fred Perry. It was her last appearance at the French Championships. The day after the singles final she traveled to London to prepare for the Wightman Cup which was held on June 10 and 11 at the All England Club. The United States won the cup and Wills contributed with singles victories over Bennett Whittingstall and Dorothy Round but lost the doubles match with Sarah Palfrey.

At the Wimbledon Championships she encountered Helen Jacobs for the fourth time in a final of a Grand Slam tournament and as in previous occasions defeated her in straight sets to attain her fifth Wimbledon singles title. She played the mixed doubles event with compatriot Ellsworth Vines and were eliminated in the quarterfinal. In July she competed for the first time in the Dutch Championships in Noordwijk and won both the singles event, against Madzy Rollin Couquerque, as well as the doubles event with Elizbeth Ryan. Although Wills had indicated early in the year that she would defend her national U.S. title she announced in August that she would not do so and instead prolonged her stay in Europe. She then traveled on to Strasbourg, Germany where she won a tournament, beating Ilse Friedleben in the final. Afterwards she and her husband visited Switzerland, Sweden and Norway but she did not play in any further singles tournaments and for the sixth consecutive year was ranked the No. 1 player in the world.

=== 1933: Default in U.S. final ===
In an exhibition &quot;Battle of the Sexes&quot; match in San Francisco on January 28, 1933, Wills defeated Phil Neer, the eighth-ranked American male player 6–4 in a one-set match. She did not compete at the French Championships but traveled directly to England in May. She entered the Queen&#x27;s Club Championships in June and reached the final to play against Elsie Goldsack Pittman but rain prevented play and the title was shared. At the Wimbledon Championships which started a week after Queen&#x27;s she went through the draw with ease to reach the final against second-seeded Dorothy Round. Wills won the first set but lost the second by 6–8, the first set she had lost in competitive tennis since 1927, but won the final set to gain her sixth Wimbledon singles crown. After arriving back in New York on July 20 she felt pain and numbness in her right leg and following a consult at the New York Orthopedic Hospital decided to withdraw from the Wightman Cup in August. She was replaced by Sarah Palfrey.

Her streak of winning U.S. Championships seven times in seven attempts ended when she defaulted to Helen Jacobs during the 1933 final due to a back injury, trailing 0–3 with a double break in the third set. The loss ended her 45-match winning streak at the U.S. Championships. She was subsequently treated for a dislocated vertebrae.

=== 1934–35: Recovery and seventh Wimbledon title ===
In January 1934 she began receiving osteopathic treatments which made her feel better but she did not play any competitive tennis during the year. On the invitation of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; she traveled to London to write articles on the Wimbledon tournament. On advice of her father she took up swimming and in early 1935 started to hit against a backboard to aide her recovery. After taking more than a year off to recuperate Wills returned to tennis in June 1935 when she entered two English warm-up tournaments for Wimbledon. She won the St. George&#x27;s Hill Cub tournament against Elsie Pittmann but was defeated in straight sets in the semifinal of the Kent Championships by Kay Stammers. At Wimbledon she was seeded fourth behind Round, Sperling and Jacobs but won her seventh title, surviving a match point at 2–5 in the final set against third-seeded rival Jacobs.

=== 1936–38: Eighth Wimbledon title and retirement ===
Wills did not play any competitive singles tennis in 1936 and 1937 and traveled to England in late April 1938. In May she entered the North London Hard Court Tournament, her first singles competition in three years, and won the event by defeating Yvonne Law in the final. She also won the following Surrey Grass Court Championships against Margot Lumb in the final. Wills was persuaded by Hazel Wightman to participate in the Wightman Cup for the first time since 1932. On June 10 and 11 she won her singles matches against Margaret Scriven and Kay Stammers, contributing to the eighth consecutive cup win for the United States. At the Queen&#x27;s Club Championships she lost in the semifinal to Hilde Sperling. In 1938 she again defeated her rival Helen Jacobs in two sets to win her eighth and last Wimbledon title before retiring permanently from playing in singles. In the following years she did occasionally compete in doubles or mixed doubles events. In a 1994 interview with &quot;Inside Tennis&quot;, she revealed that a dog bite, which happened in January 1943, ended her career:

==Tennis legacy==
===Achievements===
From 1919 through 1938, she amassed a 398–35 (91.9%) win–loss match record, including a winning streak of at least 158 matches, during which she did not lose a set. She was the first American woman to win the French Championships and in 1928 became the first tennis player, male or female, to win three Grand Slam tournament or Majors in one calendar year. During the 17-year period from 1922 through 1938, Wills entered 24 Grand Slam singles events, winning 19, finishing runner-up three times, and defaulting twice as a result of her appendectomy. Wills won 31 Grand Slam tournament titles (singles, women&#x27;s doubles, and mixed doubles), including seven singles titles at the U.S. Championships, eight singles titles at Wimbledon, and four singles titles at the French Championships. Excluding her defaults at the French Championships and Wimbledon in 1926, she reached the final of every Grand Slam singles event she competed in. She never played at the Australian Championships.

Wills was a team member of the U.S. Wightman Cup in 1923, 1924, 1925, 1927, 1928, 1929, 1930, 1931, 1932, and 1938, winning the cup in 1923, 1927, 1929, 1931, 1932 and 1938. She compiled an overall Wightman Cup win–loss record of 20–9.

Jack Kramer, Harry Hopman, Mercer Beasley, Don Budge, and AP News called Wills the greatest female player in history.

===Rankings===
According to A. Wallis Myers of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, Wills was ranked in the world top ten from 1922 through 1925, 1927 through 1933, and in 1935 and 1938. She was world No. 1 in those rankings nine times, from 1927 through 1933 and in 1935 and 1938. Wills was included in the year-end top ten rankings issued by the United States Lawn Tennis Association from 1922 through 1925, 1927 through 1929, and in 1931 and 1933. She was the top-ranked U.S. player from 1923 through 1925 and 1927 through 1929. In 1950, sportswriter Grantland Rice ranked Helen Wills as the greatest female tennis player of all-time.

===Awards and honors===
In 1935, she was named Female Athlete of the Year by the Associated Press. Wills was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1959 together with the late Bill Tilden who had died in 1953. They were the 22nd and 23rd members of the Hall of Fame. In 1981, Wills was inducted into the (San Francisco) Bay Area Athletic Hall of Fame. In 1996 Wills was inducted into the Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame of the Intercollegiate Tennis Association.

In July 1926 and 1929, Wills appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. The New York Times obituary described her as &quot;arguably the most dominant tennis player of the 20th century&quot;.

Wills is name-checked in the Leonard Bernstein musical &quot;Wonderful Town&quot;, written in 1953 but set in 1935. In the song &quot;Conga&quot;, Ruth Sherwood sings &quot;What do you think of our rocks and reels?/ Mothersill&#x27;s/ seasick pills?/ How do you feel about Helen Wills?&quot;

==Playing style and personality==
When asked in 1941 about whether Wills or Lenglen was the better player, Elizabeth Ryan, who played against both of them in singles and partnered both in doubles, said, &quot;Suzanne, of course. She owned every kind of shot, plus a genius for knowing how and when to use them.&quot; However, Wills and Lenglen are seen as having different skills and strategies. Wills served and volleyed with unusually powerful forehand and backhand strokes, and she forced her opponents out of position by placing deep shots left and right. Lenglen was more physically nimble, and she was more imaginative—able to quickly change shots in response to conditions. Lenglen was a master of the drop shot and close net work, which was Wills&#x27; soft spot. Aware of her weakness at the net, Wills drove her opponents deep into the backcourt as much as possible. Playing Wills was, according to Helen Jacobs, like playing &quot;a machine... with implacable concentration and undeniable skill&quot; yet with little flexibility.

Analogizing Wills&#x27;s game to poker, George Lott, a 12-time winner of Grand Slam doubles titles and a contemporary of Wills, once said, &quot;Helen&#x27;s expression rarely varied and she always tended strictly to business, but her opponents were never in doubt as to what she held: an excellent service, a powerful forehand, a strong backhand, a killer instinct, and no weaknesses. Five of a kind! Who would want to draw against that kind of hand?&quot; Charlie Chaplin was once asked what he considered to be the most beautiful sight that he had ever seen. He responded that it was &quot;the movement of Helen Wills playing tennis&quot;.

Wills was reported to be introverted and detached. On court, she rarely showed emotion, ignored her opponents, and took no notice of the crowd. Kitty McKane Godfree, who in 1924 inflicted the only defeat Wills suffered at Wimbledon during her career, said, &quot;Helen was a very private person, and she didn&#x27;t really make friends very much.&quot; Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman said, &quot;Helen was really an unconfident and [socially] awkward girl—you have no idea how awkward... I thought of Helen as an honestly shy person who was bewildered by how difficult it was to please most people.&quot; Because of her unchanging stoic expression, Grantland Rice, the American sportswriter, bestowed on Wills the nickname &quot;Little Miss Poker Face&quot;. As her success and, ironically, unpopularity with the public increased, she was called &quot;Queen Helen&quot; and &quot;the Imperial Helen&quot;. Wills said in her autobiography, &quot;I had one thought and that was to put the ball across the net. I was simply myself, too deeply concentrated on the game for any extraneous thought.&quot;

===Attire and racket===
She typically wore a white sailor suit having a pleated knee-length skirt, white shoes, and a short sleeve top and a cerise-colored cardigan. The most iconic part of her attire was her signature white visor which she wore almost without exception since her junior playing days. In &quot;The Ladies Home Journal&quot; of April 1927 she commented on her choice: &quot;As to tennis headgear, I have a particular dislike, although an altogether unreasonable one, for the narrow satin ribbons that some players tie about their heads. The georgette crepe of Mademoiselle Lenglen&#x27;s famous bandeau is attractive as well as practical, but for myself I like an eye shade, because it protects the eyes, prevents wrinkles from forming about them, holds the hair in place and keeps away some of the sunburn.&quot;

In 1929 &quot;American Lawn Tennis&quot; magazine reported that Wills played with a Wright &amp; Ditson Challenge Cup wooden racket weighing 13 1/4 oz (372 g) with a 5-inch (127 mm) handle. In the spring of 1931 the same magazine reported that Wills used the identical make and model of racket but with a weight of 13 1/2 oz (376 g). and a handle of 5 1/8 inch (130 mm).

==Personal life==

Wills married Frederick S. Moody Jr., a San Francisco stockbroker, at the Berkeley chapel of St. Clement&#x27;s Episcopal Church, on December 23, 1929. They had met in February 1926 at the Riviera after the match against Lenglen, and announced their engagement in January 1929. In marriage, she wished to retain her professional name in arts as Helen Wills. The couple settled near the Claremont Hotel and the adjoining Berkeley Tennis Club where she worked out. They lived in a &quot;tiny apartment&quot;, according to Wills, so she kept a separate studio to practice painting and sketching. Moody was fond of squash rather than tennis, and Wills occasionally played against him for recreation. She divorced Moody in August 1937 and married Irish polo player Aidan Roark in October 1939. She did not have any children from either marriage.

Wills wrote a coaching manual, &quot;Tennis&quot; (1928), her autobiography, &quot;Fifteen-Thirty: The Story of a Tennis Player&quot; (1937), and a mystery, &quot;Death Serves an Ace&quot; (1939, with Robert Murphy). She also wrote articles for &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; and other magazines.

Senator James D. Phelan befriended Wills and invited her as a frequent guest to his estate, Villa Montalvo. Wills wrote poetry as a hobby, and presented two of her works, &quot;The Awakening&quot; and &quot;The Narrow Street&quot;, to a literary competition hosted by Phelan in 1926. Wills settled laurel wreaths over the heads of the winners. Phelan himself wrote a poem dedicated to Wills. Phelan commissioned Haig Patigian, sculptor and fellow member of the Bohemian Club, to create a likeness of Wills. Patigian completed a marble bust of Wills in 1927 called &quot;Helen of California&quot;, and Phelan donated it to the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum. At his death in 1930, Phelan left Wills $20,000 ($ today) in his will, &quot;in appreciation of her winning the tennis championship for California&quot;.

Wills met painter Frida Kahlo and her husband Diego Rivera at the San Francisco studio of her friend sculptor Ralph Stackpole in 1930. Rivera sketched Wills and asked her to model as the main figure of &quot;California&quot; for the 30-foot-high mural &quot;Allegory of California&quot; he was painting for the City Club of the San Francisco Stock Exchange. The committee of the Stock Exchange found out that Wills was being portrayed and insisted that no living person be represented in the mural. Subsequently, Rivera darkened the hair, broadened the eyes, changed the corners of the mouth and angled the jawline to remove any specific resemblance to Wills. A portrait of Stackpole&#x27;s son Peter Stackpole holding a model airplane remained unnoticed in the mural.

Wills painted all her life, giving exhibitions of her paintings and etchings in New York galleries. She personally drew all of the illustrations in her book &quot;Tennis&quot;. Her work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. On June 17, 1929 the first exhibition of her drawings was opened at the Cooling Gallery in London.

Wills remained an avid tennis player into her 80s.

Wills died on New Year&#x27;s Day 1998 at Carmel Convalescent Hospital. Her death was announced a day later. Wills bequeathed US$10 million to the University of California, Berkeley to fund the establishment of a Neuroscience institute. The resulting institute, the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, began in 1999 and is home to more than 70 faculty researchers and 36 graduate students.

<text>Ernst Heinrich Barlach (2 January 1870 – 24 October 1938) was a German expressionist sculptor, medallist, printmaker and writer. Although he was a supporter of the war in the years leading to World War I, his participation in the conflict made him change his position, and he is mostly known for his sculptures protesting against the war. This created many conflicts during the rise of the Nazi Party, when most of his works were confiscated as degenerate art. Stylistically, his literary and artistic work would fall between the categories of twentieth-century Realism and Expressionism.

==Biography==
===Youth===

Barlach was born in Wedel, Holstein, Kingdom of Prussia, the oldest of the four sons of Johanna Luise Barlach (née Vollert, 1845–1920) and the physician Dr. Georg Barlach (1839–1884). His early childhood was spent in Schönberg (Mecklenburg), where his father had practiced since 1872. In the fall of 1876, the family moved to Ratzeburg, where Barlach attended primary school. When his father died, early in 1884, the family returned to Schönberg, where Barlach attended secondary school. Barlach came from a Lutheran home.

===Study years===

Barlach studied from 1888 to 1891 at the Gewerbeschule Hamburg. Due to his artistic talent, he continued his studies at the &quot;Königliche Akademie der bildenden Künste zu Dresden&quot; (Royal Art School Dresden) as a student of Robert Diez between 1891 and 1895. He created his first major sculpture during this time, &quot;Die Krautpflückerin&quot; (The Herb Plucker). He continued his studies for one more year in Paris at the Académie Julian, from 1895 to 1897, but remained critical of the German tendency to copy the style of French artists. Nevertheless, he returned to Paris again for a few months in 1897 to undertake further studies.

===Seeking===

After his studies, Barlach worked for some time as a sculptor in Hamburg and Altona, working mainly in an Art Nouveau style. He produced illustrations for the Art Nouveau magazine &quot;Jugend&quot; 1897–1902, and made sculpture in a style close to Art Nouveau, including some ceramic statues. Afterwards, he also worked as a teacher at a school for ceramics. His first solo exhibition took place at the Kunstsalon Richard Mutz, Berlin, in 1904.

===Formative years===

However, the lack of commercial success of his works depressed Barlach. To lighten up, he decided to travel for eight weeks together with his brother Nikolaus and to visit his brother Hans in Russia. This trip to Russia in 1906 was one of the greatest influences on him and his artistic style. Also during his travels in Russia his son Nikolaus was born on 20 August 1906, starting a two-year fight with the mother, Rosa Schwab, for the custody of the child, which Barlach was finally granted.

After returning from Russia, Barlach&#x27;s financial situation improved considerably, as he received a fixed salary from the art dealer Paul Cassirer in exchange for his sculptures. The formative experiences in Russia and the financial security helped him to develop his own style, focusing on the faces and hands of the people in his sculptures and reducing the other parts of the figures to a minimum. He also began to make wood carvings and bronzes of figures swathed in heavy drapery like those in early Gothic art, and in dramatic attitudes expressive of powerful emotions and a yearning for spiritual ecstasy. He also worked for the German journal &quot;Simplicissimus&quot;, and started to produce some literature. His works were shown on various exhibitions. He also spent ten months in Florence, Italy in 1909 and afterwards settled in 1910 in Güstrow in Mecklenburg, where he spent the rest of his life.

In the years before World War I, Barlach was a patriotic and enthusiastic supporter of the war, awaiting a new artistic age from the war. This support for the war can also be seen in his works, as for example the statue &quot;Der Rächer&quot; (The Avenger), from December 1914. His awaited &quot;new artistic age&quot; came for him when he volunteered to join the war between 1915 and 1916 as an infantry soldier. After three months of service he was discharged due to a heart ailment, returning as a pacifist and a staunch opponent of war. The horror of the war influenced all of his subsequent works.

===Popularity===
Barlach&#x27;s fame increased after the war, and he received many awards and became a member in the prestigious &quot;Preußische Akademie der Künste&quot; (Prussian Art Academy) in 1919 and the &quot;Akademie der Bildenden Künste München&quot; (Munich Art Academy) in 1925. Barlach rejected a number of honorary degrees and teaching positions. In 1925 he also met Bernhard and Marga Böhmer for the first time. He received the Kleist Prize for drama in 1924 for his &quot;Die Sündflut&quot; (&quot;The Flood&quot;), in which he projects his personal mysticism onto the story of Noah and the Ark. In 1926 he wrote &quot;Der blaue Boll&quot; (translated as &quot;Squire Blue Boll&quot; or &quot;Boozer Boll&quot;), an expressionist drama in which the eponymous squire almost succeeds in seducing a down-and-out young mother, before both achieve spiritual regeneration.

===Interwar and World War II eras===
From 1928 onward Barlach also generated many anti-war sculptures based on his experiences in the war. This pacifist position went against the political trend during the rise of Nazism, and he was the target of much criticism. For example, the &quot;Magdeburger Ehrenmal&quot; (Magdeburg cenotaph) was ordered by the city of Magdeburg to be a memorial of World War I, and it was expected to show heroic German soldiers fighting for their glorious country. Barlach, however, created a sculpture with three German soldiers, a fresh recruit, a young officer and an old reservist, standing in a cemetery, all bearing marks of the horror, pain and desperation of the war, flanked by a mourning war widow covering her face in despair, a skeleton wearing a German army helmet, and a civilian (the face is that of Barlach himself) with his eyes closed and blocking his ears in terror. This naturally created a controversy with the pro-war population (several nationalists and Nazis claimed that the soldiers must be foreign since true Germans would be more heroic), and the sculpture was removed. Friends of Barlach were able to hide the sculpture until after the war, when it was returned to the Magdeburg Cathedral. Yet the attacks on Barlach continued until his death.

&quot;The Fighter of the Spirit&quot; (Der Geistkämpfer), commissioned by the University Church of Kiel in northern Germany, was intended to be a memorial to humanistic and intellectual ideals in the aftermath of World War I (1914–18). The Nazis, angered by its anti-war message, removed it in 1937 and sawed the angel in parts—intending to melt it down. Instead, it was saved. In 1953, following World War II, it was repaired and installed outside the Church of St. Nicholas in Kiel (the University Church was destroyed during the war), but not before copies were made. The Minneapolis Institute of Art acquired one in 1959 and today it stands at the 24th Street entrance to the museum, the saw marks still visible.

In 1931 Barlach started to live with Marga Böhmer, whereas her ex-husband and Barlach&#x27;s friend Bernhard Böhmer lived with his new wife Hella.

In 1936, Barlach&#x27;s works were confiscated during an exhibition together with the works of Käthe Kollwitz and Wilhelm Lehmbruck, and the majority of his remaining works were confiscated as &quot;degenerate art&quot;, for example the &quot;Güstrower Ehrenmal&quot; (Güstrow cenotaph) and the &quot;Hamburger Ehrenmal&quot; (Hamburg cenotaph). Barlach himself was prohibited from working as a sculptor, and his membership in the art academies was canceled. This rejection is reflected in his final works before his death from heart failure on 24 October 1938 in Rostock, Mecklenburg.

As a result of Nazi propaganda, Barlach was shunned by his fellow townspeople and was &quot;condemned&quot; (falsely) as a Jew and as a Bolshevik. He died in Rostock in 1938, and is buried in the cemetery of Ratzeburg.

In addition to his sculpture, Barlach also wrote eight Expressionist dramas, two novels and an autobiography &quot;Ein selbsterzähltes Leben&quot; 1928, and had a distinguished oeuvre of woodcuts and lithographs from about 1910 onwards, including illustrations for his own plays.

<doc id="788090" wikidata="Q880078" url="?curid=788090" title="Thomas B. Stanley">
<text>Thomas Bahnson Stanley (July 16, 1890 – July 10, 1970) was an American politician, furniture manufacturer and Holstein cattle breeder. A Democrat and member of the Byrd Organization, Stanley served in a number of different political offices in Virginia, including as the 47th speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates and as the Commonwealth&#x27;s 57th governor. He became known for his support of the Massive Resistance strategy to prevent school desegregation mandated by the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s decisions in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, and Virginia&#x27;s attempt to circumvent those decisions (ultimately overturned by both the Virginia Supreme Court and by federal courts) was known as the Stanley Plan.

==Early life==

He was born to Crockett Stanley (January 8, 1838 – March 12, 1915) and Susan Matilda Walker (August 17, 1845 – April 9, 1922) on a farm near Spencer, Henry County, Virginia, the youngest of seven children. He married Anne Pocahontas Bassett (November 28, 1898 – October 20, 1979) on October 24, 1918, in Bassett, Virginia. Anne was the daughter of John David Bassett (July 14, 1866 – February 26, 1965), a founder of Bassett Furniture, and Nancy Pocahontas Hundley (November 21, 1862 – January 11, 1953). Stanley graduated from Eastman Business College in Poughkeepsie, New York, in 1912.

==Business==

Stanley worked for his father-in-law&#x27;s company, Bassett Furniture, as an executive until 1924, when he left and founded Stanley Furniture, a leading Virginia furniture maker, in what would become Stanleytown, Virginia. His sons Thomas Bahnson Stanley, Jr. and John David Stanley joined him at Stanley Furniture.

==Politics==

As the Great Depression began, Henry County voters elected Stanley to represent them (part time) in the Virginia House of Delegates. Re-elected multiple times, he served from 1930 to 1946, and fellow delegates elected him their speaker from 1942 to 1946. After the end of World War II, voters elected Stanley to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he represented Virginia&#x27;s 5th district from November 5, 1946, until February 3, 1953, when Stanley resigned on to run for Virginia&#x27;s governor. Fellow Byrd Organization loyalist and former Virginia Governor William M. Tuck succeeded to the seat.

The Byrd Organization selected Stanley to be the Democratic candidate for governor of Virginia in 1953, and he won the Democratic primary. In the general election, Stanley handily defeated Republican Theodore Roosevelt Dalton and Independent Howard Carwile. He served as the governor of Virginia from 1954 to 1958. As governor, Stanley improved the administration of state hospitals and increased funding to mental hospitals and public schools.

While governor, Stanley became embroiled in conflict. The budget fight between the Old Guard of the Byrd Organization and the Young Turks (many returning military veterans) over budget surpluses and historic underfunding of education (especially egregious with respect to non-white Virginians) in the 1954 legislative session affected relations in the state&#x27;s Democratic Party for a generation. Stanley supported segregation, and the United States Supreme Court declared such illegal twice in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (which included a companion case from Prince Edward County, Virginia). After the 1954 Brown decision, Governor Stanley appointed a committee of mainly politicians from Southside Virginia (historically over-represented in the Virginia General Assembly and which depended politically on various methods of disenfranchising non-white Virginians) to study ways to preserve segregation through legislative means, including a school voucher program. Meanwhile, U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd declared the strategy known as Massive Resistance, while &quot;Richmond News Leader&quot; publisher James J. Kilpatrick advocated a more drastic policy, which passed a special legislative session in 1956 and became known as the Stanley Plan. Most parts were declared illegal by Virginia and federal courts within three years, long after Governor Stanley&#x27;s term had ended. In fact, although Governor Stanley had vowed to close schools to prevent their desegregation, that aspect of the plan was first tested under the next governor, J. Lindsay Almond after a federal panel ordered desegregation of Charlottesville schools in 1958.

===Electoral history===
*1946; Stanley was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and concurrently won a general election to the seat with 75.4% and 73.52% respectively in both races, defeating Republican William Creasy in both races.
*1948; Stanley was re-elected with 99.53% of the vote, defeating Independent Gene Graybeal.
*1950; Stanley was re-elected unopposed.
*1952; Stanley was re-elected unopposed.
*1953; Stanley was elected Governor of Virginia with 54.76% of the vote, defeating Republican Theodore R. Dalton and Independent Howard Hearness Carwile.

==Later years==
After his gubernatorial term ended, Stanley resumed his oversight of the furniture business, as well as became vice president and director of the First National Bank, and chairman of the Commission on State and Local Revenues and Expenditures. However, the Byrd Organization imploded in the 1960s, after U.S. Supreme Court decisions upholding the one-man, one-vote principle, including &quot;Davis v. Mann&quot;.

==Death==

Stanley died in Martinsville, Virginia, on July 10, 1970, and is buried in Roselawn Burial Park. His home Stoneleigh was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

<text>Psychological trauma (also known as mental trauma, psychiatric trauma, emotional damage, or psychotrauma) is an emotional response caused by severe distressing events, such as bodily injury, sexual violence, or other threats to the life of the subject or their loved ones; indirect exposure, such as from watching television news, may be extremely distressing and can produce an involuntary and possibly overwhelming physiological stress response, but does not always produce trauma &quot;per se&quot;. Examples of distressing events include violence, rape, or a terrorist attack.

Short-term reactions such as psychological shock and psychological denial are typically followed. Long-term reactions and effects include flashbacks, panic attacks, insomnia, nightmare disorder, difficulties with interpersonal relationships, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and brief psychotic disorder. Physical symptoms including migraines, hyperventilation, hyperhidrosis, and nausea are often associated with or made worse by trauma.

People react to similar events differently. Most people who experience a potentially traumatic event do not become psychologically traumatized, though they may be distressed and experience suffering. Some will develop PTSD after exposure to a traumatic event, or series of events. This discrepancy in risk rate can be attributed to protective factors some individuals have, that enable them to cope with difficult events, including temperamental and environmental factors, such as resilience and willingness to seek help.

Psychotraumatology is the study of psychological trauma.

==Signs and symptoms==
People who experience trauma often have problems and difficulties afterwards. The severity of these symptoms depends on the person, the types of trauma involved, and the support and treatment they receive from others. The range of reactions to trauma can be wide and varied, and differ in severity from person to person.

After a traumatic experience, a person may re-experience the trauma mentally and physically. For example, the sound of a motorcycle engine may cause intrusive thoughts or a sense of re-experiencing a traumatic experience that involved a similar sound e.g. gunfire. Sometimes a benign stimulus (e.g. noise from a motorcycle) may get connected in the mind with the traumatic experience. This process is called traumatic coupling. In this process, the benign stimulus becomes a trauma reminder, also called a trauma trigger. These can produce uncomfortable and even painful feelings. Re-experiencing can damage people&#x27;s sense of safety, self, self-efficacy, as well as their ability to regulate emotions and navigate relationships. They may turn to psychoactive drugs, including alcohol, to try to escape or dampen the feelings. These triggers cause flashbacks, which are dissociative experiences where the person feels as though the events are recurring. Flashbacks can range from distraction to complete dissociation or loss of awareness of the current context. Re-experiencing of symptoms is a sign that the body and mind are actively struggling to cope with the traumatic experience.

Triggers and cues act as reminders of the trauma and can cause anxiety and other associated emotions. Often the person can be completely unaware of what these triggers are. In many cases, this may lead a person with a traumatic disorder to engage in disruptive behaviors or self-destructive coping mechanisms, often without being fully aware of the nature or causes of their own actions. Panic attacks are an example of a psychosomatic response to such emotional triggers.

Consequently, intense feelings of anger may frequently surface, sometimes in inappropriate or unexpected situations, as danger may always seem to be present due to re-experiencing past events. Upsetting memories such as images, thoughts, or flashbacks may haunt the person, and nightmares may be frequent. Insomnia may occur as lurking fears and insecurity keep the person vigilant and on the lookout for danger, both day and night. A messy personal financial scene, as well as debt, are common features in trauma-affected people. Trauma does not only cause changes in one&#x27;s daily functions, but could also lead to morphological changes. Such epigenetic changes can be passed on to the next generation, thus making genetics one of the components of psychological trauma. However, some people are born with or later develop protective factors such as genetics that help lower their risk of psychological trauma.

Traumatic events are sometimes constantly experienced as if they were happening in the present, preventing the subject from gaining perspective on the experience. This can produce a pattern of prolonged periods of acute arousal punctuated by periods of physical and mental exhaustion. In time, emotional exhaustion may set in, leading to distraction, and clear thinking may be difficult or impossible. Emotional detachment, as well as dissociation (depersonalization or derealization) can frequently occur. Dissociating from the painful emotion includes numbing all emotion, and the person may seem emotionally flat, preoccupied, distant, or cold. Exposure to and re-experiencing trauma can cause neurophysiological changes like slowed myelination, abnormalities in synaptic pruning, shrinking of the hippocampus, cognitive and affective impairment. This is significant in brain scan studies done regarding higher-order function assessment with children and youth who were in vulnerable environments.

Some traumatized people may feel permanently damaged when trauma symptoms do not go away and they do not believe their situation will improve. This can lead to feelings of despair, transient paranoid ideation, loss of self-esteem, profound emptiness, suicidality, and frequently, depression. If important aspects of the person&#x27;s self and world understanding have been violated, the person may call their own identity into question. Often despite their best efforts, traumatized parents may have difficulty assisting their child with emotion regulation, attribution of meaning, and containment of post-traumatic fear in the wake of the child&#x27;s traumatization, leading to adverse consequences for the child. In such instances, seeking counselling in appropriate mental health services is in the best interests of both the child and the parent(s).

Trauma is hard to speak of by those that experience it. The event in question might recur to them in a dream or another medium, but it is rare for them to speak of it.

==Causes==

===Situational trauma===
Trauma can be caused by human-made, technological and natural disasters, including war, abuse, violence, vehicle collisions, or medical emergencies.

An individual&#x27;s response to psychological trauma can be varied based on the type of trauma, as well as socio-demographic and background factors.

There are several behavioral responses commonly used towards stressors including the proactive, reactive, and passive responses. Proactive responses include attempts to address and correct a stressor before it has a noticeable effect on lifestyle. Reactive responses occur after the stress and possible trauma has occurred and is aimed more at correcting or minimizing the damage of a stressful event. A passive response is often characterized by an emotional numbness or ignorance of a stressor.

There is also a distinction between trauma induced by recent situations and long-term trauma which may have been buried in the unconscious from past situations such as child abuse. Trauma is sometimes overcome through healing; in some cases this can be achieved by recreating or revisiting the origin of the trauma under more psychologically safe circumstances, such as with a therapist. More recently, awareness of the consequences of climate change is seen as a source of trauma as individuals contemplate future events as well as experience climate change related disasters. Emotional experiences within these contexts are increasing, and collective processing and engagement with these emotions can lead to increased resilience and post-traumatic growth, as well as a greater sense of belongingness. These outcomes are protective against the devastating impacts of psychological trauma.

===Stress disorders===
All psychological traumas originate from stress, a physiological response to an unpleasant stimulus. Long-term stress increases the risk of poor mental health and mental disorders, which can be attributed to secretion of glucocorticoids for a long period of time. Such prolonged exposure causes many physiological dysfunctions such as the suppression of the immune system and increase in blood pressure. Not only does it affect the body physiologically, but a morphological change in the hippocampus also takes place. Studies showed that extreme stress early in life can disrupt normal development of hippocampus and impact its functions in adulthood. Studies surely show a correlation between the size of hippocampus and one&#x27;s susceptibility to stress disorders. In times of war, psychological trauma has been known as shell shock or combat stress reaction. Psychological trauma may cause an acute stress reaction which may lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD emerged as the label for this condition after the Vietnam War in which many veterans returned to their respective countries demoralized, and sometimes, addicted to psychoactive substances.

The symptoms of PTSD must persist for at least one month for diagnosis to be made. The main symptoms of PTSD consist of four main categories: trauma (i.e. intense fear), reliving (i.e. flashbacks), avoidance behavior (i.e. emotional numbing), and hypervigilance (i.e. continuous scanning of the environment for danger). Research shows that about 60% of the US population reported as having experienced at least one traumatic symptom in their lives, but only a small proportion actually develops PTSD. There is a correlation between the risk of PTSD and whether or not the act was inflicted deliberately by the offender. Psychological trauma is treated with therapy and, if indicated, psychotropic medications.

The term &quot;continuous posttraumatic stress disorder&quot; (CTSD) was introduced into the trauma literature by Gill Straker (1987). It was originally used by South African clinicians to describe the effects of exposure to frequent, high levels of violence usually associated with civil conflict and political repression. The term is also applicable to the effects of exposure to contexts in which gang violence and crime are endemic as well as to the effects of ongoing exposure to life threats in high-risk occupations such as police, fire, and emergency services.

As one of the processes of treatment, confrontation with their sources of trauma plays a crucial role. While debriefing people immediately after a critical incident has not been shown to reduce incidence of PTSD, coming alongside people experiencing trauma in a supportive way has become standard practice.

The impact of PTSD on children is to a degree unknown, but education on coping mechanisms have shown to improve the lives of children who have undergone a traumatic event.

=== Moral injury ===
Moral injury is distress such as guilt or shame following a moral transgression. There are many other definitions, some based on different models of causality. Moral injury is associated with post-traumatic stress disorder but is distinguished from it. Moral injury is associated with guilt and shame while PTSD is correlated with fear and anxiety.

===Vicarious trauma===
Normally, hearing about or seeing a recording of an event, even if distressing, does not cause trauma; however, an exception is made to the diagnostic criteria for work-related exposures. Vicarious trauma affects workers who witness their clients&#x27; trauma. It is more likely to occur in situations where trauma-related work is the norm rather than the exception. Listening with empathy to the clients generates feeling, and seeing oneself in clients&#x27; trauma may compound the risk for developing trauma symptoms. Trauma may also result if workers witness situations that happen in the course of their work (e.g. violence in the workplace, reviewing violent video tapes.) Risk increases with exposure and with the absence of help-seeking protective factors and pre-preparation of preventive strategies. Individuals who have a personal history of trauma are also at increased risk for developing vicarious trauma. Vicarious trauma can lead workers to develop more negative views of themselves, others, and the world as a whole, which can compromise their quality of life and ability to work effectively.

== Theoretical models ==

=== Shattered assumptions theory ===

Janoff-Bulman, theorises that people generally hold three fundamental assumptions about the world that are built and confirmed over years of experience: the world is benevolent, the world is meaningful, and I am worthy. According to the shattered assumption theory, there are some extreme events that &quot;shatter&quot; an individual&#x27;s worldviews by severely challenging and breaking assumptions about the world and ourself. Once one has experienced such trauma, it is necessary for an individual to create new assumptions or modify their old ones to recover from the traumatic experience. Therefore, the negative effects of the trauma are simply related to our worldviews, and if we repair these views, we will recover from the trauma.

===In psychodynamics===
Psychodynamic viewpoints are controversial, but have been shown to have utility therapeutically.

French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot argued in the 1890s that psychological trauma was the origin of all instances of the mental illness known as hysteria. Charcot&#x27;s &quot;traumatic hysteria&quot; often manifested as paralysis that followed a physical trauma, typically years later after what Charcot described as a period of &quot;incubation&quot;. Sigmund Freud, Charcot&#x27;s student and the father of psychoanalysis, examined the concept of psychological trauma throughout his career. Jean Laplanche has given a general description of Freud&#x27;s understanding of trauma, which varied significantly over the course of Freud&#x27;s career: &quot;An event in the subject&#x27;s life, defined by its intensity, by the subject&#x27;s incapacity to respond adequately to it and by the upheaval and long-lasting effects that it brings about in the psychical organization&quot;.

The French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan claimed that what he called &quot;The Real&quot; had a traumatic quality external to symbolization. As an object of anxiety, Lacan maintained that The Real is &quot;the essential object which isn&#x27;t an object any longer, but this something faced with which all words cease and all categories fail, the object of anxiety &quot;par excellence&quot;&quot;.

Fred Alford, citing the work of object relations theorist Donald Winnicott, uses the concept of inner other, and internal representation of the social world, with which one converses internally and which is generated through interactions with others. He posits that the inner other is damaged by trauma but can be repaired by conversations with others such as therapists. He relates the concept of the inner other to the work of Albert Camus viewing the inner other as that which removes the absurd. Alford notes how trauma damages trust in social relations due to fear of exploitation and argues that culture and social relations can help people recover from trauma.

Diana Fosha, a pioneer of modern psychodynamic perspective, also argues that social relations can help people recover from trauma, but specifically refers to attachment theory and the attachment dynamic of the therapeutic relationship. Fosha argues that the sense of emotional safety and co-regulation that occurs in a psychodynamically oriented therapeutic relationship acts as the secure attachment that is necessary to allow a client to experience and process through their trauma safely and effectively.

==Diagnosis==
As &quot;trauma&quot; adopted a more widely defined scope, traumatology as a field developed a more interdisciplinary approach. This is in part due to the field&#x27;s diverse professional representation including: psychologists, medical professionals, and lawyers. As a result, findings in this field are adapted for various applications, from individual psychiatric treatments to sociological large-scale trauma management. While the field has adopted a number of diverse methodological approaches, many pose their own limitations in practical application.

The experience and outcomes of psychological trauma can be assessed in a number of ways. Within the context of a clinical interview, the risk of imminent danger to the self or others is important to address but is not the focus of assessment. In most cases, it will not be necessary to involve contacting emergency services (e.g., medical, psychiatric, law enforcement) to ensure the individuals safety; members of the individual&#x27;s social support network are much more critical.

Understanding and accepting the psychological state of an individual is paramount. There are many misconceptions of what it means for a traumatized individual to be in psychological crisis. These are times when an individual is in inordinate amounts of pain and incapable of self-comfort. If treated humanely and respectfully, the individual is less likely to resort to self harm. In these situations it is best to provide a supportive, caring environment and to communicate to the individual that no matter the circumstance, the individual will be taken seriously rather than being treated as delusional. It is vital for the assessor to understand that what is going on in the traumatized person&#x27;s head is valid and real. If deemed appropriate, the assessing clinician may proceed by inquiring about both the traumatic event and the outcomes experienced (e.g., post-traumatic symptoms, dissociation, substance abuse, somatic symptoms, psychotic reactions). Such inquiry occurs within the context of established rapport and is completed in an empathic, sensitive, and supportive manner. The clinician may also inquire about possible relational disturbance, such as alertness to interpersonal danger, abandonment issues, and the need for self-protection via interpersonal control. Through discussion of interpersonal relationships, the clinician is better able to assess the individual&#x27;s ability to enter and sustain a clinical relationship.

During assessment, individuals may exhibit activation responses in which reminders of the traumatic event trigger sudden feelings (e.g., distress, anxiety, anger), memories, or thoughts relating to the event. Because individuals may not yet be capable of managing this distress, it is necessary to determine how the event can be discussed in such a way that will not &quot;retraumatize&quot; the individual. It is also important to take note of such responses, as these responses may aid the clinician in determining the intensity and severity of possible post traumatic stress as well as the ease with which responses are triggered. Further, it is important to note the presence of possible avoidance responses. Avoidance responses may involve the absence of expected activation or emotional reactivity as well as the use of avoidance mechanisms (e.g., substance use, effortful avoidance of cues associated with the event, dissociation).

In addition to monitoring activation and avoidance responses, clinicians carefully observe the individual&#x27;s strengths or difficulties with affect regulation (i.e., affect tolerance and affect modulation). Such difficulties may be evidenced by mood swings, brief yet intense depressive episodes, or self-mutilation. The information gathered through observation of affect regulation will guide the clinician&#x27;s decisions regarding the individual&#x27;s readiness to partake in various therapeutic activities.

Though assessment of psychological trauma may be conducted in an unstructured manner, assessment may also involve the use of a structured interview. Such interviews might include the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, Acute Stress Disorder Interview, Structured Interview for Disorders of Extreme Stress, Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders - Revised, and Brief Interview for post-traumatic Disorders.

Lastly, assessment of psychological trauma might include the use of self-administered psychological tests. Individual scores on such tests are compared to normative data in order to determine how the individual&#x27;s level of functioning compares to others in a sample representative of the general population. Psychological testing might include the use of generic tests (e.g., MMPI-2, MCMI-III, SCL-90-R) to assess non-trauma-specific symptoms as well as difficulties related to personality. In addition, psychological testing might include the use of trauma-specific tests to assess post-traumatic outcomes. Such tests might include the post-traumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale, Davidson Trauma Scale, Detailed Assessment of post-traumatic Stress, Trauma Symptom Inventory, Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children, Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire, and Trauma-related Guilt Inventory.

Children are assessed through activities and therapeutic relationship, some of the activities are play genogram, sand worlds, coloring feelings, self and kinetic family drawing, symbol work, dramatic-puppet play, story telling, Briere&#x27;s TSCC, etc.

===Definition===
The &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition&quot; (DSM-5) defines trauma as the symptoms that occur following exposure to an event (i.e., traumatic event) that involves actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence. This exposure could come in the form of experiencing the event or witnessing the event, or learning that an extreme violent or accidental event was experienced by a loved one. Trauma symptoms may come in the form of intrusive memories, dreams, or flashbacks; avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event; negative thoughts and feelings; or increased alertness or reactivity. Memories associated with trauma are typically explicit, coherent, and difficult to forget. Due to the complexity of the interaction between traumatic event occurrence and trauma symptomatology, a person&#x27;s distress response to aversive details of a traumatic event may involve intense fear or helplessness, but ranges according to the context. In children, trauma symptoms can be manifested in the form of disorganized or agitative behaviors.

Trauma can be caused by a wide variety of events, but there are a few common aspects. There is frequently a violation of the person&#x27;s core assumptions about the world and their human rights, putting the person in a state of extreme confusion and insecurity. This is seen when institutions depended upon for survival violate, humiliate, betray, or cause major losses or separations instead of evoking aspects like positive self worth, safe boundaries and personal freedom.

Psychologically traumatic experiences often involve physical trauma that threatens one&#x27;s survival and sense of security. Typical causes and dangers of psychological trauma include harassment; embarrassment; abandonment; abusive relationships; rejection; co-dependence; physical assault; sexual abuse; partner battery; employment discrimination; police brutality; judicial corruption and misconduct; bullying; paternalism; domestic violence; indoctrination; being the victim of an alcoholic parent; the threat or the witnessing of violence (particularly in childhood); life-threatening medical conditions; and medication-induced trauma. Catastrophic natural disasters such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions; large scale transportation accidents; house or domestic fire; motor collision; mass interpersonal violence like war; terrorist attacks or other mass victimization like sex trafficking; being taken as a hostage or being kidnapped can also cause psychological trauma. Long-term exposure to situations such as extreme poverty or other forms of abuse, such as verbal abuse, exist independently of physical trauma but still generate psychological trauma.

Some theories suggest childhood trauma can increase one&#x27;s risk for mental disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and substance abuse. Childhood adversity is associated with neuroticism during adulthood.
Parts of the brain in a growing child are developing in a sequential and hierarchical order, from least complex to most complex. The brain&#x27;s neurons change in response to the constant external signals and stimulation, receiving and storing new information. This allows the brain to continually respond to its surroundings and promote survival. The five traditional signals (sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch) contribute to the developing brain structure and its function.
Infants and children begin to create internal representations of their external environment, and in particular, key attachment relationships, shortly after birth. Violent and victimizing attachment figures impact infants&#x27; and young children&#x27;s internal representations. The more frequently a specific pattern of brain neurons is activated, the more permanent the internal representation associated with the pattern becomes. This causes sensitization in the brain towards the specific neural network. Because of this sensitization, the neural pattern can be activated by decreasingly less external stimuli.
Child abuse tends to have the most complications, with long-term effects out of all forms of trauma, because it occurs during the most sensitive and critical stages of psychological development. It could lead to violent behavior, possibly as extreme as serial murder. For example, Hickey&#x27;s Trauma-Control Model suggests that &quot;childhood trauma for serial murderers may serve as a triggering mechanism resulting in an individual&#x27;s inability to cope with the stress of certain events.&quot;

Often, psychological aspects of trauma are overlooked even by health professionals: &quot;If clinicians fail to look through a trauma lens and to conceptualize client problems as related possibly to current or past trauma, they may fail to see that trauma victims, young and old, organize much of their lives around repetitive patterns of reliving and warding off traumatic memories, reminders, and affects.&quot; Biopsychosocial models offer a broader view of health problems than biomedical models.

== Effects ==
Evidence suggests that a majority of people who experience severe trauma in adulthood will experience enduring personality change. Personality changes include guilt, distrust, impulsiveness, aggression, avoidance, obsessive behaviour, emotional numbness, loss of interest, hopelessness and altered self-perception.

==Treatment==

A number of psychotherapy approaches have been designed with the treatment of trauma in mind—EMDR, progressive counting, somatic experiencing, biofeedback, Internal Family Systems Therapy, and sensorimotor psychotherapy, and Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) etc. Trauma informed care provides a framework for any person in any discipline or context to promote healing, or at least not re-traumatizing. A 2018 systematic review provided moderate evidence that Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is effective in reducing PTSD and depression symptoms, and it increases the likelihood of patients no longer meeting the criteria for PTSD.

There is a large body of empirical support for the use of cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of trauma-related symptoms, including post-traumatic stress disorder. Institute of Medicine guidelines identify cognitive behavioral therapies as the most effective treatments for PTSD. Two of these cognitive behavioral therapies, prolonged exposure and cognitive processing therapy, are being disseminated nationally by the Department of Veterans Affairs for the treatment of PTSD. A 2010 Cochrane review found that trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy was effective for individuals with acute traumatic stress symptoms when compared to waiting list and supportive counseling. Seeking Safety is another type of cognitive behavioral therapy that focuses on learning safe coping skills for co-occurring PTSD and substance use problems. While some sources highlight Seeking Safety as effective with strong research support, others have suggested that it did not lead to improvements beyond usual treatment. A review from 2014 showed that a combination of treatments involving dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), often used for borderline personality disorder, and exposure therapy is highly effective in treating psychological trauma. If, however, psychological trauma has caused dissociative disorders or complex PTSD, ,Brief Psychotic disorder, the trauma model approach (also known as phase-oriented treatment of structural dissociation) has been proven to work better than the simple cognitive approach. Studies funded by pharmaceuticals have also shown that medications such as the new anti-depressants are effective when used in combination with other psychological approaches. At present, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants sertraline (Zoloft) and paroxetine (Paxil) are the only medications that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States to treat PTSD. Other options for pharmacotherapy include serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressants and anti-psychotic medications, though none have been FDA approved.

Trauma therapy allows processing trauma-related memories and allows growth towards more adaptive psychological functioning. It helps to develop positive coping instead of negative coping and allows the individual to integrate upsetting-distressing material (thoughts, feelings and memories) and to resolve these internally. It also aids in the growth of personal skills like resilience, ego regulation, empathy, etc.

Processes involved in trauma therapy are:
* Psychoeducation: Information dissemination and educating in vulnerabilities and adoptable coping mechanisms.
* Emotional regulation: Identifying, countering discriminating, grounding thoughts and emotions from internal construction to an external representation.
* Cognitive processing: Transforming negative perceptions and beliefs about self, others and environment to positive ones through cognitive reconsideration or re-framing.
* Trauma processing: Systematic desensitization, response activation and counter-conditioning, titrated extinction of emotional response, deconstructing disparity (emotional vs. reality state), resolution of traumatic material (in theory, to a state in which triggers no longer produce harmful distress and the individual is able to express relief.)
* Emotional processing: Reconstructing perceptions, beliefs and erroneous expectations, habituating new life contexts for auto-activated trauma-related fears, and providing crisis cards with coded emotions and appropriate cognition. (This stage is only initiated in pre-termination phase from clinical assessment and judgement of the mental health professional.)
* Experiential processing: Visualization of achieved relief state and relaxation methods.

A number of complementary approaches to trauma treatment have been implicated as well, including yoga and meditation. There has been recent interest in developing trauma-sensitive yoga practices, but the actual efficacy of yoga in reducing the effects of trauma needs more exploration.

In health and social care settings, a trauma informed approach means that care is underpinned by understandings of trauma and its far-reaching implications. Trauma is widespread. For example, 26% of participants in the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) study were survivors of one ACE and 12.5% were survivors of four or more ACEs. A trauma-informed approach acknowledges the high rates of trauma and means that care providers treat every person as if they might be a survivor of trauma. Measurement of the effectiveness of a universal trauma informed approach is in early stages and is largely based in theory and epidemiology.

Trauma informed teaching practice is an educative approach for migrant children from war-torn countries, who have typically experienced complex trauma, and the number of such children entering Canadian schools has led some school jurisdictions to consider new classroom approaches to assist these pupils. Along with complex trauma, these students often have experienced interrupted schooling due to the migration process, and as a consequence may have limited literacy skills in their first language. One study of a Canadian secondary school classroom, as told through journal entries of a student teacher, showed how Blaustein and Kinniburgh&#x27;s ARC (attachment, regulation and competency) framework was used to support newly arrived refugee students from war zones. Tweedie et al. (2017) describe how key components of the ARC framework, such as establishing consistency in classroom routines; assisting students to identify and self-regulate emotional responses; and enabling student personal goal achievement, are practically applied in one classroom where students have experienced complex trauma. The authors encourage teachers and schools to avoid a deficit lens to view such pupils, and suggest ways schools can structure teaching and learning environments which take into account the extreme stresses these students have encountered.

== Society and culture ==
Some people, and many self-help books, use the word &quot;trauma&quot; broadly, to refer to any unpleasant experience, even if the affected person has a psychologically healthy response to the experience. This imprecise language may promote the medicalization of normal human behaviors (e.g., grief after a death) and make discussions of psychological trauma more complex, but it might also encourage people to respond with compassion to the distress and suffering of others.

<text>Major trauma is any injury that has the potential to cause prolonged disability or death. There are many causes of major trauma, blunt and penetrating, including falls, motor vehicle collisions, stabbing wounds, and gunshot wounds. Depending on the severity of injury, quickness of management, and transportation to an appropriate medical facility (called a trauma center) may be necessary to prevent loss of life or limb. The initial assessment is critical, and involves a physical evaluation and also may include the use of imaging tools to determine the types of injuries accurately and to formulate a course of treatment.

In 2002, unintentional and intentional injuries were the fifth and seventh leading causes of deaths worldwide, accounting for 6.23% and 2.84% of all deaths. For research purposes the definition often is based on an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of greater than 15.

==Classification==
Injuries generally are classified by either severity, the location of damage, or a combination of both. Trauma also may be classified by demographic group, such as age or gender. It also may be classified by the type of force applied to the body, such as blunt trauma or penetrating trauma. For research purposes injury may be classified using the Barell matrix, which is based on ICD-9-CM. The purpose of the matrix is for international standardization of the classification of trauma. Major trauma sometimes is classified by body area; injuries affecting 40% are polytrauma, 30% head injuries, 20% chest trauma, 10%, abdominal trauma, and 2%, extremity trauma.

Various scales exist to provide a quantifiable metric to measure the severity of injuries. The value may be used for triaging a patient or for statistical analysis. Injury scales measure damage to anatomical parts, physiological values (blood pressure etc.), comorbidities, or a combination of those. The Abbreviated Injury Scale and the Glasgow Coma Scale are used commonly to quantify injuries for the purpose of triaging and allow a system to monitor or &quot;trend&quot; a patient&#x27;s condition in a clinical setting. The data also may be used in epidemiological investigations and for research purposes.

Approximately 2% of those who have experienced significant trauma have a spinal cord injury.

==Causes==
Injuries may be caused by any combination of external forces that act physically against the body. The leading causes of traumatic death are blunt trauma, motor vehicle collisions, and falls, followed by penetrating trauma such as stab wounds or impaled objects. Subsets of blunt trauma are both the number one and two causes of traumatic death.

For statistical purposes, injuries are classified as either intentional such as suicide, or unintentional, such as a motor vehicle collision. Intentional injury is a common cause of traumas. Penetrating trauma is caused when a foreign body such as a bullet or a knife enters the body tissue, creating an open wound. In the United States, most deaths caused by penetrating trauma occur in urban areas and 80% of these deaths are caused by firearms. Blast injury is a complex cause of trauma because it commonly includes both blunt and penetrating trauma, and also may be accompanied by a burn injury. Trauma also may be associated with a particular activity, such as an occupational or sports injury.

==Pathophysiology==
The body responds to traumatic injury both systemically and at the injury site. This response attempts to protect vital organs such as the liver, to allow further cell duplication and to heal the damage. The healing time of an injury depends on various factors including sex, age, and the severity of injury.

The symptoms of injury may manifest in many different ways, including:
* Altered mental status
* Fever
* Increased heart rate
* Generalized edema
* Increased cardiac output
* Increased rate of metabolism

Various organ systems respond to injury to restore homeostasis by maintaining perfusion to the heart and brain. Inflammation after injury occurs to protect against further damage and starts the healing process. Prolonged inflammation may cause multiple organ dysfunction syndrome or systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Immediately after injury, the body increases production of glucose through gluconeogenesis and its consumption of fat via lipolysis. Next, the body tries to replenish its energy stores of glucose and protein via anabolism. In this state the body will temporarily increase its maximum expenditure for the purpose of healing injured cells.

==Diagnosis==
The initial assessment is critical in determining the extent of injuries and what will be needed to manage an injury, and for treating immediate life threats.

===Physical examination===
Primary physical examination is undertaken to identify any life-threatening problems, after which the secondary examination is carried out. This may occur during transportation or upon arrival at the hospital. The secondary examination consists of a systematic assessment of the abdominal, pelvic, and thoracic areas, a complete inspection of the body surface to find all injuries, and a neurological examination. Injuries that may manifest themselves later may be missed during the initial assessment, such as when a patient is brought into a hospital&#x27;s emergency department. Generally, the physical examination is performed in a systematic way that first checks for any immediate life threats (primary survey), and then taking a more in-depth examination (secondary survey).

===Imaging===

Persons with major trauma commonly have chest and pelvic x-rays taken, and, depending on the mechanism of injury and presentation, a focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) exam to check for internal bleeding. For those with relatively stable blood pressure, heart rate, and sufficient oxygenation, CT scans are useful. Full-body CT scans, known as pan-scans, improve the survival rate of those who have suffered major trauma. These scans use intravenous injections for the radiocontrast agent, but not oral administration. There are concerns that intravenous contrast administration in trauma situations without confirming adequate renal function may cause damage to kidneys, but this does not appear to be significant.

In the U.S., CT or MRI scans are performed on 15% of those with trauma in emergency departments. Where blood pressure is low or the heart rate is increasedlikely from bleeding in the abdomenimmediate surgery bypassing a CT scan is recommended. Modern 64-slice CT scans are able to rule out, with a high degree of accuracy, significant injuries to the neck following blunt trauma.

===Surgical techniques===
Surgical techniques, using a tube or catheter to drain fluid from the peritoneum, chest, or the pericardium around the heart, often are used in cases of severe blunt trauma to the chest or abdomen, especially when a person is experiencing early signs of shock. In those with low blood-pressure, likely because of bleeding in the abdominal cavity, cutting through the abdominal wall surgically is indicated.

==Prevention==
By identifying risk factors present within a community and creating solutions to decrease the incidence of injury, trauma referral systems may help to enhance the overall health of a population. Injury prevention strategies are commonly used to prevent injuries in children, who are a high risk population. Injury prevention strategies generally involve educating the general public about specific risk factors and developing strategies to avoid or reduce injuries. Legislation intended to prevent injury typically involves seatbelts, child car-seats, helmets, alcohol control, and increased enforcement of the legislation. Other controllable factors, such as the use of drugs including alcohol or cocaine, increases the risk of trauma by increasing the likelihood of traffic collisions, violence, and abuse occurring. Prescription drugs such as benzodiazepines may increase the risk of trauma in elderly people.

The care of acutely injured people in a public health system requires the involvement of bystanders, community members, health care professionals, and health care systems. It encompasses pre-hospital trauma assessment and care by emergency medical services personnel, emergency department assessment, treatment, stabilization, and in-hospital care among all age groups. An established trauma system network is also an important component of community disaster preparedness, facilitating the care of people who have been involved in disasters that cause large numbers of casualties, such as earthquakes.

==Management==

===Pre-hospital===
The pre-hospital use of stabilization techniques improves the chances of a person surviving the journey to the nearest trauma-equipped hospital. Emergency medicine services determines which people need treatment at a trauma center as well as provide primary stabilization by checking and treating airway, breathing, and circulation as well as assessing for disability and gaining exposure to check for other injuries.

Spinal motion restriction by securing the neck with a cervical collar and placing the person on a long spine board was of high importance in the pre-hospital setting, but due to lack of evidence to support its use, the practice is losing favor. Instead, it is recommended that more exclusive criteria be met such as age and neurological deficits to indicate the need of these adjuncts. This may be accomplished with other medical transport devices, such as a Kendrick extrication device, before moving the person. It is important to quickly control severe bleeding with direct pressure to the wound and consider the use of hemostatic agents or tourniquets if the bleeding continues. Conditions such as impending airway obstruction, enlargening neck hematoma, or unconsciousness require intubation. It is unclear, however, if this is best performed before reaching hospital or in the hospital.

Rapid transportation of severely injured patients improves the outcome in trauma. Helicopter EMS transport reduces mortality compared to ground-based transport in adult trauma patients. Before arrival at the hospital, the availability of advanced life support does not greatly improve the outcome for major trauma when compared to the administration of basic life support. Evidence is inconclusive in determining support for pre-hospital intravenous fluid resuscitation while some evidence has found it may be harmful. Hospitals with designated trauma centers have improved outcomes when compared to hospitals without them, and outcomes may improve when persons who have experienced trauma are transferred directly to a trauma center.

Improvements in pre-hospital care have led to &quot;unexpected survivors&quot;, where patients survive trauma when they would have previously been expected to die. However these patients may struggle to rehabilitate.

===In-hospital===
Management of those with trauma often requires the help of many healthcare specialists including physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, and social workers. Cooperation allows many actions to be completed at once. Generally, the first step of managing trauma is to perform a primary survey that evaluates a person&#x27;s airway, breathing, circulation, and neurologic status. These steps may happen simultaneously or depend on the most pressing concern such as a tension pneumothorax or major arterial bleed. The primary survey generally includes assessment of the cervical spine, though clearing it is often not possible until after imaging, or the person has improved. After immediate life threats are controlled, a person is either moved into an operating room for immediate surgical correction of the injuries, or a secondary survey is performed that is a more detailed head-to-toe assessment of the person.

Indications for intubation include airway obstruction, inability to protect the airway, and respiratory failure. Examples of these indications include penetrating neck trauma, expanding neck hematoma, and being unconscious. In general, the method of intubation used is rapid sequence intubation followed by ventilation, though intubating in shock due to bleeding can lead to arrest, and should be done after some resuscitation whenever possible. Trauma resuscitation includes control of active bleeding. When a person is first brought in, vital signs are checked, an ECG is performed, and, if needed, vascular access is obtained. Other tests should be performed to get a baseline measurement of their current blood chemistry, such as an arterial blood gas or thromboelastography. In those with cardiac arrest due to trauma chest compressions are considered futile, but still recommended. Correcting the underlying cause such as a pneumothorax or pericardial tamponade, if present, may help.

A FAST exam may help assess for internal bleeding. In certain traumas, such as maxillofacial trauma, it may be beneficial to have a highly trained health care provider available to maintain airway, breathing, and circulation.

===Intravenous fluids===
Traditionally, high-volume intravenous fluids were given to people who had poor perfusion due to trauma. This is still appropriate in cases with isolated extremity trauma, thermal trauma, or head injuries. In general, however, giving lots of fluids appears to increase the risk of death. Current evidence supports limiting the use of fluids for penetrating thorax and abdominal injuries, allowing mild hypotension to persist. Targets include a mean arterial pressure of 60 mmHg, a systolic blood pressure of 70–90 mmHg, or the re-establishment of peripheral pulses and adequate ability to think. Hypertonic saline has been studied and found to be of little difference from normal saline.

As no intravenous fluids used for initial resuscitation have been shown to be superior, warmed Lactated Ringer&#x27;s solution continues to be the solution of choice. If blood products are needed, a greater use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets instead of only packed red blood cells has been found to improve survival and lower overall blood product use; a ratio of 1:1:1 is recommended. The success of platelets has been attributed to the fact that they may prevent coagulopathy from developing. Cell salvage and autotransfusion also may be used.

Blood substitutes such as hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers are in development; however, as of 2013 there are none available for commercial use in North America or Europe. These products are only available for general use in South Africa and Russia.

===Medications===
Tranexamic acid decreases death in people who are having ongoing bleeding due to trauma, as well as those with mild to moderate traumatic brain injury and evidence of intracranial bleeding on CT scan. It only appears to be beneficial, however, if administered within the first three hours after trauma. For severe bleeding, for example from bleeding disorders, recombinant factor VIIaa protein that assists blood clottingmay be appropriate. While it decreases blood use, it does not appear to decrease the mortality rate. In those without previous factor VII deficiency, its use is not recommended outside of trial situations.

Other medications may be used in conjunction with other procedures to stabilize a person who has sustained a significant injury. While positive inotropic medications such as norepinephrine sometimes are used in hemorrhagic shock as a result of trauma, there is a lack of evidence for their use. Therefore, as of 2012 they have not been recommended. Allowing a low blood pressure may be preferred in some situations.

===Surgery===
The decision whether to perform surgery is determined by the extent of the damage and the anatomical location of the injury. Bleeding must be controlled before definitive repair may occur. Damage control surgery is used to manage severe trauma in which there is a cycle of metabolic acidosis, hypothermia, and hypotension that may lead to death, if not corrected. The main principle of the procedure involves performing the fewest procedures to save life and limb; less critical procedures are left until the victim is more stable. Approximately 15% of all people with trauma have abdominal injuries, and approximately 25% of these require exploratory surgery. The majority of preventable deaths from trauma result from unrecognised intra-abdominal bleeding.

==Prognosis==
Trauma deaths occur in immediate, early, or late stages. Immediate deaths usually are due to apnea, severe brain or high spinal cord injury, or rupture of the heart or of large blood vessels. Early deaths occur within minutes to hours and often are due to hemorrhages in the outer meningeal layer of the brain, torn arteries, blood around the lungs, air around the lungs, ruptured spleen, liver laceration, or pelvic fracture. Immediate access to care may be crucial to prevent death in persons experiencing major trauma. Late deaths occur days or weeks after the injury and often are related to infection. Prognosis is better in countries with a dedicated trauma system where injured persons are provided quick and effective access to proper treatment facilities.

Long-term prognosis frequently is complicated by pain; more than half of trauma patients have moderate to severe pain one year after injury. Many also experience a reduced quality of life years after an injury, with 20% of victims sustaining some form of disability.
Physical trauma may lead to development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). One study has found no correlation between the severity of trauma and the development of PTSD.

==Epidemiology==


Trauma is the sixth leading cause of death worldwide, resulting in five million or 10% of all deaths annually. It is the fifth leading cause of significant disability. About half of trauma deaths are in people aged between 15 and 45 years and trauma is the leading cause of death in this age group. Injury affects more males; 68% of injuries occur in males and death from trauma is twice as common in males as it is in females, this is believed to be because males are much more willing to engage in risk-taking activities. Teenagers and young adults are more likely to need hospitalization from injuries than other age groups. While elderly persons are less likely to be injured, they are more likely to die from injuries sustained due to various physiological differences that make it more difficult for the body to compensate for the injuries. The primary causes of traumatic death are central nervous system injuries and substantial blood loss. Various classification scales exist for use with trauma to determine the severity of injuries, which are used to determine the resources used and, for statistical collection.

==History==
The human remains discovered at the site of Nataruk in Turkana, Kenya, are claimed to show major trauma—both blunt and penetrating—caused by violent trauma to the head, neck, ribs, knees, and hands, which has been interpreted by some researchers as establishing the existence of warfare between two groups of hunter-gatherers 10,000 years ago. The evidence for blunt-force trauma at Nataruk has been challenged, however, and the interpretation that the site represents an early example of warfare has been questioned.

==Society and culture==

===Economics===
The financial cost of trauma includes both the amount of money spent on treatment and the loss of potential economic gain through absence from work. The average financial cost for the treatment of traumatic injury in the United States is approximately per person, making it costlier than the treatment of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. One reason for the high cost of the treatment for trauma is the increased possibility of complications, which leads to the need for more interventions. Maintaining a trauma center is costly because they are open continuously and maintain a state of readiness to receive patients, even if there are none. In addition to the direct costs of the treatment, there also is a burden on the economy due to lost wages and productivity, which in 2009, accounted for approximately in the United States.

===Low- and middle-income countries===

Citizens of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) often have higher mortality rates from injury. These countries accounted for 89% of all deaths from injury worldwide. Many of these countries do not have access to sufficient surgical care and many do not have a trauma system in place. In addition, most LMICs do not have a pre-hospital care system that treats injured persons initially and transports them to hospital quickly, resulting in most casualty patients being transported by private vehicles. Also, their hospitals lack the appropriate equipment, organizational resources, or trained staff. By 2020, the amount of trauma-related deaths is expected to decline in high-income countries, while in low- to middle-income countries it is expected to increase.

==Special populations==

===Children===
Due to anatomical and physiological differences, injuries in children need to be approached differently from those in adults. Accidents are the leading cause of death in children between 1 and 14 years old. In the United States, approximately sixteen million children go to an emergency department due to some form of injury every year, with boys being more frequently injured than girls by a ratio of 2:1. The world&#x27;s five most common unintentional injuries in children as of 2008 are road crashes, drowning, burns, falls, and poisoning.

Weight estimation is an important part of managing trauma in children because the accurate dosing of medicine may be critical for resuscitative efforts. A number of methods to estimate weight, including the Broselow tape, Leffler formula, and Theron formula exist.

===Pregnancy===
Trauma occurs in approximately 5% of all pregnancies, and is the leading cause of maternal death. Additionally, pregnant women may experience placental abruption, pre-term labor, and uterine rupture. There are diagnostic issues during pregnancy; ionizing radiation has been shown to cause birth defects, although the doses used for typical exams generally are considered safe. Due to normal physiological changes that occur during pregnancy, shock may be more difficult to diagnose. Where the woman is more than 23 weeks pregnant, it is recommended that the fetus be monitored for at least four hours by cardiotocography.

A number of treatments beyond typical trauma care may be needed when the patient is pregnant. Because the weight of the uterus on the inferior vena cava may decrease blood return to the heart, it may be very beneficial to lay a woman in late pregnancy on her left side. also recommended are Rho(D) immune globulin in those who are rh negative, corticosteroids in those who are 24 to 34 weeks and may need delivery or a caesarean section in the event of cardiac arrest.
==Research==

Most research on trauma occurs during war and military conflicts as militaries will increase trauma research spending in order to prevent combat related deaths. Some research is being conducted on patients who were admitted into an intensive care unit or trauma center, and received a trauma diagnosis that caused a negative change in their health-related quality of life, with a potential to create anxiety and symptoms of depression. New preserved blood products also are being researched for use in pre-hospital care; it is impractical to use the currently available blood products in a timely fashion in remote, rural settings or in theaters of war.

<text>&quot;&quot; (, &quot;Beautiful Rwanda&quot;) has been the national anthem of Rwanda since January 1, 2002. It replaced &quot;&quot;, which was the original national anthem until the 1994 genocide against the Tutsis.

==Background==
Rwanda&#x27;s original national anthem, written when the country achieved independence from Belgium in 1962, was called &quot;Rwanda Rwacu&quot; (&quot;Our Rwanda&quot;). Independence was achieved at a time of high tension, following the Rwandan Revolution: centuries of rule by the minority Tutsi group had been overturned in just three years, the majority Hutu taking power in a violent upheaval, and forcing more than 100,000 to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. The subsequent thirty years, under the presidencies of Grégoire Kayibanda and Juvénal Habyarimana, were marked by continued cycles of violence, culminating in the 1990s with the launch of the Rwandan Civil War by exiled Tutsi led by Paul Kagame, the assassination of President Habyarimana, and the 1994 Rwandan genocide, in which between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed by Hutu extremists, on the orders of the interim government, in the space of just 100 days.

The genocide was ended when Kagame&#x27;s rebel army took control of the country in July 1994. A period of &quot;reconciliation&quot; began, as a unity government took control of the country. Kagame was the &quot;de facto&quot; leader from this point on, and assumed the presidency in 2000. As part of this effort, and ostensibly to signal a break with the country&#x27;s violent past, the government enacted an overhaul of the country&#x27;s symbols, including the flag, the coat of arms and the national anthem. However, some Rwandans at the time expressed doubts about the stated reasoning and merely viewed all this as an attempt by the ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front to assert its political power by changing established state symbols.

== History ==
To commission the lyrics and music for the new state anthem, the government organized a national contest. &quot;Rwanda Nziza&quot; represented the winning entry, with lyrics composed by Faustin Murigo of Karubanda prison, and melody by Captain Jean-Bosco Hashakaimana of the Rwandan army brass band. &quot;Rwanda Nziza&quot; became the official anthem of Rwanda on 1 January 2002.

<doc id="788104" wikidata="Q619196" url="?curid=788104" title="Apollodotus I">
<text>Apollodotus I (Greek: , &quot;Apollódotos ho Sōtḗr&quot;, &quot;Apollodotus the Saviour&quot;), known in Indian sources as Apaladata, was an Indo-Greek king from 180 BC to 160 BC, or between 174 and 165 BC (first dating by Osmund Bopearachchi and R. C. Senior, second dating by Boperachchi) who ruled the western and southern parts of the Indo-Greek kingdom, from Taxila in the Punjab region to the areas of Sindh and possibly Gujarat.

==Ruler of the Indo-Greek kingdom==
Apollodotus whose name means &quot;given by Apollo&quot;, was not the first to strike bilingual coins outside Bactria, but he was the first king who ruled in India only, and therefore the founder of the proper Indo-Greek kingdom. According to W. W. Tarn, Apollodotus I was one of the generals of Demetrius I of Bactria, the Greco-Bactrian king who invaded northwestern India after 180 BC. Tarn was uncertain whether he was a member of the royal house. It is possible he was an illegitimate son of Euthydemus, making him Demetrius’ half brother. Later authors largely agree with Tarn&#x27;s analysis, though with perhaps even more uncertainty regarding who the king was, for his coins do not give many hints.

Apollodotus likely ruled at the same time as Antimachus I and Antimachus II, or was succeeded in India by Antimachus II. It is also likely that king Antimachus II ruled the more western territories closer to Bactria. Eventually Apollodotus was succeeded by Menander I, and the two kings are mentioned by Pompejus Trogus as important Indo-Greek rulers.

The 1st-2nd century AD &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; further testifies to the reign of Apollodotus and the influence of the Indo-Greeks in India:

==Coinage==
The coinage of Apollodotus is, together with that of Menander, one of the most abundant of the Indo-Greek kings. It is found mainly in the provinces of Punjab, Sindh and Gujarat, indicating the southern limit of the Indo-Greek expansion in India. This is also suggested by the Periplus, a 1st-century AD document on trade in the Indian Ocean, which describes the remnants of Greek presence (shrines, barracks, wells, coinage) in the strategic port of Barygaza (Bharuch) in Gujarat. Strabo (XI) also describes the occupation of Patalene (Indus Delta country). While Sindh may have come under his possession, it is not known whether Apollodotus advanced to Gujarat, where the Satavahanas ruled.

Apollodotus also issued a great number of bilingual Indian-standard square coins. Besides the usual royal title, the exact significance of the animals depicted on the coins is unclear. The sacred elephant may be the symbol of the city of Taxila, or possibly the symbol of the white elephant who reputedly entered the womb of the mother of the Buddha, Queen Maya, in a dream, which would make it a symbol of Buddhism, one of the main religions of the Indo-Greek territories.

Similarly, the sacred bull on the reverse may be a symbol of a city (Pushkhalavati), or a depiction of Shiva, making it a symbol of Hinduism, the other major religion at that time. The bull is often represented in a clearly erectile state, which reinforces its interpretation as a representation of Shiva. Conversely, this also reinforces the interpretation of the elephant as a religious symbol. Alternatively, the Bull, according to Foucher, represents the birth of the Buddha, as it happened during the month of &quot;Vaicakha&quot; (April–May), known to Buddhists as Vesak, under the zodiacal sign of the Taurus, during the full moon. The enlightenment and passing of the Buddha also occurred during the Taurus full moon.

===Buddhist and Hindu symbolism===
Before their design was eventually simplified, some of the earlier coins of king Apollodotus directly associate the elephant with Buddhist symbolism, such as the stupa hill (arched-hill symbol) surmounted by a crescent or a star (the Chaitya symbol), also seen, for example on the coins of the Mauryan Empire, many local coins of Taxila or those of the later Kuninda kingdom.

Also the zebu bull on the reverse is often shown with a nandipada taurine mark on its hump on the less-worn coins, which reinforces the role of the animal as a symbol, religious or geographic, rather than just the depiction of an animal for decorative purposes. The nandipada and the zebu bull are generally associated with Nandi, Shiva&#x27;s humped bull in Hinduism. The same association was made later on coins of Zeionises or Vima Kadphises. The elephant, pendant to the bull, and shown with a girdle on the obverse, also must have a symbolic role, possibly Buddhism, as it was associated with the stupa hill in the earliest coins of Apollodotus. 
Apollodotus experimented with different coin standards for his silver, until he settled for a standard lighter than the Attic which would prevail for centuries, though later rulers usually struck round coins instead of the square (typically Indian) shape of most of Apollodotus&#x27; silver. He issued a number of bronzes with Apollo/tripod, that also were repeated for centuries.

===Bactrian coins===
Apollodotus also issued a small series of monolingual Attic tetradrachms, intended for export into Bactria. For these, Apollodotus I clearly used Bactrian celators to strike a realistic portrait of the king as an aged man in the Macedonian Greek hat called kausia, with a reverse of sitting Pallas Athene holding Nike, a common Hellenistic motif introduced by the Diadoch Lysimachus. On these coins, he used no epithet.

<text>Eve van Grafhorst (17 July 1982 – 20 November 1993) was one of the first Australian children to be infected with HIV via a blood transfusion. She became the centre of a controversy in 1985 when she was banned from her local pre-school amid fears she might infect other children.

Van Grafhorst was born prematurely in 1982, and required eleven blood transfusions to save her life. One of the transfusions was contaminated, and she contracted HIV.

In February 1985, her parents enrolled her in a pre-school in Kincumber, New South Wales. When she bit another child, the state medical officer for New South Wales said van Grafhorst should be barred from daycare until she was older. After her condition became known, parents of other preschoolers threatened to withdraw their children if she was re-enrolled, saying that the young girl posed a grave threat of infection. She was eventually permitted to attend school, provided she wore a plastic face mask at all times. Some parents felt that was insufficient, and that the van Grafhorsts should leave town.

The van Grafhorsts did leave, moving to Hastings, New Zealand, in 1986. In contrast to their Australian experience, the van Grafhorst family was welcomed in Hastings. Eve lived a relatively normal life, and attended a local school without incident.

In 1992, she received a Variety Gold Heart Award. Her story had been widely reported throughout the world and, on her tenth birthday, Eve, dressed as a radiant bride, was sent a letter and autographed photograph of Diana, Princess of Wales. After Eve died at home in 1993, aged 11, her mother, Gloria, received a sympathetic letter from Diana, praising Eve for her &quot;courage and strength&quot;.

The 1994 TV documentary &quot;All About Eve&quot; (in reference to the 1950 film), produced by Vincent Burke and directed by Monique Oomen, is a biography of Eve.

<text>Georg Ludwig Heinrich Nicolaus von Below (20 September 1907 – 24 July 1983) was an officer in the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and an adjutant to Adolf Hitler.

==Early life==
Below was born on the estate of Jargelin near Anklam in the Province of Pomerania. He was a member of the German aristocracy.

==Service==
He trained as a pilot in 1929 at the &quot;Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule&quot; (DVS—German Air Transport School). From 1929 to 1933 he served with the &quot;Reichsheer&quot; 12th Infantry Regiment. Below then joined the German Air Force and served with Jagdgeschwader 132 &quot;Richthofen&quot; and then transferred to Jagdgeschwader 26. Below became German dictator Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Air Force (&quot;Luftwaffe&quot;) military adjutant in 1937. Below&#x27;s task was to be the link between Hitler and the air force leadership. Hitler generally disliked and was suspicious of soldiers with aristocratic backgrounds. This was particularly true as the tide of World War II turned against Germany. But Below, with the rank of colonel, was one of the few members of Hitler&#x27;s entourage to continually serve in a close capacity for so many years.

During the time between the Christmas and New Year&#x27;s holiday of 1944, Hitler told Below: &quot;I know the war is lost, the enemy&#x27;s superiority is far too great.&quot; But Hitler, still dwelling on the 20 July Plot to kill him, placed the blame on traitors. He then told Below: &quot;We will never surrender, we may go down, but we will take a world with us.&quot;

===Berlin 1945===
Hitler, presiding over a rapidly disintegrating Third Reich, retreated to his &quot;Führerbunker&quot; in Berlin on 16 January 1945. As his long serving Luftwaffe adjutant, Below traveled with Hitler back to Berlin. Early on, Hitler continued to utilize the undamaged wing of the Reich Chancellery, where he held afternoon military conferences in his large study. However, that practice ended and all the military briefing conferences were moved down into the &quot;Führerbunker&quot;. By April, to the German military leadership and some Nazi Party leaders, it was clear that the Battle for Berlin would be the final battle of the war. On 12 April 1945, Below was a guest of Albert Speer to see the last performance of the Berlin Philharmonic before the city was captured by the Red Army. He later wrote: &quot;The concert took us back to another world.&quot;

On 15 April, Eva Braun was moved into the room next to the room Hitler occupied in the &quot;Führerbunker&quot;. Below wrote the following of her: &quot;She was charming and obliging and showed no weakness right up to the last moment.&quot; 

By 27 April, Below was part of a very small group which were present for the military briefings. General Krebs was the only senior military officer still present and Reich propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, who had moved into the bunker complex with his family, now also was present. On 29 April, after the wedding of Hitler and Braun, Below was a witness to the last will and testament of Adolf Hitler. He did not sign the Political Testament but added his signature to the Private Testament of the document. Thereafter, Below asked Hitler if he could leave the &quot;Führerbunker&quot; and attempt to make it out of Berlin to the west. Hitler granted him permission to leave. On 30 April, Below left Berlin carrying a letter from Hitler to Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel explaining the recent events of betrayal and extolling the sacrifices of the German people.

==Post-war==
He was arrested by the British in 1946 and held until 1948. After the war, Below wrote a memoir of his experiences as an adjutant to Hitler from 1937 to 1945, &quot;Als Hitlers Adjutant 1937–45&quot; (1980), translated as &quot;At Hitler&#x27;s Side&quot; (2001) (). He died on 24 July 1983 in Detmold, West Germany.

<text>Donald Kenneth Sundquist (March 15, 1936 – August 27, 2023) was an American businessman and politician who served as the 47th governor of Tennessee from 1995 to 2003. Prior to his governorship, he represented Tennessee&#x27;s 7th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 1983 to 1995. He was a member of the Republican Party.

==Early life==
Sundquist was born on March 15, 1936 in Moline, Illinois, the son of Kenneth and Louise (Rohren) Sundquist. His father was of Swedish descent, while his mother was of German descent.

After graduating from Moline High School in 1953, he attended Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois, obtaining his B.A. in Business Administration in 1957. He was a member of the Rho Nu Delta fraternity at Augustana. He served in the United States Navy from 1957 to 1963, including two years on active duty.

Sundquist joined Jostens in 1961, and initially worked at the company&#x27;s plants in Princeton, Illinois, and Owatonna, Minnesota. In 1962, he was transferred to the company plant in Shelbyville, Tennessee, where he became plant manager. He left Jostens in 1972 and moved to Memphis, where he established an advertising and printing firm, Graphic Sales of America.

While in Memphis, Sundquist became active in Republican Party politics. He served as an organizer of the Barry Goldwater 1964 presidential campaign. He served as Chair of the national Young Republicans from 1971 to 1973, and chair of the Shelby County Republican Party from 1975 to 1977. He was a delegate to the 1976 Republican National Convention and the 1980 Republican National Convention, and managed the presidential campaign of Howard Baker during the 1980 election cycle.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

In 1982, Sundquist sought the seat of Congressman Robin Beard, who was retiring to run against Jim Sasser for the U.S. Senate. Beard&#x27;s district, the 6th, had been renumbered as the 7th following redistricting. In the general election, Sundquist edged Bob Clement, son of former Governor Frank G. Clement, by just over 1,000 votes out of over 145,000 votes cast. He would never face another contest nearly that close; he was unopposed for reelection in 1984 and was reelected three more times after that with almost no difficulty.

While in Congress, Sundquist established a conservative voting record, and was popular with conservative-oriented groups such as the National Federation of Independent Business and the American Conservative Union. He was a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, serving on the Subcommittee on Trade and the Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures. He was also a member of the Republican Task Force on Trade, and the Republican Task Force on Ethics Reform.

==Governor of Tennessee==
===First term===

In 1994, Sundquist ran for governor of Tennessee in the race to replace the Democratic incumbent, Ned McWherter, who was term-limited. He easily won the nomination, winning over 80% of the vote in the primary, and faced the Democratic nominee, Nashville mayor Phil Bredesen, in the general election. Bredesen criticized Sundquist for voting against a minimum wage increase while voting for a congressional pay raise. Sundquist accused Bredesen of flip-flopping on issues such as public funding for abortion and school privatization. On election day, Sundquist won, 807,104 votes to 664,252.

During his first term, Sundquist focused on government efficiency and welfare reform. He signed the &quot;Families First&quot; bill in 1996, which reduced the number of families on welfare from 70,000 to 30,000. He also signed a series of crime-related measures which called for tougher sentences and more focus on victims&#x27; rights. In 1996, Sundquist eliminated the state&#x27;s scandal-ridden Public Service Commission, replacing it with the Tennessee Regulatory Authority. That same year, he created the Department of Children&#x27;s Services.

===Second term===

In 1998, Sundquist easily won renomination, defeating Memphis realtor Shirley Beck-Vosse, 258,786 votes to 28,951. In the general election, he easily defeated his Democratic opponent, John Jay Hooker, 669,973 votes to 287,790. Shortly after winning reelection in November 1998, Sundquist implemented the ConnectTen program, which made Tennessee the first state in the nation to connect its schools and libraries to the Internet.

During his second term, Sundquist set out to raise more revenue for the state, which had traditionally been one of the lowest-tax jurisdictions in the country. He was concerned that the sales tax, which the state relied upon for much of its revenue, was too unstable, and prevented the state from competing with other Southern states in education and infrastructure. His tax reform plan therefore included a state income tax, the proposal of which had long been a third rail in Tennessee state politics. Many of his political allies turned against him, and anti-income tax street demonstrations were held in Nashville. In July 2001, demonstrators vandalized Sundquist&#x27;s office, and broke windows in the state capitol when the legislature was considering the income tax measure.

==Post-governorship==
In 2002, toward the end of Sundquist&#x27;s second term, a Nashville television station, NewsChannel 5, uncovered evidence businesses owned by Sundquist&#x27;s friends were illegally given no-bid contracts by the state. In December of that year, the FBI raided the offices of Education Networks of America (ENA), founded by Sundquist&#x27;s friend, Al Ganier, as part of an investigation into whether or not Ganier used his relationship with Sundquist to obtain millions of dollars worth of state contracts (including the ConnectTenn contract). Ganier eventually pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of unauthorized use of a computer.

In May 2004, a State of Tennessee Labor Department employee, Joanna Ediger, was convicted of rigging a $2 million state contract for Workforce Strategists, a company owned by another Sundquist friend, John Stamps. The following year, Stamps pleaded guilty to four counts of tax evasion and one count of making false statements. U.S. District Judge Karl Forester said Sundquist was the &quot;impetus&quot; for the investigations, although he was never implicated in any wrongdoing, nor were any senior members of his administration.

In July 2005, Sundquist was named head of a national panel on improving Medicaid. The panel was appointed by HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt.

Sundquist served as state vice chair of the John McCain 2008 presidential campaign team.

Sundquist&#x27;s papers are archived at the University of Tennessee Libraries.

==Personal life and death==
Sundquist married Martha Swanson in 1959. They had three children.

Don Sundquist died in Memphis on August 27, 2023, at the age of 87, following surgery and a short illness.

<text>Ironseed is a 1994 MS-DOS video game, developed and published by Channel 7. It is a space trading and combat game with real-time strategy elements.

==Plot==
The game plays in fictional alternative reality in the future, several hundred years ahead. The game starts when the eponymous space ship, the &quot;Ironseed&quot;, flees a theocracy on Mars. The ship is crewed by disembodied, digitized rebels originally scheduled for termination. In hastily fleeing, the ship suffers damage and gets lost in time and space. The crew finds itself in unknown space somewhere in the Milky Way with a badly damaged ship and nearly depleted fuel reserves. First objective is therefore finding resources for ship repairs and fuel while gathering intelligence about the surrounding space and also their own history. After encountering other alien species and learning about some greater threat, the ultimate goal becomes to forge an alliance of several alien races to counter this threat.

== Gameplay ==
The player begins with a single ship and a chosen crew. Planets are randomly generated and numerous ship designs and crew selection allow for different playing styles. Technology research, space exploration, resource management and gathering, production, crew management and alien diplomacy are essential elements. New ships, new upgrades, and ancient artifacts help the player in their efforts. Combat can be both in the form of random encounters or planned for by the player.

==History==
=== Development and release ===
The story and art were created by Jeremy Stanton, the code was written by Robert W. Morgan III. The music was composed by the computer musician Andrew Sega who gained reputation in the 1990s demoscene as &quot;Necros&quot;. The game was released and distributed by Softdisk in 1994.

=== Legacy and support ===
The game was written with Borland Turbo Pascal for DOS and the usual hardware at that time. Also, like many software at that time, a buggy CRT library included in Turbo Pascal was used, resulting in &#x27;Runtime Error 200&#x27; messages on CPUs faster than approximately 200 MHz. Therefore, running the game on modern OSes and faster hardware needed emulation solutions like DOSBox. The &quot;Runtime error 200&quot; bug was finally fixed with a fan patch in 2013, almost 20 years after the game&#x27;s original release.

=== Successor and source-code release ===
After the game was unavailable commercially for many years it was re-released as freeware around 2003 to promote the development of the successor &quot;Ironseed II&quot; / &quot;Ironseed Reborn&quot;. As progress on the development of the successor and further patching of &quot;Ironseed&quot; was unlikely, the source code of &quot;Ironseed 1&quot; was released by the developers to the public under the GPL in March 2013. A final patch (v1.20.0016) was released with the source code, but also the forum was shut down. Later version 1.30.0001 was put on GitHub, for the first time including the graphic assets and sound effects under GPL, but the commercial DMP sound module stripped out to comply with its license. From the source code release missing is also the soundtrack, while it seems the rights on the soundtrack still belong to the developers. For instance, Morgan redistributes the soundtrack on his personal website and also the freeware release included the soundtrack. In September 2013, due to availability of the source code, a Free Pascal and SDL based port for Linux became available on GitHub. In August 2015 the &quot;Ironseed.com&quot; mainsite went offline without warning, but came back online in January 2016 under a new &quot;ironseed.net&quot; domain. In April 2016 the game was ported to the ARM-based Pandora handheld, based on the previous Linux port. Since August 2020, there is bugfixed SDL port available.

=== Port and re-release ===
Work on a re-skinned re-release by the original developers as a port for Windows is underway using the Unity Engine. Samples and the forum for discussion can be found on reddit in the ironseed subreddit.

==Reception==
&quot;Ironseed&quot; received a Top Dog award from Home of the Underdogs, who highlighted the game&#x27;s replayability through the random planets and options, and allowance of different playing styles through the various ship designs and crews. It drew comparisons with the earlier &quot;Starflight&quot; series and the later &quot;Master of Orion&quot;.

In March 1995, the Slovenian computer magazine &quot;Megazin&quot; rated Ironseed 63 of 100.
In March 2017, &quot;Rock Paper Shotgun&quot;&#x27;s Adam Smith revisited &quot;Ironseed&quot;, compared it to &quot;Star Control 2&quot; and &quot;Captain Blood&quot;, and described it as &quot;weird, trippy sci-fi that blew my tiny mind&quot; and &quot;a little bit &quot;Space Rangers&quot;, a little bit &quot;Star Control&quot; and just a teensy bit &quot;FTL&quot;&quot;.

<doc id="788221" wikidata="Q3856913" url="?curid=788221" title="Mickey Evans (footballer, born 1973)">
<text>Michael James Evans (born 1 January 1973) is a former professional footballer who played as a forward. He spent most of his career with Plymouth Argyle, for whom he scored 73 goals in 384 appearances in the Football League. He also played in the Premier League for Southampton and the Football League for West Bromwich Albion, Bristol Rovers and Torquay United. Born in England, Evans earned one cap for the Republic of Ireland at full international level.

==Club career==

===Plymouth Argyle===
Evans originally joined Plymouth Argyle in December 1987 as an associate schoolboy. He made his first team debut in December 1990 at the age of 17, and signed his first professional contract in March 1991.

He was a member of Neil Warnock&#x27;s Plymouth side which won promotion from the Third Division via the play-offs in 1996. Following that success, in March 1997 he was signed by Graeme Souness at Southampton for £650,000.

===Southampton===
Souness signed Evans to add a bit of muscle to the forward line as Southampton entered the final lap of a desperate fight to avoid relegation from the Premier League in the 1996–97 season.

He was a big and brave striker and scored four crucial goals as Saints beat the drop, finishing in 16th position. His greatest game in a Saints shirt came at Nottingham Forest&#x27;s City Ground, where he scored a brace. For the second goal, he sprinted from the half-way line, taking a pass from Eyal Berkovic to beat goalkeeper Mark Crossley who could only half block the shot.

He followed this up with two more goals against West Ham United and Coventry City, and his form in April 1997 was such that he was awarded the Premiership Player-of-the-Month Trophy.

Evans became somewhat of a cult figure amongst Southampton fans which many of them making a tongue-in-cheek reference to his West Country roots by wearing straw hats and having straw hanging from their mouths as well as donning fake versions of Evans&#x27; then trademark bushy sideburns. Saints fans attributed their Premier League survival solely to Evans&#x27; goals and performances during that period.

The following season, Souness had been replaced as Saints&#x27; manager by Dave Jones and Evans lost his place to Kevin Davies. Although he was to make a handful of appearances in the 1997–98 season, his career at The Dell only lasted just over six months and in October 1997 he moved on to West Bromwich Albion for a fee of £750,000.

A few days before his transfer to The Hawthorns, he won a Republic of Ireland cap against Romania.

===West Bromwich Albion and Bristol Rovers===
Evans made his Albion debut on 29 November 1997, coming on as a late substitute in a 1–0 defeat away at Middlesbrough. Used mainly as a substitute during 1997–98, it took him 12 games to register his first goal for the club, scoring in a 2–0 win at Swindon Town on 7 February 1998. Evans&#x27; time at West Brom was frequently blighted by injury and illness. It wasn&#x27;t until his later return to Plymouth when it was discovered that Evans had an asthmatic-related complaint which had contributed to his lack of form and fitness. He was loaned out to Bristol Rovers, a successful spell which led to a £250,000 permanent deal being struck in September 2000.

===Back to Argyle===
After an unsuccessful spell at Bristol Rovers, Evans then returned to Plymouth Argyle as one of the first signings of Paul Sturrock, joining on transfer deadline day 2001 for £30,000.

Although not a prolific goalscorer, after the diagnosis of his condition, the now healthier Evans played an important role in the Pilgrims&#x27; recent success; in particular his hold-up play and lay-offs created numerous goalscoring opportunities for his teammates. He scored the opening goal in Argyle&#x27;s 4–1 Third Division Championship match sealing victory at Darlington in the 2001–02 season.

He was named Argyle&#x27;s &quot;Player of the Year&quot; during their title-winning Division Two campaign in 2003–04. He scored the opening goal in the 2–0 home victory over Q.P.R which was decisive in confirming Plymouth Argyle as that season&#x27;s Division Two champions.

The 33-year-old Plymothian announced his decision to leave Plymouth Argyle, saying &quot;the time is right for me to move on&quot;, with effect from the Pilgrims&#x27; final Championship game of the season on 30 April 2006.

Evans scored the winning goal with a diving header in his last appearance for Plymouth Argyle against Ipswich Town, to secure the club a 14th-place finish in the Football League Championship (the highest finish for the club in two decades) and forever sealing his status as a Plymouth Argyle &quot;legend&quot; amongst the club&#x27;s fans.

===Final year and retirement===
On 18 May 2006, Evans signed on a free transfer for local rivals Torquay United, where he scored once against Bury. On 24 November 2006, he decided to retire from professional football, a decision coinciding with a period of deep unrest among Torquay United&#x27;s players.

==International career==
Evans&#x27; only cap for the Republic of Ireland national football team was against Romania in a 1998 World Cup Qualifier at Lansdowne Road on 11 October 1997. He came on in the 85th minute to replace Tony Cascarino.

==Personal life==
Evans attended St Boniface&#x27;s Catholic College and played Junior football for Prince Rock Youth during his schools days. He is nicknamed &quot;Trigger&quot; after a character from Only Fools and Horses. During his second spell with his hometown club he set up his building company MJ Evans. In 2007 and 2008, having retired from playing, Evans was involved in a series of testimonial events to raise money for five local charities. In July 2012, the company filed for administration.

<text>Francis Cotes (20 May 1726 – 16 July 1770) was an English portrait painter, one of the pioneers of English pastel painting (or drawing), and a founding member of the Royal Academy in 1768.

==Life and work==

He was born in London, the eldest son of Robert Cotes, an apothecary (Francis&#x27;s younger brother Samuel Cotes (1734–1818) also became an artist, specialising in miniatures). Cotes trained with portrait painter George Knapton (1698–1778) before setting up his own business in his father&#x27;s business premises in London&#x27;s Cork Street—learning, incidentally, much about chemistry to inform his making of pastels.

An admirer of the pastel drawings of Rosalba Carriera, Cotes concentrated on works in pastel and crayon (some of which became well known as engravings). After pushing crayon to its limit as a medium—although he was never to abandon it entirely—Cotes turned to oil painting as a means of developing his style in larger-scale works. In his most successful paintings, particularly those of the early 1760s, the oil paint is thinly applied, in imitation of his pastel technique, and imbued with charm, inviting comparisons with Allan Ramsay and Sir Joshua Reynolds. They have clarity and warmth and possess a remarkable attention to costume. In 1763, he bought a large house (later occupied by George Romney) in Cavendish Square. He also painted &quot;The Young Cricketer&quot;.
After 1746, the costumes in his pictures were mostly executed by the specialist drapery painter Peter Toms.

One of the most fashionable portrait painters of his day, Cotes helped found the Society of Artists of Great Britain and became its director in 1765. At the peak of his powers, Cotes was invited to become one of the first members of the Royal Academy, but died just two years later, aged 44, in Richmond.

He also taught pastel skills to John Russell, who described Cotes&#x27; techniques in his book &quot;The Elements of Painting with Crayon&quot;.

<text>Kilchurn Castle () is a ruined structure on a rocky peninsula at the northeastern end of Loch Awe, in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. It was first constructed in the mid-15th century as the base of the Campbells of Glenorchy, who extended both the castle and their territory in the area over the next 150 years. After the Campbells became Earls of Breadalbane and moved to Taymouth Castle, Kilchurn fell out of use and was in ruins by 1770. It is now in the care of Historic Environment Scotland and is open to the public in summer.

==History==
The Campbells of Glenorchy were the most powerful cadet branch of the Clan Campbell, and over two centuries from the 1430s came to dominate the central Highlands. The building of several castles, of which Kilchurn was the first, was a key part of their territorial expansion during this period. Sir Colin Campbell, 1st of Glenorchy (died 1475), was a younger son of Duncan Campbell, 1st Lord Campbell, ancestor of the Earls of Argyll. Sir Colin was granted Glen Orchy and other lands by his father in 1432, and afterwards established Kilchurn around 1450. The first castle comprised the five-storey tower house, with a courtyard defended by an outer wall. At the time Kilchurn was on a small island scarcely larger than the castle itself, and would have been accessed via an underwater or low-lying causeway.

Sir Colin&#x27;s son, Sir Duncan Campbell of Glenorchy, built the &#x27;laich hall&#x27; - a single-storey dining hall built along the inside of the south curtain. Sir Duncan was one of the many Scottish nobles killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. During the second half of the 16th century, another Sir Colin Campbell, the 6th Laird (1499–1583), further improved the castle&#x27;s accommodation by adding some chambers to the north of the tower house, and remodelling the parapet. This included the introduction of the circular corner turrets adorned by corbels. Sir Colin also constructed Balloch Castle (now Taymouth Castle) by Loch Tay, to consolidate the Campbell&#x27;s territorial gains in Perthshire, which had been achieved largely at the expense of their former allies, the Clan MacGregor of Glenstrae.

Sir Duncan Campbell, 1st Baronet, (c.1550–1631), known as &quot;Black Duncan&quot;, represented Argyll in the Scottish Parliament and was created a baronet, of Glenorchy in the County of Perth, in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia in 1625. Sir Duncan had the south range of the castle rebuilt and enlarged in 1614, and constructed a new range incorporating a chapel in the south-east part of the courtyard. The ambitious Black Duncan also began construction of Finlarig Castle at the west end of Loch Tay, and improved farmland around Finlarig, Kilchurn and Balloch Castles. In 1629, Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel was born at the Castle. His mother, Margaret Campbell, was a daughter of the 3rd Baronet, and had married a Cameron of Lochiel.

In 1681 Sir John Campbell, 5th Baronet, was created Earl of Breadalbane and Holland. He took advantage of the turbulence of the times, negotiating with Jacobite rebels at the same time as serving William III. In 1693 he promoted a scheme to pacify the Highlands, and as part of this he began conversion of Kilchurn into a modern barracks, capable of housing 200 troops. His main addition was the three-storey L-shaped block along the north side. In 1714, on the death of Queen Anne, Breadalbane held a conference of Jacobites at Kilchurn, and he subsequently joined the Earl of Mar&#x27;s Jacobite rising of 1715. Following the failure of the rising he returned home to find pro-government members of his household had turned Kinchurn and Finlarig over to Alexander Campbell of Fonab, to whom Breadalbane was obliged to surrender in February 1716. He remained under house arrest at Taymouth until his death the next year. Kilchurn was also used as a government garrison during the 1745 Jacobite rising. The Campbells attempted, unsuccessfully, to sell Kilchurn to the government after they moved in 1740 to the reconstructed Taymouth Castle.

In 1760, the castle was badly damaged by lightning and was completely abandoned; the remains of a turret of a tower, still resting upside-down in the centre of the courtyard, attest to the violence of the storm. The castle was unroofed by 1770. J. M. W. Turner painted the castle on one of his tours of Scotland in the early 19th century. In 1817 the water level in Loch Awe was altered, so that the castle now stands on a long peninsula. MacGibbon and Ross surveyed the castle in about 1887, after which restoration works appear to have altered some of the castle&#x27;s original features.

The ruin is now in the care of Historic Environment Scotland, and is open to the public during the summer. Access is either by boat from Lochawe pier, or on foot from the A85 near Dalmally. The access is under the railway viaduct that crosses Loch Awe, and access is sometimes restricted by higher-than-usual levels of water in the loch, which turn the site into a temporary island. The castle is a scheduled monument.

The castle is currently closed for conservation works. Signage on the security fencing surrounding the castle states the closure is due to danger from falling masonry. There is no indicated time scale for reopening. Visitors can, however, walk around the castle. Entrance to the pier is also closed.

<text>Andrew Gregory Sega ( ; born May 20, 1975), also known as Necros, is an American musician best known for tracking modules in the 1990s demoscene as well as for composing music for several well-known video games. He was a member of the synthpop duo Iris from 2001 until its disbandment in 2021. In 2020, he founded the dark wave duo Hallowed Hearts.

Sega is the owner of the independent record label Diffusion Records. His main solo project is known as The Alpha Conspiracy.

==Biography==
Andrew Sega was born on May 20, 1975, in Providence, Rhode Island and lived the majority of his young life in Upstate New York. His interest in music began when he was 7 years old, when he started playing and experimenting with an electronic organ he had in his house. He later started taking lessons with an organist from a Polish church in Rome, New York, where he learned almost exclusively baroque music. Later in high school he learned to play other instruments, including bass clarinet and piano.

Sega&#x27;s first records were from artists such as Men at Work, Genesis, and Fleetwood Mac. He discovered trackers in his first year of college (1993) from a friend who showed him Future Crew&#x27;s &quot;Unreal&quot; demo. Sega was amazed with how good the music sounded. He eventually discovered FastTracker 1.0, and began writing MOD music for the first time. His first demo group was Psychic Monks. Through the mid-1990s he contributed music to various demo and music groups, and music disks such as &quot;Epidemic&quot; (1994), featuring other noted tracker musicians like Purple Motion and Skaven.

Sega later helped form the legendary tracking group Five Musicians, which featured other notable figures, such as Jeroen Tel, Basehead and Hunz. He was also a member of German demogroup Legend Design, and iCE. Sega programmed and/or composed music for several demoscene productions, such as the NAID &#x27;95 demo &quot;Eden&quot; and 1996 demo &quot;Babylon&quot;. His composition, &quot;Ascent of the Cloud Eagle&quot;, won the first place at NAID &#x27;95. In a 1998 interview, Sega declared that he had composed around four hundred finished songs.

He gradually left the demoscene behind and started making music for video games, beginning with little known titles such as &quot;In Pursuit of Greed&quot;, &quot;Ironseed&quot; and &quot;Xixit&quot;, then moving on to Origin Systems&#x27; &quot;&quot; series, where he worked as a software engineer and composer. Sega was a founding member of the video game music production company Straylight Productions, contributing tracks to the first-person shooters &quot;Unreal&quot; and &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;. Later, he joined Digital Anvil (now a part of Microsoft Game Studios), and worked as a programmer and musician on &quot;Freelancer&quot;. In 2006 he founded Diffusion Games, a gaming company which focuses on exploring emotional and social aspects of interactivity.

In 2001, Sega founded The Alpha Conspiracy, and released two studio albums, &quot;Cipher&quot; (2001) and &quot;Aura&quot; (2004), and a split EP with Low Technicians, &quot;Forward Rewinding&quot; (2002). He also founded Diffusion Records, an independent record label through which he released The Alpha Conspiracy debut album. Gradually, Diffusion Records became a full-featured label, releasing albums by Iris, CTRL, Low Technicians, and Kilowatts and Vanek.

Sega was introduced to Iris in 2001. He started working on several test tracks with Reagan Jones before becoming an official member in 2002.

Sega is also a live member of industrial hip hop group Stromkern. As of 2011, he was working on a dark electropop side-project with Julia Beyer (Chandeen, Technoir). In 2012 Sega and Dan Clark from Stromkern teamed up under the name The Mighty Chouffe and released an EP, &quot;The West Town&quot;. In 2013 he released &quot;Obelus&quot;, the debut album from his new side-project XYZZY. In 2020, Sega and Alex Virlios (Blue Images, CTRL, Exit) formed Hallowed Hearts and released their debut album &quot;Into the Fire&quot;.

Sega&#x27;s influences include Underworld, μ-Ziq, Aphex Twin, Radiohead, Orbital, Fluke, The Prodigy, Hybrid, Mouse on Mars, Depeche Mode, Rush, Genesis, XTC, Public Enemy, Imogen Heap, and The Chemical Brothers, among others. He has described alternative rock, folk, techno, ambient, jazz, and synthpop as his favorite genres, but has noted that he tries to avoid the categorization of music.

Sega studied computer science and philosophy at Stony Brook University. Throughout the years, he has worked primarily as a full-time software engineer for video games.

<text>Frank Nicholas Stanton (March 20, 1908 – December 24, 2006) was an American broadcasting executive who served as the president of CBS between 1946 and 1971 and then as vice chairman until 1973. He also served as the chairman of the Rand Corporation from 1961 until 1967.

== Early life ==
Stanton was born March 20, 1908, in Muskegon, Michigan, to Helen Josephine Schmidt and Frank Cooper Stanton. He attended Stivers School for the Arts (then called Stivers High School) in Dayton, Ohio. He then attended Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio, receiving a B.A. in 1930. He married his childhood sweetheart, Ruth Stephenson, in 1931. He taught for one year in the manual arts department of a high school in Dayton, then attended Ohio State University, where he received his Ph.D. in 1935. He also held a diploma from the American Board of Professional Psychology. His doctoral thesis was entitled &quot;A Critique of Present Methods and a New Plan for Studying Radio Listening Behavior&quot;; for his research, he invented a device that would make a reliable, automatic record of radio listening. 

Soon after earning his Ph.D., Stanton became the third employee in the CBS research department. By 1942 he was a vice president of CBS and a fellow of the American Association of Applied Psychology, as well as a member of the American Psychological Association, the American Statistical Association, and the American Marketing Association; he was on the editorial board of the journal &quot;Sociometry&quot;. During World War II, he consulted for the Office of War Information, the Secretary of War, and the Department of the Navy, while serving as a vice president at CBS. He was selected as the administrator-designate of the Emergency Communications Agency, part of a secret group created by President Eisenhower in 1958 that would serve in the event of a national emergency that became known as the Eisenhower Ten.

==Career==
===Color television===
Stanton helped lead the fight for color television. By 1950 CBS had been working on its field-sequential system of color TV for a decade. On October 11, 1950 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved CBS&#x27;s system as the first official color standard for commercial broadcasting in the U.S., although subsequent court challenges delayed actual commercial broadcasting until June 25, 1951.

On that day, Stanton appeared on an hour-long special, &quot;Premiere&quot;, with Robert Alda, Faye Emerson, Ed Sullivan, Arthur Godfrey, William S. Paley and others to introduce the CBS color system.

CBS color broadcasting only lasted for four months. CBS suspended it when the manufacture of color television receivers was halted by the US government as part of the Korean War effort. When the ban on color sets was rescinded in 1953, CBS announced that it had no plans to resume broadcasting using its field-sequential color system. A major problem with the CBS system was that the video was not &quot;compatible&quot; with existing black-and-white TV sets. A competing dot-sequential color system being developed by RCA was compatible, and in late 1953, the FCC switched its approval to an RCA-based system of broadcasting color TV.

===1950s controversies===
During the period of McCarthyism, Stanton created an office at CBS to review the political leanings of employees. Although right-wing journalists considered CBS left-leaning, branding it &quot;the Red Network,&quot; CBS maintained a questionnaire inquiring about journalists&#x27; political affiliations. At Stanton&#x27;s direction, employees were required to take an oath of loyalty to the US government. Stanton and Paley &quot;found it expedient to hire only those who were politically neutral&quot; as they wished to avoid taking a position against the FCC and Congress or to jeopardize profit by taking &quot;a stand against the vigilantes.&quot; According to radio historian Jim Cox, &quot;CBS and the blacklisting became synonymous.&quot; CBS, in response to the culture of blacklisting, instituted a &quot;purge of its own,&quot; as had Hollywood and President Truman. Paley was more responsible for policy setting, and Stanton was its main executor. Radio producer William N. Robson was one victim of the CBS purge; initially reassured by Stanton that his listing in the anticommunist &quot;Red Channels&quot; pamphlet would not mean the end of his career with CBS, Robson eventually found the executive office of CBS nonresponsive to his inquiries, and his earnings collapsed. &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot;, a 2005 film portraying this era, avoids mentioning Stanton, partly because Stanton was still living and could have objected to his portrayal.

Stanton played a role in the infamous controversy involving Arthur Godfrey, CBS&#x27;s top money-earner in the early 1950s. Godfrey insisted that the cast members of two of his three CBS shows, a group of singers known as the &quot;Little Godfreys,&quot; refrain from hiring managers. When one singer, Julius La Rosa, hired a manager after a minor dispute with Godfrey, the star consulted with Stanton, who suggested that he fire the popular La Rosa, then a rising star, on the air, just as he had hired him on the air in 1951. Godfrey did so on October 19, 1953 without informing La Rosa before the airing. The move caused an enormous backlash against Godfrey. Stanton later told Godfrey biographer Arthur Singer, &quot;Maybe (the recommendation) was a mistake.&quot;

===Role in televising presidential debates===
Stanton organized the first televised presidential debate in American history. After an eight-year effort, he convinced the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to suspend Section 315 of the Communications Act of 1934 for the election in 1960, which stipulated the provision of equal air time to all candidates. Stanton thereby enabled the first two-candidate presidential television debate, which was held at and televised from the CBS studio in Chicago, with candidates John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon.

The debates, however, ceased after the 1960 election, as Lyndon B. Johnson avoided debating in 1964, and Nixon, widely perceived to have made a poor impression on television viewers in 1960, declined to debate in 1968 and in 1972. Thus televised presidential debates did not resume until 1976, when incumbent president Gerald Ford, perceiving he was behind in the polls, agreed to debate challenger Jimmy Carter.

===Quiz show scandals===

While Edward R. Murrow&#x27;s 1958 speech before the Radio-Television News Directors Association is often praised for its call for a deeper commitment among broadcasters to public service, Stanton in May 1959 (speaking before his graduate alma mater, Ohio State) also voiced his own commitment to public affairs. He promised that the following year, CBS would air a frequent prime-time public-affairs series, a series which later became &quot;CBS Reports&quot;. A few months later, in an October 1959 speech before the same RTNDA that Murrow had addressed in 1958, Stanton promised there would be no repeat of the program deceptions embodied by the quiz show scandals and cancelled all quiz shows at the time.

===&quot;The Selling of the Pentagon&quot;===
As president of CBS, Stanton&#x27;s greatest battle with the government occurred in 1971, and focused on just this parallel to print press rights. The controversy surrounded &quot;The Selling of the Pentagon,&quot; a &quot;CBS Reports&quot; documentary, which exposed the huge expenditure of public funds, partly illegal, to promote militarism. The confrontation raised the issue of whether television news programming deserved protection under the First Amendment.

The program came under intense criticism from two men who appeared on the program, from the House of Representatives, other media and some prominent politicians. Daniel Henkins, Undersecretary of Defense for Public Relations, charged that statements from his interview with Roger Mudd about his work had been doctored, as did Col. John MacNeil, who accused CBS of rearranging his comments in a speech he gave about the situation in Southeast Asia. The Investigations Subcommittee of the House Commerce Committee subpoenaed CBS&#x27;s outtakes to determine whether or not distortion had taken place. Meanwhile, critics at the &quot;Washington Post&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; magazine, while not taking issue with the thesis of &quot;Selling&quot; that the Pentagon was engaging in propaganda, objected to the editing techniques employed in its production. The program was also criticized by Vice President Spiro Agnew and Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird.

Against threat of jail, Stanton refused the subpoena from the House Commerce Committee ordering him to provide copies of the outtakes and scripts from the documentary. He claimed that such materials are protected by the freedom of the press guaranteed by the First Amendment. Stanton observed that if such subpoena actions were allowed, there would be a &quot;chilling effect&quot; upon broadcast journalism.

For his efforts in that situation, Stanton was awarded one of three personal Peabody Awards (the others coming in 1959 and 1960). He also shared two other Peabodys that were awarded to CBS as a network.

==Retirement==

Stanton was required to retire from CBS at 65 by a policy he had established. (The same policy would lead to Walter Cronkite&#x27;s retirement from the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; in 1981.) Although Stanton said he &quot;wasn&#x27;t about to break&quot; his own policy, it is often speculated that he wanted to stay on longer but was prevented from doing so by Paley. The two men had a bitter relationship by the time of Stanton&#x27;s retirement: Stanton resented being forced to retire and being denied the chairmanship of CBS, while Paley thought Stanton ungrateful for Paley&#x27;s contribution to his career. Stanton continued his relationship with CBS, contractually receiving at least $100,000 per year for consulting until 1988, plus office space, secretarial support, and other expenses. In 1975 Stanton held about 355,000 shares in CBS, then worth more than $18 million. After CBS Stanton made numerous investments in start-ups and other companies.

===Philanthropy===

Stanton served for many years as a Red Cross volunteer, concentrating on public information and fundraising. After retiring from CBS, he was appointed Chairman of the American National Red Cross by President Richard Nixon in 1973, serving in that capacity until 1979.

From 1969 to 1970, while still president of CBS, Stanton served on the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s 100th Anniversary Committee.

==Death and legacy==
Stanton died in his sleep at his home in Boston on December 24, 2006, at the age of 98.

The Center for Communication in New York, founded by Stanton in 1980, presents a Frank Stanton Award annually to &quot;individuals who exemplify achievement and excellence in any genre of mass communication&quot;. The Center&#x27;s mission is to connect students of media to professionals in the industry. Stanton cofounded with Andrew Heiskell the Center for Public Policy in Telecommunication at the City University of New York.

The Frank Stanton Studios in Los Angeles house American Public Media&#x27;s Marketplace Productions.

The Harvard School of Public Health established the Frank Stanton Directorship of the Center for Health Communication, with Dr. Jay Winsten as the incumbent.

The philanthropic Stanton Foundation was created upon his death. On October 5, 2011 the Stanton Foundation awarded the Wikimedia Foundation $3.6 million, the foundation&#x27;s largest-ever grant. The Frank Stanton Veterinary Spectrum of Care Clinic at the Ohio State University was named in his honor when it opened in spring 2021.

<text>Yarsanism (), Ahl-e Haqq (,; ), or Kaka&#x27;i, is an inherited, syncretic religion founded by Sultan Sahak in the late 14th century in western Iran. The total number of followers of Yarsanism is estimated to be over half a million to one million in Iran. The numbers in Iraq are unknown. Followers are mostly Kurds from the Guran, Sanjâbi, Kalhor, Zangana and Jalalvand tribes. There are also ethnic Turkoman Yarsanis.

Some Yarsanis in Iraq are called &quot;Kaka&#x27;i&quot;. Yarsanis say that some people call them disparagingly as &quot;Ali Allahi&quot; or &quot;worshipers of Ali&quot;, labels which Yarsanis deny. Many Yarsanis hide their religion due to the pressure of Iran&#x27;s Islamic system, and there are no exact statistics of their population.

The Yarsanis have a distinct religious literature primarily written in the Gorani language. However, few modern Yarsani can read or write Gorani, as their mother tongue is Southern Kurdish or Sorani.

Their central religious book is called the &quot;Kalâm-e Saranjâm&quot;, written in the 15th century and based on the teachings of Sultan Sahak.

== Geography ==
The majority of Yarsan followers live in Kermanshah Province and adjacent areas of Lorestan Province and Ilam Province in Iran. They are the predominant religious population in Mahidasht, Bivanij and Zohab districts of Kermanshah, and populate rural areas of Delfan, Holeylan and Posht-e Kuh in Ilam and Lorestan.

The main urban centers of the religion are Sahneh, Kerend-e Gharb and Gahvareh, and other important cities include Kermanshah, Sarpol-e Zahab and Qasr-e Shirin.

Other areas in Iran with a significant Yarsan population include Hashtgerd and Varamin near Tehran and Maragheh, and Tabriz in Iranian Azerbaijan, where important Turkic-speaking Yarsan communities live and use Turkic for many of their religious texts. The Yarsani tradition claims that all early communities used Gorani as their religious language, but that over time, some groups were forced to adopt a Turkic language closely akin to Azeri for all purposes, including religion.

In Iraq, Yarsan followers mainly live in Mosul, Kirkuk, Kalar, Khanaqin, Erbil, Sulaymaniyah, and Halabja.

==Beliefs==
The Yarsani follow the mystical teachings of Sultan Sahak ( 14th–15th century). From the Yarsani point of view, the universe is composed of two distinct yet interrelated worlds: the internal (&quot;bātinī&quot;) and the external (&quot;zāhirī&quot;), each having its own order and rules. Although humans are only aware of the outer world, their lives are governed according to the rules of the inner world. This aspect of the Yarsani faith can be identified as Kurdish esoterism which emerged under the intense influence of Bātinī-Sufism.

Among other important pillars of their belief system are that the Divine Essence has successive manifestations in human form (&quot;mazhariyyat&quot;) and the belief in transmigration of the soul (&quot;dunaduni&quot; in Kurdish). Yarasani believe that every man needs to do what is written within their holy book, the Kalâm-e Saranjâm, otherwise they are not part of Yarsan. There is no compulsion or exclusion in Yarsan – anyone who chooses to follow its precepts is welcome.

The Yarsani faith&#x27;s features include millenarism, innatism, egalitarianism, metempsychosis, angelology, divine manifestation and dualism.

===Divine manifestations===
The Yarsani are emanationists and incarnationists, believing that the Divine Essence has successive incarnations known as &quot;mazhariyyats&quot; (similar to the Hindu avatars). They believe God manifests one primary and seven secondary manifestations in each epoch of the world, in either angel or human form. These seven persons are known as &quot;&quot;Heft tan&quot;, which means &quot;The Seven Persons&quot;.

The primary &quot;mazhariyyat&quot; of the First Epoch was the Divine Essence known as Khawandagar, who created the world.

The primary &quot;mazhariyyat&quot; of the Second Epoch was Ali ibn Abi Talib, the fourth caliph and first imam of Shia Islam. This explains the alternative name for Yarsanis Ali-Allahi, &quot;Believers in the divinity of Ali&quot;.

The primary &quot;mazhariyyat&quot; of the Third Epoch was Shah Khoshin. 

In the Fourth Epoch, the primary &quot;mazhariyyat&quot; is held to be Sultan Sahak. It is said that his mother was Dayerak Rezbar or Khatun-e Rezbar, a Kurdish virgin of the Caf tribe. While sleeping under a pomegranate tree a kernel of fruit fell into her mouth when a bird pecked the fruit directly over her. Sources vary on Rezbar’s marital life, some state that she lived her entire life celibate and unmarried while most state that she had married. Sources that claim she had married either contest her husband as being a Kurdish man named &quot;Şêx Îsa&quot; from a priestly line of the Berzencî tribe or an Arab Sayyid man. Whether either of these men even fathered Sahak is also contested among Yarsanis who believe she had married either one of them, as the virgin birth of Sahak is contested by Yarsani scholars though the presumed father or stepfather of Sahak is not regarded as a significant religious figure in Yarsanism.

===Haft Tan or seven persons===
Each Epoch in Yarsani belief saw the appearance of the seven secondary divine manifestations or &quot;Haft Tan&quot;. In the First Epoch they appeared in their true angelic form, while in subsequent Epochs they appeared in human incarnations. The &quot;Haft Tan&quot; are charged with responsibility for the affairs of the internal realm.

The secondary &quot;mazhariyyats&quot; of the First Epoch include the archangels Gabriel, Michael, Israfil and Azrael, and a female angelic being. 

The &quot;mazhariyyats&quot; of the Second Epoch include Salman, Qanbar, Muhammad, Nusayr (who is either Jesus Christ or Theophobus) and Bahlool. It also includes Fatimah, the daughter of Muhammad as the incarnation of the female angel.

The &quot;mazhariyyats&quot; of the Third Epoch include Shah Fazlullah Veli, Baba Sarhang Dudani and Baba Naous.

In the Fourth Epoch, the &quot;Haft Tan&quot; or &#x27;seven persons&#x27; charged by Sultan Sahak with responsibility for the affairs of the inner realm consist of the following:

The &quot;&quot;Haft Tan&quot; (The Seven Archangels) are key figures in the Yarsani belief system and their history. The only female among them is Khatun-e Rezbar, the mother of Sultan Sahak.
# Pir Benjamin, considered the incarnation of the archangel Gabriel; he has the preceptor title to all Yarsanis (Monday)
# Pir Musi, the incarnation of the archangel Michael and known as the Recording angel (Tuesday)
# Mustafā Dawan, the incarnation of archangel Azrael (Wednesday)
# Sultan Sahak, the incarnation of Divine Essence (Thursday)
# Baba Yadegar, also known as &quot;Ahmad&quot; and &quot;Reza&quot; (Friday)
# Khatun-e Razbar (Saturday) 
# Dawud Koswar (David), also informally called Dawu; he is known as &quot;Dalil&quot; (in Kurdish) to all Yarsanis (Sunday)

These seven persons are known as &quot;Haft tan&quot;&quot; which means literally &quot;The Seven Persons&quot;

===Holy texts===
The traditions of the Yarsani are preserved in poetry known as &quot;Kalâm-e Saranjâm&quot; (&quot;The Discourse of Conclusion&quot;), divinely revealed narratives passed down orally through the generations. These traditions are said to have been written down by Pir Musi, one of the seven companions of Sultan Sahak (also the angel in charge of recording human deeds). The collection consists of the epochs of Khawandagar [God], ‘Alī, Shah Khoshin and Sultan Sahak, the different manifestations of divinity. The epoch of Shah Khoshin takes place in Luristan and the epoch of Sultan Sahak is placed in Hawraman near the Sirwan River, the land of the Goranî. Also important to the Goranî is the Daftar-e kezana-ye Perdivari (&quot;Book of the Treasure of Perdivar&quot;), a collection of twenty six mythological poems or &quot;kalams&quot;.

The sayings attributed to Sultan Sahak are written in Gorani Kurdish, the sacred language of the Ahl-e Haqq, which also is known as Hawrami dialects. However, few modern Yarsani can read or write Gorani as their mother tongues are Southern Kurdish and Sorani Kurdish, which belong to the other two branches of the Kurdish language family. Some Yarsani literature is written in the Persian language.

The older texts are called the Perdiwari texts, which date back to around the 15th or 16th centuries. The texts are called Perdiwari since Perdiwar is where Soltan Sahak had first founded the Yarsani community. The Perdiwari texts are attributed to writers from this first community of Yarsani believers. They include the following texts.
*&quot;Dowre-ye Bābā Khoshin&quot;
*&quot;Dowre-ye Bābā Nā’us&quot;
*&quot;Dowre-ye Bohlul&quot;
*&quot;Dowre-ye Bābā Jalil&quot;
*&quot;Bābā Sarhang&quot;
*&quot;Dowre-ye Soltān Sahāk&quot;
*&quot;Kalām-e Ābedin&quot;
*&quot;Kalām-e Ahmad&quot;
*&quot;Daftar-e Dāmyāri&quot;
*&quot;Šandarwi maramo (Kelim wa Duš)&quot;
*&quot;Bārgah Bārgah&quot;
*&quot;Dowre-ye Cheltan&quot;
*&quot;Kamākanān&quot;
*&quot;Zolāl Zolāl&quot;

Widely known non-Perdiwari texts are:
*&quot;Daftar-e Sheykh Amir&quot;
*&quot;Daftar-e Khān Almās&quot;
*&quot;Daftar-e Ābedin Jāf&quot;
*&quot;Daftar-e Ilbegi&quot;
*&quot;Daftar of Qushchioghli&quot;
*Daftars of other members of the group of ‘Twenty-Four Poets’, in Turkic (Azerbaijani)
*&quot;Daftar-e Zu’l-Feqār&quot;
*&quot;Daftar of the Thirty-Six Poets of the Period of Sayyed Brāke&quot;

== Sacred sites ==

Two important sanctuaries of the Yarsani are the tomb of Bābā Yādgār, about 40 km away from Sarpol-e Zahab in Kermanshah Province and the tomb of Dawoud at Zarde, about three kilometres east of Sarpol-e Zahab. Another important shrine is that of Sultan Suhak in Sheykhan, near Perdīvar bridge in Kermanshah Province. The tombs of Pir Benjamin and Pir Musi in the town of Kerend in Kermanshah Province, Iran are also important shrines.

==Organisation==
===Khandans or spiritual houses===
Yarsanism is organised into spiritual houses or Khandans, seven of which were established at the time of Sultan Sahak, and four afterwards, making eleven Khandans in all. The Khandans were established when, along with the &quot;Haft Tan&quot;, Sultan Sahak also formed the &quot;Haft Tawane&quot;, a group of seven holy persons charged with the affairs of the outer world. They were Say-yed Mohammad, Say-yed Abu&#x27;l Wafa, Haji Babusi, Mir Sur, Say-yed Mostafa, Sheykh Shahab al-Din and Sheykh Habib Shah. Each of the &quot;Haft Tawane&quot; was charged with responsibility for the guidance of a number of followers, and these followers formed the original seven Khandans, namely Shah Ebrahim, Baba Yadegar, Ali Qalandar, Khamush, Mir Sur, Sey-yed Mosaffa and Hajji Babu Isa. After Sultan Sahak&#x27;s time another four khandans were established, namely Atesh Bag, Baba Heydar, Zolnour and Shah Hayas.

Every Yarsani therefore belongs to one specific khandan, which is led by a spiritual leader called a say-yed, to whom each member must swear obedience. The say-yed is the spiritual leader of the community and is normally present during the ceremonies attended by the followers. Say-yeds are the only ones allowed to have full access to the religious texts of Yarsanism, and have traditionally competed with each other to have the largest number of followers. The position of Say-yed is hereditary, being passed down through the generations from the original founders. As the say-yed are considered spiritual &#x27;parents&#x27;, it is the tradition for them not to marry their followers.

==Relationship with other religious groups==
An excerpt from the French Review of the Muslim World describes the difficulty in nomenclature for Yarsanism and related Shi&#x27;ite mysticism. The English translation reads:

===Relations with Islam===
&quot;Ahl-e Haqq&quot; view Islam as a product of a cycle of divine essence, which was made manifest in Ali, and established the stage of &quot;shai&#x27;at&quot; (Islamic law). This was followed by the cycle of &quot;tariqat&quot; (Sufi teachings), then &quot;ma&#x27;rifat&quot; (Sufi gnosis), and finally the current cycle of haqiqat (Ultimate Truth), which was made manifest in Sultan Sahak. The final stage supersedes the previous ones, which frees Ahl-e Haqq from observing the shari&#x27;a rules incumbent on Muslims. Ahl-i Haqq class other Muslims as either Ahl-i Tashayyu (followers of Shi&#x27;ism) or Ahl-i Tasannun (followers of Sunnism). The Ahl-i Haqq neither observe Muslim rites, such as daily prayers and fasting during the month of Ramadan, nor share Islamic theology and sacred space, such as belief in the day of resurrection and sanctity of the mosque.

Extremist Sunni Islamic groups, such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and al-Qaeda, regard the followers of Yarsanism as unbelievers who have to convert to Islam or die. These militants have persecuted Yarsanis during the Iraq conflict, possibly prompting some Iraqi Yarsan community leaders to declare in 2013 that their people were actually Muslims to avoid sectarian attacks.

<text>The TI-68 was a scientific pocket/desktop calculator produced by Texas Instruments. It was introduced in 1989 and was modified in 1991 to produce a less expensive and possibly more durable version. The adjacent picture is the later version. It was discontinued in 1997.

A wealth of features made it a versatile calculator. Named variables, and interactive formulas of up to 79 keystrokes, could be stored, subject to a total memory usage of 440 bytes. Some features included a simultaneous equations solver, a polynomial root finder, two-variable statistics, complex numbers, and a recall feature, which would display the last equation entered and its answer. It had several features useful to computer programmers, such as radix modes and conversions and bitset operators. It had an alphanumeric keyboard and display.

It was also offered by Radio Shack as model EC-4044, but in a different color scheme.

<text>John Henry Stelle (August 10, 1891 – July 5, 1962) was an American politician who served as the national commander of The American Legion from 1945 to 1946. He previously served as the 29th governor of Illinois (1940–1941), the 34th lieutenant governor of Illinois (1937–1940), and the Treasurer of Illinois (1935–1937). He was also the chairman of the American Legion Executive Committee that, in six short months, drafted what would become known as the G.I. Bill of Rights and be known during the remainder of his life and in the years since as &quot;The Father of the G.I. Bill&quot;.

== Early life, education, and prewar career ==

Born in McLeansboro, Illinois, Stelle graduated from McLeansboro Township High School, where he played baseball and football. After graduating, Stelle began a career as a professional baseball player. He played for teams in the KITTY (Kentucky-Illinois-Tennessee) League and, briefly, with the Decatur Commodores of the III (Illinois, Iowa, Indiana) League in the 1912 season. Stelle ended his baseball career after the 1913 season. But he would maintain his love of baseball throughout his life and would later be an owner of the St. Louis Browns baseball team. He briefly pursued the purchase of the New York Yankees while serving as Governor of Illinois. Stelle attended Western Military Academy in Alton, Illinois. He also attended the law school at Washington University in St. Louis during the 1914-1915 school year as a special student, after which he returned to McLeansboro, where he read the law under Johnson H. Lane, a prominent local attorney. He was admitted to the Illinois bar on October 16, 1916.

== Service in World War I ==

Stelle enlisted in the U.S. Army on April 17, 1917, eleven days after war was declared. He was wounded at Baccarat, France, while serving with the 77th Infantry Division, and evacuated to an Army hospital in Paris. Stelle recovered from his wounds and returned to serve with 28th and 30th Infantry Divisions in northern France in a series of major battles, including Mount Kemmel, the Somme, and Marne. Stelle rose to the rank of captain during the war and was serving as the commander of Company B of the 315th Machine Gun Battalion (30th Infantry Division) when hostilities ended. Stelle arrived back in the United States with his unit on March 22, 1919, and soon thereafter settled in McLeansboro, where he would maintain a home for the remainder of his life.
== Political career ==
Stelle was a lifelong Democrat although he noticeably split from the party in supporting Everett Dirksen, a Republican, in his run for the Senate in 1950 against the incumbent, Scott Lucas, and Dwight Eisenhower in his two presidential campaigns against a former Illinois governor, Adlai Stevenson. He served as a delegate to most of the Democratic National Conventions from 1928 to 1960. In 1928, Stelle was one of the organizers of the Illinois Democratic Service Men&#x27;s Organization, a group designed to unify members of the Democratic Party who were veterans. The Service Men&#x27;s Organization soon became politically active in the successful 1930 senatorial campaign of James Hamilton Lewis. That race introduced Stelle to many Chicago Democrats, including a young up-and-coming politician, Edward J. Barrett. Barrett and Stelle would remain close friends for the rest of their lives. In the 1930 election, Barrett ran for Illinois state treasurer and Stelle&#x27;s Service Men&#x27;s Organization actively supported him. Barrett won his election and, in 1931, appointed Stelle assistant state 
treasurer. Stelle and his family then moved to Springfield, where they would remain until 1941. Stelle&#x27;s first elected statewide office was as state treasurer from 1935 to 1937. He ran for, and was elected, lieutenant governor in 1936, keeping that job until Horner&#x27;s death almost four years later. Stelle and Horner, in 1936, ran separately but served together. But, despite both being Democrats, they frequently disagreed publicly on issues of the day. Stelle succeeded Horner after Horner&#x27;s unexpected death on Sunday, October 6, 1940. As Horner&#x27;s 99-day successor, Stelle served the second-shortest period in office in Illinois gubernatorial history.

Stelle&#x27;s tenure as lieutenant governor was tumultuous. Horner was ill during most of his second term. He was often out of the public eye after his 1936 re-election. The governor spent significant time in Miami recuperating from what was reported to be a heart condition. During his absences from Illinois, Stelle would serve as the acting governor. In the last year or more of his term, Horner spend much of his time in Springfield in bed, on the second floor of the governor&#x27;s mansion. With the governor in an impaired condition, corruption ran unchecked. The affairs of the state were managed by a &quot;Bedside Cabinet&quot; of Horner lieutenants. A &quot;2% Club&quot; developed whereby the Democratic Party assessed a two percent charge on the checks of state payrollers. Stelle became openly hostile to the Bedside Cabinet, the 2% Club, and the other abuses and corruption of the Horner administration.

When the Democratic Party slated its candidates for the 1940 election, and knowing that Horner would not be able to run again, Stelle was offered another run as lieutenant governor. He made it very clear publicly that he would run for governor or not run at all. After being denied the governor slot on the Democratic ticket, Stelle, Barrett, and Benjamin Adamowski, another Chicago politician, split with the Horner and Chicago&#x27;s Kelly-Nash Machine and launched a maverick campaign in the 1940 Democratic primary. They all lost their races (Stelle ran for governor in the primary) but the result was that the Democratic Party in Illinois was split in the 1940 and 1944 statewide elections and Republicans swept every statewide office in both. Stelle&#x27;s split with the Kelly-Nash Machine in 1940 effectively ended it as a power broker in Illinois statewide politics. Stelle was a powerful downstate politician and, with his Democratic Service Men&#x27;s Organization, his prominence in the American Legion, and his solid political support in the downstate counties, he could exert a powerful influence on statewide election results. Stelle, despite numerous efforts to draft him to run for office after his 1940 primary defeat (he was touted as a candidate for both the United States House of Representatives and the Senate in the years after he left office), never again served in either an elective or appointed office in Illinois. During World War II, Stelle would utilize his political skills, as well as his prominence in the Legion, to usher the G.I. Bill of Rights through Congress and to President Roosevelt&#x27;s desk on June 22, 1944.

== Governor of Illinois (1940-1941) ==
Stelle, upon losing his Democratic primary race for governor, moved his family back to McLeansboro in August 1940. He had a farm in Hamilton County and was busy that fall drilling wheat. In October 1940, when he heard Horner&#x27;s health had taken a turn for the worse, he naturally assumed Horner would rally and recover has he had so many times before during his second term. But Horner did not; he died on Sunday, October 6, 1940. Stelle deferred moving his family back to Springfield and the governor&#x27;s mansion until well after Horner&#x27;s funeral. The governor&#x27;s mansion had devolved during Horner&#x27;s long absences and the periods during which he was bedridden into a &quot;club&quot; with political cronies using it day and night as a respite; drinking and cigar smoking occurred on a daily basis on the first floor of the mansion while Horner was bedridden in the governor&#x27;s quarters upstairs. As a result, the mansion&#x27;s staff often complained of the increased demands being placed on them. The mansion as a result of years of abuse, which accelerated during Horner&#x27;s terms, fell into disrepair and was, by Horner&#x27;s death, badly in need of redecorating. As one of Stelle&#x27;s sons, Russell (who lived in the governor&#x27;s mansion with his parents) later recalled, &quot;it was a dump.&quot; Stelle directed the rooms housing the Lincoln Library be redecorated. Many nights during Stelle&#x27;s ninety-nine-day tenure, which spanned the holiday season in 1940, the mansion was &quot;lit up like a Christmas tree,&quot; as thirty to forty guests were often entertained at one time, a number of them friends from Southern Illinois and Springfield. Horner, a bachelor, had rarely entertained at the mansion during his eight year tenancy - especially so during his second term - so the change Stelle and his family brought was a welcome one in Springfield. The new governor&#x27;s social agenda at the mansion involved no overspending as the entertainment budget had scarcely been touched during Horner&#x27;s long illness and his repeated absences from Springfield. Notwithstanding his new quarters, Stelle continued his practice, developed over his many years of owning and managing a farm, of rising early every morning, He would typically have breakfast in the company of the mansion&#x27;s staff.

Eight days after Horner&#x27;s death, Stelle declared an end to Horner&#x27;s 2% Club. He also make it clear that Horner&#x27;s Bedside Cabinet would no longer manage the state. But he did not fire all of the members of the Bedside Cabinet; several remained state employees until the end of Stelle&#x27;s term. Stelle made changes to some state directorships but his appointments were generally completed within a month of Horner&#x27;s death; the state had an election coming up on November 5, 1940, and mass firings of state workers would have been a distraction. Horner had appointed thousands of individuals during his eight years in office. Most of those appointees were going to be terminated at the end of Stelle&#x27;s term (the Republican Party swept all the statewide offices in 1940 including the governorship and had its own appointments to make). While Stelle replaced some department heads within the government, his changes were modest, especially compared to the thousands appointed by Horner. There is no empirical evidence that Stelle&#x27;s appointments involved more than a couple of hundred individuals out of a total state payroll at the time of more than almost 25,000. As Governor, Stelle had the prerogative to appoint men and women loyal to him, even if the appointments were likely to be only for the remainder of his short term.

Stelle appointed George Edward Day, a close friend, state purchasing agent. Day, a paint dealer from Springfield, was uniquely suited to address a particular obsession of the new governor&#x27;s: the painting of yellow lines on highways to indicate no passing zones. Day bought vast quantities of yellow paint from a company in Springfield he owned, on a no-bid basis, and the traffic safety measure was instituted. But the appointment of Day and the purchase of the yellow paint were perhaps the most controversial decisions of Stelle&#x27;s short term. Stelle ignored the criticism by famously saying he did not care what the press said about him as long as they spelled his name correctly. Illinois thus became the first state in the nation to mark no passing zones on its public thoroughfares (Minnesota was the first to stripe the centerline of the highway but did not designate no passing zones). The decision by Stelle to institute a program of marking highways and designating no passing zones no doubt saved thousands of lives over the years to follow. Furthermore, the purchase of a large quantity of yellow paint proved to be a windfall for the state: during World War II, states were emulating Stelle&#x27;s highway innovation and yellow paint was both in short supply and expensive. Illinois had a surplus of yellow paint left over from Stelle&#x27;s term which it then sold to other states at an unintended profit. Stelle had the mansion repainted as well, at a cost of $1,900 (approximately $33,770 in current dollars). The governor&#x27;s mansion had deteriorated during Horner&#x27;s terms and repainting it was long overdue. But Stelle&#x27;s decision to undertake a modest redecorating of the governor&#x27;s mansion was attacked by his critics as a needless expense for a governor whose term was going to end in less than a hundred days. After his ninety-nine day term was over, Stelle handed the reins of state government over to his successor, Dwight H. Green, a Republican. Stelle would never serve in a government position in Illinois again.

Stelle denounced appeasement as American involvement in World War II drew closer. With the Illinois National Guard mobilized for federal service, the governor established a reserve militia in its place. He based his plan on a novel interpretation of a statute enacted in 1917, at the outset of World War I. Stelle&#x27;s plan was for the militia to be available to the governor in the event of an emergency; with the Illinois National Guard mobilized, and able bodied men being drafted, the state had no military establishment to respond to crisis. An emergency defense council was put into place, draft boards were appointed, and hundreds of honorary commissions handed out, mostly to veterans who had served previously. Stelle&#x27;s militia would prove invaluable during World War II in filling the void left by the departure of thousands of Guardsmen and civilians to the military.

== Portraits ==

Stelle&#x27;s portrait may be found in the Hall of Governors on the second floor of the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois. Since Stelle was elected lieutenant governor and served until Horner&#x27;s death, his portrait also hangs in Room 409 of the State Capitol with those of other lieutenant governors. Stelle is one of the few Illinois politicians to have two portraits in the state capitol for having served as both the governor and lieutenant governor of the state. Stelle&#x27;s portraits were controversial when they were painted. The governor&#x27;s portrait was the work of a Chicago painter, Leonard Seyffert. Seyffert charged the State $1,000 for the painting, an enormous sum in 1940. Stelle had to approve the painting which he ultimately did after some hesitation. Then the painting was lost for several years. It was found in 1944, four years after Stelle left office, in a closet in the state capitol and was hung later that year. Stelle&#x27;s lieutenant governor portrait, which was half the size of his governor&#x27;s portrait, cost $500, a large sum at the time. Stelle rejected it out of hand and a second portrait was then commissioned and painted. The second portrait is the one which now hangs on the fourth floor of the state capitol; it cost the state $850 and was immediately the subject of statewide criticism because of what was perceived to be an extravagant expense. Approval of the bill submitted by the artist for Stelle&#x27;s portrait was delayed in the Republican legislature with the result that Stelle&#x27;s lieutenant governor portrait was not hung until 1947, seven years after he left office. Stelle thus had three portraits painted at state expense, two of which are hanging today in the state capitol.

== Father of the G.I. Bill of Rights ==

Stelle&#x27;s fervent devotion to the military and the men and women serving during World War II was genuine. Both his sons were officers in the Army during World War II and participated in the D-Day invasion. One of Stelle&#x27;s sons, John Albert Stelle, was seriously wounded at Saint Lo a few days after participating in the invasion. John Albert, a Captain in the Infantry who served in both North Africa and Europe, wrote his parents often. In one of his letters prior to D-Day, he wrote, in referring to the hopes and aspirations of the men in his company: &quot;All they want is an opportunity from their government to make good when they return..an opportunity to get an education or training and to find work.&quot; The letters from John Albert proved to be the genesis of what would become the Servicemen&#x27;s Readjustment Act of 1944. Stelle became motivated to campaign for benefits for the millions of returning veterans after World War II through his involvement in the American Legion. Stelle had been active member of the Legion since its formative St. Louis Caucus in May 1919, Through the Legion and the Democratic Service Men&#x27;s Organization, he maintained a close relationship with veterans not just in Illinois but throughout the United States. Following his return to the private sector in 1941, Stelle&#x27;s involvement in the American Legion led to his being appointed chairman of its G.I. Bill Executive Committee. Stelle was an ideal choice for the role as chairman. He was a former Democratic Governor of one of the largest states in the country. Control of both houses of Congress and the Presidency were held by Democrats. Stelle had attended numerous Democratic National Conventions during his political career and was on a first name basis with most of the prominent Democrats in the federal government. He gave the committee credibility with the Washington establishment. As chairman, he oversaw the drafting and ultimate passage of the Servicemen&#x27;s Readjustment Act of 1944, better known as the G.I. Bill of Rights, including its steerage through Congress to the President&#x27;s desk. His success in that effort through the Legion was rewarded after the war. In 1945, Stelle was elected National Commander of the American Legion, the organization&#x27;s top post, in recognition of his role in getting the G.I. Bill enacted. In that role, he would oversee the implementation of the G.I. Bill as the veterans returned home after World War II.

He soon became known as &quot;The Father of the G.I. Bill&quot;, and that term stuck for the rest of his life. In 2004, the Education Commission of the States awarded Stelle its James Bryant Conant Award posthumously. The Award, which the commission awards annually, is given for outstanding service to education. According to his citation: &quot;Stelle, a World War I veteran and past national commander of The American Legion, quarterbacked a team of Legion officials that, in the space of just six months, designed and put forth the main features of the GI Bill, organized massive public support and shepherded its successful passage through Congress. Stelle&#x27;s leadership and behind-the-scenes negotiating skills are widely credited for the legislation&#x27;s surviving stubborn pockets of resistance, intense debate and a conference committee deadlock that nearly scuttled the bill at the 11th hour.&quot; His role in getting the G.I. Bill formulated and passed was Stelle&#x27;s greatest political achievement and gave him a national prominence. He managed, during the course of a year in Washington D.C., to get drafted and passed what one Senator has called &quot;the best single investment the federal government has ever made.&quot;

== American Legion ==

Stelle attended the St. Louis Caucus in early May, 1919, at which hundreds of veterans of World War I established the American Legion; he would remain active in the Legion until his death in 1962. Stelle was unanimously elected as National Commander of the American Legion at the organization&#x27;s National Convention in Chicago on November 18, 1945. World War II had just ended and veterans were returning home in mass. The election of Stelle was a recognition of his role in making the G.I. Bill a reality. The position of National Commander is largely ceremonial but Stelle used his term as a platform to advocate for a quick implementation of the G.I. Bill&#x27;s programs. Truman had appointed Omar Bradley as the first head of the Veteran&#x27;s Administration, the agency charged with administering all the veteran&#x27;s programs and benefits. Stelle, never one to back down from a fight, openly criticized Bradley, a national hero and former five star general, for VA&#x27;s slow implementation of the G.I. Bill&#x27;s programs. He was especially critical of the VA&#x27;s treatment of injured and handicapped veterans in its hospitals. The sparing between Stelle and Bradley continued for several months and generated national headlines. Some legionnaires even suggested ending Stelle&#x27;s term at National Commander early. The two men met in Washington, D.C. on February 27, 1946, and appeared to agree on a truce while the VA mobilized its healthcare resources for veterans. But the accord was fragile and Stelle, as his one-year term neared its end later that year, began criticizing Bradley publicly again for his poor administration of the agency. Bradley would last another year as head of the VA but would leave the agency in November 1947 to become Chief of Staff of the Army and Stelle would serve out the remainder of his term as National Commander. But veterans throughout the United States appreciated having an advocate for their benefits under the G.I. Bill and the episode, while certainly controversial, elevated Stelle&#x27;s national profile.

== Later life ==
Stelle was entrepreneurial his entire life. In the 1920s, he purchased the Haw Creek Creamery in McLeansboro. He also owned a farm a few miles east of McLeansboro where he raised thoroughbred race horses and maintained a sizable dairy herd. Milk from the farm was sold at his creamery and elsewhere in southern Illinois. The Stelle Farm, as it would be called during his lifetime, was one of Stelle&#x27;s passions and, by the late-1940s had grown in size to more than a thousand acres. More than a hundred horses were housed at the Stelle Farm at the time of his death.

Stelle also acquired Shale Products Company in McLeansboro prior to entering statewide politics in the 1930s. The company introduced him to the production of tile products (Shale Products produced a line of hollow tile used for drainage applications) which he leveraged, between 1934 and 1936, into ownership of Clay Products in Brazil, Indiana. He would soon change the name of that enterprise to Arketex Ceramic Corporation. Arketex manufactured structural glazed tile which it sold throughout the United States and Canada. By the time of his death in 1962, Stelle had grown Arketex to more than a thousand employees working in four plants in the Brazil area.

Stelle was an early supporter of, and participant in, the oil boom which southern Illinois (known as &quot;Little Egypt&quot;) experienced during the 1930s. He often clashed with Horner on the regulation of the state&#x27;s nascent oil industry. Stelle acquired mineral rights in the oil rich areas of southeastern Illinois and would remain active in oil drilling and production until his death. He drilled several wells on the Stelle Farm which were moderately successful.

Stelle organized an investor group and built Cahokia Downs Race Track in Alorton, Illinois, just east of St. Louis. Cahokia Downs opened in 1954 and offered night time racing (a unique innovation at the time) to the St. Louis area for many years after Stelle&#x27;s death. Stelle served as the president of Cahokia Downs from its opening until his death. His myriad business interests made Stelle a wealthy man and, beginning in the years immediately following World War II, Stelle and his wife began spending winters at their Star Island estate in Miami Beach. They would return every spring to the Stelle Farm, which became a showcase of sorts in Little Egypt. Stelle was a rare politician who was able to transition successfully after his public life ended into a very successful, multi-faceted, business career.

==Stelle Farm ==

The Stelle home, on the Stelle Farm, one of the more notable buildings in Hamilton County. It was located a few miles east of McLeansboro. It caught fire and burned down in 2005 (under suspicious circumstances), destroying one of the last remnants of Stelle&#x27;s life. The house had originally been built by General James Romulus Campbell, a veteran of the Spanish American War. General Campbell used the property to introduce Percheron horses to Hamilton County. Shortly after returning from France after the war, Stelle purchased the Campbell farm with the house he would own until his death in 1962. Stelle purchased the property in the 1920s, shortly after the death of General Campbell. He continued the breeding operations on the farm and soon expanded the house. Over the years, Stelle made numerous improvements and expansions of the house so that, by his death, it had six bedrooms, five bathrooms, and a sleeping porch which could accommodate eight people on four full-size beds. McLeansboro had limited accommodations for travelers during the years when the Stelles lived there with the result that the Stelle home often hosted visitors who stopped by to meet with Stelle. Many rich and famous personalities and politicians stopped by the Stelle Farm and stayed at the Stelle home during Stelle&#x27;s lifetime. With its imposing columns and portico, the house had a magnificent &quot;Tara-like&quot; appearance and the Stelle Farm and home became a showcase in southern Illinois during the 1940s and 1950s. At the time of the fire in 2005, the house had been vacant for many years and was in poor condition. Another home occupied by Stelle, at 900 Washington Street in McLeansboro, remains standing in essentially the same state as it did during World War I when his wife, Wilma, and son, John Albert, lived there.

== Support of John F. Kennedy in 1960 ==

Stelle actively supported Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican, in the 1952 and 1956 Presidential elections. But he returned to the Democratic Party as the 1960 Presidential primaries approached. After being an early supporter of Missouri Senator Stuart Symington, Stelle threw his support to John F. Kennedy. Stelle, as a former governor and National Commander of the American Legion, still had significant political currency in Little Egypt. In October 1960, Stelle organized a fourteen stop &quot;tour&quot; for Kennedy which began in Belleville, southeast of St. Louis, and ended fifty miles southeast at Herrin four days later. Kennedy drew enormous crowds at each stop and credited Stelle with mobilizing support for him in southern Illinois. Stelle said his inspiration for the Kennedy tour was Truman&#x27;s &quot;whistle stop&quot; campaign in 1948. Kennedy would later credit Stelle with his hair&#x27;s breath (11,000 vote) win in Illinois, a pivotal state in 1960, which, in turn, made his narrow victory in the national election possible. During the summer of 1961, Kennedy hosted Stelle and his staff of volunteers to a week-long visit to Washington, D.C.. On August 1, 1961, the group, approximately twenty in number, visited Kennedy in the Oval Office. During the visit that day, Kennedy again expressed his gratitude to Stelle for his efforts in mobilizing the southern Illinois vote, a critical component in Kennedy&#x27;s narrow victory in the state. The Illinois victory, in turn, allowed Kennedy to win a very close national election.

== Death ==

John Henry Stelle died on July 7, 1962, at Barnes Hospital, in St. Louis, shortly after he was diagnosed with acute leukemia. Upon his death, Stelle&#x27;s body was taken back to McLeansboro for a funeral conducted by the Gholson Funeral Home. Gholson&#x27;s quickly overflowed with the crowd, which numbered in the hundreds and included many dignitaries including the governor and lieutenant governor of the state. Gholson&#x27;s counted over four hundred floral arrangements at Stelle&#x27;s funeral, the most of any funeral in McLeansboro&#x27;s history. Judge John Marshall Kames of East St. Louis delivered a lengthy eulogy which noted Stelle &quot;was perhaps the best and most accomplished political organizer this state has known&quot;. Later in his eulogy, Kames summed up Stelle&#x27;s life: &quot;Farm boy to Governor, professional ball player, soldier, lawyer, treasurer of our state, Lieutenant Governor, big businessman, farmer, one of the organizers of and National Commander of the American Legion: that is the record of our departed friend to whose immediate memory we pay tribute and respect today.&quot; Stelle was laid to rest in McLeansboro&#x27;s Odd Fellows Cemetery, a few miles east of Gholson&#x27;s, under a magnificent oak and less than a mile from the Stelle Farm he loved so much. His wife, Wilma, survived him. She died on November 18, 1968, and was buried next to Stelle.

== James Bryant Conant Award ==

In 2004, more than forty years after his death, Stelle was awarded the James Bryant Conant Award from the Education Commission of the States in recognition of his pivotal role in getting the Servicemen&#x27;s Readjustment Act of 1944 drafted and passed by Congress and signed by Roosevelt. In presenting the award, the commission recognized the G.I. Bill, as the act became known, &quot;transformed the landscape of American higher education by offering veterans money to attend college.&quot; The award confirmed that, thanks to Stelle&#x27;s efforts, the dream of receiving a college degree was no longer limited to members of the upper class. It also noted: &quot;Stelle&#x27;s leadership and behind-the-scenes negotiating skills are widely credited for the legislation&#x27;s surviving stubborn pockets of resistance, intense debate and a conference committee deadlock that nearly scuttled the bill at the 11th hour.&quot; The award confirmed that Stelle had more than earned the title bestowed on him over the years after the passage of the act as &quot;the Father of the G.I. Bill&quot;. The revolutionary enactment changed the American cultural landscape after World War II by creating a massive middle class that continues to this day.

<text>José Tanig Joya (June 3, 1931 – May 11, 1995) was a Filipino abstract artist and a National Artist of the Philippines awardee. 
Joya was a printmaker, painter, mixed media artist, and former dean of the University of the Philippines&#x27; College of Fine Arts. He pioneered abstract expressionism in the Philippines. His canvases were characterized by &quot;dynamic spontaneity&quot; and &quot;quick gestures&quot; in action painting. He is the creator of compositions that were described as &quot;vigorous compositions&quot; of heavy impastoes, bold brushstrokes, controlled dips, and diagonal swipes&quot;. Joya added the brilliant tropical colors. He was awarded a grant, which enabled him to pursue a master&#x27;s degree in Fine Arts in 1956–57.
His works were strongly influenced by the tropical landscapes of the Philippine Islands. Among his masterpieces are the &quot;Nanking&quot; (a collage rendered with Asian calligraphy and forms and patterns resembling rice paddies), the Granadean Arabesque (1958) and Biennial (1964)

<text>Loch Rannoch () is a freshwater loch in Perth and Kinross, Scotland. It is over long in a west–east direction with an average width of about , and is deepest at its eastern end, reaching a depth of . The River Tummel begins at its eastern end, where the small village of Kinloch Rannoch can be found, whilst the wild expanse of Rannoch Moor extends to the west of the loch. The area surrounding Loch Rannoch, along with Rannoch Moor itself, was formerly part of the native Caledonian Forest that stretched across much of Northern Scotland. Native forest is now largely absent from much of the area, due partly to logging, and partly to the climate becoming wetter, and Loch Rannoch is now largely surrounded by commercial forestry and open hillsides, although a small area remains at the Black Wood of Rannoch on the southern shore of the loch.

Loch Rannoch forms part of the Loch Rannoch and Glen Lyon National Scenic Area, one of 40 such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development by restricting certain forms of development.

==Tourism==
The surrounding area has many attractions, which can be found on the Rannoch and Tummel Tourist Association site which has information about the glen. The loch offers good sport fishing, with brown and ferox trout, arctic charr, pike and perch all present, although there are no salmon in the loch. Fishing is managed by the Loch Rannoch Conservation Association, which issues permits and control catches in accordance with the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 2003.

Areas of forestry around Loch Rannoch owned by Forestry and Land Scotland (FLS) form part of the Tay Forest Park, a network of FLS forests spread across the Highland parts of Perthshire that are managed to provide walks and amenities for visitors.

==Historical sites==

A crannog is present at Eilean nam Faoileag in the western half of the loch. A folly was constructed on the island in the nineteenth century, reputedly by a Baron Granbley. The folly, which is still standing, takes the form of a tower, and may be based on the design of a small island prison. There may also be crannog at Eilean Beal na Gaoire at the very western end of the loch, however the level of the loch has been raised causing the island to become submerged, and so its status as a crannog was regarded as uncertain when surveyed in 1969.

Mary, Queen of Scots, who was in Glen Tilt, wrote to Colin Campbell of Glenorchy on 3 August 1564, asking him to demolish a house of strength on an island in the loch. The Clan Macdonald of Clanranald were rebuilding the house, which her father James V had previously ordered to be demolished.

==Transport==
The historic route of the Road to the Isles went along Loch Rannoch as part of the route between Pitlochry on the main Stirling to Inverness road, and Lochaber, and Loch Rannoch is one of the places mentioned in the Scottish folk song named after the road. The road is now classified as the B846, which runs along the north shore of the loch. The road terminates at Rannoch railway station on the West Highland Line, some west of Loch Rannoch. The route of the Road to the Isles continues only as an untarmaced track from here to the west.

==Hydro-electricity==
Rannoch Power Station, on the northern shore of the loch, is part of the Tummel hydro-electric power scheme, which is operated by SSE. The power station has a vertical head of and a total generating capacity of 44 MW, and uses water fed by pipeline and tunnel from Loch Ericht which is discharged into Loch Rannoch.

==Black Wood of Rannoch==
The Black Wood of Rannoch, a fragment of the former Caledonian Forest, lies on the southern shore of Loch Rannoch. It is designated as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC), and is the largest remaining area of Caledonian Forest in Perth and Kinross. The forest supports a number of rare plants including species such as coralroot &quot;Corallorhiza trifida&quot; and serrated wintergreen &quot;Orthilia secunda&quot;. It also supports populations of Scottish crossbill and capercaillie.

The Black Wood of Rannoch had been used to provide timber for nearly 200 years, and during the Great War, there were plans to fell it completely. The wood has been owned and managed by the Forestry Commission and its successor body, Forestry and Land Scotland (FLS), since 1947. FLS manage the wood as a forest reserve as well as to provide Scots pine seeds for use in regeneration projects across Scotland.

<text>A phot (ph) is a photometric unit of illuminance, or luminous flux through an area. It is not an SI unit but rather is associated with the older centimetre–gram–second system of units. The name was coined by André Blondel in 1921.

Metric equivalence:

:formula_1

Metric dimensions:

:Illuminance = luminous intensity × solid angle / length2

<doc id="788346" wikidata="Q1501584" url="?curid=788346" title="General Electric GEnx">
<text>The General Electric GEnx (&quot;General Electric Next-generation&quot;) is an advanced dual rotor, axial flow, high-bypass turbofan jet engine in production by GE Aerospace for the Boeing 747-8 and 787. The GEnx succeeded the CF6 in GE&#x27;s product line.

==Development==
As of 2016, the GEnx and the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 were selected by Boeing following a run-off between the three big engine manufacturers. The GEnx uses some technology from the GE90 turbofan, including swept composite fan blades and the 10-stage high-pressure compressor (HPC) featured in earlier variants of the engine. The engine carries composite technology into the fan case.

The engine market for the 787 is estimated at US$40 billion over the next 25 years. A first is the elimination of bleed air systems using high temperature/high pressure air from the propulsion engines to power aircraft systems such as the starting, air-conditioning and anti-ice systems. Both engines enable the move towards the &quot;More Electric Aircraft&quot;, that is, the concept of replacing previously hydraulic and pneumatic systems with electrical ones to reduce weight, increase efficiency, and reduce maintenance requirements.

The GEnx was expected to produce thrust from with first tests commencing in 2006 and service entry by 2008 (delayed by 787 deliveries). Boeing predicts reduced fuel consumption of up to 20% and significantly quieter engines than current turbofans. A thrust version (GEnx-2B67) will be used on the 747-8. Unlike the initial version for the 787, this version has a traditional bleed air system to power internal pneumatic and ventilation systems. It will also have a smaller overall diameter than the initial model to accommodate installation on the 747.

In March 2006 General Electric began initial test runs of the bleedless GEnx variant. The first flight with one of these engines took place on 22 February 2007, using a Boeing 747-100, fitted with one GEnx engine in the number 2 (inboard left hand side) position.

By fall 2019, General Electric was offering the GEnx-2B, developed for the 747-8, for the revised 767-XF variant based on the 767-400ER, but needed enough volume to cover the new product certification.

==Operational history==
Introduced in late 2011 on a 747-8 freighter, Cargolux surpassed one million flight hours in early 2017.

On July 28, 2012, the NTSB initiated an investigation of an engine failure that occurred on a Boeing 787 during a pre-delivery taxi test in Charleston, South Carolina.

On August 31, 2012, a GEnx-1B engine installed on a Boeing 787 that had not yet flown was found to have an indication of a similar crack on the fan midshaft. The fan midshaft was removed from the engine for further inspection and examination. As a result of investigative work the NTSB has determined that the fan midshafts on the GEnx engines fractured or cracked at the forward end of the shaft where the retaining nut is installed.

On September 11, 2012, an AirBridgeCargo 747-8F experienced a major engine malfunction that spread a significant amount of metallic debris on the runway when the low-pressure turbine shaft separated and shifted backwards, damaging the low pressure turbine blades and vanes. The NTSB issued urgent safety recommendations to the FAA to require ultrasonic scans for midshaft fractures before use of GEnx engines and require repetitive on-wing inspections of the engine to detect cracks.

During the spring and summer of 2013, GE learned of four 747-8F freighters that suffered icing in their engines at altitudes of and above. The most serious incident involved an AirBridgeCargo freighter; on July 31, while at an altitude of over China, the flight crew noted two engines surging while a third lost substantial power. The pilots were able to land the plane safely but the engines were found to have sustained damage. Among the possible factors cited was &quot;&#x27;unique convective weather systems&#x27; such as unusually large thunderstorms reaching high altitudes.&quot; Boeing is working with GE on software solutions to the problem. Altitude was restricted until GE changed the software to detect the high-altitude ice crystals and open bleed air valve doors to eject them before they enter the core.

In March 2014, a GEnx-powered Boeing 787 had its first in-flight shut down in operation when a JAL flight had to divert to Honolulu after an oil pressure alert, bringing its in-flight shut down rate to 1 per ,000 hours.
In January 2016 a Japan Airlines 787 had an inflight shutdown after flying through icing conditions, caused by ice formed on fan blades and ingested: the blades moved forward slightly and rubbed on the abradable seal in the casing. In March 2016, the US FAA ordered emergency fixes on the GEnx-1B PIP2. The airworthiness directive affects 43 Boeing 787 Dreamliners in the US. Abradable material in the casing in front of the fan blades was ground to keep them from rubbing when ingesting ice or debris on 330 GEnx PIP-2.

In early 2018, of 1,277 orders for the Boeing 787, 681 selected the GEnx (%), 420 the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 (%) and 176 were undecided (%).
The 2,000th GEnx was delivered by November 2019, 15 years after the engine launch, as it logged 4.5 million flight cycles and 26 million hours among 60 operators.

==Design==

The GEnx is derived from the GE90 with a fan diameter of for the 787 and for the 747-8.
To reduce weight, it features 18 composite fan blades, a composite fan case and titanium aluminide stage 6 and 7 low-pressure turbine blades.
Fuel efficiency is improved by 15% compared to the CF6, the bypass ratio reaches up to 9.0:1 and the overall pressure ratio up to 58.1:1.
It has a 10 stage high-pressure compressor and is quieter, helped by larger, more efficient fan blades.

It stays on wing 20% longer, uses 30% fewer parts to lower maintenance costs and has a contra-rotating architecture.
The Lean combustor reduces NOx gases with required pressure loss and backflow margin.
Fan blades have steel alloy leading edges and the composite fan case reduces thermal expansion.
To reduce fuel burn, the 23:1 pressure ratio high-pressure compressor is based on the GE90-94B, shrouded guide vanes reduce secondary flows and counter-rotating spools for the reaction turbines reduce load on guide vanes.

To reduce maintenance cost and increase engine life, spools with lower parts count are achieved by using blisks in some stages, low blade counts in other stages and by using fewer stages; internal engine temperatures are reduced due to more efficient cooling techniques and debris extraction within the low-pressure compressor protects the high-pressure compressor.

<text>Absente is a brand name of 110 proof anise liqueur that has been marketed under the tagline &quot;Absinthe Refined&quot; since c. 2000. &quot;Absente&quot; is a French word that translates as &quot;absent&quot; in English.

==In the U.S.==

Prior to 2009, Absente sold in the U.S. contained no grande wormwood (&quot;Artemisia absinthium&quot;), the essential herb from which absinthe derives its name. The maker substituted southernwood (&quot;Artemisia abrotanum&quot;) and the product was bottled with sugar, two critical aspects that differentiated Absente as an anise liqueur and not an absinthe by any traditional reference. The ingredients of Absente are listed in order as alcohol, sugar, a combination of &quot;essences&quot;, infusions and distillates, and two artificial dyes, FD&amp;C Yellow #5 and Blue #1.

Absente&#x27;s U.S. marketing effort had long sought to associate the liqueur with traditional absinthe through statements such as, &quot;&quot;The only difference is we replaced Wormwood...with a less bitter cousin called Southern-Wormwood, also known as &quot;Petite Absinthe,&quot; which allows us to offer Absente in the United States.&quot;&quot; The reference to &quot;petite absinthe&quot; is inaccurate, as &quot;petite absinthe&quot; refers invariably to &#x27;Roman wormwood&#x27; (&quot;Artemisia pontica&quot;) throughout credible distillation treatises, while &#x27;southernwood&#x27; is historically referred to as &quot;aurone&quot;, &quot;abrotone&quot;, or &quot;armoise citronelle&quot;, and is scarcely ever mentioned, if at all. At that time, Absente&#x27;s website explained, &quot;&quot;By maintaining a form of wormwood in Absente, we are able to truly call Absente a modern Absinthe&quot;.&quot;

Following the re-legalization of genuine absinthe in the U.S. in 2007, the North American importer introduced a reformulated version that includes grande wormwood (April, 2009) in an apparent effort to improve its consumer appeal. The new label proclaims, &quot;Now With Wormwood!&quot;. Since 2016 it has been marketed as “traditional absinthe with wormwood”

==In Europe==
The version marketed in Europe under the same name is and has always been made with &quot;essence of grande wormwood&quot; (&quot;Artemisia absinthium&quot;). The label design differs mildly from the U.S. version by having &quot;Liqueur aux Plantes d&#x27;Absinthe&quot; above the main label and a silver capsule.

<text>Loch Lochy () is a large freshwater loch in Lochaber, Highland, Scotland. With a mean depth of , it is the third-deepest loch of Scotland.

==Geography==
Located southwest of Loch Ness along the Great Glen, the loch is over long with an average width of about . The River Lochy flows from its southwestern end while the Caledonian Canal links its northeastern extent to Loch Oich.

Loch Lochy should not be confused with Loch Loch, which lies to the east of Beinn a&#x27; Ghlò.

==History==
The Battle of the Shirts was fought at its northern end near Laggan in July 1544, between Clan Donald and Clan Fraser.

The Stand-off at the Fords of Arkaig in September 1665 ended a 360-year feud between the Camerons and the Chattan Confederation. It took place at Achnacarry, on the isthmus between Loch Lochy and Loch Arkaig.

Folklore tales mention a supernatural being called the River Horse which was said to emerge from the lake and assume a horse&#x27;s shape before feeding on the loch&#x27;s banks. The River Horse was also known as the Lord of the Lake and the Water King and would overturn boats and &quot;entice mares from their pastures&quot;. Another tradition was that of the River Bull, &quot;a gentle, harmless creature&quot;, who would &quot;emerge from the lake into the pasture of cows&quot;.

<text>The minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour () is the minister of the Crown in the Canadian Cabinet who is responsible for Employment and Social Development Canada, the Government of Canada department that oversees programs such as employment insurance, the Canada pension plan, old age security, and Canada student loans.

== History ==
The ministerial responsibility for employment has its origins in the October 1, 1966 cabinet reshuffle, when Jean Marchand&#x27;s portfolio was renamed from Minister of Immigration and Citizenship to Minister of Manpower and Immigration, Along with this change, minister Marchand was tasked by Prime Minister Lester Pearson to draft a White paper to renew Canada&#x27;s immigration policy. Pearson wanted to removed all discriminatory clauses remaining in Canada&#x27;s immigration regulations, and instead facilitate the immigration of qualified workers from Asia.

The following year, Canada introduced its first point system to rank potential immigrants for eligibility. It originally consisted of 9 categories: education, occupation, professional skills, age, arranged employment, knowledge of English and/or French, relatives in Canada and &quot;personal characteristics&quot;. To qualify for immigration 50 points out of 100 were necessary in 1967.

In 1977, the portfolio was renamed Minister of Employment and Immigration, a move that reflected the importance of attracting and retaining economic immigrants for Canadian governments in the 1980s and 1990s.

On 12 July 1996, the office of the Minister of Employment and Immigration was abolished and replaced with the office of Minister of Human Resources Development. The portfolio for immigration was transferred to the office of Minister of Citizenship and Immigration following the reorganization of the government and formation of the department for Citizenship and Immigration Canada.

On February 6, 2006, Prime Minister Stephen Harper transferred the responsibilities of the Minister of Social Development into this portfolio. Although the legislated names did not change, in accordance with this amalgamation the Minister was for a while styled the &quot;Minister of Human Resources and Social Development&quot; and the department operated as &quot;Human Resources and Social Development Canada&quot;. This ceased on October 30, 2008, and the name returned to the legislated one.

In 2015, the Employment portfolio was merged into the expanded ministry of &quot;Employment, Workforce Development and Labour&quot;.

In 2019, following the 2019 Canadian federal election, the portfolio was split between the Minister of Labour and Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, with Carla Qualtrough being appointed the new minister on November 20.

In 2023, the Official Languages portfolio was merged into the expanded ministry of &quot;Employment, Workforce Development and Official Languages&quot;, with Randy Boissonnault being appointed the new minister on July 26, 2023.

In 2024, responsibility for labour was folded back into the portfolio while responsibility for official languages was split off; consequently, the position reverted to its former title of Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour, with incumbent Labour minister Steven MacKinnon being appointed to the post.

<text>Berdiansk or Berdyansk (, ; , ) is a port city in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, south-eastern Ukraine. It is on the northern coast of the Sea of Azov, which is connected to the Black Sea. It serves as the administrative center of Berdiansk Raion. The city is named after the &#x27;s , at the foot of which it is located. Its population is 

Berdiansk is home to a safari zoo, water park, museums, health resorts with mud baths and climatic treatments, and numerous water sport activities. Berdiansk Airport is located nearby.

Since 27 February 2022, Berdiansk has been under Russian occupation.

==History==
===Founding===
In the 19th century, the Russian Imperial government began to plan to build a seaport in the Northern Azov region. In 1824, Count Mikhail Vorontsov, Governor-General of the Caucasus Viceroyalty, sent an expedition to the Azov Sea. Its task was to find a place to build a new seaport to assist in the defense of Russia&#x27;s southern borders. Initially, the place for a future port was implied in the village of Obetochnoe that belonged to Count Orlov-Denisov, near the town of Nogaisk (now Prymorsk) founded in 1821.

In the autumn of 1824, Captain Nikolai Kritsky, the expedition supervisor reported on several prospective sites; the best being a place closed off from the sea by the . In an official report to Vorontsov, Kritsky wrote: &quot;the quality of Berdiansk Spit surpasses that of ; you can build a landing stage and port on it unless you concede to Sevastopol...&quot;. In the 1820s, the place of the future Berdiansk was just a small settlement of fishers with a few huts.

The settlement that would become Berdiansk itself was founded in 1827 on the site of a Nogai settlement named &quot;Kutur-Ohla&quot;. The settlement was also called &quot;Kutur-Ohla&quot; initially, inheriting the name of the Nogai settlement. Vorontsov, who had ordered the founding of the village, had a &quot;fairly liberal&quot; attitude regarding Jewish people, and so the settlement had a Jewish community from as early as it was founded. The local Jews were mainly employed as tailors and merchants.

===Development===

In 1830, its name was changed to Novo-Nogaisk. On 1 July 1830 merchant Nikolay Kobozev&#x27;s private wooden quay was opened with a ceremony. Only by 12 January 1835, a state-owned quay had been built.

In 1833, Kobozev set up a wooden post to function as a navigation beacon. In 1836, the first foreign ship entered the port of Berdiansk. A modern stone lighthouse was built under the leadership of the Italian merchant Carlo Tomasini in 1838. It is a octahedral whitestone tower with an orange stripe in the middle. The beacon fires protected sailing ships and was first seen in 1840. The present name &quot;Berdiansk&quot; was given to the city in 1841 by special decree of Nicholas I and named after the nearby . The name of Berdiansk has also been written Berdianske (), According to 1928 Kharkiv Orthography.

In 1841 the settlement at Berdiansk Bay received city status. Grigory Chernyaev (1787—1868) was appointed the city governor (&quot;gradonachalnik&quot;) and the head of Berdiansk sea port. Chernyaev, an officer from landed gentry, took part in the Battle of Borodino. After the defeat of Napoleon he was appointed a comendant of Valenciennes. Mikhail Vorontsov knew him from France, when the former was the commander of the Russian expedition forces.

The son of the Nogaisk merchant who owned fisheries at Berdiansk Bay, Nikolay Kobozev, was elected the first mayor of the city in 1841. During his term, the small township turned into a flourishing city with a large number of foreign companies&#x27; offices and active international trade. He built the first stone houses in the town and the famous Winter Theater, later destroyed during World War II.

In 1842, Berdiansk became the center of Berdyansky Uyezd (county). On 31 January 1845, the first coat of arms of Berdiansk was created. At the top, on a green background, is a silver Nogai nomadic tent together with a black plow; this denotes the semi-nomadic life lived in the Nogais and farming work done by local residents. In the bottom part, on a blue background, sits a black anchor to symbolize the district&#x27;s affinity with the sea. By this time the customs outpost was already opened. Some foreign marine grain purchasing representatives (negotiators) moved their offices to Berdiansk from Mariupol and Odesa.

In 1847, Berdiansk&#x27;s Jewish population was 572, and in 1860, they established a Talmud Torah school. In April 1862 Tsar Alexander II with assistance from Mayor N. Kobozev confirmed the city district plan for Berdiansk. In the plan, the streets were straight and led to the sea. This layout has remained to the present day in the central part of the city. It was forbidden to build houses above the second floor. Fine buildings decorate Berdiansk: the Winter Theatre, City Hall, the hotel &quot;Bristol&quot; (now House of Culture factory &quot;Pivdenhidromash&quot;), male classical school (now the main building of the Pedagogical Institute), Ascension Cathedral, the Lutheran Church, and more.

In Berdiansk the main employer was still the seaport, and on 24 March 1869 a breakwater was commissioned. This stone construction is long with two port lights on the ends – pointers to the harbor, located at a distance of from the shore. The increasing importance of the port was mentioned in 1867 in a commemorative book on the Taurida Governorate: &quot;Already there is no doubt, that for all the Azov coast the Berdiansk port will be the Odesa of the Black Sea coast&quot;.

In 1876 as part of the defense of Sevastopol, rear admiral P. P. Schmidt was appointed Town Governor and Port Chief. Being a progressive man, he did much to promote the development of both port and city. Soon there were small industrial enterprises and banks opening in the city. John Greaves&#x27; factory manufacturing harvesters became well known across Europe. A farming machine factory was opened by Schröder and Matias. There was the rope-making factory of Venz and Yanzen, Selstrem&#x27;s candle-wax works, Litsmen sausage factory, Fetter&#x27;s brewery, Klavdin macaroni factory, and Ediger&#x27;s printing house. The Italians constructed the city power station. By this time, two daily newspapers, three libraries and four bookshops were established. The city had running water and electric light illumination.

After the assassination of Alexander II in 1881, there were fears of antisemitic pogroms breaking out, and the Jews of Berdiansk requested the authorities to send troops to protect the population from ethnic violence.

In 1883, the oil lamps in the lighthouse were replaced by electric lights. The old beacon was refurbished and upgraded with newer equipment. According to the 1897 census, there were 3,306 Jews in Berdiansk, and they made up 12.9% of the city&#x27;s total population. In 1899 Berdiansk was linked up to the railway.

At the beginning of the 20th century the city population numbered 26,500. There were about ten orthodox temples, two Jewish and one Karaite synagogue, boys and girls grammar schools, nautical classes, a city college and some credit institutions. In addition to an extensive export trade in mainly grain and flour, Berdiansk conducted large amounts of inland trade. It became a substantial distributive market for goods received over a wide area. By the beginnings of the 20th century, Berdiansk had become a merchant trading port with well developed industry, strongly influenced by its infrastructure. In 1915 a French consul, and the vice-consuls of the UK, Greece, Denmark, Spain, Italy, Sweden, and Norway, were in Berdiansk.

===Soviet period and late 20th century===

During the Ukrainian War of Independence, Berdiansk fell under the control of the Makhnovshchina, becoming one of the key centres for the Ukrainian anarchist movement.

During the Soviet period Berdiansk was a powerful industrial centre. There were machine factories of all types, an oil refinery, a fiberglass factory, cable factory, ferroconcrete combine, factory of materials handling equipment, provisions factory, a bread-baking complex, milk plant, a meat-packing plant, a considerable quantity of construction and mounting organizations, commodity railway station and the sea trading port. Between 1939 and 1958 the city was known as &quot;Osypenko&quot;, so named after Hero of the Soviet Union Polina Osipenko.

The Jews in Berdiansk were murdered during the German occupation of Ukraine in 1941 and 1942. During the rest of the Soviet period, little is known about the Jewish community. In the early 1990s, after Ukrainian independence, a Jewish cultural society in Berdiansk was created. In 1994, there were 2,000 Jews in Berdiansk, making up 1.3% of the population. The economy of Berdiansk declined due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The majority of the large industrial enterprises ceased operation or were reorganised into smaller private concerns.

===Russo-Ukrainian War===
Following the completion of the Crimea Bridge, and amidst hostile Ukrainian-Russian relations, the Ukrainian seaport authority stated in November 2018 that in Berdiansk year on year shipping had dropped 50%. They said that this was due to ships not getting permission from Russia to pass through the Kerch strait. Russia denied any disruption to Ukrainian shipping.

On 27 February 2022, three days after the Russian invasion of Ukraine began, Berdiansk was captured by the Russian Army during the Southern Ukraine offensive of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Many local people protested the occupation in the streets, singing the Ukrainian national anthem. The Russian navy Alligator-class landing ship &quot;Saratov&quot; was sunk in the port of Berdiansk by a Ukrainian attack on 24 March 2022. On 6 September 2022 Artem Bardin, the city&#x27;s Russian-imposed commandant, was attacked and seriously injured near the administration building, and died later that day. A series of explosions was reported at Russian-occupied Berdiansk air base on 8 December 2022.

==Geography==

Berdiansk is located in a steppe zone that defines its varieties of flora and fauna. The climate on the Azov coast is unique: the summers are hot and dry, the winters are mild and warm. The main natural feature is the end of the Berdiansk Spit. The spit flora is quite diverse. Here one can find more than 300 different kinds of plants. Some of them are documented in the Red Book (e.g. &quot;Carex colchica&quot;, &quot;Eryngium maritimum&quot;, &quot;Glycyrrhiza glabra&quot;). The vegetation is mostly made up of plants with powerful root systems.

In spite of the fact that the spit is a populous territory, it exhibits a wide variety of fauna. Here it is possible to see hares, hedgehogs, martens, foxes, weasels and steppe cats. There also are: geese, sandpipers, swans, herons, ducks, magpies, seagulls, cormorants, warblers, lapwings, red-breasted geese and mute swans. Their numbers swell during the migration season. The islands of Big Dzendzik and Small Dzendzik, small islands in the Astapih&#x27;s archipelago, contain most of the birds.

Sea water temperatures off Berdiansk are higher than the Black Sea coast of the Crimea and the Caucasus. Already in May, the water warms up to , and in June it can reach . In the sea there are more than 70 fish species amongst them great sturgeon, Russian sturgeon, starred sturgeon, Azov turbot, haarder, mullets, kilka, anchovy, sea roach, shemaya and various species of gobies. There are predators too, pike perch and sterlet. The phytoplankton consists of diatomaceous, peridinium and cyanobacteria algae. At the bottom of the sea are large quantity of molluscs, such as cockles, sendesmiya, mussels and myas. They form an important food source for the fish. In coastal waters there are also dolphins.

==Tourism==

The status of the city has gradually changed from an Industrial centre to more of a tourist centre. Today Berdiansk is the main resort city on the Azov coast. Its population numbers about 130,000, and during the resort season this figure rises to about 600 thousand. The leisure facilities are highly developed and successfully compete with resorts on the Black Sea Coast and the Crimea. There are a large number of sanatoriums and resorts where it is possible to take medical and restorative courses for &quot;health improvement&quot;.

On the Berdiansk Spit there are about: 7 sanatoriums, 17 children&#x27;s and sports establishments, 45 recreation centres and boarding houses that receive up to 15 thousand visitors. There is also the biggest Aquapark in Europe, the Kyiv dolphinarium, a safari zoo, and a lot of pleasure and cultural establishments. Gradually Berdiansk is evolving into a modern European city. In 2001 it received first place in an All-Ukrainian competition for best city beautification.

In the pedestrian area of Azov Avenue, the Seaside square and Berdiansk quays it is possible to travel on trishaws, a small steam locomotive and on real horses. On all beaches there are entertainments such as: riding on rubber bananas and tablets, water bicycles and motorcycles, slides and trampolines, and sailing. There is also nightlife, with many bars and restaurants located directly on the sea coast.

==Economy==

One of the main enterprises is the sea trading port, with clients from all over the world. It carries out metal processing, scrap metal, grain, coal, ore, clay, sunflower-seed oil, industrial oils, mineral oil, and pig-iron. There is a complex for processing fertilizers and mineral oil, the container terminal, and a railway depot. Tracks and roads approach all moorings, and all are equipped with electric cranes. Depth in port water area is .

Berdiansk is also an important fisheries centre which is an integral part of the city&#x27;s food industry. There is also a scientific organisation which does fish research in reservoirs of the Azov basin. It determines stock levels and calculates the annual volumes of withdrawal of such valuable food fish as sturgeon, pike perch, haarder, Azov turbot, Azov gobies, and flounder.

Chemical and the petroleum-refining industry is represented by two big enterprises: &quot;AZMOL,&quot; and the Berdiansk state fiberglass factory, plus two small enterprises: Limited Liability Company &quot;Fibreglass&quot; and Closed Corporation &quot;Bertie.&quot;
Public corporation &quot;AZMOL&quot; is engaged in the manufacture of lubricants and packaging, and the development of new products using energy-efficient technologies. Transfer to municipal ownership of the city biological sewage treatment plant is planned.

==Education==

As well as the state comprehensive schools there are private lyceums and gymnasiums, as well as branches of other high schools and professional colleges. There is the Berdiansk State Pedagogical University and the University of Management and Business. In the Schmidt park there is the Berdiansk musical school, and nearby, almost on the coast, an art school. A subject of pride in Berdiansk is the Centre of Children&#x27;s and Youthful Creativity, numbering a large quantity of study groups and ensembles.

According to Ben Eklof in &quot;Russian Peasant Schools&quot;, education in Berdiansk was badly disrupted in the 1870s when the schools director, a government inspector, &#x27;ran amok&#x27; and had to be removed from his post.

<doc id="788403" wikidata="Q1001749" url="?curid=788403" title="Buell Motorcycle Company">
<text>Buell Motorcycles is an American motorcycle manufacturer based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. It was founded in 1983 by ex-Harley-Davidson engineer Erik Buell. 
Harley-Davidson acquired 49 percent of Buell in 1993, and Buell became a wholly owned subsidiary of Harley-Davidson by 2003. 
On November 17, 2006, Buell announced that it had produced and shipped its 100,000th motorcycle.

On October 15, 2009, Harley-Davidson announced the discontinuation of the Buell product line as part of its strategy to focus on the Harley-Davidson brand. The last Buell motorcycle produced through Harley-Davidson was on October 30, 2009, bringing the number manufactured to 136,923. In November 2009, Erik Buell announced the launch of Erik Buell Racing, an independent company run by Erik Buell which initially produced race-only versions of the 1125R model, then subsequently offered an updated 1190RS model for the street or the track, and produced further improved 1190RX and 1190SX models which are intended for street or track use.

In February 2021, Buell Motorcycles announced that motorcycle production had returned, under the ownership of Erik Buell Racing (EBR). Buell announced they will use the superbike platforms developed from 2011 to 2020 to build out their model line up to approximately ten models in 2024. The models will include variations for touring, dirt, adventure, and cruisers.

==History==
The first Buell motorcycle, the RW750, was built in 1983 purely for competition in the AMA Formula 1 motorcycle road racing championship. At the time, Erik Buell was a top contending privateer motorcycle racer. After completion of the first two RW750 racing machines, one of which was sold to another racing team, the Formula 1 series was canceled. Erik Buell turned his focus towards racing-inspired, street-going machines using engines manufactured by Harley. In 1987 Rockville Harley-Davidson in Rockville, Maryland (now District Harley-Davidson / District Cycles, formerly Battley Harley-Davidson / Battley Cycles in Gaithersburg, Maryland) became the world&#x27;s first Buell dealership and the owner, Devin Battley has Buell #1, an RR1000 in his personal collection.

In 1993, Harley-Davidson purchased 49% of Buell, investing $500,000 and taking Erik Buell&#x27;s house as security. Erik Buell took the deal, against strong advice from his attorney. Harley-Davidson CEO Jeffrey Bleustein had bought it as a skunkworks development. In 1994, Buell created the Buell Riders Adventure Group (BRAG) which hosted events around the country. Buell discontinued BRAG in 2006, stating the changes would improve, &quot;the privileges and ownership experience for all Buell owners more than ever before.&quot; In 1998, Harley-Davidson bought a majority stake and took control of Buell Motorcycle Company, and the company became a subsidiary. Since then, Buell has used modified Harley-Davidson engines, primarily from the Sportster, to power its motorcycles.
Most Buell motorcycles use four-stroke air-cooled V-twin engines, originally built for XR1000 Sportster. After these were depleted, a basic 1200 Sportster engine was used. In 1995, the engines were upgraded with Buell engineered high-performance parts and further upgraded in 1998.

The liquid-cooled Harley V-Rod motor, developed by Harley-Davidson then made street legal according to the EPA by Porsche, was originally an Erik Buell project, designed for a fully faired AMA Superbike Buell by 1998. Harley decided the engine should also be used in a sport-cruiser, then took over development, making it &quot;too big, too heavy, too expensive and too late&quot; for Buell. Harley-Davidson forced Buell to follow the rigid product planning and distribution process beginning in the 1990s, with the philosophy that Buell was the starter brand, and customers would eventually trade up to a Harley. By 2008, Harley&#x27;s credit arm, Harley-Davidson Financial Services (HDFS), was struggling, and the lower resale value of Buell motorcycles meant that new bike sales were significantly affected. When Harley CEO Keith Wandell was hired, he immediately questioned why Harley even owned Buell. Wandell, who had never been on a Harley before being hired, was heard talking about &quot;Erik&#x27;s racing hobby&quot;, and questioned &quot;why anyone would even want to ride a sportbike&quot;. He organized a team to analyze &quot;the adrenaline market&quot;, and concluded that sportbikes would encounter high competition and low profits, while cruisers had high returns.

On Thursday, October 15, 2009, Harley-Davidson Inc. announced the end of production of Buell Motorcycles in order to focus more on the Harley-Davidson brand. Selling Buell was not legitimately considered, as Harley didn&#x27;t want their Harley dealerships to sell an outside brand, and Harley didn&#x27;t feel Buell had much value without the dealer network. In a news release on the Buell website the same day, company officials thanked customers, employees, and dealers for &quot;an unforgettable ride&quot;. Closing the Buell brand was estimated to cost Harley approximately the same as their total investment in Buell over the past 25 years. Erik Buell immediately began looking for outside buyers, finding BRP (who owns the Austrian Rotax engine manufacturer BRP-Powertrain) a good choice, especially since Harley would have to pay Rotax &quot;an eight-figure sum&quot; for the 1,125 cc engine contract. Erik Buell later started Erik Buell Racing (EBR) to provide support for 1125 and XB privateer race efforts.

In April 2015, EBR filed for receivership, despite a deal in 2013 where Indian firm Hero MotoCorp acquired 49 percent of the company, and in January 2016, the remaining assets of Erik Buell Racing were sold to the firm Liquid Asset Partners. Under Liquid Asset Partners&#x27;s ownership, the company took the name &quot;EBR Motorcycles&quot; in 2019, and subsequently acquired the rights in the United States to the Buell nameplate. In February 2021, newly renamed Buell Motorcycles announced its return to the motorcycle market, with the intention to release ten new models between then and 2024.

==Technology==

Buell XB models also incorporated the industry&#x27;s first Zero Torsional Load (ZTL) perimeter floating front disc brake system, a patented &quot;inside-out&quot; wheel/brake design that puts the brake disc on the outer edge of the wheel,
rather than at the hub. This lets the suspension function better, improving control and traction, through reducing unsprung weight on the front wheel, because only a single disc and caliper—with a corresponding reduction in bolts and brake fluid—is needed compared with the conventional dual-disc brake setup on most modern sport bikes. In an exchange in the pages of &quot;Motorcyclist&quot; magazine between Suzuki engineer James Parker, creator of the GSX-RADD hub-center steering system, 
and Buell&#x27;s Director of Analysis, Test &amp; Engineering Process, Abraham Askenazi, Parker conceded the ZTL system&#x27;s advantage in unsprung weight. But he pointed out the remaining weight is located further out on the rim where it is most detrimental to acceleration and braking, and that there were potential heat transfer issues, and the need for one fork leg to be stronger than the other. Responding, Askenazi disputed all of Parker&#x27;s criticisms, saying the ZTL system was 30% lighter than the brakes on the Suzuki GSX-R1000, and that the inertia of having the weight further out on the rim, and the heat generation near the tire, were not negative factors, based on testing. Askenazi concluded that testing and race track experience had proven the ZTL to be &quot;state of the art.&quot;

Other industry innovations introduced by Buell in the XB lineup were the &quot;fuel in frame&quot; technology, and the dual use of the swingarm as an oil tank. 
Also, all Buell models have a muffler mounted below the engine which helps keep mass centralized with some models featuring a computer-controlled valve to switch between two exhaust paths as necessary to maximize torque. Buell designs focus on providing good handling, comfortable riding, easy maintenance, and street-friendly real-world performance. Buell motorcycles were engineered with an emphasis on what they called the &quot;Trilogy of Tech&quot;: mass centralization, low unsprung weight, and frame rigidity.

Buell engines were designed to be street-friendly both in fuel efficiency (up to with the Blast), and in torque (the 1,203 cc version produces ). They are also simple and easy to maintain. Most Buell two-cylinder engines utilize computer controlled ducted forced air cooling (variable speed fan that only activates as required), two valves per cylinder, a single throttle body, zero maintenance hydraulic valve actuation, and zero maintenance gear-driven cams. Buell advanced its 1190 platform significantly under the Erik Buell Racing tenure. Engine technology improved to the EV-V2 1190cc 72 degree V-Twin that produces 185 horsepower at 10,600 rpm and 102 ft. lbs. of torque at 8200 rpm.

==Buell models==

===Tube-frame bikes (1984–2002)===
====RW 750 Road Warrior (1984)====
The RW 750 was a development of the Barton Formula One racing motorcycle. Buell bought the parts and tooling from the failed Barton concern and developed the RW 750 for his own use and for sale to private entrants. The engine was a liquid-cooled two-stroke square four. Buell&#x27;s development resulted in a more competitive racer, but production ceased when the AMA discontinued the Formula One class.

====RR 1000 Battletwin (1987–1988)====

The RR 1000 Battletwin was a street sportbike using a modified Road Warrior chassis and a Harley-Davidson XR1000 engine. Buell invented the &quot;Isoplanar&quot; engine mounting system to allow the heavy, vibration-prone engine to be used as a structural member of the frame without transmitting the engine vibrations to the frame. Lack of space caused Buell to put the suspension components under the engine. The linkage caused the spring and the shock absorber to extend when the wheel went up.

Variations on the RR 1000 Battletwin include the RR 1200 Battletwin (1988–1990), the RS 1200 Westwind (1989), the RS 1200/5 Westwind (1990–1992) and the RSS 1200 Westwind (1991).

====S2 Thunderbolt (1994–1995)====
Two-seater with Road Warrior-based chassis and Sportster engine. The S2T Thunderbolt (1995–1996) was a touring version, with saddlebags. The S2 was very expensive to develop (around $100,000), and 1,399 units were sold in the first year—well over the 300 units Buell had projected.

====S1 Lightning (1996–1998)====

The S1 Lightning was a more fundamental sportbike than the S3 Thunderbolt and M2 Cyclone that it was marketed alongside and the production on this model was stopped at 5000 after only 3 years. Variants of this version of the Lightning were the S1 Lightning (1996/1997/1998) and the S1W White Lightning (1998). The S1W came with a larger tank and &quot;Thunderstorm&quot; cylinder heads which gave an extra .

====X1 Lightning (1999–2002)====
The X1 Lightning was the successor to the S1 Lightning line. It used the Thunderstorm heads, fuel injection (Dynamic Digital Fuel Injection), and incorporated larger fuel tanks as well as completely different body designs. The most recognizable frame piece was the brushed aluminum tail section that swept upward and back underneath the two-up seat.

====S3 Thunderbolt (1997–2002) and S3T Thunderbolt (1997–2002)====

The S3 Thunderbolt sport-touring model was produced from 1997 until 2003, along with a mechanically identical S3T &quot;Touring&quot; model that ran through model year 2000. The 1,203 cc air-cooled V-Twin engine was mounted as a stressed member in a tubular frame. The powerplant output in 1997 and jumped to in the following years due to revised cam profiles and the new Thunderstorm cylinder heads. While the bike&#x27;s overall look was the same throughout the model run, there were significant changes made in 1999 that set it, and later models, apart from the 1997 and 1998 bikes. The early bikes used a rectangular section steel rear swingarm, WP Suspension front forks and rear shock, a Keihin 40 mm CV carburetor, and a Performance Machine six-piston front brake caliper. Beginning in 1999 a new cast aluminum rear swingarm was utilized along with Showa front suspension forks and rear shock. The front brake caliper, while still a six-piston unit, was now made by Nissin. The most technological change was with the new Dynamic Digital Fuel Injection (DDFI) system, which replaced the old carburetor.

The S3 had a half fairing that surrounded the headlight and gave decent wind protection for the rider&#x27;s torso. The S3T model then added lower fairing extensions that gave better wind protection to the rider&#x27;s legs. The S3T also had hard saddlebags that could be color-matched to the bike color and were available in either &quot;wide&quot; for maximum storage, or &quot;narrow&quot; for a lighter feel. In addition to the lower fairings and the saddlebags, the S3T also came with a taller handlebar for a more upright, relaxed riding position. Each of the parts that set the S3T apart were available as accessories for the standard S3 model.

====M2 Cyclone (1997–2002)====

The M2 Cyclone was produced from 1997 to 2003. It was in the middle of the Buell line up between the puristic S1 Lightning and the more comfortable but heavier S3 Thunderbolt. The S1 Lightning was faster and lighter than the others but had a very narrow seat. The S3 Thunderbolt was a touring bike that had a wider seat and more comfortable riding position, but was also heavier. The M2 Cyclone filled the gap between the sport and touring models with a bigger seat than the S1 Lightning and lighter and faster than the S3 Thunderbolt. The M2 was only available with the 1,203 cc engine and five-speed transmission. The frame was tubular CrMo steel.

===Blast (2000–2009)===

The Blast was Buell&#x27;s only model to use a single-cylinder engine. With displacement and dry weight, it was their smallest model, often used in Harley-Davidson&#x27;s &quot;Rider&#x27;s Edge&quot; new rider instruction/riding schools. That fulfilled Harley CEO Jeff Bleustein&#x27;s idea to make a specific training bike, since many students buy a bike from the dealer where they trained.

The Blast came from a quick proof-of-concept at the Buell factory. It originally used half of a Sportster 883 engine. The engine ended up 80 percent over budget and very expensive compared to the higher-technology Rotax engines available from outside the company. &quot;Cycle World&quot; wrote &quot;Such an overrun would be unheard of from an outside supplier, but when your supplier also owns you, you grin and bear it.&quot; The Blast was ultimately the most expensive development project Buell undertook.
Because the engine was overpriced, it ended up making money for Harley while losing money for Buell. It was regarded as a technical success. In July 2009, Buell ran an ad campaign saying that the Blast would no longer appear in their line-up. The ad showed a Buell Blast being destroyed in an automobile crusher.

===XB-series (2003–2010)===


The XB powertrain still had its roots with the Harley Sportster powertrain and was designed for both projects. Unfortunately, it was designed by Harley with minimum input from Buell. A turbocharger was to be sourced from Aerocharger to help pump the XB horsepower to , but the Aerocharger supplier deal fell through when Harley-Davidson decided to engineer one in-house. The project was a failure, despite &quot;millions of dollars&quot; spent.

Before the first XB was sold, the cost was well over the target, leading to a sales price increase from the original price of $7,995 to $9,995. It was a popular bike, but never sold at Harley marketing department&#x27;s expected volume, partly due to the significantly higher price.

Buell introduced the XB frame in the 2002 Firebolt XB9R sport bike. The Firebolt XB12R was introduced in 2004 and was initially sold alongside the smaller displacement Firebolt XB9R. The Lightning came in 2003 and was marketed by Buell as a streetfighter motorcycle. The XB9 engines had a displacement of , and the later XB12 engines had . The XB12 engine had a longer stroke of compared to that of on the XB9. The cylinder bore size between both engines was identical at .

The Buell Ulysses XB12X debuted in July 2005. It had seating, ergonomics, and long-travel suspension that are suited for use on unpaved and rough roads. Buell advertised the Ulysses as &quot;the world&#x27;s first adventure sportbike.&quot; For 2008, among other changes, XBRR oil pump and ignition timing systems have been changed tapping into the XBRR race bike as well as the addition of heated grips and increased turning fork swing from 54° to 74°. The Ulysses XB12XT differs from the Ulysses XB12X in several areas. It has a different front fender, unlike the Enduro-front fender that comes on the XB12X and lower fork protection is not as pronounced as on the XB12X, due to the intended purpose of the XB12XT which is more street than dirt oriented. Other major differences include the suspension which is completely different between the two bikes, being about an inch lower on the XB12XT and tuned more for street riding, vs. the XB12X&#x27;s slightly taller and softer suspension better tuned for dirt use. Along with factory Hepco &amp; Becker hard panniers and top box, tall windshield and a seat height, the XB12XT also has wheels that are approximately lighter than those found on the XB12X, which have added mass to make them stronger for off paved road use. The XB12XP is a police model that was available for the 2009 model year.

====XB2 type====
A different frame with more fuel capacity, longer swing arm &amp; wheelbase, 23.8°/23.5° steering axis angle, more trail:
*Lightning Long XB12Ss
*Lightning Super TT XB12STT
*Ulysses XB12X
*Ulysses XB12XP
*Ulysses XB12XT

=== 1125-series (XB3, 2007–2009)===

====1125R====
In July 2007, Buell announced the 1125R, a sport bike which departed from Buell&#x27;s history of using Harley-Davidson Sportster based middle weight powertrains and tapping into the XBRR racing bike learnings. The Rotax Helicon powertrain uses four valves per cylinder, dual over-head cam, liquid-cooled 72 degree V-Twin displacing 1,125 cc and producing . It produces of peak torque but varies less than of torque from 3,000 to 10,500 rpm. There is a vacuum assist slipper clutch to give predictable drive performance in hard cornering and deceleration and a six-speed transmission.

The Helicon engine was developed and built by BRP-Powertrain in Gunskirchen, Austria southwest of Linz. The design had significant Buell input and was funded through Buell&#x27;s cashflow. The 1125R did not have a full fairing, as that would have put it in the same class as Japanese sportbikes. Erik Buell agonized over this, saying &quot;it&#x27;s about not listening to the voice of the customer.&quot; &quot;Cycle World&quot; magazine said the 1125R was &quot;a bit of an oddity.&quot; The bike was initially released with a crude spark map, leading to criticism of the bike at low speeds. The Rotax Helicon also ended up costing significantly more by production time due to fluctuation in exchange rates.

====1125CR====
For the 2009 model year, Buell introduced the 1125CR, a version of the 1125R in the cafe racer style. It was done in response to customer feedback, which said the 1125R was not what was wanted, and causing Buell to shelve plans for a streetfighter, going for a cafe racer instead. The 1125CR has a longer swingarm, a longer wheelbase, and a shorter secondary drive ratio.

==Racing==

===Buell XBRR===

Buell produced a limited series of 50 XBRR (, ) racing-only machines for factory-backed and privateer racing teams.
The XBRR frame was a XB1/XB2 hybrid, the suspension came from Swedish manufacturer Öhlins, and the wheels were made of magnesium. It was the first model using the ZTL2 eight-piston caliper by Nissin.

===Buell 1125RR===
In 2009, Buell announced production of the 1125RR, also a race-only motorcycle. The bike was internally called the B2, aimed for the supersport market. Built from the 1125R, the 1125RR changes include a titanium exhaust, magnesium wheels, full fairings and a chain drive.

On September 9, 2009, Buell won its first AMA Pro racing championship. Rider Danny Eslick clinched the title at New Jersey Motorsports Park on Buell&#x27;s 1125R model. On November 15, 2009, Buell won its first NHRA Pro Stock Motorcycle world championship. Rider Hector Arana clinched the title at the Southern California NHRA Finals on a Lucas Oil backed Buell.

<text>Fernando Ruiz Hierro (; born 23 March 1968) is a Spanish football executive and former player who played as a centre-back, sweeper or defensive midfielder.

He won five La Liga and three Champions League trophies with Real Madrid in 14 years after signing from Valladolid, during which he appeared in 601 official matches. He also competed professionally in Qatar and England.

Hierro represented Spain on 89 occasions, appearing in four World Cups and two European Championships. He started working as a manager in 2016 with Oviedo, being appointed at the helm of the national team two years later.

==Club career==
===Early years and Real Madrid===
Hierro was born in Vélez-Málaga, Province of Málaga. After beginning his football career at local club Vélez he had a very brief youth spell with neighbouring CD Málaga, where he was told he was not good enough for the sport, which prompted a return home. He eventually made his La Liga debut with Real Valladolid, being bought by Real Madrid in the summer of 1989 after two solid seasons; youth graduate José Luis Caminero moved in the opposite direction as part of the deal.

At Real, Hierro scored seven goals in 37 games in his first season, and eventually had his position on the field advanced by coach Radomir Antić, continuing his good performances with the addition of goals – he totalled an astonishing 44 league goals in three seasons, 21 alone in 1991–92, a career-best. For years, he often partnered Manolo Sanchís in the centre of defence, being instrumental in the conquest of five leagues and three UEFA Champions League trophies and being named captain after the latter&#x27;s retirement.

On 24 March 2002, Hierro scored a hat-trick in a 3–1 home win against Real Zaragoza, although the ultimate champions would be Valencia. He was released at the end of the 2002–03 season alongside manager Vicente del Bosque, under rather unceremonious circumstances; having appeared in 497 top-division matches over the course of 16 seasons (105 goals), he then chose a lucrative move to the wealthy but developing Middle East football industry, joining Qatar&#x27;s Al-Rayyan.

===Bolton Wanderers===
After just one year, Hierro returned to Europe to sign with Premier League side Bolton Wanderers on the advice of his English teammate at Real Madrid Steve McManaman, and teaming up with another former player of that club, Iván Campo. He scored once during his tenure, which came in a 3–2 loss at Norwich City in December 2004 and, even though hard-pressed by fans and manager Sam Allardyce to stay for a further campaign, he announced his retirement from professional football on 10 May 2005.

==International career==
Hierro was capped 89 times for Spain and scored 29 goals, being only surpassed by Raúl (who also took over his captain armband in June 2002 when he retired), Álvaro Morata, David Silva, Fernando Torres and David Villa. He made his debut on 20 September 1989 – freshly signed by Madrid – in a 1–0 friendly victory over Poland in A Coruña, and appeared for the nation in the 1990 (although only as a squad member), 1994, 1998 and 2002 FIFA World Cups, as well as UEFA Euro 1996 (where he missed a penalty as Spain crashed out to hosts England in a shootout) and 2000.

One of Hierro&#x27;s most important goals came during the 1994 World Cup qualification, as he headed the winner against Denmark that allowed ten-men Spain to qualify for the final tournament in the United States. In the finals, he scored after an individual effort against Switzerland in the round of 16, before his team was eliminated by Italy in the quarter-finals following a 2–1 loss.

==Coaching and executive career==
Although he had already been in charge for a few weeks, Hierro was officially presented as sporting director of the Royal Spanish Football Federation in late September 2007. He remained four years in the position.

Hierro returned to his native region in July 2011, being appointed Málaga CF&#x27;s director of football. On 28 May 2012, even though the club finished fourth and qualified for the Champions League for the first time ever, he left his position.
On 10 July 2014, Hierro was named assistant coach of Real Madrid, replacing Zinedine Zidane – who left to take the reins of Real Madrid Castilla – in Carlo Ancelotti&#x27;s staff. He was given his first full managerial role two years later, being appointed at Segunda División side Real Oviedo for the upcoming season with the option of a further year; on 14 June 2017, after missing out on the promotion playoffs on the final matchday, he left the Estadio Carlos Tartiere by mutual consent.

Hierro returned to the Spanish Federation as sporting director on 27 November 2017. He was appointed as the manager of Spain on 13 June 2018 after the sacking of Julen Lopetegui two days before their first match at the World Cup, following the latter&#x27;s decision to join Real Madrid after the tournament. Two days later, he led the team to a 3–3 group stage draw against Portugal; on 8 July, following a penalty shootout loss to hosts Russia in the round of 16, he stepped down from his post and also announced that he would not return to his role as sporting director.

On 21 October 2022, Hierro was announced as sporting director of Guadalajara in the Mexican Liga MX. In June 2024, he joined Saudi Pro League&#x27;s Al Nassr in the same capacity.

==Style of play==
Equally at ease as a central defender, sweeper or defensive midfielder, Hierro had the ability, at his peak, to combine solid defensive play with a near-unlimited passing range and surprising goalscoring talent, which made him one of the world&#x27;s most sought-after players. A large, physically imposing and intimidating defensive presence, he was also known for his positional sense, strength in the air, tenacity and the ability to time his challenges well.

Regarded as a highly competitive and hard-tackling defender, &quot;The Times&quot; placed Hierro at number 43 in their list of the 50 hardest footballers in history in 2007.

==Personal life==
Hierro&#x27;s older brothers, Antonio and Manuel, were also professional footballers and defenders. The latter paired up with Fernando at Valladolid, as the club finished eighth in 1987–88.

In 2021, Hierro began dating Croatian television journalist Fani Stipković, having divorced his wife of 28 years Sonia Ruiz. They married in September 2023 in Mexico and, the following month, welcomed their first child, Nicolás Valentín.

<text>Harry Kemelman (November 24, 1908 – December 15, 1996) was an American mystery writer and a professor of English. He was the creator of the fictitious religious sleuth Rabbi David Small.
== Early life==
Harry Kemelman was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1908.

After receiving a B.A. in English Literature from Boston University and an M.A. in English philology from Harvard, he taught at a number of schools before World War II. During the war, Kemelman worked as wage administrator for the United States Army Transportation Corps in Boston and later for the War Assets Administration. Following the war, he was a freelance writer and private businessman. In 1963 he became assistant professor of English at the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology in Boston. He was also an assistant professor at Boston State College in the 1960s.

==Writing career==
His writing career began with short stories for &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; featuring New England college professor Nicky Welt, the first of which, &quot;The Nine Mile Walk&quot;, is considered a classic.

The Rabbi Small series began in 1964 with the publication of &quot;Friday the Rabbi Slept Late&quot;, which became a huge bestseller, and won Kemelman a 1965 Edgar Award for Best First Novel. The Rabbi Small books are not only mysteries, but also considerations of Conservative Judaism.

==Adaptations==
Kemelman also received $35,000 for the movie rights to &quot;Friday the Rabbi Slept Late&quot;, a made-for-TV adaptation of which was broadcast on NBC in 1976. The film starred Art Carney as Chief Lanigan and Stuart Margolin as Rabbi Small. A short-lived TV series, &quot;Lanigan&#x27;s Rabbi&quot;, shown as part of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Mystery Movie&quot; series in January 1977, was based on the book series. Art Carney played Chief Lanigan with Bruce Solomon as Rabbi Small.

In 2003, director Alvaro Brechner shot an adaptation of &quot;The Nine Mile Walk&quot; in Toledo, Spain. The film was shown in more than 100 international film festivals, garnering several awards.

==Death==
Kemelman died in 1996, at the age of 88, in Marblehead, Massachusetts.

<doc id="788415" wikidata="Q7516461" url="?curid=788415" title="Silver Swan (comics)">
<text>The Silver Swan is a fictional character appearing in DC Comics publications and related media, commonly as a recurring adversary of the superhero Wonder Woman. Capable of flight and possessing the superhuman ability to generate a devastating sonic cry, she first appeared in 1982 in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #288, written by Roy Thomas and illustrated by Gene Colan. Since then, the character has undergone several updates as comic book continuities have evolved and shifted. Indeed, there have been three different Silver Swans since the character&#x27;s debut, including Helen Alexandros, the original Silver Swan; Valerie Beaudry, the second Silver Swan, debuting in 1988 in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (vol. 2) #15; and [[Julia and Vanessa Kapatelis|Vanessa Kapatelis]], the third and current Silver Swan, debuting in 2001 in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (vol. 2) #171. The backstories of all three characters are inspired by Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s fairy tale &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot;: Alexandros, Beaudry and Kapetelis all believe in different ways that they are undesirable, unattractive or unwanted, only to find themselves transformed into extraordinarily beautiful (and vengeful) super-powered women.

==Fictional character biography==
===Helen Alexandros===
Born to Leda Alexandros, Helen Alexandros is a bitter ballet dancer who, disgusted by being overlooked and cruelly treated because of her homely appearance, struck a bargain with Mars to have a beautiful face and body in return for destroying man&#x27;s champion, Wonder Woman. Helen becomes the mystically-created alter ego Silver Swan in the Pre-Crisis universe.

Diana Prince comes upon a gang of bank robbers, and a new arrival, a flying, costumed female who calls herself the Silver Swan, helps her bring them in. The Silver Swan flies off, and Wonder Woman discovers that the briefcase of secret documents she and Steve Trevor had been carrying is gone. Later, Diana and Etta Candy discover a rent raise has made it necessary for them to take on a new roommate. The first applicant, whom they accept, is Helen Alexandros, who has found the briefcase and returns it to Diana.

Unknown to both of them, the plain-faced, skin-blemished Helen is a former ballerina who has been badly hurt by rejections due to her &quot;ugly duckling&quot; face. After one performance in an ancient temple in Greece, Helen cried out to the gods that she hated men. At that point, Mars appeared from Mount Olympus and revealed to Helena that she was a descendant on her mother&#x27;s side from Helen of Sparta, daughter of Zeus and Leda. When Mars asked if she was ready to accept her &quot;heritage of blood&quot;, Helen agreed, and was transformed into the beautiful Silver Swan, with the powers of flight, great strength, and a &quot;swan song&quot; which could wreak destruction. Mars told the Swan that Helen would be able to change into her for an hour at a time, as long as she served him, and on the day that she destroyed Wonder Woman, she would become the Silver Swan forever.

Later, when Wonder Woman is attempting to return the briefcase, the Silver Swan snatches it away and defeats the Amazon in battle. But, unwilling to destroy Wonder Woman around witnesses, the Swan turns over the briefcase and convinces Gen. Darnell that she mistakenly thought Wonder Woman was stealing it. Meanwhile, Doctor Psycho is able to use Steve Trevor to produce enough ectoplasm to turn him into Captain Wonder, in which identity he attacks Wonder Woman, and helps the Swan rope in Wonder Woman. Captain Wonder and Silver Swan fall in love with each other at first sight. They opt to take the captive heroine to the White House and kill her before the eyes of President of the United States Ronald Reagan. Mars appears to the Swan and demands that she order Captain Wonder to send the Robot Plane crashing into the White House and thus murder the President.

Steve Trevor awakens from Dr. Psycho&#x27;s spell and is able to break Psycho&#x27;s ability to maintain his Captain Wonder persona. Psycho crashes to Earth unharmed and Wonder Woman is able to break free. Wonder Woman battles the Silver Swan and defeats her, and the Amazon manages to prevent her plane from smashing the White House and endangering President Reagan. Disappointed in the Swan, Mars withdraws her powers and she returns to her Helen Alexandros identity, after which she disappears.

The Silver Swan reappeared in a battle arranged behind the scenes by the Monitor as one of the tests he launched to prepare for the coming multiversal crisis. The Swan appeared late one night in a Pentagon storage facility, encountering the Angle Man, Captain Wonder, and the Cheetah. They were defeated when Etta Candy used Doctor Psycho&#x27;s ectoplasmitron to create for herself a superpowered identity based on Wonder Woman.

===Valerie Beaudry===
In the Post-Crisis continuity, Valerie Beaudry was exposed to radiation from nuclear tests while in the womb. This caused her to be horribly deformed. Valerie comes under the influence of a man named Henry Cobb Armbruster. The head of Armbruster International, he exploited Valerie&#x27;s need for acceptance by choosing her for his Silver Swan project. Valerie was mutated to become the Silver Swan, granting her incredible beauty as well as tremendous hypersonic powers. He extended his control over Valerie by marrying her. He also used her to battle Wonder Woman and Ed Indelicato. Eventually, thanks to Diana and her pen pal, Maxine Sterenbuch, who had formed a true friendship with her over the years, Valerie saw Armbruster for who he truly was and divorced him.

Valerie, wanting to repay Diana for helping her, offered her assistance during her time as a fugitive during &quot;War of the Gods&quot;. Diana refused however, not wanting Valerie to be put in harm&#x27;s way, despite her incredible power. Nevertheless, she joined many of Earth&#x27;s heroes in the battle against Circe. She later joined a short-lived superteam known as the Captains of Industry. Eventually, Valerie retired her identity as the Silver Swan, but not before serving a stint in the Suicide Squad. She also appeared in &quot;Underworld Unleashed&quot; as one of many characters whom the demon Neron approached to exchange their souls to him for enhanced power. She rejected his offer, opting instead for a quiet life in suburbia, not far from her good friend Maxine.

Some time later, Valerie returned to the Silver Swan role against her will after reality was altered during &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot;. She appeared as part of a team of villains sent to attack the assembled heroes, but was quickly defeated by the Vision. Valerie was last seen standing in an energy bubble, bound and gagged with restraints conjured by the briefly resurrected Hal Jordan. After reality was restored at the event&#x27;s conclusion, Valerie presumably returned to her peaceful civilian life.

===Vanessa Kapatelis===
Julia Kapatelis became pregnant while she and her husband, David Kapatelis, were exploring Scotland. As a joke, David wanted to name their unborn child &quot;Nessie&quot; after the local Scottish creature the Loch Ness Monster. Though amused, Julia did not agree but settled on Vanessa as a close substitute. Julia remained married to David until his death 22 years into their marriage, when Vanessa was 5 years old, while exploring ruins in Egypt. Deciding to make a fresh start, Julia took Vanessa to live in the U.S. where she eventually became the Dean for the Department of History and Geology at Harvard University.

While living on Beacon Hill in Boston, Massachusetts, Vanessa grew up feeling like an awkward outsider in high school. During this time. she had the chance to meet Wonder Woman when her mother took in the Amazon when she first arrived in the United States. At first, Vanessa was jealous of Wonder Woman&#x27;s beauty, but after Diana rescued her from Decay, the two got to know each other better. Nessie started to love Wonder Woman as an elder sister and dreamed of fighting evil alongside her.

The trauma of her father&#x27;s death and the suicide of her best friend Lucy made Vanessa start to blame herself for all the bad things that happened to people she cared about, a situation worsened by Doctor Psycho&#x27;s creation of terrible nightmares where she was made to feel powerless. Vanessa was sent to a school counselor, who unbeknownst to her was under Psycho&#x27;s control. The counselor persuaded Julia that Wonder Woman&#x27;s presence was only making things worse for her daughter, and that she needed to leave their home.

Vanessa eventually recovered, but she could not forgive her mother for making Diana leave. She started to blame Diana for abandoning her. During this time, Vanessa was abducted by a villain known as the White Magician before being rescued by Diana. Her mixed emotions were a perfect target for Circe, who plotted to use vulnerable young woman as a weapon. Thus, using Sebastian Ballesteros (the latest Cheetah) as a lure, Dr. Psycho and Circe kidnapped Vanessa, and through brainwashing and sorcery, transformed her into a new Silver Swan. Now driven by anger and resentment, the Silver Swan attacked Diana and Wonder Girl, the latter of whom she considered a usurper of her &quot;entitled&quot; role. The result of this brought about the destruction of Cassie Sandmark&#x27;s school and the death of over a hundred people as well as exposing Cassie&#x27;s identity. Vanessa had become, effectively, a terrorist, but before Diana could attempt any resolution, the Imperiex attack and Circe&#x27;s takeover of New York City occurred.

After Circe was defeated, Diana took Vanessa to a hospital in Buenos Aires where she could heal. While she was recovering, Ballesteros abducted her. Veronica Cale, who hated and envied Diana, bought Nessie from him and gave her new cybernetic implants to restore her powers before brainwashing and sending her against Diana again. When Diana defeated Vanessa, she convinced one of Cale&#x27;s scientists to remove the implants. Diana then sent Vanessa to Themyscira for surgical recovery.

A Silver Swan was present in &quot;Salvation Run&quot; among the other exiled villains and was seen in &quot;Final Crisis&quot; as a victim of the Anti-Life Equation. Later, she appears in a grouping of Wonder Woman&#x27;s adversaries, all gathered by Circe. The villains are defeated. Later, they are taken into custody by the Department of Metahuman Affairs. It appears this may be a new incarnation of the Silver Swan as Vanessa is later shown having made a complete physical and mental recovery; she is seen graduating from college, with her mother, Steve Trevor, Etta Candy, Vanessa&#x27;s uncle Stavros and Diana herself all in attendance at the ceremony.

====DC Rebirth====
After the events of DC Rebirth, the Silver Swan&#x27;s history was altered. Vanessa Kapatelis was a young woman who Wonder Woman rescued after a battle with Major Disaster. However, during the battle, Vanessa was partially buried under rubble. When paramedics took Vanessa to the hospital, it was revealed that Vanessa had lost the ability to walk. Throughout the next few months, Wonder Woman kept Vanessa company in the hospital alongside Vanessa&#x27;s mother Julia. Vanessa and Wonder Woman grew closer to the point that Vanessa began to fashion the persona of &quot;Silver Swan&quot;, which she dreamed of using to fight crime alongside her idol. 

Vanessa was later approached by doctors about participating in a unique procedure involving nanites that they had learned about from Cyborg. This procedure enabled Vanessa to walk again. Wonder Woman soon visited Vanessa less and less, and when her mother died in a strange car accident, Vanessa thought she had nobody left. Coming to hate Wonder Woman for seemingly abandoning her, Vanessa used her nanites to create a twisted version of her Silver Swan costume and powers to go with it.

After receiving a distress call from a family that she had saved earlier, Wonder Woman traveled to their house only to find the Silver Swan standing over their corpses. Silver Swan then began relentlessly attacking Wonder Woman and her brother, Jason, who joined the fight. Though she proves to be a formidable foe, Diana succeeded in defeating her by causing her to run out of breath from using her sonic scream, forcing her to revert to Vanessa. Her comatose body was placed in the care of S.T.A.R. Labs in a cell designed to hold her in case she transforms. Vanessa is overseen by Doctor Psycho posing as a S.T.A.R. Labs scientist.

When the Sovereign conspired to turn the world against the Amazons, Sarge Steel recruited Silver Swan and several other villains to kill Wonder Woman.

==Powers, abilities, and weapons==
Each Silver Swan has the ability to create powerful sound waves with her voice. Their &quot;swan songs&quot; are capable of devastating a small area of land with their destructive force. By creating a low-level humming, the Silver Swan can form a protective shield around herself that can deflect bullets and projectiles.

Unlike the Pre-Crisis version, whose abilities were acquired supernaturally through the god Mars, the two Post-Crisis Silver Swans need their artificial wings to control their flight motion.

Each version also possesses an additional ability which makes her unique from the other Silver Swans: Helen Alexandros has superhuman strength. It was speculated that Valerie Beaudry had the ability to rearrange matter with her voice (but she never had a chance to be trained in doing so). Vanessa Kapatelis has sharpened nails and the telepathic ability to control birds.

In the DC Rebirth continuity, Vanessa&#x27;s powers stem from an experimental nanite treatment intended to cure her paralysis. Once her mind snaps, the nanites (which are programmed to react accordingly based on Vanessa&#x27;s thoughts) alter her physiology and grant her the cybernetic abilities to become Silver Swan, including a pair of functional wings.

In this form Vanessa can easily match Wonder Woman in a fight and is equipped with a pair of bionic wings which allow her to fly or use their razor-sharp edges to slice through targets. She can also project devastating sonic blasts with her voice and has knife edged claws at the ends of her fingertips. The post-Rebirth iterations Nanites can also be used to hack any and every computerized mainframe in the world, Diana commenting her technological interfacing potentially could rival Cyborg of the Justice League.

==Other versions==
===JLA/Avengers===
Silver Swan appeared in the &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot; miniseries as a villain under Krona&#x27;s control. She attacked the Vision and helped take him down with her magic attacks. After other heroes intervened, the Vision phased his arm through her chest, defeating her. She is then shown bound and gagged by Green Lantern in an emerald energy cell with the other villains, save Sonar who is caught in Wonder Woman&#x27;s lasso.

===Flashpoint===
In the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; universe, Silver Swan joined with the Amazons&#x27; Furies.

===Sensational Wonder Woman===
In the digital-first anthology series &quot;Sensational Wonder Woman&quot;, Silver Swan appears in the story &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Hive&quot;, where she, Blue Snowman, Doctor Poison, and Giganta serve as Queen Bee&#x27;s generals.

<doc id="788417" wikidata="Q64053" url="?curid=788417" title="Efrat (Israeli settlement)">
<text>Efrat (), or previously officially Efrata (), is an Israeli settlement in the West Bank, established in 1983 in the Judean Mountains. Efrat is located south of Jerusalem, between Bethlehem and Hebron, east of the Green Line, at the Palestinian side of the West Bank wall. The settlement stands at an altitude of up to above sea level and covers about 6,000 dunam (1,500 acres). The international community has largely viewed Israeli settlements in the West Bank, referred to by Israel as Judea and Samaria, as illegal under international law. However, Israel disputes this interpretation and maintains that settlements are legal and consistent with international law, citing historical, legal, and security reasons. This position has been upheld by successive Israeli governments.

Considered the capital of Gush Etzion, it had a population of in . Although geographically located within Gush Etzion, it is independent from the Gush Etzion Regional Council, and Palestinians in negotiations do not consider it as part of that block, since it lies to the east of Route 60 — their side of the Geneva Initiative map. Since November 2008, Oded Revivi, an attorney and lieutenant colonel in the army and member of the Likud Central Committee, is the head of Efrat regional council.

==Etymology==
Efrat is named after the biblical place Ephrath. While according to the Israeli Ministry of the Interior, &quot;Efrata&quot; is the quotation from the Biblical verse, and therefore the town&#x27;s name, Efrata&#x27;s residents and municipality have maintained for many years that the reference isn&#x27;t the location&#x27;s name, but rather means &quot;towards Efrat&quot;. This has recently changed, with the residents and municipality convincing the Ministry of the Interior of the correct name. The &#x27;-a&#x27; ending is common in Hebrew and may indicate female grammatical gender or mean &#x27;her&#x27; or less frequent &#x27;towards&#x27;. On the other hand, there are very clear biblical references to &quot;Ephratah&quot;, in a context it cannot possibly mean &quot;towards Ephrat&quot;, e.g. , , , , .
Therefore, there were until recently two names in use: Internal and private references speak of &quot;Efrat&quot;, whereas all inter-city roadsigns, under purview of the national government, read &quot;Efrata&quot; (and still do, not having been updated in light of the recent change).

==Status under international law==
Like all Israeli settlements in the Israeli-occupied territories, Efrat is considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. Most of the international community considers Israeli settlements to violate the Fourth Geneva Convention&#x27;s prohibition on the transfer of an occupying power&#x27;s civilian population into occupied territory. Israel disputes that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies to the Palestinian territories as they had not been legally held by a sovereign prior to Israel taking control of them. This view has been rejected by the International Court of Justice and the International Committee of the Red Cross.

==History==
===Bronze Age===
The area in which Efrat was constructed was the site of an Ancient Israelite settlement during the Bronze Age. Archaeological excavations revealed an ancient Jewish cemetery consisting of a tumulus built over a platform structure and more than twenty Bronze Age burial caves of the shaft tomb type, many of which had been reused over long stretches of time.

===Classical antiquity===
One of the three ancient Judaean aqueducts built by King Herod during the Herodian dynasty of Judea to supply the capital city of Judea, Jerusalem, with enough water to meet the needs of its population of 600,000, mostly Jews along with smaller numbers of Samaritans and Roman soldiers. The aqueduct is known as (), in Hebrew.

===Modern Efrat===
Modern Efrat was established in 1983 by Moshe Moskovits, who became the first mayor of Efrat and Shlomo Riskin, an Orthodox rabbi from New York City who settled in Efrat and became its Chief rabbi. In January 2010, he made headlines, when he declared cigarettes as &quot;treif&quot; and together with Efrat&#x27;s other chief rabbi Shimon Golan issued a prohibition against sale of cigarettes on halachic basis.

Although traditionally considered one of the more politically moderate settlements, in the Knesset elections of November 2022 almost half the residents voted for the far-right Religious Zionist Party.

===Palestinian land claims===
According to ARIJ, Israel confiscated land from four nearby Palestinian villages in order to construct Efrat: 
*2,180 dunams from al-Khader,
*1,713 dunams from Wadi an Nis,
*421 dunams from Artas,
*45 dunams from Khirbet Beit Zakariyyah.

===Land confiscations===

In early 2009, the Israeli Civil Administration declared some 1,700 dunams () of land called “Givat Eitam” (Eitam Hill) by the settlers and “Khallet An-Nahla” by the Palestinians, previously considered part of Bethlehem and the village of Artas to be &quot;state land&quot;, after a military appeals committee approved an August 2004 decision which rejected objections against the confiscation of the land filed by Palestinian landowners. A farm is to be established on the land as a placeholder until a plan to build 2,500 homes on the site can be carried out, which would double the size of the settlement. The land in question is inside the official municipal boundaries of Efrat set in 1999, but outside the separation barrier. Originally, “Givat Eitam” was included on the western side of the barrier, but as the result of deliberations in the High Court of Justice the route had to be changed and excludes “Givat Eitam”. According to &quot;Haaretz&quot;, “it can be expected that the establishment of the farm will be followed by the building of an access road and the deployment of IDF soldiers and other security arrangements, to guarantee the area&#x27;s future role as part of Efrat”.

===Ongoing expansion===

In December 2011, it was reported that the IDF has also agreed to the expansion of Efrat and the Gush Etzion bloc with 40 single-family homes toward the north and north-east on “Givat Hadagan”, replacing the unauthorized trailer park of the campus of Yeshivat Siach Yitzhak on the site. “Givat Hadagan”, originally planned as a neighborhood of 500 homes in the 1990s, is located a few hundred meters from the Dheisheh refugee camp and from the Palestinian town of al-Khader, south of Bethlehem. Ten of the 40 planned houses are to be sold as finished houses comprising up to 160 square meters each, and the buyers of the remaining 30 lots will arrange for the construction of their homes themselves. After they are completed, the Jewish settlements in northern Gush Etzion will reach the edges of Bethlehem&#x27;s southernmost suburbs. Earlier, the construction of 277 homes on a third hill in Efrat, called “Givat Hazayit”, had been approved as a reaction to the UNESCO&#x27;s accepting Palestine as a full member.

After Palestinian gunmen killed one Israeli and injured five Israelis near Ma&#x27;ale Adumim, Israel&#x27;s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich in February 2024 announced a &quot;settlement response&quot; after speaking to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as &quot;any harm to us will lead to more construction and more development and more of our hold all over the country&quot;, with 700 more homes in Efrat slated to be built. American Secretary of State Antony Blinken criticized the announcement, stating that new Israeli settlements are &quot;inconsistent with international law&quot; and &quot;counter-productive to reaching an enduring peace&quot;, risking &quot;Israel’s security&quot;. Israel&#x27;s government in March 2024 fully approved 694 more settler homes for Efrat, reported &quot;Haaretz&quot;.

In February 2025, The Israeli government issued a tender for the construction of 974 houses in the Efrat settlement, expanding the settlement&#x27;s population by around 40%, and blocking the development of Bethlehem. Israeli activist group Ir Amim cites U.S. President Donald Trump&#x27;s public support for &quot;ushering in a wave of settlement expansion&quot;.

==Demographics==
Efrat&#x27;s population are mainly religious Zionist, with a small number of ultra-orthodox and of non-observant residents. There are more than twenty Orthodox synagogues, mainly Ashkenazi, but a Sephardi and a Yemenite synagogue also exist, and there are several Yeshivot, and Kollelim. The population includes native-born Israelis, and immigrants who have made aliyah from the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, France, South Africa, Argentina, The Netherlands, Canada, and Russia.

With a population of around 9,200 residents, Efrat is the largest settlement in the Gush Etzion settlement bloc, one of the settlement blocs that all Israeli governments have said they want to retain under any final-status agreement with the Palestinians.

==Neighborhoods==
Efrat is made up of seven neighborhoods named for the Seven Species: Rimon (pomegranate), Te&#x27;ena (fig), Gefen (grapevine), Dekel (date palm), Zayit (olive), Tamar (date), and Dagan (grain – symbolizing both wheat and barley).

<text>Benjamin Francis Webster (March 27, 1909 – September 20, 1973) was an American jazz tenor saxophonist. He performed in the United States and Europe and made many recording with Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, Johnny Hodges, and others.

== Career ==
=== Early life and career ===

A native of Kansas City, Missouri, he studied violin, learned how to play blues on the piano from Pete Johnson, and received saxophone lessons from Budd Johnson. He played with Lester Young in the Young Family Band. He recorded with Blanche Calloway and became a member of the Bennie Moten Orchestra with Count Basie, Hot Lips Page, and Walter Page. During the 1930s, he played in bands led by Willie Bryant, Benny Carter, Cab Calloway, Fletcher Henderson, Andy Kirk, and Teddy Wilson.

=== With Ellington ===
Webster was a soloist with the Duke Ellington Orchestra starting in 1940, appearing on &quot;Cotton Tail&quot;. He considered Johnny Hodges, an alto saxophonist in the Ellington Orchestra, a major influence on his playing. Gunther Schuller wrote in 1989, that Hodges&#x27; influence pushed him away from his original inspiration by Coleman Hawkins. Webster became close to Jimmy Blanton and Billy Strayhorn, the other two newcomers to Ellington&#x27;s orbit.

Webster&#x27;s personality, however, proved difficult for most members of the orchestra and for Ellington. It was not possible, according to Mercer Ellington, for his father and the saxophonist to be in the same room without an argument developing. Webster cried when he heard Blanton had died, but as baritone player Harry Carney recalled, &quot;After he had a drink or two, he&#x27;d change&quot;. Webster left the band in 1943. Reportedly, he cut one of Ellington&#x27;s sports jackets with a razor as one of his last acts as a member of the Ellington orchestra. Clark Terry said the departure was because Webster slapped Ellington.

=== Later American career ===
Webster worked on 52nd Street in New York City, where he recorded frequently as a leader and sideman. During this time he worked with Raymond Scott, John Kirby, Bill DeArango, Sid Catlett, Jay McShann, and Jimmy Witherspoon. For a few months in 1948, he returned briefly to Ellington&#x27;s orchestra.

In 1953, he recorded &quot;The Consummate Artistry of Ben Webster&quot; (now known as &quot;King of the Tenors&quot;) with pianist Oscar Peterson, who would be an important collaborator with Webster throughout the decade in his recordings for the various labels of Norman Granz. Along with Peterson, trumpeter Harry &quot;Sweets&quot; Edison and others, he was touring and recording with Granz&#x27;s Jazz at the Philharmonic package. In 1956, he recorded an album with pianist Art Tatum, supported by bassist Red Callender and drummer Bill Douglass. &quot;Coleman Hawkins Encounters Ben Webster&quot; with fellow tenor saxophonist Coleman Hawkins was recorded on December 16, 1957, along with Peterson, Herb Ellis (guitar), Ray Brown (bass), and Alvin Stoller (drums). The Hawkins and Webster recording saw the coming together of two giants of the tenor saxophone, who had first met back in Kansas City.

In the late 1950s, he formed a quintet with Gerry Mulligan and played frequently at a club in Los Angeles called Renaissance. It was there that the Webster-Mulligan group backed up blues singer Jimmy Witherspoon on an album recorded live for the Hi-Fi Jazz label. That same year, 1959, the quintet, with pianist Jimmy Rowles, bassist Leroy Vinnegar, and drummer Mel Lewis, also recorded &quot;Gerry Mulligan Meets Ben Webster&quot; for Verve Records.

=== In Europe ===
Webster worked steadily, but in late 1964 he moved to Europe, working with other expatriate American jazz musicians and local musicians. He played when he pleased during his last decade. He lived in London and several locations in Scandinavia for one year, followed by three years in Amsterdam, and made his last home in Copenhagen in 1969. Webster appeared as a sax player in a low-rent cabaret club in the 1970 Danish blue film titled &quot;Quiet Days in Clichy&quot;. In 1971, Webster reunited with Duke Ellington and his orchestra for a couple of shows at the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen; he also recorded &quot;live&quot; in France with Earl Hines. He also recorded or performed with Buck Clayton, Bill Coleman and Teddy Wilson.

Webster suffered a stroke in Amsterdam in September 1973, following a performance at the Twee Spieghels in Leiden, and died on September 20. His body was cremated in Copenhagen and his ashes were buried in the Assistens Cemetery in the Nørrebro section of the city.

Webster&#x27;s private collection of jazz recordings and memorabilia is archived in the jazz collections at the University Library of Southern Denmark, Odense.

Ben Webster used the same saxophone from 1938 until his death in 1973. He left instructions that the horn was never to be played again. It is on display in the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey.

Ben Webster has a street named after him in southern Copenhagen, &quot;Ben Websters Vej&quot;.

== Ben Webster Foundation ==
After Webster&#x27;s death, Billy Moore Jr. and the trustee of Webster&#x27;s estate created the Ben Webster Foundation, a non-profit organization in Denmark.

During the eight years Webster lived in Denmark, he lacked a manager or agent to take care of his artistic rights. In 1972, he joined Billy Moore Jr., arranger for Jimmie Lunceford. Moore clarified Webster&#x27;s recording history to secure his royalties. Moore started the Ben Webster Foundation with the trustee of Webster&#x27;s estate. Webster&#x27;s sole legal heir, Harley Robinson of Los Angeles, gladly assigned his rights to the Foundation.

The Ben Webster Foundation was confirmed by the Queen of Denmark&#x27;s Seal in 1976. In the Foundation&#x27;s trust deed, one of the initial paragraphs reads: &quot;to support the dissemination of jazz in Denmark&quot;. The trust is a beneficial foundation which channels Webster&#x27;s annual royalties to musicians in both Denmark and the U.S. An annual Ben Webster Prize is awarded to a young outstanding musician. The prize is not large, but is considered highly prestigious. Over the years, several American musicians have visited Denmark with the help of the Foundation, and concerts, a few recordings, and other jazz-related events have been supported.

The board of the foundation consists of close friends and fans of Webster. Webster&#x27;s annual royalties are conveyed back to musicians both in Denmark and the U.S. The Ben Webster Prize is awarded annually by vote to one outstanding young musician.

American musicians have visited Denmark to help the foundation by giving concerts. The Board of Trustees monitors Webster&#x27;s artistic rights and reissues of his music. The foundation concentrates on the legality, quality, and validity of these reissues.

In 2009, Ernie Wilkins&#x27;s Almost Big Band opened the Copenhagen Jazz Festival with a concert at the Copenhagen Jazzhouse which included the &quot;All Time Battle of Tenor Saxophones&quot; presented by the Webster Foundation.

<text>Leonard Ray Blanton (April 10, 1930 – November 22, 1996) was an American businessman and politician who served as the 44th governor of Tennessee from 1975 to 1979. He also served three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, from 1967 to 1973. Though he initiated a number of government reforms and was instrumental in bringing foreign investment to Tennessee, his term as governor was marred by scandal over the selling of pardons and liquor licenses.

To date, Blanton is the last governor of Tennessee to serve only a single term in office. He was succeeded by Lamar Alexander.

==Early life and Congress==
Blanton was born near Adamsville, Tennessee, in the community of New Hope, the son of Leonard and Ova (Delaney) Blanton. He was raised in an impoverished sharecropping family with road-building interests. While working with his family&#x27;s road company, he occasionally got into fights at bars in Tennessee and Mississippi, and was once grazed in the neck by a stray bullet. Blanton graduated from Shiloh High School in 1948, and obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in agriculture from the University of Tennessee in 1951. He taught school in Mooresville, Indiana, from 1951 to 1953, when he returned to Adamsville to work in the family construction business, B&amp;B Construction.

In 1964, Blanton was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives, representing McNairy County. He often sat in the back of the House chamber wearing sunglasses during House proceedings.

In 1966, Blanton ran for Congress, challenging 12-term incumbent and former Crump machine ally Tom J. Murray in the Democratic primary for Tennessee&#x27;s 7th congressional district, which was based in Jackson and included Adamsville. In a major upset, Blanton edged Murray for the nomination, winning by just 384 votes out of the nearly 70,000 votes cast. He went on to win the general election, and was twice reelected.

As a congressman, Blanton had relatively poor attendance, sponsored few bills of significance, and served on just two committees: the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee, and the District of Columbia committee. He instead focused on his constituents, namely by trying to acquire funding for projects in Tennessee, including the state&#x27;s first Head Start Program. He spent a great deal of time at his district office responding to voter concerns, and frequently spoke to groups of students. Blanton criticized the anti-war movement, voted against extending the Voting Rights Act, and opposed lowering the voting age to 18.

Tennessee lost a congressional district after the 1970 census, and the legislature merged most of Blanton&#x27;s territory with the neighboring 8th District of popular fellow Democrat, Ed Jones. The merged district retained Blanton&#x27;s district number, but was geographically more Jones&#x27; district. Rather than run against Jones in 1972, Blanton decided to run for the U.S. Senate. He easily won the Democratic primary, and faced the Republican incumbent, Howard Baker, in the general election. Unlike Blanton, Baker had supported the Voting Rights Act and the lowering of the voting age, helping him make inroads among two key constituencies, black voters and young voters. Baker also tied Blanton to the more liberal Democratic presidential candidate, George McGovern. On election day, Baker won in a landslide, 716,534 votes (62%) to 440,599 (38%).

==Governor==

In 1974, Blanton won a twelve-person Democratic primary for governor. With just 23% of the vote, he defeated several well-financed opponents, including flamboyant East Tennessee banker Jake Butcher, Nashville news anchor Hudley Crockett, and former Senator Ross Bass. His opponent in the general election was Lamar Alexander, who had been a campaign manager for the incumbent, Winfield Dunn (the state constitution at the time prevented governors from serving two consecutive terms, so Dunn could not run). Though Dunn and Republicans had broken the Democrats&#x27; dominance of state politics in 1970, the Republican Party was tarnished by the Watergate scandal. On election day, Blanton defeated Alexander, 576,833 (55%) votes to 455,467 (44%).

Following his inauguration, Blanton called for a state income tax, but the state legislature, fearing a revolt from voters, refused to consider it, and instead raised the state sales tax. Blanton overhauled the state&#x27;s excise and franchise tax laws, and revised the state&#x27;s Hall income tax to provide relief for the state&#x27;s elderly residents. He also elevated the state&#x27;s Office of Tourism to a cabinet-level department, making Tennessee the first state in the nation to do so, and upgraded the state&#x27;s retirement system.

Blanton&#x27;s administration was noted for extensive recruiting of foreign industrial and trade opportunities. He made several trips to Africa, the Middle East, Japan, and Europe, in an effort to form economic partnerships with foreign investors. He was criticized for the costs of these trips, but was instrumental in bringing British, West German, and Japanese investment to the state. In 1976, he hosted a meeting with several United Nations representatives in Nashville.

In February 1978, the state constitution was amended to allow Blanton and future Tennessee governors to succeed themselves. Blanton did not run for reelection. His Republican opponent in 1974, Lamar Alexander, won in November.

==Scandals==

Blanton&#x27;s administration was frequently accused of extravagant spending. He accepted a controversial $20,000 pay raise, and often took friends on trips at state expense. He and his aides charged $21,000 to state accounts for bar tabs, limousine rentals, and personal phone calls, though they eventually paid the money back. Blanton was criticized for setting up a large network of county patronage officials, stating they were his political advisers.

His family&#x27;s company was awarded a paving contract at a state park, even though Blanton had assured the company would not do business with the state during his governorship.

In 1977, the &quot;surplus car scandal&quot; erupted when state officials were accused of selling surplus state-owned cars to political allies. Charles Bell, Commissioner of General Services, resigned, and Sonny McCarter, director of the state&#x27;s Surplus Property Division, pleaded guilty to two counts of embezzlement. Transportation Commissioner Eddie Shaw was indicted for his role in the scandal, but was acquitted.

===Pardons and liquor licenses scandals===

In 1977, Blanton fired Marie Ragghianti, chairwoman of the state&#x27;s Board of Pardons and Paroles, when she refused to release prisoners who, as was later determined, had bribed state officials in exchange for obtaining pardons (Ragghianti later sued and won a $38,000 judgment against the state). On December 15, 1978, the FBI raided the state capitol, and seized documents from the office of Blanton&#x27;s legal advisor, T. Edward Sisk. Sisk and two others were arrested, and Blanton appeared before a federal grand jury on December 23, where he denied any wrongdoing.

On January 15, 1979, near the end of his term, Blanton issued pardons to 52 state prisoners, including 20 convicted murderers. Among those pardoned was Roger Humphreys, the son of a Blanton supporter, who had been convicted of killing his ex-wife and a male companion in 1973. As Blanton signed Humphreys&#x27; pardon, he stated, &quot;this takes guts.&quot; The Secretary of State, Gentry Crowell, who was disgusted with the pardons, replied, &quot;some people have more guts than brains.&quot;

While Blanton stated the pardons were to comply with a court order to reduce the state&#x27;s prison population, the FBI and members of both parties grew concerned that the pardons were related to the alleged scandal then under investigation. After U.S. Attorney Hal Hardin (a friend of Blanton) tipped off state leaders that Blanton was planning more pardons, Lieutenant Governor (and Senate Speaker) John S. Wilder and State House Speaker Ned McWherter searched for a way to prevent further damage to the state&#x27;s reputation. They found it in the state constitution, which is somewhat vague on when a newly elected governor must be sworn in. It was eventually decided to swear in Lamar Alexander, who had won the 1978 gubernatorial election, three days before the traditional inauguration day. Wilder later referred to Blanton&#x27;s ouster as &quot;impeachment Tennessee-style&quot;.

Although never formally charged in the pardons matter, Blanton was eventually indicted on charges of mail fraud, conspiracy, and extortion for selling liquor licenses. He was convicted and sentenced to federal prison. Released on July 18, 1986, after serving 22 months, he returned to Tennessee. Although a panel of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals initially reversed the convictions because of the way in which the district court conducted the &quot;voir dire&quot;, that decision was vacated by the court&#x27;s decision to re-hear the case &quot;en banc&quot;. The full Sixth Circuit Court affirmed Blanton&#x27;s convictions, and the Supreme Court denied review. In January 1988, 9 of the 11 charges were thrown out in a separate appeal.

In June 2021, Tennessee officials linked the 1979 murder of Chattanooga businessman Samuel Pettyjohn, who was working with the FBI, to the Blanton administration.

==Later life==
Blanton spent the last decade of his life trying unsuccessfully to clear his name. In 1988, he ran for the retiring Ed Jones&#x27; 8th district congressional seat. He finished far behind the eventual winner, John Tanner, winning just over 10% of the vote. He then became privately employed at a Ford dealership in Henderson.

Blanton died on November 22, 1996, at the Jackson-Madison County Hospital in Jackson while awaiting a liver transplant. He is buried in the churchyard of Shiloh Church, within Shiloh National Military Park (not to be confused with the Shiloh National Cemetery, also located within the park). His grave is marked by a large obelisk.

In 2012, the website RealClearPolitics named Blanton one of the ten most corrupt politicians of all time.

==&quot;Marie&quot;==

A portion of the story of the pardons scandal was made into a book, &quot;Marie: A True Story&quot;, by Peter Maas, author of &quot;Serpico&quot;, and eventually made into the motion picture &quot;Marie&quot; (1985), starring Sissy Spacek in the title role of Marie Ragghianti. Attorney and future U.S. Senator Fred Thompson, who had served as Ragghianti&#x27;s lawyer, launched his acting career in this picture, portraying himself. The pardons scandal, as well as others, are also detailed in the book &quot;FBI Codename TENNPAR&quot;, written by Hank Hillin, the Nashville-based FBI agent who led the investigation into the Blanton administration.

==Family==

Blanton married Betty Littlefield in 1949. They had three children before they divorced in 1979. He is descended from Lewis Wicker, the original owner of the famous cabin before its relocation to replace the George Manse cabin at Shiloh National Military Park. Blanton married Karen Flint in 1988, during his comeback bid for Congress.

<doc id="788441" wikidata="Q870654" url="?curid=788441" title="Movement for France">
<text>The Movement for France (, MPF; ) was a conservative Eurosceptic French political party, founded on 20 November 1994, with a marked regional stronghold in the Vendée. It was led by Philippe de Villiers, once communications minister under Jacques Chirac.

The party was considered Eurosceptic, though not to the extent of seeking withdrawal from the European Union, contrasting with some mainstream Eurosceptic parties such as the UK Independence Party (UKIP). The MPF resisted increases in European integration and campaigned successfully for a &quot;no&quot; vote in the French referendum of 2005 on the proposed European Constitution. It was also strongly opposed to the possible accession of Turkey to the European Union and to what it saw as the Islamisation of France.

The party was a member of President Nicolas Sarkozy&#x27;s presidential majority, which gathered allies of the ruling party Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). However, the party eventually distanced itself from Sarkozy, and party leader Villiers expressed support for Marine Le Pen in the 2017 presidential elections. 

== History ==
=== 1990s === 

Founded in 1994, the party nominated Philippe de Villiers as candidate in the 1995 presidential election. He obtained over a million votes and 4.74% of the popular vote, but failed to pass 5%.

In the 1997 legislative election, the MPF joined forces with the National Centre of Independents and Peasants as &quot;La Droite Indépendante&quot; (LDI). Philippe de Villiers was re-elected, as was one of his allies, who nonetheless left the party soon thereafter.

It contested the 1999 European Parliamentary elections in alliance with the Rassemblement pour la France (RPF) of Charles Pasqua, the combination winning 13 seats, surpassing Nicolas Sarkozy&#x27;s Rassemblement pour la République (RPR) list. 

=== 2000s === 
The MPF formed an alliance with the RPF, but Villiers fell out with Pasqua the following year. Standing by itself in the 2004 European elections, the MPF obtained 7.6% of the popular vote and returned three Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). The party was a member of the Independence and Democracy group in the European Parliament.

Villiers declared his candidacy for the 2007 presidential election and appointed a secretary-general, Guillaume Peltier, then ranked second in the party. He ranked sixth out of twelve candidates, obtaining 2.23% (818,407 votes), down almost 2% from his previous candidacy in 1995. His best scores came in Pays de la Loire with 4.99% and Poitou-Charentes with 3.58%. Unlike in 1995, he failed to win in his department of Vendée, where he obtained 11.28% (over 20% in 1995).

In the 2007 legislative election, MPF candidates ran nationwide, but only one candidate was elected – Véronique Besse in Vendée&#x27;s 4th constituency by the first round. Former MPF member Joël Sarlot was also elected by the first round in the Vendée&#x27;s 5th constituency. Sarlot subsequently lent support to the victorious Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) in the National Assembly. Sarlot&#x27;s election was invalidated in 2007 and Dominique Souchet, a &quot;Villierist&quot; won the ensuing by-election easily. Other candidates, mostly in the south of France obtained important scores. Jacques Bompard, in the 4th constituency of Vaucluse won over 20%.

In the 2009 European Parliament election, the party ran with Hunting, Fishing, Nature, Tradition under the umbrella of the Libertas political movement led by Irish businessman Declan Ganley. It won 4.8% and only Philippe de Villiers was re-elected: Patrick Louis was defeated. The MPF was the only Libertas affiliated party throughout the whole of the European Union to elect MEPs in 2009. The party was member of the Europe of Freedom and Democracy (EFD) group during the 7th European Parliament.

In August 2009, Philippe de Villiers announced that the MPF would join the Liaison Committee for the Presidential Majority, which co-ordinates the member parties of the majority supporting the policies of President Nicolas Sarkozy.

=== Decline (2010s) === 
During the 2010s, the MPF gradually lost all its electoral representation. The party did not take part in the 2012 and 2017 presidential elections. Party leader Villiers expressed his personal support for Marine Le Pen in the 2017 presidential election. The party was dissolved by its secretary-general Patrick Louis on 28 June 2018.

== Ideology ==

The MPF was a souverainist party which supported the national independence of France within a Europe &quot;of peoples and co-operation&quot;. Unlike the United Kingdom Independence Party, it did not support France&#x27;s withdrawal from the EU but rather a massive overhaul of it. The MPF was a strong critic of what it saw as excessive bureaucracy and technocracy in the EU. 

The MPF and Villers, mostly due to their views on Islam and Muslim immigration, have been labeled in world news media such as &quot;CNN&quot;, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, and &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot; as &quot;far right&quot;.

According to its electoral platform, its various proposals included:

=== European Union ===
* Restore the rule of national law over EU law.
* Ceasing negotiations over the accession of Turkey to the European Union, and begin a process of privileged partnership with Turkey and other Mediterranean countries.
* Allow the countries of Europe to form their own, independent foreign policies.
* Follow a policy of respect of national borders and control of immigration.
* Put the national Parliaments in the middle of European construction and giving them veto power on the vital interests of the people which they represent.
* Put the European Union and the euro at the service of the growth and employment.
* Found a European preference for industry and the services, as for agriculture.
* Opposition to the Lisbon Treaty and halting the ratification process.
* Draft a &quot;fundamental treaty&quot; of the European Union based on a free association of independent nations and peoples.

=== Economy ===
* Establishing a &quot;European protectionism&quot; with tariffs on external imports. Within France, it is more neoliberal in supporting lower taxes to encourage the growth of industries within France.
* End the 35-hour workweek
* Liberalization of the fixed retirement age (60)
* Maximum rate of taxation at 38%
* Repealing the solidarity tax on wealth (ISF)

=== Internal issues ===
* Referendum on the re-establishment of the death penalty
* Forbid the wearing of the hijab in public.
* Establishing a moratorium on constructing mosques in France.
* Abolition of the French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM)
* Opposition to same-sex marriage: constitutional amendment establishing marriage as between a man and a woman
* The party supports alternatives to abortion though it does not support forbidding it

== Organization ==
=== Leadership ===


=== Elected officials ===
The MPF elected some representatives, including two deputies (Véronique Besse and Dominique Souchet, part of Non-Inscrits), two senators (Bruno Retailleau and Philippe Darniche, part of RASNAG) and a MEP (Philippe de Villiers, member of the EFD).

The MPF controlled the general council of Vendée, where Villiers served as President of the General Council. It had 10 general councillors in Vendée in addition to one in the Morbihan (Quiberon), one in the Meuse (Charny-sur-Meuse) and two in the Vaucluse (Orange). It claimed 5 regional councillors, most of which were elected on FN lists in 2004.

=== Youth wing === 
The Youth for France (French: &quot;Jeunes pour la France&quot;, JPF) was founded in 2001 by Guillaume Peltier as the party&#x27;s youth organisation. Its successive presidents included Peltier (2001–2006), Jean-Baptiste Doat (2006–2008), Thibaud Vincendeau (2008–2010), Christophe Bentz (2010–2011) and Pierre Meurin (2014–2018). 

== Electoral performance ==
The MPF had little electoral clout and most of its support was concentrated in Philippe de Villiers&#x27; department of Vendée, his electoral stronghold. While most of his support drew on his status as a favourite son, Vendée is also a strongly Traditionalist Catholic department which maintains a sense of pride in the monarchist counter-revolution and the Chouans during the French Revolution. In the 2009 European election, Villiers&#x27; list won the department with 32.96% while polling only 4.8% nationally. In the 2004 European election the MPF won 38.63% and it won 31.9% in the 1999 elections and 34.75% in 1994. However, the MPF is weaker in the department in national elections – such as presidential votes. Philippe de Villiers, who had won 22.02% in his department in the 1995 presidential election (he also got first place) came in fourth place with 11.28% in the 2007 presidential election. His electoral base in the department is his constituency – Vendée&#x27;s 4th constituency – in which he consistently does better than in the department as a whole.

His influence waned, however: through considered to be pro-EU in general, the department voted against the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 due to Villiers&#x27; influence, but it voted for the European Constitution in 2005. It was the only department to switch between a NO vote in 1992 and a YES vote in 2005.

The MPF was also strong in other departments, mostly those neighboring Vendée. In 2009, for example, Villiers&#x27; list won 14.26% in the Deux-Sèvres, a department which is also strongly Catholic. It also won 12.36% in Charente-Maritime, 10.39% in Maine-et-Loire, 9.79% in Charente, 9.29% in Vienne and 8.56% in Loire-Atlantique. Due to Jacques Bompard, it also polled 6.40% in the southeastern Vaucluse department.

<text>Alice Pruvot-Fol (4 August 1873 – 28 March 1972) was a French opisthobranch malacologist.

She was the author of many new species, mostly described on the basis of preserved animals. She described a new species (&quot;Nembrotha rutilans&quot;, Pruvot-Fol, 1931) on the basis of a painted illustration in a book by William Saville-Kent (1893) entitled &quot;The Great Barrier Reef of Australia&quot;. She continued working and naming new species until late in her life. Even in 1962, when she was 89 years old, she named &quot;Phyllidia pulitzeri&quot;.

<text>Hawaiiana is a popular term of academia used in reference to history and various aspects of the culture of Hawaiʻi, currently a region and state of the United States. The term is used especially in reflection of the periods of antiquity and the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi era. Hawaiiana has become increasingly popular among students of history and sociology throughout the world. The principal repository of cultural items from the Hawaiian Islands is the Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum in Honolulu on the island of Oʻahu. The institution is also called the Hawaiʻi State Museum of Natural and Cultural History and often shares artifacts and information with other institutions globally for the sake of research and study.

The term &quot;Hawaiiana&quot; has been in use since 1915, perhaps even earlier, despite the widespread belief Hawaiian entertainer and cultural expert, Nona Beamer, coined the term in 1948.

<text>Matthew Brendan Perry (born 27 January 1977 in Bath, Somerset) is an English former rugby union player who played fullback for Bath. He played internationally for England and the British &amp; Irish Lions.

==Youth and early career==
A cricketer, at Millfield School Perry captained a side including Ben Hollioake, later an England international. He made his debut for Bath&#x27;s first team towards the end of the amateur era in December 1995. Perry went to South Africa to play for the Durban Crusaders&#x27; under-21 side for four months in 1996. This caused him to give up a place at University College, Cardiff. On returning to the UK, Perry rejoined Bath. He played 221 times for the club before retiring in 2007. He played in eight of Bath&#x27;s nine matches in their winning 1997–98 Heineken Cup campaign, being omitted only from the final against Brive in Bordeaux in favour of Jon Callard, where he was named as a replacement.

==England rugby==
England coach Clive Woodward, selected Perry for his first match in charge against Australia in the autumn 1997. Perry was awarded Man of the Match on his debut. In the Rugby Football Union&#x27;s 1997/98 awards, Perry was recognised as the young player of the year.

In 1998, Perry went on England&#x27;s &quot;Tour to Hell&quot; of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. During the 76–0 defeat by Australia, he played out of position at centre. He was part of England&#x27;s squad for the 1999 Rugby World Cup.

Aged 23, Perry beat Jonathan Webb&#x27;s record to become England&#x27;s most capped full back with 35 caps in the position, a record that has since been overtaken by Mike Brown. He went on to score 10 tries for England. A back injury saw him dropped from the England squad for Iain Balshaw; he later made way for both Jason Robinson and Josh Lewsey. Perry made his last appearance for the England senior team in 2001 when he played against France. Perry subsequently went on the 2001 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia, playing in all three tests.

==Later career==
Perry continued to play for Bath after his final England appearance, but was plagued by injuries. He was forced to withdraw from the 2004 Zurich Premiership final due to a calf strain sustained in the pre-match warm-up.

==Retirement==
A bulging disc in Perry&#x27;s back resulted in spasms and sciatic damage in his left leg, and he retired from playing rugby on 27 March 2007. On ending his rugby career, he was reported to be joining a consultancy company. He is the founder and director of the company Transition 15.

==Family==
Perry&#x27;s father Brendan and grandfather Idris also played for Bath. One of Perry&#x27;s grandmothers was from the town of Ballyhaunis in County Mayo, Ireland. He has two sons.

==Charitable support==
Perry is proud ambassador of Wiltshire and Bath Air Ambulance Charity.

<doc id="788457" wikidata="Q3169575" url="?curid=788457" title="Cliopsis">
<text>Cliopsis is a genus of sea angels belonging to the family Cliopsidae. It is monotypic, being represented by the single species Cliopsis krohnii.

==Taxonomy==
The Marine Species Identification Portal recognizes three morphs :
* &quot;Cliopsis krohni&quot; morpha &quot;grandis&quot; ; body length : 40 mm
* &quot;Cliopsis krohni&quot; morpha &quot;krohni&quot; ; body length : 24 mm
* &quot;Cliopsis krohni&quot; morpha &quot;modesta&quot; ; body length : 3 mm

== Description ==
&quot;Cliopsis krohnii&quot; has a somewhat long, flabby, gelatinous body with a bluish aspect. The head is rather small with the nuchal tentacles much developed. The posterior gill possesses four distinct radiating hexagonal crests lacking foldings or fringes. The foot is reduced to three small median lobes. The anterior lobes of the foot show a posterior right angle. The posterior end of the foot has a folded tubercle that is not divided by longitudinal wrinkle in the middle. The distal extremities of the fins are rounded. It lacks a shell except during its early embryonic stage. The small lateral winglike flaps (parapodia) are used in a slow swimming mode.

This species is a highly specialized predator. It preys on pseudothecosomes, such as &quot;Corolla&quot;. On making contact with the wide mucous web of its victim, it grabs the victim with a long proboscis (up to twice its own length), chitinous hooks (with the hook sacs containing about 60 hooks) and cutting radular teeth. They can eat victims three times their own size.

== Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Cliopsis krohnii&quot; is a small free-swimming sea slug, found in all warm and temperate seas where it is pelagic and lives amidst plankton as deep as 1,500 m.

<doc id="788460" wikidata="Q672801" url="?curid=788460" title="List of Solar System probes">
<text>This is a list of space probes that have left Earth orbit (or were launched with that intention but failed), organized by their planned destination. It includes planetary probes, solar probes, and probes to asteroids and comets, but excludes lunar missions, which are listed separately at List of lunar probes and List of Apollo missions. Flybys (such as gravity assists) that were incidental to the main purpose of the mission are also included. Flybys of Earth are listed separately at List of Earth flybys. Planned and proposed missions are in the List of proposed Solar System probes.

== Key ==
Colour key:
* † means &quot;tentatively identified&quot;, as classified by NASA. These are Cold War-era Soviet missions, mostly failures, about which few or no details have been officially released. The information given may be speculative.
* Date is the date of:
:* closest encounter (flybys)
:* impact (impactors)
:* orbital insertion to end of mission, whether planned or premature (orbiters)
:* landing to end of mission, whether planned or premature (landers)
:* launch (missions that never got underway due to failure at or soon after launch)
: In cases which do not fit any of the above, the event to which the date refers is stated. As a result of this scheme missions are not always listed in order of launch.

* Some of the terms used under Type:
:* Flyby: The probe flies by an astronomical body, but does not orbit it
:* Orbiter: Part of a probe that orbits an astronomical body
:* Lander: Part of a probe that descend to the surface of an astronomical body
:* Rover: Part of a probe that acts as a vehicle to move on the solid-surface of an astronomical body
:* Penetrator: Part of a probe that impacts an astronomical body
:* Atmospheric probe or balloon: Part of a probe that descend through or floats in the atmosphere of an astronomical body; not restricted to weather balloons and other atmospheric sounders, as it can also be used for surface and subsurface imaging and remote sensing.
:* Sample return: Parts of the probe return to Earth with physical samples

* Under Status, in the case of flybys (such as gravity assists) that are incidental to the main mission, &quot;success&quot; indicates the successful completion of the flyby, not necessarily that of the main mission.

== Solar probes ==

While the Sun is not physically explorable with current technology, the following solar observation probes have been designed and launched to operate in heliocentric orbit or at one of the Earth–Sun Lagrangian points – additional solar observatories were placed in Earth orbit and are not included in this list:

=== 1960–1969 ===

=== Since 2000 ===

== Mercury probes ==


== Venus probes ==
Early programs encompassing multiple spacecraft include:
* Venera program — USSR Venus orbiter and lander (1961–1984)
* Pioneer Venus project — US Venus orbiter and entry probes (1978)
* Vega program — USSR mission to Venus and Comet Halley (1984)

=== 1961–1969 ===

=== 1970–1978 ===

=== 1982–1999 ===

=== Since 2006 ===

== Earth flybys ==

== Lunar probes ==
:&quot;See List of lunar probes&quot;

== Mars probes ==
Major early programs encompassing multiple probes include:
* Zond program — failed USSR flyby probe
* Mars probe program — USSR orbiters and landers
* Viking program — two NASA orbiters and landers (1974)
* Phobos program — failed USSR orbiters and Phobos landers

=== 1960–1969 ===

=== 1971–1976 ===

=== 1988–1999 ===

=== 2001–2009 ===

=== 2011–2018 ===

=== Since 2020 ===

=== Phobos probes ===
== Ceres probes ==
== Asteroid probes ==


== Jupiter probes ==


=== Ganymede probes ===
== Saturn probes ==

=== Titan probes ===
== Uranus probes ==

== Neptune probes ==

== Pluto probes ==
== Comet probes ==

== Kuiper belt probes ==
== Probes leaving the Solar System ==

== Other probes to leave Earth orbit ==
For completeness, this section lists probes that have left (or will leave) Earth orbit, but are not primarily targeted at any of the above bodies.

<text>Joseph Wilbur Adcock (October 30, 1927 – May 3, 1999) was an American professional baseball player and manager. He played in Major League Baseball as a first baseman from 1950 to 1966, most prominently as a member of the Milwaukee Braves teams that won two consecutive National League pennants and the 1957 World Series.

A two-time All-Star player, Adcock was known for his long distance home runs, including hitting four in one game in . Adcock ranks third in Milwaukee Braves history in hits, home runs, runs batted in and total bases. A sure-handed defensive player, at the time of his retirement in 1966, he had the third-highest career fielding percentage by a major league first baseman (.994). During his major league tenure, he also played for the Cincinnati Reds, Cleveland Indians and the Los Angeles / California Angels.

His nickname &quot;Billy Joe&quot; derived from Vanderbilt University basketball star &quot;Billy Joe Adcock&quot; and was popularized by Vin Scully. Adcock was inducted into the Braves Hall of Fame in 2022.

==Early life==
Adcock was born in Coushatta, Louisiana. He attended Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, playing on its ballclub as the first organized baseball of his life.

==Baseball career==
===As player===
He was signed by the Cincinnati Reds, however All-Star slugger Ted Kluszewski had a firm hold on the team&#x27;s first base slot. Adcock played in left field from 1950 to 1952, but was extremely unhappy, demanding a trade, which he received.

His first season with the Milwaukee Braves was capped by a mammoth home run into the center-field bleachers at the Polo Grounds on April 29, 1953, a feat which had never been done before in an official MLB game and would only be accomplished twice more, by Hank Aaron and Lou Brock.

On July 31, 1954, Adcock 
Became only the seventh player in Major League Baseball history to hit four home runs in a game. He did so against the Brooklyn Dodgers at their home ballpark, Ebbets Field, also hitting a double off the top of the wall to set a record for most total bases in a game (18) which stood for 48 years, until broken by Shawn Green in . Of note, the four home runs were hit off four different Dodger pitchers.

Another notable home run endef the epic duel between Lew Burdette and Harvey Haddix on May 26, 1959, in which Haddix took a perfect game into the 13th inning. Adcock did not get credit for a home run, however, because Aaron – who was on first base – saw Félix Mantilla, the runner ahead of him, score the winning run and thought the hit had only been a double and walked back to the dugout, causing Adcock to be called out for passing him on the base paths. (Eventually, the ruling was that instead of a 3-run home run for a 3–0 Braves victory, Adcock got a double and 1 RBI, and the Braves won 1–0.)

Adcock was often overshadowed both by his own teammates, future baseball Hall of Famers Aaron and Eddie Mathews, and by the other slugging first basemen in the league, Kluszewski and Gil Hodges, although he did make one All-Star team (1960) and was regularly among the league leaders in home runs. In , he finished second in the National League in home runs, runs batted in, and slugging average.

===As manager===
After concluding his playing career with the Cleveland Indians (1963) and Los Angeles/California Angels (1964–1966), Adcock managed the Indians for one year (1967), with the team registering its worst percentage finish in 21 years (.463, vs. .442 in 1946), finishing eighth in a ten-team league. Following the season he was replaced as Cleveland manager by Alvin Dark. Adcock managed two more years in the minor leagues before settling down at his ranch in Coushatta, Louisiana, to raise horses.

====Managerial record====
==Death==
He later died in Coushatta, Louisiana, at age 71 in 1999 as a result of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He is buried in Social Springs cemetery in Red River parish, from Coushatta.

<doc id="788497" wikidata="Q5158327" url="?curid=788497" title="Concentration of measure">
<text>In mathematics, concentration of measure (about a median) is a principle that is applied in measure theory, probability and combinatorics, and has consequences for other fields such as Banach space theory. Informally, it states that &quot;A random variable that depends in a Lipschitz way on many independent variables (but not too much on any of them) is essentially constant&quot;.

The concentration of measure phenomenon was put forth in the early 1970s by Vitali Milman in his works on the local theory of Banach spaces, extending an idea going back to the work of Paul Lévy. It was further developed in the works of Milman and Gromov, Maurey, Pisier, Schechtman, Talagrand, Ledoux, and others.

==The general setting==

Let formula_1 be a metric space with a measure formula_2 on the Borel sets with formula_3.
Let 
:formula_4
where 
:formula_5
is the formula_6-&quot;extension&quot; (also called formula_6-fattening in the context of the Hausdorff distance) of a set formula_8.

The function formula_9 is called the &quot;concentration rate&quot; of the space formula_10. The following equivalent definition has many applications:
:formula_11
where the supremum is over all 1-Lipschitz functions formula_12, and 
the median (or Levy mean) formula_13 is defined by the inequalities
:formula_14

Informally, the space formula_10 exhibits a concentration phenomenon if
formula_16 decays very fast as formula_6 grows. More formally,
a family of metric measure spaces formula_18 is called a &quot;Lévy family&quot; if
the corresponding concentration rates formula_19 satisfy
:formula_20
and a &quot;normal Lévy family&quot; if
:formula_21
for some constants formula_22. For examples see below.

==Concentration on the sphere==

The first example goes back to Paul Lévy. According to the spherical isoperimetric inequality, among all subsets formula_8 of the sphere formula_24 with prescribed spherical measure formula_25, the spherical cap
:formula_26
for suitable formula_27, has the smallest formula_6-extension formula_29 (for any formula_30).

Applying this to sets of measure formula_31 (where 
formula_32), one can deduce the following concentration inequality:
:formula_33,
where formula_34 are universal constants. Therefore formula_35 meet the definition above of a normal Lévy family.

Vitali Milman applied this fact to several problems in the local theory of Banach spaces, in particular, to give a new proof of Dvoretzky&#x27;s theorem.

== Concentration of measure in physics ==

All classical statistical physics is based on the concentration of measure phenomena:
The fundamental idea (‘theorem’) about equivalence of ensembles in thermodynamic limit (Gibbs, 1902 and Einstein, 1902-1904) is exactly the thin shell concentration theorem. For each mechanical system consider the phase space equipped by the invariant Liouville measure (the phase volume) and conserving energy &quot;E&quot;. The microcanonical ensemble is just an invariant distribution over the surface of constant energy E obtained by Gibbs as the limit of distributions in phase space with constant density in thin layers between the surfaces of states with energy &quot;E&quot; and with energy &quot;E+ΔE&quot;. The canonical ensemble is given by the probability density in the phase space (with respect to the phase volume)
formula_36
where quantities F=const and T=const are defined by the conditions of probability normalisation and the given expectation of energy &quot;E&quot;.

When the number of particles is large, then the difference between average values of the macroscopic variables for the canonical and microcanonical ensembles tends to zero, and their fluctuations are explicitly evaluated. These results are proven rigorously under some regularity conditions on the energy function &quot;E&quot; by Khinchin (1943).
The simplest particular case when &quot;E&quot; is a sum of squares was well-known in detail before Khinchin and Lévy and even before Gibbs and Einstein. This is the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of the particle energy in ideal gas.

The microcanonical ensemble is very natural from the naïve physical point of view: this is just a natural equidistribution on the isoenergetic hypersurface. The canonical ensemble is very useful because of an important property: if a system consists of two non-interacting subsystems, i.e. if the energy &quot;E&quot; is the sum, formula_37, where formula_38 are the states of the subsystems, then the equilibrium states of subsystems are independent, the equilibrium distribution of the system is the product of equilibrium distributions of the subsystems with the same T. The equivalence of these ensembles is the cornerstone of the mechanical foundations of thermodynamics.

<text>Neil Jenkins, (born 8 July 1971) is a Welsh former rugby union player and current coach. He played fly-half, centre, or full back for Pontypridd, Cardiff, Celtic Warriors, Wales and the British &amp; Irish Lions. Jenkins is Wales&#x27; highest ever points-scorer and is the fifth highest on the List of leading rugby union test point scorers. He was the first player to score 1,000 points in international matches.

In 2004 Jenkins joined the coaching staff of the Wales national rugby union team and was the kicking skills coach.

==Early life==
Jenkins was born in Church Village near Pontypridd, Wales to a scrap dealer and his wife. He attended Llanilltud Faerdref primary school and then Bryn Celynnog Comprehensive School in Beddau.

==Career==
Jenkins joined Pontypridd in 1990, making his First XV debut on 14 April.

He made his Wales debut aged 19 on 19 January 1991 against England during the Five Nations Championship in Cardiff, a game that Wales lost 25–6, but Jenkins scored his first three points thanks to a penalty. After the Five Nations campaign, Jenkins missed out on a place in the Welsh World Cup squad – the number ten position having been taken up by Mark Ring.

Jenkins&#x27; main strength was his kicking, although he was deceptively quick in his early career. Despite this, he still received tremendous criticism and many felt that he was not worthy enough to inherit the Welsh number 10 shirt of Barry John, Phil Bennett and Cliff Morgan, leading Jenkins to tailor his game to the demands of the modern game. He developed his tackling, passing and running skills, especially under the coaching of Graham Henry, and became an excellent distributor of the ball, notably his excellent flat passes. He was also a strong runner. In November 1993 he managed an international record eight successful penalty kicks at goal in Wales&#x27;s 24–26 defeat to Canada. At the age of just 23, he passed Paul Thorburn to become Wales&#x27;s record Test point scorer in a 29–19 win against Italy, in which he also equalled the record of 24 points in a game he had set against Canada.

Jenkins went on the 1997 British Lions tour to South Africa, playing full back in all three tests. His accurate goalkicking enabled the Lions to beat the Springboks during the first two tests, and thus secure the series 2–1. Across all three Tests he managed 41 points, beating Gavin Hastings&#x27;s previous record of 38.

In the final match of the 1999 Five Nations Championship, Jenkins kicked a conversion in the dying moments of the game to beat England 32–31 at Wembley to deny their English counterparts the title, as Scotland won on points difference, with Wales finishing third. Later that year he also equalled the international record by converting nine penalties in a World Cup warm-up game against France.

In October 2000, Jenkins was made an MBE for services to sport. He picked up the MBE from Buckingham Palace before being flown back to the Welsh capital by helicopter for a rugby match in which he scored all 24 points for Cardiff in their 24–14 win over Saracens.

In 2001, Jenkins became the first ever rugby player to break the 1,000 international points mark, with a 28-point haul featuring a &quot;Full House&quot; of a try, conversion, drop-goal, and penalty against France in Paris.

Jenkins went on the 2001 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia, but was carrying an injury, allowing English fly-half Jonny Wilkinson to become the preferred fly-half and goalkicker. However, Jenkins did gain his fourth Lions cap as a late replacement in the second test.

Kicking always remained his major strength – in the 2003-04 Celtic League, he was successful with a world record 44 consecutive kicks at goal for the now defunct Celtic Warriors.

His final match for Wales was on 1 November 2002 in Wrexham against Romania, with Wales winning 40–3. Jenkins was left out of Wales&#x27; 2003 Rugby World Cup squad, and subsequently announced his retirement from international rugby after an 11-year career.

During his 87 caps for Wales he scored 1,049 points (11 tries, 130 conversions, 235 penalties and 10 drop goals) and a further 41 points (1 conversion and 13 penalties) during his four caps for the British &amp; Irish Lions for a grand total of 1,090 points. He retired as the only player to score over 1,000 points in international rugby. Jenkins&#x27; world record was subsequently broken by Jonny Wilkinson.

Despite the early public criticism, Jenkins has established himself as one of the most recognisable figures in Welsh rugby and many rugby fans hold him in extremely high regard. Although he is no longer the leading points scorer in Test history, he is still considered to be one of the most accomplished goalkickers in rugby.

==Coaching career==

In the autumn of 2004 Jenkins returned to the Welsh Rugby Union in the capacity of Kicking Skills Coach, working with the then newly formed WRU Academies to improve the future generations of outside halves. In the summer of 2006, he returned to the National Squad set up as Skills Coach where he first worked for Gareth Jenkins during the 2007 Rugby World Cup campaign and subsequently Warren Gatland&#x27;s new-look management team.

During the 2007–2008 season, Jenkins helped the Welsh national team to a second Six Nations Grand Slam in four years.

===British and Irish Lions===
On 8 June 2009, Jenkins was appointed as the British and Irish Lions&#x27; specialist kicking coach for their tour of South Africa.

He was then reappointed as a coach for the Lions for their 2013 Tour to Australia alongside Graham Rowntree and head coach Warren Gatland. He was subsequently named in the coaching team for the 2017 and 2021 tours, again alongside Gatland on both, and Rowntree in 2017.

==Off the Field==

In 1999, Jenkins published his autobiography: &quot;Life at number 10: An Autobiography&quot; with freelance journalist Paul Rees just a matter of weeks before breaking the International points scoring record. The book was republished in 2001 by Mainstream Publishing.

Also, on 10 November 2003 a DVD was released as a tribute, called &quot;Jenks – A Rugby Legend&quot;, the DVD tells the story of Jenkins from his start as a working class boy in the Welsh Valleys to the pinnacle of rugby.

In honour of Jenkins&#x27; Testimonial career, the famous Grogg Shop in Pontypridd made a &quot;Limited Edition Testimonial Action&quot; Grogg of Jenkins. Wanting to make something special for the occasion, the Grogg was the first ever to stand on just one leg and took over 6 months to create. Only 100 were made, all of which were hand-painted in a variety of rugby kits – only three of which were in the Lions jersey, one owned by Jenkins, one by his mother and the other by Mike Donald of Ebbw Vale who bought the Grogg at an auction for £4,100.

<doc id="788512" wikidata="Q4549352" url="?curid=788512" title="13 JG 52">
<text>13. Staffel (slowakisches) [[Jagdgeschwader 52]] (13.(slovak)/ JG 52) was a front-line unit of the Nazi Germany&#x27;s Luftwaffe made up of Slovak personnel during World War II.

They operated on the Eastern Front using Messerschmitt Bf 109s (E,F and G), between 1941 and 1943.

==Formation==
The 13th Fighter Flight of the Slovak Air Force was formed in late 1939 as part of a re-organisation of the Air Force to cope with reducing manpower as Czech personnel left for the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. It was equipped with Avia B-534 biplane fighters. In July 1941, Slovakia sent troops to Ukraine to take part in the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, and the Slovak Air Force, including the 13th Fighter Flight, was sent into the Soviet Union in support of the Slovak ground forces. The Slovak fighters escorted Slovak Letov Š-328s and German Henschel Hs 126 reconnaissance aircraft, and attacked ground targets during the advance towards Kiev, but the Slovaks had problems supporting the B-534s owing to shortages of spares and the special fuel used by the fighter&#x27;s engine, and the 13th Fighter Flight was withdrawn back to Slovakia in August 1941.

==Operations with the Luftwaffe==
On 25 February 1942 18 Slovak pilots were sent to Karup, Denmark for conversion training to the Bf 109. In July that year, the pilots returned to Slovakia, where they joined the 13th Fighter Flight based at Piešťany. After re-equipping with Bf 109Es diverted from the Luftwaffe, on 27 October the 13th Flight was deployed to the Eastern Front, where it was attached to the German fighter Geschwader, Jagdgeschwader 52, becoming its 13th Staffel, or 13.(Slow)/JG 52. The unit, equipped with 12 Bf 109Es, operated over the Crimea and the Kuban. It made its first aerial claim on 28 November 1942 when a pair of Bf 109s attacked nine Polikarpov I-153 biplanes, the Slovaks claiming three without loss.

In January 1943, as the Bf 109E was becoming increasingly obsolete, the unit received more modern Bf 109Fs on loan from the Luftwaffe, and in March these were supplemented by Bf 109Gs. As these aircraft were on loan, they retained standard German markings, distinguished by white, red and blue propeller spinners.
13 Staffel flew some 2000 sorties while part of JG 52, claiming between 204 and 215 enemy aircraft shot down, for the loss of seven pilots killed, although the claims may have been exaggerated for propaganda purposes, it being stated post-war by surviving pilots that most of the victories had been fabricated. Three of the unit&#x27;s pilots defected to the Soviets. The leading aces were Ján Režňák with 32 confirmed victories and Izidor Kovárik with 28 confirmed victories.

==Return to Slovakia==
The Slovak unit, which was suffering from poor morale, was withdrawn back to Slovakia in October 1943, leaving the Luftwaffe-owned Bf 109Fs and Gs with JG 52. The 13th Fighter Flight was equipped with a mixture of Bf 109Es and Avia B-534s on its return to Slovakia, where it was based at Vajnory and then Piešťany, tasked with the defense of Bratislava. It re-equipped with factory-fresh Bf 109G-6s in early 1944, operating under the control of the &quot;Jagdfliegerführer Ostmark&quot; (Fighter Leader Austria).

On 26 June 1944 eight Bf 109s of the 13 Fighter Flight engaged an American heavy bomber formation near Bratislava. They managed to shoot down a B-24, and damaging two others before five 109s were shot down by the escorts and two more badly damaged. Three pilots were killed, including the unit commander. These losses virtually wiped out the 13th Fighter Flight, and its surviving aircraft were transferred to the 12th Fighter Flight. This was itself disbanded when German forces disarmed Slovak forces as a result of the Slovak National Uprising.

===BeBe &amp; CeCe Winans===

Youngest brother and seventh sibling Benjamin (BeBe Winans) recorded with younger sister and eighth sibling Priscilla (CeCe Winans) as BeBe &amp; CeCe Winans. Premiering as background vocalists for Andrae Crouch in the 70s, BeBe &amp; CeCe became singers for the PTL Club at Heritage USA in Charlotte, NC. Leaders at The PTL gave BeBe &amp; CeCe a song to sing together, called &quot;Up Where We Belong&quot; from the 1982 movie &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;. Adding a gospel twist, the name and lyrics were changed to &quot;Lord Lift Us Up (Where We Belong)&quot;. 

After singing that song on the popular Christian television show, BeBe &amp; CeCe were requested to sing on television shows, at conferences and in award shows. The two became a duo, releasing their first album in 1984. They have collaborated with greats such as their best friend, Whitney Houston. 

In 1991, they released their album &quot;Different Lifestyles&quot;, through Sparrow, which included the hits &quot;Addictive Love&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s O.K.&quot; Both Bebe and Cece subsequently recorded as solo acts, and have established solo careers. CeCe is the best-selling gospel artist of all time, with 15 Grammys and a host of other awards. She founded the PureSprings Gospel label, which has signed a number of artists, including family members: Delores (&quot;Mom&quot;) Winans, Marvin Winans, and CeCe&#x27;s son, Alvin Love III.

In 1990 they co-wrote and performed a smooth jazz song called &quot;Be With You&quot; for GospelJazz pioneer, Ben Tankard on his &quot;Keynote Speaker&quot; album. The song went #1 on secular radio. 

Their first album, &quot;Angie and Debbie&quot;, was released in 1993 on Capitol Records. It included &quot;Light of Love&quot;, which featured pop diva Whitney Houston on background vocals. Stephanie Mills was featured on background vocals on the song &quot;Father, Father&quot;. Their second album, &quot;Bold&quot; (1997), contained the song &quot;Not Natural&quot;, a song denouncing homosexuality. This led to protests by GLAAD. Angie Winans released a solo project in 2001, &quot;Melodies of My Heart&quot;. Debbie Winans later released a children&#x27;s album.

===Winans Phase 2===
Winans Phase 2 was formed in 1998 and recorded on Myrrh Records. It consists of Marvin Winans Jr., Carvin Winans Jr., Michael Winans Jr., and Juan Winans, the son of Carvin Sr..

<doc id="788540" wikidata="Q2361268" url="?curid=788540" title="Bond valuation">
<text>Bond valuation is the process by which an investor arrives at an estimate of the theoretical fair value, or intrinsic worth, of a bond. As with any security or capital investment, the theoretical fair value of a bond is the present value of the stream of cash flows it is expected to generate. Hence, the value of a bond is obtained by discounting the bond&#x27;s expected cash flows to the present using an appropriate discount rate.

In practice, this discount rate is often determined by reference to similar instruments, provided that such instruments exist. Various related yield-measures are then calculated for the given price. Where the market price of bond is less than its par value, the bond is selling at a discount. Conversely, if the market price of bond is greater than its par value, the bond is selling at a premium. For this and other relationships between price and yield, see below.

If the bond includes embedded options, the valuation is more difficult and combines option pricing with discounting. Depending on the type of option, the option price as calculated is either added to or subtracted from the price of the &quot;straight&quot; portion. See further under Bond option. This total is then the value of the bond.

==Bond valuation==
The fair price of a &quot;straight bond&quot; (a bond with no embedded options; see ) is usually determined by discounting its expected cash flows at the appropriate discount rate. Although this present value relationship reflects the theoretical approach to determining the value of a bond, in practice its price is (usually) determined with reference to other, more liquid instruments. The two main approaches here, Relative pricing and Arbitrage-free pricing, are discussed next. Finally, where it is important to recognise that future interest rates are uncertain and that the discount rate is not adequately represented by a single fixed number—for example when an option is written on the bond in question—stochastic calculus may be employed.

===Present value approach===
The basic method for calculating a bond&#x27;s theoretical fair value, or intrinsic worth, uses the present value (PV) formula shown below, using a single market interest rate to discount cash flows in all periods. A more complex approach would use different interest rates for cash flows in different periods. The formula shown below assumes that a coupon payment has just been made (see below for adjustments on other dates).

:formula_1
:where:
::formula_2 par value
::formula_3 contractual interest rate
::formula_4 coupon payment (periodic interest payment)
::formula_5 number of payments
::formula_6 market interest rate, or required yield, or observed / appropriate yield to maturity (see below)
::formula_7 value at maturity, usually equals par value
::formula_8 theoretical fair value

===Relative price approach===

Under this approach—an extension, or application, of the above—the bond will be priced relative to a benchmark, usually a government security; see Relative valuation. Here, the yield to maturity on the bond is determined based on the bond&#x27;s Credit rating relative to a government security with similar maturity or duration; see Credit spread (bond). The better the quality of the bond, the smaller the spread between its required return and the YTM of the benchmark. This required return is then used to discount the bond cash flows, replacing formula_9 in the formula above, to obtain the price.

===Arbitrage-free pricing approach===

As distinct from the two related approaches above, a bond may be thought of as a &quot;package of cash flows&quot;—coupon or face—with each cash flow viewed as a zero-coupon instrument maturing on the date it will be received. Thus, rather than using a single discount rate, one should use multiple discount rates, discounting each cash flow at its own rate. Here, each cash flow is separately discounted at the same rate as a zero-coupon bond corresponding to the coupon date, and of equivalent credit worthiness (if possible, from the same issuer as the bond being valued, or if not, with the appropriate credit spread).

Under this approach, the bond price should reflect its &quot;arbitrage-free&quot; price, as any deviation from this price will be exploited and the bond will then quickly reprice to its correct level. Here, we apply the rational pricing logic relating to &quot;Assets with identical cash flows&quot;. In detail: (1) the bond&#x27;s coupon dates and coupon amounts are known with certainty. Therefore, (2) some multiple (or fraction) of zero-coupon bonds, each corresponding to the bond&#x27;s coupon dates, can be specified so as to produce identical cash flows to the bond. Thus (3) the bond price today must be equal to the sum of each of its cash flows discounted at the discount rate implied by the value of the corresponding ZCB. 

===Stochastic calculus approach===
When modelling a bond option, or other interest rate derivative (IRD), it is important to recognize that future interest rates are uncertain, and therefore, the discount rate(s) referred to above, under all three cases—i.e. whether for all coupons or for each individual coupon—is not adequately represented by a fixed (deterministic) number. In such cases, stochastic calculus is employed.

The following is a partial differential equation (PDE) in stochastic calculus, which, by arbitrage arguments,
is satisfied by any zero-coupon bond formula_10, over (instantaneous) time formula_11, for corresponding changes in formula_12, the short rate. 

formula_13

The solution to the PDE (i.e. the corresponding formula for bond value) — given in Cox et al. — is:

formula_14

:where formula_15 is the expectation with respect to risk-neutral probabilities, and formula_16 is a random variable representing the discount rate; see also Martingale pricing.

To actually determine the bond price, the analyst must choose the specific short-rate model to be employed. The approaches commonly used are:
* the CIR model
* the Black–Derman–Toy model
* the Hull–White model
* the HJM framework
* the Chen model.

Note that depending on the model selected, a closed-form (“Black like”) solution may not be available, and a lattice- or simulation-based implementation of the model in question is then employed. See also .

==Clean and dirty price==

When the bond is not valued precisely on a coupon date, the calculated price, using the methods above, will incorporate accrued interest: i.e. any interest due to the owner of the bond over the &quot;stub period&quot; since the previous coupon date (see day count convention). The price of a bond which includes this accrued interest is known as the &quot;dirty price&quot; (or &quot;full price&quot; or &quot;all in price&quot; or &quot;Cash price&quot;). The &quot;clean price&quot; is the price excluding any interest that has accrued. Clean prices are generally more stable over time than dirty prices. This is because the dirty price will drop suddenly when the bond goes &quot;ex interest&quot; and the purchaser is no longer entitled to receive the next coupon payment. 
In many markets, it is market practice to quote bonds on a clean-price basis. When a purchase is settled, the accrued interest is added to the quoted clean price to arrive at the actual amount to be paid.

==Yield and price relationships==
Once the price or value has been calculated, various yields relating the price of the bond to its coupons can then be determined.

===Yield to maturity===
The yield to maturity (YTM) is the discount rate which returns the market price of a bond without embedded optionality; it is identical to formula_9 (required return) in the above equation. YTM is thus the internal rate of return of an investment in the bond made at the observed price. Since YTM can be used to price a bond, bond prices are often quoted in terms of YTM.

To achieve a return equal to YTM, i.e. where it is the required return on the bond, the bond owner must:
* buy the bond at price formula_18,
* hold the bond until maturity, and
* redeem the bond at par.

===Coupon rate===
The coupon rate is the coupon payment formula_19 as a percentage of the face value formula_20.
:formula_21
Coupon yield is also called nominal yield.

===Current yield===
The current yield is the coupon payment formula_19 as a percentage of the (&quot;current&quot;) bond price formula_10.
:formula_24

===Relationship===
The concept of current yield is closely related to other bond concepts, including yield to maturity, and coupon yield. The relationship between yield to maturity and the coupon rate is as follows:
==Price sensitivity==

The sensitivity of a bond&#x27;s market price to interest rate (i.e. yield) movements is measured by its duration, and, additionally, by its convexity.

Duration is a linear measure of how the price of a bond changes in response to interest rate changes. It is approximately equal to the percentage change in price for a given change in yield, and may be thought of as the elasticity of the bond&#x27;s price with respect to discount rates. For example, for small interest rate changes, the duration is the approximate percentage by which the value of the bond will fall for a 1% per annum increase in market interest rate. So the market price of a 17-year bond with a duration of 7 would fall about 7% if the market interest rate (or more precisely the corresponding force of interest) increased by 1% per annum.

Convexity is a measure of the &quot;curvature&quot; of price changes. It is needed because the price is not a linear function of the discount rate, but rather a convex function of the discount rate. Specifically, duration can be formulated as the first derivative of the price with respect to the interest rate, and convexity as the second derivative (see: Bond duration closed-form formula; Bond convexity closed-form formula; Taylor series). Continuing the above example, for a more accurate estimate of sensitivity, the convexity score would be multiplied by the square of the change in interest rate, and the result added to the value derived by the above linear formula.

For embedded options, see effective duration and effective convexity; more generally, see .

==Accounting treatment==
In accounting for liabilities, any bond discount or premium must be amortized over the life of the bond. A number of methods may be used for this depending on applicable accounting rules. One possibility is that amortization amount in each period is calculated from the following formula:

formula_25

formula_26 = amortization amount in period number &quot;n+1&quot;

formula_27

Bond Discount or Bond Premium = formula_28 = formula_29

Bond Discount or Bond Premium = formula_30

<doc id="788543" wikidata="Q1305784" url="?curid=788543" title="New York Minute (film)">
<text>New York Minute is a 2004 American teen comedy film directed by Dennie Gordon and starring Mary-Kate Olsen, Ashley Olsen (in her final film), and Eugene Levy, with Andy Richter, Jared Padalecki, Riley Smith, and Andrea Martin in supporting roles. In the film, Mary-Kate and Ashley portray twins with opposing personalities who have a series of adventures around New York City. The film reunited the Olsens with Bob Saget (in a non-speaking cameo) for the first time since they all starred together on the television series &quot;Full House&quot; (1987–1995).

It was released on May 7, 2004, by Warner Bros. Pictures, marking the Olsen twins&#x27; second and final theatrical film release after &quot;It Takes Two&quot; (1995), after years of starring in direct-to-video and television film productions. Consequently, it was the last film featuring both Mary-Kate and Ashley, as the former went on to appear in her own acting projects while the latter quit acting shortly after the film&#x27;s release. This was also the last film to be produced by the Olsens&#x27; Dualstar Entertainment company before it went into dormancy. The film received generally negative reviews from critics and was a box office bomb; however, several publications have since re-evaluated the film as a cult classic in the years after its initial release.

==Plot==
Seventeen-year-old twin sisters Jane, an uptight overachiever, and Roxy Ryan, a rebellious, aspiring rock star, are polar opposites and never see eye to eye after their mother&#x27;s death. They live with their widower father in Syosset, a suburban Long Island town. The two journey into New York City so Jane can deliver a speech for a prestigious college scholarship and Roxy can hand her band&#x27;s demo tape to Simple Plan, who are in town to shoot a music video.

Jane and Roxy board the train into New York but are thrown off after Roxy is found without a ticket. Jane flirts with Jim, and a chip device is mistakenly planted in Roxy&#x27;s bag. Bennie Bang, the man behind the device, offers Roxy a limousine ride, and she accepts, dragging Jane along. He locks them inside, but they escape through the sunroof into the subway. Meanwhile, Max Lomax, an overzealous truant officer, is on the hunt for Roxy.

Jane realizes she has left her day planner in the limo, which has money and the prompt cards for her speech. She and Roxy break into an upscale hotel room to freshen up, where they receive a phone call from Bennie who offers to exchange the chip for the day planner. They meet Trey, the son of a powerful senator staying at the hotel, and his dog, Reinaldo, who swallows the chip.

Roxy heads to the Simple Plan video shoot, Max on her tail, while Jane meets Bennie for the exchange. When he learns the dog has swallowed the chip, he tries to attack Jane, who goes to find Roxy, and kidnaps Trey. Jane, Roxy, and Reinaldo end up in the underground sewer, with Jane&#x27;s speech due to begin in less than two hours.

The girls make their way to a Harlem beauty salon, where they receive makeovers, although Max hunts them down and they escape in a cab and later argue. Jane feels that Roxy has never been there for her and never takes life seriously, leaving Jane in charge after their mother&#x27;s death. Conversely, Roxy believes Jane does not need to take control of everything and feels she is being pushed away.

Jane goes to meet Bennie, who takes her to his mother, the head of a DVD and CD pirating operation. Roxy finds Bennie&#x27;s limo, retrieves Jane&#x27;s day planner, and frees Trey, who is locked in the trunk. They both rush to the building where Jane will give her speech. When they arrive, Roxy poses as Jane so she can give the speech, but drops the prompt cards and has to ad lib. Jane turns up and explains why she was not there. Suddenly, Max and Bennie arrive, Bennie&#x27;s illegal doings are exposed, and he is arrested by Max.

As Jane leaves with Roxy, one of the judges catches up to Jane after finding her prompt cards and gives her a college scholarship to Oxford, because she &quot;didn&#x27;t just want to win, she absolutely refused to fail.&quot; Months later, Roxy is in the studio recording with the band, watched by Jane, Trey, Jim, and even Max (now an official police officer) as they celebrate all together.

==Cast==
== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 11% based on 119 reviews, with an average rating of 3.8/10. The site&#x27;s critics&#x27; consensus reads: &quot;Feels more like a calculated product designed to expand the Olsens&#x27; brand than an actual movie. Also, it contains ethnic stereotyping and sexual innuendo.&quot; At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 33 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper gave the film a &quot;two thumbs down&quot; on the television show &quot;Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot;; in selecting the film as one of the worst of 2004, Ebert remarked that the film &quot;not only should have gone straight to video but should have gone straight &quot;through&quot; video and kept on going to the end of the universe and never looked back.&quot; He added: &quot;&quot;New York Minute&quot; was obviously generated entirely as a vehicle for the Olsen twins, but what kind of a vehicle has no idea where to go, or what to do when it gets there? This movie should have put on the brakes.&quot; 

===Box office===
&quot;New York Minute&quot; earned $5.96 million in its North American opening weekend, finishing in fourth place behind &quot;Van Helsing&quot;, &quot;Mean Girls&quot;, and &quot;Man on Fire&quot;, setting a record-low for a film playing in over 3,000 theatres. The film went on to gross $14.1 million in North America, and $7.2 million internationally, for a worldwide gross of $21.3 million.

<text>A simulation cockpit, simpit or sim rig is an environment designed to replicate a vehicle cockpit. Although many pits commonly designed around an aircraft cockpit, the term is equally valid for train, spacecraft or car projects.

&#x27;Simpit&#x27; is generally used to refer to amateur, home built, setups which are the focus of this article. For more information on commercial flight simulators please see Flight Simulator.

==Aircraft simpits==

By their very nature, aircraft cockpits tend to have complex controls, instrumentation, and radios not present in other types of simulation. Recreating these present specific additional challenges to anyone building a cockpit. Aircraft components are often expensive to purchase, and access to real aircraft cockpits is likely to be restricted due to security concerns, especially in the wake of the 9/11 attacks or if the builder has chosen a current military aircraft.

A way to avoid a lot of the pitfalls is to not replicate a specific aircraft, simply a class of aircraft. Thus creating a generic GA, airliner, or military cockpit, which while it will not have every button or switch of the real aircraft, will have all the key elements for simulation. The other end of the scale is to build an exact 1:1 replica of the real cockpit, using real panels or even a complete cockpit from the chosen plane. All cockpit builds will be somewhere between these two concepts, and even highly accurate replica pits will often make some concessions, if only due to limitations of the simulation software driving them.

For replica pits, the choice of aircraft will be key. With the growth of home cockpits, there are a number of companies who sell complete kits for common aircraft, and the details of current Airbus and Boeing aircraft panels are fairly easy to obtain. For older aircraft, museums or scrap yards can be valuable sources of information. However, while research will often locate a lot of information, sometimes it is a minor detail that is needed. For example, how wide the center pedestal is, how large it should be, or its relative placement in the pit. Where the information is not in the public domain, more subtle techniques have been developed to obtain the information. For example, pixel counting from a digital photo of the aircraft. By counting the pixels in an item of known size, for example, a standard cockpit instrument, a scale can be established. This can then be used to estimate the size of unknown elements in the panel. Accuracy will vary depending on the quality of the photo located, the angle the shot was taken from, etc. However, this can give a good guideline on dimensions in situations where there may be no other source of information.

The level of functionality will also vary within the &#x27;pit&#x27;. Very realistic-looking pits may have nonfunctioning instruments, simply in place to complete the &#x27;feel&#x27; of the cockpit. At the top end of realism would be individual real instruments, either modified from actual aircraft components or replicated. This approach provides the maximum immersion, but presents a dramatic increase in building complexity, with interface electronics needing to be fabricated and the associated software drivers needing to be written. A compromise between the two is to display the instruments on a monitor and mount this behind the panel. The simulated instruments can then be seen through the cutouts which can give a realistic effect, especially if the aircraft uses &#x27;glass cockpit&#x27; displays in real life.

Many pit builders go through the process of building a basic, low-spec compromise pit first, just to give them a dedicated environment to practice their hobby. The lessons learned in this process can be put to good use if they later decide to build a high-spec compromise or replica pit, which requires a great deal of time, effort, and passion to complete.

===General aviation===

Home based simulators have been a common training aid for private pilots for many years. Recently, the increased power of home PCs and improvements in graphics and simulation technology has opened up further opportunities to use a PC as a training aid. In fact, it is now quite easy to achieve a very high-fidelity training experience in one&#x27;s own living room using off-the-shelf commercial products. While early simulators allowed instrument approaches to be practiced, with photographic scenery add ins pilots can now practice visual flights and navigation. Rehearsing a flight in the PC, before performing it in the real world, making training sessions in the real aircraft more productive.

Recognizing this market, a number of suppliers provide ready-to-go desktop simulation products. Radio stacks, instruments, yokes, pedals, throttle quadrants, and seats are readily available from pilot shops. This allows a highly realistic GA cockpit to be put together in a matter of minutes. However an enthusiast is likely to extend well beyond the functional cockpit a trainee would require, adding in items to enhance the suspension of disbelief. Enclosures, projectors, even real aircraft components or nose sections are commonly incorporated in the drive to make the experience as &#x27;real&#x27; as possible.

===Commercial aviation===

While general aviation pits are often put together for real pilots to train on, commercial aircraft pits are often purely for entertainment. Very few people who are not professional pilots ever have the opportunity to pilot a real airliner, but a realistic home simulator will provide a highly immersing experience.

Commercial airliner pits offer a greater challenge to builders as there are more systems to model such as the autopilot, CDU/FMS, engine management, etc. Even the throttle quadrant is a complex piece of engineering compared to the simply replicated push/pull throttle used in the GA Cessna. However, a number of commercial suppliers exist supplying replica panels, controls, even complete cockpits to the community. Where these or &#x27;real&#x27; components are not available or are out of budget builders will often fabricate components at home out of wood or similar easily worked materials.

With most modern aircraft using &quot;glass cockpit&quot; displays it has become easier to create highly realistic panels. The displays on these panels can be driven by multi-head graphics cards, or networked PCs running dedicated software that can read from the simulator spreading the processing load. Interfaces for switches, knobs, and other elements needed can be purchased commercially or created by dismantling existing hardware such as keyboards or joysticks. Feedback from the PC to the panel, for example to light warning lamps or move a real instrument is more complex and normally completed through a commercial expansion board.

===Military aviation===
The third common genre for a simpit is the military pit. Like commercial pits, these sims are typically designed more for entertainment than training. Military-based pits are commonly based on a single aircraft, often the F-16, due to the availability of highly realistic simulation software (Falcon 4.0) of this aircraft.

=== Software ===
One of the first software requirements for a simpit is a suitable flight simulator to provide the graphics, sound and instrument outputs for the pit. To date, the majority of civilian simpits are built around &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot;, and most military pits use &quot;Falcon 4.0&quot; as a base, but as of 2013 the &quot;Digital Combat Simulator&quot; series has spurred interest for the A-10 as well. X-Plane 11 is also a powerful software package, with strong support for multiple screens.

Voice communication (VoIP) software is commonly integrated into a simpit, as this allows real-time communication with other virtual pilots.

Other software may be custom written to control hardware aspects of the pit; e.g. an interpreter for an MFD or a custom listener to implement an AoA Indexer. In many cases the need for custom software can be removed by using control hardware with a comprehensive SDK or API, but frequently an off-the-shelf solution is not available for unique instruments and so citation software is needed.

== Car racing sim rigs ==
In sim racing, the seat, wheel and pedals are often held together via a sturdy frame made from aluminum profiles or similar, such that the parts do not move from each other during. This provides more stiffness and better performance, and can particularly be of importance when using more powerful sim racing equipment such as high-torque direct-drive sim racing wheels or heavy-duty load cell pedals of which some regularly can be used with 100 kg of force. The frame as such becomes the &quot;skeleton&quot; of which the other components of the rig is attached to. Other accessories such as a gear stick or hand brake can also be attached to the same frame as the seat, wheel and pedals.

Many high-quality frames are made of aluminum profiles with T-slots which are modular and can provide good position adjustability for the seat, wheel and pedals. Only the frame itself can in many cases weigh more than 50-60 kg, and can occupy a floor area of 1.4 meter length by 66 cm wide. In addition, extra area is needed for the seat and monitors, and with a common three-monitor setup the whole rig can easily span an area of 1.4 m × 1.4 m.

The height of the rig depends on amongst other things the seating style. A distinction is often made between the upright and more versatile GT or sports car style seating on one hand, and the lower and more specialized near-lying Formula One style seating. Rig heights can vary, but the two mentioned types can for example give total rig height above the floor at 120 cm (GT) or 80 cm (F1). The GT style is more common for several reasons:

* With a GT style seating, the bum is placed higher than the pedals (for example the seating surface can be placed 10 cm to 30 cm higher than the bottom of the pedals), which facilitates for a more comfortable and effective driving posture with between 90 and 120 degrees of bend in the elbows and knees. This provides for a flexible seating position easing manipulation of the steering inputs to the simulator, and is more effective and comfortable to driver over prolonged period.
* Contrary to a GT style seating, and F1 rig is typically shaped such that the bum is placed &quot;lower&quot; than the pedals (for example, the seating surface can be placed 15 cm lower than the bottom of the pedals). In real life, the Formula One seating style is a result of the pursuit for better aerodynamics and lower center of gravity, which are important in real-life racing cars, but do not aid in a comfortable driving posture. Driving in a F1 style posture can be tiring after a while.

Some lower cost wheels have table clamps for mounting to a desk, and loose pedals with rubber feet to provide some kind of friction against a carpet or floor such that the wheel and pedals can be used without a frame. However, even with such inexpensive equipment, a frame can provide considerably more stiffness and rigidity and give a better driving experience. There are also more inexpensive collapsible racing chairs with attachment points for pedals and a wheel. This provides an improvement over loose equipment, and takes up less storage space.

<text>Cayambe or Volcán Cayambe is a volcano in Ecuador, in the Cordillera Central, a range of the Ecuadorian Andes. It is located in Pichincha Province, some northeast of Quito. It is the third-highest mountain in Ecuador, at an elevation of above sea level.

Cayambe, which has a permanent snow cap, is a Holocene compound volcano which last erupted in March 1786. At , its south slope is the highest point in the world crossed by the Equator, and the only point on the Equator with snow cover. The ice cap covers an area of about and there are glaciers on the eastern flank descending to about , whereas those on the drier western flank reach about . The volcano and most of its slopes are within the Cayambe Coca Ecological Reserve.

Cayambe was first climbed by British adventurer Edward Whymper and his two Italian guides and companions Jean-Antoine Carrel and Louis Carrel in 1880. They made first ascents of most of the volcanoes in Ecuador. Cayambe remains a favorite of mountaineers today. The main route runs through a much-fissured terrain of moderate inclination, and only in its final part does the slope increase to 45°. There is a formidable bergschrund to cross at about . On the final stages, there are many cracks and seracs to be overcome, and there are extensive views from the summit.

Cayambe was considered especially beautiful by Alexander von Humboldt, whose writings in turn inspired Frederic Edwin Church to paint the peak, setting the stage for his painting &quot;The Heart of the Andes.&quot;
Cayambe&#x27;s peak is the point of Earth&#x27;s surface farthest from its axis; thus, it rotates the fastest as Earth spins.

<doc id="788555" wikidata="Q2287482" url="?curid=788555" title="Simon Fowler">
<text>Simon Geoffrey Fowler (born 25 May 1965) is an English singer and acoustic guitarist, best known as the frontman of Ocean Colour Scene.

==The Fanatics==
Simon Fowler commenced his music career as the lead singer and songwriter for Birmingham band The Fanatics, which consisted of Simon Fowler (vocals &amp; guitar), Damon Minchella (bass), Paul Wilkes (guitar) and Carolyn Bullock (drums). Future Ocean Colour Scene drummer and former Echo Base band member Oscar Harrison replaced Bullock on drums.

The Fanatics released one record in 1989 before splitting, the four-track &quot;Suburban Love Songs&quot; 12&quot; vinyl EP on Chapter 22 Records (12 CHAP 38), containing the songs &quot;1,2,3,4&quot;, &quot;My Brother Sarah&quot; (later re-recorded by Ocean Colour Scene), &quot;Suburban Love Songs&quot;, and &quot;Tight Rope&quot;. Following the demise of The Fanatics in late 1989, Fowler, Minchella and Harrison teamed up with guitar player Steve Cradock to form Ocean Colour Scene.

==Other works==
Fowler has also appeared as a backing singer for Paul Weller, Alison Moyet, Fine Young Cannibals, and with Kate Rusby.

==Merrymouth==
In 2012 Fowler formed the band Merrymouth with Ocean Colour Scene band member Dan Sealey, and Mike McNamara. Their debut album, &quot;Simon Fowler&#x27;s Merrymouth&quot;, was released in March 2012, and their second album, &quot;Wenlock Hill&quot;, featuring Adam Barry, John McCusker and Chas Hodges, was released in 2014.

==Personal life==

Fowler lives with his long-term partner Robert in Warwickshire. He was educated at Tudor Grange School in Solihull, and later studied at The Sixth Form College Solihull where he wrote &quot;Foxy&#x27;s Folk Faced&quot;. He then became a journalist, working for the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot;. He is a supporter of Birmingham City Football Club.

<doc id="788567" wikidata="Q915693" url="?curid=788567" title="Thermopile">
<text>A thermopile is an electronic device that converts thermal energy into electrical energy. It is composed of several thermocouples connected usually in series or, less commonly, in parallel. Such a device works on the principle of the thermoelectric effect, i.e., generating a voltage when its dissimilar metals (thermocouples) are exposed to a temperature difference.

== Operation ==
Thermocouples operate by measuring the temperature differential from their junction point to the point in which the thermocouple output voltage is measured. Once a closed circuit is made up of more than one metal and there is a difference in temperature between junctions and points of transition from one metal to another, a current is produced as if generated by a difference of potential between the hot and cold junction.

Thermocouples can be connected in series as thermocouple pairs with a junction located on either side of a thermal resistance layer. The output from the thermocouple pair will be a voltage directly proportional to the temperature difference across the thermal resistance layer and also to the heat flux through the thermal resistance layer. Adding more thermocouple pairs in series increases the magnitude of the voltage output. 

Thermopiles can be constructed with a single thermocouple pair, composed of two thermocouple junctions, or multiple thermocouple pairs.

Thermopiles do not respond to absolute temperature, but generate an output voltage proportional to a local temperature difference or temperature gradient. The amount of voltage and power are very small and they are measured in milli-watts and milli-volts using controlled devices that are specifically designed for such purpose.

== Applications ==
Thermopiles are used to provide an output in response to temperature as part of a temperature measuring device, such as the infrared thermometers widely used by medical professionals to measure body temperature, or in thermal accelerometers to measure the temperature profile inside the sealed cavity of the sensor. They are also used widely in heat flux sensors and pyrheliometers and gas burner safety controls. The output of a thermopile is usually in the range of tens or hundreds of millivolts. As well as increasing the signal level, the device may be used to provide spatial temperature averaging.Thermopiles are also used to generate electrical energy from, for instance, heat from electrical components, solar wind, radioactive materials, laser radiation or combustion. The process is also an example of the Peltier effect (electric current transferring heat energy) as the process transfers heat from the hot to the cold junctions.

There are also the so-called thermopile sensors, which are power meters based on the principle that the optical or laser power is converted to heat and the resulting increase in temperature is measured by a thermopile.

<doc id="788569" wikidata="Q4019920" url="?curid=788569" title="William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling">
<text>William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling PC (c. 156712 February 1640) was a Scottish courtier and poet who was involved in the Scottish colonisation of Charles Fort, later Port-Royal, Nova Scotia in 1629 and Long Island, New York. His literary works include &quot;Aurora&quot; (1604), &quot;The Monarchick Tragedies&quot; (1604), and &quot;Doomes-Day&quot; (1614, 1637).

==Biography==

===Early life===
William Alexander was the son of Alexander of Menstrie and Marion, daughter of an Allan Couttie. He was born at Menstrie Castle, near Stirling. The family was old and claimed to be descended from Somerled, Lord of the Isles, through John of Islay. Because his father died in 1580, and William was entrusted to the care of his great-uncle James in Stirling, he was probably educated at Stirling grammar school. There is a tradition that he was at the University of Glasgow; and, according to his friend the poet William Drummond of Hawthornden, he was a student at Leiden University.

As a young man, William became tutor to the Earl of Argyll and accompanied him on his travels in France, Spain and Italy. William married, before 1604, Janet, daughter of Sir William Erskine &quot;The Parson of Campsie&quot;, one of the Balgonie family. 

He was introduced by Argyll to the court of King James VI in Edinburgh, taking on the role of a courtier-poet. He was one of the senior aristocrats who moved to London with the king in 1603 when he became King of England. He received the place of Gentleman Usher to Prince Charles, son of James I of England (James VI of Scotland), in 1603, and continued in favour at court after Prince Charles became Charles I of England in 1625. In 1607, his father-in-law received a pension of £200 a year to be shared with William, and half the pension continued after Erskine&#x27;s death.

William built a reputation as a poet and writer of rhymed tragedies, and assisted King James I and VI in preparing the metrical version known as &quot;The Psalms of King David, translated by King James&quot; and published by authority of Charles I. James knighted him in 1609 and appointed him the Master of Requests for Scotland in 1614, effectively his private secretary. In 1613, he began a correspondence with the poet William Drummond of Hawthornden, which ripened into a lifelong intimacy after their 1614 meeting at Menstrie Castle, where Alexander was on one of his short annual visits.

William Alexander was involved in the silver mines at Hilderston by 1614. In 1615, he was made a member of the Scottish Privy Council. Alexander was an active freemason, belonging to Mary&#x27;s Chapel Lodge, Edinburgh, from July 1634.

===Nova Scotia===

In 1621, King James I granted Stirling a royal charter appointing him mayor of a vast territory which was enlarged into a lordship and barony of Nova Scotia (meaning &quot;New Scotland&quot;); the area is now known as Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and parts of the northern United States. The creation of Baronets of Nova Scotia was used to settle the plantation of the new province, which was later increased (at least on paper) to include much of Canada.

Stirling was appointed as Secretary of State for Scotland in 1626 and held that office for the rest of his life. Lord Stirling&#x27;s efforts at colonisation were less successful, at least in monetary terms, as his recruitment efforts made unrealistic promises about the new territory and were offered on meager terms. He briefly established a Scottish settlement at Charles Fort, later Port-Royal, Nova Scotia, led by his son William Alexander (the younger). However, the effort cost him most of his fortune, and when the region—now Canada&#x27;s three Maritime Provinces and the state of Maine—was returned to France in 1632, it was lost. He was unable to obtain from the treasury, in spite of royal support, £6,000 as compensation for his losses. He spent his later years with limited means. However, Alexander&#x27;s settlement provided the basis for Scottish claims to Nova Scotia, and his baronets provided the Coat of arms of Nova Scotia and Flag of Nova Scotia which are still in use today.

===Long Island===
In 1630, King Charles rewarded his service by creating him Lord Alexander of Tullibody and Viscount of Stirling. Three years later, when Charles was crowned in Holyrood in 1633, he became Earl of Stirling and Viscount Canada, and Earl of Dovan in 1639.

On 22 April 1636, Charles told the Plymouth Colony, which had laid claim to Long Island but had not settled it, to give the island to Alexander. Through his agent James Farret (who personally received Shelter Island and Robins Island), Alexander in turn sold most of the eastern island to the New Haven Colony and Connecticut Colony.

Farret arrived in New Amsterdam in 1637 to present his claim of English sovereignty but was arrested and sent to prison in Holland where he escaped. English colonists attempted to settle at Cow Bay at what today is Port Washington, New York in 1640, but after an alert by Native leader Penhawitz were arrested by the Dutch and released after saying they were mistaken about the title. After 1640, eastern Long Island was quickly settled by the English while the western portion remained under Dutch rule until 1674.

===Death and succession===
Alexander died in London on 12 February 1640. He was succeeded by his grandson William Alexander, 2nd Earl of Stirling (c. 1632 - May 1640), a child who himself died the same year. The 3rd Earl, Henry Alexander (died 1650), was the second son of William Alexander, the 1st Earl.

==Literary works==
Alexander was one of the most highly regarded Scottish poets in early seventeenth-century Scotland and England: he was praised by William Drummond of Hawthornden, Arthur Johnstone, Andrew Ramsey, Michael Drayton, Samuel Daniel and John Davies of Hereford. Alexander&#x27;s earliest work was probably &quot;Aurora&quot; (London, 1604), which was described on its title-page as &#x27;the first fancies of the author&#x27;s youth&#x27; and is a late addition to the corpus of Elizabethan Petrarchan sonnets. His closet dramas - &quot;Croesus, Darius, The Alexandrean,&quot; and &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; - were published together as &quot;The Monarchick Tragedies&quot; (London, 1604; further editions in 1607, 1616, 1637). According to Daniel Cadman, in these plays Alexander &#x27;interrogates the value of republican forms of government and provides a voice for the frustrations of politically marginalised subjects of absolutist regimes&#x27;.

Alexander&#x27;s grandest work is an epic poem describing the end of the world, &quot;Doomes-day&quot;. It was first published in four books (Edinburgh, 1614), and later in twelve (in the collected edition of Alexander&#x27;s work printed in London, 1637). The poem, which contains almost 1,400 eight-line stanzas in total, begins with a synopsis of world history in the First &#x27;Hour&#x27;, then provides long catalogues of the creatures, battle dead, pagans, monarchs, sinners, biblical characters and, finally, members of the heavenly host who will appear at the Final Judgement. Alexander&#x27;s method was indebted to the French Protestant poet Guillaume de Salluste Du Bartas; Drummond acknowledged the kinship in the title of a manuscript poem &quot;Sur les oeuvres poetiques de Guillaume Alexandre, Sieur De Menstre&quot;.

Alexander collaborated with James VI and I on a new paraphrase of the Psalms, composed a continuation to Philip Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Arcadia&quot; that links the end of Book 3 in Sidney&#x27;s incomplete revised version to the ending in the 1593 text, and also wrote down his thoughts on poetry in &quot;Anacrisis: Or a Censure of some Poets Ancient and Modern&quot; (c. 1635). &quot;Anacrisis&quot; begins with a reflection on the pleasure of literature:

:After a great Travel both of Body and of Mind, which (since not voluntary but imposed upon me) was the more painful, by retiring for a Time where I was born [...] being curious, as the most dainty Kind of Pleasure for such as are capable of their Delicacies to recreate myself with the Muses,—I may justly say recreate, since they create new Spirits [...] I conversed with some of the Modern as well as with the Ancients, kindling my Fire at those Fires which do still burn out of the Ashes of ancient Authors.

This passage testifies to the value that Alexander placed on his literary pursuits (which mostly took place at his Menstrie estate) as an activity that was separate from but complementary to his public life as a politician and coloniser. Indeed, the phrase &#x27;recreate myself with the Muses&#x27; re-appeared in the title of the collected edition of his works, &quot;Recreations with the Muses&quot; (1637).

==Legacy==
The Canadian Coast Guard has named the CCGS &quot;Sir William Alexander&quot; in his honour.

<text>Hannover Re (in German &quot;Hannover Rück&quot;) is a reinsurance company based in Hannover, Germany. It is the third-largest reinsurance group in the world, with a gross premium of around €33 billion. Founded in 1966, Hannover Re transacts all lines of property &amp; casualty and life &amp; health reinsurance and has a network of over 170 subsidiaries, branches and representative offices on all five continents with a total staff of more than 3,000. The Group&#x27;s German business is written by the subsidiary E+S Rück.

== History ==
Hannover Re was founded on 6 June 1966.

In the 1970s, the company entered the US and Japanese markets. In 1981, the company made its first acquisition of a foreign insurance group – the Hollandia Group (now Hannover Re Group Africa). In 1990, the acquisition of Hamburger Internationale Rückversicherungs-AG followed.

In 1994, Hannover Re went public. In the same year, the company was the first reinsurer ever to securitise natural catastrophe risks for the capital market.

In 1996, Eisen und Stahl Rück was integrated into the Hannover Re Group. From then on, Hannover Re serves foreign insurance markets, while Eisen und Stahl Rück – now E+S Rück – takes responsibility for handling the German market.

As part of its increasingly international orientation, the legal form of the company was conversed to a Societas Europaea (European Company) in 2013. Hannover Re has since traded as Hannover Rück SE.

In 2019, Jean-Jacques Henchoz succeeded Ulrich Wallin as Chief Executive Officer of Hannover Re.

== Hannover Re Foundation ==
The Hannover Re Foundation was created to mark Hannover Re&#x27;s 25th anniversary in 1991. Its focus was initially – and remains to this day – on supporting contemporary art and culture in the region, especially through the acquisition of artworks which are made available to the Sprengel Museum Hannover on permanent loan. It also lends its support to other cultural institutions based in the region, such as the Kunstverein Hannover, the Kestner Gesellschaft Hannover, the Museum Wilhelm Busch and the Art Museum of Celle. In 2022 the Foundation substantially expanded its self-defined mandate and amended its statutes. Since taking this step, it has extended its support for art and culture to also include projects relating to sustainability. The emphasis is on projects that – in the global context – promote environmental and climate protection, training and education, science and research as well as preventive protection against natural disasters. This also includes the goal of contributing to the creation of intragenerational justice and leaving behind a liveable world for future generations. Since 2023 the Hannover Re Foundation has additionally assumed responsibility for the &quot;Masterclass Students&quot; exhibition series, which was launched back in 2014 in cooperation with Braunschweig University of Art. Since 2023 the Hannover Re Foundation has its own webpage at https://foundation.hannover-re.com 

Hannover Rück SE additionally has its own corporate art collection.

<doc id="788589" wikidata="Q599621" url="?curid=788589" title="Jan Hein Donner">
<text>Johannes Hendrikus (Hein) Donner (July 6, 1927 – November 27, 1988) was a Dutch chess grandmaster and writer. Donner was born in The Hague and won the Dutch Championship in 1954, 1957, and 1958. He took part in the International Chess Tournament (1956), Donner came third, behind Larsen and Darga. FIDE, the World Chess Federation, awarded him the GM title in 1959. He played for the Netherlands in the Chess Olympiads 11 times (1950–1954, 1958–1962, 1968, 1972–1978). He was the uncle of the former Dutch Minister of Social Affairs and Employment, Piet Hein Donner.

On August 24, 1983, Donner suffered a stroke, which he wrote happened &quot;just in time, because when you are 56 you do not play chess as well as you did when you were 26&quot;. After surviving the stroke, he went to live in &quot;Vreugdehof&quot;, which he described as &quot;a kind of nursing-home&quot;. He was unable to walk, but had learned to type with one finger, and wrote for &quot;NRC Handelsblad&quot; and &quot;Schaaknieuws&quot;.

The character Onno Quist in the novel (and film) &quot;The Discovery of Heaven&quot; by Harry Mulisch is based on Donner.

== The columnist ==
Donner was also a chess columnist and writer. He was famous for his outspoken and often outrageous columns about subjects such as women, politics, and fellow Dutch grandmaster Lodewijk Prins, whom Donner claimed &quot;cannot tell a knight from a bishop&quot;.

In 1987, the book &quot;De Koning&quot; (&quot;The King&quot;) was published, which contained 162 of his chess columns, all but the last written between 1950 and 1983, collected by Tim Krabbé and Max Pam. Also in 1987, Donner received the Henriёtte Roland-Holst Prize, one of the Netherlands&#x27; most prestigious literary awards, for &quot;Na mijn dood geschreven&quot; (&quot;Written after my death&quot;), a selection from the mini-columns he had written for &quot;NRC Handelsblad&quot;. On November 27, 1988, Donner died of a gastric hemorrhage. He is buried at Zorgvlied cemetery.

In 2006, New in Chess published an English translation of the complete &quot;De Koning&quot;, entitled &quot;The King: Chess Pieces&quot;. An abridged edition had previously appeared in English in the 1990s.

==Quotes from Donner==

*&quot;I love all positions. Give me a difficult positional game, I&#x27;ll play it. Give me a bad position, I&#x27;ll defend it. Openings, endgames, complicated positions, and dull, drawn positions, I love them all and will give my best efforts. But totally winning positions I cannot stand.&quot;
*Writing of Lodewijk Prins, after Prins had won the Dutch Championship: &quot;He hasn&#x27;t got a clue. He is the worst player in the whole wide world. ... Dear Lodewijk. ... You&#x27;ve won the title and I want to congratulate you. But I think you cannot tell a knight from a bishop and I&#x27;m prepared to prove it, too. ... We&#x27;ll play a match.&quot; Prins declined Donner&#x27;s match offer.
*&quot;After I resigned this game with perfect self-control and solemnly shook hands with my opponent in the best of Anglo-Saxon traditions, I rushed home, where I threw myself onto my bed, howling and screaming, and pulled the blankets over my face.&quot;
*Donner&#x27;s remark about winning from a dead-lost position: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t resist saying something that I had never said before after winning a game of chess. I may have thought it, but I had never said it. I said, &#x27;Sorry.
*&quot;Chess is and will always be a game of chance.&quot;
*&quot;It is mainly the irreparability of a mistake that distinguishes chess from other sports. A whole game long and there is only one point to score. Just one mistake and the battle is lost, even though the fight may go on for hours. ... That&#x27;s why a mistake hits so hard in chess.&quot;
*On playing the black pieces against the move 1.e4: &quot;I don&#x27;t like this move. And they know it.&quot; Donner, &quot;The Master Game&quot;, BBC2
*&quot;How different is chess in the United States. The game of chess has never been held in great esteem by the North Americans. Their culture is steeped in deeply anti-intellectual tendencies. They pride themselves in having created the game of poker. It is their national game, springing from a tradition of westward expansion, of gun-slinging skirt chasers who slept with cows and horses. They distrust chess as a game of Central European immigrants with a homesick longing for clandestine conspiracies in quiet coffee houses. Their deepest conviction is that bluff and escalation will achieve more than scheming and patience (witness their foreign policy).&quot;
*&quot;... it doesn&#x27;t take much insight into human nature to predict that Fischer will not be world champion for long. His quirks, moods and whims will turn against him at the moment when he has reached the top. He&#x27;ll hit out hard, but at nothing but thin air.&quot;
*&quot;The difference between the sexes is remarkable in chess, but not any more so, to my mind, than in any other field of cultural activity. Women cannot play chess, but they cannot paint either, or write, or philosophize. In fact, women have never thought or made anything worth considering.&quot;
*According to Jonathan Speelman:
In round one of the Olympiad China won a famous victory over Iceland. Amongst the casualties was Grandmaster Sigurjonsson who lost to Qi Jung Xuan. Coming upon Sigurjonsson, ... Donner had attempted to console him with the following unfortunate choice of words: &quot;Tell me, Grandmaster, how can a Western European Grandmaster lose to a Chinaman?&quot; In round eight, the Chinese played Holland. And the unlucky Donner got an answer to his question...

*&quot;Computers cannot play chess at all, and they will never be able to, at least not for the next two thousand years or so, for that would take a technology that is still far beyond the horizon ... .&quot;
* &quot;My name is J. H. Donner, &#x27;Hein&#x27; for friends. &#x27;Jan-Hein&#x27; was an unseemly joke of malicious sport journalists, but that&#x27;s not my name, it never was and it never will be.&quot;

<text>Barsuk Records ( ) is an independent record label based in Seattle, Washington which was founded in 1998 by Christopher Possanza and Josh Rosenfeld, the members of the band This Busy Monster, to release their band&#x27;s material. Its logo is a drawing of a dog holding a vinyl record in its mouth.

Barsuk played a key role in shaping the mainstream view of indie rock in its early years, with albums like Nada Surf&#x27;s &quot;Let Go&quot;, The Long Winters&#x27; &quot;When I Pretend to Fall&quot;, and Death Cab for Cutie&#x27;s influential fourth album, &quot;Transatlanticism&quot;. The label also became a platform for Seattle-based singer-songwriters such as Rocky Votolato, Jesse Sykes, and David Bazan.

The name of the label comes from the Russian word &quot;барсук&quot; , &quot;badger&quot;. However, the label is named after Possanza and Jason Avinger&#x27;s dog, a black Labrador. The dog can be heard barking in two This Busy Monster tracks: &quot;Song 69&quot; and &quot;Time to Sleep&quot;.

<doc id="788601" wikidata="Q51792" url="?curid=788601" title="General Grievous">
<text>General Grievous is a character in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise created by George Lucas. He was introduced in the 2003 animated series &quot;Star Wars: Clone Wars&quot; (voiced by John DiMaggio in the second season and Richard McGonagle in the third season), before appearing through computer-generated imagery in the 2005 live-action film &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; (voiced by Matthew Wood). Wood reprised the role in the 2008 animated series &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; and the 2024 anthology series &quot;Tales of the Empire&quot;.

Grievous is depicted as a brilliant military strategist who serves as the Supreme Commander of the Confederacy of Independent Systems&#x27; Droid Armies during the Clone Wars. He is a powerful Kaleesh cyborg who has mastered all forms of lightsaber combat, under the tutelage of Count Dooku, to rival the Force abilities of the Jedi of the Galactic Republic. Grievous harbors an intense hatred of the Jedi, and gains a reputation as a feared and ruthless Jedi hunter who collects the lightsabers of his fallen victims as trophies. He develops a rivalry with Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, whom he clashes with several times during the war, and is killed by Kenobi during their final confrontation in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;.

Entertainment publications described Grievous as among the franchise&#x27;s most iconic villains, and his popularity within the &quot;Star Wars&quot; fandom has earned him a cult following. The character has also appeared in several forms of non-canonical media in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe, including novelizations, comic books, and video games. Some of these works explore his past as Qymaen jai Sheelal, a reptilian warlord whose vendetta against the Jedi began when he blamed them for the plight of his people. A ship crash secretly orchestrated by Dooku mortally wounds Grievous and leads to his reconstruction as a cyborg. This origin story was retroactively altered in &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;, in which it is implied that Grievous willingly augmented his body with cybernetic enhancements to rival the Jedi, although several elements of his original backstory were later reintegrated into the &quot;Star Wars&quot; canon.

==Development==
===Creation and casting===
In 2002, George Lucas conceived of General Grievous as a powerful new villain for &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, specifically envisioning the character as a cyborg droid general to reflect and foreshadow Anakin Skywalker&#x27;s transformation into Darth Vader at the end of the film. The only instruction Lucas gave his art department was to make the character &quot;iconic&quot; and &quot;scary&quot;. Numerous illustrations were developed at Lucasfilm, some purely mechanical and others more alien-like in appearance. One drawing presented Grievous as an eight-year-old alien child on a hover chair guarded by two IG assassin droids, which Lucas rejected for not being threatening enough. Another rejected robotic design was ultimately used for Grievous&#x27; IG-100 MagnaGuards in the film.

Two weeks after Lucas&#x27; instruction to design Grievous, a sketch made by concept artist Warren Fu was chosen and developed by Lucas for the character&#x27;s finalized appearance. Fu took inspiration from the top view of a spray bottle for the design of Grievous&#x27; face. Fu&#x27;s sketch was made into a -tall maquette sculpture which was then refined into a realistic computer-generated model by Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM). This was one of the most complex models ever created by ILM at the time as many of its components were of differing physical qualities. Comparisons have been drawn between Grievous&#x27; appearance and Jacob Epstein&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Rock Drill&quot;.

In the lead-up to &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, Grievous made his first ever appearance in the season two finale of &quot;Clone Wars&quot;. The character&#x27;s voice was provided by John DiMaggio. Grievous would return in a more prominent capacity in the third and final season, with Richard McGonagle replacing DiMaggio in the role.

Numerous actors auditioned for the role of Grievous in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;. Lucas wanted Grievous to sound as if he was speaking through a cybernetic voice box, so every audition was put through the same computerized layer of processing by Matthew Wood, supervising sound editor at Skywalker Sound, to create a &quot;synthesized timbre&quot;. Gary Oldman, a friend of producer Rick McCallum, was initially cast in the role and even completed some voice-over work. Oldman had to drop out of the production due to complications that arose from the rules of union filmmaking in Australia where the film was shot.

Having previously performed voices for other &quot;Star Wars&quot; projects, Wood took Lucas&#x27; feedback on the various auditions he modulated and submitted his own under the pseudonym Alan Smithee. Wood approached Grievous as a &quot;classic villain&quot; and used a gruff and harsh voice with an Eastern European accent for his performance. A &quot;gravelly quality&quot; was added to Wood&#x27;s voice when it was processed. Lucas selected Wood for the role and, since Lucas had bronchitis at the time, he instructed Wood to give Grievous an asthmatic cough; this was intended to emphasize the character&#x27;s organic nature as well as the flawed cyborg prosthetics of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy (which would later be refined for Darth Vader in the original trilogy). Some of the audio effects for Grievous&#x27; cough in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; were recorded by Lucas himself while he had bronchitis. Grievous was created entirely through CGI in the movie. During filming, Grievous&#x27; dialogue was read off-screen while Kyle Rowling wore a motion capture suit to perform the character&#x27;s fight scenes with Obi-Wan Kenobi. Wood would subsequently reprise his role as the voice of Grievous in &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; animated series and numerous video games. During production of the series, Lucas briefly considered revealing that Grievous was actually a disguised Darth Maul (prior to Maul&#x27;s official return in the third season).

===Characterization===
The official &quot;Star Wars&quot; Databank describes General Grievous as &quot;a brilliant Separatist military strategist and a feared Jedi hunter&quot;. He is cruel, cunning, aggressive, murderous, and gains an infamous reputation for his ruthlessness during the Clone Wars. Grievous holds the title of Supreme Martial Commander of the Separatist Droid Armies, making him the absolute leader of the Confederacy of Independent Systems&#x27; military and the second highest-ranking member of the Separatist Alliance (after Count Dooku, the political Head of State). Although aligned with the Separatists, Grievous does not care for their political ideals and has professed that he only participates in the conflict to eliminate the Jedi. He harbors a deep-seated resentment of the Jedi and has a vast collection of lightsabers claimed from his many victims as war trophies. Grievous is also short-tempered and has little tolerance for failure or weakness, as he frequently lashes out against and destroys his own battle droids for their persisting incompetence.

Grievous&#x27; cyborg body was specifically designed to rival the abilities of the Jedi. Standing at 7 ft 1 in (216 cm), his imposing presence serves to instill fear in his opponents to give him a psychological advantage in battle. While he is not Force-sensitive, Grievous has been trained in all forms of lightsaber combat by Count Dooku. Each of his mechanical arms can separate in half, allowing him to wield four lightsabers at once to overwhelm his enemies. His cybernetic enhancements give him exceptional strength, speed and reflexes to outmaneuver Force-users and even the Force itself. In spite of Grievous&#x27; physical and acrobatic prowess, Dooku has advised him to retreat should he lose the elements of surprise and intimidation, and thus his advantage, in a fight against the Force-sensitive Jedi. Grievous often heeds his mentor&#x27;s advice and becomes known as one of the Jedi&#x27;s most elusive adversaries during the Clone Wars.

Grievous first appeared in Genndy Tartakovsky&#x27;s &quot;Clone Wars&quot; before his character traits had been finalized for &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;. According to Tartakovsky, Lucas initially pitched Grievous to him as &quot;this ruthless, totally capable Jedi killer,&quot; but later developed the character into &quot;one of those old B-serial villains who does something bad ... twirls his mustache and then runs off.&quot; The series depicted Grievous as a nigh-unstoppable fighter capable of dispatching multiple Jedi simultaneously with ease, which contradicted the then-upcoming film&#x27;s less powerful portrayal of the character. To reconcile these continuity differences, the series finale of &quot;Clone Wars&quot; sees Mace Windu crush Grievous&#x27; chestplate with the Force, damaging his internal organs and providing a reason for both his hacking cough and his weakened state in the film. However, &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; would later present Grievous with his cough throughout the entirety of its run.

There remain numerous accounts of Grievous&#x27; backstory. Literature in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe written by Warren Fu, the original designer of Grievous, had the general&#x27;s hatred of the Jedi stem from their role in the plight and enslavement of his people. A shuttle crash orchestrated by Dooku and pinned on the Jedi mortally wounds Grievous and leads to his reconstruction as a cyborg. &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; would later suggest that Grievous was denied the right to become a Jedi due to his lack of connection to the Force. Writers Dave Filoni and Henry Gilroy postulated that Grievous volunteered for cybernetic modifications to rival the Jedi that rejected him. In the series, Grievous&#x27; castle displays statues hinting at his gradual progression as a cyborg. Despite this, Filoni elected to keep Grievous&#x27; backstory ambiguous.

==Appearances==
===Film===
====&quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005)====

During the Battle of Coruscant, General Grievous holds the kidnapped Supreme Chancellor Palpatine aboard his flagship, the &quot;Invisible Hand&quot;. Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker infiltrate Grievous&#x27; vessel to rescue Palpatine. After Anakin kills Count Dooku, Grievous traps the Jedi on the battle-torn ship and departs in an escape pod. Grievous succeeds Dooku as the Head of State of the Separatists and has his battle droids take the planet Utapau hostage. At Darth Sidious&#x27; request, he relocates the Separatist Council to the volcanic planet of Mustafar. Grievous is tracked to Utapau by Obi-Wan and the two engage in lightsaber combat while the Republic&#x27;s clone troopers battle the droid armies. Before Grievous can kill him, Obi-Wan uses the Force to summon Grievous&#x27; own DT-57 blaster and shoot the organs housed within Grievous&#x27; chestplate, killing the cyborg general.

===Television===
====&quot;The Clone Wars&quot; (2008–2014; 2020)====
In the first season, Grievous encounters Obi-Wan for the first time when he uses the ion cannons of his flagship, the &quot;Malevolence&quot;, to attack the Republic fleet, but is forced to abandon ship when Anakin sends it crashing into a nearby moon. Grievous&#x27; subsequent plots include launching an attack on a Republic outpost on the Rishi moon, and using a listening station to uncover the Republic&#x27;s military secrets, both of which are thwarted. In light of Grievous&#x27; defeats, Dooku arranges for Kit Fisto, Nahdar Vebb, and a group of clone troopers to infiltrate the general&#x27;s hidden fortress on Vassek to test him. Grievous kills Vebb and the clones, but Fisto manages to escape.

In the second season, Grievous begins forcibly boarding Republic cruisers and captures Eeth Koth of the Jedi Council. When the Jedi launch a rescue mission to free Koth, Grievous duels Obi-Wan and is pursued to Saleucami before escaping.

In the third season, Grievous and Asajj Ventress lead an attack on the Republic&#x27;s cloning facilities on Kamino. Grievous defeats Obi-Wan but Anakin and the clones prevent Ventress from securing the DNA sample of the clones&#x27; template. Grievous later dispatches a group of infiltrator droids to stage a bombing on the Galactic Senate on Coruscant to sabotage a peace agreement between the Republic and the Separatists.

In the fourth season, Grievous is neutralized by the Gungan army while attempting to invade Naboo, but is soon freed in a prisoner exchange after Dooku captures Anakin. Grievous defeats Adi Gallia during his attack on a Republic cruiser, though a rescue team led by Plo Koon frees her from captivity. After Dooku betrays Ventress, he sends Grievous to Dathomir to massacre Ventress and the Nightsister clan. Grievous briefly duels Ventress before foiling Mother Talzin&#x27;s voodoo spell against Dooku and killing Daka, the leader of the Nightsisters.

In the fifth season, Grievous defeats a Republic fleet led by Obi-Wan and wins the battle for control over the Florrum system. He launches a full-scale attack on Florrum and fights pirate leader Hondo Ohnaka, Ahsoka Tano, and a group of Jedi younglings, forcing them to flee.

In the seventh and final season, Grievous leads the Separatist fleet during the Battle of Coruscant after he kidnaps Chancellor Palpatine. An unfinished story arc dubbed &quot;Crystal Crisis&quot; would have seen Grievous obtaining a giant kyber crystal on Utapau. Grievous duels Obi-Wan on his ship who is attempting to take the crystal from him, but Grievous quickly overpowers Kenobi, and takes him as a prisoner. Grievous attempts to execute Obi-Wan, but Anakin who had snuck onto the ship frees him before the execution takes place, and the two attempt to take the crystal back to Coruscant. Pinned down, Obi-Wan, and Anakin destroy the crystal with Grievous escaping as the explosion created by the crystal destroys Grievous&#x27; fleet. 

====&quot;The Bad Batch&quot; (2021–2024)====

General Grievous makes a cameo appearance in the premiere episode of &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;&#x27;s sequel series, &quot;The Bad Batch&quot;. Towards the end of the Clone Wars, Grievous escapes from the Battle of Coruscant after his attempt to kidnap Chancellor Palpatine is thwarted by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. Retreating into the outer rim, Grievous orders his Separatist armies to mount a counterattack against Republic forces across the galaxy.

====&quot;Tales of the Empire&quot; (2024)====

In the season premiere, which takes place during the Separatists&#x27; massacre of the Nightsisters of Dathomir, Grievous fights and kills the Nightsister Selena in front of her daughter Morgan Elsbeth, before mockingly yelling at Morgan to run.

===Comics===
General Grievous appears in the four-issue comic book &quot;Star Wars: Darth Maul–Son of Dathomir&quot;, an unproduced story arc originally intended for the sixth season of &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;. Grievous is sent by Count Dooku to hunt down the rogue Sith lord Darth Maul, who has become a threat to Darth Sidious&#x27; plans. On Zanbar, Grievous defeats Maul and forces him to flee while the droid armies overwhelm Maul&#x27;s Mandalorian Death Watch forces. Grievous and Dooku are later lured into a trap by Maul and Mother Talzin to draw out Sidious. Grievous escapes and rejoins Sidious in attacking Dathomir, where Talzin sacrifices herself to help Maul escape before she is killed by Grievous.

===&quot;Legends&quot;===
With the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels and comics produced since the original 1977 film were rebranded as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.

====&quot;Clone Wars&quot; (2003–2005)====

General Grievous was originally introduced as a mysterious new antagonist in &quot;Chapter 20&quot;, the season two finale of the 2003 &quot;Clone Wars&quot; micro series. He leads the Separatist droid armies on the planet Hypori as they surround a group of seven Jedi, comprising Masters Ki-Adi-Mundi, Shaak Ti, Daakman Barrek, and K&#x27;Kruhk; and Knights Aayla Secura, Tarr Seirr and Sha&#x27;a Gi. Grievous elects to face the Jedi alone and easily bests and kills most of them. Before Grievous can finish off Mundi, a squadron of clone ARC troopers arrives to extract the surviving Jedi. Grievous collects the lightsabers of the fallen Jedi as trophies.

In season three, set three years later, Grievous attacks Coruscant in an attempt to kidnap Chancellor Palpatine. The Jedi Masters defending the Chancellor include Shaak Ti, Roron Corobb and Foul Moudama. Grievous kills Corobb and Moudama, defeats Ti yet again, and manages to capture Palpatine. As Grievous boards his escape shuttle, Jedi Master Mace Windu arrives and uses the Force to crush Grievous&#x27; chestplate, severely damaging his internal organs and giving him his distinctive cough.

====Literature====
General Grievous&#x27;s origin is revealed in the comic book &quot;The Eyes of Revolution&quot; from &quot;Star Wars: Visionaries&quot;. Grievous was originally Qymaen jai Sheelal, an organic reptilian humanoid native from the planet Kalee. The Kaleesh were at war with the rival Huk species and Sheelal was considered a demigod by his people for his victories in the Huk War. He fell in love with a warrior named Ronderu lij Kummar. Following Kummar&#x27;s death during a mission, Sheelal realized that he was destined to forever mourn for her and rechristened himself as Grievous. He became a warlord and his swift attacks against the Huk prompted them to turn to the Jedi Knights of the Galactic Republic for help. Hefty fines and embargoes came down upon Kalee and thousands of Grievous&#x27; people starved and died in poverty. Appealing to Grievous&#x27; hatred of the Jedi and the Republic, San Hill of the InterGalactic Banking Clan enlisted him to serve as their enforcer in exchange for the Banking Clan&#x27;s help in taking on Kalee&#x27;s massive debt. Impressed by Grievous&#x27; abilities as a fighter, Hill and Count Dooku arranged for his shuttle to crash to ensure his permanent servitude to the Separatists. Dooku convinced the mortally wounded Grievous that the Jedi responsible for his homeworld&#x27;s plight were the ones who caused the crash. Grievous accepted Dooku&#x27;s offer to reconstruct him with a cyborg body and became the Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies to seek revenge against the Jedi.

In the third volume of &quot;Clone Wars Adventures&quot;, Count Dooku pits Grievous against Asajj Ventress and Durge to test his abilities. Grievous swiftly defeats the pair and emerges victorious, earning his position as the Supreme Martial Commander of the Separatist Droid Armies.

Grievous starred in his own comic called &quot;Star Wars: General Grievous&quot;, in which he fights Jedi Master T&#x27;chooka D&#x27;oon and his Padawan Flyn. After Grievous kills D&#x27;oon, Kybo returns to the Jedi council with a plan to destroy Grievous once and for all. When the council rebukes his vengeful plan, Kybo decides to take this matter into own hands with disastrous results. Grievous also appears in the comics in &quot;Star Wars: Obsession&quot; issue number 4, in which he is on the world of Boz Pity, where he kills two Jedi, Master Soon Bayts and Jedi Council member Adi Gallia. Though Windu injures Grievous, Dooku is able to save the general so he may fight another day.

In the novel &quot;Labyrinth of Evil&quot;, Grievous plans an invasion of Coruscant alongside Dooku and Sidious. He first appears in the novel watching his hated subordinate Nute Gunray flee from a pursuant Republic Strike Force. Grievous reluctantly saves Gunray by destroying the fighters. Grievous&#x27;s invasion of the planet Belderone would also be thwarted by Anakin and Obi-Wan due to a careless mistake on Gunray&#x27;s part. Though Gunray resorts to lies, Grievous deduces that he is lying and threatens to kill him. Later on the bridge of the &quot;Invisible Hand&quot;, Dooku watches as Grievous spars his elite Magnaguards. Though Grievous wins the fight, Dooku points out several flaws in the general&#x27;s technique while realizing he is partly to blame for the general&#x27;s inadequacies. Grievous soon launches his invasion on the Republic capital of Coruscant in an attempt to kidnap Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, placing himself on the battlefield once again. During the invasion, Grievous battles Mace Windu atop a maglev train while personally trying to capture Palpatine. Though Windu overwhelms Grievous in combat, the cyborg outwits the Jedi Guard and takes Palpatine hostage, setting the stage for &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;.

====Video games====
General Grievous has been featured in numerous &quot;Star Wars&quot; video games, as a boss and occasional playable character.
==Relationships==
===Mentorship tree===
==Reception==
General Grievous has become a fan favorite character and is considered one of the most popular villains in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise.

Several entertainment publications have placed General Grievous in &quot;Top 10 &quot;Star Wars&quot; Villains&quot; lists. While the character&#x27;s limited presence in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; was criticized, his greater role and appearances throughout the Clone Wars in both the 2003 and 2008 animated series were praised for expanding on Grievous&#x27; character.

The character&#x27;s line from &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, &quot;Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection&quot;, has gained popularity as an Internet meme. Amanda Derby from &quot;Screen Rant&quot; wrote: &quot;Greet a Star Wars fan with the words, &quot;Hello there,&quot; and they&#x27;ll likely respond with, &quot;General Kenobi&quot;. This alone is a testament to the popularity of General Grievous. Though it&#x27;s hard to say whether fans love him for his skill or his meme-ability, there&#x27;s no denying that Grievous is a favorite.&quot;

<doc id="788602" wikidata="Q1519734" url="?curid=788602" title="Billington, Bedfordshire">
<text>Billington is a civil parish in Bedfordshire about south of Leighton Buzzard and not far from the Buckinghamshire border. There are two settlements: Little Billington (a hamlet in the west of the parish) and one that is now called Great Billington (straddling the A4146). At the 2021 census, the parish had a population of 359.

The name of the parish is recorded in 1196 as &quot;Billendon&quot;, and may come from Anglo-Saxon language &quot;Billan dūn&quot; = &quot;hill of a man named Billa&quot;. Another theorized original meaning is &quot;hill with a sharp ridge&quot;.
The spelling &quot;Billyngdon&quot; appears in a legal record, dated 1440, where Hugh and Thomas Billyngdon of Billyngdon, Beds, gentlemen, are mentioned.

The village is known for its high density of Travellers, who outnumber the settled community. This community live in privately owned, but permitted, sites in the village, three in Little Billington and one between Billington and the nearby village of Stanbridge.

The centre of Great Billington is Billington Hill, on top of which is the small parish church. The church was originally a small mediaeval chapel; however, in the late 1860s it was enlarged to a church, and a rectory built next to it to house the first incumbent. This was when Billington was first recorded as a parish in its own right. The bell turret of the church (it has no tower) came to the church secondhand, from the church at nearby Linslade, which was being enlarged at the time. The interior of the church is very simple; a small stained glass window in the west wall commemorates Edward Bradshaw, the first rector.

The village once had a common, where the peasants cultivated their own strips of land; the name &#x27;common&#x27; still survives as a field name. It was enclosed at the time of the enclosures, and is today part of a local farm. It is traversed by two public footpaths.

The village contains some half-timbered thatched cottages, in the area around the summit of the hill, and also some old farmhouses and cottages. One of the thatched cottages on top of the hill has the dubious honour of having featured on countless chocolate boxes and biscuit tins. One of the more attractive houses in the village is Walkers Farm, a brick and timber house dating from the 16th century. Its once-thatched roof is now tiled.

During the late 1870s and early 1880 large areas of the village were bought by Arthur Macnamara who built at this time the manor house, and transformed the village into a typical Victorian estate village. The village school, halfway up the hill, was built at this time. It closed in the 1950s.
In the early 20th century a point-to-point course was built on the estate, people came from all over England to attend the race meeting held there. Edward VIII when Prince of Wales was a frequent competitor at the races. The races discontinued after World War II.

==Use of the name Great Billington==
Mapmakers, from Thomas Jefferys in 1765 to the Ordnance Survey in 2006, have consistently written the word &quot;Billington&quot; next to the settlement by the church and the words &quot;Little Billington&quot; next to the hamlet of that name.

In the 1990s, there was a campaign by villagers to use the name &quot;Great Billington&quot;, with a claim that it was always used historically. This is not the case in most books on local history and place-names, but there are examples of earlier use in a will dated 1543, Kelly&#x27;s Directory (&quot;comprising Great and Little Billington&quot;), the Victoria County History (&quot;hamlets of Great and Little Billington&quot;), and the Royal Mail Postcode Directory (either &quot;Great&quot; or &quot;Little&quot; in the official postal addresses). As a result of the campaign, the county council unveiled a new &quot;Great Billington&quot; village sign on 20 June 1997, and some of the road signs at entrances to the settlement now use the name. 
On 1 September 1998 the parish was renamed from &quot;Billington&quot; to &quot;Great Billington&quot;.

&quot;Great Billington&quot; has been used as the name of the whole civil parish, but the parish council now uses the name &quot;Billington&quot; again. The ecclesiastical parish is called &quot;Billington&quot;. On 1 April 2019 the parish was renamed from &quot;Great Billington&quot; back to &quot;Billington&quot;.

==2012 slavery case==

On 11 July 2012, four members from one family were convicted of keeping workers in a state of servitude and forcing them to perform unpaid work. The family, who lived on one of the three travellers&#x27; sites in Little Billington, were found to have controlled, exploited, verbally abused and beaten the men for financial gain. The case was the first successful conviction under new slavery laws, following their introduction in 2010. The men, many of them homeless and addicted to alcohol or other drugs, were recruited outside jobcentres or at soup kitchens, and were promised paid work, food and lodgings. On arrival at the site, their heads were shaved, and they were forced to work up to 19 hours a day in the family&#x27;s paving business. They were routinely abused, underfed, and housed in littered, cramped sheds or horseboxes that were unfit for human habitation, with no heating or running water. One victim was paid just £80 during the 15 years he was with the family. Victims who had managed to escape informed police. In September 2011 armed police raided the site with sniffer dogs and helicopter support, removing 23 men. Although some of the released men subsequently returned to the site, eight testified against the family in court. Two of the accused, a husband and wife, were jailed for 11 years and 4 years respectively.

<text>Hari Mohan Nath Kunzru (born 1969) is a British novelist and journalist. He is the author of the novels &quot;The Impressionist&quot;, &quot;Transmission&quot;, &quot;My Revolutions&quot;, &quot;Gods Without Men&quot;, &quot;White Tears&quot;, &quot;Red Pill&quot;, and &quot;Blue Ruin&quot;. His work has been translated into 20 languages.

== Early life and education ==
Kunzru was born in London, England, to an Indian father of Kashmiri Pandit descent and a British mother. He grew up in Essex and was educated at Bancroft&#x27;s School. He studied English at Wadham College, Oxford, then gained an MA in Philosophy and Literature from University of Warwick. In his teens, Kunzru decided that he did not believe in formal religion or God, and is &quot;opposed to how religion is used to police people&quot;.

== Career ==
From 1995 to 1997, Kunzru worked on &quot;Wired UK&quot;. Since 1998, he has worked as a travel journalist, writing for such newspapers as &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. He was a travel correspondent for &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine, and worked as a TV presenter interviewing artists for the Sky TV electronic arts programme &quot;The Lounge&quot;. From 1999 to 2004 he was also music editor of &quot;Wallpaper*&quot; magazine, and since 1995 he has been a contributing editor to &quot;Mute&quot;, the culture and technology magazine. His first novel, &quot;The Impressionist&quot; (2003), had a £1 million-plus advance and was well received critically with excellent sales. His second novel, &quot;Transmission&quot;, was published in 2004. In 2005 he published the short-story collection &quot;Noise&quot;. His third novel, &quot;My Revolutions&quot;, was published in 2007. His fourth novel, &quot;Gods Without Men&quot;, was released in 2011. Set in the American southwest, it is a fractured story about multiple characters across time. It has been compared to David Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot;. His novel &quot;Blue Ruin&quot; appeared in May 2024.

In 2004 the &quot;supersonic supernatural drama&quot; Sound Mirrors was dramatised as part of the BBC Radio 3 drama strand, The Wire. It was a collaboration between Kunzru and DJ producers Coldcut.

Kunzru was awarded The John Llewellyn Rhys prize for writers under 35, the second-oldest literary prize in the UK, but turned it down on the grounds that it was backed by the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; whose &quot;hostility towards black and Asian people&quot; he felt was unacceptable. In a statement read out on his behalf, he wrote, &quot;As the child of an immigrant, I am only too aware of the poisonous effect of the Mail&#x27;s editorial line ... The atmosphere of prejudice it fosters translates into violence, and I have no wish to profit from it.&quot; He recommended that the award money be donated to the charity Refugee Council.

He is Deputy President of English PEN.

In 2009, he donated the short story &quot;Kaltes klares Wasser&quot; to Oxfam&#x27;s Ox-Tales project, four collections of UK stories by 38 authors. Kunzru&#x27;s story was published in the Water collection.

In 2012, at the Jaipur Literature Festival, Kunzru and three other authors, Ruchir Joshi, Jeet Thayil, and Amitava Kumar, risked arrest by reading excerpts from Salman Rushdie&#x27;s &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, which remains unpublished in India due to fear of controversy. Kunzru later wrote, &quot;Our intention was not to offend anyone&#x27;s religious sensibilities, but to give a voice to a writer who had been silenced by a death threat.&quot; The reading drew sharp criticism from Muslim groups as a deliberately provocative move to gain publicity for the four authors. Kunzru admitted in an interview that the festival organizers asked him to leave as his presence was likely to &quot;inflame an already volatile situation.&quot;

In 2016, Kunzru visited Israel, as part of a project by the &quot;Breaking the Silence&quot; organization, to write an article for a book on the Israeli occupation, to mark the 50th anniversary of the Six-Day War. The book was edited by Michael Chabon and Ayelet Waldman, and published in 2017 under the title &quot;Kingdom of Olives and Ash: Writers Confront the Occupation&quot;. During the Gaza War, he announced that he supports a boycott of Israeli cultural institutions, including publishers and literary festivals. He was an original signatory of the manifesto &quot;Refusing Complicity in Israel&#x27;s Literary Institutions&quot;.

==Personal life==
Kunzru is married to novelist Katie Kitamura, and the couple have two children. Kunzru is fascinated by UFOs and as a youngster often imagined a close-encounter experience with one.

== Honours ==

<text>Vojislav Šešelj (, ; born 11 October 1954) is a Serbian politician and convicted war criminal. He is the founder and president of the far-right Serbian Radical Party (SRS). Between 1998 and 2000, he was the deputy prime minister of Serbia.

He surrendered to the ICTY in February 2003 but his trial did not begin until November 2007. Šešelj&#x27;s trial was marred by controversy: he went on hunger strike for nearly a month until finally being allowed to represent himself, regularly insulted the judges and court prosecutors once proceedings commenced, disclosed the identities of protected witnesses and was penalised on three occasions for disrespecting the court. He did not call any witnesses in his defence.

After spending 11 years and 9 months in detention in the United Nations Detention Unit of Scheveningen during his trial, Šešelj was permitted to temporarily return to Serbia in November 2014 to undergo cancer treatment. He led the SRS in the 2016 elections, and his party won 23 seats in the parliament.

On 31 March 2016, he was acquitted in a first-instance verdict on all counts by the ICTY. The acquittal was appealed by prosecutors from the MICT, a United Nations Security Council agency which functions as oversight program of, and successor entity to, the ICTY. On 11 April 2018, the Appeals Chamber partially reversed the first-instance verdict, finding Šešelj guilty of crimes against humanity for his role in instigating the deportation of Croats from Hrtkovci. He was found not guilty on the remaining counts of his indictment, including all the war crimes and crimes against humanity that he was alleged to have committed in Croatia and Bosnia. Šešelj was sentenced to 10 years in prison, but because of time already spent in ICTY custody, he was not obligated to return to prison. In August 2018 Šešelj appealed the conviction to the MICT Appeals Chamber, but was denied as no evidence of error in the judgement or proceedings was given.

==Early life==
Vojislav Šešelj was born in Sarajevo, PR Bosnia and Herzegovina, FPR Yugoslavia, to Nikola Šešelj (1925–1978) and Danica Šešelj (née Misita; 1924–2007), Serbs from the Popovo Valley region of eastern Herzegovina. His parents wed in 1953 before moving to Sarajevo, where they lived on modest means in adapted housing at the old Sarajevo train station as his father was employed in the state-run ŽTP railway company. His mother stayed at home and took care of her two children, Vojislav and his younger sister, Dragica. A relative on his mother&#x27;s side was Chetnik commander Lt. Col. Veselin Misita.

==Education==
Šešelj began his elementary education in September 1961 at the Vladimir Nazor Primary School before transferring to the newly built Bratstvo i Jedinstvo primary school. A successful student until the fourth grade, he increasingly grew uninterested with the curriculum, realising the minimal effort he needed in order to achieve adequate grades. History was his favourite subject and he generally preferred social sciences to natural ones.

For his secondary education, Šešelj enrolled at First Sarajevo Gymnasium, receiving good grades. He was involved with student organisations in school as the president of the gymnasium&#x27;s student union and later as the president of its youth committee.

Šešelj continued going to youth work actions for summer holidays while at the gymnasium. In 1972 and 1973, he worked as a labourer around the Morava River, building embankments.

===Undergraduate===
After his second level schooling, Šešelj enrolled at the University of Sarajevo&#x27;s faculty of law in autumn 1973. He additionally took part in student bodies becoming a vice-dean counterpart in the student organisation for fifteen months. Controversy followed him again as he openly criticised Fuad Muhić, a candidate for dean, publicly proclaiming Muhić unfit to perform the duties of that position. Muhić still got elected to the post. After being a tutor for freshmen, Šešelj became a course demonstrator, holding two sets of tutorials per week, helping professors with student oral exams as well as with conference papers. In 1975, as part of a university delegation, the 21-year-old Šešelj visited the University of Mannheim in West Germany for two weeks, which was his first trip abroad. He completed his four-year undergraduate studies in two years and eight months.

===Postgraduate===
Immediately after graduating in 1976, Šešelj wanted a job as assistant lecturer at the University of Sarajevo&#x27;s faculty of law; however, no assistant positions were posted at the faculty for the following school year, leaving him with nothing to apply for. Šešelj saw the unusual situation as Muhić&#x27;s personal revenge for Šešelj&#x27;s public criticism.

Realizing his minimal chances of getting hired at the faculty of law in Sarajevo, Šešelj turned his attention to other faculties. While preparing his application for the faculty of law in Mostar (at the time organizationally transforming from a remote unit of Sarajevo&#x27;s law faculty into a separate independent educational entity) where they needed assistants for courses on constitutional law, he learned of an assistant job posting at Sarajevo University&#x27;s faculty of political science for a course called &quot;Political Parties and Organizations&quot; and decided instead to apply there. He had friends, such as Zdravko Grebo, Rodoljub Marjanović, and Milan Tomić, already working at the faculty as assistants, while Grebo&#x27;s mother was the faculty&#x27;s dean.

After learning that the &#x27;Political Parties and Organisations&#x27; course was taught by professor Atif Purivatra, a friend and political companion of Muhić, Šešelj withdrew his application, fearing a rejection that would reflect badly on future vocational efforts. Through Grebo&#x27;s mother, Šešelj learned the faculty was about to establish the department for people&#x27;s defence, where many assistants would be needed.

In parallel, Šešelj began postgraduate studies, enrolling in November 1976 at the University of Belgrade&#x27;s faculty of law. Due to employment obligations in Sarajevo, he did not move to Belgrade, but instead went there two to three times a month to attend lectures and obtain literature. He earned a master&#x27;s degree in June 1977 with a master&#x27;s thesis titled &quot;The Marxist Concept of an Armed People&quot;.

In 1978, he spent two and a half months at the Grand Valley State Colleges in the US in its exchange program with the University of Sarajevo.

Also in 1978, after returning from the U.S., Šešelj began pursuing a doctorate at the Belgrade University&#x27;s faculty of law. After submitting his dissertation in early autumn 1979, he chose specialisation at the University of Greifswald in East Germany. He earned his doctorate on 26 November 1979 after successfully defending his dissertation (doctoral thesis) titled &quot;The Political Essence of Militarism and Fascism&quot;, which made him the youngest PhD holder in Yugoslavia at 25 years of age.

In December 1979 Šešelj joined the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army to serve his mandatory military service and was stationed in Belgrade. He completed his army service in November 1980, but in the meantime he had lost his position at the University of Sarajevo&#x27;s faculty of political sciences.

==Academic career==
===University of Sarajevo===
In the early 1980s, Šešelj began to associate more with individuals from dissident intellectual circles in Belgrade, some of whom had Serbian nationalist political leanings. He repeatedly held Muslim professors at the faculty of political sciences responsible for his situation, openly criticising his former friend Atif Purivatra, as well as Hasan Sušić, and Omer Ibrahimagić, for having harmed his career and denouncing them as Pan-Islamists.

In September 1981 Šešelj rejoined the faculty of political sciences, where he was asked to teach courses on international relations. The faculty of political sciences, as a breeding ground for future politicians, was closely controlled and overseen by the Communist Party, and outspoken Šešelj quickly drew the attention of party officials. He openly supported another prominent intellectual, Nenad Kecmanović, who was himself embroiled in a controversy that drew criticism from some sections of the communist nomenklatura in Bosnia due to his writings in &quot;NIN&quot; magazine.

Still, the biggest controversy was raised when Šešelj came up against faculty colleague Brano Miljuš. A protege of Hamdija Pozderac and Branko Mikulić (SR Bosnia-Herzegovina&#x27;s highest and most powerful political figures at the time), Miljuš was well positioned within the communist apparatus as the secretary of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Communist League&#x27;s Sarajevo branch. Šešelj dissected Miljuš&#x27;s master&#x27;s degree thesis and accused him of plagiarising more than 40 pages in it from the published works by Marx and Edvard Kardelj.

Šešelj criticised the highest political echelons, particularly Pozderac who was the reviewer of Miljuš&#x27;s master&#x27;s degree thesis. A power struggle spilled outside the faculty and into the political institutions and corridors of power. Other faculty members and intellectuals to offer their support to Šešelj included Boro Gojković, Džemal Sokolović, Hidajet Repovac, Momir Zeković and Ina Ovadija-Musafija. The Pozderac side was stronger; Šešelj was expelled from the Communist League on 4 December 1981.

By spring 1982, barely six months after being re-hired, his position at the faculty of political sciences was in jeopardy. He ended up being demoted to the Institute for Social Research (Institut za društvena istraživanja), an institution affiliated with the faculty. Belgrade intellectuals, mostly writers and researchers in the social sciences, came to his defence by writing letters of protest to the government of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to the .

He became critical of the way in which the national question was dealt with in Yugoslavia: he spoke out in favour of the use of force against Kosovo Albanians and denounced the passivity of the Serbian political leadership in handling the Kosovo crisis. In his view the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina were not a nation but a religious group. He expressed his concern of seeing Bosnia and Herzegovina turn into a republic dominated by Muslims.

He began to be spied on by UDBA agents. Šešelj&#x27;s first arrest took place on 8 February 1984, the second day of the Sarajevo Olympics. He was on a train from Sarajevo heading to Belgrade when the secret police burst on board around Podlugovi station and seized some of his writings that he had in the suitcase. Among the agents handling his arrest that day was Dragan Kijac (later Republika Srpska state security chief).

In Doboj, Šešelj was taken off the train, transferred into a police Mercedes, and transported to Belgrade where he was questioned for 27 hours before being released and informed that he would be contacted again. After getting back to Sarajevo, UDBA took him in twice more for questionings, which were handled by Rašid Musić and Milan Krnjajić. According to Šešelj, they had the transcripts of the various conversations he had with some of his closest friends in which he and his friends openly criticised subjects ranging from specific political figures and the communist regime in general, and were trying to get him to implicate them as a basis for &quot;a group trial for ethnic balance purposes, [...] a Serbian group to persecute since they just convicted Izetbegović&#x27;s Muslim one.&quot;

On 20 April 1984, he was arrested at a private apartment in Belgrade among the group of 28 individuals during the lecture given by Milovan Đilas as part of Free University, a semi-clandestine organisation that gathered intellectuals critical of the communist regime. Šešelj spent four days in prison before being released.

===Prison===
However, Šešelj was a free man for barely three weeks. In mid-May 1984, Stane Dolanc, the Slovene representative in Yugoslav Presidency and longtime state security chief, gave an interview to TV Belgrade regarding Šešelj&#x27;s unpublished manuscript, &quot;Odgovori na anketu-intervju: Šta da se radi?&quot; in which Šešelj calls for &quot;reorganization of the Yugoslav federalism, SFR Yugoslavia with only four constituent republics (Serbia, Macedonia, Croatia and Slovenia), abolishing of the single-party system, and the abolishing of artificial nationalities&quot;.

Two days later, on 15 May 1984, Šešelj was arrested again in Sarajevo. Several days after being jailed at Sarajevo&#x27;s Central Prison, he began a hunger strike, which attracted the attention of the foreign press. In jail, he passed the time by reading without devoting much effort to preparing his defence at the impending trial. A few weeks later, his then wife Vesna Mudreša gave birth to their first child – a boy named Nikola, after Šešelj&#x27;s father – however, Šešelj refused to end the hunger strike even after being told this. Weak, frail, and with rapidly deteriorating overall health, he eventually relented on the last day of the trial, ending the strike after 48 days.

Several days later, on 9 July 1984, he was given an eight-year sentence. The verdict delivered by presiding judge Milorad Potparić concluded that Šešelj &quot;acted from the anarcho-liberal and nationalist platform thereby committing the criminal act of counterrevolutionary endangerment of the social order&quot;. The single most incriminating piece of evidence cited by the court was the unpublished manuscript that the secret police found in Šešelj&#x27;s home. On appeal, the Supreme Court of SFR Yugoslavia reduced the sentence to six years, then to four, and finally two.

Šešelj served the first eight months of his sentence in Sarajevo before getting transferred to prison in Zenica in January 1985, where he was placed in quarantine and isolated from other inmates for three weeks while medical checks and general psychological observation were conducted in order to come up with a rehabilitation plan and program during his prison stay. From the start he informed the prison officials of his refusal to do any labour, reasoning that &quot;since jailed communists didn&#x27;t have to do prison labour in the pre-World War II capitalist Yugoslavia, I too, as someone espousing anti-communist ideology, refuse to do labour in a communist prison&quot;.

His conduct earned him multiple stays in solitary confinement that initially lasted two weeks but were later extended to a whole month. During his first solitary confinement stay he went on another hunger strike. A week into his strike, he was beaten by the guards in an effort to force him to stop, but he did not, lasting 16 days without food. In total, out of his fourteen months in Zenica, six and a half were spent in solitary confinement. He was released in March 1986 – two months early due to continuous pressure, protests and petitions by intellectuals throughout Yugoslavia and abroad, many of whom would later become his political opponents. Upon release from prison, Šešelj permanently moved to Belgrade. According to John Mueller, Šešelj &quot;later seems to have become mentally unbalanced as the result of the torture and beatings he endured while in prison&quot;.

==Political career==

In 1989, Šešelj returned to the United States where Momčilo Đujić, a Chetnik leader from World War II living there in exile, bestowed on Šešelj the title &quot;Chetnik vojvoda&quot; (Vojvoda of the Chetniks), the first since World War II, to make a &quot;unitary Serbian state where all Serbs would live, occupying all the Serb lands&quot;. In 1998, Đujić said that he regretted awarding the title to Šešelj on account of his involvement with Slobodan Milošević. Together with Vuk Drašković and Mirko Jović, Šešelj founded the anti-communist Chetnik party Serbian National Renewal (SNO) in late 1989. In the late 1980s, Šešelj made calls for 360,000 Albanians to be deported from Kosovo.

In March 1990, together with Drašković, he however went on to form the monarchist party Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO). that he soon left again to form the more radical Serbian Chetnik Movement (SČP). Because of its name the party was denied registration, but was merged in March 1991 with the National Radical Party (NRS) creating the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) under his presidency. He has described himself and his supporters as &quot;not fascists, just chauvinists who hate Croats.&quot;

In late 1991, during the Battle of Vukovar, Šešelj went to Borovo Selo to meet with a Serbian Orthodox Church bishop and publicly described Croats as a genocidal and perverted people.

The paramilitary group White Eagles active at the time in the Yugoslav Wars was reportedly associated with him, being referred to as &quot;Šešeljevci&quot; (&quot;Šešelj&#x27;s men&quot;). This association has been denied several times by Šešelj.

In May and July 1992, Šešelj visited the Vojvodina village of Hrtkovci and initiated a campaign of persecution of local ethnic Croats.

In the elections of December 1992, the SRS won 27 per cent of the vote versus the 40 per cent won by the Socialist Party of President Slobodan Milošević. Šešelj&#x27;s relationship with Milošević was amicable during the first years of the Yugoslav Wars.

Šešelj and his party were in effect Milošević&#x27;s close allies who helped them orchestrate the mass layoffs of journalists in 1992, and Šešelj publicly proclaimed their backing of Milošević as late as August 1993. Šešelj publicly advocated creating a Greater Serbia through the ethnic cleansing of all Croats and Bosniaks.

In September 1993, however, Šešelj and Milošević came into conflict over Milošević&#x27;s withdrawal of support for Republika Srpska in the Bosnian War, and Milošević described Šešelj as &quot;the personification of violence and primitivism&quot;. Šešelj was jailed in 1994 and 1995 for his opposition to Milošević. The Serbian Radical Party subsequently became the main opposition party and criticised Slobodan Milošević for corruption, ties to organised crime, nepotism, and for poor economic conditions.

In 1995, Šešelj wrote in the publication &quot;Velika Srbija&quot; (Greater Serbia) a memorandum that outlined the Serbianisation of Kosovo. Šešelj called for violence and expulsion against Albanians and their leadership with aims toward discrediting them within Western public opinion.

In July 1997, Šešelj made a guest appearance on BKTV&#x27;s &quot;Tête-à-tête&quot; talk duel programme with lawyer Nikola Barović as the other duelist. The duel quickly degenerated into an exchange of verbal antagonism and ad hominem attacks that culminated in Barović throwing water from a glass in Šešelj&#x27;s face. Sometime later Barović was physically assaulted by Šešelj&#x27;s security detail. Šešelj quipped that Barović slipped on a banana peel and tumbled down a flight of stairs.

In 1998, as violence in the Serbian province of Kosovo increased, Šešelj joined Milošević&#x27;s national unity government, siding briefly with the pro-Milošević government. Šešelj was appointed deputy prime minister. In September of the same year, he objected to foreign media and human rights organisations acting in Yugoslavia, saying:

Human Rights Watch condemned the statement.

During the 1999 Kosovo War and the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, Šešelj and his political party were willing to support Milošević, but after three months of bombardment they were the only party to vote against the withdrawal of FR Yugoslav security forces from Kosovo. Šešelj advocated the forcible removal of all Albanians from Kosovo.

==ICTY/MICT==
===Indictment===
In an interview for NIN held on 4 February 2003 Šešelj stated that he had inside information that he would be indicted by the Hague in the following weeks, and had already booked a flight to the Hague for 24 February. The initial indictment was filed on 14 February 2003.

The crimes in the indictment include, among others, that Šešelj, both individually and as part of a &quot;joint criminal enterprise&quot;, engaged in &quot;the permanent forcible removal, through the commission of crimes in violation of Articles 3 and 5 of the Statute of the Tribunal, of a majority of the Croat, Muslim and other non Serb populations from approximately one-third of the territory of the Republic of Croatia (&quot;Croatia&quot;), and large parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and from parts of Vojvodina, in the Republic of Serbia (&quot;Serbia&quot;), in order to make these areas part of a new Serb-dominated state&quot;.

===Custody and trial===
On 23 February 2003, following a &quot;farewell meeting&quot; held on Republic Square, Šešelj surrendered to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) on the indictment of &quot;eight counts of crimes against humanity and six counts of violations of the laws or customs of war for his alleged participation in a joint criminal enterprise&quot;. He was transferred to the ICTY the following day.

In 2005, Šešelj made headlines when he was asked to read a letter which he earlier sent to the ICTY that stated his contempt for the court. The letter was read in front of cameras by Šešelj and contained insults and expletives aimed at the top ICTY officials and judges. In his letter, Šešelj said the presiding judge has only &quot;the right&quot; (mocking the Hague&#x27;s judges) to perform oral sex on him, and referred to Carla Del Ponte as &quot;the prostitute&quot;.

In custody, he wrote &quot;Kriminalac i ratni zločinac Havijer Solana&quot; (&quot;Felon and War Criminal Javier Solana&quot;), a criticism of the NATO Secretary General (and the current High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union and the Western European Union) who led the 1999 war in Kosovo.

On 2 December 2006, around 40,000 people marched in the Serbian capital of Belgrade in support of Šešelj during his 28-day hunger strike in The Hague after the ICTY denied him the right to choose his own defence counsel. Speaking at the rally, Radical Party secretary Aleksandar Vučić said &quot;He&#x27;s not fighting just for his life. But he&#x27;s fighting for all of us who are gathered here. Vojislav Šešelj is fighting for Serbia!&quot;

Šešelj ended the hunger strike on 8 December after being allowed to present his own defence. While in custody in The Hague, Šešelj led his party&#x27;s list of contenders for the January 2007 general election.

Under the ICTY indictment, Šešelj was charged with 15 counts of crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war. The first of these charges is for persecution of Croats, Muslims and other non-Serbs in Vukovar, Šamac, Zvornik and Vojvodina. The other charges include murder, forced deportation, illegal imprisonment, torture and property destruction during the Yugoslav wars.

Šešelj&#x27;s aide, Ljubiša Petković, was found guilty by the ICTY&#x27;s Trial Chamber III of contempt for refusing to appear as a Chamber&#x27;s witness in Šešelj&#x27;s trial. Petković was released on 26 September from the ICTY Detention Unit. He had been sentenced to four months&#x27; imprisonment, credit being given for the three months and 14 days already spent in the Detention Unit.

His trial officially began on 7 November 2007.

On 11 February 2009, after 71 witnesses had been heard and with the expected conclusion of the prosecution&#x27;s case seven hours away, the presiding judges suspended Šešelj&#x27;s trial indefinitely at the request of prosecutors, who alleged that witnesses were being intimidated. Šešelj claimed the true motive of the prosecutors was that they were losing their case. He claimed the court had presented numerous false witnesses to avoid having to acquit him and said it should pay him damages for &quot;all the suffering and six years spent in detention&quot;.

One of the three judges voted against the suspension of the trial stating that it was &quot;unfair to interrupt the trial of someone who has spent almost six years in detention&quot;. A contempt of court case against Šešelj was opened for having revealed, in a book he had written, the identities of three witnesses whose names had been ordered suppressed by the tribunal, and for which he was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment by the ICTY.

On 24 July 2009, he was sentenced to 15 months in detention for disrespecting the court after publishing names of trial witnesses on his personal website. 

On 25 November 2009, it was announced that Šešelj&#x27;s trial would resume on 12 January 2010. The trial resumed on schedule and continued until 17 March 2010.

On 10 March 2010, the weekly ICTY press briefing announced that Šešelj was scheduled to appear in court on 20 April 2010 for contempt of court for allegedly disclosing court restricted information on 11 protected witnesses. This is the second time he was charged with contempt. In July 2009 he was found guilty of contempt on similar charges involving two protected witnesses and was sentenced to fifteen months in jail.

On 17 March 2010, the weekly ICTY press briefing announced that &quot;The trial of Vojislav Šešelj has been adjourned until further notice, pending checks on the health status of the remaining four Chamber witnesses&quot;. In the weekly ICTY briefing on 24 March stated &quot;The trial of Vojislav Šešelj is expected to continue on Tuesday at 14:15 in Courtroom I with the testimony of one of the four remaining Trial Chamber witnesses&quot;. On 14 April 2010, the weekly ICTY press briefing announced that with only one witness still to be heard, on 30 March 2010 Šešelj trial was adjourned until further notice but was likely to resume in May 2010, after Šešelj&#x27;s second contempt proceeding initiated against him by the Tribunal have ended.

Prosecutors demanded a 28-year sentence against Šešelj for allegedly recruiting paramilitary groups and inciting them to commit atrocities during the Balkan wars of the early 1990s. In closing remarks at his war crimes trial on 14 March 2012, Šešelj said the Yugoslav tribunal empowered by the U.N. Security Council is actually a creation of Western intelligence agencies and it doesn&#x27;t have jurisdiction in his case. He reportedly vowed &quot;to make a mockery of his trial&quot;.

In September 2011, the ICTY rejected Šešelj&#x27;s bid to have his long-running trial discontinued. In his submission to the court, Šešelj had argued that his right to be tried in a reasonable amount of time has been violated, and called the situation &quot;incomprehensible, scandalous and inappropriate&quot;. However, the bench ruled that &quot;there is no predetermined threshold with regard to the time period beyond which a trial may be considered unfair on account of undue delay&quot; and declared that Šešelj &quot;failed to provide concrete proof of abuse of process&quot;.

===Provisional release===
On 6 November 2014, the ICTY granted Šešelj provisional release. The decision was made on the basis of Šešelj&#x27;s diagnosis of metastatic cancer and deteriorating health.

The ICTY did not reveal to the public the conditions under which Šešelj was released, but announced that no special conditions were set for him, except that he does not leave Serbia, has no contact with victims and witnesses, and that he returns to the custody of the ICTY when he is summoned.

Šešelj returned to Belgrade with thousands of sympathizers waiting for him after spending more than 11 years on what proved to be an inconclusive trial at the Hague.

===First verdict===
On 31 March 2016, one week after the conviction of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadžić, the ICTY found Šešelj not guilty on all charges, with a majority decision on eight counts and a unanimous decision on one.

His acquittal was described by &quot;The Economist&quot; as &quot;a victory for advocates of ethnic cleansing&quot; which would have &quot;broad ramifications for international justice.&quot; Aleksandar Vučić, who served as the PM at the time, commented that the case against Šešelj was inherently flawed and politicised from the beginning.

===Reversing of acquittal===
The previous acquittal was later appealed by prosecutors from the MICT, a United Nations Security Council agency which functions as oversight program of, and successor entity to, the ICTY. On 11 April 2018, the Appeals Chamber entered convictions against him under Counts 1, 10 and 11 for instigating deportation, persecution (forcible displacement), and other inhumane acts (forcible transfer) as crimes against humanity due to his speech in Hrtkovci on 6 May 1992, in which he called for the expulsion of Croats from Vojvodina. He was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment, though due to his time served under the custody of the ICTY pending trial, the sentence was declared served.

In August 2018, Šešelj would submit a request to the MICT Appeals Chamber to be heard for appeal regarding the 11 April 2018 decision. This was denied due to an absence of evidence in his request that the previous appeal judgement contained errors or that his procedural rights had been violated.

==Personal life==
Šešelj&#x27;s wife, Jadranka Šešelj (Serbian Cyrillic: Јадранка Шешељ) was born in Podujevo on 13 April 1960. She participated in the President of Serbia elections in 2012 but failed to pass the first round gaining 3.78% of the votes. She is a member of the SRS.

==Health==
Šešelj was diagnosed with metastatic cancer and underwent surgery to remove a tumor from his colon on 19 December 2013, and later underwent chemotherapy.

==Books==
Šešelj authored 183 books, mostly in the form of (court) documents and transcripts from interviews and public appearances. Some of the book titles are formulated as insults to his opponents, ICTY judges and prosecutors, and domestic and foreign political figures.

<text>Arthur Macnamara (1831 – 11 February 1906) was a squire of Billington near Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire, England. He is known for building in and improving the village of Billington.

==Early life==
Macnamara came from a wealthy family who owned many properties. They included in England, Caddington Hall in Hertfordshire and an estate at Eaton Bray in Bedfordshire, and in Wales, Llangoed Estate, the seat of which was Llangoed Hall at Llyswen in the historic county of Brecknockshire.

==Marriage==
On 28 September 1854, Macnamara married Lady Sophia Hare, daughter of the local MP for St Albans the 2nd, Earl of Listowel. The couple were married in the bride&#x27;s family estate at Ballyhooly in County Cork, Ireland. The couple then established their home at Caddington Hall.

At that time, young Macnamara developed a passion for building. He embarked on the project of re-creating the lost castle of Eaton Bray on some land bequeathed to him by his mother. After building grandiose lodges and clearing and preparing the moated site, he seemed to abandon the idea, probably due to lack of funds. All was not well in his marriage, either. Sophia&#x27;s father, a Lord-in-Waiting to Queen Victoria, was able to secure his daughter a position as a Lady-in-Waiting to the Queen&#x27;s daughter, Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll.

==Construction==
In the early 1880s, Macnamara began to acquire land and cottages at Billington and embarked on an ambitious building project, perhaps inspired by the building of Mentmore by Baron Mayer de Rothschild, which was only five miles away.

At first, he built farm houses in the village, adorning each with the Macnamara cypher &#x27;AM&#x27;. As Billington became the estate village, Macnamara began to build a manor house, which was a large, multi-gabled Victorian mansion. The grounds had stable yards, lodges, and farm houses. At Little Billington, a mile away, a lodge was built for a new principal approach to the house, but as money became exhausted, the drive was never built.

A row of cottages existed within sight of the new drive, although as the landlord, Macnamara turned out the elderly occupants and placed them in the workhouse.

==Reputation==
Macnamara had a reputation for severity, and was regarded as someone who was cruel to the common people of the village. It was said that when he encountered any of his tenants driving sheep or cattle along the road, he ordered his coachman not to stop or slow down. If people did not hurry out of his path, they were mowed down. As chairman of the police and the largest land owner in the district, he thought he was above the law. The slightest affront imagined by the squire could lead to the eviction of the perpetrators from their homes.

However, Squire Macnamara had one huge fear: he was frightened of thunder. An underground suite of rooms was furnished at Billington Manor, where he would retreat for long periods of time at the slightest threat of thunder.

==Death==
On 11 February 1906, Arthur Macnamara died in the great house, alone except for his housekeeper. The cause of his death was cirrhosis of the liver.

After his death, he was found to be bankrupt. Lady Sophia sold the estate in her old age. She then lived at Heath and Reach, Leighton Buzzard, where members of the royal family visited her.

Arthur Macnamara was buried in the Billington churchyard, with a monumental tombstone surrounded by iron railings. There is a legend that it was a tradition for the spikes on top of the railings to curve outwards to keep the devil out, but on Arthur Macnamara&#x27;s grave, the spikes were turned in to prevent him from escaping. (The railings were removed during World War II when iron work was melted down to help the war effort.)

Lady Sophia McNamara died in 1912. She chose to be buried in Ireland.

Arthur Macnamara&#x27;s family history, and the history of others in the British Macnamara line, was written in 1908 by Robert Twigge, an eminent historian of the time.

<doc id="788619" wikidata="Q1715912" url="?curid=788619" title="Turbo Assembler">
<text>Turbo Assembler (sometimes shortened to the name of the executable, TASM) is an assembler for software development published by Borland in 1989. It runs on and produces code for 16- or 32-bit x86 MS-DOS and compatibles for Microsoft Windows. It can be used with Borland&#x27;s other language products: Turbo Pascal, Turbo Basic, Turbo C, and Turbo C++. The Turbo Assembler package is bundled with Turbo Linker and is interoperable with Turbo Debugger.

Borland advertised Turbo Assembler as being 2-3 times faster than its primary competitor, Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM). TASM can assemble source in a MASM-compatible mode or an &quot;ideal mode&quot; with a few enhancements. Object-Oriented programming was added in version 3. The last version of Turbo Assembler is 5.4, with files dated 1996 and patches up to 2010; it is still included with Delphi and C++Builder.

TASM itself is a 16-bit program. It will run on 16- and 32-bit versions of Windows, and produce code for the same versions, but it does not generate 64-bit x86 code. Turbo Assembler 5.0 (at least) also contains a 32-bit PE version of tasm called TASM32.EXE.

==Example==
A Turbo Assembler program that prints &#x27;Merry Christmas!&#x27;:
.model small
.stack 100h
.data
msg db &quot;Merry christmas!&quot;,&#x27;$&#x27;
.code
main proc
 mov ax, SEG msg
 mov ds, ax
 mov dx, offset msg
 mov ah, 9
 int 21h
 mov ax, 4c00h
 int 21h
main endp
end main

==Reception==
In a review of three assemblers, Michael Blaszczak of &quot;BYTE&quot; in February 1989 found that Turbo Assembler was slower than SLR OPTASM but faster than and very compatible with MASM. He liked the tutorial on assembly programming and &quot;excellent&quot; sample code, but criticized the paucity of reference documentation. Noting that it was the only assembler that &quot;cleanly assembled everything I fed to it&quot;, Blaszczak concluded that TASM was his favorite as it was &quot;the best of both worlds: MASM compatibility without MASM&#x27;s glitches&quot;, especially for those new to assembly.

<doc id="788621" wikidata="Q841026" url="?curid=788621" title="Brovary">
<text>Brovary (, ; ) is a city in Kyiv Oblast, northern Ukraine, situated to the east of the capital Kyiv and part of the Kyiv metropolitan area. It serves as the administrative centre of Brovary Raion. Brovary hosts the administration of Brovary urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. In 2024, about 100,000 people live in the city.

==History==
===Early history===
Brovary is a historic town, first mentioned in 1630. At the time there were only 60 or 70 houses in Brovary, but in 1649 a Cossack sotnia is known to have been formed there. Cossacks took part in the Khmelnytsky Uprising under Bohdan Khmelnytsky&#x27;s leadership.

Originally, the town was called Brovari (), but the name was changed in 1969 to make it more similar to Russian. The name, translated from Ukrainian, means &#x27;breweries&#x27; (and is a loanword from Dutch). The town got its name after breweries where special beer was made. Travellers who went to Kyiv often stopped in Brovary, rested, dined and drank the local beer. Many famous people visited Brovary while travelling to Kyiv. A Ukrainian poet, Taras Shevchenko, was among them. He visited this town many times in the period from 1829 to 1847. Nowadays there is a monument to Shevchenko in the place from which Brovary began its history as a town, in its old centre.

In 1923, Brovary became the center of Brovary Raion. In that year, Brovary had a population of 4,065 people. In 1930, the district was reworked, with its center moved to Velyka Dymerka. In 1937, this change was undone, and the center was moved back to Brovary.

Brovary received city status in 1956, and in 1972 was designated a city of oblast significance - meaning that while Brovary still served as the administrative center of Brovary Raion, it was no longer subordinated to it, instead being directly subordinated to the government of Kyiv Oblast.

===Early 21st century===

International ill-fame came to Brovary in April 2000 after an apartment block was launched from a neighbouring army shooting range in Honcharivske during a training exercise. Three people were killed.

During the country-wide Ukrainian administrative reform of 17 July 2020, Brovary&#x27;s status as a city of oblast significance was abolished, and it was returned to subordination to Brovary Raion.

===Russian invasion of Ukraine===
It was reported on 10 March 2022 that there had been an attack on a Russian armoured column at Skybyn, just outside Brovary, as it was trying to move in from the north. On 11 March there were fights in Brovary as Russian troops were trying to encircle Kyiv from its east.

On 2 April 2022 the whole of Kyiv Oblast, where Brovary is located, was declared liberated by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense after Russian troops had left the area.

In August 2023, Ukrainian Institute of National Memory decided that the name of the city did not meet the spelling norms and standards of the state language (Ukrainian), meaning that Brovary will be renamed. On 20 March 2024, the Committee of the Verkhovna Rada on issues of organization of state power, local self-government, regional development and urban planning decided to propose the old name, &quot;Brovari&quot;, which corresponds to Ukrainian language standards. The ultimate decision on the renaming will be made only after a vote.

==Geography==
Brovary is a raion centre in Kyiv Oblast. It is situated 20 kilometers from the capital of Ukraine, Kyiv. Brovary Raion lies in the areas of mixed forests. The climate here is moderately continental with the middle temperature -6 C in January and +19 C in July.

==Layout==
The modern centre of Brovary is the newest and the most beautiful part of the town. There, one will find a park with its peaceful alleys. In the central park you can see monuments to the past. There is a plane and a tank. Some shops, offices and cafes are situated there, so the streets are never empty, even in the evening.

Traditionally the town is divided into three parts: the old town, the new town, and the industrial part. There are many plants and factories in the town, producing knitting, furniture, machine tools, plastic materials and other goods. There are ten secondary schools, two music schools, a school of Arts, and three libraries in Brovary. In the city center lies &quot;Prometey&quot;, the historical museum in Gagarin street, which attracts many visitors. If you are fond of sports, you may go to the swimming pools or to the &quot;Spartak&quot; stadium, or even enter the sport college.

==Culture==
In September the citizens of Brovary celebrate the Holiday of the Town&#x27;s Day. It is the time when everyone can watch and listen to concerts of musicians and singers, and see performances by dancers who live in the district. On that day, all the competitions are for show, but Brovary itself is known to be a famous sports town, where a lot of well-known sportsmen have started their career.

==Economy==
In the 21st century, Brovary is Ukraine&#x27;s shoe-making capital, with dozens of such companies located there. There is also a broadcasting centre for long and shortwave transmissions. The longwave transmitter, which works on 207 kHz, uses as its antenna two tall guyed mast radiators each equipped with a cage antenna at their lower part.

The city also houses a railway station.

==Sports==
Brovary is also an important sport centre of Ukraine. Several world and Olympic champions were born and/or began their career here. Ukraine&#x27;s national mint facility is located in Brovary.

Oleksandra Kononova won three medals at the 2010 Paralympic games in Vancouver and became the 2010 Ukrainian sports personality of the year.

==Demographics==
As of the 2001 Ukrainian census, Brovary had a population of 86,839 people. In terms of self-reported ethnic background, 84% of people in Brovary said they were Ukrainians, 14% said they were Russians, and 0.9% Belarusians.

<text>Baltimore Penn Station—formally, Baltimore Pennsylvania Station—is the main inter-city passenger rail hub in Baltimore, Maryland. Designed by New York City architect Kenneth MacKenzie Murchison (1872–1938), it was constructed in 1911 in the Beaux-Arts style of architecture for the Pennsylvania Railroad. It is located at 1515 N. Charles Street, about a mile and a half north of downtown and the Inner Harbor, between the Mount Vernon neighborhood to the south, and Station North to the north. Originally called Union Station because it served the Pennsylvania Railroad and Western Maryland Railway, it was renamed to match the PRR&#x27;s other main stations in 1928.

The building sits on a raised &quot;island&quot; of sorts between two open trenches, one for the Jones Falls Expressway and the other for the tracks of the Northeast Corridor (NEC). The NEC approaches from the south through the two-track, Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel, which opened in 1873 and whose speed limit, sharp curves, and steep grades make it one of the NEC&#x27;s worst bottlenecks. The NEC&#x27;s northern approach is the 1873 Union Tunnel, which has one single-track bore and one double-track bore.

Penn Station is the eighth-busiest Amtrak rail station in the United States by number of passengers served each year.

== History ==
===20th century===

The present Pennsylvania Station is the third railroad depot on its North Charles Street site. The first one was a wooden structure built by the Northern Central Railway, a subsidiary of the PRR, that began operating in 1873. This was replaced in 1886 by the Charles Street Union Station, which featured a three-story brick building situated below street level with a sloping driveway that led to its entrance and a train shed that measured . It was demolished in January 1910, for construction of the present edifice, which opened on September 15, 1911.

Between the 1920s and 1940s, Savarin Restaurants provided full-service dining rooms at Baltimore Pennsylvania Station, Washington Union Station, and others. The Savarin Restaurant, located at the west end of Baltimore&#x27;s station, was originally decorated with Chesapeake Bay-themed murals and had an entrance and exterior signage directly fronting Charles Street. By the early 1960s, the Savarin had ended table service and offered counter-service only.

Penn Station has been the region&#x27;s primary intercity railroad station since 1958, when the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ended all passenger service north of Baltimore, subsequently closing Mount Royal Station in 1961 and eventually reducing service at Camden Station to local commuter trains only by 1971.

On September 23, 1952, Richard Nixon, then a U.S. Senator from California and the Republican Party&#x27;s nominee for Vice President, gave what became known as the Checkers speech, in which he said his dog Checkers had been held for him at &quot;Union Station in Baltimore,&quot; the station&#x27;s former name.

===21st century===

In 2004, Baltimore, through its public arts program, commissioned sculptor Jonathan Borofsky to create a sculpture as the centerpiece of a re-designed plaza in front of Penn Station. His work, a -tall aluminum statue, named &quot;Male/Female&quot;, has generated considerable controversy ever since, with &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; reporting what it called a &quot;maelstrom of criticism&quot;. Its defenders cite the contemporary imagery and artistic expression as complementing an urban landscape, while opponents criticize what they decry as a clash with the station&#x27;s Beaux-Arts architecture and detracting from its classic lines. &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; editorially characterized it as &quot;oversized, underdressed, and woefully out of place&quot;.

Several proposals have been made to convert the upper floors of the station into a hotel. Proposals from 2001 and 2006 were announced but never completed. In 2009, Amtrak reached an agreement with a developer for a 77-room hotel to be called The Inn at Penn Station. This project stalled along with many other hotel proposals in Baltimore.

In December 2017, Amtrak awarded a contract to Penn Station Partners for improvements to the station and redevelopment of nearby property owned by the passenger railroad. The partnership is composed of Beatty Development Group and Cross Street Partners. In April 2019, it was announced that development would encompass a transit-oriented hub of apartments, shops, offices, a hotel, and redevelopment of nearby property owned by the passenger railroad. Amtrak describes the plan as creating a premier regional transportation hub to accommodate passenger growth as the next generation of high-speed Acela Express trains start running along the Northeast Corridor in 2021.

A spokesman for Penn Station Partners stated at a presentation of its tentative plans to the public on August 13, 2019, that they will seek city and state funding to help pay the total project cost. Included would be a new concourse and other station enhancements to accommodate the expected increase in passenger volume. Amtrak, for its part, has earmarked $90 million in federal funding for related improvements to the station and its tracks.

Amtrak and the Penn Station Partners development team headed by Beatty Development Group and Cross Street Partners unveiled plans to construct a three-level train terminal just north of the existing station on October 15, 2020. The new structure, which is meant to supplement the current building by accommodating all passenger-oriented functions with the expectation of increased traffic from the potential installation of a high-speed rail line, will be bordered by Charles Street to the west, Lanvale Street to the north, St. Paul Street to the east and the facility&#x27;s railroad tracks to the south. The existing Penn Station&#x27;s restoration began in 2021, with its upper levels converted into office space and restaurants and shops occupying the ground level.

In a June 8, 2021, editorial, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; reported that the controversial male/female aluminum statue is not shown in the development team&#x27;s conceptual drawings for the station plaza. The developers said no decision has been reached about its future and the newspaper called for public input on the issue.

== Services ==

The station is the northern terminus of the Baltimore Light RailLink&#x27;s Penn–Camden shuttle, connecting the Mount Vernon neighborhood with downtown; the southern terminus is Baltimore&#x27;s Camden Station. It is also a major station on MARC&#x27;s Penn Line commuter service to Washington. Most Penn Line trains terminate here, with some continuing to Martin State Airport or Perryville.

Amtrak owns the station, which serves nine of Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor services. &quot;Acela&quot; and &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; trains from Penn Station serve destinations along the Northeast Corridor between Boston and Washington, D.C. Some Regional trains from the station continue into Virginia and serve Alexandria, Newport News, Norfolk, Roanoke, and points in between. Other long-distance trains from the station serve:

*St. Albans, Vermont
*Charlottesville, Virginia
*Raleigh and Charlotte, North Carolina
*Atlanta, Georgia
*New Orleans, Louisiana
*Jacksonville, Orlando, and Miami, Florida
*Huntington, West Virginia
*Cincinnati, Ohio
*Indianapolis, Indiana
*Chicago, Illinois

Although Amtrak owns the station, its Superliner railcars cannot enter due to inadequate clearances in the B&amp;P and Union tunnels.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Amtrak also offered service to Harrisburg and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, St. Louis, Missouri, and Atlantic City, New Jersey.

Before Amtrak&#x27;s creation on May 1, 1971, Penn Station served as the main Baltimore station for its original owner, the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), though passenger trains of the Western Maryland Railway also used Penn Station as well. It was also served by numerous PRR commuter trains to Washington, the ancestor of the MARC Penn Line. Well-known streamliners of other railroads, such as the Southern Railway&#x27;s &quot;Southerner&quot; and all-Pullman &quot;Crescent Limited&quot;, the Atlantic Coast Line&#x27;s &quot;Champion&quot;, and the Seaboard&#x27;s &quot;Silver Meteor&quot;, were operated by the PRR between New York City and Washington, D.C., stopping at Baltimore&#x27;s Penn Station to board passengers destined for southern points served by those railroads.

Until the late 1960s, the PRR also operated long-distance trains over its historic Northern Central Railway line from Penn Station to Harrisburg and beyond, such as &quot;The General&quot; to Chicago, the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; to its Missouri namesake, and the &quot;Buffalo Day Express&quot; and overnight &quot;Northern Express&quot; between Washington, DC, and Buffalo, New York. As late as 1956, this route also hosted the &quot;Liberty Limited&quot; to Chicago and the &quot;Dominion Limited&quot; to Toronto, Canada. The Baltimore Light RailLink now operates over much of the Northern Central Railway&#x27;s right of way in Baltimore and Baltimore County; however, the spur connecting Penn Station to this right of way is not the route originally taken by Northern Central trains. Baltimore Light RailLink service began in 1997.

As part of the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project, the station was restored to its 1911 appearance in 1984.

The station&#x27;s use as a Western Maryland station stop allowed passengers from Penn Station to ride directly to various Maryland towns such as Westminster, Hagerstown, and Cumberland. Passenger service on the Western Maryland ended in 1958.

Baltimore Penn Station is also used for MARC train storage during the weekends and overnight via off-peak service times on tracks 2, 3, 5, and 8.

=== Station services ===
Penn Station offers a magazine store that sells quick necessities, and two restaurants: Dunkin&#x27; Donuts and Java Moon Cafe. Parking is available at the station through a garage with 550 parking spaces, owned by the Baltimore Parking Authority. ZipCar also has three vehicles based at the station.

<text>Ran Cohen (, born 20 June 1937) is an Israeli politician and former Knesset member for Meretz.

==Biography==
Said Cohen (later Ran Cohen) was born in Baghdad, Iraq. At the age of 13 year, he immigrated to Israel through Iran. He hebraized his first name after his arrival in Israel, renaming himself &quot;Ran&quot;. He grew up in Kibbutz Gan Shmuel, where he absorbed Socialist and Zionist ideologies. During his military service he rose to the rank of colonel (Aluf Mishne). After the military he obtained a B.A. in philosophy and Economics at Tel Aviv University.

Cohen is a resident of Mevaseret Zion. He is married and has four children.

==Political career==
In 1970 he was elected as Secretary of Kibbutz Gan Shmuel.

In 1984 he was first elected to the Knesset as a member of Ratz (headed by Shulamit Aloni) after he headed the Left Camp of Israel peace movement.

Starting in 1992, he served as a member of Meretz, a dovish left wing party which resulted from the merger of Mapam, Ratz and Shinui. He was Minister of Industry and Trade in Ehud Barak&#x27;s government. He headed several Knesset committees, including the Security and Foreign Affairs committee.

Cohen is most identified with &quot;Law of Public Housing&quot;, which allowed residents of houses supplied by the state to assume ownership on the house. He also managed to pass a law regulating minimum wages.

After Meretz merged with Yossi Beilin&#x27;s Shachar movement and renamed itself Yachad in 2004, Cohen ran for the chairmanship of the new party, but lost to Beilin. Supporters of Cohen blamed his defeat on anti-Mizrahi racism within the party and pointed out that he was the only non-Ashkenazi to reach a senior position within it. 

On 1 November 2008, following Beilin&#x27;s resignation, he announced his intention to retire from political life and not to seek a spot on the party&#x27;s list ahead of the upcoming general elections. He said &quot;I want to start chapter three of my life, to do things for my soul: writing, lecturing, taking part in social and public initiatives that interest me&quot;.

==Public service career==
In 2011, Cohen was elected Chairman of the Standards Institution of Israel (SII).

<doc id="788634" wikidata="Q599820" url="?curid=788634" title="Muumuu">
<text>The muumuu or muumuu () is a loose dress of Hawaiian origin. Within the category of fashion known as aloha wear, the muumuu, like the aloha shirt, are often brilliantly colored with floral patterns of Polynesian motifs. In Hawaiʻi, muumuus are no longer as widely worn as an aloha shirt, but continue to be a popular dress for social gatherings, church, and festivals such as the Merrie Monarch hula competition. 

==Etymology and history==
The word &quot;muumuu&quot; means &quot;cut off&quot; in Hawaiian. The dress, which was originally used as an undergarment or chemise for the &quot;holokū&quot;, lacked a yoke and may have featured short sleeves or no sleeves at all. The muumuu was made of lightweight solid white cotton fabric and, in addition to being an undergarment, served Hawaiian women as a housedress, nightgown, and swimsuit. &quot;Holokū&quot; was the original name for the Mother Hubbard dress introduced by Protestant missionaries to Hawaii in the 1820s. In contrast to the muumuu, the &quot;holokū&quot; featured long sleeves and a floor-length unfitted dress falling from a high-necked yoke which was worn by the &quot;aliʻi&quot; as well as the common people. By the 1870s, the &quot;holokū&quot; of the &quot;aliʻi&quot; took on a more fitted waist and often a train seven or eight yards in length for the evening, and included ruffles, flounces and trimmings, while the modest loose-fitting train-less &quot;holokū&quot; continued to be widely worn by women of all classes as their daily dress. In time, upon the introduction of printed fabrics to Hawai&#x27;i, the muumuu, essentially a shortened and more comfortable version of the &quot;holokū&quot;, gained popularity for everyday wear.
