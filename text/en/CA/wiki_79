<text>Jaume Marquet i Cot (), more popularly known as Jimmy Jump (born 14 March 1976), is a streaker from Sabadell, Catalonia, Spain, known for interfering in several major entertainment and sporting events.

==Incidents==

===Football===
On 4 July 2004, during the UEFA Euro 2004 final between Greece and Portugal, Marquet threw an FC Barcelona flag at the Portuguese captain – Luís Figo – who left that team to join their archrivals, Real Madrid CF, in 2000.

In the semi-final of 2005-06 UEFA Champions League between Villarreal CF and Arsenal FC, he ran on the track just before the start of the second half. He threw onto the pitch an FC Barcelona shirt (with the name &quot;Henry&quot; and number &quot;14&quot;) ahead of Arsenal player Thierry Henry. On 25 June 2007, Henry signed for Barcelona.

At the final of the 2006-07 UEFA Champions League in Athens, Greece, between AC Milan and Liverpool FC, Jimmy Jump ran down the field with a Greek flag, but this was not shown by the television cameras. In August of the same year, after Lionel Messi scored a goal against FC Bayern Munich, Marquet put a hat on Messi&#x27;s head.

Marquet also appeared in the UEFA Euro 2008 semi-final, between Germany and Turkey. This time he was carrying a flag of Tibet and a shirt with the inscription &quot;Tibet is not China&quot;.

Jimmy Jump also ran onto the field during a game of La Liga between Barcelona and Racing de Santander.

On 11 July 2010, moments before the 2010 FIFA World Cup Final between Spain and the Netherlands, played in Johannesburg, South Africa, Marquet rushed onto the field and attempted to place a barretina on the World Cup trophy before being apprehended by several security guards. He was ordered to pay a ZAR2,000 fine for the incident.

On 11 September 2010, Marquet ran onto the field before the second half of the Hungarian Derby between Újpest FC and Ferencvárosi TC. He held a Catalan flag with the message &quot;Kubala forever&quot;, in honour of former Barcelona and Ferencvárosi player László Kubala. Before the security guards caught him, he kicked the ball into the Ferencvárosi goal. Security handed him over to the police and he was taken into custody for four hours, before being released and fined approximately EUR350.

=== Formula 1 ===
In the 2004 Spanish Grand Prix, Jimmy ran through the starting grid during the formation lap, only to be apprehended by race marshals shortly after. While he claimed to have many fans (due to his other performances at football matches), he was criticized for risking the lives of the drivers, even though the cars were travelling at low speed at this point.

=== Tennis ===
During the 2009 Men&#x27;s Singles Finals of the French Open, he accosted eventual winner Roger Federer, attempting to place a red barretina on his head. Marquet was tackled by a security guard while stumbling after he jumped over the net. He faced up to 12 months in prison for the incident.

=== Eurovision Song Contest ===
During the 2010 Eurovision Song Contest in Norway, Marquet invaded the stage during the Spanish performance by Daniel Diges and took part in the choreography. He subsequently left the stage at the venue and was immediately escorted away from the concert area and taken to Sandvika police station, where he was arrested and fined NOK15,000. Due to the incident, Svante Stockselius, the executive supervisor of the Eurovision Song Contest at that time, allowed Spain to perform for a second time after the last regular performance.

=== Goya Awards ===
On 13 February 2011, during the 25th Goya Awards ceremony, Marquet invaded the stage just before the best actor award was handed over to Javier Bardem. Before being whisked away, Marquet could say only a few words on the microphone and cover the Best Actor Goya statuette with a barretina.

=== Elsewhere ===
On 14 September 2010, after the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League group stage, Marquet appeared in a weather forecast on Hungarian television channel TV2. He waved, shouting &quot;Barcelona, Barcelona!&quot;, placed his cap on the forecaster, and chanted &quot;Barça!&quot;. Marquet had a microphone attached to this t-shirt because he was a guest in an earlier talk show.

<text>Roseberry Topping is a distinctive hill in North Yorkshire, England. It is situated near Great Ayton and Newton under Roseberry. Its summit has a distinctive half-cone shape with a jagged cliff, which has led to many comparisons with the much higher Matterhorn in the Swiss-Italian Alps. It is a symbol of the area and features in the logo of the nearby Teesside International Airport.

At , Roseberry Topping was traditionally thought to be the highest hill on the North York Moors but there are 15 higher peaks, with the nearby Urra Moor being the highest, at . Roseberry Topping offers views of Captain Cook&#x27;s Monument on Easby Moor and the monument on Eston Nab, previously a beacon.

==Geology==
The hill is an outlier of the North York Moors uplands. It is formed from sandstone laid down in the Middle and Lower Jurassic periods, between 208 and 165 million years ago, which constitutes the youngest sandstone to be found in any of the national parks in England and Wales. Its distinctive conical shape is the result of the hill&#x27;s hard sandstone cap protecting the underlying shales and clays from erosion by the effects of ice, wind and rain.

Until 1912 the summit resembled a sugarloaf, until a geological fault and possibly nearby alum and ironstone mining caused it to collapse. The area immediately below the summit is still extensively pitted and scarred from the former mineworks. From the summit there are magnificent views across the Cleveland plain as far as the Pennines on a clear day, some away.

==History==
The Roseberry area has been inhabited for thousands of years and the hill has long attracted attention for its distinctive shape. A Bronze Age hoard was discovered on the slopes of the hill and is now in the Sheffield City Museum. It was occupied during the Iron Age: walled enclosures and the remains of huts dating from the period are still visible in the vicinity of the hill. During this period Jet may have been mined in the area.

The hill may have been held in special regard by the Vikings who settled in Cleveland during the early medieval period and gave the area many of its place names. They gave Roseberry Topping its present name: first attested in 1119 as Othenesberg, its second element is accepted to derive from Old Norse &quot;bjarg&quot; (rock) and the first element must be an Old Norse personal name, Authunn or Óthinn, giving &#x27;Authunn&#x27;s/Óthinn&#x27;s rock&#x27;. If the latter, Roseberry Topping is one of only a handful of known pagan names in England, being named after the Norse god Odin and paralleled by the Old English name &quot;Wodnesberg&quot;, found for example in Woodnesborough. The name changed successively to Othensberg, Ohenseberg, Ounsberry and Ouesberry before finally settling on Roseberry. ‘Topping’ is a Yorkshire dialectal derivation of Old English &quot;topp&quot;, top (of a hill). The naming of the hill may thus fit a well-established pattern in Continental Europe of hills and mountains being named after Odin or the Germanic equivalent, Wodan. Aelfric of Eynsham, writing in the 10th century, recorded how &quot;the heathens made him into a celebrated god and made offerings to him at crossroads and brought oblations to high hills for him. This god was honoured among all heathens and he is called ... Othon in Danish.&quot;

In 1736, explorer James Cook&#x27;s family moved to Airey Holme Farm at nearby Great Ayton. When he had time off from working on the farm with his father, young James took himself off up Roseberry Topping, which gave him his first taste for adventure and exploration, which was to stay with him for life.

Roseberry Topping can be seen from many miles away and was long used by sailors and farmers as an indicator of impending bad weather. An old rhyme commemorates this usage:

:&quot;When Roseberry Topping wears a cap, let Cleveland then beware of a clap!&quot;

The hill was private property for many years, formerly being part of a game estate owned by the Cressy family. In the early 18th century, Dorothea Cressy married Archibald Primrose, who was later made Earl of Rosebery. Roseberry Topping is now managed by the National Trust and is open to the public. It is just within the North York Moors National Park, the border of which runs along the A173 road below it.

A spur of the Cleveland Way National Trail runs up to the summit. The path has been a sightseeing excursion route for centuries owing to the views of the Cleveland area from the summit: as early as 1700 travellers were recommended to visit the peak to see &quot;the most delightful prospect upon the valleys below to the hills above.&quot;

The site was notified as a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1954, with a boundary extension in 1986 bringing the designated area to 10.86 hectares. The site is listed as being of national importance in the Geological Conservation Review.

During the Napoleonic Wars, the Wensleydale volunteers responded to a false alarm when the beacon on Penhill, in Wensleydale, North Yorkshire was lit in response to a supposed lit beacon on Roseberry Topping, 40 miles distant. It turned out to be burning heather.

==In popular culture==
In Joseph Reed&#x27;s 1761 farce &quot;The Register-Office&quot;, the character Margery Moorpout, who hails from &#x27;Yatton&#x27;, sings the praises of &#x27;Roseberry&#x27;, which she claims to be a mile and a half high: 

&quot;Certainly God! ye knaw Roseberry? I thought ony Fule had knawn Roseberry!—It&#x27;s t&#x27; biggest Hill in oll &quot;Yorkshire&quot;—It&#x27;s aboun a Mile an a hofe high, an as coad as Ice at&#x27; top on&#x27;t i&#x27;t hettest Summer&#x27;s Day—that it&#x27;s.&quot;
In 1783, Thomas Pierson, a blacksmith, watchmaker and schoolmaster from the nearby town of Stokesley, wrote an eponymous poem about the hill. Pierson&#x27;s work was much admired locally and it was republished in 1847.

<text>Brian William Pillman (May 22, 1962 – October 5, 1997) was an American professional wrestler and professional football player best known for his appearances in Stampede Wrestling in the 1980s and World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), and World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in the 1990s.

Pillman created a legacy as &quot;The Loose Cannon&quot;, a wrestling gimmick that would see him do a series of worked shoots that would gain him a degree of infamy for his unpredictable character. He was also known for being extremely agile in the ring, although a car accident on April 15, 1996, from which he received extensive ankle injuries limited his in-ring ability. By the end of his career, he worked with his long-time friend and former tag-team partner Stone Cold Steve Austin in a storyline involving a firearm and with The Hart Foundation during the first instances of the developing Attitude Era. In October 1997, he died unexpectedly due to an undetected heart disease.

==Early life==
Pillman was born on May 22, 1962, to a Welsh mother named Mary; he had three sisters named Angie, Linda, and Susan, as well as a brother Phil. His father died of a heart attack when Pillman was three months old in August 1962.

As a child, Pillman developed multiple throat polyps and underwent between 31 and 36 operations to tend to them, many before the age of three. Due to his medical issues Pillman spent a large part of his early childhood in a hospital, only going home for Christmas. Because of this Pillman&#x27;s mother chose to send him to a public school so that he could spend more time with his friends, which led him to become the only Presbyterian in his otherwise Catholic family. As a child Pillman played many sports, including basketball and hockey, but was rather fragile and was often made fun of by other children because of his raspy voice, which had been damaged by the many operations. This, according to his mother, prompted him to learn how to box.

==Football career==

Pillman graduated from Norwood High School in Norwood, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati. While attending Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, Pillman played football for Redskins (now Miami RedHawks) as a linebacker. Pillman struggled academically and needed help with school to continue to play; he was then tutored by Miami rugby player Bill Minnich. A Division I Second-team All-American in his junior year and a Division I All-American in his senior year, he went undrafted in the 1984 NFL draft. He joined his hometown Cincinnati Bengals as a free agent (where he won the Ed Block Courage Award for his team), and later the Canadian Football League for the Calgary Stampeders in 1986. Pillman also played for the Buffalo Bills in preseason action in 1985, but he was the last player cut before the start of that season. His attempts to make the roster of the Bengals were covered in a series of articles in &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; written by Peter King. Pillman and John Harbaugh, current head coach of the Baltimore Ravens, were roommates and defensive teammates while at Miami.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Stampede Wrestling (1986–1988)===
Following the end of his football career, Pillman remained in Canada and began training as a wrestler under Stu Hart and his sons. He debuted in November 1986 in Hart&#x27;s Calgary-based Stampede Wrestling promotion.

Pillman quickly formed a tag team with Hart&#x27;s son Bruce known as Bad Company (not to be confused with Badd Company). In April 1987, Bad Company won the Stampede Wrestling International Tag Team Championship by defeating Ron Starr and the Cuban Assassin in the finals of a tournament. Their reign lasted until October 1987, when the titles were held up following a controversial ending to a match between Bad Company and their opponents, Jerry Morrow and Makhan Singh. Bad Company defeated Morrow and Singh in a rematch in November 1987 to regain the titles, eventually losing them to Morrow and the Cuban Assassin in July 1988.

While in Stampede Wrestling, Pillman had his girlfriend at the time, Trisa Hayes, portray his sister in order to get him over as a face by seating her at ringside and having heel wrestlers taunt her so that he could rescue her.

Pillman finished up with Stampede on August 13, 1988, teaming up with Bruce Hart and Jason the Terrible to defeat The Great Gama, Makhan Singh, and Johnny Smith in the main event. He would head to the Continental Wrestling Association in Memphis to continue his career.

After finishing with Stampede Pillman worked briefly in 1989 for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) as part of its &quot;Battle Line Tokyo Dome&quot; tour where he wrestled in singles matches against people such as Masa Saito, Tatsumi Fujinami, Black Cat and Naoki Sano as well as in tag team matches with Big Van Vader against Riki Choshu and Tatsumi Fujinami.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1989–1996)===

====Flyin&#x27; Brian (1989–1993)====
In June 1989, Pillman returned to the United States and began wrestling for World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where he was known as Flyin&#x27; Brian due to his athletic ability and variety of aerial maneuvers. He was one of the first American wrestlers, along with &quot;Beautiful&quot; Bobby Eaton, to incorporate a variety of Mexican lucha libre moves into his arsenal. He held the NWA United States Tag Team Championship with &quot;Z-Man&quot; Tom Zenk between February 1990 and May 1990. Pillman later feuded with Barry Windham, who he harassed while dressed as the masked Yellow Dog after losing a Loser Leaves WCW (Pillman was eventually reinstated). He also held the short-lived WCW Light Heavyweight Championship twice between October 1991 and February 1992, feuding with Brad Armstrong, Jushin &quot;Thunder&quot; Liger, Richard Morton, and Scotty Flamingo.

In March 1991, Pillman wrestled at the WCW/New Japan Supershow I in the Tokyo Dome, teaming with Tim Horner and &quot;Z-Man&quot; Tom Zenk in a loss to Kuniaki Kobayashi, Shiro Koshinaka, and Takayuki Iizuka. In August 1991, Pillman wrestled for NJPW as part of its &quot;Summer Night Fever in Nagoya&quot; and &quot;Violent Storm in Kokugikan&quot; tours, facing opponents including Jushin Thunder Liger and Kensuke Sasaki.

Pillman turned heel in September 1992, frustrated by Brad Armstrong&#x27;s knee injury and vacating the WCW Light Heavyweight title, when he was scheduled to wrestle Armstrong for the title at &quot;Clash of the Champions XX&quot;. In November 1992, he formed a team with Barry Windham, gunning for the NWA and WCW World Tag Team Championships held by Ricky Steamboat and Shane Douglas. Windham and Pillman lost to Steamboat and Douglas at Starrcade on December 28. Their team lasted until January 1993, as Windham had his sights on the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.

==== Hollywood Blonds (1993–1994)====

Pillman continued the tag team title hunt by forming a tag team with &quot;Stunning&quot; Steve Austin known as the Hollywood Blonds. On the March 27, 1993, episode of &quot;Power Hour&quot;, the duo won the championships from Steamboat and Douglas. After the feud with Steamboat and Douglas ended, they went on to feud with The Four Horsemen, mainly Ric Flair and Arn Anderson, mocking their ages and parodying Flair&#x27;s interview show, &quot;&quot;A Flair for the Gold&quot;, with their own called &quot;A Flair for the Old&quot;&quot;. They would lose the NWA and WCW World Tag Team Titles to Anderson and Paul Roma at &quot;Clash of the Champions XXIV&quot; (Lord Steven Regal substituted for Pillman, who suffered a leg injury in a tag team match on an episode of WCW Main Event prior to the Clash of Champions).

After the Hollywood Blonds separated in October 1993, Pillman became a face, feuding with his old partner Austin. He would also pursue the WCW World Television Championship, held by Lord Steven Regal, with whom he wrestled to a 15-minute time limit draw at Spring Stampede.

==== Four Horsemen; &quot;Loose Cannon&quot; (1995–1996) ====

After several months of inactivity, Pillman made his return to WCW programming in January 1995, originally to be renamed California Brian (which was scrapped after a week) as a babyface who had moved to California to pursue acting work on &quot;Baywatch&quot;, with Pillman slowly progressing into a tweener, feuding with wrestlers such as Brad Armstrong, Eddie Guerrero, Alex Wright and Marcus Bagwell by the fall. In September 1995, Pillman formed a team with Arn Anderson and began feuding with Ric Flair. On September 4, 1995, Pillman wrestled the first match on the inaugural episode of &quot;Monday Nitro&quot; by defeating Jushin &quot;Thunder&quot; Liger in a SuperBrawl II rematch. After costing Flair a match to Arn Anderson at Fall Brawl, Flair recruited the help of Sting to team up against Pillman and Anderson at Halloween Havoc. Pillman and Anderson attacked Flair before the match, forcing Sting to come out alone. When Sting needed a tag the most, Flair came out at the last minute with a bandage on his head, tagged Sting and immediately turned and attacked him removing the fake bandage from his head to show it was all a plan between Pillman, Anderson and Flair from the start. These actions signaled the reuniting of The Four Horsemen. This incarnation was Flair, Anderson, Pillman and Chris Benoit.

Pillman had worked briefly in Japan in 1991 while with WCW but his longest time there was working for New Japan Pro-Wrestling in the middle of 1995 when he participated in the Best of the Super Juniors. When in Japan he wrestled against Dean Malenko, Tatsuhito Takaiwa, Black Cat, Koji Kanemoto, Shinjiro Otani, Gran Hamada, Black Tiger, Wild Pegasus, Alex Wright and El Samurai in singles matches and in tag team matches together with Wright, Norio Honaga, Hamada or Malenko against Akira Nogami, Koji Kanemoto, Takayuki Iizuka, El Samurai, Malenko and Honaga. He also participated in several multi man matches before returning to WCW.

At the end of 1995, Pillman developed his &quot;Loose Cannon&quot; gimmick, cultivating a reputation for unpredictable behavior. During this period of time, Pillman changed his once Hollywood Blond and Flyin&#x27; Brian clean athletic look for an edgy, out of control image. Even his allies in the Horsemen, especially Anderson, were wary of his behavior and tried in vain to keep him in check. Almost all of the time Pillman could be seen wearing leather vests, sunglasses, jewelry and graphic T-shirts with skulls, monsters and sayings on them. Pillman frequently blurred fact and fiction with his worked shoots. In a match with Eddie Guerrero on the January 23, 1996, episode of &quot;Clash of the Champions XXXII&quot;, Pillman grabbed commentator Bobby Heenan by the collar, causing Heenan (who had a history of neck problems) to blurt out &quot;What the fuck are you doing?&quot; live on the air.

Pillman outed Kevin Sullivan as booker during the February 1996 SuperBrawl VI pay-per-view in an I Respect You Strap match where the loser announces that they respect the other wrestler, much like an &quot;I Quit&quot; match. Pillman lost to Sullivan, after Pillman grabbed the microphone and said to Sullivan &quot;I respect you, booker man.&quot; The words &quot;booker man&quot; were cut from the commercial tape. The next day after SuperBrawl VI, Pillman was fired by WCW President Eric Bischoff. In Bischoff&#x27;s autobiography he said that Pillman was fired so that he could go and develop the &quot;loose cannon&quot; gimmick in ECW then return to WCW with more legitimate heat. Bischoff claims it was a plan he and Pillman came up with together. It would later backfire on Bischoff as Pillman did not return.

=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994, 1996)===
In late-1994, Pillman appeared with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) as part of a talent exchange between ECW and WCW. His only match there was teaming with Shane Douglas to replace an injured Steve Austin, with Sherri Martel as their manager, in a losing effort to Ron Simmons and 2 Cold Scorpio.

Immediately following his departure from WCW, Pillman returned to ECW and appeared at the promotion&#x27;s annual Internet convention, ECW CyberSlam, on February 17, 1996. During an interview conducted in the ring by Joey Styles, Pillman insulted Bischoff, calling him a commentator, a &quot;gofer&quot;, and a &quot;piece of fucking shit&quot;. After Styles attempted to end the interview, Pillman prevented him from doing so, and turned his attention to the ECW audience, derisively calling them &quot;smart marks&quot;. He then proceeded further by threatening to &quot;yank out (his) Johnson&quot; and urinate in the ring, before being confronted by ECW owner Tod Gordon, booker Paul Heyman, and wrestler Shane Douglas, who had him removed from the ring by security guards. While being dragged from the arena, Pillman attacked a plant sitting in the audience with a fork he produced from his boot. Although he did not wrestle for ECW, Pillman made several further appearances with the promotion, engaging in a war of words with Douglas, setting up a proposed feud.

He gained the backstage ire of New Jack when he referred to Jack&#x27;s tag team with Mustafa Saed as &quot;Niggas with Attitudes&quot; at Fight the Power, a reference to the rap group N.W.A. With his &quot;Loose Cannon&quot; persona, Pillman became the talk of all three major promotions, as he was on his way to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) after he was scheduled to wrestle Shane Douglas in ECW. On April 15, 1996, Pillman was badly injured after falling asleep while driving his Hummer H1 in Kentucky and driving into a tree trunk, flipping the vehicle. He was in a coma for a week and suffered a shattered ankle, forcing doctors to fuse it together in a fixed walking position and thus forcing Pillman to abandon his previous high-flying wrestling style for a more grounded style.

===World Wrestling Federation (1996–1997)===
==== Feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin (1996–1997)====
Pillman signed a contract with the WWF on June 10, 1996, with the signing announced in a press conference. He was the second wrestler to sign a guaranteed contract with the WWF after Marc Mero, indicative of the period in which Vince McMahon began to protect the company from abruptly losing talent to WCW, with Lex Luger, Kevin Nash, and Scott Hall all previously doing so. Pillman acted as a commentator while recovering from his broken ankle, transitioning to a wrestling role after attacking an unruly fan during an episode of WWF Superstars on June 29, 1996, in Detroit.

On the November 4, 1996, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Pillman took part in the infamous &quot;Pillman&#x27;s got a gun&quot; angle with his former teammate Stone Cold Steve Austin. When Pillman initially arrived to the WWF, he aligned himself immediately with his long-time friend and former teammate Austin, serving as his lackey while he recovered. However, Pillman began noticeably favoring Austin&#x27;s nemesis, Bret Hart, before Austin had enough and brutally attacked him in the ring during an interview on an episode of &quot;Superstars&quot; on October 27, 1996. Austin and Pillman had been feuding for several weeks, and Austin finally decided to take matters into his own hands and visit Pillman, whom he had already injured, at his home in Walton, Kentucky. WWF interviewer Kevin Kelly sat in Pillman&#x27;s house with a camera crew and the Pillman family, while Pillman&#x27;s friends surrounded the house to protect him. As the interview progressed, Pillman got infuriated and produced a handgun, angrily exclaiming, &quot;when Austin 3:16 meets Pillman 9-millimeter glock, I&#x27;m gonna blast his sorry ass straight to hell.&quot; Austin was attacked by Pillman&#x27;s friends as soon as he arrived, but he quickly subdued them. He then proceeded to break into Pillman&#x27;s home and advance on his nemesis. However, Pillman responded by pulling out the pistol and pointing it at a hesitant Austin, while Kelly and Pillman&#x27;s wife Melanie screamed for help. The camera feed was then disrupted, with the scene fading to black. The on-scene director contacted commentator Vince McMahon and reported that he had heard &quot;a couple explosions&quot;. The transmission was restored shortly before the end of &quot;Raw&quot;, and viewers witnessed Pillman&#x27;s friends dragging Austin from the house while Pillman aimed the gun at Austin and announced his intention to &quot;kill that son of a bitch!&quot; Pillman also slipped up by saying &quot;get out of the fucking way!&quot; on live television, which prevented it from being edited out. The WWF and Pillman eventually apologized for the entire angle.

==== Hart Foundation (1997) ====

After WrestleMania 13, Pillman returned and aligned himself with his real life close friends Bret Hart, Owen Hart, The British Bulldog, and Jim Neidhart, all of whom he was familiar with from his Stampede Wrestling roots, turning Pillman heel as part of the anti-American Hart Foundation. He began feuding with his former partner, Steve Austin. In the course of the feud, Austin was given on-screen credit for damaging Pillman&#x27;s ankle in late October 1996 after placing it in between the seat and backrest of a folded chair and then jumping on the chair (this particular style of attack has since been dubbed &quot;The Pillmanizer&quot;, in honor of this incident). Pillman began competing again as a full-time in-ring competitor in May, frequently teaming with Hart Foundation members in 6 man tag matches against Austin and the Legion of Doom. On July 6, 1997, at In Your House 16: Canadian Stampede in Bret&#x27;s hometown Calgary, Pillman and The Hart Foundation defeated the American team of Stone Cold Steve Austin, Goldust, Ken Shamrock and The Legion of Doom in a 10-man tag team match in the main event.

After his feud with Austin, he feuded with Goldust over Marlena until his death. Pillman lost to Goldust at SummerSlam in which Pillman was forced to wear a dress during his matches for a month, Pillman then challenged Goldust again to a match with two stipulations, if Pillman won he would take Marlena away from Goldust to be his personal assistant for 30 days or if Goldust won, Pillman would leave the WWF for the rest of his life. Pillman defeated Goldust at In Your House 17: Ground Zero. This turned out to be his final WWF pay-per-view appearance. During the feud they would for several weeks later appear in segments called &quot;Brian Pillman&#x27;s XXX-Files&quot;, in which Marlena was made to wear sexually provocative clothing. His final WWF televised match came on the October 4, 1997, episode of Shotgun Saturday Night, defeating The Patriot by disqualification due to interference by Goldust. After the match, Goldust chased him and Marlena out of the arena.

==Personal life==
Pillman was a very close friend to the Hart family. Both Pillman and the Harts have referred to themselves as being as close as siblings. Pillman stated that he loved Bret and Owen enough to be willing to do anything for them. He was the only member of the Hart Foundation to not be related to the family through either blood or marriage.

Pillman dated Terri Runnels while they were in WCW together before her marriage to Dustin Rhodes, which would later be utilized in a 1997 angle between Pillman and Goldust. He later married Melanie Morgan (1965–2022) on March 17, 1993. Melanie had two children at the time, Alexis Michelle Reed and Jesse Morgan from her previous relationships. At the time, he also had daughters, Danielle and Brittany, from two previous relationships. Brian and Melanie had two children together, Brian Zachary and Skylar King, the latter born after Pillman&#x27;s death. Melanie also adopted one of Brian&#x27;s daughters, Brittany. Despite not being their biological parent, Pillman is often referred to as the father of Melanie&#x27;s children, Jesse Morgan and Alexis Michelle Reed. Pillman adopted Alexis before his death. Pillman&#x27;s wife Melanie, died on June 1, 2022, at the age of 56.

As per &quot;Brian Pillman: Loose Cannon&quot;, Brian and Melanie were involved in a heated divorce at the time of his death in October 1997. Melanie has said that she meant for the divorce to be a wake-up call for Brian, and they were still living together at the time of Brian&#x27;s passing, but he was banished to the basement.

In 2017, Pillman&#x27;s daughter Brittany claimed that her half-sister Skylar King is not Pillman&#x27;s biological daughter, but the child of another man whom Melanie married shortly after Pillman&#x27;s death, and that all the money given by WWF and wrestlers to support Pillman&#x27;s family was used by Melanie for drugs.

In a 2021 episode of Viceland&#x27;s &quot;Dark Side of the Ring,&quot; Pillman&#x27;s family talked about his life. Melanie Pillman was found dead from issues surrounding her years of drug abuse on June 1, 2022, as confirmed by Brian Jr. She was 56 years old.

In 2024, daughter Brittany Evans signed a Legends Contract with WWE allowing merchandise of the senior Pillman to be offered under her authority.

==Death==
On October 5, 1997, Pillman was scheduled to wrestle Dude Love at the WWF pay-per-view In Your House 18: Badd Blood. Steve Austin relayed that Jim Cornette was instructed to find the whereabouts of Pillman. Cornette contacted the Budgetel Motel in Bloomington, Minnesota, where Pillman had stayed the previous night, and was told by the receptionist that Pillman was found dead in his hotel room by the maids earlier that day at 1:09 p.m. Central Time. He was 35 years old. An autopsy attributed Pillman&#x27;s death to a heart attack. However, Steve Austin explained that this was caused by previously undetected atherosclerotic heart disease, a condition which had also led to the death of Pillman&#x27;s father. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, the WWF paid tribute to Brian Pillman. Later that night, Vince McMahon interviewed Melanie Pillman; the interview was seen as being in poor taste and was awarded &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot;&#x27;s Most Disgusting Promotional Tactic award for that year.

==Legacy==
In early 2008, Pillman&#x27;s adopted daughter Alexis Michelle Reed entered professional wrestling as a valet and ring girl under the name &quot;Sexy&quot; Lexi Pillman. On November 26, 2009, Reed died from injuries sustained in an automobile accident. Reed was 26 years old.

Like his father, Brian Zachary became a football player and played at the high-school level while attending Dixie Heights High School before graduating in 2011. In February 2017, he announced his decision to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps to become a professional wrestler. He added that he wants to follow his father&#x27;s high-flying style and keep his legacy alive. The younger Pillman was trained by Lance Storm and uses the Twitter handle @FlyinBrianJr as a tribute to his father. He made his debut in December 2017, and wrestled for All Elite Wrestling beginning in the summer of 2020, where he, Griff Garrison, and Julia Hart formed a stable, the Varsity Blondes, paying tribute to the 1980s era and to his father&#x27;s tag team with Steve Austin. He left AEW in 2023 and soon after debuted in WWE&#x27;s developmental brand, NXT, under the ring name Lexis King.

<text>The Chasewater Railway is a former colliery railway running round the shores of Chasewater in Staffordshire, England. It is now operated as a heritage railway.

The line is approximately in length, contained entirely within Chasewater Country Park. The route, which forms a horseshoe shape around the lake, passes through heathland, including a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and passes over a long causeway.

==History==
Prior to preservation, the line was part of the network operated by the NCB to serve the coalfields of the Cannock Chase area. The exchange sidings, where the colliery line connected with the Midland Railway, were situated about north of the current Brownhills West Station.

Significant changes happened in 2002/2003 caused by the closure of the original Brownhills West station due to the building of the M6 Toll motorway. This led to the rebuilding of Brownhills West slightly north of the old station with significantly improved facilities, including a new carriage shed and heritage centre, and completion of the Chasetown section of the line (the &#x27;Chasetown Extension Railway&#x27; between Chasewater Heaths and Chasetown Church Street).

In 2016 the Railway was awarded The Queen&#x27;s Award for Voluntary Services.

== Stations ==
* Brownhills West
* Norton Lakeside Halt
* Chasewater Heaths (adjacent to Burntwood bypass)
* Chasetown Church Street

The buildings at Brownhills West house Chasewater Railway Museum.

==Narrow gauge railway==

Volunteers are working to establish a gauge narrow gauge railway close to the heritage centre.

<doc id="782427" wikidata="Q42344" url="?curid=782427" title="Cone">
<text>A cone is a three-dimensional geometric shape that tapers smoothly from a flat base (frequently, though not necessarily, circular) to a point called the apex or vertex that is not contained in the base.

A cone is formed by a set of line segments, half-lines, or lines connecting a common point, the apex, to all of the points on a base. 
In the case of line segments, the cone does not extend beyond the base, while in the case of half-lines, it extends infinitely far. In the case of lines, the cone extends infinitely far in both directions from the apex, in which case it is sometimes called a double cone. Each of the two halves of a double cone split at the apex is called a &quot;nappe&quot;.

Depending on the author, the base may be restricted to be a circle, any one-dimensional quadratic form in the plane, any closed one-dimensional figure, or any of the above plus all the enclosed points. If the enclosed points are included in the base, the cone is a solid object; otherwise it is an open surface, a two-dimensional object in three-dimensional space. In the case of a solid object, the boundary formed by these lines or partial lines is called the &quot;lateral surface&quot;; if the lateral surface is unbounded, it is a &quot;conical surface&quot;.

The axis of a cone is the straight line passing through the apex about which the cone has a circular symmetry.
In common usage in elementary geometry, cones are assumed to be right circular, i.e., with a circle base perpendicular to the axis. If the cone is right circular the intersection of a plane with the lateral surface is a conic section. In general, however, the base may be any shape and the apex may lie anywhere (though it is usually assumed that the base is bounded and therefore has finite area, and that the apex lies outside the plane of the base). Contrasted with right cones are oblique cones, in which the axis passes through the centre of the base non-perpendicularly. 

Depending on the context, &quot;cone&quot; may also mean specifically a convex cone or a projective cone.
Cones can also be generalized to higher dimensions.

== Further terminology ==
The perimeter of the base of a cone is called the &quot;directrix&quot;, and each of the line segments between the directrix and apex is a &quot;generatrix&quot; or &quot;generating line&quot; of the lateral surface. (For the connection between this sense of the term &quot;directrix&quot; and the directrix of a conic section, see Dandelin spheres.)

The &quot;base radius&quot; of a circular cone is the radius of its base; often this is simply called the radius of the cone. The aperture of a right circular cone is the maximum angle between two generatrix lines; if the generatrix makes an angle &quot;θ&quot; to the axis, the aperture is 2&quot;θ&quot;. In optics, the angle &quot;θ&quot; is called the half-angle of the cone, to distinguish it from the aperture.

A cone with a region including its apex cut off by a plane is called a truncated cone; if the truncation plane is parallel to the cone&#x27;s base, it is called a &quot;frustum&quot;. An elliptical cone is a cone with an elliptical base. A generalized cone is the surface created by the set of lines passing through a vertex and every point on a boundary (also see visual hull).

== Measurements and equations==
=== Volume ===

The volume formula_1 of any conic solid is one third of the product of the area of the base formula_2 and the height formula_3 
:formula_4

In modern mathematics, this formula can easily be computed using calculus — it is, up to scaling, the integral formula_5 Without using calculus, the formula can be proven by comparing the cone to a pyramid and applying Cavalieri&#x27;s principle – specifically, comparing the cone to a (vertically scaled) right square pyramid, which forms one third of a cube. This formula cannot be proven without using such infinitesimal arguments – unlike the 2-dimensional formulae for polyhedral area, though similar to the area of the circle – and hence admitted less rigorous proofs before the advent of calculus, with the ancient Greeks using the method of exhaustion. This is essentially the content of Hilbert&#x27;s third problem – more precisely, not all polyhedral pyramids are &quot;scissors congruent&quot; (can be cut apart into finite pieces and rearranged into the other), and thus volume cannot be computed purely by using a decomposition argument.

=== Center of mass ===
The center of mass of a conic solid of uniform density lies one-quarter of the way from the center of the base to the vertex, on the straight line joining the two.

=== Right circular cone ===
====Volume====
For a circular cone with radius &quot;r&quot; and height &quot;h&quot;, the base is a circle of area formula_6 and so the formula for volume becomes

:formula_7

====Slant height====
The slant height of a right circular cone is the distance from any point on the circle of its base to the apex via a line segment along the surface of the cone. It is given by formula_8, where formula_9 is the radius of the base and formula_3 is the height. This can be proved by the Pythagorean theorem.

====Surface area====
The lateral surface area of a right circular cone is formula_11 where formula_9 is the radius of the circle at the bottom of the cone and formula_13 is the slant height of the cone. The surface area of the bottom circle of a cone is the same as for any circle, formula_6. Thus, the total surface area of a right circular cone can be expressed as each of the following:

*Radius and height
::formula_15
:(the area of the base plus the area of the lateral surface; the term formula_8 is the slant height)

::formula_17
:where formula_9 is the radius and formula_3 is the height.
*Radius and slant height
::formula_20

::formula_21
:where formula_9 is the radius and formula_13 is the slant height.

*Circumference and slant height
::formula_24

::formula_25
:where formula_26 is the circumference and formula_13 is the slant height.

*Apex angle and height
::formula_28
::formula_29
:where formula_30 is the apex angle and formula_3 is the height.

====Circular sector====
The circular sector is obtained by unfolding the surface of one nappe of the cone:

*radius &quot;R&quot;
::formula_32

*arc length &quot;L&quot;
::formula_33

*central angle &quot;φ&quot; in radians
::formula_34

====Equation form====

The surface of a cone can be parameterized as
:formula_35
where formula_36 is the angle &quot;around&quot; the cone, and formula_37 is the &quot;height&quot; along the cone.

A right solid circular cone with height formula_3 and aperture formula_39, whose axis is the formula_40 coordinate axis and whose apex is the origin, is described parametrically as
:formula_41
where formula_42 range over formula_43, formula_44, and formula_45, respectively.

In implicit form, the same solid is defined by the inequalities
:formula_46
where
:formula_47

More generally, a right circular cone with vertex at the origin, axis parallel to the vector formula_48, and aperture formula_39, is given by the implicit vector equation formula_50 where
:formula_51
:formula_52
where formula_53, and formula_54 denotes the dot product.

=== Elliptic cone===

In the Cartesian coordinate system, an &quot;elliptic cone&quot; is the locus of an equation of the form

:formula_55

It is an affine image of the right-circular &quot;unit cone&quot; with equation formula_56 From the fact, that the affine image of a conic section is a conic section of the same type (ellipse, parabola...), one gets:
*Any &quot;plane section&quot; of an elliptic cone is a conic section.
Obviously, any right circular cone contains circles. This is also true, but less obvious, in the general case (see circular section).

The intersection of an elliptic cone with a concentric sphere is a spherical conic.

== Projective geometry ==

In projective geometry, a cylinder is simply a cone whose apex is at infinity. Intuitively, if one keeps the base fixed and takes the limit as the apex goes to infinity, one obtains a cylinder, the angle of the side increasing as arctan, in the limit forming a right angle. This is useful in the definition of degenerate conics, which require considering the cylindrical conics.

According to G. B. Halsted, a cone is generated similarly to a Steiner conic only with a projectivity and axial pencils (not in perspective) rather than the projective ranges used for the Steiner conic:

&quot;If two copunctual non-costraight axial pencils are projective but not perspective, the meets of correlated planes form a &#x27;conic surface of the second order&#x27;, or &#x27;cone&#x27;.&quot;

== Generalizations ==

The definition of a cone may be extended to higher dimensions; see convex cone. In this case, one says that a convex set &quot;C&quot; in the real vector space formula_57 is a cone (with apex at the origin) if for every vector &quot;x&quot; in &quot;C&quot; and every nonnegative real number &quot;a&quot;, the vector &quot;ax&quot; is in &quot;C&quot;. In this context, the analogues of circular cones are not usually special; in fact one is often interested in polyhedral cones.

An even more general concept is the topological cone, which is defined in arbitrary topological spaces.

<text>William Bolding Black Jr. (born August 25, 1936) is a former Deputy Director of the National Security Agency.

== Professional career ==

=== Early NSA career (1959–1997) ===
Black joined the National Security Agency in 1959 as an operational linguist/analyst after three years in the Army. While employed at NSA, Black completed a wide variety of assignments including Special Assistant to the Director for Information warfare; Chief A Group (Operations Analysis); Chief, NSA/CSS Representative Europe office (NCEUR); Associate Deputy Director for Operations/ Military Support; and he served as both Chief and Deputy Chief of a major field installation. As he worked his way up to Senior Cryptologic Executive Service, his primary focus was on building new organizations and creating new ways of doing business. Black retired from the NSA in 1997.

=== Vice President at SAIC (1997–2000) ===
In 1997 Black became Assistant Vice President and Director of Information Operations in the Advanced Technologies and Solutions Group of the Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). At SAIC, Black led Information Operations research and worked with the Information Operations Technology Center to establish an Institute for the Analysis of Complex Systems to develop advanced techniques for the analysis of networks and critical infrastructures.

=== Deputy Director at NSA (2000–2006) ===
Black returned to the NSA in 2000 to become deputy director. Since 2002 he was overseeing the Trailblazer Project, which was aimed at analyzing data on computer networks, and at tracking cell phone and email communications. In 2002, the main contract for Trailblazer, ultimately worth US$1.2 billion, had been awarded to Black&#x27;s former employer Science Applications International Corporation. In April 2005, the outgoing NSA director Michael Hayden told a Senate hearing that the Trailblazer program was several hundred million dollars over budget and years behind schedule. After Michael Hayden&#x27;s promotion to Deputy Director of National Intelligence, Black was acting Director of the NSA until the appointment of the new NSA director Lt. Gen. Keith B. Alexander. In August 2006, Black was replaced by John C. Inglis, and offered to take over the position as liaison officer to NSA&#x27;s British intelligence counterpart.

A native of New Mexico, Black currently resides in Pasadena, Maryland with his wife Iris now deceased. They have three children.

<text>Kuusamo (; ; ; ) is a town and municipality in Finland. It is located in Koillismaa, the northeastern part of the Northern Ostrobothnia region. The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is .

The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

Kuusamo is a major center for winter sports and receives approximately a million tourists every year. One of the largest ski resorts in Finland, Ruka, is situated in Kuusamo. Ruka is also the host of many international competitions in ski jumping, cross-country skiing, and Nordic combined. The 2005 World Championships of Freestyle Skiing was held in Kuusamo. Kuusamo Airport is located northeast of Kuusamo&#x27;s town centre.

==History==

===Sami settlement===
Until the 17th century, the area of Kuusamo was inhabited by the semi-nomadic Sami. During the cold season they lived in the villages Maanselkä and Kitka. In spring they moved to the rivers and in summer, after the melting of the ice, to the lakes; there they fished and gathered berries and mushrooms; in autumn they hunted reindeer, bears and beavers in the forest. Apart from fishing and hunting the Sami earned their living by trading fur with the Finns settled on the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia and the Karelians of the White Sea coast.

As a Sami settlement the area belonged to Kuusamo Kemi-Lappmark at the time. Nominally it belonged to the territory of the Swedish province of Västerbotten, but the Swedish rule was limited to the collection of taxes. At the same time Russia collected taxes in the territory it deemed state-less.

===Swedish domination===
From the 15th century Finnish fishermen also took advantage of the fishing grounds on the lower reaches of the river Iijoki near Kuusamo. They took regular trips of a few weeks from Kuusamo, but because the land could not provide hay for the cattle other than near the river, they founded no fixed settlements. Only when, in 1673, the Swedish government granted all settlers in Lapland a tax exemption for 15 years, did settlers from Savo and Kainuu settle in Kuusamo. They practiced slash and burn as a form of shifting cultivation. This put the Sami&#x27;s hunting way of life at risk. Within a few decades the Sami population was assimilated or ousted by the Finnish settlers. By 1718 there were only two Sámi families in Kuusamo, who had already adopted the Finnish language.

The first parish in Kuusamo was founded in 1685. In 1687 a temporary chapel was built, in 1695 the first church. From the end of the 17th century the area around the lake Kuusamojärvi began to be called Kuusamo. The precise etymology of the name is unclear, however, one possible derivation is from a Sami word for &quot;spruce forest&quot;.

The Swedish–Russian border had already been withdrawn east of Kuusamo in the 1595 Treaty of Teusina, but was long and porous. With the constant influx of new settlers, Kuusamo grew steadily in the 18th century. Agriculture, cattle and reindeer husbandry replaced nomadic cropping. Kuusamo around 1770 had about 2,000 inhabitants. In 1775 Kuusamo was removed from Lappmark and added to the newly formed province of Oulu. Because the population had increased, a new, larger church was built between 1797 and 1804. By the beginning of the 19th century the population had reached 3000 inhabitants, but a famine in 1803 and a smallpox epidemic the following year reduced the population again.

===Russian domination===
In 1809, Kuusamo, like the rest of Finland, came under Russian rule. In the first half of the 19th century, the area was ravaged several times by devastating famine and epidemics. Kuusamo was spared by the catastrophic crop failure in 1867, and its population grew steadily thereafter. By 1886, 7,000 people inhabited the city; by 1894, that number grew to 8,000. With the advent of forestry at the end of the 19th century, workers moved into the area, so Kuusamo reached a population of 10,500 by 1910. In 1868, in Finland&#x27;s administrative reform the parish of Kuusamo became a municipality.

===Since independence===

After the independence of Finland in 1917, the Russian border was closed and so Kuusamo was cut off from its hinterland. The forestry sector suffered as no wood could be rafted from Kuusamo to the ports on the White Sea. Even the reindeer economy suffered as some of the herds remained on the Russian side of the border. Therefore, between the wars agriculture developed as the most important part of the economy. By 1925 the population had risen to 14,634, but it fell by around 2000 the next year through the detachment of the villages and Posio Suolijärvi Kuusamo.

At the start of the Winter War Kuusamo was evacuated in December 1939 for fear of a Soviet invasion. In the Moscow Peace Treaty, the Winter War ended on 14 March 1940, Finland lost large parts of Karelia, the eastern areas of Salla and Kuusamo to the Soviet Union. The ceded part of Kuusamo had an area of 1653 square kilometers and included the villages Paanajärvi, Tavajärvi, Vatajärvi, Enojärvi, Pukari and Kenttikylä. Its 2100 residents were relocated to other parts of Kuusamo. During the Continuation War of 1941-1944 Kuusamo was used as a supply depot by German and Finnish troops. When it appeared that Germany might lose the war, Finland secretly negotiated a separate peace with the Soviet Union. After news of the armistice, the civilian population once again abandoned the town for fear of Russian occupation. The Russians did briefly occupy Kuusamo and burned the village to the ground upon their departure. One of the requirements on the treaty was the removal of any and all German troops currently on Finnish soil, which escalated into a minor separate war commonly known as the Lapland War between the Finns and the Germans.

In the years between 1945 and 1952 Kuusamo was rebuilt. By the late 1960s, the population had grown to almost 21,000. As agriculture in the village could not offer enough jobs for the baby boomer generation, the population began to decline rapidly. In 1954, the first ski run on the Rukatunturi was created. Through the expansion of the Ruka ski center, Kuusamo became a tourist center. In 2000, the municipality of Kuusamo was made a town.

==Geography==

Kuusamo lies in the east of Finland in the Northern Ostrobothnia region on the border with Russia. The town of Kuusamo is only a small part of the municipality. The neighboring municipalities of Kuusamo are Suomussalmi in the south, Taivalkoski and Posio in the west, Salla in the north and Russia in the east. The nearest large towns are Rovaniemi, northwest, Oulu southwest, and Kajaani south. The distance to the capital Helsinki is .

Kuusamo covers an area of of which is water. The community center of Kuusamo, where nearly two-thirds of the population live, is only a small part of the territory. The rest of the municipality consists of sparsely populated, mostly wooded areas. Therefore, the population density of Kuusamo is only . Apart from the city, villages include Alakitka, Heikkilä, Hiltunen, Irni, Jokilampi, Kallunki, Kantokylä, Kemilä, Kero, Kesäniemi, Kiitämäjärvi, Koskenkylä, Kuolio, Kurvinen, Kärpänkylä, Käylä, Lämsänkylä, Maaselänkylä, Murtovaara, Poussu, Puutteenkylä, Rukajärvi, Määttälänvaara, Soivio, Suorajärvi, Tammela, Teeriranta, Törmäsenvaara, Vasaraperä, Virrankylä, Vuotunki, Lehto and Kiviperä.

===Landscape and nature===
The city lies on a roughly 250-meter-high plateau, from which the waters flow in five directions. In the area of Kuusamo there are many hills (Finn. &quot;vaara&quot;) and fells (Finn. &quot;tunturi&quot;). The highest elevations are Valtavaara (492 m), Kuntivaara (481 m), Iivaara (469 m) and Rukatunturi (492 m), the site of the Ruka ski center.

Ninety percent of the land area is forested. The forests consist mainly of pine trees (70%) with some spruce (20%) and deciduous trees (10%). or 14% of the area of Kuusamo is covered by water. The largest of the 166 lakes in the area are Joukamojärvi, Kiitämä, Kitka, Kurkijärvi, Kuusamojärvi, Muojärvi and Suininki. Rivers in the area include Oulankajoki, Kitkajoki, Kuusinkijoki and Pistojoki flowing eastward to the White Sea and Iijoki westward to the Gulf of Bothnia.

The area of Oulanka National Park is shared between northern Kuusamo and neighboring Salla municipality. The landscape is dominated by pine forests, Oulankajoki river and its side branches with their sandbanks and rapids, and in the northern part vast marsh areas. In the wilderness live 30 species of mammals and 120 species of birds, including brown, stone and white-tailed eagle. Wolves and lynxes are rare. Rapids in Oulankajoki include Kiutaköngäs, Taivalköngäs, Jyrävä, Niskakoski, and Myllykoski. Near the southern border with Suomussalmi is the canyon lake Julma Ölkky with cliffs up to high.

According to IQAir, Kuusamo&#x27;s air quality is the cleanest in the world; small particulates are present in the air at only 0.2 μg/m3.

===Climate===
The average annual temperature is 0.7 °C, annual precipitation . The warmest month is July with an average temperature of +15.0 °C, coldest January with −11.5 °C. The coldest ever measured temperature was −48 °C in Kiutaköngäs. Kuusamo is one of the snowiest areas in Finland: the ground is snow-covered for about 200 days a year, from late October until mid-May, with a depth of .

The center of Kuusamo is located approximately south of the Arctic Circle, thus polar day and night play a major role. From 14 to 29 June Kuusamo has midnight sun.

==Population==

On Kuusamo had inhabitants. Nearly two-thirds of the population lives in the city center, called the village of Kuusamo, the rest is divided among the villages in the rural hinterland. Like most communities in the Northern and Eastern Finland, there has been marked migration to larger urban areas. The population peaked in the late 1960s at nearly 21,000 residents. With the exception of a period in the 1990s, the population has steadily declined since then.

The migration has had an effect on Kuusamo&#x27;s age structure, as it is mainly young people who leave the town. For example, between 1998 and 2001, the percentage of people aged less than 15 years fell from 25% to 23%, while the share of those aged over 64 years rose from 12 to 14%.

==Economy==
The main economic activities in Kuusamo include forestry, reindeer husbandry, small industries and tourism. The unemployment rate, at 16.2% (2003) is relatively high.

In 2002 there were 248 farms in Kuusamo. Given the climatic conditions, milk and meat production have a major role, including reindeer meat from the approximately 10,000 semi-domesticated reindeer which roam the pastures in Kuusamo. The forestry and wood processing industry also employs over 1,000 people.

===Tourism===
Around one million tourists visit Kuusamo annually. In 2002, 291,222 overnight stays were registered, 17% of which were by foreign guests. There are around 6,000 cottages (mökki) in Kuusamo, more than any other municipality in Finland.

The Ruka ski center, centered on the 492-metre Rukatunturi, is one of the largest in Finland with a total of 16,000 beds, four hotels and 28 restaurants. Activities include skiing, snowmobile tours and excursions with reindeer and dog sleds. Ruka benefits from a long snowy season, from mid-October to mid-June.

In summer, Kuusamo is a popular wilderness destination for fishing, kayaking and hiking. The most popular hiking trail is Bear&#x27;s Ring (Karhunkierros), which runs for , mostly in the Oulanka National Park.

==Transportation==
National highway 5 (E63) connects Kuusamo to Southern Finland. Highway 20 leads from Kuusamo to Oulu, and the main road 81 to Rovaniemi. In Suoperä at Kuusamo, there is a border crossing to Russia, opened for international traffic in 2006. In 2007, 17,000 border crossings recorded.

Kuusamo Airport is from the city center and from Ruka. It was opened in 1969 and has since been expanded several times. The airline Finnair offers daily direct flights from Helsinki, adding charter flights during the tourist season. Seasonal flights are offered by Finncomm Airlines and Blue1 from Helsinki and Rossiya Airlines from St. Petersburg. In 2007, 108,394 passengers used the airport.

==Culture and attractions==

While Kuusamo mainly attracts visitors because of its natural environment, the city has produced little of interest in the traditional sense. Because the city center was completely destroyed in the Lapland War and then had to be rebuilt quickly and economically, Kuusamo is seen as largely uninteresting from an architectural point of view. In contrast - at least considering the small population - the cultural life of the city is relatively lively.

The &quot;Kuusamo Hall&quot; in the town center, completed in 1996, acts as a convention and cultural center. In it one can find regular musical and theatrical performances as well as changing art exhibitions. The Kuusamo Local History Museum is an outdoor museum that has been established on a historic farm. Additionally, a school museum is set up in the old school of Kirkkoketo.

The church in the center of Kuusamo was built in 1951. It stands on the site of the old wooden church from 1802, which was burnt down in 1944 Lapland War by German troops. At that time German soldiers buried the two church bells (one endowed to the church by Charles XI of Sweden in 1698, and the other originating from the year 1721) in the cemetery to secure them from the advancing Soviet troops. The bells were considered lost until 1959, when the former German regimental commander visited Kuusamo and revealed the location of the buried bells. Today these same bells are housed in the rebuilt church.

==Sports==
Kuusamo is the venue of several international winter sports competitions. In Ruka skiing there is a stadium with the Rukatunturi-hill (HS142) and a smaller-K64 ski jumping hill and lighted trails and a biathlon facility. Since 2002, the World Cup kick-off in ski jumping and Nordic combined and cross country skiing World Cup races in Ruka Nordic Opening in late November at a joint event in Kuusamo instead. 2006&#x27;s 16,000 spectators, the competition. Ruka in 2005, the Freestyle Skiing World Cup instead.

<text>Pierina Legnani (30 September 1863 – 15 November 1930) was an Italian ballerina considered one of the greatest ballerinas of all time.

==Biography==
Legnani was born in 1863, in Milan and originally studied with famous ballet dancer Caterina Beretta at La Scala, where she developed her technical expertise. Her professional career took off when she appeared as prima ballerina in the Casati ballet, Salandra, at Alhambra Theatre in London. She was titled prima ballerina for La Scala in 1892, before moving to St Petersburg in 1892, where she reached fame dancing with the Imperial Ballet at the Maryinsky Theatre until 1901.

Under the direction of famous ballet choreographer Marius Petipa, Legnani originated numerous roles including, &quot;Cinderella&quot; in 1893, &quot;Swan Lake&quot; in 1895, &quot;Raymonda&quot; in 1898, and &quot;La Camargo&quot; in 1901. She is widely reputed to be the first ballerina to perform 32 fouettés en tournant in the &quot;coda&quot; of the Grand Pas d&#x27;action of the ballet &quot;Cinderella&quot;. 
The execution of 32 turns on pointe is a bravura achievement emphasizing the dancer&#x27;s strength and technique. A sequence of 32 fouetté turns was later choreographed into the Black Swan solo in act 3 of &quot;Swan Lake&quot; and is still used to this day. Legnani was one of only two ballet dancers appointed &quot;prima ballerina assoluta&quot; at the Maryinsky Theatre.

Her last performance was in the Minkus/Petipa ballet &quot;La Camargo&quot; on 28 January 1901, after which she retired to live in her villa at Lake Como.

After retiring from the stage she lived in Italy and served on the examining board of La Scala Ballet School until 4 months before her death. She died on 15 November 1930, aged 67.

<text>St Helens is the largest town on the north-east coast of Tasmania, Australia, on Georges Bay. It is known as the game fishing capital of Tasmania and is also renowned for its oysters (as are some other areas of Tasmania). It is located on the Tasman Highway, about 160 km east of Tasmania&#x27;s second largest city, Launceston. In the early 2000s, the town was one of the fastest growing areas of Tasmania, and reached a population of 2049 at the 2006 census. By the time of the , it had a population of 2,206.

St Helens is part of the Break O&#x27;Day Council, a council that includes the nearby town of Binalong Bay. St Helens also has its own radio station named Star FM a community station on 93.7 MHz in the town, 100.3 MHz in St Marys and 98.5 MHz in Bicheno. A number of shops can be found in the town along Cecilia Street, such as the Bay of Fires IGA. and Gallery Parnella.

==History==
St Helens was first used as a whaling base in the early 19th century. When tin was discovered in the surrounding area in the 1870s, St Helens became the shipping port for the mines. This was the first time a coach service had been introduced to the town; previous access had only been by sea. The town was named after St Helens, Isle of Wight. Today the town is a popular resort for fishing, swimming and other aquatic activities. Its economy is based largely on tourism, fishing and timber.
Georges Bay Post Office opened on 1 April 1869 and was renamed &quot;St Helen&#x27;s&quot; in 1882.

The first European to explore the St Helens area was Captain Tobias Furneaux who sailed up the coast in 1773. He named the southern point of Georges Bay, St Helens Point.

By the 1830s Georges Bay was being used by whalers and sealers. Not surprisingly the settlement which grew up on the shore became known as Georges Bay and the local Aboriginal people became known as the Georges Bay tribe.

The first official land grant was provided in 1830 and in 1835 the small village was renamed St Helens. It would have continued to be an inconsequential port had not tin been discovered at Blue Tier in 1874. Suddenly the port, and the routes to the tin mines, were awash with miners. Over 1000 Chinese moved through the port. From 1874 until the turn of the century the tin mines prospered.

When the mines closed the miners moved to the coast and many of them settled in St Helens. Slowly the port changed so that today it has a major fishing fleet which is supported by boat building, ships chandlery and other ancillary activities. In recent times tourism, driven by fishing and the town&#x27;s mild climate, has become important.

In 2018, St Helens hosted Triple J&#x27;s annual One Night Stand concert. It featured Vance Joy, Peking Duk, Middle Kids, Alex the Astronaut and The Sleepyheads.

Notable residents of St. Helens include Lee Hartney from The Smith Street Band &amp; Tom Busby from Luca Brasi.

==Environment==

===Important Bird Area===
The town is adjacent to the St Helens Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance as a breeding site for seabirds and waders.

=== Waterfalls ===
35 km to the west is Mount Victoria Forest Reserve near the high St Columba Falls.

===Climate=== 
St Helens experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;, Trewartha: &quot;Cfbk&quot;). Summers are mild to warm with occasional heatwaves; springs and autumns are mild, and winters are cool and cloudy. Rain falls consistently through the year, peaking slightly from November to March. The town receives 86.1 clear days annually, much higher than Melbourne&#x27;s 46 days. 

Being on the east coast, St Helens&#x27; winter temperatures are warmer than most parts of Tasmania due to the foehn effect. Summer temperatures are not as warm as inland areas, however, they are still warmer than those experienced in Hobart. St Helens&#x27; record high temperature is recorded on 30 January 2009, the equal second highest temperature recorded in Tasmania.

<doc id="782444" wikidata="Q972220" url="?curid=782444" title="Reliant Rebel">
<text>The Reliant Rebel is a small four-wheeled economy car that was produced by Reliant between 1964 and 1974. It was designed by Reliant to be a market test to push Reliant into other parts of the market instead of just 3-wheelers.

It was marketed as the smart alternative, because it had a rust-free glass-fibre body, a robust chassis and frugal fuel economy. Many models were produced from 600cc, 700cc, and 750cc with saloon, estate and van variants. It was considered a niche rival to the Austin Mini and Hillman Imp.

== Development ==
The Rebel was the brainchild of Reliant Managing Director Ray Wiggin and was developed after the death of T.L. Williams, the founder of Reliant. 

Wiggin believed in the future people would be driving small 4 wheeled cars in a new car segment as the Austin Mini launch had been so successful and the UK microcar/3 wheeler segment would die off, such as Reliant&#x27;s Regal, so Reliant engineers, after working on the development of the four-wheeled Sabra Carmel with Autocars of Haifa, Israel decided to modify the then-current Regal 3/25 to create a four-wheel vehicle.

They built a rolling chassis using a cut and welded Regal 3/25 chassis and drove it around the Two Gates factory to see if it would work. It was however felt that Reliant&#x27;s 598cc engine wouldn&#x27;t pull the weight of a finished car; consequently, Reliant engineers wanted to keep the 600 engine but tuned it by skimmed the cylinder head and fitted larger valves to give better torque to cope with the car&#x27;s extra weight. 

The Rebel would get its front suspension from the Triumph Herald, brakes from the Triumph Courier van and the steering box from the Standard 10.

Reliant asked Ogle Design to design the Rebel, with the idea that it should look completely different from the Regal, but should save production costs by retaining some of the Regal&#x27;s parts such as its doors, windscreen and dashboard. The resulting car was 138 ins.(3505 mm) in length, 58 ins. (1473 mm) in width, with a wheelbase of 89 ins. (2261 mm). The kerb weight of the Rebel depending on the model was between 1185 lbs. and 1327 lbs. (539 kg to 603 kg). The Rebel made its public debut at the Earls Court Motor Show in 1964. The show cars were pre-production models, built in Turkey and driven to Earls Court to test their durability.

Lots of media attention was given to the Rebel at launch at the Earls Court Motor Show with many publications praising the new Reliant small 4 wheeler, Reliant had over 1000 notices of interest from the public at the show from people interested in purchasing the new car.
Sadly for Reliant they could not fill these early orders, Rebel production was always low and frustrating for customers since Reliant hadn&#x27;t expanded its factory to give the Rebel its own production line, Reliant instead spent the money making a new production line and factory building for the new Scimitar Coupe which was launched alongside the rebel in 1964. So for every Rebel produced Reliant had to shut down Regal production for the Rebel to be produced on that line, something management didn&#x27;t want to do since the Regal was very in demand and more profitable, this was the reason why there was a big marketing push when the Rebel was launched with very few cars being produced thereafter.

The Rebel didn&#x27;t get its own dedicated production line until 1971 during Rebel 700 production. It then lost it in 1974 along with the Bond Bug in order to increase production of the newly launched Reliant Robin to keep up with demand after its 1973 launch.

Not having Rebels readily available at dealers after its launch and for several years thereafter, are the main reasons why production numbers were so low compared to the Regal 3/25 and 3/30 which sold over 100/000 cars over same period. Ray Wiggins had developed the Rebel as a marketing exercise for Reliant to push the company into new parts of market. He wanted people to become aware that Reliant was in this segment of the market, but he did not push the Rebel to sell in huge numbers as expected. Management were more concerned about 3-wheeler production rather than Ray Wiggin&#x27;s longer-term view.

==Models==

The Rebel launched in October 1964 as a saloon with the same 598cc engine as used in the Reliant Regal 3/25 and only one trim level, but with an accessory list. These vehicles were only produced in two production batches in the Tamworth factory in November/December totaling in only around 100 original Rebel built. These vehicles are mostly seen as pre-production as they were built for dealer demonstrations only and the specification changed between each vehicle as the factory tested different fabrics and materials for the interior. The main differences in these early models were the interior which used the dashboard and steering wheel from the regal 3/25, bonnet hinges hidden in the body work, the spare wheel that was fitted under the bonnet and the interior having minimal carpeting and black gel coat.

Rebel prototypes had a larger front grille, after testing it was found to make the cars run too cool so on early cars the grille was not cut out of the molding leaving a &quot;dummy grille&quot; as some people call it.

==600==

Only 6 months after the Rebel&#x27;s launch in 1965, it was relaunched as the Rebel Deluxe (but never actually using this name again). The car was updated with a new dashboard design using different instruments, thicker seats for greater comfort and five leaf springs in the rear instead of seven for a softer ride. The top half of the grill was deleted completely and filled in smooth, orange front indicators replaced the original clear units and a unique steering wheel was added. This model in later years was simply named the Rebel 600.

==700==

The Rebel 700, introduced in October 1967, had several major changes from the 600, including a full chassis redesign using stronger steel and construction, a new engine of 701cc, a move to negative earth and many other specification changes. At the Earl&#x27;s Court Motor Show the estate model was shown for the first time and also announced it was on sale now. The estate used longer rear windows and a large side hinged rear door. Combined with the new fold-flat rear seat this made the Rebel estate incredibly practical, and within two years it was the best-selling model. Later, side windows that slid open could be ordered. In 1971, a van version of the Rebel was introduced after many Rebel estate buyers&#x27; enquiries. The van model was basically the estate but without windows. Rear seats could still be ordered in the van with a rear window DIY kit offered by Reliant dealers - thus meaning you could buy a Rebel van make it into an estate avoiding a large amount of tax. Both the estate and the van offered 46 cu. ft. of load space, which increased in the van to 60 cu. ft. without the optional front passenger seat.
Not many Rebel 700 Vans were produced as production was in development for the 750, many more 750 vans were produced.

==750==

The next evolution of the Rebel was the 750 model, introduced in October 1972. This car gained some parts with the three-wheeled Reliant Robin that was due to be introduced in 1973, parts gained were:
:The new 748cc engine
:Rear light clusters
:Modified version of the 4 speed all sycro gearbox
:Radiator

The Rebel 750 was the most popular Rebel as Reliant gave the Rebel a big marketing push in magazines and newspapers including full-page colour ads, because of this many people were only discovering the Rebel for the first time now with its large range of models.
The interior also had a large change, fatter more comfortable front seats were used with a soft touch padded dashboard, all the interiors now used black vinyl seats and black carpets.
Van production saw a short-lived effort to produce more as Royal Mail needed a replacement for its fleet of Morris vans, they had already trialed the Reliant Supervan but thought the more conventional Rebel van would be a good replacement, only as little as 10 vans were trialed.
In early 1974 with the new Reliant Robin proving to be so popular production on all other models including the Rebel, Bond Bug, Reliant TW9 ended so more Robin models could be made.
In 1975 the Rebel would be replaced with the Reliant Kitten.

==Estate legacy==

The Reliant Rebel estate was the first time Reliant would build a small estate vehicle using a large side hinged door with fold-flat rear seats. Owing to the popularity of this design, Reliant would carry on using this formula for the Regal, Robin and Rialto models until 1998.

==Engines==

The Rebel used all of Reliant&#x27;s own all aluminium OHV engines (based on a reverse-engineered 803cc Standard SC engine used in the discontinued Standard Eight). 

The car was launched with a 598cc engine producing 28 horsepower, this was 4 more horsepower than standard 600cc from the regal 3/25, this was done as the car felt sluggish with its extra weight.

After the introduction of the 70 mph speed limit on British motorways the new speed limit was seen as a target, any vehicle with a top speed lower than 70 mph was seen to be slow, with this Reliant increased the engine size to 701cc and 31 hp, the new engine was then used in both the Rebel and the Regal. The latter model was then named the Rebel 700 in time for the October 1967 London Motor Show. The larger engine gave the Rebel a top speed of 70 mph and would later be fitted into the Regal three-wheeler becoming the regal 3/30.

By 1972 reliant fitted the 750cc engine to the rebel, this was to test the new engine before the launch of the new reliant robin the next year, the same was done with the bond bug 750. At the 1972 Motor Show Reliant launched the reliant 750, with 35 hp it gave the Rebel 750 a top speed of 80 mph but also gave better MPG of up to 65 the gallon.

Rebel engines were always of higher compression and higher horsepower because of the car&#x27;s additional weight compared to the three-wheeled variants. Reliant always introduced a new engine size in the Rebel first, before the Regal or the related Bond Bug received it. All rebel engine numbers end with a capital R to signify it is a rebel engine with its modifications.

==Chassis, suspension and steering==

The chassis from its center back is similar to that of the three-wheeled Regal, but the Rebel features a conventional four-wheel configuration with the front chassis section containing conventional steering and suspension. In the Rebel&#x27;s case, this is the steering box from a Standard Ten with wishbones, trunnions and ball-joints from the Triumph GT6 / Vitesse and Triumph Herald models. The Rebel&#x27;s standard 12-in. steel wheels have a PCD of 4 x 4 in. (4 x 101.6mm) and the car rides on 5.50 X 12 in. tyres.
The leaf springs on the rebel are not Regal as many people believe as the rebel leaf springs are longer.

==Gearbox==
The Rebel was introduced with a four-speed gearbox which features synchromesh on the top three ratios. There is no synchro on first gear. The gearbox was based on that of the Regal, but had an extended tailshaft with a linkage for the gearstick.

By 1972 synchromesh had been extended to all four forward speeds as the gearbox was now based on the Robin gearbox. The gearstick was no longer on a linkage but &quot;projects forward from the front of the transmission tunnel&quot;. &quot;The light-weight body material and the aluminium engine block meant that the car was some 15% lighter than the (slightly shorter) Mini and 35% lighter than the early Renault 5&quot;, which was also introduced in 1972.

==Production numbers==

A total of 2,600 Rebels were made in saloon, estate and van variants. Most were sold in the UK but many were sold in the Caribbean islands. Of the approximately 900 Rebels which were exported, a number of them were in left-hand drive form to suit some of their export market.

As above most of the reasoning behind the low production numbers was Reliant didn&#x27;t give the Rebel its own production line until 1971, before this if a batch of Rebels needed to be produced then Reliant had to stop production of its popular Regal 3/25, something which Reliant didn&#x27;t want to do very often.

== Rebel 1600 GT prototype ==
During the Rebel&#x27;s production run, Reliant had been experimenting with a more sporting variant to complement the Scimitar GT and forthcoming Scimitar GTE. Whereas the existing Rebel was powered by 598-748cc engines with 25-35 hp, the Rebel 1600 GT prototype codenamed FW6 had been fitted with the 80 hp and 92 ft-lb (Net) / 91 hp and 102 ft-lb (SAE) 1599cc Ford Crossflow engine from the mk2 Ford Cortina 1600E. Reliant had a relationship with Ford using their engines in Reliant sports cars with Reliant building Ford&#x27;s fibreglass truck cabs in return. The Rebel 1600 GT was a working road legal prototype and had it been given the go-ahead would have been launched in around 1968, but was never put into production as Reliant Management found out the Rebel 1600 GT could not only out perform the bigger Scimitar models (around the factory as Engineers had been racing them), but also reputedly featured a power-to-weight ratio of 204 bhp per ton which would have exceeded that of many modern sportscars.

Neighbouring municipalities are Heinävesi, Kaavi, Liperi, Polvijärvi and Tuusniemi. The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

The fir-twigged line in the coat of arms of Outokumpu refers to the name &quot;Kuusjärvi&quot; (literally &quot;spruce lake&quot;) at the time the municipality&#x27;s coat of arms was established, and the copper symbol refers to Outokumpu Oyj&#x27;s mines, which later gave their name to the entire township. The coat of arms was designed by Olof Eriksson, and the Kuusjärvi municipal council approved it at its meeting on November 21, 1952. The Ministry of the Interior approved the coat of arms for use on February 18, 1953.

==History==

The municipality was formerly known as &quot;Kuusjärvi&quot;. In 1968 it became a market town and was renamed as Outokumpu after the copper mine located in the municipality. Outokumpu gained town privileges in 1977. The town began to form around the Outokumpu Copper Mine, which was active from 1913 to 1989. The old mining area is still clearly visible as it is situated in the town centre and nowadays it has been developed into a tourist attraction.

==Economy==
The steel manufacturer Outokumpu originates from the town of Outokumpu. Outokumpu Copper Mine was a big employer in Outokumpu from 1913 until 1989 when the mine was shut down.

In Outokumpu there is a rather vibrant industrial park, which was founded in 1979 when it became apparent that the mine was to be shut down during the next decade. Most of the town&#x27;s biggest employers are situated in Outokumpu Industrial Park as it has the role of organizing and developing the local businesses.

Nowadays Outokumpu is home to many technology industry companies such as Outotec Turula workshop, Finelcomp Oy, Okun Hammaspyörä Oy, Okun Koneistuspalvelu Oy and Outokummun Metalli Oy. It is said that in Outokumpu there is one of the highest densities of CNC machines and tools in Finland compared to population.

Relevant employers from other branches of the economy include among others: Piippo Oyj, Mondo Minerals, and HK Scan Finland.

There was some 2,502 jobs in Outokumpu in 2014.

== Tourism ==
Main tourist attraction in Outokumpu is the Outokumpu Old Mine. An area where you can find a mining museum, theme park Children&#x27;s mine for children, some restaurants and a Disc golf track that surrounds the old mining area.

Other destinations of interest are the Outokumpu Nature Park, Keretti Golf track (in an old mining area), lake Juojärvi and the municipal Sports and Swimming Centre.

During summer season you can go for a canoe trip on the small and beautiful lakes surrounding the Outokumpu Nature Park. You can also go fishing in Children&#x27;s fishing Oasis and rent a beach sauna from touristic services.

== Culture ==
=== Food ===
In the 1980s, meat soup called &quot;kaivossoppa&quot; (&quot;mine soup&quot;) and rye-lingonberry porridge were named as Outokumpu&#x27;s traditional parish dishes.

<doc id="782457" wikidata="Q1000109" url="?curid=782457" title="Kyyjärvi">
<text>Kyyjärvi (; ) is a municipality of Finland. It is located in the Central Finland region, about northwest of Jyväskylä. The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is . The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

Neighbouring municipalities are Alajärvi, Karstula, Kivijärvi, Perho and Soini. The municipality centre is located on the shores of Lake Kyyjärvi. Little villages Hokkala, Koskimäki-Huhtala, Kumpula, Noposenaho, Hokkasenaho, Nurmijoki, Oikari, Peuralinna, Pölkki, Saunakylä and Vehkaperä are living mostly from primary production (farming and forestry). Due to its location on the crossroads of two main Finnish roads &quot;(Valtatie 13 and 16)&quot; the municipality has also a remarkable number of services and little companies compared to its size.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name of Kyyjärvi is unknown but there are few theories of it. The first part of the name, &quot;kyy&quot;, is Finnish word for adder (&quot;Vipera berus&quot;), a venomous snake. &quot;Järvi&quot; is Finnish word for lake. Adders can be found in Kyyjärvi, as everywhere in Finland. Another theory is that the first citizens moved to the area from the lake Kyyvesi and gave the name Kyyjärvi for their new home area and lake.

Among the locals, the municipality is playfully nicknamed &quot;Kyy York&quot;, which is a reference to New York. Because of this, the municipality has adopted the following slogan: &quot;Kyy York – pieni kylä, suuri sydän&quot; (&quot;small village, big heart&quot;).

==History==
The area of modern Kyyjärvi was originally hunting grounds for Tavastian people. The village of Kyyjärvi was first mentioned in 1565 as &quot;Kÿierffuj&quot;, when it was a part of the parish of Rautalampi. In 1628, the parish of Laukaa, including Kyyjärvi, was split off from Rautalampi while in 1639, Kyyjärvi became a part of the new Saarijärvi parish established during this year.

In 1775, Kyyjärvi became one of the villages in the new chapel community of Karstula, which became its own parish in 1858. In 1913, it was decided that the territory of the Kyyjärvi school district should become its own municipality and parish. The municipality was established in 1929 while the parish was established in 1944.

===Proposed Suomenselkä municipality===
Kannonkoski, Karstula, Kivijärvi and Kyyjärvi planned to merge into the from January 1, 2022. Karstula, Kivijärvi and Kyyjärvi accepted the merger proposal, but Kannonkoski did not. After Kannonkoski left out of the planned merger, Kivijärvi also left out. The merger project of the remaining Karstula and Kyyjärvi failed at the Kyyjärvi municipal council meeting held on May 17, 2021, and the Ministry of Finance does not propose a forced merger either.

==Nature==
There are all together 46 lakes in Kyyjärvi. Biggest lakes in Kyyjärvi are Lake Kyyjärvi, Heinuanjärvi and Kirvesjärvi.

==Transport==
Kyyjärvi is served by Onnibus route Helsinki—Jyväskylä—Kokkola.

<text>Drumthwacket ( ) is the official residence of the governor of the U.S. state of New Jersey at 354 Stockton Street in Princeton, New Jersey, near the state capital of Trenton.

The mansion was built in 1835 and expanded in 1893 and 1900. It was sold with its surrounding land to the state in 1966. Drumthwacket was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 10, 1975 for its significance in agriculture, architecture, commerce, landscape architecture, and politics. It was designated the governor&#x27;s mansion in 1982.

The estate is administered by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. It serves as the executive residence and is also a historic house museum.

==History==
The land that Drumthwacket is built on was once owned by William Penn, the Quaker proprietor of the Province of Pennsylvania and founder of Philadelphia. William Olden bought it in 1696 and built a small white homestead called Olden House.

In 1799, Charles Smith Olden was born there. Olden gained wealth working at a mercantile firm in Philadelphia and later New Orleans before returning to Princeton, where he began to build Drumthwacket in 1835. The name probably comes from Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s 1819 novel &quot;A Legend of Montrose&quot;, whose comic character Dugald Dalgetty is laird of Drumthwacket. Modern sources say &quot;Drumthwacket&quot; derives from two Scottish Gaelic words meaning &quot;wooded hill&quot;. Olden began his involvement in politics as a gentleman farmer and businessman, as treasurer and Trustee of the College of New Jersey, as a state Senator, and as governor in 1860, the first to live at Drumthwacket. The original structure consisted of a center hall with two rooms on each side, including the -story center section and large portico with six Ionic columns.

In 1893, financier, industrialist, and Princeton University benefactor Moses Taylor Pyne purchased Drumthwacket from Olden&#x27;s widow. Pyne was responsible for major expansions of the home, turning it into a magnificent estate, &quot;surpassing anything previously built in Princeton&quot;. Pyne added two wings on each side of the house in 1893 and 1900, both designed by Raleigh C. Gildersleeve and including a paneled library. Pyne also added park-like landscaping, greenhouses, bridle paths, a dairy farm, and formal Italian gardens.

Pyne died in 1921, and his granddaughter Agnes Pyne sold the property to Abram Nathaniel Spanel in 1941. Spanel was an industrialist and inventor who had immigrated from Russia as a child. He founded the International Latex Corporation, which became the International Playtex Corporation. Many of Spanel&#x27;s staff lived at Drumthwacket, and many of his patented inventions were conceived in the Music Room.

In 1966, the Spanels sold the estate to New Jersey with the intent that it be used as the governor&#x27;s official residence, to replace Morven, the old governor&#x27;s mansion. However, it took 15 years for the estate to be used as an official residence, with the New Jersey Historical Society raising enough funds in 1981.

In 1982, the Drumthwacket Foundation, a non-profit organization responsible for preserving, restoring, and curating the house and its grounds, was established by New Jersey First Lady Deborah Kean. In addition to establishing the Drumthwacket Foundation, Kean also oversaw the conversion of the mansion into the state executive residence. Kean renovated much of the public and ceremonial rooms in the mansion. Before the renovation, much of Drumthwacket was furnished with older, donated furniture, much of which was unsuited for the home&#x27;s new ceremonial role. Debby Kean replaced those furnishings with higher quality, antique furniture and decor needed for the formal residence. Despite her work, Governor Thomas Kean and Deborah Kean chose to live at their own home in Livingston, New Jersey, rather than Drumthwacket.

Governor Jim Florio, who was in office from 1990 to 1994, and First Lady Lucinda Florio were the first gubernatorial couple to live at Drumthwacket. Lucinda Florio also oversaw major renovations and played a key role in its conversion into a modern governor&#x27;s residence. Florio focused much of her work on Drumthwacket&#x27;s private living quarters, which had been largely untouched by her predecessor. Florio and the Drumthwacket Foundation replaced the mansion&#x27;s antiquated heating system, installed new plumbing and drinking water systems, and repaired uneven hardwood floors. Closets and storage spaces, which were absent from bedrooms in homes from the era, were added. Florio also acquired curtains and other window treatments, which were missing from many of Drumthwacket&#x27;s windows. Additionally, beginning in 1990, Florio restored the Italianate gardens on the 11-acres grounds surrounding Drumthwacket using private donations. The gardens were originally created in 1905 by the mansion&#x27;s previous owner, Moses Taylor Pyne, but had fallen into disrepair by the 1990s. In 1990, Lucinda Florio hosted a small wedding reception for her father at the home.

== Use by recent governors ==
*Thomas Kean (1982–1990) lived in his private home in Livingston.
*James Florio (1990–1994) lived full-time in the mansion.
*Christine Todd Whitman (1994–2001) lived part-time in the mansion.
*Donald DiFrancesco (2001–2002) lived part-time in the mansion.
*John O. Bennett (2002) lived in the mansion for his 3½ days as Acting Governor.
*James McGreevey (2002–2004) lived full-time in the mansion.
*Richard Codey (2004–2006) lived part-time in the mansion.
*Jon Corzine (2006–2010) lived part-time in the mansion. Drumthwacket became his full-time residence while he was recovering from injuries sustained in a severe automobile accident.
*Chris Christie (2010–2018) only used the mansion for Sunday dinners and official functions, while living in his private home in Mendham.
*Phil Murphy (2018-) lives in his private home in Middletown and uses the mansion for official functions and meetings.

==Building details and tours==

There are 12 private rooms upstairs used by the first family and six public rooms on the main floor that are the site of many official functions. An annual Garden Club holiday display is a tradition at the property.

Drumthwacket is open for guided tours on most Wednesdays, except for August, the day before Thanksgiving, and several other dates. The tour includes the six public rooms used by the governor for meetings and receptions, as well as the solarium, center hall, dining room, parlor, music room, library, and governor&#x27;s study. Guided tours are conducted by volunteer docents. Visitors can walk through the gardens and visit the Olden House, the restored farmhouse on the property that houses a gift shop and the Drumthwacket Foundation.

<doc id="782471" wikidata="Q419560" url="?curid=782471" title="Succinyl-CoA">
<text>Succinyl-coenzyme A, abbreviated as succinyl-CoA () or SucCoA, is a thioester of succinic acid and coenzyme A.

==Sources==
It is an important intermediate in the citric acid cycle, where it is synthesized from α-ketoglutarate by α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase through decarboxylation. During the process, coenzyme A is added.

With B12 as an enzymatic cofactor, it is also synthesized from propionyl CoA, the odd-numbered fatty acid, which cannot undergo beta-oxidation. Propionyl-CoA is carboxylated to D-methylmalonyl-CoA, isomerized to L-methylmalonyl-CoA, and rearranged to yield succinyl-CoA via a vitamin B12-dependent enzyme. While Succinyl-CoA is an intermediate of the citric acid cycle, it cannot be readily incorporated there because there is no net consumption of Succinyl-CoA. Succinyl-CoA is first converted to malate, and then to pyruvate where it is then transported to the matrix to enter the citric acid cycle.

==Fate==
It is converted into succinate through the hydrolytic release of coenzyme A by succinyl-CoA synthetase (succinate thiokinase).

Another fate of succinyl-CoA is porphyrin synthesis, where succinyl-CoA and glycine are combined by ALA synthase to form δ-aminolevulinic acid (dALA). This process is the committed step in the biosynthesis of porfobilinogen and thus hemoglobin.

==Formation==
Succinyl CoA can be formed from methylmalonyl CoA through the utilization of deoxyadenosyl-B12 (deoxyadenosylcobalamin) by the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. This reaction, which requires vitamin B12 as a cofactor, is important in the catabolism of some branched-chain amino acids as well as odd-chain fatty acids.

<text>Band sergeant major (BSM) is the appointment held by the senior playing musician in a British Army band, who holds the rank of warrant officer class 2 (except for the senior band sergeant major of the Guards Division, who is a warrant officer class 1).

The BSM also functions as the band&#x27;s second senior non-commissioned officer (NCO) after the bandmaster and has various administrative duties. Formerly, in smaller regimental bands commanded by a bandmaster, the BSM was the senior NCO. Prospective BSMs attend a special three-week course at the Royal Military School of Music, one of which is run every year.

The equivalent appointment in the Household Cavalry is band corporal major. The band sergeant in Royal Air Force bands, although holding the lower rank of flight sergeant, has similar responsibilities. The WO2 in a Royal Marines band, like the WO1, holds the appointment of bandmaster.

<text>A route distinguisher is an address qualifier used only within a single internet service provider&#x27;s Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) network. It is used to distinguish the distinct virtual private network (VPN) routes of separate customers who connect to the provider. 

The route distinguisher is an 8-octet field prefixed to the customer&#x27;s Internet Protocol address (IPv4). 
The resulting 12-octet field is a unique &quot;VPN-IPv4&quot; address. There is a more detailed description in RFC 4364.
At the edge of an MPLS provider&#x27;s network, a router which connects to a customer&#x27;s network is called a Provider Edge (PE) router. Similarly, the customer&#x27;s edge router at the other end of the connection is called a Customer Edge (CE) router.
Within an MPLS network, a PE router needs to be configured to associate each route distinguisher with routes which lead to a particular CE router. The PE router may be configured to associate all routes leading to the same CE router with the same route distinguisher, or it may be configured to associate different routes with different route distinguishers, even if they lead to the same CE router.

The route distinguisher has only one purpose: to make IPv4 prefixes globally unique. It is not used for IP forwarding by the provider&#x27;s core (non-edge) routers (within the MPLS cloud), but it is used by the edge routers to identify which VPN a packet belongs to. For example, for a PE router to be able to distinguish between the IP address 10.0.0.0 of one customer from the 10.0.0.0 of another customer, the network administrator must configure the PE to add a unique route distinguisher to each packet arriving from the CEs.

The route distinguisher (RD) is an 8-octet value consisting of two major fields, the Type Field (2 octets) and Value Field (6 octets). The type field determines how the value field should be interpreted.
The three Type values, as defined in the Internet draft, are:

Type 0:

The administrator field must contain an AS number (using private AS numbers is discouraged). The Assigned field contains a number assigned by the service provider.

Type 1:

The administrator field must contain an IP address (using private IP address space is discouraged). The Assigned field contains a number assigned by the service provider.

Type 2:

The administrator field must contain a four-octet AS number (using private AS numbers is discouraged). The Assigned field contains a number assigned by the service provider.

Normally the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) used by the provider&#x27;s routers only looks at the four-octet IP address, but the BGP Multiprotocol Extensions allow BGP to view the entire 12-octet VPN-IPv4 address, and carry routes from multiple &quot;address families&quot;. If the route distinguisher Administrator subfield and the Assigned Number subfield of a VPN-IPv4 address are both set to all zeroes, the VPN-IPv4 address is considered to have exactly the same meaning as the corresponding globally unique IPv4 address. In particular, this VPN-IPv4 address and the corresponding globally unique IPv4 address will be considered comparable by BGP. In all other cases, a VPN-IPv4 address and its corresponding globally unique IPv4 address will be considered noncomparable by BGP. A given per-site forwarding table will only have one VPN-IPv4 route for any given IPv4 address prefix. When a packet&#x27;s destination address is matched against a VPN-IPv4 route, only the IPv4 part is actually matched.

<doc id="782484" wikidata="Q1366429" url="?curid=782484" title="Scottsdale, Tasmania">
<text>Scottsdale is the largest town in north-east Tasmania, Australia, serving as the administrative and economic centre of the Dorset Council region. Located on the Tasman Highway, it connects Launceston to the east coast and acts as a key service hub for surrounding agricultural areas. The town has a strong historical association with potato and dairy farming, forestry, and poppy cultivation, industries that continue to support its economy. In recent years, Scottsdale has expanded into tourism, with attractions such as Barnbougle Dunes Golf Links and the Bridestowe Lavender Estate farm drawing visitors. It is also home to the Defence Science and Technology Group’s nutrition research facility.

Scottsdale is part of the federal Division of Bass and the state electoral division of the same name. According to the 2021 Australian census, Scottsdale had a population of 2,408 residents.

==History==
Scottsdale was first surveyed in 1855 and was noted by surveyor James Reid Scott for its fertile soils and mild climate. The area developed into an agricultural hub, with initial land selections occurring in 1859. The town was originally named Ellesmere before being renamed Scottsdale in 1893.

==Economy==
Scottsdale has long been an agricultural centre, with key industries including potato and dairy farming, forestry, poppy cultivation, and mining. The town has experienced economic diversification, with tourism playing an increasing role in its development. Government investment in infrastructure and small business incentives has contributed to Scottsdale’s regional growth.

The Defence Science and Technology Group operates a nutrition research facility in Scottsdale, originally established in 1958 and redeveloped in 2014. 

Scottsdale’s tourism sector has benefited from attractions such as Barnbougle Dunes Golf Links and the Bridestowe Estate Lavender Farm. The decline of the local timber industry has led to job losses, prompting local initiatives to attract new industries and retrain workers.

==Culture==
Scottsdale has a strong community focus, with local sporting clubs, agricultural shows, and cultural events contributing to its identity. The town supports a range of sports, including Australian rules football, golf, and netball. The Scottsdale Art Gallery Café and other local venues promote regional artists and performers.

===Forest Eco Centre=== 

The Forest Eco Centre was a visitor centre designed to educate the public about the state&#x27;s forestry industry. Developed by award-winning Hobart architect Robert Morris-Nunn and constructed in the late 1990s, it was the first facility of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere to incorporate innovative, environmentally sustainable design principles. The centre’s distinctive conical structure was engineered to maximise passive heating and cooling, with a thermal chimney regulating airflow and temperature. It also housed offices for Forestry Tasmania, a café, and a gift shop showcasing locally crafted timber products. 

Despite its architectural significance, the centre closed in 2014 due to structural issues, including water leaks that caused electrical hazards.
The building was later sold, and in 2022, new owners announced plans to redevelop the site into accommodation with self-contained units and dormitory-style rooms for seasonal workers, tourists, and mountain biking visitors to North-East Tasmania. 

==Demographics==

In the 2021 Australian census, Scottsdale recorded a population of 2,408 people.

The majority of residents (84.5%) were born in Australia, with small migrant communities from England (3.2%), New Zealand (1.1%), and the Philippines (0.7%). English is the dominant language spoken at home by 91.4% of residents, while other languages spoken include Mandarin (0.5%), Italian (0.4%), and Tagalog (0.3%).

The median weekly household income in Scottsdale is $1,150, which is below the national median of $1,746. Approximately 27.3% of households report a weekly income below $650, while 8.9% earn more than $3,000 per week.

Christianity remains the most commonly practiced religion, with 49.2% of residents identifying with a Christian denomination, including Anglicanism (18.5%) and Catholicism (16.4%). 42.8% of residents reported having no religious affiliation, reflecting broader secular trends in Tasmania.

==Climate==
Scottsdale has a oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb), with very mild, relatively dry summers and cool, wet winters. Average maxima vary from in January and February to in July while average minima fluctuate between in February and in July. Mean average annual precipitation is moderate, spread between 151.8 precipitation days, and is concentrated in winter. The town is not very sunny, with 165.9 cloudy days and only 68.0 clear days per annum. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 30 January 2009 to on 6 August 1974.
==Access==
Scottsdale is connected to Tasmania’s road network primarily via the Tasman Highway, which links the town to Launceston to the west and the north-east coast, including Bridport and St Helens. The Bridport Road provides a direct route to Bridport, supporting regional transport and freight movements.

Public transport services are limited, with bus connections provided by local operators linking Scottsdale to Launceston and surrounding towns. The town is serviced by the North East Bus Service, which operates passenger routes to Launceston and other regional destinations.

Historically, Scottsdale was connected to Tasmania’s rail network via the North-East Tasmania Rail Line, which operated between Launceston and Herrick. The railway played a crucial role in supporting the town’s timber and agricultural industries but was decommissioned in the early 2000s. Some sections of the former rail corridor have been repurposed into recreational cycling and walking trails, including the North East Rail Trail, which extends from Scottsdale towards Billycock Hill, attracting cyclists and tourists to the region.

The town’s road infrastructure has been progressively upgraded to accommodate increasing freight and tourism traffic, with improvements made to the Tasman Highway and surrounding routes to enhance safety and accessibility.

<doc id="782487" wikidata="Q499649" url="?curid=782487" title="Nat Adderley">
<text>Nathaniel Carlyle Adderley (November 25, 1931 – January 2, 2000) was an American jazz trumpeter. He was the younger brother of saxophonist Julian &quot;Cannonball&quot; Adderley, with whom he played for many years.

Adderley&#x27;s composition &quot;Work Song&quot; (1960) is a jazz standard, and also became a success on the pop charts after singer Oscar Brown Jr. wrote lyrics for it.

==Early life==
Nat Adderley was born in Tampa, Florida, but moved to Tallahassee when his parents were hired to teach at Florida A&amp;M University. His father played trumpet professionally in his younger years, and he passed down his trumpet to Cannonball. When Cannonball picked up the alto saxophone, he passed the trumpet to Nat, who began playing in 1946. He and Cannonball played with Ray Charles in the early 1940s in Tallahassee and in amateur gigs around the area.

Adderley attended Florida A&amp;M University, majoring in sociology with a minor in music. He switched to cornet in 1950. From 1951 to 1953, he served in the army and played in the army band under his brother, taking at least one tour of Korea before returning to a station in the United States. After returning home, he attended Florida A&amp;M intending to become a teacher.

Shortly before Adderley was expected to begin student teaching, Lionel Hampton played a concert at Florida A&amp;M. Confident in his abilities, he played for Hampton, and Hampton invited him to join the band. Putting school on hold, he played under Hampton from 1954 to 1955 and visited Europe on tour. After returning, he intended to go back to school to become a teacher.

==Career==

===1950s===
The turning point in the Adderley brothers&#x27; careers occurred on a trip to New York in 1955. The brothers stopped by the Café Bohemia in Greenwich Village when bassist Oscar Pettiford was playing. Both of them showed up ready to play. Cannonball was asked to sit in because the regular saxophonist, Jerome Richardson was out, and he overwhelmed the musicians. Then Nat was pulled on stage, and everyone was equally impressed. This appearance was enough to renew their careers. Job offers began pouring in, and Nat recorded for the first time that year.

The brothers moved to New York City, founding the bop group Cannonball Adderley Quintet in 1956. Due to a lack of popular interest, they disbanded the group in 1957. Nat played for trombonist J. J. Johnson for a couple of years and ended up in the Woody Herman sextet. Cannonball gained a higher profile and joined the Miles Davis sextet alongside John Coltrane in time to record the album &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;.

In 1959, the Cannonball Adderley Quintet reunited. This time around the group was more successful and had its first hit, &quot;This Here&quot;, written by pianist Bobby Timmons. The group sound became known as soul jazz, starting the genre. The quintet also played hard bop, as everyone in the group had been influenced by bebop and wanted to continue a virtuosic tradition. Soul jazz kept the group popular, while hard bop gave the musicians a chance to challenge themselves and demonstrate their abilities.

===1960s===
During the 1960s, Adderley acted as cornetist, composer, and manager for the quintet. While he kept the band in order, he also composed some of the group&#x27;s most successful songs. His most successful song was &quot;Work Song&quot; (January 1960), a hard bop tune. Adderley called it his &quot;Social Security song&quot; due to the steady flow of income over the years from royalty payments when others recorded the song. &quot;Work Song&quot; is now considered a jazz standard. His other popular songs include &quot;Jive Samba&quot;, &quot;Hummin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Sermonette&quot;, and &quot;The Old Country&quot;.

While he was an integral part of the Cannonball Adderley Quintet, this was not the only project occupying his time in his career as a professional jazz musician. Since moving to New York, he had been recording outside the Adderley group. He worked with Kenny Clarke, Wes Montgomery, and Walter Booker.

Other projects included the film &quot;A Man Called Adam&quot; (1966). In the film, Sammy Davis Jr.&#x27;s character plays the trumpet. Since Davis could not himself play the trumpet, Adderley was hired to ghost everything that the character played. His other significant project during this time was a musical. He and his brother wrote &quot;Shout Up a Morning&quot; based on the folk hero John Henry. While this project started as a collaboration, work was interrupted when Cannonball died from a stroke.

===1970s===
After Cannonball&#x27;s death in 1975, the quintet broke up. Nat Adderley toured Europe as a headliner. He toured Japan, then returned to the U.S. and taught courses at Harvard while performing and recording with his quintet, which included Walter Booker, Jimmy Cobb, and Vincent Herring. Adderley established himself in his own right. He also worked with Ron Carter, Sonny Fortune, Johnny Griffin, and Antonio Hart.

===1980s and later years===
Adderley created the Adderley Brotherhood, a sextet which included several members of the Cannonball Adderley Quintet. This group toured Europe in 1980. &quot;Shout Up a Morning&quot;, after having a concert performance in Carnegie Hall shortly after Cannonball&#x27;s death, was staged in several locations around the United States in 1986. Adderley became involved in several other ensembles over the next decade, including the Paris Reunion Band and a group called the Riverside Reunion Band (after the Riverside label), a bop group that formed at the Monterey Jazz Festival in 1993 and then toured Europe in 1994.

Adderley spent half the year touring and the other half at home in Lakeland, Florida, writing and recording. He thought many of his greatest fans were in Japan, but Europeans were also enthusiastic about the music.

In 1997, he joined the faculty of Florida Southern College as an artist-in-residence. He also helped in the founding and development of the annual Child of the Sun Jazz Festival held annually at the university which he headlined for over a decade. During the same year, he was inducted into the Jazz Hall of Fame in Kansas City.

He lived on 112th Street in Harlem in the 1960s and in Teaneck, New Jersey, in the 1970s, before moving to Lakeland. He also lived near his brother in Corona, Queens.

===Death and legacy===
Nat Adderley died as a result of complications from diabetes at the age of 68 in Lakeland, Florida. He was interred near his brother in the Southside Cemetery in Tallahassee, Florida. He was survived by his wife, Ann; a son, Nat Adderley Jr. of West Orange, N.J.; a daughter, Alison Adderley-Pittman of Palm Bay, Florida; and five grandchildren.

He was an innovator in the popularization of soul jazz and was one of the most prolific jazz artists of his time, recording nearly 100 albums. He proved that cornet could be a modern jazz instrument.

==Style==
Although Adderley started playing trumpet, he switched to the less common cornet. He preferred the darker tone of the conical cornet to the brighter sound of the cylindrical trumpet. He could produce a rich, earthy tone that became his signature sound, one that could only come from the cornet. He also enjoyed the cornet&#x27;s historic quality, reinvigorating the instrument played by early jazz musicians.

Adderley is widely attributed with the development and establishment of the 1960s style of soul jazz along with the rest of the members Cannonball Adderley Quintet. This style is characterized by simple harmonies, a heavy blues feel, catchy riffs, and a presence of the church. The point of soul jazz was to bring back a simpler type of jazz that had direct influence from blues and church music.
However, this is not the only style that Adderley wrote and played. The quintet was also widely known for their hard bop, which comprised roughly half of their recorded work. This is a rougher, edgier style descended from bebop, and virtuosic abilities are required to be able to play it.

As a soloist and composer, Adderley had a wide range of abilities. He could improvise simpler, more soulful solos for soul jazz numbers, but he could experiment and show off all of his abilities for hard bop. Especially in playing hard bop, he was not afraid to use the range of the instrument, often playing below the typical cornet range for short bursts before returning to the normal range. Although his range was starting to fade by the late 1960s, this did not keep him from continuing to play for the rest of his life.

<text>Smithton is a town on the far north-west coast of Tasmania, Australia. It lies on the Bass Highway, 85 km north-west of Burnie. At the , Smithton had a population of 3,934. Smithton is the administrative centre of the Circular Head Council.

==History==
Duck River Post Office opened on 1 November 1873 and was renamed &quot;Smithton&quot; in 1895. In 1905 Smithton was declared a town and the Mowbray swamp (now part of the locality of Mella) was drained for dairy pasture. It was here that, in 1920, the 45,000 year old skeleton of a Zygomaturus (marsupial hippopotamus) was discovered.

In 1905, the jetty at Smithton was 1200m long.

The first regular rail service on the Marrawah Tramway started in 1913. In 1919 The Stanley–Trowutta railway commenced services and by 1921 the Smithton to Irishtown link was opened. By 1922 the railway link from Myalla to Wiltshire Junction was completed, thus joining the railways in the municipality to the state system. Smithton High School was opened in 1937 and in 1951 a Kindergarten and Public Hospital were opened in Smithton, and the town began to flourish.

==Economy==
The economy of Smithton is agriculture based, consisting primarily of dairy and beef farming. Other major industries that contribute to the local economy are fishing, aquaculture, crop farming, timber plantations and tourism.

As a major centre in the northwest of the state, several companies have established processing plants in Smithton. Major employers in the town include Greenham Tasmania, who operate a meat processing plant that prepares beef for export to Japan and the United States as well as Australian markets. The plant employs over 120 staff. McCain Foods (Australia) Pty Ltd maintain potato storage, processing and freezing facilities in the town for the production of French fries. The McCain plant operates year-round and employs a workforce of 150 from the local community. Two timber mills are also located in Smithton, operated by Britton Bros and Ta Ann Tasmania. Tasmanian Seafoods Pty Ltd operate an abalone processing facility and cannery as well as having their head office located in the town. Also, Murray Goulburn (Dairy Company) have offices there.

Tarkine Fresh Oysters (Bolduans Bay Oysters P/L) also run a significant aquaculture facility in Smithton, employing more than 40 people.

==Infrastructure==
The education community consists of a Catholic independent, a Christian school and government schools. St Peter Chanel is the local Catholic primary school servicing the community. Circular Head Christian School is the local Christian school, which starts at Kindergarten and goes right through to year 12.

The National Broadband Network ran a trial rollout in Smithton, with the first customers connected in July 2010.

In 1996, a Cultural Heritage Centre and Museum was started in Smithton to preserve many of the artifacts from Smithton&#x27;s settlement and is still run today by local volunteers. It houses a collection of photos, tools and other day to day memorabilia used in the Circular Head area.

== Climate ==
Smithton has a Mediterranean-influenced oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb/Csb), with very mild, relatively dry summers and cool, wet winters. Average maxima vary from in February to in July while average minima fluctuate between in February and in July. Mean average annual precipitation is moderate: , and is strongly concentrated in winter. Due to being windward of the Central Highlands, precipitation is very frequent: spread between 208.3 precipitation days. The town has 183.4 cloudy days and only 38.1 clear days per annum. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 30 January 2009 to on 19 June 2024. Temperature extremes were combined from the closed Grant Street and the open Smithton Airport weather stations.

==Notable people==
Noted former Smithtonians include:
* Hannah Gadsby (born in Smithton, 1978), comedian, winner of the Edinburgh Comedy Awards in 2017
* Enid Lyons (born in Smithton, 1897), first woman elected to the Australian House of Representatives

<text>Hampton Loade is a hamlet in Shropshire, England along the Severn Valley. It is situated on the east bank of the River Severn at , some five miles south of Bridgnorth.

The unusual current-operated Hampton Loade Ferry, a reaction ferry to the hamlet of 
Hampton on the west bank, is responsible for Hampton Loade&#x27;s name, as &quot;Loade&quot; is derived from &quot;lode&quot;, an old English word for ferry. However, the ferry has not been run since 2016, prompting speculation that it is permanently closed. This has not been confirmed by any reliable news sources, but according to the Severn Valley Railway it has ceased operation.

The hamlet is notable for the forge that stood there from 1608 to 1922. There are remnants of the forge still standing beside the river and in the houses. &quot;Old Forge House&quot; is where the owner of the forge lived and it is stated that there were over 6 owners of the forge in the 306 years of its use. &quot;Old Forge Cottage&quot; is where it&#x27;s thought the workers lived.

Hampton Loade station, on the preserved Severn Valley Railway, is actually located on the Hampton side of the river although the whole area is often known locally Hampton Loade due to the presence of the station.

== Waterworks bridge ==

There is an unusual bridge close to Hampton Loade: a small private roadway belonging to South Staffordshire Water is suspended below two large water pipe arches, used to pump water from the river to Chelmarsh Reservoir, by the South Staffordshire Water works.

== Sat-nav error ==
The hamlet is also home to a satellite navigation error where the ferry is listed as a car ferry or a bridge on certain sat-nav systems; there are now road signs in place warning of the error on the approach to the hamlet.

==Landslide of June 2007==

On the night of 19 June 2007, the village of Hampton on the west bank suffered major damage as a result of a severe rainstorm. The one and only road into the village was washed away (BBC photo), and large sections of nearby Severn Valley Railway track subsided.

<doc id="782496" wikidata="Q81556" url="?curid=782496" title="Homeland Union">
<text>The Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats (, TS–LKD), also colloquially known as the Conservatives (), is a centre-right political party in Lithuania. It has 18,000 members and 28 of 141 seats in the Seimas. Its current leader is Laurynas Kasčiūnas following the resignation of Gabrielius Landsbergis in 2024 after the party&#x27;s loss in the recent election. It is a member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP).

Since 1996, the party has included the western house martin in its various logos over the years.

== Platform ==
It is the main centre-right party, and has been traditionally allied to other centre-right or liberal parties such as the Liberals&#x27; Movement, Freedom Party, Liberal and Centre Union or the National Resurrection Party with which they are usually grouped together and formed coalitions in the past.

The Homeland Union is conservative. For most of its existence, it has explicitly defined itself as anti-communist (mainly because the main opposition party to the Homeland Union was the Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania, which was created from the Communist Party of Lithuania in 1990), with an ideology influenced by liberal conservatism, Christian democracy, and nationalism. TS–LKD is economically liberal, supports a free market economy and was described as neo-liberal.

After the election of Gabrielius Landsbergis as leader of the party in 2015 (especially after 2017), the Homeland Union started to describe itself as the country&#x27;s people&#x27;s party () and moved more to a centrist direction, rebranding itself as a European moderate party, while still maintaining centre-right profile (especially on economics).

==History==
===Establishment, expansion, the first government and splits (1993–2000)===
It was founded in May 1993 by the right wing of the Reform Movement of Lithuania, led by Vytautas Landsbergis, who had led Lithuania to independence. His supporter, former Prime Minister of Lithuania Gediminas Vagnorius, became party Board&#x27;s chairman. Some members of Sąjūdis coalition, but not Sąjūdis itself (e. g. Vilija Aleknaitė-Abramikienė), joined new party. The party was established by the model of then–ruling conservative parties&#x27; – United States Republican Party, United Kingdom Conservative Party and Moderate Party.

In December 1993, the party&#x27;s youth wing, Young Conservative League, was formed. In February 1994, the Homeland Union formed its own parliamentary group in Seimas. Later that year, the Homeland Union established its branches in all of Lithuania. In the 1995 municipal election, in which the party stood for the first time, it got 28.76% of the vote and returned 428 councillors. In the 1996 national elections, it secured 31.3% of the vote and returned 70 deputies to the Seimas. After these elections, the party formed coalition government with the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party (and received support from the Lithuanian Centre Union).

After presidential election of 1997 and 1998, in which Vytautas Landsbergis came third, party&#x27;s internal conflicts became pronounced. It led to the expulsion of Laima Liucija Andrikienė and Vidmantas Žiemelis from the party&#x27;s board in late 1998 and their resignation from the party in 1999.

In 1999, conflicts started between the President Valdas Adamkus and the Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius (who also was the party&#x27;s Board chairman), that involved party&#x27;s leader Vytautas Landsbergis. Crisis (and resignation of Vagnorius) sped up reorganisation of party structures. Most important of them was the merger of the Political Council and the Board, which produced centralized leadership. In 2000, Gediminas Vagnorius&#x27; supporters split and new party called the Union of Moderate Conservatives was formed.

Yet another split was caused by the resignation of Rolandas Paksas (he replaced Gediminas Vagnorius as the Prime Minister and party&#x27;s Board chairman), although most of the Rolandas Paksas&#x27; supporters moved to the Liberal Union of Lithuania in 1999 and 2000. In 2000 municipal elections, the party received just 8.8 per cent of the vote ant mayorships of Kaunas and other districts.

===Back in opposition, consolidation and the second government (2000–2012)===
In 2000, the Homeland Union was reduced to 8.6 per cent of votes and 9 deputies. In 2001, idea of merge of all right wing parties was proposed by the Homeland People&#x27;s Party. This proposal was accepted by the Homeland Union. In 2003 and 2004, it merged with the Right Union of Lithuania (which by itself was founded by former members of the Homeland Union and various minor parties) and the Lithuanian Union of Political Prisoners and Deportees respectively. At the same time, the party attracted members from Lithuanian Social Democracy 2000 (e.g. Rimantas Jonas Dagys) and Modern Christian-Democratic Union (e. g. Egidijus Vareikis).

In May 2003, a new leader was elected, Andrius Kubilius, who prior this served as deputy leader of the party. Since 2003, the party started cooperating with the Liberal and Centre Union. The Homeland Union changed its logo (the Columns of Gediminids were replaced by green marlin&#x27;s silhouette, which was similar to the logo used by the time of 1996 parliamentary election campaign, in which Kubilius was author of programme).

After Lithuania&#x27;s admission to the European Union in 2004, it won two seats in the election to the European Parliament, one of whom was Vytautas Landsbergis, who sat in the EPP-ED Group. At the 2004 election to the Seimas, the party won 14.6% of the popular vote and 25 out of 141 seats. After these elections, the Homeland Union proposed the Liberal and Centre Union a coalition with the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, but this didn&#x27;t came to being. Between 2006 and 2007, the party supported Gediminas Kirkilas-led government.

Until the merger with the Lithuanian Union of Political Prisoners and Deportees and the Right Union of Lithuania, it was known just as the Homeland Union (Lithuanian Conservatives). Prior to 2008 it was known as the Homeland Union (Conservatives, Political Prisoners and the Exiled, Christian Democrats) or TS. The last change of the name was a result of the merger with the Lithuanian Nationalist Union on 11 March 2008, and the Lithuanian Christian Democrats on 17 May 2008, after which the Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats became Lithuania&#x27;s largest party with more than 18,000 members. After these two mergers, youth wings of these parties (Young Nationalists Organisation and Young Christian Democrats) became the Homeland Union&#x27;s youth wings.

During 2006 to 2008, the Homeland Union supported the Statesmen () conspiracy theory, which claims that a deep state in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the State Security Department of Lithuania (VSD) seeks to take control of the country. According to Antanas Valionis, the party interpreted state security investigations into previous unexplained incidents, such as the Bražuolė bridge bombing in 1994 and the bombing of the editorial office of &quot;Lietuvos rytas&quot; in 1995, as a conspiracy against them.

At the 2008 legislative election, the Homeland Union won 19.69 per cent of the national vote and 45 seats in the Seimas. Becoming the largest party in the Seimas, it formed a coalition government with the Liberal Movement, Liberal and Centre Union and the National Resurrection Party. Together, they held a majority of 80 out of 141 seats in the Seimas, and the Homeland Union&#x27;s leader, Andrius Kubilius, became Prime Minister for a second time.

In 2010, party&#x27;s deputy chairman Vidmantas Žiemelis resigned from the party and joined Christian Party. It (along with the split in the National Resurrection Party parliamentary group) caused Kubilius–led government to become a minority one.

In June 2011, the Lithuanian Nationalist Union declared its withdrawal from the party, although Nationalist faction remained in the Homeland Union. In June 2012, Aurelija Stancikienė resigned from the party and joined the Way of Courage.

===Opposition and the third government (2012–2024)===
Support for the party decreased in the 2012 parliamentary election, and it was excluded from the government. It was credited to many unpopular decisions made during the time of government, and the unpopularity of the Andrius Kubilius. In the 2014 European Parliament election, the party managed to defeat by narrow margin their main competitors, the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania. After 2015 municipal election, Andrius Kubilius resigned from party&#x27;s leader position.

Subsequent leadership election was won by the Member of European Parliament (and former advisor of Andrius Kubilius) Gabrielius Landsbergis. Gabrielius Landsbergis initiated various changes in the party. Main change was that in large cities candidates to the Seimas were replaced with younger candidates, while older candidates moved rural constituencies (e. g. Rasa Juknevičienė stood in Aukštaitija single-member constituency instead of one in Žaliakalnis) or removed altogether (e. g. Arimantas Dumčius was expelled for remarks over Adolf Hitler&#x27;s economic policy).

Between 2014 and 2016, the party was competing on the centre-right political wing with the Liberal Movement, but due to the so-called MG Baltic corruption scandal in May 2016, the Liberal Movement lost about half of its support. As a result of the scandal, the Homeland Union&#x27;s support slightly increased at the 2016 legislative election (and it overtook the Lithuanian Peasant and Greens Union by 0.18 per cent), but, due to failure to win more single-member seats in Seimas, the number of seats held by the party fell to 31.

After these elections, various pundits claimed that the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union could form coalition with the Homeland Union, but leader of Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union Ramūnas Karbauskis proposed wide coalition between aforementioned parties and the Social Democratic Party. The Homeland Union&#x27;s leader Gabrielius Landsbergis himself proposed coalition between the Homeland Union, the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union and the Liberal Movement, although both Ramūnas Karbauskis and Liberal Movement&#x27;s leader Eugenijus Gentvilas turned down this offer. Eventually, coalition was formed between the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union and the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, which lasted until the autumn of 2017.

After Landsbergis reelection as party&#x27;s leader in 2017, primaries were introduced for candidates to the presidential nominees and party list in parliamentary election.
In 2018, Mantas Adomėnas&#x27;s membership in the party was suspended due to relations of MG Baltic and Adomėnas himself. Later, Adomėnas left Homeland Union&#x27;s parliamentary group and the party itself. By autumn of 2018, the party held presidential primaries (the first party in Lithuania to do so), which were won by Ingrida Šimonytė. Šimonytė&#x27;s performance in 2019 presidential election raised possibility about her nomination to the first place on party&#x27;s list and as the future Prime Minister.

In 2020, members of the Homeland Union, Rimantas Dagys and Egidijus Vareikis formed new party, the Christian Union.

In 2020 parliamentary election the party won the most seats (50) and agreed to form coalition with the Liberal Movement and the Freedom Party. In November 2020, Ingrida Šimonytė became the new Prime Minister of a Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats-led coalition.

In 2023 municipal elections Homeland Union managed to win a mayorship of Vilnius (for the first time since 2011), but lost mayorships and majorities in rural councils. In 2024 presidential election Ingrida Šimonytė was selected as candidate from the party, but she lost incumbent President of Republic Gitanas Nausėda.

=== Again in opposition (from 2024) ===

In the parliamentary election of the same year, Homeland Union won 18.35 per cent of the vote, but won just 28 seats due to poor performance in single-member constituencies. Gabrielius Landsbergis announced his resignation as leader of the Homeland Union and as member of the next Seimas. His vice, Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė, replacing him as interim leader. It triggered new leadership election in 2025.

==Popular support==

During the 1990s, the party was strong in urban areas with Panevėžys and Kaunas being its strongholds. It could explained by national composition in these urban areas (Lithuanians in 2001 census made up 95 and 92 per cent of population respectively). In rural areas the party was strongest in Alytus and Lazdijai districts. Although the party lost two-thirds of its support nationwide during 1997 and 2000, these areas remained supportive to the party up until early 2010s. The one exception would be Pasvalys district, where the party managed to obtain over 20 per cent of the vote in 2000 municipal elections.

After the 2008 merger with Lithuanian Christian Democrats, Homeland Union gained support from Molėtai district, which was stronghold of Lithuanian Christian Democrats. In early 2010s with the rise of public election committees the Homeland Union lost support in Panevėžys and Kaunas. In return, due to internal migration and suburbanisation, the party gained support in Vilnius area (notable example, Naujoji Vilnia).

==Organisation==

===Factions===

First faction to be established within the party was Christian Democrats&#x27; faction in 2003. Since then (mainly due to mergers with other parties) new factions were established.

The party currently is split into factions, which are based by former parties:
* Lithuanian Christian Democrats (Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats&#x27; by-law recognises this faction as a separate entity within the party). Notable members: Irena Degutienė, Paulius Saudargas.
* Political Prisoners and Deportees. Notable members: Gabrielius Landsbergis, Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė.
* Nationalists

<doc id="782504" wikidata="Q2589766" url="?curid=782504" title="Riverside Drive (Manhattan)">
<text>Riverside Drive is a north–south avenue in the New York City borough of Manhattan. The road runs on the west side of Upper Manhattan, generally paralleling the Hudson River and Riverside Park between 72nd Street and the vicinity of the George Washington Bridge at 181st Street. North of 96th Street, Riverside Drive is a wide divided roadway. At several locations, a serpentine service road diverges from the main road, providing access to the residential buildings. Several viaducts connect the various segments of Riverside Drive, including the Manhattan Valley Viaduct between Tiemann Place and 135th Street. A disconnected section of Riverside Drive exists in Inwood, Manhattan. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission has designated the original section of Riverside Drive, between 72nd and 125th streets, as part of a scenic landmark that also includes Riverside Park.

Riverside Drive was proposed as part of Riverside Park, which was established by land condemnation in 1872. Originally known as Riverside Avenue, the road opened in 1880 and originally ran between 72nd Street and the current site of Grant&#x27;s Tomb. The park and avenue were originally designed by architects and horticulturalists such as Calvert Vaux and Samuel Parsons. Riverside Drive was extended north to 155th Street in the 1900s, and a viaduct carrying Riverside Drive West between 155th and 161st streets was built in the 1920s. Traffic flow on Riverside Drive was modified several times throughout the years, and the viaducts have been renovated as well. A southern extension, known as Riverside Boulevard, was built starting in the 1990s when the Riverside South complex was developed.

Between 72nd and 125th streets, nearly every block of Riverside Drive is part of a New York City historic district, and the buildings on these blocks date from before World War II. The eastern side of Riverside Drive originally included luxuriously finished row-houses interspersed with free-standing mansions, though few of the mansions remain. Some remaining mansions are the Schinasi Mansion on 107th and the Isaac L. Rice Mansion on 89th. Many of Riverside Drive&#x27;s apartment buildings date from between the 1900s and the 1930s, with curving facades along the avenue; some of these buildings are designated as city landmarks. Along Riverside Drive, there are also numerous monuments such as Grant&#x27;s Tomb and the Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Monument, in addition to other structures such as Riverside Church. Riverside Drive has received commentary for its landscape features and architecture, and it has been depicted in works of popular media.

== Route description ==
Starting at 72nd Street, Riverside Drive passes through the Manhattan neighborhoods of the Upper West Side, Morningside Heights, Manhattanville, Hamilton Heights, and Washington Heights. Commercial vehicles are banned from parts of Riverside Drive.

Unlike other avenues in Manhattan, Riverside Drive is curved because its original designer, Frederick Law Olmsted, did not like sharp corners. A narrow service road diverges from Riverside Drive at several points, creating traffic islands. For a short stretch near 122nd Street, the avenue splits into two roadways, one each to the west and east of Grant&#x27;s Tomb; the western roadway carries southbound traffic, while the eastern roadway carries northbound traffic. There are several viaducts along the route of Riverside Drive, including at 96th Street on the Upper West Side; between Tiemann Place and 135th Street in Manhattanville; and between 155th and 161st streets in Hamilton Heights. The street atop the viaduct in Hamilton Heights is officially named Riverside Drive West, while the original Riverside Drive curves inland.

North of 181st Street, Riverside Drive merges with the northbound lanes of the Henry Hudson Parkway; as such, there is a gap in the road between 181st Street and Dyckman Street. A disconnected section of Riverside Drive begins at the Henry Hudson Parkway&#x27;s Dyckman Street exit in Inwood, ending at Broadway. South of 72nd Street, Riverside Drive continues as Riverside Boulevard, which extends south to 59th Street.

=== Viaducts ===

==== 96th Street ====

A small bridge carries Riverside Drive over 96th Street. The bridge, also known as the Riverside Bridge, was designed by Carrère and Hastings. When this overpass was built, it was described as a viaduct with buttresses and stone terraces leading down to Riverside Park and the Hudson River. Semicircular shelters were also built next to the viaduct on either side of 96th Street. Although the overpass is clad with stone, its superstructure is made of steel. As built, it had four elaborate electric lampposts, each measuring high.

==== Manhattan Valley Viaduct ====

Between Tiemann Place and 135th Street is the Manhattan Valley Viaduct, which carries Riverside Drive above 12th Avenue. Built in 1901, it is variously called the 125th Street Viaduct or Riverside Drive Viaduct. Murray Roe designed the Manhattan Valley Viaduct, while Francis Stuart Williamson was the chief engineer. Despite the structure&#x27;s utilitarian role as a highway, it was also a strong symbol of civic pride, inspired by America&#x27;s late 19th-century City Beautiful movement. The viaduct&#x27;s original roadway, wide pedestrian walks and overall design was highly ornamented. The surrounding area is part of the Manhattanville valley, which contains a fault.

As planned, the viaduct measured long, excluding the approaches. The viaduct carries a roadway measuring wide, as well as a wide sidewalk on either side of the viaduct. The viaduct measures above mean high water at 125th Street and above mean high water at 135th Street. It is divided into 26 bays, each comprising a single span. Twenty-two of the spans are long; one of the spans, crossing 125th Street, is long; and the three northernmost spans are of irregular length. Each arch is composed of latticed plate girders measuring long. Under the roadway are transverse steel girders, which were built in several pieces and riveted together; each girder is deep. The main span above 125th Street is supported by two plate girders measuring across, which were described as the world&#x27;s largest steel girders at the time of the viaduct&#x27;s completion. In total, about 400 girders are used to support the roadway.

Including the approaches to the south and north, the viaduct has a total length of or . The northern approach is long, while the southern approach is long. The approaches are of rock-faced Mohawk Valley limestone with Maine granite trimmings, the face work being made up of courses of ashlar. The southern approach consists of a semicircular wall with stone staircases on either side. This was intended to give a broad plaza effect, which was intended to impart deliberate grandeur to the natural terminus of much of Riverside Drive&#x27;s traffic as well as to give full advantage to the vista overlooking the Hudson River and New Jersey Palisades to the west. There is also a single masonry arch with a glazed-brick vault next to the southern approach.

==== 155th to 161st streets ====
Another viaduct carries Riverside Drive between 155th and 161st streets. This viaduct is long and carries a roadway with six lanes of traffic. The viaduct&#x27;s construction required of steel, of asphalt pavement, of masonry, and of concrete. The structure is carried upon a steel-beam framework, which is encased in granite cladding. The roadway itself is made of concrete slabs, paved over with asphalt. The arches under the roadway are infilled with granite or paneled concrete and are topped by metal-framed windows. The roadway itself has granite balustrades with ornamental lampposts. There is about of storage space under the viaduct. In the mid-20th century, the space was used to store thousands of plaster casts owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

=== Transportation ===
Riverside Drive is served by several bus routes. New York City Bus&#x27;s route covers Riverside Drive south of 135th Street, while the serves the avenue from 135th to 145th Street. The and serve Riverside Drive East and Riverside Drive West, terminating at 158th Street. The westbound runs on Riverside Boulevard from 70th to 66th streets; eastbound buses use Freedom Place. Because Riverside Drive and the neighboring Riverside Park are designated as a New York City scenic landmark from 72nd to 125th streets, the western sidewalk between these streets does not have any bus stop shelters. There is no New York City Subway service along Riverside Drive, though the run on the parallel Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line for much of the avenue&#x27;s length. The Dyckman Street station on the serves the disconnected northern section of Riverside Drive in Inwood.

==History==

===Development===
The of land in what is now Riverside Park between 72nd and 125th streets were originally inhabited by the Lenape people, but by the 18th century were used for farms by the descendants of European colonists. A small number of buildings were constructed nearby in the mid-19th century, including the New York Orphan Asylum between 73rd and 74th streets. In 1846, the Hudson River Railroad (later the West Side Line and Hudson Line) was built along the waterfront, connecting New York City to Albany. As late as the 1860s, the adjacent section of the Upper West Side was still sparsely populated, even though there was residential development on the Upper East Side.

==== Riverside Drive ====

In 1865, Central Park commissioner William R. Martin put forth the first proposal for a riverside park along the Hudson River. An act providing for such was presented to the Legislature by commissioner Andrew Haswell Green in 1866 and approved the next year. The first segment of Riverside Park was acquired through condemnation in 1872. The park also included the construction of Riverside Drive, a tree-lined drive curving around the valleys and rock outcroppings, overlooking the future park and the waterfront. The road was originally known as Riverside Avenue, although the entire avenue was renamed Riverside Drive by the 1900s. The avenue was laid out in 1868 and was wide for its entire length. The plans for Riverside Park and Avenue brought the attention of William M. Tweed, who bought several lots adjacent to the park in anticipation of its construction.

A selection process for the designers of Riverside Park followed, and in 1873 the commissioners selected Frederick Law Olmsted, a park commissioner who had also designed Central Park. Initially, Riverside Drive had been planned to run in a straight line, which would have required a retaining wall and extensive fill. By then, the difficult topography of the area had come to the attention of the Manhattan park commissioners, and in 1873 Olmsted was given the authorization to redesign the grade of Riverside Drive. To accommodate this, Olmsted devised a new plan that would create a main road extending from 72nd to 123rd streets, with overpasses at 79th and 96th streets, as well as &quot;carriage roads&quot; to serve the nearby neighborhood. The grade of the road was not to exceed 1:27. Riverside Drive&#x27;s main road would contain two roadways, one for each direction, separated by a median. A pedestrian path and a horse path would run alongside the avenue, and trees would provide shade along the route. A section of the avenue from 104th to 123rd Street would serve as a shaded promenade, and there would be a carriage turnaround at 123rd Street.

Over the following years, work proceeded on Riverside Drive, with various ramps and stairs to the park, as well as a bridle path (which was added in 1875). Olmsted was asked to create plans for the design of the avenue as an unpaved country drive, but it was eventually paved. In late 1876, bids were accepted for the paving of Riverside Drive. Olmsted was ousted as parks superintendent in December 1877. Architects and horticulturalists such as Calvert Vaux and Samuel Parsons laid out the stretch of park and road between 72nd and 125th streets according to the English gardening ideal, creating the appearance that the park was an extension of the Hudson River Valley. A parapet was built on the western side of the road, separating it from Riverside Park and the West Side Line.

==== Boulevard Lafayette ====
The northernmost section of Riverside Drive, north of 158th Street, was originally known as the Boulevard Lafayette. The southern terminus of the Boulevard Lafayette was near 155th Street; the road ran along the coast of the Hudson River, running north to the intersection of Broadway (then known as Kingsbridge Road) and Dyckman Street. Originally known simply as &quot;The Boulevard&quot;, the road was renamed the Boulevard Lafayette in 1870; work on that road began in 1873. Although a right-of-way measuring wide was provided for the Boulevard Lafayette, the roadway itself was originally only wide. At several points, due to the steep topography, a retaining wall was built adjacent to the road.

=== Completion and early years ===

Riverside Drive was opened in 1880 and was well used by pedestrians, bikers, and drivers; it had cost nearly $10 million. Riverside Drive originally terminated at 122nd Street, near where Grant&#x27;s Tomb was later built. City parks workers had to use of water every day to ensure that the avenue&#x27;s bridle path was usable. The wealthy came to settle on Riverside Drive soon after its completion. The Phillips Elite Directory of 1882–1883 did not list any members of the social elite as living on the Avenue, but the 1887 version of the same directory listed 18 families as living on the avenue. The avenue largely attracted the &quot;nouveau riche&quot;; the city&#x27;s wealthiest residents continued to live on Fifth Avenue, while old money families tended to live further downtown. Charles M. Schwab, who built his mansion between 73rd and 74th streets, was one of the few extremely wealthy residents to relocate to the avenue.

One of the first mansions to be built on Riverside Drive was a house belonging to the engineer Egbert Ludovicus Viele, who moved to the intersection with 88th Street. This was followed by additional structures along both the avenue and the side streets. Mansions, middle-class row houses, and upscale apartments were built on Riverside Drive in the late 19th and early 20th century. By the end of the 19th century, nearly every lot on the eastern side of Riverside Drive had been developed with private mansions and apartment buildings. By comparison, there had been fewer than 10 houses between 72nd and 125th streets on the shoreline before construction of the avenue began. One publication described Riverside Drive as &quot;one of the most beautiful and picturesque in the world&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the avenue&#x27;s mansions &quot;glittered like a wedding cake&quot; by the 1890s.

Tugboats along the Hudson River frequently made loud noises, prompting several Riverside Drive residents to create the Society for the Suppression of Unnecessary Noise in 1907. The effort ultimately led to federal legislation limiting noise from tugboats. In addition, until 1916, fumes from factories in North Jersey, across the Hudson River to the west, often drifted across to Riverside Drive.

=== Extensions ===
In January 1897, state lawmakers proposed extending Riverside Drive northward to the Boulevard Lafayette, with a viaduct above Manhattan Valley from 122nd to 134th Street. The original plans, which were to cost $10 million and included four viaducts, were quickly downsized to $2 million and one viaduct. Shortly afterward, a similar bill was proposed with a lower cost. The revised bill called for the avenue to be narrowed in the vicinity of Trinity Cemetery at 153rd Street. The governor of New York signed both bills in May 1897, but work on the viaduct was delayed for several months. That November, the city&#x27;s Board of Street Opening and Improvement agreed to lengthen the viaduct slightly so that it ran from 122nd to 135th Street. The extension was budgeted at $3.6 million, with the viaduct alone costing $840,000. At 153rd Street, Riverside Drive would be cantilevered over the New York Central Railroad&#x27;s (NYCRR) West Side Line railroad tracks to avoid Trinity Church Cemetery. The extension plans also involved demolishing several old mansions.

==== 96th Street overpass and Manhattan Valley Viaduct ====

The New York City Board of Estimate formally approved the Manhattan Valley Viaduct in December 1898, and plans for the viaduct were drawn up within three weeks. At the end of that month, the firm of O&#x27;Brien, Sheehan, and McBean was hired to build the viaduct for $570,000; under the terms of the contract, the viaduct had to be completed in 400 days. Work on the viaduct began in March 1898. The viaduct&#x27;s engineers requested in June 1898 that the approaches be made of granite rather than sandstone, which would add $80,000 to the cost; the city&#x27;s comptroller opposed the change. The next month, the city authorized $86,500 in bonds to finance an overpass above 96th Street and $500,000 in bonds for the Manhattan Valley Viaduct.

The city&#x27;s park commissioners began soliciting bids for the 96th Street overpass in June 1900 and awarded a contract the next month to A. C. Gildersleeve for $200,000. Work on the 96th Street overpass began later the same year. Meanwhile, the abutments for the Manhattan Valley Viaduct were finished by mid-1900. The chief engineer of the city&#x27;s highways departments reported in April 1901 that the Manhattan Valley Viaduct was completed except for filling and electrical work. Work on the 96th Street overpass was delayed for two months due to difficulties in installing sewage pipes; the overpass opened in January 1902 following complaints that the contractor was taking too long. The Manhattan Valley Viaduct was completed in mid-1902. The construction of the 96th Street overpass and Manhattan Valley Viaduct caused real-estate prices along Riverside Drive to increase in the 1900s. Arc lamps were installed on the Manhattan Valley Viaduct in 1903, soon after it opened.

==== Extension to 158th Street ====

The city&#x27;s corporation council began condemning land for the extension of Riverside Drive north of the Manhattan Valley Viaduct in mid-1899, and three commissioners were appointed to condemn the land the next year. The city acquired the land in September 1900. Most of the condemned sites had been small plots, except for a tract between 142nd and 144th streets that had belonged to the Hoguet family. The project was split into two phases, section 1 between 135th and 153rd streets, and section 2 between 153rd Street and the Boulevard Lafayette. By August 1901, plans for section 1 had been completed, with that section estimated to cost $1.7 million. The extension would consist of a roadway, a bridle path, two sidewalks, and grass planting strips. There were also to be four bridges carrying the avenue between 135th and 156th streets. Along with the Boulevard Lafayette (which already extended northwest from Broadway and 156th Street to the Inwood neighborhood), the Riverside Drive extension would form part of a parkway that would connect with Harlem River Drive. Construction did not start for over two years after the city acquired land for the Riverside Drive extension. In the meantime, dirt from the excavation of the city&#x27;s first subway line was dumped on the path of the extension.

A state judge ruled in April 1903 that construction of the Riverside Drive extension had to start as soon as possible, and a groundbreaking ceremony for the extension occurred on December 12, 1903. The section from 135th to 145th Street was awarded to Ryan &amp; Parker, while the section from 145th to 155th Street was awarded to John C. Rodgers; work on both sections began in May 1904. The section of Riverside Drive north of 150th Street was much higher than the streets that it intersected, prompting residents of these cross-streets to complain that their vehicles could not access Riverside Drive. The plans also included widening the Boulevard Lafayette within the Washington Heights neighborhood and constructing a service road to the east of the existing boulevard. Because people frequently referred to the Boulevard Lafayette by several incorrect names, residents of Washington Heights also wanted the Boulevard Lafayette to be renamed Riverside Drive.

The city planned to acquire land to widen the section of the Boulevard Lafayette (then renamed Riverside Drive) between 158th and 165th streets in 1907, but the city&#x27;s controller objected to the $1 million valuation placed on the land. By mid-1908, Riverside Drive was complete to 155th Street, except for a single city block between 151st and 152nd streets, where a property owner had successfully requested that a state judge place an injunction on the project. A few blocks north, families with plots in Trinity Church Cemetery complained that the new road was obstructing views of the Hudson River from their plots. The extension of Riverside Drive resulted in the development of upper-class apartment houses there. To pay for the construction of the extension, the Riverside Drive and Parkway Commission proposed charging local residents $1.5 million, though the high cost was controversial. The section between 145th and 158th streets formally opened in February 1911. John C. Rodgers, who helped build the section from 145th to 158th streets, later sued the city for delaying the road&#x27;s completion by four years; the suit was not resolved until 1930.

=== Early 20th century ===

==== Mid-1900s to 1910s ====

By the mid-1900s, engineers were considering extending Riverside Drive further north from 158th Street to the proposed Henry Hudson Bridge, as well as southeast from 72nd Street to West End Avenue. &quot;The New York Times&quot; estimated that the northward extension would cost $4.8 million, and the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; estimated the total cost of Riverside Drive at $25.2 million. The Board of Estimate declined to fund a further extension of Riverside Drive in 1908, saying the city lacked money. John F. Ahearn, Manhattan&#x27;s borough president, began requesting bids for the construction of Riverside Drive from 158th Street to Spuyten Duyvil, Bronx in March 1909. Amid disagreements over the extension&#x27;s cost, a state judge placed an injunction to prevent Ahearn from awarding contracts for the extension. After the city agreed to spend only $250,000 on the extension in 1909, the Board of Estimate began requesting bids that May for the construction of Riverside Drive between 158th and 181st streets. The Municipal Art Commission approved designs for the extension that July. Josiah A. Briggs, the chief engineer for the Bronx, proposed extending Riverside Drive all the way to Van Cortlandt Park in Riverdale, Bronx.

Due to high amounts of traffic over the years, the original road between 72nd and 125th streets had degraded extensively by the early 1910s. As such, in 1912, New York City park commissioner Charles B. Stover proposed replacing the pavement, and he sought $475,000 from the city government. Stover also wanted to build a highway around the northern tip of Manhattan, connecting the northern end of Riverside Drive with the Harlem River Speedway to the east. Olmsted and Arnold W. Brunner recommended in 1913 that Riverside Drive be extended north to the Bronx, with a new viaduct connecting 155th Street and the Boulevard Lafayette. Work north of 155th Street had not started. Workers began adding a permanent pavement to the avenue between 72nd and 110th streets in 1913, and upgrades to the section from 110th to 128th street began in 1915. After a pedestrian was killed near Grant&#x27;s Tomb that year, the two-way roadways on either side of the monument were both converted to one-way traffic.

Meanwhile, after the opening of the city&#x27;s first subway line, the northern section of Riverside Drive was quickly developed with six-to-twelve-story apartment blocks. Numerous multi-story apartment buildings had been developed along Riverside Drive in the Upper West Side by the early 1910s, and even more apartment buildings were built on the avenue after World War I, replacing lower-density development. By 1917, the city government had tentatively agreed to rebuild Riverside Park west of Riverside Drive. Local residents had opposed earlier proposals for the park, saying that noise and disruptions from the construction project would compel many Riverside Drive residents to relocate. In 1919, the city controller proposed extending Riverside Drive south to 57th Street by building a roadway above the West Side Line.

==== 1920s ====

The roadway between 135th and 158th streets was replaced with a permanent pavement in 1920. The New York City Board of Estimate voted down a resolution in 1921 to build a parallel roadway to Riverside Drive between 155th and 175th streets, within Hamilton Heights, at a cost of $7 million. The next year, borough president Julius Miller submitted plans to build a road, known as Riverside Drive West, between 155th and 177th streets for $2.791 million; this would serve as a bypass of the existing roadway. The project would require the construction of several high retaining walls west of Riverside Drive West. In addition, the land east of Riverside Drive West between 155th and 161st streets, a hollow known as Garage Village, was to be raised. The city&#x27;s proposal to widen Riverside Drive required the acquisition of land, including a portion of the Columbia University Irving Medical Center&#x27;s site along the Hudson River. The city also acquired land in Inwood Hill Park for a further northward extension into the Bronx, and there were suggestions to extend the road to Westchester County, New York, or the city of Troy.

The section of Riverside Drive between 165th and Dyckman streets was renovated for $1.25 million starting in 1924, and the road reopened in May 1925. Workers installed new plantings and repaved the road. The roadway was also widened by , requiring the construction of retaining walls as much as tall, and a wide sidewalk was built on the western side of the avenue, facing the river. Near 190th Street, a scenic overlook was built at Inspiration Point, where Riverside Drive curved outward toward the river. The Municipal Art Commission approved the construction of Riverside Drive West in 1926, and workers began constructing foundations for the viaduct the same year. The city began requesting bids from steel contractors in April 1927, and the P. T. Cox Construction Co. was hired to provide of structural steel for the viaduct. Later that year, a state judge determined that it would cost $3.3 million to acquire land for a northward extension of Riverside Drive. The viaduct was opened on November 28, 1928, having cost $2.36 million.

Other improvements along Riverside Drive were also undertaken in the 1920s. For instance, city controller Charles L. Craig wanted the Board of Estimate to build a parallel roadway above the West Side Line, and one local organization requested that the avenue&#x27;s sparsely-used bridle path be converted into a children&#x27;s play area. The Manhattan Valley Viaduct was closed for repairs in 1923. In addition, to increase traffic flow on Riverside Drive, the city government retimed some traffic lights in 1928, allowing motorists to pass through several green lights at once. Near the northern end of the avenue, there were proposals for ramps to and from the then-new George Washington Bridge; these ramps opened along with the bridge in 1931. Many luxury apartments continued to be developed on Riverside Drive in the 1920s and 1930s; however, upper-class residents were also starting to move away, and lower- and middle-class renters began to move in.

=== Mid-20th century ===
During the mid-20th century, many of the apartment buildings on Riverside Drive started to deteriorate and were changed to single-room occupancy structures. White residents moved out of these buildings, and black and Hispanic residents moved in. The road was also frequently used as an alternate route to the Henry Hudson Parkway after that highway was completed.

==== 1930s and West Side Improvement ====

As part of a pilot program in 1930, the city government retimed the traffic signal at the intersection of 120th Street and Riverside Drive, adding a pedestrian clearance interval; at the time, most of the city&#x27;s traffic lights had no pedestrian clearance intervals. Also in 1930, a northward extension of Riverside Drive was again proposed in conjunction with the proposed Henry Hudson Bridge. The next year, workers began replacing the Manhattan Valley Viaduct&#x27;s wood-block pavement, which was starting to deteriorate. The northern section of the West Side Elevated Highway, connecting to Riverside Drive&#x27;s southern terminus, opened in 1932; this provided a link from Riverside Drive to the Holland Tunnel, which led to New Jersey. As part of the concurrent West Side Improvement project, the West Side railroad line was relocated into the Freedom Tunnel north of 72nd Street. The Henry Hudson Parkway was also constructed as part of the West Side Improvement, and Riverside Park was greatly expanded as well.

In March 1934, the New York State Legislature approved a northward extension of Riverside Drive from Dyckman Street to the Bronx; this extension was to be developed as part of the Henry Hudson Parkway. Work on the extension began in February 1935; the project was funded by a $3.1 million bond issue. The city government also submitted plans in mid-1936 for a $7 million upgrade to the existing section of Riverside Drive between St. Clair Place (at the southern end of the Manhattan Valley Viaduct) and Dyckman Street. The portion of the parkway north of Dyckman Street opened in December 1936, and the portion south of the George Washington Bridge opened the next year, relieving traffic on much of Riverside Drive. The section of Riverside Drive between the George Washington Bridge and Dyckman Street was incorporated into the northbound roadway of Henry Hudson Parkway. A parallel southbound roadway for the Henry Hudson Parkway was built between these two points. When it opened in January 1938, the section of Riverside Drive between these two points was converted to a northbound-only road.

Other changes along Riverside Drive took place during the 1930s. The city&#x27;s police commissioner began allowing motorists to turn left on red at several intersections along Riverside Drive in 1937. In addition, concrete curbs were installed along the Manhattan Valley Viaduct in the late 1930s to reduce the probability of motorists falling off the viaduct. By this decade, the architect Henry Wright had claimed that the buildings around Riverside Drive were &quot;slums or potential slums&quot;, a claim that many local residents and architects denied. Conversely, the developer Charles V. Paterno predicted that the avenue would again become an upscale residential corridor because of its location and the construction of the Henry Hudson Parkway and George Washington Bridge. Many row houses on Riverside Drive had been replaced with apartments by the 1930s.

==== 1940s and 1950s ====
Manhattan borough president Hugo Rogers claimed in the 1940s that some of the Manhattan Valley Viaduct&#x27;s steel plates needed to be replaced. The section of Riverside Drive from 72nd to 79th streets was temporarily converted into a northbound-only road in 1951, and parking between 72nd and 96th streets was restricted, due to repairs on the Henry Hudson Parkway. In addition, to eliminate a longstanding bottleneck along Riverside Drive near the George Washington Bridge, a ramp from the bridge to the Henry Hudson Parkway opened in 1953. An alternate-side parking rule was implemented on the avenue in 1956; in conjunction with this change, 119 bus stops on Riverside Drive were relocated as well. Although alternate-side parking had already been implemented on other nearby streets, Riverside Drive was maintained by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, rather than the New York City Department of Sanitation, and had been exempt from the rule.

The city government began reconstructing the viaduct from 153rd to 155th streets in March 1959; the project involved increasing the roadway&#x27;s width from , replacing the steel frame, and constructing new sidewalks. Reconstruction was supposed to have been completed in September 1959, but the viaduct did not reopen until that December. The same year, the city government began studying plans to improve lighting along the avenue. Also starting in 1959, the Manhattan Valley Viaduct was renovated at a cost of $1.4 million; workers added new roadways, replaced one-third of the viaduct, and added aluminum netting to discourage birds from nesting there. The viaduct was rededicated in April 1961 after the renovation was completed.

==== 1960s and 1970s ====

When the George Washington Bridge&#x27;s lower level opened in 1962, the New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) considered retiming the avenue&#x27;s traffic lights to allow for smoother traffic flow. A progressive-traffic-signal system was implemented in October 1962. During the morning, the traffic lights were timed for southbound traffic, while during the evening, the traffic lights were timed for northbound traffic. The DOT also added radar antennas to traffic lights along the avenue, which collected data for a computerized traffic-signal control system. In 1964, the DOT implemented no-standing rules on Riverside Drive north of 154th Street during the mornings, and it began using a radio system to control the traffic lights between 72nd and 154th streets. The changes were meant to increase traffic capacity, but local residents opposed these changes, claiming that it would make Riverside Drive more congested. In addition, Riverside Drive was designated as part of a citywide bike route in 1968.

The city announced plans in 1967 to construct a sewage tunnel under Riverside Drive, which would divert sewage away from the Hudson River. City workers began excavating shafts for the tunnel in 1970, which required the construction of temporary footpaths, but local residents protested the project because it was too noisy. In response, the city government froze several tons of wet soil to reduce construction noise near the tunnel shafts. There were also proposals in the early 1970s to convert Riverside Drive to a one-way street during weekday rush hours, carrying southbound traffic in the morning and northbound traffic in the afternoon.

When a section of the Henry Hudson Parkway was entirely closed for repairs in January 1974, drivers were detoured onto Riverside Drive, and a no-parking restriction was enacted between 72nd and 79th streets. These restrictions, and the increases in traffic on the avenue, prompted several residents to form an organization to protest congestion on Riverside Drive. In response, the adjacent section of Henry Hudson Parkway was partly reopened as a reversible lane in September 1974, but this failed to decrease congestion on Riverside Drive. In addition, double-decker buses began running on the M5 route along Riverside Drive in 1976, requiring the relocation of several traffic lights and wires, as well as the removal of tree limbs.

=== Late 20th century ===

==== 1980s and 1990s changes ====
In February 1980, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the portion of Riverside Park and Drive south of 125th Street as a New York City scenic landmark. Another renovation project for the Manhattan Valley Viaduct was scheduled in 1981, at which point the project was to cost $27 million. By then, a DOT official had rated the viaduct as severely deteriorated, and trucks and buses were banned from the viaduct due to the poor conditions. Funding for repairs to the Manhattan Valley Viaduct and the 155th–161st streets viaduct were included in a $1.25 billion bond issue that was proposed in 1983, and New York state voters approved the bond issue that November. The same year, workers began replacing some of the viaduct&#x27;s floor beams for $250,000. The Manhattan Valley Viaduct closed for renovations in 1984, and it reopened that November following emergency repairs.

The New York State Department of Transportation closed the Manhattan Valley Viaduct again in May 1985 for emergency repairs. The deck had corroded significantly, prompting officials to spend another $9.5 million replacing girders. That December, city officials announced that they would spend $26 million rebuilding the Manhattan Valley Viaduct and partially reopening it. The project involved replacing most of the viaduct&#x27;s superstructure, in addition to replacing the existing deck with a lightweight concrete deck. The Manhattan Valley Viaduct fully reopened in July 1987, having cost $36 million in total to renovate. Further north, portions of Riverside Drive in Hamilton Heights collapsed in 1986 following a water main break, and the section of Riverside Drive in Hamilton Heights was partially closed for repairs. In addition, when a condominium building was completed at 222 Riverside Drive in 1988, it was the first apartment building to be erected on the avenue in 35 years.

In 1991, the city government proposed rebuilding the section of the avenue north of 135th Street. Local residents initially opposed the project because it would require the removal of trees in the median, so the DOT decided instead to retain all but eight of the trees. Work began in 1992. The sidewalks from 135th to 153rd streets were also rebuilt. to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA); at the time, some of the sidewalks had a slope of 6%, three times the maximum slope allowed under the ADA. As a result, 20 buildings along the street had to build stairways to their entrances, and Manhattan Community Board 9 requested that the LPC protect the northern portion of the street. In the late 1990s, local groups restored two traffic islands on Riverside Drive, and the DOT hired a contractor to restore the viaduct in Hamilton Heights. By then, the values of apartments on the southern portion of Riverside Drive had increased significantly compared with earlier in the decade.

==== Riverside South extension ====

In the 1980s, the developer Donald Trump, who owned of a Penn Central freight rail yard south of Riverside Park, proposed a large real estate development project. Following financial difficulties and opposition from local civic groups, Trump announced a modified plan in 1991. Under the agreed-upon plan, Trump would expand Riverside Park by and construct a southern extension of Riverside Drive as far south as 59th Street. Paul Willen, who had led one of the civic groups that opposed the original plan, had suggested extending Riverside Drive &quot;to make such an abandoned lump of a place feel like New York again&quot;. The extension would also relieve traffic congestion on West End Avenue one block east.

Trump&#x27;s plans for the southern extension of Riverside Drive called for the avenue to run down the middle of the development. The 1991 plan also called for office and apartment buildings on the newly extended avenue, similar in height to the existing buildings on Riverside Drive, although these buildings were later increased in size. The boulevard would run above a relocated West Side Highway, functioning as a service road to that expressway; the proposal to relocate the West Side Highway was deferred due to political opposition. The approved plans called for Riverside Drive&#x27;s extension to be built atop a viaduct, but in October 1997, several civic groups sued Trump after he reneged on the viaduct plans. By 1999, the Riverside Drive extension was known as Riverside Boulevard. Due to a lack of available space, Riverside Boulevard and Riverside Drive are not directly linked; they are instead connected by a short section of 72nd Street.

By 2003, Riverside Boulevard ran from 66th to 72nd streets. The northbound lanes of the West Side Highway from 59th to 72nd streets were still planned to be relocated into a tunnel under Riverside Boulevard. In June 2006, Riverside South&#x27;s developer began construction of the northbound tunnel. The first phase of the tunnel measured wide and long and was above sea level. The rest of the tunnel remains incomplete. The connection between Riverside Drive&#x27;s southern terminus and Riverside Boulevard remained closed until November 2011.

=== Early 21st century ===
In 2005, the retaining wall of Castle Village collapsed onto the northern section of Riverside Drive and the northbound lanes of the Henry Hudson Parkway. Part of Riverside Drive had to be closed while the wall was repaired. The wall was repaired and the roadway reopened in March 2008.

By the 2010s, the intersection of Riverside Drive and 79th Street was among the most dangerous on the Upper West Side, prompting Manhattan Community Board 7 to request that the intersection be redesigned. The DOT proposed narrowing Riverside Drive to one lane in each direction from 116th to 135th streets in early 2015, but this was changed to two northbound and one southbound lanes following opposition from local residents. As part of a related project the same year, speed limits from 103rd to 165th streets were reduced from ; the section of Riverside Drive south of 103rd Street was already restricted to 25 miles per hour. The city government awarded a $102 million construction contract in 2018 to Judlau Contracting for the restoration of the viaduct near 155th Street. In 2020, to increase safety, the DOT reduced the speed limit on Riverside Drive between 165th and 181st streets from .

== Structures ==
Between 72nd and 125th streets, nearly every block of Riverside Drive is part of a New York City historic district, and the buildings on these blocks date from before World War II. These include the West End-Collegiate Historic District between 72nd and 79th streets; the Riverside Drive-West 80th-81st Street Historic District between 80th and 81st streets; the Riverside-West End Historic District between 81st and 108th streets; the Riverside-West 105th Street Historic District between 105th and 106th streets; and the Morningside Heights Historic District between 108th and 119th streets.

The buildings on Riverside Drive are mainly residential structures south of 165th Street, and there are very few stores on Riverside Drive. In 1927, one of the avenue&#x27;s only businesses at the time was shuttered after residents of Riverside Drive spoke in favor of keeping the avenue a &quot;strictly residential zone&quot;. In addition, the road&#x27;s zoning prohibited garage entrances from being built onto Riverside Drive in the mid-20th century, and zoning regulations required all buildings on the avenue to include progressively deeper setbacks above a height of .

=== Residential buildings ===

==== Mansions and row houses ====
At the end of the 19th century, the eastern side of Riverside Drive consisted of a series of luxuriously finished rowhouses interspersed with free-standing mansions set in large lawns. Several freestanding mansions were built along Riverside Drive in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, at a time when developers envisioned Riverside Drive as a rival to the millionaires&#x27; row on Fifth Avenue. The Isaac L. Rice Mansion at 89th Street, and the Schinasi Mansion at 107th Street, are the only two remaining freestanding mansions on Riverside Drive. The Charles M. Schwab House, built in 1905 for steel magnate Charles M. Schwab on a full city block between 73rd and 74th streets, was replaced in 1950 by the 18-story Schwab House apartment building.

Riverside Drive includes several notable row houses as well, which were generally occupied by the middle class, though comparatively few townhouses remain standing. Near 72nd Street, the Prentiss residence at 1 Riverside Drive and the Kleeberg residence at 3 Riverside Drive (both New York City designated landmarks) were developed in the late 1890s as part of a group of four ornate row houses. There are several rowhouses with stepped gables at 74–78 Riverside Drive, a relative rarity on the avenue, where most row houses were designed in the Beaux-Arts style. At 83rd Street is a set of houses designed by Clarence True in 1899, which are all designated as city landmarks. The same architect designed other houses along the avenue between 72nd and 84th streets, including a set of houses on 80th and 81st streets that he designed along with Charles H. Israel. The Baumgarten House at 294 Riverside Drive, designed in 1901 by Schickel &amp; Ditmars, is also a city landmark. The block between 105th and 106th streets contains the Beaux-Arts–styled Davis Mansion at 330 Riverside Drive and the &quot;Seven Beauties&quot; at 331–337 Riverside Drive.

==== Apartment buildings ====
Many of Riverside Drive&#x27;s apartment buildings date from between the 1900s and the 1930s, with curving facades along the avenue. The southern portion of Riverside Drive is lined with many Art Deco, Beaux-Arts, and Renaissance Revival apartment buildings, mostly housing cooperatives; in particular, the section south of 96th Street is primarily occupied by luxury co-ops. The structures on the northern portion of Riverside Drive are designed in more modest styles, and there are more rental apartments. On both sections of Riverside Drive, some buildings are condominiums.

Multiple apartment houses along Riverside Drive are designated as individual city landmarks. These include the Normandy, an Art Moderne and Renaissance Revival apartment house between 86th and 87th streets, and the Master Apartments, a 27-story Art Deco tower at 310 Riverside Drive. At 150th Street is the Beaumont Apartments, an 11-story structure at 730 Riverside Drive built in 1913.

Riverside Drive has other notable apartment structures. The Clarendon at 137 Riverside Drive, just south of 86th Street, has a mansard roof with a five-story penthouse apartment. At 243 Riverside Drive near 96th Street is the Cliff Dwelling, a former apartment hotel, while the 370 Riverside Drive building was completed in 1923 by Simon Schwartz and Arthur Gross, at 109th Street. There are several major apartment houses on Riverside Drive in Morningside Heights. These include The Colosseum and The Paterno, a pair of structures at 116th Street with facades curving in opposite directions, and International House, a 13-story apartment structure erected in 1924 at 500 Riverside Drive near 123rd Street. The Castle Village apartment complex is on the former Riverside Drive (now Henry Hudson Parkway) between 182nd and 186th streets. South of 72nd Street, there are tall apartment buildings along Riverside Boulevard&#x27;s eastern sidewalk.

=== Monuments ===

There are several monuments along Riverside Drive, many of which are in Riverside Park. At 89th Street is the Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Monument, which was erected in 1902 and commemorates Union Army soldiers; it is designated as a city landmark. In the center of Riverside Drive at 122nd Street is Grant&#x27;s Tomb, the final resting place of U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant and his wife Julia. Grant&#x27;s Tomb, a domed structure made of white granite, is designated both as a national memorial and a city landmark.Numerous small monuments and memorials are clustered around Riverside Drive south of 122nd Street. Among the smaller monuments along its route are the Eleanor Roosevelt Monument at 72nd Street, Anna Hyatt Huntington&#x27;s &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; at 93rd Street, a monument to John Merven Carrère by Thomas Hastings at 99th Street, Attilio Piccirilli&#x27;s Fireman&#x27;s Memorial at 100th Street, William Ordway Partridge&#x27;s monument to Samuel J. Tilden at 112th Street, and the &quot;Amiable Child Monument&quot; at 122nd Street.

=== Other structures ===
The Nicholas Roerich Museum is on 107th Street and Riverside Drive, while a 19-story office building, the Interchurch Center, is at 475 Riverside Drive on the southeast corner with 120th Street. Across from the Interchurch Center, between 120th and 122nd streets, is Riverside Church, a Gothic Revival church building with elements inspired by the Chartres Cathedral. Just north of Riverside Church is Sakura Park, while Riverbank State Park is at 679 Riverside Drive near 145th Street. The Trinity Church Cemetery is located on the eastern side of Riverside Drive between 153rd and 155th streets, while the block to the north, between 155th and 156th streets, contains the Audubon Terrace cultural complex.

Near the northern end of Riverside Drive is Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. The original campus was built in 1925 on a cliff overlooking the avenue, while an annex was built across Riverside Drive to the west in 1999, connected to the original campus by pedestrian bridges. In addition, Fort Washington Park is located just west of the avenue&#x27;s northernmost portion.

== Impact ==
In 1900, the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; described the Manhattan Valley Viaduct as &quot;another attractive feature [on] the already impressively beautiful east bank of the Hudson River at Riverside Park and Washington Heights&quot;. A writer for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; described Riverside Drive as being, in its early years, &quot;really an elongated park&quot; lined with mansions and apartments. Paul Goldberger, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1980, said that &quot;by any reasonable standard, Riverside Drive would be considered the best street in New York&quot; because it bordered a river and park for most of its length. A reporter for the same newspaper said in 2018 that Riverside Drive &quot;links a half-dozen historic neighborhoods and a parade of attractive architecture while offering open space across nearly its entire western flank&quot;. The fifth edition of the &quot;AIA Guide to New York City&quot; described Riverside Park and Drive as a &quot;green ribbon of hills and hollows&quot;.

Riverside Drive, and the buildings along it, have been depicted in works of popular media. The 125th Street Viaduct has been seen in the movie &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; (2012), and scenes from Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Manhattan&quot; (1979) were filmed at 265 Riverside Drive. &quot;She&#x27;ll Drive the Big Car&quot; on David Bowie&#x27;s album Reality (2003) features a woman driving along Riverside Drive.

<text>BosWash is a name coined by futurist Herman Kahn in a 1967 essay describing a theoretical United States megalopolis extending from the metropolitan area of Boston to that of Washington, D.C. The publication coined terms like &quot;BosWash&quot;, referring to predicted accretions of the Northeast, and &quot;SanSan&quot; (San Francisco to San Diego) for the urbanized region in Coastal California. The general concept for the area described by &quot;BosWash&quot; was first identified (with the name &quot;Megalopolis&quot;) as &quot;The Atlantic seaboard area from north of Boston to south of Washington&quot; by French geographer Jean Gottmann in the annual report of the Twentieth Century Fund on May 25, 1958. Gottman elaborated on the stretch of cities in his 1961 book &quot;Megalopolis: The Urbanized Northeastern Seaboard of the United States&quot;, although the term &quot;BosWash&quot; did not appear in the work.

BosNYWash is a variant term that specifically references New York City, which is a central hub and has long been by far the largest metropolis in the region and the country. In 1971, &quot;The Bosnywash Megalopolis&quot; was published.

==Origin==
The publication of the ideas of Kahn and Wiener were part of a study commissioned in 1965 by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, which published the results of the commission&#x27;s findings in the summer of 1967 as &quot;Toward the Year 2000: Work in Progress&quot;, a special issue of &quot;Dædalus&quot;, journal of the academy. In their portion of the work, Kahn and Wiener, discussing urbanization, began by writing the following. 
The pair went on to give rough geographic dimensions to the areas. BosWash was described as &quot;the megalopolis that will extend from Washington to Boston&quot; along &quot;an extremely narrow strip of the North Atlantic coast.&quot; ChiPitts, mentioned as being from Chicago to Pittsburgh but extending east to Rochester, New York, was laid out as &quot;on Lake Erie and the southern and western shores of Lake Michigan and Lake Ontario&quot; and SanSan as &quot;an even more narrow strip on the West Coast&quot; from either Santa Barbara or San Francisco to San Diego in California.

==Usage==
The three terms gained use in the period immediately following publication of &quot;The Year 2000&quot;, with &quot;Newsweek&quot; using them in 1967 and &quot;Changing Times&quot; featuring them in 1968. However, the names are currently not used in any official capacity, and, of the three, only &quot;BosWash&quot; is defined in Random House Dictionary, described there as &quot;informal&quot;.

Isaac Asimov predicted in 1964 that by 2014, &quot;Boston-to-Washington, the most crowded area of its size on the earth, will have become a single city with a population of over 40,000,000&quot;.

Virginia Tech&#x27;s Metropolitan Institute outlined an area it labeled the &quot;Northeast&quot; megapolitan area, which it views as extending beyond Boston and Washington – past Portland, Maine and Richmond, Virginia – and described it as one of ten such areas in the United States. In the 2005 study, titled &quot;Beyond Megalopolis&quot;, researchers analyzed Google search results to determine plausible names for the regions, rejecting terms such as &quot;BosWash&quot;, stating: &quot;We decided that combined place names seemed contrived and offered little chance for eventual adoption. Therefore, labels such as &#x27;BosWash&#x27; to refer to the Northeast or &#x27;SanSac&#x27; in reference to the combined San Francisco and Sacramento metropolitan areas were not considered.&quot;

<text>Wynonna Ellen Judd, known simply as Wynonna ( ; born Christina Claire Ciminella; May 30, 1964), is an American country music singer. She is one of the most widely recognized and awarded female country musicians in history. She has had 19 No. 1 singles, including those with The Judds. She first rose to fame in the 1980s alongside her mother, Naomi, in their mother-daughter country music duo, The Judds. They released seven albums on Curb Records, in addition to 26 singles, of which 14 were No. 1 hits.

The Judds disbanded in 1991, and Wynonna began a solo career (also on Curb). During her solo career, Wynonna has released eight studio albums, as well as a live album, a holiday album, and two compilation albums, with the releasing of more than 20 singles. Her first three singles, &quot;She Is His Only Need&quot;, &quot;I Saw the Light&quot;, and &quot;No One Else on Earth&quot; all reached No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. In 1996, &quot;To Be Loved by You&quot; also hit number one, becoming her fourth number one and top-ten hit. Three of her albums are certified multiple-times platinum by the RIAA. Her most recent recording is &quot;Wynonna &amp; the Big Noise&quot;, which was released on February 12, 2016, followed by the release of the single &quot;Cool Ya&#x27;&quot; that same month. &quot;Recollections&quot; was released in 2020. Wynonna is most recognized for her musical work, although she has also pursued other interests starting in the 2000s, including writing, acting, and philanthropy.

In 2022, Wynonna was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame as a member of The Judds.

==Early life==
Wynonna was born Christina Claire Ciminella in Ashland, Kentucky northeast of Lexington on May 30, 1964. Her mother, Naomi Judd, (then known as Diana) quickly married Michael Ciminella after being abandoned by Charles Jordan, her boyfriend and Judd&#x27;s biological father. Jordan died in August 2000.

Naomi Judd and Michael Ciminella had a daughter together they named Ashley. The couple moved with the two girls to Los Angeles in 1968, but were divorced by 1972. By 1976, Naomi Judd took the girls with her back to Kentucky. Wynonna was inspired by the country music songs to which her mother listened, and learned to play guitar. In 1979 the family moved to Nashville, so Naomi and Wynonna could pursue musical careers. Then Wynonna&#x27;s mother legally changed her name from Diana to Naomi, and Christina adopted the stage name &quot;Wynonna&quot; after the song &quot;(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66&quot;, which mentions the town of Winona, Arizona, which is east of Flagstaff, in the lyrics.

==The Judds==

Wynonna and Naomi were signed to RCA Records in 1983 as the duo the Judds. Between 1983 and 1991, the Judds charted 23 hit singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles (now Hot Country Songs) charts, including 14 number ones. They also recorded eight studio albums, one Christmas album, and two Greatest Hits compilations. In their six-year career, the Judds sold more than 20 million records worldwide and had won over 60 industry awards, including five Grammy Nominations, nine Country Music Association awards (seven of them consecutive), and eight &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards. At the time, they were the biggest-selling duo in country music and remained so until they were eclipsed by Brooks &amp; Dunn in the 1990s. Naomi retired due to chronic hepatitis C after a 1991 farewell tour. After the duo broke up, Wynonna signed to MCA Records in association with Curb Records as a solo artist.

Wynonna reunited with her mother for a 1999 New Year&#x27;s Eve concert to ring in the year 2000 sponsored by K-Mart. They embarked on a full-fledged tour together in 2000, and four new Judds songs were released on an exclusive bonus disc with Wynonna&#x27;s album, &quot;New Day Dawning&quot;. The Judds reunited a second time in 2010 for &quot;The Last Encore&quot;, an 18-city tour. Due to excitement for the upcoming tour, Curb Records announced the release of a new album from the Judds, &quot;I Will Stand by You: The Essential Collection,&quot; which featured two new songs and twelve of the duo&#x27;s hits. The album was released on April 5, 2011.

==Solo career==

===1992–1998: Breakthrough success===

On January 27, 1992, Wynonna performed solo on television for the first time at the American Music Awards. She released &quot;She Is His Only Need&quot;, the first single from her self-titled solo debut album. The album, &quot;Wynonna&quot;, was released in 1992 via MCA/Curb, under the production of Tony Brown. &quot;She Is His Only Need&quot; went to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles charts that year, as did the album&#x27;s next two singles, &quot;I Saw the Light&quot; and &quot;My Strongest Weakness&quot;. &quot;No One Else on Earth&quot;, was also the number one country song of 1992 according to Billboard Year-End. &quot;She Is His Only Need&quot; and &quot;No One Else on Earth&quot; were also minor Adult Contemporary hits, and the latter peaked at No. 83 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;My Strongest Weakness&quot;, the album&#x27;s final single, was a No. 4 country hit. The album shipped five million copies in the United States, earning a 5× Multi-Platinum certification from the RIAA.

Her second album, &quot;Tell Me Why&quot;, was released by MCA/Curb in 1993. Also a platinum-selling album, it accounted for five consecutive Top Ten hits on the country charts: the title track, &quot;Only Love&quot;, &quot;Is It Over Yet&quot;, &quot;Rock Bottom&quot;, and &quot;Girls with Guitars&quot;, which was written by Mary Chapin Carpenter. &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; was her third crossover hit, peaking at No. 77 on the pop charts and No. 24 on the Adult Contemporary charts. Between &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; and &quot;Only Love&quot;, she sang guest vocals on Clint Black&#x27;s 1993 single &quot;A Bad Goodbye&quot; (from the album &quot;No Time to Kill&quot;), which became her biggest pop hit at No. 43. The success of this song led to a tour called the Black &amp; Wy tour, featuring Black and Wynonna as headliners.

In 1994, she also made an appearance on the Lynyrd Skynyrd tribute album &quot;Skynyrd Frynds&quot; covering the band&#x27;s song &quot;Free Bird&quot;. She also sang duet vocals on Michael English&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Healing&quot;, which peaked at No. 120 on the pop charts. English is a contemporary Christian singer. After &quot;Girls with Guitars&quot; fell from the charts, Wynonna was the subject of negative publicity, as she had a child out of wedlock. She was absent from the country charts for all of 1995. In 1996, she married Arch Kelly, the father of her daughter and son. &quot;Revelations&quot; is the title of her third album, released by MCA/Curb in 1996. Also certified platinum, this album had her fourth and final number one hit, the Mike Reid/Gary Burr co-written &quot;To Be Loved by You&quot;. Despite the song&#x27;s minor Adult Contemporary success, the album&#x27;s other three singles did not fare as well:

Wynonna&#x27;s fourth and final album for MCA is titled &quot;The Other Side&quot;. Unlike her previous country pop-oriented albums, this album focused on a more blues and rock sound. It was released in 1997 and produced four singles. The album did not sell as well as her first three, however, only earning a gold certification. Its singles were not as successful on the charts, either: although &quot;When Love Starts Talkin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Come Some Rainy Day&quot; reached No. 13 and No. 14, respectively, &quot;Always Will&quot; fell short of Top 40 and &quot;Love Like That&quot; became the first single of her career not to chart at all. After the release of a greatest hits album called &quot;Collection&quot;, Wynonna left MCA in favor of Mercury Records.

===2000–2004: Success in the new millennium===
In 1999, Wynonna decided to reunite with her mother for a tour beginning on New Year&#x27;s Eve. A month later, Wynonna released her fifth solo album, &quot;New Day Dawning&quot;. This album, the first of her career that Wynonna co-produced, included a four-song bonus disc entitled &quot;Big Bang Boogie&quot; composed of four new Judds songs.

&quot;What the World Needs Now Is Love&quot;, her sixth studio album, was released in August 2003, on Curb records. Lead-off single &quot;What the World Needs&quot; reached the Top 15 on the country charts, followed by the lesser singles &quot;Heaven Help Me&quot; and &quot;Flies on the Butter (You Can&#x27;t Go Home Again)&quot;, at No. 37 and No. 33 respectively. This latter song, originally recorded by Lari White on her album &quot;Stepping Stone&quot;, featured backing vocals from Naomi, and was credited on the charts as &quot;Wynonna with Naomi Judd&quot; instead of the Judds. Judd had success on the Hot Dance Airplay charts with a cover of Foreigner&#x27;s &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot;. Her rendition peaked at No. 12 on that chart in 2005. Included on &quot;What the World Needs Now Is Love&quot; were two songs from soundtracks: a cover of the Elvis Presley hit &quot;Burning Love&quot;, which Wynonna recorded for the animated movie &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;, and &quot;You Are&quot;, co-written by Judd, which was included in the movie &quot;Someone Like You&quot;, a film starring half-sister Ashley Judd.

===2005–2010: New career directions===

Her second release for Asylum-Curb was a live CD/DVD package called &quot;Her Story: Scenes from a Lifetime&quot;, released in 2005 which was concurrently released with her best selling autobiography, Coming Home to Myself. The album included one new studio track, &quot;Attitude&quot;. Written by Wynonna and John Rich of Big &amp; Rich, this song was issued as a single, peaking at No. 40 on the country charts. Also in 2005, she released her first solo Christmas album called &quot;A Classic Christmas&quot; which included a Latin version of Ave Maria. She also sang an overdubbed duet with Elvis Presley on the 2008 RCA album &quot;Christmas Duets&quot;.

&quot;&quot;, her first studio album in six years, was released on February 3, 2009, on Curb Records. This album is largely composed of cover songs, except for the title track, an original composition by Rodney Crowell. It also reunites her with producers Brent Maher and Don Potter, who produced all of the Judds&#x27; 1980s albums. This album&#x27;s lead-off single is &quot;I Hear You Knocking&quot;, a blues standard first recorded by Smiley Lewis. On May 9, 2009, a seven-song EP containing dance remixes of the title track was released.

On September 14, 2010, the Judds appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; where Wynonna discussed &quot;her recent weight loss, her year of living dangerously and what it&#x27;s like going back on stage as part of the iconic duo, the Judds&quot;. The Judds also performed their new single &quot;I Will Stand By You&quot;, released October 4, 2010. &quot;I Will Stand By You&quot; was released as the title track to the Judd&#x27;s 2011 Greatest Hits collection, I Will Stand by You: The Essential Collection.

=== 2011–2022: Start of the Big Noise, end of The Judds ===
In 2011, Judd released her first novel, &quot;Restless Heart&quot;. A new single, &quot;Love It Out Loud&quot; was released in May 2011. On November 27, 2011, Wynonna debuted her new band &quot;Wynonna &amp; the Big Noise&quot; in Nashville at 3rd and Lindsley. In March 2013 Wynonna released &quot;Something You Can&#x27;t Live Without&quot;, the first single off her forthcoming full-length album, produced by her husband/drummer Cactus Moser and set for release 2013 on Curb Records. This album—her first with all new material in over four years—was recorded in her own home studio and is deeply personal, especially noting the life-changing events the couple experienced in 2012.Judd released a new studio album, &quot;Wynonna &amp; the Big Noise&quot;, on February 12, 2016. The album produced two singles &#x27;Jesus And A Jukebox&#x27; and Things I Lean On&#x27;. In October 2020, Wynonna released a new extended play titled ‘Recollections’ via Anti Records

On April 30, 2022, Naomi Judd died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. She had suffered for years from depression and mental illness. It was nineteen days after the final performance of The Judds at the 2022 CMT Music Awards and a day before The Judds were inducted as a duo into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

When The Judds were inducted into the Hall of Fame the following day, Wynonna and her sister Ashley paid tribute to their mother on stage. A memorial service for Naomi Judd was televised on May 15. Wynonna announced that she would honor the original tour dates she and her mother had planned for summer 2022 as a tribute to her, supported by several female country artists. The tour was chronicled in the documentary &quot;Wynonna Judd: Between Hell and Hallelujah&quot;, which was released on April 26, 2023.
On November 2, 2022, CMT produced a concert special; CMT Presents The Judds:Love Is Alive-The Final Concert in Murfreesboro, Tennessee where Judd and all the guest stars who appeared along last fall&#x27;s tour routing converged for a show that was meant to more or less recreate the Judds’ famous original farewell concert back in 1991, shot on the same stage. The emotional concert featured special performances by Ashley McBryde, Brandi Carlile, Kelsea Ballerini, Martina McBride, and Little Big Town.

==Personal life==
Wynonna and businessman Arch Kelley III had a son before marrying in 1996. They had a daughter and divorced in 1998.

Wynonna married D. R. Roach, her former bodyguard, on November 22, 2003. Three years later Roach was arrested for sexual assault of a child under the age of 13. Judd filed for divorce five days later, on March 27, 2007. In November 2003, Wynonna taped an appearance on an episode of &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; discussing what she described as a severe dependence on food. The episode aired in February 2004. Judd had been working with the show in an effort to lose weight and get to the root of her dependence. In September 2005, she was on &quot;Oprah&quot; a second time discussing her weight loss. 

Naomi only told Wynonna that her father was Charles Jordan when Wynonna was 30. Wynonna found Jordan but he died before they could meet. Wynonna was a judge for the 6th annual Independent Music Awards, conducted to support independent artists&#x27; careers. Wynonna and her boyfriend Scott &quot;Cactus&quot; Moser, best known as the drummer for Highway 101, a country band, were engaged on December 24, 2011. They married on June 10, 2012 at her home in Leiper&#x27;s Fork, Tennessee west of Franklin.

On August 18, 2012, Moser was severely injured in a motorcycle crash in South Dakota. He was on U.S. Route 16 in the Black Hills when he crossed the center line and hit a car. Injuries required his left leg to be amputated above the knee. In June 2018, Wynonna&#x27;s daughter Grace was sentenced to eight years in prison for violating probation. She had pleaded guilty to possession, manufacturing and distribution of methamphetamines. In November 2024, Grace was arrested for allegedly stealing a church van and is held at the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail in Charlottesville, Virginia.

<text>Phạm Tuân ( born 14 February 1947) is a retired Vietnamese Air Force fighter pilot and cosmonaut. He became the first Vietnamese cosmonaut, and the first person of Asian origin to be in space when he launched aboard the Soyuz 37 mission as an Interkosmos research cosmonaut. He was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union.

==Early life and military career==
Phạm Tuân was born in 14 February 1947 in Kiến Xương, Thái Bình province in northern Vietnam.

Initially a Infantry soldier he was recruited into the Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force (VPAF) in 1965 as a radar mechanic student. Tuân was then selected for pilot training as a commissioned officer, graduating at the Krasnodar Flight School in the Soviet Union as a MiG-17 pilot in 1967, then moved-up for training in the MiG-21, and becoming assigned to the VPAF 910th Air Training Regiment from 1968 to 1969 while participating in developing night-time interception techniques against U.S. air raids, and then attached with the 923rd Fighter Regiment from 1969 to 1970, finally with the 921st Fighter Regiment from 1970 to 1973.

On the nights of 18–27 December 1972, during Operation Linebacker II (also referred to as the &quot;Christmas Bombings&quot;), then-Major Phạm engaged USAF Strategic Air Command (SAC) B-52 Stratofortress heavy bombers at least a dozen times. On the 27th, Phạm was able to get close to a B-52 formation at supersonic-speed in his MiG-21MF (#5121), and fire a pair of missiles in the sub-4 km range, visually identifying and reporting that his missile(s) struck the B-52D, causing it to go down in flames over the border of Hòa Bình–Vĩnh Phúc province. This claim, which would be the alleged ‘only’ B-52 downed in air-to-air combat during the war is unclear according to U.S. record, which claims that this B-52 was downed by a surface-to-air missile. In a book named &quot;Hà Nội - Điện Biên Phủ trên không&quot; (Hanoi - the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in the air) by Nguyễn Minh Tâm, published by Nhà xuất bản Quân đội Nhân dân Việt Nam (Viet Nam People&#x27;s Army Publishing House), the author affirms that Phạm Tuân shot down the B-52 with two K-13 air-to-air missiles within a range of 4 kilometers.

Tuân said that because the B-52 was equipped with a large number of infrared decoys, he had to get close to the target (within 2-3 kilometers) in order to ensure the bomber&#x27;s destruction, though the minimum safe range for launching missiles is at least 8 kilometers. Numerous air-to-air combat victory claims by the MiG pilots of the VPAF against U.S. combat aircraft have been counter-claimed as losses to surface-to-air missiles or anti-aircraft artillery, as it&#x27;s considered &quot;less embarrassing&quot; than losing to an enemy pilot.

In 1973, Tuân was granted the title of Hero of the People&#x27;s Armed Forces in Vietnam. In 1980, Tuân was awarded the &quot;Vietnam Labor Hero&quot; distinction. In 1989, Tuân was given the position of &quot;Deputy Commander for Political Affairs&quot; within the Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force. He was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General in 1999. During the year 2000, Tuan was the position of &quot;Director of the General Department of Defense Industry&quot;. He eventually retired from government positions at the end of 2007.

Tuân received numerous distinctions for his service, including the Order of Ho Chi Minh. He also was awarded the Order of Lenin and the rare honor of being one of the few foreigners to receive the title Hero of the Soviet Union.

==Interkosmos program==

Tuân reached the rank of lieutenant colonel in the VPAF before eventually training to be a research cosmonaut in the joint USSR-Vietnamese space program. Tuân was initially sent to the USSR to train as a radar engineer. There was a shortage of eligible Vietnamese pilots due to most of the applicants not passing the fitness tests, so Tuân was pressured into flight training. Due to this, Tuân was one of three Vietnamese pilots and engineers to be selected by the Soviet Union. On 1 April 1979, he was selected as a member of the sixth international crew for the Interkosmos program. His backup was Bùi Thanh Liêm. Tuân, along with Soviet cosmonaut Viktor Gorbatko, was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome on 23 July 1980, on board the Soyuz 37 mission to the Salyut 6 space station. Tuân was informed only three days prior that he would be the main pilot of the Soyuz 37.

Before the flight a joint Bulgarian – Soviet mission had been cancelled. Tuân was worried that his voyage would share the same fate. During his flight aboard the Soyuz 37, there were technical issues regarding the Soyuz 3&#x27;s engine system. Tuân was commanded to shut down all systems and inform Command of the situation. After this, Command restored the engine to normal and the mission continued.

During his time in orbit, Tuân performed experiments on the melting of mineral samples in microgravity. He also carried out plant experiments on azolla and photographed Vietnam from orbit for mapping purposes. Tuân was in space for 7 days, 20 hours, and 42 minutes, completing 142 orbits, and returned to Earth on 31 July 1980.

==Personal life==
Tuân brought several things with him on the Soyuz 37 flight. These included pictures of former President Hồ Chí Minh and General Secretary Lê Duẩn, as well as Hồ Chí Minh&#x27;s will and Vietnamese flags. He wanted to stamp all of these at the space station and bring it back to Earth.

Tuân has stated that his personal relationship with his Russian friends has continued to this day. Every year, he travels long distances to meet up with his fellow Russian cosmonauts.

Tuân is married and has two children. He is now a retired Lieutenant General, director of the General Department of Defense Industry of the Ministry of Defence, and is a non-elected member of the National Assembly of Vietnam.

<text>A garrison sergeant major (GSM) in the British Army is the senior warrant officer of a garrison and holds the rank of warrant officer class 1. The GSM London District, always a guardsman, holds one of the four most senior WO1 appointments in the British Army, and has military ceremonial responsibility for important state occasions such as Trooping the Colour.

==London District==
The post of GSM London District was established in the early 1940s with specific responsibilities as State Ceremonial Sergeant Major. The first tasks of the new GSM were to organise the military ceremonial at the funeral of King George VI in 1952 and the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. The GSM also organised the military ceremonial at the state funeral of the Queen on 19 September 2022.


The GSM London District traditionally wore the same badge of rank as a regimental sergeant major of Foot Guards, the large Royal Coat of Arms on the right upper sleeve. However, on 28 April 2011, the day before the wedding of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Ministry of Defence announced that, in recognition of the work done by garrison sergeant majors on behalf of the Royal Household, Queen Elizabeth II approved the revival of the original insignia worn by sergeant majors appointed to the court of King William IV in the early 19th century. It incorporates the large Royal Coat of Arms worn by selected warrant officers class 1 of the Household Division, placed over four chevrons sewn in gold thread, the traditional badge of the sergeant major, originally worn on both arms of their tunics.

<text>In Belgium, there are ten official public holidays. Other particular days are also celebrated, but these are not official public holidays and employers are not obliged to give their employees a day off. However, some employers do award a day&#x27;s holiday in accordance with union.

==Public holidays==
In addition to the above, the same legal text names all Sundays as public holidays (which is why Easter and Pentecost, which always fall on Sundays, are &quot;feasted&quot; by extending the Sunday holiday to the following Monday).

==Particular days celebrated in Belgium that are not official public holidays==

The days of the three communities are holidays for their civil servants and for employees of institutions controlled, supervised or financed by them (e.g. municipalities, universities) and may also be observed by banks in the community concerned. King&#x27;s Feast is a holiday observed by all (i.e. federal, community or regional, provincial and local) administrations, including some of the schools they organize.

<text>Lapua (; ) is a town and municipality of Finland.

It is located next to the Lapua River in the region of South Ostrobothnia. The town has a population of 
() and covers an area of of
which is water. The population density is . The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

==History==
In the early 14th century, permanent settlement began to spread to the Lapuanjoki Valley. Residents came from, among other areas, the settlement center of Suur-Sastamala in Upper Satakunta, which had good land and water connections to the north. The focus of Ostrobothnia&#x27;s settlement was initially on the lower reaches of the Kyrönjoki River. The proximity to the sea of the Kvarken area, which is rich in natural resources, was especially attractive. Lapua at that time had some Sámi people who considered the region their wilderness area. The name Lapuan was probably given by the coastal Swedes precisely because of the Sámi, then called Lapps, who lived in the area.

The Battle of Lapua was fought between Swedish and Russian forces near the outskirts of the town on 14 July 1808 as part of the Finnish War.

Lapua is the seat of the Evangelical Lutheran Diocese of Lapua. The Lapua Cathedral, designed by Carl Ludvig Engel, was built in 1827. 

=== Lapua Movement ===

In 1929 the anti-communist &quot;Lapua Movement&quot; was founded and named after the town. The Lapua Movement was a powerful force in Lapua. They organized large rallies and marches in the town center, drawing huge crowds of supporters. Some of the movement&#x27;s leaders, like Vihtori Kosola and Vilho Annala, were based in Lapua. On 30 October 1930, the Lapua March was hosted, where thousands of their paramilitary members marched through Lapua to protest against leftist threats and government policies they opposed. The Lapua movement was criminalized in 1932, and would be succeeded by the Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement.

== Lapua State Cartridge Factory ==
Lapua is also home to a large ammunition factory, which commenced operations in 1927 as the &quot;State Cartridge Factory&quot;. This factory was the primary supplier of ammunition to the Finnish Army during the Winter War and World War II. An explosion occurred in a warehouse of this factory on 13 April 1976, resulting in the deaths of 40 employees. After the explosion, the factory was relocated away from the town centre and continues production today as Nammo Lapua, part of the Nordic Ammunition Group (Nammo). The original site of the factory and the surviving buildings are now an arts centre, a library and a theater.

== History ==
The name of Laukaa likely comes from the now obsolete word &quot;lauas&quot; (genitive: &quot;laukaan&quot;), stream pool, in this case referring to the Koivulahti bay in the lake Saraavesi. The name is also related to that of the river Luga in Russia (), albeit only through the word from which the names are derived.

The area of Laukaa was an important route to both the lake Keitele in the northwest and Rautalampi in the northeast. Laukaa itself was a part of the Rautalampi parish, gaining its first subordinate church in 1593. This church was located near modern Tarvaala (aka Laukkavirta), which was therefore the original center of Laukaa. The center shifted to the modern location in Pellosniemi sometime in the 17th century. 

Laukaa became a separate parish in 1628. It included Saarijärvi until 1639, Jyväskylä until 1837, Jyväskylän mlk (to which Toivakka was moved in 1871) and Sumiainen until 1868 and Äänekosken mlk until 1907 (administratively 1911).

==Saraakallio Stone Age rock paintings==
Saraakallio, the largest Stone Age rock painting site of Fennoscandia is located in Laukaa. The paintings consists of over 100 figures. The oldest paintings are about 6 600 years old. The most common themes in Saraakallio paintings are deer, human, and boat figures. Saraakallio rock paintings are made by using red paint, which is made of hematite-containing soil mixed presumably with blood, urea and eggs.

==Keitele Canal==

Three of the five locks on the Keitele Canal (Kuusa, Kuhankoski and Kapeenkoski) are located in Laukaa. The canal route combines Lake Päijänne and Lake Keitele. The canal route was finished in 1994. Its original purpose was serving log floating. Nowadays the route is used by inland ships and boaters.

The construction of the canal was executed by the Russian Zarubezhtransstroi Company on a &quot;turn key&quot; basis in 1990-1994. The total length of the Keitele-Paijanne route is , of which is canal section. Rest of the route follows river&#x27;s natural water flow.

Kuusankoski, Kuhankoski, and Kapeenkoski are also famous recreational fishing places. The local theatre, Kuusan Kanavateatteri, Kuusa Canal Theatre, is active all year round giving performances in the restored building dating from the year 1914. In summer the Kuusa Canal forms a unique backdrop setting for the outdoor stage. The seating area is designed for 650 people and is covered with a canopy.

<text>The Paris Opera Ballet () is a French ballet company that is an integral part of the Paris Opera. It is the oldest national ballet company, and many European and international ballet companies can trace their origins to it. It is still regarded as one of the four most prominent ballet companies in the world, together with the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow, the Mariinsky Ballet in Saint Petersburg and the Royal Ballet in London.

Since December 2022, the company has been under the direction of José Martínez, the director of dance. The ballet company consists of 154 dancers, among them 17 &quot;Danseurs Étoiles&quot;. The principal dancers give 180 dance performances each year, primarily at the Palais Garnier.

Just as prestigious as the Paris Opera Ballet is its dance school, the Paris Opera Ballet School (French: École de danse de l&#x27;Opéra national de Paris), considered to be one of the world&#x27;s best dance schools. Its former pupils have won a record of 20 Benois de la Danse awards. The school celebrated its tercentennial in 2013.

The competition for admission to both institutions is extremely fierce. For a dancer to enter the Paris Opera Ballet, it is almost compulsory to be admitted to the Paris Opera Ballet School, to pass the annual competitive examinations in May, and to attend at least the final two classes. 95 percent of the admitted dancers in the Paris Opera Ballet are French.

==History==
===Naming===
The Paris Opera Ballet has always been an integral part of the Paris Opera, which was founded in 1669 as the Académie d&#x27;Opéra (Academy of Opera), although theatrical dance did not become an important component of the Paris Opera until 1673, after it was renamed the Académie Royale de Musique (Royal Academy of Music) and placed under the leadership of Jean-Baptiste Lully. The Paris Opera has had many different official names during its long history, but since 1994, it has been called the Opéra National de Paris (Paris National Opera).

===Background===

The Paris Opera Ballet had its origins in the earlier dance institutions, traditions and practices of the court of Louis XIV. Of particular importance were the series of &quot;comédies-ballets&quot; created by Molière with, among others, the choreographers and composers Pierre Beauchamps and Jean-Baptiste Lully. The first was &quot;Les Fâcheux&quot; in 1661 and the most important, &quot;Le Bourgeois gentilhomme&quot; in 1670. Many of these were also performed by Molière&#x27;s company at the public Théâtre du Palais-Royal in Paris, which was later to become the first permanent home of the opera company and the opera ballet.

Also in 1661, Louis XIV had founded the Académie Royale de Danse (Royal Academy of Dance) in an effort &quot;to improve the quality of dance instruction for court entertainments&quot;. Members of the academy, as well as the dance teachers who were certified by it, and their students, participated in creating the ballets for the court, Molière, and later the opera. In 1680, Beauchamps became the chancellor (director) of the Académie Royale de Danse. Although the Académie Royale de Danse and the Opera were closely connected, the two institutions remained separate, and the former disappeared with the fall of the monarchy in 1792.

===Founding and early history===
On 28 June 1669, Louis XIV granted a privilege to the poet Pierre Perrin giving him a monopoly to form a separate academy for the performance of opera in French. The first production of the company founded by Perrin, the Académie d&#x27;Opéra (Academy of Opera), was &quot;Pomone&quot;, which was first performed on 3 March 1671 at the Jeu de Paume de la Bouteille and included ballets choreographed by Anthoine des Brosses.

In 1672, Lully purchased Perrin&#x27;s privilege and also obtained new letters patent limiting the use of musicians and dancers by other French companies. With Anthoine des Brosses and Lully as choreographers and Carlo Vigarani as stage designer, Lully&#x27;s company, now called the Académie Royale de Musique, produced Lully&#x27;s first opera, &quot;Les fêtes de l&#x27;Amour et de Bacchus&quot; (a &quot;pastorale&quot;) in November 1672 at the Jeu de Paume de Béquet. This work consisted primarily of excerpts from Lully&#x27;s prior court ballets connected with new &quot;entrées&quot; choreographed by des Brosses. A crucial difference, however, from the previous court ballets was that the members of the court no longer participated, and all of the dancers were professionals.

Lully&#x27;s next production, &quot;Cadmus et Hermione&quot; (27 April 1673), the first &quot;tragédie lyrique&quot; (with a libretto by Philippe Quinault), also premiered at the Jeu de Paume de Béquet and was choreographed by Anthoine des Brosses. Pierre Beauchamps, who had been working with Molière at the Palais-Royal, joined Lully&#x27;s company in June 1673 (not long after Molière&#x27;s death), when Lully took over the Palais-Royal theatre, forcing Molière&#x27;s troupe to move to the Théâtre Guénégaud. Lully and Quinault continued to collaborate on a series of successful productions, in the process creating a new genre of French opera in which dance interludes played an important part in the musical drama. The ballets for these works were created by Beauchamps, des Brosses, and d&#x27;Olivet. Jean-Baptiste Dubos explains that Beauchamps and des Brosses were responsible for the &quot;ballets ordinaires&quot;, while d&#x27;Olivet specialized in &quot;ballet-pantomime&quot;:
Lully paid such great attention to the ballets mentioned here that he engaged for their choreography a &#x27;maître de danse particulier&#x27; named d&#x27;Olivet. It was he, and not des Brosses or Beauchamps, whom Lully engaged for the &#x27;ballets ordinaires&#x27;, who composed the ballets of the infernal scenes of &quot;Psyché&quot; and &quot;Alceste&quot;. It was also d&#x27;Olivet who composed the ballet of the old men in &quot;Thésée&quot;, of the baneful dreams in &quot;Atys&quot;, and of the tremblers in &quot;Isis&quot;. This last was composed solely of pantomimic gestures by men seized with cold, and he did not introduce a single usual dance step into it.
Initially the dancers of the Paris Opera Ballet were all male. Mademoiselle de la Fontaine (1665–1738) became the first professional ballerina when she danced in the premiere of Lully&#x27;s ballet &quot;Le Triomphe de l&#x27;Amour&quot; on 21 January 1681. Pierre Beauchamps continued to collaborate with Lully at the Paris Opera until Lully&#x27;s death in 1687.

===Subsequent history===

The 18th century saw the creation of an associated school, now referred to as the Paris Opera Ballet School (French: École de Danse de l’Opéra de Paris), which opened in 1713. The operas of Rameau, and later Gluck, raised standards for the dancers. Jean-Georges Noverre was a particularly influential ballet master from 1776 to 1781. He created the ballet &quot;Les petits riens&quot; in 1778 on Mozart&#x27;s music. Maximilien Gardel was ballet master from 1781, with his brother Pierre Gardel taking over after Maximilien&#x27;s death in 1787. Pierre Gardel survived the Revolution creating ballets such as &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; and &quot;Offrande à la Liberté&quot;. He remained the ballet master until 1820 and continued to work up to 1829.

In 1820, Pierre Gardel was succeeded as ballet master by Jean-Louis Aumer, who was however highly criticized for using too much mime and failing to use choreography which furthered plot or character. In 1821, the company moved to a new house, the Salle Le Peletier, where Romantic ballet was born. In 1875, the company moved to the Palais Garnier, where it continues to perform.

===Serge Lifar as ballet director===
In 1929, Jacques Rouché invited 24-year-old dancer Serge Lifar to become the maitre de ballet of the Paris Opéra Ballet, which had fallen into decline in the late 19th century.

As ballet master from 1930 to 1944, and from 1947 to 1958, he devoted himself to the restoration of the technical level of the Opéra Ballet, returning it to its place as one of the best companies in the world.

Lifar gave the company a new strength and purpose, initiating the rebirth of ballet in France, and began to create the first of many ballets for that company. During his three decades as director of the Paris Opéra Ballet, Lifar led the company through the turbulent times of World War II and the German occupation of France. Lifar brought the Paris Opéra Ballet to America and performed to full houses at the New York City Center. Audiences were enthusiastic and had great admiration for the company of dancers.

===Era of Rudolf Nureyev===
In the world of ballet, Rudolf Nureyev is regarded as the greatest classical dancer ever and as one of the most preeminent choreographers. In 1983, Rudolf Nureyev was appointed director of the Paris Opera Ballet, where, as well as directing, he continued to dance and to promote younger dancers.

The top female ballet dancer at that time, if not of all times, was Sylvie Guillem, who was nominated principal dancer at the age of 19 by Rudolf Nureyev in 1984. They were an exceptional dance couple. The years of Nureyev marked a golden era of the Paris Opera Ballet.

===Brigitte Lefèvre===
Brigitte Lefèvre, director from 1995 to 2014, with Patrice Bart as maitre de ballet from 1990 to 2011, succeeded to maintain the high standard that Nureyev has set.

Brigitte Lefèvre invited some of the most preeminent choreographers, such as William Forsythe, Angelin Preljocaj, Saburo Teshigawara, and John Neumeier.

===Transition===
There were turbulent times for the company with Benjamin Millepied, director of the Paris Opera Ballet from November 2014 until he quit on 15 July 2016. There were two stumbling blocks with Millepied, a French dancer and choreographer, who left France in 1993, at the age of 16, got his main professional education as a dancer and choreographer in the United States and came back to France in 2014 as newly appointed director of the Paris Opera Ballet. The first one was that Millepied wanted the Paris Opera Ballet dancers to interpret &quot;La Bayadère&quot;, a classic ballet choreographed by Rudolf Nureyev in 1992, like a contemporary ballet. To achieve this goal, he had already hired guest principal dancers to present &quot;La Bayadère&quot;.

The other stumbling block was that Millepied had broken the hierarchy of the &quot;Danseurs Étoiles&quot; dancing the leading roles, as he had chosen for the cast of his first contemporary ballet creation &quot;Clear, Loud, Bright, Forward&quot; (the first one in his time as director) out of the 154 danseurs a &quot;dream team&quot; of 16 dancers which he considered to be the fittest to put to practice his ideas and visions (on the programming, the dream team was named &quot;United visual artists&quot;). Karl Paquette, principal dancer, said in an interview that he had never felt as bad in his 30 years at the Paris Opera Ballet as he had the past 6 months. Stéphane Bullion, principal dancer, added that it was clear that things could not be straightened out.

Stéphane Lissner, the Paris Opera director who hired Benjamin Millepied in January 2013 — and who has final authority on decisions about budget, hiring and promotion — said at a news conference at the Palais Garnier on Thursday 4 February 2016 that he had no regrets about that choice. “He leaves too soon, but others leave too late.” Lissner added, “I think that the two jobs, director of dance and a choreographer who is more and more in demand, not just at the Opera, raised a certain number of questions.”

===Aurélie Dupont===
Aurélie Dupont took over the direction of the ballet company on 1 August 2016. She was Danseuse Étoile from 1994 to 2015.

Dupont was the inspiration behind the Cédric Klapisch film about the star, considered the &quot;grande dame&quot; of the Paris Opera Ballet.

Dupond is stepped down from the position on 31 July 2022, as announced in June of that year.

===José Martínez===
José Martínez took over the company in December 2022.

==Hierarchy==
The hierarchy of the Paris Opera Ballet is very strict. For a dancer, it is virtually compulsory to enter first the Paris Opera Ballet School. As Mathilde Froustey put it: &quot;You cannot get into the company if you have not done the school&quot;. The competition for admission to both institutions is extremely fierce, as well as the competition for the highest ranks in the ballet company.

More than 90 percent of the candidates don&#x27;t pass the Ballet School entrance examination, and 20 percent of its pupils have to leave at the end of the year after failing the annual competitive examinations (&quot;les concours annuels&quot;) in May. Only 5 to 20 percent of the Ballet School graduates are accepted in the Paris Opera Ballet, initially as dancers on trial (the &quot;stagiaires&quot;).

To become a regular member of the Paris Opera Ballet as &quot;Quadrille&quot; (fifth and lowest rank in the hierarchy), you have to pass the annual competitive examination in November. Promotion to the next rank depends exclusively on success in the following annual competitive examinations (&quot;les concours internes de promotion&quot;) in front of a board of judges. To achieve the highest rank as Danseur Étoile (only by nomination) you have to perform in leading roles as &quot;Premier Danseur&quot; for many years before you are nominated due to outstanding excellence and merit.

==Small scandals and the lost generation==
As the Paris Opera Ballet has a large quantity of first-class French dancers, there are hard times for those who have not been promoted to the highest ranks as dancers or have not been appointed afterwards to positions for which they would have been extremely qualified.

Mathilde Froustey, Sujet from 2005 till 2013, left the Paris Opera Ballet in July 2013 and joined the San Francisco Ballet as a principal dancer because there was no chance for her becoming eventually Danseuse étoile (principal dancer) in this company. In November 2014 Benjamin Millepied, a former principal dancer of the New York City Ballet and French, took over the direction of the company and promised a change: &quot;They asked for a change and they will get a change.&quot; When Benjamin Millepied nominated for the first (and only) time a &quot;Danseuse étoile&quot;, Laura Hecquet was chosen. Laura Hecquet and Mathilde Froustey were described in the press as &quot;the lost generation&quot; of dancers working up the ranks who have become soloist (Sujet) but have been unlucky for years as far as climbing up the last step of the career ladder is concerned.

The Paris Opera Ballet School has churned out some of the most famous dancers of all time, such as Sylvie Guillem and Laurent Hilaire.

Yet Sylvie Guillem, being principal dancer since 1984, left the company in 1989 at the age of 24 because she wanted more freedom, the right to perform with other companies, an arrangement the management of the Paris Opera Ballet declined.

Laurent Hilaire was highly appreciated as principal dancer. After his farewell as a dancer he continued his career in the company attaining in 2011 the second-highest position as &quot;Maitre de ballet associated to the direction&quot;. Laurent Hilaire was the favourite of Brigitte Lefèvre, director of the ballet, and Nicolas Joel, director of the Paris Opera at the time. In January 2013 Stéphane Lissner the new director of the Paris Opera (in the hierarchy above the Paris Opera Ballet&#x27;s director) appointed Benjamin Millepied. Hilaire announced in May 2014 his departure and quit the company in July. The Paris Opera Ballet&#x27;s new director Benjamin Millepied on his part stayed only two seasons and was followed in August by Aurélie Dupont, who was as Danseuse étoile the Grand-dame of the Paris Opera Ballet.

==Paris Opera Ballet School==
The Paris Opera Ballet School (French: École de danse de l&#x27;Opéra national de Paris) is one of the most preeminent dance schools in the world. It has six classes for boys and girls separately named &quot;sixième division&quot; to &quot;première division&quot;.

In 1987, the Paris Opera Ballet School moved from the Palais Garnier (where most of the Paris Opera ballets take place) to a new building located 10 kilometres west of the centre of Paris, in Nanterre. The new dance school building was designed by Christian de Portzamparc. Since 1995, the Paris Opera Ballet School has been a boarding school. Nowadays, from 8 a.m. until noon, all pupils attend school classes leading to the obtention of the French &quot;baccalauréat&quot; (the &quot;bac&quot;), the general qualification for university entrance in France.

Among the dancers of the Paris Opera Ballet, 95 percent have attended the Paris Opera Ballet School. To describe it differently, for a young dancer to be accepted in the Paris Opera &quot;corps de ballet&quot;, it is virtually obligatory to enter the Paris Opera Ballet School and attend at least the final two classes (&quot;deuxième et première division&quot;). More than 90 percent of the candidates do not pass the entrance examination. Even some of the dancers who have later become &quot;premiers danseurs&quot; (first soloists) or &quot;danseurs étoiles&quot; (principal dancers) of the Paris Opera Ballet passed the entrance examination only on the second attempt, or were accepted only as fee-paying pupils.

==Choreographers==
Choreographers associated with the Paris Opera Ballet and works created for the Paris Opera Ballet are:

==Dancers==
There are five ranks of dancers in the Paris Opera Ballet; from highest to lowest they are: &quot;Danseur Étoile&quot;, &quot;premier danseur&quot;, &quot;sujet&quot;, &quot;coryphée&quot;, and &quot;quadrille&quot;. Promotions to the higher rank depend on success in the annual competitive examinations, except for &quot;danseurs étoiles&quot; who are nominated by the Director of the Opera, on a proposal from the Director of the Ballet.

===Étoiles===

The maximum number of active &quot;danseurs étoiles&quot; within the company, originally limited to four, has progressively increased over time and is nowadays set at sixteen. The title is conferred for life and is therefore kept after retirement, which is set at a maximum age of 42, as for all other dancers of the Paris Opera Ballet.

Lemi has been founded in 1688 as an independent Evangelical Lutheran parish. Due to the secularization of the local governments according to the decree of 1865, the secular local government was separated from the clerical in 1867 as the municipality of Lemi.

===War time===

Some fighting took place in the cemetery of Lemi during the civil war in 1918. After the winter war as the military hardware had to be displaced from the territories to be given to the Soviet Union on the basis of the Moscow Armistice, naval artillery was brought to Lemi to create part of the Salpa Line. From the Käkisalmi region the Vahtiniemi battery was transferred to Kärmeniemi consisting of two Canet 152/45-C naval guns. Later, on 11 July 1941, they were taken to Antamoinen to be tested on 22 July. Four days later they were transported by train from Lappeenranta again near Käkisalmi to Vahtiniemi to become operational 9 September 1941. After the Continuation War the 32nd heavy battery brought only one of the two Canet 152/45-C&#x27;s it had as the other was to repaired. By the end of November 1944 the 32nd heavy battery was dissolved and the guns were sent to Parola.
After the war there has not been naval guns in Lemi, but the remaining positions can be seen both in Kärmeniemi and Juvola.

<doc id="782554" wikidata="Q286049" url="?curid=782554" title="Aminolevulinic acid synthase">
<text>Aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALA synthase, ALAS, or delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase) is an enzyme () that catalyzes the synthesis of δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) the first common precursor in the biosynthesis of all tetrapyrroles such as hemes, cobalamins and chlorophylls. 
The reaction is as follows:
:succinyl-CoA + glycine formula_1 δ-aminolevulinic acid + CoA + CO2

This enzyme is expressed in all non-plant eukaryotes and the α-class of proteobacteria and the reaction it catalyses is sometimes referred to as the Shemin pathway for ALA formation. Other organisms produce ALA through a three enzyme pathway known as the C5 pathway. ALA is synthesized through the condensation of glycine and succinyl-CoA. In humans, transcription of ALA synthase is tightly controlled by the presence of Fe2+-binding elements, to prevent accumulation of porphyrin intermediates in the absence of iron. There are two forms of ALA synthase in the body. One form is expressed in red blood cell precursor cells (ALAS2), whereas the other (ALAS1) is ubiquitously expressed throughout the body. The red blood cell form is coded by a gene on chromosome X, whereas the other form is coded by a gene on chromosome 3.

The disease X-linked sideroblastic anemia is caused by mutations in the ALA synthase gene on chromosome X, whereas no diseases are known to be caused by mutations in the other gene. Gain of function mutations in the erythroid specific ALA synthase gene have been shown recently to cause a previously unknown form of porphyria known as X-linked-dominant protoporphyria.

==Enzyme structure and properties==
PLP-dependent enzymes are prevalent because they are needed to transform amino acids into other resources. ALAS is a homodimer with similarly sized sub units and the active sites consisting of amino acid side chains such as arginine, threonine, and lysine exist at a subunity interface. The protein when extracted from R. spheroids contains 1600-folds and weighs about 80,000 daltons. Enzymatic activity varies for different sources of the enzyme.

==Reaction mechanism==

The active sites of ALAS utilize three key amino acid side chains: Arg-85 and Thr-430 and Lys-313. Although these three amino acids have been identified to allow this reaction to proceed, they would be inactive without the addition of cofactor pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) whose role in this synthesis is detailed in the image below. Before the reaction can begin, the PLP cofactor binds to the lysine side chain to form a Schiff base that promotes attack by glycine substrate. Lysine acts as a general base during this mechanism. In the detailed reaction mechanism, the hydronium atoms that are added in come from a variety of residues that offer hydrogen bonds to facilitate ALA synthesis.
ALA synthase removes the carboxyl group from glycine and the CoA from the succinyl-CoA by means of its prosthetic group pyridoxal phosphate (a vitamin b6 derivative), forming δ-aminolevulinic acid (dALA), so called because the amino group is on the fourth carbon atom in the molecule. This reaction mechanism is particularly unique relative to other enzymes that use the PLP cofactor because Glycine is initially deprotonated by a highly conserved active site lysine, leading to condensation with succinyl-CoA and loss of CoA. Protonation of the carbonyl group of the intermediate by an active site histidine leads to loss of the carboxyl group. The last intermediate is finally reprotonated to produce ALA. Dissociation of ALA from the enzyme is the rate limiting step of the enzymatic reaction and was shown to be depended upon a slow conformational change of the enzyme. The function of pyridoxal phosphate is to facilitate the removal of hydrogen, by utilizing the electrophilic pyridinium ring as an electron sink.

The location of this enzyme in biological systems is indicative of the feedback that it may receive. ALA Synthase has been found in bacteria, yeast, avian and mammalian liver and blood cells and bone marrow. The location of this enzyme in animal cells is within the mitochondria. Since the enzyme appears to be located near its source of succinyl-CoA and the end of the heme pathway indicates that the starting and end points of heme biosynthesis serves as feedback for ALA synthase. ALA synthase is also inhibited by hemin and glucose.

==Biological function==
ALAS1 and ALAS2 catalyze the first step in the process of heme synthesis. It is the first irreversible step and is also rate limiting. This means that the beginning of the formation of hemes is very intentional and subject to a variety of areas of feedback. For example, the two substrates, oxaloacetate and glycine, are highly produced by and utilized in other essential biological processes such as glycolysis and the TCA cycle. The image below illustrates the heme synthesis pathway and the role ALAS plays.


==Disease relevance==
Aminolevulinic Acid Synthase Deficiency results in a lack of ability to create heme since its job is to catalyze the first step in the process. These deficiencies are often a result of genetic mutation that can result in a variety of diseases. One such disease is x-linked sideroblastic anemia which results in the appearance of red blood cells in the bone marrow. This disease is linked specifically with mutations in the genes that encode for ALAS2.

<doc id="782556" wikidata="Q443868" url="?curid=782556" title="Jon Fosse">
<text>Jon Olav Fosse (; born 29 September 1959) is a Norwegian author, translator, and playwright. In 2023, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for his innovative plays and prose which give voice to the unsayable.&quot;

Fosse&#x27;s work spans over seventy novels, poems, children&#x27;s books, essays, and theatre plays, which have been translated into over fifty languages.
The most performed Norwegian playwright after Henrik Ibsen, Fosse is currently—with productions presented on over a thousand stages worldwide—one of the most performed contemporary playwrights globally. His minimalist and deeply introspective plays, with language often bordering on lyrical prose and poetry, have been noted to represent a modern continuation of the dramatic tradition established by Henrik Ibsen in the 19th century. Fosse&#x27;s work has often been placed within the tradition of post-dramatic theatre, while several of his notable novels have been described as belonging to the style of post-modernist and avant-garde literature, due to their minimalism, lyricism and unorthodox use of syntax.

==Biography==
Jon Fosse was born in 1959 in Haugesund, Norway, and grew up in Strandebarm. His family were Quakers and Pietists, which he credits with shaping his spiritual views. A serious accident at age seven brought him close to death; Fosse witnessed seeing a shimmering light and experiencing peace and beauty. Fosse recalls &quot;I think this experience fundamentally changed me, and perhaps made me a writer. He started writing around the age of twelve, despite Fosse&#x27;s claims that he was not very concerned with books. As a teenager, Fosse was interested in becoming a rock guitarist, and he began to dedicate more time to writing once he gave up his musical ambitions. He also played the fiddle, and much of his teenage writing practice involved creating his own lyrics for musical pieces. Growing up, he was influenced by communism and anarchism and has described himself as a &quot;hippie&quot;.

Fosse enrolled at the University of Bergen and studied comparative literature during which time he began writing in Nynorsk. His debut novel, &quot;Raudt, svart&quot; (&quot;Red, Black&quot;), was published in 1983 and was influenced by the Nynorsk writer Tarjei Vesaas. The novel contrasted with the social realist fiction popular in Norway at the time and emphasised linguistic expression rather than plot. He published a second novel, &quot;Stengd gitar&quot; (&quot;Closed Guitar&quot;) in 1985 and a poetic cycle, &quot;Engel med vatn i augene&quot; (&quot;Angel with Water in Its Eyes&quot;) in 1986. He gained a master&#x27;s degree in comparative literature in 1987, again from the University of Bergen, and published his third novel, &quot;Blod. Steinen er&quot; (&quot;Blood. The Stone Is&quot;). Following his separation from his wife in 1989, Fosse published a novel and his first collection of essays. In the early 1990s, he continued to publish novels and worked with his second wife, Grethe Fatima Syéd, on several translations.

Fosse&#x27;s first play, &quot;Og aldri skal vi skiljast&quot; (&quot;And We&#x27;ll Never Be Parted&quot;), was performed and published in 1994. Fosse has written novels, short stories, poetry, children&#x27;s books, essays, and plays. His works have been translated into more than forty languages. Between working on his novels, Fosse works as a translator of other authors&#x27; works.

== Literary style and influences ==
Fosse writes in nynorsk. His plays are seen as a modern continuation of the tradition established by Henrik Ibsen in the 19th century. His prose works are often said to be closer to poetry than the traditional novel. Fosse consider himself primarily a poet, regardless of the literary form he is using. Fosse&#x27;s native Vestlandet is a frequently present inspiration in his writing.

Fosse mentions Samuel Beckett, as well as Georg Trakl and Thomas Bernhard as his elective relatives. Other authors and books that have influenced his life and work include Olav H. Hauge, Knut Hamsun, Tarjei Vesaas, Franz Kafka, William Faulkner, Virginia Woolf, and the Bible.

== Recognition ==
Fosse is the most performed Norwegian playwright after Henrik Ibsen. 

In 2003, Fosse was made a chevalier of the Ordre national du Mérite of France. He has also been ranked number 83 on the list of the Top 100 living geniuses by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

Since 2011, Fosse has been granted the Grotten, an honorary residence owned by the Norwegian state and located on the premises of the Royal Palace in the city centre of Oslo. The use of the Grotten as a permanent residence is an honour specially bestowed by the King of Norway for contributions to Norwegian arts and culture. He was among the literary consultants for Bibel 2011, a Norwegian translation of the Bible published in 2011. He was also awarded the 2015 Nordic Council&#x27;s Literature Prize for the trilogy &quot;Andvake&quot; (&quot;Wakefulness&quot;), &quot;Olavs draumar&quot; (&quot;Olav&#x27;s Dreams&quot;), and &quot;Kveldsvævd&quot; (&quot;Weariness&quot;).

Many of Fosse&#x27;s works have been translated into Persian by Mohammad Hamed, and his dramatic works have been performed on the main stages in Tehran, Iran. Six of Fosse&#x27;s plays have been translated into American English by interdisciplinary artist Sarah Cameron Sunde, who also directed their American debut productions in New York City and Pittsburgh, Pa.. The translated works which have been produced include &quot;Night Sings its Songs&quot; (2004), &quot;deathvariations&quot; (2006), &quot;SaKaLa&quot; (2008), &quot;A Summer Day&quot; (2012), and &quot;Dream of Autumn&quot; (2013).

In April 2022, Fosse&#x27;s novel &quot;A New Name: Septology VI-VII&quot;, translated into English by Damion Searls, was shortlisted for the International Booker Prize. The book was named a finalist for the 2023 National Book Critics Circle Award in Fiction.

In October 2023, Fosse was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. This made him the first Nynorsk writer to receive the prize and the fourth Norwegian to win it, following Sigrid Undset, who won it in 1928.

== Personal life ==
Fosse has been married three times. He was married to Bjørg Sissel (b. 1959), a nurse, from 1980 to 1992 with whom he had a son. The next year, he married Grethe Fatima Syéd, an Indian-Norwegian translator and author, although they later separated. They had two daughters and a son during their marriage.

Fosse spends part of his time with his third wife, Anna (m. 2011), who is Slovak, in Hainburg an der Donau in Austria. He also owns homes in Bergen and two more in other parts of western Norway. Originally, he was a member of the Church of Norway (although he described himself as an atheist before 2012). In 2012–2013, he joined the Catholic Church and voluntarily admitted himself to rehabilitation to address his long-term issues with alcohol consumption. His conversion to Catholicism helped Fosse in his effort to stop drinking. Fosse practices solitude by keeping away from noises, never watching television, radio and rarely listening to music. In his pursuit of solitude, Fosse sees writing as a confession and a prayer.

<doc id="782564" wikidata="Q60179" url="?curid=782564" title="Viewing frustum">
<text>In 3D computer graphics, a viewing frustum or view frustum is the region of space in the modeled world that may appear on the screen; it is the field of view of a perspective virtual camera system.

The view frustum is typically obtained by taking a geometrical frustum—that is a truncation with parallel planes—of the pyramid of vision, which is the adaptation of (idealized) &quot;cone of vision&quot; that a camera or eye would have to the rectangular viewports typically used in computer graphics. Some authors use &quot;pyramid of vision&quot; as a synonym for view frustum itself, i.e. consider it truncated.

The exact shape of this region varies depending on what kind of camera lens is being simulated, but typically it is a frustum of a rectangular pyramid (hence the name). The planes that cut the frustum perpendicular to the viewing direction are called the &quot;near plane&quot; and the &quot;far plane&quot;. Objects closer to the camera than the near plane or beyond the far plane are not drawn. Sometimes, the far plane is placed infinitely far away from the camera so all objects within the frustum are drawn regardless of their distance from the camera.

Viewing-frustum culling is the process of removing from the rendering process those objects that lie completely outside the viewing frustum. Rendering these objects would be a waste of resources since they are not directly visible. To make culling fast, it is usually done using bounding volumes surrounding the objects rather than the objects themselves.

==Definitions==
;VPN: the view-plane normal – a normal to the view plane.

;VUV: the view-up vector – the vector on the view plane that indicates the upward direction.

;VRP: the viewing reference point – a point located on the view plane, and the origin of the VRC.

;PRP: the projection reference point – the point where the image is projected from, for parallel projection, the PRP is at infinity.

;VRC: the viewing-reference coordinate system.

The geometry is defined by a field of view angle (in the &#x27;y&#x27; direction), as well as an aspect ratio. Further, a set of z-planes define the near and far bounds of the frustum. Together this information can be used to calculate a projection matrix for rendering transformation in a graphics pipeline.

<doc id="782565" wikidata="Q679768" url="?curid=782565" title="Café de Paris sauce">
<text>Café de Paris sauce is a butter-based sauce served with grilled beef. When it is served with the sliced portion of an &quot;entrecôte&quot; (in American English: a rib eye steak) or a &quot;faux-filet&quot; (in English: a sirloin steak) the resulting dish is known as &quot;&quot;entrecôte&quot; Café de Paris&quot;. 

The sauce is named after the restaurant where it was created, the Café de Paris in Geneva, Switzerland.

==History==
The sauce was popularised in the 1930s by the Café de Paris restaurant in Geneva, then owned by Arthur-François (Freddy) Dumont, and &quot;entrecôte&quot; Café de Paris remains the restaurant&#x27;s speciality. The Café de Paris attributes the origin of the sauce to Mr Dumont&#x27;s father-in-law, Mr Boubier. 

Today the restaurant also ships the sauce to several other restaurants which serve it under licence: the Café de Paris in Lausanne, the À l&#x27;Entrecôte in Sion (Switzerland), the Brasserie L&#x27;Entrecôte in Lisbon and Porto, and the Entrecôte Café de Paris restaurants in Dubai, Kuwait, Riyadh and Hong Kong.

A closely similar sauce is also served by the Entrecôte groups of restaurants operated by the descendants of Paul Gineste de Saurs in Paris, Geneva, Toulouse, Lyon, Madrid, London, New York, Beirut, Doha, Dubai, Riyadh, and other cities.

==Ingredients and preparation==

Both the Café de Paris and the Entrecôte groups of restaurants consider the sauce&#x27;s ingredients and method of preparation to be a trade secret.

The Paris newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot; reports that the sauce as served by Le Relais de Venise – L&#x27;Entrecôte is made from poultry livers, fresh thyme and thyme flowers, full cream (19 percent butterfat), white Dijon mustard, butter, water, salt, and pepper.

 According to &quot;Le Monde&quot;, the recipe involves heating one pan with the livers and thyme until they start to change colour. In a second pan, the cream is reduced on low heat with the mustard and infused with the flavour of the thyme flowers. It is then blended and pressed through a fine strainer into the reduced cream. As the sauce thickens, the butter is incorporated into it with a little water, it is beaten smooth, and fresh-ground salt and pepper are added. The London newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot;, however, reports that the proprietor of Le Relais de Venise – L&#x27;Entrecôte has dismissed the &quot;Le Monde&quot; report as inaccurate.

The Café de Paris serves its &quot;entrecôte&quot; on a bed of the sauce, on a platter kept hot atop a trivet with a warming candle in the base. Initially the sauce is a stiff whipped froth, tawny in colour, but as it melts down to a liquid it reverts to its natural creamy pea-soup-green colour. At the Entrecôte groups of restaurants, the sauce is served as a creamy pea-soup-green liquid from the outset rather than as a whipped froth, it is less prone to separate, and it is less salty.

==Café de Paris butter==

Distinct from the classic Café de Paris sauce are various compound butters commonly referred to as Café de Paris butter. Café de Paris is usually shaped into a log and then chilled, which slices are taken off to be placed onto a hot steak. It typically contains a mixture of herbs, spices, and other condiments such as mustard, marjoram, dill, rosemary, tarragon, paprika, capers, chives, curry powder, parsley, shallot, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and anchovies. The butter is shaped into a roll using aluminium foil and chilled. When the dish is served, a piece of the butter is sliced off and allowed to melt on the hot meat.

<doc id="782568" wikidata="Q6588" url="?curid=782568" title="Périgueux">
<text>Périgueux (, ; or ) is a commune in the Dordogne department, in the administrative region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine, southwestern France.

Périgueux is the prefecture of Dordogne, and the capital city of Périgord. It is also the seat of a Roman Catholic diocese.

==History==

The name &quot;Périgueux&quot; comes from Petrocorii, a Latinization of Celtic words meaning &quot;the four tribes&quot; – the Gallic people that held the area before the Roman conquest. Périgueux was their capital city. In 200 BC, the Petrocorii came from the north and settled at Périgueux and established an encampment at La Boissière. After the Roman invasion, they left this post and established themselves on the plain of L&#x27;Isle, and the town of Vesunna was created. This Roman city was eventually embellished with amenities such as temples, baths, amphitheatres, and a forum. At the end of the third century AD, the Roman city was surrounded by ramparts, and the town took the name of Civitas Petrocoriorum.

In the 10th century, Le Puy-Saint-Front was constructed around an abbey next to the old Gallo-Roman city. It was organised into a municipality around 1182.

During the year 1940, many Jews from Alsace and Alsatians were evacuated to Périgueux.

Simone Mareuil (a lead actress from the surrealist film &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot;) committed self-immolation on 24 October 1954 by dousing herself in gasoline and burning herself to death in a public square in Périgueux.

==Geography==
The Isle river flows through Périgueux.

==Demographics==
In 2018, 30,060 people lived in the town, while its metropolitan area had a population of 113,384.

==Sights==
Sights include: the remains of a Roman amphitheatre (known locally as the arènes romaines) the centre of which has been turned into a green park with a water fountain; the remains of a temple of the Gallic goddess &quot;Vesunna&quot;; and a luxurious Roman villa, called the &quot;Domus of Vesunna&quot;, built around a garden courtyard surrounded by a colonnaded peristyle now housed in the Vesunna Gallo-Roman Museum.

===Cathedral===

The cathedral of St Front was built after 1120 and restored in the 19th century.

The history of the church of St Front of Périgueux has given rise to numerous discussions between archaeologists. Félix de Verneihl claims that St Front&#x27;s was a copy of St Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice; Quicherat, that it was copied from the church of the Holy Apostles of Constantinople. M. Brutails is of the opinion that even if the style of St Front&#x27;s reveals an imitation of Oriental art, the construction differs altogether from Byzantine methods. The dates 984–1047, often given for the erection of St Front&#x27;s, he considers too early; he thinks that the present church of St Front was built about 1120–1173, in imitation of a foreign monument by a native local school of architecture which erected the other domed buildings in the south-west of France.

The local architect, Paul Abadie (1812–1884), was responsible for radical changes to St Front&#x27;s which are no longer appreciated by architects or local residents who prefer the purer Romanesque church of Saint-Étienne de la Cité, the former Cathedral of Périgueux.

The cathedral is part of the World Heritage Sites of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France.

==Transport==
Périgueux railway station offers connections to Limoges, Bordeaux, Brive-la-Gaillarde, and other regional destinations. The trains are operated by train company SNCF.

== Climate ==
Périgueux has an oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;) with warm to hot summers combined with cool to mild winters. Périgueux has a mild climate for its latitude and inland position due to the significant Gulf Stream influence on the Bay of Biscay to its west. The resulting maritime air warms winters, while at the same time it is far enough inland to cause relatively warm summers on average.

== Personalities ==
Périgueux was the birthplace of:

* Pierre Daumesnil (1776–1832), general of the First Empire.
* Georges Bégué (1911–1993), engineer and agent in the Special Operations Executive
*Francine Benoît (1894–1990), composer, music critic and teacher, who gained Portuguese citizenship in 1929.

<text>Tennent Caledonian is a brewing company based in Glasgow, Scotland.

It was founded in 1740 on the bank of the Molendinar Burn by Hugh and Robert Tennent. It is owned by C&amp;C Group plc, which purchased the Tennent Caledonian Breweries subsidiary in 2009, from Belgian brewing company Anheuser-Busch InBev (formerly known as InBev).

The company produces Tennent&#x27;s Lager, Scotland&#x27;s market leading brand of pale lager, first brewed at the Wellpark Brewery in 1885.

==History==

Wellpark Brewery was originally known as the Drygate Brewery. It was founded as H. &amp; R. Tennent in 1740 at Drygate Bridge, near Glasgow Cathedral, by Hugh and Robert Tennent, although brewing had taken place at the same site on the banks of the Molendinar Burn by their ancestor, Robert Tennent, since 1556, making it the oldest continuous commercial concern in Glasgow.

Hugh Tennent&#x27;s sons, John and Robert, continued the family business, trading as J. &amp; R. Tennent from 1769. The business expanded in the 1790s when the Tennent family purchased the neighbouring brewery of William McLehose, and renamed the site Wellpark Brewery.

The firm originally brewed stout and strong export ales. By the mid-19th century, J. &amp; R. Tennent was the world&#x27;s largest bottled beer exporter. Robert Tennent died in 1826 and John Tennent in 1827. Hugh Tennent (the eldest son of Robert) then assumed control of the business. Hugh Tennent retired in 1855 with his fifth son, Charles Tennent, taking over, but he died in 1864, some months before his father. The brewery was subsequently operated by trustees on behalf of Charles Tennent&#x27;s sons, Archibald and Hugh.

In 1884, Hugh Tennent took control of the company and first brewed Tennent&#x27;s lager in 1885. He later built a new lager brewery on the Wellpark site, which was begun in 1889 and completed in 1891. J. &amp; R. Tennent produced the first draught lager in 1924, the first canned lager in 1935 and the first keg lager in 1963.

J. &amp; R. Tennent was acquired by Charrington United Breweries in 1963, and in 1966 formally merged with United Caledonian Breweries, Charrington&#x27;s other Scottish subsidiary, to form Tennent Caledonian Breweries. The new company&#x27;s brewing was concentrated at the Wellpark Brewery and the Heriot Brewery in Edinburgh. Wellpark was redeveloped between 1965 and 1968, but Heriot was demolished in the 1990s. In 1967, Charringtons merged with Bass to form the Bass Charrington Group. It was later bought by the Belgian brewer Interbrew (now InBev) in June 2000, which became part of Anheuser-Busch InBev in 2008.

C&amp;C Group of Ireland announced a deal to buy the brewery and the Tennent&#x27;s brand from AB-InBev on 27 August 2009. It also agreed to acquire the Scottish and Irish distribution rights to Beck&#x27;s and Stella Artois as part of the £180 million offer.

In May 2014, C&amp;C Group and Williams Bros Brewing Co. opened a craft brewery joint venture on the site, called Drygate Brewing Co., named after Drygate – a street which adjoins the western perimeter of the brewery.

==Beers==
Tennent&#x27;s Lager is Scotland&#x27;s best-selling pale lager, with approximately 60% of the Scottish lager market. The lager was first brewed in 1885 by Hugh Tennent and in 1893 it won the highest award at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair. Tennent&#x27;s Lager is certified by the Vegetarian Society as being suitable for vegetarians.

The lager was once famous for the design of its cans, which featured photos of various female models printed onto the side, known affectionately as &quot;The Lager Lovelies&quot;. This feature was used by Tennent&#x27;s up until the final campaign in 1989. Today, authentic original Lager Lovely cans are sought after among collectors. The can design is now a plain yellow colour, with the company&#x27;s trademark large red &quot;T&quot; featuring prominently. A banner heads the can, reading: &quot;Scotland&#x27;s favourite beer, only ever brewed at Wellpark Brewery, Glasgow&quot;.

The brand&#x27;s super strength lager, Tennent&#x27;s Super (9% ABV), is no longer produced by Wellpark and is produced in Luton by Inbev, who kept the brand after the sale of Wellpark to C&amp;C.

Caledonia Best was launched in November 2011, and uses 100% Scottish barley.

==Sponsorship==
The Tennent&#x27;s brand is used for sponsoring music and sport; this included Scotland&#x27;s largest outdoor music festival: T in the Park from 1994 to 2016. Tennent&#x27;s previously sponsored T On The Fringe (part of the Edinburgh Festival), Triptych and Tennents ViTal in Northern Ireland. Tennent&#x27;s sponsorship of T in the Park is continuing in the wake of its acquisition by C&amp;C Group.

In football, the brand has been used to sponsor Scottish Futsal and historically, the Scottish Cup for 18 years and the FA Charity Shield from 1989 to 1992, Tennents&#x27; Sixes and the Tennent&#x27;s UK Snooker Championship even so the latter was held at the time in Preston in England. Tennent&#x27;s also previously sponsored the Scotland national football team, replacing supermarket chain Morrisons. This deal was signed on 3 October 2006 and came into effect in time for the European Championship qualifying victory against France on 7 October 2006. This sponsorship came to an end on 24 May 2010.

Tennents sponsored Scottish football&#x27;s &quot;Old Firm&quot; duo, Celtic and Rangers from 2010 until 2013 following their contracts with Carling expired at the end of previous season. Also, from 2010 to 2012 they sponsored EFL League One club Preston North End. It was previously the sponsor of the Irish Cup football competition in Northern Ireland.

<text>Liljendal is a former municipality of Finland.

It is located in the province of Southern Finland and was part of the Eastern Uusimaa region. The municipality had a population of 1,472 (31 December 2009) and covered an area of of which is water. The population density was .

The municipality was bilingual, with majority (74.9%) being Swedish and minority (23.8%) Finnish speakers. The municipality has previously also been known as Liljentaali in Finnish documents.

Liljendal was consolidated to Loviisa, together with Pernå and Ruotsinpyhtää, on January 1, 2010.

== History ==
Liljendal was originally the name of a seat farm (säteri) in the village of Sävträsk. Its name may have been derived from that of an old Cistercian monastery in Lower Saxony, &quot;Lilienthal&quot;. At the time, it was a part of the Pernå (Pernaja) parish. The name got its current meaning when the seat farm and nine villages near it became their own chapel community in 1791. Liljendal became a separate parish in 1914.

<text>Lennox Leslie Wongama Ngweyesizwe Sebe (26 July 1926 – 23 July 1994) was the chief minister of the Xhosa bantustan of Ciskei after its self-rule in 1972, and the nominally independent country&#x27;s first president from 1983. He was the Chief of the AmaKhambashe Tribal Authority and his praise name (isikhahlelo) was Ngweyesizwe.

==Early life==
Born in Belstone, near King William&#x27;s Town and he is brother of Charles Sebe, Sebe worked first as a school teacher before being appointed as a school principal in 1954. In 1968, Sebe was elected as a representative of the Xhosa Kingdom&#x27;s AmaNtinde chieftaincy in the Ciskeian Territorial Authority and became responsible for Educational and Cultural Affairs, before transferring to the Agriculture portfolio in 1971.

==Rise to power==
Sebe founded the Ciskei National Independence Party and contested Ciskei&#x27;s inaugural election in February 1973. He was elected to the Zwelitsha electorate and succeeded Chief Justice Mabandla to become the second Chief Minister of Ciskei on 21 May 1973. He would then become president when Ciskei was granted nominal independence from South Africa on 4 December 1981. Sebe declared himself President for Life in 1983.

Sebe was faced with leading an economically unviable state, with a population of one million, many of them Xhosa forced to relocate to the bantustan in the 1970s, during South Africa&#x27;s apartheid regime.

==Dictatorship==
Immediately upon independence, Sebe consolidated power in a dictatorship, supported by the 1,000-strong military force. He crushed all opposition, including bitter protests against a transit fare strike in 1983 (most residents worked outside the bantustan, and relied on public transportation to get them to work). That same year, Sebe&#x27;s brother, Lieutenant General Charles Sebe, head of Ciskei&#x27;s intelligence service, attempted to overthrow the government. Though Charles Sebe was arrested, he escaped from prison in 1986 and made his way to nearby Transkei, where he continued to agitate against the regime. In 1987, he orchestrated the kidnapping of Sebe&#x27;s son Khwane, who was held prisoner in Transkei until Sebe agreed to release political prisoners in exchange for his son.

Sebe visited Israel on several occasions during his presidency and established a trade office in Tel Aviv that was run by two Israelis with ties to the Gush Emunim Israeli settler movement. During this period, the Ciskeian capital, Bisho, signed a sister-city agreement with the settlement community of Ariel in the West Bank. Sebe once claimed that Israel had granted official recognition to Ciskei, although the Israeli Foreign Ministry denied this.

==Collapse==
Sebe was overthrown by a military coup led by Brigadier General Oupa Gqozo on 4 March 1990 while on state visit to Hong Kong and charged with corruption and human rights violations. He died in 1994 after the reintegration to Ciskei in South Africa.

<text>Loppi (; , also ) is a municipality in Finland. It is located in the province of Southern Finland and is part of the Kanta-Häme region, located about 50 kilometers (about 30 miles) south of the city of Hämeenlinna. Loppi was founded in 1632. The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is . The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

Neighbour municipalities are Hyvinkää, Hämeenlinna, Janakkala, Karkkila, Riihimäki, Tammela and Vihti. The most significant main road connection to get from Loppi to Riihimäki is the national road 54, which runs between Tammela and Hollola, and which is connected to the Highway 3 (E12) between Helsinki and Tampere. Another significant road connection in the direction of Helsinki is the regional road 132 passing through the municipality of Nurmijärvi.

The subject of the municipal coat of arms, where the iron symbol has sunk into a wave-cut plate, refers to the lifting of limonite from the lake in the early period.

According to local folklore, Kaakkomäki of Loppi was inhabited by a giant devil in ancient times. When Loppi&#x27;s old church, Saint Bridget Church, was built in the 17th century, the devil tried to disrupt the construction and became enraged when the church bells rang. The devil tried to destroy the church bell tower and threw it with a large rock. However, the rock flew over the church to Tiirinkallio on the shore of Lake Loppijärvi, from where the rock was combed into the lake. The stone in the lake brought a disaster: cattle fell ill and animals died. So the villagers crammed the rock up the cliff and the luck of the cattle was restored.

Loppi is especially known for its potato cultivation, and the potato is classified as the municipality&#x27;s title plant. Potato porridge and lingonberry broth cooked from barley flour, as well as a sweetened potato casserole and meat sauce, were named the traditional food of the Loppi parish in the 1980s.

==History==
Loppi is part of a historic province of Tavastia. Originally it was part of the chapel parish of Janakkala. The Loppi Chapel Parish, formed in the 16th century, included only seven of the current Loppi villages: Läyliäinen, Sajaniemi, Joentaka, Loppi, Hunsala, Teväntö and Pilpala. Other villages belonged directly to Janakkala. The independent parish of Loppi became in 1632. This also included other villages that later belonged to Loppi and also Kytäjä, (now part of Hyvinkää), which had been part of Janakkala until 1579, then became part of Nurmijärvi, with the exception of Vatsia&#x27;s house, which remained in connection with Loppi. The administrator of Loppi was much wider in its territory than the administrator of the church. When the Riihimäki township was founded in 1926, the Vatsia house in the village of Kytäjä was moved from Loppi to Riihimäki borough.

Between 1907 and 1954, there was a narrow-gauge railway connection between Riihimäki and Loppi, built by the industrialist H. G. Paloheimo. After the Second World War, Loppi was inhabited by just under 1,100 Karelian migrants. Most of them, nearly 900, were from Kamennogorsk parish.

==Geography==
The forested highland of Tammela, which extends to the western part of Loppi, and the Salpausselkä, which cross the municipality&#x27;s area, form a watershed between the Kokemäki River watershed to the north and the smaller river basins flowing to the south. The waterways descending to the north originate from Lake Kaartjärvi and Lake Loppi and join in Janakkala in Lake Kernaala. Lake Hirvijärvi flows into the Vantaa River watershed in the southeast on the border of Loppi, Riihimäki and Hyvinkää and Lake Keihäsjärvi in the south in Läyliäinen. Lake Keritty and Lake Punelia in the southwestern part of Loppi belong to the Svartån River watershed, which flows through Lake Lohja. Lake Pääjärvi in the northwest corner of Loppi belongs to the Loimijoki River catchment area in the Kokemäki River watershed.

===Villages===

There are three big villages in the municipality: Loppi (Kirkonkylä), Launonen and Läyliäinen. Most of the inhabitants of the municipality live in these villages, as they are located along the significant main road connections of the municipality.

Other (smaller) villages are Hevosoja, Hirvijärvi, Hunsala, Joentaka, Kormu, Metsäkylä, Ourajoki, Pilpala, Räyskälä, Sajaniemi, Salo, Teväntö, Topeno and Vojakkala.

==Services==
Loppi&#x27;s primary health care services are provided by the Regional Health Center of Riihimäki. in the emergency cases, the health care is available at night from the emergency room of in Hämeenlinna.

<text>Jügderdemidiin Gürragchaa (; , , born 5 December 1947) is a Mongolian cosmonaut and military leader. He was the first Mongolian and second Asian to go into space. He also was Mongolia&#x27;s Defense Minister from 2000 to 2004.

==Early life and spaceflight==
Born in Gurvanbulag, Bulgan, Gürragchaa studied in Ulaanbaatar to become an aerospace engineer. In 1966, he joined the Mongolian Air Force. He graduated from the Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy in 1978.

He was selected as part of the eighth Intercosmos program on 1 March 1978, at time he was in the rank of Major General. His backup was Maidarjavyn Ganzorig. Gürragchaa, along with Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Dzhanibekov, departed from Baikonur Cosmodrome on 22 March 1981. They docked with Salyut 6.

While in orbit, Dzhanibekov and Gürragchaa carried out experiments on Earth science. After 124 orbits and 7 days, 20 hours and 42 minutes in space, Gürragchaa and Dzhanibekov landed 170 km southeast of Dzhezkasgan.

==Post-flight career==
The Zaisan Memorial, a monument south of Ulaanbaatar dedicated to Russian–Mongolian friendship, includes a mural which depicts amongst its scenes Gürragchaa&#x27;s 1981 flight.

Gürragchaa worked as the chief of staff of air defense for the Mongolian Armed Forces, served as the Defense Minister of Mongolia from 2000 to 2004 and was a member of State Great Khural from 2004 to 2008.

==Personal life==
Gürragchaa is married and has two children. He heads the fund for development of bandy in Mongolia. Aside from Mongolian, Gürragchaa is fluent in Russian due to his time in Russia.

== Awards ==
* Hero of the Soviet Union (30 March 1981) 
* Order of Lenin
* Hero of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic (1981)
* Order of Sukhbaatar (1981)

<text>Luhanka (, also ) is a municipality of Finland. It is located in the Central Finland region. The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water.

The population density is . There are also many summertime cottages in Luhanka.

The municipality is unilingually Finnish. The municipality is also been known as &quot;&quot; in Swedish documents.

Mimicking the badger in the coat of arms of Luhanka, the permanent residents include the official animal mascot of the municipality, Sisu the Badger (&quot;Sisu-mäyrä&quot;).

==Geography==

Neighboring municipalities are Hartola, Joutsa, Jyväskylä, Jämsä, Kuhmoinen and Sysmä.

There are all together 61 lakes in Luhanka. Biggest lakes in Luhanka are Päijänne, Tammijärvi-Hauha and Jutilanjärvi.

== History ==
Luhanka was first mentioned as a village within the Sysmä parish in 1462. The village gets its name from the lake Luhankjärvi or Luhankajärvi, the name of which comes from the word &quot;luha&quot;, a variant of &quot;luhta&quot;, a word which refers to a type of swamp. &quot;-nka&quot; is a derivational suffix, which is also found in other place names such as Puolanka and Maaninka.

It was granted a chapel in 1767 and became a separate parish in 1864. Due to the small population of the municipality, the parish of Luhanka became subordinate to the parish of Joutsa in 2006.

==Notable people==
*Politician Hertta Kuusinen was born in Luhanka in 1904
*Writer Kreetta Onkeli has spent childhood in Luhanka

<doc id="782600" wikidata="Q2978746" url="?curid=782600" title="Clean climbing">
<text>Clean climbing is rock climbing techniques and equipment which climbers use in order to avoid damage to the rock. These techniques date at least in part from the 1920s and earlier in England, but the term itself may have emerged in about 1970 during the widespread and rapid adoption in the United States and Canada of nuts (also called chocks), and the very similar but often larger hexes, in preference to pitons, which damage rock and are more difficult and time-consuming to install. Pitons were thus eliminated in North America as a primary means of climbing protection in a period of less than three years.

Due to major improvements in equipment and technique, the term &quot;clean climbing&quot; has come to occupy a far less central, and somewhat different, position in discussions of climbing technology, compared with that of the brief and formative period when it emerged four decades ago.

==Rock preservation==
Drilled and hammered equipment such as bolts, pitons, copperheads and others scar rock permanently. Around 1970, various protection devices that were far less likely to damage rock and much faster and easier to install became widely available. Such &quot;clean&quot; gear, as of contemporary times, now include spring-loaded camming devices, nuts and chocks, and slings, for hitching natural features.

Contemporary alternatives to pitons, which used to be called &quot;clean climbing gear&quot;, have made most routes safer and easier to protect, and have greatly contributed to a remarkable increase in the standards of difficulty notable since about 1970. Pitons are now regarded as highly specialized equipment, needed by a small minority of climbers interested in routes of peculiar difficulty.

Even clean gear can damage rock, if the rock is very soft or if the hardware is impacted with substantial force. A falling climber&#x27;s energy can drive a camming device&#x27;s lobes outward with great force. This can carve grooves into the rock&#x27;s surface, or, if the cam is in a crack behind a flake, the expansion can loosen the flake and eventually (or suddenly) split it off. Wedges (nuts) can also be forced into a crack much harder than the leader intended, and cracks have been damaged as cleaners try to chisel or pull stuck nuts out of their constrictions. In very soft rock, nuts and cams both can blow right through the rock and out of their placements, even with forces as small as those generated by tugging to &quot;set&quot; the piece. Although hooks are often categorized as clean, they easily damage soft rock and can even damage granite.

==History==
Morley Wood during the ascent of Pigott&#x27;s Climb on Clogwyn Du&#x27;r Arddu (North Wales) in 1926 reportedly was the first climber to use pebbles slung with rope for protecting a rock climb. These were replaced by the use of machine nuts in England during the 1950s.

In 1961, John Brailsford of Sheffield, England, reportedly was the first to manufacture nuts specifically for climbing.

Rock scarring caused by pitons was an important impetus for the emergence of the term, and the initial reason climbers largely abandoned pitons. However, today what was in the 1970s called &quot;clean protection&quot; and regarded by many climbers of the day with some suspicion with regard to safety, is now recognized as a faster, easier, more efficient and safer means of protecting most climbing routes than pitons- which are now, in comparison with the 1960s, rarely used.

When chrome molybdenum steel pitons replaced softer iron in the early 1960s, pitons became more easily removable, resulting in their more intensive use and alarming damage to increasingly popular climbing routes. In response, there was a &quot;movement&quot; among U.S. climbers around 1970 to eliminate their use.

Although bolts continue to be used today for sport climbing, and aid climbers, rescuers and occasionally mountaineers may employ pitons, bolts and a variety of other hammered techniques, the average free climber today has no experience with hammering or drilling. Prior to the introduction of spring-loaded camming devices (in about 1980), clean climbing involved a safety trade-off in certain situations. Protection methods of today, however, are generally seen as faster, safer and easier than those of the piton era, and average run-outs between gear placements have probably become shorter on many routes.

Although English climbers had long used stones wedged into cracks and slung with cord for protection, this practice was rare in the U.S. In the early 1960s, after climbing a while in Britain, Yale physicist and notable New England climber, John Reppy, imported nylon-slung machine nut protection to Connecticut&#x27;s Ragged Mountain. Soft-steel pitons held poorly in Ragged Mountain&#x27;s cracks, and the nuts provided a more reliable protection. Nuts were therefore used as climbing protection in Connecticut about a decade before popular use in the U.S. 

In 1967, Royal Robbins returned from England with a sampling of artificially manufactured chock stones. He promptly made the first ascent of the &quot;Nutcracker&quot; in Yosemite Valley using exclusively these wedges. He wrote about this six-pitch climb and others in &quot;Summit&quot; magazine and the &quot;American Alpine Journal&quot; but without much obvious immediate influence.

In 1971, John Stannard, one of the world&#x27;s leading free climbers, took direct action to preserve the rock. He stopped carrying any pitons, not only on established climbs but also on his trailblazing First Ascents. To encourage others to follow, he put a logbook in the climbing shop, Rock and Snow, in New Paltz, NY, where any climber could receive credit for a &quot;First All-Nut Ascent&quot; in the Gunks. Then, in October, he published &quot;The Eastern Trade,&quot; a quarterly newsletter &quot;for the preservation of climbing areas&quot;. In it, he envisioned a pitonless climbing future in the USA and coined the term &quot;clean climbing&quot;. Within a year, most East Coast free climbers had converted.

The same year, another well-known Yosemite climber, Yvon Chouinard, began to commercially manufacture a carefully-calibrated line of metal chocks, or nuts, in California. Another important milestone occurred with the &quot;1972 Chouinard Equipment Catalog&quot;, which included two articles on environmental concerns and climbing gear. One was written by Chouinard and Tom Frost; another was the beautiful ode by Doug Robinson titled &quot;The Whole Natural Art of Protection&quot;. Around this time, Bill Forrest also produced a somewhat less successful range of passive chocks, more successful were his experiments with camming which went on to become the first Lowe Alpine System active camming devices (sometimes jokingly called &quot;crack jumars&quot;).

Many other prominent climbers of the era were influential participants in this early 1970s movement. As a result, within two years, climbers adopted the technique, pitons quickly fell from favor, and the switch to &quot;clean climbing&quot; constituted a landmark change in the sport of rock climbing.

==Conditions today==
Piton scars from an earlier era are still widely visible. Today, on a relative handful of long-established climbing routes in a few places, these old scars enable the use of clean hardware. Such hardware would have been less useful on these particular routes before the rock was altered. Some routes which had been only ascendable on aid &quot;go free&quot; today for the same reason: there are in some places cracks smaller than fingertips which can now be climbed without aid because piton scars provide holds which didn&#x27;t previously exist.

==Values and regulation==
Most rock climbing, both long before and immediately after the development of &quot;clean climbing&quot;, would now be classified as traditional climbing in which protection was installed and removed by each successive party on a given route. However, the term &quot;trad climbing&quot; only arose later, to describe that which is not sport climbing, a comparatively recent activity in which all protective gear is permanently and abundantly fixed on certain routes.

Fixed gear certainly existed in 1970 as it does now. Some contemporary routes, like a number of long, limestone climbs in the Bow Valley, Alberta, are notable for fixed bolts at belay stances and for protection at relatively wide intervals, and thus a kind of hybrid of trad and sport is possible—if supplementary gear can be placed. Perhaps the most extreme example of acceptable non-&quot;clean climbing&quot; is the many via ferrata mountaineering routes, of primarily the Alps.

A relatively small number of climbers believe in varying degrees that fixed gear should never be placed on any route in order to preserve the rock and its inherent challenges. This long-standing cultural question of doctrine is largely separate from issues that gave rise to the term &quot;clean climbing.&quot;

Some climbing areas, notably some of the national parks of the United States, have &quot;de jure&quot; regulations about whether, when and how hammer activity may be employed. For example, drilling is not banned in Yosemite, but power drills are. Other areas have &quot;de facto&quot; local ethics prohibiting certain activity. For example, bolting is not banned in Pinnacles National Park, but the local climbing community does not tolerate rap-bolting — bottom-up route development is expected.

<text>Bertran de Born (; 1140s – by 1215) was a baron from the Limousin in France, and one of the major Occitan troubadours of the 12th-13th century. He composed love songs (cansos) but was better known for his political songs (sirventes). He was involved in revolts against Richard I and then Phillip II. He married twice and had five children. In his final years, he became a monk.

==Early life==
Bertran de Born was the eldest son of Bertran de Born, lord of Hautefort (Occitan: &quot;Autafòrt&quot;), and his wife Ermengardis. He had two younger brothers, Constantine and Itier. His father died in 1178, and Bertran succeeded him as lord of Hautefort. By this time, he was already married to his first wife, Raimonda, and had two sons.

Hautefort lies at the border between the Limousin and Périgord. As a result, Bertran became involved in the conflicts of the sons of Henry II Plantagenet. He was also fighting for control of Hautefort.

According to the feudal custom of his region, he was not the only lord of Hautefort, but held it jointly with his brothers. Other cases of co-seigneuries were known among the troubadours, the most famous being that of the &quot;four troubadours of Ussel&quot;, three brothers and a cousin, and that of Raimon de Miraval and his brothers. Bertran&#x27;s struggle, especially with his brother Constantine, is at the heart of his poetry, which is dominated by political topics.

==Career==

His first datable work is a &quot;sirventes&quot; (political or satirical song) of 1181, but it is clear from this he already had a reputation as a poet. In 1182, he was present at his overlord Henry II of England&#x27;s court at Argentan. That same year, he had joined in Henry the Young King&#x27;s revolt against his younger brother, Richard, Count of Poitou and Duke of Aquitaine. He wrote songs encouraging Aimar V of Limoges and others to rebel, and took the oath against Richard at Limoges. His brother Constantine took the opposing side, and Bertran drove him out of the castle in July.

Henry the Young King, whom Bertran had praised and criticised in his poems, died on campaign in June 1183 in Martel. Bertran wrote a &quot;planh&quot; (lament), in his memory, &quot;Mon chan fenisc ab dol et ab maltraire&quot;. (Another &quot;planh&quot; for Henry, &quot;Si tuit li dol e.l plor e.l marrimen&quot;, formerly attributed to Bertran, is now thought to be the work of Rigaut de Berbezill). In his punitive campaign against the rebels, Richard, aided by Alfonso II of Aragon, besieged Hautefort and gave it to Constantine de Born. Henry II, however, is reported to have been moved by Bertran&#x27;s lament for his son, and returned the castle to the poet. Constantine seems to have become a mercenary.

Bertran was reconciled also with Richard, whom he supported in turn against Philip II of France. At various times, he sought to exploit the dissensions among the Angevins in order to keep his independence. He gave them &quot;senhals&quot; (nicknames): Henry the Young King was &quot;Mariniers&quot; (&quot;Sailor&quot;), Geoffrey of Brittany was &quot;Rassa&quot;, and Richard, &quot;Oc-e-Non&quot; (&quot;Yes-and-No&quot;). He commemorated Geoffrey&#x27;s death in the &quot;planh&quot;, &quot;A totz dic que ja mais non voil&quot;. He had contact with a number of other troubadours and also with the Northern French trouvère, Conon de Béthune, whom he addressed as &quot;Mon Ysombart&quot;.

Although he composed a few &quot;cansos&quot; (love songs), Bertran de Born was predominantly a master of the &quot;sirventes&quot;. &quot;Be.m platz lo gais temps de pascor,&quot; which revels in warfare, was translated by Ezra Pound:

When Richard (by then King) and Philip delayed setting out on the Third Crusade, he chided them in songs praising the heroic defence of Tyre by Conrad of Montferrat (&quot;Folheta, vos mi prejatz que eu chan&quot; and &quot;Ara sai eu de pretz quals l&#x27;a plus gran&quot;). When Richard was released from captivity after being suspected of Conrad&#x27;s murder, Bertran welcomed his return with &quot;Ar ven la coindeta sazos&quot;. Ironically, one of Bertran&#x27;s sources of income was from the market of Châlus-Cabrol, where Richard was fatally wounded in 1199.

==Later years and death==
Widowed for the second time c. 1196, Bertran became a monk and entered the Cistercian abbey of Dalon at Sainte-Trie in the Dordogne region. He had made numerous grants to the abbey over the years. His last datable song was written in 1198. He ceases to appear in charters after 1202, and was certainly dead by 1215, when there is a record of a payment for a candle for his tomb.

==Works==
His œuvre consists of about 47 works, 36 unambiguously attributed to him in the manuscripts, and 11 uncertain attributions. Several melodies survive, and some of his songs have been recorded by Sequentia, Gérard zucchetto and his Troubadours Art Ensemble, and the Martin Best Mediæval Ensemble, who released an album of songs by &quot;Dante Troubadours&quot;.

NSBM band М8Л8ТХ,in collaboration with Famine (K.P.N),released the 2015 EP &quot;Coup de Grâce&quot; (Russian: Удар Милосердия) in his honor.

==Family==
Bertran de Born married twice. By his first wife, Raimonda, he had two sons (both knighted in 1192) and a daughter:
*Bertran, also a troubadour, still living in 1223.
*Itier, who died in 1237.
*Aimelina, who married Seguin de Lastours.
By his second wife, Philippa, he had two more sons:
*Constantine, who became a monk at Dalon with his father.
*Bertran the Younger, who was still living in 1252.

==Later literary image==
According to his later &quot;vida&quot; (a romanticised short biography attached to his songs), Henry II believed Bertran had fomented the rebellion of his son Henry the Young King. As a result, Dante Alighieri portrayed him in the &quot;Inferno&quot; as a sower of schism, punished in the ninth bolgia of the eighth circle of Hell (Canto XXVIII), carrying his severed head like a lantern. Gustave Doré depicts this in his illustrations to the &quot;Divine Comedy.&quot;

Dante&#x27;s depiction of him influenced later literary works. In her epic poem &quot;Cœur de Lion&quot; (1822), Eleanor Anne Porden portrays him fomenting discord in the Third Crusade and, because of his remorse over his involvement with Richard&#x27;s imprisonment, becoming a hermit. He also figures as a minor character in Maurice Hewlett&#x27;s novel &quot;The Life and Death of Richard Yea-and-Nay&quot; (1900), depicted unflatteringly. He is described as &quot;a man of hot blood, fumes and rages&quot;, with &quot;a grudging spirit&quot;. One character dismisses him thus: &quot;Great poet he was, great thief, and a silly fool.&quot;

His memory was better served by Ezra Pound, who translated some of his songs and also based several original poems around him and his works, notably &quot;Na Audiart&quot; (1908), &quot;Sestina: Altaforte&quot; (1909), and &quot;Near Périgord&quot; (1915). There are also allusions to him in some of the &quot;Cantos&quot;. Via the influence of Pound&#x27;s &quot;Na Audiart&quot;, he is also mentioned in Sorley MacLean&#x27;s poem, &quot;A&#x27; Bhuaile Ghreine&quot; (&quot;The Sunny Fold&quot;).

He was the subject of a 1936 play &quot;Bertran de Born&quot; by Jean Valmy-Baisse, to which Darius Milhaud wrote incidental music. He later reworked the music into his &quot;Suite provençale&quot;.

Paul Auster mentions De Born in his novel &quot;Invisible&quot; (2009), where the main character meets a Frenchman named Born, and corrects a translation of one of Bertran&#x27;s war poems. This appeared before as a translation by Paul Auster, in &quot;The Nation.&quot;

<doc id="782607" wikidata="Q280898" url="?curid=782607" title="The Dark Tower (series)">
<text>The Dark Tower is a series of eight novels, one novella, and a children&#x27;s book written by American author Stephen King. Incorporating themes from multiple genres, including dark fantasy, science fantasy, horror, and Western, it describes a &quot;gunslinger&quot; and his quest toward a tower, the nature of which is both physical and metaphorical. The series, and its use of the Dark Tower, expands upon Stephen King&#x27;s multiverse and in doing so, links together many of his other novels.

In addition to the eight novels of the series proper that comprise 4,250 pages, many of King&#x27;s other books relate to the story, introducing concepts and characters that come into play as the series progresses.

The series was chiefly inspired by the poem &quot;Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came&quot; by Robert Browning, the full text of which was included in the final volume&#x27;s appendix. In the preface to the revised 2003 edition of &quot;The Gunslinger&quot;, King also identifies &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Arthurian legend, and &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; as inspirations. He identifies Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;Man with No Name&quot; character as one of the major inspirations for the protagonist, Roland Deschain. King&#x27;s style of location names in the series, such as Mid-World, and his development of a unique language (High Speech), are also influenced by J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s work.

A film serving as a sequel to the events of &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; was released in August 2017.

Stephen King saw &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; series as a first draft, initially planning to rewrite it. However, after revising &quot;The Gunslinger&quot;, &quot;he is trying to decide how much he can rewrite.&quot;

The series is referred to on King&#x27;s website as his &quot;magnum opus&quot;.

==Overview==

===Plot summary===
In the story, Roland Deschain is a member of a knightly order known as &quot;gunslingers&quot; and the last of the line of &quot;Arthur Eld&quot;, his world&#x27;s analogue of King Arthur. Politically organized along the lines of a feudal society, it shares technological and social characteristics with the American Old West but is also magical. Many of the magical aspects have vanished from Mid-World but traces remain, as do relics from a technologically advanced society. Roland&#x27;s quest is to find the Dark Tower, a fabled building said to be the nexus of all universes. Roland&#x27;s world is said to have &quot;moved on&quot;, and it appears to be coming apart at the seams. Mighty nations have been torn apart by war, entire cities and regions vanish without a trace and time does not flow in an orderly fashion. Sometimes, even the sun rises in the north and sets in the east. As the series opens, Roland&#x27;s motives, goals, and age are unclear, although later installments shed light on these mysteries.

For a detailed synopsis of the novels, see the relevant article for each book.

====Connections to King&#x27;s other works====
The series has become a linchpin that is interwoven with, and ties together, much of King&#x27;s body of work. The worlds of &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; are in part composed of locations, characters, events and other various elements from many of King&#x27;s novels and short stories. Some of the principal books that are tied to this series, or that this series references, include &quot;It&quot;, &quot;The Stand&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;, &quot;Insomnia&quot;, &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Black House&quot;, &quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&quot;, &quot;The Shining&quot;, and &quot;Cell&quot;. The TV miniseries &quot;Kingdom Hospital&quot; takes place in a world in which Nozz-A-La is the most popular beverage in the world, possibly meaning those events take place in the same universe as books 4 and 5 are set.

===Characters===

Along his journey to the Dark Tower, Roland meets a great number of friends and enemies. For most of the way, he is accompanied by a group of people who, together with him, form the Ka-tet of the Nineteen and Ninety-nine, consisting of Jake Chambers, Eddie Dean, Susannah Dean, and Oy. Among his many enemies on the way are The Man in Black, Mordred, and The Crimson King.

===Language===
King created a language for his characters, known as the High Speech. Examples of this language include the phrases &quot;Thankee, Sai&quot; (&quot;Thank you, Sir/Ma&#x27;am.&quot;) and &quot;Dan-Tete&quot; (&quot;Little Savior&quot;). In addition, King uses the term &quot;Ka&quot;, which is the approximate equivalent of destiny, or fate, in the fictional language High Speech (and similarly, &quot;Ka-tet,&quot; a group of people bound together by fate/destiny). This term originated in Egyptian mythology and storytelling, and has figured in several other novels and screenplays since 1976. The term also appears in King&#x27;s short story, &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot;, in which Ted describes its meaning to Bobby.

===Continuation===
While the series was declared finished with the publication of the seventh volume in 2004, Stephen King described in an interview in March 2009 an idea for a new short story he&#x27;d recently had: &quot;And then I thought, &#x27;Well, why don&#x27;t I find three more like this and do a book that would be almost like modern fairy tales?&#x27; Then this thing started to add on bits and pieces so I guess it will be a novel.&quot; According to King, the idea was a new &quot;Dark Tower&quot; novel.

King said, regarding &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s not really done yet. Those seven books are really sections of one long über-novel.&quot; King confirmed this during his TimesTalk event at The Times Center in New York City on November 10, 2009, and the next day King&#x27;s official site posted that King would begin working on this novel in about eight months, with a tentative title being &quot;The Wind Through the Keyhole&quot;. King noted that this novel would likely be set between the fourth and the fifth books of the series. The book, titled &quot;The Dark Tower: The Wind Through the Keyhole&quot;, was announced on Stephen King&#x27;s official site on March 10, 2011, and was published on April 24, 2012.

===Illustrations===
Each book in the series was originally published in hardcover format with a number of full-color illustrations spread throughout. Each book contained works by a single illustrator only. Subsequent printings of each book in trade paperback format usually preserve the illustrations in full, except for books I and IV. Pocket-sized paperback reprints contain only black-and-white chapter or section header illustrations.

The illustrators who worked on each book are:
==Reception==
Bill Sheehan of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the series &quot;a humane, visionary epic and a true magnum opus&quot; that stands as an &quot;imposing example of pure storytelling,&quot; &quot;filled with brilliantly rendered set pieces... cataclysmic encounters and moments of desolating tragedy.&quot; Erica Noonan of the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; said, &quot;There&#x27;s a fascinating world to be discovered in the series&quot; but noted that its epic nature keeps it from being user-friendly. Allen Johnston of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was disappointed with how the series progressed; while he marveled at the &quot;sheer absurdity of [the books&#x27;] existence&quot; and complimented King&#x27;s writing style, he said preparation would have improved the series, stating &quot;King doesn&#x27;t have the writerly finesse for these sorts of games, and the voices let him down.&quot; Michael Berry of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, however, called the series&#x27; early installments &quot;highfalutin hodgepodge&quot; but the ending &quot;a valediction&quot; that &quot;more than delivers on what has been promised.&quot; Joshua Rothman of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; praised the series, feeling that &quot;the novels were better and weirder than [he&#x27;d] hoped.&quot; Because it features several of his classic tropes, Rothman claimed, &quot;If you really like Stephen King, you owe it to yourself to give the series a shot.&quot;

== Other media ==

===Tie-in books===
The series has prompted related non-fiction books by authors besides King. Robin Furth has published the two-volume &quot;Stephen King&#x27;s The Dark Tower: A Concordance&quot;, an encyclopedia-style companion to the series that she originally wrote for King&#x27;s personal use. Bev Vincent has published &quot;The Road to The Dark Tower: Exploring Stephen King&#x27;s Magnum Opus&quot;, a book containing back story, summary and analysis and &quot;The Dark Tower Companion&quot;, which includes interviews and coverage of the Marvel graphic novels. Stephen King has endorsed these books.

&quot;Charlie the Choo-Choo&quot; is a &quot;children&#x27;s book&quot; by Stephen King released in 2016, published under the pseudonym Beryl Evans. It is adapted from a section of King&#x27;s previous novel &quot;The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands&quot;. It was illustrated by Ned Dameron.

=== Comics ===
Several &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series arcs were published by Marvel Comics.

A prequel, &quot;The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger Born&quot; is plotted by Robin Furth, scripted by Peter David, and illustrated by Jae Lee and Richard Isanove, and is set around the time of the flashbacks in &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; and &quot;Wizard and Glass&quot;.

=== Games ===
December 7, 2009 saw the release of a spin-off online game titled &quot;Discordia&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephenking.com/discordia&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; available to play free of charge on the official Stephen King website. The game is a continuation of the original &quot;Dark Tower&quot; story, following the war between the Tet Corporation and Sombra/NCP in New York, and it has been supervised by both Stephen King and Robin Furth. From the website: &quot;Exploring the behind-the-scenes conflict between the two companies, &quot;Discordia&quot; introduces long-time &quot;Dark Tower&quot; fans to new characters and numerous mechanical/magical items developed by Mid-World&#x27;s Old Ones. Over the course of our adventure we will visit many locations, both those familiar to &quot;Dark Tower&quot; fans and others which we only glimpsed in the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; novels. While we may not see Roland and his ka-tet in this adventure, the development team has remembered the faces of its fathers. We have done our best to honor the original &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series while simultaneously mapping new and exciting &quot;Dark Tower&quot; territory.&quot;

=== Film ===

Sony Pictures and Media Rights Capital adapted the series for film. The film is directed by Nikolaj Arcel, and stars Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey, cast respectively as Roland Deschain and Walter O&#x27;Dim. The film was released on August 4, 2017. Critics panned the film with it receiving a score of 16% on Rotten Tomatoes. The film combines elements from several novels in &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; series, serving as a canonical sequel to the novel series. Stephen King has indicated that &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; film and television series will follow Roland&#x27;s &quot;last time round&quot; to the titular Dark Tower. In July 2016, director Nikolaj Arcel confirmed that &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; film would be a sequel to the novels as well as a direct adaptation, with Roland in the next cycle of his journey to the Tower.

In a 2017 interview with Collider, Stephen King expressed hope for a sequel film in addition to the upcoming television series, suggesting that it should be R-rated, with Roland wearing a hat, and that it would include the &quot;lobstrosities&quot; from &quot;The Drawing of the Three&quot;. In an interview with ComingSoon.net, Nikolaj Arcel confirmed that &quot;The Drawing of the Three&quot; would form the basis for the sequel, and that yet-to-be-cast actors who will play Eddie and Susannah Dean would appear alongside Elba, McConaughey, Taylor, and Haley reprising their roles as Roland, Walter, Jake and Sayre respectively.

=== Television ===
In February 2018, Amazon bought the rights to &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; books for a series adaptation, though it was not made clear at first if anyone from the film would be involved. It was later confirmed that the series would serve as a reboot, with Sam Strike and Jasper Pääkkönen being cast as Roland Deschain and The Man in Black, respectively. In June 2019, Michael Rooker, Jerome Flynn and Joana Ribeiro were also believed to be cast members. In January 2020, Amazon decided not to move forward with the pilot, but production company MRC is shopping the pilot scripts elsewhere. In December 2022, director Mike Flanagan announced that he had acquired the rights to develop a television series based on the books and has plans for a multi-season release.

=== Audiobooks ===

Currently there exist five audio versions of The Dark Tower series – in English, Polish, German, French and Russian. The audio book in English published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton features voices of George Guidall and Frank Muller and has neither music nor sound effects. The audio book in German published by Deutschland Random House Audio introduces Vittorio Alfieri and David Nathan as the narrators. The French audiobooks are published by Éditions Gallimard and narrated by Jacques Frantz.
In Russian, &quot;The Gunslinger&quot;, as narrated by Igor Knyazev, does not have any music or sound effects

The first two novels in the series, The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger and The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three, were produced on audio cassette by New Audio Library (NAL) in 1988 and 1989 respectively. The Waste Lands, The Dark Tower Part III, was produced on audio cassette by Penguin Highbridge Audio in 1991. Each of these early editions was narrated by the author. The Waste Lands includes musical accompaniment throughout.

All of these editions were subsequently re-recorded in 1997 with Frank Muller as the narrator for continuity. Muller narrates the fourth book in the series, The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass. Stephen King selected Muller as his voice for all audio narrations at this time. Frank Muller suffered a catastrophic brain injury in a motorcycle accident in 2001. The narration task then fell to George Guidall, who recorded the final three books in the series in quick succession in 2003 and 2004. George Guidall was also called upon to re-record The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger, the first book in the series, in 2003, as the author made significant changes to that story to better match what came later.

<text>Dark Tower is a 1981 electronic board game, by Milton Bradley Company, for one to four players. The object of the game is to amass an army, collect the three keys to the Tower, and defeat the evil within. Advertising for the game included a television commercial featuring Orson Welles. 

A sequel, &quot;Return to Dark Tower&quot;, was developed by Restoration Games and released in 2022.

==Components==
The game includes:

* 1 electronic center unit (the eponymous Dark Tower, powered by two &quot;D&quot;-size (LR20) batteries)
* 1 circular cardboard game board, divided into four &quot;kingdom&quot; quadrants
** 16 plastic buildings for the game board (bazaar, ruin, sanctuary, tomb)
** Plastic structural pieces to hold the game board together
* 4 plastic warrior pawns
* 1 plastic dragon pawn
* 4 cardboard Pegasus tokens
* Additional game items, including
** 12 plastic key pieces (gold, silver, brass)
** 5 plastic flags (Arisilon, Brynthia, Durnin, Zenon, and the Dark Tower)
* 4 cardboard peg boards used to keep track of a player&#x27;s number of troops, gold and food
** 42 red plastic &quot;Battleship&quot;-type score pegs
===Dark Tower===
The Tower itself consists of a small membrane keyboard beneath a &quot;display&quot; (a piece of tinted plastic). Behind the display cover is a carousel containing a number of film cels, which, when backlit by one of three lights mounted underneath, display the appropriate picture on the display cover. The display cover also conceals a digital LED display for representing numbers up to 99. As the Tower rotates and illuminates the appropriate cels during gameplay, it also emits sounds for the events represented by each cel.

===Game board and pieces===

The artwork for the game, including the cels in the Tower, was drawn by Bob Pepper.

The circular game board is divided into four quadrants, each corresponding to one of the four kingdoms, with the Dark Tower in the center. Each kingdom quadrant is divided into spaces, four of which are labeled for a building; the innermost (closest to the center) space is labeled as the Dark Tower, and the outermost ring of spaces includes a space for the citadel for that kingdom, which is where the kingdom&#x27;s flag is placed and where the player pawn starts.

The sixteen buildings are divided into four sets (distinguished by color) of four buildings each: ruin, bazaar, tomb, and sanctuary. The twelve keys are divided by color into four gold keys, four silver keys, and four brass keys. Each flag corresponds to one of the four kingdoms (Arisilon, Brynthia, Durnin, and Zenon) and the Dark Tower itself. During the initial assembly of the game, the buildings are placed into the labeled spaces on the board, and stickers are peeled off a sheet and placed on the keys and flags.
==Gameplay==

===Starting items===
To start, each player receives a cardboard score chart and ten pegs; they use six of the pegs to track their party, starting with 10 warriors, 30 gold, and 25 food rations. The four extra pegs are used to keep track of the extra items (scout, beast, healer, or sword) once they are acquired; keys are placed directly in the appropriate score chart slots as they are acquired. Each player selects a pawn and places it in the citadel of their &quot;home&quot; kingdom. There are four different levels that can be selected on the Tower, which changes the number of Brigands defending the Tower. With L1 the computer selects 17 to 32 Brigands to defend the Tower, L2 selects 33 to 64, and L3 selects 17 to 64. L4 is a special tutorial mode for a single player which has 16 Brigands in the Tower and skips directly to the end game, granting the player all three keys immediately.

===Turns===
The basic structure of each turn is:
# The digital display shows a flashing number, indicating that player&#x27;s turn. For example, a blinking &quot;2&quot; indicates it is Player 2&#x27;s turn.
# The player moves their token one space, or leaves it in the space from which they started.
# Press the appropriate blue button on the Tower panel to indicate the type of space they currently occupy.
# The Tower presents an event by audible signal, accompanied in many instances by rotating the internal carousel and illuminating the appropriate cel for a visual signal, along with a number on the digital display, if appropriate. The Tower then resolves the event.
# The digital display shows a flashing negative number (e.g., &quot;-2&quot;), indicating that player should press the No / End button to end their turn.

Each player takes turns rotating the Tower to face them and then moving their chosen hero about the board anticlockwise, moving up to one space per turn, as a player may choose to remain in the same space during their turn. More than one player may occupy the same space simultaneously. The quarter of the board in front of a player is their kingdom. Each kingdom quadrant is separated by a &quot;frontier&quot; space; when moving into a new kingdom from the frontier, players may choose to move into any space adjacent to the frontier.

===Events===
After the player moves their token one space, they then press a button on the Tower that corresponds to the type of space (e.g., Sanctuary, Tomb, Bazaar, Frontier, free/unoccupied space and ultimately onto the Dark Tower space). Depending on the space the player has entered (or where they remain), there are several different possible events. The Tower resolves what happens to the player by showing the appropriate cel and reporting whatever occurs. For instance, if the Tower decides that the player has encountered Brigands, it will illuminate the Brigands cel, simultaneously displaying the number of brigands encountered. The Tower resolves the battle by alternately counting off the remaining numbers of friendly troops and Brigands down to a win or loss. Once all events have resolved, the Tower is rotated to the next player and their turn begins.

In addition to the common safe entry and battle events, there are several potential harmful events that could occur to a player entering one of the standard spaces (i.e., when pressing the &quot;Move&quot; button):
===Battle rewards===
When the player wins a battle, they may be awarded one or more treasures. Treasure(s) also can be awarded without battle when entering a ruin or tomb.
===Supplies from the Bazaar===
In the Bazaar, players may purchase items, including warriors, consumable food, and durable bonuses. Warriors are needed for battle and to carry the player&#x27;s gold, up to six gold per warrior. One food ration will feed up to 15 warriors per turn regardless of movement, so when the player has 16–30 warriors, for instance, they will consume two food rations per turn. If the player runs out of food, one warrior will die per turn from starvation.
===Objective===
Each kingdom, besides a player&#x27;s own, contains one of three keys—bronze, silver and gold, acquired in that order—needed to unlock the Tower. The location of the key within that kingdom is randomly determined by the Tower. Each player will therefore need to travel around the board, through each of the other three kingdoms, until the player has all three keys; players are free to move through spaces in other kingdoms except for the foreign citadel. At this point, the player returns to their kingdom, buys reinforcements for a maximum complement of warriors, and then attempts to unlock the Tower by entering a code which requires them to confirm a sequence of keys (bronze, silver, and gold) displayed in the correct order, randomized for each game. Once cracked, this brings them to the final battle to defeat the Tower, which contains a predetermined number of defenders inside, depending on the level selected at the start of the game. The first player to beat the Tower wins the game; losing the battle requires building up another army.

==Development and litigation==
Milton Bradley launched the game in September 1981 at the Magic Castle in Los Angeles. As part of the publicity campaign, Milton Bradley stated the development of &quot;Dark Tower&quot; started in January 1979 and cost the company more than ; the name was finalized in November 1980 after preliminary names including &quot;Venture&quot; and &quot;Hostage&quot; were discarded. Vince Erato, who previously had created the Big Trak toy (1979), was credited with designing the game, inspired by the computer game &quot;Wilderness Campaign&quot; (1979). According to &quot;InfoWorld&quot;, the game uses a TMS-1400 microcontroller with 2 K of memory.

George Ditomassi, the M-B vice president of sales, said it was aimed at &quot;people who had heard about D and D but who didn&#x27;t want to be Dungeons and Dragons freaks.&quot; Shortly after launch, although the game&#x27;s retail price was between US$55 and , Ditomassi noted &quot;it shouldn&#x27;t be selling yet because it&#x27;s too high-priced and there hasn&#x27;t been any advertising&quot;, but added that nevertheless, each Toys &quot;R&quot; Us store was selling an average of one and a half units per week.

Marketing for the game included a television commercial featuring Orson Welles. Despite favorable reviews and reportedly strong sales, production of the game stopped after a single holiday season, and it was targeted by a lawsuit.

Independent inventors Robert Burten and Allen Coleman previously had met with M-B in February 1980 to demonstrate a prototype game they had developed in late 1979 named &quot;Triumph&quot;, which was an adventure game set in space with a round board and a central microprocessor-controlled game unit. Before they were allowed to show the game to M-B, Burten and Coleman were required to sign a waiver of non-disclosure. Erato was present for the demonstration, according to meeting minutes. Afterward, M-B retained the game for a few weeks for further evaluation, then returned it to the inventors, telling them it was not interested in licensing their design. Internally, M-B used a three-tiered review structure, with only 5% of game ideas receiving the scrutiny of top-level executives during a &quot;Presidential Review&quot;; according to internal records, &quot;Triumph&quot; received a Presidential Review on March 20, 1980. At Toy Fair New York in January 1981, Burten and Coleman saw that M-B was exhibiting &quot;Dark Tower&quot; and noted the similarities between the commercial game and their prototype, despite the changed theme: both games used a round board with raised elements and a rotating, computerized tower that provided visual and sound signals.

Burten and Coleman filed a lawsuit for misappropriation of trade secrets. Following the initial trial, a jury awarded them in April 1984, their estimated share of the royalties they had lost based on $22 million in sales. Erato, called as a witness, was said to have cost M-B the case, as he was reported to be &quot;kind of cranky and [...] annoyed that they alleged that he stole the idea.&quot; According to Erato, he had independently conceived the central tower around Christmas 1979, two months before Burten and Coleman met with M-B, but his combative attitude during the trial hindered the believability of his testimony and because he did not keep good records, he was unable to prove this assertion. Michael Gray, a M-B designer who contributed to the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; manual, disputed the commercial game had copied &quot;Triumph&quot;, noting the motorized cel carousel was unique to &quot;Dark Tower&quot;.

Trial judge Bruce M. Selya, however, vacated the jury&#x27;s verdict in August 1984. Despite finding that Milton Bradley had likely &quot;plagiarized the plaintiffs&#x27; idea without so much as a by-your-leave&quot;, Judge Selya proceeded to issue a directed verdict for the defendant because Burton and Coleman had signed a contract waiving any contractual relationship (which arguably included any duty of confidentiality). The First Circuit Court of Appeals reversed in May 1985, finding evidence that Milton Bradley entered an implied agreement to keep the game confidential and reinstated the damage award.

==Reception==
&quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Dark Tower&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1981&quot;, noting especially how the &quot;tower itself swivels so that each player alone views what happens to his own band of warriors&quot;.

In a retrospective review of &quot;Dark Tower&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, Scott Taylor said &quot;as I remembered Dark Tower, and its card game predecessor Dragonmaster, I couldn&#x27;t help but get incredibly nostalgic. There was something truly unique about those games, something almost spiritual, and I can credit this most certainly with the artist who brought them to us, Bob Pepper.&quot;

===Legacy===
Several web-based versions of the game have been developed over the years; an app called &quot;Droid Tower&quot; developed by Muse of Water was available for Android; and a similar app by MacCrafters is available for iOS.

===Sequel===

&quot;Return to Dark Tower&quot; was launched on Kickstarter on January 14, 2020, by Restoration Games as a cooperative game for 1–4 players. Designed by Isaac Childres and Rob Daviau, the creators of &quot;Gloomhaven&quot; and &quot;Pandemic Legacy&quot; respectively, the game features a motorized rotating tower guided by an app.

<text>The Dark Tower is an incomplete manuscript written by C. S. Lewis that appears to be an unfinished sequel to the science fiction novel &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;, though doubts have been raised about its authenticity. &quot;Perelandra&quot; instead became the second book of Lewis&#x27; Space Trilogy, concluded by &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot;. Walter Hooper, Lewis&#x27; literary executor, titled the fragment and published it in the 1977 collection &quot;The Dark Tower and Other Stories&quot;. The Lewis scholar Kathryn Lindskoog challenged the authenticity of the work.

==Plot summaries==

The story deals with an early rendition of interdimensional travel. A fictional Lewis himself narrates, as he does in &quot;Perelandra&quot;, but Elwin Ransom appears as a supporting character. The story begins with a discussion of time travel among several academics at a university (subsequently identified as Cambridge) during summer vacation. They conclude that it is impossible to violate the laws of space-time in such a way. However, after the discussion, one of the men (Orfieu) unveils an invention he believes allows people to see through time. The group uses this &quot;chronoscope&quot; to observe an alien world they call &quot;Othertime&quot; (he does not know if it is future or past), where a group of human automatons work to construct a tower at the bidding of the story&#x27;s villain, the &quot;Unicorn&quot;, a devilish but human (or possibly semi-human) character with a single horn growing out of his forehead. The Unicorn stings people, apparently volunteers, causing them to become automatons (the &quot;Jerkies&quot;).

After a while MacPhee, a character who appears in &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot; (though here he is a Scot, not an Irishman), points out that the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; is in fact a replica of the new Cambridge University Library. This suggests Othertime is the far future, with a replica of an ancient monument being constructed.

It is discovered that Orfieu&#x27;s assistant, Scudamour, has a double in Othertime. Increasingly, the observers wonder if Othertime really is the past or future, or whether it is some other reality. Scudamour&#x27;s double grows a sting and becomes the new Unicorn. During one viewing session, Scudamour sees the Unicorn about to sting the double of his fiancée, Camilla. In a blind fury, he rushes at the screen, and somehow switches bodies with the Unicorn. The remainder of the text deals with his experiences in Othertime, as well as his colleagues&#x27; attempt to hunt down the Unicorn in this world.

In Othertime, Scudamour survives by playing on his authority, his only card, while he tries to learn. He discovers to his amazement that there is a chronoscope in the Unicorn&#x27;s room where he stung victims – but it is now broken. He refrains from stinging Camilla, and tries to plan their escape. It appears there is some sort of war (being waged by the &quot;White Riders&quot;, who want to remove the stingers from the &quot;unicorns&quot;) against the Othertime government. He reads in a library about the Othertimer&#x27;s time-science. A theory is given of multiple timelines; these do not seem to split off from different outcomes, like quantum realities, but simply proceed separately. However, they can be controlled, and contact between them can be made. References are made to the changeling myth. The law is stated that &quot;Any two time-lines approximate to the exact degree to which their material contents are alike,&quot; and it is revealed that an experiment with a replica railway shed in the right place had already been successful in allowing a controlled transfer of minds. The text cuts abruptly with Scudamour still reading.

==Origin==

In his introduction to &quot;The Dark Tower and Other Stories&quot;, Hooper states that he rescued an untitled manuscript in Lewis&#x27; handwriting of the story from a bonfire of the author&#x27;s writings early in 1964, several months after Lewis&#x27; death. The 64-page manuscript appears to have originally had at least 66 pages, two of which are now missing. If the text did at one time continue past the 66th page, these additional pages are also lost. As it stands, the narrative is unfinished: it contains two gaps and comes to an abrupt end.

Hooper surmises, based on the text&#x27;s internal setting, that Lewis wrote it immediately after he finished &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;, in about 1939. Hooper reports that the late Gervase Mathew told him that he heard Lewis read &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; to the Inklings around that time. Anne Paxch posted on the MereLewis list that many who never attended any Inklings meetings heard Lewis read his unpublished works elsewhere, and that she recalls Gervase Mathew and others discussing passages which later appeared in &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;. The Inklings scholar John D. Rateliff suggests that the story could have been written some years later, in about 1946, pointing to a reference in a 1944 letter by Lewis&#x27;s friend J. R. R. Tolkien to a story by Lewis that could be &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;. Rateliff further describes &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; and Tolkien&#x27;s two unfinished time travel novels, &quot;The Lost Road&quot;, begun in 1936–37, and &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot;, begun 1945, as a &quot;triad&quot;. 

Alistair Fowler had clear memories of the &quot;Stinging Man&quot; character in an unfinished manuscript which Lewis showed him in 1952. However, Fowler&#x27;s recollections, not shared until 2003, 51 years after the event, may be imperfect. He reported seeing a manuscript of the Lewis fragment &quot;After Ten Years&quot; on the same occasion, a text which Roger Lancelyn Green thought Lewis did not commence until 1959. Fowler also described Lewis as engrossed in an issue of the magazine &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, which may be inaccurate given that &quot;Astounding&quot; featured what Lewis called &quot;the fiction of Engineers&quot;, for which he &quot;had not the slightest taste&quot;; in the 1950s, Lewis was both a reader of and a contributor to &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;.

==Authenticity and relation to the published novels==

The Lewis scholar Kathryn Lindskoog advanced the theory that &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; and other posthumously published works attributed to Lewis were forgeries written by or at the behest of Walter Hooper, based upon her impressions of their style and questions she raised about their provenance. Lindskoog claimed that &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; resembled stories by other writers, including &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; by Madeleine L&#x27;Engle (1962) and &quot;The Planet of the Dead&quot; by Clark Ashton Smith (1932).

Others accept that the story is by Lewis, as the author&#x27;s estate and the publishers assert by publishing it under his name. The oppressive atmosphere of the book is reminiscent of Lewis&#x27;s own &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot; (1945) and David Lindsay&#x27;s &quot;A Voyage to Arcturus&quot; (1920), which Lewis acknowledged as an influence.

&quot;The Dark Tower&quot; does differ to a degree from the published novels of Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Space Trilogy&quot; in setting and subject matter. For example, Ransom becomes a marginal character, and the action takes place partly in an alternate universe. However, if, as Hooper supposes, the text was written prior to &quot;Perelandra&quot; and &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot;, it would have had no need to maintain consistency with an as yet unwritten series, especially considering that the tone and subject matter of the published series changes markedly between its first and last books.

Margaret Wheatfield noted that &quot;In &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; we see an alternate reality with a dark analogue of Cambridge University, where evil magic is manifest and rampant, and people are made into automatons by the sting of a magical horn. In &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot; evil magic is at work behind the scenes at an ancient English university in our familiar reality, subtly corrupting the faculty by mundane means – manipulation of academic politics, offers of tempting career advances and of lucrative real estate deals. The terrifying deviltry behind it becomes only gradually visible to the reader. At least to this reviewer, it seems entirely plausible to consider the one as an early draft of the other&quot;.

Alastair Fowler, Regius Professor Emeritus of Rhetoric and English Literature at the University of Edinburgh, to whom Lewis served as a doctoral supervisor, wrote in 2003 that he saw portions of &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; including the Stinging Man and discussed them with Lewis in 1952.

Two quantitative stylometric analyses have compared &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; to other books in the Lewis space trilogy. Both analyses have supported the perception that, for whatever reason, the style of &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; is atypical of that employed by Lewis in the trilogy. The first concluded from examination of a portion of &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;″s text that &quot;with respect to the frequency of single letters and particularly letter pairs, &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; fragment represents a different style than the books comprising Lewis&#x27;s deep space trilogy.&quot; The second concluded that &quot;vocabulary usage in &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; differs from that predicted by &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; and &quot;Perelandra&quot;.&quot;

==Suggested developments==

Walter Hooper noted, in his afterword, that Scudamour&#x27;s fiancée is once given the surname Ammeret, and suggests a basis in the characters Sir Scudamour and Amoret in &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, Book III. Amoret was carried off by an enchanter and had to be rescued. Another allusion to note is the probable reference of Orfieu to &quot;Sir Orfeo&quot;, a medieval narrative poem merging the Orpheus myth with the trip to fairyland.

The construction of the tower is clearly important. Lewis&#x27;s time-lines are quite coherent in terms of the science fiction of his generation; it is often forgotten by readers that he was seriously interested in science fiction long before it was fashionable. In terms of the law that &quot;Any two time-lines approximate to the exact degree to which their material contents are alike&quot; the tower is obviously a repeat, on a grand scale, of the Othertimers&#x27; successful but small experiment with a railway shed constructed in the same space as ours. However, although Lewis was a reader of all sorts of science fiction, he himself was not interested in writing the technical side: he wrote in 1955 that &quot;The most superficial appearance of plausibility – the merest sop to our critical intellect – will do. … I took a hero to Mars once in a space-ship, but when I knew better I had angels convey him to Venus&quot;.

How Lewis would have explored the threat from the Othertime world remains unknown. The text mentions an &quot;idol&quot; whose face is, in some way, recognizable to the Cambridge observers, and which is, the narrator says, &quot;still there&quot; at the end of the events to be narrated. How Lewis intended to follow up this foreshadowing is unclear; he may have intended to suggest links to contemporary world events, or may have had no precise idea in mind. The story could be interpreted as the germ of a dystopian novel like &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot;: the Stingingmen and Jerkies could parallel the Conditioners and the Conditioned as described in &quot;The Abolition of Man&quot;. The idol with many bodies and one head may express Lewis&#x27; horror, expressed in many of his works, at the absorption and suppression of the individual into a collective controlled by a single will: in &quot;Perelandra&quot;, referring to a similar loss of individuality, he speculates that &quot;what the Pantheists falsely hoped for in Heaven, the wicked really receive in Hell&quot;.

The president of Finland P. E. Svinhufvud died in Luumäki on February 29, 1944.
The name &quot;Luumäki&quot; means literally &quot;Bone Hill&quot;. In the Finnish version of the comic strip Bone, the place-name &quot;Boneville&quot; is translated as &quot;Luumäki&quot;.

==History==
Luumäki was separated from Lappee as its own parish in 1642. The first church in the Luumäki parish was probably built as soon as the parish became independent. It was destroyed during the Great Wrath (&quot;Isoviha&quot;). The second church, completed in 1731, was damaged during the Lesser Wrath (&quot;Pikkuviha&quot;) and had become small and in poor condition by the turn of the 19th century. The church and the belfry built from 1781 burned down in 1839. The parish had acquired the drawings of the new church even before the fire of the second church, but its construction did not begin until after the fire of the second church due to a dispute over the location. The new church was consecrated in 1845.

<text>Paul Richard Furay (born May 9, 1944) is an American musician and Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame member (with Buffalo Springfield). He is best known for forming the bands Buffalo Springfield with Stephen Stills, Neil Young, Bruce Palmer, and Dewey Martin, and Poco with Jim Messina, Timothy B. Schmit, Rusty Young, George Grantham and Randy Meisner. His best known song (originally written during his tenure in Buffalo Springfield, but eventually performed by Poco as well) was &quot;Kind Woman,&quot; which he wrote for his wife, Nancy.

==Life and career==
Richie Furay was born in Yellow Springs, Ohio. He had an early interest in music, sparked by his father listening to country music. Once rock and roll emerged in the early 1950s, he was smitten. When he was eight years old, he got a guitar and began taking lessons. After a short visit to New York City, he quickly returned for a longer stay, singing in folk clubs. There, he met Stephen Stills.
=== Early career ===

Before joining Buffalo Springfield, Furay performed with Stills in the nine-member group, the Au Go Go Singers (Furay, Roy Michaels, Rick Geiger, Jean Gurney, Michael Scott, Kathy King, Nels Gustafson, Bob Harmelink, and Stills), the house band of the Cafe Au Go Go in New York City.

In the late 1960s, he formed the country rock band Poco with Jim Messina (who produced albums and occasionally played bass for Buffalo Springfield) and Rusty Young. The band, while influential to many future country rock acts, experienced uneven commercial success. Furay&#x27;s best-known songs, &quot;Kind Woman&quot;, &quot;Pickin&#x27; Up The Pieces&quot;, and &quot;Good Feelin&#x27; To Know&quot;, however, have reached classic status and appear on many country rock compilations.

Furay left Poco in 1974 to form the Souther-Hillman-Furay Band. During that time Al Perkins, the band&#x27;s pedal steel guitar player, introduced Furay to Christianity. His newfound faith helped him rebuild his troubled marriage.

Although Souther Hillman Furay Band&#x27;s self-titled first album was certified Gold and yielded the top thirty hit with &quot;Fallin&#x27; in Love&quot; in 1974, the group could not follow up on that success, and poor record sales eventually led to its demise.

After moving from Los Angeles to Sugarloaf Mountain near Boulder, Colorado, Furay formed The Richie Furay Band with Jay Truax, John Mehler, and Tom Stipe, releasing the album &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Reason&quot; in 1976, which reflected Furay&#x27;s newfound beliefs. In support of the release of the album, Furay formed an alliance with David Geffen and Asylum Records. Furay assured Geffen that his album would be Christian influenced but would not be an attempt to preach about his newfound beliefs. &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Reason&quot; did however, establish Furay as a pioneer in Christian rock.

Furay released the 1979 album &quot;I Still Have Dreams&quot; featuring the title cut, which was the only Top 40 hit of his solo career, peaking at #39 for 3 weeks.

Overall, his albums charted unsatisfactorily, and, compounded with the strain of touring wearing on him and his family, he retired as a performer to join the ministry. In 1983, Furay became senior pastor of the Calvary Chapel in Broomfield, Colorado, a non-sectarian Christian church in the Denver area.

In 1989, Furay reunited with Poco to release an album entitled &quot;Legacy&quot;.

=== Later career ===
In 2006 he released his album &quot;The Heartbeat of Love&quot;, and also toured as an opening act for America and Linda Ronstadt. In 2007, he toured with a new formation of the Richie Furay Band. At the Boulder and Bluebird Theatres in Colorado, they recorded a double live album &quot;ALIVE&quot;. The &quot;ALIVE&quot; set covers 29 songs of Furay&#x27;s career. The Richie Furay band continued to tour through 2008 and 2009.

Furay appeared with Poco for several shows in early 2009. At the Stagecoach Festival in Indio, California in 2009, Furay and the current Poco lineup were joined onstage by original members Jim Messina and George Grantham and former bass player Timothy B. Schmit.

On October 23, 2010, he reunited with former Buffalo Springfield bandmates Stephen Stills and Neil Young for a set at the 24th annual Bridge School Benefit at Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California. The reunion continued in 2011 for a one-month tour of California, headlining 2011 Bonnaroo. In July 2011, Furay announced on his Facebook page that he would be touring with Buffalo Springfield in early 2012, ending speculation there would be a 2011 fall tour with them. In 2011, Furay collaborated with the Piedmont Brothers Band as an occasional back-up vocalist on the album &quot;PBB III&quot; (2011). He appeared on the 2013 Carla Olson album, &quot;Have Harmony, Will Travel&quot;. In 2015, he released the new album &quot;Hand in Hand&quot; to positive critical reviews.

Furay retired as Pastor of Calvary Chapel in December 2017.

On June 13, 2018, the Richie Furay Band began the Deliverin&#x27; Tour at the South Orange Performing Arts Center (SOPAC) in New Jersey. The first set consisted of Buffalo Springfield, Poco, Souther, Hillman &amp; Furay Band and solo material, followed by a second set with the classic 1971 Poco live album &quot;DeLIVErin&#x27;&quot; being performed in its entirety. A single, “I Guess You Made It”, was released on Furay&#x27;s website (richiefuray.com).

The tour continued throughout the year, culminating with a Poco 50th Anniversary Celebration on November 16, 2018, at the Troubadour in Los Angeles, where Poco first performed in 1969. Randy Meisner and Peter Asher were in the audience (Poco bandmate and longtime friend, Timothy B. Schmit performed with Furay.) Furay&#x27;s Troubadour show was recorded and, in April, 2021, was released in both CD and DVD as &quot;DeLIVErin&#x27; Again (50th Anniversary: Return to the Troubadour)&quot;. In the same year, Furay released the single, &quot;America, America&quot; through his website.

=== Recent years ===
In mid-2019, Furay announced he would be retiring from touring as a headliner. He embarked on a tour of the west coast in the fall of 2019, sharing the bill with Dave Mason. Furay&#x27;s “Farewell/76th Birthday Celebration” was originally scheduled to take place at the South Orange Performing Arts Center (SOPAC) in New Jersey in 2020, however due to the COVID-19 pandemic and storm damage to the SOPAC building, the show was postponed until 2022, so he performed a &quot;Farewell Show&quot; at Drew University in Madison, New Jersey on November 14, 2021 (the date of the originally scheduled SOPAC show.) He scheduled a few one-off shows in Colorado and California in the spring of 2022, with the SOPAC &quot;Farewell Show&quot; rescheduled for June 2022 at SOPAC, under the direction of his manager, David Stone. He included &quot;Crazy Love&quot; and &quot;Bad Weather&quot; in the shows, as a tribute to Poco bandmates Rusty Young and Paul Cotton, respectively; they both died in 2021.

In June and July 2022, Furay kicked off a mini-tour, beginning in New Jersey, as well as the City Winery in Nashville, New York City, Washington DC, Philadelphia, and Boston. The shows were billed as Furay&#x27;s farewell tour in support of his album &quot;In the Country&quot; which has cover versions of Furay&#x27;s favorite country songs. &quot;In the Country&quot; features a cover of Keith Urban&#x27;s &quot;Someone Like You&quot;, released as a single. The recording also contains songs by John Denver, Garth Brooks, George Strait, Marc Cohn, and Ricky Nelson, as well as a remake of the Poco song &quot;Pickin&#x27; Up the Pieces&quot;.

A documentary, &quot;Through It All: The Life and Influence of Richie Furay&quot; is currently in post-production. It is narrated by Cameron Crowe. In a 7/18/2024 radio interview with Daniel Jones (guitarist with 7th Order) on his &quot;The Volcano Chronicles&quot; radio show (KNKR 96.1FM on the Big Island of Hawaii) – Furay stated that the documentary may be released as soon as early 2025.

<doc id="782653" wikidata="Q1291830" url="?curid=782653" title="Treen">
<text>Treen (literally &quot;of a tree&quot;) is a generic name for small handmade functional household objects made of wood. Treen is distinct from furniture, such as chairs, and cabinetry, as well as clocks and cupboards. Before the late 17th century, when silver, pewter, and ceramics were introduced for tableware, most small household items, boxes and tableware were carved from wood. Today, treen is highly collectable for its patina and tactile appeal.

Anything from wooden plates and bowls, snuff boxes and needle cases, spoons and stay busks to shoehorns and chopping boards can be classed as treen. Domestic and agricultural wooden tools are also usually classed with treen.

Before the advent of cheap metal wares in industrialized societies, and later plastic, wood played a much greater part as the raw material for common objects. Turning and carving were the key manufacturing techniques. The selection of wood species was important, and close-grained hardwoods such as box, beech and sycamore were particularly favoured, with occasional use of exotics, such as lignum vitae for mallet heads.

Wooden objects have survived relatively less well than those of metal or stone, and their study by archaeologists and historians has been somewhat neglected until recently. Their functional and undecorated forms have, however, been highly regarded by designers and collectors.

== Burl treen ==
In North America, Native Americans carved tree burls into durable wooden objects with uniquely marbled grain. Burls were rare in Europe because the old-growth forests where they are commonly found had largely been logged out of existence. Burl treen was found in Europe occasionally, particularly in objects intended for celebration or the upper class, but was not in wide-scale use.

In contrast, burls were widely available in the virgin forests of North America. Native Americans worked these burls into domestic objects like bowls and ladles with tools such as stone blades, hot coals, and beaver teeth. Native Americans traded these wooden items with European colonists, who later learned to harvest burl and carve them into treen in the style of their home countries. Burl treen is considered an indigenous North American craft, and examples are found in museums and private collections of Americana.

The snarled and interlaced grain of a burl makes the resulting objects stronger and less likely to split. They were strong enough to be passed down over generations. A variety of trees produce burls, but almost all North American burl treen (upwards of ninety percent) is made from black ash. Another five percent is made from maple, with other woods such as cherry wood, white cedar, oak, and birch making up the remainder. Woodworker Michael Combs has speculated that black ash burl was favored because it is easy to work on a lathe.
