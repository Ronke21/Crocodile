<text>Jared Sparks (May 10, 1789 – March 14, 1866) was an American historian, educator, and Unitarian minister. He served as President of Harvard College from 1849 to 1853.

==Biography==

Born in Willington, Connecticut, Sparks studied in the common schools, worked for a time at the carpenter&#x27;s trade, and then became a schoolteacher. In 1809–1811, he attended the Phillips Exeter Academy, where he met John G. Palfrey, who became a lifelong friend.
He graduated from Harvard College, (now Harvard University), with an A.B. in 1815, and an A.M. in 1818. While an undergraduate, Sparks was a member of the Hasty Pudding. In 1812, he served as a tutor to the children of a family in Havre de Grace, Maryland. A few years later he taught in a private school at Lancaster, Massachusetts during 1815–1817. Sparks also studied theology and was college tutor in mathematics and natural philosophy at Harvard College in 1817–1819. In 1817–1818 he was acting editor of the &quot;North American Review&quot;.

He was the first pastor of the newly organized &quot;First Independent Church of Baltimore&quot;, serving from 1819 to 1823. It occupied what became a landmark structure at West Franklin and North Charles streets. It later was known as the First Unitarian Church of Baltimore (Unitarian and Universalist) after a 1935 merger with the Second Universalist Church at Guilford Avenue and East Lanvale Street.

At Sparks&#x27; ordination by Dr. William Ellery Channing (1780-1842), of the Federal Street Church in Boston, Massachusetts, Channing delivered his discourse on Unitarian Christianity. This later was known as &quot;The Baltimore Sermon&quot;. It set out the tenets and some principles for the developing theology and philosophy of Unitarianism. By 1825, these principles led to the founding of the American Unitarian Association. (In 1961 a merger between two groups resulted in the modern Unitarian Universalist Association of America.)

During this period, Sparks founded the &quot;Unitarian Miscellany&quot; and &quot;Christian Monitor&quot; (1821), a monthly, and edited its first three volumes. He served as chaplain of the United States House of Representatives from 1821 to 1823; and he contributed to the &quot;National Intelligencer&quot; and other periodicals.

In 1823, his health failed and Sparks withdrew from the ministry. Removing to Boston, he bought and edited in 1824–1830 the &quot;North American Review&quot;, contributing about 50 articles to it. He founded and edited in 1830, the &quot;American Almanac and Repository of Useful Knowledge&quot;, which was continued by others and long remained a popular annual.

In 1825 Sparks was elected as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in 1827 as a member of the American Antiquarian Society. He later served two decades as the society&#x27;s secretary for foreign correspondence, from 1846 to 1866.

After extensive researches at home and in London and Paris in 1828–1829, he published &quot;The Writings of George Washington&quot; (12 volumes, 1834–1837; redated 1842), his most important work. In 1839 he published separately his &quot;Life of George Washington&quot; (abridged, 2 volumes, 1842). The work was for the most part favorably received, but Sparks was severely criticized by Lord Mahon (in the sixth volume of his &quot;History of England&quot;) and others for altering the text of some of Washington&#x27;s writings.

Sparks defended his methods in &quot;A Reply to the Strictures of Lord Mahon and Others&quot; (1852). The charges were not wholly justifiable, and later Lord Mahon (Stanhope) modified them.

While continuing his studies abroad in 1840–1841, Sparks discovered in the French archives the red-line map that, in 1842 gained international prominence in connection with the dispute over the north-eastern U.S.-Canadian boundary. Conflict had resulted in the Aroostook War between the state of Maine in the United States and the Province of New Brunswick in Canada.

===Professorship===
Sparks was one of the American intellectuals who received French author and traveler Alexis de Tocqueville during his 1831–1832 visit to the United States. Their extensive conversations and subsequent correspondence informed de Tocqueville&#x27;s best-known work, &quot;Democracy in America&quot;.

In 1837, Sparks was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

In 1842 Sparks delivered 12 lectures on American history before the Lowell Institute in Boston. In 1838–1849 he was the first McLean Professor of Ancient and Modern History at Harvard, endowed by the will of wealthy merchant John McLean (1761-1823). His appointment to this position, says his biographer, was the first academic encouragement of American history, and of original historical research in the American field.

He was appointed in 1849 as president of Harvard College, and moved into a home on campus now called Treadwell-Sparks House. In 1853 Sparks retired on account of failing health, and devoted the rest of his life to his private studies. For several years he was a member of the Massachusetts Commonwealth Board of Education.

===Death===

Jared Sparks died on March 14, 1866, in Cambridge, Massachusetts and was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery. His valuable collection of manuscripts and papers went to Harvard University. His private library and his maps were bought by Cornell University. He was a pioneer in large-scale collecting of documentary material on American history. He rendered valuable services to historical scholarship in the United States.

Benedict Arnold, explorer Jacques Marquette, explorer René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, Kazimierz Pulaski (&quot;Count Pulaski&quot;), Jean Ribault, Gen. Charles Lee and John Ledyard, the last a reprint of his earlier work.

In addition, he aided Henry D. Gilpin in preparing an edition of the &quot;Papers of James Madison&quot; (1840), and brought out an American edition of William Smyth&#x27;s &quot;Lectures on Modern History&quot; (2 volumes, 1841), which did much to stimulate historical study in the United States.

==Memorials==

Historian Francis Parkman dedicated his &quot;The Conspiracy of Pontiac&quot; (1851) to Sparks.

Memorial plaques and historical displays with portraits of Channing, Sparks and others are shown in the historical exhibit area of the First Unitarian Church of Baltimore (Unitarian and Universalist). The congregation commemorates the annual anniversary of &quot;The Baltimore Sermon&quot; of May 5, 1819, on the first Sunday in May. Their &quot;Union Sunday&quot; features a sermon/homily/address by an invited speaker; it is attended by the ministers and members of the Unitarian churches in Maryland, along with other visiting ecumenical members of other local Christian churches, and interested lay people.

<text>Pudasjärvi () is a town and a municipality of Finland. It is located in the province of Oulu and is part of the Northern Ostrobothnia region, northeast of the city of Oulu and southwest of the town of Kuusamo. The town has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is . In terms of area in square kilometres, Pudasjärvi is the second largest township in Finland (as of 2006, Rovaniemi is the largest) and one of the largest in the world. It&#x27;s also one of the most sparsely inhabited.

Pudasjärvi is famed for its nature, and is the home of the southernmost fell area in Finland, Syöte.

The oldest dated rock formations within the European Union can be found in Siuruankylä, Pudasjärvi. The trondhjemite gneiss is aged 3,500 million years.

Two Finnish melodic death metal bands, Kalmah and Eternal Tears of Sorrow formed in Pudasjärvi.

The Big Dipper and the bear of the Pudasjärvi&#x27;s coat of arms are based on the old seal of the parish keeper. The coat of arms was designed by Gustaf von Numers, and the Pudasjärvi town council approved it at its meeting on August 2, 1950. The Ministry of the Interior approved the coat of arms for use on September 26 of the same year.

==History==
Pudasjärvi town was named after the Pudasjärvi village, which was named after the Pudasjärvi lake, meaning &quot;Anabranch Lake&quot;. However, the original Pudasjärvi village is no longer the center of the town. The current center is known as Kurenalus. As people have started calling the center Kurenalus with the name &quot;Pudasjärvi&quot;, the original Pudasjärvi village has gained the additional name Riekinranta.

<text>Pukkila (; Swedish: &quot;Pukkila&quot;, also ) is a municipality of Finland. It is located in the Uusimaa region. The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is .

The municipality is unilingually Finnish. The &quot;pukki-&quot; part of the municipality&#x27;s name means &quot;male goat&quot;, which is why the name of the municipality literally means the &quot;place of goat&quot;. Pukkila has previously also been called &quot;Savijoki&quot; (&quot;Clay River&quot;) and, in local colloquial language, &quot;Vähä-Porvoo&quot; (&quot;Lesser Porvoo&quot;).

In 1962, a former villager, Onni Nurmi, bequeathed the village 760 shares in a company called Nokia - then chiefly known as a manufacturer of rubber workboots - on condition that the income be used for the benefit of the elderly and that the shares would never be sold. After a legal battle the shares have now been diversified and the income used to fund a welfare centre and services for the elderly.

==Sights==
Pukkila includes the Naarkoski rapids with small waterfalls and fishponds, the Pukkila Church, Pukkila&#x27;s wild boar garden, and the old and new part of Yado Oikawa&#x27;s Japanese inn.

<doc id="783599" wikidata="Q201347" url="?curid=783599" title="Torbern Bergman">
<text>Torbern Olof Bergman (&quot;KVO&quot;) (20 March 17358 July 1784) was a Swedish chemist and mineralogist noted for his 1775 &quot;Dissertation on Elective Attractions&quot;, containing the largest chemical affinity tables ever published. Bergman was the first chemist to use the A, B, C, etc., system of notation for chemical species.

==Early life and education==
Torbern was born on 20 March 1735, the son of Barthold Bergman and Sara Hägg. He enrolled at the University of Uppsala at age 17. His father wished him to read either law or divinity, while he himself was anxious to study mathematics and natural science; in the effort to please both himself and his father, he overworked himself and harmed his health. During a period of enforced abstinence from study, he amused himself with field botany and entomology. He was able to send Linnaeus specimens of several new kinds of insects, and in 1756 he succeeded in proving that, contrary to the opinion of that naturalist, the so-called &quot;Coccus aquaticus&quot; was really the ovum of a kind of leech. He returned to the university in 1758, and received his PhD in that year.

==Career==

Bergman lectured at the University of Uppsala on physics and mathematics, publishing papers on the rainbow, the aurora, the pyroelectric phenomena of tourmaline. Upon the resignation of the celebrated Johan Wallerius, Bergman was a candidate for the professorship of chemistry and mineralogy. His competitors charged him with ignorance of the subject, because he had never written on it. To refute them, he shut himself up for some time in a laboratory, and prepared a treatise on the manufacture of alum, which became a standard work. Thanks to the influence of Gustav III, then crown prince and chancellor of the university, he was appointed a professor of chemistry, and remained at this position for the rest of his life.

Bergman greatly contributed to the advancement of quantitative analysis, and he developed a mineral classification scheme based on chemical characteristics and appearance. He is noted for his research on the chemistry of metals, especially bismuth and nickel.

In 1764, Bergman was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In April 1765 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. In 1773 he was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society. In March 1782, he was elected Foreign Associate of the French Academy of Sciences.

In 1771, six years after he first discovered carbonated water and four years after Joseph Priestley first created artificially carbonated water, Bergman perfected a process to make carbonated water from chalk by the action of sulphuric acid. He is also noted for his sponsorship of Carl Wilhelm Scheele, whom some deem to be Bergman&#x27;s &quot;greatest discovery&quot;. The translation into English of his book Physical and Chemical Essays was read widely and regarded as the first systematic method of chemical analysis.

==Personal life==
In 1771, Bergman married Margareta Catharina Trast.

==Legacy==
In Bergman&#x27;s honour, the uranium mineral torbernite and the lunar crater Bergman both bear his name.

==Club history==
===KS Mostostal Zabrze===
KS Mostostal Zabrze was founded on 8 March 1994 in Kędzierzyn-Koźle. The team of that time was composed of former players of &quot;Chemik Kędzierzyn&quot;, the club that ceased to exist in 1993. In 1995, the team led by Leszek Milewski won promotion to the top Polish volleyball league, and by doing that, the club made the first step on track to eventually win the championship title. In the same year, the club changed its name to &quot;KS Mostostal ZA Kędzierzyn&quot;, as a result of Grupa Azoty, the company operating in the chemical industry, becoming a shareholder of the club. 

In 1997, the club from Kędzierzyn-Koźle, after spending only 2 years in the top league, was close to achieve its first championship, losing in the final to AZS Częstochowa. Both clubs were competing for the highest domestic trophies almost every season, what resulted in a long–standing rivalry in the years to come.

In 1998, &quot;Mostostal ZA Kędzierzyn&quot; led by Jan Such for the first time in club&#x27;s history won its first championship, beating Morze Bałtyk Szczecin in the deciding match held in Kędzierzyn-Koźle.

===Mostostal Azoty===
In 1998, the club changed its name to Mostostal Azoty Kędzierzyn-Koźle. In the upcoming season, even though &quot;Mostostal&quot; reached the league finals, the club did not manage to defend the championship and had to credit the superiority of AZS Częstochowa. In the same season, the team also made a debut in the CEV Champions League, in which &quot;Mostostal&quot; finished last in its group and did not advance to the semifinals. After that season, Jan Such left the team from Kędzierzyn-Koźle and has been replaced by Waldemar Wspaniały, who led the team in next 5 years, until 2004.
With Waldemar Wspaniały on the bench, &quot;Mostostal&quot; became a dominant power in the league, winning 4 Polish Championships in a row (2000, 2001, 2002, 2003) and three Polish Cups (2000, 2001, 2002), the period often referred to as a golden era of &quot;Mostostal&quot;. On the international stage, the club made its way to the Champions League Final Four tournament in 2002, and managed to win a bronze medal at the 2003 edition held in Milan, defeating Paris Volley in 3 sets.

After winning the Polish title in 2003, &quot;Mostostal&quot; did not manage to keep 2 national team members; Sebastian Świderski decided to leave the club and continue his career in Italy, while Paweł Papke joined the rival club from Olsztyn. The 2003–04 season, &quot;Mostostal&quot; ended in 6th place. Waldemar Wspaniały left the club after that season and has been replaced by a Slovak coach Rastislav Chudík.

The team of Rastislav Chudík started well in the league, beating the Polish champions Jastrzębski Węgiel, however &quot;Mostosal&quot; was not doing well in the rest of the season and eventually finished 5th in the championship. The club management decided not to sign a new contract with coach Chudík, and as a result, Wojciech Drzyzga has become the new head coach of the team.

Although &quot;Mostostal&quot; fans dreamed of regaining the place at the top of the league, the 2005–06 season was the worst in club&#x27;s history. Wojciech Drzyzga has been dismissed, after a series of 10 defeats in a row, and so far acting as his assistant coach, Andrzej Kubacki has become the new head coach. The club from Kędzierzyn-Koźle was not able to save that season and finished 8th in the championship.

After the infamous 2005–06 season, the club management did not specify any particular goal for the upcoming season; the team was supposed to present good volleyball. &quot;Mostostal&quot; managed to take part in the Playoff stage of the championship, and was close to defeat Jastrzębski Węgiel and move on in the competition, but had to credit the superiority of the team from Jastrzębie-Zdrój after as many as 5 matches (2–3). Eventually, &quot;Mostostal&quot; ended the season in 6th place, after 3 matches for 5th place against Asseco Resovia (1–2).

===ZAKSA===

The new 2007–08 season brought many changes to volleyball in Kędzierzyn-Koźle with Grupa Azoty, becoming the main shareholder of the club and at the same time, saving the club from going bankrupt. Therefore, the team has started the season under the new name of ZAKSA Kędzierzyn-Koźle. The club strengthened its ranks with Jakub Novotný who has become one of the most significant players, and the Polish national team member Łukasz Żygadło. At the end of the regular season, an unexpected defeat in Bydgoszcz complicated the situation of &quot;ZAKSA&quot;, which now in the Playoff stage of the competition, just like in the previous season had to face Jastrzębski Węgiel. The team from Kędzierzyn-Koźle has lost both to Jastrzębski Węgiel, and in 3 matches for 5th place to Asseco Resovia (1–2).

In 2008, the club management headed by Kazimierz Pietrzyk decided to entrust the team to Krzysztof Stelmach, and so far acting as the head coach, Andrzej Kubacki has become Stelmach&#x27;s assistant. Before the 2008–09 PlusLiga season, &quot;ZAKSA&quot; has been heavily rebuilt with such names as Michal Masný or Michał Ruciak joining the club. After a successful regular season, in which &quot;ZAKSA&quot; finished second, the team led by Stelmach lost in the semifinals to Asseco Resovia, and was left with a match for 3rd place against Jastrzębski Węgiel. Unfortunately, &quot;ZAKSA&quot; had to credit the superiority of Jastrzębski Węgiel and eventually finished the season in 4th place. As a result, the club was granted the right to compete in the upcoming CEV Cup edition.

<text>Puumala () is a municipality of Finland. It is located in the Southern Savonia region. The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is .

The municipality is unilingually Finnish.
The main road route through the region is route 62, which connects to Mikkeli to the north and Imatra to the south. Until the year 1995 a cable ferry connected the two sides of Puumalansalmi-strait. In 1995, a bridge replaced the ferry. The bridge is a very dominant structure when looking Puumala town center from a distance.

Puumala has relatively good services compared to the amount of population. In the town center is situated a post office, an Alko store, a kiosk, several supermarkets and a few restaurants. The reason for the survival of these entrepreneurs is the arrival of summer inhabitants who triple the population of Puumala during the season.

In June 1788, Swedish soldiers wearing uniforms of the Imperial Russian Army, staged an attack against the town. This would allow King Gustav III to declare a defensive war against the Russian Empire, as Swedish law prohibited starting offensive wars without approval by the Riksdag.

The subject of Puumala&#x27;s coat of arms refers to the local history: in the Treaty of Åbo in 1743, Puumala became a border parish, but due to its strategic location, the narrow Puumalansalmi has been the scene of several battles since the 16th century, which the flaming bombshells on the coat of arms refer to. The coat of arms was designed by Tapio Vallioja, and the Puumala municipal council approved it at its meeting on September 24, 1962. The Ministry of the Interior approved the coat of arms for use on April 18, 1963.

The Puumala virus is named after this place as it was first isolated from samples from the Puumala area.

The medieval church (as opposed to the municipality) is situated in the village of Itäkirkonkylä (&quot;East Church Village&quot;). During the Reformation, the rather beautiful and moving pictures on the walls were whitewashed over. Some years ago, they were rediscovered and the whitewash removed. The village lies just to the East of the westernmost tributary of the Kymi River and was at one time on the border between Russia and Sweden established by the Treaty of Åbo in 1743. Indeed, on the Western side of the river is a municipality called Ruotsinpyhtää (&quot;Swedish Pyhtää&quot;) known as in Swedish.

Pyhtää is a bilingual municipality with Finnish and Swedish as its official languages. The population consists of Finnish speakers, Swedish speakers, and speakers of other languages.

In the 1980s, salmon soup, salted herrings and clot soup (&quot;klimppisoppa&quot;) were named as Pyhtää&#x27;s traditional parish dishes.

<text>Charles Patrick Fleeming Jenkin, Baron Jenkin of Roding, (7 September 1926 – 20 December 2016) was a British Conservative Party politician who served as a cabinet minister in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s first government.

==Life and career==
Jenkin was born in September 1926 and educated at the Dragon School in Oxford, Clifton College in Bristol and Jesus College, Cambridge. He became a barrister, called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1952, and company director. He was a councillor on Hornsey Borough Council from 1960 to 1963.

The following year, Jenkin became the Conservative Member of Parliament for Wanstead and Woodford. From 1965, he served as an Opposition spokesman on economic and trade affairs. He was a member of the Bow Group from 1951. In January 1974, he became Minister for Energy just weeks before the Conservatives fell from office, and participated in many ways in the government of Margaret Thatcher. He served as Secretary of State for Social Services from 1979 to 1981, then as Secretary of State for Industry until 1983, and finally as Secretary of State for the Environment from 1983 to 1985.

Jenkin retired from the Commons at the 1987 general election. He was elevated to the House of Lords as a life peer with the title Baron Jenkin of Roding, of Wanstead and Woodford in Greater London. Whilst in the Lords, Jenkin was interviewed in 2012 as part of The History of Parliament&#x27;s oral history project. He was noted for his contribution to the debate during the passage of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. On 6 January 2015 he retired from the House of Lords pursuant to section 1 of the House of Lords Reform Act 2014. He died on 20 December 2016, aged 90.

Jenkin was president of the Foundation for Science and Technology, and a vice-president of the Local Government Association.

==Family and personal life==
Lord Jenkin&#x27;s grandfather, Frewen, was the first Professor of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford from 1908 in the newly created Department of Engineering Science, and the namesake of the Jenkin Building at Oxford. Lord Jenkin&#x27;s great-grandfather was the engineer Fleeming Jenkin.

In 1954, he married (Alison) Monica Graham (1928–2022). They had two sons and two daughters. Their younger son, Bernard, is the Conservative Member of Parliament for Harwich and North Essex.

<text>Timothy Shallice (born 1940) is a professor of neuropsychology and the founding director of the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, part of University College London. He has been a professor at Cognitive Neuroscience Sector of the International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA) in Trieste, Italy since 1994 but is now retired.

Shallice has been influential in laying the foundations for the discipline of cognitive neuropsychology, by formalising many of its methods and assumptions in his 1988 book &quot;From Neuropsychology to Mental Structure&quot;. He has also worked on many core problems in cognitive psychology and neuropsychology, including executive function, language and memory. Together with psychologist Don Norman, Shallice proposed a framework of attentional control of executive functioning. One of the components of the Norman-Shallice model is the supervisory attentional system. The model is viewed as a possible realization of Alexander Luria&#x27;s theory in information-processing terms.

Together with John Fox, Shallice was also awarded a grant on cognitive modelling by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Joint Council Initiative in Cognitive Science and Human-Computer Interaction. The project developed an existing specification language for cognitive modelling and resulted to a prototype COGENT system.

Shallice also co-authored a study on the relationship of prospective and retrospective memory using neuropsychological evidence with Paul W. Burgess. Shallice contributed in the development of neuropsychological tests including the Hayling and Brixton tests and the Behavioural Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS).

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1996.

<doc id="783654" wikidata="Q5418727" url="?curid=783654" title="Evolvable hardware">
<text>Evolvable hardware (EH) is a field focusing on the use of evolutionary algorithms (EA) to create specialized electronics without manual engineering. It brings together reconfigurable hardware, evolutionary computation, fault tolerance and autonomous systems. Evolvable hardware refers to hardware that can change its architecture and behavior dynamically and autonomously by interacting with its environment.

==Introduction==
In its most fundamental form an evolutionary algorithm manipulates a population of individuals where each individual describes how to construct a candidate circuit. Each circuit is assigned a fitness, which indicates how well a candidate circuit satisfies the design specification. The evolutionary algorithm uses stochastic operators to evolve new circuit configurations from existing ones. Done properly, over time the evolutionary algorithm will evolve a circuit configuration that exhibits desirable behavior.

Each candidate circuit can either be simulated or physically implemented in a reconfigurable device. Typical reconfigurable devices are field-programmable gate arrays (for digital designs) or field-programmable analog arrays (for analog designs). At a lower level of abstraction are the field-programmable transistor arrays that can implement either digital or analog designs.

The concept was pioneered by Adrian Thompson at the University of Sussex, England, who in 1996 used an FPGA to evolve a tone discriminator that used fewer than 40 programmable logic gates, and had no clock signal. This is a remarkably small design for such a device, and relied on exploiting peculiarities of the hardware that engineers normally avoid. For example, one group of gates has no logical connection to the rest of the circuit, yet is crucial to its function.

==Motivation==
In many cases, conventional design methods (formulas, etc.) can be used to design a circuit. But in other cases, the design specification doesn&#x27;t provide sufficient information to permit using conventional design methods. For example, the specification may only state desired behavior of the target hardware.

In other cases, an existing circuit must adapt—i.e., modify its configuration—to compensate for faults or perhaps a changing operational environment. For instance, deep-space probes may encounter sudden high radiation environments, which alter a circuit&#x27;s performance; the circuit must self-adapt to restore as much of the original behavior as possible.

==Finding the fitness of an evolved circuit==
The fitness of an evolved circuit is a measure of how well the circuit matches the design specification. Fitness in evolvable hardware problems is determined via two methods:
* extrinsic evolution: all circuits are simulated to see how they perform,
* intrinsic evolution: physical tests are run on actual hardware.

In extrinsic evolution, only the final best solution in the final population of the evolutionary algorithm is physically implemented, whereas with intrinsic evolution every individual in every generation of the EA&#x27;s population is physically realized and tested.

==Future research directions==
Evolvable hardware problems fall into two categories: original design and adaptive systems. Original design uses evolutionary algorithms to design a system that meets a predefined specification. Adaptive systems reconfigure an existing design to counteract faults or a changed operational environment.

Original design of digital systems is not of much interest because industry already can synthesize enormously complex circuitry. For example, one can buy intellectual property cores to synthesize USB port circuitry, Ethernet microcontrollers and even entire RISC processors. Some research into original design still yields useful results, for example genetic algorithms have been used to design logic systems with integrated fault detection that outperform hand designed equivalents.

Original design of analog circuitry is still a wide-open research area. Indeed, the analog design industry is nowhere near as mature as is the digital design industry. Adaptive systems has been and remains an area of intense interest.

<doc id="783663" wikidata="Q8054123" url="?curid=783663" title="Yo Mama's Last Supper">
<text>Yo Mama&#x27;s Last Supper is a work of art, made in 1996 by Jamaican-American artist Renée Cox. It is a large photographic montage of five panels, each 31 inches square, depicting photographs of 11 black men, a white Judas and a naked black woman (the artist&#x27;s self-portrait) posed in imitation of Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s 1490s painting &quot;The Last Supper&quot;. Cox is pictured naked and standing, with her arms reaching upwards, as Jesus.

In 2001, the piece was exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum of Art as part of an exhibition called &quot;Committed to the Image: Contemporary Black Photographers.&quot; New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was offended by the work and called for the creation of a panel to create decency standards for all art shown at publicly funded museums in the city. Art scholar Camille Paglia, however, said in 2012 that &quot;Renée Cox is an important black photographer and a performance artist, who uses herself... This, I think, is a serious statement, this work. It might be shocking to have a nude black woman in the position of Christ, but I think, as a whole, the work had some dignity, it had gravitas.&quot;

The work has also been included in other exhibitions about artistic depictions of The Last Supper, in locations such as the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield, Connecticut; Oratorio di San Ludovico, a 17th-century Catholic church in Venice, Italy; and a gallery in Jakarta, Indonesia.

<text>Ferndown is a town and civil parish in Dorset in southern England, immediately to the north of Bournemouth and Poole. The parish, which until 1972 was called &quot;Hampreston&quot;, includes the communities of Ameysford, Hampreston, Longham, Stapehill and Trickett&#x27;s Cross. At the 2011 census, the population of the parish was 26,559, making Ferndown the largest inland town in Dorset in terms of population, being larger than Dorchester.

The district has a relatively large elderly population: in 2006, 38.5% were aged 60 or above.

==Transport==
Ferndown lies adjacent to the A31 trunk road between Wimborne and Ringwood. To the east, the A31 connects to the M27 and M3 via the outskirts of Southampton to Winchester, and thence to Basingstoke and London or via the A34 to the M4 north of Newbury. To the west, the A31 links to the A35 to East Dorset and Devon. The nearest railway station is Branksome, away.

The nearby port of Poole provides year-round services to Cherbourg in France and Santander in Spain. Condor Ferries catamarans run seasonal services to Guernsey, Jersey and St. Malo, Brittany.

Ferndown is from Bournemouth International Airport at Hurn. Ryanair, Jet2, TUI are the main operators and provide scheduled services to destinations in the UK and Europe.

Ferndown is served by 5 bus routes: the 13 &amp; 13a to Wimborne and Bournemouth, the X6 to Ringwood, Verwood, Bearwood and Poole, the FE1 to Ferndown Industrial Estate and Poole, and the 38 to Ringwood, all operated by morebus

==Industry==
On the outskirts of the town lie the Ferndown and Uddens Industrial Estates, forming the largest industrial area in East Dorset containing a wide range of both small and large businesses. Ferndown Industrial Estate, Uddens Trading Estate and East Dorset Trade Park cover an area of approximately 61.h hectares. Many household names and major employers are present there, such as Farrow &amp; Ball. A diverse range of industries are also represented covering business services, manufacturing, retail and many more.

==Sport and recreation==
The King George&#x27;s Field named in memoriam to King George V is very large area of open space including a children&#x27;s playground with equipment for children with special needs, six tennis courts, four football pitches, cricket pitch, a bowling green, boules area, croquet practice lawn, a rugby pitch and a fully equipped skateboard park.

There are two golf clubs, Ferndown Forest Golf Club, which offers a single 18-hole course, and Ferndown Golf Club, which offers two courses: The Old Course also known as the Championship Course, and the nine-hole Aliss Course also known as the President&#x27;s Course.

The Ferndown Leisure Centre, situated next to Ferndown Upper School, has two heated pools, a sports hall, a fully equipped Gymnasium, Squash Courts and a rifle range as well as a power house suite. The Leisure Centre facilities (as well as the surrounding field) are shared with the Upper School.

Ferndown Community Centre is one of the town&#x27;s main attractions, home of the Barrington Theatre in the main shopping centre at Penny&#x27;s Walk, which also includes a large Tesco supermarket and the local branch of the county library.

Also there are large areas of woodland and heathlands around Ferndown including Holt Heath and Slop Bog. This heathland originally covered the entire area and up until the early 1900s covered many areas that are now residential. Also on many of the heaths and in much of the woodland there are many burial mounds and small ponds. However, recently Ferndown Heath, visible from King George V playing field, has been subject to several heath fires.

==Education==
Schooling in Ferndown, as in much of Dorset, is based on a three-tier system of first, middle and upper schools. Ferndown Upper School is a co-educational comprehensive school for students aged between 13 and 19, with up to 320 pupils admitted each year from its feeder middle schools in Ferndown, West Moors and Verwood.

Ferndown Middle School (on the former Gorsemoor Middle School site) takes pupils at age 9 from Ferndown First School (on the old Ferndown Middle School site), Hampreston First School and Parley First School. The Ferndown school changes occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the original first school was demolished to make way for a small residential area named Old School Close, and former Dorset Council offices, now called Enterprise House and owned by logistics company Hoare Lea. The two middle schools combined and one became the new first school.

== Politics ==
Ferndown is part of the Christchurch constituency.

Ferndown is covered by Ferndown North and Ferndown South for Dorset Council.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Rowridge TV transmitter.

In 1966, the nation was among the four founders of the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan, established to pool resources for development and to improve relations with state and federal governments. Others are the Bay Mills Indian Community, Keneenaw Potawatomi Indian Community, and Hannahville Indian Community. They have worked together since. In the early 21st century, the Council consists of members from 11 of the 12 federally recognized tribes in Michigan.

The tribe operates community facilities, including a substance-abuse treatment center, a community clinic, and health facilities. In the early 21st century, the tribe opened a new Elders&#x27; Center.

The tribe operates the Saginaw Chippewa Academy (an elementary school). They also have Native American advocates and tutors who work with students in the local public schools.

In 1993, the tribe elected their first female Tribal Chief, Gail George, who served until 1995.

In 1998 the tribe established Saginaw Chippewa Tribal College. Since 2007 it has been an accredited two-year community college. The Nation has an agreement with Central Michigan University that allows students to readily transfer credits to CMU to complete a 4-year degree there.

The Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe also operates the Ziibiwing Cultural Society (a tribal museum). It encourages use and teaching of the Ojibwe language. The reservation has the largest community of Ojibwe language speakers in Michigan.

The tribe hosts a pow-wow every year during the last full weekend in July. This competition pow-wow takes place at the grounds on &quot;the Hill&quot; (the only rise on the otherwise flat Isabella Reservation). The Hill is also the site of the tribal campgrounds and the Chippewa Indian Methodist Church.

On December 2, 2019, the tribe signed a memorandum of understanding with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources to co-manage the Sanilac Petroglyphs Historic State Park in Sanilac County. This agreement marks the first state-tribal co-management of a Michigan state park.

== History ==
Pylkönmäki was first mentioned in 1788, at the time referring to a farm in the village of Paajala. It is named after Antti Pylkkänen (or Pylkkinen), who moved from Tavastia into the Karanka wilderness, where the village of Paajala would later appear.

The area was originally a part of Saarijärvi. In 1858 its inhabitants requested the establishment of a chapel in the settlement of Pylkönmäki, which is located between the villages of Paajala and Kukko. The Finnish senate decided that Pylkönmäki should become a separate parish and municipality in 1898, but the change only happened later in 1914.

Pälkäne is a very popular summer vacation resort given its diverse services, high-quality swimming beach, beautiful nature and close location to big cities.
From start of year 2007 Pälkäne and Luopioinen were merged to a new municipality of Pälkäne.

==Geography==
===Nature===
The landscape of Pälkäne is dominated by several lakes, the largest of which are Lake Mallasvesi on the west side of Onkkaala and Lake Pälkänevesi on its east side, as well as Lake Roine on the Kangasala side and Lake Ilmoilanselkä on the Hauho (Hämeenlinna) side. Lake Kukkia is situated in the area of the former municipality of Luopioinen. In the western part of Pälkäne, Roine and Mallasvesi are separated by the rather large island of Hausalo.

The Kostianvirta River, which belongs part to the drainage basin of the Kokemäki River, flows between Lake Pälkänevesi and Lake Mallasvesi. As the average water level of both lakes is about 84 meters above sea level, the flow direction of Kostianvirta sometimes changes, especially due to the spring meltwater.

<text>Cywilno-Wojskowy Klub Sportowy Resovia, shortened to CWKS Resovia, often referred to simply as Resovia, is a Polish multisport club, based in Rzeszów, Poland.

==History==
Resovia was officially registered in 1905 in the then Austrian Poland, but the history of the club dates back to several football teams, formed by students of local high schools in 1905–1907. As a result, in different sources the date of the foundation of Resovia is presented as 1905, 1907 and 1910. During World War I, when most of Austrian Galicia was occupied by the Russian Empire, the activities of Resovia were suspended. The organization was recreated in 1919, and in June 1920, first stadium was opened on Krakowska Street.

Resovia was formed as a football club, but in the 1920s, other departments were added (tennis, track and field, cycling). In 1932, volleyball team was formed, later the departments of boxing, table tennis and basketball were added. On February 12, 1933, Resovia was merged with football team of the 17th Infantry Regiment, which was garrisoned in Rzeszow. As a result of the merger, the organization changed its name into &quot;Wojskowo-Cywilne Towarzystwo Sportowe&quot; (&quot;WCTS, Military-Civilian Sports Association&quot;) Resovia.

In the 1930s, Resovia was among top teams of the &quot;Lwow Regional League&quot; (see Lower Level Football Leagues in Interwar Poland). It 1937, it won the regional championship, qualifying to the first round of the Ekstraklasa playoffs, where it faced Unia Lublin, Strzelec Janowa Dolina and Rewera Stanislawow. Resovia finished in the second spot, behind Unia Lublin.

The cooperation with the military ended in 1938, when Resovia received support from Rzeszów branch of the H. Cegielski – Poznań factory (currently: &quot;Zelmer Household Appliances&quot;). In 1938–1939, Resovia&#x27;s official name was &quot;Sports Club H. Cegielski Poznań Resovia&quot;.

== Archery ==
The archery teams, both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s, were several time Polish Champions, dominating the sport for several decades. The women&#x27;s team has won 12 championships (1961, 1962, 1963, 1965, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1974, 1975, 1978, 1980, 1985), whereas the men have won 9 championships (1961, 1962, 1963, 1965, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1989, 1991).

<doc id="783719" wikidata="Q5043749" url="?curid=783719" title="Carn Brea, Redruth">
<text>Carn Brea () is a civil parish and hilltop site in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The population of Carn Brea including Bosleake and Church Coombe was 8,013 at the 2011 census. The hilltop site is situated approximately southwest of Redruth. The settlements of Bosleake, Brea, Broad Lane, Carn Arthen, Carn Brea Village, Carnkie, Four Lanes, Grillis, Illogan Highway, Pencoys, Penhallick, Piece, Pool, Tolskithy, Tregajorran, Treskillard, Tuckingmill and West Tolgus are in the parish.

==Neolithic settlement==
The Neolithic settlement at Carn Brea was a tor enclosure occupied between around 3700 and 3400 BC. Roger Mercer directed archaeological excavations of the site in 1970
and 1972.

A inner enclosure was surrounded by one of . The ramparts consisted of stone walls with an earth bank and ditch. Traces of fourteen platforms on which would have stood Neolithic long houses have been found within its ramparts, along with pottery and flint artefacts.

The settlement had an estimated population of 100 to 150. There is evidence that the occupants cleared the surrounding land for farming by burning away the undergrowth and removing stones although the acid soil obliterated any environmental evidence. Nearby outcrops of rock suitable for making axes would have contributed to the village&#x27;s economy. Edge grinding stones, blanks and incomplete and finished axes found on the site indicate the inhabitants were accomplished stoneworkers and traded their products. Pottery found on the site appears to have been made from gabbroic clay originating nearly to the south in the present day parish of St Keverne suggesting a complex economic network in the area.

Over 700 flint arrowheads were found scattered at the site. Despite nineteenth-century destruction (work to level and widen the entrance track), there was a concentration of arrow heads around a probable entrance to the enclosure, Mercer&#x27;s site E. These arrows may have been used by a large group of archers in an organized assault upon a defended site. Every timber structure on the site had been burnt, and charcoal was the only organic matter that survived the acid soils. The earthworks may have been deliberately damaged by invaders.

==Iron Age settlement==

In the Iron Age the site was reoccupied and minerals were mined from the hillside. One hut floor was excavated, and sherds of characteristically Iron Age types, including &#x27;cordoned ware&#x27;, were found. The fortified gateway, Mercer&#x27;s Site G, was of Iron Age form, and Mercer suggests that although Site G produced no Iron Age artifacts, it is post-Neolithic. The crushed-rock road surface showed little sign of contemporary wear and could never have been subjected to even a modicum of traffic.

A hoard of Gallo-Belgic gold staters originating from northeastern Gaul and Kent were found in the 18th century.

The Ravenna Cosmography, of around AD 700, refers to Purocoronavis (almost certainly a corruption of Durocornovium), &#x27;a fort or walled settlement of the Cornovii&#x27; (unidentified, but possibly Tintagel or Carn Brea).

==Landmarks==
===Carn Brea Castle===

Carn Brea Castle stands near the top of the hill. It is built on the site of a chapel built in 1379 probably dedicated to St Michael. It was built in the 18th century by the Basset family as a hunting lodge. It is considered to be a folly built on the huge uncut boulders that make up part of its foundations, giving the impression of the building melting into the land. An East India trading ship named after Carn Brea Castle was wrecked off the Isle of Wight in 1829 and involved in excise tax fraud.

In the 1980s the abandoned building was converted into a Middle Eastern cuisine restaurant. The stolen Ford Anglia featured in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films was found at the castle in 2006. 

===Basset Monument===

At the highest point of the hill is a 90-feet high (27m) Celtic cross erected as a monument to Francis Basset, 1st Baron de Dunstanville and Basset (1757–1835). Basset, a mine owner, gained his titles for erecting earthworks to defend Plymouth from combined French and Spanish fleets in 1779, and suppressing a miners&#x27; &quot;food riot&quot; in 1785. Along with others, he petitioned the House of Lords against slavery in 1828. The monument was erected by public subscription in 1836. It is inscribed &quot;The County of Cornwall to the memory of Francis Lord de Dunstanville and Basset A.D. 1836.&quot; 

===Cup and Saucer Rock===
The Cup and Saucer Rock next to the monument is a large flattish rock with several deep basins (see Photograph). The rock has been called &quot;The Sacrificing Rock&quot; (although with doubtful historical accuracy). 

===Smugglers&#x27; Cave===

In a depression between the monument and the castle are the remains of the &quot;Smugglers&#x27; Cave&quot;. It was blocked with rocks by the council in the 1980s to stop children entering. The tunnel is rumoured to extend from the top of the carn into Redruth town, but it is probably an abandoned mine working. It may have been confused with another tunnel from the castle to St Uny&#x27;s church which was blocked for safety reasons around 1970 by the castle owners. 

===Saint Euny&#x27;s Well===
Saint Euny&#x27;s Well is at the foot of Carn Brea below the castle near St Euny&#x27;s Church. It has a plaque by Carn Brea Parish Trails reading &quot;St Euny Well. Holy well of St Euny visited by the Celtic Missionary 500AD&quot;. Stories about its sacred use may be confused with St Euny&#x27;s Well at Sancreed (see Carn Euny).

==Events==
At Easter Redruth Baptist Church erects a lit cross on the outcrop behind the Castle overlooking Redruth. For many years a Christian sunrise service has been held on Easter Sunday.

The Midsummer Eve (St. John&#x27;s Eve, 23 June) bonfire ceremony originated as a pagan ritual. Prayers are read in Cornish and the bonfire is lit, signalling other fires to be lit at Sennen, Sancreed Beacon, Carn Galver to the Tamar. When only the embers remain, young people leap across them to drive away evil and bring luck.

The Boxing Day meet of the Four Burrow Hunt starts at the top of Carn Brea. Due to the changes in fox hunting legislation foxes are no longer hunted.

<doc id="783723" wikidata="Q3522649" url="?curid=783723" title="Parthasarathy Temple, Chennai">
<text>The Parthasarathy Temple is a 6th-century Hindu Vaishnavite temple dedicated to Vishnu in Chennai, India. Located in the neighbourhood of Thiruvallikeni, the temple is glorified in the &quot;Naalayira Divya Prabandham&quot;, the early medieval Tamil literature canon of the Alvar saints from the 6th to 9th centuries CE and is classified as among the 108 &quot;Divya Desams&quot; dedicated to Vishnu. The name &#x27;Parthasarathy&#x27; means the &#x27;charioteer of Arjuna&#x27;, referring to Krishna&#x27;s role as a charioteer to Arjuna in the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

It was originally built by the Pallavas in the 6th century by king Narasimhavarman I. The temple has icons of five forms of Vishnu: Yoga Narasimha, Rama, Gajendra Varadaraja, Ranganatha, and Krishna as Parthasarathy. The temple is one of the oldest structures in Chennai. There are shrines for Vedavalli Thayar, Ranganatha, Rama, Gajendra Varadar, Narasimha, Andal, Hanuman, Alvars, Ramanuja, Swami Manavala Mamunigal and Vedanthachariar. The temple subscribes to Vaikhanasa agama and follows Tenkalai tradition. There are separate entrances and dhvajastambhas for the Parthasarathy and Yoga Narasimha temples. The gopuram (towers) and mandapas (pillars) are decorated with elaborate carvings, a standard feature of South Indian Temple Architecture.

==Legend==
As per Hindu legend, the Saptarishis, the seven sages worshipped five deities Panchaveeras, namely, Venkata Krishnaswamy, Rukmini, Satyaki, Balarama, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha. As per the Mahabharata, Vishnu, in his avatar as Krishna was acting as charioteer for Arjuna, the Pandava prince during the war with Kauravas. Krishna did not take any weapons during the war. During the fight between Arjuna and Bhishma, Krishna was injured by the arrow from Bhishma. The mark in the image in the temple is believed to follow the legend. The place is called Allikeni, meaning a pond of lily as it is believed that historically the place was full of lily ponds. The place is the only place where the presiding deity is sported with a moustache. As per another legend, the place was once a tulasi forest. A Chola king named Sumati wanted to see Vishnu in the form of Parthasarathy and prayed at Srinivasa temple in Tirupati. Srinivasa directed the king to visit the temple here built by sage Atreya and worshipped with another sage called Sumati.

==History==
The temple was originally built by the Pallavas Between the 6th and 8th century, subsequently expanded by Cholas and later by the Vijayanagara kings in the 15th century. The temple has several inscriptions dating from the 8th century in Tamil presumably from the period of Dantivarman, who was a Vishnu devotee. Thirumangai Alvar, the 8th-century poet-saint also attributes the building of temple to the Pallava king. From the internal references of the temple, it appears that the temple was restored during 1564 CE when new shrines were built. In later years, endowments of villages and gardens have enriched the temple. The temple also has inscriptions about the Pallava king, Nandivarman of the 8th Century. One of the earliest Alvars Pey Alvar (who lived between 5th and 6th Century) has mentioned this temple which makes the temple the oldest structure in Chennai.
The temple was extensively built during the Chola period and a lot of inscriptions dating back to the same period are found here. The outer most mandapam is replete with sculptures of various forms of Vishnu, especially the avatars. One can also see inscriptions of Dantivarma Pallava of the 8th century, Chola and Vijayanagara in the temple.
The first architectural expansion of the temple took place during the reign of the Pallavas (Tondaiyar Kon) as vividly described by Tirumangai Alvar. Reminiscent of this is the inscription of the Pallava King Dantivarman (796–847 CE), which is preserved in the temple.

The temple witnessed a major expansion during the rule of the Vijayanagara kings like Sadasiva Raya, Sriranga Raya and Venkatapati Raya II (16th century). Many subshrines and pillared pavilions (mandapas) like the Tiruvaymoli Mandapa were added.

A Pallava king built the present temple in the eighth century. The gopuram was also built by a Pallava king - Tondaiman Chakravarthy. There are inscriptions that record the contributions of the Chola kings Raja Raja and Kulottunga III, Pandya King Maravarman and many rulers of the Vijayanagara dynasty including Ramaraja Venkatapathiraja and Vira Venkatapathy. For a while the East India Company administered the temple.

The pushkarani is called Kairavani and five sacred teerthams are believed to surround the tank – Indra, Soma, Agni, Meena and Vishnu. Seven rishis – Bhrigu, Atri, Marichi, Markandeya, Sumati, Saptaroma and Jabali – performed penance here. All five deities in the temple have been extolled by Tirumangai Alvar. There is also a separate shrine for Andal, one of the 12 Alvars who is also considered as a consort to the presiding deity.

It is one of the very few shrines in the country dedicated to Krishna as Parthasarathy, charioteer of Arjuna and to contains idols of three avatars of Vishnu: Narasimha, Rama, and Krishna.

Unusually, he is depicted with a prominent moustache and carries a conch in his hand. Also unusual is the iconographical combination found in the sanctum. Here, Krishna is seen standing with consort Rukmini, elder brother Balarama, son Pradyumna, grandson Aniruddha and Satyaki. Because of the association of the temple with Krishna, Tiruvallikeni came to be regarded as the Southern Vrindavana. He also mentioned about the Telliya Singar shrine within the temple.

The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu.

==Religious traditions==
The temple is administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. The temple follows the traditions of the Thenkalai sect of Vaishnavite tradition and follows the Vaikhanasa Agama. The temple has grand &quot;brahmotsavams&quot; (big festival) for Parthasarathy during the Tamil month of Chittirai (April–May), on the same month Udayavar utsavam is also celebrated.

As per Sri Pillailogam Jeeyar Swamy in his work &quot;Ramanuja Divya Charithai&quot; it is stated that Sri Asoori Kesava Somayaji, father of Ramanuja, performed Putrakaameshti Yagam at Kairavini the temple pond at Thiruvallikeni, and prayed to Parthasarathy to bless him with a son. Parthasarathy appeared in the dreams of Sri Asoori Kesava Somayaji and promised he will be born as his son to impart teachings of his Gita for the benefit of mankind. The &quot;Bhagavad Gita Bhāshya&quot; (a review and commentary on the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;), was later written by Ramanuja. In conformity of the above tradition during the annual festival, unlike other Alvars and acharyas, Ramanuja has independent processions both in the morning and evening.

In the month of Vaikasi, the occasions of Sri Varadarajar utsavam, Sri Nammalvar utsavam (vaikasi-vishakam), and Vasantotsavam are celebrated, while Aḻagiyasingar (Narasimha) is venerated during the Tamil month of Ani (June–July). There are also festivals for Ramanuja (April–May) and Manavala Mamunigal (Oct-Nov) besides festivals for Alvars and acharyas. The occasion of Vaikuntha Ekadashi during the Tamil month of Margaḻi (December–January) draws a lot of pilgrims.



===Utsavams===
Utsavams take place around the year in Parthasarathy temple. Urchavams (or utsavams), as these are termed, take place for a particular god at a particular period of time in the year. It is a religious practise to carry the different gods of the temple through the mada veethis of triplicane during some of these festivals. The Gods will move in different religiously built temple vehicles (vaghanams, as these are termed in Tamil), like Elephant, Garuda, Horse, Yali (a mythical animal), Hamsa (Swan), Hanuman, temple Rath (ther in Tamil, chariot or Ratham, alternative terms), etc.

The temple is administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. The temple follows the traditions of the Thenkalai sect of Vaishnavite tradition and follows vaikanasa aagama. The temple has grand &quot;brahmotsavams&quot; (big festival) for Parthasarathy swami during the Tamil month of Chittirai (April–May), on the same month Udayavar utsavam is also celebrated.

The following are the various festivals or utsavams in the Parthasarathy temple in different parts of the Tamil Calendar year. During festival days the place is given a new look and accompanied by various traditional rites.


The most important among these festivals are the Vaikunda Ekadesi – as huge crowds from not only chennai, but also various parts of Tamil Nadu and India come to the temple on this day; Theppam or Thepotsavam – the colourful float festival, and the utsavam for the main deity Parthasarathy.

====Theppam (Float) festival====
Also known Teppothsavam (= Theppam + Utsavam), this pictorial and colourful festival takes place on 7 days in the Tamil month of masi, 3 days for Parthasarathy, one each for Sri Narasimhar, Sri Ranganathar, Sri Ramar and Sri Gajendra Varadhar. The seven-day event attracts a large number of devotees and onlookers from different parts of Chennai and Tamil Nadu.

A floating structure made up of drums, timber would be constructed and would be beautifully decorated with lights, flowers, religious paintings, silken buntings, etc. which serves as a visual delight. For better ambience, lights were also installed in the garden around the tank and additionally, focus lights were placed on the corners of the Neerazhi Mandapam (the Mandapam (structure) in the Center of the temple tank). Perumal (God) would come to the temple tank in Purappadu (departure) and be placed majestically inside the float. On all the days, the float completed five rounds around the Neerazhi Mandapam. After this, the deities were taken in a procession around the four Mada Streets.

Devotees in hundreds would converge and sit on the steps of the temple tank to have Darshan of the Lord on Theppam.
The specialty of the third day function is the &#x27;Thirumanjanam&#x27;, performed to the deity inside the float. Other than the bhattachariars (temple priests), no one is allowed inside the float. A Rescue team of about 10 swimmers is usually provided by the Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services.

This theppam festival exhibits one of the aspects of the richest cultural heritage aspects of Triplicane which one can see nowhere else in Chennai, other than Mylapore.

==Incidents==
The temple had internal conflict from the 1750s till the end of the century between the two subsects of Sri Vaishnavism, namely Tenkalai and Vadakalai. The two sects were grounded over the right of reciting each of their own version of concluding verses in the temple. A petition was received by the ruling British government to decide the religious dispute. English records mention petition during the year 1754 filed by local inhabitants and merchants seeking to resolve the dispute. They suggested that the Tenkalai Brahmins could recite their Srisailesadayaptram in the Parthasarathi shrine, while the Vadakalai Brahmins could recite their Ramanujadayapatram in the Telinga Singar shrine. The council agreed that the suggestion in the petition be accepted and publicly announced. There were further petitions in 1780 from the Tenkalai Brahmins that since the temple was built, recitals were made only in Srisailesadayaptram, which should continue. It also asserted that the trustee Manali Muthukrishna Mudali favoured Vadakalai resulting in the issue. While both the sects were claiming theirs should be the practice followed in the temple, the English administrators in India has deep rooted belief that old ways were the only solution to preserve tranquility. The Tenkalai sect had the sanction of antiquity and custom resulting in Tenkalai gaining precedence.

The bearers at the temple were traditionally fishermen of Triplicane. During the temple festivities, they carry the festival idol in their sturdy shoulders in an atmosphere of wine and toddy shops. They bargained for additional rights in the temple in 1928, which eventually ended their ties with the temple.

Muthuswami Dikshitar, composer of Indian classical music, who is considered one of the musical Trinity of Carnatic music composed the song &quot;Shri Parthasarathina pAlitOsmyaham&quot; on this Kshethram. 

Bharathiar, the Tamil poet and independence activist was struck by an elephant at the temple, whom he used to feed regularly. Although he survived the incident, a few months later his health deteriorated and he died.

Swami Vivekananda, an Indian Hindu monk was a devotee of Parthasarathy. In one of his letters in the year 1893 to his disciple Alasinga, he writes &#x27;Take a bow before Parthasarathy of Thiruvallikeni and give an undertaking before Him of a great sacrifice, one of a whole life for the poor, the lowly and the oppressed – for whom Parthasarathy comes from time to time and whom he loves above all.&#x27; You can find this letter to his disciple inscribed in one of the walls at temple corridor.

<doc id="783731" wikidata="Q7313833" url="?curid=783731" title="Renee Cox">
<text>Renee Cox (born October 16, 1960) is a Jamaican-American artist, photographer, lecturer, political activist and curator. Her work is considered part of the feminist art movement in the United States. Among the best known of her provocative works are &quot;Queen Nanny of the Maroons&quot;, &quot;Raje&quot; and &quot;Yo Mama&#x27;s Last Supper&quot;, which exemplify her Black Feminist politics. In addition, her work has provoked conversations at the intersections of cultural work, activism, gender, and African Studies. As a specialist in film and digital portraiture, Cox uses light, form, digital technology, and her own signature style to capture the identities and beauty within her subjects and herself.

== Background ==
Cox has &quot;dedicated her career to deconstructing stereotypes and to reconfiguring the black woman&#x27;s body, using her nude form as a subject.&quot; She uses herself as a primary model in order to promote an idea of &quot;self-love&quot; as articulated by bell hooks in her book &quot;Sisters of the Yam&quot;, because as Cox writes in an artist&#x27;s statement, &quot;slavery stripped black men and women of their dignity and identity and that history continues to have an adverse affect [sic] on the African American psyche.&quot; One of Cox&#x27;s main motivations has always been to create new, positive visual representations of African Americans. In her article, &quot;A Gynocentric Aesthetic&quot;, Cox argues that a shift to matriarchal art will transform aesthetic expressions to interact with daily life and society, rather than compartmentalized artistic discussions that emphasize beauty over process and expression.

Greg Tate, writer for &quot;The Village Voice,&quot; wrote: &quot;(Renee&#x27;s) her own heroine. She&#x27;s very much about using the work as a platform for self-love. And she&#x27;s clearly having fun in her role playing. It&#x27;s a very New York attitude: &#x27;Yeah, so what? I&#x27;m Jesus. I&#x27;m Wonder Woman.&quot;

In addition to making art, Cox has curated and acted. She has done projects for Rush Art Gallery from its inception. In 1996 she curated an exhibition entitled &quot;No Doubt&quot; at The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield, Connecticut and she co-starred in Bridgett Davis&#x27; independent film &quot;Naked Acts&quot;, where she portrayed a photographer.

==Career==

=== Editorial career ===
As a student at Syracuse University, Cox majored in film studies. After graduating, she decided to devote her energy to the realm of still photography. She began as an assistant fashion editor at &quot;Glamour Magazine&quot; and then moved to Paris to pursue a career as a fashion photographer. She spent three years working in Paris, shooting for magazines including &quot;Votre Beaute&quot; and &quot;Vogue Homme&quot; and for designers Issey Miyake and Claude Montana, among others.

Cox then returned to New York City, where she continued to work as a fashion photographer for ten years. Among her clients were editorial magazines such as &quot;Essence&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, and &quot;Seventeen&quot;. She also worked with Spike Lee, producing the poster for his 1988 film &quot;School Daze&quot;.

In the early 1990s, inspired by the birth of her first son, Cox decided to focus primarily on fine art photography. She received her Master of Fine Arts at the School of Visual Arts in New York and subsequently spent a year working with Mary Kelly and Ron Clark in the Whitney Independent Study Program.

In 1994, Cox exhibited her piece &quot;It Shall Be Named&quot; in the show &quot;Black Male: Representations of Masculinity in Contemporary American Art,&quot; curated by Thelma Golden at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City. A review of the show published in &quot;Art in America&quot; described the work as referring &quot;back to traditional art forms—in this case, the shaped crucifixes of 13th and 14th century Italy—with deep solemnity. The modern &quot;distortions&quot; and elisions of Cox&#x27;s representation interact with the reference to iconic martyrdom to evoke the terrible history of lynchings, beatings and emasculation visited on the bodies of black men in this country.&quot;

That same year, Cox&#x27;s seven-foot nude self-portrait &quot;Yo Mama&quot; was included in the &quot;Bad Girls&quot; show curated by Marcia Tucker at the New Museum. Cox was the first woman ever to be pregnant during the Whitney Independent Study Program, pregnant at the time with her second son, which motivated her to create the Yo Mama character and series of photographs. In the photograph Cox stands nude, wearing black high heels, brandishing her older son as if he were a weapon. In &quot;Yo Mama and the Statue&quot;, Cox critiques race and gender issues, whilst attempting to &quot;reconcile her persona as a pregnant black woman artist with the white male convention of museum study and classical statuary.&quot;

In 1995, Cox, Fo Wilson, and Tony Cokes created the Negro Art Collective (NAC) to fight cultural misrepresentations about Black Americans. The collective, working with Creative Time and Gee Street Records, created a poster campaign to challenge and provoke preconceived notions about race, crime and poverty. &quot;As far as representation, we have to take it back,&quot; Cox explained to the &quot;Daily News.&quot; The NAC appropriated a quote from scholar Charles Murray and added their commentary so as to appropriate the quote for their purposes. The idea was to present viewers with real information, which flies in the face of what Americans are taught to believe. The 24 by 36 inch posters read: &quot;Surprise, Surprise, &#x27;in raw numbers, European-American whites are the ethnic group with the most people in poverty, most illegitimate children, most people on welfare, most unemployed men, and most arrests for serious crimes.&#x27; Surprised.&quot; The posters ran in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Los Angeles. The project was originally inspired by Cox&#x27;s five-year-old son who had asked her one day: &quot;Why are all black people bad?&quot;

Soon after, Cox created her &quot;Raje&quot; alter-ego, a superhero who fights racism and teaches children African-American history. In 1998 the body of work was featured in a Fin de Siècle art festival in Nantes, France. Nantes was historically the last stop on the slave trade, before the ships were to return to Africa to pick up their human cargo. The photographs were installed on billboards all over the city.

In 1999, Cox&#x27;s work was shown in the Venice Biennale, in the Oratorio di S. Ludovico, a 17th-century Catholic church, where her piece &quot;Yo Mama&#x27;s Last Supper&quot; a contemporary re-imagining of Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s classic, was first shown. In Cox&#x27;s reimagining of this historically iconic scene, she stood nude in the place of Jesus Christ and is surrounded by all black apostles, except for Judas, who is white. In 2001, the piece was included in a Brooklyn Museum of Art exhibition &quot;Committed to the Image: Contemporary Black Photographers&quot;, curated by Barbara Millstein.

In 2001, Cox opened a show at the Robert Miller Gallery called &quot;American Family&quot;. The series featured family snapshots, as well as older family photographs juxtaposed with erotic self-portraits, and new re-creations of art historical classics. &quot;Olympia&#x27;s Boyz&quot; is featured in this show, which first appeared at the Brooklyn Museum in 2001. Cox has written: &quot;The body of work was a rebellion against all of the pre-ordained roles I am supposed to embrace as a woman: dutiful daughter, diminutive wife, and doting mother.&quot;

Later that year Cox undertook another series of photographs, this one named for the Jamaican national heroine, Queen Nanny of the Maroons. In the series, Cox took on the persona of Queen Nanny, who led the Maroons to victory in the First Maroon War. &quot;Queen Nanny of the Maroons&quot; was originally shown at the Robert Miller Gallery in 2005. Cox then exhibited the body of work in the Jamaican Biennial in 2007 where it won the Aaron Matalon Award.

Cox continues to show her work as well as develop new projects as she is inspired. Her present work explores sacred geometry and the use of fractals to create sculptural kaleidoscopes. &quot;Soul Culture&quot; for Cox has marked her embrace of the digital world and her continued exploration of the human body as a site to engage viewers and evoke the practice of healthy and intersectional discourse.

=== Critical assessment ===
Writing for &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine, art critic Roberta Smith described &quot;Yo Mama&quot; as &quot;one of the most striking images in the East Coast portion of the &quot;Bad Girls&quot; exhibition…A towering self-portrait, it showed the artist, naked except for a pair of black high heels, holding her two-year-old son…The image presents a woman, both regal and erotic, who seems singularly disinclined to take guff from anyone and whose son will undoubtedly grow up to respect her gender.&quot;

In 2001, &quot;Yo Mama&#x27;s Last Supper&quot; sparked an enormous controversy when Rudy Giuliani, then mayor of New York City, saw the work and proceeded to accuse Cox of being anti-Catholic. Giuliani gained national attention when he subsequently called for the creation of a panel to create decency standards for all art shown in publicly funded museums in the city. Giuliani told the &quot;Daily News&quot; that he did &quot;not believe that it is right for public money to be used to desecrate religion, to attack people&#x27;s ethnicity.&quot;

Cox&#x27;s &quot;Yo Mama&quot; is one of the focuses of writer Sheila F. Winborne&#x27;s chapter, &quot;Images of Jesus in Advancing Great Commission&quot;, in the book &quot;Teaching All Nations: Interrogating the Matthean Great Commission&quot;. Winborne describes Cox&#x27;s &quot;Yo Mama&quot; as &quot;fine&quot;, relating the piece to &quot;The perpetuation of the myth that the realistically rendered white Christ is superior to all other representational approaches supports the perception that the main issue is about appearances as signs of cultural and spiritual value, whereas in reality the main concern is the power to control outcomes in one&#x27;s own favor.&quot; Winborne further compares Cox&#x27;s &quot;Yo Mama&quot; to popular representations of Christ by adding: &quot;Ideas of white Christ as necessarily the most &#x27;holy&#x27; of images reinforces the power of this myth&#x27;s creators and supporters, along with the continued unequal treatment of others.&quot;

Cox publicly responded to Giuliani&#x27;s accusations by defending her first amendment right to portray herself as Christ. As Cox explained, her Catholic school education taught her that all human beings were created in the likeness of God. &quot;It&#x27;s all very hypocritical,&quot; she was quoted as saying in the &quot;Daily News&quot;, &quot;now that he has been busted with the other woman, I wouldn&#x27;t be talking about moral issues.&quot; At the time, Giuliani had recently admitted his affair with long-time friend Judy Nathan and proceeded to divorce his wife, Donna Hanover.

Cox states that her reasoning for her &quot;Yo Mama&#x27;s Last Supper&quot; piece was because &quot;Christianity is big in the African-American community, but there are no presentations of us,&quot; Cox added, &quot;I took it upon myself to include people of color in these classic scenarios.&quot;

This was the second time during Giuliani&#x27;s tenure that he attempted to censor art shown in New York City&#x27;s museums and it sparked a national controversy about artists&#x27; first amendment rights.

<doc id="783733" wikidata="Q209254" url="?curid=783733" title="Thor Hushovd">
<text>Thor Hushovd (born 18 January 1978) is a Norwegian former professional road bicycle racer. He is known for sprinting and time trialing; Hushovd is a three-time Norwegian national road race champion (2004, 2010, 2013), and was the winner of the 2010 World Road Race Championships. He was the first Norwegian to lead the Tour de France, and first Scandinavian to win the road race in cycling world road championship. He is also the Scandinavian with the most stage wins in Grand Tours. He is widely considered the greatest Norwegian cyclist of all time. He retired in September 2014.

==Career==
Born in Grimstad, Aust-Agder, Norway, Thor won the under-23 time trial world championship and the under-23 versions of Paris–Roubaix and Paris–Tours before turning professional in 1998. He was Norwegian time trial champion in 2004 and 2005 and road race champion in 2004 and 2010. In 2006, he won seven UCI ProTour races and two stages of the Tour de France. He won the prologue in Strasbourg and led after the first day despite a cut arm. He continued with stitches and regained the yellow jersey after stage 2 with a third place. He won the last stage, beating Robbie McEwen in a sprint, thus making him the only person to win the first stage or prologue and the last stage of the Tour de France in the same year. In the 2006 Vuelta a España he won stage 6, wore the golden jersey for three stages and won the points classification

At the 2008 Tour de France, Hushovd won stage 2 in a bunch finish.

===2009===

In 2009, Hushovd rode for the . He took one of the team&#x27;s first victories of the season by winning Stage 3 of the Tour of California. At the Tour de France, he won green jersey for the points classification for the second time, ahead of Mark Cavendish. Typically the sprinter with the most stage victories wins the points classification, though Thor only won one stage, stage 6, while Cavendish won six. After a controversy on stage 14, where Cavendish was relegated to the back of the peloton for impeding Hushovd, Hushovd attacked alone on stage 17, a mountain stage, winning two intermediate sprints. Hushovd won stage 3 at the Tour of Missouri – over rolling hills – in September 2009, in a sprint finish.

===2010===

On 9 May 2010, Hushovd broke his collarbone on a training ride after colliding with a young girl. At the Tour de France, Hushovd won the third stage, which was an unusual one for the Tour since it featured of cobblestones. He prevailed in the sprint involving five other riders. That victory netted him the Green jersey, but he ultimately lost it to Alessandro Petacchi of the team.

On 3 October 2010, Thor won the road world championship, which started in Melbourne and finished in Geelong, Australia. He was the first Norwegian to win the rainbow jersey. &quot;VeloNews&quot; said: &quot;Hushovd...dominated a bunch sprint at the end of a thrilling 267 km race, beating Denmark&#x27;s Matti Breschel and Australia&#x27;s Allan Davis.&quot; The favorite, Philippe Gilbert, was caught with three kilometers to go.

===2011===
During the 2011 Tour de France Hushovd took the lead in the general classification and surprised many by keeping it through several hilly stages that were not expected to suit him and second placed Cadel Evans could not over turn the 1 second advantage that Hushovd held. Thor surprised his fans again on stage 13 by being one of the first riders over the hors catégorie Col d&#x27;Aubisque and using his superior descending skills (he was clocked at 69 mph at one point) to catch and pass the leaders David Moncoutié and Jérémy Roy to take the stage. He used his descending skills again on stage 16 when he, Edvald Boasson Hagen and teammate Ryder Hesjedal went clear on the descent of the Col de Manse (a descent that overall runner up Andy Schleck deemed too dangerous for the tour) and beat Boasson Hagen in the final sprint to take his second stage of the tour.

===2012===
In 2012, Hushovd joined on a three-year contract. Suffering from a then unknown medical condition, he had to abandon the Giro d&#x27;Italia and cancelled his scheduled participation to the Tour de France and Olympic road race. The medical impairment was later identified as a &quot;virus and muscle inflammation&quot; by team doctors. Thor hardly achieved any notable result in the season except fourteenth at Paris–Roubaix. In October, he said that he hoped to put the bad year and the virus that ruined it behind him and that he was optimistic and motivated about the 2013 season.

===2013===
Hushovd earned his first win since the 2011 Tour of Britain with a sprint victory over Tom-Jelte Slagter of on stage 1 of the Tour du Haut Var in February. It was also his first victory with .

===Retirement===
In June 2014, Hushovd announced that he would retire after the 2014 UCI Road World Championships after struggling with Infectious mononucleosis since 2012. However, after a hard crash suffered at the Tour du Poitou-Charentes, Hushovd said he would not participate in the World Championships. His last race was the GP Impanis-Van Petegem in September.

In 2015 Thor announced that he had started working on organizing an all-Norwegian UCI WorldTeam, with a plan to launch in the 2017 season to coincide with the hosting of the 2017 UCI Road World Championships in the Norwegian city of Bergen. The plans were put on hold due to lack of funding, although Hushovd never abandoned them.

In the meantime, the Norwegian cycling team Uno-X was established. The team achieved UCI ProTeam status in 2020. Hushovd was initially not affiliated with Uno-X, although he used his legendary status in the world of cycling to help influence the ASO in Uno-X&#x27;s mission for a Wild Card to the 2023 Tour de France. In January 2024, Uno-X announced that Hushovd would become their new General Manager.
==Personal life==
Thor currently resides in Monte Carlo, Monaco, with his wife Susanne, and their daughter Isabel (b. 2009). The Hushovds also maintain an offseason residency in Grimstad, Aust-Agder, Norway.

<doc id="783741" wikidata="Q4805940" url="?curid=783741" title="Ashtalakshmi Temple, Chennai">
<text>The Ashtalakshmi Kovil is a Hindu temple, which lies on the shorelines near the Elliot&#x27;s beach, in Chennai, India. The temple is dedicated to the goddess Lakshmi, and her eight primary forms – the Ashtalakshmi – the giver of all eight forms of wealth, namely, offspring, success, prosperity, wealth, courage, bravery, food, and knowledge. The sanctorums are depicted on a multi-tier complex in such a way that visitors could visit all the shrines without stepping over any of the sanctorums.

==Construction==
The temple was constructed on the wishes of Sri Chandrashekarendra Saraswati swamigal of Kanchi Mutt. Sri Mukkur Srinivasa Varadhachariar was the Mahatma instrumental behind fulfilling the wishes of Kanchi Periyava.The foundation was laid in January 1974 by public participation. The consecration of the temple took place on 5 April 1976 in the presence of the 44th guru of the Ahobila Mutt Vedhantha Dhesika Yatheendhra Mahadhesikan Swami.

==The temple==
The temple measures 65 ft in length and 45 ft in breath. It is modeled after the Sundara Varadaraja Perumal temple in Uthiramerur.

In this temple, the Ashtalakshmis, the eight forms of goddess Lakshmi, are present in four levels in nine separate sanctums. The shrine of Lakshmi and her consort Vishnu is in level two. One starts the worship from here. Taking the stairs, the path leads to the third floor, which has the shrines of Santhanalakshmi, Vijayalakshmi, Vidyalakshmi and Gajalakshmi. Further few steps would lead to the shrine of Dhanalakshmi, which is the only shrine on the fourth floor. Exiting the main shrine, in the first level, there are shrines for Aadilakshmi, Dhaanya lakshmi and Dharyalakshmi. The temple also has Dashavatara (avatars of Vishnu), Guruvayoorappan, Ganesha, Dhanvanthari and Anjaneyar deities.

==Renovation==
In 2012, the temple was renovated at a cost of 7 million. Another 1.6 million was spent on conducting the &quot;Jeernotharana Ashtabandana mahakumbhabhishekam&quot;, a Hindu ceremony. A total of 32 kalasams were newly laid in the temple, including a gold-plated 5.5-foot-high kalasam atop the sanctum sanctorum.

<text>Ferryhill is a town and civil parish in County Durham, England, with an estimated population in 2018 of 9,362. The town grew in the 1900s around the coal mining industry. The last mine officially closed in 1968. It is located between the towns of Bishop Auckland, Newton Aycliffe, Sedgefield, Shildon, Spennymoor and the cathedral city of Durham.

==Geography==
Ferryhill sits on the western edge of the Ferryhill Gap, a natural gateway in limestone escarpment that outcrops on the Eastern Durham Plateau. The main settlement lies along the &#x27;SW-NE&#x27; ridge, with later developments made to the south of the ridge.

Ferryhill lies on the medieval Great North Road, which used to be the A1. It was bypassed when the Ferryhill Cut was excavated in 1923. The road is now the A167, which leads to Durham and Newcastle-upon-Tyne to the North, and to Darlington in the south.

Ferryhill Carrs is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and designated local nature reserve at the Eastern edge of the town.

Part of Dean Bank Park has been used to enhance sporting facilities, and the remainder has recently been the subject to consultation by the Town Council. The final plans include a £70,000 play area for which funding has been secured from the lottery, a £50,000 MUGA for which funding is being sought by the Friends of Dean Bank Park but has since been turned down due to it not been a community led group. Also funding has been applied for £50,000 of playbuilder facilities. In addition to this the new park will include a viewing tower, BMX/skatepark, new planting areas to walk and relax as well as a performance arena.

The Town has many community events including an annual summer gala, Christmas market, parading of miners banners, vintage car rally, art and photography exhibitions and many more, all of which are organised jointly by the Town Council and the 2000 Committee.

The facilities are to be used by the town&#x27;s thriving football clubs, Ferryhill Town Youth in particular. The nearby Dean Bank Park is maintained by Ferryhill Town Council, and belongs to the welfare fund for the former Dean and Chapter Colliery of 1968.

<doc id="783743" wikidata="Q7825283" url="?curid=783743" title="Tor enclosure">
<text>A tor enclosure is a prehistoric monument found in the southwestern part of Great Britain. These monuments emerged around 4000 BCE in the early Neolithic.

Tor enclosures are large enclosures situated near natural rock outcrops, especially tors, on hilltops or the sides of hills. They consist of one or more roughly circular stone walls built around the tor. They are comparable to the causewayed enclosures found elsewhere in the British Isles and many are of similar Neolithic date although others are from later in prehistory.

== Examples ==
The best known examples are Carn Brea in Cornwall, the first to be identified, following excavations in the early 1970s, and Helman Tor between Bodmin and Lostwithiel also in Cornwall.

Other possible examples are:
* Rough Tor on Bodmin Moor, Cornwall
* Stowe&#x27;s Hill, also on Bodmin Moor
* Whittor on Dartmoor.

<text>Richard Kenneth Dell (11 July 1920 – 6 March 2002) was a New Zealand malacologist.

==Biography==
Dell was born in Auckland in 1920. As a young boy, he took an interest in shells, collecting them from the shores of Waitematā Harbour. He even managed to start a &quot;museum&quot; in his backyard. He also helped curate the Auckland War Memorial Museum shell collection.

Dell studied at Mount Albert Grammar School and later at the Auckland University College. He took a teacher’s course at Auckland Teachers&#x27; College, but World War II delayed his plans to become a teacher. He joined the New Zealand Artillery, serving on Nissan Island, the Solomon Islands, Southwest Asia, Egypt, and Italy. He later published several papers on the land snails he had collected in the Solomon Islands.

In 1946, he married botanist and schoolteacher Miriam Matthews, and they had four daughters together. His wife continued working after their marriage and became a well-known women&#x27;s advocate.

After the war, Dell was offered a job as malacologist at the Dominion Museum, where he started to standardise the cabinets and built up a collection of more than 30,000 specimens. In the meantime, he took a master&#x27;s degree in Science at Victoria University College, with a pioneering thesis on cephalopods, octopuses and squid. Dell was one of the zoologists studying invertebrates on the 1949 New Zealand American Fiordland Expedition.&quot;&quot;

His breakthrough came with the 1954 Chatham Islands expedition. The results were published in 1956 as &quot;The Archibenthal Mollusca of New Zealand&quot;, which was a major contribution to the knowledge of molluscan fauna in the bathyal zone of New Zealand waters. This publication earned him a Doctorate in Science in 1956.

Soon after, Dell started to work on Antarctic collections, with among others Alan Beu and Winston Ponder. In 1964, he published a major monograph on the Antarctic bivalves, chitons and scaphopods.

In 1965 Dell was a participant in the Royal Society Expedition to the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. 

Dell became first Assistant Director in 1961 and later in 1966, Director of the Dominion Museum, which would become the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. He retired in 1980, and started writing again. In 1990, he published his standard work &quot;Antarctic Mollusca with special reference to the Fauna of the Ross Sea&quot;. Dell published more than 150 papers on Mollusca (marine, terrestrial and freshwater), crabs and birds. He also made a major contribution to the Antarctic biogeography.

==Honours and awards==
In the 1981 New Year Honours, Dell was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order for public services. In 1977, he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal, and in 1990 he received the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. He was an honoured member of many scientific societies and committees. He won prizes and medals in New Zealand and abroad, including the Hamilton Prize in 1955, and the Hector Medal in 1965, both awarded by the Royal Society of New Zealand. He has named many new species of molluscs and several new crustaceans.

==Death==
Dell died in 2002, after a long illness, in Wellington. He was survived by his wife, Dame Miriam Dell, and their four daughters.

<text>TV Land is an American pay television channel owned by Paramount Global through its networks division&#x27;s MTV Entertainment Group. It was originally launched as Nick at Nite’s TV Land as a spinoff of Nick at Nite consisting exclusively of classic television shows. The channel now airs a combination of recent and classic television series (ranging from the 1960s to the 2020s), original scripted series and limited theatrically released movies. The network is headquartered at One Astor Plaza in New York City. , TV Land is available to approximately 67,000,000 pay television households in the United States-down from its 2011 peak of 98,000,000 households.

== History ==
=== Launch and debut ===
The network launched at 10:00 p.m. Eastern on April 29, 1996, as Nick at Nite&#x27;s TV Land. Following a seven-minute short film introducing the network, the first program aired was a syndicated edit of &quot;The Best of The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; featuring the Beatles&#x27; American debut along with routines by Joan Rivers, Richard Pryor and Señor Wences. The show led off a launch-day lineup that rebroadcast numerous series premieres, pilot episodes and television firsts.
The network&#x27;s original lineup consisted of &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;; &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;; &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;; &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;; &quot;That Girl&quot;; &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot;; &quot;Honey West&quot;; &quot;The Addams Family&quot;; &quot;Love, American Style&quot;; &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;; &quot;Green Acres&quot;; &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;; and &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;.

The channel launched during a time when retransmission consent was becoming more common with subscription networks and terrestrial television stations nationwide as a result of a provision in the 1992 Cable Act. However, MTV Networks offered TV Land to subscription providers for free for its five years of operation if providers would agree to add the channel to their expanded basic tiers during the 1996 calendar year. USSB, then one of two services that used the DirecTV satellite, offered TV Land as a free channel to USSB and DirecTV satellite users, without requiring a subscription, for its first years on air.

Shortly after TV Land&#x27;s debut, MCA filed a lawsuit against Viacom. Because MCA&#x27;s original agreement with Paramount Pictures to operate USA Network prohibited either partner from operating other pay-television networks outside the joint venture, Viacom had been in breach of contract ever since the company bought Paramount in 1994, because it had operated MTV Networks (including Nickelodeon, MTV and VH1) since its founding in 1983, and Showtime Networks (owners of Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix) since it was founded in 1985. MCA claimed that the intention of TV Land was to compete directly with USA, a claim that turned out to be true. Viacom claimed that the matter had already been settled when Sumner Redstone released Frank Biondi from his contract to let him work at MCA. The suit was eventually settled when Viacom agreed to sell its 50% stake in USA Networks to MCA (MCA later became Universal Pictures, formerly just a subsidiary, which eventually merged with NBC and, later, Comcast).

In February 1999, according to Nielsen ratings data, TV Land averaged a 1.0 share during primetime, tying ESPN for tenth place among all pay-television networks. Its siblings, MTV and VH1, tied for 17th and 26th place respectively. Columnist John Dempsey reported in &quot;Variety:&quot; &quot;That February rating put TV Land into the top 10 for the first time since it began operating, and opened the eyes of the TV industry to the rich vein of golden-oldie TV shows that distributors are mining for an audience of nostalgia buffs and kids who are stumbling across the series for the first time.&quot;

=== Original programming efforts and shift to Generation X ===
The network first forayed into original scripted programming in 2010 with the debut of the sitcom &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; (starring established sitcom stars Valerie Bertinelli, Jane Leeves, Wendie Malick and Betty White), which premiered in June 2010 to 4.75 million viewers, a record audience for the channel. (The success of that series led to a spinoff called &quot;The Soul Man&quot;, which debuted in June 2012.) This was followed by the January 19, 2011, debut of &quot;Retired at 35&quot;.

In November 2014, amid growing allegations of sexual assault against Bill Cosby, the network removed reruns of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; from its lineup and deleted all references of the series from its website. A marathon of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; episodes that had been scheduled for Thanksgiving was also canceled. Episodes from the Steve Harvey run of &quot;Family Feud&quot; were aired instead.

The network began a programming transition in March 2015, when the new Sutton Foster series &quot;Younger&quot; was launched without either traditional network branding or advertising. After the series finale of &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;, a new logo was unveiled as part of a larger rebranding that saw TV Land shift its focus to Generation X viewers who grew into the network&#x27;s demographic. New original series &quot;Impastor&quot; and &quot;The Jim Gaffigan Show&quot; were unveiled as the network officially announced the rebranding on June 23, 2015. Completing the shift to edgier, single-camera programming, TV Land announced on July 28 that the upcoming fifth season of the multi-camera sitcom &quot;The Soul Man&quot; would be its last. Less than two weeks later, on August 10, TV Land&#x27;s last remaining multi-camera sitcom &quot;The Exes&quot; was canceled as its fourth season was still airing, and the final episode aired on September 16.

In July 2015, TV Land dropped reruns of &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; after the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the South Carolina State House because the flag is displayed atop the show&#x27;s car, the General Lee.

2016 saw the debut of the single-camera sitcom &quot;Teachers.

Since 2017, Viacom has been reorganizing its media businesses around six flagship brands, including Paramount Pictures, BET, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr. and MTV. Network president Keith Cox was reassigned to the newly rebranded Paramount Network (the former Spike), and two series originally slated for TV Land—&quot;American Woman&quot; and &quot;Heathers&quot;—were reassigned to the channel. The former was canceled after its first season, while the latter eventually aired in a heavily edited and redacted form. &quot;Younger&quot; was also supposed to move to Paramount Network for its sixth season, but the move was reversed before the newest season launched. The series would eventually move to Paramount+ and Hulu for its final season, with later airings on TV Land.

On August 20, 2019, two TV Land-branded channels, TV Land Drama and TV Land Sitcoms, were launched on Pluto TV, a free streaming service acquired by Viacom in March 2019. The latter channel was a rebrand of the former Pluto TV Sitcoms channel.

== Programming ==
TV Land&#x27;s programming originally focused on television series from the 1950s to the early 1980s. Such programming continues to air during the daytime hours, while the network&#x27;s primetime lineup focuses on both recent and contemporary sitcoms originating from the late 1990s. The network held its own annual award show, the TV Land Awards, from 2003 to 2016.

== Canadian version ==

In 2001, Craig Media launched a Category 2 pay-television specialty channel called TV Land Canada through a brand licensing agreement with Viacom (which later acquired a minority ownership stake in the channel months after its launch). On August 2, 2010, TV Land Canada was rebranded as Comedy Gold, reformatting the channel as an offshoot of The Comedy Network. The rebranded channel focuses primarily on sitcoms and sketch-comedy programs from the 1970s to the 1990s. Viacom sold back its stake in the channel to CTVglobemedia (which would later be acquired outright by minority shareholder BCE, Inc. on September 10 of that year to form Bell Media) following the rebrand. The channel was shuttered on September 1, 2019, after its broadcast license was sold to Wow Unlimited Media.

<text>Franz Friedrich Ernst Brünnow (18 November 1821 – 20 August 1891) was a German astronomer.

He was the first foreigner to become director of an American observatory, serving as director of Detroit Observatory (at the University of Michigan) from 1854 to 1863. He played a major role in establishing the study of astronomy in the United States at a time when the only other serious faculty was run by Benjamin Peirce at Harvard University. He introduced the teaching of rigorous German analytical methods and trained a number of students who went on to further American astronomy, including Asaph Hall and James Craig Watson (the latter succeeded him as director of Detroit Observatory). In addition, Charles Augustus Young learned German astronomical methods from Brünnow although he did not attend the University of Michigan.

He succeeded William R Hamilton as Andrews Professor of Astronomy at Trinity College Dublin and Royal Astronomer of Ireland at Dunsink Observatory.

== Early career ==
Brünnow was born in Berlin to Johann and Wilhelmine (née Weppler)
and attended the Friedrich Wilhelm Gymnasium. In 1839 he entered the University of Berlin, where he studied mathematics, astronomy and physics, as well as chemistry, philosophy and philology. After graduating as PhD in 1843 he took an active part in astronomical work at the Berlin Observatory, under the direction of Johann Franz Encke, contributing numerous important papers on the orbits of comets and minor planets to the &quot;Astronomische Nachrichten&quot;.

In 1847 he was appointed director of the Bilk Observatory, near Düsseldorf, and in the following year published the well-known &quot;Mémoire sur la comète elliptique de De Vico&quot;, for which he received the gold medal of the Amsterdam Academy. In 1851 he succeeded Johann Gottfried Galle as first assistant at the Berlin Observatory. Also in 1851 he wrote the textbook &quot;Lehrbuch der Sphärischen Astronomie&quot;, which he translated to English himself in 1865 as &quot;Handbook of Spherical Astronomy&quot;.

== Ann Arbor ==
He was recruited by University of Michigan president Henry Tappan and came to Ann Arbor in 1854 where he accepted the post of director of the new observatory (the Detroit Observatory). Some say he came to America to escape marrying Encke&#x27;s daughter. In the US he published, from 1858 to 1862, a journal entitled &quot;Astronomical Notices&quot;, while his tables of the minor planets Flora, Victoria and Iris were severally issued in 1857, 1859 and 1869. He married Tappan&#x27;s daughter Rebecca in 1857. In 1860 he went, as associate director of the observatory, to Albany, New York; but returned in 1861 to Michigan, and threw himself with vigour into the work of studying the astronomical and physical constants of the observatory and its instruments.

== Ireland and later years ==
He resigned in 1863 as a direct result of the dismissal of Tappan by the university&#x27;s regents and returned to Germany. Then, on the death of Sir William Rowan Hamilton in 1865, he accepted the post of Andrews Professor of Astronomy at Trinity College Dublin and Royal Astronomer of Ireland. His first undertaking at the Dublin Observatory was the erection of an equatorial telescope to carry the fine object-glass presented to the university by Sir James South; and on its completion, he began an important series of researches on stellar parallax. The first, second and third parts of the &quot;Astronomical Observations and Researches&quot; made at Dunsink contain the results of these labours, and include discussions of the distances of the stars α Lyrae, ο Draconis, Groombridge 1830, 85 Pegasi, and Bradley 3077, and of the planetary nebula H. iv. 37. In 1873 the observatory, on Brünnow&#x27;s recommendation, was provided with a first-class transit circle, which he proceeded to test as a preliminary to commencing an extended program of work with it. However, in 1874, as a result of failing health and eyesight, he resigned and retired to Basel. In 1880 he moved to Vevey, and in 1889 to Heidelberg, where he died on 20 August 1891. His headstone still stands in the &quot;Bergfriedhof&quot;, the old cemetery in Heidelberg.

== Legacy ==
The permanence of his reputation was secured by the merits of his &quot;Lehrbuch der sphärischen Astronomie&quot;, which were at once and widely appreciated. In 1860 part 1 was translated into English by Robert Main, the Radcliffe observer at Oxford; Brünnow himself published an English version in 1865; it reached in the original a fifth edition in 1881, and was also translated into French, Russian, Italian and Spanish.

<doc id="783787" wikidata="Q762363" url="?curid=783787" title="Area codes 201 and 551">
<text>Area codes 201 and 551 are telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) in the U.S. State of New Jersey. Area code 201 was the area code assigned to the entire state of New Jersey in 1947, when the North American area code system was formed. After splits in 1956, 1991, and 1997, it is assigned to the northeastern portion of the state, including most of Hudson and Bergen counties, bordering New York City. Major cities in the numbering plan area include Bayonne, Jersey City, Hoboken, Hackensack, Secaucus and Englewood. Area code 551 was added to this numbering plan area in 2001 in formation of an overlay. Area code 201 is also assigned for wireless services in some rate centers in the 973 and 908 numbering plan areas, such as Newark, Morristown, and New Brunswick.

==History==
Area code 201 was the first-assigned numbering plan area (NPA) code of the original 86 area codes when the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) devised the nationwide numbering plan in 1947. It was also the first area code with Direct Distance Dialing (DDD) service, when in 1951 the first direct-dialed long-distance call was made from Englewood, New Jersey to Alameda, California.
Area code 201 was originally assigned to the entire state of New Jersey, despite the state&#x27;s dense population, the highest in the nation. The bulk of New Jersey&#x27;s population is concentrated in the large metropolitan area west of New York City in the northeast and the suburbs of Philadelphia in the southwest. The geographic coverage of numbering plan areas was based on several criteria. A numbering plan area could only have a maximum of 540 central offices; larger states needed to be divided. In addition, the call routing infrastructure had to be suitable to be centrally coordinated by only one toll center without expensive back-haul arrangements. For the latter reason, by 1956, 201 was reduced to northern New Jersey, while the area from the state capital, Trenton, southward, including the southern Jersey Shore and the New Jersey side of the lower Delaware Valley, received area code 609. This separated the two population centers into distinct call routing systems for out-of-state long-distance calls. Despite the division with two area codes, all calls within the state of New Jersey were dialed without area codes until July 21, 1963, when office code protection was ended.

For over thirty years, area code 201 served Bergen, Hudson, Ocean, Essex, Union, Morris, Passaic, Hunterdon, Somerset, Middlesex, Monmouth, Sussex and Warren counties.

As the central region of New Jersey grew during the 1980s, the northeastern section of the state lost sizable portions of its population due to the decline of its major cities, including Newark, Paterson, Clifton, and Elizabeth. On June 8, 1991, area code 908 was created by a split of numbering plan area 201; it primarily serves the north-central regions of the state.

Within four years, 201 was close to exhaustion once again due to the proliferation of cell phones, pagers and fax machines. On June 1, 1997, Essex and Passaic counties, home to Newark and Paterson, respectively, the state&#x27;s largest and third-largest cities, as well as Morris and Sussex counties were split off with area code 973. This left Hudson and Bergen counties, the two most densely populated counties in the state and the closest to New York City, as the only counties in the 201 plan area.

Although the 1997 split was intended as a long-term solution, demand for new numbers continued in Hudson and Bergen counties, and another area code became necessary. Verizon, the dominant telephone company in New Jersey, lobbied for an overlay rather than a split. Overlays were a new concept at the time, and were controversial because they required implementation of ten-digit dialing. However, Verizon wanted to spare its customers the burden of changing telephone numbers.

Area code 551 was created in 2001 to overlay 201, along with area codes 862 and 848, which overlay area codes 973 and 732, respectively. With the implementation of the overlays on December 1, 2001, ten-digit dialing became mandatory in Northern New Jersey.

<doc id="783791" wikidata="Q1277018" url="?curid=783791" title="Richard Boone">
<text>Richard Allen Boone (June 18, 1917 – January 10, 1981) was an American actor who starred in over 50 films and was notable for his roles in Westerns, including his starring role in the television series &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;.

==Early life==
Boone was born in Los Angeles, California, the middle child of Cecile (née Beckerman) and Kirk E. Boone, a corporate lawyer and great-great-great-great-grandson of Squire Boone, frontiersman Daniel Boone&#x27;s brother. His mother was Jewish, the daughter of immigrants from Russia.

Richard Boone graduated from Hoover High School in Glendale, California. He attended Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, where he was a member of Theta Xi fraternity. He dropped out of Stanford prior to graduation and then worked as an oil rigger, bartender, painter, and writer. In 1941, Boone joined the United States Navy and served on three ships in the Pacific during World War II, seeing combat as an aviation ordnanceman, aircrewman, and tail gunner on Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers, and ended his service with the rank of petty officer first class.

==Acting career==
===Early training===
In his youth, Boone had attended the San Diego Army and Navy Academy in Carlsbad, California, where he was introduced to theatre under the tutelage of Virginia Atkinson.

After the war, Boone used the G.I. Bill to study acting at the Actors Studio in New York.
===Broadway===
&quot;Serious&quot; and &quot;methodical&quot;, Boone debuted on the Broadway theatrical scene in 1947 with &quot;Medea&quot;, starring Judith Anderson and John Gielgud; it ran for 214 performances. He was then in a production of &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1948). Boone appeared in a short-lived TV series based on the play &quot;The Front Page&quot; (1949–50), and on anthology series such as &quot;Actors Studio&quot; and &quot;Suspense.&quot;

He returned to Broadway in &quot;The Man&quot; (1950), directed by Martin Ritt, with Dorothy Gish; it ran for 92 performances.

Elia Kazan used Boone to feed lines to an actress for a film screen-test done for director Lewis Milestone. Milestone was not impressed with the actress, but he was impressed enough with Boone&#x27;s voice to summon him to Hollywood, where he was given a seven-year contract with Fox.

===20th Century Fox===
In 1950, Boone made his screen debut as a Marine officer in Milestone&#x27;s &quot;Halls of Montezuma&quot; (1951). Fox used him in military parts in &quot;Call Me Mister&quot; (1951) and &quot;The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel&quot; (1951). He had bigger roles in &quot;Red Skies of Montana&quot; (1952), &quot;Return of the Texan&quot; (1952), &quot;Kangaroo&quot; (1952; directed by Milestone), and &quot;Way of a Gaucho&quot; (1952). His role in &quot;Kangaroo&quot; was greatly expanded from what it was in the original script.

Elia Kazan directed him in &quot;Man on a Tightrope&quot; (1953). He had solid parts in &quot;Vicki&quot; (1953) and &quot;City of Bad Men&quot; (1953). In 1953, he played Pontius Pilate in &quot;The Robe&quot;, the first Cinemascope film. He had only one scene in the film, in which he gives instructions to Richard Burton, who plays the centurion ordered to crucify Christ. Boone also appeared in the second Cinemascope film, &quot;Beneath the 12-Mile Reef&quot; (1953). Boone made two films for Panoramic, which distributed through Fox: &quot;The Siege at Red River&quot; (1954) and &quot;The Raid&quot; (1954). He then left the studio, breaking his contract.

===&quot;Medic&quot;===
During the filming of &quot;Halls of Montezuma&quot;, he befriended Jack Webb, who was then producing and starring in &quot;Dragnet&quot;. Boone appeared in the film version of &quot;Dragnet&quot; (1954).

Webb was preparing a series about a doctor for NBC. From 1954–56, Boone became a familiar face in the lead role of that medical drama, titled &quot;Medic,&quot; and in 1955 received an Emmy nomination for Best Actor Starring in a Regular Series.

While on &quot;Medic,&quot; Boone continued to appear in films and guest-star on television shows. He was cast in Westerns such as &quot;Ten Wanted Men&quot; (1955) with Randolph Scott, &quot;Man Without a Star&quot; (1955) with Kirk Douglas, &quot;Robbers&#x27; Roost&quot; (1955) with George Montgomery, &quot;Battle Stations&quot; (1955) with John Lund, &quot;Star in the Dust&quot; (1956) with John Agar, and &quot;Away All Boats&quot; (1956) with Jeff Chandler.

He also guest-starred on &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, &quot;Matinee Theatre&quot; (a production of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;), &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot;, &quot;Studio One in Hollywood&quot;, and &quot;Climax!&quot;

Boone had one of his best roles in &quot;The Tall T&quot; (1957) with Randolph Scott. He co-starred with Eleanor Parker in &quot;Lizzie&quot; (1957) and was a villain in &quot;The Garment Jungle&quot; (1957).

===&quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;===
Boone&#x27;s next television series, &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;, made him a national star because of his role as Paladin, the intelligent and sophisticated, but tough gun-for-hire in the late 19th-century American West. The show had first been offered to actor Randolph Scott, who turned it down and gave the script to Boone while they were making &quot;Ten Wanted Men.&quot; The show ran from 1957 to 1963, with Boone receiving more Emmy nominations in 1959 and 1960.

During the show&#x27;s run, Boone starred in the film &quot;I Bury the Living&quot; (1958) and appeared on Broadway in 1959, starring as Abraham Lincoln in &quot;The Rivalry&quot;, which ran for 81 performances.

He occasionally did other acting appearances such as episodes of &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; and &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot; and TV movie &quot;The Right Man&quot; (1960). He had a cameo as Sam Houston in &quot;The Alamo&quot; (1960), a starring role in &quot;A Thunder of Drums&quot; (1961) and narrated a TV version of &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot;.

Boone was an occasional guest panelist and also a mystery guest on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, the Sunday-night CBS-TV quiz show. On that show, he talked with host John Charles Daly about their days working together on the TV show &quot;The Front Page.&quot;

===&quot;The Richard Boone Show&quot;===
Boone had his own television anthology, &quot;The Richard Boone Show&quot;. Although it aired only from 1963 to 1964, he received his fourth Emmy nomination for it in 1964 along with &quot;The Danny Kaye Show&quot; and &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show.&quot; &quot;The Richard Boone Show&quot; won a Golden Globe for Best Show in 1964.

===Hawaii===

After the end of the run of his weekly show, Boone and his family moved to Honolulu, Hawaii.

He returned to the mainland to appear in films such as &quot;Rio Conchos&quot; (1964), &quot;The War Lord&quot; (1965) with Charlton Heston, &quot;Hombre&quot; (1967) with Paul Newman, and an episode of &quot;Cimarron Strip&quot;. The latter was the first time he guest-starred on someone else&#x27;s show and he did it as a favor for the director, friend Lamont Johnson. &quot;It&#x27;s harder and harder to do your best work on TV,&quot; he said.

In 1965, he came in third in the Laurel Award for &quot;Rio Conchos&quot; in Best Action Performance; Sean Connery won first place with &quot;Goldfinger&quot; and Burt Lancaster won second place with &quot;The Train&quot;. 

While he was living on Oahu, Boone helped persuade Leonard Freeman to film &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; exclusively in Hawaii. Prior to that, Freeman had planned to do &quot;establishing&quot; location shots in Hawaii, but principal production in Southern California. Boone and others convinced Freeman that the islands could offer all necessary support for a major TV series and would provide an authenticity otherwise unobtainable.

Freeman, impressed by Boone&#x27;s love of Hawaii, offered him the role of Steve McGarrett; Boone turned it down, however, and the role went to Jack Lord, who shared Boone&#x27;s enthusiasm for the state, which Freeman considered vital. Coincidentally, Lord had appeared alongside Boone in the first episode of &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel,&quot; titled &quot;Three Bells to Perdido&quot;. 

At the time, Boone had shot a pilot for CBS called &quot;Kona Coast&quot; (1968), which he hoped CBS would adopt as a series (&quot;I really don&#x27;t want to do another series,&quot; he said &quot;but I&#x27;ve been battling for three years to get production going in Hawaii and if a series will do it, I&#x27;ll do it.&quot;), but the network went instead only with &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;. &quot;Kona Coast&quot; – which Boone co produced – was released theatrically.

===Films===
Boone then focused on films: &quot;The Night of the Following Day&quot; (1969) with Marlon Brando, &quot;The Arrangement&quot; (1969) with Douglas for Elia Kazan, &quot;The Kremlin Letter&quot; (1970) for John Huston, and &quot;Big Jake&quot; (1971) with John Wayne.

Boone did some TV movies, &quot;In Broad Daylight&quot; (1971), &quot;Deadly Harvest&quot; (1972), and &quot;Goodnight, My Love&quot; (1972). Around this time he moved to Florida.

===&quot;Hec Ramsey&quot;===
In the early 1970s, Boone starred in the short-lived TV series &quot;Hec Ramsey,&quot; which Jack Webb produced for Mark VII Limited Productions, and which was about a turn-of-the-20th-century Western-style police detective who preferred to use his brain and criminal forensic skills instead of his gun. The character Ramsey&#x27;s back story had him as a frontier lawman and gunman in his younger days. Older now, he was the deputy chief of police of a small city in Oklahoma, still a skilled shooter, and carrying a short-barreled Colt Single Action Army revolver. Boone said to an interviewer in 1972, &quot;You know, Hec Ramsey is a lot like Paladin, only fatter.&quot;

=== Israel ===
Boone starred in the 1970 film &quot;Madron&quot; (1970), the first Israeli-produced film shot outside Israel, set in the American West of the 1800s. In that year, he accepted an invitation from Israel&#x27;s Commerce Ministry to provide the Israeli film industry with &quot;Hollywood know-how&quot;. In 1979, he received an award from Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin &quot;for his contribution to Israeli cinema&quot;.

===Final performances===
He starred in The Great Niagara (1974) and &quot;Against a Crooked Sky&quot; (1975) and supported John Wayne a third time, in Wayne&#x27;s final film, &quot;The Shootist&quot; (1976). In the mid-1970s, Boone returned to The Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City, where he had once studied acting, to teach.

Boone did &quot;God&#x27;s Gun&quot; (1976) with Leif Garrett, Lee Van Cleef, and Jack Palance. He appeared in &quot;The Last Dinosaur&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1978), and provided the character voice of the dragon Smaug in the 1977 animated film version of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.

Boone&#x27;s last appearances were in &quot;Winter Kills&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Bushido Blade&quot; (1979).

==Personal life==
Boone was married three times: to Jane Hopper (1937–1940), Mimi Kelly (1949–1950), and Claire McAloon (from 1951 until his death). His son with McAloon, Peter Boone, worked as a child actor in several &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot; episodes. 

In 1963, Boone was injured in a car accident.

Boone moved to St. Augustine, Florida, from Hawaii in 1970 and worked with the annual local production of &quot;Cross and Sword&quot;, when he was not acting on television or in movies, until shortly before his death in 1981. In the last year of his life, Boone was appointed Florida&#x27;s cultural ambassador.

During the 1970s, he wrote a newspaper column, called &quot;It Seems to Me&quot;, for a small, free publication called &quot;The Town and Traveler&quot;. Some paper copies are in his biographical file at the St. Augustine Historical Society. He also gave acting lectures at Flagler College in 1972–1973.

==Death==
Boone died at his home in St. Augustine, Florida on January 10, 1981 due to complications from throat cancer. His ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean off Hawaii.

<text>Marathon Motor Works was a brass era automobile manufacturer based in Tennessee. Southern Engine and Boiler Works founded in 1889, which made industrial engines and boilers in Jackson, Tennessee, established the factory in 1907. From 1909 to 1914, the company manufactured the Marathon automobile in Nashville, Tennessee.

==History==
Southern Engine and Boiler Works engineer, William Henry Collier, developed a gasoline engine and prototype automobile in 1906. Southern Engine built a few automobiles to Collier&#x27;s design before expanding to a plant in Nashville. The Marathon Motor Works were established from a cotton mill complex.

Southern Engine decided to engineer and build every part of its automobile in-house. The vehicles had been marketed as Southerns at first, but another firm was using that name. In 1910, Marathon Motor Works was created to produce the Marathon automobile, named out of the enthusiasm for things Greek which had grown out of the 1904 Olympics. 

1909 saw a two-model lineup, roadster and touring car, powered by 35 HP 4-cylinder engines. Both were open bodies (tops were optional) and sold for about $1,500. By 1912 production reached 200 cars monthly.

Marathons acquired a good reputation for quality and durability due to the factory controlling all parts, engineering and manufacturing. Demand exceeded supply, but financial improprieties were alleged and receivership soon followed. H. H. Brooks, General Sales Manager, arranged for &quot;Marathon&quot; sales to be handled by the Herff Brothers in 1913. The Herff-Brooks Corporation purchased the Marathon machinery and moved production and many workers to Richmond, Indiana.

== Museum and Building ==
On the National Register of Historic Places, the preserved building has a museum and shops. Although only nine &quot;Marathons&quot; are known to have survived, five of these are currently in the Marathon building&#x27;s museum.In 2008, a mystery novel called &quot;The Marathon Murders&quot; was published by Nashville author Chester Campbell. Although the murder itself is fictional, the book uses the documented disagreements and possible dishonesty among the board and executives to provide a plausible motive.

The Marathon Motor Works building houses an antique store called Antique Archaeology (the business at the center of the television series &quot;American Pickers&quot;).

Marathon Music Works is a mid-sized music venue &amp; event space located in Marathon Village. The venue&#x27;s name was selected through a local community process. Residents of Nashville submitted their ideas and the chosen name pays tribute to the building&#x27;s previous use as Marathon Motor Works.

<doc id="783804" wikidata="Q2056546" url="?curid=783804" title="Pat Oliphant">
<text>Patrick Bruce &quot;Pat&quot; Oliphant (born 24 July 1935) is an Australian-born American artist whose career spanned more than sixty years. His body of work primarily focuses on American and global politics, culture, and corruption; he is particularly known for his caricatures of American presidents and other powerful leaders. Over the course of his long career, Oliphant produced thousands of daily editorial cartoons, dozens of bronze sculptures, and a large oeuvre of drawings and paintings. He retired in 2015.

==Early life and education==
Oliphant was born on 24 July 1935, in Maylands, a suburb of Adelaide, Australia, to Donald Knox Oliphant and Grace Lillian Oliphant (née Price) of Rosslyn Park. He was raised in a small cabin in Aldgate, in the Adelaide Hills. His father worked as a draftsman for the government, and Oliphant credited him with sparking his interest in drawing. His early education took place in a one-room schoolhouse, followed by Unley High School.

==Career==
In 1952, while still a teenager, Oliphant began his career in journalism as a copy boy at Adelaide&#x27;s evening tabloid newspaper, &quot;The News&quot;, which had recently been inherited by Rupert Murdoch. He had no interest in attending college, as he had an ambivalent relationship with formal education and already knew he wanted to be a journalist. In 1955, he moved to &quot;The News&quot;&#x27; rival, &quot;The Advertiser&quot;, a morning broadsheet with 200,000 subscribers.

Before long, editors noticed his interest in drawing, and he began producing both cartoons and illustrations. However, the paper&#x27;s conservative editorial policies frustrated him, and after frequent vetoes of his commentaries on Australian politics, he learned that cartoons on international affairs were less likely to be censored. During this period, he found inspiration in the work of English cartoonist Ronald Searle, Western Australian cartoonist Paul Rigby, and the political commentary in &quot;Mad&quot; magazine, which he described as a &quot;shot in the arm.&quot;

===&quot;The Denver Post&quot;===
In 1959, Oliphant traveled to the United States and Great Britain to learn about cartooning in those countries. He decided he wanted to move to the United States, but he had to wait five years until his contract with &quot;The Advertiser&quot; expired. In 1964, while preparing to move without a job, he learned that cartoonist Paul Conrad was leaving the &quot;Denver Post&quot;. Oliphant sent a portfolio of work to the &quot;Post&quot; and was hired over 50 American applicants. He moved to the United States with his wife, Hendrika DeVries, and their two children. The &quot;Post&quot; featured a small snippet of Oliphant&#x27;s cartoon on the front page as a &quot;teaser&quot; for what would be found on the editorial page.

Announcing his arrival, &quot;Time&quot; magazine stated, &quot;Few U.S. cartoonists have so deftly distilled the spirit of [Lyndon B. Johnson and Barry Goldwater] as Australia&#x27;s Patrick Bruce Oliphant, 29, a recent arrival who has not yet set eyes on either Johnson or Goldwater.&quot; Less than a year after Oliphant began working at the &quot;Denver Post&quot;, in April 1965, his work was syndicated internationally by the Los Angeles Times Syndicate. Oliphant&#x27;s reputation grew rapidly, and in 1967, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning for his 1 February 1966 cartoon &quot;They Won&#x27;t Get Us To The Conference Table... Will They?&quot; In this cartoon, Ho Chi Minh is depicted carrying the body of a dead Vietnamese man in the posture of a &quot;Pietà&quot;. Oliphant had intentionally submitted what he considered one of the weakest cartoons he had published that year. When it won, he criticized the Pulitzer board, stating that they had selected the cartoon for its subject matter rather than the quality of the work. He refused to be considered for the award again and became a regular critic of the Pulitzer.

According to Ralph Steadman, Oliphant would have been Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s &quot;first choice of a &#x27;cartoonist collaborator.&#x27;&quot;

===&quot;The Washington Star&quot;===
In 1975, Oliphant moved to &quot;The Washington Star&quot;, attracted by editor Jim Bellows. In 1980, he switched syndication companies, joining Universal Press Syndicate. The &quot;Star&quot; ceased publication in 1981.

===Independent work===
After &quot;The Washington Star&quot; folded, Oliphant received offers from other newspapers but chose to remain independent, relying on the earnings from his extensive syndication. He was the first political cartoonist in the twentieth century to work independently from a home newspaper, which provided him with unique independence from editorial control. By this time, he had become a nationally recognized figure. In 1976, a survey of 188 cartoonists found that fellow professionals regarded Oliphant as the &quot;best all-around cartoonist&quot; on the editorial pages. A decade later, a similar survey reached the same conclusion, noting Oliphant&#x27;s original and influential aesthetic. By 1983, Oliphant was the most widely syndicated American political cartoonist, with his work appearing in more than 500 newspapers. His work influenced the field&#x27;s overall appearance. For example, when he stopped using Duoshade, a chemical process for creating textured backgrounds, in the early 1980s, other cartoonists followed suit. In 1990, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described him as &quot;the most influential editorial cartoonist now working.&quot;

In 1979, Oliphant was naturalized as an American citizen. In 1983, he married his second wife, Mary Ann Kuhn, but they divorced in 1994. He married Susan C. Conway in 1996, and they remain married today.

By 1995, Oliphant had reduced the frequency of his daily cartoons to four days a week. At this time, he began submitting his cartoons in digital form as scans of his original drawings. By 2014, he was submitting three cartoons a week.

In 2004, Oliphant moved from Washington, D.C. to Santa Fe, New Mexico.

In 2012, Oliphant was the Roy Lichtenstein Artist in Residence at the American Academy in Rome for three months.

In January 2015, Oliphant retired from publishing syndicated cartoons. However, in February 2017, he came out of retirement with two cartoons for &quot;The Nib&quot; featuring Donald Trump and Steve Bannon. One cartoon depicted Trump as a childlike member of the Hitler Youth, asking a ghoulish Bannon what he thought of his outfit.

==Style==
Oliphant&#x27;s earliest cartoons in Australia often mimicked the style of his elders, but his mature style is easily identifiable and distinctive. His caricatured subjects are immediately recognizable and are made &quot;grotesque&quot; through &quot;extreme distortion.&quot; He is recognized for his skilled drafting, and for his innovative use of the horizontal format in editorial cartoons. As Rick Marschall noted in 1999, &quot;Oliphant offered a style totally his own and revolutionary in the field. The Oliphant look—long-faced characters, sparse use of icons and labels, arresting &#x27;camera angles&#x27;—still dominates the field, at least in the minds of cartoonists who aspire to Oliphant&#x27;s unflagging brilliance.&quot; Curator Harry Katz has called him &quot;one of history&#x27;s finest comic artists.&quot;

Oliphant has specialized in caricaturing American presidents, and multiple exhibitions have featured his work organized by presidential administration. He developed specific tropes for various presidents: His dark, brooding Nixon is sometimes depicted naked and ashamed, covering his privates like Adam and Eve, and at other times making the &quot;Victory&quot; sign. Oliphant regularly portrayed the accident-prone Gerald Ford with a bandage on his forehead. His fondness for Ronald Reagan did not prevent him from portraying the president as an oblivious buffoon in a parody of one of his films. George H. W. Bush sometimes appears clutching a handbag and at other times is swathed in cloth as &quot;Bush of Arabia.&quot; During the Clinton administration, Oliphant regularly used Socks the cat and Buddy the dog as a sort of &quot;Greek chorus&quot; to comment on the events. He famously portrayed Barack Obama as an Easter Island head worshiped by voters. Oliphant found that it took time to find the right look for a new president, noting, &quot;I hate changes of Administrations. It takes six months to &#x27;get&#x27; a new man.&quot;

===&quot;Punk&quot;===
Early in his career, Oliphant began to include a small penguin in almost every one of his political cartoons. This character, which he named Punk, joined a tradition of such secondary figures, termed &quot;dingbats&quot; by cartoonist R. C. Harvey. These figures appear in the work of earlier cartoonists such as Fred O. Seibel of the &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot;, whose cartoons featured a small, ironic crow, and earlier by W.K. (William Keevil) Patrick of the &quot;New Orleans Times-Democrat&quot; and later &quot;Times-Picayune&quot;, who had a signature duck character. Punk was inspired by a penguin brought back by a colleague from South Australia&#x27;s south coast, who delivered the penguin to the zoo. Oliphant decided to include a penguin in his cartoon as a result. Initially, Punk was depicted as an easily identifiable Adelie penguin, but he soon became stylized and remained so throughout Oliphant&#x27;s career. Punk adds a layer of commentary to the subject of the cartoon, and is often placed in conversation with another tiny figure. Punk proved popular with both adults and children, who enjoyed the game of finding him in each cartoon. In 1984, Oliphant briefly drew a full-color comic strip featuring Punk for the Sunday funnies, titled &quot;Sunday Punk&quot;, but found the work too laborious and soon discontinued the strip.

Oliphant originally created Punk as a space for subversion in the conservative editorial environment of the &quot;Adelaide Advertiser&quot;. Punk provided a platform for Oliphant&#x27;s own opinions, while the overall cartoon needed to align with the views of the paper&#x27;s editors. Punk&#x27;s perspective varies from cartoon to cartoon: sometimes bemused, sometimes ironic, and sometimes trenchant, and does not always represent Oliphant&#x27;s personal viewpoint.

==Courting controversy==
Oliphant&#x27;s cartoons are rarely warm towards their subjects. He has often stated that his job is to criticize, and he deliberately avoids getting to know his subjects for fear of liking them. He intentionally courts backlash, saying in Rolling Stone in 1976, &quot;This really isn&#x27;t a business ... it&#x27;s a cause. I&#x27;m an outcast because of it. A writer can’t really say, &#x27;This man&#x27;s an idiot,&#x27; because the law holds him back. We can say it.&quot;

Oliphant has often remarked on his intention to draw criticism from all political perspectives and has indeed received strong criticism from ethnic and religious groups for some of his cartoons. In 2001, the Asian American Journalists Association accused Oliphant of &quot;cross[ing] the line from acerbic depiction to racial caricature.&quot;

In 2005, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee expressed concern that some of Oliphant&#x27;s caricatures were racist and misleading. In 2007, two Oliphant cartoons produced similar responses. One cartoon about Israel&#x27;s December 2008 offensive against Hamas in Gaza sparked criticism among some American Jews. The cartoon featured a jackbooted, headless figure representing Israel in a goosestepping posture, looming over a small female figure holding a baby labeled &quot;Gaza.&quot; The Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center said the cartoon denigrated and demonized Israel and mimicked Nazi propaganda. It called on the &quot;New York Times&quot; and other media outlets to remove the cartoon from their websites.

A 2005 cartoon showing Condoleezza Rice as a parrot perched on George W. Bush&#x27;s shoulder was criticized by some readers for depicting her with buck teeth and exaggerated lips.

Oliphant&#x27;s cartoons featuring Catholic scandals have also been controversial. The Catholic League has called him &quot;one of the most viciously anti-Catholic editorial cartoonists ever to have disgraced the pages of American newspapers.&quot; On Christmas Eve 1993, Catholic readers were angered by a cartoon associating Michael Jackson and priests with child molestation. One of his most famous cartoons, &quot;Celebration of Spring at St. Pedophilia&#x27;s – the Annual Running of the Altar Boys,&quot; sparked nationwide debates in print, radio, and television when it was published on 20 March 2002. The New York Times and Washington Post, as well as other papers, chose not to include the cartoon online, while some did not run it at all.

In 1987, Oliphant protested the selection of Berkeley Breathed for the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning. Oliphant&#x27;s concern was that Breathed&#x27;s work &quot;has, so far as I know, not appeared on one editorial page in the country.&quot; Addressing the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists convention to hearty applause, Oliphant represented the views of many of his colleagues: that the seriousness of editorial cartooning as a journalistic pursuit was at risk and that the Pulitzer was encouraging the valuing of humor over political statement.

==Non-newspaper drawings==
Newspaper editorial cartoons were not Oliphant&#x27;s only genre. In his early days in Australia, he produced a wide variety of newspaper illustrations. Later in his career, he created illustrations for numerous books, and his work, often in full color, was featured in the pages and on the covers of many magazines. For a time, he drew cartoons for Rolling Stone; this body of work was intended for a different audience than his newspaper cartoons and was often more graphic or intentionally offensive than his syndicated work. In the 1990s, he drew for a Northwest Airlines advertising campaign advocating the &quot;open skies&quot; policy concept. (Oliphant has flown privately and holds a pilot&#x27;s certificate.) By the early 1980s, Oliphant had begun producing sculpture in addition to his editorial cartoons. In 1988, he started attending William Christenberry&#x27;s figure drawing classes at the Corcoran School of Art. His work in various media has been featured in several exhibitions, most notably at the National Portrait Gallery. He has worked in pen and ink, oil, lithography, and other media.

==Sculpture==
Oliphant began working in bronze in the early 1980s and produced a significant body of work throughout the remainder of his career. His bronze caricatures have been favorably compared with those of the nineteenth-century French caricaturist Honoré Daumier. Oliphant&#x27;s bronzes often depict heads, busts, or full-figure portraits of major political figures, although he also sculpted animals, various human types, and compositions featuring multiple figures. His sculptures vary in scale, from a diminutive Jimmy Carter to a larger-than-life depiction of Angelina Eberly, an important figure in the famous Texas Archive War, which is located on the sidewalk along Congress Avenue in Austin, Texas, near the Capitol.

<text>Rock Werchter is an annual music festival held in the village of Werchter, near Leuven, Belgium, since 1976 and is a large sized rock music festival. The 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2012 and 2014 festivals received the Arthur award for &quot;best festival in the world&quot; at the International Live Music Conference (ILMC). It can host 88,000 guests daily, of which 67,500 combine all four days, to add up to a total maximum of 149,500 different attendees.

The festival started in 1974 as a one-day event with performances from Banzai and Kandahar, but over the years it has evolved to become one of Belgium&#x27;s largest music festivals. Originally it was a double-festival, called &quot;Torhout-Werchter&quot;, with two festival areas at different sites in Belgium: one in Werchter and one in Torhout. In 1999, the festival dropped the Torhout site and since then has taken place only in Werchter. Since 2003 Werchter has been a 4-day festival, as it was sold by owner Herman Schueremans to American organizers Live Nation. Schueremans however remains the main organizer of the event. The festival is organized every first weekend of the summer vacation in Belgium (last weekend of June or the first of July).

In recent years, there has been controversy about rising ticket prices. Because of this, Schueremans was heckled during an appearance on HUMO&#x27;s Pop Poll, a Belgian alternative award show. At €200 for four days (€18 extra to include camping or €25 for xl-camping) in 2012, it was still considered a relatively inexpensive music festival.

The camping sites officially open at 8am on the first day of the festival, but because of guests arriving early and camping on the street, the organizers have traditionally been forced to open the camping sites early - sometimes more than 24 hours. The campsites are located along the three main entrance roads into Werchter (from Haacht, Aarschot and Leuven), most of them within one kilometer of the festival site, but some located as far as 3 kilometers away. In 2011, for the first time, XL camping tickets are available, allowing festival goers to arrive and camp from 4pm on the Wednesday before the festival.

Until the 1990s, the festival attracted mostly Flemish festival goers, but in recent years it has become more and more international with an especially large influx of Dutch, French, Walloon and British visitors, with notable Australian, South African and other contingents. Belgians alternatively go to the Pukkelpop and Dour festivals.

All graphics of Rock Werchter, including the posters, were designed by Tom Hautekiet, who died in April 2020.

==History==

The festival started off as a one-day event, then named &quot;Torhout-Werchter&quot; festival, becoming a two-day festival in 1996, a 3-day festival in 2000, and a 4-day festival named &quot;Rock Werchter&quot; since 2003.

Before 1995, when the festival was still a double-festival, it had one stage with 8 or 9 bands performing twice, once in Torhout and once in Werchter. Since 1995 the Main stage was accompanied by a second stage. This stage was an open-air stage until 1999 when it was made a tent named &#x27;Pyramid Marquee&#x27;, with a capacity of 6,000 people. The performers in Pyramid Marquee are usually lesser-known or aimed at a specific audience. Sometimes groups that do well in Pyramid Marquee are expected to have a hard time taking the step to the Main stage, especially when they are seen as an act needing intimate, smaller venues. Sigur Rós is the most famous example of this, when they were programmed on Main Stage in 2008 after their 2006 performance in Pyramid Marquee, but they managed the transition and were hailed as one of the best performances of the festival.

In 2012, a new third stage was added, called &quot;The Barn&quot; which is translated to &quot;De Schuur&quot; in Dutch, a reference to the nickname of organiser Herman Schueremans. The new tent – with a capacity of 10,000 – is meant for the more intimate concerts on Rock Werchter, like Beirut in 2012.

In 2013, Pyramid Marquee was replaced by a new bigger tent, named &quot;KluB C&quot;.

The bands presented at Rock Werchter are traditionally a balanced mix of well known artists, popular crowd-pleasing acts and local Belgian acts. Belgian band Deus in 2008 was the first local band to close the Main Stage on the last day for several years. The days usually start around noon and end around 1am. At the end of the last day there is a big fireworks show.

===TW Classic===

Since 2002, the organizers created TW Classic as a tribute to the early days of Rock Werchter. TW Classic (&#x27;TW&#x27;, as in Torhout-Werchter, is the traditional abbreviation of the festival) is a one day/one stage festival held one week after the main event. It usually programs veteran acts like Bruce Springsteen, Phil Collins, The Police, Depeche Mode or Simple Minds, supplemented with younger mainstream Belgian acts. In 2014, The Rolling Stones headlined TW Classic as one of their few festival concerts of 2014. In 2015, Robbie Williams headlined with his Let Me Entertain You Tour, and in 2016 Bruce Springsteen returned to the stage.

===Werchter Boutique===

This new festival was created in 2008 and organised one week after the main festival. It mainly aims at complete families with acts for children, teenagers as well as adults. The main acts in 2008 were Tokio Hotel, Santana and Doe Maar. In 2009 was centered on a concert of Madonna during her Sticky &amp; Sweet Tour. In all, 68,000 tickets were sold for the concert, making it a one-day sell-out event. In 2010 Prince made one of his only 3 stops in Europe as the headliner. In 2012, it was headlined by metal band Metallica, supported by various heavy metal and rock bands like Gojira, Mastodon and Soundgarden. Muse performed there during their 2013 Unsustainable Tour, with Belgian bands Balthazar and SX as support. In 2016, Rihanna was planned to headline the event, but a shortage of police forces on the planned day because of the Belgian national holiday led to the 2016 event being cancelled, with Rihanna rescheduled to appear a month later at Pukkelpop.

===Main Square Festival===

Since 2008, the organizers created a small version of Rock Werchter on the central square of Arras, in northern France. It is held on the same dates as Rock Werchter, with a similar line-up - which is an advantage for organisers as they can offer artists two shows instead of one. Arras was chosen as a location because of its large historic central square and because of the lack of big rock festivals in France.

<doc id="783835" wikidata="Q1012507" url="?curid=783835" title="Fleetwood">
<text>Fleetwood is a coastal town in the Borough of Wyre in Lancashire, England, at the northwest corner of the Fylde. It had a population of 25,939 at the 2011 census.

Fleetwood acquired its modern character in the 1830s, when the principal landowner Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood, High Sheriff and MP, conceived an ambitious plan to re-develop the town to make it a busy seaport and railway spur. He commissioned the Victorian architect Decimus Burton to design a number of substantial civic buildings, including two lighthouses. Hesketh-Fleetwood&#x27;s transport terminus schemes failed to materialise. The town expanded greatly in the first half of the 20th century with the growth of the fishing industry, and passenger ferries to the Isle of Man, to become a deep-sea fishing port.

Decline of the fishing industry began in the 1960s, hastened by the Cod Wars with Iceland, though fish processing is still a major economic activity in Fleetwood. The town&#x27;s most significant employer today is Lofthouse of Fleetwood, manufacturer of the lozenge Fisherman&#x27;s Friend which is exported around the world.

==History==

Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geographia&quot; in the 2nd century AD records a tribe known as the Setantii living in what is believed to be present-day West Lancashire, and a seaport built by the Romans called &quot;PORTVS SETANTIORVM&quot; (&#x27;the port of the Setantii&#x27;) abutting &quot;Moricambe Aestuarium&quot; (presumably Morecambe Bay). There is also evidence of a Roman road running from Ribchester to Kirkham ( southeast of Fleetwood) which then makes a sharp turn to the northwest. Together, these suggest that Fleetwood may well have been the location of this Roman port. No direct evidence of the port has been found, but in 2007, an Iron Age settlement was discovered at Bourne Hill, just south of present-day Fleetwood, suggesting the area was populated in pre-Roman times.

There is evidence that the eastern side of the River Wyre was occupied during the Danish invasions of the 9th and 10th centuries. By the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, the land on which Fleetwood now stands was part of the Hundred of Amounderness.

A manor house at present-day Rossall, in the southwest of the town, was in the possession of the Allen family by the time of Henry VIII. The Allens were prominent Roman Catholics, and Henry VIII repossessed the land. Cardinal William Allen was born at the manor house in 1532. It was ultimately sold to Thomas Fleetwood, comptroller of the Royal Mint, whose son Edmund, expanded the house into Rossall Hall. The land remained in the Fleetwood family for 300 years.

===19th century===
By the 1830s, the house and estate was in the ownership of Edmund&#x27;s descendant Peter Hesketh, High Sheriff of Lancashire and MP for Preston. A man of somewhat liberal views for his time, Hesketh believed that the sheltered harbour and views over Morecambe Bay gave the area the makings of a busy seaport and popular resort for the less-affluent. With no rail link between London and Scotland, he envisaged Fleetwood as the transfer point between the railway and the steamers to Scotland, and set about encouraging a railway link from Preston. With a new career in parliament to prepare for, he engaged Frederick Kemp as his agent. He originally considered naming the new town &quot;Wyreton&quot; or &quot;New Liverpool&quot;, but after changing his name to Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood in 1831, he settled on the name &quot;Fleetwood&quot;. After some delays, he recruited the prominent architect Decimus Burton, whose work in St Leonard&#x27;s-on-Sea he had admired, to lay out what would be the first planned town of the Victorian era. The plans were complete by 1835, and construction of the first buildings and the railway line began in 1836.
Burton&#x27;s plan was to use the largest of the sand-dunes on the north-facing shore as the focus of a half-wheel street layout. This was landscaped, and became known as the Mount. It served as the hub of Burton&#x27;s half-wheel design, the main residential streets acted as the spokes, and the main commerce area of Dock Street was the rim of the wheel. The oldest surviving building in the town, once the custom house, later the town hall and latterly Fleetwood Museum, dates from 1836 and housing from as early as 1838 still exists in the town. The crown jewel was the North Euston Hotel, built in 1841, a fine semi-circular building overlooking the bay and the river&#x27;s estuary. The hotel was built to serve overnight guests making the railway journey from Euston, and was close to the point of departure for the steamers to Scotland. This journey was made by Queen Victoria in 1847, but by the mid-1850s the completion of the western railway link between London and Scotland over Shap Fell rendered Fleetwood&#x27;s role as a transport terminus obsolete.

Burton designed two lighthouses for the town: The Upper Lighthouse, usually referred to as the Pharos (after the Pharos of Alexandria in Egypt, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World), can be seen for and Beach Lighthouse is visible for . Both opened in 1840. A third lighthouse, Wyre Light, built in 1839–40 by blind engineer Alexander Mitchell, offshore on the northeast corner of North Wharf, was the first screw pile lighthouse to be built in Great Britain. Fleetwood is the only town in the United Kingdom to possess three lighthouses and the two within the town itself remain fully operational. Wyre Light has now fallen into a state of disrepair.

Fleetwood Market, still a prominent permanent market, was established in 1840.

By 1838, Hesketh-Fleetwood had run into serious financial difficulties, with costs for the railway in particular ultimately exceeding £300,000. He had numerous financial arguments with Frederick Kemp, who borrowed against the estate revenues to finance the expansion of the town, and was suspected of taking financial advantage of Sir Peter. Hesketh-Fleetwood became short of cash and was forced to mortgage his properties. Depressed, he gradually withdrew from the project, and by 1844 he had been obliged to sell much of his estate. He leased Rossall Hall itself to the Church of England, which intended to set up a boarding school as a North of England equivalent of Marlborough School. Under the auspices of Rev. St. Vincent Beechey, the vicar of Fleetwood, it was to become Rossall School. Virtually bankrupt, Hesketh-Fleetwood retired to Brighton, giving up his parliamentary obligations in 1847. Meanwhile, Kemp&#x27;s influence expanded. He had set up the Fleetwood Estates Company to manage the land, and the North Lancashire Steam Navigation Company in 1843 to manage the expanding steamer trade. However, by the late 1850s, the combination of the new western railway route and the rise of neighbouring Blackpool as a prominent seaside resort signalled a decline in the town&#x27;s fortunes.

From the 1860s Fleetwood expanded its port activities. Steamers began pleasure and commercial services to the Isle of Man, Ardrossan and Belfast. of stone quays were built along the river front, and the railway line was extended to the steamer pier opposite Queen&#x27;s Terrace, where the imposing new railway station was built in 1883. The port was still mainly a cargo terminal at this time, but the fishing industry began to grow as vessels expanded their catchment area from the Irish Sea fishing grounds first fished in the 1840s, to the haddock grounds of the North Atlantic Ocean. At this time, all the fishing vessels out of Fleetwood were sail-powered fishing smacks, few being over 40 tons deadweight. The Fleetwood Docks Act of 1864 enabled the construction of a dock and embankment for both fishing and general cargo. Work on what was to become Wyre Dock began in 1869 but was suspended for financial reasons. A second Act in 1871 gave construction authority to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, under chief engineers Sir John Hawkshaw and Harrison Hayter. Construction itself, by John Aird &amp; Sons, was completed in 1877. Heavy industry came to the area in the late 1880s with the construction of a salt-processing works on the southeastern edge of the town by the Fleetwood Salt Co. Ltd, using salt mined in Preesall, across the river.
By the early 1890s, the construction and expansion of rival cargo ports in the North West and the building of the Manchester Ship Canal heralded the decline of Fleetwood&#x27;s prominence as a cargo port. However, at the same time this was more than offset by a period of rapid expansion of the fishing industry, signalled by the launch in 1891 of the first steam powered trawler, the &quot;Lark&quot;. All the other major fishing ports in Britain, Hull, Grimsby and Aberdeen, were on the east coast, so there was a competitive advantage for a west-coast port with good rail links. By the start of the 20th century, Fleetwood&#x27;s position as one of the three major fishing ports in England was cemented. James Marr brought a fleet of steam trawlers to Fleetwood and actively started to change the port by selectively fishing for hake, which until then had been treated as a much less desirable catch. Many of the houses in the old area of town around the Mount and Lord Street were built in the 1890s. In keeping with the thriving economy, these terraced houses were large for their era. An electric tramway link to Blackpool was constructed in the 1890s and remains operational to this day. The trams were routed along East Street and West Street (now Lord Street and North Albert Street) rather than Dock Street, and commercial trade followed, making those streets the commercial centre of the town. Fleetwood is the only town in Britain with trams running the full length of its main street, sharing road-space with cars. The docks were expanded in 1908 with the construction of the Fish Dock, accessible through Wyre Dock and still used today for the inshore fleet. Plans for a pier were first made in the 1890s but building did not start until 1909 and it was opened in 1910. It was the last new seaside pier to be built in the United Kingdom.
===20th century===
By the 1920s, the fishing industry was at its height, employing over 9,000 people. Over the next few years, the sea front along the north shore was developed in resort fashion, to encourage visitors for whom the brashness of Blackpool was too daunting. The Marine Hall entertainment complex (1935), golf course (1931) and Model Yacht Pond (1932) all date from that era. In the 1920s, the salt works, by then owned by the United Alkali Company (after 1926, part of ICI), was considerably expanded, and became an ammonia-processing plant. ICI built an adjacent chemical processing plant, known as ICI Hillhouse. ICI became the town&#x27;s third-largest employer, after the fishing and tourism industries. The first fully automated telephone exchange in Britain was put into operation to serve the town on 15 July 1922.

The town was hit by a huge flood in October 1927, which put 90% of the area of the town under water. Only the higher areas around the Mount escaped. Additional housing was built in the 1920s and 1930s in the less-developed central areas of the town, and a further development boom occurred in the 1960s, in the lower lying western portion of the town (Larkholme). Many industries related to fishing grew up along the rail corridor on the eastern side of the town, and a number of unrelated industries also moved to the area to take advantage of the availability of labour.

By the 1960s, however, Fleetwood had begun to decline economically. The last ferry to the Isle of Man sailed in 1961, although the sailings have been revived periodically since. The main railway station was closed in 1966 as a result of the Beeching cuts, and the passenger terminus was moved to Wyre Dock railway station. That, in turn, was closed in 1970, as the branch line from Poulton was taken out of service. Additional light industry developed along the former railway route.

The rise of package holidays abroad led to fewer visitors to British resort towns. As Blackpool expanded its attractions, fewer day visitors came to Fleetwood, and as transport became more efficient, more overnight visitors became day visitors. The Hillhouse plant was heavily cut back and was finally closed in 1999. Most serious, however, was the collapse of the fishing industry, which was largely destroyed in the late 1960s and early 1970s by the Cod Wars, a dispute over fishing rights between Iceland and the UK. As Fleetwood&#x27;s trawlers mainly fished the North Atlantic in search of cod, the loss of the fishing grounds hit the town hard. The last deep-sea trawler left the town in 1982 and now only inshore fishing boats use the port, although trawlers registered in other places can still be seen taking advantage of the fish market. Fish is still a big industry in the town, though the jobs are mainly in processing rather than fishing. A pair of bronze figures on the promenade by the pier depicts the idea of families welcoming back the fishermen from sea.

In 1973, the area around the old railway station was developed into a container port facility, with P &amp; O operating a container service to Larne in Northern Ireland. In 1975, this became a Roll-on/roll-off service. This development led indirectly to some renewal of the then largely derelict Dock Street area, and improved road access to the town to support the container traffic. Twice-daily container service continued until 2004 when Stena Line bought the route and increased the service to three times a day. In December 2010, Stena Line announced that the service would be withdrawn at the end of 2010, with the loss of 140 jobs.

Since the 1970s, there have been several attempts to enhance Fleetwood&#x27;s economic profile, In 1995, the now-deserted Wyre Dock was developed into a marina. The derelict dock landing area was developed into Freeport, a retail centre, and housing has been built at the north end of the marina. In July 2007, a new &quot;Masterplan&quot; for revitalising the waterfront and town centre was submitted to the Wyre Borough Council.

In 1996, Fleetwood could be seen in &quot;A High Profile&quot;, an episode of &quot;Hetty Wainthropp Investigates&quot;. Several buildings along The Esplanade were used, one of Fleetwood&#x27;s churches and others.

==Governance==
Since the Local Government Act 1972, effective 1 April 1974, Fleetwood has been part of the Borough of Wyre, together with the neighbouring communities of Thornton Cleveleys and Poulton-le-Fylde, the Over Wyre villages and Garstang. The administrative headquarters is in Poulton-le-Fylde. The borough is a constituent part of Lancashire County Council. Although Wyre Council has a Conservative majority (thirty out of a total of fifty councillors), nine of Fleetwood&#x27;s councillors belong to Labour two to Conservatives. Prior to 1974, Fleetwood had been a municipal borough since 1933, and from 1894 to 1933, an urban district. The town is divided into five wards, Mount, Pharos, Warren, Park and Rossall.

A Fleetwood parish council (known as Fleetwood Town Council) was established following a referendum in June 2009. The boundaries of the parish are coterminous with the boundary of the five borough council wards of Fleetwood and the town council has thirteen councillors.

In the 2010 General Election, Fleetwood was joined with Lancaster and some Over Wyre locations to form the new Lancaster and Fleetwood constituency. Conservative member Eric Ollerenshaw was elected in a tight race. From 1997 to 2010, Fleetwood was included with Thornton and parts of Blackpool, as part of the Blackpool North and Fleetwood parliamentary constituency. During that time the seat was held by Labour&#x27;s Joan Humble. Prior to 1997, Fleetwood was part of the constituencies of Fylde North and Wyre, whose boundaries more closely matched those of Wyre Borough, and which consistently returned a Conservative member. In the 2015 general election a majority vote saw Fleetwood become a Labour town once again, represented by Cat Smith.

==Geography==

===Topography===

Fleetwood is in the northwest corner of the Fylde coastal plain, north of Blackpool, on the western side of the mouth of the River Wyre. The town is on a peninsula, almost wide, bounded to the west by the Irish Sea, to the north by Morecambe Bay and to the east by the River Wyre estuary. Access to Fleetwood is thus restricted, and for many years there were only two roads into and out of the town (three since 1979). A large sandbank, the North Wharf, extends some north into Morecambe Bay, and is exposed at low tide. The river channel forms the eastern boundary of the bank. Together with the larger Bernard Wharf on the other side of the river, this makes navigation of the river difficult. Conversely, the port is highly sheltered from the prevailing westerly winds.

Like the remainder of the Fylde, the land is extremely flat, the highest point being the Mount, the large sand dune in the northern part of the town, from which the original street plan radiated. Parts of Fleetwood, especially to the north and west, are barely above sea level at high tide, and a large retaining sea wall runs along much of the western edge of the town. Nevertheless, Fleetwood was flooded in 1927 and again in 1977. The latter flood, although much smaller, affected more properties as there had been considerable development in the 1960s in the lower-lying parts of the town. The soil is broadly sandy, but there is considerable marshland to the south and east, by the river. The town itself encompasses an area of just under .

===Climate===
In common with the rest of the coastal areas of the UK, Fleetwood has a maritime climate. Prevailing winds and weather patterns are northwesterly, leading to a slightly higher average precipitation than the country as a whole, although the absence of high ground in the immediate vicinity moderates this. As with most coastal areas, frost and snow are uncommon. Temperatures are close to the national average.

==Demography==
At the 2011 Census, Fleetwood had a population of 25,939. This is a decline of 3.3% over the previous census figure (2001) of 26,840. The 2001 population registered a further decline of about 6% from the 1971 figures, at a time when the overall population of the Borough of Wyre rose by 11%.

At the 2001 census, Wyre Borough is 98.8% White in ethnic makeup. The remainder is split between South Asian (0.4%), Mixed race (0.4%) Black (0.1%) and Other (0.3%).

In June 2020 a meeting in support of the Black Lives Matter movement was planned. However, after an online backlash from Wyre Alliance councillors and locals the gathering was cancelled.

==Economy==
Fleetwood&#x27;s economy still revolves around the traditional areas of fishing, tourism, port activity and light industry, but since the early 1970s the town has continued to struggle economically. A government report in 2006 stated that three of the town&#x27;s five wards fall into the 5% to 10% most deprived wards in England.

The same government report noted that the demise of the fishing industry cost Fleetwood some 8,000 jobs, employment in fishing-related industries falling from 9,000 to less than 1,000, mostly in the fish-processing sector. The closure of the ICI Hillhouse works cost the region a further 4,500 jobs. Industrial and commercial development has been at a standstill for fifteen years and only a single commercial employer based in the town has more than 200 employees. The stock of both commercial and residential property is in decline.

While Wyre Borough in general has a lower unemployment rate than the rest of the United Kingdom, Fleetwood&#x27;s is considerably higher. Using figures indicating benefit claimants as a percentage of total population (usually considered to be about half the &#x27;actual&#x27; unemployment rate) the figures for August 2007 are:

 Average household income in August 2007 was as follows:

The town&#x27;s largest and most prominent single employer is Lofthouse&#x27;s of Fleetwood Ltd., manufacturers of Fisherman&#x27;s Friend—a menthol lozenge popular worldwide and especially in Japan.

In July 2007, a new &quot;Masterplan&quot; for revitalizing the town around a &quot;vibrant waterfront and a revitalised town centre&quot; was submitted to the Wyre Borough Council. Some of the funding would come from an EU cash grant. The Masterplan was funded by Wyre Council, the Northwest Development Agency and English Heritage. The plan has three main areas for development:

* Transport: Improvements to the A585 link road. Restoration of the railway link including a new railway station in Fleetwood. Improved links to the riverside coastal paths and Fleetwood Marsh Nature Reserve.
* &quot;Seafront scene transformation&quot;: new waterfront environment with housing, beach sports, family area and bigger entertainment attractions. The original plan placed housing on land opposite the Mount on land currently used as a nine-hole pitch and putt course, but, after opposition from residents, this part of the plan was dropped. The waterfront would have a discovery and entertainment centre focused around a re-fashioned Marine Hall, with better health and fitness facilities nearby.
* &quot;Attractive new look for centre&quot;: the Masterplan includes plans for more open spaces and more national name shops on Lord Street, with Albert Square and Station Road earmarked as public squares. A new landmark square and heart of the town is proposed on both Lord Street and London Street with cafes, bars and restaurants.

==Culture==

===Tourism and amenities===
The town&#x27;s most prominent feature is the Mount, a park facing the sea-front, laid out by Decimus Burton, and built on a large sand dune originally known as Tup&#x27;s Hill. It is surmounted by a pavilion built in 1904 incorporating a clock added in 1919.

The 13 hectares of Fleetwood Memorial Park was developed out of the earlier Warrenhurst Park, itself an early-C20 park designed by Thomas Lumb of Blackpool. In 1917 the park was renamed &quot;Memorial Park&quot; in memory of those who died in the First World War. The memorial statue was added a few years later and memorial trees planted by the children who lost relatives.

In the early 1900s the park was home to a boating lake and the current facilities include three crown green bowling greens, a children&#x27;s play area and picnic area, cenotaph memorial, duck pond, football pitches (on the site of the old boating lake) and tennis courts.

Fleetwood Pier, also known as &#x27;Victoria Pier&#x27;, was a feature of the town from its construction in 1910 until it was destroyed by fire in September 2008. Built at the end of the &#x27;golden age&#x27; of pier building, it was the last pleasure pier to be built in the United Kingdom, other than a 1957 pier built in Deal, Kent, to replace a structure damaged in the Second World War. At in length, it was one of the shortest piers in the country. At various times, it was an amusement complex, bar and dance hall. In 1952 the pier was badly damaged in a fire which started in the cinema, and it did not reopen until 1958. The pier was closed again in 2006, and plans were drawn up to convert the structure into a flats complex. However, the pier was again heavily damaged by fire in the early hours of 9 September 2008. On 26 September 2008, Wyre Borough Council announced that the pier would be completely demolished, and two weeks later confirmed that the pier would not be rebuilt. The pier site remains undeveloped many years later, as plans for flats or apartments have come to nothing. The site remains an eyesore and remains fenced off, many years after the fire.

Fleetwood has two prominent retail locations. Affinity Lancashire (formally Freeport Fleetwood) opened in 1995. It is a waterfront outlet shopping village, on the site of the former Wyre Dock, with 45 shops in a marina setting. Freeport was re-branded and re-launched in 2006 at a cost of £8.6m.
Fleetwood Market on Victoria Street is one of the largest covered markets in the North West, with over 250 stalls. It was first opened in 1840, although the present stone building dates from 1892.

===Museums===

Fleetwood Museum stands on Queen&#x27;s Terrace. The building, designed by Decimus Burton, was completed in 1836 and is the oldest surviving building in Fleetwood. It was originally the Customs House, and from 1889 to 1974 it served as Fleetwood Town Hall, until local government activity was moved to Poulton. It was designated as the town&#x27;s museum in 1992. The museum tells the story of the fishing industry in the town. In January 2006, the museum was threatened with closure by owners Lancashire County Council (LCC). However, volunteers helped re-launch the museum in April 2007, setting up the Fleetwood Museum Trust to run the museum in partnership with LCC for twelve months with the intention of the trust eventually running the museum themselves. The museum also operates the &quot;Jacinta&quot;, the town&#x27;s &quot;heritage trawler&quot;, stationed in the Wyre Dock Marina and open for public viewing throughout the year. Built in 1972, it was moved to Hull in 1982, before being handed over to the Jacinta Charitable Trust in 1995 when restoration work began on the trawler.
Unfortunately Jacinta was too badly off for Economical Repair &amp; was Cut up for Scrap in June / July / Aug 2019 .

===Churches===

Fleetwood&#x27;s parish church, St Peter&#x27;s, designed by Decimus Burton in 1841, stands at the corner of Lord Street and North Albert Street. It formerly had a spire, but this was demolished in 1904. St Mary&#x27;s, the town&#x27;s main Roman Catholic church, stands nearby. Built in 1867, it was designed by E. W. Pugin. A more modern church of interest is the copper-roofed St Nicholas, on Poulton Road, designed by Laurence King and completed in 1962.

===Other buildings===

Numerous other buildings designed by Decimus Burton remain in the town. Prominent are the Pharos and Lower Lighthouses, opened in 1840 and still in operation. Ships sailing down the Wyre channel line up the two lights, one above the other, to guide them. The Pharos is the only functioning lighthouse in the United Kingdom built in the middle of the street. It now forms a traffic roundabout. The North Euston Hotel, opened in 1841, is still the largest hotel in Fleetwood. Queen&#x27;s Terrace was completed in 1844 and is regarded as an outstanding example of classical architecture. Now mostly used for offices and private flats, at various times it has been used as a school, hospital, railway offices and wartime consulates for European nations. 
The town contains a total of forty-four buildings listed in the National Heritage List for England, all at Grade II.

===Media===
&quot;Fleetwood Weekly News&quot; covers the town and the North Fylde Area. The newspaper was founded in 1984 as a successor to the &quot;Fleetwood Chronicle&quot;, which had ceased publication several weeks earlier. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; itself, founded in 1843, was the oldest newspaper in the Fylde. Daily newspaper coverage is provided by the &quot;Blackpool Gazette&quot;. Both papers are published by Johnston Press, as is the &quot;Lancashire Evening Post&quot;, a daily newspaper covering the county of Lancashire.

Fleetwood falls within the coverage area of BBC Radio Lancashire. Commercial radio stations serving the area include Greatest Hits Radio, Hits Radio Lancashire and Greatest Hits Lancashire based in Preston and Smooth North West and Heart North West broadcasting from Greater Manchester.

Independent television service is provided by ITV Granada, the ITV franchise holder for the North West region. BBC North West is the regional BBC station serving Fleetwood.

===Festivals===
Fylde Folk Festival is held each year at the Marine Hall and other venues in the town. It is a festival of traditional and contemporary folk music, song and dance. The festival has been held continuously since 1971. The opening concert was staged each year onboard &quot;Jacinta&quot;, the town&#x27;s heritage trawler, however due to the vessels general poor state of repair, this is no longer the case.

Another annual music festival, originating in 2005, is Fleetwoodstock, named after the famous New York Woodstock Festival and held in the autumn. The usual venue is the Marine Hall.

The now annual Yuto Fest, which was first held in 2011, also takes place at the Marine Hall. Yuto Fest is a charity festival featuring local bands that was set up by Daz Rice of Kiss of the Gypsy and is a legacy for his three-year-old son Yuto Rice who died in 2012 after battling a heart condition.

Fleetwood Transport Festival, also known as Tram Sunday, has been held annually on the third Sunday of July since 1985. It is a festival of vintage vehicles highlighted by a number of historical tram-cars, which parade along Lord Street.

Fleetwood Beer &amp; Cider Festival is held in February each year and is organised by the Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre branch of CAMRA. The festival offers a choice of around 100 real ales as well as a selection of ciders and foreign beers.

===Music===
The young John Lennon spent his childhood summer holidays in Fleetwood with a cousin who lived in the town, returning to the town on 25 August 1962 when the Beatles played at the Marine Hall. Operatic tenor Alfie Boe grew up in Fleetwood and his first public performance was at the Marine Hall at the age of 14, where he worked as a stage technician. Operatic mezzo-soprano Jean Rigby was also born in Fleetwood.

The best-known rock bands to feature musicians from Fleetwood are television talking head John Robb&#x27;s the Membranes and Goldblade, punk band One Way System (the first signing on Cherry Red&#x27;s Anagram Records), Uncle Fester/UFX, Earthling Society, who have released six critically acclaimed albums, and Kiss of the Gypsy, who were signed to Atlantic Records in the US. One Way System drummer Tommy Couch (brother of boxer Jane Couch) played drums with UK Subs for two years. and has been voted one of the top 30 best punk drummers of all time.

Musicians from One Way System, UFX and Kiss of the Gypsy combined in 2011 to release a gothic psychobilly album as Boneyard Zombies and in 2014 the debut release by rock and roll garage band The Crawlin&#x27; Hex, formed by members of Earthling Society and UFX received a series of positive reviews.

Another influential Fleetwood musician is folk singer Alan Bell, the founder and director of the internationally renowned Fylde Folk Festival which ran for 42 years until Bell&#x27;s retirement in 2014. Bell&#x27;s suite &quot;The Band in the Park&quot; won the prestigious Radio Italia prize for Broadcasting for BBC Radio Lancashire and resulted in a BBC2 Television programme devoted to Bell – &quot;Alan Bell: The Man and His Music&quot;. The festival is to be superseded in 2015 by the New Folk &#x27;n&#x27; Roots Festival. Stuart Chatwood of Canadian rock band the Tea Party was also born in Fleetwood.

===Sport===
Fleetwood has had several football clubs over its history. The current version of the club, dating from 1997, is now known as Fleetwood Town F.C. and is nicknamed the Fishermen, and its followers the Cod Army. The club has played in the Football League since 2012, having been promoted in that year as champions of the Conference National. This is the first time a club from the town has played in the Football League. In May 2014 Fleetwood were victorious in the League 2 play-off final to win promotion to League 1. In August 2014, Nathan Pond played in his seventh different division for the club, an achievement officially recognised by Guinness as a world record under the title of &#x27;the most football (soccer) divisions played in for one club by an individual.&#x27; . With a population of under 26,000, Fleetwood was the smallest town in England with a League club until the promotion of Forest Green Rovers from Nailsworth in 2017.

A previous incarnation of Fleetwood Town F.C. enjoyed a brief history from 1977, reaching the final of the FA Vase in 1985, before being wound up because of financial difficulties in 1996. The same fate also befell the two previous town clubs. Fleetwood F.C. was founded in 1908 and wound up in 1976, having been several times Lancashire Combination cup champions in the 1930s, and founder members of the Northern Premier League in 1968. Fleetwood Rangers, the town&#x27;s first club, spent ten seasons in the Lancashire League and Lancashire Combination from 1889 to 1899. Since 1939, home games have been played at Highbury Stadium. Blackpool Reserves also use the stadium for their home matches.

In January 1938, Jimmy Hampson, who remains Blackpool&#x27;s record goalscorer, drowned off the Fleetwood coast during a fishing trip. The yacht on which he was sailing collided with a trawler and Hampson, 31, was knocked overboard. He drowned, and his body was never recovered.

Speedway racing was staged at Highbury Stadium from 1948 to 1952, with Fleetwood Flyers riding in the Second Division of the National Speedway league. The Flyers started the 1948 season as Wigan RLFC but moved to Fleetwood after racing a few away fixtures billed as Wigan. The Flyers raced in the National League Division Two from 1948 to 1951 without enjoying any great success. In 1952 the venue staged a number of open events with the team renamed the Fleetwood Knights.

Fleetwood Rugby Union Football Club is an amateur rugby union club, first registered in 1932 as Fleetwood Old Boys, with the Old Boys title being dropped in the 1950s. Fleetwood Cricket Club, based at Broadwater, are affiliated with the Lancashire Cricket Board and compete in the Northern League.

From the 1930s to the present, the Model Yacht Pond, one of Europe&#x27;s largest, has been host to numerous national and international championships, held under the aegis of the Fleetwood Model Yacht and Power Boat Club.

Fleetwood Reservoir on Copse Road provides coarse fishing facilities. The fishing club is affiliated to the National Federation of Anglers. Matches take place every Sunday and Friday during the summer months.

Fleetwood is a popular location for kitesurfing and other power kite sports. There are several suitable beaches and training is available at the local kite school.

==Health==
Fleetwood has suffered severe unemployment due to the collapse of the fishing industry and the closure of a local ICI factory. Unemployment adversely affected health and life expectancy in the town. There has been a local initiative, Healthier Fleetwood, based on social prescribing, to encourage residents to take control of their lives and take action to live healthier lives. This initiative had some degree of success. The number of Fleetwood residents at Blackpool&#x27;s A&amp;E has dropped by 11.5% in a year. There are suggestions it should be copied in other areas with similar problems.

==Transport==
Fleetwood lies at the northern end of the Blackpool tramway, which is operated by Blackpool Transport. It is about from Fleetwood to the southern terminus at Starr Gate, and about to Talbot Square, Blackpool. There are 10 tram stops in the town, the southernmost being Rossall School. Trams run the full length of both Lord Street and North Albert Street, undivided from regular road traffic. Bus service to Blackpool is provided by Blackpool Transport and Stagecoach North West, who also provide services to Preston and other local destinations.

There are frequent passenger ferry sailings from Fleetwood across the River Wyre to Knott End-on-Sea via the Wyre Estuary Ferry.

Passenger sailings to Douglas are not currently on a regular timetable. Ferries were operated by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company from 1876 to 1961, and again periodically from 1971. However, in recent years the service has been restricted to once or twice per year. From 2004, Stena Line provided some passenger accommodation on its thrice daily service to Larne in Northern Ireland. However, Stena Line withdrew the service at the end of 2010.

The town being built on a peninsula, for many years there were only two roads into and out of Fleetwood: Broadway, through Cleveleys, designated as the A587, and Fleetwood Road, through Thornton, designated as the A585. To cater for container traffic, Amounderness Way was built in the late 1970s and re-designated as the A585. In the 1990s, Amounderness Way was extended further into the town to the end of Dock Street (the entrance to the Freeport shopping village) along the former railway bed.

The town was for several years the northern Fylde terminus of the railway line to London, hence the hotel opposite the site of the now demolished Fleetwood railway station is called the North Euston Hotel. The line also carried landed fish from the docks to distant markets. There has been no railway service to Fleetwood since 1970. Poulton-le-Fylde and Blackpool North are the nearest railway stations. However, the line to Poulton is still present, and plans remain to re-open the line in the future. In June 2021 a feasibility study was submitted by the Lancashire County Council to the Department for Transport to re-open the line from Fleetwood to Poulton-le-Fylde, under the government&#x27;s &quot;Restoring Your Railway&quot; programme.

==Education==
Rossall School is a co-educational, independent, day and boarding school for ages 5 to 18. It was founded in 1844 on the site of Rossall Hall in the south west of the town. There are two public-sector secondary schools in the town. Fleetwood High School on Broadway was founded in 1977 as a comprehensive non-denominational secondary school, a successor to Fleetwood Grammar School (1921–77) and Bailey School. It was &#x27;re-branded&#x27; as Fleetwood Sports College in 2005 when the school was given specialist school status in sport, but reverted to its original name in September 2010. Cardinal Allen Catholic High School is a Roman Catholic high school, founded in 1963 as a secondary modern school.

The only tertiary educational institution in Fleetwood is the Nautical Campus of Blackpool and The Fylde College, located at Broadwater.

Fleetwood has seven public sector primary schools. Chaucer Community Primary School serves the oldest part of the town, around the Mount. Shakespeare Primary School serves the northwest part of the town. Flakefleet Primary School serves the south-central Flakefleet area. Charles Saer Primary School and Larkholme Primary School serve the western part of the town, around West View and Larkholme. Additionally, there are two Roman Catholic primary schools: St Mary&#x27;s, founded in 1870, which serves the northern part of the town, and St Wulstan&#x27;s and St Edmund&#x27;s, serving the southern part of the town and formed in 2006 from a merger of two existing schools.

The town is also home to a large public library, which as well as lending print and audio-visual material also has an extensive reference and local studies collection.

<text>A causewayed ring ditch is a type of prehistoric monument.

It comprises a roughly circular ditch, segmented by several causeways which cross it. Within the ditch is a central area used for inhumations and cremations, usually covered beneath a barrow. They are considerable smaller than the causewayed enclosures they resemble.

In the British Isles they date to the Neolithic period.

<doc id="783842" wikidata="Q608085" url="?curid=783842" title="Photodermatitis">
<text>Photodermatitis, sometimes referred to as sun poisoning or photoallergy, is a form of allergic contact dermatitis in which the allergen must be activated by light to sensitize the allergic response, and to cause a rash or other systemic effects on subsequent exposure. The second and subsequent exposures produce photoallergic skin conditions which are often eczematous. It is distinct from sunburn.

==Signs and symptoms==
Photodermatitis may result in swelling, difficulty breathing, a burning sensation, a red itchy rash sometimes resembling small blisters, and peeling of the skin. Nausea may also occur. There may also be blotches where the itching may persist for long periods of time. In these areas an unsightly orange to brown tint may form, usually near or on the face.

==Causes==
Many medications and conditions can cause sun sensitivity, including:
* Sulfa used in some drugs, among them some antibiotics, diuretics, COX-2 inhibitors, and diabetes drugs.
* Psoralens, coal tars, photo-active dyes (eosin, acridine orange)
* Musk ambrette, methylcoumarin, lemon oil (may be present in fragrances)
* PABA (found in sunscreens)
* Oxybenzone (UVA and UVB chemical blocker also in sunscreens) 
* Salicylanilide (found in industrial cleaners)
* St John&#x27;s wort
* Hexachlorophene (found in some prescription antibacterial soaps)
* Tetracycline antibiotics (e.g., tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline)
* Benzoyl peroxide
* Retinoids (e.g., isotretinoin)
* Some NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen sodium)
* Fluoroquinolone antibiotic: Sparfloxacin in 2% of cases
* Amiodarone, used to treat atrial fibrillation
* Pellagra (Vitamin B3 deficiency)

Photodermatitis can also be caused by plants such as &quot;Ammi majus&quot;, parsnip, giant hogweed (&quot;Heracleum mantegazzianum&quot;), common rue (&quot;Ruta graveolens&quot;), and &quot;Dictamnus&quot;, a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae with a single species &quot;Dictamnus albus&quot;, commonly called the burning bush. Photodermatitis caused by plants is called phytophotodermatitis.

==Prevention==
Prevention includes avoiding exposure to chemicals that can trigger the reaction, such as by wearing gloves, or avoiding sunlight or wearing sunscreen preferably with at least factor 30 and with a high UVA protection level on the affected area. And by addressing any risk factors, such as those listed above.

<doc id="783851" wikidata="Q2867874" url="?curid=783851" title="Canadian Medical Association">
<text>The Canadian Medical Association (CMA; ) is a national, voluntary association of physicians and medical learners that advocates on national health matters. Its primary mandate is to drive positive change in health care by advocating on key health issues facing doctors and their patients.

CMA publicates the &quot;Canadian Medical Association Journal&quot; (often abbreviated as &quot;CMAJ&quot;) which is a peer-reviewed medical journal that offers original clinical research, commentaries, analyses and reviews of clinical topics, health news, and clinical-practice updates.

==Membership==
The CMA has over 75,000 members and is the largest association of medical doctors in Canada. Its membership includes physicians and medical learners. The CMA represents Canadian physicians from medical school through to residency, medical practice and retirement.

==History==
The CMA&#x27;s origins may rest with Dr. Joseph Painchaud and other Quebec physicians who in 1844 hoped to find ways to help physicians and, after their deaths, their widows and orphans. There were false starts in attempts to form an association, but soon after confederation, practicing physicians were successful in developing a national body.

The CMA&#x27;s first president was Sir Charles Tupper, the Nova Scotia Premier who led that province into confederation and later became Prime Minister of Canada. The foundation of the CMA was strongly rooted in its Scottish origins as the first three presidents of the CMA graduated from the Edinburgh Medical School.

Among the CMA&#x27;s founding principles in 1867 was to &quot;improve public health and prevent disease and disability,&quot; a purpose which remains today.

The CMA Code of Ethics has been around in one form or another since 1868. As recently as 2015 this document was considered by the CMA to be &quot;arguably the most important document produced by the CMA. It has a long and distinguished history of providing ethical guidance to Canada’s physicians. Focus areas include decision-making, consent, privacy, confidentiality, research and physician responsibilities. The code is updated every 5-6 years and has a major revision approximately every 20 years. Changes must be approved by CMA General Council.&quot;

The fledgling association faced a lot of growing pains in its first 25 years as meeting attendance was small. There was even a notice of motion in 1894 to disband it.

The &quot;Montreal Medical Journal&quot; was taken over in 1911 to become the &quot;CMA Journal&quot;.

In 1921, the CMA re-organized with the appointment of its first permanent general-secretary, Dr. T.C. Routley. The association also became more financially stable by raising funds with a bond issue.

Over the years, the CMA and its physician members have advocated on behalf of patients and educated the public to limit the effects of outbreaks, such as the 1918 Spanish flu, SARS in 2002 and the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009–2010.

In an effort to raise awareness and research treatment of cancer, the organisation formed the Canadian Cancer Society (CCS). The association provided most of the funds for the early years of the CCS based on interest generated from public donations made to a fund honoring King George V&#x27;s silver jubilee.

Since the 1950s, the CMA has advised against tobacco use. It has fought against promotional tobacco marketing and for new laws that curbed smoking and other tobacco consumption among Canadians.

The CMA played an important role in medical assistance in dying (MAID) legislation, calling it one of the most complex and ethically challenging issues facing Canadian physicians. The CMA supports its members in exercising their freedom of conscience - both for those who chose to provide or participate in physician assisted suicide and those who do not.

The CMA also played a central role in the creation of the Registered Retirement Savings Plan in 1957 as a tool to provide its members financial security in retirement. MD Financial Management MD Financial Management was developed in 1969 to provide financial services to physicians and their families. It was sold in 2018 to Scotiabank, the sale including a 10-year collaboration agreement.

In 2018, the CMA ended its membership in the World Medical Association (WMA) to protest the plagiarism found in the speech of the WMA&#x27;s incoming president.

==Advocacy==
As a national association of physicians and medical learners, the CMA often advocates on key health issues that matter to Canadians and its members. In developing its positions, it seeks input through town hall meetings, surveys its members and reviews relevant scientific research. It also seeks input from provincial and territorial medical associations and from its more than 60 affiliate, associate and stakeholder organizations.

=== Medically assisted death ===
In 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada, in a unanimous decision, struck down the Criminal Code&#x27;s absolute prohibition on physician-assisted death. As a result, the CMA developed foundational principles for medical aid in dying to guide discussions with its members and with the federal government on ensuring patient dignity and upholding the rights of both patients and physicians. Consultations included submissions and presentations to the federal &quot;External Panel on Options for a Legislative Response to Carter v. Canada&quot;, the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights and Health Canada.

The CMA continues to work with government on matters such as medically assisted dying for children, as well as for those with mental illnesses but no other conditions.

=== Public mobilization campaign ===
In 2015 the CMA began its first major public mobilization effort, and in conjunction with a federal election happening that year, revealed its Demand a Plan campaign.

Demand a Plan is a public campaign spearheaded by the CMA with the aim of having all levels of government work together to develop a comprehensive national seniors strategy. Over 74,000 people have signed up in support of the campaign.

The Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities, in a report in March 2018, adopted many of the recommendations made the previous year by the CMA on ways to better serve seniors with improvements to housing, income security and quality of life.

After the success of Demand a Plan campaign, the CMA launched a second public mobilization platform called CMA Health Advocates. This platform is designed to engage Canadians on improving health care, and to connect with local politicians to share their health and health care stories. During the 2019 federal election, the CMA Health Advocates platform will be tracked each party&#x27;s platform promises.

===Choosing Wisely Canada===
Choosing Wisely Canada was launched by Dr. Wendy Levinson in 2014 in partnership with the CMA to help physicians and patients reduce unnecessary tests, treatments and procedures, and ensure high-quality care. Central to the campaign are lists developed by more than 45 specialty societies to encourage critical thinking that will avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful tests and procedures. The federal government&#x27;s Advisory Panel on Healthcare Innovation urged governments in all jurisdictions to support the initiative.

=== Drugs: Pharmacare, opioids and cannabis ===
The CMA continues to advocate that Canadians should have access to medically necessary pharmaceuticals that are safe, effective, available when and where needed and reasonably priced.

The CMA is an active member of the Pan-Canadian Collaborative on Education for Improved Opioid Prescribing, which is chaired by the College of Family Physicians of Canada. The CMA&#x27;s position is that &quot;opioids&quot; are important for managing pain, but prescribing them must be based on evidence and include careful assessment and monitoring. The CMA endorsed the collaborative&#x27;s clinical guideline for opioids, initially published by CMAJ and updated in 2017 by the Michael G. DeGroote National Pain Centre.

The CMA identified potential risks of &quot;cannabis&quot; use and has addressed them in submissions to House of Commons standing committees. Following the introduction of the Cannabis Act, the association provided guidance to the federal government on a regulatory framework to protect children and youth.

=== Health and technology ===
Advances in technology could bridge the physical divide between doctors and patients, thereby reducing wait times and health care costs. Technologies such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence and robotics hold significant promise for patients and physicians, particularly for a country like Canada with its large land base and numerous remote communities.

In early 2019, the CMA launched a Virtual Care Task Force alongside the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and the College of Family Physicians of Canada to explore the barriers affecting the effective implementation of virtual care in the Canadian health system. Recommendations are expected in early 2020.

=== Physician health and wellness ===
Physician health and wellness has become a key priority of the CMA. In 2018, a national snapshot report released by the CMA showed that while physicians report high resiliency, they also experience high levels of burnout and depression, particularly residents and women.

To help respond to this growing issue, the CMA has implemented a physician health and wellness department led by Dr. Caroline Gérin-Lajoie. An environmental scan is underway to further identify key issues and possible solutions.

=== Controversy ===
In 2009, the CMA was criticized for partnering with Pfizer to launch a continuing medical education program.

== Corporate structure ==
The size of the elected board of directors is transitioning to 19. The board includes physician, resident and student representatives. It is the executive authority of the CMA, meets four times a year and is responsible for policy direction.

In 2018, the association launched the CMA Patient Voice, a group of 12 individuals that provide a patient&#x27;s perspective to the CMA&#x27;s work.

A health summit attended by a wide spectrum of medical and health professionals as well as patient representatives is held annually to disseminate new research, information and innovations, and to debate issues facing the medical community and users of medical services.

A public annual general meeting is held to review financial statements and other CMA business matters. As well, the association holds an annual General Council meeting of its members to discuss policy matters.

=== Companies ===
The CMA&#x27;s subsidiary company, Joule, was created on Sept. 1, 2014. It delivers continuing education to doctors, resources for accessing medical information online, clinical information resources and summaries of the latest clinical evidence. CMAJ is published by Joule. Joule&#x27;s grant program funds CMA member innovations that potentially may assist in healthcare advancements.

<text>Bell Satellite TV (; formerly known as Bell ExpressVu, [[Dish Network]] Canada and ExpressVu Dish Network and not to be confused with Bell&#x27;s IPTV Fibe TV service) is the division of BCE Inc. that provides satellite television service across Canada. It launched on September 10, 1997. As of April 2017, Bell Satellite TV provides over 700 channels (including over 430 SDTV, 200 HDTV and 80 audio channels) to over 1 million subscribers. Its major competitors include satellite service Shaw Direct, as well as various cable and communications companies across Canada.

Bell Satellite TV for Condos () launched as Bell ExpressVu for Condos in 2004. It was a VDSL service for select multidwelling units (condominiums and apartments) in Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto. It later evolved into an IPTV service. Since 2010, this service operates as [[Bell Fibe TV]] and is delivered over FTTN or FTTH technology. By the end of the decade, Fibe TV became Bell&#x27;s main television service offering, with over 75% more subscribers compared to satellite TV.

Bell Satellite TV services were also repackaged and resold by Telus as Telus Satellite TV, in areas where the latter company&#x27;s Optik IPTV services are unavailable.

== History ==
===1990s: inception as ExpressVu===
ExpressVu was conceived in 1994, at the time of American DSS systems launch, as a consortium of Ontario-based Tee-Comm Electronics, Canadian Satellite Communications (Cancom), Vancouver-based Western International Communications (WIC) and Bell Canada Enterprises (BCE), with a projected startup date of late 1995. High technology development costs and delays placed Tee-Comm in a severe financial position, prompting the remaining partners to pull out in 1996. Instead, U.S. satellite-TV provider Echostar Dish Network was chosen to provide the receivers and uplink equipment. The Hughes DirecTV system had already been optioned to Power Broadcasting, in Canada; it has since been withdrawn. Tee-Comm on its own managed to launch the first DBS service in Canada, AlphaStar, in early 1997; however, in a matter of months the company went bankrupt and the service was discontinued, leaving thousands of consumers with useless receivers (although with some reconfiguration, could be used to receive unencrypted FTA channels). ExpressVu launched service in September 1997, initially as &quot;&quot;Dish Network Canada&quot;, followed by &quot;ExpressVu Dish Network&quot;&quot;, in both cases using the Echostar logo.

===2000s: Bell purchases ExpressVu, later renames it Bell Satellite TV===

Bell took over full ownership of ExpressVu by 2000.

The ExpressVu name was retired in August 2008 along with the Today Just Got Better advertising campaign. Bell&#x27;s television services as a whole are now simply called Bell TV. When disambiguation is required, the satellite service is called Bell Satellite TV.

Plans have been shelved for any additional ExpressVu satellite expenditures assuming pending CRTC and Industry Canada approval for Dish Network to use all 32 transponders on Nimiq 5. As a result of this, SES has announced that they will not be replacing the ill-fated AMC-14 now that Dish Network has cut this deal with Telesat &amp; BCE for Nimiq 5 usage.

In 2009, Telus reached a deal to resell a re-packaged version of the Bell Satellite TV service in parts of Alberta and British Columbia known as Telus Satellite TV. The agreement was designed to allow Telus the ability to &quot;instantly&quot; offer a quadruple play of services in markets where it has not yet deployed its IPTV services, while also allowing Bell to increase its television market share in Western Canada. The Telus-branded service co-exists with the Bell-branded version of Bell Satellite TV, which is still offered in the markets that Telus Satellite TV is offered. As of March 31, 2018 Telus Satellite TV is no longer available to new customers. Current subscribers can update their channels by calling 310-MYTV (6968). https://www.telus.com/en/tv/satellite

===2010s: discontinuation of SDTV receivers and traditional theme packages===
In 2012, Bell changed satellite plans in Ontario. They are now sold in packages called &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Better&quot; and &quot;Best&quot; similarly to its competitor Rogers Cable in that region. Channels in the &quot;Best&quot; tier can still be purchased in theme packages, and existing customers with older plans are grandfathered. This also does not affect other regions such as Quebec, where there are different types of plans. Along with these changes, Bell discontinued sales and rentals of its final standard-definition television (SDTV) receiver, the 4100 model. Customers who still have an older SDTV with an AV input (or peripheral modulator) can use an HD receiver, but the quality will be limited to 480i due to technical limitations.

== Satellites ==

Bell Satellite TV broadcasts from two geostationary satellites: &quot;Nimiq 4 and 6&quot;. &quot;Nimiq 4&quot; was launched on September 19, 2008, and &quot;Nimiq 6&quot; was launched on May 17, 2012. Both satellites follow an equatorial path, giving coverage to most of Canada. &quot;Nimiq&quot; is an Inuktitut word for &quot;that which unifies&quot; and was chosen from a nationwide naming contest in 1998. The two satellites are owned and operated by Telesat Canada. Bell&#x27;s uplink site is located in North York, Toronto, Ontario.

&quot;Nimiq 4&quot;, located at 82° W primarily serves Bell&#x27;s high-definition television content. &quot;Nimiq 6&quot;, located at 91.1°W primarily serves Bell&#x27;s standard-definition television and radio content. Each satellite has 32 Ku-band transponders. A transponder usually has enough bandwidth to broadcast approximately 10 channels. Because HDTV requires more bandwidth, some transponders typically broadcast only 4-5 channels. LyngSat provides a listing of channels on &quot;Nimiq 4&quot; and &quot;Nimiq 6&quot; broken down by transponder.

===Past satellites===
&quot;Nimiq 1&quot; was launched on May 20, 1999 and contains 32 Ku-band transponders. at 91°W. (From the time of service launch in 1997 to the switch to &quot;Nimiq&quot; in 1999, ExpressVu used the already crowded &quot;Anik E2&quot;.) &quot;Nimiq 2&quot;, launched on December 29, 2002, also includes 32 K-band transponders. &quot;Nimiq 2&quot; provides HDTV, international programming, and all newly released channels. It occupies the 82° W slot. &quot;Nimiq 3&quot; went online on August 23, 2004. Originally called &quot;DirecTV3&quot;, it is an old DirecTV satellite moved to a new orbital slot near &quot;Nimiq 1&quot; to offload some of the transmitting work from the original satellite. In February 2006, &quot;Nimiq 3&quot; was moved behind &quot;Nimiq 2&quot; to support it, while another satellite, &quot;Nimiq 4i&quot; (formerly &quot;DirecTV2&quot;), took &quot;Nimiq 3&quot;&#x27;s spot behind &quot;Nimiq 1&quot;. &quot;Nimiq 4i&quot; was replaced with &quot;Nimiq 4iR&quot; as it ran out of fuel on April 28, 2007 and was de-orbited. Both &quot;Nimiq 3&quot; and &quot;Nimiq 4iR&quot; feature 16 Ku-band transponders. &quot;Nimiq 4&quot; was launched by a Proton rocket which lifted off on September 19, 2008 at 21:48 UTC.

==Hardware==

===Receivers===
Bell Satellite TV satellite receivers are manufactured for Dish Technology by Jabil in India and DD&amp;TT in China. Two different high-definition television (HDTV) receivers are currently provided, with either optional or built-in personal video recorder (PVR) capabilities:
* Whole Home PVR (9500) is Bell Satellite TV&#x27;s latest PVR, released in 2018. It is slim like the 6400 and succeeds the larger 9241. The internal 1 TB hard drive allows for up to 500 hours of SDTV, or 150 hours of HDTV. It offers both an HDMI and composite video output, but removed component video and RF modulator output that were included in many previous receivers. This receiver has a dual tuner, allowing viewers to watch one channel while recording it and/or another.
* Whole Home Receiver (7500) is a single-tuner HDTV receiver, released in 2018. Like the 9500, it is limited to HDMI and composite video. It does not include an internal hard disk drive, but can receive PVR capabilities by being connected to a 9500 on the same dish, or when an external hard disk drive is connected to the USB 2.0 port on the 7500. The drive stores a one-hour data buffer, allowing one to rewind and pause a live TV program for that time period.

Bell has discontinued older receivers which either only supported standard-definition television (SDTV) or included a series of features that newer receivers no longer offer. Some discontinued receivers include:
* Standard-Definition Receiver (4100) was Bell&#x27;s last standard-definition television (SDTV) receiver, sold until March 2012. It is compact and provides coaxial cable, composite video, S-Video and TOSLINK outputs. It had no built-in PVR capabilities, requiring an external device such as a VCR or DVD recorder to record shows.
* Standard-Definition PVR (5900) was Bell&#x27;s last SDTV PVR. It could record up to 80 hours of programming. However, it was a single-tuner receiver, limited to one channel at a time.
* HD PVR Plus Receiver (9242) was a dual-tuner PVR. It included channel distribution (allowing multiple TVs to use this receiver in standard definition), picture-in-picture (watching two channels simultaneously on one TV), and an over-the-air TV tuner (to watch and record non-satellite programming). Bell commonly sold the 9241, a dual-tuner PVR without these additional features.

While current HD receivers support the 480i, 480p, 720p, 1080i and 1080p resolutions, broadcast channels are limited to letterboxed 480i (effectively 360i in widescreen) for standard-definition channels, and 720p for high-definition channels. Web-based content is available in 1080p, including Netflix, Crave (a Bell service), and Bell video on demand.

Bell offers composite video outputs on almost all receivers, including the 9500 and 7500, to support older televisions. This connection is limited to 480i resolution. Receivers can use the optional gray bars mode, designed to prevent burn-in on plasma televisions.

===Remotes===
Many types of remotes have been released over the years. Models 1000 and 2700 came out with very basic infrared (IR) remotes that could be used only to control the receivers themselves and would operate on all 16 remote addresses. Replacement remotes then came with universal functions allowing users to control the power and volume of their televisions along with VCRs and sound system receivers; these remotes can only operate on a single address at a time. Models equipped with a UHF antenna can respond to UHF remotes; these remotes use radio frequencies rather than IR signals to control the receivers. UHF signals can reach up to 30 meters, depending on the restrictions of building materials. All UHF-compatible receivers can simultaneously respond to IR signals except for model 4500. For this model, modification directions exist on the Internet to add IR receiving capability, in order for the receiver to respond to programmable universal remotes. Remote #2 of the 3200, 5200, 9200, and the remote for model 6100 are based on &quot;UHF Pro&quot;. &quot;UHF Pro&quot; remotes are strictly compatible with the receivers they are provided with and do not function on regular UHF-compatible receivers. Additionally, &quot;UHF Pro&quot; remotes can only communicate with UHF frequencies and cannot control receivers via IR. To prevent interference with other UHF remotes in proximity, clients should change their remote addresses. All secondary remotes for dual tuners may also be converted to remote #1 by flipping the plastic bottom of the remote. This also switches its transmission mode from UHF Pro to regular UHF and IR, similar to how a 5900 remote operates.

===Satellite dishes===
Bell Satellite TV currently provides 50 cm (20&quot;) dishes to its customers. Canadians living in the territories and certain parts of British Columbia and northern mainland portion of Newfoundland and Labrador require larger dishes between 60 and 120 cm; these are used to compensate for the weaker satellite signal available to these regions. The 50 cm dish supports two LNBs. The size of the dish was increased from 18 to 20 inches in late 2001 to accommodate a second LNB to acquire signal from &quot;Nimiq 2&quot; (BEV 82) satellite. At the end of the dish&#x27;s arm, a Y-adapter is found which holds both LNBs. The BEV 91 LNB is in the centre of the dish while the BEV 82 LNB is offset to the left. Rotating the dish (i.e., modifying the skew angle) changes the position of the 82 LNB while maintaining position for BEV 91. A switchbox, typically an SW21 or SW44, is used to merge both satellite signals into receivers.

===Smartcards===
To authorize programming, a portable smartcard is used for older receivers. This includes the 1000, 2700, 2800, 3000, 3100, 3500, 3700, 4000, 4500, 4700, 5100, 5800, 5900 and the 6000. In some cases, Bell Satellite TV has switched back to using standard smartcards for the 6100 9200 and 9400 receivers.

In February 2008, Bell Satellite TV announced a second smartcard swap involving all its receivers with the exception of the 6141 and 9241 models. This was required due to the massive intrusion of ExpressVu signals that occurred with the Nagravision 2 encryption. The latter standard was implemented on May 27, 2005, to end the unlicensed access that occurred with the first Nagravision system.

Bell Satellite TV has upgraded to Nagravision 3 as the new encryption standard, to prevent unauthorized access to pay TV channels. The only means to view Bell Satellite TV illegally is through IKS (Internet Key Sharing) devices which include NFusion FTA and the Slinger. Both devices are not hacks but only means of a workaround. Bell Satellite TV is currently working towards shutting down these types of devices. No known hacks exist for the Nagravision 3 protocol.

Newer receivers incorporate smartchips instead, which are permanently installed inside the receiver. According to Bell Tech Support, a 4100 with smartchip will require a newer smartcard upgrade.

===Unsupported hardware===
In 2009, Bell 6000 receiver owners received letters in the mail that state they must swap to a 6141 or face losing programming as Bell Satellite TV deployed MPEG-4 with 8PSK. The 6000 does support the use of 8PSK with an add-in module, but Bell Satellite TV decided not to send out these as the 6000 is old and most customers will be wanting to upgrade to a 6141 which can have a hard disk drive added to it to be used as a PVR. The guide for programming information is also updated and stores more information in its database than the 6000.

Later, starting in October 2011, Bell announced that it would replace all currently active MPEG-2 HD satellite receivers, specifically the 6100 and 9200 models, with MPEG-4 HD receivers. This is to allow current HD channels to be encoded in MPEG-4 instead of MPEG-2, providing free space for 43 additional local standard definition channels which will begin airing in September 2012. 6100 owners will receive the latest 6131 HD receiver, while 9200 owners will receive either a 9241 or a 9242. If the 9200 receiver was used for two televisions, Bell will provide either a 9241 with a 5900 or a 9242. Both setups permit the two televisions to watch Bell Satellite TV but recording and playback with the 5900 does not equal the 9200 for the second TV. About 240,000 receivers in 193,000 homes will be replaced.

== Services ==

=== 3D television ===
3D television (3DTV) is available across Canada with Bell Satellite TV. The 2010 Masters Tournament on Bell Satellite TV was the first national 3D broadcast, making Bell Satellite TV the first Canadian satellite television service to broadcast in 3D. Content will be available free of charge to Bell HDTV subscribers, although a 3D HDTV and 3D glasses are required to view 3D programming.

===Installation===

Bell normally provides free installation to new customers for their first PVR in exchange of a two-year contract. There is still a one-time activation fee of no more than $50 to pay. On Bell Media television channels, Bell advertises this as &quot;One phone call can get you set up as early as tomorrow.&quot;

One to four receivers are typically connected to a single satellite dish. Setting up a greater number of receivers is more complicated and costly, so Bell does not provide setup in such circumstances. Customers are free to set up more than four receivers at their own risk. This also applies to any self-installed equipment such as second-hand receivers. Bell&#x27;s receiver limits can prove to be challenging for larger homes or multi-family residential units because landlords tend to prohibit the installation of more than one satellite dish.

Residential accounts are limited to a maximum of six receivers per account, but each of them can be a dual tuner receiver; therefore up to 12 televisions can be served however the current receiver lineup offered by Bell does not support 2 televisions as the 9242 receiver was discontinued. Account stacking, which consists of having receivers on one account located in different locations, is contrary to the Bell Satellite TV Residential and Commercial Agreements. It is certainly not illegal, and in a worst-case scenario, service will be cancelled. This practice is detailed in CRTC Public Notice 2006-133 and 2006-134. There is no requirement whatsoever in the Regulations that prohibits a BDU (broadcast distribution undertaking) from providing service at more than one location via a single account. Bell has mostly focused on improving its satellite signal reception in Canada while seeking to prevent snowbirds from accessing this signal. The use of Bell Satellite TV services in the United States is not illegal, but it remains a controversial issue.

===Interactive services===
Current and many past receiver models support interactive services, branded as iTV, offering information services for weather and sports. When watching The Weather Network, for example, one can select their local city to receive detailed information about that city&#x27;s weather conditions. For sports such as NFL Sunday Ticket or NHL Centre Ice, iTV allows fans to simultaneously keep track of multiple games. This means that when the watcher is concentrating on one single game, they will be notified if the score changes for other games.

Basic video games, lottery results and horoscopes were previously available as Bell Satellite TV interactive services. Pornography-themed video games were also offered in the past via Bell&#x27;s sex industry brand, Venus. These services have been discontinued as part of the Today Just Got Better rebranding. Wireless game controllers, sold for use with Game Galaxy and Venus Games, have been cleared out for the price of $4.99 each at Bell-owned The Source.

===Pay-per-view===
Pay-per-view (PPV) events may be ordered either via the receiver itself with a remote control and phone line connection, via Bell&#x27;s website, or via an automated phone system. Regular movies tend to cost less, while adult and sports programming have a higher cost. Channel 299 previously featured classic movies at 99 cents each, but this channel has been pulled off the air in 2011. Bell Satellite TV carries movies recently released on DVD along with major sporting events including boxing, WWE and Ultimate Fighting Championship. Red Carpet Vu! is a Pay-per-view movie service broadcast in a group of up to ten different channels where a daily featured movie starts every fifteen minutes.

Some customers have the misconception that the optional phone line, when plugged into the receiver, is used for software downloads and programming changes. In fact, the only information the line receives, if available from and supported by the phone line, consists of caller ID informations displayed in a pop-up notification for the viewer&#x27;s convenience when a phone call is being received. The phone line simply automates the process of ordering pay-per-view by dialing out the Event ID and other information that would be requested by manually calling the pay-per-view phone system.

===Support and warranties===
Bell Satellite TV provides technical support 24/7, however it will only support its products. Any type of picture troubleshooting must be done with a direct connection from the receiver to the television. For new customers, the first receiver is normally installed at no cost to the customer.

All labour for installations is only under warranty for three months. Receivers are under warranty for as long as they are rented. Purchased equipment comes with a default warranty of one year with the option of taking an extended warranty. Only manufacturer&#x27;s defects will warrant replacement of a dish under coverage, as a strict policy is in place regarding &quot;Acts of God&quot; and dish damage, which includes violent weather disabling a dish or mis-aligning it, as well as any physical modifications by the customer such as painting the dish.

==Alternative Bell TV offerings==

Bell also offers IPTV and mobile television services where available.

===Bell Fibe TV===

The Bell Fibe TV service is an implementation of IPTV that uses VDSL to deliver television service via telephone lines. Early versions of this service was originally deployed as &quot;Bell ExpressVu for Condos&quot; to get around restrictions regarding the mounting of satellite dishes. The original service was trialled using &quot;NextLevel Communications&quot; (now part of Motorola) set-top boxes that receive television broadcasts over VDSL in ATM form. The network infrastructure can support large amounts of bandwidth (typically 25 Mbit/s, as of January 2012) and is available in certain cities, including Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Quebec City.

===Bell Mobile TV===

Since October 18, 2010, Bell Mobility allows smartphones and tablet computers on either its HSPA+ or LTE network to access Mobile TV. Virgin Mobile Canada customers can also access Mobile TV. Similar systems by Bell in the past used the phased-out CDMA network. Unlimited access via Wi-Fi was previously available, but has since been discontinued. The service is billed per hour, and customers do not pay any additional fees.

== Channels ==
Bell Satellite TV currently features over 500 channels including all major Canadian networks and several American TV stations (ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC and PBS affiliates), premium movie services, Vu! pay-per-view service, popular radio stations, sports, international and adult programming. The company provides over 130 High Definition channels, which used to be the most in Canada, until Shaw Direct launched its new satellite Anik G1 on May 29, 2013. Today Shaw Direct customers access to over 400 HD channels. Bell Satellite TV&#x27;s programming changes constantly.

== Show and Extra magazines ==
Bell Satellite TV produced a monthly magazine called &quot;Show&quot; (the French version is called &quot;Extra&quot;). Show debuted in September 2007, and replaced Bell Satellite TV Magazine, the previous name for the customer publication from ExpressVu.

Show was delivered to over 800,000 Bell Satellite TV customers and showcases entertainment from Canada, Hollywood and around the world.

Show Magazine and Extra had been cancelled by Bell Satellite TV to save paper in early 2008.

<text>Ray Barber (January 8, 1923 – June 30, 2009), born Michael Joseph Barbetta, was an American singer in the early 1950s. He recorded with Mercury Records.

He had a hit overseas in the UK entitled &quot;Mary Rose&quot;. He was recording the song &quot;Because Of You&quot; when a young Tony Bennett was in the studio and heard it for the first time. In the early part of his career he was a regular on the Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts under the name of Johnny Caruso. He performed in the Catskills in the 1960s and early 1970s with Phyllis Diller and Soupy Sales. Later he moved to the small town of Plant City, Florida to retire and settle down with his wife Marie. When she died of cancer, he took up singing again. He amassed a following of fans in the local clubs until his death.

Ray Barber died on June 30, 2009, in the Plant City Florida hospital. He was buried in New York City next to his wife.

<doc id="783883" wikidata="Q2717948" url="?curid=783883" title="Oxegen">
<text>Oxegen was a music festival in Ireland, first held from 2004–2011 as a rock and pop festival and again in 2013 with dance and chart acts only. The event was regularly cited as Ireland&#x27;s biggest music festival, and, by 2009, it was being cited as the greenest festival, being a 100% carbon neutral event in Ireland, although this claim is highly disputed as green-washing. It was previously called Witnness, which ran from 2000 and was sponsored by Guinness. The event was promoted by MCD and was sponsored by Heineken. Oxegen was originally a three-day festival, but from 2008 onwards, it was expanded to four days.

It took place at the Punchestown Racecourse in County Kildare, Ireland and has an average attendance of around 60,000 a day, with around 50,000 of these camping on site for the duration, and the rest travelling to the site each day. It took place on the same weekend as T in the Park in Scotland and shared a very similar lineup each year, but Oxegen was generally regarded as Ireland&#x27;s version of the Glastonbury Festival, with the 2008 festival sharing three of the same headliners as its English counterpart.

Oxegen attracted significant attention from outside Ireland, with many of those attending travelling from overseas experiencing a &quot;mass exodus&quot; to the festival. Members of bands such as The Killers, Snow Patrol and R.E.M. have spoken positively of their experiences at the festival. Celebrities frequently attend, including models Helena Christensen (a regular attendant) and television personality Chris Pontius, actor Josh Hartnett, and Ronnie Wood of The Rolling Stones, who was pursued by &quot;half the journalists in the country&quot; and many of his own relatives for much of the 2008 festival. The event has also attracted some negative publicity, particularly following the 2006 festival. This is attributed to such factors as the age of admission (17) and easy access to alcohol.

Oxegen, for two consecutive years, was named as the Best European Festival in a poll which included festivals from France, Netherlands, Spain, United Kingdom and other countries, leading &quot;The Sunday Business Post&quot;″s Nicola Cooke to describe it as &quot;one of the most successful music festivals in Ireland has&quot;. Leagues O&#x27;Toole has described it as an &quot;enormously successful, award-winning, established brand [...] aimed at a young audience out for a good time, a post-Leaving Cert rite of passage perfect for acts with big singalong tunes that sound great in the mud&quot;. Oxegen received a mention in the Colum McCann short story &quot;Aisling&quot;.

In April 2014, organisers announced that the Oxegen festival would not be going ahead that year, citing a lack of suitable headline acts.

==History==
Oxegen first took place in 2004 over the second weekend in July. The Killers, who went on to headline the festival twice in 2007 and 2009, were one of the bands to appear at the first Oxegen. Dave Keuning, in an interview with &quot;Hot Press&quot; prior to the 2009 festival, described Oxegen as &quot;a big deal because it&#x27;s one of the first European festivals we played when we came over from Vegas in 2004. We only had one hit—&quot;Mr. Brightside&quot;—and were worried in case no one showed. But the tent was packed with people screaming out the words to songs we didn&#x27;t think they knew. It was that night we thought, &#x27;Hey, something&#x27;s happening here!&#x27; Oxegen more so than Glastonbury even was the highlight of our summer.&quot;

The original festival, Witnness, sponsored by Guinness, took place during the start of August with notable headliners, including Oasis, The Foo Fighters and Green Day. In its second and third year, running changed its dates to the second weekend of July. In 2008 Oxegen became a three-day festival.

Rodrigo y Gabriela made their breakthrough after being asked by Damien Rice to perform with him at Oxegen 2004.

The Japanese Popstars formed after viewing several dance acts at Oxegen 2006.

R.E.M. members Michael Stipe and Peter Buck watched several shows from side stage at Oxegen 2007 before returning to headline the festival the following year. Stipe credits his 2007 visit with inspiring him to want to go on tour again, saying: &quot;I saw all these great bands and the next day after the festival we went into the studio.&quot;

Muse, known for their spectacular light show and their reputation as one of the best live bands in the world, headlined Oxegen 2007. They returned to headline the mainstage on the Saturday night of the 2010 festival.

Battles played the biggest festival show of their career at that time in the Pet Sounds Arena during Oxegen 2008. The Prodigy played four new songs at Oxegen 2008. Also in 2008, Interpol were sent champagne by U2 as they arrived for rehearsals.

Chad Wolf of Carolina Liar described the band&#x27;s performance at Oxegen 2009 as &quot;an out-of-body experience&quot;.

Each Oxegen has been defined by the attention focused on its own weather, with &quot;The Belfast Telegraph&quot; referring to 2005 as &quot;the sunny one&quot;, 2006 as &quot;the torrentially rainy one&quot;, 2007 as &quot;the muddy one&quot; and 2008 as &quot;the so-so one&quot;.

==Facilities==
As well as the current eight stages of music, there were three large areas for camping which were subdivided by number and the colours blue, red and green – which was the VIP campsite. The backstage and media areas were located in the middle of the site in the buildings normally used to watch the races. Stalls and shops were also provided for festival-goers, as well as toilet and shower areas for campers from 2006 onwards.

A Centra store was located in each campsite from 2007 onwards and An Post first appeared at the festival in 2008.
There was also a funfair adjacent to the arena, featuring a big wheel and other rides, such as the &quot;Magic Carpet&quot;, the &quot;Big Drop&quot;, and the roller coaster. In 2008, an additional funfair was located in the blue campsite alongside other campsite entertainment such as a circus, silent disco and the Xbox Live Stage. Glass in any form was banned from the festival site and bottle corks, cans and umbrellas are banned from the concert arena.

52 miles of fencing are used across the site. 14 megawatts of power are used to energise Oxegen, with 28,000 miles of cable used to transfer this power. 25,000 litre water tankers are located around the site. Hats and cloaks are regularly seen, whilst wellies are also commonly worn by festival-goers.

The Dance Arena was a large shed previously used for ideal homes exhibitions.

Oxegen 2006 took place at Punchestown Racecourse from 8 to 9 July. A limited number of tickets for the festival went on sale a week after the 2005 festival on Friday 15 July. On 20 February the festival was launched and the first acts were officially announced. Tickets went on general sale on Friday 3 March at 8 am, with weekend camping tickets priced at €160. This allocation of tickets sold out within 48 minutes. The festival itself encountered bad weather which eclipsed previous records. There were improvements on the Sunday afternoon with sunny skies and a cool, gentle breeze ensuring a decrease in wet festival-goers.

The Who and Red Hot Chili Peppers headlined the festival, the former performing live in Ireland for the first time in 35 years, the latter for the fourth time in five summers.

Security arrangements were criticised as being poor by some sections of the media. The camp-site was not free from trouble, with reports of tent-burning and an alleged stabbing on the Sunday night/Monday morning of the festival.
In the Green Room a considerable leak allowed rain into the enclosed marquee. There were 225 arrests for drugs (with 13 charged for possession with intent to supply), one alleged rape, and the &quot;Evening Herald&quot; reported that around 250 people were treated for alcohol and drug abuse. When 40 people were sent to Naas General Hospital, fears were raised of a bad batch of ecstasy, but no evidence of such a batch was found. A number of media outlets were threatened with legal action on their coverage of Oxegen 2006 in its aftermath. These included the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; and boards.ie, where all discussion of MCD events and venues was banned.

===2011 Line-up===


– ** artist cancelled attendance after official announcement

==2012 hiatus==
On 21 December 2011, MCD posted a short notice on the Oxegen website confirming rumours that Oxegen 2012 had been cancelled. The statement read as follows: &quot;OXEGEN, like Glastonbury, is taking a year off in 2012 and will be back July 2013. Wishing everyone a very Happy Christmas &amp; peaceful New Year. Keep Rockin&#x27; in 2012 and we will see you in 2013! Your Oxegen Team&quot;.

The cancellation was expected to damage the local economy in Kildare. Media described the Dublin leg of The Stone Roses Reunion Tour, held in Phoenix Park on 5 July 2012, as a replacement for the year&#x27;s lack of Oxegen. A Swedish House Mafia concert at the same venue two days later also drew comparisons with the festival, with &quot;Oxegen-like behaviour&quot; culminating in a number of random unprovoked attacks and concerns that &quot;The off-stage events which have dominated the news agenda since the Swedish House Mafia show [...] will forevermore be associated with stabbings and suspected drug deaths rather than the music.&quot;

==2013 festival==
MCD chief Denis Desmond revealed, on the official Oxegen website in April 2013, the news that Oxegen would return to the Irish festival line-up that summer following a one-year hiatus.

The festival took place in its usual home of Punchestown Racecourse in Kildare, and took place from 2–4 August 2013.
On 22 April an announcement was made to confirm the first set of acts playing. Confirmed were Calvin Harris, Rizzle Kicks, Jack Beats, Duke Dumont, Example, Pitbull, Nero. On 24 April David Guetta was announced as one of the headline acts. The line-up was heavily criticized for having no guitar bands. The actual announcement posts were deleted on the same day as negative feedback was so heavy that festival promoters urged MCD to remove it to avoid embarrassment. It is thought that ticket sales were poor, and this may have been the last time MCD attend the festival. Revellers noted that there were 38 bands above this years headliners in 2010.

<text>The Pangaion Hills (; ; Homeric Greek: Nysa; also called Pangaeon, Pangaeum) are a mountain range in Greece, approximately 40 km from Kavala. The highest elevation is 1,956 m at the peak of Koutra. The Aegean Sea lies to the south and the plains of Philippi-Kavala to the north. The mountain range covers the southeastern portion of the Serres regional unit as well as the northwestern part of the Kavala regional unit which includes the bigger part of the hills.

The Ottoman Turks called the hills &quot;Pınar Dağ&quot; (&quot;Spring Mount&quot;). The Slavic name is &quot;Kushnitsa&quot; (Кушница) or &quot;Kushinitsa&quot; (Кушиница).

==Description==
The hills are directly across a fertile plain from the ancient city of Philippi known for the Battle of Philippi a Roman-era civil war, which took place in 42 BC. They are located in the ancient country of Sintice, between the Strymon and the Xiropotamos rivers and are covered in the oriental plane and chestnut trees. Towns found in the Pangaion hills include Nikisiani and Palaiochori which are agricultural in nature and grow mainly grain and tobacco. The town of Palaiochori boasts the ruins of an ancient castle on a peak overlooking the town. Gold and silver were mined in the ancient times. The Athenian tyrant Pisistratus was exiled in the middle of the mountain. It was the rich gold and silver available in the region that made the Athenians send out a colony in 465 to an area known as the Nine Roads (&quot;Ennéa Hodoí&quot;). The colonists were massacred by nearby Thracians and the colony was abandoned, though the Athenians would return to the area with their colony at Amphipolis.

Pangaion is very often referred to by ancient Greek and Latin sources. It was famous for silver and gold mines, as well as for shipyard wood and the oracle of Dionysus.

The municipality of Pangaio is named after this mountain range and the seat of the municipality is Eleftheroupoli.

<text>Barbara Ellen Kingsolver (born April 8, 1955) is a Pulitzer Prize-winning American novelist, essayist, and poet. Her widely known works include &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot;, the tale of a missionary family in the Congo, and &quot;Animal, Vegetable, Miracle&quot;, a nonfiction account of her family&#x27;s attempts to eat locally. In 2023, she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for the novel &quot;Demon Copperhead&quot;. Her work often focuses on topics such as social justice, biodiversity, and the interaction between humans and their communities and environments.

Kingsolver has received numerous awards, including the Dayton Literary Peace Prize&#x27;s Richard C. Holbrooke Distinguished Achievement Award 2011 and the National Humanities Medal. After winning for &quot;The Lacuna&quot; in 2010 and &quot;Demon Copperhead&quot; in 2023, Kingsolver became the first author to win the Women&#x27;s Prize for Fiction twice. Since 1993, each one of her book titles have been on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

Kingsolver was raised in rural Kentucky, lived briefly in the Congo in her early childhood, and she currently lives in Appalachia. Kingsolver earned degrees in biology, ecology, and evolutionary biology at DePauw University and the University of Arizona, and worked as a freelance writer before she began writing novels. In 2000, the politically progressive Kingsolver established the Bellwether Prize to support &quot;literature of social change&quot;.

==Biography==
Kingsolver was born in 1955 in Annapolis, Maryland, the daughter of Wendell Roy Kingsolver and Virginia Lee (née Henry) Kingsolver, but grew up in Carlisle, Kentucky. When Kingsolver was seven, her father, a physician, took the family to Léopoldville, Congo (now Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo).

After graduating from high school, Kingsolver attended DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, on a music scholarship, studying classical piano. She changed her major to biology after realizing that &quot;classical pianists compete for six job openings a year, and the rest of [them] get to play &#x27;Blue Moon&#x27; in a hotel lobby&quot;.

Kingsolver was involved in activism on her campus, and took part in protests against the Vietnam War. In 1977, Kingsolver graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a Bachelor of Science, and moved to France for a year. In 1980, she enrolled in graduate school at the University of Arizona, where she earned a master&#x27;s degree in ecology and evolutionary biology.

In 1985, Kingsolver married Joseph Hoffmann, and gave birth to their daughter Camille in 1987. During the first First Gulf War, she moved with her daughter to Tenerife in the Canary Islands for a year, mostly due to her frustration over America&#x27;s military involvement. After returning to the United States in 1992, she separated from her husband.

In 1994, Kingsolver was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters from her alma mater, DePauw University. That same year, she married Steven Lee Hopp, an ornithologist, and their daughter Lily was born in 1996. In 2004, Kingsolver moved with her family to a farm in Washington County, Virginia. In 2008, she received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Duke University, where she delivered a commencement address entitled &quot;How to Be Hopeful&quot;.

In the late 1990s, Kingsolver was a founding member of the Rock Bottom Remainders, a rock-and-roll band made up of published writers. Other band members included Amy Tan, Matt Groening, Dave Barry, and Stephen King, and they played for one week during the year. Kingsolver played the keyboard, but is no longer an active member of the band.

In a 2010 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Kingsolver said, &quot;I never wanted to be famous, and still don&#x27;t… the universe rewarded me with what I dreaded most&quot;. She said she created her own website just to compete with a plethora of fake ones &quot;as a defense to protect my family from misinformation&quot;.

Kingsolver lives in the Appalachia area of the United States. She said in 2020 that rural America is generally regarded by artistic elites with &quot;a profound antipathy&quot;.

==Writing career==

Kingsolver began her full-time writing career in the mid-1980s as a science writer for the University of Arizona, which eventually led to freelance feature writing, including many cover stories for the local alternative weekly, the &quot;Tucson Weekly&quot;. She began her career in fiction writing after winning a short-story contest in a local Phoenix newspaper.

Kingsolver&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Bean Trees&quot;, was published in 1988, and told the story of a young woman who leaves Kentucky for Arizona, adopting an abandoned child along the way; she wrote it at night while pregnant with her first child and struggling with insomnia. Her next work of fiction, published in 1990, was &quot;Homeland and Other Stories&quot;, a collection of short stories on a variety of topics exploring various themes from the evolution of cultural and ancestral lands to the struggles of marriage.

The novel &quot;Animal Dreams&quot; was also published in 1990, followed by &quot;Pigs in Heaven&quot;, the sequel to &quot;The Bean Trees&quot;, in 1993. Every book that Kingsolver has written since &quot;Pigs in Heaven&quot; has been on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

&quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot;, published in 1998, is one of her best-known works; it chronicles the lives of the wife and daughters of a Baptist missionary on a Christian mission in Africa. Although the setting of the novel is somewhat similar to Kingsolver&#x27;s own childhood in the Democratic Republic of Congo (then &quot;the Democratic Republic of Zaire&quot;), the novel is not autobiographical. The novel was chosen as an Oprah&#x27;s Book Club selection. &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; won the National Book Prize of South Africa and was shortlisted for both the Pulitzer Prize and PEN/Faulkner Award.

Her next novel, published in 2000, was &quot;Prodigal Summer&quot;, set in southern Appalachia. In 2000, she was awarded the National Humanities Medal by the U.S. President Bill Clinton.

Kingsolver wrote a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; opinion piece following the U.S. bombing of Afghanistan in the wake of the September 11 attacks, which received widespread criticism for conflating innocent Afghans with the Taliban regime. She wrote, &quot;I feel like I&#x27;m standing on a playground where the little boys are all screaming at each other, &#x27;He started it!&#x27; and throwing rocks that keep taking out another eye, another tooth. I keep looking around for somebody&#x27;s mother to come on the scene saying, &#x27;Boys! Boys! Who started it cannot possibly be the issue here. People are getting hurt. By some accounts, she was &quot;denounced as a traitor,&quot; but rebounded from these accusations and later wrote about them.

Starting in April 2005, Kingsolver and her family spent a year making every effort to eat food produced as locally as possible. Living on their farm in rural Virginia, they grew much of their own food and obtained most of the rest from their neighbors and other local farmers. Kingsolver, her husband, and her elder daughter chronicled their experiences of that year in the book &quot;Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life&quot;, published in 2007. Although exceptions were made for staple ingredients not available locally, such as coffee and olive oil, the family grew vegetables, raised livestock, made cheese, and preserved much of their harvest. &quot;Animal, Vegetable, Miracle&quot; won the 2008 James Beard Foundation Award.

Kingsolver returned to novel-writing with &quot;The Lacuna&quot;, published in 2009. Kingsolver received her first Women&#x27;s Prize for Fiction for the novel in 2010. &quot;The Lacuna&quot; won the 2010 Orange Prize for Fiction. &quot;Flight Behavior&quot; was published in 2012. It explores environmental themes and highlights the potential effects of global warming on the monarch butterfly.

In 2011, Kingsolver was the first ever recipient of the Dayton Literary Peace Prize Richard C. Holbrooke Distinguished Achievement Award. The newly named award to celebrate the U.S. diplomat who played an instrumental role in negotiating the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995. In 2014, Kingsolver was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Library of Virginia. The award recognizes outstanding and long-lasting contributions to literature by a Virginian. In 2018 the Library of Virginia named her one of the Virginia Women in History.

&quot;Unsheltered&quot; was published in 2018 and follows two families in Vineland, New Jersey with one in the 1800s and the other in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Her latest book, published in 2022, is &quot;Demon Copperhead&quot;. The novel was inspired by &quot;David Copperfield&quot; and is set in southern Appalachia, dealing with the effects of the opioid crisis on the region&#x27;s families. In 2023, &quot;Demon Copperhead&quot; received the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction alongside Hernan Diaz&#x27;s &quot;Trust&quot;, the first time the award was shared in its history.

Kingsolver is also a published poet and essayist. Two of her essay collections, &quot;High Tide in Tucson&quot; (1995) and &quot;Small Wonder&quot; (2003), have been published, and an anthology of her poetry was published in 1998 under the title &quot;Another America&quot;. Her essay &quot;Where to Begin&quot; appears in the anthology &quot;Knitting Yarns: Writers on Knitting &quot;(2013), published by W. W. Norton &amp; Company. Her prose poetry also accompanied photographs by Annie Griffiths Belt in a 2002 work titled &quot;Last Stand: America&#x27;s Virgin Lands&quot;.

Her major nonfiction works include her 1990 publication &quot;Holding the Line: Women in the Great Arizona Mine Strike of 1983&quot; and 2007&#x27;s &quot;Animal, Vegetable, Miracle&quot;, a description of eating locally. She has also been published as a science journalist in periodicals such as &quot;Economic Botany&quot; on topics such as desert plants and bioresources.

==Bellwether Prize==
In 2000, Kingsolver established the Bellwether Prize for Fiction. Named for the bellwether, the literary prize supports writers whose works support positive social change. The award is given to a U.S. citizen for a previously unpublished work of fiction that addresses issues of social justice. The Bellwether Prize is awarded in even-numbered years and includes guaranteed major publication and a cash prize of US$25,000, fully funded by Kingsolver. She has stated that she wanted to create a literary prize to &quot;encourage writers, publishers, and readers to consider how fiction engages visions of social change and human justice&quot;.
In May 2011, the PEN American Center announced it would take over administration of the prize, to be known as the PEN/Bellwether Prize for Socially Engaged Fiction.

==Literary style and themes==
Kingsolver has written novels in both the first-person and third-person narrative styles, and she frequently employs overlapping narratives.

Kingsolver often writes about places and situations with which she is familiar; many of her stories are based in places she has lived, such as Central Africa, Arizona, and Appalachia. She has stated that her novels are not autobiographical, although there are often commonalities between her life and her work. Her work is often strongly idealistic and has been called a form of activism.

Her characters are frequently written around struggles for social equality, such as the hardships faced by undocumented immigrants, the working poor, and single mothers. Other common themes in her work include the balancing of individuality with the desire to live in a community, and the interaction and conflict between humans and the ecosystems in which they live. Kingsolver has been said to use prose and engaging narratives to make historical events, such as the Congo&#x27;s struggles for independence, more interesting and engaging for the average reader.

<text>Emergentism is the belief in emergence, particularly as it involves consciousness and the philosophy of mind. A property of a system is said to be emergent if it is a new outcome of some other properties of the system and their interaction, while it is itself different from them. Within the philosophy of science, emergentism is analyzed both as it contrasts with and parallels reductionism.
This philosophical theory suggests that higher-level properties and phenomena arise from the interactions and organization of lower-level entities yet are not reducible to these simpler components. It emphasizes the idea that the whole is more than the sum of its parts.

== History ==

=== Early concepts of emergence ===
The concept of emergence can be traced back to ancient philosophical traditions. Aristotle, in particular, suggested that the whole could possess properties that its individual parts did not, laying an early foundation for emergentist thought. This idea persisted through the ages, influencing various schools of thought.

The term &quot;emergence&quot; was formally introduced in the 19th century by the philosopher George Henry Lewes. He distinguished between &quot;resultant&quot; and &quot;emergent&quot; properties, where resultant properties could be predicted from the properties of the parts, whereas emergent properties could not. This distinction was crucial in differentiating emergent phenomena from simple aggregative effects.

=== Development in the 20th century ===

In the early 20th century, emergentism gained further traction through the works of British emergentists like C.D. Broad and Samuel Alexander. C.D. Broad, in his 1925 book &quot;The Mind and Its Place in Nature&quot;, argued that mental states were emergent properties of brain processes. Samuel Alexander, in his work &quot;Space, Time, and Deity&quot;, suggested that emergent qualities like consciousness and life could not be fully explained by the underlying physical processes alone.

These philosophers were reacting against the reductionist view that all phenomena could be fully explained by their constituent parts. They argued that emergent properties such as consciousness have their own causal powers and cannot be reduced to or predicted from their base components. This period also saw the influence of Gestalt psychology, which emphasized that psychological phenomena cannot be understood solely by analyzing their component parts, further supporting emergentist ideas.

=== Mid to late 20th century advances ===

During the mid-20th century, emergentism was somewhat overshadowed by the rise of behaviorism and later the cognitive sciences, which often leaned towards more reductionist explanations. However, the concept of emergence found renewed interest towards the late 20th century with the advent of complex systems theory and non-linear dynamics.

In this period, scientists and philosophers began to explore how complex behaviors and properties could arise from relatively simple interactions in systems as diverse as ant colonies, economic markets, and neural networks. This interdisciplinary approach highlighted the ubiquity and importance of emergent phenomena across different domains, from physics to biology to social sciences.

=== Contemporary developments ===

In recent years, emergentism has continued to evolve, integrating insights from various scientific fields. For example, in physics, the study of phenomena such as superconductivity and the behavior of complex quantum systems has provided empirical examples of emergent properties. In biology, the study of complex biological networks and the dynamics of ecosystems has further illustrated how emergent properties play a crucial role in natural systems.

The resurgence of interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning has also contributed to contemporary discussions on emergentism. Researchers in these fields are particularly interested in how intelligent behavior and consciousness might emerge from artificial systems, providing new perspectives and challenges for emergentist theories.

== Forms ==
Emergentism can be compatible with physicalism, the theory that the universe is composed exclusively of physical entities, and in particular with the evidence relating changes in the brain with changes in mental functioning. 

Some varieties of emergentism are not specifically concerned with the mind–body problem but constitute a theory of the nature of the universe comparable to pantheism. They suggest a hierarchical or layered view of the whole of nature, with the layers arranged in terms of increasing complexity with each requiring its own special science.

== Core principles of emergentism ==

Emergentism is underpinned by several core principles that define its theoretical framework and distinguish it from other philosophical doctrines such as reductionism and holism.

=== Definition and nature of emergence ===

Emergence refers to the arising of novel and coherent structures, patterns, and properties during the process of self-organization in complex systems. These emergent properties are not predictable from the properties of the individual components alone. Emergent properties are seen as a result of the interactions and relationships between the components of a system, which produce new behaviors and characteristics that are not present in the isolated parts. This concept is crucial in understanding why certain phenomena cannot be fully explained by analyzing their parts independently.

=== Types of emergence ===

Emergentism distinguishes between two main types of emergence: weak and strong.

* Weak emergence: This type of emergence involves properties that can in principle be derived from the interactions of lower-level entities but are not immediately obvious. These properties are emergent in the sense that they are the result of complex interactions but do not involve fundamentally new properties. For instance, the behavior of a computer program can be understood by examining its code, but the complexity of the program&#x27;s behavior may not be immediately apparent from the code alone.
* Strong emergence: This type of emergence involves properties that are fundamentally new and cannot be predicted or explained by the behavior of the lower-level components. Strong emergent properties are seen as novel qualities that arise from the complex interactions within a system. An example often cited in discussions of strong emergence is consciousness, which some argue cannot be fully explained by the physical processes of the brain alone.

=== Key characteristics ===

Emergent properties are characterized by several key features that distinguish them from simple aggregative properties:

* Irreducibility: Emergent properties cannot be reduced to or fully explained by their constituent parts. This means that understanding the individual components of a system is not sufficient to understand the emergent properties that arise from their interactions. For example, the wetness of water is an emergent property that cannot be understood solely by examining individual water molecules.
* Novel properties: Emergent systems exhibit new properties that are not present in their individual components. These properties arise from the complex interactions and relationships between the parts of the system. The novelty of emergent properties is a key aspect that distinguishes them from the properties of the individual parts.
* Non-linearity: The relationship between the parts of a system and its emergent properties is often non-linear, meaning that small changes in the components or their interactions can lead to large and unexpected changes in the emergent properties. This non-linearity is a hallmark of complex systems and is a crucial aspect of emergent phenomena.
* Context-dependence: Emergent properties are often context-dependent, meaning that they arise from the specific organization and interactions within a system. Changes in the context or organization of the system can lead to changes in the emergent properties. This context-dependence highlights the importance of considering the system as a whole when studying emergent phenomena.

== Theoretical foundations ==

The theoretical foundations of emergentism are deeply intertwined with various philosophical theories and debates, particularly those concerning the nature of reality, the relationship between parts and wholes, and the nature of causality. Emergentism contrasts sharply with reductionism, which attempts to explain complex phenomena entirely in terms of their simpler components, and holism, which emphasizes the whole without necessarily addressing the emergence of properties.

=== Relationship to other philosophical theories ===

Emergentism stands in contrast to reductionism, which holds that all phenomena can be fully explained by their constituent parts. Reductionists argue that understanding the basic building blocks of a system provides a complete understanding of the system itself. However, emergentists contend that this approach overlooks the novel properties that arise from complex interactions within a system. For example, while the properties of water can be traced back to hydrogen and oxygen atoms, the wetness of water cannot be fully explained by examining these atoms in isolation.

Holism, on the other hand, emphasizes the significance of the whole system, suggesting that the properties of the whole are more important than the properties of the parts. Emergentism agrees with holism to some extent but differs in that it specifically focuses on how new properties emerge from the interactions within the system. Holism often overlooks the dynamic processes that lead to the emergence of new properties, which are central to emergentism.

=== Relationship to vitalism ===

Emmeche &quot;et al.&quot; (1998) state that &quot;there is a very important difference between the vitalists and the emergentists: the vitalist&#x27;s creative forces were relevant only in organic substances, not in inorganic matter. Emergence hence is creation of new properties regardless of the substance involved.&quot; &quot;The assumption of an extra-physical vitalis (vital force, entelechy, élan vital, etc.), as formulated in most forms (old or new) of vitalism, is usually without any genuine explanatory power. It has served altogether too often as an intellectual tranquilizer or verbal sedative—stifling scientific inquiry rather than encouraging it to proceed in new directions.&quot;

=== Ontological vs. epistemological emergentism ===

Emergentism can be divided into ontological and epistemological categories, each addressing different aspects of emergent properties.

* Ontological emergentism: This perspective asserts that emergent properties genuinely exist in the world. Ontological emergentists argue that emergent properties are real and have causal powers. For example, the consciousness that arises from neural processes in the brain is seen as a real, causally efficacious property that cannot be reduced to or predicted from the underlying physical processes alone.
* Epistemological emergentism: This perspective suggests that emergent properties arise due to our limitations in knowledge and understanding. According to epistemological emergentists, what we perceive as emergent properties are actually the result of complex interactions that we do not yet fully understand. Therefore, these properties are not fundamentally new but appear so because of our current epistemic limitations.

=== Causality in emergentism ===

A crucial aspect of emergentism is its treatment of causality, particularly the concept of downward causation. Downward causation refers to the influence that higher-level properties can exert on the behavior of lower-level entities within a system. This idea challenges the traditional view that causation only works from the bottom up, from simpler to more complex levels.

* Downward causation: Emergentists argue that emergent properties can have causal effects on the components of the system from which they arise. For instance, social structures and norms can influence individual behavior, even though these structures and norms themselves emerge from the interactions between individuals. This two-way causal relationship is a key feature of emergent systems.
* Two-way causality: In emergent systems, causality is not unidirectional. While lower-level interactions give rise to emergent properties, these emergent properties can, in turn, affect the behavior and interactions at the lower level. This bidirectional causality highlights the complexity and interdependence of emergent systems, making them resistant to reductionist explanations.

== Scientific perspectives ==

Emergentism finds its scientific support and application across various disciplines, illustrating how complex behaviors and properties arise from simpler interactions. These scientific perspectives demonstrate the practical significance of emergentist theories.

=== Emergence in physics ===

In physics, emergence is observed in phenomena where macroscopic properties arise from the interactions of microscopic components. A classic example is superconductivity, where the collective behavior of electrons in certain materials leads to the phenomenon of zero electrical resistance. This emergent property cannot be fully explained by the properties of individual electrons alone, but rather by their interactions within the lattice structure of the material.

Another significant example is quantum entanglement, where particles become interconnected in such a way that the state of one particle instantly influences the state of another, regardless of the distance between them. This non-local property emerges from the quantum interactions and cannot be predicted merely by understanding the individual particles separately. Such emergent properties challenge classical notions of locality and causality, showcasing the profound implications of emergentism in modern physics.

In thermodynamics, emergent behaviors are observed in non-equilibrium systems where patterns and structures spontaneously form. For instance, Bénard cells — a phenomenon where heated fluid forms hexagonal convection cells — arise from thermal gradients and fluid dynamics. This self-organization is an emergent property of the system, highlighting how macro-level order can emerge from micro-level interactions.

=== Emergence in biology ===

Emergent phenomena are prevalent in biology, particularly in the study of life and evolutionary processes. One of the most fundamental examples is the emergence of life from non-living chemical compounds. This process, often studied through the lens of abiogenesis, involves complex chemical reactions that lead to self-replicating molecules and eventually living organisms. The properties of life — such as metabolism, growth, and reproduction — emerge from these molecular interactions and cannot be fully understood by examining individual molecules in isolation.

In evolutionary biology, the diversity of life forms arises from genetic mutations, natural selection, and environmental interactions. Complex traits such as the eye or the brain emerge over time through evolutionary processes. These traits exhibit novel properties that are not predictable from the genetic components alone but result from the dynamic interplay between genes and the environment.

Systems biology further illustrates emergent properties in biological networks. For example, metabolic networks where enzymes and substrates interact exhibit emergent behaviors like robustness and adaptability. These properties are crucial for the survival of organisms in changing environments and arise from the complex interconnections within the network.

=== Emergence in cognitive science ===

In cognitive science, emergentism plays a crucial role in understanding consciousness and cognitive processes. Consciousness is often cited as a paradigmatic example of an emergent property. While neural processes in the brain involve electrochemical interactions among neurons, the subjective experience of consciousness arises from these processes in a way that is not directly reducible to them. This emergence of conscious experience from neural substrates is a central topic in the philosophy of mind and cognitive science.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning provide contemporary examples of emergent behavior in artificial systems. Complex algorithms and neural networks can learn, adapt, and exhibit intelligent behavior that is not explicitly programmed. For instance, deep learning models can recognize patterns and make decisions based on vast amounts of data, demonstrating emergent intelligence from simpler computational rules. This emergent behavior in AI systems reflects the principles of emergentism, where higher-level functions arise from the interaction of lower-level components.

=== Emergentism and language ===

Emergentism and language are intricately connected through the concept that linguistic properties and structures arise from simpler interactions among cognitive, communicative and social processes. This perspective provides a dynamic view of language development, structure, and evolution, emphasizing the role of interaction and adaptation over innate or static principles. This connection can be explored from several angles:
====Linguistic emergence====
* Language development: Emergentism posits that language structures and rules emerge from the interaction of simpler neural and cognitive processes rather than being innate or pre-programmed. This idea contrasts with Noam Chomsky&#x27;s theory of Universal Grammar, which suggests that the ability to acquire language is hard-wired into the brain. Emergentists argue that language arises from general cognitive capabilities such as pattern recognition and memory interacting with environmental input.
* Syntax and grammar: Syntax and grammatical rules are seen as emergent properties resulting from the usage patterns of speakers within a language community. As individuals communicate, certain patterns become regularized and form the basis of syntactic rules. These rules are not explicitly taught but emerge naturally from the communicative practices of the community.
* Connectionist models: In computational linguistics, connectionist or neural network models provide a framework for understanding how language properties can emerge from simpler processes. These models simulate how neural connections in the brain can give rise to complex behaviors like language comprehension and production through learning and interaction. For instance, a neural network might learn to generate grammatically correct sentences by being exposed to large datasets of language, demonstrating emergent properties from the training data.
* Language evolution: From a sociolinguistic perspective, the evolution of language itself can be viewed through an emergentist lens. Languages change and develop new properties over time as speakers interact, adapt, and innovate. These changes are emergent phenomena resulting from social interaction, cultural exchange, and cognitive adaptation.
====Pragmatics and Semantics====
* Pragmatics and semantics: Emergentism also applies to the way meaning (semantics) and context (pragmatics) are derived in language. Meaning is not fixed but emerges from the use of words in specific contexts. Pragmatic rules such as implicatures and speech acts arise from the conventions and expectations of communication within a community. These rules are not pre-determined but develop dynamically as speakers interact.
* Child language development: In the context of language acquisition, emergentism suggests that children learn language through interaction with their environment and the gradual build-up of linguistic structures. Children are exposed to language data and through cognitive processes such as pattern recognition and hypothesis testing develop an understanding of linguistic rules. This process is emergent because it arises from the interaction of the child&#x27;s cognitive capabilities with the linguistic input they receive.

==== Literary emergentism ====

Literary emergentism is a trend in literary theory. It arises as a reaction against traditional interpretive approaches – hermeneutics, structuralism, semiotics, etc., accusing them of analytical reductionism and lack of hierarchy. Literary emergentism claims to describe the emergence of a text as contemplative logic consisting of seven degrees, similar to the epistemological doctrine of Rudolf Steiner in his Philosophy of Freedom. There are also references to Terrence Deacon, author of the theory of Incomplete nature, according to whom the emergent perspective is metaphysical, whereas the human consciousness emerges as an incessant creation of something from nothing. According to Dimitar Kalev, in all modern literary-theoretical discourses, there is an epistemological &quot;gap&quot; present between the sensory-imagery phenomena of reading and their proto-phenomena from the text. Therefore, in any attempt at literary reconstructions, certain &quot;destruction&quot; is reached, which, from an epistemological point of view, is a designation of the existing transcendence as some &quot;interruption&quot; of the divine &quot;top-down&quot;. The emergentist approach does not interpret the text but rather reconstructs its becoming, identifying itself with the contemplative logic of the writer, claiming that it possesses a being of ideal objectivity and universal accessibility.

== Criticisms and debates ==

Emergentism, like any philosophical theory, has been subject to various criticisms and debates. These discussions revolve around the validity of emergent properties, the explanatory power of emergentism, and its implications for other areas of philosophy and science.

=== Main criticisms ===

* Lack of empirical evidence: One of the primary criticisms of emergentism is the perceived lack of empirical evidence supporting the existence of emergent properties. Critics argue that many so-called emergent properties can eventually be explained by more detailed examination of lower-level processes. For instance, while consciousness is often cited as an emergent property, some scientists believe that advances in neuroscience may eventually explain it in purely physical terms.
* Conceptual ambiguity: The term &quot;emergence&quot; is sometimes criticized for being vague and inconsistently defined. Critics argue that without a clear and precise definition, the concept of emergence can be too flexible, leading to its overuse or misuse in various contexts. This ambiguity can make it difficult to distinguish genuine emergent properties from those that are merely complex.
* Reductionist arguments: Reductionists argue that all phenomena, including those considered emergent, can ultimately be explained by their constituent parts and the laws governing them. They contend that emergentism often underestimates the explanatory power of reductionist approaches and overestimates the novelty of emergent properties. According to reductionists, what appears to be emergent might simply be the result of incomplete understanding of the underlying processes.

=== Responses to criticisms ===

* Philosophical counterarguments: Proponents of emergentism argue that emergent properties are necessary to explain the complexity of certain phenomena. They maintain that some properties cannot be reduced to or predicted from their constituent parts, emphasizing the importance of considering the system as a whole. For example, the wetness of water or the behavior of a market cannot be fully understood by analyzing individual molecules or transactions alone.
* Scientific evidence Supporting Emergence: Emergentists point to various examples in physics, biology, and cognitive science where emergent properties provide the best explanations for observed phenomena. In physics, phenomena such as superconductivity and quantum entanglement are often cited as cases where emergent properties are crucial for understanding the behavior of systems. In biology, the emergence of life from non-living matter and the complex behavior of ecosystems are seen as evidence supporting emergentist views.
* Clarifying definitions and criteria: In response to the criticism of conceptual ambiguity, some philosophers and scientists have worked on providing clearer definitions and criteria for emergence. They aim to distinguish between weak and strong emergence more precisely and to specify the conditions under which properties can be considered genuinely emergent. This effort helps to reduce the flexibility and potential misuse of the concept.

These criticisms and debates highlight the dynamic and evolving nature of emergentism, reflecting its impact and relevance across various fields of inquiry. By addressing these challenges, proponents of emergentism continue to refine and strengthen their theoretical framework.

== Applications of emergentism ==

Emergentism finds applications across various scientific and philosophical domains, illustrating how complex behaviors and properties can arise from simpler interactions. These applications underscore the practical relevance of emergentist theories and their impact on understanding complex systems.

=== In science ===

* Complex systems: Emergentism provides a framework for understanding complex systems in various scientific fields. In physics, emergent properties such as superconductivity arise from the collective behavior of electrons, which cannot be fully explained by examining individual electrons alone. This collective behavior demonstrates how new properties emerge from the interactions within the system, offering insights into phenomena that are otherwise difficult to explain through reductionist approaches.
* Network theory: Network theory applies emergentist principles to study how interactions within networks lead to emergent properties. In biology, for example, metabolic networks exhibit robustness and adaptability as emergent behaviors arising from the interactions of enzymes and substrates. These properties are crucial for the survival of organisms in changing environments and provide a deeper understanding of biological resilience and adaptation.
* Quantum mechanics: In quantum mechanics, phenomena such as quantum entanglement and superposition illustrate emergent properties that challenge classical notions of causality and locality. These properties emerge from the complex interactions of quantum particles, providing a richer understanding of the fundamental nature of matter and energy. Emergentist approaches in quantum mechanics help bridge the gap between microscopic and macroscopic descriptions of physical systems.

=== In philosophy ===

* Philosophy of mind: Emergentism plays a significant role in the philosophy of mind, particularly in discussions about consciousness and mental states. It offers an alternative to reductionist views by suggesting that mental properties emerge from neural processes but possess their own causal powers. This perspective helps address the mind-body problem by proposing that consciousness is an emergent property that cannot be fully explained by physical processes alone, thus enriching our understanding of the nature of mind and cognition.
* Ethics and morality: Emergentist theories are applied in ethics to explain how moral values and ethical principles can emerge from social and cultural interactions. According to emergentism, ethical norms and values are not pre-existing entities but arise from the complex interactions and agreements within a society. This view helps to understand the dynamic and evolving nature of morality, providing a framework for addressing ethical issues in a rapidly changing world.
* Epistemology: In epistemology, emergentism is used to explore how knowledge and understanding arise from simpler cognitive processes. Emergentist theories suggest that our ability to form concepts, reason, and understand complex phenomena results from the interactions of more basic cognitive functions. This approach provides insights into the nature of knowledge and the processes underlying learning and comprehension.

=== Interdisciplinary applications ===

* Artificial intelligence: In artificial intelligence (AI), emergentist principles are used to develop systems that exhibit intelligent behavior through the interaction of simpler algorithms. Machine learning models, such as neural networks, demonstrate how complex behaviors can emerge from the training and adaptation processes. These models learn to recognize patterns and make decisions based on large datasets, reflecting the principles of emergentism in their design and functionality.
* Sociology and economics: Emergentism is applied in sociology and economics to understand how complex social behaviors and economic trends arise from individual actions and interactions. In sociology, emergentist theories help explain how social norms, institutions, and collective behaviors develop from the interactions of individuals within a society. In economics, emergent properties such as market trends and economic cycles are seen as the result of numerous individual decisions and actions, providing a comprehensive framework for analyzing economic phenomena.
* Linguistics: Emergentist approaches in linguistics study how language structures and rules emerge from the interactions and usage patterns of speakers. Syntax, grammar, and meaning are seen as emergent properties resulting from social interactions and cognitive processes. This perspective provides a dynamic understanding of language development and evolution, highlighting the role of interaction and adaptation in linguistic phenomena.

These applications of emergentism illustrate its broad relevance and utility in explaining and understanding complex systems across various domains, highlighting the interdisciplinary impact of emergentist theories.

<text>Radlin is a town in Wodzisław County, Silesian Voivodeship, Poland, with 17,776 inhabitants (2019). Located in southern part of the Voivodeship, close to the Czech border, between 1975 and 1997, Radlin was a district of the city of Wodzisław Śląski.

==History==
First mention of the settlement of &quot;Biertułtowy&quot; (which now makes the center of Radlin) comes from 1305, as &quot;Bertholdi villa&quot;. The very name Radlin probably comes from the Polish word &quot;radło&quot;, which means ard. In the 19th century, Radlin was one of the biggest villages of the Rybnik County of the Kingdom of Prussia. Like other locations of Upper Silesia, it grew in the 19th century, when several enterprises were opened there – &quot;Coal Mine Marcel&quot;, &quot;Coke Plant Radlin&quot;. In 1922, after Silesian Uprisings, it became part of Poland.

==Sport==
*Górnik Radlin – men&#x27;s volleyball team playing in Polish Volleyball League
*KS Górnik Radlin – men&#x27;s football team
*KG Radlin – gymnastic club, founded in 1920, where trained 20 Polish Olympic athletes

==Sights==
* Graduation Tower in Radlin – first graduation tower on an industrial side of Upper Silesia in Poland 
*Kolonia Emma in Radlin – modernist estate of the nineteenth century designed as a &quot;garden city&quot;

==Notable people==
*Bolesław Kominek (1903–1974), Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church
*Leszek Blanik (born 1977), gymnast, World and Olympic champion

<doc id="783934" wikidata="Q1062097" url="?curid=783934" title="Beats, Rhymes and Life">
<text>Beats, Rhymes and Life is the fourth studio album by American hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest. Released on July 30, 1996, by Jive Records, it followed three years after the highly regarded and successful &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot;. Produced by The Ummah, the album is a departure from the joyful, positive vibe of the group&#x27;s earlier albums and is regarded as their darkest album in content. It debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on October 27, 1998.

== Background ==
In September 1993, shortly after the recording of &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot; had concluded, Phife Dawg moved to Atlanta. Along with Q-Tip&#x27;s conversion to Islam the following year, the addition of Jay Dee to the group&#x27;s new production team, The Ummah, and the enlistment of guest rapper Consequence, Q-Tip&#x27;s cousin, the group dynamic changed drastically. Phife Dawg later stated that &quot;the chemistry was dead, shot&quot;, while Q-Tip felt that becoming a Muslim &quot;made the atmosphere much more serious.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==
For &quot;Beats, Rhymes and Life&quot;, The Ummah created a minimalist sound reminiscent of &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;, which Ali Shaheed Muhammad described as &quot;nothing extravagant, nothing far out.&quot; Miles Marshall Lewis of &quot;The Source&quot; praised The Ummah for being &quot;the most proficient in the rap game at using samples as instruments in themselves.&quot; Regarding Jay Dee&#x27;s five contributions to the album, Q-Tip stated, &quot;He would just send me the beats and then I would lay them.&quot; One of his contributions, the lead single &quot;1nce Again&quot;, was hailed as &quot;one of the few successes&quot; on the album and a &quot;surprising R&amp;B crossover.&quot;

Lyrically, the group addresses &quot;everything from O.J. to spirituality&quot; and were recognized for the complexity of their messages. However, they were criticized for sounding &quot;bored&quot;, &quot;confused, hostile, and occasionally paranoid.&quot; In the song &quot;Keeping It Moving&quot;, Q-Tip responds to the diss comments made about him in MC Hammer&#x27;s songs &quot;Break &#x27;Em Off Somethin&#x27; Proper&quot; and &quot;Funky Headhunter&quot;, as well as Westside Connection&#x27;s song &quot;Cross &#x27;Em out and Put a K&quot;. In the first verse, he says that comments previously made about the West Coast were not intended to be a diss and that people should not misinterpret his lyrics.

==Reception==

&quot;Beats, Rhymes and Life&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), on October 27, 1998, with shipments of one million copies in the United States, becoming the group&#x27;s most commercially successful album.

The album received mostly positive reviews from music critics. Ernest Hardy of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;near-flawless&quot;, while commending The Ummah for their &quot;irresistible&quot; production, and the group for &quot;spinning universal themes from an Afrocentric loom, with positivity balanced against subtly subversive street reporting.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Cheo Tyehimba described it as &quot;the return of playful yet potent hip-hop&quot; and praised the &quot;trademark originality&quot; of the group&#x27;s lyrics. Will Hermes of &quot;Spin&quot; credited the group for performing &quot;with a sleight of hand that lets them get intelligent without ruining the party&quot;, however, he felt that &quot;over the three fallow years since the group&#x27;s last record, they&#x27;ve been dealing with a real crisis of musical faith.&quot; Robert Christgau gave the album a three-star honorable mention in his consumer guide for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, noting that the group fights &quot;sensationalist obscurity with philosophic subtlety&quot;, which he believed was ineffective. Christgau highlighted &quot;Jam&quot;, &quot;Crew&quot; and &quot;The Hop&quot; as standout tracks.

In the 5th edition of his &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot;, Colin Larkin praised the group&#x27;s &quot;highly evolved&quot; lyrics and lauded them for &quot;addressing issues with greater philosophy than the crude banter of their past recordings.&quot; Despite calling the album &quot;the group&#x27;s most disappointing listen&quot;, John Bush of AllMusic credited it as &quot;a dedication to the streets and the hip-hop underground.&quot;

&quot;Beats, Rhymes and Life&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album and &quot;1nce Again&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group, presented at the 39th Grammy Awards in 1997.

<text>Raahe (; ; ) is a town in Finland, located on the western coast of the country. Raahe is situated in the North Ostrobothnia region, along the Gulf of Bothnia. The population of Raahe is approximately , while the sub-region has a population of approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland.

Founded in 1649 by the Swedish statesman and Governor General of Finland, Count Per Brahe the Younger, it is one of 10 remaining historic wooden towns (or town centres) in Finland. Examples of other historic wooden towns in Finland are Kaskinen (Kaskö), Old Rauma, Porvoo (Borgå), Jakobstad (Pietarsaari) and Vaasa (Vasa). After a devastating fire in 1810, Raahe was rebuilt according to new design principles that minimised the risk of fire and enlarged some of the civic spaces. &quot;Old Raahe&quot; (or &quot;Wooden Raahe&quot;) is notable for its Renaissance-inspired rectilinear town plan with an unusual central square (called &quot;Pekkatori&quot;) with closed corners.

Raahe is located southwest of Oulu and northeast of Kokkola, and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is .. Historically an agricultural and maritime region, Ostrobothnia supplied the largest number of immigrants from Finland to the USA and other countries such as Canada and Australia during the Great Migration of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The neighbouring municipalities of Raahe are Haapavesi, Oulainen, Pyhäjoki, Siikajoki and Siikalatva. Founded as a Swedish- and Finnish-speaking town, the municipality is now unilingually Finnish.

Three parishes have been merged with Raahe: Saloinen in 1973, Pattijoki in 2003 and Vihanti in 2013.

The asteroid 1786 Raahe was named after the town and the municipality.

== History ==
=== Before the establishment ===
The area of Raahe was originally a part of the parish of Saloinen, known until 1913 as &quot;Salo&quot;. It was one of the first parishes in northern Ostrobothnia.
=== Seventeenth century history ===

Count Per Brahe the Younger, the governor-general of Finland, gave a charter to the town of &quot;Salo&quot; (not to be confused with Salo in Finland Proper) in the year of 1649 with the purpose of constructing a town at Satamakangas, near the old harbour site. However, the harbour area had become so low that the future town was decided to be transferred. A new and better location was found further to the north, at the bay of Raahe. Having acquired the possession of the parish of Salo in 1652, Per Brahe renamed the town Brahestad or Raahe in Finnish.

The planning of the town for the purpose of building Raahe was given to the surveyor Claes Claesson. His town plan followed the ideals of the regular grid plan of the Renaissance. All of the streets of Raahe were of equal width of 20-21 cubits or 10–11 meters. The market square stood by Rantakatu and the Town Hall behind the square. At the northeast corner of the town stood the church and the schoolhouse. Six blocks were realized of the town plan, i.e. the area surrounded by present-day Koulukatu, Kirkkokatu, Saaristokatu and Rantakatu. The later expansion and changes of the town have held the ambitions of Claesson&#x27;s town plan in respect until the beginning of the latest century.

The oldest picture still remaining of the town of Raahe, a seventeenth-century drawing, dates back to the year of 1659. It depicts the town as being surrounded by a so-called customs fence with two custom gates, the eastern one located outside of the crossroads of present-day Brahenkatu and Reiponkatu streets and the southern one at the end of Pitkäkatu street (present-day Kauppakatu street) approximately by present-day Koulukatu street. The busy harbour of the town was located on the shore by the customs warehouse, the present museum.

There were two public buildings in Raahe: a handsome, admirable, two-story town hall with a tower, and a wooden church, whose construction had already begun in 1651. The church was given a weather boarding already in 1684-1685. This is one of the earliest examples of boarding known in Finland.

The dwellings and houses were made from logs. As a rule, they were built close to the street facing plot boundary, the long side and the ridge of the roof parallel to the street. The unbuilt portion of the plot against the street was fitted up with a high, solid plank fence and a drive-in gate. The plots inside a block were not separated by fences. The average house usually consisted of one or two rooms, most of which were of the two-room cabin type. Almost every house in the drawing of Raahe has the most remarkable novelty of the seventeenth century, the chimney. At the same time it was still quite common to have whole towns and villages with chimneyless houses, especially in Eastern Finland. Considered from the point of view of architectural history, at the time of its foundation Raahe was a quite modern town. As far as is known today, no buildings exist from the seventeenth century.

=== 18th century ===
The Great Northern War, fought in the first two decades of the 18th century, and the Great Wrath nearly destroyed the town. In 1705, the population had been 641, while after the war this had decreased to 134, and the majority of the merchant class had escaped the war to Sweden. The town slowly recovered after the war, and trading started again. Raahe was given the right to international trade in 1791, which further enlivened the town&#x27;s traffic and commerce. Goods such as tar, boards, tallow, butter, and fur were traded through Raahe, and improved road connections increased the competitiveness of the harbour.

==Climate==
== Economy ==

Raahe was granted Staple port rights in 1791 and was traditionally a harbor town. With industrialization, Raahe was reinvented as a steel and heavy industry city and has further developed with engineering services, ICT and software production. Raahe is known for steel, heavy machinery, engineering works, shipping and ICT. The Rautaruukki steel mill, which up to the 1980s was the largest single industrial site in the Nordic countries, is located in Raahe. The mill produces steel plate, coil and sheeting and semi-finished products for the engineering works.

Traditionally, Raahe was a port city. In the late Age of Sail, the 1850s and on, shipping companies in Raahe owned Finland&#x27;s largest fleet of sailing vessels, 60 in total at their height. Currently, the port of Raahe is the sixth busiest port in the country, with 700 ships visiting each year. Cargo that is transported through the port includes raw materials and loose cargo, steel, lumber, containers and contract-shipped goods.

With the steel industry, Raahe has grown into the third largest city in the ex-Oulu province, after Oulu and Kajaani. Like Oulu, the city promotes the ICT business, with the help of the steel industry (ProMetal and Steelpolis) and ICT industry (Softpolis) business incubators/business parks.

The municipal tax rate is 19.75%. In 2007, the structure of the economy was as follows: agriculture and forestry 1%, construction 6%, manufacturing 43%, and retail, services and public services 50%. The sub-region includes the municipalities of Pyhäjoki and Siikajoki.

==Sports==
The men&#x27;s pesäpallo team Pattijoen Urheilijat competes in the Superpesis national league, playing at Rännäri Stadium.

==Transportation==
The European route E8 goes through the city, and is the biggest mean of land transportation in Raahe. Raahe also has bus transportation by various companies. The Raahe railway station next to the Raahe Railroad was closed from passenger traffic in 1966. Ticket selling ended in 2000.

<text>Raisio (; ) is a town in Finland, located in the Southwest Finland region. It lies north of the regional capital, Turku. The population of Raisio is approximately , while the sub-region has a population of approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland, and the third largest municipality in the Southwest Finland region after Turku ja Kaarina.

The town of Raisio has a land area of , and has about of coastline to the Bay of Raisio at its southern tip.

The coat of arms of Raisio is inspired by Martin of Tours, the patron saint of the medieval stone church of Raisio parish. The coat of arms was designed by Olof Eriksson and approved for use on 23 April 1954.

==History==

The oldest known written record of Raisio is from 1292, and there is strong evidence of Stone Age settlement in the area, but Raisio did not become a town until 1974. It was an agricultural area until the late 20th century. The success of the Raisio Group company transformed the town into an industrial centre and triggered a huge increase in population - during the 20th century the population of Raisio increased elevenfold. The town&#x27;s existence was threatened by Turku city&#x27;s plans to merge with Raisio. This changed after the Raisio Group became a successful company.

==Name==
The name &quot;Raisio&quot; was originally given to the river Raisionjoki. The earliest form of the river&#x27;s name is &quot;Raisajoki&quot;, which means &quot;marsh/bog river&quot;, and etymological evidence for this can be found in the Estonian word &quot;raisnik&quot;, which means &quot;mire&quot;. Another theory about the etymology of the name &quot;Raisio&quot; is that it comes from the word &quot;raiskio&quot;, meaning a forest damaged by poor forest management, as the Raisio landscape was altered by siltation and post-glacial uplift after the Ice Age.

<text>John Martin Schaeberle (January 10, 1853 – September 17, 1924) was a Kingdom of Württemberg-born American astronomer.

==Biography==
He was born Johann Martin Schäberle in Kingdom of Württemberg, but in 1854 immigrated as an infant to the United States. Most sources refer to him as John M. Schaeberle, but his family and friends called him Martin.

He attended public schools, and then became an apprentice in a machine shop. During his apprenticeship, he became interested in astronomy, and decided to finish high school. He then became a student of James Craig Watson at the University of Michigan. He graduated from the University of Michigan in 1876 as a civil engineer, but devoted himself to astronomy. He taught astronomy at the University of Michigan from 1876 to 1888. He maintained his own private observatory and discovered three comets. In 1888 he became one of the inaugural astronomers at Lick Observatory.

He had charge of the expedition to witness the solar eclipse at Cayenne in 1889, and of those for the same purpose to Chile in 1893, and to Japan in 1896. He designed the &quot;Schaeberle camera&quot; to take pictures of the Sun and its corona during total solar eclipses. He also discovered Procyon B, the faint companion star of Procyon, in 1896.

He resigned from Lick Observatory when James E. Keeler was made its director instead of him in 1898, despite the fact that he had been acting director since the previous year. He devoted some time to travel, and then continued astronomical studies in Ann Arbor. He never held another astronomical post. He was also an athlete and musician. He was a frequent contributor to astronomical journals.

Schaeberle died in Ann Arbor. There are craters named after him on both the Moon and on Mars.

==Comets discovered==
*C/1880 G1 (Schaeberle)
*C/1881 N1 (Schaeberle)

== Name ==
The name of the municipality means &quot;iron pond&quot;, which is also why the coat of arms of the municipality features the symbol of iron.

== History ==

The village was first mentioned in 1549, when it was a part of the parish (&quot;pitäjä&quot;) of Sysmä. Even though Rautalampi was a part of Tavastia, most of its settlers were Savonians who came to the area in the 16th century. The oldest documents (1552-1554) on Rautalampi only mention 22 Tavastian settlers in the area, while there were 57 Savonian settlers. The parish (&quot;pitäjä&quot;) of Rautalampi was established in 1561. It was a large parish which included parts of 27 modern municipalities, most of them in the modern region of Central Finland.

Administratively Rautalampi was divided into three divisions (despite their amount, called &quot;fourths&quot;):
*Keitele, named after the lake Keitele, containing modern Viitasaari, Kivijärvi (incl. Kinnula and the Salamajärvi village in modern Perho), Kannonkoski and Pihtipudas, as well as the villages of Särkisalo (now in Konnevesi) and Horontaipale (now in Vesanto) and most of Konginkangas
*Konnevesi, named after the lake Konnevesi, containing modern Rautalampi proper, Konnevesi, Hankasalmi, Vesanto, Keitele, part of Tervo and the Tavastian side of Pielavesi,
*Saraavesi, named after the lake Saraavesi, containing modern Laukaa (incl. Äänekoski+Suolahti), Sumiainen, Uurainen, Saarijärvi (incl. Pylkönmäki), Karstula (incl. Kyyjärvi) as well as most of Jyväskylä (incl. Toivakka) and Petäjävesi.
Not too long after the establishment of the parish, most likely in 1563, the divisions were renamed: Keitele became &quot;Kymi&quot;, Konnevesi became &quot;Rautalampi&quot; and Saraavesi became &quot;Pernasalo&quot;. The Kymi fourth was later renamed to &quot;Kivijärvi&quot; in 1617. The territories of the fourths did not change until the fourths were abolished entirely in 1684.

The first ecclesiastical division of the Rautalampi parish happened when Laukaa became separate in 1628, while the last division was the separation of Konnevesi in 1919 (administratively slightly later in 1922).

== National park ==
Southern Konnevesi National Park was established in 2014. It is known for its prehistoric rock paintings.

==Culture==
===Music===
The Finnish rock band Grand Merlin, originally from Rautalampi, made a Finnish-language cover version of the 1974 Lynyrd Skynyrd single &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; in 1983. The song under the name &quot;Rautalampi&quot; was written by the band&#x27;s bassist Hannu Niskanen.

===Food===
In the 1980s, the traditional dish of Rautalampi was a &quot;cobbler&#x27;s roast&quot; (&quot;Suutarin paisti&quot;) made of browned pork and vendace.

A very remarkable sight of Reisjärvi nature is one of the northernmost in Finland habitats of wild Small-leaved Lime (Tilia cordata), 63° 38′ N (right after the northernmost reliably confirmed natural habitats in the municipality of Sonkajärvi in the vicinity of the lake of Kangaslampi, 63° 45′ N and near the hill of Salmisenmäki, 63° 43′ 42&quot; N). Seven old long-boled limes continue to grow in a mixed forest on the cape of Kokkoniemi jutting out into the lake of Pitkäjärvi. The site is in private possession but it is a grove of national significance which has been under state protection since 13.04.1989. Following the Peuranpolku (&quot;deer&#x27;s path&quot;) trailing route, which begins in Reisjärvi, provides an excellent view into the landscape of the area. The cliffs and rock fields of the Raura area have been shaped by the ice age.

==Politics==
Reisjärvi has traditionally been a strong area for the Centre Party. For example, in the first round of 2006 presidential elections, the Centre Party candidate Matti Vanhanen got 57.1% of all votes from Reisjärvi. The municipal council of Reisjärvi is also dominated by the Centre Party: in the period 2004–2008 it held 15 positions against 4 positions for National Coalition Party and 1 for Social Democrats and Left Alliance each.

==Events==
* The Finnish Porcelain Summer, held between years 1996 and 2007, was an international get-together for porcelain painters and anyone interested in the art of porcelain. The main organizer was Aira Suomela.

==History==
Riihimäki was established around the Riihimäki railway station by the Helsinki–Riihimäki railway and is one of the original stations on Finland&#x27;s first railway between Helsinki and Hämeenlinna, which opened in 1862. It became the first railway junction in Finland when the Riihimäki – Saint Petersburg track&#x27;s first section from Riihimäki to Lahti was opened in 1869. In 1907-1952 a narrow-gauge railway also operated between Riihimäki and Loppi. Today, the quickest way to travel between Riihimäki and Loppi is by car along the national road 54, which runs between Tammela and Hollola.

<doc id="784032" wikidata="Q5381551" url="?curid=784032" title="Enzyte">
<text>Enzyte is an American herbal nutritional supplement originally manufactured by Berkeley Premium Nutraceuticals. The marketing of Enzyte resulted in a conviction and prison term for the company&#x27;s owner and bankruptcy of the company. The product is now marketed by Vianda, LLC of Cincinnati, Ohio. The manufacturer has claimed that Enzyte promotes &quot;natural male enhancement,&quot; which is a euphemism for enhancing erectile function. However, its effectiveness has been called into doubt and the claims of the manufacturer have been under scrutiny from various state and federal organizations. Kenneth Goldberg, medical director of the Male Health Center at Baylor University, says, &quot;It makes no sense medically. There&#x27;s no way that increasing blood flow to the penis, as Enzyte claims to do, will actually increase its size.&quot;

In March 2005, following thousands of consumer complaints to the Better Business Bureau, federal agents raided Berkeley facilities, gathering material that resulted in a 112-count criminal indictment. The company&#x27;s founder and CEO, Steven M Warshak, and his mother, Harriet Warshak, were found guilty of conspiracy to commit mail fraud, bank fraud, and money laundering, and in September 2008 they were sentenced to prison and ordered to forfeit $500 million in assets. The convictions and fines forced the company into bankruptcy, and in December 2008 its assets were sold for $2.75 million to investment company Pristine Bay, which continued operations.

Enzyte is widely advertised on U.S. television as &quot;The once-daily tablet for natural male enhancement&quot;, or &quot;The one-a-day tablet for natural male enhancement.&quot; The commercials feature a character known as &quot;Smilin&#x27; Bob,&quot; acted out by Canadian actor Andrew Olcott, who, in the commercials, always wears a smile that is implied to result from the enhancing effects of Enzyte; these advertisements feature double entendres. Some such commercials also feature an equally smiling &quot;Mrs. Bob.&quot;

Because Enzyte is an herbal product, no testing is required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. An official of the Federal Trade Commission division that monitors advertising says the lack of scientific testing is &quot;a red flag right away. There&#x27;s no science behind these claims.&quot; The company has conceded that it has no scientific studies that substantiate any of its Enzyte claims.

Ira Sharlip, a spokesman for the American Urological Association, has said, &quot;There is no such thing as a penis pill that works. These are all things that are sold for profit. There&#x27;s no science or substance behind them.&quot;

== Ingredients ==
Enzyte&#x27;s formulation was reportedly developed for Vianda by Marilyn Barrett.

Enzyte is said to contain:
* Asian Ginseng Root Extract
* Grape Seed Extract
* &quot;Epimedium&quot; (Horny Goat Weed)
* Zinc oxide
* Muira puama
* &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot;
* Niacin
* Copper

Most of the above ingredients are commonly available as over the counter herbal or dietary supplements, and most have anecdotal reports, but marginal or unproven scientific evidence, of efficacy on various systems in the human body. Several of the herbal ingredients are included only in very low quantities.

Yohimbe was previously included in the original formulation of Enzyte, produced until at least 2004. However, as yohimbe&#x27;s legal status in Canada is unclear, Enzyte produced after 2004 no longer contains yohimbe extract.

Additionally, zinc is an ingredient in Enzyte. Some men who have low zinc levels in their body have had success using zinc supplements to treat erection problems.

== Effectiveness ==
Currently, the effectiveness of Enzyte is unproven.

A civil lawsuit alleged Enzyte does not work as advertised. Despite manufacturer claims that Enzyte will increase penis size, girth, and firmness and improve sexual performance, there exists no scientific evidence that Enzyte is capable of making good on these claims. In fact, Enzyte has never been scientifically tested by the FDA or other independent third party. Accordingly, Enzyte is required by current U.S. law to be marketed as an herbal supplement and may not legally be called a drug. In keeping with FTC rulings, Enzyte is not allowed to claim these benefits in its advertising. However, as of June 2010, TV commercials for the product still use the phrase &quot;natural male enhancement.&quot;

== Federal indictment and trial==
Thousands of consumer complaints were made to the Better Business Bureau about the company&#x27;s business practices, especially the &quot;autoship&quot; program that repeatedly charged customers&#x27; credit cards for refills even after they canceled their orders. Federal agents raided Berkeley facilities in March 2005, gathering material that led to criminal charges. On September 21, 2006, Berkeley Premium Nutraceuticals; its owner and president, Steve Warshak; and five other individuals were indicted by the United States, Southern District of Ohio, U.S. Attorney Greg Lockhart, on charges of conspiracy, money laundering, and mail, wire, and bank fraud. The indictment alleged that the company defrauded consumers and banks of US$100 million. The United States Food and Drug Administration, Internal Revenue Service, United States Postal Inspection Service, and other agencies participated in the investigation. The federal fraud trial began on January 8, 2008.

In testimony during the trial, a former executive with Berkeley testified that the enhancements the company claimed were achieved by use of Enzyte were fabricated, and the company defrauded customers by continuing to charge them for additional shipments of the supplement. He further testified that company employees were instructed to make it as difficult as possible for unhappy customers to receive refunds.

=== Conviction and sentencing ===
On February 22, 2008, Steven Warshak was found guilty of 93 counts of conspiracy, fraud, and money laundering. On August 27, 2008, he was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Arthur Spiegel to 25 years in prison and ordered to pay $93,000 in fines. Warshak was an inmate at the Federal Correctional Institution in Elkton, Ohio. His company, Berkeley Premium Nutraceuticals, along with other defendants, was ordered to forfeit $500 million. His 75-year-old mother, Harriet Warshak, was sentenced to two years in prison but released on bond pending appeal after turning over her house, bank accounts, and other assets related to her crimes.

Both Steven and Harriet Warshak appealed their convictions. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in &quot;United States v. Warshak&quot; (6th Cir. December 14, 2010) 631 F.3d 266, upheld Steven Warshak&#x27;s convictions and all convictions against Harriet Warshak except for money laundering and vacated their sentences, remanding the sentencing to the lower court.

On September 21, 2011, Steven Warshak&#x27;s sentence was reduced from 25 years to 10 years. His mother&#x27;s sentence was reduced from two years to one day, and she never served any time in jail. Factors in reducing the sentence were that the amount of total loss by customers may have been less than $400 million and that the sentences of co-defendants were only two years. Warshak was released from prison on June 14, 2017, according to the Federal Prison Inmate Locator system.

==Continued company operation==
The Warshaks&#x27; convictions and fines forced the company into bankruptcy. In December 2008, its assets were acquired from bankruptcy court for $2.75 million by investment company Pristine Bay, which is affiliated with Cincinnati developer Chuck Kubicki. Kubicki said he wanted to save the jobs of the company&#x27;s 200 employees and retain a major tenant in one of his properties in suburban Cincinnati at Forest Park, Ohio. He said he would change the company name but would keep the brand. In March 2009, Hamilton County commissioners unanimously voted to give a $195,000 property tax break to the company based on projected jobs.

On June 26, 2009, the company name was changed to Vianda LLC. In a press release, the company announced plans to expand, hiring as many as 400 additional workers. On December 14, 2009, Cincinnati Business Courier reported employment of 180, revision of sales projections of 400% growth to $120 million downward to an estimated 33% growth to $40 million, management team changes, and continued customer complaints of improper billing.

Company is currently under the leadership of Cheryl Jaeger starting on January 6, 2015 and the company is now located at 11260 Cornell Park Drive, Suite 706 Cincinnati, Ohio 45242 Company is also connected to the following companies DYNAMIC DIRECT, LLC, ENHANCED LIVING PRODUCTS, LLC, MOVNNON, LLC, PRISTINE BAY, LLC, and LAST SAY, LLC.

<text>Herff–Brooks Corporation was a brass era automobile manufacturer based in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1914 to 1916.

== History ==
Herff-Brooks formed in 1913 to take on the sales of the Marathon Motor Works of Nashville, Tennessee. By 1915 Herff-Brooks purchased the now defunct Marathon machinery, and along with some personnel set up a new factory at the Wayne Works in Richmond, Indiana.

Herff-Brooks were identical to the 1914 Marathons with minor improvements. A 40 hp four-cylinder car, at $1,100, and a 50 hp six-cylinder car, at $1,375 were offered. For 1915 a 25 hp car, selling at $765, was added.

H. H. Brooks, former Sales Manager for Marathon was General Manager. He joined Marmon as a Sales Manager in 1917 when Herff-Brooks automobile production stopped. The Wayne Works were turned over for War production.

<doc id="784036" wikidata="Q1641615" url="?curid=784036" title="Ristiina">
<text>Ristiina (; in Swedish also known as &quot;Kristina&quot;) was a municipality of Finland. It was founded in 1649 and it was named after Kristina Stenbock, the wife of Governor General and Count Per Brahe. From the beginning of the year 2013 Ristiina is a part of Mikkeli city.

Ristiina is located in the province of Eastern Finland and is part of the Southern Savonia region. The municipality has a population of (31 December 2012) and covers an area of of which 
is water. The population density is .

The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

== History ==
The area of the later Ristiina municipality was originally a part of the Savilahti parish (the later Mikkelin maalaiskunta), the oldest parish in all of Savonia. By 1541, Savilahti had been divided into the administrative divisions of Pellosniemi and Visulahti. The Pellosniemi division, which included modern Ristiina, had its center in the village of Olkkolanniemi. A farm named &quot;Pellosniemi&quot; still exists in the village. The Ristiina parish was established in 1649. It was also known as &quot;Brahelinna&quot; after Per Brahe&#x27;s manor in the area. &quot;Ristiina&quot; became the sole official name in 1901. The industrial area of Pellosniemi (not to be confused with old Pellosniemi in Olkkolanniemi) was formed in the 1960s in the southern part of the Rahikkala village. The name is derived from the Pellos factories (&quot;Pelloksen tehtaat&quot;).

Ristiina was consolidated with the town of Mikkeli in 2013.

<text>Machir or Makir ( &quot;Māḵîr&quot;, &quot;bartered&quot;) was the name of two figures in the Hebrew Bible:

*Machir was the son of Manasseh, grandson of Joseph, and father of Gilead. Joseph lived to see and to play a part in the up-bringing of Machir and his children. In the Torah&#x27;s account of the journey of the Israelites after the Exodus, Machir (the individual) is portrayed as conquering the territories known as Gilead and Bashan, which had previously been occupied by Amorites. Half of the tribe of Manasseh, those descended from Machir, are described as having settled in Gilead and Bashan, and consequently they were important in Gilead&#x27;s history.
*According to the Books of Samuel, Machir son of Ammiel was the name of a descendant of the Machir mentioned above, who resided at Lo-Debar. The text states that here he looked after Meribaal, the son of Jonathan, until David took over his care, and also looked after David himself, when David found himself a fugitive.

<text>BKS Stal Bielsko-Biała is a Polish sports club, with two departments: the men&#x27;s football team and the women&#x27;s volleyball team. The club is based in Bielsko-Biała. The football team currently plays in the second group of V liga Silesia, the sixth level of competition.

==History==
BKS Stal Bielsko-Biala (full name: &quot;Biala Sports Club Stal Bielsko-Biala&quot;) was founded in 1922 in Biała Krakowska, the town which in 1951 merged with Bielsko, to form Bielsko-Biala. The formation of BKS was connected with the rebirth of the Second Polish Republic: both Biala (located in former Austrian Galicia), and neighbouring Bielsko (which had belonged to the Duchy of Teschen) were the towns with large German communities. Local Poles wanted to create their own sports organization, as a counterbalance to the already existing German ones. BKS was based on the &quot;Sports Association Szczerbiec&quot;, formed in 1913. The hues of BKS were based on the colours of the city of Biala: red and green; in 1949 yellow was added. The club was under the patronage of several industries, most notably under the Bielsko Sewing Machine factory Befama &quot;(Bielska Fabryka Maszyn Włókienniczych &quot;Befama&quot;)&quot;, under which the club expanded rapidly and later the FSM factory, which still exists today under a Fiat ownership.

==Football==
From the very beginning, the officials of BKS were determined to form a football team. Apart from footballers, BKS had the departments of table tennis and gymnastics. In 1927, a stadium was built in Biala. To commemorate this occasion, an international football tournament took place, with teams from Czechoslovakia and Weimar Germany. In interwar Poland, the football team of BKS Bielsko played in local A Class, which was roughly the equivalent of the third level of Polish football system. BKS failed to win promotion to the top level of local football, the so-called &quot;Silesian League&quot;, or &quot;Silesian A-Class&quot; (see Lower Level Football Leagues in Interwar Poland).

In May 1945, following World War II, during which ethnic Poles were forbidden to officially play football games, BKS was recreated. In the early 1950s, BKS Stal, as it was called since 1949, gained a wealthy sponsor: the &quot;Textile Machine Factory Befama&quot;. Apart from Befama, other local factories also supported the club. In 1957, the stadium of BKS was renovated, and to mark the event, Stal tied 4–4 in a friendly game with Cracovia.

Until 1973, BKS Stal remained in the regional leagues, either 4th or 3rd level. In 1973, its football team won promotion to the Second Division. With a new, extremely wealthy sponsor (Fabryka Samochodow Malolitrazowych), Stal had a new manager, Antoni Piechniczek, who worked there in 1973–1975. In its first season, Stal was close to the promotion to the Ekstraklasa, finishing the year in the second spot, only behind GKS Tychy. In 1974, very talented goalkeeper Józef Młynarczyk joined BKS, to remain there until 1977. Stal remained in the Second Division for 5 years, to be relegated in mid-1978.

In 1981 Stal returned to the Second Division, and after one year, it was again close to the promotion to the Ekstraklasa, finishing the 1981/82 season as the second team, behind GKS Katowice. In 1982/1983, Stal was relegated. In 1980, Stal&#x27;s U-19 team was Polish runner up, losing 0–2 to Polonia Bydgoszcz in the final game of the U-19 championship.

After the relegation of 1983, Stal so far has not returned to the Second Division. It was close in 1984, 1985 and 1987. In 1989, Stal was relegated to the fourth level, to return to the third level after one year. In the 1990s, Stal played either in the 3rd or 4th level, and in 2003, the team found itself in the 5th level. In the late 2000s Stal returned to the third level.

==Other sections==
At the height of the clubs expansion, after the 1960s and 1950s, the club had 22 different sports departments. Only two remain to this day, and the declining economy and lack of money during the Polish Second Republic, as with many other Polish clubs at the time, meant that over the years the departments were shut down one by one. However, the weightlifting and hockey sections have produced several international athletes, such as weightlifting world record holder Antoni Pietruszek, and hockey national team player Wiktor Olszowski.

==Supporters and rivalries==
BKS fans usually focus on football team due to the culture around the sport, however, they do sometimes support the women&#x27;s volleyball team too for important games. The fans are usually nicknamed &quot;South Boys&quot;, and frequently highlight the fact they are the most southward major club in Poland. They have friendships with fans of Zagłębie Sosnowiec, Slavia Praha and Olimpia Elbląg, in the past they used to have a friendship with fans of Legia Warsaw. Their biggest rivals are fellow locals Podbeskidzie Bielsko-Biała with whom they contest the Bielsko-Biała Derby, however, they also have rivalries with most Upper Silesian teams.

The club was founded in May 1993 under the name , taking over the volleyball activities of B1 league side WKS Sokół. In its first season (1993–94) the club gained promotion to the A1 league, but without necessary support the club had financial issues and was relegated at the end of its first A1 league season. Supported by new sponsors, the club achieved league A1 promotion in 1997 with success following shortly after with 4 consecutive Polish Championships (1998–99, 1999–00, 2000–01, 2001–02) and 3 Polish Cup titles (1999–00, 2001–02, 2002–03) during a six-year period (from 1997 to 2003). Sponsorship issues in the following years affected the club&#x27;s performances (it won the Polish Cup in 2007–08 and the Polish Super Cup in 2008) culminating in an agreement with Atom Trefl Sopot for the club&#x27;s withdraw from the league in May 2010. In the agreement, made in order for PTPS to restructure, Atom Trefl and PTPS switched places (Atom took PTPS place in the highest league with PTPS replacing Atom in the second division). After its first season at the second division, the club gained promotion back to the highest league.

<doc id="784083" wikidata="Q343657" url="?curid=784083" title="Action Directe">
<text>Action Directe (; AD; ) was a French far-left terrorist organization that originated from the anti-Franco struggle and the autonomous movement, and was responsible for deadly attacks in France between 1979 and 1987. The French government banned the group. During its existence, AD&#x27;s members murdered 12 people, and wounded a further 26. It associated at various times with the Red Brigades (Italy), Red Army Faction (West Germany), Prima Linea (Italy), Armed Nuclei for Popular Autonomy (France), Communist Combatant Cells, Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Factions, Irish National Liberation Army, and others.

== Elisabeth Van Dyck Command ==

The Elisabeth Van Dyck Command was a branch of AD that assassinated French Army General René Audran, on 25 January 1985. He was the Director of International Affairs (DAI) at the General Directorate for Armament (DGA). The team was named to commemorate Red Army Faction (RAF) member Elisabeth Van Dyck.

The command was created as a combined extension of both the AD and RAF. The AD appeared to take care of the organizational side of the command, and so naming it after a memorialized member of the RAF makes sense if they were seeking to at least publicly have a unified front. Both the RAF and the AD were actively pursuing their shared goal of political autonomy within their home countries, with the RAF based in Germany and the AD in France. These groups&#x27; goal of political autonomy did not stop with their own countries however, and they often fought against their own countries&#x27; governments in the pursuit of what they claimed was &#x27;political autonomy&#x27;, or political freedom, for the world&#x27;s working class.

The command had only one claimed attack, the assassination of French Army General René Audran on January 25, 1985. At the time of his death, Audran was a senior-level official in the French Ministry of Defense, specifically the Corps of Armament. The Elisabeth van Dyck Command took credit for the assassination via letter. In the letter the members explained that they had killed Audran because he was the head of French&#x27;s foreign arms sales and they believed that his &quot;military and economic function is at the heart of the strategic imperialist project&quot;. The project being referred to is what the AD and RAF believed to be NATO and its supporting European countries&#x27; goal of homogenizing the world into a capitalist culture, and that as they progressed along this goal it would widen the gap in power and wealth between the upper class and working class.

==Arrests==

In December 1981, AD member Lahouari Benchellal, known as Farid, was arrested for forging traveler&#x27;s cheques, which were an important income source for the organization, in Helsinki, Finland. He hanged himself while in the custody of the Finnish Security Intelligence Service in January 1982. AD did not believe Benchellal killed himself, and they named a direct action group after him.

There is an ongoing campaign by some sections of the French far-left calling for the parole of the still imprisoned AD members, who consider themselves political prisoners. In December 2007, Jean-Marc Rouillan was allowed a state of &quot;semi-liberty&quot;, able to leave prison for extended periods. In September 2008, a Parisian court called for the revocation of his status after he declared in an interview with &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot; that &quot;I remain convinced that armed struggle is necessary at certain moments of the revolutionary process&quot;.

That commercialization brought sponsors (the club has been renamed few times through the years) and investors. The club first played in the highest Polish Women&#x27;s Volleyball League in 1999 and has also participated in European competitions (Top Teams Cup and Challenge Cup).

===2010–2011 season===

<text>Joëlle Aubron (26 June 1959 – 1 March 2006) was a militant in the French group Action directe.

==Action directe involvement and arrests==
Arrested on 9 April 1982, she was sentenced to 4 years in prison for concealment and possession of arms. In 1983, she married Régis Schleicher, another member of Action directe, whom she later divorced. Granted a remission of sentence following her marriage, she was released on 24 January 1984. She began running an anarchist bookshop, then went underground in 1985, when she joined the arm of Action directe that allied itself with the Red Army Faction. She participated in several attacks organized by Action directe, including the assassinations of General René Audran on 25 January 1985 and Georges Besse on 19 November 1986. Joëlle Aubron, along with Nathalie Ménigon, is considered to be directly responsible for these two assassinations, though their respective roles have not been determined.

Arrested with her comrades Jean-Marc Rouillan, Nathalie Ménigon and Georges Cipriani on 21 February 1987 on a farm in Vitry-aux-Loges (Loiret), she was sentenced in 1989 and 1994 to life in prison, with a minimum of 18 years. She was imprisoned at the Fleury-Mérogis Prison in Essonne until October 1999, when she was transferred with Nathalie Ménigon to the prison of Bapaume in Pas-de-Calais.

==Release==
After undergoing operations for a brain tumour, she was released on 16 June 2004 and her sentence suspended by the law of 4 March 2002 concerning the rights of patients.

==Documentary==
In 2005, she appeared in the documentary &quot;Ni vieux, ni traîtres&quot;, directed by Pierre Carles and Georges Minangoy.

==Death==

Joëlle Aubron died on 1 March 2006, at the age of 46, from a cancer that had metastasized towards her brain.

<text>Conchita Martínez Bernat (born 16 April 1972) is a Spanish former professional tennis player and coach. She was the first Spaniard to win the women&#x27;s singles title at Wimbledon, doing so in 1994. Martínez also was the runner-up at the 1998 Australian Open and the 2000 French Open. She reached a career-high ranking of world No. 2 in October 1995, and was in the year-end top 10 for nine years. Martínez won 33 singles and 13 doubles titles during her 18-year career, as well as three Olympic medals. She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2020.

A five-time winner of the Fed Cup as a player, Martínez was the Spanish team captain from 2013 to 2017 and the Spanish Davis Cup team captain from 2015 to 2017, leading the Davis Cup team back into the top-tier World Group under her captaincy. She has also served as a part-time coach to Garbiñe Muguruza, guiding her to the 2017 Wimbledon Championships title, and was the full-time coach to Karolína Plíšková through 2018 and 2019. She began coaching Muguruza on a full-time basis in November 2019. Martínez won the 2021 WTA Coach of the Year award for her work coaching Muguruza. She is currently a coach to Mirra Andreeva.

She was inducted alongside Goran Ivanišević into the Tennis Hall of Fame class of 2020.

==Career==
===1988–1992: Breakthrough, top 10, Grand Slam quarterfinals===
Born in Monzón, Martínez turned professional in 1988. At the age of just 16, she reached the fourth round at the French Open in her third professional tournament. She upset ninth-seed Lori McNeil en route, before losing to Bettina Fulco in two sets. In 1989, her breakthrough year, Martínez got rid of Sabatini to win the title at Tampa and also won two Tier V tournaments (Wellington, Phoenix). She also reached the quarterfinals of the French Open, losing to Steffi Graf. She finished the year world No. 7. In 1990 and 1991, Martínez won a further six titles and again reached the quarterfinals at the French Open both years (losing to Graf in 1990 and Monica Seles in 1991).

The following year, Martínez was a silver medalist in doubles at the Olympic Games in Barcelona (partnering Arantxa Sánchez Vicario) and the runner-up in women&#x27;s doubles at the French Open. Once again, Martínez was a quarterfinalist at the French Open, losing a tight match with Sabatini. In 1992 she was runner up in Indian Wells and San Diego.

===1993–1996: Highest ranking, Wimbledon singles title===
In 1993, Martínez became the first Spanish woman since Lilí de Álvarez in 1928 to reach the semifinals at Wimbledon, where she lost to Steffi Graf in two sets. In November, Martínez defeated Graf for the first and only time in her career, at a tournament in Philadelphia in the final. At the Italian Open, Martínez defeated Sabatini in the final in straight sets to become the first Spaniard to win the tournament since de Álvarez in 1930. She again reached the quarterfinals at the French Open for the fifth year in a row, losing a 2-hour, 45-minute three-set battle with Anke Huber.

Martínez reached the Wimbledon singles final in 1994 beating Rene Simpson, Nana Smith, Nathalie Tauziat, Kristine Kunce and Lindsay Davenport in the quarterfinal and Lori McNeil in the semifinals where the third set went to 10–8, where she faced nine-time Wimbledon champion Martina Navratilova. Navratilova&#x27;s last Wimbledon triumph had come four years earlier, but many observers felt that the 37-year-old Czech-born American was the favourite going into the match given her long track record of success on grass courts, whereas Martínez&#x27;s most significant tournament victories up to that time had been on slower-playing surfaces, particularly on clay courts. Martínez, however, won the match in three sets and became the first Spanish woman to win Wimbledon. In 1995, Martínez was a semifinalist at all four Grand Slam tournaments and reached her career-high singles ranking of World No. 2. In the Australian Open she beat Lindsay Davenport in the quarterfinals before losing to Mary Pierce in the semifinals. At Wimbledon, Martínez beat Sabatini in the quarterfinals before losing to Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in the semifinals. She also had a new coach that year, Carlos Kirmayr.

In 1996, Martínez became the only player to win the Italian Open singles title four consecutive years, after a straight-sets victory in the final against 15-year-old Martina Hingis. She also partnered Sánchez Vicario to claim a women&#x27;s doubles Olympic bronze medal in Atlanta.

===1997–2006: Out of top 10 and return, Australian and French Open runner-up===
In 1998, Martínez reached her second career Grand Slam singles final at the Australian Open. She beat Lindsay Davenport in the semifinals, before losing to Martina Hingis in the final in straight sets. At the German Open in May, she defeated Amélie Mauresmo to win her first singles title in 18 months. She also helped Spain win the Fed Cup that year, beating Patty Schnyder of Switzerland 6–3, 2–6, 9–7 in 3 hours, 19 minutes in the final.

In January 2000 at the Australian Open Martínez beat Elena Likhovtseva in the quarterfinals after Likhovtseva twice failed to serve for the match to reach the semifinals where she was beaten by Martina Hingis. Martínez reached the final of the French Open in 2000, where she lost to Mary Pierce in two sets after beating Sánchez Vicario in the semifinals. She also won the German Open, beating Hingis in a semifinal and Amanda Coetzer in the final. In 2001, Martínez was a runner-up in the women&#x27;s doubles at the French Open (partnering Jelena Dokic). Martínez also reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon for the first time in six years but lost to Justine Henin of Belgium. In 2003, she reached her last Grand Slam quarterfinal in the French Open losing to Kim Clijsters. Also that year, she reached the final at Eastbourne losing to Chanda Rubin.

Martínez won her second Olympic silver medal in the women&#x27;s doubles in 2004 in Athens, Greece (partnering Virginia Ruano Pascual). In 2005, Martínez won her first singles title in five years at Pattaya, Thailand. It was her last singles title, bringing her career total to 33 top-level singles titles, nine of which were Tier I events, and 13 doubles titles. On 15 April 2006, aged 33 and after 18 years of playing professionally, she announced her retirement. She is still the spanish female player with more singles titles so far.

===2008–2010===
In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Martínez played at Wimbledon in the Ladies Invitations Doubles. In 2010, her partner in doubles was Nathalie Tauziat.

==Playing style==
Nicknamed Senorita Topspin, Martínez was a patient, right-handed baseline player who won matches by disrupting her opponents&#x27; rhythm through changes of spin, pace, depth, height, and angle. She had a strong backhand, played single-handedly, and used heavy topspin on her forehand and slower topspin and slice on her backhand. A characteristic shot of Martínez was to hit a deep, looping forehand with a lot of topspin with the intent to drive her opponent to the back of the court and make her hit the ball at shoulder height.
She often sought out the ball with which she had won the previous point. This sometimes irritated her opponents; Patty Schnyder once pocketed the ball to prevent Martínez from retrieving it, and rejected the traditional handshake at the end of the match.

<text>Furness ( ) is a peninsula and region of Cumbria, England. Together with the Cartmel Peninsula it forms North Lonsdale, historically an exclave of Lancashire. On 1 April 2023 it became part of the new unitary authority of Westmorland and Furness.

The Furness Peninsula, also known as Low Furness, is an area of villages, agricultural land and low-lying moorland, with the industrial town of Barrow-in-Furness at its head. The peninsula is bordered by the estuaries of the River Duddon to the west and the River Leven in Morecambe Bay to the east. The wider region of Furness consists of the peninsula and the area known as &quot;High Furness&quot;, which is a relatively mountainous and sparsely populated part of England, extending inland into the Lake District and containing the Furness Fells. The inland boundary of the region is formed by the rivers Leven, Brathay and Duddon, and the lake of Windermere. Off the southern tip of Furness is Walney Island, long, as well as several smaller islands.

The Borough of Barrow-in-Furness, which developed when the Furness iron industry flourished in the 19th century, is the region&#x27;s largest settlement, with a population of over 91,000. The remainder of Furness is predominantly rural, with Ulverston the only other settlement with more than 10,000 people. Much of High Furness consists of moorland, mountain or woodland environments.

==Etymology==
The name, which is first recorded in 1150 as &quot;Fuththernessa&quot;, is interpreted as &quot;headland by the rump-shaped island,&quot; from Old Norse &quot;futh&quot; (genitive &quot;futhar&quot;), meaning rump, and &quot;nes&quot;, meaning headland. The island in question may be Piel Island, with the name originally referring to the headland immediately opposite (where Rampside is), before being extended to the entire region. Alternatively it could be Walney Island: though it little resembles a rump today, erosion could have altered its shape over time.

==Geography==
Furness&#x27;s border follows the River Duddon up to Wrynose Pass, and then the Brathay until it flows into Windermere. The mere forms most of the eastern boundary, with the rest being made up of the Leven, from its source at Windermere&#x27;s southern tip to its mouth at Morecambe Bay. In total Furness has an area of about .

The Furness Fells are formed of Ordovician volcanic rocks, and Silurian shales and slates to the south. They are cut through by Windermere, Coniston Water, and numerous valleys which drain into the Esk, the Duddon, and Morecambe Bay. The higher ground is rocky heathland, with frequent tarns, while the lower ground supports pasture and woodland. In the east there are two main chains of hills: one overlooking Windermere, with Latterbarrow (245 m) as its highest point, and the other, which reaches 300 m, overlooking Coniston Water. Between them is flat country and Esthwaite Water. West of Coniston Water is the highest range, the Coniston Fells, with the Coniston Old Man (803 m) as its highest point (and historically the highest point in Lancashire). A lesser range extends from Torver to just north of Dalton, but south of that the landscape is flat; this area is also called Plain Furness. The low rolling hills of Low Furness are formed of glacial deposits, mainly boulder clay, above Triassic sandstone and Carboniferous limestone. There are large deposits of iron ore here, of very pure quality.

The human geography of the area is dominated by the town of Barrow-in-Furness. Barrow is located on the tip of the peninsula and Walney Island, and the Borough of Barrow-in-Furness, which includes the small town of Dalton-in-Furness and the town of Millom (the latter of which, although statistically in &quot;Furness&quot; for this purpose, is not actually part of the defined geographic area known as Furness) has a population of 69,100. Barrow, which grew from a small village to a large town during the 19th century, is characterized by a grid pattern of streets of terraced houses, surrounded by more contemporary suburbs. Though the Port of Barrow still contains much industry, there has also been significant redevelopment of former dock areas into retail parks, office blocks and spaces of light industry. The other major town in the area is Ulverston, at the border of Low and High Furness, and the population of Ulverston and its surrounding villages is 17,307. The corridor along the main A590 road between Ulverston and Barrow is relatively densely populated and urban. Despite decline, industry remains a bigger employer in this part of Furness than most of the UK, with BAE Systems, Kimberly-Clark (both Barrow) and GlaxoSmithKline (Ulverston) the largest employers. In Barrow and up the west coast of Furness, the Sellafield Nuclear site is also a significant employer. The rest of Furness is rural, with the mountainous, wooded and lacustrine environments. To the west, the main settlements of Kirkby-in-Furness and Broughton-in-Furness are dominated by farming and commuting. The Lake District National Park covers most of High Furness, with Coniston and Hawkshead the main centres for tourism, while major tourist attractions include Grizedale Forest, the Aquarium of the Lakes, South Lakes Safari Zoo and the Lakeside and Haverthwaite Railway. The northern and eastern communities of Furness share more in common with the Lake District towns of Ambleside and Bowness, outside of the region, than with the more urban areas of Low Furness. Mining was once a major part of the local economy, but today only the Burlington Slate Quarries at Kirkby remain of note.

The A590 is the main road into the region from the M6 Motorway. The A595 is the main route up the western coast of Furness, and the A593/A5084 run north-south from Low Furness to High Furness. The Furness Line provides railway connections to the West Coast Mainline through the south of Furness, and the Cumbria Coast Line is a slow rural branch line with services running north to Copeland and Carlisle. The Windermere Ferry in the east of Furness is England&#x27;s only vehicular lake ferry.

==History==
Furness seems to have been scantly populated in ancient times. A handful of Brittonic placenames survive around Barrow, suggesting this part was settled earliest. Anglo-Saxons arrived in Low Furness in the 7th century, but do not seem to have spread to High Furness, which remained almost empty until it was populated by incoming Scandinavians in the 10th century. It has been suggested that they had a small mountain kingdom there, centred on Coniston (which means &quot;king&#x27;s town&quot;). The prevalence of names with the element &quot;thwaite&quot; in High Furness (from Norse &quot;thveit&quot;, &quot;clearing&quot;), and the absence thereof in Low Furness, suggests that the latter had already been deforested by the time the Scandinavians arrived. Scandinavians probably formed the majority of the Furness population, and Old Norse remained a living language in the region until at least the late 12th century.

Before the Conquest, Furness, assessed to contain 82 ploughlands, was part of the Manor of Hougun, held by Tostig, Earl of Northumbria. By 1086, Furness was in the possession of the crown. In 1127 Prince Stephen founded Furness Abbey, granting the abbot most of the land in Furness and giving the rest to a Fleming named Michael. Henry III later granted the rent due from the lord of Michael&#x27;s Land (£10 per year) to the abbot of Furness, making him the sole tenant-in-chief, and thus one of the most powerful abbots in the country.

In the 14th century Dalton Castle and Piel Castle were built by the abbots of Furness to defend the market town of Dalton and the port of Barrow respectively. The area had been raided by Scots in 1316 and again in 1322, though in the latter year the abbot paid Robert the Bruce a ransom to stop his men harrying Low Furness.

The pretender Lambert Simnel landed with his army at Piel Island in 1487. A few locals joined him, including Sir Thomas Broughton of Broughton Tower, who would be killed at the disastrous Battle of Stoke Field.

The abbey was closed in 1536 after the monks lent their support to the Pilgrimage of Grace, and the abbot&#x27;s lands were seized by the crown, becoming part of the royal duchy of Lancaster. Later they were granted to the dukes of Buccleuch and Devonshire.

In May 1643, Furness was occupied and plundered by a large Royalist force commanded by Richard Viscount Molyneux. Later that year they prepared to march to the relief of Thurland Castle in South Lonsdale, then besieged by Colonel Rigby, but Rigby took some of his men over the sands and met the Royalists at Lindal, where they were routed. The Parliamentarians looted the Dalton neighbourhood before retreating to Cartmel the same night. In 1644 the Royalists remained in control of Furness, though the country folk were hostile to them, and Parliament ships landed at Piel Island to aid in a rising. After a fight at Hawcoat the resistance was quashed, and the Parliament ships left for Liverpool. After collecting the king&#x27;s rents, the Royalists left for Cartmel. After the Restoration of the monarchy, one Furness landowner, Colonel Sawry, attempted a rising.
Iron had been mined in Furness since prehistory, and by the late 18th century ore was being exported from Barrow. The Furness Railway was built in the 19th century to cater to the increasing demand. Iron and steelworks were established at Barrow, and the town&#x27;s population grew from 325 in 1847 to 51,712 in 1891, surpassing Dalton&#x27;s and Ulverston&#x27;s. Mining in Furness reached its peak in 1882, when 1,408,693 tons of ore were won. At the same time, tourism in the Lake District increased, popularised in part by the work of John Ruskin and William Wordsworth.

Tourism in High Furness was promoted by the writings of Beatrix Potter in the early 20th century. Potter was one of the largest landowners in the area, eventually donating her many properties to the National Trust.

Shipbuilding later replaced iron and steel as Low Furness&#x27;s main industry, and Barrow&#x27;s shipyards became the largest in England. In particular, submarine development became a specialty of the town, with the Royal Navy&#x27;s first submarines built there. During the wars this allowed Furness to escape many of the economic problems that other areas suffered, due to the constant work provided by the military.

After World War II demand for ships and submarines remained high, while the development of the Lake District National Park further fostered tourism. Attractions such as the Lakeside and Haverthwaite Railway, steamers on Windermere and Coniston Water, and fell walking, caused parts of Furness to become dependent on the tourist trade.

In the early 1990s, the decline of shipbuilding led to mass redundancies in the area. The shipyard&#x27;s employment figures fell from 20,000 to 3,000 in a 20-year period. However, the shipyard at Barrow remains England&#x27;s busiest and the only nuclear submarine facility in the country. Tourism has increased even more, with the Aquarium of the Lakes and South Lakes Safari Zoo among the newer attractions.

Transport has become an increasingly controversial issue, with conservation groups and local business clashing over the need for improvements to the A590 trunk road, the main link to the M6 Motorway. Proposals for a road bridge over Morecambe Bay have appeared, but are yet to progress beyond the planning stages.

==Administration==
Furness formed the greater part of the North Lonsdale exclave of the historic county of Lancashire, which bordered Cumberland to the northwest and Westmorland to the northeast (the point where the three counties met is marked by the Three Shire Stone at the head of the Duddon). North Lonsdale is also called &quot;Lancashire North of the Sands&quot;.

In 1974, North Lonsdale – along with Cumberland, Westmorland, and part of the West Riding of Yorkshire (around Sedbergh) – became part of the new administrative county of Cumbria. At the district level, it consisted of the borough of Barrow and part of South Lakeland.

In April 2023, Furness became part of the new unitary council area of Westmorland and Furness, which replaced Cumbria County Council and the districts of Barrow and South Lakeland, all of which were abolished. 

Low Furness and the western part of High Furness are in the Barrow and Furness parliamentary constituency, while eastern High Furness is in Westmorland and Lonsdale.

The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

The name &quot;Salo&quot; means woodland, backwoods, but also a wooded island in Finnish. It is believed that Salo originally referred to an island located south of the current town over a thousand years ago, which is now a hill due to post-glacial rebound, and not even close to the sea today.

Salo is a small city located between the capital Helsinki ( away) and the provincial capital Turku ( away). The city&#x27;s proximity to these larger cities has contributed to the growth of Salo&#x27;s business sector. Additionally, farming plays a significant role in the area. Salo shares borders with Koski Tl, Lohja, Kimitoön, Marttila, Paimio, Raseborg, Sauvo and Somero. Salo is also twinned with Saint Anthony Village in Minnesota.

Salo was previously recognised for its significant consumer electronics and mobile phone industry. Nokia, and briefly Microsoft Mobile, operated a manufacturing plant in the town. However, the plant was closed in 2015, resulting in high unemployment rates.

Salo is the birthplace of the former president of Finland Sauli Niinistö.

==History==
Salo has existed as a centre of rural commerce since at least the 16th century, emerging in the location where the Great Coastal Road, the important East-West road, crossed River Salo; the river provided the fairway to the sea. In 1887 Salo officially became a market town and, in the beginning of 1891, an independent Municipality. The area of the municipality was initially very small, only 0.65 km2. In 1932 it grew to 18 km2 when areas from neighbouring Uskela and Halikko were annexed to Salo. Eventually Salo became a town in 1960. The municipality of Uskela was consolidated with Salo 1967. The municipalities of Halikko, Kiikala, Kisko, Kuusjoki, Muurla, Perniö, Pertteli, Suomusjärvi and Särkisalo were consolidated with Salo in the beginning of 2009.
Salo is also a popular last name in Finland.

Salo was well known in Finland and around the world for its large mobile phone factory operated by Nokia. Nokia first started producing mobile phones in Salo in 1981. A new plant, 15,000 square metres, opened in June 1995. By this time 1,200 people were employed there, and it exported products to 70 countries as of 1995. As of 2008, 5,000 people were employed at the plant.

In 2012 amid heavy financial losses, Nokia laid off a third of Salo&#x27;s 3,500 workforce and gradually shifted manufacturing to Asia. It had a negative impact on the town with unemployment rising. In 2010 Nokia accounted for 95% of the town&#x27;s corporate tax income, amounting to €60 million, but this dropped to just €14 million by 2012. By the end of the year Salo no longer produced hardware and became a research and development centre.

By this time Salo&#x27;s unemployment rate was 15%, and the layoffs could push that further to 20%. Solidarity was expressed by some Finnish politicians after Salo&#x27;s decline, which also came amid Finland&#x27;s slow post-2008 crisis economy.

<text>Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora (; 18 November 18045 January 1878) was an Italian general and statesman. His older brothers include soldier and naturalist Alberto della Marmora and Alessandro Ferrero La Marmora, founder of the branch of the Italian army now called the Bersaglieri.

==Biography==
Born in Turin, he entered the Sardinian army in 1823, and was a captain in March 1848, when he gained distinction and the rank of major at the . On 5 August 1848 he liberated Charles Albert of Sardinia from a revolutionary mob in Milan, and in October was promoted general and appointed Minister of War. After suppressing the revolt of Genoa in 1849, he again assumed in November 1849 the portfolio of war, which, save during the period of his command of the Crimean expedition (where he commanded at the siege of Sevastopol and the battle of the Chernaya), he retained until 1859.

He took part in the war of 1859 against Austria; and in July of that year succeeded Cavour in the premiership. In 1860 he was sent to Berlin and Saint Petersburg to arrange for the recognition of the kingdom of Italy and subsequently he held the offices of governor of Milan and royal lieutenant at Naples, until, in September 1864, he succeeded Marco Minghetti as premier. In this capacity, he modified the scope of the September Convention by a note in which he claimed for Italy full freedom of action in respect of national aspirations to the possession of Rome, a document of which Visconti-Venosta afterwards took advantage when justifying the Italian occupation of Rome in 1870.

In April 1866 La Marmora concluded a military alliance with Prussia against Austria-Hungary, and, on the outbreak of the Third Italian War of Independence in June, took command of an army corps. He is largely credited of the hesitant conduct of the first phases of the Italian invasion, which, despite the large Italian superiority, led to the defeat in the battle of Custoza on 23 June. Accused of treason by his fellow countrymen, in particular by other high-rank generals, and of duplicity by the Prussians, he eventually published in defence of his tactics (1873) a series of documents entitled &quot;Un po&#x27; più di luce sugli eventi dell&#x27;anno 1866&quot; (&quot;More light on the events of 1866&quot;), a step which caused irritation in Germany, and exposed him to the charge of having violated state secrets.

Meanwhile, he was sent to Paris in 1867 to oppose the French expedition to Rome, and in 1870, after the occupation of Rome by the Italians, was appointed lieutenant-royal of the new capital. He died in Florence on 5 January 1878. La Marmora&#x27;s writings include &quot;Un episodio di risorgimento italiano&quot; (1875) and &quot;Il segreto di stato nel governo costituzionale&quot; (1877).

<text>Saltvik is a municipality of Åland, an autonomous territory of Finland. The total area is 1 161,8 km2, of which 150,7 km2 is land, 4,7 km2 lakes and 1006,4 km2 sea.

The archipelago north of Saltvik is perhaps the most beautiful one in Åland. Closest to land are the big islands Boxö, Sommarö, Flatö and Ryssö. Beyond, the horizon opens up and after passing Saggö it is more or less unbroken.

== History ==
The municipality has a rich history. When Åland emerged from the sea about 8,000 BC, Saltvik was the first land to be seen. During the Viking ages, Kvarnbo used to be a central crown court- and place of merchandise. Today, people can visit the medieval church and at the court place see the memorial monument.

The church St:a Maria is located by Kvarnboviken in the east of Saltvik. The red granite church is one of the oldest in Åland, and was once the main church in the province. The church has been rebuilt and extended several times. The oldest parts are from the late 13th century, but various reconstructions have been made from the 14th century until today. For example, the chalk drawings on the walls have first been painted, then covered and then uncovered again. Around and under the church, there are traces of houses from Viking Age. This is not so strange, considering the church is located in the middle of the biggest grave field from Iron Age in Åland.

A former Finnish government lands official claims a 17,800-square-meter (0.004 acre) plot on the island of Saltvik &quot;had been handed over to Russia&#x27;s Foreign Ministry in 2009, in accordance with a 1947 post-war peace treaty that saw German holdings in Finland transferred to the Soviet Union&quot;.

== Business ==
About 50% of the people living in Saltvik work in the service industry or in the public sector. 15% work in transport and 14% in industry. Construction and farming/fishing employ, respectively, 10% and 7%.

The head office and one factory of the Chips Group is located in the municipality. The company begun its operations in Saltvik in 1969 and was the first potato chip producer in Finland. Through acquisitions, new establishments and growth, the group has grown and is today the market leader within snacks in the Nordic and Baltic countries. The best-known brands are Taffel, OLW, KiMs and Oolannin. In 2005, the Norwegian industrial group Orkla ASA acquired all the shares in the Chips Group.
