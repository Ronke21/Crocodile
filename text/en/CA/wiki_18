<text>Kinvara or Kinvarra () is a sea port village in the southwest of County Galway, Ireland. It is located in the civil parish of Kinvarradoorus in the north of the barony of Kiltartan. Kinvarra is also an electoral division.

==Geography==
The village lies at the head of Kinvara Bay, known in Irish as &quot;Cinn Mhara&quot; (or more recently &quot;Cuan Cinn Mhara&quot;), an inlet in the south-eastern corner of Galway Bay, from which the village took its name. It lies in the north of the barony of Kiltartan, close to the border with The Burren in County Clare, in the province of Munster.

The townland of Kinvarra lies in the civil parish of Kinvarradoorus. This civil parish is bounded on the north by Galway Bay, on the east by the parishes of Ballinderreen (Killeenavarra) and Ardrahan, on the south by the parishes of Gort (Kilmacduagh) and Boston (Kilkeedy) and on the west by the parishes of Carron and New Quay (Abbey and Oughtmama). It is roughly coextensive with the Ó hEidhin territory of Coill Ua bhFiachrach (wood of the Uí Fhiachrach), and this name was still in use in the mid-19th century as recorded by John O&#x27;Donovan in his Ordnance Survey letters.

==History==
===Early history===
Evidence of ancient settlement in the area include a number of promontory fort and ring fort sites in the surrounding townlands of Dungory West, Ballybranagan and Loughcurra North. There are similar sites, as well as the ruins of lime kiln and 18th century windmill, within Kinvarra townland itself.

===Dunguaire Castle===

Dunguaire Castle ( [&quot;lit&quot;, the Castle of Guaire]), a 16th-century towerhouse of the &quot;&quot; (O&#x27;Hynes) clan, is located to the east of the village. A Fearadhach Ó hEidhin (Faragh O&#x27;Hynes) is recorded as the owner of the castle in a 1574 list of castles and their owners covering County Galway. This list was thought to have been compiled for the use of the Lord Deputy Sir Henry Sidney who planned the composition of Connacht.

===Mass rock===
The Poulnegan Altar, a Mass rock located near Kinvara, is known in Connaught Irish as &quot;Poll na gCeann&quot; (&quot;chasm of the heads&quot;) and is said to have been the location of a massacre by the soldiers of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s New Model Army. Historian Tony Nugent states that, &quot;According to local tradition, there was a college nearby and some of the student monks were killed there by Cromwellian soldiers while attending Mass and their heads were thrown into a nearby chasm&quot;.

===Terry Alts===

The Terry Alts, an Irish agrarian secret society of the early 19th century, was active in the Kinvara area. In 1831, a large group of Terry Alts gathered between Kinvara and New Quay on Abbey Hill in County Clare, and challenged government troops to battle. The group dispersed before the troops arrived. They also unsuccessfully attempted to ambush a detachment of soldiers at Corranroo in the west of the parish, which led to the death of one of their members.

==Population==
The Great Famine in the 1840s, and a series of emigrations that continued until the 1960s, reduced the population of the village – once a thriving port and exporter of corn and seaweed – to no more than a few hundred people.

In the 25 years between the 1991 and 2016 census, the population of Kinvara increased by 170%, from 425 to 734 people.

==Religion==
In the Catholic Church, the ecclesiastical parish of Kinvara is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Galway, Kilmacduagh and Kilfenora. Churches within Kinvara parish include Saint Colman&#x27;s Church (built 1819) and Saint Joseph&#x27;s Church (built 1877). Saint Joseph&#x27;s Presbytery, formerly a convent, dates to .

Kinvara lies within the Church of Ireland united Diocese of Limerick and Killaloe.

==Festivals==

Kinvara is home every year to two festivals, &quot;&quot; (&quot;cuckoo festival&quot;) an Irish traditional music festival at the start of May and the &quot;Cruinniú na mBád&quot; (&quot;gathering of the boats&quot;) in mid August.

==Sports==
Kinvara is home to Kinvara GAA, a Gaelic Athletic Association club. The club is almost exclusively concerned with hurling but also plays Gaelic football at Junior level.

<text>Robert Williamson (born 13 August 1961) is a Scottish football player and manager.

Williamson played as a striker for Clydebank, Rangers, West Bromwich Albion, Rotherham United and Kilmarnock. He then became manager of Kilmarnock, winning the 1996–97 Scottish Cup. Williamson moved to Hibernian in 2002, but had less success there and left in 2004 to manage Plymouth Argyle. He was sacked by Argyle after just over a year in charge. After a short stint with Chester City, Williamson became manager of the Uganda national football team. After a spell with Kenyan Premier League club Gor Mahia during which he won the league title, Williamson was appointed as the manager of Kenya national football team.

==Playing career==
As a player, Williamson was a striker. He began his career at Clydebank and scored 35 goals in 85 matches. Williamson earned a £100,000 move to Rangers during the 1983–84 season. Five months after signing for Rangers, Williamson broke his right leg while on a night out during an end of season tour of Australia. The injury was initially expected to keep him out of action for two or three months, but Williamson did not return to full training until December 1984. After an injury-hit spell with Rangers, Williamson moved to West Bromwich Albion in 1986, in part-exchange for Jimmy Nicholl. Williamson also played in the Football League for Rotherham United. He returned to Scotland in 1990 to join Kilmarnock, which proved to be his last club as a player.

==Managerial career==

===Kilmarnock===
Williamson became the manager of Kilmarnock following the departure of Alex Totten. In his first season as manager, the club won the 1997 Scottish Cup Final by beating Falkirk 1–0 at Ibrox. Kilmarnock finished highly in the Scottish Premier League and he guided them into Europe, playing a total of four two-legged ties over three seasons. He also attracted high-profile players including former Scotland internationals Ally McCoist and Ian Durrant, and the former French international Christophe Cocard.

===Hibernian===
Williamson took up a new challenge at Hibernian in February 2002, where he inherited a team that had gone 18 league games without a win. A win against St Johnstone in Williamson&#x27;s first match in charge effectively removed the danger of relegation. Due to financial problems at the club, Williamson had to move on several senior players, but he did not endear himself to the Hibs fans. He lightheartedly joked about this relationship by referring to himself as a &quot;weegie hun&quot;. Nonetheless, Hibs produced several excellent young players, including Scott Brown, Derek Riordan, Garry O&#x27;Connor, Kevin Thomson and Steven Whittaker. Williamson guided his young team to the 2004 Scottish League Cup Final, but they were beaten 2–0 by Livingston.

===Plymouth===
Williamson moved to Plymouth Argyle on 20 April 2004. By winning his first match in charge, the club won promotion to the Football League Championship. After keeping the Pilgrims in the division in his first full campaign, a poor run of results at the start of the 2005–06 season led to his dismissal on 6 September 2005. Financial constraints at Plymouth Argyle resulted in a number of signings which contributed to his demise, most notably Taribo West. He was replaced by Tony Pulis, who had recently been sacked by fellow Championship side Stoke City.

===Chester===
Williamson appeared as a pundit on BBC Radio Scotland&#x27;s &quot;Sportsound&quot; before he was appointed as Chester City manager on 11 May 2007. Williamson&#x27;s first Football League match in charge of Chester ended in a 0–0 draw with Chesterfield on 11 August 2007 and has established them as a promotion contender in the opening months of the season. After mid-season, Chester&#x27;s form began to drop rapidly, winning only 1 out of 14 games since Boxing Day; Williamson was sacked on 2 March 2008.

===Uganda===
On 19 August 2008, Williamson was appointed by FUFA to be the coach of the Uganda national football team. Williamson replaced Csaba László, who resigned in July 2008 to join Scottish Premier League side Hearts. Within days of being appointed, Williamson was given the ultimatum of winning his first two games against Niger and Benin to earn a longer contract. He succeeded in doing that, and their FIFA World Ranking steadily improved during his first two years in charge. Williamson led his Uganda team to the 2011 CECAFA Cup.

Uganda almost qualified for the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, losing on a penalty shootout in their qualifying playoff tie against Zambia. Uganda had a bad start to 2014 World Cup qualifying, taking just two points from three games. It was announced on 8 April 2013 that Williamson had been sacked by Uganda.

===Gor Mahia===
On 5 July 2013, it was announced that Williamson agreed terms with Kenyan Premier League side Gor Mahia to join the club as their new head coach. He replaced Croatian counterpart Zdravko Logarusić, who was sacked by the club 9 days earlier, on 25 June. Williamson led Gor Mahia to their first national league championship in 18 years.

===Kenya===
In August 2014, Williamson was appointed manager of the Kenya national team. He took over the post after his last game with Gor Mahia in a league game against Sony Sugar on 24 August. He was replaced by ex-Mathare United manager Stanley Okumbi in February 2016.

<doc id="762111" wikidata="Q1789761" url="?curid=762111" title="Crocodile clip">
<text>A crocodile clip or alligator clip is a plier-like spring-tensioned metal clip with elongated, serrated jaws that is used for creating a temporary electrical connection. This simple mechanical device gets its name from the resemblance of its serrated jaws to the toothed jaws of a crocodile or alligator. It is used to clamp and grab onto a bare electrical cable to a lead on a battery or some other electrical component. The clip&#x27;s tapered, serrated jaws are forced together by a spring to grip an object. A Clothespin or Kelvin clip is a special form of crocodile clip whose jaws are insulated from each other, allowing two isolated wires to connect to a single test point. This enables 4-wire measurement of circuits with very low resistances. When manufactured for electronics testing and evaluation, one jaw of the clip is typically permanently crimped or soldered to a wire, or is bent to form the inner tubular contact of a ~ female banana jack, enabling quick non-permanent connection between a circuit under test and laboratory equipment or to another electrical circuit. The clip is typically covered by a plastic shroud or &quot;boot&quot; to prevent accidental short-circuits.

Small versions, ranging in size from in length, are used in electrical laboratory work.

Large versions of these clips, called automotive clips or battery clamps, are made of solid copper for low electrical resistance, and are used with thick insulated copper cables to make connections between automobile batteries. These [[jumper cable]]s (a.k.a. &#x27;jump leads&#x27;) are capable of delivering hundreds of Amperes of current needed to directly power an automobile starter motor, or to transfer energy from a charged lead–acid battery to a discharged one.

== History ==
The alligator clip was first introduced to the founder of the Mueller Electric Company, the primary producer of crocodile clips, by John H. Williams in 1906. It was introduced as a wire with a lightbulb in the middle, with a clip on either end of the wire. The clip was intended for use by electricians, and would allow them to easily tap into a live wire to power a portable light. The clip was mostly covered by rubber tubing as insulation. 

Several metal clip designs working on the same principle were patented in the early 20th century. A type of a crocodile clip cutting through the wire insulation was patented by Harry Frankel from New York in 1903, and another design was developed by Westinghouse Electric Corporation engineer George Brown Dusinberre, who patented it in 1909, and later was hired by Ralph S. Mueller &amp; Co. to refine the design, with a later version patented in 1921.

Dusinberre&#x27;s redesign was significantly cheaper than Williams&#x27; initial design. While Mueller approved of the design, Williams was strongly opposed to any changes to the original design. While Dusinberre offered to write Mueller as the co-inventor for his improved design while filing the patent, Mueller declined as he believed it was not his idea. 

The first models produced by Muller and Dusinberre&#x27;s partnership, R.S. Mueller &amp; Company, were steel coated with zinc. This combination of metals was easily soiled, so zinc was swapped out for nickel plating. The success of the crocodile clips is largely credited to Charles Kettering&#x27;s invention of the electric self-starter for motor vehicles. As automobile manufacturers began using this technology initially intended for Cadillacs, a need was produced for something that could connect batteries in storage to a charger. Mueller produced a larger version, for automobiles, of the crocodile clips referred to commonly as jumper cables and a smaller version for motorcycles. 

Dusinberre eventually lost interest in the company and allowed Mueller to buy out his shares for $52,300. The company was renamed Mueller Electric.

== Specifications ==
The United States Defense Logistics Agency specifies several types of electrical clips in Commercial Item Description (CID) A-A-59466. In this CID document, crocodile clips are designated type CC, alligator clips are designated types TCx, and other types of electrical clips have various other, unique designations.

== Other uses ==
* Dentistry: crocodile clips are often used on the ends of a cord in dental offices to attach a protective bib over the patient&#x27;s clothing.
* Laboratory: crocodile clips are frequently used to quickly and cheaply assemble or modify experimental circuits. They are useful for connecting components to wires.
* Education: like their laboratory use, crocodile clips are sometimes used with batteries, small lightbulbs and other small electrical devices in schools to teach students about electricity.
* Fencing: crocodile clips are used in fencing to connect to participants&#x27; lamé vests to touch-detection systems.
* Hobby: crocodile clips can be used as miniature clamps to hold items together for gluing or soldering (e.g., Helping hands tool or Clothespin).
* Camping: crocodile clips may be designed to attach a rope to a tarp or other sheet of material. (While this serves the same purpose as a grommet, it may lead to premature wear at the point of attachment.)
* Drug use: as a roach clip for holding burning cannabis to avoid burning fingers.
* Erotic use: as a clamp upon one&#x27;s nipples for sexual gratification. See nipple clamp for more information on this usage.
* Film/animation: useful for airborne scenes in possible stop-motion or holding models of any sort in mid air.
* Electronics: useful as a heat sink while soldering heat-sensitive devices.

<text>The Badge of Military Merit was an award for non-commissioned officers and soldiers of the Continental Army. It is considered America&#x27;s first military decoration, and the second oldest in the world (after the Cross of St. George). Non commissioned officers and soldiers of the Continental Army were eligible. Renamed as the Purple Heart, it was ordered redesigned in 1931, and was re-commissioned in 1932 by General Douglas MacArthur in honor of George Washington’s bicentennial.

==History==
The Badge of Military Merit was first announced in General George Washington&#x27;s general orders to the Continental Army issued on August 7, 1782, at the Headquarters in Newburgh. Designed by Washington in the form of a purple heart, it was intended as a military order for soldiers who exhibited, &quot;not only instances of unusual gallantry in battle, but also extraordinary fidelity and essential service in any way&quot;.

===First awards===
The writings of General Washington indicate that three badges, two Honorary Badges of Distinction and a Badge of Military Merit, were created on August 7, 1782. This is thought to be the first time in modern history that military awards had been presented to common soldiers. Though the French Royal Army had started awarding the Medallion of Two Swords to enlisted soldiers for longevity in 1771, the general practice in Europe was to honor high-ranking officers who had achieved victory, rather than honoring common soldiers. But in America, as General Washington said, the &quot;road to glory in a patriot army and a free country is…open to all&quot;.

On August 7, 1782, Washington issued a general order detailing the badge:
==Recipients==
Most historians indicate that only three people received the Badge of Military Merit during the American Revolutionary War, all of them noncommissioned officers, and the only ones who received the award from General Washington himself. Those soldiers were:

On May 3, 1783
*Sergeant William Brown of the 5th Connecticut Regiment of the Connecticut Line
*Sergeant Elijah Churchill of the 2nd Regiment Light Dragoons

On June 10, 1783
*Sergeant Daniel Bissell of the 2nd Connecticut Regiment of the Connecticut Line

Period records, however, indicate that several others may have been awarded the Badge of Military Merit for service in the American Revolutionary War.

==Status of original badges==
Brown&#x27;s badge was found in a Deerfield, New Hampshire barn in the 1920s. There is disagreement in published sources about what became of Brown&#x27;s badge after that. A badge on display at the American Independence Museum in Exeter, New Hampshire on behalf of the Society of the Cincinnati, New Hampshire Branch is stated to be Brown&#x27;s. Other sources say that Brown&#x27;s badge was reported lost in 1924 while in the possession of Bishop Paul Matthews, and that the badge on display in Exeter belongs to a fourth, unknown recipient.

As of 2015, Churchill&#x27;s badge was owned by the National Temple Hill Association and on display at the New Windsor Cantonment State Historic Site. Churchill&#x27;s badge was rediscovered when H. E. Johnson, a Michigan farmer and one of Churchill&#x27;s descendants, wrote to the National Temple Hill Association about the badge.

Bissell&#x27;s badge was reportedly lost when his house burned in July 1813.

==Disuse==
After the Revolutionary War, the Badge of Military Merit fell into disuse although it was never officially abolished. In 1932, the United States War Department authorized the new Purple Heart Medal for soldiers who had previously received either a Wound Chevron or the Army Wound Ribbon. At that time, it was also determined that the Purple Heart Medal would be considered the official &quot;successor decoration&quot; to the Badge of Military Merit.

==Early life and career==
Moore was born in Gander, Newfoundland. He is the son of a Pentecostal minister, R. Douglas Moore (of the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada) and his wife, Marie. He has two younger sisters and a younger brother. Due to his father&#x27;s pastoral work, Moore spent time during his childhood living near Syracuse, New York and also spent eight years from late childhood to his mid-teenage years living in Boiling Springs, Pennsylvania. While in Pennsylvania, he attended Bethel Christian Academy, a school in Carlisle, Pennsylvania affiliated with his father&#x27;s church, Bethel Assembly of God. After completing the 8th grade at Bethel Christian Academy (now called Carlisle Christian Academy), he briefly attended Boiling Springs High School (with the South Middleton School District) in Boiling Springs, PA. His family returned to Canada in the summer of 1989 when his father, a Canadian citizen, started a church. Moore completed his high school education at Kennebecasis Valley High School in 1992.

Moore has a Bachelor of Arts degree in Business Administration and a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of New Brunswick. He was admitted to the Law Society of New Brunswick in June 2000.

He and his wife Melinda live in Quispamsis with their two daughters, Madeline and Katelyn and his two sons Luke and Robert.

==Political career==
Moore ran in the 2000 federal election for the Canadian Alliance in the New Brunswick riding of Fundy—Royal. He finished third, with 8,392 votes behind John Herron of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

Following the 2003 merger of the Progressive Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance into the new Conservative Party of Canada, Moore ran as the Conservative candidate in the 2004 election in the reshaped riding of Fundy against Herron, who had not supported the merger and ran as the Liberal candidate in the 2004 election. Moore won the rematch.

In the 2006 election, Moore defeated three opponents: Eldon Hunter of the Liberal Party of Canada, Rob Moir of the New Democratic Party, and Patty Donovan of the Green Party of Canada. The Conservatives, led by Stephen Harper, replaced the Liberals&#x27; minority government with one of their own in 2006. When the new government was sworn in in February 2006, Moore was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. Moore&#x27;s duties as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice included representing the Minister in Parliament and in the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights.

Harper led the Conservative minority government as Prime Minister of Canada for over two years before the 2008 Canadian federal election after which a coalition threat was narrowly defeated by a combination of delaying tactics and leadership shifts in the Liberal Party of Canada. Moore was personally re-elected.

On January 19, 2010, Harper appointed Moore to cabinet as the Minister of State (Small Business and Tourism). He replaced Diane Ablonczy, who moved to Minister of State (Seniors). He was eventually released from cabinet after the general election in May 2011 (in which the Conservatives won their first majority government since their re-formation under that name). Michael Sona, the only person charged in relation the 2011 Canadian federal election voter suppression scandal, worked for a time as a communications special assistant for Moore after the election.

On July 15, 2013, Moore was reinstated in the cabinet and named Minister of State (ACOA) and Regional Minister for New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador in a cabinet shuffle. Moore ran for reelection as the Conservative candidate for Fundy Royal in the 2015 Canadian federal election but lost to Alaina Lockhart, who became only the second Liberal in a century to win what was generally a safe Conservative seat.

On September 15, 2016, Moore was appointed as the Conservative critic for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA) by Interim Leader of the Conservative Party, Rona Ambrose, replacing Scott Armstrong. He was the only Conservative Party critic who was not a member of either the Senate of Canada or the House of Commons of Canada.

Moore regained his seat of Fundy Royal, defeating Lockhart, in the 2019 Canadian federal election.

Moore endorsed Peter MacKay in the 2020 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election. He was re-elected in the 2021 federal election.

<text>Andrés José Padovani Galarraga (; born June 18, 1961) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball first baseman, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Montreal Expos (– and ), St. Louis Cardinals (), Colorado Rockies (–), Atlanta Braves (–), Texas Rangers (), San Francisco Giants (2001 and ) and Anaheim Angels (). He batted and threw right-handed. During his playing days, Galarraga stood tall, weighing .

Galarraga began his professional career in Venezuela at the age of 16. He was nicknamed &quot;the Big Cat&quot; (textually translated from English as &quot;El Gran Gato&quot;, although his nickname in his native Venezuela was El Gato) for his impressively quick reflexes and seamless defensive skills as a first baseman despite his large physical size. Galarraga was a five-time National League (NL) All-Star, won two NL Gold Glove Awards and two NL Silver Slugger Awards, and won two MLB Comeback Player of the Year Awards, the second time after his successful return to baseball following cancer treatment.

==Career==

===Venezuelan Winter League===
Galarraga was signed by the Leones del Caracas as a catcher and third baseman. He made his debut in the – season. Some of the players Galarraga had as teammates included big-leaguers Tony Armas, Bo Díaz, Manny Trillo, Gonzalo Márquez, and Leo Hernández. Galarraga originally started as a utility player, but three seasons later he became the regular first baseman of the team. At the recommendation of team manager Felipe Alou, he was signed by the Expos in 1979. At the time, some MLB scouts thought the 17-year-old power-hitting prodigy was too overweight to play professionally. Galarraga played with this team until 1993, when he retired from Venezuelan Winter League.

===Minor leagues===
In Minor League Baseball (MiLB), Galarraga played for the West Palm Beach Expos (, –), Calgary Expos (1979–), Jamestown Expos (), Jacksonville Suns (), and Indianapolis Indians (). Galarraga was named Double-A Southern League Most Valuable Player for Jacksonville in 1984, with a .289 batting average, 27 home runs and 87 runs batted in (RBI). He also led the league in total bases (271), slugging percentage (.508), intentional base on balls (10), hit by pitches (9), and in double plays (130) and total chances (1428) at first base. Prior to his major league promotion, Galarraga hit .269/25/85, in 121 games with Indianapolis, being named as the Triple-A International League (IL) Rookie of the Year.

===Montreal Expos (1985–1991)===
Galarraga made his debut with Montreal on August 23, 1985. During that season&#x27;s last six-plus weeks, he struggled, hitting .187 (14-for-75), with two homers, and four RBI, in 24 games. Galarraga had a promising start in , but it was interrupted, when he suffered a knee injury; at the time, he had already posted eight home runs and was leading all NL rookies with 25 runs batted in. Galarraga underwent arthroscopic knee surgery, on July 10. He was activated one month later, only to be re-injured the following day after pulling muscles in his rib cage. Galarraga returned to action in September, ending with .271, 10 home runs, and 42 RBI, in 105 games.
Overshadowed by some teammates, Galarraga survived a tough rookie year and quietly enjoyed a consistently strong season. He hit .305 with 13 home runs, 90 RBI, and finishing second in the league in doubles (40). Despite his size, Galarraga displayed solid defense, being adept at scooping throws out of the dirt and excellent quickness turning the 3-6-3 double play. Cardinals&#x27; manager Whitey Herzog called him &quot;the best-fielding right-handed first baseman I&#x27;ve seen since Gil Hodges.&quot;

In , Galarraga emerged from the shadows to become the best player on the Expos. He had an MVP-caliber season with a .302 batting average, 99 runs, 29 home runs, and 92 RBI. Galarraga also led the league in hits (184) and doubles (42), and earned an All-Star berth for the first time in his career. He was named the Montreal Expos Player of the Year at the end of the season.

 was a rough season however for the Big Cat. Galarraga became a target of Montreal fans&#x27; frustration when he tailed off after the All-Star game. That year, Galarraga led the league in strikeouts (158), dropping his production to .257, 23 home runs, and 85 RBI. He fell five RBI short of becoming the first Expo to string together three straight seasons with 90 or more RBI. Despite the rough season, Galarraga blasted his first grand slam, stole home for the first time in his career, and was rewarded with a Gold Glove Award for his stellar play at first base.

Galarraga&#x27;s season had Expos mumbling that the team should lower its expectations for the slick-fielding first baseman. For the second consecutive season, the Big Cat failed to repeat the standards he set in his first two full seasons. Galarraga hit .256 with 20 home runs and 87 RBI, almost a mirror image of his previous season. For the third consecutive year, he led the league in strikeouts; pitchers exploited Galarraga&#x27;s impatience at the plate and didn&#x27;t give him good pitches to hit. Even without any improvement with the bat, Galarraga continued to make tremendous contributions on the field, scooping up infielder&#x27;s errant throws, starting 3-6-3 double plays, and winning his second Gold Glove. That season he also had a six-RBI game, two four-RBI games, and hit his first career inside-the-park home run.

Slowed by injuries, Galarraga struggled through the worst offensive season of his career in . Disabled with a strained left hamstring between May and July, he later had arthroscopic surgery to repair damage to the undersurface of his left kneecap. Montreal missed Galarraga&#x27;s glove as much as his bat, committing 43 infield errors in 53 games without him. That season, Galarraga hit .219, 9 home runs, and 33 RBI, in 107 games. He stole home for the second time in his career and hit his 100th career home run. At the end of the season, Galarraga was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for starting pitcher Ken Hill.

===St. Louis Cardinals (1992)===
Galarraga had a second chance with the Cardinals; however, a pitch broke his wrist early in the season and he didn&#x27;t recover until July. Galarraga batted .296 after the All-Star break and hit all ten of his homers after July 1 for a .497 second-half slugging percentage. He finished with a .243 batting average and 39 RBI, but made a good impression on Cardinals batting coach Don Baylor. When Baylor became the first Rockies manager in the off-season, he recommended that Colorado take a chance on Galarraga and sign him as a free agent.

===Colorado Rockies (1993–1997)===
====National League batting champion (1993)====

By joining the Rockies, Galarraga was given new life for his career. In a season full of remarkable individual achievements, he solidified his stature as an accomplished hitter, and flirted with the .400 mark for much of the season. Galarraga&#x27;s final .370 batting average was a 127-point increase over his previous year mark. He led National League batters in batting average, and it was the highest average by a right-handed hitter since Joe DiMaggio batted .381 in .

Despite missing 42 games with assorted injuries, The Big Cat compiled 56 multi-hit games to lead the league. He added 22 homers, 98 RBI, 71 runs, 35 doubles, four triples, a .403 on-base percentage, and his .602 slugging percentage was second in the league. Galarraga&#x27;s .370 mark made him the first player on an expansion team as well as the first Venezuelan to win a batting title. Tony Gwynn hit .358 to finish as runner-up in the title race. Galarraga finished 10th in the MVP selection, but won &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Comeback Player of the Year Award. After the season, and for third time, he underwent arthroscopic knee surgery. In the strike-shortened season, Galarraga set a new National League record in April by driving in 30 runs in a month. He seemed to be on his way to a terrific year again, but he fractured his right hand on July 28. At the time of Galarraga&#x27;s injury, Colorado had climbed to within a half-game of the first place Los Angeles Dodgers. Without him however, the Rockies went 3–10 the rest of the way. Galarraga paced the club with 31 homers (fifth in the league), and batted .319 with 85 RBI.

On June 25, 1995, Galarraga hit a home run in three consecutive innings to tie an MLB record. He finished the season hitting .280, with 31 homers, and 106 RBI. Galarraga&#x27;s numbers were helped by the fact that he stayed healthy for the first time in four years. That season, the Rockies had four players with 30 or more home runs, matching the Dodgers. On August 29 of the same season, in a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Galarraga spoiled Paul Wagner&#x27;s bid for a no-hitter, by singling with two out in the ninth; it was the only hit Wagner would allow in defeating the Rockies 4–0.

Over the next few seasons, Galarraga developed into one of the best RBI-men in baseball, driving in a combined 411 runs between and (150, 140, and 121). In the same period, he batted .304, .318, and .305, with 47, 41, and 44 home runs, respectively. Some critics argued that Galarraga&#x27;s achievements were possible thanks to the thin-air, mile-high, hitter-friendly Coors Field, but he also belted many homers on the road that traveled over .

====NL RBI leader (1997)====
Perhaps the most famous home run Galarraga hit was a mammoth grand slam off Kevin Brown on May 31, 1997, which landed 20 rows deep into the upper deck at Florida Marlins&#x27; Pro Player Stadium. It may also be his most debated home run with a distance initially measured at and then . At the time, it set a record for both the Rockies and the stadium. In 2011, ESPN&#x27;s Home Run Tracker recalculated the distance to . But in 2017, the Baseball Research Journal published an analysis by Jose L. Lopez PhD, and Oscar A. Lopez PhD—professors of Engineering at the Central University of Venezuela—that concluded that Galarraga&#x27;s home run travelled between 517.5 and 529.4 feet. This makes Galarraga&#x27;s May 31, 1997 grand slam one of the few pre-Statcast home runs to be proven to have exceeded 500 feet. Previously, Galarraga smashed two homers in two games that traveled and respectively, totaling , an average of each.

The Rockies released Galarraga at the end of the season to make room at first base for prospect Todd Helton. At the time of his release, Galarraga was the club&#x27;s all-time leader in home runs (172) and RBI (579). As a free agent, he signed a three-year contract with the Atlanta Braves.

===Atlanta Braves (1998–2000)===
In Galarraga&#x27;s first season in Atlanta (1998), he hit .305, with 44 home runs, and 121 RBI. This made him the first player in MLB history to hit 40 or more homers in consecutive seasons for two different teams. During spring training, Galarraga developed a sore back. Treatment from the team&#x27;s trainers and team doctor included hydrobaths, massages, muscle relaxers, and stretching, but would not stop the nagging soreness. Galarraga was referred to a medical oncologist in Atlanta for a thorough physical exam and an MRI. On the second lumbar vertebra in his lower back, Galarraga had a tumor known as non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, a form of lymphatic cancer. He missed the entire 1999 season receiving chemotherapy treatments. Rockies third baseman and ex-teammate Vinny Castilla switched briefly from his traditional number 9 to number 14 on his jersey, to honor Galarraga&#x27;s cancer fight.

In Spring , Galarraga returned to the field after undergoing chemotherapy and a strict workout routine. In his third at-bat of opening day of the 2000 season, Galarraga knocked in the winning run with a home run. In April and May, he was tied for first place in home runs in the National League and he was batting .300. At the end of the season, Galarraga had batted .302, with 28 home runs, and 100 RBI. He was awarded his second National League Comeback Player of the Year Award by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. Galarraga asked the Braves’ ownership for a two-year contract, but the most that it would offer was a one-year contract. Hence, he decided to become a free agent, and signed with the Texas Rangers, who were willing to offer Galarraga the contract for two years that he sought.

===Rangers, Giants, and Expos (2001–2003)===
The change of baseball leagues affected Galarraga badly in . At age 40, he found himself &quot;lost&quot; in a different league, facing different pitchers, and stuck in a back-up position with the star Rafael Palmeiro as the main first baseman for the Texas Rangers. Galarraga was used mainly as a designated hitter (DH), as a pinch-hitter, and occasionally as a starter against left-handed pitchers. After a disappointing .235 batting average, 10 home runs, and 34 RBI, in 72 games, he was traded to the San Francisco Giants, at mid-season.

In , Galarraga signed with the Expos for the full season. He then returned to the Giants in , after signing a minor league contract, prior to the season. As a part-time player with the Giants, Galarraga batted .301, with 12 home runs, and 42 RBI.

===Anaheim Angels (2004)===
In , Galarraga&#x27;s cancer recurred and he underwent two three-week periods of chemotherapy and was hospitalized for 23 days for additional treatment. This was the same non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma that had sidelined Galarraga in 1999, but he beat it for the second time and began play with the Anaheim Angels&#x27; Triple-A affiliate, the Salt Lake Stingers. When rosters were expanded in September, Galarraga came back to the major leagues. Although he served mostly as a bench player in Anaheim, Galarraga was highly regarded in the clubhouse, especially among younger players such as Vladimir Guerrero, for whom Galarraga became a voice of experience. He saw action in a few games, hitting one home run — the 399th and final home run of Galarraga&#x27;s storied big league career.

===New York Mets (2005)===

In , Galarraga again found himself with a new team, the New York Mets, who had invited him to spring training, not knowing if the 43-year-old would be a good fit for their roster. Galarraga showed that he had some gas left in the tank offensively by socking three home runs, but appeared very tentative on the defensive end. Galarraga eventually retired during spring training on March 29, 2005, saying it was &quot;the right time to give a younger guy a chance to play.&quot; He finished his career with a .288 batting average, 399 home runs, and 1,425 RBI. Galarraga ranked 36th all-time in career home runs at the time of his retirement.

<doc id="762131" wikidata="Q2311628" url="?curid=762131" title="Hiromi Tsuru">
<text>was a Japanese actress and narrator. During her life, she was attached to the Himawari Theatre Group as a child and then to Aoni Production at the time of her death. She was most known for voicing the character of Bulma (&quot;Dragon Ball&quot;) for over 31 years. She was also known for her roles as Ukyo Kuonji (&quot;Ranma ½&quot;), Dokin-chan (&quot;Soreike! Anpanman&quot;), Madoka Ayukawa (&quot;Kimagure Orange Road&quot;), Miyuki Kashima (&quot;Miyuki&quot;), Reiko Mikami (&quot;Ghost Sweeper Mikami&quot;), Meryl Strife (&quot;Trigun&quot;), Naomi Hunter (&quot;Metal Gear&quot; series), Oyone-baasan (&quot;Chibi Maruko-chan&quot;), and Asuna Kujo (&quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot;).

==Biography==
Tsuru was born in Chitose, Hokkaido. In the second grade of elementary school, she joined the Himawari Theatre Group with her sister. In 1968, Tsuru auditioned for &quot;Princess Comet&quot; (TBS) and made her drama debut in episode 63 &quot;Yokai no Mori&quot;. In 1969, she also appeared in the fourth episode &quot;Masked Cemetery&quot; of &quot;Horror Theater Unbalance&quot; (Fuji TV) under the direction of Eizo Yamagiwa and with the same script by Shinichi Ichikawa.

After that, she appeared on the cover of learning magazines, fashion shows for children&#x27;s clothing, and television dramas such as &quot;Aya no Onna&quot; (Fuji TV). Tsuru also lent her voice to Jodie Foster in the American film &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; aired on Sunday Western Painting Theater (TV Asahi).

==Career==
After debuting as an actress, Tsuru graduated from Tsurumi High School in Kanagawa Prefecture. In 1978, when she was a junior in high school, she auditioned for the &quot;World Masterpiece Theater&quot; series &quot;The Story of Perrine&quot; and made her voice acting debut in the role of the main character, Perrine Paindavoine. After the airing of &quot;The Story of Perrine&quot;, she hadn&#x27;t been a voice actor for two years, but in 1981 she was in charge of the cat role in &quot;Ohayō! Spank&quot;.

In 1982, after auditioning for the role of Revi in &quot;Arcadia of My Youth: Endless Orbit SSX&quot;, she transferred from the Sunaoka office to Aoni Production in order to work on her voice in earnest. Since then, Tsuru was active as a voice actress.

Starting in the 1990s, Tsuru started working mainly as a narrator on variety shows and newscasts, occasionally appearing on stage. She worked as a narrator until shortly before her death.

==Personal life==
She was married to Keiichi Nanba from 1986 until they divorced in 1990. They had no children.

==Death==
On November 16, 2017, at around 7:30 PM, Tsuru was found unconscious in her car on the Inner Circular Route near Nihonbashi in Tokyo. The car was stopped, the hazard lights were on, and Tsuru was still wearing her seatbelt. She was transported to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. She was 57 years old. There were no external wounds and no sign of an accident. Police believed it was highly likely she died from an illness. Her agency later confirmed that she died from aortic dissection.

<text>Hugh Swinton Legaré ( ; January 2, 1797 – June 20, 1843) was an American lawyer, diplomat and politician from South Carolina who served as the 16th United States Attorney General under President John Tyler.

Legaré served as Attorney General of South Carolina from 1830 to 1832 before President Andrew Jackson appointed him as the acting minister to the new Kingdom of Belgium. On his return to the United States, he was elected to represent Charleston in the United States House of Representatives but lost re-election to Isaac E. Holmes.

Following the 1841 death of President William Henry Harrison and the resignation of Whigs from the cabinet, Legaré was named United States Attorney General by John Tyler. He served as Attorney General until his death in office on June 20, 1843. For the final month of his life, Legaré also served as United States Secretary of State &quot;ad interim&quot; following the resignation of Daniel Webster.

==Life and career==
Legaré was born in Charleston, South Carolina, of Huguenot and Scottish ancestry.

Partly due to his inability to share in the amusements of his fellows, as a result of a vaccine-related deformity suffered before he was five that permanently stunted the growth and development of his legs; Legaré was an eager student and was president of the Clariosophic Society at the College of South Carolina (now University of South Carolina at Columbia), from which he graduated in 1814 with the highest rank in his class and with a reputation for scholarship and eloquence.

After graduation, he studied the law for three years, did advanced work in Paris and Edinburgh in 1818 and 1819 and in 1822 was admitted to the South Carolina bar.

After practicing for a time in Charleston, he became a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives, serving between 1820 and 1821 and then again between 1824 and 1830. He also founded and edited the &quot;Southern Review&quot; between 1828 and 1832.

From 1830 until 1832 he was the Attorney General of South Carolina, and he supported states&#x27; rights, he strongly opposed nullification. He was Attorney General until he was appointed chargé d&#x27;affaires to Brussels in 1832, serving there until 1836. In 1838, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

On his return he was elected to the 25th Congress as a Democrat, but failed in a re-election bid the following term. In 1841 President John Tyler named him Attorney General of the United States and he served in that office until his death. He also served as Secretary of State ad interim from May 8, 1843, until his death.

He died in Boston while attending ceremonies for the unveiling of the Bunker Hill Monument. He died, by &quot;internal strangulation..the twisting of the intestine upon itself.&quot; He was first interred in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was later re-interred in Magnolia Cemetery in Charleston. The &quot;USCGC Legare&quot;, which is a medium endurance cutter, was named in his honor.

<text>Peter Francisco (born Pedro Francisco; July 9, 1760 – January 16, 1831) was a Portuguese-born American blacksmith and soldier best known for his service in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.

==Early life ==

Francisco&#x27;s very early years are shrouded in mystery. It is believed he was born on July 9, 1760, at Porto Judeu, on the island of Terceira, in the Archipelago of the Azores, Portugal. In the case of the origin of his identification with the child named Pedro Francisco, his parents, Luiz Francisco Machado and Antónia Maria, natives of mainland Portugal (then an empire under the government of the Marquis of Pombal), a relatively wealthy and noble family, settled on the Island of Terceira (where he was born), distancing themselves more from personal or political enemies in the continent. According to the traditional version of his biography, he was found at about age five on the docks at City Point, Virginia, in 1765, and was taken to the Prince George County Poorhouse. Not speaking English, he repeated the name &quot;Pedro Francisco&quot;. The locals called him Peter. They soon discovered the boy spoke Portuguese and noted his clothing was of good quality.

When able to communicate, Pedro said that he had lived in a mansion near the ocean. His mother spoke French and his father spoke another language that he did not know. He and his sister were kidnapped from the grounds, but his sister escaped, while Francisco was bound and taken to a ship. Historians believe it is possible that the kidnappers intended to hold the children for ransom or that they had intended to sell them as indentured servants at their destination port in North America, but changed their minds. The Azorean legend says the Francisco family had many political enemies and set up Peter&#x27;s abduction to protect him from accident or death by his parents&#x27; foes.

Peter was taken in by the judge Anthony Winston of Buckingham County, Virginia, an uncle of Patrick Henry&#x27;s. Francisco lived with Winston and his family until the beginning of the American Revolution and was tutored by them. When he was old enough to work, he was apprenticed as a blacksmith, a profession chosen because of his massive size and strength (he grew to be six feet and eight inches in height, or 203 centimeters, and weigh some 260 pounds, or 118 kilograms, especially large at the time). It was also noted that his hair may have turned silver at an early age. He was well known as the Virginian Hercules or the Virginia Giant.

==American Revolutionary War==

At the age of 16, Francisco joined the 10th Virginia Regiment in 1776 and soon gained notoriety for his size and strength. He fought with distinction at numerous engagements, including the Battle of Brandywine in September. He fought a few skirmishes under Colonel Daniel Morgan, before transferring to the regiment of Colonel John Mayo of Powhatan. In October, Francisco rejoined his regiment and fought in the Battle of Germantown and the Siege of Fort Mifflin on Port Island in the Delaware River. Francisco was hospitalized at Valley Forge for two weeks following these engagements. On June 28, 1778, he fought at the Battle of Monmouth, where an enemy musket ball tore through his right thigh. He never fully recovered from this wound, but fought at the Battle of Cowpens and other battles.

Francisco was part of General Anthony Wayne&#x27;s attack on the British fort of Stony Point on the Hudson River. Upon attacking the fort, Francisco suffered a nine-inch gash in his stomach, but continued to fight; he was second to enter the fort. Francisco&#x27;s entry into the fort is mentioned in Wayne&#x27;s report on the battle to General Washington, dated July 17, 1779, and in a letter written by Captain William Evans to accompany Francisco&#x27;s letter to the Virginia General Assembly in November 1820 for pay. As a result of being the second man to enter the fort, he received 200 dollars.

Following the Battle of Camden, South Carolina, Francisco noticed the Americans were leaving behind one of their valuable cannons, mired in mud. Legend says he freed and picked up the approximately 1,100-pound cannon and carried it on his shoulder to keep it from falling into the hands of the enemy. In a letter Francisco wrote to the Virginia General Assembly on November 11, 1820, he said that at Camden, he had killed a grenadier who had tried to shoot Colonel Mayo. He also claimed he escaped on horseback after bayoneting a British Legion cavalryman, shouting cries to make the British think he was a Loyalist; the horse was later given to Mayo.

Hearing that Colonel William Washington was headed on a march through the Carolinas, Francisco joined him, participating in the Battle of Guilford Courthouse in North Carolina. He reportedly killed eleven enemy soldiers during the battle, including one who wounded him severely in the thigh with a bayonet. In his own words, Francisco was &quot;seen to kill two men, besides making many other panes [&quot;sic&quot;] which were doubtless fatal to others.&quot; These purported actions were commemorated with a monument to Francisco at the Guilford Courthouse National Military Park.

===Francisco&#x27;s Fight===

Francisco was sent home to Buckingham, Virginia to recuperate. He volunteered to spy on the British Legion, who were operating in the area. On this journey, he performed his best-known action: Francisco&#x27;s Fight. He claimed to have defeated a British Legion detachment and captured several of their horses. Legend has it that he killed or mortally wounded three of an eleven-man patrol. According to Henry Howe, the alleged encounter happened when one night, nine British Legion cavalrymen surrounded Francisco outside of a tavern and ordered him to be arrested. They told him to give over his silver shoe buckles. Francisco told them take the buckles themselves. When they began to seize his shoe buckles, Francisco took a soldier&#x27;s saber and struck him on the head. The wounded soldier fired his pistol, grazing Francisco&#x27;s side; Francisco nearly cut off the soldier&#x27;s hand. Another soldier aimed a musket at Francisco, but it misfired. Francisco grabbed it from the soldier&#x27;s hands, knocked him off his mount, and escaped with the horse. 

However, in his 1820 letter to the Virginia legislature, Francisco reported having killed one and wounded eight enemy soldiers along with capturing eight of their horses. In an 1829 petition to the United States Congress, he claimed to have killed three enemy soldiers and frightened the other six away while capturing eight of their horses. In 1781, Francisco was ordered by his commanding officer to join the Franco-American army participating in the siege of Yorktown; he arrived too late to participate in the fighting but witnessed the surrender of the besieged British army under the command of Lord Cornwallis.

==Later years==

Following the end of the American Revolutionary War, Francisco pursued his basic education. He went to school with young children, who were fascinated by his stories of the war. Legends of Francisco&#x27;s strength abounded during his lifetime. In December 1784, Peter married Susannah Anderson of Cumberland County, Virginia. She was the daughter of Captain James Anderson and his wife Elizabeth Tyler Baker Anderson. The Andersons were of social distinction and owned a plantation called &quot;The Mansion.&quot; Peter and Susannah had two children: a son, James Anderson, born in the log house in 1786; and a daughter, Polly, born in 1788. Peter sold the 250 acres on Louse Creek in 1788. His wife Susannah died in 1790 of dysentery. In December 1794, Peter married Catherine Fauntleroy Brooke, who was a relative of his first wife&#x27;s, and they moved to Peter&#x27;s home in Cumberland. Peter and Catherine had four children: Susan Brooke Francisco (born 1796), Benjamin M. Francisco (born 1803), Peter II, and Catherine Fauntleroy Francisco. His second wife died in 1821, and he married for the third time, in July 1823, this time to Mary Grymes West.

==Death==
In his later years, Francisco was poor and had petitioned Congress and the Virginia legislature for a pension. He spent the last three years of his life working as the Sergeant-at-Arms to the Virginia State Senate. He died of appendicitis, on January 16, 1831, and was buried with full military honors in Shockoe Hill Cemetery in Richmond. The Virginia state legislature adjourned for the day, and many legislators attended his funeral.

==Legacy and honors==

<text>Colt Stadium was a Major League baseball stadium that formerly stood in Houston, Texas. It was the temporary home of the expansion Houston Colt .45s for their first three seasons (1962–1964) while the Astrodome was being built, just to the south of it.

After its use in Houston, it was dismantled and moved for use in two Mexican cities.

==Houston==
The stadium consisted of an uncovered one-level grandstand, stretching from foul pole to foul pole, with small bleacher stands in right and left field. One baseball annual published just before the season referred to it as &quot;a barn-like thing.&quot; It is best remembered for the horribly hot and humid weather (and attendant mosquito population) that had necessitated building the first domed stadium. The field was conventionally aligned northeast (home to center field) at an elevation of above sea level.

Temporary from the outset, the stadium was abandoned when the Astrodome was completed for the 1965 season. The Astros occasionally used it for running and exercising to acclimatize players to warm weather before a road trip. However, the players had to be careful, as rattlesnakes would often take up residence on the field. Monsanto engineers also used it as a testing ground for its synthetic ChemGrass, later known as AstroTurf, inviting cars and horses to ride on the synthetic surface to gauge its durability. It sat abandoned for ten years, accumulating random odds and ends from nearby Astroworld and weathering in the blistering Texas sun.

The right field corner of the stadium was located in what is now the northwest corner of NRG Center. Much of the northern half of the stadium (center field, left field and the third base stands) is occupied by a power station, and home plate was approximately located where a light pole in the adjacent parking lot is.

===No-hitters===
The stadium was the site of two no-hitters, both thrown by Houston, but the visitors scored in both and one was a Colts&#x27; loss. In 1963, Don Nottebart shut down the Philadelphia Phillies on May 17, but an error in the fifth inning and two sacrifices scored a run for the visitors; Houston won, The following year, knuckleball thrower Ken Johnson kept the Cincinnati Reds hitless on April 23, but an unearned run scored by Pete Rose in the ninth broke a scoreless tie and the Reds won, With one out, Rose bunted and reached second on Johnson&#x27;s throwing error, advanced to third on a fielder&#x27;s choice, and scored after another 

===Low attendance===
Against the hapless New York Mets late in both teams&#x27; first season, only 1,638 attended the first game of a doubleheader on Saturday, September 8, 1962.
====Season totals====
*1962: 924,456 (7th of 10 NL teams)
*1963: 719,502 (10th of 10)
*1964: 725,773 (10th of 10)

The three seasons combined to 2,369,731; the first season at the Astrodome drew 2,151,470 in 1965.

==Mexico==
===Torreón===
By the early 1970s, Colt Stadium had become a county tax liability, with a lien on it. In 1971, it was sold to the owners of the Algodoneros del Unión Laguna, a Mexican League team, and was dismantled and shipped in pieces over the next four years to Torreón, Coahuila, Mexico, for use as the team&#x27;s home venue. Renamed Estadio Superior in a naming rights deal with a beer sponsor, Unión Laguna used the stadium between 1975 and 1981. It was located near the Estadio Corona soccer stadium on land used today for a soft drink company. The stadium was popularly known as the Estadio Mecano or &quot;Millón de Tuercas&quot; (Million Screws) due to its ability to be assembled and its resemblance to an Erector set.

===Tampico===
In 1981, the owner of Unión Laguna, Juan Abusaid Ríos, had a falling out with Governor of Coahuila José de las Fuentes. Abusaid sold the team to the Sindicato de Trabajadores Petroleros de la República Mexicana (Union of Oil Workers of the Mexican Republic), which moved the franchise to Tampico, Tamaulipas. While the stadium was taken down in Torreón and moved to Tampico, the franchise spent the 1982 season in Monclova, Coahuila as the Astros de Monclova.

In 1983, the Astros became the Astros de Tamaulipas, playing three full seasons at the stadium, known in Tampico as the Estadio Ángel Castro. The franchise moved again after the 1985 season, this time without the stadium. The Mexico City Tigers bought the stadium with the intent of moving it yet again to serve as the club&#x27;s new home, but with the venue already showing structural weakness after years in the humid Tampico climate, the plans were scuttled. Ultimately, some rows of seats were reassembled at a ballfield in Pasteje, Jocotitlán, State of Mexico, and the others remained in a Tampico playground until that, too, was demolished. &quot;El Mecano&quot; became the only major league ballpark to be sent down to the minors and the only one to play host to three professional teams in two nations.

<text>John Murray (December 10, 1741 – September 3, 1815) was one of the founders of the Universalist denomination in the United States, a pioneer minister and an inspirational figure.

==Early life==
He was born in Alton, Hampshire (fifteen miles northeast of Winchester), in England on December 10, 1741. His father was an Anglican and his mother a Presbyterian, both strict Calvinists, and his home life was attended by religious severity. In 1751 the family settled near Cork, Ireland. In 1760 Murray returned to England and joined George Whitefield&#x27;s congregation; but embracing, somewhat later, the Universalistic teachings of Welsh minister James Relly he was excommunicated. In 1770 he emigrated to &quot;lose himself in America&quot;, and preached, as a Universalist minister, his first sermon in Good Luck, now Lacey Township, New Jersey, September 30, 1770, residing there with his patron and friend Thomas Potter until 1774, itinerating from Virginia to New Hampshire. Today the Potter farm is the site of the Murray Grove Retreat and Renewal Center .

==Mature life==

In 1774, he settled at Gloucester, Massachusetts and established a congregation there out of a Rellyite study group. There he met his second wife, the author and philosopher Judith Sargent Murray. He was suspected of being a British spy, but in 1775 was appointed chaplain of the Rhode Island Brigade before Boston by General George Washington despite petitions for his dismissal by other chaplains over his rejection of belief in hell. He participated in the first general Universalist Convention at Oxford, Massachusetts, September, 1785. On October 23, 1793, he became pastor of the Universalist society of Boston, and faithfully served it until October 19, 1809, when paralysis stopped his work. He was a man of great courage and eloquence, and in the defense of his views endured much detestation and abuse. In regard to Jesus, he taught that in him God became the Son; for &quot;God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, are no more than different exhibitions of the self-same existent, omnipresent Being.&quot; He taught that all men would ultimately be saved through the sacrifice of Christ, the basis for this being the union of all men in Christ, just as they were united with Adam, and therefore partaking of the benefits of his sacrifice. He was also a writer of hymns and a compiler of hymnals.

Murray suffered a debilitating stroke on October 19, 1809, which compelled him to give up preaching, and he died in Boston, Massachusetts on September 3, 1815. His wife, Judith Sargent Murray, collected and finished his autobiography to publish posthumously. Murray is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge and Watertown, MA.

==Writings==
Sources are his own &quot;Letters and Sketches of Sermons&quot;, 3 volumes, Boston, 1812; &quot;Autobiography, continued by his wife&quot;, (also known as &quot;Life of Murray&quot;), Boston, 1816, centenary ed., 1870.
Additional information and detailed writings from the letters of his wife Judith Sargent Murray were published in 1998 (edited by Bonnie Hurd Smith), in the book &quot;From Gloucester to Philadelphia in 1790&quot; with &quot;Observations, anecdotes and thoughts from the 18th century letters of Judith Sargent Murray&quot;. This publication describes the life of the Murray family as they traveled in 1790, with the majority of time in Philadelphia.

==Legacy==
In 1875 a church was built in Attleboro, Massachusetts named after him. Services are still held, but it is now Unitarian Universalist.

<text>Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics (ICE) is a term used in the cyberpunk subgenre to refer to security programs which protect computerized data from being accessed by hackers.

==Origin of term==
The term was popularized by William Gibson in his short story &quot;Burning Chrome&quot;, which also introduced the term &quot;cyberspace&quot;, and in his subsequent novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot;. According to the Jargon File, as well as Gibson&#x27;s own acknowledgements, the term ICE was originally coined by Tom Maddox.

==Description of ICE ==
When viewed in a cyberspace virtual reality environment, these constructs are often represented by actual walls of ice, stone, or metal. Black ICE refers to ICE that are capable of killing the intruder if deemed necessary or appropriate; some forms of black ICE may be artificially intelligent.

==Real-world usage==

Though real-life firewalls, anti-virus software and similar programs fall under this classification, the term has little real world significance and remains primarily a science fiction concept. This can be attributed to the fact that using the term &quot;electronics&quot; to describe software products (such as firewalls) is something of a misnomer. On the other hand, there is a strong connection between real-world cybercrime and cyberpunk literature. &quot;The Gibsonian concept of cyberspace [...] fed back into both computer and information systems design and theory,&quot; wrote Roger Burrows.

The term ICE has occasionally been used for real-world software:
* &quot;BlackICE&quot;, an intrusion detection system built by a California company named Network ICE in 1999, acquired by IBM Internet Security Systems, then discontinued in 2007.
* The ICE cipher, an encryption algorithm, may be inspired by Gibson&#x27;s ICE, but it is explained as meaning &quot;Information Concealment Engine&quot;.
* The Java bytecode verifier in the Apache ByteCode Engineering Library (BCEL) is called JustIce (see the &#x27;docs&#x27; folder for documentation).

On April 28, 2009, the Information and Communications Enhancement Act, or ICE Act for short, was introduced to the United States Senate by Senator Tom Carper to make changes to the handling of information security by the federal government, including the establishment of the National Office for Cyberspace.

==Usage in fiction==
The term &quot;ICE&quot; is widely used in cyberpunk fiction.

===Anime===
* &quot;Cyber City Oedo 808&quot;
* &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, where ICE is referred to directly by name or else as an &#x27;Attack Barrier&#x27;.

===Cartoons===
* &quot;Phantom 2040&quot;, though in it &quot;ICE&quot; stands for &quot;Integrated Cyber Environment&quot;, referring to cyberspace, rather than Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics

===Card games===
* &quot;Netrunner&quot;, based on &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot; setting, where the corporate player uses ICE and the runner player uses icebreakers; while corps in &quot;Netrunner&quot; understand ICE to be an acronym for &quot;Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics&quot;, the runner viewpoint is that the acronym should be for &quot;Insidious Cortical Electrocution&quot;
* &quot;&quot;, an adaptation of the original &quot;Netrunner&quot; for the &quot;Android&quot; setting
* &quot;Hacker&quot; and &quot;Hacker II - The Dark Side&quot;, where the players attempt to gain illicit access systems represented by playing cards arranged in a network while avoiding getting zapped by ICE and Black ICE.

===Literature===
* &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, original popularizer of the term
* &quot;Count Zero&quot; the second novel of William Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Sprawl trilogy&quot;
* &quot;Hyperion&quot;, wherein black ICE is used to defend the TechnoCore
* &quot;Trouble and Her Friends&quot; by Melissa Scott, wherein IC(E) refers to Intrusion Countermeasures (Electronic), solving the problem of implying that the measures are hardware-based

===Roleplaying games===
* &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot;, upon which the &quot;Netrunner&quot; card game is based
* &quot;GURPS Cyberpunk&quot;
* &quot;Shadowrun&quot;, called IC (The setting drops the &quot;electronics&quot; misnomer) but is colloquially named &quot;Ice&quot; by hackers in the setting
* &quot;Shadow of the Beanstalk&quot;, a roleplaying game based on &quot;Android&quot; universe

===Movies===
* &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;, mentioned in the opening crawl.
* &quot;Track Down&quot;, wherein a friend of Kevin Mitnick says in a club that he is the hacker known as &quot;IceBreaker&quot;

===Television===
* &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, in the episode &quot;Born to the Purple&quot;
* &quot;Max Headroom&quot;, in the episode &quot;Security Systems&quot;, April 21, 1987

===Video games===
* &quot;Anarchy Online&quot; features an item called &quot;Hacker ICE-Breaker Source&quot;, which can be further upgraded to &quot;Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics Upgrade&quot;.
*Baldr Sky uses the term to describe the technology protecting the characters&#x27; &quot;brain chips&quot; and virtual structures.
* &quot;BloodNet&quot; uses the term to describe the technology the player must overcome when hacking a computer system.
* &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot; uses the term to refer to defensive countermeasures that prevent netrunners and cyberware from hacking a target.
* &quot;Deus Ex&quot;, where the player&#x27;s hacking program is referred to as an &quot;ICE Breaker&quot;
* &quot;Dystopia&quot;, wherein there are security programs called &quot;ICE walls&quot;
* &quot;Fallout 4&quot; uses &quot;Black Ice&quot; as a construction material during a cyberspace hacking minigame in the Far Harbor DLC.
* &quot;Mr. Robot&quot;, where &quot;ICE&quot; in its RPG part refers to shields or armor that can be attacked by various &quot;ICE breaker&quot;s
* &quot;Midnight Protocol&quot;, where &quot;ICE&quot; is an umbrella term for security measures that shield nodes from being accessed
* &quot;Neuromancer,&quot; where ICE, BlackICE, and ICE Breaking are highly featured.
* &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot;, where players use ICE technology to bypass security.
* &quot;Project Snowblind&quot;, features an ICE pick, to hack enemy cameras, turrets, and robots and use them against enemy forces.
* &quot;Ripper&quot; has the player break into various cyberspace systems, which involves fighting the &quot;ICE&quot; security programs in the form of a rail shooter.
* &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot;, an item called &quot;ICE Breaker&quot; can be obtained and used as a hacking tool during a sequence on the Leviathan, in which the player chooses one character to remain behind and attempt to rescue the other captured party members.
* &quot;StarCrawlers&quot; features an ability called Black Ice, which the Hacker character may use.
* &quot;System Shock&quot;, where ICE is represented in cyberspace as both autonomous security programs and ICE protection attached to data or software objects appearing as blue crystal formations.

<text>John Peter Petrucci (born July 12, 1967) is an American guitarist, best known as a founding member of progressive metal band Dream Theater. He produced or co-produced (often with Mike Portnoy before Portnoy&#x27;s absence from the band 2010-2023) all of Dream Theater&#x27;s albums from &quot;Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory&quot; (1999), and has been the sole producer of the band&#x27;s albums released since &quot;A Dramatic Turn of Events&quot; (2011). Petrucci has also released two solo albums: &quot;Suspended Animation&quot; (2005) and &quot;Terminal Velocity&quot; (2020).

==Early life and influences==
John Peter Petrucci was born on July 12, 1967, in Kings Park, New York, to an Italian American family. He picked up the guitar at around the age of eight because his older sister was allowed to go to bed later to practice the organ. However, he decided to quit the guitar when his attempts to stay up late were unsuccessful. He picked up the guitar again at the age of 12. Petrucci has said he committed to practicing guitar six hours a day when he discovered it was his passion. His early influences were bands like Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, AC/DC, and later developed an interest in progressive rock and heavy metal, exemplified by Rush, Yes, Iron Maiden, Dixie Dregs and Metallica. His other influences as a guitarist include Jimmy Page, Brian May, Eddie Van Halen, Steve Morse, Al Di Meola, Steve Howe, Allan Holdsworth, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Randy Rhoads, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Alex Lifeson, Yngwie Malmsteen and David Gilmour.

==Career==
Eventually, his childhood friend and future Dream Theater keyboardist Kevin Moore invited Petrucci to join his cover band. Petrucci attended Berklee College of Music in Boston with childhood friend John Myung (bass), where they met future bandmate Mike Portnoy (drums). While in Berklee they often covered two of their biggest influences, Iron Maiden and Rush. These three, in addition to Kevin Moore, formed the band Majesty. Because there was already another band with the same name, the group later became Dream Theater.

While Petrucci is most commonly associated with Dream Theater, he is also in the project band Liquid Tension Experiment, and has appeared as a guest on records by other artists, such as the &quot;Age of Impact&quot; album by the Explorer&#x27;s Club.

Petrucci has released a guitar instructional video, &quot;Rock Discipline&quot;, which covers warm-up exercises, exercises to avoid injury while playing, alternate picking, sweep picking, chords and other techniques for developing one&#x27;s guitar playing. Petrucci also has a book named &quot;Guitar World presents John Petrucci&#x27;s Wild Stringdom&quot;, which was compiled from columns he wrote for Guitar World magazine under that title.

In 2001, Joe Satriani and Steve Vai invited Petrucci to tour with them on the popular G3 guitar tour, which exposed him to a massive number of new fans and inspired a solo album. The album, &quot;Suspended Animation&quot;, was released on March 1, 2005, and was available for order from his web site. Petrucci also appeared on the 2005 and 2006 G3 tours, and in 2007, went on G3 tour again, this time with Paul Gilbert and Joe Satriani. In a video with Larry DiMarzio, Petrucci announced that he is working on a follow-up to his 2005 album, &quot;Suspended Animation&quot; and a new Dream Theater album.

Petrucci also wrote and recorded two instrumental soundtrack songs for a Sega Saturn game titled &quot;Digital Pinball: Necronomicon&quot;. Each track is roughly two minutes long, and are named simply &quot;Prologue&quot; and &quot;Epilogue&quot;. In a spoof rock band, Nightmare Cinema (which was the Dream Theater members changing instruments for encores), he used the &quot;alternate stage name&quot; Johnny James.

In 2012, Petrucci was invited once again to join Joe Satriani on the G3 tour, along with Steve Morse. He was accompanied by bassist Dave LaRue and drummer and Dream Theater bandmate Mike Mangini.

In 2018, Petrucci joined Joe Satriani on the G3 tour. They were accompanied by Uli Jon Roth on the European leg of the tour, and Phil Collen in North America. His second solo album, titled &quot;Terminal Velocity&quot; was released in 2020. Petrucci&#x27;s first solo album in 15 years, it reunited him with Mike Portnoy for the first time since the drummer left Dream Theater in 2010.

==Musical style==
===Guitar technique===

Petrucci is respected for his variety of guitar styles and skills. One of the most notable of these is his high-speed alternate picking which, as he himself claims, requires a &quot;strong sense of synchronization between the two [playing] hands.&quot; He is notable for frequent use of the seven-string electric guitar, which he says he uses as a writing tool, taking advantage of the extended range for heavier riffing and to play extended range runs as part of a solo. Moreover, Petrucci often combines his metal shredding technique with a slower, emotive soloing style.

===Lyrics===
Petrucci is Dream Theater&#x27;s most prolific lyricist, with each album including at least three songs featuring his lyrics. Some of Petrucci&#x27;s notable songs include &quot;Metropolis, Pt. 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper&quot;, &quot;The Spirit Carries On&quot;, &quot;The Great Debate&quot;, &quot;In the Presence of Enemies&quot;, and &quot;Through Her Eyes&quot;. Petrucci has occasionally used real-life experiences for lyrical inspiration, as heard in songs such as &quot;The Count of Tuscany&quot;, &quot;A Nightmare to Remember&quot; and &quot;Endless Sacrifice&quot;.

===Singing===
Petrucci has acted as a backing vocalist live since the &quot;Awake&quot; Tour. He is a baritone, producing a sound darker than that of James LaBrie&#x27;s tenor voice. He has also written vocal melodies for Dream Theater. Petrucci&#x27;s role as a vocalist expanded following the departure of Mike Portnoy, who had been Dream Theater&#x27;s primary backing vocalist and occasionally even shared lead vocals with LaBrie. In live performances, Petrucci now replicates some vocal parts originally sung by Portnoy, with others being recorded samples.

==Accolades and praise==
Regarded as &quot;one of the most celebrated guitarists alive&quot; by Premier Guitar, Petrucci has performed as the third guitarist on the G3 tour seven times, more than any other invited guitarist. In their article &quot;John Petrucci: The Ultimate Evolved Guitarist&quot;, Premier Guitar calls Petrucci &quot;one of the best who&#x27;s ever laid a hand on a fretboard&quot;. He was voted &quot;Best Prog guitarist&quot; by &quot;The Prog Magazine&quot; and the &quot;Greatest Guitarist&quot; by &quot;Burrn&quot; magazine and Mariskalrock. &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine lists Petrucci among the &quot;Fastest Guitarists of All Time&quot; and calls him &quot;the most celebrated and popular guitarist in the world of progressive metal&quot; and &quot;arguably the most versatile and proficient player in his realm, with a highly developed melodic sense and an alternate picking technique that is virtually untouchable as far as speed and precision&quot;, while also ranking him among the top 5 &quot;Best Guitarists of the Decade&quot;.

In 2019, Petrucci won the SENA Performers European Award. Joel McIver&#x27;s 2009 book &quot;The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists&quot; ranks Petrucci second, after Dave Mustaine. He was also named as one of the &quot;Top 10 Greatest Guitar Shredders of All Time&quot; by &quot;GuitarOne&quot; magazine. In 2012, Petrucci was ranked the 17th greatest guitarist of all time by a &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine reader&#x27;s poll. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, the Ernie Ball-Music Man John Petrucci JP6 is the second-best-selling signature model of all time, behind only the Gibson Les Paul.

== Equipment ==
Petrucci is a long-time user of Music Man JP and Majesty series guitars and Mesa/Boogie amplifiers. While his pedalboard, controller, effects and overdrives have undergone changes over the years, the core of Petrucci&#x27;s guitar sound remains DiMarzio pickups and Mesa/Boogie amplifiers. Most recently the signature JP-2C amplifier based on the Mark IIC+ series and other Mark and Rectifier series amplifiers, such as during the recording of &quot;Train of Thought&quot;.

A number of brands have released signature guitar equipment designed or endorsed by Petrucci: 
* Ibanez released the first John Petrucci signature guitars, made from 1995 to 1999
* DiMarzio have produced several pickups designed in collaboration with Petrucci, and released a signature guitar strap bearing his emblem.
* Ernie Ball Music Man (USA) began producing John Petrucci signature guitars in 2001 and have made numerous models bearing his name since.
* Dunlop produce John Petrucci signature guitar picks including the Jazz III and flow
* TC Electronic released the Dreamscape John Petrucci signature modulation pedal in 2013.

At the beginning of 2016 two new releases were announced: the Dunlop John Petrucci signature Cry-Baby wah, and the Mesa/Boogie JP-2C John Petrucci head. The latter is a three-channel amplifier, which is available both as a stand-alone amp head and as a rack-mounted amp head. It differs from other Mesa/Boogie Mark series amps in that it features two separate graphic EQs, an exclusive &quot;Shred&quot; circuit, midi connection and CabClone direct out, resulting in increased versatility.

== Personal life ==
Petrucci lives in St. James, New York, with his wife Rena Sands, a guitarist in the all-female heavy metal band Meanstreak, and they have three children. Sands is the aunt of Jake Bowen, a guitarist in the progressive metal band Periphery.

Petrucci is an avid fan of bodybuilding and dedicates much of his off time to weight training. He is a voting member of The Recording Academy.

Dream Theater bandmate Jordan Rudess revealed in an interview that Petrucci is a practicing Catholic. Petrucci also spoke about his faith in a Dream Theater Q&amp;A with DreamTheaterForums and in an interview with Mark Small from &quot;Berklee Today&quot; magazine.

<doc id="762160" wikidata="Q5595682" url="?curid=762160" title="Jack Barnes (politician)">
<text>Jack Barnes (born 1940) is an American communist and the National Secretary of the Socialist Workers Party. Barnes was elected the party&#x27;s national secretary in 1972, replacing the retiring Farrell Dobbs. He joined the SWP in the early 1960s as a student at Carleton College in Minnesota and quickly became a leading member of the party&#x27;s youth wing. From the 1990s to the present, Barnes has directed his party to support the governments of North Korea and Equatorial Guinea; has instructed the party to abstain from antiwar or anti-racist activism; and in January 2016 lent his support to the occupation of federal lands, in Oregon, by militia movement members.
Barnes was a key advocate of the party&#x27;s &quot;turn to industry&quot; in the 1970s, its exit from the Fourth International in the 1980s and its orientation towards the Cuban Communist Party in the 1990s.

==Turn to Industry==
Barnes was one of the central organizers for the idea that the party should &quot;turn to industry&quot;. In 1978 the party&#x27;s National Committee approved a report by Barnes which argued that &quot;we must subordinate everything else to immediately organizing to get a large majority of the membership of the SWP into industry and the industrial trade unions&quot;. SWP members took up union jobs in basic industries such as meatpacking, steel, mining and textile industries. 

Work within these industries became a condition of membership in the SWP, as the party attempted to penetrate the portions of the working class that it feels will be most combative and open to communist ideas in the future: those unionized in basic industries. Party members organized within these unions form factions within the party. The SWP asserts that this course follows the continuity of the communist movement from Marx and Engels to Lenin&#x27;s time, which stresses a party based in the working class.
Despite its dwindling membership, SWP members continue to take low-paying jobs, while following the SWP&#x27;s guidance to avoid any agitation for union organizing, but to confine their activities to sales of SWP publications. Although leading the &quot;turn to industry&quot; in the 1970s, Barnes never worked in any wage-earning occupation. One former SWP member recalled that Barnes was unfamiliar with concepts or phrases such as &quot;punching the time clock&quot; or &quot;overtime pay.&quot;

==Break with FI and Permanent Revolution==
Barnes&#x27;s article &quot;Their Trotsky and Ours&quot; also underpinned the party&#x27;s decisions in the 1980s to abandon its support for Leon Trotsky&#x27;s theory of Permanent Revolution, and its withdrawal from the world Trotskyist movement and the reunified Fourth International. Barnes repudiated the traditional Trotskyist understanding of Permanent Revolution in favor of Lenin&#x27;s pre-World War I position of &quot;democratic-dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry&quot;, and a highly sympathetic view of the governments of Cuba, Nicaragua and Grenada. 

The change prefaced the expulsion of more than a third of the party&#x27;s members in 1983 and 1984, and was regarded by the opposition as a complete break with the party&#x27;s traditions. As national secretary, Barnes played a key role in the expulsion those who supported the USFI. In 1990, he wrote on behalf of the SWP to withdraw it from close relations with the Fourth International and to recognize the reality that it was now part of a &quot;Pathfinder tendency&quot; consisting of the SWP and several Communist Leagues in other countries.

==Orientation to the Cuban CP==
Barnes has encouraged the SWP&#x27;s growing interest in the Cuban Communist Party. In the 1960s he was a leader of the Fair Play for Cuba movement. This interest continues, and he wrote a 2001 book titled &quot;Cuba and the Coming American Revolution&quot;. The SWP views the Cuban Revolution and the Cuban Communist Party more sympathetically than do some other currents of the Trotskyist tradition, stressing the alleged vanguard role of Cuba&#x27;s foreign policy and what socialists can learn from Cuba about building a socialist society.

<text>The British Legion was an elite British provincial regiment established during the American Revolutionary War, composed of Loyalist American troops, organized as infantry and cavalry, plus a detachment from the 16th Light Dragoons. The unit was commonly known as Tarleton&#x27;s Legion, after the British officer who led it on campaign, Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton. It was a unit the size of a regiment, consisting of artillery, cavalry, and light infantry, and able to operate independently.

==Regiment formed==
This unit was raised in New York in July 1778 by Sir Henry Clinton in order to merge several small Loyalist units into a single force, a &quot;legion&quot; that combined infantry and cavalry forces and a battery of &quot;flying&quot; (light and fast moving) artillery. The infantry consisted of the Caledonian Volunteers, a partially mounted and partially foot unit raised in Philadelphia in late 1777 and early 1778, Ritzema&#x27;s Royal American Reformers, the West Jersey Volunteers, and some members of the Roman Catholic Volunteers. The cavalry combined, in whole or in part, elements of Captain Kinloch&#x27;s independent troop of New York Dragoons, the Philadelphia Light Dragoons, Emmerich&#x27;s Chasseurs, the Prince of Wales&#x27; American Volunteers, and the 16th Light Dragoons. The regiment was commanded by Lord Cathart, as colonel; Banastre Tarleton was commissioned as lieutenant colonel. Once the unit left New York, Tarleton took full operational command. The Legion&#x27;s peak operational strength was approximately 250 cavalry and 200 infantry.

==The Legion in the Carolinas campaign==
Elements of the Legion fought at the Siege of Savannah in 1779. The Legion as a whole was part of the British force that besieged and captured Charleston in 1780. The regiment participated in many battles in Clinton&#x27;s South Carolina campaign, defeating General Isaac Huger and Lieutenant Colonel William Washington at Monck&#x27;s Corner, dispersing another American force at Lenud&#x27;s Ferry, and routing an American column under Colonel Abraham Buford at the Battle of Waxhaws.

During 1780, the Legion received reinforcements in the form of more drafts from Emmerich&#x27;s Chasseurs and the Prince of Wales&#x27; American Volunteers and the permanent attachment of the Bucks County Dragoons.

After Lord Cornwallis took command of the southern Crown forces, the Legion participated in his defeat of General Horatio Gates at the Battle of Camden, nearly caught Thomas Sumter at Fishing Creek, were hit by a surprise attack at Wahab&#x27;s Plantation, and was pinned by a rebel force at Charlotte, until the remainder of the British force could come up.

Throughout the autumn of 1780, the British Legion took part in anti-guerrilla operations, attempting to hunt down Francis Marion and Thomas Sumter and engaging in combat at Fishdam Ford and Blackstock&#x27;s. The Legion seized and destroyed property in punitive attempts to suppress support for the guerrillas.

In January 1781, the Legion was part of the force under Tarleton defeated by Daniel Morgan at the Battle of Cowpens. The regiment suffered heavily in this action, particularly its infantry arm. After Cowpens, the remaining Legion infantry either transferred to the cavalry or joined the garrison of Charleston. From this point forward, the active British Legion was a cavalry force only.

After regrouping, the regiment led Cornwallis&#x27; movement into North Carolina in search of the American army under Nathanael Greene, seeing action at Cowan&#x27;s Ford and Tarrant&#x27;s Tavern.

The Legion was taken onto the American Establishment on March 7, 1781, as the 5th American Regiment. This made them an official part of the British Army, rather than provincial (local) troops.

On 15 March, the regiment fought at the Battle of Guilford Court House.

==The Legion in the Virginia campaign==
As Cornwallis shifted his communications to the Chesapeake and abandoned the Carolinas for Virginia, the British Legion cavalry under Tarleton raided ahead of the British army, nearly capturing Virginia Governor Thomas Jefferson and the Virginia General Assembly at Charlottesville. The Legion again engaged in widespread destruction to punish rebel sympathizers and deny material support to the Continental Army and government.

After Cornwallis occupied Yorktown, the Legion moved across the York River to Gloucester on 2 October. They later fought a skirmish with French troops there and surrendered to the French at the conclusion of the siege. Lord Cornwallis sought terms of surrender that would have ensured no reprisals against the Loyalists in his army, but Washington refused to agree to them. Some of the men of the Legion were evacuated, sent with Cornwallis&#x27; dispatches to New York after the surrender. Some officers were paroled. Some enlisted men, and at least four officers who volunteered to stay with their troopers, were sent to a prison camp in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

==Regiment disbanded and resettled in British Canada==
On December 25, 1782, the regiment was taken onto the British establishment, suggesting that there may have been some thought to maintain the regiment as part of the postwar army. The infantry of the Legion still in Charleston, and such of the regiment as had escaped to New York, were eventually evacuated to Nova Scotia in 1783. Some officers transferred to other regiments of the British Army. The British Legion was disbanded on October 10, 1783. Most of those discharged settled in Nova Scotia.

==Legacy==
Thomas Raddall, the prolific, award-winning writer on historical subjects, said of the British Legion:
American Oscar E. Gilbert, who has written much about tanks of the US Marine Corps, provides some of that invective:

<doc id="762183" wikidata="Q1423411" url="?curid=762183" title="XXX (ZZ Top album)">
<text>XXX is the thirteenth studio album (also including live material) by the American rock band ZZ Top, released in September 1999. The album&#x27;s title commemorates the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary.

==Reception==
AllMusic only gave the album one and a half stars, and in its review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine, he states: &quot;After all, countless blues-based musicians, from Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins and Muddy Waters to B.B. King and the Rolling Stones, have aged gracefully, albeit in varying degrees. So why does ZZ Top sound so stiff and useless on &quot;XXX&quot;, a record celebrating their 30th anniversary? Part of that could be that the songwriting is decidedly weak, but a band as seasoned as ZZ Top should be able to make third-rate material at least listenable.&quot;

A more positive review was posted by &quot;RoughEdge.com&quot;, whose reviewer R. Scott Bolton gave it three out of four guitars and stated that the album &quot;represents the best of both worlds of ZZ Top [...] [t]he bluesy sounds that highlight their early years [and] the special effects and tricks that made their later recordings so popular&quot;.

The album peaked at number 100 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

<doc id="762184" wikidata="Q1655266" url="?curid=762184" title="Dillingham Airfield">
<text>Dillingham Airfield is a public and military use airport located two nautical miles (4 km) west of the central business district of Mokulēia, in Honolulu County on the North Shore of Oahu in the U.S. state of Hawaii. It is operated by the Hawaii Department of Transportation under a 50-year lease from the United States Army. The airport is primarily used for gliding and sky diving operations, and also houses Civil Air Patrol (CAP) glider aircraft. Military operations consist largely of night operations for night vision device training and orientation flights for the United States Air Force Auxiliary (CAP). This airport is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021, in which it is categorized as a basic general aviation facility.

==History==
A communications station called Camp Kawaihapai was established here in 1922 on along the Oahu Railway and Land Company line.
In the 1920s and 1930s, the railroad transported mobile coast artillery to the site.
By 1941, the Army leased additional land and established Mokulēia Airstrip. Curtiss P-40 fighters were deployed at North Shore airstrips at Kahuku, Haleiwa and Mokulēia when the attack on Pearl Harbor took place. Aircraft taking off from nearby Haleiwa destroyed several attacking aircraft.

The runway was paved, extended to long, and a crosswind runway added from 1942 to 1945. By the end of World War II, Mokulēia Airfield could handle B-29 Superfortress bombers. In 1946, the Army acquired an additional .
In 1948, the airfield was inactivated and renamed Dillingham Air Force Base in memory of Captain Henry Gaylord Dillingham, a B-29 airman who was killed in action over Kawasaki, Japan on July 25, 1945. Captain Dillingham was the son of Walter F. Dillingham and grandson of Benjamin Dillingham who founded the railroad which evolved into Hawaiian Dredging Company and the Dillingham Corporation.

Nike missiles were installed in the 1950s, but were obsolete by 1970.

In 1962, the State of Hawaii leased Dillingham for general aviation use. In the 1970s the base was transferred from the Air Force back to the Army. The state signed new leases with the Army in 1974, 1983, 2000 and 2024. In the 1980s, hangars, a control tower, and a fire station were built.

== Facilities and aircraft ==
Dillingham Airfield covers an area of 134 acres (54 ha) at an elevation of 14.2 feet (4.3 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 8/26 with an asphalt surface measuring 9,007 by 75 feet (2,745 x 23 m).

As a general aviation joint-use facility, the airfield has one runway, a UNICOM tower, powered aircraft and glider hangars, and a tie down area for recreation aircraft. Jet-A and Avgas are available in a self-serve facility utilizing credit cards for payment. There were plans to extend the taxiway to the end of the 26 runway, but funding was delayed. Air traffic, unless approved prior by the US Army, is limited to daytime operations by general aviation and sport parachuting operations.

For the 12-month period ending June 30, 2015, the airport had 103 operators a day: 96% general aviation and 4% military. At that time there were 47 aircraft based at this airport: 24 single-engine, 20 glider, 1 helicopter, and 2 ultralight.

==Authority==
Dillingham Airfield is part of a centralized state structure governing all of the airports and seaports of Hawaii. The official authority of Dillingham Airfield is the Governor of Hawaii. The governor appoints the Director of the Hawaii State Department of Transportation who has jurisdiction over the Hawaii Airports Administrator.

The Hawaii Airports Administrator oversees six governing bodies: Airports Operations Office, Airports Planning Office, Engineering Branch, Information Technology Office, Staff Services Office, Visitor Information Program Office. Collectively, the six bodies have authority over the four airport districts in Hawaii: Hawaii District, Kauai District, Maui District and the principal Oahu District. Dillingham Airfield is a subordinate of the Oahu District officials.

==Filming location==
The television series Lost filmed several scenes at Dillingham Airfield, due to its remote location close to the North Shore, where the series was primarily filmed.
The fuselage from the fictional Oceanic Airlines flight 815 is also stored at Dillingham, and was transported to the beach when needed for filming.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On June 21, 2019, a Beechcraft King Air operated by the Oahu Parachute Center crashed at Dillingham Airfield while taking off for a sunset skydiving flight, killing all 11 people on board.

<text>Hana Airport is a regional public use airport of the State of Hawaii on the east shore of the island of Maui, northwest of the unincorporated town of Hana. The airport was officially opened on November 11, 1950. It is primarily a commuter facility used by unscheduled air taxis and general aviation. As air traffic increases, the Hawaii State Legislature will consider future improvements including the construction of a taxiway paralleling the runway, widening of access roads and expansion of passenger terminals and parking facilities.

Scheduled commercial airline service provided Pacific Wings was subsidized by the Essential Air Service program until April 1, 2007, when Pacific Wings began providing subsidy-free service; however, with fares as high as $200 each way, most travelers opted to drive rather than fly. According to U.S. Department of Transportation data, Pacific Wings transported only 375 passengers in the first 10 months of 2012, while Mokulele Airlines claims to have transported 1706 passengers since October 2012, according to their EAS bid for Kamuela service on May 23, 2013.

It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2021–2025, in which it is categorized as a basic general aviation facility.

== Facilities and aircraft ==

Hana Airport covers an area of 119 acres (48 ha) at an elevation of 78 feet (24 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 8/26 with an asphalt surface measuring 3,606 by 100 feet (1,099 x 30 m).

For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2014, the airport had 3,364 aircraft operations, an average of 9 per day: 58% air taxi, 42% general aviation and less than 1% military. In April 2022, there were 3 aircraft based at this airport: 2 gliders and 1 ultra-light.

== Airline and destination ==

The following airline provides scheduled passenger service:
=== Historical airline service ===

Hawaiian Airlines was serving Hana in 1969 with Convair 640 turboprop flights from Kahului and Honolulu. According to the Official Airline Guide (OAG), two commuter air carriers were serving the airport in 1976, Island Pacific Air and Royal Hawaiian Airways, with both airlines operating small Cessna 402 twin prop aircraft on direct flights from Honolulu, Kahului, Kaunakaki and Lanai City with Royal Hawaiian also providing direct service from Hilo, Kaanapali, Kamuela, Kona and Upolu Point. Island Pacific Air then changed its name to Air Hawaii and was continuing to serve the airport in 1979. Princeville Airways was serving Hana in 1986 with de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprops with flights to Honolulu, Kahului and other destinations in Hawaii. By 1994, Aloha IslandAir (which formerly operated as Princeville Airways and was subsequently renamed Island Air (Hawaii)) was operating code share service on behalf of Aloha Airlines with DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprops on direct flights from Honolulu, Kahului, Lanai City and Molokai/Hoolehua according to the OAG.

== Authority ==
Hana Airport is part of a centralized state structure governing all of the airports and seaports of Hawaii. The official authority of Hana Airport is the Governor of Hawaii. The governor appoints the Director of the Hawai&#x27;i State Department of Transportation who has jurisdiction over the Hawaii Airports Administrator.

The Hawaii Airports Administrator oversees six governing bodies: Airports Operations Office, Airports Planning Office, Engineering Branch, Information Technology Office, Staff Services Office, Visitor Information Program Office. Collectively, the six bodies have authority over the four airport districts in Hawaii: Hawai&#x27;i District, Kauai District, Maui District and the principal Oahu District. Hana Airport is a subordinate of the Maui District officials.

<text>Kalaupapa Airport is a regional public use airport of the state of Hawaii, located on the northern peninsula of the island of Molokai, north of Kalaupapa Settlement, in Kalawao County. Most flights to Kalaupapa originate from Molokai Airport or from airports on the other Hawaiian islands by unscheduled air taxis and general aviation. It is also used as a cargo facility carrying goods for Kalaupapa, which has no road access from the rest of Molokai.

The airport offered scheduled passenger service from Makani Kai Air, which began providing scheduled passenger service in January 2012, using two nine-seat Cessna Grand Caravans. This service was subsidized by the Essential Air Service (EAS) program until May 2018. Previously, Pacific Wings had provided scheduled passenger service at Kalaupapa; this was subsidized by the EAS program from 2000 until April 2007, when Pacific Wings began providing subsidy-free service. Pacific Wings ceased operations in Hawaii in 2013.

The scheduled service from Kalaupapa to Molokai Airport was among the shortest flights in the world.

It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2021–2025, in which it is categorized as a non-primary commercial service facility.

== Facilities and aircraft ==

Kalaupapa Airport covers an area of 55 acres (22 ha) at an elevation of 24 feet (7 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 5/23 with an asphalt surface measuring 2,700 by 75 feet (823 x 23 m).

Facilities include a small passenger terminal and airport support areas. The airport does not have a control tower. To comply with the wishes of the community and to minimize disturbance to the surrounding national park, no significant improvements are planned.

For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2016, the airport had 3,294 aircraft operations, an average of 9 per day: 73% air taxi, 18% general aviation and 9% military. In April 2022, there were no aircraft based at this airport.

<text>Kapalua Airport , also known as Kapalua–West Maui Airport, is a regional airport in the district of Mahinahina on the west side of Maui island in the state of Hawaii. It is located north of Lahaina, in Maui County. Most flights to Kapalua Airport originate from commuter airports on the other Hawaiian islands by commercial commuter services, unscheduled air taxis, and general aviation.

As per Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 52,328 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 42,416 enplanements in 2009, and 40,060 in 2010. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021, in which it is categorized as a general aviation facility.

== History ==
Named for the Kapalua Resort a few miles to the north, the airport replaced the Kaanapali Airport, which had an even shorter runway, in 1987 to allow valuable coastal land to be developed. The airport code name JHM stands for John Henry Magoon, who was president of Hawaiian Airlines when that airline developed the airport. Hawaiian operated de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7 turboprop aircraft on flights to Honolulu. The STOL capable, four engine, 50-passenger Dash 7 was the largest aircraft ever to operate scheduled passenger flights from the airport. Hawaiian discontinued service to Kapalua when the Dash 7 was retired from its fleet in 1994.

According to the Official Airline Guide (OAG), in late 1989 Hawaiian Airlines and Aloha Island Air were operating a combined total of up to 30 nonstop flights a day to Honolulu from Kapalua Airport, Hawaiian with Dash 7 aircraft and Aloha Island Air with de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprops with the latter air carrier operating its flights via a code sharing agreement with Aloha Airlines. In the spring of 1995, Aloha Island Air was the only airline operating nonstop service from Kapalua to Honolulu with 15 daily flights operated with DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft via its code sharing agreement with Aloha Airlines. By the spring of 1999, Aloha Island Air continued to be only airline operating nonstop service from the airport to Honolulu with eight daily flights operated with de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 turboprops via its code share with Aloha. Aloha Island Air subsequently changed its name to Island Air.

Mahalo Air, which operated between 1993 and 1997, also served Kapalua with flights to Honolulu using ATR 42 twin turboprop aircraft.

Island Air discontinued service to Kapalua on May 31, 2013, when it replaced its fleet of de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8s with ATR-72 propjets.

On November 2, 2016, Hawaiian Airlines announced they would resume service at Kapalua Airport beginning January 18, 2017 with flights to Honolulu and Kahului. Flights were to be operated by Hawaiian Air&#x27;s Ohana by Hawaiian subsidiary utilizing 48-seat ATR 42-500 twin turboprop aircraft.

On November 15, 2016, Hawaiian Airlines announced that it was temporarily suspending sales of its Honolulu to West Maui service pending securing a TSA presence at Kapalua Airport.

On January 11, 2017, Hawaiian Airlines announced they expect to resume service at Kapalua West Maui Airport by late March.

On January 27, 2017, Hawaiian Airlines resumed selling tickets to and from Kapalua West Maui Airport, with service beginning March 1, 2017.

On March 25, 2020, Hawaiian Airlines suspended service to and from Kapalua West Maui Airport as part of its systemwide reduction in service due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Facilities and aircraft ==

Kapalua Airport is governed by a special agreement made by the state with Maui County. A former, privately owned airport, major changes or improvements to Kapalua Airport cannot be made without the consent of the Maui County Council. The county insists on limiting development to preserve the Kapalua community from commercialization. Kapalua Airport is restricted to a single runway, a couple of terminal facilities and support facilities. There are no air cargo facilities, which causes all arriving air cargo (FedEx Feeder) to unload directly on the ramp, and load directly into delivery trucks which line up outside the ramp gate. Operations are restricted to daytime hours only. Passengers departing on Mokulele Airlines are not screened by the Transportation Security Administration.

There is a snack bar offering a variety of light snacks, meals, and beverages.

The airport covers an area of 50 acres (20 ha) at an elevation of 256 feet (78 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 2/20 with an asphalt surface measuring 3,000 by 100 feet (914 x 30 m). For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2004, the airport had 9,990 aircraft operations, an average of 27 per day: 51% scheduled commercial and 49% air taxi.

<text>Hilo International Airport , formerly General Lyman Field, is a regional airport located in Hilo, Hawaiʻi, United States. Owned and operated by the Hawaii Department of Transportation, the airport serves windward (eastern) Hawaiʻi island including the districts of Hilo, Hāmākua and Kaʻū, and Puna. It is one of two international airports serving Hawaiʻi island, the other being Kona International Airport on the leeward (western) side.

Although named an international airport, most flights operate between either Honolulu International Airport on Oahu or Kahului Airport on Maui. The airport encompasses of land.

It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2021–2025, in which it is categorized as a small-hub primary commercial service facility.

== History ==

=== Initial development ===
In 1927 the Territory of Hawaii legislature passed Act 257, authorizing the expenditure of $25,000 for the construction of a landing strip in Hilo. The site was known as Keaukaha, on land belonging to the Hawaiian Homes Commission. Inmates from a nearby prison camp cleared the area of brush and rocks. The new facility was dedicated on February 11, 1928, by Major Clarence M. Young, then Secretary of Aeronautics of the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Sixteen months after the dedication, scheduled inter-island service began on November 11, 1929, by Inter-Island Airways, the forerunner of Hawaiian Airlines. For $32, travelers could climb aboard an eight-passenger Sikorsky S-38 on thrice-weekly flights between Hilo and Honolulu. Five years later, in 1934, the company was awarded the right to carry air mail for the U.S. Postal Service.

=== Early expansion ===
Improvements to Hilo&#x27;s airfield were minimal during its first decade. Between 1927 and 1937, just over $34,000 was spent in developing the site. Over the next five years, however, the Works Progress Administration spent $261,613 to upgrade the airport. An additional $314,000 was provided by the Civil Aeronautics Administration in 1941.

During martial law in the territory following the attack on Pearl Harbor, all airports in the Hawaiian Islands came under the control of the U.S. military. The Army Engineers continued to expand the airport. In addition to military facilities to support an Air Corp fighter squadron at Hilo, the Army expanded and improved runways, taxiways and aprons. On April 19, 1943, the Territorial Legislature renamed Hilo Airport &quot;General Lyman Field&quot;, for General Albert Kualiʻi Brickwood Lyman (1885–1942), the first U.S. General of Hawaiian ancestry. He was one of three sons of Rufus Anderson Lyman to attend the United States Military Academy.

The end of the war did not immediately bring about a return to civilian control of General Lyman Field. Although ownership of the airport was returned to the territory in September 1946, the Air Force leased the facilities and retained operational control of its tower for over three years after Japan&#x27;s surrender. Meanwhile, Trans-Pacific Airlines, later renamed Aloha Airlines, commenced inter-island flights on July 26, 1946. On April 8, 1952, the territory assumed full control, paving the way for another round of expansion.

A groundbreaking ceremony for a new terminal building was held on July 17, 1952. At the same time, new high intensity lights were installed on Runway 8–26. Plans included a new freight terminal, aprons, parking areas and roads. The airport&#x27;s new passenger terminal was completed and dedicated on December 5, 1953, and its freight terminal in June 1954.

=== Overseas growth ===
During the late 1950s, Territorial leaders anticipated a boom in tourism, prompting plans for a second runway capable of accommodating large jet aircraft. The Hawaiʻi Aeronautics Commission recommended that General Lyman Field be expanded for overseas flights. In April 1958, the territory acquired on the eastern edge of the airport for a longer runway to enable non-stop flights to the west coast of the United States. The first phase was completed by April 1963 and the runway was dedicated on March 6, 1965. Interisland jet service from Honolulu and Maui was introduced by Aloha Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines during the mid-1960s. According to their respective system timetables at the time, in 1966 Aloha was serving Hilo with British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven jets as well as with Fairchild F-27 and Vickers Viscount turboprops while Hawaiian was serving the airport with Douglas DC-9-10 jets and also with Convair 640 turboprops. In April 1967 the state finished new taxiways and aprons, finally allowing the airport to receive overseas flights. On October 1, 1967, United Airlines Douglas DC-8 jets and Pan American World Airways Boeing 707 jets initiated nonstop flights from San Francisco (SFO) and Los Angeles (LAX).

Work began on an interim overseas terminal at General Lyman Field in November 1968. With a price tag of $775,000, this facility was designed for the burgeoning number of overseas passengers until a new terminal complex could be built. It was dedicated on July 4, 1969. The following year, Governor John Burns appointed the Hilo Airport Advisory Committee to make recommendations on long-term development of the airport. They suggested relocating terminals from the western edge of Runway 3–21 to the south of the newly lengthened Runway 8-26. The new terminal was designed for the largest passenger airliner in service: the Boeing 747. The airlines, however, did not wait until the new terminal was built; on February 6, 1971, the first jumbo jet landed: a 747 operated by Braniff International Airways.

Groundbreaking for a new terminal was held in July 1974. Construction of the terminal was done in two phases. The first was completed in 1975 and work immediately commenced on phase two. On April 30, 1976, officials dedicated the new, much more modern facility. In order to better serve the airport and its lengthened runway, the FAA opened a new, taller air traffic control tower on November 2, 1979.

=== Overseas retrenchment ===
The introduction of overseas service to General Lyman Field initially met with success. Joining United Airlines and Pan American World Airways in providing nonstop and direct service to Hilo from the west coast and other locations in the U.S. were Braniff International Airways, Continental Airlines, Northwest Airlines and Western Airlines. In 1968, Northwest was operating Boeing 707-320C jet service nonstop to Hilo from Seattle (SEA) twice a week with this flight also providing direct, no change of plane service from New York JFK Airport (JFK), Philadelphia (PHL), Cleveland (CLE) and Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport (ORD). In 1969, United was operating daily nonstop flights from Los Angeles (LAX) and San Francisco (SFO) with Douglas DC-8 jets including stretched Super DC-8-61 jetliners with direct, no change of plane Super DC-8 service being flown daily to Hilo from Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport (ORD) and Boston (BOS) via LAX while Pan American (Pan Am) was flying daily nonstop Boeing 707 service from Los Angeles (LAX) with 707 flights also being operated three days a week nonstop from San Francisco (SFO) and two days a week nonstop from Seattle (SEA) with this latter flight originating at Portland (PDX). Also in 1969, Braniff was operating Boeing 707-320 jet service with weekly nonstop flights from Dallas Love Field (DAL), Houston Hobby Airport (HOU) and St. Louis (STL) with the airline also operating direct one-stop 707 service once a week to Hilo from Atlanta (ATL), Miami (MIA) and New Orleans (MSY). By 1971, Continental was flying Boeing 707-320C jetliners nonstop from Los Angeles (LAX) with direct, no change of plane 707 service being operated from Denver (DEN), Kansas City (MCI), Portland (PDX) and Seattle (SEA) with flights from PDX and SEA making an intermediate stop in Honolulu.

The number of overseas passengers flying through Hilo peaked at 313,428 in 1971 and remained between 250,000 and 300,000 for most of the decade. According to the Official Airline Guide (OAG), in 1975 Northwest, United and Western were continuing to serve Hilo. At this time, Northwest was flying nonstop Boeing 747 service once a week from Portland (PDX) with this flight originating in Seattle (SEA), United was operating daily Boeing 747 service nonstop from Los Angeles (LAX) as well as nonstop Douglas DC-8 flights from San Francisco (SFO) five days a week while Western was flying Boeing 720B service nonstop from Los Angeles (LAX) twice a week. A year later in 1976, Continental was once again serving Hilo with a daily direct McDonnell Douglas DC-10 flight from Denver (DEN) and Los Angeles (LAX) with this service making an intermediate stop in Honolulu while at this same time United was operating a Douglas DC-8 flight four days a week with a westbound routing of New York Newark Airport (EWR) – Cleveland (CLE) – San Francisco (SFO) – Hilo (ITO) in addition to operating daily nonstop Boeing 747 service from Los Angeles (LAX).

Beginning in 1979, however, overseas passenger traffic began to fall steadily, leading one carrier after another to suspend service to Hilo. The OAG lists only two air carriers operating nonstop service from the U.S. mainland to Hilo in 1979: United operating daily McDonnell Douglas DC-10 flights with one nonstop flight a day from both Los Angeles (LAX) and San Francisco (SFO), and Western operating nonstop DC-10 service once a week from LAX. In early 1985, United was operating just one departure a day from Hilo: a daily nonstop to Los Angeles (LAX) flown with a stretched Super DC-8. Also by the mid-1980s, overseas traffic had fallen by such an extent that United Airlines, the sole remaining overseas carrier, terminated scheduled service on December 1, 1986. The number of overseas passengers traveling to Hilo had declined in each of the previous eight years. During the first eleven months of 1986, United Airlines had served a mere 20,914 passengers in Hilo. Hilo would be left without nonstop service to North America for nearly two decades.

At the same time, the state&#x27;s other major airports added overseas service. United Airlines commenced service to Kahului Airport on January 5, 1983, followed by service to Kona International Airport on September 7 and finally to Līhuʻe Airport in August 1984. Hilo struggled to attract another overseas air carrier. Meantime, in the summer of 1983 there were three airlines operating nonstop service on the interisland route between Hilo and Honolulu including Aloha Airlines with Boeing 737-200 jets, Hawaiian Airlines with McDonnell Douglas DC-9-50 jets and de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7 turboprops, and Mid Pacific Air with NAMC YS-11 turboprops with the three air carriers operating a combined total of seventeen daily nonstop flights at this time from Hilo to Honolulu according to the OAG. Mid Pacific Air later introduced Fokker F28 Fellowship jets on its nonstop flights to Honolulu.

In May 1989, the state Legislature renamed General Lyman Field to &quot;Hilo International Airport&quot;. Among the reasons given was to reorient the airport&#x27;s image and to &quot;conform to the practice of naming airports for their geographical locations&quot;.
The main terminal kept the Lyman name.

Efforts finally had some success on April 28, 2006, when ATA Airlines re-established daily non-stop service between Hilo and Oakland International Airport in California aboard its Boeing 737-800 aircraft. ATA Airlines&#x27; inauguration of direct overseas service to Hilo for the first time in nearly two decades was met with great fanfare and proved so successful the airline eventually substituted the larger Boeing 757-200 on its flights to Hilo during the peak traveling season around August. Just shy of two years later on April 2, 2008, ATA Airlines ceased operations, citing the cancellation of an agreement by FedEx that provided most of the company&#x27;s charter flights, and the unprecedented increase in fuel prices. ATA was acquired by U.S. carrier Southwest Airlines, which did not operate any overseas routes at the time. Southwest then announced their intention to serve Hawaii from California. The demise of ATA Airlines left Hilo without overseas service once again.

In the wake of ATA&#x27;s bankruptcy, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported an undisclosed major U.S. Airline was considering service to Hilo. New mainland service was announced on December 15, 2010, when Continental Airlines announced that it would begin to fly to Hilo from both San Francisco and Los Angeles in June 2011. These flights were operated by United Airlines after the merger between the two carriers in 2011. Daily flights to and from Los Angeles commenced on June 9, 2011, and Saturday-only service to and from San Francisco on June 11, 2011. In 2013, United dropped service to San Francisco. Service to Los Angeles was decreased to five flights per week. However, United dropped service to Los Angeles in 2023.

== Facilities ==
=== Runways ===
Hilo International Airport has two runways. Runway 8-26 is and is used for nearly all air carrier operations. It is capable of accommodating overseas passenger service by aircraft as large as the Boeing 747 and is used occasionally by the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, a USAF military transport. Runway 3/21 is and is used for general aviation operations including take-off and landing of smaller commuter airplanes, although it is capable of handling smaller medium-sized aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 should the need arise.
In March 2022, there were 35 aircraft based at this airport: 10 single-engine, 3 multi-engine, 12 helicopter, 1 glider and 9 military.

=== Terminal Area ===
The passenger terminal complex, including commuter facilities, is at the southern edge of Hilo International Airport and is served by an access roadway from Hawaii Belt Road at Kekūanaōʻa Avenue. Air Cargo operations are handled at the new cargo facility located on the southern edge of Runway 8-26. Hawaiian Air Cargo, Southwest Cargo, and Aloha Air Cargo, are three of the major cargo operations served here. Other cargo operations include FedEx, Kamaka Air, and ʻOHANA By Hawaiian Cargo. The Northwest Apron, which serves this area of the airport, provides parking for transient military aircraft and is the site of some general aviation facilities. Other general aviation facilities are located to the south, near the Civil Air Patrol area.

=== Air Carrier Passenger Terminal ===
The main passenger terminal consists of three interconnected buildings totaling approximately . The central building consists of just under of space while the western and eastern wings occupy slightly more than each. Hawaiian Airlines operates a Premier Lounge at Hilo below Gate 6. The apron fronting the passenger terminal has ten aircraft parking positions, each able to accommodate a Boeing 747. Only eight of the positions are usable; two are used to provide eleven helicopter parking positions and there are just seven passenger loading bridges.

=== Commuter Terminal ===
The commuter terminal is located in a small, stand alone building approximately to the west of the main passenger terminal. Safari Aviation, a helicopter tour company, currently leases the building. Other aerial tour companies lease space in the western wing of General Lyman Terminal.

=== Underutilization ===
Although designed as the second gateway into and out of Hawaiʻi, for many years (until June 2011) Hilo had been Hawaiʻi&#x27;s only major airport lacking non-stop flights to North America.

Today, Hilo International Airport is the smallest of the state&#x27;s five major airports in terms of passenger arrivals and departures. Kona Airport and Līhuʻe Airport generally serve twice as many passengers as Hilo, while Maui&#x27;s Kahului Airport typically sees four times as many travelers. Moreover, while other airports grew significantly over the past several decades, Hilo International Airport has seen little long-term increase in air traffic.

In 1973, for example, the total passenger count at Hilo International Airport was 1,357,818. In 2008, that number stood at 1,352,808. Total traffic at Hilo peaked in 1997 with 1,669,314 people. An almost identical number of passengers, 1,667,163, passed through the airport in 2007. As a result, Hilo International Airport operates considerably below its capacity.

The primary reason for Hilo International Airport&#x27;s relatively stagnant passenger count is the lack of tourism within the airport&#x27;s service area, which includes the districts of Hilo and Puna, as well as portions of the districts of Hāmākua and Kaʻū, relative to the Kona district and Kohala district and the islands of Kauaʻi and Maui. In 2008, visitor hotel rooms and condominiums on Hawaiʻi island totaled 11,240 units. Of these, 9,576 (85.2%) were in the districts of Kona and Kohala. A mere 1,635 (14.5%) were within the districts of Hāmākua, Hilo, and Puna. In 2008, the respective numbers of visitor accommodations on Maui and Kauaʻi were 19,055 and 9,203. In fact, whereas the number of visitor accommodations elsewhere in the state climbed steadily since the 1970s, in east Hawaiʻi island several hotels have been shuttered or converted into apartments or condominiums.

=== Noise ===
Hilo International Airport&#x27;s proximity to residential areas has made noise abatement a persistent concern in the airport&#x27;s development and operations. Exacerbating the impact of airport activity on nearby residential neighborhoods is the fact that Hilo&#x27;s climate favors single wall, open air construction to take advantage of natural ventilation provided by trade winds. This results in minimal outdoor to indoor noise attenuation.

Complaints about airport noise have been received from locations including downtown Hilo, hotels and condominiums along Banyan Drive, and Keaukaha. In response, the Hawaiʻi State Department of Transportation implemented measures designed to mitigate airport noise.

Over 95% of aircraft operations take place on Runway 8-26 because the orientation of Runway 3-21 makes direct flights over residential and commercial areas unavoidable. Night and early morning flights are directed to arrive from and depart towards the east, where largely vacant land acts as a noise buffer. Day flights maintain a west to east pattern. Although this results in arriving aircraft coming closer to the downtown area, pilots attempt to remain over Hilo Bay for as long as possible before aligning their aircraft with the runway, crossing over near the Hilo Iron Works building. Also, aircraft landings are quieter than take-offs. All aircraft, in fact, are directed to avoid overflying residential and commercial areas to the extent possible. In addition, the U.S. military transferred some of its training activities to Kona International Airport. However, the military will occasionally do training exercises using the C-17 Globemaster and F-22 Raptor.

Other proposed noise mitigation measures include a barrier on the north side of the airport and the extension of Runway 8-26 by to the east and displacing the western end of the runway by the same amount, thereby maintaining the runway&#x27;s length. Community opposition to the construction of a barrier led the State to abandon the idea. It remains unclear if the Hawaiʻi State Department of Transportation will proceed with relocating Runway 8-26 east by 1,850 feet, especially given the 2009 demise of Aloha Airlines, whose older generation Boeing 737-200 fleet was considerably louder than Hawaiian Airlines&#x27; relatively modern Boeing 717-200s. However, those Boeing 737 aircraft are still being used by Trans Executive Airlines which continues with night flights to Honolulu. Southwest and United operate the Boeing 737-800 which makes a considerable amount of noise while taking off and landing.

== Accidents and incidents ==
*On January 6, 1967, a Curtiss C-46 Commando operated by &quot;Channel Air Lift&quot; crashed at General Lyman Field. A shift in cargo during takeoff caused the aircraft to stall and crash attempting to return to the airport. All three occupants were killed.
*On April 28, 1988, an Aloha Airlines Boeing 737-200 operating Flight 243 from General Lyman Field (as Hilo International Airport was known then) to Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (Honolulu International Airport) carrying 89 passengers and 5 crew members experienced rapid decompression when an section of the fuselage roof and sides were torn from the airplane. One flight attendant was blown out of the airplane and died. Several passengers sustained life-threatening injuries including instances of massive head wounds. The aircraft declared an emergency and landed at Kahului Airport on Maui. Investigations of the incident concluded that the accident was caused by metal fatigue. The incident caused almost all major United States air carriers to re-examine their oldest airplane models and those with the most &quot;cycles&quot; or flights. Many older aircraft were retired or phased out after these checks.
*On October 7, 2011, a Cessna 310 piloted by a 65-year-old pilot coming from Monterey, California, declared an emergency landing at about 12:30 pm. The plane was low on fuel, so it made a water landing 13 miles offshore of the Big Island.

<doc id="762194" wikidata="Q7960117" url="?curid=762194" title="Waimea–Kohala Airport">
<text>Waimea-Kohala Airport is a state-owned public-use airport located southwest of Waimea, an unincorporated town in Hawaii County, Hawaii, United States.

Hawaiian Airlines began scheduled passenger service from the airport in November 1953. , the only scheduled air service is by Mokulele Airlines, which offers twice daily service to Kahului, Maui.

It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2021–2025, in which it is categorized as a non-primary commercial service facility.

== Facilities and aircraft ==
Waimea-Kohala Airport covers an area of at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 4/22 with an asphalt surface measuring .

The airport has one taxiway and an aircraft parking apron at the west end of the runway serving the passenger terminal and general aviation facilities. No fueling or airport traffic control tower facilities are provided. An aircraft rescue and fire fighting facility shares space in the airport maintenance facility.

For the 12-month period ending June 30, 2016, the airport had 4,178 aircraft operations, an average of 11 per day: 57% air taxi, 31% general aviation and 12% military. In April 2022, there were 4 aircraft based at this airport: 2 single-engine and 2 multi-engine.
== Airline and destinations ==


Mokulele Airlines serves the airport with Cessna 208EX Grand Caravan commuter turboprop aircraft.

Previously, Pacific Wings operated service to Honolulu and Kahului. Originally subsidized by the Essential Air Service program, Pacific Wings began serving Waimea-Kohala without subsidy on April 1, 2007. By May 2013, when reports emerged the airline was ending all service in Hawaii, the airline had already ceased serving Waimea-Kohala Airport. Mokulele Airlines, Schuman Aviation, and Pacific Wings submitted bids to the DOT to provide service at the airport, however only Mokulele and Schuman have proposed actual flights—Pacific Wings suggested two buses a day to Kona. On July 2, 2013, the US DOT awarded the contract to Mokulele Airlines for service to Kahului. Mokulele began operating flights to Waimea-Kohala on September 21, 2013.

== Historical airline service ==

The airport previously had scheduled passenger jet service operated by Aloha Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines, both of which referred to the airport as Kamuela in their respective system timetables during the 1960s. In 1966, Hawaiian Airlines was operating a daily Douglas DC-9-10 jet flight with a routing of Hilo (ITO) - Kamuela (MUE) - Kahului, Maui (OGG) - Honolulu (HNL) and was also serving the airport with Convair 640 turboprops on flights to Honolulu, Maui and Kona at this time. In 1968, Aloha Airlines was flying daily British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven jet service with a routing of Kamuela (MUE) - Kahului, Maui (OGG) - Honolulu (HNL) and was also operating flights with Vickers Viscount turboprops with daily nonstop service from Honolulu with this flight continuing on to Kona (KOA) at this time.
In 1976, Hawaiian Airlines was operating daily McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jet service into the airport with a round trip routing of HNL-OGG-MUE. By 1981, Hawaiian Airlines was serving the airport with de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7 turboprops on nonstop flights between Waimea and Kahului, Maui and Honolulu.

Princeville Airways/Aloha Island Air also operated to Kamuela airport in the late 1980s &amp; 1990&#x27;s

<doc id="762203" wikidata="Q3796691" url="?curid=762203" title="Order embedding">
<text>In order theory, a branch of mathematics, an order embedding is a special kind of monotone function, which provides a way to include one partially ordered set into another. Like Galois connections, order embeddings constitute a notion which is strictly weaker than the concept of an order isomorphism. Both of these weakenings may be understood in terms of category theory.

== Formal definition ==
Formally, given two partially ordered sets (posets) formula_1 and formula_2, a function formula_3 is an &quot;order embedding&quot; if formula_4 is both order-preserving and order-reflecting, i.e. for all formula_5 and formula_6 in formula_7, one has

: formula_8

Such a function is necessarily injective, since formula_9 implies formula_10 and formula_11. If an order embedding between two posets formula_7 and formula_13 exists, one says that formula_7 can be embedded into formula_13.

== Properties ==
An order isomorphism can be characterized as a surjective order embedding. As a consequence, any order embedding &quot;f&quot; restricts to an isomorphism between its domain &quot;S&quot; and its image &quot;f&quot;(&quot;S&quot;), which justifies the term &quot;embedding&quot;. On the other hand, it might well be that two (necessarily infinite) posets are mutually order-embeddable into each other without being order-isomorphic. 

An example is provided by the open interval formula_16 of real numbers and the corresponding closed interval formula_17. The function formula_18 maps the former to the subset formula_19 of the latter and the latter to the subset formula_20 of the former, see picture. Ordering both sets in the natural way, formula_4 is both order-preserving and order-reflecting (because it is an affine function). Yet, no isomorphism between the two posets can exist, since e.g. formula_17 has a least element while formula_16 does not.
For a similar example using arctan to order-embed the real numbers into an interval, and the identity map for the reverse direction, see e.g. Just and Weese (1996).

A retract is a pair formula_24 of order-preserving maps whose composition formula_25 is the identity. In this case, formula_4 is called a coretraction, and must be an order embedding. However, not every order embedding is a coretraction. As a trivial example, the unique order embedding formula_27 from the empty poset to a nonempty poset has no retract, because there is no order-preserving map formula_28. More illustratively, consider the set formula_7 of divisors of 6, partially ordered by &quot;x&quot; divides &quot;y&quot;, see picture. Consider the embedded sub-poset formula_30. A retract of the embedding formula_31 would need to send formula_32 to somewhere in formula_30 above both formula_34 and formula_35, but there is no such place.

== Additional perspectives ==

Posets can straightforwardly be viewed from many perspectives, and order embeddings are basic enough that they tend to be visible from everywhere. For example:
* (Model theoretically) &quot;A&quot; poset is a set equipped with a (reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive) binary relation. An order embedding &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; is an isomorphism from &quot;A&quot; to an elementary substructure of &quot;B&quot;.
* (Graph theoretically) &quot;A&quot; poset is a (transitive, acyclic, directed, reflexive) graph. An order embedding &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; is a graph isomorphism from &quot;A&quot; to an induced subgraph of &quot;B&quot;.
* (Category theoretically) A poset is a (small, thin, and skeletal) category such that each homset has at most one element. An order embedding &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; is a full and faithful functor from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; which is injective on objects, or equivalently an isomorphism from &quot;A&quot; to a full subcategory of &quot;B&quot;.

<doc id="762206" wikidata="Q5577786" url="?curid=762206" title="Going Great">
<text>Going Great is a Canadian newsmagazine type show that originally aired on CBC and premiered in the United States on Nickelodeon on October 1, 1983. Produced by Michael Maclear and hosted by Chris Makepeace, &quot;Going Great&quot; focused on kids of all ages who did very amazing feats in the world some people couldn&#x27;t do. New episodes aired on Tuesdays and Thursdays until February 14, 1984 (39 episodes).

== History ==
Originally produced by CBC for 13 episodes, Nickelodeon was so impressed by the show that they ordered an additional 26 episodes, bringing the total number of episodes to 39. &quot;Going Great&quot; was one of Nickelodeon&#x27;s lowest rated TV shows, receiving a 2 out of every 6 people watching it. &quot;Against the Odds&quot; is the lowest with 1 out of 6 people watching it.

&quot;Going Great&quot; focused on being able to do amazing, extreme things. Kids were shown and asked about their bravery, and they always said: &quot;I&#x27;m not brave&quot;. With help from Nickelodeon, kids were able to do great things, hence the name &quot;Going Great.&quot;

In 1984, Keanu Reeves was a correspondent for the show.

== Response ==
While &quot;Going Great&quot; focused on child prodigies, it left normal kids with low self-esteem when Nickelodeon took it to focus groups, with the common response being &quot;Well, I&#x27;ll never be that good so I won&#x27;t try that.&quot;

<doc id="762211" wikidata="Q1653252" url="?curid=762211" title="Tejas (album)">
<text>Tejas is the fifth studio album by the American rock band ZZ Top. It was released in late November 1976, on the London label. The title is a Caddo language word meaning &quot;friends&quot;, which is the origin of the name of the band&#x27;s home state, Texas.

== Background and release ==

Frontman Billy Gibbons said about the album:

It&#x27;s fair to say that this is a transitional record, although I&#x27;m not really sure what we were transitioning from and what we were becoming. (laughs) It may be representative of how rapidly things were changing in the studio.

The equipment was becoming more modernized, and the way that music was being recorded was different – things were moving faster. It was still pre-digital, but there was better gear that was more readily available. We made use of it all.

This period was the wrinkle that kind of suggested what was to come, and change would become a necessary part of the ZZ Top fabric.
&quot;Tejas&quot; was produced by Bill Ham and recorded and mixed by Terry Manning. In 1987, a digitally remixed version of the recording was released on CD and the original 1976 mix version was discontinued. The remix version (which was not remixed by original engineer Terry Manning) created controversy among fans because it significantly changed the instrument balance and the sound of the instruments, especially the drums.

&quot;Tejas&quot; was released as a digital download on Amazon.com&#x27;s MP3 store and iTunes in 2012, with the original mixes of the tracks that are included on &quot;Chrome, Smoke &amp; BBQ&quot;, and the 1987 remixes of the tracks that are not from that boxset. The original mix of the album was released on CD in June 2013 as part of the box set &quot;The Complete Studio Albums (1970–1990)&quot;.

== Critical reception ==

In a contemporaneous review of the album Richard Riegel of &quot;Creem&quot; called &quot;Tejas&quot; an album that &quot;sings of those Southwestern lyrical staples... but with greater immediacy than the I&#x27;m-all-dressed-up-in-my-Roy-Rogers-cowboy-suit Eagles&quot;. He compared the album to that of Peter Frampton&#x27;s &quot;Frampton Comes Alive!&quot;, but observes that &quot;Tejas&quot; might outsell Frampton.

Barry Cain of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; wrote in a review that &quot;Tejas&quot; was highlighted by the songs &quot;Arrested For Driving While Blind&quot; and &quot;El Diablo&quot;. He states that &quot;El Diablo&quot; had &quot;struck him as being about the most haunting song he ever come across&quot;. Cain also praised the vocals and guitar playing of Billy Gibbons on the album.

Writing for the &quot;Something Else!&quot; webzine in 2016, M. C. Mosquito said, &quot;There are actually a lot of very good songs on &quot;Tejas&quot;, but many critics and much of the public dismissed it as ZZ Top gone &quot;countrified,&quot; in part because of the twangy opener &quot;It&#x27;s Only Love.&quot; ... The rest of the record, however, is only a little more country than the rest of the band&#x27;s initial albums. Had that song been shuffled down elsewhere in the sequence and replaced with something like &quot;Ten Dollar Man&quot; as the lead off track, maybe the twang tone factor wouldn&#x27;t have been so noticeable, making it more marketable to the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll crowd. Then again, there&#x27;s some pretty countrified fiddle in there too, so maybe the country label is kind of legit.&quot;

<text>Jeff Stryker (born Charles Casper Peyton, August 21, 1962) is an American pornographic actor who has starred in bisexual, gay and straight adult films. He lives in California.

==Early life==
Jeff Stryker grew up in Springfield, Illinois. His father was a car salesman and his mother was a nurse.

==Pre-film career==
Jeff Stryker worked as a stripper and delivered balloon-o-grams before a local photographer sent shots of him to gay adult film director John Travis in California.

==Film career and sexuality==
Stryker is primarily known as a performer in gay pornography films, although &quot;Jamie Loves Jeff&quot; was one of the biggest selling heterosexual adult movies of all time for its producer, Vivid Entertainment. He describes himself (in a somewhat joking fashion) as sexually &quot;universal&quot;. He has also said, &quot;I don’t define myself as anything.&quot;

He has also worked as a non-pornographic actor, starring in a 1989 Italian-produced horror film called &quot;After Death&quot; (Revenge of the Zombies), in which he was credited as Chuck Peyton. Later in the American DVD release, the name Jeff Stryker was used as well. A trailer interview was added with Stryker describing the experience he had while shooting this movie in Manila. Stryker also starred in the short film by German cult director Rosa von Praunheim &quot;Can I Be Your Bratwurst, Please?&quot; Stryker also appeared in a 1995 German television movie &quot;The Black Curse&quot; starring James Brolin, as well as the 1988 Italian feature &quot;Dirty Love&quot;.

==Awards and tributes==
* AVN Hall of Fame inductee
* GayVN Hall of Fame inductee
* 2000 Grabby Wall of Fame inductee
* 2004 Hustler Porn Walk of Fame
* 1986 XRCO Best Actor (Gay) 
* Stryker was featured in a 1991 portrait by artists Pierre et Gilles.

==Merchandising==
The Jeff Stryker Cock and Balls, a dildo fashioned from a cast of his penis, is widely sold in sex stores. The sex toy is notable not only for being popular, but also because Stryker and the manufacturer of the item litigated for the rights to its likeness as part of Stryker&#x27;s intellectual property. The case eventually reached a mutually acceptable resolution (see ). In a 1999 &quot;Salon&quot; article written by Jeff Stryker, a New York journalist and the porn actor&#x27;s namesake, the dildo is even described as an object of higher culture. It was mentioned in Allan Gurganus&#x27; 1997 novel &quot;Plays Well with Others&quot;, where the novel&#x27;s narrator cleans up a closet filled with dildos, the premium find being &quot;a Jeff Stryker, a monster, but somehow Roman in its genial fluted civic beauty.&quot;

Stryker has released a country music album titled &quot;Wild Buck&quot; (1995).
In 2003, he released a limited edition anatomically correct action figure of himself.

==Reaction from other celebrities==
* Filmmaker and author John Waters called Jeff Stryker “the Cary Grant of porno.”
* American comedian Margaret Cho&#x27;s routines involve her love for his films. In her show, &quot;Assassin&quot;, she discusses in detail the many places one can use the dildo. Stryker had given Cho his commercially produced action figure.
* In her autobiography, Traci Lords describes him as “handsome but rather dumb looking” after he gave her scornful looks backstage during a Thierry Mugler Fashion show in Paris.

==Legal battles==
Stryker sued Health Devices Inc. and California Publishers Liquidating Corp. for over $1 million for breach of contract and piracy when they sold a bootleg dildo of his genitals without paying him sufficiently. The case was heard before a judge in Los Angeles, who eventually brokered a deal whereby the case was dismissed upon payment of $25,000 to Stryker and the return and right to reproduce all items which Stryker endorsed.

Stryker has had arguments with Kulak&#x27;s Woodshed, a folk-music nightclub, that is next door to his office. He claims that the club causes disturbance normally associated with large late-night urban venues: noise, drugs, unruly patrons, vandalism, graffiti, public urination and parking headaches. James Britton, who operates a floor covering business on the other side of the club, also complains that the club has damaged his business. In January 2009, the &quot;L.A. Weekly&quot; reported that Stryker blamed the nightclub for preventing him from completing his autobiography, as the noise and crowds disturbed his concentration. “(My writing has) been put on perpetual hold until I can get myself back together,” he told the newspaper. “I got a $25,000 advance on (the book) but could never complete it.”

But Paul Kulak counter claims (according to the &quot;L.A. Weekly&quot;) that Stryker has made threats to him and the club&#x27;s customers: “He constantly reminds me he’s a firearms expert and will hide behind his back door when I dump the trash. Once, he started making mechanical gun clicks. I could see he had a pistol in his hand as he was dry-firing it... I’m willing to risk my life to keep this [club] going.” Stryker responded to Kulak&#x27;s claim and was quoted as saying, &quot;That guy is so out there!&quot;

==Stage shows==
Stryker appeared in &quot;A Sophisticated Evening with Jeff Stryker&quot; in Los Angeles, Summer 2006 and in Provincetown, Massachusetts, Summer 2007. The show was produced by comedy writer Bruce Vilanch. In the show, Stryker performed a comic monologue about his life and adventures in adult films, conducted a &quot;porn acting demo&quot; comedy skit with an audience member, and danced in a nude finale where he greeted the audience.

From 1999 through 2001, Stryker performed in a stage show called &quot;Hard Time&quot;, a comedy send-up of gay porn prison films. In the finale, Stryker danced nude. After the play, Stryker met with the audience at the door. The show toured several cities including New York, San Francisco, Chicago, San Diego and Houston.

<doc id="762226" wikidata="Q5486715" url="?curid=762226" title="GFS2">
<text>In computing, the Global File System 2 (GFS2) is a shared-disk file system for Linux computer clusters. GFS2 allows all members of a cluster to have direct concurrent access to the same shared block storage, in contrast to distributed file systems which distribute data throughout the cluster. GFS2 can also be used as a local file system on a single computer. 

GFS2 has no disconnected operating-mode, and no client or server roles. All nodes in a GFS2 cluster function as peers. Using GFS2 in a cluster requires hardware to allow access to the shared storage, and a lock manager to control access to the storage.
The lock manager operates as a separate module: thus GFS2 can use the distributed lock manager (DLM) for cluster configurations and the &quot;nolock&quot; lock manager for local filesystems. Older versions of GFS also support GULM, a server-based lock manager which implements redundancy via failover.

GFS and GFS2 are free software, distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

== History ==

Development of GFS began in 1995 and was originally developed by University of Minnesota professor Matthew O&#x27;Keefe and a group of students. It was originally written for SGI&#x27;s IRIX operating system, but in 1998 it was ported to Linux (2.4) since the open source code provided a more convenient development platform. In late 1999/early 2000 it made its way to Sistina Software, where it lived for a time as an open-source project. In 2001, Sistina made the choice to make GFS a proprietary product.

Developers forked OpenGFS from the last public release of GFS and then further enhanced it to include updates allowing it to work with OpenDLM. But OpenGFS and OpenDLM became defunct, since Red Hat purchased Sistina in December 2003 and released GFS and many cluster-infrastructure pieces under the GPL in late June 2004.

Red Hat subsequently financed further development geared towards bug-fixing and stabilization. A further development, GFS2 derives from GFS and was included along with its distributed lock manager (shared with GFS) in Linux 2.6.19. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2 included GFS2 as a kernel module for evaluation purposes. With the 5.3 update, GFS2 became part of the kernel package.

GFS2 forms part of the Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and associated CentOS Linux distributions. Users can purchase commercial support to run GFS2 fully supported on top of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. As of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.3, GFS2 is supported in cloud computing environments in which shared storage devices are available.

The following list summarizes some version numbers and major features introduced:

* v1.0 (1996) SGI IRIX only
* v3.0 Linux port
* v4 journaling
* v5 Redundant lock manager
* v6.1 (2005) Distributed lock manager
* Linux 2.6.19 - GFS2 and DLM merged into Linux kernel
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3 releases the first fully supported GFS2

== Hardware ==

The design of GFS and of GFS2 targets storage area network (SAN)-like environments. Although it is possible to use them as a single node filesystem, the full feature-set requires a SAN. This can take the form of iSCSI, Fibre Channel, ATA over Ethernet (AoE), or any other device which can be presented under Linux as a block device shared by a number of nodes, for example a DRBD device.

The distributed lock manager (DLM) requires an IP based network over which to communicate. This is normally just Ethernet, but again, there are many other possible solutions. Depending upon the choice of SAN, it may be possible to combine this, but normal practice involves separate networks for the DLM and storage.

The GFS requires a fencing mechanism of some kind. This is a requirement of the cluster infrastructure, rather than GFS/GFS2 itself, but it is required for all multi-node clusters. The usual options include power switches and remote access controllers (e.g. DRAC, IPMI, or ILO). Virtual and hypervisor-based fencing mechanisms can also be used. Fencing is used to ensure that a node which the cluster believes to be failed cannot suddenly start working again while another node is recovering the journal for the failed node. It can also optionally restart the failed node automatically once the recovery is complete.

== Differences from a local filesystem ==

Although the designers of GFS/GFS2 aimed to emulate a local filesystem closely, there are a number of differences to be aware of. Some of these are due to the existing filesystem interfaces not allowing the passing of information relating to the cluster. Some stem from the difficulty of implementing those features efficiently in a clustered manner. For example:

* The flock() system call on GFS/GFS2 is not interruptible by signals.
* The fcntl() F_GETLK system call returns a PID of any blocking lock. Since this is a cluster filesystem, that PID might refer to a process on any of the nodes which have the filesystem mounted. Since the purpose of this interface is to allow a signal to be sent to the blocking process, this is no longer possible.
* Leases are not supported with the lock_dlm (cluster) lock module, but they are supported when used as a local filesystem
* dnotify will work on a &quot;same node&quot; basis, but its use with GFS/GFS2 is not recommended
* inotify will also work on a &quot;same node&quot; basis, and is also not recommended (but it may become supported in the future)
* splice is supported on GFS2 only

The other main difference, and one that is shared by all similar cluster filesystems, is that the cache control mechanism, known as glocks (pronounced Gee-locks) for GFS/GFS2, has an effect across the whole cluster. Each inode on the filesystem has two glocks associated with it. One (called the iopen glock) keeps track of which processes have the inode open. The other (the inode glock) controls the cache relating to that inode. A glock has four states, UN (unlocked), SH (shared – a read lock), DF (deferred – a read lock incompatible with SH) and EX (exclusive). Each of the four modes maps directly to a DLM lock mode.

When in EX mode, an inode is allowed to cache data and metadata (which might be &quot;dirty&quot;, i.e. waiting for write back to the filesystem). In SH mode, the inode can cache data and metadata, but it must not be dirty. In DF mode, the inode is allowed to cache metadata only, and again it must not be dirty. The DF mode is used only for direct I/O. In UN mode, the inode must not cache any metadata.

In order that operations which change an inode&#x27;s data or metadata do not interfere with each other, an EX lock is used. This means that certain operations, such as create/unlink of files from the &quot;same&quot; directory and writes to the &quot;same&quot; file should be, in general, restricted to one node in the cluster. Of course, doing these operations from multiple nodes will work as expected, but due to the requirement to flush caches frequently, it will not be very efficient.

The single most frequently asked question about GFS/GFS2 performance is why the performance can be poor with email servers. The solution is to break up the mail spool into separate directories and to try to keep (so far as is possible) each node reading and writing to a private set of directories.

== Journaling ==

GFS and GFS2 are both journaled file systems; and GFS2 supports a similar set of journaling modes as ext3. In &quot;data=writeback&quot; mode, only metadata is journaled. This is the only mode supported by GFS, however it is possible to turn on journaling on individual data-files, but only when they are of zero size. Journaled files in GFS have a number of restrictions placed upon them, such as
no support for the mmap or sendfile system calls, they also use a different on-disk format from regular files. There is also an &quot;inherit-journal&quot; attribute which when set on a directory causes all files (and sub-directories) created within that directory to have the journal (or inherit-journal, respectively) flag set. This can be used instead of the &quot;data=journal&quot; mount option which ext3 supports (and GFS/GFS2 does not).

GFS2 also supports &quot;data=ordered&quot; mode which is similar to &quot;data=writeback&quot; except that dirty data is synced before each journal flush is completed. This ensures that blocks which have been added to an inode will have their content synced back to disk before the metadata is updated to record the new size and thus prevents uninitialised blocks appearing in a file under node failure conditions. The default journaling mode is &quot;data=ordered&quot;, to match ext3&#x27;s default.

, GFS2 does not yet support &quot;data=journal&quot; mode, but it does (unlike GFS) use the same on-disk format for both regular and journaled files, and it also supports the same journaled and inherit-journal attributes. GFS2 also relaxes the restrictions on when a file may have its journaled attribute changed to any time that the file is not open (also the same as ext3).

For performance reasons, each node in GFS and GFS2 has its own journal. In GFS the journals are disk extents, in GFS2 the journals are just regular files. The number of nodes which may mount the filesystem at any one time is limited by the number of available journals.

== Features of GFS2 compared with GFS ==

GFS2 adds a number of new features which are not in GFS. Here is a summary of those features not already mentioned in the boxes to the right of this page:

* The metadata filesystem (really a different root) – see Compatibility and the GFS2 meta filesystem below
* GFS2 specific trace points have been available since kernel 2.6.32
* The XFS-style quota interface has been available in GFS2 since kernel 2.6.33
* Caching ACLs have been available in GFS2 since 2.6.33
* GFS2 supports the generation of &quot;discard&quot; requests for thin provisioning/SCSI TRIM requests
* GFS2 supports I/O barriers (on by default, assuming underlying device supports it. Configurable from kernel 2.6.33 and up)
* FIEMAP ioctl (to query mappings of inodes on disk)
* Splice (system call) support
* mmap/splice support for journaled files (enabled by using the same on disk format as for regular files)
* Far fewer tunables (making set-up less complicated)
* Ordered write mode (as per ext3, GFS only has writeback mode)

== Compatibility and the GFS2 meta filesystem ==

GFS2 was designed so that upgrading from GFS would be a simple procedure. To this end, most of the on-disk structure has remained the same as GFS, including the big-endian byte ordering. There are a few differences though:

* GFS2 has a &quot;meta filesystem&quot; through which processes access system files
* GFS2 uses the same on-disk format for journaled files as for regular files
* GFS2 uses regular (system) files for journals, whereas GFS uses special extents
* GFS2 has some other &quot;&quot; system files
* The layout of the inode is (very slightly) different
* The layout of indirect blocks differs slightly

The journaling systems of GFS and GFS2 are not compatible with each other. Upgrading is possible by means of a tool () which is run with the filesystem off-line to update the metadata. Some spare blocks in the GFS journals are used to create the (very small) files required by GFS2 during the update process. Most of the data remains in place.

The GFS2 &quot;meta filesystem&quot; is not a filesystem in its own right, but an alternate root of the main filesystem. Although it behaves like a &quot;normal&quot; filesystem, its contents are the various system files used by GFS2, and normally users do not need to ever look at it. The GFS2 utilities mount and unmount the meta filesystem as required, behind the scenes.

<doc id="762228" wikidata="Q253369" url="?curid=762228" title="Eliminator (album)">
<text>Eliminator is the eighth studio album by American rock band ZZ Top. It was released on March 23, 1983, by Warner Bros. Records, and rose high on the charts in many countries. Four hit singles were released—&quot;Gimme All Your Lovin&#x27;&quot; which reached the American Top 40, &quot;Sharp Dressed Man&quot;, &quot;TV Dinners&quot; and their most successful single, &quot;Legs&quot;. &quot;Eliminator&quot; is ZZ Top&#x27;s most commercially successful release, with sales of 11 million and diamond certification in the US.

Since &quot;El Loco&quot; in 1981, the bandleader, Billy Gibbons, had been moving ZZ Top&#x27;s boogie and blues rock style towards the popular new wave style. For &quot;Eliminator&quot;, he increased the tempo and used more synthesizers and drum machines, producing a &quot;tighter&quot; album with a steady, driving beat. The pre-production engineer Linden Hudson collaborated with Gibbons in Texas on the tempo and songs. The producer Bill Ham and the engineer Terry Manning joined Gibbons in Memphis, Tennessee, to edit the songs, replacing much of the contributions of bassist Dusty Hill and drummer Frank Beard. Ham claimed the album was solely the work of ZZ Top, but in 1986 Hudson won a lawsuit establishing himself as composer of the song &quot;Thug&quot;.

Music videos for &quot;Gimme All Your Lovin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Sharp Dressed Man&quot; and &quot;Legs&quot; received regular rotation on MTV and helped ZZ Top gain popularity with a younger base. A customized 1933 Ford coupe, depicted on the album cover, appeared in the videos. Following &quot;Eliminator&quot; release, ZZ Top embarked on a worldwide concert tour.

The video for &quot;Legs&quot; earned the band the MTV Video Music Award for Best Group. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named &quot;Eliminator&quot; number 398 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. It was listed at number 39 in The 100 Greatest Albums of the 80s, and it was also included in Robert Dimery&#x27;s book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. A remastered version was released in 2008.

==Background==
In 1978, ZZ Top went on hiatus, weary of constant touring. Bandleader and guitarist Billy Gibbons traveled around Europe, and bassist Dusty Hill vacationed in Mexico; both grew their beards longer. Drummer Frank Beard checked into Palmer Drug Abuse Program, a Houston detox community, for his addiction to hard narcotics. To help finance Palmer, Beard organized a benefit concert and an album titled &quot;Freeway&quot;, working with engineers Steve Ames and Linden Hudson at Rampart Studios in Houston. After signing to Warner Bros. Records, ZZ Top released &quot;Degüello&quot; in 1979, which was certified platinum in early 1980.

In 1979, Beard bought a large house in Quail Valley outside Houston, overlooking a golf course where he often played as a way to stay off drugs. The band wanted a private rehearsal studio, so Beard invited Hudson to move in and construct a recording studio in his home. Hudson designed the studio and oversaw its construction, centered on an isolation booth holding Beard&#x27;s drum kit, with more booths for guitar and bass amplifiers. Microphone signals ran through the mixing console and some outboard gear to the band&#x27;s semi-pro 1-inch 16-track Tascam tape recorder.

In 1980, ZZ Top used the studio to work on material for their next album, &quot;El Loco&quot;. Hudson played on several demos, including a synth line on &quot;Groovy Little Hippie Pad&quot; which was mixed into the album by ZZ Top&#x27;s engineer Terry Manning. Hudson was not credited but was promised future compensation. Hudson also introduced Gibbons to drum machines during these rehearsals. Gibbons later called Hudson &quot;an influential associate... a gifted songwriter... He brought some elements to the forefront that helped reshape what ZZ Top were doing, starting in the studio and eventually to the live stage.&quot;

From this point forward, the band was not able to reproduce certain songs in concert without using pre-recorded tracks. They carried a small tape player to each concert, with a technician hitting the &quot;play&quot; button to give Beard a click track cue in his headphones. The tape held synthesizer parts, drum samples and other elements. None of this was made public; Bill Ham, the band&#x27;s manager, was closely controlling their image to create a &quot;mystique&quot; of self-sufficiency and authenticity.

==Recording==
Gibbons was inspired by British electronic acts such as Depeche Mode and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark to explore electronic music technology. He often spoke with Hudson about new ideas in music. A former radio DJ, Hudson presented Gibbons with personal research showing that many hit songs were clustered near a tempo of 124 beats per minute—faster than ZZ Top&#x27;s normal practice. Gibbons followed suit with most of &quot;Eliminator&quot;, setting the new pace with drum machines. &quot;Legs&quot; and &quot;Sharp Dressed Man&quot; are both 125 bpm while &quot;Gimme All Your Lovin&#x27;&quot; runs at 120. Gibbons said in 2012 that he first used a drum machine on &quot;Eliminator&quot;—the first album on which ZZ Top &quot;paid serious attention&quot; to timing and tempo, which was &quot;timed and tuned very tight&quot;.
The first songwriting sessions for &quot;Eliminator&quot; were mainly Gibbons and Hudson working together in Beard&#x27;s home studio while Beard was out playing golf. Beard and Hill sometimes participated, and Ham checked in occasionally. Hudson programmed a drum machine for the rhythm, and played keyboard bass. Gibbons and Hudson collaborated on lyrics and music, putting together a demo of &quot;Got Me Under Pressure&quot; featuring Gibbons&#x27;s electric guitar work on top of the electronic sounds. Gibbons felt that the synthesizers &quot;created a nice platform that allowed the guitar to stand on its own&quot;, and that as the synthesizers could play an octave lower than a bass guitar, they created &quot;a nice full bed of sound&quot; that contrasted with his guitar. Ham was initially unaware that Gibbons was building a new sound without Beard or Hill. While the band was off touring, Hudson wrote &quot;Thug&quot; by himself.

Carrying the demo tapes created by Gibbons and Hudson, ZZ Top traveled without Hudson to Memphis, Tennessee, to stay at the Peabody Hotel while they recorded basic tracks at Ardent Studios, with Manning once again at the controls of the custom-built SpectraSonics mixing console. For the majority of songs, Gibbons played Dean guitars with DiMarzio super distortion pickups, plugged into a Legend hybrid amplifier, and miked with an AKG 414B-ULS large-diaphragm condenser microphone. When recording rhythm guitar parts, the sound pressure level (audio volume) was set very high to satisfy Gibbons, but this made it impossible for him to lift his fingers from the guitar to change chords without feedback. Instead, each chord was played once and doubled again on a pair of tracks, then the next chord was played twice and recorded to two more adjacent tracks. These alternating pairs of tracks were blended seamlessly into each other by Manning punching the tracks in and out. A side benefit of this laborious process was the elimination of the usual squeaks from shifting the fingers to change chords. Hill and Beard laid down bass guitar and drums, recording their parts onto 2-inch tape. Hill sang his vocals for &quot;I Got the Six&quot;. When they were finished, Hill and Beard returned home to Texas.

Gibbons, Manning and Ham continued to work on the album without Hill and Beard. Vocal harmonies were supplied by Manning and Jimi Jamison, the new lead singer of Cobra. To achieve Gibbons&#x27; desired clock-steady rhythm section, most of Hill&#x27;s bass parts were replaced by Gibbons or Manning playing bass guitar or a Moog Source—a keyboard synthesizer. A Memorymoog was also used for supporting synth sounds. Most of Beard&#x27;s drumming was replaced by drum machine or Simmons SDS-V electronic drums, keeping Beard&#x27;s acoustic tom-tom drum fills and cymbal accents. The song &quot;Legs&quot; was not coming together for Gibbons, so Manning carried the tape home to his 24-track attic studio and reworked every part except the guitar and vocals from Gibbons. Manning also created a longer dance mix for &quot;Legs&quot;. To replace the drums, Manning programmed his Oberheim DMX drum machine, then augmented the snare drum and hi-hat sounds by triggering more samples on an AMS DMX delay unit. Eight years later, Gibbons thanked Al Jourgensen because his early Ministry drum samples had been used to polish &quot;Eliminator&quot;.

=== Writing dispute ===
Hudson collaborated on the album tempo with Gibbons, and he co-wrote several songs. The band&#x27;s longtime stage manager, David Blayney, wrote about the collaboration in 1994 in his book, &quot;Sharp Dressed Men&quot;. The demo version of the album that was prepared for Memphis was largely the product of Gibbons and Hudson. On &quot;I Got the Six&quot;, Hudson helped write the lyrics, and on &quot;Dirty Dog&quot; he originated the shouted phrase, &quot;Hey! Get that dog outta my yard!&quot;, which was exactly duplicated and replaced in Memphis. He added special effects to &quot;Dirty Dog&quot; and &quot;TV Dinners&quot;, and the pulsing synthesizer effect on &quot;Legs&quot; was his invention. He helped compose and arrange &quot;Got Me Under Pressure&quot;, including playing the synth bass line and programming the drum machine.

Hudson&#x27;s song &quot;Thug&quot; was taken in its entirety: on the album, &quot;Thug&quot; lists Gibbons, Beard and Hill as the songwriters. ZZ Top&#x27;s management company—Lone Wolf—denied that Hudson was significantly involved, and said that the album concept was solely the work of Gibbons and Ham. After the album came out in late March 1983, Hudson moved out of Beard&#x27;s house, cut his ties with the band, and sued Lone Wolf for $1 million, arguing that his December 1982 copyright date for &quot;Thug&quot; preceded ZZ Top&#x27;s copyright date of April 1983. Ham claimed that Hudson sold the song outright, but no record of such a sale was brought forward, and in December 1986 the judge decided in Hudson&#x27;s favor, awarding him $600,000. Hudson paid a third of this to his attorneys, and a third to his publisher, Huey P. Meaux. Blayney wrote that &quot;Linden Hudson in a fair world should have had his name all over &quot;Eliminator&quot; and gotten the just compensation he deserved. Instead he got ostracized.&quot;

==Vintage car==

The album was named for a drag racing term after Ham said the band should feature Gibbons&#x27;s newly customized 1933 Ford coupe. An early suggestion for the album title came from filmmaker Mike Griffin who proposed &quot;Top Fuel&quot;, but Ham shifted the idea to &quot;Eliminator&quot;—the term for any category of race cars competing against each other.

In 1976, Gibbons met with Don Thelen of Buffalo Motor Cars in Paramount, California, and Ronnie Jones of Hand Crafted Metal with some help from Sid Blackard, to build the car. It was built with a Corvette-style engine. It was finished in 1983 and called the Eliminator after the album name. The car has become recognizable for its red finish and graphics, and is in several of the band&#x27;s music videos, plus appearances in television, movies, auto shows, and charity events. The car reportedly cost Gibbons $50,000. Gibbons keeps the car in Cleveland at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame where it is on display, but he may still &quot;crank it up and take it out for a spin&quot; whenever he is in the area.

==Release==
&quot;Eliminator&quot; was released worldwide on March 23, 1983. &quot;Gimme All Your Lovin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Sharp Dressed Man&quot;, &quot;TV Dinners&quot; and &quot;Legs&quot; were released as singles. &quot;Gimme All Your Lovin&#x27;&quot; went to the number two position of &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in April 1983, then a month later it broke into the Top 40 pop chart. The next three singles also hit the Mainstream Rock Airplay chart: &quot;Sharp Dressed Man&quot; peaked at number eight in July, &quot;TV Dinners&quot; rose to number 38 in December, and then &quot;Legs&quot; topped out at number three in June 1984 after its video was released in May. The song &quot;Got Me Under Pressure&quot; also received radio airplay and peaked at number 18 in May 1983.

&quot;Eliminator&quot; was the first ZZ Top album to become a worldwide success, and made the band &quot;bona fide pop stars&quot;, according to the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. By December 1996, &quot;Eliminator&quot; had sold more than 11 million copies in the US, ten times more than any previous ZZ Top album.

==Music videos==

Record executive Jeff Ayeroff saw how MTV was reshaping popular music throughout 1982. After he joined Warner Bros. Records in early 1983, he convinced them to pay for the first ZZ Top music video, for &quot;Gimme All Your Lovin&#x27;&quot;. Warner hired filmmaker Tim Newman, who also created videos for &quot;Sharp Dressed Man&quot; and &quot;Legs&quot;. The videos depicted America as &quot;a land of rock and roll, cars and girls&quot;, with three female models driving the Eliminator car. The &quot;Legs&quot; video featured the debut of ZZ Top&#x27;s spinning guitars, covered in white sheepskin.

The videos greatly advanced ZZ Top&#x27;s visibility. According to &quot;Texas Monthly&quot;, the album&#x27;s synthesizer sound was &quot;perfect&quot; for the MTV audience, who had previously seen ZZ Top as an &quot;old-fogey band&quot;. The videos earned ZZ Top awards for Best Band and Best Group Video at the 1984 MTV Awards. For &quot;Legs&quot;, Newman negotiated a fixed payment every time &quot;Eliminator&quot; was certified for another 250,000 units sold in the US, earning him a substantial sum. The &quot;Legs&quot; video was released in May 1984, driving the single into the Mainstream Rock Airplay charts the next month. A video was also released for &quot;TV Dinners&quot;, it was directed by Marius Penczner, and featured clay animation.

==Tour==
The Eliminator tour was a return to the larger-than-life scale of ZZ Top&#x27;s 1976–1977 Worldwide Texas Tour. From May to October 1983 the band toured the US, interrupted in August by several days in Ireland and the British Isles, playing Dublin and then Castle Donington: the Monsters of Rock concert. The European leg of the tour in October–November 1983 brought the band to Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, France, Belgium and back to the UK, including one added date at Wembley Arena to meet demand. The final leg of the tour picked up more dates in the US in early 1984. The band performed all four singles from &quot;Eliminator&quot; as well as selections from their earlier albums, closing the show with &quot;Tush&quot;. The &quot;Eliminator&quot; car was represented by an outsized replica, and the stage equipment included laser lights. At each concert on the final song, a smoke bomb was triggered, then parts of the lighting structure along with a mannequin roadie crashed down from the overhead grid to simulate a rigging failure. The stage itself was patterned after the dashboard of the vintage car.

==Critical reception==

Robert Christgau wrote that the album&#x27;s faster tempo produces &quot;boogie in overdrive... The videos make you smile, the record runs you over. That&#x27;s the pleasure of it.&quot; Writing for &quot;Record&quot;, Samuel Graham found it lacked variety compared to the band&#x27;s previous albums, but praised &quot;Gimme All Your Lovin, &quot;Legs&quot;, &quot;Thug&quot;, and &quot;I Need You Tonight&quot;. He wrote: &quot;We&#x27;ve heard most of this before. &quot;Eliminator&quot;, then, will probably satisfy ZZ Top&#x27;s boogie chillin&#x27; faithful. But it&#x27;s a lateral move at a time when Gibbons, Hill and Beard could be stepping forward.&quot;

A number of ZZ Top fans reacted negatively to the album. The prominent use of synthesizers and drum machines marked a significant change for ZZ Top, and drew speculation that Hill and Beard did not play on the album. Hill compared the reaction to Bob Dylan&#x27;s controversial move to rock music. However, the album attracted many new listeners, including teenage girls for the first time, and many teenage boys. &quot;Spin&quot; Glen O&#x27;Brien wrote in 1986 that the &quot;average ZZ Top fan&quot; was no longer a long-time follower but a young person who had discovered them through music videos. He said that &quot;ZZ Top is a joke [...] but they&#x27;re in on it. ZZ Top is like metal, but its blues roots are truer, and there&#x27;s no bullshit. ZZ Top is not into the devil, leather, chains, or angel dust. They&#x27;re into fun.&quot;

Retrospective opinions are largely positive, praising ZZ Top&#x27;s ability to match the spirit of the times. &quot;Guitar World&quot; wrote in 2002 that ZZ Top had been expected to fail in the MTV era, but that they &quot;surprised everyone with &quot;Eliminator&quot;, a brilliant merger of roadhouse blues and synthesizer swells and looped beats&quot;. The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; wrote in 2018 that it brought together Gibbons&#x27;s classic rock foundation and interest in new-wave synthesizers, retaining &quot;a sense of the Delta blues under all the technology&quot;. Critic Alan di Perna wrote in 2012 that &quot;ZZ Top had found the potent combination that would bring them into the eighties and their era of greatest commercial triumph: raunchy guitar sounds coupled with the pounding drive and unrelenting sex machine rhythmic precision of electronic dance music and synth pop&quot;.

The album spent 101 weeks on the Canadian album charts between April 16, 1983, and March 30, 1985.

In 2000, the album was voted number 355 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2005, it was listed in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; book of &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

<text>Sir Karl William Pamp Jenkins, , HonFLSW (born 17 February 1944) is a Welsh multi-instrumentalist and composer. His best known works include the song &quot;Adiemus&quot; (1995, from the &quot;Adiemus&quot; album series), &quot;Palladio&quot; (1995), &quot;The Armed Man&quot; (2000), his Requiem (2005) and his Stabat Mater (2008).

Jenkins was educated in music at Cardiff University and the Royal Academy of Music, and he is a fellow and an associate of the latter. He joined the jazz-rock band Soft Machine in 1972 and became the group&#x27;s lead songwriter in 1974. He continued to work with Soft Machine until 1984, but has not been involved with any incarnation of the group since. He has composed music for advertising campaigns and has won the industry prize twice.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Jenkins was born and raised in Penclawdd, Gower, Wales (now part of Swansea). His mother was Swedish, and his father was Welsh. He received his initial musical instruction from his father, who was the local schoolteacher, chapel organist and choirmaster. He attended Gowerton Grammar School.

Jenkins studied music at Cardiff University and then commenced postgraduate studies in London at the Royal Academy of Music.

===Early career: Graham Collier&#x27;s group and Nucleus===
For the bulk of his early career, Jenkins was known as a jazz and jazz-rock musician, playing baritone and soprano saxophones, keyboards and oboe, an unusual instrument in a jazz context. He joined jazz composer Graham Collier&#x27;s group and later co-founded the jazz-rock group Nucleus, which won first prize at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1970. In 1971, Jenkins collaborated with Linda Hoyle on her album &quot;Pieces of Me&quot;, co-writing 8 of the 11 tracks, playing piano and oboe, as well as arranging and conducting the orchestra.

===Soft Machine===
In 1972, Jenkins joined the Canterbury jazz fusion rock band Soft Machine, playing saxophone, oboe and flute along with keyboard instruments. The group played venues including The Proms, Carnegie Hall, and the Newport Jazz Festival. The album &quot;Six&quot;, on which Jenkins first played with Soft Machine, won the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; British Jazz Album of the Year award in 1973. Jenkins also won the miscellaneous musical instrument section (as he did the following year). Soft Machine was voted best small group in the Melody Maker jazz poll of 1974. The albums in which Jenkins performed and composed were &quot;Six&quot; (1973), &quot;Seven&quot; (1973), &quot;Bundles&quot; (1975), &quot;Softs&quot; (1976), &quot;Alive &amp; Well: Recorded in Paris&quot; (1978) and &quot;Land of Cockayne&quot; (1981). Jenkins was the group&#x27;s primary composer on &quot;Seven&quot; and the subsequent four albums.

After Mike Ratledge left the band in 1976, Soft Machine did not include any of its founding members, but kept recording on a project basis with line-ups revolving around Jenkins and drummer John Marshall. Although &quot;Melody Maker&quot; had positively reviewed the Soft Machine of 1973 and 1974, Hugh Hopper, involved with the group since replacing bassist Kevin Ayers in 1968, cited Jenkins&#x27; &quot;third rate&quot; musical involvement in his own decision to leave the band, and the band of the late 1970s has been described by band member John Etheridge as wasting its potential.

=== Other works===

In November 1973, Jenkins and Ratledge participated in a live-in-the-studio performance of Mike Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; for the BBC. It is available on Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; DVD.

==Works==
Jenkins has created advertising music, twice winning the industry prize in that field. From the 1980s, he developed a relationship with Bartle Bogle Hegarty, starting with composing musics for their Levi&#x27;s jeans &quot;Russian&quot; series. He composed a classical theme used by De Beers diamond merchants for their television advertising campaign focusing on jewellery worn by people otherwise seen only in silhouette. Jenkins later included this as the title track in a compilation called &quot;Diamond Music&quot;, and eventually created &quot;Palladio&quot;, using it as the theme of the first movement. Other arrangements have included advertisements for the Renault Clio.

As a composer, his breakthrough came with the crossover project &quot;Adiemus&quot;. Jenkins has conducted the &quot;Adiemus&quot; project in Japan, Germany, Spain, Finland, the Netherlands, and Belgium, as well as London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall and Battersea Power Station. The &quot;&quot; (1995) album topped the classical album charts. It spawned a series of successors, each revolving around a central theme. In 2014 Jenkins released a tribute song for the 2014 Winter Olympics, performed by his new age music group also called Adiemus.

Jenkins was the first international composer and conductor to conduct the University of Johannesburg Kingsway Choir led by Renette Bouwer, during his visit to South Africa as the choir performed his &quot;The Armed Man: A mass for peace&quot; together with a 70-piece orchestra. In November 2024, the &quot;Benedictus&quot; from the mass, was the subject of the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Soul Music&quot;.

Jenkins&#x27; choral work &quot;The Peacemakers&quot; was first performed in New York City&#x27;s Carnegie Hall on 16 January 2012. Jenkins conducted from the podium and John H. Briggs, Sr. conducted the Children&#x27;s Chorus from a seated position. The seventeen-movement piece features extracts from religious texts and works by notable humanitarians. A recording was released on 26 March 2012; it features the London Symphony Orchestra and several choirs, as well as guest vocalists and instrumentalists. Additional concerts in the UK and US took place later in the year.
Jenkins composed the music for the 2012 BBC Wales series &quot;The Story of Wales&quot; presented by Huw Edwards.

A work entitled &quot;The Healer – A Cantata For St Luke&quot; was premiered on 16 October 2014 (7:30 pm) in St Luke&#x27;s Church, Grayshott, Hampshire, and was recorded and broadcast on Classic FM. &quot;The Healer&quot; received its US premiere at Carnegie Hall, New York on 19 January 2015. In September 2015, the recording of the premiere of &quot;The Healer&quot; was released on CD by Warner Classics as part of the 8-disc boxed set &quot;Voices&quot;.

A compilation CD &quot;Still with the Music&quot; was also released in September 2015, coinciding with the publication of his autobiography of the same name.

On 8 October 2016 Jenkins&#x27; choral work &quot;Cantata Memoria: For the children&quot;, a response to the 1966 Aberfan disaster with a libretto by Mererid Hopwood and commissioned by S4C, premiered at the Wales Millennium Centre. The concert was broadcast the following evening on S4C and was released as an album by Deutsche Grammophon.

==Musical style==
===Lyrics===
Many of the songs written by Jenkins have specifically written phonetic lyrics, but they are not in any language. Instead, they are syllables intended to have a musical effect, but not to carry any specific meaning. This glossolalia is similar to the sounds of &quot;scat singing&quot;, except that this latter artform sometimes emphasises of-the-moment improvisation as well.

The composer has said the lyrics to his &quot;Adiemus&quot; series of songs are in &quot;an invented language&quot;, and have no particular meaning. He has observed, &quot;The text was written phonetically with the words viewed as instrumental sound, the idea being to maximise the melisma by removing the distraction, if one can call it that, of words”. Some listeners compare his lyrics to the Latin language, but other critics discount such a connection.

Other songs he has written use Biblical or literary texts for the lyrics.

==Awards and achievements==
Jenkins was awarded an honorary doctorate in music by the University of Wales in 2006. He has been made both a fellow (FRAM) and an associate (ARAM) of the Royal Academy of Music] in 2003, and a room has been named in his honour. He also has had fellowships at Cardiff University (2005), the Royal Welsh College of Music &amp; Drama, Trinity College Carmarthen and Swansea Metropolitan University. In 2022, he was elected as an Honorary Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales (HonFLSW).

In 2008, Jenkins&#x27; &quot;The Armed Man&quot; was listed as No. 1 in Classic FM&#x27;s &quot;Top 10 by living composers&quot;.

He has been awarded an honorary doctorate in music by the University of Leicester, the Chancellor&#x27;s Medal by the University of Glamorgan and honorary visiting professorships at Thames Valley University, London College of Music and the ATriUM, Cardiff.

Jenkins was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2005 New Year Honours and promoted to Commander of the same Order (CBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours, in both cases for services to music. In the 2015 Birthday Honours he was made a Knight Bachelor &quot;for services to Composing and Crossing Musical Genres.&quot;

Jenkins is joint president of the British Double Reed Society and Patron of the International Schools Choral Music Society (ISCMS).

In 2016, Jenkins received the BASCA Gold Badge Award for his unique contribution to music.

Jenkins&#x27; work (Welsh for Crossing the Stone) was performed at the coronation of King Charles III in 2023, with Jenkins in attendance.

<text>Howard Lewis Johnson (August 7, 1941 – January 11, 2021) was an American jazz musician, known mainly for his work on tuba and baritone saxophone, although he also played the bass clarinet, trumpet, and other reed instruments. He is known to have expanded the tuba’s known capacities in jazz.

Johnson was known for his extensive work as a sideman, notably with George Gruntz, Hank Crawford, and Gil Evans. As a leader, he fronted the tuba ensemble Gravity and released three albums during the 1990s for Verve Records; the first &quot;Arrival&quot;, was a tribute to Pharoah Sanders.

==Biography==
Howard Lewis Johnson was born on August 7, 1941 in Montgomery, Alabama, United States, but from the age of two was raised in Massillon, Ohio. A self-taught musician, he began playing baritone saxophone and tuba while still in high school. After graduating in 1958, he served in the U.S. Navy before moving to Boston, where he lived with the family of the drummer Tony Williams. He then spent time in Chicago, where he met Eric Dolphy, before moving to New York City in 1963.

In the 1960s he worked with Charles Mingus, Hank Crawford, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Archie Shepp, and Hank Mobley on the album &quot;A Slice of the Top&quot;. He also began a long association with Gil Evans in 1966. He was arranger of a horn section that backed Taj Mahal on Mahal&#x27;s 1971 live album, &quot;The Real Thing&quot;, which featured three other tubists/multi-instrumentalists, Bob Stewart, Joseph Daley and Earl McIntyre. Johnson also played with the Band on their &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; live album, &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; and into the new millennium with Levon Helm&#x27;s band.

During the 1970s, he was the live band conductor of the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; Band; he can be seen in several musical numbers, including playing bass saxophone in the &quot;King Tut&quot; sketch and leading his all-tuba band &quot;Gravity&quot; in a featured performance on Season 3, Episode 17. Gravity was perhaps his best-known band.

Johnson led three tuba bands, collaborated with Tomasz Stańko, Substructure, Tuba Libre, and Gravity. He has recorded frequently. In 1981, he performed at the Woodstock Jazz Festival, held in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Creative Music Studio. He had a minor role in the 1983 film &quot;Eddie and the Cruisers&quot; as Wendell&#x27;s replacement. He has also appeared in episodes of &quot;Matlock&quot; and &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;. In 1984, he appeared as part of the Gil Evans Orchestra, accompanying Jaco Pastorius at the Live Under the Sky festival in Japan.

Johnson played saxophone on &quot;The Muddy Waters Woodstock Album&quot; (1975) with Levon Helm, Garth Hudson, Paul Butterfield, Bob Margolin and Pinetop Perkins. 

Johnson accompanied James Taylor in a performance of &quot;Jelly Man Kelly&quot; on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in 1983, and also on tin whistle when Taylor sings to Oscar the Grouch.

== Personal life and death ==
Johnson was father to David and Nedra. David (1964–2009) was an actor in New York, and lived in Brooklyn. Nedra is a blues singer and musician. Johnson died on January 11, 2021, &quot;in his New York home&quot;.

<text>Economic cost is the combination of losses of any goods that have a value attached to them by any one individual. Economic cost is used mainly by economists as means to compare the prudence of one course of action with that of another. The comparison includes the gains and losses precluded by taking a course of action as well as those of the course taken itself. Economic cost differs from accounting cost because it includes opportunity cost. (Some sources refer to accounting cost as &quot;explicit cost&quot; and opportunity cost as &quot;implicit cost&quot;.)

== Aspects of economic costs ==

*Variable cost: Variable costs are the costs paid to the variable input. Inputs include labor, capital, materials, power and land and buildings. Variable inputs are inputs whose use vary with output. Conventionally the variable input is assumed to be labor.
**Total variable cost (TVC) is the same as variable costs.
*Fixed cost (TFC) are the costs of the fixed assets those that do not vary with production.
**Total fixed cost (TFC)
*Average cost (AC) are total costs divided by output. AC = TFC/q + TVC/q
**Average fixed cost (AFC) is equal to total fixed cost divided by output i.e. AFC = TFC/q. The average fixed cost function continuously declines as production increases.
**Average variable cost (A.V.C) = variable costs divided by output. AVC =TVC/q. The average variable cost curve is typically U-shaped. It lies below the average cost curve and generally has the same shape - the vertical distance between the average cost curve and average variable cost curve equals average fixed costs. The curve normally starts to the right of the y axis because with zero production
*Marginal cost (MC): Marginal cost is obtained from the additional cost that results from increasing output by one unit. It is the additional cost per additional unit of output.

*Cost curves: It is the graphical presentation of the costs of production as a function of total quantity produced

<text>The River Ogmore () is a river in South Wales that is popular with anglers. It runs generally from north to south from the Ogmore Vale and Gilfach Goch, past Bridgend and Ogmore. The River Ogmore rises at Craig Ogwr (527 m) in the Ogmore Valley as the Ogwr Fawr before it links with the Ogwr Fach at Blackmill. The River Llynfi, the River Garw and finally the River Ewenny in its estuary are all tributaries of the Ogmore which flows into the sea between Ogmore-by-Sea and the Merthyr Mawr sand-dunes.

== Geology and geography ==

The Ogmore has two major branches in its headwaters: the which flows south through Nantymoel, Ogmore Vale and Lewistown; and joining it from the east the which flows through . After the confluence with the , they join to form the at Blackmill.

Most of the headwaters flow over Carboniferous coal measures overlain by glacial drift and fluvial gravels. The valleys are reasonably broad for a small river, and many of the tributaries meandered through their valleys in the past. The considerable urbanisation, especially in the 19th century, confined most rivers to rather narrow artificial channels, bordered in places such as Bridgend with concrete flood protection walls.

==Major tributaries==

===River Llynfi===
The River Llynfi (), runs for around 10 miles from its source north of Maesteg and flows generally southwards through the Llynfi Valley to the confluence with the River Ogmore at Aberkenfig.

===River Garw===
The River Garw flows broadly north-south and runs through Pontycymer to its confluence with the Ogmore (Ogwr) at Brynmenyn.

===River Ewenny===

The Ewenny River () rises to the north-east of Bridgend town and flows through Pencoed and Coychurch before entering the River Ogmore estuary just below Ogmore Castle.

==Environment==
The industrialisation of the valley of the Ogmore by mining and heavy industry severely damaged much of the natural environment of the river. However, there has been an improvement in recent years and it supports a healthy population of aquatic invertebrates. The river does still have some problems though, including its proximity to major industrial plants, insensitive development and invasive weeds.

== River Clean Project ==
On 29 August 2023, 200 volunteers gathered at the banks of the Ogmore River to help remove 2,000 tyres from the river bed. This project was coordinated by a local dog walker with the support of 50 different partners/agencies/companies/local individuals. During the clean, 32 trolleys were removed from the river with nearly a tonne of waste plastic and metals. 

==Estuary==

Until the 1970s raw sewage was discharged directly to the estuary. The construction of the Sewage treatment plant in 1974 provided full treatment to the 30:20 standard. In recent years UV treatment has been added to substantially reduce the bacterial and viral load of the treated effluent. However, in periods of heavy rain, emergency outfalls pour into the river, releasing some sewage.

==Fishery==
In its industrial heyday, the Ogmore had no salmonid fish along much of its length, although brown trout survived in many of the smaller tributaries.

From the 1980s onwards, salmon and sea-trout started returning to the main river and the River Garw in ever-increasing numbers, but continued to avoid the chronically polluted Llynfi. However, even on the Llynfi, native brown trout numbers increased upstream of Tondu, and these were occasionally supplemented by stocked rainbow trout. In all parts of the river, trout can now be found, with salmon and sea trout almost everywhere. In addition eels remain common, and millers thumb, gudgeon, stone loach and minnow are found throughout.

<doc id="762254" wikidata="Q4801092" url="?curid=762254" title="Artificial noise">
<text>Artificial noise refers to waves, vibrations, audible sounds, electromagnetic signals, or other stimuli intentionally generated by human sources. Artificial noise is utilized in diverse contexts for different purposes. It plays a significant role in experimental research, urban environments, and sports, serving to either assess responses to controlled stimuli or enhance the atmosphere in various settings.

==Usage==

=== In Experimental Research ===
In experimental settings, artificial noise is a tool for examining how subjects respond to varying levels of stimuli. This involves manipulating the frequency or amplitude of noise to test, for instance, the efficacy of noise-reduction filters in microphones. Researchers generate specific noise patterns to determine if a device can differentiate between noise and non-noise signals effectively.

=== In Urban Environments ===
In cities, the term &#x27;artificial noise&#x27; often refers to sounds associated with human activity, such as traffic or light pollution. These noises are an unintended consequence of urban development and can affect the quality of life for residents.

==Usage in sports==
Initially, fan noise in sports came solely from supporters cheering for their teams. The tradition of employing cheerleaders and the subsequent use of megaphones, horns, and cowbells evolved to amplify this support. The introduction of compressed air horns further enhanced fans&#x27; ability to create noise. The strategic deployment of noise by fans, intended to distract opposing teams, became an integral part of sports culture, especially in college football where marching bands played a significant role.

The widespread availability of electronic devices capable of generating significant noise levels led sports leagues to regulate artificial noise. The aim was to maintain a balance between fan enthusiasm and the integrity of the game. Regulations were introduced to limit the use of electronic devices, horns, bells, and other noisemakers. Most leagues prohibited the use of recorded music during live play, following the National Football League&#x27;s example. Notable instances, such as the Indianapolis Colts being accused of using artificial noise against the New England Patriots, highlighted the challenges leagues faced in enforcing these regulations.

In specific sports, penalties are imposed for excessive artificial noise. For example, in football, a &quot;delay of game&quot; penalty may be issued, while in basketball, a technical foul can be called. The Arena Football League fined the San Jose SaberCats for distributing cowbells, demonstrating the enforcement of these regulations.

Despite bans, some fan groups, such as those of Mississippi State University in football, continue to use banned noisemakers like cowbells, showcasing the ongoing tension between fan traditions and regulatory efforts.

Artificial noise in sports, from its origins to its regulation, reflects the dynamic interaction between fan culture and sports governance. While designed to ensure fair play, regulations also respond to the evolving ways fans participate in and influence the sporting experience.

<doc id="762266" wikidata="Q2581283" url="?curid=762266" title="Williamson River (Oregon)">
<text>The Williamson River of south-central Oregon in the United States is about long. It drains about east of the Cascade Range. Together with its principal tributary, the Sprague River, it provides over half the inflow to Upper Klamath Lake, the largest freshwater lake in Oregon. The lake&#x27;s outlet is the Link River, which flows into Lake Ewauna and the Klamath River.

== Course ==
The Williamson rises from a large spring in central Klamath County, on the north side of Fuego Mountain, in the Winema National Forest, about northeast of Klamath Falls. A portion of the Williamson River is nicknamed Root Beer Falls &quot;because the water is laden with nutrients carried from the Klamath Marsh a few miles upstream&quot; and &quot;Foam that builds up at the base of the falls gives the appearance of a root beer float&quot;. ). It flows in a large arc north through the mountains, then west, then southwest through Klamath Marsh and the Klamath Marsh National Wildlife Refuge. Downstream of the refuge, the river flows roughly parallel to U.S. Route 97, receiving Spring Creek from the at Collier Memorial State Park, about north of Chiloquin. At Chiloquin, it receives the Sprague River from the at about river mile (RM) 11 (river kilometer (RK) 18). The Williamson enters the northern end of Upper Klamath Lake near Modoc Point, about northwest of Klamath Falls.

== Watershed ==
At lower elevations along big streams, the Williamson watershed supports irrigated pastures and other farmlands. Livestock grazing occurs in many locations in the basin. Forests, often cut for timber, cover about 81 percent of the basin and farms account for 6 percent, while range, wetlands, water, and urban areas cover a combined 13 percent. Precipitation in the basin, which lies in the rain shadow of the Cascade Range, averages a year along the Williamson above its confluence with the Sprague and about along the Sprague.

== Recreation ==
The Williamson is known for especially large wild Great Basin redband trout, which move into the river to spawn and to escape Upper Klamath Lake when it gets warm. Three-year-old fish &quot;commonly reach or better.&quot; Smaller numbers of brown trout also thrive in the Williamson, especially below Spring Creek. Lost River suckers also populate the river but are protected and cannot be caught and kept legally. Smaller rainbow trout and brook trout live in the river above Klamath Marsh. Much of the land along the river is privately owned, and public access is limited.

== History ==
Since 2003, The Nature Conservancy and other organizations have been working to restore about of wetlands in the Williamson River delta at the north end of Upper Klamath Lake. Formerly diked and drained for farming, the delta provides habitat for millions of migrating birds as well as many native species of fish, mollusks, and aquatic plants.

In early Pleistocene times, the Klamath Marsh and Upper Klamath lake were much larger; and were maintained as shallow lakes and marshes by the continued subsidence of the basin in the face of abundant sedimentation and uplift along the eastern fault scarp. The eruption of Mount Mazama about 7,700 years ago contributed an enormous amount of sediment to the lake and marsh basins, and filled the canyon of the Williamson River.

<doc id="762270" wikidata="Q540025" url="?curid=762270" title="William Lawes">
<text>William Lawes (April 1602 – 24 September 1645) was an English composer and musician.

==Life and career==
Lawes was born in Salisbury, Wiltshire and was baptised on 1 May 1602. He was the son of Thomas Lawes, a vicar choral at Salisbury Cathedral, and brother to Henry Lawes, a very successful composer in his own right. It is possible the young William was a member of the cathedral choir there.

His patron, Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, apprenticed him to the composer John Coprario, which probably brought Lawes into contact with Charles, Prince of Wales at an early age. Both William and his elder brother Henry received court appointments after Charles succeeded to the British throne as Charles I. William was appointed as &quot;musician in ordinary for lutes and voices&quot; in 1635 but had been writing music for the court prior to this.

Lawes spent all his adult life in Charles&#x27;s employ. He composed secular music and songs for court masques (and doubtless played in them), as well as sacred anthems and motets for Charles&#x27;s private worship. He is most remembered today for his sublime viol consort suites for between three and six players and his lyra viol music. His use of counterpoint and fugue and his tendency to juxtapose bizarre, spine-tingling themes next to pastoral ones in these works made them disfavoured in the centuries after his death.

When Charles&#x27;s dispute with Parliament led to the outbreak of the Civil War, Lawes joined the Royalist army. During the Siege of York, Lawes was living in the city and wrote at least one piece of music as a direct result of the military situation – the round &quot;See how Cawood&#x27;s dragon looks&quot;, a vivid and defiant response to the Parliamentarian capture of Cawood Castle, about ten miles from York. 
He was given a post in the King&#x27;s Life Guards, which was intended to keep him out of danger. Despite this, he was &quot;casually shot&quot; by a Parliamentarian in the rout of the Royalists at Rowton Heath, near Chester, on 24 September 1645.
Although the King was in mourning for his kinsman Bernard Stuart (killed in the same defeat), he instituted a special mourning for Lawes, apparently honouring him with the title of &quot;Father of Musick.&quot;
The author of his epitaph, Thomas Jordan, closed it with a lachrymose pun on the fact that Lawes had died at the hands of those who denied the divine right of kings:
Lawes&#x27; body was lost or destroyed and his burial site is unknown.

==Musical style==
Lawes&#x27; instrumental music is typical of the 17th-century genre in England. Intense rhythmical gestures and dissonant harmonies stand in stark contrast with the traditional rules of counterpoint such as practiced by previous composers which were known to Lawes, like William Byrd. His writing style is highly mannered, oft experimental and virtuosic; melodies may be fragmented and altered with varied articulation and accentuation. Lawes was known to be a virtuoso on the lyra viol. There as well his music features chromatic extremes which are not normally encountered in works of the early Baroque. Nevertheless, his works, including two compositions on the cantus firmus &quot;In nomine&quot;, show that he was aware of the theoretical practices of his day. 

He is particularly known for his ensemble dance music, which takes the form of suites called &quot;consort sets,&quot; well appreciated by his contemporaries and successors. Ten of these sets form a fine and varied collection called the &quot;Royal Consort&quot;, completed in 1635 for Charles I of England. This was issued in two versions: for two treble viols, tenor viol, bass viol and theorbo continuo; and, later, for two violins, two bass viols and two theorbos. Until recently the violin version was the better known, thanks to editing work done in the 1960s, but scholarship has revealed the four-viol version to be of much better quality, having been the original setting. Many of Lawes&#x27; consort sets seem to have been composed as functional music or pedagogical pieces.

<text>Claude Driskett Hopkins (August 24, 1903 – February 19, 1984) was an American jazz stride pianist and bandleader.

==Biography==
Claude Hopkins was born in Alexandria, Virginia, United States. Historians differ in respect of the actual date of his birth. His parents were on the faculty of Howard University. A talented stride piano player and arranger, he left home at the age of 21 to become a sideman with the Wilbur Sweatman Orchestra, but stayed less than a year. In 1925, he left for Europe as the musical director of The Revue Negre which starred Josephine Baker with Sidney Bechet in the band.

He returned to the US in 1927 where, based in Washington, D.C., he toured the Theatre Owners Booking Association circuit with The Ginger Snaps Revue, before heading once again for New York City where he took over the band of Charlie Skeets. At this time (1932–36), he led a Harlem band employing jazz musicians such as Edmond Hall, Fred Norman, Jabbo Smith and Vic Dickenson (although his records were arranged to feature his piano more than his band). This was his most successful period, with long residencies at the Savoy and Roseland ballrooms and at the Cotton Club. In 1937, he took his band on the road with a great deal of success.

The high-pitched vocals of Orlando Roberson (Orlando Herbert Roberson 1909–1977) were a feature of the band&#x27;s work. It included Ovie Alston, Fernando Arbello, Shirley Clay, Vic Dickenson, Edmond Hall, Arville Harris, Pete Jacobs, Sylvester Lewis, Ben Smith, and Jabbo Smith.

He broke up the band in 1940 and used his arranging skills while working for several non-jazz band leaders and for CBS. In 1948/9 he led a &quot;novelty&quot; band briefly but took a jazz band into The Cafe Society in 1950. From 1951 until his death, he remained in New York City, working mostly as a sideman with other Dixieland bands at festivals, New York clubs, and recording. He died on February 19, 1984.

<text>The Journeyman Project is a series of award-winning first-person science fiction adventure games, created by Presto Studios and released by various publishers, including Bandai, Sanctuary Woods, and Red Orb Entertainment.

== Plot ==
The central story is set centuries in the future, where after horrific nuclear wars humanity united to create a peaceful global society. Due to the establishment of a utopian society, humanity has been invited to join an alien organization known as the Symbiotry of Peaceful Beings.

In the twenty-fourth century, time travel is realized by the Journeyman Project, the secret program to construct Pegasus, the world&#x27;s first time machine. After a brief test period proves time travel is possible, the Journeyman Project is deactivated and the Pegasus device is put under the secret watch of the Temporal Security Agency or TSA for short (also the acronym of its base of operations, the Temporal Security Annex). The TSA exists to prevent temporal rips in the space/time continuum, by which changes in the past can alter the present. The player controls a character named Gage Blackwood, Agent 5 of the Temporal Security Agency. The games revolve around Agent 5&#x27;s exploits throughout time to save Earth in the present.

==Release history==
=== &quot;The Journeyman Project&quot; ===

In 1993, &quot;The Journeyman Project&quot; was one of the first PC games to use high quality rendered graphics. However, it suffered from performance problems and slow animations due to its early reliance on Macromedia Director. These problems were mostly overcome with the version 2.0 release that was retitled &quot;The Journeyman Project Turbo!&quot; and published by Sanctuary Woods in 1994.

The story begins with an alien ambassador arriving to finalize Earth&#x27;s admission into the Symbiotry of Peaceful Beings. However, when Agent 5 is on duty a temporal rip is detected, and Earth&#x27;s history is changed. The result of the new timestream is that humanity is passed over for admission into the alien organization.

=== &quot;The Journeyman Project 2: Buried in Time&quot; ===
Published in 1995 by Sanctuary Woods, &quot;Buried in Time&quot; was a complete shift in direction for the series, moving away from futuristic environments and instead preferring to go to real-life historical locations. The game also featured a completely redesigned interface and contained many more live-action scenes than the first game.

=== &quot;The Journeyman Project: Pegasus Prime&quot; ===

This complete remake of the original Journeyman Project was published by Bandai in 1997 with some of the actors from &quot;The Journeyman Project 2: Buried in Time&quot;. Originally announced as a &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, Pegasus Prime featured enhanced graphics, sounds, movies, and puzzles. It was released solely for the Power Macintosh by Bandai Digital Entertainment in North America, although it was also developed for the Apple Pippin and PlayStation in Japan. 3DO and Sega Saturn versions were also mentioned in the original product announcement, but are presumed to have been canceled.

In December 2013, the game was released on DVD-ROM for Mac OS X. Windows and Linux versions were made available in March 2014.

The game was released for digital download on GOG.com in 2014 and Steam in 2017.

=== &quot;The Journeyman Project 3: Legacy of Time&quot; ===

Published in 1998 by Red Orb Entertainment, the final installment uses a unique 360 degree interaction system without resorting to 3D effects. It featured impressive production values with the actors and costumes. One of the first games to be developed for the DVD-ROM medium, the enhanced DVD edition featured twice the resolution of the CD-ROM version.

In 1999, Red Orb Entertainment collected the Windows versions of &quot;The Journeyman Project Turbo!&quot;, &quot;Buried in Time&quot;, and &quot;Legacy of Time&quot; into an 8-disc trilogy box set.

=== &quot;The Journeyman Project 4: Resurrection&quot;===
According to IGN in late 1998, &quot;Mindscape confirmed that the rights of &quot;The Journeyman Project #4&quot; have been returned to the series&#x27; developer, Presto Studios&quot;, as a result of financial problems at Red Orb Entertainment. With the closure of Presto Studios in November 2002, there are no plans for more Journeyman Project games to be produced. However, a fourth game design document has been mostly written. The game was originally projected for an October 2000 release and the story &quot;illustrated one of the potentially dangerous outcomes of time travel technology&quot;, but the project was eventually put on hold to concentrate on &quot;Myst III: Exile&quot;.

== Characters ==
=== Main characters ===
*Gage Blackwood - Blackwood is Agent 5 of the Temporal Security Annex (later Temporal Security Agency) who is charged with using time machines only to guard history from people who would use time machines to damage history. On June 22, 2311 he graduated from the University of Melbourne with a master&#x27;s degree in world history with honors. On June 25, 2313 he graduated at the top of his class from the Special Forces Training Academy. Five days later he became the director of Tactical Teams for the Crime Intervention Commission. On March 12 of 2315 he transferred to the Temporal Security Annex of the CIC. Gage received the Paragon Medal for his performance in the line of duty on November 8, 2318, and on December 17 of that same year he was promoted to the rank of Captain of the Temporal Protectorate. He was later chosen to form and head the Deep Time Unit on July 1, 2325. In the first &quot;Journeyman Project&quot; game, the character was only addressed as &quot;Agent 5&quot; and was not represented by an actor. Todd McCormick played Gage in the remake of the first game, &quot;The Journeyman Project: Pegasus Prime&quot;, and in &quot;The Journeyman Project 2: Buried in Time&quot;. In &quot;The Journeyman Project 3: Legacy of Time&quot;, Blackwood was played by Jerry Rector.
*Michelle Visard - She is Agent 3 of the Temporal Security Agency, charged with protecting time from time travelers who want to change the events of history. She is also a member of the Deep Time Unit, a branch of the Temporal Security Agency which documents history. On February 11, 2310 she earned a black belt in karate. Three years later on April 4 she earned another in aikido. January 19 of that same year she won first place in the NIT intercollegiate gravball competition. On March 1, 2315 she was hired by the Temporal Protectorate, and on June 9, Visard graduated magna cum laude from Columbia University with a Ph.D. in pre-unification theory and a B.A. in social psychology. Ten years later on July 15 she transferred to the Deep Time Unit. In her free time, she enjoyed Symbiotry cultural exchanges, and existentialist literature. Actress Michele Scarabelli portrayed Visard in &quot;The Journeyman Project 2&quot;, &quot;The Journeyman Project 3&quot;, and &quot;Pegasus Prime&quot;, the 1997 remake of the first game.
* Dr. William Daughton - TSA Chief Engineer, played by Victor Navone in &quot;The Journeyman Project 2: Buried in Time&quot; and David Fenner in &quot;The Journeyman Project 3: Legacy of Time&quot;
* Jack Baldwin - TSA Commissioner, played by Daniel Mann
*Arthur - Arthur is an artificial intelligence created by Dr. Kenneth Farnstein on a derelict asteroid miner parked in the outer reaches of the solar system. Arthur was first introduced in &quot;Journeyman Project 2: Buried In Time&quot;. From the beginning, he was combination comic relief and interactive strategy or hint guide. In &quot;Buried in Time&quot;, he was present for a great deal of the game, and he returned in &quot;The Journeyman Project 3: Legacy of Time&quot; for essentially the entire game. Players would click upon icons in his interface, which would present themselves at certain times. One icon would dispense a quip or general observation, and another would dispense a hint, and often as not a quip as well. His skills and knowledge include his talent as an accomplished artist, knowledge about 20th century pop culture, and mastery of computers. For both &quot;The Journeyman Project 2&quot; and &quot;The Journeyman Project 3&quot;, Arthur&#x27;s voice was supplied by Matt Weinhold who also wrote additional dialog for his character.
*Dr. Elliot Sinclair - Dr. Sinclair is popularly known in the world of &quot;The Journeyman Project&quot; as &quot;the father of time travel&quot; because he invented the first time machine, a large device known as Pegasus. His pioneering work became the basis of, and &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; for, the Temporal Security Annex, which became the Temporal Security Agency. Dr. William Daughton later improved upon his initial work to create the JumpSuit time machines for the Temporal Security Agency. During most of the first part of the first game, &quot;The Journeyman Project&quot;, the player knows of Dr. Elliot Sinclair, if at all, only as the person who invented time travel. Only once the player is able to defeat one of the robots damaging history do they learn that Dr. Sinclair is the antagonist of the game. Dr. Elliot Sinclair spends the second game, &quot;The Journeyman Project 2&quot;, incarcerated in Vega Thalon, a prison colony on one of Saturn&#x27;s moons. He, his robotic henchmen, and the Pegasus device are occasionally referred to but are not relevant to the story. He returns to the storyline for &quot;The Journeyman Project 3&quot;, where Blackwood learns that Sinclair was born in Atlantis, which was destroyed by the Symbiotry in 1262 B.C, explaining Sinclair&#x27;s mistrust of them in the present. Although immortal thanks to an alien artifact hidden in Atlantis, Sinclair dies five days before the game begins, as his immortality slowly failed after leaving Earth. In all three games (although his entire appearance in the second game was portions of what he&#x27;d done in the first game) Dr. Elliot Sinclair was portrayed by Graham Jarvis.

<doc id="762280" wikidata="Q6250640" url="?curid=762280" title="John Norquist">
<text>John Olof Norquist (born October 22, 1949) is a retired American politician, urbanist consultant, and author. He served as the 43rd mayor of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, winning four terms (1988–2004). He previously represented Milwaukee&#x27;s south side in the Wisconsin State Assembly (1975–1983) and Wisconsin Senate (1983–1988). After serving as mayor, he worked for ten years as president of the Congress for the New Urbanism.

==Early life and career==
Norquist was born in Princeton, New Jersey, where his father was attending seminary.

He attended Augustana College in western Illinois for two years, then transferred to the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he graduated with his bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science in 1971. Shortly after graduation, he enlisted in the United States Army Reserve and was trained as a medic. Later that year, he went to work at Milwaukee Electric Tool, where he operated machinery on the assembly line and also served as a first aid attendant.

==Early political career==

While working at Milwaukee Electric Tool in 1974, Norquist launched a primary challenge against incumbent state representative Earl Keegan Jr., in Wisconsin&#x27;s 8th Assembly district. He ran against completing the Stadium South Freeway, which was to run from Milwaukee County Stadium south to I-894. In 1974, nearly 50% of the freeway segment was either built or the land was cleared for construction. Norquist defeated Keegan in the Democratic primary and faced no opposition in the general election. He continued to oppose the new freeway despite his constituents voting for completion in the November 1974 Milwaukee County freeway referendums (complementing the April 1967 city vote in favor of the Park East-Lake Freeway project).

In the Assembly, Norquist joined forces with emerging generation of legislators including James Moody (later a US representative) in opposing freeway expansion. Norquist was re-elected to three more terms in the Assembly before winning a seat in the Wisconsin Senate in 1982. While in the Senate, Norquist served on the powerful Joint Finance Committee and was recognized by Milwaukee Magazine as a leading legislator. He was re-elected to another term in the Senate in 1986 and served as Assistant Majority Leader in the 1985–1986 and 1987–1988 sessions.

While serving in the Senate, Norquist also attended graduate school at the University of Wisconsin and earned his Master&#x27;s in Public Administration in 1987.

==Mayor of Milwaukee==
In 1987, Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier announced he would not run for another term as mayor in 1988, and would leave office after 28 years in the role. Norquist announced his candidacy for mayor, advanced through the nonpartisan primary, and defeated former governor Martin J. Schreiber in the April 1988 general election, taking 54% of the vote.

Norquist can perhaps best be described as a &quot;fiscally conservative socialist&quot;. He was strongly in favor of light rail as a solution for the city&#x27;s transit problems and was known throughout the country for his anti-freeway stance and for the removal of the Park East Freeway, the largest highway ever purposely destroyed. He consistently reduced the property tax rate every year since becoming mayor and kept city budgets from growing beyond the rate of inflation.

One of the first controversies of Norquist&#x27;s tenure occurred in 1988, when he took a trip to Israel. The trip was paid for by local Milwaukee Jewish organizations, but as a result of the controversy, Norquist afterward paid much of the cost himself. On his return, the &quot;Milwaukee Sentinel&quot; printed a political cartoon showing him getting off a plane dressed as a Hasidic Jewish rabbi. The cartoon created an uproar, and the &quot;Sentinel&quot; published an apology for it.

In December 2000, Norquist&#x27;s future as mayor was thrown into doubt after a staff assistant alleged that the mayor had sexually harassed her. Norquist admitted to a five-year consensual affair, but whether it was consensual is contested. Eventually, in April 2002, Norquist announced that he would not seek a fifth term as mayor in 2004.

In July, 2001, when the Communist Party held its 27th national convention in the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee student union, Norquist sent the convention his greetings, noting commonalities between the city&#x27;s socialist heritage and the goals of the Communist Party. Norquist later released a statement saying he &quot;does not endorse Communist ideology and condemns many elements of Communist history.&quot;

When presented in June 2003 with the opportunity to lead the Congress for the New Urbanism, Norquist said that he would resign at the beginning of the following year rather than serve out his full term. The announcement was timed to prevent a special election. Instead, the head of the common council, Marvin Pratt, served as acting mayor.

His term was marked by public conflicts with other city leaders, including Bo Black, former head of Summerfest; Arthur Jones, his one-time bodyguard who became chief of police; and Bradley DeBraska, head of the police union. Despite some conflict, Norquist&#x27;s legacy in Milwaukee includes a decline in poverty, a boom in downtown housing, and reforms in both education and welfare.

==Post mayoral career==
At the beginning of 2004, Norquist began working full-time as the head of the Congress for the New Urbanism, an urban planning and development reform organization based in Chicago, Illinois. He left CNU in 2014 after a decade with the organization. During his tenure, he spoke often and eloquently about the regulatory obstacles that continue to get in the way of good urbanism. Building on his experience taking down the Park East Freeway in Milwaukee, he championed a national CNU campaign that has helped advocates and local officials in their own highway teardown movements. Norquist is now the John M DeGrove Fellow at Florida Atlantic University and adjunct professor at DePaul University Real Estate Program.

==Personal life and family==
John Norquist is a son of Rev. Ernest O. Norquist and his wife Jeannette Norquist. He is of Swedish descent.

He is married to Susan Mudd and has one son, Benjamin, and one daughter, Katherine. Susan is the descendant of Samuel Mudd, the doctor who treated President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s assassin, John Wilkes Booth.

<doc id="762283" wikidata="Q39898" url="?curid=762283" title="NSU Motorenwerke">
<text>NSU Motorenwerke AG, or NSU, was a German manufacturer of automobiles, motorcycles and pedal cycles, founded in 1873. Acquired by Volkswagen Group in 1969, VW merged NSU with Auto Union, creating Audi NSU Auto Union AG, ultimately Audi. The NSU is an abbreviation of the name Neckarsulm.

==History==

===Origin===
NSU originated as the &quot;Mechanische Werkstätte zur Herstellung von Strickmaschinen&quot;, a knitting machine manufacturer established in 1873 by Christian Schmidt, a technically astute entrepreneur, in the town of Riedlingen on the Danube. The business relocated in 1880 to Neckarsulm. There followed a period of rapid growth and in 1886, the company began to produce bicycles, the first of them a &#x27;high wheeler&#x27; or &#x27;Penny-farthing&#x27; branded as the &quot;Germania&quot;. By 1892, bicycle manufacturing had completely replaced knitting machine production. At about this time, the name NSU appeared as a brand name.

The first NSU motorcycle appeared in 1901, followed by the first NSU car in 1905. During World War I the company produced motorcycles and trucks for the German Army.

In 1932, under pressure from their bank (Dresdner Bank), NSU recognised the failure of their attempt to break into volume automobile production, and their recently built car factory in Heilbronn was sold to Fiat, who used the plant to assemble Fiat models for the German market. From 1957, NSU-Fiat cars assumed the brand name Neckar.

During World War II NSU produced the Kettenkrad, the NSU HK101, a half-tracked motorcycle with the engine of the Opel Olympia. They also made the 251 OSL motorcycle during the war.

=== After WW II ===
In December 1946, &quot;Das Auto&quot; reported the company had resumed the manufacture of bicycles and motor-bicycles at Neckarsulm. For Germany, this was a time of new beginnings, and in July 1946, a new board was appointed, headed by General Director Walter Egon Niegtsch, who earlier in his career had spent 17 years with Opel.

NSU motorbike production restarted, in a completely destroyed plant, with prewar designs like the Quick, OSL, and Konsul motorbikes; furthermore, the HK101 continued to be sold by NSU as an all-terrain vehicle in a civilian version. The first postwar model was the NSU Fox in 1949, available in 2-stroke and 4-stroke versions. In 1953, the NSU Max followed, a 250 cc motorbike with a unique overhead camdrive driven by reciprocating rods. All these new models had an innovative monocoque frame of pressed steel and a central rear suspension unit. Albert Roder, the chief engineer behind the success story, made it possible that in 1955, NSU became the biggest motorcycle producer in the world. NSU also holds four world records for speed: 1951, 1953, 1954, and 1955. In August 1956, Wilhelm Herz at the Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah, became the first man to ride a motorcycle faster than .

In 1957, NSU re-entered the car market with the new Prinz (Prince), a small car with a doubled NSU Max engine, an air-cooled two-cylinder engine of and . Motorbike production continued until 1968. NSU&#x27;s last production motorcycle was the Quick 50.

In 1964, NSU offered the world&#x27;s first Wankel engined car: the Wankelspider. In development of the project, NSU built the Sport Prinz, with a 2-rotor. In the same year Prinz 1000 and derivatives like the TT and TT/S followed. The Typ 110 (later called 1200SC) was launched in 1965 as a family car with a more spacious body design. The last NSU cars with a conventional four-stroke engine had the air-cooled OHC four-cylinder engine in common. The car was marketed in the U.K. as &quot;NSU TYP 110&quot;, and Karobes, a major supplier of car accessories, provided a head rest specially for this car: &quot;A new one which can be fitted without a screw, and may be adjusted forwards and backwards.&quot;

Also in 1964, NSU partnered with Citroën to develop the Wankel engine via the Comotor subsidiary, which resulted in the abortive 1973 Citroën GS Birotor production car.

In 1967, the four-door NSU Ro 80, with a version of the same 2-rotor, was presented to the public. Weighing , it had a Cd of 0.36, disc brakes, independent suspension, and front wheel drive by Fichtel &amp; Sachs &quot;Saxomatic&quot; three-speed transmission. It soon gained several design awards such as &quot;car of the year 1967&quot;, while drivers liked its performance. Virtually all the world&#x27;s major motor manufacturers purchased licenses from NSU to develop and produce the rotary-piston engine, with the notable exception of BMW.

Despite its public acclaim, sales of the Ro 80 were disappointing. The transmission drew complaints and the engine suffered numerous failures even at low mileage. Competitor automakers, apart from Mazda, held back from taking a lead in developing and marketing the Wankel technology, and anticipated income associated with those royalty deals failed to materialize.

===Volkswagen Group takeover===
The development of the rotary engine was very cost-intensive for the small company. Problems with the apex seals of the engine rotor significantly damaged the brand&#x27;s reputation amongst consumers. In 1969, the company was taken over by Volkswagenwerk AG, which merged NSU with Auto Union, the owners of the Audi brand which Volkswagen had acquired five years earlier. The new company was called Audi NSU Auto Union AG and represented the effective end of the NSU marque with all future production to bear the Audi badge (although retaining the four interlocking circles of Auto Union). The management of the new combine was initially based at the Neckarsulm plant, however when the small rear-engined NSU models (Prinz 4, 1000, 1200) were phased out in 1973, the Ro 80 was the last car still in production carrying the NSU badge. Audi never made use of the brand name NSU again after April 1977, when the last Ro 80 was sold. In 1985, the company name was shortened to Audi AG and management moved back to Audi&#x27;s headquarters in Ingolstadt.

Even as production of the Ro 80 continued in the Neckarsulm plant, production of larger Audi models like 100 and 200 was started. The Porsche 924 and later Porsche 944 were also assembled at Neckarsulm. Those models were joint venture projects of Porsche and VW, but Porsche did not have the internal capacity to build the 924 and 944. Currently, Neckarsulm is the production plant for Audi&#x27;s topline vehicles like A6, A8, and R8. It is also the home of the &quot;Aluminium- und Leichtbauzentrum&quot; where Audi&#x27;s aluminium-made space frame bodies are designed and engineered.

NSU is primarily remembered today as the first licensee and one of only four automobile companies to produce cars for sale with rotary-piston &quot;Wankel engines&quot;. NSU invented the principle of the modern Wankel engine with an inner rotor. The NSU Ro 80 was the second mass-produced two-rotor Wankel-powered vehicle after the Mazda Cosmo. In 1967, NSU and Citroën set up a common company, Comotor, to build engines for Citroën and other car makers. Norton made motorcycles using Wankel engines. AvtoVaz (Lada) manufactured single and twin rotored Wankel powered cars in the early 1980s. Only Mazda has continued developing the Wankel engine and made several more cars with the Wankel engine.
NSU developed their last car in a recognisably conventional layout, (front engine front wheel drive, water cooled) - this was the NSU K70, Volkswagen adopted this as their first water cooled front-engined car the VW K70. The first VW Golf cars used the NSU K70 engine which was almost identical. Subsequent VW models shared no lineage with NSU models, being descended from Auto-Union designs.

===Lawn mower engine===
In the early 1970s, NSU manufactured a vertical-crankshaft small engine for use as a lawn mower power unit.

===NSU Museum===
A museum in Neckarsulm, the Deutsches Zweirad- und NSU-Museum, has many of NSU&#x27;s products on display.

===Notable riders===
Mike Hailwood raced in 1958 on Ducati, NSU, MV Agusta, Norton, Triumph, Paton and in 1958 was 4th in the world championship 250cc (NSU) 5. John Surtees entered in the 1955 season. That year, he gained his first podiums on a Norton in 350cc in Germany and Ulster. He also won the round in 250cc while riding the best lap in the race for his only appearance at the handlebars of a NSU. John Surtees remains the only champion of the world in both motorcycle racing and Formula 1.

==NSU cars==
=== NSU- (and NSU-Pipe-) Cars 1905–1918 ===
The first NSU cars were the single cylinder 3-wheeled Sulmobil, first produced in 1905. At the same time NSU produced the NSU-Pipe 34 PS and NSU-Pipe 50 PS under licence from the Belgian firm of Pipe. Two further Pipe models were to follow, and a range of NSU-specific 3- and 4-wheeled models.

* NSU Ro 80 (1967–1977)
* NSU K70, produced after VW/Audi takeover as the Volkswagen K70 (1970–1975)

===Licence-built models made abroad===

The NSU Prinz was also built in Yugoslavia (by PRETIS), Argentina (by Autoar) and Egypt, under licence.

In Uruguay, the Prinz 4 was built by Nordex S.A., and a new model, the P6, combined the engine and mechanics of the NSU model with a separate body completely redesigned by Carlos Sotomayor. From 1970, the P10 was built as the successor model to the NSU P6. This had the larger engine of the NSU Prince 1000 and a 21 cm extended wheelbase. 
==NSU motorcycles and scooters==
The first &quot;Neckarsulmer Motorrad&quot; motorcycle was produced in 1901, using a Swiss Zedel single-cylinder AIV (automatic inlet valve) motor with battery/coil ignition, clamped at the underside of a heavy-duty bicycle frame (of NSU manufacture), with the crankcase slightly below and in front of the pedal crank. Specialized racing motorcycles were campaigned from 1905 in events in Europe, the UK, and USA. In 1907, British manager Martin Geiger rode an NSU in the inaugural Isle of Man TT, placing fifth. NSU had several successes in the Isle of Man TT races in the 1950s. In 1908, an NSU v-twin took part in the Ormonde-Daytona beach speed record races for cars and motorcycles, ridden by Eugene Gaestral, who returned with an improved machine the following year.

During the 1930s, and in the mid-1950s, NSU was the largest motorcycle producer of the world, in its peak year (1955) producing 350,000 machines. NSU holds four world records for speed: 1951, 1953, 1954 and 1955. In 1956, NSU brought a team of six motorcycles of different engine capacities to Bonneville, Utah, to set World Land Speed Records. They had success in all categories, and most notably raised the absolute motorcycle speed record to 211 mph, with Wilhelm Herz piloting the Delphin III, a fully streamlined motorcycle with a 500cc supercharged DOHC twin-cylinder Rennsport engine. This machine still exists, in the Audi Museum in Stuttgart, Germany.

The NSU Quickly was the most popular moped of its time. It was produced between 1953 and 1966 in over 1,000,000 examples and still can be found today all over the world as more than 60% were exported.

==NSU bicycles==
Bicycle production began in 1900 and continued into the early 1960s.

==NSU military vehicles==
NSU was the principal maker of the Kettenkrad halftracked motorcycle (1940–1949)
The Sd.Kfz. 2 was designed and built by NSU Motorenwerke AG in Neckarsulm, Germany. Designed and patented in June 1939, it was used for the first time during the invasion of the Soviet Union Operation Barbarossa in 1941.

<text>Rikard Nordraak (12 June 1842 – 20 March 1866) was a Norwegian composer. He is best known as the composer of the Norwegian national anthem, &quot;Ja, vi elsker dette landet&quot;.

==Biography==
Rikard Nordraak was born and grew up in Oslo, Norway. His family came from the Nordråk farm in the district Land in the county of Oppland. His father was a brother of Inger Elise Nordraach, the mother of the Norwegian writer and poet, Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson.
Nordraak&#x27;s musical gifts became evident at an early age, but as for many other artists at that time, a different career was already planned. He was going to pursue a career within business, and when he was fifteen he was sent to business school in Copenhagen. Nonetheless his musical interests prevailed and instead of studying business he ended up studying music, and in 1859 he went to Berlin for advanced studies. After six months he had to return home and he continued studies in Oslo, and his first compositions came during the winter of 1859–60. In 1861 he went back to Berlin to continue his studies, and he stayed there for two more years.

The compositions that he himself marked opus 1 were published in 1863, and contained six songs with texts by his cousin Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, amongst others. At this time Nordraak also composed &quot;Ja, vi elsker&quot;, which became the Norwegian national anthem. It was first performed publicly on 17 May 1864 in connection with the 50th anniversary of the Norwegian Constitution. The lyrics were written by Bjørnson between 1859 and 1868.

In 1864, he met Edvard Grieg in Copenhagen and inspired him with the idea of devoting his genius to Norwegian melody and the cultivation of a specifically national art. Nordraak later wrote incidental music for Bjørnson&#x27;s plays &quot;Maria Stuart i Skotland&quot; and &quot;Sigurd Slembe&quot;. He published his &quot;Fem norske Digte: Op. 2&quot;, consisting of songs and poems by Bjørnson and Jonas Lie. This was the last of his compositions that would be published during his lifetime.
In May 1865, he returned to Berlin to continue his education, but he was stricken with tuberculosis in October and died in Paris the following March, only 23 years old. He was buried in Kirchhof Jerusalem in the Berlin neighborhood of Kreuzberg (&quot;Friedhof IV der Gemeinde Jerusalem – und Neue Kirche&quot;). In 1925, Nordraak&#x27;s coffin was brought home to Norway and buried in the Honor Grove at Vår Frelsers gravlund in Oslo.

Nordraak did not live long enough to produce much music. About forty compositions, mostly smaller works like songs, pieces for male choir and a few piano compositions, have been preserved. The biggest of these compositions, is the &quot;Scherzo Capriccio&quot; for piano solo, given the opus number 3, published posthumously by Edvard Grieg. This is a kind of rondo, using several features from Norwegian folk music; rhythms typical in slåtter, and dissonances typical for the hardingfele. However, the thematic material does not have this connection with folk music. &quot;Rikard Nordraak. Samlede verker&quot;, a critical edition of Nordraak overall compositions were published by Øyvind Anker and Olav Gurvin (1942).

With his passionate patriotism and great love for folk music, Nordraak&#x27;s main contribution to Norwegian music history was to be an inspiration for contemporary composers, such as Grieg. When Grieg heard of Nordraak&#x27;s death, he composed the &quot;Funeral March in Memory of Rikard Nordraak&quot; (&quot;Sørgemarsj over Rikard Nordraak&quot;). Part of his life story was dramatised in the musical &quot;Song of Norway&quot;.

==Quotation==

Nordraak himself explained his musical faith in this way:

<text>CIBC Wood Gundy is the Canadian full-service retail brokerage division of CIBC World Markets Inc., a subsidiary of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC). Through its network of over 1,000 investment advisors working in 80 locations across Canada, CIBC Wood Gundy offers an array of investment and insurance products and services.

CIBC Wood Gundy was created in 1988 with the purchase of Wood Gundy by CIBC. From 1988 through 1997, CIBC Wood Gundy was the universal name of CIBC&#x27;s investment banking operations. However, after the acquisition by CIBC of the investment banking operations of U.S.-based Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in 1997, the combined investment banking business was renamed CIBC Oppenheimer and later CIBC World Markets. Since 1997, the name CIBC Wood Gundy has been used as the brand for CIBC&#x27;s retail brokerage business.

==History==

Wood, Gundy &amp; Company was established in Toronto, Ontario in 1905 by George Herbert Wood and James Henry Gundy. The firm first specialized in the distribution and underwriting of government and municipal bonds.

CIBC purchased a majority stake in Wood, Gundy &amp; Co. in June 1988 for C$203 million. At the time of its acquisition, Wood Gundy was the leading Canadian investment dealer. Following the acquisition, CIBC formed CIBC Wood Gundy, which offered primarily asset management services for corporate and institutional clients. Two years later, in 1990, they continued to expand the Canadian securities business by acquiring much of Merrill Lynch &amp; Company&#x27;s Canadian business.

In 1997, CIBC Wood Gundy acquired the U.S. brokerage house Oppenheimer &amp; Co. After the acquisition the U.S. division took the name CIBC Oppenheimer, eliminating the use of the Wood Gundy brand through much of the bank. The brand was retained for CIBC&#x27;s retail brokerage operations.

In December 2001, CIBC acquired the Canadian retail brokerage business of Merrill Lynch, Merrill Lynch Canada, for an estimated $409 million. The acquisition of Merrill Lynch Canada, which it subsequently merged with its CIBC Wood Gundy business, greatly increased CIBC&#x27;s own brokerage network, adding more than 1,000 brokers across Canada.

<doc id="762287" wikidata="Q187332" url="?curid=762287" title="Iraqi Interim Government">
<text>The Iraqi Interim Government was created by the United States and its coalition allies as a caretaker government to govern Iraq until the drafting of the new constitution following the National Assembly election conducted on January 30, 2005. The Iraqi Interim Government itself took the place of the Coalition Provisional Authority (and the Iraq Interim Governing Council) on June 28, 2004, and was replaced by the Iraqi Transitional Government on May 3, 2005.

==Organization==

The Iraqi Interim Government was recognized by the U.S., the United Nations, the Arab League and several other countries as being the sovereign government of Iraq (see Iraqi sovereignty for more information). The U.S. retained significant de facto power in the country and critics contend that the government existed only at the pleasure of the United States and other coalition countries and considered it a U.S. puppet government, whose military forces still remain in Iraq. 

===The law and the head of government===
The government&#x27;s head of government was Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and his deputy was the influential and charismatic Barham Salih. The ceremonial head of state was President Ghazi Mashal Ajil al-Yawer. 

Absent a permanent constitution, the new government operated under the Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period.

Allawi was a former member of the Iraq Interim Governing Council and was chosen by the council to be the Interim Prime Minister of Iraq to govern the country beginning with the United States&#x27; handover of sovereignty (June 28, 2004) until national elections, scheduled for early 2005. Although many believe the decision was reached largely on the advice of United Nations special envoy to Iraq, Lakhdar Brahimi, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that Brahimi only endorsed him reluctantly after pressure from U.S. officials, including Paul Bremer, the former US Iraqi Administrator. Two weeks later, Brahimi announced his resignation, due to &quot;great difficulties and frustration.&quot; Allawi is often described as a moderate Shia (a member of Iraq&#x27;s majority faith) chosen for his secular background and ties to the United States. However, his image has been undermined with the media suggesting that Allawi was Washington&#x27;s puppet.

==Actions of the Interim Government==
After his interim government assumed legal custody of Saddam Hussein and re-introduced capital punishment, Allawi gave assurances that he would not interfere with the trial and would accept any court decisions. In an interview with Dubai-based TV station al-Arabiya he said: &quot;As for the execution, that is for the court to decide—so long as a decision is reached impartially and fairly.&quot;

===&quot;Precedents&quot; and accusations===
In early July 2004, Allawi issued an unprecedented statement claiming that the Iraqi interim government had provided intelligence for the U.S. air strikers with 500 and 1000 pound (220 and 450 kg) bombs on Fallujah in July. Later he announced new security measures, including the right to impose martial law and curfews, as well as a new counter-terrorist intelligence unit, the General Security Directorate. Allawi vowed to crush the Iraqi insurgency, saying he would &quot;annihilate those terrorist groups&quot;.

On July 17, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; alleged that one week before the handover of sovereignty, Allawi himself summarily executed six suspected insurgents at a Baghdad police station. The allegations are backed up by two independent sources and the execution is said to have taken place in presence of about a dozen Iraqi police, four American security men and Interior Minister Falah al-Naqib. Allawi reportedly said that the execution was to &quot;send a clear message to the police on how to deal with insurgents.&quot; Both Allawi&#x27;s office and Naqib have denied the report. US ambassador John Negroponte did not clearly deny the allegations. On July 18, Iraqi militants offered a $285,000 reward for anyone who could kill Iyad Allawi.

===Allawi&#x27;s policies===
In August, Allawi closed the Iraqi office of Al Jazeera for thirty days. His minister Hoshiyar Zebari deplored the &quot;one-sided and biased coverage&quot; and declared that the interim government &quot;will not allow some people to hide behind the slogan of freedom of the press and media.&quot; Allawi also appointed ex-Baathist and former Saddam intelligence officer Ibrahim Janabi as the head of the Higher Media Commission, a regulator of Iraq&#x27;s media. The banning of Al Jazeera was widely criticised in the Arab world and the West, for example by Reporters Sans Frontières who called it &quot;a serious blow to press freedom&quot;.

The negotiations that followed the fighting between Muqtada al-Sadr&#x27;s militia and joint US/Iraqi forces in Najaf ended when Allawi withdrew his emissary Mouwaffaq al-Rubaie on August 14. An al-Sadr spokesman alleged that they &quot;had agreed with Rubaie on all points but Allawi called him back and he ended the issue.&quot;

===Criticism===
Allawi has been heavily criticised by members of his own government. Justice minister Malik Dohan al-Hassan resigned over the issue of an arrest warrant of Ahmed Chalabi. Vice president Ibrahim al-Jafari commented on the attacks against al-Sadr: &quot;War is the worst choice, and it is only used by a bad politician.&quot; Another Iraqi official said: &quot;There are brush fires burning out of control all over the place from terrorists and insurgents, and he starts a new bonfire in Najaf.&quot;

While the strategy of &quot;eliminat[ing] Moqtada Sadr&#x27;s political movement&quot; by &quot;crushing his military power&quot; instead of integrating him into the political process received mostly praise in the West, the Arab press levelled harsh criticism of Allawi&#x27;s handling of the Najaf situation.

<text>The Piro people were a Native American tribe who lived in New Mexico during the 16th and 17th century. The Piros (not to be confused with the Piros of the Ucayali basin in Peru) lived in a number of pueblos in the Rio Grande Valley around modern Socorro, New Mexico, USA. The now extinct Piro language may have been a Tanoan language. Numbering several thousand at the time of first contact with the Spanish, by the time of the Pueblo Revolt in 1680 the Piro had been decimated by European-introduced diseases and Apache attacks and most of the survivors resettled near El Paso, Texas.
==History==
The Piro were closely related to the Tompiro who lived to their northeast in the Salinas region of New Mexico. Linguists believe both groups likely spoke Tanoan languages. When the Spanish first encountered them in the 16th century, the Piro lived in the Rio Grande River valley for a distance of about from north to south in present-day Socorro County. Beyond the narrow ribbon of green along the Rio Grande the surrounding hinterlands are desert. 
The Piro people, along with several other Pueblo peoples, were probably descendants of the Mogollon culture, the Ancestral Pueblo people, and the Casas Grandes peoples. These cultures flourished until about 1450 CE in a large area of the Southwestern United States and Northwestern Mexico. The 15th-century Piro population was likely seven thousand people. The Piro&#x27;s largest town, called San Pascual Pueblo by the Spanish, had 1,500 rooms and a population of about 2,000 people.

Some Piros were hospitable to the first Spanish colonists who arrived in 1598. As a result, the Spanish gave first one, then another, Piro pueblo the name &quot;Socorro&quot;, which means &quot;aid&quot; or &quot;help&quot; (in case of problems or difficulties). By the late 17th century, however, the Piros like most other Pueblo groups suffered increasingly from the strains of colonial rule. Several local rebellions broke out in the 1660s and 1670s, but the Spaniards always retained the upper hand. By the time of the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, the Piro communities had declined so much that the famous rebellion took place without them. Several hundred Piros (and Tiwas) accompanied the fleeing Spaniards south to El Paso del Norte (present-day Ciudad Juárez, Mexico); others scattered and joined other Pueblo groups. None of the Piro pueblos were ever resettled by the original inhabitants.

Today, the Piro people are part of the Piro/Manso/Tiwa Indian Tribe of the Pueblo of San Juan de Guadalupe in Las Cruces, New Mexico as well as in Tortugas Pueblo.

Currently, there is a long-term archaeological project at the Piro pueblo of Tzelaqui/Sevilleta north of present-day Socorro.

<doc id="762301" wikidata="Q5983814" url="?curid=762301" title="Luis Lopez, New Mexico">
<text>Luis Lopez is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Socorro County, New Mexico, United States. It lies between Socorro and San Antonio along the Rio Grande.

==History==

In 1667, Captain Luis López was &quot;alcalde mayor&quot; (mayor) of the Piro Pueblo of Senecú. It appears that he had a hacienda on the east bank of the Rio Grande. During the 18th century, the estancia was mentioned in the journals of a few travellers, though it had been abandoned after the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. The village of Luis Lopez appears to have been founded by the early to mid 1830s. At that time, it was located on the west bank of the Rio Grande, just east of its present-day site.

Luis Lopez has been listed in censuses every decade at least as recently as 1980 since 1850, except for 1870. Since the village was not counted in that year, it is thought that it may have been abandoned for a short time and then relocated to its present position above the flood plain. However, most of Luis Lopez remains in the flood plain, protected from the Rio Grande by levees. In May 1941, severe flooding required the evacuation of families in the floodplain.

Luis Lopez was also listed in both the 1833 and 1845 New Mexico censuses, details of which can be found at Albuquerque Public Library, Main Library, second floor Genealogy Center.

In 1952, the Luis Lopez School District was consolidated with the Socorro School District and the school was closed. However, the building continued to be used as a community center for some years.

Today, the community of Luis Lopez consists of farms and a small suburb. New wells have brought growth to the community. The community is a suburb of Socorro.

==Education==
It is within Socorro Consolidated Schools. Socorro High School is the comprehensive high school of the district.

<doc id="762302" wikidata="Q772298" url="?curid=762302" title="Homeless shelter">
<text>Homeless shelters are a type of service and total institution that provides temporary residence for homeless individuals and families. Shelters exist to provide residents with safety and protection from exposure to the weather while simultaneously reducing the environmental impact on the community.

They are similar to, but distinguishable from, various types of emergency shelters, which are typically operated for specific circumstances and populations—fleeing natural disasters or abusive social circumstances. Extreme weather conditions create problems similar to disaster management scenarios, and are handled with warming centers, which typically operate for short durations during adverse weather.

== Homeless population ==

===Health issues===
Hundreds of homeless individuals die each year from diseases, untreated medical conditions, lack of nutrition, and exposure to extreme cold or hot weather. In a mild-wintered San Francisco in 1998, homeless people were purportedly 58% more likely to perish than the general population. In New Orleans, approximately 10,000 homeless were unaccounted for after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Residents of homeless shelters may also be exposed to bed bugs which have been growing more prevalent in countries such as the United States, Canada and in Europe. Some residents of shelters have reported sleeping in roach-infested spaces at various shelters.

Researchers have found that homeless people are at high risk for respiratory tract diseases, such as tuberculosis, peripheral vascular disease, dermatology problems, and infectious diseases, including sexually transmitted diseases. These high rates are attributed to environmental pollution and other risks associated with street life, including trauma, poor nutrition, a lack of access to personal hygiene facilities, and crowding and debilitation, which increase the risk of infectious disease. Besides physical health problems, homeless people are also at great risk of mental health issues resulting from alcohol and drug abuse as a lack of societal concern and care. These issues are also related to public health. Without proper housing, these infectious diseases have a higher rate to affect other people in society.

In Washington, D.C., statistics indicate that 63% of homeless people suffer from a lack of access to regular bathing. Another estimated 58% within the same city are unable to obtain sufficient levels of sleep. Areas such as showers and bathrooms in shelters often have restricted access with limited hours. Homeless individuals also have great trouble finding storage locations for their belongings. Homeless individuals in the United States are subject to being arrested and held in jail for &quot;quality of life&quot; violations or for public intoxication. In Hawaii, homeless people are banned from sitting or lying on the streets.

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, homeless shelters were recommended to use a &quot;whole community approach&quot; and to provide sufficient communications relevant to the pandemic.

=== LGBT+ community ===
The LGBT homeless are at increased risk of violence compared to other groups. Transgender people are also at danger of being placed into the incorrect shelters. In some cases, transgender women can be turned away from women&#x27;s shelters. This can place their safety at risk.

=== Men ===
In a national survey conducted in the United States the findings showed that of the surveyed homeless, two-thirds are men and most likely to be single adults between the ages of 25 and 54.

Young men who have been abused as children are more likely to become homeless and are at risk of becoming chronically homeless if they are not living in a permanent situation by age 24.
Poverty has been shown to have a large effect on men&#x27;s health in general, leading to an extremely unhealthy lifestyle. Some of the challenges include low self-esteem, weakening, mental strain and poor physical and health. Although women tend to have higher poverty rates, men still experience the same negative effects.

=== Women ===
Women are at great risk of both homelessness and poverty because they are most likely to bear child-rearing responsibilities and vulnerable to become victims of family members or intimate partners.

Homeless women, both those with children and without, experience higher rates of physical illness than men. They are also more likely to be hyper-vigilant and have high levels of stress. Women seeking refuge from domestic violence are not always able to find rooms in shelters. Some women have been turned away from homeless shelters because shelter staff believe that turning women away will stop people from having sex inside the shelter.

Homeless women who are of childbearing age also face unique hygiene issues because of menstruation. Homeless shelters have noted that both tampons and sanitary pads &quot;top the list of needs at shelters&quot; because of their high cost and because they are not donated often.

== Alternative models and management philosophies ==

=== Housing first practice===
The homeless shelters across the country act merely as emergency shelter systems that can only hold a fraction of the rapidly increasing homeless population. The Housing First practice provides an alternative to the current network of homeless shelters. The program targets the large problem within the United States which is a lack of affordable housing. This methodology attempts to place homeless families back into independent living situations as quickly as possible. The Housing First practice has achieved success because homeless families are more responsive to social services support once when they are in their own housing. It provides crisis intervention, affordable rental housing, and gives each family a grace period of six months to a year of social service to allow the family to get back on their feet. The effectiveness of this concept is that it assists homeless families in identifying their needs and recognizing the choices they must make. From this point families can create better options for themselves and plan strategies for living on their own.

===Religious shelters===
The Rescue Mission in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is an example of helping homeless people through religion. In order to receive a free meal at the Rescue Mission, residents must first attend a Christian prayer service. The Salvation Army is a social support service organization that also functions as a religious group.

=== Vehicles as shelter ===
Around the late 2000s, in Santa Barbara and other areas in California, groups of recently homeless began to camp out in their cars in parking lots with the coordinated support of a local non-profit group. These individuals and families were often unable to afford rent or mortgage, but still had jobs, cars, insurance and other types of support structures. In Santa Barbara, an estimated 55 individuals camped out every night in various private and public lots, some reserved for women only. As more people began to camp in their vehicles, California cities began to pass laws against sleeping in vehicles, like the 2013 ordinance passed in Palo Alto. However, many of these laws in different municipalities were later struck down in higher courts as unconstitutional, like the Los Angeles ban which was judged by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2014. Some cities chose to repeal their own bans on sleeping in vehicles. In Los Angeles in 2015, approximately 9,500 homeless have turned their cars into homes. In Hawaii, a Honolulu-based company is retrofitting five retired city buses into mobile shelters which provide a place to sleep and get a shower.

== Community attitudes ==
Community attitude towards homeless shelters varies widely, but one study found that older people, men, homeowners and all people making larger incomes were often averse to the concept of homeless shelters in general. Calgary neighborhoods recognize the need for shelters, but many do not want to situate a shelter near their own homes. A similar response came from residents in Oahu. In communities such as Portland, Oregon, where the weather can be quite harsh, there is an extensive network of supporters. These operate an informal restaurant, the &quot;Sisters of the Road&quot; cafe, which supports both homeless shelter residents and also some unsheltered persons. At the opposite end of the spectrum, jurisdictions such as Santa Barbara, California, feature ongoing disputes in an often highly adversarial mode. Disputes have occasionally escalated to such schemes as re-arranging benches on city sidewalks to discourage panhandlers. In another 2011 incident, an eight unit supportive housing project which had been approved was called back onto city council agenda the following week in order to allow approximately 35 public comments pro and con, despite the fact that the measure had just been approved.

There have at times been concerns raised about the transmission of diseases in the homeless population housed in shelters, although public health professionals contend that such concerns are inflated. In addition, a study published in 2014 conducted in Marseille, France, found that respiratory illnesses in homeless shelters were not significantly different from the general population. In addition, during the peak influenza months, the shelter occupants did not test positive for the flu virus and the researchers hypothesize that being isolated from others may have been the reason they were virus-free. However, outbreaks of tuberculosis in have been reported occurring in shelters within three large Ohio cities in the 1990s.

A question has been raised as just how much money donated to the charities that run the shelters actually gets to the homeless people and the required services. In many cases, there is a large overhead in administrative costs, which compromise the money for their homeless clients.

=== Internal problems in homeless shelters ===
There is sometimes corruption and theft by the employees of a shelter as evidenced by a 2011 investigative report by FOX 25 TV in Boston wherein a number of Boston public shelter employees were found stealing large amounts of food over a period of time from the shelter&#x27;s kitchen for their private use and catering. Residents have reported that personal items, such as underwear, were stolen by other residents while they were occupied.

Shelters can become dangerously overcrowded when too many occupants are allowed entry to the shelter.

Shelters sometimes are unable to meet state standards for occupancy, such as testing fire sprinklers or ensuring that exits are clearly marked. In New York City, 2015, the state withheld funding from many shelters which did not meet standards or which had poor conditions.

Shelter employees are sometimes at risk from violence perpetrated by the residents they are serving. In order to address problems faced by employees who are trying to help homeless people in New York, the Department of Homeland Security increased security at some shelters and conducted security assessments of shelters in 2015. While many employees of shelters know that there is a risk when working in high-crime neighborhoods or with individuals who are mentally ill, they continue to work at homeless shelters because they feel that they are performing a public service akin to the police or firefighters.

=== External problems ===
Several problems emerge when a homeless shelter is present. Homeless shelters have been argued by some to have a negative effect on nearby businesses. Businesses for years have complained that they frequently witness pedestrians being stopped outside their stores by homeless people begging for money. Such instances have led to the creation of local laws that prohibit &quot;aggressive panhandling&quot;. Another problem is that it is often difficult to decide on where a homeless shelter should be built and how to zone the area where a shelter can be built.

Some neighborhoods, as well as schools, argue that homeless shelters bring in bad elements to their surroundings, or that they fail to provide job training or education that would assist the homeless population with gaining their own housing. Some fear that drugs and alcohol may be present in homeless shelters; most shelters prohibit residential use of illegal drugs and alcohol, but enforcement is sporadic in many locations. Lastly, no classification system for shelters has been put into effect. There are no mechanisms or facilities to separate those who have mental illnesses from the rest of the shelter population.

In Vancouver, Washington, residents and businesses near the homelessness navigation center started experiencing elevated crime levels shortly after the center opened in 2019. A study was conduct by a crime analyst and it found that while the total crime in a cluster of five neighborhoods did not go up, a significant shift in their distribution was observed. Shortly after the homeless service center was established, a significant hotspot of localized crime have formed around the immediate vicinity of the center. A business in close proximity to the center reported a loss of 40-60% in sale, and issues such as tents being pitched right in front of their business. The navigation center provides transients with restrooms, showers, laundry, storage, clothing, a place to charge their phone as well as a mailing address. One business experienced having power outlet locks torn off twice. Others report vagrancy issues in residential streets near the navigation center after it closed at 5PM.

== Countries ==

=== Australia ===
In Australia, due to government funding requirements, most homelessness services fill the role of both daytime and night time shelters. Shelters develop empowerment based &quot;wrap around&quot; services in which residents are case managed and supported in their efforts to become self-reliant. An example of such a service provider in this area in Australia is Najidah.

Youth refuges in Australia provide both a residential setting for crisis accommodation as well as case management to assist young people to live independently. Youth refuges are a relatively new form of homeless shelters. In New South Wales the early refuges include Caretakers Cottage, Young People&#x27;s Refuge, Taldamunde Youth Services, all founded in the mid-1970s.

=== Canada ===
Canada has an estimated homeless population somewhere between 150,000 and 300,000 people as reported in 2014. Canada has responded to an increase in homelessness by increasing the amount of shelter space available to individuals. A study done in Canada also found that individuals entering shelters and drop-in centers experienced a loss of their own sense of personhood. Therapeutic Conversation therapy has been tested and found successful in Calgary with a small group of homeless shelter residents in improving their mental health outcomes. Calgary has seen an increase in the amount of homelessness, partly due to the &quot;lack of affordable rental units&quot;.

A nationwide volunteer group in Canada, the Angels in the Night, sponsored by Invis-Mortgage Intelligence, donates cold-weather clothes and other supplies to homeless people, visiting shelters and individuals on the streets.

In 2015, Clean the World began a Canadian Operations Center in Montreal order to supply soap for homeless shelters. Clean the World distributes and recycles hygiene supplies such as soap and shampoo.

=== China ===
In China, homeless estimates vary, since the Social Welfare Department does not consider those living in temporary shelters to be &quot;homeless&quot;. There may be approximately 1 to 1.5 million homeless children who have left their families because of extreme poverty, family issues or abuse.

Homelessness in China is mainly attributed to natural disasters, migration, and discrimination. It is not uncommon for natural disasters in China to displace many people from their homes. Unlike other countries, China has an extremely high amount of homeless children. Children make up nearly one million of those experiencing homelessness in China. It is estimated that about half of these children are runaways, who are hoping to escape abusive or impoverished homes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of homeless people has been increasing, and this is a cost of China&#x27;s zero-covid policy. Because of the strict lockdown policy in China, people are restricted from leaving or going back to their residences. A lot of essential workers like delivery men are forced to become &quot;homeless&quot; because they cannot go back to their apartments or houses as they have a greater risk of spreading the virus. In Shanghai during the pandemic, nearly 20,000 delivery riders are facing a lack of shelter and safety.

In 2014, a government-sponsored shelter in Henan province which houses 20 homeless individuals was under scrutiny for tying children to trees and providing inadequate sleeping areas.

=== India ===
India defines homelessness as not being in residence of a &quot;census house&quot; which must constitute a structure with a roof.

In India, youth can become homeless because of child abandonment. Youth in Jammu and Kashmir who live in shelters reported high prevalence of emotional and physical abuse, and emotional and physical neglect while living in homeless shelters.

Homeless individuals and families in India face challenges accessing water and hygiene services. A 2011 Census of India found that safe drinking water coverage in urban areas is at 91.9% while regular sanitation access is at 81.4%. There is a significant lack of housing in major urban areas in India. People come from the rural part of India to look for work and when there are no accommodations for housing build their own shelters, often known as &quot;hutments&quot;.

==== Statistics of homeless population within India ====
According to the 2011 Census, there were 1.77 million homeless people in India, or 0.15% of the country&#x27;s total population. In India, the cities with the greatest number of homeless individuals and families are Greater Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, and Bangalore.

===Iran===
Tehran municipality has three shelters and one female shelter in district 2 a total room of 4000. There are two active shelters in Qazvin, Sanandaj, and Zahedan. Isfahan has a shelter with 5000 beds. They are mostly run by charities or NGOs. Homeless people are often allowed to use them from one to two days. Homeless trans people aren&#x27;t allowed in these shelters.

=== Japan ===
The number of homeless individuals in Japan as recorded in 2003, was around 25,296. Numbers of those without homes have been &quot;increasing dramatically&quot; since the &quot;bubble economy&quot; collapsed in the 1990s. In Tokyo, around 2007, many homeless individuals were cleared out of their temporary residences in city parks. In 2011, the earthquake and tsunami left many individuals homeless and living in shelters.

=== United Kingdom ===
&quot;Sleeping rough&quot; or &quot;rough sleeping&quot; is terminology in the United Kingdom for sleeping without shelter. In addition, &quot;not all homeless people are entitled to housing.&quot; Shelters like &#x27;Jimmy&#x27;s&#x27;, in Cambridge, provide access to those who would otherwise be &quot;sleeping rough&quot;, offering temporary accommodation and support services in the basement of a Baptist church in the city centre.

=== United States ===
In the United States, the &quot;shelter movement&quot; began to grow significantly during the 1970s when there was a high rate of unemployment, housing costs were rising and individuals with severe mental illnesses were being deinstitutionalized. In the 1980s, homelessness was becoming a &quot;national epidemic&quot; in the United States and helping professionals created shelters as &quot;temporary havens&quot;. Shelter occupation had more than doubled by the late 1980s and it doubled again by 2000. Statistics from 2011 show that &quot;on a given night in January 2010, 407,966 individuals were housed inside homeless shelters, transitional housing or on the streets. Alternatively, jails have been used for healthcare enrollment by citizens in certain states.

Homeless shelters need to provide a variety of services to diverse residents. Homeless shelters, like La Posada Providencia in San Benito, Texas, may also house asylum seekers, mainly from Mexico, Central America and South America. Shelters also provide outreach to residents who are unable to use a shelter or who choose not to use a shelter.

Most shelters typically expect residents to exit in the morning and occupy themselves elsewhere during the day, returning for an evening meal and to sleep. During times of inclement weather, shelters may provide services outside of their normal hours.

In the United States, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has shown in recent studies that about 5 million Americans qualify to use homeless shelters. As poverty levels continue to rise, it is estimated that the number of homeless shelters, in particular in the United States, will continue to rise. Based on a survey of 24 U.S. cities the average stay in a homeless shelter was found to be on average about seven months out of the year.

Homeless encampments have become commonplace in US cities, particularly in cities with highly visible homeless populations – most notably Seattle and San Francisco. These efforts can result from a combination of complaints by wealthier (usually newer) residents and anti-homeless political actions originating from local mayors and legislators.

==== Statistics of homeless population within the United States ====
A study by the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty estimates that 2.3 to 3.5 million Americans experience homelessness annually. Alaska, California, Nevada, Oregon, Colorado, and Hawaii are the states with the highest concentration of homeless people. Around 1.5 million children or one of out every 50 children in America are homeless. Many Americans suffer from the state of &quot;chronic homelessness&quot;, which is where an individual has a disabling condition who has been continuously homeless for over a year or has been homeless on at least four different instances within four years. About 23% of the homeless population has been tagged as &quot;chronic homeless&quot;. Veterans also represent close to 40% of homeless men within the United States. Racial demographics of the homeless population of the United States can be represented as:

* Whites: 39%
* African-Americans: 42%
* Hispanics: 13%
* Native Americans: 4%
* Asians: 2%
Approximately 40% of all homeless youth in the United States identify as LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender). In San Francisco, approximately 29% of all homeless people in that city are on the LGBT spectrum. The National Center for Transgender Equality reports that 1 in 5 transgender individuals has experienced being homeless at least once in their lives.

Pet ownership among homeless people varies, but estimates indicate that about 5 and 10 percent of homeless people in the United States have a pet.

Homelessness appears to be largely concentrated within urban areas. Central cities hold 71% of the homeless population while the suburbs have 21% of the homeless population. Only 9% of homeless people are located within rural areas.

==== Operations and role in U.S. society ====
Shelters which are funded by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) require residents to have identification.

==== List of national organizations in the U.S supporting homeless shelters ====
Across the United States there are several national organizations that assist in the founding and the upkeep of homeless shelters. The main national organizations are: 
* National Alliance to End Homelessness
* The Salvation Army
* The Department of Veterans Affairs
*Covenant House
*Feeding America

==== United States libraries ====
Homeless shelters often work with other organizations in order to support and help homeless people improve their situations, including libraries. They often work with the coalition to grant a temporary library card for homeless coalition members who can use a shelter as a local address. This is intended to give new patrons the opportunity to utilize the computer services, books, programs, and more that the library offers.

==== Government assistance programs in the United States ====
HUD estimates that it costs $60,000 each year to house a homeless family in a shelter. Because of this, HUD has various programs in place to help families, including rapid rehousing and permanent housing vouchers. Housing vouchers from HUD are considered especially important for helping to prevent families with children from becoming homeless and also to help these families be able to leave the shelter system permanently.

<text>St Mary&#x27;s University College is a university college in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

==History==
The origins of the College can be traced back to 1900 when the Dominican Sisters opened St Mary’s Training College on the present Falls Road campus with an enrollment of 100 women students. For nearly 50 years after that, the college was concerned with the education of women students and their preparation for teaching in primary schools.

In 1948, four-year courses for post-primary teachers were introduced and, by arrangement with Queen’s University, Belfast, selected students could follow a combined course of university study and professional training.

In 1949 a men&#x27;s department was established at Trench House. In 1961 it ceased to be the men&#x27;s department of St Mary’s Training College and was constituted St Joseph’s Training College.

In 1968 the Senate of Queen’s University granted St Mary’s and St Joseph’s recognition for the instruction of matriculated students of the university in courses leading to the degree of Bachelor of Education.

In the 1970s, however, there was a decline in teacher education when the government decided, in response to falling school enrolments, to reduce the supply of teachers, and the Catholic bishops decided to amalgamate St Mary’s and St Joseph’s.

The new college, called St Mary’s University College, came formally into existence in September 1985.

From 1994 to 1996, a major programme of building and refurbishment was undertaken on the Falls Road campus. In June 1996 Trench House closed its doors for the last time, and the entire College was relocated on the newly extended and enhanced Falls Road campus.

==Academics==
The institution is located on the Falls Road in Belfast, and has approximately 60 academic staff and students (). The institution offers courses at undergraduate and postgraduate levels for teacher training, especially for a Catholic ethos, including a PGCE for Irish Medium Education. The college diversified its offerings several years ago and now offers a BA degree in liberal arts as well.

The university college&#x27;s legacy institutions have been associated with Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, since 1949. Since 1968 Queen&#x27;s degrees have been obtainable by St Mary&#x27;s students.

The Chairman of the Board of Governors is, ex-officio, the Bishop of the Diocese of Down and Connor. This is currently the Most Reverend Alan McGuckian of the Diocese.

==Facilities==
The college has steadily expanded its facilities. In 2023 it opened developments at the Cardinal Newman Library, Tobar Mhuire, and the Beechmount Hall, Aonach na bhFeá.

==People associated with St Joseph&#x27;s College==
A number of prominent people trained as teachers in St Joseph&#x27;s. They include the poet Seamus Heaney and dramatist Brian Friel, as well as the former SDLP MP and deputy first minister Seamus Mallon, and Tyrone Gaelic football manager Mickey Harte. The television presenter Frank Mitchell was a student there and the broadcaster Gerry Kelly taught there. Teacher and trade unionist Gerry Quigley studied at St Joseph&#x27;s.
Bishop Michael Dallat, who was lectured in St Mary&#x27;s, served as principal of St Joseph&#x27;s and was involved in the amalgamation of the two institutions.

<doc id="762311" wikidata="Q586350" url="?curid=762311" title="Ray Noorda">
<text>Raymond John &quot;Ray&quot; Noorda (19 June 1924 – 9 October 2006) was a U.S. computer businessman. He was CEO of Novell between 1982 and 1994. He also served as chairman of Novell until he was replaced in 1994.

==Early life==
Noorda was born in Ogden, Utah, the third son of Dutch immigrants Bertus Noorda and Alida Margaretha van den Berg. He attended Weber State College in Ogden. During World War II, he served in the U.S. Navy for two years as an electronics technician, working with radar systems. He graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in engineering from the University of Utah in 1949. Noorda worked for General Electric from graduation until 1971, after which he worked at a number of California companies.

==Personal life==
Noorda was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He married Lewena &quot;Tye&quot; Taylor in 1950, and they were later sealed in the Salt Lake Temple. Among the positions that Noorda held in the LDS Church were counselor in a branch presidency and counselor in a stake Sunday school presidency.

==Novell==
In 1983, Noorda assembled the SuperSet team whose members included Drew Major, James Bills, Dale Niebaur and Kyle Powell. The team was originally assigned to create a CP/M disk sharing system, but instead came up with a successful file sharing system for the newly introduced IBM-compatible PC. This network operating system was later called Novell NetWare.

Under Noorda&#x27;s watch, Novell acquired several companies and products with the goal of countering Microsoft&#x27;s rapid spread into new markets, including Digital Research, Unix System Laboratories, WordPerfect, and Borland&#x27;s Quattro Pro. Microsoft CEO Bill Gates claimed that Noorda had a &quot;tremendous vendetta&quot; against Microsoft and that Noorda had supported the Federal Trade Commission&#x27;s antitrust investigations of Microsoft in the early 1990s that led to a consent decree restricting its operating system licensing practices.

Noorda ran Novell until 1993. He was succeeded by Robert Frankenberg in 1994.

Around 1992, Noorda used the term co-opetition to characterize Novell&#x27;s business strategy.

==Later career==
Up to his death, Noorda owned the Canopy Group, which he had founded in 1992 through the Noorda Family Trust (NFT Ventures, Inc.). One of its holdings, Caldera, purchased the Unix assets in 2000 from the Santa Cruz Operation, which had acquired them from Novell in 1995. In 1996, it also acquired the Digital Research assets from Novell and immediately brought a lawsuit against Microsoft that largely duplicated the claims that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Department of Justice had pursued in the early 1990s. The lawsuit was ultimately settled in 2000 with a $280 million payment to Caldera.

Noorda received honorary doctorates from the University of Utah in 1994 and Weber State University in 1995. As a consequence of age and associated health issues (Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and heart disease), Noorda did not participate in the day-to-day management of Canopy&#x27;s affairs after 1998.

Noorda was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1995.

Noorda had four sons and one daughter. His daughter committed suicide in 2005. Noorda died on 9 October 2006 at his home in Orem, Utah, at the age of 82.

<doc id="762314" wikidata="Q516522" url="?curid=762314" title="Peter Noone">
<text>Peter Blair Denis Bernard Noone (born 5 November 1947) is an English singer-songwriter, musician and actor. He was the lead singer &quot;Herman&quot; in the 1960s pop group Herman&#x27;s Hermits. 

==Early life==
Noone was born in Davyhulme, Lancashire, England, the second of five children, the son of two accountants, and attended English Martyrs (Urmston), Wellacre Primary School (Flixton), Stretford Grammar School, and St Bede&#x27;s College, Manchester. In an interview, Noone made this comment about his early years: &quot;My parents had zero input in my career other than to teach me to be independent and to always be honest, steadfast and true and I was steadfast often. I was able to have a perfectly normal teen life ...&quot; 

Noone studied voice and drama at St. Bede&#x27;s College and at the Manchester School of Music, where he won the Outstanding Young Musician Award.

==Career==
===Herman&#x27;s Hermits===
Early in his career, he used the stage name Peter Novac. At 15, he became the lead singer, spokesman and frontman of Herman&#x27;s Hermits, who were discovered by Harvey Lisberg. As &quot;Herman&quot;, the photogenic Noone appeared on the cover of many international publications, including &quot;Time&quot; Magazine&#x27;s 1965 collage showing new faces in popular music. The Hermits consisted of Noone, Derek “Lek” Leckenby and Keith Hopwood (guitars), Karl Green (bass) and Barry Whitwam (drums).

The band&#x27;s hits included: &quot;I&#x27;m into Something Good&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t You Hear My Heartbeat&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Brown, You&#x27;ve Got a Lovely Daughter&quot;, &quot;Silhouettes&quot;, &quot;Wonderful World&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Henry the Eighth, I Am&quot; (in the U.S.), &quot;There&#x27;s a Kind of Hush&quot;, &quot;Just a Little Bit Better&quot;, &quot;A Must to Avoid&quot;, &quot;Listen People&quot;, &quot;The End of the World&quot;, &quot;Dandy&quot;, and &quot;No Milk Today&quot;. Herman&#x27;s Hermits sold more than 60 million records and had 14 gold singles and seven gold albums. The Hermits were twice named in the U.S. trade paper &quot;Cashbox&quot; as &quot;Entertainer of the Year&quot;.

As Herman, Noone performed on hundreds of television programmes and appeared with the Ed Sullivan, Jackie Gleason, Dean Martin and Danny Kaye television programs. He starred in ABC&#x27;s musical version of &quot;The Canterville Ghost&quot;, Hallmark Hall of Fame&#x27;s presentation of the classic &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (in which he played the title role), and three feature films for MGM: &quot;Mrs. Brown, You&#x27;ve Got A Lovely Daughter,&quot; &quot;Hold On!&quot; and &quot;When The Boys Meet The Girls&quot;.

They were the opening act of the 1970 Royal Variety Performance from the London Palladium performing a medley of their hits to date followed by their rendition of If I Were a Rich Man, Where is Love? and Old Henry&#x27;s Fish and Chips. They ended with their recent hit There&#x27;s a Kind of Hush.

===Solo work===
After Herman&#x27;s Hermits disbanded in 1971, Noone recorded four singles for UK RAK Records, one single for UK and US Philips, and several singles for the small UK record label, Bus Stop Records. His first RAK single, &quot;Oh You Pretty Thing&quot;, peaked at No.12 in the UK Singles Chart and No. 100 in Australia. It was written by David Bowie, who also played piano on the track. In 1973, Noone made a guest appearance on &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot; television show.

In 1974, Noone scored a No. 15 US AC and No. 33 Canadian AC() success with &quot;Meet Me on the Corner Down at Joe&#x27;s Cafe&quot; on the Casablanca Records label. Earlier in the year, his &quot;(I Think I&#x27;m Over) Getting Over You&quot; had reached No. 63 in the Canadian AC charts. In 1989 he had a No. 19 US AC hit with his solo recording of Goffin and King&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m into Something Good&quot; from the film &quot;The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!&quot;. In the 1980s, Noone released a solo album, &quot;One of the Glory Boys&quot;. 

In the 1990s, Noone hosted a television programme, &quot;My Generation&quot;, on 
VH1 (British and Irish TV channel), featuring retro music; the programme lasted four years. 

As an actor, Noone played a number of roles on television, including that of Stanley Fairclough in the soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, leaving that role in 1961. Noone also starred as &quot;Frederick&quot; in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; on Broadway in the 1980s, and later, at the Drury Lane Theatre in London’s West End. He reprised that role again during a US tour and international touring productions. He also appeared in &quot;Romance/Romance&quot; as Alfred Von Wilmers in the U.S. National Tour of the Broadway hit.

In 2019, Noone won the “Entertainer of the Year” award at the Casino Entertainment Awards in Las Vegas.

===The Tremblers===
Noone led a short-lived group called the Tremblers that toured in 1980 and released one album, &quot;Twice Nightly&quot;. Along with Noone, the members of the band were Greg Inhofer (keyboards), Robert Williams (drums, formerly with the Pop), George Conner (lead guitar), and Mark Browne (bass). According to the liner notes of the album, several musicians provided &quot;licks &amp; tricks,&quot; including members of Tom Petty&#x27;s Heartbreakers, Elton John&#x27;s backing band, Daryl Dragon, Phil Seymour and Dave Clark. &quot;Modern Recording&quot; magazine reviewed the album unfavorably, maintaining that the music bogged down in &quot;power pop careening into bubblegum&quot; songs that were not different enough from each other: adolescent lyrics delivered at the same fast tempo, recorded with an uninteresting, barely stereo sound field.
===SiriusXM===
As of January 2023, Noone hosted a weekly, three hour programme of 1960s music and reminiscences on SiriusXM&#x27;s 60s Gold station titled &quot;Something Good&quot;, titled after the hit song, &quot;I&#x27;m into Something Good&quot;.

===Herman&#x27;s Hermits revived===
Since the 1980s, Noone has performed under the name &quot;Herman&#x27;s Hermits starring Peter Noone&quot;. In 2023, the group was scheduled to perform 108 concerts &quot;mostly in the USA, Canada and Mexico. Some UK, some France.&quot;

==Personal life==
Noone married Mireille Strasser on 5 November 1968, his twenty-first birthday, and has one daughter, Natalie.

<doc id="762316" wikidata="Q1243407" url="?curid=762316" title="Dean Macey">
<text>Dean Macey (born 12 December 1977) is an English athlete from Canvey Island. He is best known for competing in the decathlon, which he did from 1995 to 2008, winning the Commonwealth Games decathlon, two World Championship medals, as well as twice finishing fourth in the Olympic Games. Retiring from decathlon due to injury, he competed in the bobsleigh between 2008 and 2010.

A popular media figure during and after his athletics career, he is a keen angler and has presented an angling television series &quot;On Coarse&quot; for the Discovery Channel, and &quot;Fishing Allstars&quot; on ITV4. He has also set a record time (0:56) on the Total Wipeout Qualifier.
After his athletics and bobsleigh careers being a keen Angler he went on to make a series of fishing videos on YouTube and was sponsored by Guru.

==Track and Field career==
Macey was born in Rochford, Essex. He started out in athletics as a high jumper, triple jumper and javelin thrower but graduated up through the octathlon to settle on the decathlon. He was also on the books of Arsenal as a youngster but gave up football to train for the World Junior Championships in 1995. Macey&#x27;s major breakthrough was when he won silver medal at the 1999 World Championships in Athletics in the Olympic Stadium, Seville, Spain with a personal best of 8556 points finishing behind gold medallist Tomáš Dvořák of the Czech Republic. Macey was the inaugural winner of BBC Sports Personality of the Year Young Personality in 1999.

The following year at the 2000 Summer Olympics, Sydney, Australia, after an injury ravaged year, Macey recorded another personal best score of 8567 points but could only finish fourth. The title was won by Estonian, Erki Nool but only after an appeal when earlier in the day the referee overruled his field judges and ruled out Erki&#x27;s discus throw of 43.66 metres. The appeal was successful and the Estonian took gold ahead of the Czech, Roman Šebrle and American Chris Huffins.

Macey was back amongst the medals at the 2001 World Championships in the Commonwealth Stadium, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, improving on his personal best yet again, with 8603 points finishing with the bronze medal, once again behind Tomáš Dvořák (gold medal), and Erki Nool (silver medal).

Injuries forced Macey to miss the 2002 Commonwealth Games, held at the City of Manchester Stadium, Manchester, England and all other major competitions until making his comeback at Hexham, England, July 2004. He worked for BBC TV during the Commonwealth Games.

His score in Hexham of 7842 points was, purposely, just enough to meet the B qualifying standard of 7700 for the upcoming Summer Olympic Games.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece Dean performed well, in view of the recent years away from competition, but with a possible medal in his grasp, a below par pole vault and javelin throw once again left him in fourth place at an Olympic competition behind Roman Šebrle (gold), Bryan Clay (silver) and Dmitriy Karpov (bronze).

At the 2006 Commonwealth Games, despite still nursing some injuries, Macey led after the first day with a personal best of 15.83 metres in the last round of the shot put. Over the course of the second day, that gap was reduced and overhauled by the Australian Jason Dudley because of injury-hampered performances in the 110 m hurdles and the javelin. Going into the final event, the 1500 metres, Macey needed to score 38 points more than Dudley to claim gold. He completed the event in 4:34.22, which gave him the gold medal by 69 points. Dean finished with a total of 8,143 points, ahead of the Jamaican Maurice Smith (silver) and Dudley (bronze).

In 2008 after a failure to reach the B Qualifying standard for the 2008 Olympic Games, at the Hexham International Combined Events Meeting, Macey admitted that he was considering his future. Young decathlete Daniel Awde was selected for the Olympics. On 15 July, he decided to retire from athletics. Macey wrote a regular Olympic column in the Southend Echo newspaper entitled &quot;Deano&#x27;s Diary&quot; in which he shared his views on the Beijing Games.

In 2009, Dean Macey completed the Men&#x27;s Health Survival of the Fittest 10 km run in Edinburgh, Scotland, recording a time in excess of 1 hour 15 minutes.

Macey worked as part of the commentary team for Radio 5 Live&#x27;s coverage of the 2010 Commonwealth Games and Al Jazeera Sports&#x27; coverage of the 2010 Asian Games, as well as Channel 4&#x27;s screening of the 2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships.

==Bobsleigh career==
After his retirement from athletics, Macey accepted a challenge to attempt to qualify for the 2010 Winter Olympics in the bobsleigh. He trained with former sprinter Jason Gardener. The pair finished sixth in the two-man event at the 2008 British Bobsleigh Championships held in Cesana Pariol, Italy. Subsequently, he worked for Eurosport as a regular part of the commentary team for the channel&#x27;s bobsleigh coverage.

<text>Charles Henry Noll (January 5, 1932 – June 13, 2014) was an American professional football player and head coach. Regarded as one of the greatest head coaches of all time, his sole head coaching position was for the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL) from 1969 to 1991. When Noll retired after 23 years, only three other head coaches in NFL history had longer tenures with one team.

After a seven-year playing career that included two NFL Championships as a member of his hometown Cleveland Browns and several years as an assistant coach with various teams, in 1969 Noll took the helm of the then moribund Steelers (which had played in only one post-season game in its previous 36 years, a 21–0 loss), and turned it into a perennial contender. As a head coach, Noll won four Super Bowls, four AFC titles and nine Central Division championships, compiled a overall record, a 16–8 playoff record and had winning records in 15 of his final 20 seasons. His tenure was defined by a dominant Steelers team, built on the legendary &quot;Steel Curtain&quot; defense and a potent offense. With Terry Bradshaw at quarterback, Franco Harris], Lynn Swann, and John Stallworth led the attack, while defensive greats Joe Greene, Jack Lambert, and Mel Blount anchored one of the most feared units in NFL history. His four Super Bowl victories rank second behind Bill Belichick for the most of any head coach in NFL history, and are the most ever by a head coach without a Super Bowl loss.

Between his playing and coaching tenures, Noll won a total of seven NFL Championships as well as one AFL Championship and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1993, his first year of eligibility.

Noll built the team through astute drafting and meticulous tutoring. During his career, he was notable for the opportunities he gave African Americans, starting the first black quarterback in franchise history and hiring one of the first black assistant coaches in league history. He was often credited with maintaining the morale of Western Pennsylvania, despite the region&#x27;s steep economic decline in the late 20th century, by creating a team of champions in the image of its blue-collar fan base.

==Early life==
Noll was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the youngest of three siblings (by eight years) of William Noll, a butcher, frequently unable to work owing to Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and Katherine Steigerwald Noll, a florist. The family lived in the house Noll&#x27;s mother grew up in with her 12 siblings, near East 74th Street, in a neighborhood with a large African-American population, a fact that helps account for Noll&#x27;s early championing of opportunity for African Americans in the NFL (both players from traditionally black colleges and later as coaches).

On a local youth football team Noll played with Harold Owens, the nephew of Olympic star Jesse Owens.
Noll attended Benedictine High School. He began working in seventh grade and by the time he entered high school, he had saved enough for two-year&#x27;s worth of the $150 tuition. Throughout high school he continued to work, making 55-cent an hour at Fisher Brothers meat market after school. Education was always important to him, so despite the schedule, he studied enough to graduate 28th in his class of 252.

==Playing career==
Noll played running back and tackle on the high school football team, winning All-State honors. During his senior year, he was named to the &quot;All Catholic Universe&quot; team by the Diocese of Cleveland newspaper. Noll was also a wrestler while in high school.

Noll planned to attend Notre Dame, but during a practice before his freshman year he suffered an epileptic seizure on the field. Notre Dame coach Frank Leahy refused to take the risk of allowing Noll to play there and so Noll accepted a football scholarship to the University of Dayton. Noll graduated with a degree in secondary education. As a member of the Flyers, he was a lineman, linebacker and a co-captain, and acquired the nickname, the &quot;Pope,&quot; for his &quot;&#x27;infallible&#x27; grasp of the game.&quot;

===Cleveland Browns===
Noll was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the 20th round of the 1953 NFL draft (239th overall). During his first year, the Browns lost to the Detroit Lions in the NFL championship. The next two years, however, the Browns were NFL champions, and Noll finished his NFL career with eight interceptions, three fumble recoveries, and a touchdown on one of each.

Although the undersized Noll was drafted as a linebacker, Coach Paul Brown used him as one of his &quot;messenger guards&quot; to send play calls to the quarterback, beginning with Otto Graham. Brown recalled that Noll soon &quot;could have called the plays himself without any help from the bench. That&#x27;s how smart he was.&quot; According to Art Rooney, Jr., director of scouting for the Steelers before and during most of Noll&#x27;s tenure, Noll felt demeaned by Brown&#x27;s use of him in that way and &quot;disliked the term &#x27;messenger boy&#x27; so much that as coach of the Steelers he entrusted all the play calling to his quarterbacks.&quot;

Noll was paid only $5,000 per season with the Browns and so while there he acted as substitute teacher at Holy Name High School and sold insurance on the side. During that period Noll also attended Cleveland-Marshall College of Law at night. He told Dan Rooney that he decided against becoming a lawyer because &quot;he didn&#x27;t really like the constant confrontation and arguments that come with being a lawyer.&quot;

When Noll lost the starting guard position to John Wooten, he chose to retire at age 27 expecting to begin his coaching career at his &quot;alma mater&quot;. He was surprised, however, when he was not offered an open position on the University of Dayton coaching staff. He was offered a position by Sid Gillman on the staff of the Los Angeles Chargers, during its inaugural season.

==Coaching career==

Noll was an assistant coach for the American Football League&#x27;s then Los Angeles and later San Diego Chargers from 1960 to 1965. He then became assistant to head coach Don Shula of the NFL Baltimore Colts from 1965 to 1968, when he was selected as the Pittsburgh Steelers&#x27; head coach.

=== Los Angeles/San Diego Chargers ===
Noll is considered part of Sid Gillman&#x27;s coaching tree. He later remembered Gillman as &quot;one of the game&#x27;s prime researchers and offensive specialists. In six years, I had more exposure to football than I normally would have received in 12 years.&quot; During Noll&#x27;s six-year tenure with the Chargers, where he was defensive line coach, the defensive backfield coach and defensive coordinator, the team appeared in five AFL championship games. Gillman said that Noll &quot;had a great way with players,&quot; specifically &quot;If a guy didn&#x27;t do the job expected, Chuck could climb on his back.&quot; Massive defensive tackle Ernie Ladd said that Noll was a &quot;fiery guy&quot; but also &quot;the best teacher I ever played under.&quot; &quot;He and I were always fighting, always squabbling, but he had a great way of teaching. I take my hat off to Chuck. He was one of the main reasons for our success.&quot; The defensive line under Noll became known as the &quot;Fearsome Foursome,&quot; and during 1961 defensive end Earl Faison was named AFL rookie of the year.

During Noll&#x27;s time at Chargers, Al Davis was also an assistant and scout. Davis would later become coach and general manager of the Oakland Raiders, the principal AFC rival of the Steelers&#x27; in the 1970s.

=== Baltimore Colts ===
With the Colts, Noll was defensive backfield coach and later defensive coordinator. Together with assistant coach Bill Arnsparger the Colts employed shifting alignments of rotating zone and maximum blitz defensive packages. In 1968, Noll&#x27;s last season as defensive coordinator, the Baltimore Colts compiled a 13–1 record in the regular season and tied the NFL season record for fewest points allowed (144).

Shula was impressed by Noll&#x27;s approach: &quot;He explained how to do things and wrote up the technique. He was one of the first coaches I was around that wrote up in great detail all of the techniques used by players—for example, the backpedal and the defensive back&#x27;s position on the receiver. He was like a classroom teacher.&quot;

The Colts won the NFL championship by routing the Cleveland Browns 34–0 in Cleveland, but were shocked by the upstart AFL champion New York Jets, 16–7, in Super Bowl III at the Orange Bowl in Miami. The next day, Noll interviewed for the head coach position in Pittsburgh.

=== Pittsburgh Steelers ===

At age 37, Noll was named the 14th head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers on January 27, , after Penn State coach Joe Paterno turned down an offer for the position. At the time of his hiring, he was the youngest head coach in the NFL. Steelers owner Art Rooney would later credit Don Shula as the person who recommended Noll as a head coach.

Noll inherited a struggling team that had yet to record a postseason victory and regularly trotted out short-term coaches with Noll being the 16th coaching change in the 36 years of the franchise&#x27;s existence. In his first season as head coach, Noll led the Steelers to their worst season to date in franchise history, finishing with a 1–13 record. This record allowed for the Steelers to hold the first overall pick in the 1970 NFL draft which the team used to select Louisiana Tech quarterback Terry Bradshaw.

Prior to the 1970 season, Noll cut much of the team&#x27;s roster. Laying the foundation for the coaching style he later became known for, Noll told the team, &quot;The reason you&#x27;ve been losing is you&#x27;re not any good. You&#x27;re not fast enough, you&#x27;re not strong enough, you&#x27;re not quick enough, you&#x27;re not smart enough. I&#x27;m going to have to get rid of most of you.&quot; In total, only 14 players from the 1969 roster returned in 1970. With a rebuilding team, Noll helped the Steelers improve to a record of 5–9, moving them to third place in the AFC Central. Noll became known during practice to dwell on fundamentals—such as the three-point stance, things that professional players were expected to know. Andy Russell, already a Pro Bowl linebacker before Noll arrived and one of the few players Noll kept after purging the roster, was told by Noll that he didn&#x27;t have his feet positioned correctly.

Throughout 1971, Noll implemented a defensive system that became known as the &quot;Steel Curtain&quot; defense. His defensive philosophy relied on controlling the line of scrimmage, stopping the run, and pressuring the quarterback, notably often done through blitzing with players such as linebackers Joe Greene and Jack Ham. His coaching style earned him the nickname of The Emperor Chaz by sports announcer Myron Cope. It was with this defensive strategy that the Steelers allowed just 175 points during the regular season, the second-fewest in the NFL and finished with a record of 11–3. The team went on to record their first post season victory against the Oakland Raiders 13–7, which included one of the most famous plays in NFL history, The Immaculate Reception. The Steelers went on to lose the AFC championship to the eventual Super Bowl champion Miami Dolphins 21–17.

Continuing to build on the team&#x27;s success in 1973, the Steelers won 10 of their 14 games and clinched a second consecutive playoff berth for the first time in franchise history. However, the team fell 33–14 against the Oakland Raiders in a rematch of the previous season&#x27;s divisional round.

It was in 1974 that the tide turned for Noll and the team. After a regular season record of 10–3–1 clinched a playoff berth for the third year, Noll led the team on an upset playoff run. The Steelers defeated the Buffalo Bills and Oakland Raiders in the playoffs, scoring 56 total points and only allowing a combined 27. The season culminated in a Super Bowl IX victory over the Minnesota Vikings, giving the Steelers their first ever championship appearance and win.

He led the team to continued dominance, winning Super Bowl X the following year over the Dallas Cowboys, making the Steelers the second team to ever repeat Super Bowl titles. He went on to become the first head coach to win four Super Bowls (IX, X, XIII, XIV). The teams that won Super Bowls IX and X used a run-oriented offense, primarily featuring Franco Harris and blocking back Rocky Bleier. Over the next few years, Terry Bradshaw matured into an outstanding passer, and the teams that won Super Bowls XIII and XIV fully utilized the receiving tandem of Lynn Swann and John Stallworth.

While most of his contemporaries enforced strict curfew rules on its players, Noll was very lax on off-the-field behavior. This was shown at Super Bowl IX. While Noll&#x27;s counterpart – Minnesota Vikings head coach Bud Grant – strictly kept his team in their hotel rooms except for practice before the game, Noll told his team upon arriving in New Orleans to go out on Bourbon Street &quot;and get the partying out of your system now.&quot;
Noll was notoriously shy and did not like the media or give many interviews. His 1970s teams were so talented that his contributions as head coach (and architect of the team) often were overlooked.

Infamously in 1983&#x27;s draft, Noll elected to pass on University of Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh native Dan Marino, instead selecting nose tackle Gabriel Rivera. Marino went on to become a Hall of Fame quarterback who broke numerous passing records with the Miami Dolphins and won honors such as league MVP and the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award while being named to the Pro Bowl nine times. Rivera only played six professional games due to being paralyzed after an accident in which he was drunk driving. Noll later explained his decision was a reaction to a rumor that Marino had done cocaine during his time at Pitt. Noll also believed the team would be able to retain then 34-year-old Bradshaw and that Cliff Stoudt would be able to replace him.

In Noll’s twilight years as a head coach, his team’s performances waned. After Bradshaw unexpectedly retired at the conclusion of the 1983 season, Noll chose 1980’s first round pick Mark Malone to be his successor. The Steelers finished 1984 going 9–7 and achieving first place in the AFC Central. Noll led the team on a playoff run that concluded with an AFC Championship loss to the Miami Dolphins who, ironically, had Marino as their starting quarterback. Over Noll’s next four seasons, he led the team to a record of 26–37. In 1988, Noll led the team to the worst record they had experienced since 1969 when they won just five out of their 16 regular season games, making them fall to fourth place in the AFC Central. As of the 2024 season, this remains the last time the Steelers placed last in their division. Noll was heavily criticized during the season. His former quarterback, Terry Bradshaw, commented that &quot;the game has passed him by&quot;.

He rebounded in 1989, leading the team to an improved 9–7 record with quarterback Bubby Brister at the helm. Noll was recognized as NFL Coach of the Year, when he guided the Steelers into the second round of the playoffs, which they lost to the Denver Broncos with a final score of 24–23. The team was not especially talented and lost its first two regular-season games by scores of 51–0 and 41–10. However, Noll kept the team focused and its play steadily improved enough to make the playoffs and play competitively in two playoff games; Noll went a combined 16–16 in his last two seasons at the helm of the Steelers.

===Post-coaching life===
Noll retired as Steelers head coach after the 1991 season with a career record of 209–156–1, including regular season and postseason games. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame two years later, in 1993.

Noll maintained a residence in suburban Pittsburgh, and also spent time at his Florida home. The Pittsburgh Steelers gave him a gift of a stationary bicycle, which he avidly used. Noll&#x27;s mobility was limited by chronic back problems.

Noll held the ceremonial title of administration adviser in the Pittsburgh Steelers&#x27; front office but had no real role in the team&#x27;s operations after his retirement. He spent about half the year in Pittsburgh with his wife Marianne. Their son, Chris, is a teacher in a private high school in Connecticut.

==Death==
Noll died of natural causes in his Sewickley, Pennsylvania, condominium on June 13, 2014, after suffering for several years from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, a heart condition, and back problems. Noll&#x27;s funeral was held on June 17, 2014, at St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in Pittsburgh.

==Legacy==

Noll&#x27;s legacy includes providing opportunities for African Americans. Under Noll, Joe Gilliam became the league&#x27;s first African American starting quarterback just a few seasons after the AFL started Marlin Briscoe, and James Harris (Gilliam started ahead of Terry Bradshaw briefly during the 1974 season). In January 1975, Franco Harris became the first African American to win the Super Bowl MVP award.

During the 1980s, Tony Dungy, who played for two seasons under Noll in the late 1970s, got his start as an NFL assistant coach, initially as the Steelers&#x27; defensive backs coach, and later he became the first African-American coordinator (defensive) in the NFL. Noll strongly promoted Dungy as a well-qualified head coaching candidate, but it did not happen for Dungy with the Steelers when Noll retired after the 1991 season. However, Dungy did become head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and later became the first African American coach to win a Super Bowl (XLI) with the Indianapolis Colts.

On August 2, 2007, the field at St. Vincent Seminary in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, was dedicated and renamed Chuck Noll Field in honor of the former coach. The Steelers have held their summer camp at St. Vincent College, as it was Noll&#x27;s idea to take the team away from the distractions in the city to prepare for the season each year, since 1975. The team celebrated 50 years of utilizing the field in July 2015.

Noll was honored on October 7, 2007, at Heinz Field during the Pittsburgh Steelers&#x27; pre-game ceremonies before the Steelers blew out the Seahawks 21–0.

On September 30, 2011, Pittsburgh honored Noll by naming a new street after him. Chuck Noll Way connects North Shore Drive to West General Robinson St. The street runs along Stage AE, on the North Shore of Pittsburgh.

Noll has been the subject of multiple publications due to his on-field success. His biography, written by sports author Michael MacCambridge, &quot;Chuck Noll: His Life&#x27;s Work&quot; was published on October 28, 2016. &quot;Men of Steel&quot; by Jim Wexwell was published in 2006, which heavily focuses on the Steelers&#x27; early success through the 1970&#x27;s and 1980&#x27;s, highlighting Noll&#x27;s tenure with the team.

<doc id="762320" wikidata="Q356114" url="?curid=762320" title="Hideyo Noguchi">
<text>, also known as , was a prominent Japanese bacteriologist at the Rockefeller Institute known for his work on syphilis and yellow fever and contributing to the long term understanding of neurosyphilis. 

Before his career at Rockefeller Institute, he worked at the University of Pennsylvania. His research was on blood serums, snake venom, and immunity, which helped lay the foundation to the fields of immunology and serology. Alongside bacteriologist Thorvald Madsen, he produced one of the first serums to treat the North American rattlesnake bite at the Statens Serum Institute. 

Noguchi was an early advocate of antivenoms. He wrote a foundational text titled &quot;Snake Venoms: An Investigation of Venomous Snakes with Special Reference to the Phenomena of Their Venoms&quot;. 

Later in his career, he developed the first serum for Rocky mountain spotted fever, a notoriously lethal disease before treatment was discovered. 

During his research in Peru and Ecuador, he and fellow researcher Evelyn Tilden proved Carrions disease and verruca peruana were due to the same species, &quot;Bartonella bacilliformis.&quot;

His most notable achievement was discovering the causative agent of syphilis &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot; in the infected brain and spinal cord tissue of a patient with general paresis, establishing the conclusive link between the mental and physical disease. American educator and psychiatrist John Clare Whitehorn considered the discovery an outstanding psychiatric achievement. 

Noguchi was prolific during his lifetime. He published over 200 academic papers and gave lecture tours throughout Europe and North America. He was one of the earliest Japanese scientists to gain international recognition and acclaim for his contributions. Eventually, he would be nominated several times for a Nobel prize in medicine between 1913 and 1927. 

Posthumously, his work on yellow fever, which he mistakenly identified as a bacteria&quot;,&quot; was disproven as it was a virus. In addition to that, his claims on discovering the causative organisms of rabies, poliomyelitis, trachoma and pure culture of syphilis have not been reproduced. Eventually, Noguchi died of yellow fever in search for the cause of the disease during a trip to Africa.

==Early life==

Hideyo Noguchi, whose childhood name was Seisaku Noguchi, was born to a family of farmers in Inawashiro, Fukushima prefecture in 1876. His mother Shika worked in the rice fields, providing for her family and worked to restore her family&#x27;s honor it once had in the village in the days of her great grandfather and maintain the family farm.

=== Childhood accident ===
When he was two years old, he fell into an irori, a traditional Japanese sunken fireplace. His elderly deaf grandmother with poor eyesight along with his four year old sister, Inu, were left watching him. 

His mother heard his scream in the fields. Noguchi suffered severe burns and an infection developed on his left hand. There was no doctor in the small village. His left hand was useless as the joints of the fingers were gone, and the remaining joints had adhered to each other to form a solid clump. His thumb was drawn down to the wrist and had become attached to it. While her son could no longer become a farmer, as she hoped. Shika vowed to give her son an education.

=== Early education ===
In 1883, Noguchi entered Mitsuwa elementary school. Fifteen years after the accident due to generous contributions from his teacher elementary teacher Kobayashi and friends, Noguchi received surgery for his left hand. He recovered 70% functionality. As shown, Noguchi was given support from the people around him over the course of his life.

Noguchi decided to become a doctor after his surgery. In 1893, sixteen year old Noguchi apprenticed at , the same doctor who had performed the surgery, at his clinic in Aizuwakamatsu.

In 1872, Japan introduced medical examination for doctors to modernized its medical system during the Meji Restoration. Except graduates of the exclusive and elite Imperial University in Tokyo were exempt from the examination. Noguchi unable to get into the Imperial University because of his peasant background. In 1896, he left for Tokyo to receive formal training and prepare for his examination. After one month, he passed his written portion, and in 1897, he passed the clinical examinations at twenty years old.

While preparing for the examination, Noguchi indulged in brothels and wine, which permitted, but faded as time went on. In 1898, Noguchi changed his first name to Hideyo after reading a novel by Japanese author Tsubouchi Shōyō about a college student whose character had the same name as him. The character in the story, Seisaku, was an intelligent medical student like Noguchi but became lazy and ruined his life.

Eventually, Noguchi worked at the Kitasato Research. Although, he was one of the only doctor to have not graduated from the Imperial University, making him an outsider. In addition, Noguchi worked as a quarantine officer at the port of Yokohama, earning 35 yen a month.

=== Noguchi&#x27;s patrons ===
Dr. Watanabe introduced Noguchi to Chiwaki Morinosuke founder of the Takayama Dental College (precursor to the Tokyo Dental College) who took him in as an apprentice. Both Noguchi and Morinosuke became close friend. Noguchi showed signs of great talent. He had three main benefactors, Sakae Kobayashi, his elementary school teacher and father figure, Kanae Watanabe, the doctor who performed surgery on his hand, and Morinosuke Chiwaki, who later aided in funding his travel to the United States. 

=== Leaving Japan ===
In 1899, Noguchi met Simon Flexner during his internship at the Kitasato Institute. Simon Flexner was visiting Japan to see research from Japanese scientists. Noguchi was his translator, being one of a few people who spoke English and Japanese, at the Kitasato Institute. Noguchi expressed his desire to work in the United States to Flexner, and Flexner gave polite words encouragement.

Partly, motivated by difficulties in obtaining a medical position in Japan as it required expensive schooling. He experienced discrimination as employers were concerned his hand deformity would discourage patients. 

Before leaving, Noguchi hosted a party with friends, spending most of his money. His mentor Chiwaki took a loan of 300 yen to pay for Noguchi&#x27;s ticket on the &quot;America Maru.&quot; Noguch was immensely grateful.

==Early career ==
On December 30, 1900, Noguchi arrived in Philadelphia. He surprised Simon Flexner at the University of Pennsylvania. In spite of their brief correspondence, Noguchi requested a job. Although, he had been wanting an opportunity to hire an assistant to investigate snake venoms, Flexner said the university had no funds. 

Later in Flexner&#x27;s diary, he recognized his courage and persistence for traveling so far from his home country. The day after he arrived, Flexner asked, &quot;Have you ever studied snake venom?&quot; Noguchi, not having much experience, but an abundance of determination, said, &quot;Yes, sir, I do know a little about it. I&#x27;d like the chance to learn more.&quot;

=== Research at University of Pennsylvania ===
On January 4, 1901, Noguchi started his research position, earning eight dollars a month coming out of Flexner&#x27;s pocket. Flexner left for San Francisco to investigate an outbreak of the plague, leaving Noguchi for three months under the guidance of Dr. Silas Weir Mitchell. Despite his lack of knowledge, Flexner returned to find he had written a 250 pages on snake venom. Flexner was impressed. In addition, Mitchell and Noguchi wrote a joint research paper, which was his first official publication. Both presented their scientific findings before the National Academy of Science in Philadelphia, one of the greatest honors an American scientist could have at the time. Dr. Mitchell spoke during the presentation but Noguchi handled the specimens.Dr. Mitchell said after their research concluded...
&quot;It is thanks to the great efforts of this young man that I have been able to bring my thirty years of research to their final conclusion.&quot;Although, Dr. Mitchell was concerned about his acceptance into larger Western society. During his research on snakes, Noguchi complained about live rabbits being fed to snakes in cages and felt the practice cruel, but colleagues said he was too sensitive. Nonetheless, Mitchell recommended him for the Carnegie Fellowship. Noguchi was accepted and became an official researcher and received funding from both the Carnegie Institute and National Academy of Science. Paul Ehrlich wrote to congratulate him. On July 9, 1907, the University of Pennsylvania awarded Hideyo Noguchi an honorary degree. On July 19, 1907, he wrote to about the accomplishment, &quot;Everything is beautiful when it is still in a dream state, but when it becomes a reality it is no longer interesting to me... When one wish comes true, another is born... Now I intend to request a medical degree from the Japanese government.&quot;

=== State institute and advocate for antivenom ===
French scientist Albert Calmette was the first to produce an antitoxin for venomous snake bites in 1895. Mitchell had made attempts to produce a serum for rattlesnakes, but was unsuccessful and encouraged his protege. Subsequently, Noguchi received an invitation to research at the Statens Serum Institute in Copenhagen. He wrote several papers with fellow bacteriologist, Thorvald Madsen. Noguchi brought a hundred grams of dried rattlesnake venom to Copenhagen and with Madsen produced one of the first antiserums to treat North American rattlesnake bites in 1903. Noguchi was the first to propose the mass production of antivenom in the USA, but not having been realized until Afrânio do Amaral from the Butantan Institute and his research contributed to the development of the first North American rattlesnake antivenom in 1927. 

=== Major publications ===
Between 1905 and 1908, Noguchi produced 28 papers and reports on his work with snake venoms and the routine observations of immunologic relationships, as well as tetanus. In 1907, he wrote the chapter on venoms in William Osler and Thomas McCraes Modern Medicine. In 1909, Noguchi released a comprehensive monograph on snake venom, &quot;Snake Venoms: An Investigation of Venomous Snakes with Special Reference to the Phenomena of Their Venoms&quot;. The publication contained drawings and several photographs of specimens. In the preface, it stated,“No single work in the English language exists at this time which treats of the facts of zoological, anatomical, physiological, and pathological features of venomous snakes, with particular reference to the properties of their venoms.&quot;In 1904, he returned from Copenhagen. Flexner had offered him a position at the Rockefeller Institute alongside six others members. Noguchi moved to Lexington Avenue in New York City. His was introduced to another medical student Norio Araki, who was roommates with Hideyo Noguchi for three years. 

== Career at the Rockefeller Institute ==
In 1905, Treponema pallidum was first identified as the cause of syphilis by Fritz Schaudinn and Erich Hoffmann. Flexner put Noguchi onto syphilis research as he selected syphilis as one of the major diseases to focus research on at the institute.

In 1906, Noguchi was the first person in the United States to confirm the spirochete sixty days after its discovery. Between 1906 to 1915, Noguchi made some of his most long lasting discoveries and scientific contributions to syphilis .

=== Butyric acid test ===
When the Wasserman test was announced in 1906, Noguchi began working on refining it as it utilized serum reactions, which he was familiar from the course of his research of snake venom. 

Noguchi and J. W. Moore created the butyric acid test for diagnosing syphilis, which used fluid from the spinal column, it was considered valuable tool in the early days of syphilis diagnosis. Physicians reported finding the test more sensitive. During the distribution to hospitals, doctors reported, “Noguchi had prepared for us all the antigen and ambocepter tests that we used. He also spent about two weeks at our laboratory and helped us materially by making many of the tests.&quot; 

In particular, it was effective at diagnosing neurosyphilis as it detected 90 percent of cases of general paralysis. Although, the test was used less as more refined tests were developed and it was technically demanding and required more specialized expertise. 

In 1909, he published twelve papers on syphilis. In 1910, Noguchi published his manuscript, &quot;Serum Diagnosis of Syphilis&quot;, his most popular publication, assisting doctors and physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of syphilis.

=== Controversial pure culture of syphilis ===
Dr. Flexner told him to focus his efforts on obtaining a pure culture of the spirochete. Flexner wrote in his diary, “Once he was started on a problem he would pursue it to the bitter end.&quot; Noguchi set up hundreds of tubes for his cultures and used thousands of microscopic slides in his lab. 

In February 1911, Noguchi believed that he had grown a pure culture and wrote to his childhood mentor Kobayashi, “I feel as if I am dancing in heaven.&quot; He thought it might eradicate of syphilis. Although few were able to reproduce his results and his pure culture was considered unreproducible. In 1934, Hans Zinsser, a personal friend of Noguchi, reluctantly said it had not been successful. It was prone to contamination. Over the next century, bacteriologists and researchers continued struggled to produce a stable culture.

=== Presence of &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot; in paresis ===
Wards Island State Hospital, located on an island in the East River, held the New York State Pathologic Institute and was located opposite of the Rockefeller Institute. Staff members at the Rockefeller Institute, Phoebus Levene and James B. Murphy worked at the Pathologic Institute and were well aware of the problems of patients suffering from paresis. Noguchi began collecting samples from spinal cords and brains of patients that died from tabes dorsalis or of paresis to determine its relationship to syphilis. 

In 1912, Noguchi had collected a total of 200 brains and 12 spinal cords samples from post-mortem patients. In collboration with J. W. Moore, a psychiatrist at Wards Island, Noguchi discovered the presence of &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot; in the spinal cord of a patient with tabes dorsalis and paresis. His discovery proved the homogeneity of a mental and physical disease through demonstrating that an organic agent could cause psychosis. His friend and neighbor, Ichiro Hori, reported he bursted into his apartment in the middle of the night, dancing and wearing nothing but his underwear, shouting, “I found it! I found it!&quot;

With this discovery, Noguchi&#x27;s influence went beyond bacteriology. John C. Whiteborn wrote about the history of American psychiatry. “In the organicist tradition, the outstanding psychiatric achievement as well as the final and conclusive link in the demonstration of the etiologic role of syphilis in general paresis was Noguchi and Moore’s demonstration of the spirochete in the brains of general paretics.&quot;Before his discovery, about 20 percent of the New York State mental hospitals were patients suffering from paresis that led to a patient’s death within five to seven years. Noguchi allowed for these patients to be diagnosed with syphilis. Noguchi proved that general paresis and tabes dorsalis are late stages of tertiary syphilis of the brain and spinal cords. Noguchi had discovered the delayed effects that could appear ten to twenty years after infection on the nervous system. In 1925, Association of American Physicians granted him its prized Kober Medal for this discovery.
When interviewed later, Noguchi said,&quot;All you need is enough test tubes, sufficient money, dedication, and hard work. ... and one more thing, you have got to be able to put up with endless failure.&quot;When compared to a genius, he said, &quot;there was no such thing as genius. There was only the willingness to work three, four, even five times harder than the next man&quot;. Dr. Noguchi&#x27;s name is remembered in the binomial attached to another spirochete, &quot;Leptospira noguchii&quot;. 
=== Unusual research methods ===
Noguchi was prolific in his lab results. Flexner described his work as &quot;superhuman&quot;. His record for numbers of published papers in a single year was an unheard of nineteen submitted to journals. Noguchi published over 200 paper and gave lecture tours throughout Europe during his career. 

Noguchi rarely read extensively before his experimentation. He wanted to learn through his failure. He report in a letter to his mentor,&quot;Theories are not to be taught by anybody outside of ourselves. We are the best teachers of the truth — I mean by this that we ought to convince ourselves chiefly by our own experiences and own experiments.&quot;Although, he tended to draw premature conclusions. During a lecture on the transmission of syphilis to rabbits, he had been successful in only one out of thirty-six cases. Noguchi did not label his test tubes, he insisted he had it memorized. He claimed to have a &quot;special method&quot;.

His work station was covered in cigarette butts. His friend Okumura witnessed Noguchi drank and smoked a great deal, but was stunned at how Noguchi could get along without sleep. He could be irresponsible with his specimens. Once he swallowed solution of jaundice while pipetting a culture. He washed his mouth out with alcohol but he felt he could have contracted jaundice. 

Early in his career, Noguchi&#x27;s found it difficult for him to accept help as he wanted to ensure he received proper credit for his discoveries. Often washed his own test tubes and grounded his own mixtures which research assistants typically do. He once said, &quot;I can&#x27;t allow someone who doesn&#x27;t know exactly what I&#x27;m doing here to interfere.&quot;

When he met Evelyn Tilden, an English major, in Massachusetts, she was hired as his secretary. Tilden was profoundly impactful to the writing of his research papers. Eventually, Tilden became his apprentice and Noguchi encouraged her to enroll in courses in biology and organic chemistry at Columbia University. Eventually, she received a doctoral degree in 1931 and made a career for herself, becoming professor at the North Western University.

== Personal life ==

=== Marriage and relationships ===

Noguchi secretly married Mary Loretta Dardis on April 10, 1912, whom he met for a single time after he returned from Copenhagen. He did not meet her again for years, &quot;then ran into her on the street, had a rose in his hand, held it up to her.&quot; Both came from a background of poverty. Mary, nicknamed Maize, called her husband, Hidey. 

The marriage was kept secret from his family, friends, and boss. Flexner opposed his marriage to an American. Flexner felt he should marry someone of Japanese descent. Noguchi worried his marriage would put his promotion at risk because she would have to be added to his pension and the taboo of having an interracial marriage. Their marriage did become known to the public until his death. 

Both of them moved into an apartment at 381 Central Park West. He would turn the kitchen into a laboratory, leaving bacterial specimens in the refrigerator, have microscopes holding germ cultures on the dinner table, and put test tubes in the oven. 

Mary would read often to him at his microscope, whether it was old tales, Tolstoy, or Shakespeare. Mary had to endure his long absences on scientific exhibition.

Noguchi would often be caught at the laboratory at night and people would ask him why he was not at home? His usual reply was, &quot;Home? This is my home.&quot; Some people thought was escaping from his relationship but it is revealed through letters their marriage brought great satisfaction. Mary provided a refuge and inspiration. 

Suzanne Kamata has discussed how American women, such as Mary Dardis, have played a large part in the success of their Japanese husbands but have often gone unnoticed due to their nationality. She states &quot;her assistance may have even helped to prolong his life.&quot;

Since he was notoriously bad with money, he often got paid in two separate checks, one to hand on to his wife and the other to keep so that he would have something to spend it on. Mary might have stopped him from entering financial ruin. 

Hideyo was close friends with his neighbor, Ichiro Hori, a Japanese painter and photographer. During his studies, Noguchi befriended Hajime Hoshi in the United States.Later Hoshi returned to Japan and started the successful Hoshi Pharmaceutical Co. Hoshi used his friendship with Noguchi and his reputation for his pharmaceutical company, which Hoshi offered to compensate him for. Noguchi said to give it to his family in Inawashiro.

=== Return to Japan ===

He would write often to his mentor, Kobayashi, who granted him permission to call him &quot;father.&quot;

His childhood mentor encouraged Noguchi to return and establish his career in Japan. In 1912, he told his family that he did not plan to return to Japan.

His mother, Shika, who was notably illiterate, wrote, “Please come home soon, please come home soon, please come home soon, please come home soon.” She worked as a midwife but did not have much of an income and his family was at risk of losing the Noguchi home. Noguchi began sending money every month to his family.

His mother&#x27;s health declined. Noguchi sent an unsubtle telegram to Hoshi and asked for enough money to return home. Hoshi was generous and immediately sent him enough to return to Japan Noguchi bought a ticket and sailed to visit her and accept the Imperial Prize on September 5, 1915. Noguchi was surrounded at the dock with reporters. He greeted his mentors Chiwaki and Kobayashi at the Imperial Hotel. Noguchi presented them with golden watches as gifts. 

When Noguchi greeted his mother, he showed her a photograph of Mary and she approved. Noguchi spent another ten whole days with his mother, but returned to the United States, and this would be the last time he would be back in Japan. In November 1918, his mother Shika died.
=== Illness and recovery in the Catskills ===
In 1917, Noguchi&#x27;s health had declined. Earlier Noguchi was told he had enlarged heart from his irregular intense activity after a physical examination. Mary called an ambulance since he refused to go to the hospital and was brought to Mount Sinai hospital. He was diagnosed with typhoid fever, a severe case with perforation of his digestive tract. He claimed it was jaundice after accidentally digesting. His fever worsened and Mary and those around him thought he might die.

Hoshi financially supported him during his treatment. He made a slow recovery, Noguchi and Mary after seeing an advertisement in a newspaper took a four hour train ride to the Catskills. Both of them booked a room at the Glenbrook Hotel in the small hamlet of Shandaken, which had less than a hundred people. Noguchi felt it reminded him of his hometown in Fukushima.

Noguchi decided to purchase approximately two hectares and build a house in Shandaken, becoming one of the largest landowners in the hamlet. He bought it with the money he had leftover for his treatment. The construction was completed around June 15, 1918. Noguchi built his home alongside the Esopus river where he would fish and paint and spend most of his summers in 1918, 1922, and 1925 to 1927.
=== Hobbies ===
Noguchi was gifted oil paints from Ichiro Hori and he started painting in Shandaken. He had excellent success. Ichiro said, &quot;he would be good at anything&quot; and was not surprised at his painting ability. His paintings hang in the Hideyo Noguchi Memorial Museum.

Noguchi was an amateur photographer. It was said that there is no scientific researcher who likes photography more than Noguchi. He might have been one of the first non hand colored photographs of a Japanese person. He achieved this through using autochrome lumière. He sent this in a letter, dated August 8, 1914, to his childhood mentor, Sakae Kobayashi.

Noguchi was fluent in Japanese and English, but also spoke German, Dutch, French, Mandarin, Danish and Spanish. 

== Luetin experiment and the antivivisectionists ==
In 1911 and 1912 at the Rockefeller Institute in New York City, Noguchi was working on a syphilis skin test, which could provide an additional diagnostic procedure to complement the Wassermann test in the detection of syphilis.

Professor William Henry Welch, Board of Scientific Directors at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, urged Noguchi to conduct human trials. The subjects were gathered from clinics and hospitals across New York City. In the experiment, the doctors given the tests injected an inactive product of syphilis, called luetin, under the skin on the upper arm of the patient.

=== Method and Clinical Trials ===
Skin reactions were studied, as they varied among healthy subjects and syphilis patients, based on the disease&#x27;s stage and its treatment. The lutein test gave a positive reaction almost 100 percent for congenital and late syphilis. While his diagnostic test was effective, it never had a reliable supply from the organism in pure culture form, never yielding practical results. 

Of the 571 subjects, 315 had syphilis. The remaining subjects were controls; some of which were orphans between the ages of 2 and 18 years. Most were hospital patients being treated for diseases, such as malaria, leprosy, tuberculosis, and pneumonia, and the subjects did not realize they were being experimented on and could not give consent. 

=== Public reactions to the experiment ===
Critics at the time, mainly from the anti-vivisectionist movement, noted that the Rockefeller Institute violated the rights of vulnerable orphans and hospital patients. There was concern among anti-vivisectionists that the test subjects had contracted syphilis from the experiments, but were proven to be false.

In Dr. Noguchi&#x27;s defense, Noguchi had performed tests on animals to ensure the safety of the lutein test. Rockefeller Institute business manager Jerome D. Greene wrote a letter to the Anti-Vivisection Society, which had pointed out that Noguchi had tested it on himself and his fellow researchers before administering it.

In a letter to District Attorney Charles S. Whitman, Greene said&quot;What public institution would not welcome a harmless and painless test which would enable it to decide in the case of every person admitted whether that person was afflicted with a venereal disease or not?&quot;Much of the information came from newspapers, which did not consult medical professionals. Greene mentioned the steps taken to ensure the sterility. His explanation was considered a demonstration of the care that doctors were taking in research. 

In May 1912, the New York Society for the Prevention for Cruelty to Children asked the New York district attorney to press charges against Noguchi, but he declined. Although, none of subjects were infected with syphilis, the Rockefeller Institute did test on patients without consent.

Even though none of the subjects were injured in the experiment, Hideyo Noguchi had committed a wrong, it was &#x27;a wrong without injury&#x27;.Albert Leffingwell, a physician, social reformer, and advocate for vivisectionist restrictions, said in response to Jerome D. Greene.&quot;If insurance could have been given that the luetin test implied no risk of any kind, might not the Rockefeller Institute have secured any number of volunteers by the offer of a gratuity of twenty or thirty dollars as a compensation for any discomfort that might be endured?&quot;

=== Lack of informed consent ===
During the period, consent in medical science was by no means customary. The United States did not develop sufficient consensus about unethical human experimentation until the late 20th century, which brought laws about involving informed consent and the rights of patients to pass. 

Noguchi received incredible scrutiny. One of the newspapers described him as &quot;the Oriental admirer of the fruits of Western civilization.&quot; He made a wrong doing with his experiments, not obtaining consent, but he might have received more criticism due to his race and the perpetuated stereotype of yellow peril. 

At the same time, notable microbiologists, such as Robert Koch in 1906 to 1907 operated medical concentration camps in Africa to find a cure for sleeping sickness and blinded patients, and Louis Pasteur experimented on nine-year-old Joseph Meister without a medical license and was suspected to have lied about conducting animal trials. They received far less scrutiny on their legacy. 

== Later career ==

In July, 1914, Flexner made Noguchi a full member of the Institute. 

His name and discoveries began to appear regularly in American newspapers. Noguchi felt compelled to make more discoveries and pressure from his boss Simon Flexner and home country to bring respect and honor to his fellow Japanese. He wrote in a letter,&quot;I am almost exhausted and I feel the weight of my situation, because every one working at this Institute is expected by the outsiders to do something. Yet, as you know, we cannot find a new thing every day!&quot;

=== Successes in tropical diseases ===
Noguchi began to tackle Rocky mountain spotted fever, similar to another disease Tsutsugamushi present in Japan, where deaths were common among rice planters and farmers. Furthermore, he began researching jaundice after two Japanese scientists announced a discovery of a spirochete appearing in the liver of a guinea pig demonstrating jaundice.

In June of 1918, Noguchi became chief investigator on a commission of the International Health Board traveled throughout Central America and South America to conduct research to develop a vaccine for yellow fever.

He once said, &quot;Whether I succeed or not is another matter, but the problem is worth trying.&quot; Noguchi dabbled in researching numerous diseases at the same time. He felt one might get results.

In 1921, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society. In the meantime, Noguchi published a revision of &quot;Serum Diagnosis of Syphilis&quot; with assistance from Evelyn Tilden in 1922, &quot;Laboratory Diagnosis of Syphilis&quot;, which aided in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease.

In 1923, Noguchi had attempted creating passive and active immunity for Rocky mountain spotted fever. One of his close assistants died during the research, which he mourned. He supported his assistants widow and children. He made a breakthrough when he produced the first antiserum for the disease.

During his time in Peru and Ecuador, between 1925 to 1927, he worked on Carrions disease and verruca peruana, which was widespread in the regions, and proved the infections were due to the same species, &quot;Bartonella bacilliformis.&quot;His assistant, Akatsu, noted Noguchi showed discontent in his career even with recent breakthroughs. Noguchi sometimes lost his temper and scolding his assistants, but outside of the laboratory, Noguchi was a different and more open person. He would invite him to restaurants and speak Japanesesomething he never did at the Rockefeller Institute.
In a letter to Flexner, he wrote,
&quot;Somehow I cannot manage to find enough time to sit quietly and think over things calmly and reflect upon many things and phases in life. I seem to be chasing something all the time, perhaps an acquired habit or rather the lack of poise&quot;.

=== Controversial research on yellow fever ===

Noguchi decided to focus on yellow fever, which some of his colleagues died researching because of his experience with syphilis and spirochetes. He thought the disease could have been a spirochete after traveling to Merida, Mexico and seeing patients demonstrate symptoms of Weil&#x27;s disease, but similar to yellow fever. Noguchi identified it as &quot;Leptospira icterohemorrhagiae&quot; and mistakingly declaring it the causative agent of yellow fever. Other scientists unable to repeat his findings, it was questioned.

During his career, whether yellow fever was a virus or a bacteria was a debated topic with viruses having been discovered in 1892. Noguchi worked much of the next ten years to prove his theory that it was from spir bacteria. He even thought he developed a vaccine against it, unknowingly for Weil&#x27;s disease.

Following the death of British pathologist Adrian Stokes from yellow fever in September 1927, it became increasingly evident that yellow fever was caused by a virus, not by the bacillus &quot;Leptospira icteroides&quot;, as Noguchi believed. He began preparing to travel to Accra, Gold Coast (modern-day Ghana) to study yellow fever and get closer to specimens. Noguchi believed himself immune to yellow fever because of his own vaccine. 

=== West Africa ===
Feeling his reputation was at stake, Noguchi hastened to Lagos to carry out research. However, he found the working conditions in Lagos did not suit him. At the invitation of Dr. William Alexander Young, the young director of the British Medical Research Institute, he moved and made this his base in 1927.

The diaries of Oskar Klotz, another researcher with the Rockefeller Foundation, describe Noguchi&#x27;s temper and behavior as erratic and bordering on the paranoid. One reason might be he had untreated syphilis, for which he was diagnosed in 1913, but it could have progressed to neurosyphilis, prone to personality changes.

According to Klotz, Noguchi inoculated huge numbers of monkeys with yellow fever, but failed to keep proper records. 

== Death ==
Despite this, Noguchi failed to keep infected mosquitoes in their secure containers. In May 1928, having been unable to find evidence for his theories, Noguchi was set to return to New York after spending six months in Africa, but became sick. Noguchi boarded to sail home but on May 12 was put ashore at Accra. He taken to a hospital and he died on 21 May.
During his last letters to Mary, he writes“I spend every moment of every day waiting for a telegram from you. When I am dispirited or tired, you are the one thing that raises my spirits. I am always thinking of you. It is rare that I dream but when I do, it is always of you.” 

In a letter home, Young states, &quot;He died suddenly noon Monday. I saw him Sunday afternoon – he smiled – and amongst other things, said, “Are you sure you are quite well?&quot; &quot;Quite.&quot; I said, and then he said &quot;I don’t understand.&quot; His obituary was featured in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Doing his autopsy, he was found to have a syphilitic heart. Seven days later, despite exhaustive sterilization of the site, Young himself died of yellow fever.

==Legacy==
Noguchi was profoundly influential during his lifetime. He brought newfound attention to obscure and tropical diseases, such as trachoma, affecting a large part of developing countries in Africa, often ignored by western scientists. 

Furthermore, Noguchi and Tilden&#x27;s identification of the leishmaniasis pathogen and proving Carrion&#x27;s disease and Oroya fever one of the same. He was applauded for his discovery in South America and had a 2.1 km street in Guayaquil, Ecuador named after him.

His most famous contribution was his identification of syphilis in the brain tissues of patients with paralysis due to meningoencephalitis. In addition to his lasting contributions to the use of snake venom and serums for Rocky Mountain spotted fever.In the 21st century, the Nobel Foundation archives were opened for public inspection and research. Noguchi was nominated several times for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine: in 1913–1915, 1920, 1921 and 1924–1927.

=== Posthumous retractions ===
With the electron microscope, which was invented two years after his passing, some of his discoveries became understood as mistaken. 

Some of his research, including his discovery of polio, rabies, trachoma, and yellow fever&#x27;s cause were not able to be reproduced. His finding that &quot;Noguchia granulosis&quot; causes trachoma was questioned within a year of his death. His identification of &quot;Leptospira icterohemorrhagiae&quot; as yellow fever was disproven after Max Theiler discovery. Furthermore, his rabies pathogen medium to cultivate bacteria was prone to contamination.A Rockefeller Institute researcher criticized him for being unwilling to issue retractions for his claims, but others said it was more flaws inside the system of peer review at the Institute.

==Honors during Noguchi&#x27;s lifetime==
Noguchi was honored with Japanese and foreign decorations. He received honorary degrees from a number of universities.Noguchi was self-effacing in his public life, and he often referred to himself as &quot;Funny Noguchi&quot; as noted in Times Magazine. When Noguchi was awarded an honorary doctorate at Yale, William Lyon Phelps observed that the kings of Spain, Denmark and Sweden had conferred awards, but &quot;perhaps he appreciates even more than royal honors the admiration and the gratitude of the people.&quot;

==Posthumous honors==

Noguchi&#x27;s remains were returned to the United States and buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City.

In 1928, the Japanese government awarded Noguchi the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star, which represents the second highest of eight classes associated with the award.

In 1979, the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR) was founded with funds donated by the Japanese government at the University of Ghana in Legon, a suburb north of Accra.

In 1981, the Instituto Nacional de Salud Mental (National Institute of Mental Health) &quot;Honorio Delgado – Hideyo Noguchi&quot; was founded with founds of the Peruvian Government and the JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency) in Lima – Perú.

Dr. Noguchi&#x27;s portrait has been printed on Japanese 1000-yen banknotes since 2004. In addition, the house near Inawashiro where he was born and brought up is preserved. It is operated as part of a museum to his life and achievements.

Noguchi&#x27;s name is honored at the Centro de Investigaciones Regionales Dr. Hideyo Noguchi at the Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán.

==Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize==
The Japanese Government established the Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize in July 2006 as a new international medical research and services award to mark the official visit by Prime Minister Jun&#x27;ichirō Koizumi to Africa in May 2006 and the 80th anniversary of Dr. Noguchi&#x27;s death. The Prize is awarded to individuals with outstanding achievements in combating various infectious diseases in Africa or in establishing innovative medical service systems. The presentation ceremony and laureate lectures coincided with the Fourth Tokyo International Conference on African Development in late April 2008. In 2009, the conference venue was moved from Tokyo to Yokohama as another way of honoring the man after whom the prize was named. In 1899, Dr. Noguchi worked at the Yokohama Port Quarantine Office as an assistant quarantine doctor.

The Prize is expected to be awarded every five years. The prize has been made possible through a combination of government funding and private donations.

<text>Stranmillis University College is a university college of Queen&#x27;s University Belfast. The institution is located on the Stranmillis Road in Belfast. It had students in . The school offers the BEd, PGCE and TESOL, as well as other courses.

==History==

The college was established in 1922 to provide state-funded teacher training by the then newly created Government of Northern Ireland to ensure that there would be a non-denominational teacher training college within Northern Ireland&#x27;s boundaries after the partition of Ireland. This status was undermined early in its existence, after a statement by Catholic bishops to the effect that a graduate of the institution would not be allowed to teach in a Catholic school. While Stranmillis remained the principle provider of teachers to state schools, in latter years, students could pay privately to complete their certificate in catholic education. Throughout its existence, Stranmillis has been welcoming of people from all faith backgrounds.
During the Second World War it was taken over by a Military Hospital from 1939 until May 1944 when the hospital relocated to Portrush, County Antrim.

==Architecture==
The main building of the college is attributed to Roland Ingleby Smith, chief architect of the Northern Ireland Ministry of Finance at the time of its construction in 1928-1930. The design, however, may have been partly or even wholly the work of an architect in the Government of Northern Ireland Works Division, T. F. O. Rippingham.

T. F. O. Rippingham is directly credited with the design of other college buildings, especially the Henry Garrett Building (1944).

==Association with Queen&#x27;s University Belfast==
The university college has been associated with Queen&#x27;s University since 1968 when it became a college of the university and commenced offering the university&#x27;s degrees. In 1999 this status was upgraded to the current university college status. The university college is financially and organisationally independent of the university.

==Students&#x27; Union==
Stranmillis Students&#x27; Union is the SU for Stranmillis University College Belfast, a College of Queen&#x27;s University, Belfast. 
The union is a democratic organisation which aims to ensure that every student has the highest quality of education and the most enjoyable student experience during their time at University. They offer academic representation, advice and a range of clubs and societies, as well as opportunities for volunteering and fundraising for charities. Every student that attends Stranmillis is a member of the Students&#x27; Union. 

The Students&#x27; Union is run by a body of ten students (as of 2022) known as the Students&#x27; Union Executive (SU Exec) and consists of the President, Deputy President, Secretary, International Secretary, Welfare Secretary, Entertainment Secretary, Clubs &amp; Societies Secretary, Academic Secretary, Services Secretary and Publicity Secretary. The President is the leader of the Executive and is responsible for the life of all students on campus. The Executive are all elected into their roles by an anonymous vote from the student body. The President is an annually-changing role, where they are elected in their last year of study, completing their year in office as a Graduate student. The President is the only member of the Executive who is an &#x27;employee&#x27; of the Union, with the other nine members in part-time, voluntary roles which they complete alongside their academic studies.

<text>John Willock Noble (October 26, 1831 – March 22, 1912) was a U.S. lawyer and brevet brigadier general in the Civil War. He served as the Secretary of the Interior between 1889 and 1893.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Lancaster, Ohio on October 26, 1831. Early on he studied in Cincinnati and Columbus, then attended Miami University and Yale. In 1851, he graduated from Yale University with honors. He then studied law at Columbus and Cincinnati.

==Career==
===Law and Civil War===
After he graduated from Yale, he went to study law. He first studied law in the office of his brother and that who Attorney General Henry Stanberry. Noble settled in St. Louis in 1855, and the next year moved to Keokuk, Iowa to look for better prospects n the practice of his profession. There he took a prominent part in politics. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he was city attorney for Keokuk, which position he had assumed in 1859.

After the outbreak of the American Civil War Noble was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 3rd Iowa Cavalry Regiment in September 1861. He rose through the ranks and became the regiment&#x27;s commander with the rank of colonel in June 1864. At the war&#x27;s end he received a brevet (honorary promotion) to brigadier general and was mustered out of service in August 1865.

===After the war===

After the war, he became a companion of the Missouri Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, a military society of officers of the Union armed forces and their descendants. He settled in St. Louis, Missouri after the Civil War, and was recommended by Stanberry to be US District Attorney. Overall, he was appointed United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri from 1867 to 1870. He resigned from that role in 1870, and began again practicing law.

The St. Louis Mining and Stock Exchange was formed in St. Louis in the fall of 1880 with Noble as a founding member.

Two days after Noble&#x27;s death, on March 23, 1912, Robert Underwood Johnson wrote to &quot;The New York Times&quot; with a letter describing Noble as a pioneer of the conservation movement in the United States. Johnson cited his work with the Interior under President Harrison, in which Noble originated the forest reservation policy, leading to reserves being proclaimed in the great Sierra Reserve and the Arizona Canyon Reserve, made possible by legislation on March 3, 1891, which Noble initiated.

<text>Edward John Noble (August 8, 1882 – December 28, 1958) was an American broadcasting and candy industrialist originally from Gouverneur, New York. He co-founded the Life Savers Corporation in 1913. He founded the American Broadcasting Company when he purchased the Blue Network in 1943 following the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s (FCC) decree that RCA divest itself of one of its two radio networks.

==Early life and education==
Noble was born in Gouverneur, New York on August 8, 1882, the younger of two sons, to Harvey H. Noble (1847–1925) and Edna L. (née Wood; 1855–1932) Noble. He also had one sister. His father initially was a railway worker as telegraph operator, later he became a bookkeeper at the &quot;Bank of Gouverneur.&quot; After being educated at local public schools, Noble attended Syracuse University for one year; he then transferred to Yale, &quot;graduating with a bachelor of arts degree in 1905.&quot;

==Career==
In 1912, chocolate manufacturer Clarence Crane of Cleveland, Ohio, invented Life Savers as a &quot;summer candy&quot; that could withstand heat better than chocolate. Since the peppermints looked like miniature life preservers, he called them Life Savers. After registering the trademark, Noble bought the rights to the candy for $2,900. Instead of using cardboard rolls, which were not very successful, he created tin-foil wrappers to keep the mints fresh. Pep-O-Mint was the first Life Savers flavor.

Noble was the first chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Authority. In June 1939, he was appointed the first Under Secretary of Commerce by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a role created especially for him, serving until August 1940 (Wayne Chatfield-Taylor was appointed to replace him). Following the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s order that RCA divest itself of one of its two radio networks, he founded the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) when he purchased the Blue Network (formerly part of NBC) on October 12, 1943. He tried to build ABC into an innovative and competitive broadcaster, but was hampered by financial problems and the pressure of competing with long-established NBC and CBS. By 1951, he entered negotiations to merge the network with United Paramount Theaters, headed by Leonard Goldenson; Goldenson became chairman of the ABC network, while Noble sat on its board of directors for the rest of his life.

Noble died at 76 in his Greenwich home on December 28, 1958, after several months of illness.

==Legacy==
In 1943, Noble bought the St. Catherines Island on the coast of Georgia; in 1968, ten years after his death, the island was transferred to the Edward J. Noble Foundation.

The island is now owned by the St. Catherines Island Foundation, and the island&#x27;s interior is operated for charitable, scientific, literary, and educational purposes. The foundation aims to promote conservation of natural resources, the survival of endangered species, and the preservation of historic sites, and to expand human knowledge in the fields of ecology, botany, zoology, natural history, archaeology, and other scientific and educational disciplines.

Noble was part of the St. Lawrence Seaway Project and was appointed to the advisory board by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1954. He owned Boldt Castle, the Thousand Island Club, and a summer residence on Wellesley Island. The ornamental street lights in the village park are all that remain of the gift of new street lights that were given to the village by Edward and his brother, Robert. The lights were in memory of their father.

Three hospitals and a foundation are named after him. A building on the campus of St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York is also named after him.

==Personal==
On November 6, 1920, Noble married Ethel Louise Tinkham (1884–1975), of Napanoch in Ulster County, in New York City. They had two daughters;

* June Noble (June 17, 1922 – June 23, 2020), married David Shiverick Smith
* Sally Noble (July 10, 1924 – February 9, 1944)

<text>Umberto Nobile (; 21 January 1885 – 30 July 1978) was an Italian aviator, aeronautical engineer and Arctic explorer.

Nobile was a developer and promoter of semi-rigid airships in the years between the two World Wars. He is primarily remembered for designing and piloting the airship &quot;Norge&quot;, which may have been the first aircraft to reach the North Pole, and which was indisputably the first to fly across the polar ice cap from Europe to America. Nobile also designed and flew the &quot;Italia,&quot; a second polar airship; this second expedition ended in a deadly crash and provoked an international rescue effort.

==Early career==
Umberto Nobile was born in Lauro, in the southern Italian province of Avellino, into a family of small landowners. His father Vincenzo, a civil servant, belonged to the cadet branch of an aristocratic family that had been stripped of its titles after the Italian unification over their continuing loyalty to the deposed Bourbons, and which had adopted the Nobile surname for that reason.

After graduating from the University of Naples in 1908 with a degree in industrial engineering, Nobile was hired by the Italian state railways. In 1911 his interests turned to the field of aeronautical engineering and he enrolled into a course offered by the Italian Army&#x27;s Engineers Corps. During World War I he served as a military engineer, working at the Military Factory for Aeronautical Construction and Experience (&quot;Stabilimento Militare di Costruzioni ed Esperienze Aeronautiche&quot;) in Rome. During this time he designed airships designed for anti-submarine reconnaissance, 15 of which would be built after the war, and taught courses for aspiring officers. In 1918 he designed the first Italian-made parachute. He was director of the Factory from 1919 until 1927.

He also lectured at the University of Naples, obtained his test pilot&#x27;s license and wrote the textbook &quot;Elementi di Aerodinamica&quot; (&quot;Elements of Aerodynamics&quot;).

During this time Nobile became convinced that medium-sized, semi-rigid airships would be superior to non-rigid and rigid designs, and focused on their design. One of the Military Factory&#x27;s first projects in this direction was the T-34, which was designed for a trans-Atlantic crossing. The United States Army purchased the airship in 1921 and commissioned it as the &quot;Roma&quot;. In February 1922 the hydrogen-fueled &quot;Roma&quot; crashed and exploded in Norfolk, Virginia, after hitting high-tension power lines, killing 34 in what was the worst aviation disaster in the United States at the time.

In the same year Nobile worked with Gianni Caproni on the design the first Italian all-metal aircraft, the Caproni Ca.73, and traveled to the United States to work as a consultant for Goodyear in Akron, Ohio. In 1923 he began the design of a new airship, the N-1, which was built for the United States, Spain, Argentina and Japan. He would travel himself to Japan in January 1927 to supervise the assembly of the N-3 airship, which had been sold to the Japanese Imperial Navy, and personally took part in several test flights. Nobile later claimed that during this time he faced professional hostility from some high-profile members of the Air Force establishment, including Italo Balbo, who had some of the best workers of the Military Factory dismissed on suspicion of being anti-fascists, obstructed plans for a Rome-Rio de Janeiro flight, and held back support for polar expeditions.

==Polar expeditions==
===&quot;Norge&quot;===

In late 1925 Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen sought out Nobile to collaborate on a flight to the North Pole – still at that time an unreached goal for aviators – using an airship. Amundsen had previously in early 1925 flown to within 150 nautical miles (280 km) of the North Pole, in a pair of Italian-built &quot;Dornier Wal&quot; flying boats along with the American millionaire-adventurer Lincoln Ellsworth and the pilot Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen, but their planes were forced to land near 88 degrees North, and the six men were trapped on the ice for 30 days.

The Italian State Airship Factory, which had built Nobile&#x27;s N-1, made it available for the expedition 29 March 1926. Amundsen insisted in the contract that Nobile should be the pilot and that five of the crew should be Italian; Amundsen named the airship &quot;Norge&quot; (&quot;Norway&quot;). On 14 April the airship left Italy for Leningrad in Russia with stops at Pulham (England) and Oslo. On its way towards its Arctic jumping-off point, Ny-Ålesund (Kings Bay) at Vestspitsbergen, Svalbard (belonging to Norway) it also made a stop at the airship mast at Vadsø (Northern Norway).

On 29 April Amundsen was dismayed at the arrival of Richard E. Byrd&#x27;s American expedition, which also aimed to reach the Pole. On 9 May, after Byrd and Floyd Bennett departed in their Fokker F-VII and returned less than 16 hours later claiming to have overflown the Pole, Amundsen was one of the first to congratulate them. The &quot;Norge&quot; crew pressed ahead with their flight.

On 11 May 1926, the &quot;Norge&quot; expedition left Svalbard. Fifteen and a half hours later the ship flew over the Pole and landed two days later in Teller, Alaska; strong winds had made the planned landing at Nome, Alaska, impossible. In retrospect, the &quot;Norge&quot; crew actually achieved their aim of being the first to overfly the Pole: Byrd&#x27;s 9 May flight, acclaimed for decades as the prestigious first Polar flyover, has since been subjected to several credibility challenges, including the discovery of Byrd&#x27;s flight diary, which showed that navigational data in his official report was fraudulent. Byrd&#x27;s co-pilot Bennett is said later to have admitted that they faked their flight to the Pole.

The &quot;Norge&quot; &quot;Rome to Nome&quot; flight was acclaimed as another great milestone in flight, but disagreement soon erupted between Nobile (designer and pilot), and Amundsen (expedition leader, observer and passenger) on the flight, as to who deserved greater credit for the expedition. The controversy was exacerbated by Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist government, which trumpeted the genius of Italian engineering and exploration; Nobile was ordered to make a speaking tour of the U.S., further alienating Amundsen and the Norwegians.

===&quot;Italia&quot;===

Despite the controversy, Nobile continued to maintain good relations with other polar scientists, and he started planning a new expedition, this time fully under Italian control. Nobile&#x27;s company managed to sell the N-3 airship to Japan; however, relations between Nobile and his competitors in the fascist government were hostile, and he and his staff were subjected to threats and intimidation. Nobile&#x27;s popularity with the public meant he was, for the moment, safe from direct attack. When the plans for his next expedition were announced, Italo Balbo is said to have commented, &quot;Let him go, for he cannot possibly come back to bother us anymore.&quot;

The &quot;Italia&quot;, nearly identical to the &quot;Norge&quot;, was slowly completed and equipped for Polar flight during 1927–28. Part of the difficulty was in raising private funding to cover the costs of the expedition, which finally was financed by the city of Milan; the Italian government limited its direct participation to providing the airship and sending the aging steamer &quot;Città di Milano&quot; as a support vessel to Svalbard, under the command of Giuseppe Romagna.

This time the airship used a German hangar at Stolp en route to Svalbard and the mast at Vadsø (Northern Norway). On 23 May 1928, after an outstanding 69-hour-long flight to the Siberian group of Arctic islands, the &quot;Italia&quot; commenced its flight to the North Pole with Nobile as both pilot and expedition leader. On 24 May, the ship reached the Pole and had already turned back toward Svalbard when it ran into a storm. On 25 May, the &quot;Italia&quot; crashed onto the pack ice less than 30 kilometres north of Nordaustlandet (eastern part of Svalbard). Of the 16 men in the crew, ten were thrown onto the ice as the gondola was smashed; the remaining six crewmen were trapped in the buoyant superstructure as it ascended skyward due to loss of the gondola; the fate of the six men was never resolved. One of the ten men on the ice, Pomella, died from the impact; Nobile suffered a broken arm, broken leg, broken rib and head injury; Cecioni suffered two badly broken legs; Malmgren suffered a severe shoulder injury and suspected injury to a kidney; and Zappi had several broken ribs.

The crew managed to salvage several items from the crashed airship gondola, including a radio transceiver, a tent which they later painted red for maximum visibility, and, critically, boxes of food and survival equipment which quick-witted engineer Ettore Arduino had managed to throw onto the ice before he and his five companions were carried off to their deaths by the wrecked but still airborne airship envelope and keel. As the days passed, the drifting sea ice took the survivors towards Foyn and Broch islands.

A few days after the crash the Swedish meteorologist Finn Malmgren and Nobile&#x27;s second and third in command Mariano and Zappi decided to leave the immobile group and march towards land. Malmgren, who was injured, weakened and reportedly still depressed over his meteorological advice that he felt contributed to the crash, asked his two Italian companions to continue without him. These two were picked up several weeks later by the Soviet icebreaker &quot;Krasin&quot;. However, there were persistent rumors that Malmgren was killed and cannibalized by Zappi and Mariano.

A &quot;highly imaginative, fictionalized version&quot; of these events was made into the 1969 film &quot;The Red Tent&quot;. The film was an Italian/Soviet co-production and featured Peter Finch as Nobile, Sean Connery as Amundsen and Hardy Krüger as Lundborg.

===Controversial search and rescue===
In the wake of the crash, a collection of nations, including the Soviet Union, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Italy, launched the first polar air and sea rescue effort. Privately owned ships which had been chartered by polar scientists and explorers also participated. Even Roald Amundsen put aside his past differences with Nobile and boarded a French seaplane and headed for the rescue headquarters; this plane disappeared between Tromsø and Svalbard, and though a pontoon from the craft was later found, the bodies of Amundsen, the pilot René Guilbaud and the four others on board were not.

After a month of privation for the &quot;Italia&quot; survivors, the first rescue plane, a Swedish Air Force Fokker C.V-E ski plane, piloted by Lieutenant Einar Lundborg and with Lieutenant Schyberg as observer landed near the crash site. Nobile had prepared a detailed evacuation plan, with the most seriously wounded man (the heavy built mechanic Cecioni) at the top of the list and himself as number 4, with the navigator (Viglieri) and the radio operator (Biagi) as respectively no. 5 and 6. However, Lundborg refused to take anyone but Nobile. He argued that the plane could only take one survivor and the other seriously injured man was so heavy Lundborg was unsure he could take off. Nobile was airlifted to Søre Russøya, base camp of Swedish and Finnish air rescue efforts. When Lundborg returned alone to pick up a second survivor he crashed his plane on landing, and was trapped with the other five.

Eventually, Nobile reached the &quot;Città di Milano&quot;, where, he later said, he was dismayed at the incompetence he found. His attempts to help co-ordinate the international rescue effort were blocked, and when he threatened to leave he was placed under virtual arrest by Captain Romagna. His telegrams to the survivors still on the ice, as well as to various people involved in the rescue, were heavily censored. It was wrongly reported in Fascist Italian newspapers that his own evacuation was an obvious sign of cowardice. After 48 days on the ice floe, the last five men of his crew were rescued by the Soviet icebreaker &quot;Krasin&quot;. Nobile insisted that he wanted to continue the search for the six crew who were swept away by the airship when it disintegrated, but he was ordered back to Rome with the others.
Two hundred thousand cheering Italians met Nobile and his crew on arrival in Rome on 31 July. This show of popularity was unexpected by Nobile&#x27;s detractors, who had been seeding the foreign and domestic press with accusations against him. An aggrieved Nobile was not shy about his complaints; in an interview with Benito Mussolini, he offended the dictator by detailing his grievances at length. The official inquiry and the embarrassment over the crash gave Nobile&#x27;s enemies the chance they were looking for: blame for the disaster was placed on his shoulders, and he was accused of abandoning his men on the ice – charges he would spend the rest of his life trying to dispel. In protest of the findings, General Nobile resigned from the air force in March 1929.

==Later life==
In July 1931, Nobile took part in the expedition of the Soviet icebreaker &quot;Malygin&quot; to Franz Josef Land and the northern Kara Sea. He moved to the Soviet Union in 1932, and lived there for nearly five years to work on the Soviet semi-rigid airship program. Few details of the program have been documented, but Nobile supervised the manufacturing of three airships, including &quot;SSSR-V6 OSOAVIAKhIM&quot;, and designed two others that were intended for military use.

Nobile returned to Italy in December 1936, after he had been appointed as a member of the Pontificial Academy of Sciences. For a few months he also worked on aviation projects with Caproni, including methods to recover from a spin and an aircraft that could carry a MAS (motorboat) or a tank.

Due to the hostility of the Fascist government, Nobile moved to the United States in 1939 to teach at Lewis University (at the time called Lewis Holy Name School of Aeronautics due to its aviation-focused curriculum) in Romeoville and in Chicago. He was permitted to remain in the US after Italy declared war on the United States, but declined the offer of US citizenship and opted to return to Europe in May, 1942. Following a brief stay in Rome he moved to Spain, where he remained until Mussolini was deposed, after which he made his definite return to his native country.

In 1945, the Italian air force cleared Nobile of all charges related to the &quot;Italia&quot; crash, and not only reinstated him at his former rank as major general, but promoted him to lieutenant general and awarded him back pay dating to 1928. The following year he was elected to the Constituent Assembly as independent candidate in the lists of the Italian Communist Party. In that capacity he was part of the 75-member Committee that produced the main draft of the Italian Constitution.

In 1948, Nobile returned to teaching at the University of Naples, where he studied and taught aeronautical and astronautical subjects. He continued giving interviews and writing books and articles until his death, without managing to fully sway public opinion and some military experts of his version of the events of his polar expeditions.

Nobile died in Rome on 30 July 1978, aged 93, shortly after the celebrations for the fiftieth anniversary of his two expeditions. The Italian Air Force Museum at Vigna di Valle has a large permanent exhibition on his achievements. A museum in his hometown of Lauro collects his documents and memorabilia.

==Personal life==

Nobile was married to Carlotta Ferraiolo, daughter of a wealthy notary from Teano and ten years his senior, from 1916 until her death in 1934. Together they had a daughter, Maria. In 1959 he remarried with Gertrude Stolp, a German woman whom he had met in Spain in 1943 and who later became chief librarian at the headquarters of the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome.

<text>During World War II, the Political Warfare Executive (PWE) was a British clandestine body created to produce and disseminate both white and black propaganda, with the aim of damaging enemy morale and sustaining the morale of countries occupied or allied with Nazi Germany.

==History==
The Executive was formed in August 1941, reporting to the Foreign Office. The staff came mostly from SO1, which had been until then the propaganda arm of the Special Operations Executive. The organisation was governed by a committee initially comprising Anthony Eden (Foreign Secretary), Brendan Bracken (Minister of Information) and Hugh Dalton (Minister of Economic Warfare), together with officials Rex Leeper and Dallas Brooks, and Robert Bruce Lockhart as chairman (and later Director General). Roundell Palmer (the future 3rd Earl of Selbourne) later replaced Dalton when he was moved to become President of the Board of Trade. Ivone Kirkpatrick, an advisor to the BBC and formerly a diplomat in Berlin, also joined the committee, while Leeper left to become British Ambassador to Greece.

PWE included staff from the Ministry of Information, the propaganda elements of the Special Operations Executive, and from the BBC. Its main headquarters was at Woburn Abbey with London offices at the BBC&#x27;s Bush House. As the Political Warfare Executive was a secret department, when dealing with the outside world it used the cover name Political Intelligence Department (PID).

After D-Day most of PWE&#x27;s white propaganda staff transferred to the Psychological Warfare Division (PWD/SHAEF) of SHAEF.

At the end of World War II PWE were tasked with the re-education of German prisoners of war. As with different types of propaganda, PWE used the same &#x27;white&#x27;, &#x27;grey&#x27;, and &#x27;black&#x27; classifications for German POWs. Prisoners classed as &#x27;black&#x27; were considered dangerous ardent Nazis, with anti-Nazis classed as &#x27;white&#x27; and regular non-political soldiers classed as &#x27;grey&#x27;.

==Activities==
Activities of the PWE included distributing covert propaganda ranging from broadcasts to loudspeaker operations to lower morale and encourage desertion, leaflet drops, and underground publications in occupied countries, running rumour campaigns and creating forgeries, among others.

The main forms of propaganda were in the form of radio broadcasts and printed postcards, leaflets and documents. PWE created a number of clandestine radio stations including Gustav Siegfried Eins, Soldatensender Calais and Kurzwellesender Atlantik.

In order to deliver its subversive messages, PWE also disseminated information on events in Germany and the occupied countries, gathering intelligence from other services and agencies, including POW interrogations, and newspapers obtained from occupied countries, and bombing raid photo analysis. This last source was used to broadcast lists of streets (and even individual houses) that had been destroyed and on occasion to mock up faked &quot;real time&quot; reports of the German media.

Some PWE&#x27;s activities were controversial, such as impersonating deceased German soldiers and sending food parcels to their families with pacifist messages on their behalf. Later, Sefton Delmer, who ran a British black propaganda radio station during the war, quipped that although family hopes to see their loved ones were false, the ham was real.

<doc id="762346" wikidata="Q1047538" url="?curid=762346" title="Tea Act">
<text>The Tea Act 1773 (13 Geo. 3. c. 44) was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain. The principal objective was to reduce the massive amount of tea held by the financially troubled British East India Company in its London warehouses and to help the struggling company survive. A related objective was to undercut the price of illegal tea, smuggled into Britain&#x27;s North American colonies. This was supposed to convince the colonists to purchase Company tea on which the Townshend duties were paid, thus implicitly agreeing to accept Parliament&#x27;s right of taxation. Smuggled tea was a large issue for Britain and the East India Company, since approximately 86% of all the tea in America at the time was smuggled Dutch tea.

The Act granted the Company the right to directly ship its tea to North America and the right to the duty-free export of tea from Britain, although the tax imposed by the Townshend Acts and collected in the colonies remained in force. It received the royal assent on May 10, 1773.

Colonists in the Thirteen Colonies recognized the implications of the Act&#x27;s provisions, and a coalition of merchants, smugglers, and artisans similar to that which had opposed the Stamp Act 1765 mobilized opposition to the delivery and distribution of the tea. The company&#x27;s authorised consignees were harassed, and in many colonies, successful efforts were made to prevent the tea from being landed. In Boston, this resistance culminated in the Boston Tea Party on December 16, 1773, when colonists (some disguised as Native Americans) boarded tea ships anchored in the harbour and dumped their tea cargo overboard. Parliamentary reaction to this event included the passage of the Coercive Acts, designed to punish Massachusetts for its resistance, and the appointment of General Thomas Gage as royal governor of Massachusetts. These actions further raised tensions that led to the eruption of the American War of Independence in April 1775.

Parliament passed the Taxation of Colonies Act 1778, which repealed a number of taxes (including the tea tax that underlay this act) as one of a number of conciliatory proposals presented to the Second Continental Congress by the Carlisle Peace Commission. The commission&#x27;s proposals were rejected. The Act effectively became a &quot;dead letter&quot;, but was not formally removed from the books until the passage of the Statute Law Revision Act 1861.

==Background==

In the 1760s and earlier the East India Company had been required to sell its tea exclusively in London on which it paid a duty which averaged two shillings and six pence per pound. Tea destined for the North American colonies would be purchased by merchants specializing in that trade, who transported it to North America for eventual retail sale. The markups imposed by these merchants, combined with the tea tax imposed by the Townshend Acts of 1767 created a profitable opportunity for American merchants to import and distribute tea purchased from the Dutch in transactions and shipments that violated the Navigation Acts and were treated by British authorities as smuggling. Smugglers imported some of cheap foreign tea per year. The quality of the smuggled tea did not match the quality of the dutiable East India Company tea, of which the Americans bought per year. Although the British tea was more appealing in flavor, some Patriots like the Sons of Liberty encouraged the consumption of smuggled tea as a political protest against the Townshend taxes.

In 1770 most of the Townshend taxes were repealed, but taxes on tea were retained. Resistance to this tax included pressure to avoid legally imported tea, leading to a drop in colonial demand for the Company&#x27;s tea and a burgeoning surplus of the tea in the company&#x27;s English warehouses. By 1773 the Company was close to collapse due in part to contractual payments to the British government of £400,000 per year, together with war and a severe famine in Bengal which drastically reduced the Company&#x27;s revenue from India, and economic weakness in European markets. Benjamin Franklin was one of several people who suggested things would be greatly improved if the Company was allowed to export its tea directly to the colonies without paying the taxes it was paying in London: &quot;to export such tea to any of the British colonies or plantations in America, or to foreign parts, import duty of three pence a pound.&quot;

The administration of Lord North saw an opportunity to achieve several goals with a single bill. If the Company was permitted to directly ship tea to the colonies, this would remove the markups of the middlemen from the cost of its tea. Reducing or eliminating the duties paid when the tea was landed in Britain (if it was shipped onward to the colonies) would further lower the final cost of tea in the colonies, undercutting the prices charged for smuggled tea. Colonists would willingly pay for cheaper Company tea, on which the Townshend tax was still collected, thus legitimizing Parliament&#x27;s ability to tax the colonies.

==Provisions of the Act==
The Act, which received the royal assent on May 10, 1773, contained the following provisions:
*The Company was eligible to be granted a license to export tea to North America.
*The Company was no longer required to sell its tea at the London Tea Auction.
*Duties on tea (charged in Britain) destined for North America &quot;and foreign parts&quot; would either be refunded on export or not imposed.
*Consignees receiving the Company&#x27;s tea were required to pay a deposit upon receipt of tea.

Proposals were made that the Townshend tax also is waived, but North opposed this idea, citing the fact that those revenues were used to pay the salaries of crown officials in the colonies.

==Implementation==
The Company was granted a license by the North administration to ship tea to major American ports, including Charleston, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston. Consignees who were to receive the tea and arrange for its local resale were generally favorites of the local governor (who was royally appointed in South Carolina, New York, and Massachusetts, and appointed by the proprietors in Pennsylvania). In Massachusetts, Governor Thomas Hutchinson was a part-owner of the business hired by the Company to receive tea shipped to Boston.

==Reaction==

Many colonists opposed the Act, not so much because it rescued the East India Company, but more because it seemed to validate the Townshend Tax on tea. Merchants who had been acting as the middlemen in legally importing tea stood to lose their business, as did those whose illegal Dutch trade would be undercut by the Company&#x27;s lowered prices. These interests combined forces, citing the taxes and the Company&#x27;s monopoly status as reasons to oppose the Act.

In New York and Philadelphia, opposition to the Act resulted in the return of tea delivered there back to Britain. In Charleston, the colonists left the tea on the docks to rot. Governor Hutchinson in Boston was determined to leave the ships in port, even though vigilant colonists refused to allow the tea to be landed. Matters reached a crisis when the time period for landing the tea and paying the Townshend taxes was set to expire, and on December 16, 1773, colonists disguised as Indians swarmed aboard three tea-laden ships and dumped their cargo into the harbour in what is now known as the Boston Tea Party. Similar &quot;Destruction of the Tea&quot; (as it was called at the time) occurred in New York and other ports shortly thereafter, though Boston took the brunt of Imperial retaliation because it was the first &quot;culprit&quot;.

==Consequences==
The Boston Tea Party appalled British political opinion makers of all stripes. The action united all parties in Britain against the American radicals. Parliament enacted the Boston Port Act, which closed Boston Harbor until the dumped tea was paid for. This was the first of the so-called Coercive Acts, or Intolerable Acts as they were called by the colonists, passed by Parliament in response to the Boston Tea Party. These harsh measures united many colonists even more in their frustrations against Britain and were one of the many causes of the American Revolutionary War.

The Taxation of Colonies Act 1778 repealed the tea tax and others that had been imposed on the colonies, but it proved insufficient to end the war. The Tea Act became a &quot;dead letter&quot; as far as the Thirteen Colonies were concerned, and was formally removed from the books in 1861. This would go against their belief that only colonial governments could tax the colonies. Some American colonists became very frustrated. Ships carrying the company’s tea arrived in Philadelphia and New York but chose to return to England without unloading rather than face angry mobs.

<doc id="762363" wikidata="Q367132" url="?curid=762363" title="Francesco Saverio Nitti">
<text>Francesco Saverio Vincenzo de Paola Nitti (19 July 1868 – 20 February 1953) was an Italian economist and statesman. A member of the Italian Radical Party, Nitti served as Prime Minister of Italy between 1919 and 1920. An opponent of the fascist regime in Italy, he opposed any kind of dictatorship throughout his career. According to the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; in &quot;Theories of Overpopulation&quot;, Nitti was also a staunch critic of English economist Thomas Robert Malthus and his &quot;Principle of Population&quot;; Nitti wrote &quot;Population and the Social System&quot; (1894). He was an important meridionalist and studied the origins of Southern Italian problems that arose after Italian unification.

==Career==
Born in Melfi, Basilicata, Nitti studied law in Naples and was subsequently active as journalist. He was correspondent for the &quot;Gazzetta Piemontese&quot; (English: Piedmontese Gazette) and was one of the editors of the &quot;Corriere di Napoli&quot; (Courier of Naples). In 1891, he wrote a work about Christian socialism, titled &quot;Il socialismo cattolico&quot; (Catholic Socialism). In 1898, when he was only 30 years old, he became professor of finance at the University of Naples. Nitti was chosen in 1904 for the Italian Radical Party to serve in the Italian Parliament. From 1911 to 1914, he was minister of agriculture, industry, and trade under the then prime minister Giovanni Giolitti. In 1917, he became minister of finance under Vittorio Emanuele Orlando and held it until 1919.

On 23 June 1919, Nitti became prime minister and interior minister, after Orlando had resigned following the disappointed Italian gains at the Paris Peace Conference, resulting in widespread indignation within Italy about an alleged &quot;mutilated victory&quot;. A year later, Nitti was also minister of the colonies. His cabinet had to deal with great social unrest and dissatisfaction over the peace treaties. Particularly troublesome was the agitation over Fiume led by Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio. Nitti had great difficulty keeping the administration functioning at all, thanks to the enmity between the extremely divergent political factions of communists, anarchists, and fascists. After less than a year as head of government, he resigned and was succeeded by the veteran Giolitti on 16 June 1920. In social policy, Nitti&#x27;s government passed a law setting up compulsory insurance for unemployment, invalidity and old age.

From 1901 to 1924, Nitti was a member of the country&#x27;s Chamber of Deputies, first for the Italian Radical Party and then for the Italian Democratic Liberal Party. Still a member of the Italian Parliament, Nitti offered resistance to the nascent power of Italian fascism and openly despised Benito Mussolini. In 1924, Nitti decided to emigrate, and returned to Italy only after World War II, and joined the National Democratic Union and was a member of the Senate for the Republic in the Independent Left group from 1948 until his death in 1953. As a secularist and anticlerical, he opposed Christian Democracy and staunchly opposed NATO membership. In his 1927 book &quot;Bolshevism, Fascism and Democracy&quot;, Nitti correlated fascism with Bolshevism, saying: &quot;There is little difference between the two, and in certain respects, Fascism and Bolshevism are the same.&quot; At the same time, as a positivist, for Nitti both politics and history boiled down to facts. Like World War II, the Russian Revolution was a fact. Against the opinion of Georges Clemenceau, who considered the Russians to be perfectible ignorant barbarians and the Germans to be imperfectly educated barbarians, Nitti wondered what would have prevented them from getting along with Bolshevik Russia, once they had got along well with the Russia of the Tsars. Referring to modernisation, he wrote: &quot;Transplanting the principles and methods of the Russian Revolution into a country like Italy ... would be certain ruin. But it can be added that there is something in the spirit of the Russian Revolution that even Italy cannot ignore.&quot;

<text>Marshall Warren Nirenberg (April 10, 1927 – January 15, 2010) was an American biochemist and geneticist. He shared a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1968 with Har Gobind Khorana and Robert W. Holley for &quot;breaking the genetic code&quot; and describing how it operates in protein synthesis. In the same year, together with Har Gobind Khorana, he was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University.

==Biography==
Nirenberg was born in New York City to a Jewish family, the son of Minerva (Bykowsky) and Harry Edward Nirenberg, a shirtmaker. He developed rheumatic fever as a boy, so the family moved to Orlando, Florida to take advantage of the subtropical climate. He developed an early interest in biology. In 1948 he received his BS degree, and in 1952, a master&#x27;s degree in zoology from the University of Florida at Gainesville where he was also a member of the Pi Lambda Phi Fraternity. His dissertation for the Master&#x27;s thesis was an ecological and taxonomic study of caddis flies (Trichoptera). He received his PhD in biochemistry from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 1957, studying hexose uptake in tumor cells with his advisor James F. Hogg.

He began his postdoctoral work at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1957 as a fellow of the American Cancer Society in what was then called the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases. In 1959 he became a research biochemist at the NIH and began to study the steps that relate DNA, RNA and protein. Nirenberg&#x27;s groundbreaking experiments advanced him to become the head of the Section of Biochemical Genetics in 1962 in the National Heart Institute (now the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute), where he remained a laboratory chief until his death. Fellow laboratory chiefs included Ernst Freese and Daniel Carleton Gajdusek. He was married in 1961 to Perola Zaltzman, a chemist from the University of Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, who also worked at NIH and died in 2001. Nirenberg married Myrna Weissman, PhD, Professor of Epidemiology and Psychiatry at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 2005. He had four stepchildren: Susan Weissman of Evanston, Illinois, Judith Weissman of New York, New York, Sharon Weissman of New Haven, Connecticut, and Jonathan Weissman of San Francisco, California. He was also survived by his sister, Joan Nirenberg Geiger of Dallas, Texas, several nieces and a nephew.

Nirenberg was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1964 and the National Medal of Honor in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1981, Nirenberg became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. In 1986, Nirenberg&#x27;s achievements and contributions to the field of biochemistry genetics was recognized at an event honoring Maimonides and Menachem M. Schneerson, in the nation&#x27;s capital, hosted by Bob Dole and Joe Biden. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2001. He died on January 15, 2010, from cancer after several months of illness.

==Research==
By 1958, experiments and analysis such as the Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment, the Hershey–Chase experiment, the Watson–Crick structure and the Meselson–Stahl experiment had shown DNA to be the molecule of genetic information. It was not known, however, how DNA directed the expression of proteins, or what role RNA had in these processes. Nirenberg teamed up with Heinrich J. Matthaei at the National Institutes of Health to answer these questions. They produced RNA composed solely of uracil, a nucleotide that only occurs in RNA. They then added this synthetic poly-uracil RNA into a cell-free extract of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; which contained the DNA, RNA, ribosomes and other cellular machinery for protein synthesis. They added DNase, which breaks apart the DNA, so that no additional proteins would be produced other than that from their synthetic RNA. They then added 1 radioactively labeled amino acid, the building blocks of proteins, and 19 unlabeled amino acids to the extract, varying the labeled amino acid in each sample. Only in the extract containing the radioactively labeled phenylalanine, was the resulting protein also radioactive. This implied that the genetic code for phenylalanine on RNA consisted of a repetition of uracil bases. Indeed, as we know now, it is UUU (three uracil bases in a row). This was the first step in deciphering the codons of the genetic code and the first demonstration of messenger RNA (see &quot;Nirenberg and Matthaei experiment&quot;).

In August 1961, at the International Congress of Biochemistry in Moscow, Nirenberg presented a paper to a small group of scientists, reporting the decoding of the first codon of the genetic code. Matthew Meselson, who was in the audience, spontaneously hugged Nirenberg at the end of the talk and then told Francis Crick about Nirenberg&#x27;s result. Crick invited Nirenberg to repeat his performance the next day in a talk to a much larger audience. Speaking before the assembled congress of more than a thousand people, Nirenberg electrified the scientific community. He quickly received great scientific attention for these experiments. Within a few years, his research team had performed similar experiments and found that three-base repeats of adenosine (AAA) produced the amino acid lysine, and cytosine repeats (CCC) produced proline. The next breakthrough came when Philip Leder, a postdoctoral researcher in Nirenberg&#x27;s lab, developed a method for determining the genetic code on pieces of tRNA (see &quot;Nirenberg and Leder experiment&quot;). This greatly sped up the assignment of three-base codons to amino acids so that 50 codons were identified in this way. Khorana&#x27;s experiments confirmed these results and completed the genetic code translation.

The period between 1961 and 1962 is often referred to as the &quot;coding race&quot; because of the competition between the labs of Nirenberg at NIH and Nobel laureate Severo Ochoa at New York University Medical School, who had a massive staff. Faced with the possibility of helping the first NIH scientist win a Nobel prize, many NIH scientists put aside their own work to help Nirenberg in deciphering the mRNA codons for amino acids. Dr. DeWitt Stetten, Jr., director of the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases, called this period of collaboration &quot;NIH&#x27;s finest hour&quot;.

Nirenberg&#x27;s later research focused on neuroscience, neural development, and the homeobox genes.

<text>Märta Birgit Nilsson (17 May 1918 – 25 December 2005) was a Swedish dramatic soprano. Although she sang a wide repertoire of operatic and vocal works, Nilsson was best known for her performances in the operas of Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss. Her voice was noted for its overwhelming force, bountiful reserves of power, and the gleaming brilliance and clarity in the upper register.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Birgit Nilsson was born Märta Birgit Svensson on a farm at Västra Karup in Skåne (100 km/60 miles north of Malmö) to Nils Svensson and Justina Svensson (née Paulsson). When she was three years old she began picking out melodies on a toy piano her mother bought for her. She once told an interviewer that she could sing before she could walk, adding, &quot;I even sang in my dreams&quot;. Her vocal talent was first noticed when she began to sing in her church choir. A choirmaster near her home heard her sing and advised her to take voice lessons.

She studied with Ragnar Blennow in Åstorp for six months to prepare for an audition at the Royal Swedish Academy of Music in Stockholm where she came in first out of a group of 47 singers and was awarded the Christina Nilsson scholarship named for the famous soprano. Her teachers at the academy were Joseph Hislop and Arne Sunnegårdh. However, she considered herself self-taught: &quot;The best teacher is the stage&quot;, she told an interviewer in 1981. &quot;You walk out onto it, and you have to learn to project.&quot; She deplored her early instruction and attributed her success to native talent. &quot;My first voice teacher [Hislop] almost killed me ... [T]he second was almost as bad.&quot;

=== Early career ===
In 1946, Nilsson made her debut at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm with only three days&#x27; notice, replacing the ailing singer scheduled for the role of Agathe in Carl Maria von Weber&#x27;s &quot;Der Freischütz&quot;. Conductor Leo Blech was not very kind to her and, as she wrote in her autobiography, she even contemplated suicide after the performance. In 1947 she claimed national attention in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Lady Macbeth&quot; conducted by Fritz Busch. A wealth of parts followed, from Richard Strauss and Verdi to Wagner, Puccini, and Tchaikovsky. In Stockholm she built up a steady repertoire of roles in the lyric-dramatic field, including Donna Anna in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, &quot;Aida&quot;, Lisa in &quot;The Queen of Spades (opera)&quot;, &quot;Tosca&quot;, Venus in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, Sieglinde in &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, Senta in &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; and the Marschallin in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;, one of her favourite roles, all sung in Swedish. In 1949 she sang in &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; with Hjördis Schymberg and Elisabeth Söderström among others.

=== International engagements ===
Under Fritz Busch&#x27;s tutelage, her career took wing. He was instrumental in securing her first important engagement outside Sweden, as Electra in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Idomeneo&quot; at the Glyndebourne Festival in 1951. Her debut at the Vienna State Opera in 1953 was a turning point; she would be a regular performer there for more than 25 years. It was followed by Elsa in Wagner&#x27;s
&quot;Lohengrin&quot; at the Bayreuth Festival in 1954, then her first Brünnhilde in a complete &quot;Ring&quot; at the Bavarian State Opera, at the Munich Opera Festival of 1954. Later she returned as Sieglinde, Brünnhilde, and Isolde until 1969.

She took the title role of &quot;Turandot&quot;, which is brief but requires an unusually big sound, to La Scala in Milan in 1958, and then to the rest of Italy. Nilsson made her American debut as Brünnhilde in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Walküre&quot; in 1956 with the San Francisco Opera. She attained international stardom after a performance as Isolde at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in 1959, which made front-page news. She said that the single biggest event in her life was being asked to perform at the opening of the 180th season at La Scala as Turandot in 1958. She performed at many major opera houses in the world including Vienna, Berlin, the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden, Tokyo, Paris, Buenos Aires, Chicago, and Hamburg.

She sang with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra in the all-Wagner concert that opened the Concert Hall of the Sydney Opera House in 1973.

=== From the 1960s through to the 1980s ===
Nilsson was widely known as the leading Wagnerian soprano of her time, the successor to the great Norwegian soprano Kirsten Flagstad, particularly as Brünnhilde. However, she also sang many of the other famous soprano roles, among them Leonore, Aida, Turandot, Tosca, Elektra, and Salome. She had, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, a &quot;voice of impeccable trueness and impregnable stamina&quot;.

The conductor Erich Leinsdorf thought that her longevity, like Flagstad&#x27;s, had something to do with her Scandinavian heritage, remarking that Wagner required &quot;thoughtful, patient and methodical people.&quot; Nilsson attributed her long career to no particular lifestyle or regimen. &quot;I do nothing special&quot;, she once said. &quot;I don&#x27;t smoke. I drink a little wine and beer. I was born with the right set of parents.&quot;

In sheer power, her high notes were sometimes compared to those of the Broadway belter Ethel Merman. However Nilsson claims her &quot;explosive&quot; high notes that were her biggest asset on-stage &quot;have not been recorded like they should have been&quot; in the studio. She later lamented: &quot;It always made me a little bit sad when I heard my own recordings. And many people told me that I sang much better in person than I do on the recordings! That didn&#x27;t flatter me at all, because I know what&#x27;s going to be left when I am no longer singing&quot;.

Twice at the Met, Nilsson sustained injuries that kept her from performing. In February 1971, she sprained her ankle during a performance of &quot;Elektra&quot; that resulted in cancellation of one performance (that was replaced by a historic performance of &quot;Fidelio&quot; starring Christa Ludwig). Nilsson recovered to sing the broadcast performance of &quot;Elektra&quot; on 27 February. More seriously, in March 1974 she fell and dislocated her shoulder during a rehearsal of &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;. While recuperating in her hospital room at Roosevelt Hospital she said, &quot;other than my bruises and my black and blues I feel fine&quot;. Although able to sing Brünnhilde for the first two performances with her arm in a sling, her injury caused her to miss subsequent performances, including that season&#x27;s &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; broadcast. &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; review of the production&#x27;s 8 March opening night is reprinted in the Metropolitan Opera Archives.

=== &quot;Miss N.&quot; ===
Beginning at the summer of 1968 at the Bayreuth Festival, Nilsson was obsessively stalked by a much younger American actress and model, Nell Theobald, until Theobald&#x27;s suicide nine years later in 1977. Nilsson recounted her experiences with Theobald at length in her memoir, &quot;La Nilsson&quot;, in which she referred to Theobald solely as &quot;Miss N.&quot; The stalking incident was later featured in &quot;Opera News&quot; magazine and &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

=== Nilsson&#x27;s humour ===
Nilsson did not get along with famous conductor Herbert von Karajan. Once when rehearsing on stage at the Vienna Staatsoper, her string of pearls broke. While helping her retrieve them, Karajan asked, &quot;Are these real pearls bought with your La Scala fees?&quot; Nilsson replied, &quot;No, these are fake pearls bought with your Vienna Staatsoper fees.&quot; When Nilsson first arrived at the Met to rehearse the production of &quot;Die Walküre&quot; conducted by Karajan, she said, &quot;Nu, where&#x27;s Herbie?&quot; And Karajan once sent Nilsson a cable several pages long, proposing in great detail a variety of projects, different dates and operas. Nilsson cabled back: &quot;Busy. Birgit.&quot;

The Swedish photographer Lennart Nilsson, who became world famous for his documentation of pregnancy from conception to birth, was asked by the magazine &quot;Life&quot; to photograph Birgit Nilsson&#x27;s vocal cords as she sang high C. Birgit Nilsson turned the proposal down with the words &quot;Your photographer wants me to swallow the tiny camera so he can take pictures of the vocal cord . I don&#x27;t want that, since I know where it has been before.&quot; Eventually, though, she agreed on having the pictures taken.

There was a healthy competition between Nilsson and tenor Franco Corelli as to who could hold the high C the longest in Act II of &quot;Turandot.&quot; In one tour performance, after she outlasted him on the high C, he stormed off to Rudolf Bing during the next intermission, saying that he was not going to continue the performance. Bing, who knew how to handle Corelli&#x27;s tantrums, suggested that he retaliate by biting Nilsson on the neck when Calaf kisses Turandot in Act III. Corelli didn&#x27;t bite her but he was so delighted with the idea that he told her about Bing&#x27;s suggestion. She then cabled Bing, informing him she had to cancel the next two performances because she had contracted rabies.

When Nilsson started singing &quot;Aida&quot; at the Met, soprano Zinka Milanov was miffed as Aida had theretofore been &quot;her&quot; role. After one performance in which Nilsson was singing, Milanov commandeered and drove off in the Rolls-Royce Nilsson had hired for after the performance. When asked about this afterwards, Milanov said &quot;If Madame Nilsson takes my roles, I must take her Rolls.&quot;

The secret to singing Isolde, she said, was &quot;comfortable shoes.&quot; After a disagreement with the Australian soprano Joan Sutherland, Nilsson was asked if she thought Sutherland&#x27;s famous bouffant hairdo was real. She answered: &quot;I don&#x27;t know. I haven&#x27;t pulled it yet.&quot;

Once, asked what was her favourite role, she answered: &quot;Isolde made me famous. Turandot made me rich.&quot; When long-time Metropolitan Opera director Sir Rudolf Bing was asked if she was difficult, he reportedly said &quot;Not at all. You put enough money in, and a glorious voice comes out.&quot; When Nilsson was preparing her taxes and was asked if she had any dependents, she replied, &quot;Yes, just one, Rudolf Bing.&quot;

=== Business ===
Nilsson was also famous for her ability to make money. She became one of the highest-paid singers in the field, in part because of the rarity of her skills. Being a shrewd businesswoman, she negotiated much of her own career. She never ranted or engaged in tantrums. She would begin contract talks by refusing every offer and being evasive about her availability. This tack would continue until the impresario offered something she wanted. Nilsson&#x27;s reply would be &quot;maybe&quot;.

=== Interactions with conductors ===
Nilsson was known for standing up to conductors. In a 1967 rehearsal of &quot;Die Walküre&quot; with Herbert von Karajan conducting, Nilsson responded to the gloomy lighting of the production by wearing a miner&#x27;s helmet (complete with Valkyrian wings). When on some occasion von Karajan urged a retake &quot;but this time with more heart. That&#x27;s the place where you have your purse&quot;, Nilsson replied, &quot;I&#x27;m so pleased to find we have something in common.&quot; When Georg Solti, in &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, insisted on tempos too slow for Nilsson&#x27;s taste, she made the first performance even slower, inducing a change of heart in the conductor.

=== Self-criticism ===
Despite her worldwide recognition, Nilsson said she was nervous before every major performance. &quot;Before a premiere, on the way to the opera, I&#x27;d hope for just a small, small accident, it didn&#x27;t need to be much, but just so I would not have to sing&quot;, she said in a 1977 interview on Swedish TV. Nilsson often spoke of her limits. She said her voice was not a good fit with what she described as the softer textures and refined tones of Italian operas. Nonetheless, she sang roles in Italianate operas such as Donna Anna in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;.

=== Recordings ===
Nilsson recorded all of her major roles in major commercial recordings of the complete works, as well as about a dozen solo recitals of arias, art songs, concerts, and hymns—all were originally released on vinyl LP format and most have been reissued on CD or in digital format. Partly because of her availability to play Brünnhilde, Decca Records undertook the expensive project of making a studio recording of Wagner&#x27;s four-opera &quot;Ring Cycle&quot;, conducted by Solti and produced by John Culshaw. The effort took seven years, from 1958 to 1965. A film of the proceedings made her a familiar image for arts-conscious television viewers.

=== Absence from New York and Salzburg ===
Though a frequent visitor to the Metropolitan Opera, Nilsson did not always see eye to eye with its redoubtable general manager, Rudolf Bing (who was often said to dislike Wagner), nor with conductor Herbert von Karajan. Subsequently, she made fewer New York appearances than hoped in the early 1970s and was virtually excluded from the Salzburg Festival. Her American career was derailed in the mid-1970s by US Internal Revenue Service claims filed for back taxes. Several years later a schedule of payments was worked out, and Nilsson&#x27;s hiatus from the United States ended. When she returned, Donal Henahan wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The famous shining trumpet of a voice is still far from sounding like a cornet.&quot;

Nilsson appeared at the Metropolitan Opera 223 times in 16 roles. She sang two complete &quot;Ring&quot; cycles in the 1961–62 season, and another in 1974–75. She was Isolde 33 times, and Turandot 52. She played most of the other major soprano parts: Aida, Tosca, the Dyer&#x27;s Wife in Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot;, Salome, Elektra, Verdi&#x27;s Lady Macbeth, and Leonore in Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;. In 1966 she simultaneously performed the roles of Venus and Elisabeth (who never appear together) in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser.&quot; She memorably appeared as replacement Sieglinde to Rita Hunter&#x27;s Brünnhilde in the 1970s. She appeared 232 times at the Vienna State Opera from 1954 to 1982, and the Vienna Philharmonic, the company&#x27;s orchestra, made her an honorary member in 1999. &quot;If there ever was someone that one can call a real star today and a world-famous opera singer during her time then that was Frau Nilsson&quot;, said Ioan Holender, director of the Vienna State Opera.

=== Later life ===

Nilsson&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Mina minnesbilder&quot; (&quot;My memoirs in pictures&quot;) was published in Stockholm in 1977. She retired in 1984 to her childhood home in the Skåne province of southern Sweden, where her father had been a sixth-generation farmer and she had worked to grow beets and potatoes until she was 23. In an interview in the mid-1990s, she appeared happy, serene and as unpretentious as ever. &quot;I&#x27;ve always tried to remember what my mother used to tell me&quot;, she said. &quot;Stay close to the earth. Then when you fall down, it won&#x27;t hurt so much.&quot;

In 1981, Sweden issued a postage stamp showing Nilsson as Turandot. She received the Illis quorum gold medal, today the highest award that can be conferred upon a Swedish citizen by the Government of Sweden. In 1988, on the occasion of the 350th anniversary of New Sweden, the first Swedish settlement in America, The American-Scandinavian Foundation named their prize for promising young American opera singers the Birgit Nilsson Prize. Nilsson personally chaired several competitions.

=== Death ===
Nilsson died, aged 87, on 25 December 2005 at her home at Bjärlöv, a small village near Kristianstad in Skåne in the same county where she was born. No cause of death was released. She was survived by her husband Bertil Niklasson (died March 2007), a veterinary surgeon whom she had met on a train and married in 1948. They had no children.

== Legacy ==
Three years after Nilsson&#x27;s death, in December 2008, the Birgit Nilsson Foundation announced that it would award a prize every two to three years to a concert or opera singer, a classical or opera conductor, or a specific production by an opera company. The prize was funded by Nilsson herself. The foundation said that Nilsson had chosen the first winner, to be announced in early 2009.

On 20 February 2009, Spanish tenor Plácido Domingo was announced as the inaugural recipient of the prize, which carried with it a cash award of $1,000,000. The first award ceremony took place in the Royal Swedish Opera on 13 October 2009. King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden personally presented the prize to the designated winner. A jury has been set up by the foundation to make recommendations for future prizes. The second winner of the Birgit Nilsson prize was Riccardo Muti, who received the award in Stockholm on 13 October 2011. On 9 April 2014 it was announced that the third recipient of the prize would be the Vienna Philharmonic.

<doc id="762374" wikidata="Q4984974" url="?curid=762374" title="Buddy cop">
<text>Buddy cop is a film and television genre with plots involving two people of very different and conflicting personalities who are forced to work together to solve a crime and/or defeat criminals, sometimes learning from each other in the process. The two are normally either police officers (&quot;cops&quot;) or secret agents, but some films or TV series that are not about two officers may still be referred to as &quot;buddy cop films/TV series&quot;. It is a subgenre of buddy films. They can be either comedies or action-thrillers.

==Overview==
Frequently, although not always, the two heroes are of different ethnicity or cultures. However, regardless of ethnicity, the central difference is normally that one is &quot;wilder&quot; than the other: a hot-tempered iconoclast is paired with a more even-tempered partner. Often the &quot;wilder&quot; partner is the younger of the two, with the even-tempered partner having more patience and experience. These films sometimes also contain a variation on the good cop/bad cop motif, in which one partner is kinder and law-abiding, while the other is a streetwise, &quot;old school&quot; police officer who tends to break (or at least bend) the rules. Another frequent plot device of this genre is placing one of the partners in an unfamiliar setting (like a different city or foreign country) or role (like requiring police field work of a non-cop, rookie, or office-bound &quot;desk jockey&quot;). In these cases, they are usually guided by the other partner.

In his review of &quot;Rush Hour&quot;, Roger Ebert coined the term &quot;Wunza Movie&quot; to describe this subgenre, a pun on the phrase &quot;One&#x27;s a...&quot; that could be used to describe the contrasts between the two characters in a typical film.

The cliché was satirized in the film &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;. While the movie in itself was a buddy cop film (i.e. pairing a fictional cop with a real world boy), the film&#x27;s police department obligatorily assigned all cops a conflicting buddy to work with, even to the extreme of one officer being partnered with a cartoon cat.

A subgenre of the buddy cop film is the buddy cop-dog movie, which teams a cop with a dog, but uses the same element of unlikely partnership to create comedic hijinks, such as &quot;Turner &amp; Hooch&quot;, &quot;Top Dog&quot; and &quot;K-9&quot;.

==History==
Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s 1949 Japanese film &quot;Stray Dog&quot;, starring Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura, is considered a precursor to the buddy cop film genre. Other early pioneers of the buddy cop film genre are the 1967 American film &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; and 1974&#x27;s &quot;Freebie and the Bean&quot;. The genre was later popularized by the 1982 film &quot;48 Hrs.&quot;, starring Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte, then also the 1984 film &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; along with its 1987 sequel &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot;, all three are among the most successful buddy cop films. The genre was further popularized by the 1986 film &quot;Running Scared&quot; starring Gregory Hines and Billy Crystal, 1987 film &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, and the &quot;Tango &amp; Cash&quot; starring Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell. The genre was revisited multiple times by &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; creator Shane Black, who went on to write &quot;The Last Boy Scout&quot;, &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;, &quot;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot;, and &quot;The Nice Guys&quot;, all of which play off the mismatched-partners (if not always specifically cops) theme.

<text>John Milton Niles (August 20, 1787 – May 31, 1856) was a lawyer, editor, author and politician from Connecticut, serving in the United States Senate and as United States Postmaster General 1840 to 1841.

==Biography==
Born in Windsor, Connecticut, Niles received a common school education and studied law. He was admitted to the bar in 1817 and practiced in Hartford, Connecticut. There, he also established a newspaper, the &quot;Hartford Weekly Times&quot;, in 1817, where he worked as an editor as well as a contributor for over thirty years. He published two other papers, the Gazatteer of Connecticut and Rhode Island, and The Independent Whig. He married Sarah Robinson on June 17, 1824. After her death on November 23, 1824, he married Jane Pratt on November 26, 1845.

==Career==
Niles became active in Democratic Party politics and a supporter of states-rights doctrines. In 1820 he was appointed an associate judge in the Hartford County Court, but didn&#x27;t start until 1821. He served until 1826 when he was elected to the Connecticut House of Representatives. Unsuccessful for reelection, he continued practicing law. In 1829 he was appointed Postmaster of Hartford, serving this position until 1836. He failed to be elected to an at-large Connecticut Representative seat.

After the demise of Whig senator Nathan Smith, Niles was elected as a class one senator to fill his seat, serving from 1835 to 1839. There, he served as chairman of the Committee on Manufactures in the 24th and 25th congresses. He was not a candidate for reelection. In 1839 and in 1840 he was the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for Governor of Connecticut, losing to William W. Ellsworth.

Appointed United States Postmaster General by President Martin Van Buren in 1840, Niles served until the end of the administration in 1841. As Postmaster General he ended delivery of mail on Sunday. He returned to the Senate as a class three senator in 1844. He was actually elected in 1842 and was to start in 1843, but ill health and a credentials challenge kept him out until the next year. When he was a US Senator, in 1845, he cast the deciding vote admitting Texas to the Union as a slave state, though he was against slavery. He served from March 4, 1843, to March 3, 1849, and declined for reelection. Associating with the Free Soil Party campaign of his friend Van Buren in 1848, he became their candidate for governor in 1849. He spent some time in Europe from 1851 to 1852.

==Death==
In his later years, Niles pursued horticulture. He had no children and bequeathed his library to the Connecticut Historical Society and left $70,000 in trust to the city of Hartford as a charity fund, the income of which he directed to be annually distributed to the poor. He was Connecticut&#x27;s member on the original Republican National Committee in February 1856.

Niles died in Hartford on May 30, 1856, at the age of 68 and is interred in the city&#x27;s Old North Cemetery

<text>Wilhelm His Jr. (29 December 1863 – 10 November 1934) was a Swiss cardiologist and anatomist, son of Wilhelm His Sr.

In 1893, His discovered the bundle of His, the collection of specialized cardiac muscle cells in the heart that transmits electrical impulses and helps synchronize contraction of the cardiac muscles. Later in life, as a professor of medicine at the University of Berlin, he was one of the first to recognize that &quot;the heartbeat has its origin in the individual cells of heart muscle.&quot;

Werner–His disease (or trench fever) was also named after him.

Angle of His (or incisura cardiaca) was posthumously named after him by Daniel John Cunningham in 1906.

<doc id="762379" wikidata="Q151618" url="?curid=762379" title="Repentance in Judaism">
<text>Repentance (; &quot;return&quot;) is one element of atoning for sin in Judaism. Judaism recognizes that everybody sins on occasion, but that people can stop or minimize those occasions in the future by repenting for past transgressions. Thus, the primary purpose of repentance in Judaism is ethical self-transformation.

Maimonides defines the essence of repentance as follows:

A Jewish penitent is traditionally known as a &quot;baal teshuva&quot;.

==How to repent==

According to &quot;Gates of Repentance&quot;, a standard work of Jewish ethics written by Rabbenu Yonah of Gerona, a sinner repents by:

* regretting/acknowledging the sin;
* forsaking the sin (see below);
* worrying about the future consequences of the sin;
* acting and speaking with humility;
* acting in a way opposite to that of the sin (for example, for the sin of lying, one should speak the truth);
* understanding the magnitude of the sin;
* refraining from lesser sins for the purpose of safeguarding oneself against committing greater sins;
* confessing the sin;
* praying for atonement;
* correcting the sin however possible (for example, if one stole an object, the stolen item must be returned; or, if one slanders another, the slanderer must ask the injured party for forgiveness);
* pursuing works of &quot;chesed&quot; and truth;
* remembering the sin for the rest of one&#x27;s life;
* refraining from committing the same sin if the opportunity presents itself again;
* teaching others not to sin.

===Forsaking the sin===

The second of Rabbenu Yonah&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Repentance&quot; is &quot;forsaking the sin&quot; (Hebrew: עזיבת–החטא, &quot;azivat-hachet&quot;). After regretting the sin (Rabbenu Yonah&#x27;s first principle), the penitent must resolve never to repeat the sin. However, Judaism recognizes that the process of repentance varies from penitent to penitent and from sin to sin. For example, a non-habitual sinner often feels the sting of the sin more acutely than the habitual sinner. Therefore, a non-habitual sinner will have an easier time repenting, because he or she will be less likely to repeat the sinful behavior.

The case of the habitual sinner is more complex. If the habitual sinner regrets his or her sin at all, that regret alone clearly does not translate into a change in behavior. In such a case, Rabbi Nosson Scherman recommends devising &quot;a personal system of reward and punishment&quot; and avoiding circumstances that may cause temptation toward the relevant sin. One is shown to have fully repented if they are presented with an opportunity to perform the same sin under the same conditions, yet they manage to refrain from doing so.

The Mishnah states:
==When to repent==
One should repent immediately. A parable is told in the Talmud that Rabbi Eliezer taught his disciples, &quot;Repent one day before your death.&quot; The disciples politely questioned whether one can know the day of one&#x27;s death, so Rabbi Eliezer answered, &quot;All the more reason, therefore, to repent today, lest one die tomorrow.&quot;

Because of Judaism&#x27;s understanding of the annual process of Divine Judgment, Jews believe that God is especially open to repentance during the period from the beginning of the month of Elul through the Ten Days of Repentance (including Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur), and, according to Kabbalah, Hoshana Rabbah. Another good time to repent is toward the end of one&#x27;s life. Another occasion on which forgiveness is granted is whenever the entire community gathers and cries out to God full-heartedly due to their distress.

==Effects==
The Talmud debates the spiritual level of a person who has repented (a &quot;baal teshuvah&quot;). According to one opinion, this level is lower than that of a &quot;fully righteous&quot; person who has never sinned. According to another opinion, though, it is even higher than that of a fully righteous person.

The Talmud makes two statements about the power of repentance to transform one&#x27;s past sins: If one repents out of fear, the intentional sins are turned into unintentional sins. But if one repents out of love, the intentional sins actually become merits. The first statement can be easily understood, in that if one committed the sin unaware of its consequences (e.g. punishment), and subsequently becomes aware, the sin was committed in a state of incomplete knowledge. The second statement is harder to understand, and different interpretations have been suggested. According to Joseph Dov Soloveitchik, the meaning is that a person who repents out of love embarks on a journey of self-transformation, in which they use the pain of their failure as a spur to self-improvement. Thus, the magnitude of the original sin is eventually reflected in the magnitude of the good traits which the penitent develops in response.

==Commentary==
According to the Talmud, God created repentance before He created the physical universe, making it among the first things created.

Jewish tradition describes many people who repented, including:
*In 609 BCE King Josiah of Israel was killed in battle by Pharaoh Necho II; Josiah&#x27;s death was brought about because, despite his sincere religious reform, he had in fact been deceived as the people did not follow his reforms; thus he refused to heed the Prophet Jeremiah, thinking that no sword would pass through the Land of Israel. He was struck by 300 darts; he made no complaint except to acknowledge &quot;The Lord is righteous, for I rebelled against His commandment. 
*After Passover in CE 44, Herod Agrippa went to Caesarea, where he had games performed in honor of Claudius. In the midst of his speech to the public, a cry went out that he was a god, and Agrippa did not then publicly react. At this time he saw an owl perched over his head. During his imprisonment by Tiberius, a similar omen had been interpreted as portending his speedy release and future kingship, with the warning that should he behold the same sight again, he would die. He was immediately smitten with violent pains, scolded his friends for flattering him, and accepted his imminent death in a state of Teshuva. He experienced heart pains and pain in his abdomen and died after five days.

If a person strays from the path of goodness in some aspect, there is always a &quot;way back&quot; if a person wills to try taking it. (Although texts mention some specific categories for whom the way back will be exceedingly hard, such as the slanderer, the habitual gossiper, and the malicious person.)

<text>Frederic Edward Weatherly, KC (4 October 1848 – 7 September 1929) was an English lawyer, author, lyricist and broadcaster. He was christened and brought up using the name Frederick Edward Weatherly, and appears to have adopted the spelling &#x27;Frederic&#x27; later in life. He is estimated to have written the lyrics to at least 3,000 popular songs, among the best-known of which are the sentimental ballad &quot;Danny Boy&quot; set to the tune &quot;Londonderry Air&quot;, the religious &quot;The Holy City&quot;, and the wartime song &quot;Roses of Picardy&quot;.

== Life and career ==
Weatherly was born and brought up in Portishead, Somerset, England, the eldest son in the large family of Frederick Weatherly (1820–1910), a medical doctor, and his wife, Julia Maria, &quot;née&quot; Ford (1823–98). His birth was registered in the Bedminster district of Bristol in the fourth quarter of 1848, and the 1851 census shows the family living at 5 Wood Hill, Portishead. He was educated at Hereford Cathedral School from 1859 to 1867, and he won a scholarship to Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1867. Among his tutors was Walter Pater, who taught him about Italian art. Weatherly entered three times for the Newdigate Prize for poetry—without success. In 1868, he helped out members of the Brasenose rowing team under Walter Bradford Woodgate, who had practised for the Stewards&#x27; Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta without a cox. The race at the time was for coxed fours, and Weatherly volunteered to start the race with them and immediately jump out of the boat. He did so—and the team won—but they were disqualified. Woodgate had made his point, and the race was later changed to one for coxless fours. Weatherly graduated with a degree in Classics in 1871, and in 1872 he married Anna Maria Hardwick (generally called &quot;Minnie&quot;) of Axbridge in Somerset (d. 1920), with whom he had a son and two daughters. Weatherly and his wife later lived apart, and on the night of the 1881 census he is recorded as being on his own with his three young children and four servants at his house, Sevensprings, South Parks Road, Oxford. Weatherly and his wife later separated (around 1900).

Weatherly remained in Oxford, briefly working as a schoolmaster and then as a private tutor until 1887 when he qualified as a barrister, practising first in London and then in the west of England. The 1901 census records him living as a boarder at 2 Harley Place in Clifton, Bristol. The 1911 census shows him aged 62 living at 12 Penn Lea Road, Lower Weston, Bath, in Somerset, with a Maude Eugenie Beatrice Weatherly, aged 53, from Esher in Surrey (who is recorded as his wife of nine years&#x27; standing), and their two servants. In fact, Weatherly and his wife Minnie never divorced: Maude Francfort used the name Weatherly while they lived together as husband and wife in Bath. Minnie lived on in seclusion in Portishead, financially supported by her husband until her death in 1920. The children remained loyal to her. Some time after 1911, Frederic and Maude moved to Grosvenor Lodge (now St Christopher&#x27;s) in Belmont Road, Combe Down, just outside Bath.

Weatherly remained active both as an author and as a barrister until the end of his life. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote of his dual career, &quot;His fertility was extraordinary, and though it is easy to be contemptuous of his drawing-room lyrics, sentimental, humorous and patriotic, which are said to number about 3,000 altogether, it is certain that no practising barrister has ever before provided so much innocent pleasure.&quot; He celebrated his golden jubilee as a songwriter in 1919, at a dinner given for him by publishers and composers with whom he had been associated over the past fifty years. In his last years he was much in demand as a lecturer, broadcaster and after-dinner speaker.

In early 1923, Maude Francfort died, and on 2 August 1923 Weatherly married Miriam Bryan, &quot;née&quot; Davies (d. 1941), widow of a well-known tenor, John Bryan. She had been nurse/companion to Maude in her final years. He was made a King&#x27;s Counsel, a senior barrister, in 1926. In the same year he published an autobiography, &quot;Piano and Gown&quot;. He died at his home, Bathwick Lodge, Bath, after a short illness on 7 September 1929, at the age of 80. At his funeral in Bath Abbey, the Londonderry Air, to which he had written the well-known words, was played as a voluntary. He was buried at Smallcombe Cemetery. A plaque unveiled by Dame Clara Butt commemorates him at 10 Edward St in Bath.

== Works ==
The first of Weatherly&#x27;s well-known works was the hymn &quot;The Holy City&quot;, written in 1892 to music by the British composer Stephen Adams. The song includes the refrain &quot;Jerusalem, Jerusalem!&quot;. He wrote the song &quot;Danny Boy&quot; while living in Bath in 1910, but it did not meet with much success. In 1912 his sister-in-law Margaret Enright Weatherly in America suggested an old Irish tune called &quot;Londonderry Air&quot;, which he had never heard before. Margaret had learned the tune from her Irish-born father Dennis. The tune matched his lyrics almost perfectly. He published the now-famous song in 1913. His ballad &quot;Roses of Picardy&quot;, written in 1916 and set to music by Haydn Wood, was one of the most famous songs from World War I.

Of his huge output of songs, Weatherly listed a selection of 61 titles in his &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; entry. In addition to the above, they were: &quot;Nancy Lee&quot;; &quot;The Midshipmite&quot;; &quot;Polly&quot;; &quot;They all love Jack&quot;; &quot;Jack&#x27;s Yarn&quot;; &quot;The Old Brigade&quot;; &quot;The Deathless Army&quot;; &quot;To the Front&quot;; &quot;John Bull&quot;; &quot;Darby and Joan&quot;; &quot;When We are Old and Grey&quot;; &quot;Auntie&quot;; &quot;The Chimney Corner&quot;; &quot;The Children&#x27;s Home&quot;; &quot;The Old Maids of Lee&quot;; &quot;The Men of Ware&quot;; &quot;The Devoted Apple&quot;; &quot;To-morrow will be Friday&quot;; &quot;Douglas Gordon&quot;; &quot;Sleeping Tide&quot;; &quot;The Star of Bethlehem&quot;; &quot;Beauty&#x27;s Eyes&quot;; &quot;In Sweet September&quot;; &quot;Bid me Good-bye&quot;; &quot;The Last Watch&quot;; &quot;London Bridge&quot;; &quot;The King&#x27;s Highway&quot;; &quot;Go to Sea&quot;; &quot;Veteran&#x27;s Song&quot;; &quot;Up from Somerset&quot;; &quot;Beyond the Dawn&quot;; &quot;Nirvana&quot;; &quot;Mifanwy&quot;; &quot;Sergeant of the Line&quot;; &quot;Stone-cracker John&quot;; &quot;Ailsa Mine&quot;; &quot;Old Black Mare&quot;; &quot;Coolan Dhu&quot;; &quot;Three for Jack&quot;; &quot;Bhoy I Love&quot;; &quot;The Blue Dragoons&quot;; &quot;At Santa Barbara&quot;; &quot;The Grenadier&quot;; &quot;Reuben Ranzo&quot;; &quot;Dinder Courtship&quot;; &quot;Friend o&#x27;Mine&quot;; &quot;When You Come Home&quot;; &quot;Little Road Home&quot;; &quot;Greenhills of Somerset&quot;; &quot;Danny Boy&quot;; &quot;As you pass by&quot;; &quot;Ships of my dreams&quot;; &quot;Why shouldn&#x27;t I?&quot;; &quot;When Noah Went-a-sailing&quot;; &quot;Time to go&quot;; &quot;Chumleigh Fair&quot;; &quot;Our Little Home&quot;; &quot;The Bristol Pageant, Music Composed by Hubert Hunt in 1924&quot; and &quot;Little Lady of the Moon&quot;.

Weatherly&#x27;s prose publications include &quot;Wilton School&quot;, (1872); &quot;The Rudiments of Logic, Inductive and Deductive&quot;, (1879); &quot;Oxford Days: or How Ross got his Degree&quot;, (1879); &quot;Questions in Logic, Progressive and General&quot;, (1883) and &quot;Musical and Dramatic Copyright&quot; (1890), with Edward Cutler. He published several collections of verse including &quot;Muriel and other Poems&quot;; &quot;Dresden China and other Songs&quot;; and &quot;Songs for Michael, 1927&quot;. Beatrix Potter&#x27;s first signed illustrations were published in &quot;A Happy Pair&quot;, a book of verse written by Weatherly.

Weatherly also worked in opera, making English translations of &quot;Pagliacci&quot; and &quot;Cavalleria rusticana,&quot; for Covent Garden and writing the lyrics for the 1894 premiere of &quot;Mirette&quot; at the Savoy Theatre.

<text>Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1946 were conducted by methods refashioned and then fashioned again during the year. As in 1945, the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from recent players, and elected no one. Also, as in 1945, the Old Timers Committee responded by electing the biggest class yet, then 10 and now 11 people: Jesse Burkett, Frank Chance, Jack Chesbro, Johnny Evers, Clark Griffith, Tommy McCarthy, Joe McGinnity, Eddie Plank, Joe Tinker, Rube Waddell, and Ed Walsh.

The election of the 11 players was announced in April 1946. At that time, Burkett, Evers, Griffith, Tinker, and Walsh were still living. The June 13, 1946, induction ceremony in Cooperstown, New York, honored former Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who had been elected to the Hall of Fame shortly after his death in late 1944. The players elected in 1946 were inducted—along with players elected the following year—on July 21, 1947, in Cooperstown. Johnny Evers had died in March 1947, and of the four inductees still living, only Ed Walsh was at the ceremony.

Most of those &quot;old timers&quot; were star players from the 1900s and 1910s rather than the 19th century. Afterward, the jurisdiction of the BBWAA was formally reduced to cover only players who retired during the last 25 years; for the 1947 election, those would be players active in 1922 and later. Perhaps the relatively narrow scope would help the writers concentrate their votes on a few candidates. To make certain, the rules for 1947 provided for a runoff ballot in case of no winner on the first ballot. Also, on December 3, 1946, the BBWAA limited voting to writers who had been members for at least 10 years.

==BBWAA election==
Because the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA) had failed to elect any candidates in 1945, and had elected only one player since 1939, the previous delay of three years between elections had been eliminated in September 1945 by the Hall of Fame Committee, and annual elections restored. In response to the high number of candidates drawing votes in the 1945 election, a two-step ballot process was created to narrow the field for a final vote. The first ballot would proceed in the same manner as previous elections, with voters free to name any 10 candidates. However, there would be no possibility of any inductees being elected in this vote; instead, the top 20 candidates would proceed to a final ballot. In order for any candidate to be elected, at least 200 ballots would have to be cast in each phase of the election.

In addition to the field being narrowed in this manner, it was hoped that the absence of several previously popular candidates would clear the way for others; the 10 players elected by the Old-Timers Committee in 1945 had received 26% of the vote in the last BBWAA election, and had included seven of the top 16 candidates. It was hoped that the revised approach and reduced field of candidates would result in up to five new members of the Hall annually.

===Nominating stage===
Members of the BBWAA again had the authority to select any players active in the 20th century (after 1900), provided they had not appeared in a major league game in 1945. Voters were instructed to cast votes for 10 candidates. The top 20 candidates would advance to the final ballot, but the vote totals from the first ballot would not be revealed until the second election was over.

In addition, the Hall of Fame Committee had instituted a set of criteria for the voters to observe in completing their ballot; for each candidate, they were to take into consideration:
#playing ability
#integrity
#sportsmanship
#character
#contribution to the team on which they played and to baseball in general.

A total of 202 ballots were cast, with 1,948 individual votes for 76 specific candidates, an average of 9.64 per ballot; due to a tie for 20th place, the top 21 candidates (those who had received 39 or more votes) were announced on January 3, 1946, and advanced to the final ballot.

Even following the previous year&#x27;s election of several players from that era, the emphasis on the stars of the 1900s and 1910s – who many voters felt should be given priority – was again evident, although not quite at the levels seen previously. Only five of the top 14 candidates in the voting, and none of the top five, had seen any substantial play since 1917; only two of the top 26, and none of the top 19, had played their final season anytime between 1918 and 1933. Players who had been retired over 28 years—35 of the 76 named—received 53% of the votes. No player received 75% of the vote in this stage; even if the rules had allowed a selection at this point, none would have occurred.

Individuals who were barred from baseball were still not officially ineligible. Shoeless Joe Jackson received two votes; this was the first time since 1937 that anyone who had been thrown out of baseball had received any votes, and it would be the last time any such candidate received any recognized votes. Candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in &quot;italics&quot;; players selected by the Old-Timers Committee in 1946 are marked with an asterisk (*).


===Final ballot===
The 21 final candidates were listed on the ballot in alphabetical order, as their vote totals in the first round had not been revealed. Because no more than five selections were desired at this time, voters were restricted to voting for their top five choices; this, of course, did not allow for the fact that candidates were less likely to be among a voter&#x27;s top five choices than they were to be among his top ten, thus making any selections &quot;less&quot; probable than they otherwise might have been. A total of 263 ballots were cast, with 1318 individual votes for the 21 candidates; 198 votes were required for election. The results were announced on January 23, 1946.

For the second year in a row, no candidate gained the necessary number of votes, with none even coming within 40 of the required total. As might have been mathematically projected, every candidate got a &quot;lower&quot; percentage of the vote than they had received on the nomination ballot. As a result of the restriction to five choices, only four candidates received even half the necessary votes for election. Again, an emphasis on the earliest candidates was evident; the top six candidates were all retired by 1917, while the bottom four were all active in 1934 or later, with the eleven candidates who were retired over 23 years receiving 65% of the vote.

The continuing inability to elect anyone created an even greater clamor for radical revision of the selection method. Some suggested that perhaps a lower threshold than 75% was advisable; others proposed that the final ballot should include only ten names, with voters choosing the top five. The Hall of Fame Committee, meeting in April and again in December, found it necessary to again overhaul the election method.

All of the candidates on the ballot were elected by 1955, with the exception of manager Miller Huggins, who was elected in 1964.

==Old-Timers Committee==
After its 1945 selections, the committee had intended to review the pitchers from the pre-1910 era and to also re-focus on the earlier 19th century players; but after the BBWAA had failed to select any inductees for the second year in a row, and with only one player chosen by the BBWAA since 1939, it was generally accepted that a dramatic revision of the election process by the Hall of Fame Committee was necessary. The committee firmly agreed that any flaws in the rules were causing errors of omission rather than ones of liberality in selections, and that the wide field of candidates from the entire 20th century was making it unlikely that any candidate could draw 75% of the vote from the BBWAA.

The committee members were: Hall of Fame president Stephen C. Clark, who chaired the committee; Hall of Fame treasurer Paul S. Kerr, the committee secretary; former Yankees president Ed Barrow; Athletics owner/manager Connie Mack; former Braves president Bob Quinn; and Boston sportswriter Mel Webb. New York sportswriter Harry Cross, who had been named in February to fill the vacancy created by the death of Sid Mercer, also died, on April 4. On April 23, the members of the committee met in New York City to consider their selections and to make further revisions in the election process. In May, Grantland Rice was named to fill the vacancy on the committee, and another major revision in the BBWAA voting process was enacted at their meeting in December.

===Selections===
The committee determined that the candidates from the early part of the century were gaining the most support, but would likely never reach the necessary threshold of 75% because many younger writers were reluctant to vote for players about whom they had limited first-hand knowledge. In 1945 the committee had believed that only a handful of those early candidates whose careers bridged the turn of the century needed to be removed from BBWAA consideration in order to facilitate elections; they were now more certain that they needed to select players whose careers &quot;began&quot; after 1900, and extended through the 1910s, in order to break the deadlock in the BBWAA voting. There was even some support on the committee from eliminating the BBWAA from the process entirely, due to their inability for several years to agree on appropriate inductees.

The committee selected 11 inductees – five of whom were still living – including the first two left-handed pitchers to reach the Hall. They were formally inducted on July 21, 1947, with National League president Ford Frick officiating; however, of the four still living at that time (Johnny Evers died in the interim), only Ed Walsh attended the ceremonies:

*Jesse Burkett, a left fielder who played primarily for Cleveland and St. Louis from 1890 to 1905; he compiled a .338 career batting average, hitting over .400 twice and winning three batting titles. His 240 hits in 1896 stand as the 19th century record, and his 2850 career hits ranked behind only Cap Anson&#x27;s total upon his retirement. His ability to foul off pitches was a factor in baseball&#x27;s move to count fouls as strikes. He later won four pennants as a minor league manager before coaching at Holy Cross and then becoming a scout for the New York Giants.
*Frank Chance, the first baseman and manager, known as the &quot;Peerless Leader&quot;, of the great Chicago Cubs teams from 1898 to 1912. The team won four pennants in five seasons from 1906 to 1910, winning a record 116 games in 1906 for a .763 winning percentage. He was widely considered baseball&#x27;s best right-handed first baseman, and remains the only player at that position to steal 400 bases. He later managed the Yankees and Red Sox, and had been hired to manage the White Sox before dying at age 47.
*Jack Chesbro, a spitball pitcher from 1899 to 1909, winning 198 games. His 41 wins in 1904 stand as the modern record, and he won over 20 three other times. He led both leagues once each in wins and winning percentage.
*Johnny Evers, the star second baseman on the Cubs and Boston Braves from 1902 to 1917, he was named the NL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player in 1914 with the &quot;Miracle Braves.&quot; Arriving in the majors when he weighed under 100 pounds (45 kg), he was consistently one of the sport&#x27;s most dynamic figures, and his alertness helped capture the 1908 pennant with a famous defensive move. He was a manager or coach for four teams from 1920 to 1932, later working as a scout.
*Clark Griffith, a pitcher who won 237 games between 1891 and 1906, collecting over 20 wins seven times. He managed four teams from 1901 to 1920, winning the first AL pennant with the White Sox; he not only managed the Washington Senators from 1912 to 1920, but became the majority owner of the team from 1919 until his death in 1955.
*Tommy McCarthy, an outfielder and excellent baserunner from 1884 to 1896 who played a notable role on the Boston teams of the early 1890s. Along with center fielder Hugh Duffy, he was known as one of the &quot;Heavenly Twins&quot; for his defensive ability. He also played a part in developing important aspects of defensive strategy and team signals.
*Joe McGinnity, a pitcher from 1899 to 1908 who won over 20 games eight times, and over 30 twice. Known as &quot;Iron Man&quot; for his durability and stamina, he pitched complete double-headers five times, including three times in one month, and once won five games in six days. He won nearly 500 games in a professional career which lasted until he was in his fifties.
*Eddie Plank, a left-handed pitcher from 1901 to 1917, primarily with the Philadelphia Athletics, he won 20 games eight times and was a mainstay of the pitching staff on six pennant winners. He was the first left-hander to win 200 games, and kept going until he finished with 326 victories – the most by a left-hander until 1962, and still the AL record.
*Joe Tinker, shortstop on the Cubs from 1902 to 1912 and a daring baserunner, later the player-manager of the Chicago Federal League team, winning that league&#x27;s pennant in 1915. The defensive standout led the NL in fielding average four times. After retiring as a player, he became a minor league manager and executive, and a scout for the Cubs.
*Rube Waddell, a pitcher from 1897 to 1910, the unpredictable left-handed pitcher starred for the Athletics from 1902 to 1907; he set numerous strikeout records, leading the AL in each of his seasons with the A&#x27;s and notching a record 349 in 1904. Out of the major leagues at 33, he died at the age of 37.
*Ed Walsh, a spitball pitcher from 1904 to 1917, almost all with the Chicago White Sox, he peaked from 1906 to 1912 when he won 24 games or more four times, including 40 wins in 1908. His career ERA of 1.82 remains the lowest in major league history. He played a major role on the 1906 &quot;Hitless Wonders&quot; which won the World Series, and pitched a no-hitter in 1911. He was later an AL umpire for one year, and then coached the Sox for several seasons.

The committee had followed up on its intent to review most of the popular pitching candidates of the era, but took no further action on the candidacies, proposed one year earlier, of Abner Doubleday and Franklin Roosevelt. They also took no action on additional stars such as Jim &quot;Deacon&quot; White from the era before 1890, an area in which selections had continually been postponed.

===Honor Rolls of Baseball===

The Hall of Fame Committee also announced the creation of the Honor Rolls of Baseball, which would be displayed at the museum, featuring the names of significant non-players in four areas. This second-tier list consisted of five managers, 11 umpires, 11 executives and 12 sportswriters. These contributors were not designated as official Hall of Fame members, so plaques on the wall were not authorized, as they were reserved only for those outstanding players, along with certain pioneers of the game.

*Executives: Ernest Barnard, Ed Barrow, John E. Bruce, John T. Brush, Barney Dreyfuss, Charles Ebbets, August Herrmann, John Heydler, Bob Quinn, Arthur Soden, Nicholas Young
*Managers: Bill Carrigan, Ned Hanlon, Miller Huggins, Frank Selee, John Montgomery Ward
*Umpires: Tom Connolly, Bill Dinneen, Bob Emslie, Billy Evans, John Gaffney, Tim Hurst, Kick Kelly, Bill Klem, Thomas Lynch, Silk O&#x27;Loughlin, Jack Sheridan
*Sportswriters: Walter Barnes, Harry Cross, William B. Hanna, Frank Hough, Sid Mercer, Tim Murnane, Francis Richter, Irving Sanborn, John B. Sheridan, William J. Slocum, George Tidden, Joe Vila

Of the 39 honorees, eight were still living: Barrow (died 1953), Carrigan (d. 1969), Connolly (d. 1961), Dinneen (d. 1955), Evans (d. 1956), Heydler (d. 1956), Klem (d. 1951), and Quinn (d. 1954).

The committee was clear that anyone named to the Honor Rolls would still be eligible for induction to the Hall of Fame, per the Hall&#x27;s selection processes. Of those named to the Honor Rolls of Baseball, nine have subsequently been inducted to the Hall of Fame, all through selection of the Veterans Committee:

* Ed Barrow (1953)
* Tom Connolly (1953)
* Barney Dreyfuss (2008)
* Billy Evans (1973)
* Ned Hanlon (1996)
* Miller Huggins (1964)
* Bill Klem (1953)
* Frank Selee (1999)
* John Montgomery Ward (1964)
Additionally, two sportswriters named to the Honor Rolls have subsequently been awarded the BBWAA Career Excellence Award (previously known as the J. G. Taylor Spink Award): Sid Mercer (1969) and Tim Murnane (1978).

===Criticism and rationale===
Whereas the committee&#x27;s 1945 selections met with criticism only in later years, complaints regarding their moves in 1946 began more immediately. The committee had not yet outlined the revised voting rules for BBWAA elections, and many observers felt that the BBWAA&#x27;s privilege of selecting 20th century players was being infringed. It was widely suggested that the committee should either reform the BBWAA&#x27;s voting rules or eliminate the writers entirely from the process; it was also noted that there was still plenty of work for the committee in selecting further 19th century inductees. Criticism was also directed at the Honor Rolls, which had been created by the committee without any popular request; many felt that the Roll was a backhanded, secondary honor for individuals who had perhaps earned full membership in the Hall, and that the committee had simply established it as an excuse for inaction regarding non-playing candidates. It was further noted that managers (Connie Mack), executives (Ban Johnson), sportswriters (Henry Chadwick) and pioneers (Alexander Cartwright) were already included among the Hall&#x27;s members, indicating that it had not been intended as an honor solely for players. Probably as a result of this criticism, there were never any additions to the Honor Rolls.

Specific, individual criticism regarding the 11 inductees selected by the committee was not as immediate, although the choices included some which have come to be met with greater disapproval than any of the 1945 choices; McCarthy has been described as the worst player in the Hall of Fame. Again, it is reasonably clear to discern the several factors which the committee likely found most important in making their selections in both 1945 and 1946:
#The committee&#x27;s primary focus in both years was dealing with the failure of two consecutive BBWAA elections. In helping to ease the BBWAA&#x27;s task, they initially intended only to select popular candidates whose peak years were before 1905; but they later decided that clearing the BBWAA logjam would require that they forgo their earlier limitation to the 19th century, and cover the entire period before 1920. As a result, almost all of their 21 selections over the two years played in the 25-year period between 1893 (when baseball moved the pitcher back 10 feet from the plate) and 1917; all of their selections were active players in 1893 or later, with 11 playing their entire careers within that span. Only 4 enjoyed their peak years before 1893, including 3 selected in 1945: Dan Brouthers, Mike &quot;King&quot; Kelly, Jim O&#x27;Rourke, and the newly added Tommy McCarthy. Fully 17 were active after 1900, and 7 were active after 1910.
#The committee was selecting the most popular candidates from the BBWAA voting; had they instead selected players who received scant support from the BBWAA, they would have been far more heavily criticized for overriding the writers&#x27; judgment. With their selections over two years, they had chosen 15 of the 18 candidates who had retired by 1920 and who had received at least 10% of the vote in either year&#x27;s election; every non-pitcher retired before 1920 who had &quot;ever&quot; received over 10% of the BBWAA vote had now been elected to the Hall or (in Miller Huggins&#x27; case) named to the Roll of Honor. Jesse Burkett, also elected, was the only player retired before 1910 who received more than 1 vote in the 1946 election. 4 of the committee&#x27;s other selections had retired before 1900 and were not eligible for BBWAA consideration. The BBWAA members who supported the selection of these inductees are more appropriate targets for criticism than the Old-Timers Committee, which was essentially confirming their votes; the committee elected the same candidates the BBWAA had been &quot;trying&quot; to elect.
#Throughout this period, most voters and media observers supported the idea of choosing players who had remained in the sport as managers, coaches or executives after retiring. A majority of the selections were major league managers at some point, with eight leading their teams to pennants. Five of the inductees each served at least five seasons as coaches in the major leagues; Burkett and Hugh Duffy worked as scouts for several years. Every retired manager with over 1000 victories had now been either elected to the Hall or placed in the Roll of Honor. Here follow the names of the 21 managers who had won over 750 major league games prior to 1946, only 3 of whom were retired but had not yet received either recognition; those who had been selected by 1946 are shown in &quot;italics&quot;:
##&quot;Connie Mack&quot; – 3387 (active)
##&quot;John McGraw&quot; – 2763
##Joe McCarthy – 1880 (active) (elected by Veterans Committee, 1957)
##Bill McKechnie – 1832 (active) (elected by Veterans Committee, 1962)
##&quot;Fred Clarke&quot; – 1602
##Bucky Harris – 1456 (active) (elected by Veterans Committee, 1975)
##&quot;Clark Griffith&quot; – 1491
##Miller Huggins – 1413 (Roll of Honor) (elected by Veterans Committee, 1964)
##&quot;Wilbert Robinson&quot; – 1399
##Ned Hanlon – 1313 (Roll of Honor) (elected by Veterans Committee, 1996)
##&quot;Cap Anson&quot; – 1292
##Frank Selee – 1284 (Roll of Honor) (elected by Veterans Committee, 1999)
##&quot;Hughie Jennings&quot; – 1184
##Joe Cronin – 1049 (active) (elected by BBWAA, 1956)
##Harry Wright – 1000 (elected by Veterans Committee, 1953)
##&quot;Frank Chance&quot; – 946
##Frankie Frisch – 935 (active) (elected by BBWAA, 1947)
##Jimmy Dykes – 889 (active)
##George Stallings – 879
##&quot;Charles Comiskey&quot; – 839
##Bill Terry – 823 (elected by BBWAA, 1954)
#The committee had elected players at positions which were not yet represented in the Hall. By 1945, the BBWAA had elected 20th century players at every position except catcher, third base and left field; these omissions were corrected through the elections of Roger Bresnahan, Jimmy Collins, and Fred Clarke respectively. The 1946 selections of Eddie Plank and Rube Waddell corrected the absence of any left-handed pitchers.
#There was a strong emphasis on those who had played central roles on championship teams, particularly the 3-time champion Baltimore Orioles of 1894-95-96 (4 inducted members), and the powerhouse Chicago Cubs teams which won 4 pennants between 1906 and 1910 (3 inducted members). 16 of the 21 inductees had been regulars on a world championship team; all except Burkett and Ed Delahanty had played for a pennant winner. Of the 21 selections, 15 had been a starting player, manager or owner for at least three pennant winners.
#The committee evidently chose to include players who had accomplished noteworthy feats in single seasons, particularly establishing single-season records (Jack Chesbro, Duffy and Waddell), and winning multiple batting titles (Brouthers, Burkett, Delahanty).
#The committee included groups of players who were closely associated with one another in baseball lore, such as Chicago&#x27;s infield combination of Tinker, Evers and Chance, and Boston&#x27;s &quot;Heavenly Twins&quot; outfield in the early 1890s of Duffy and McCarthy.
