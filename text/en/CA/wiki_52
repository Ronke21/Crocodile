<text>Project Babylon was a space gun project commissioned by then Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. It involved building a series of &quot;superguns&quot;. The design was based on research from the 1960s Project HARP led by the Canadian artillery expert Gerald Bull. There were most likely four different devices in the program.

The project began in 1988; it was halted in 1990 after Bull was assassinated, and parts of the superguns were seized in transit around Europe. The components that remained in Iraq were destroyed by the United Nations after the 1991 Persian Gulf War.

==Devices==
===Baby Babylon===
The first of these superguns, &quot;Baby Babylon&quot;, was a horizontally mounted device which was a prototype for test purposes. It had a bore of 350 mm (13.8 inches), and a barrel length of 46 metres (151 feet), and weighed some 102 tonnes. After conducting tests with lead projectiles, this gun was set up on a hillside at a 45-degree angle. It was expected to achieve a range of 750 km. Although its mass was similar to some World War II German &quot;large-calibre guns&quot;, it was not designed to be a mobile weapon and was not considered a security risk by Israel.

===Big Babylon===
The second supergun, &quot;Big Babylon&quot;, of which a pair were planned (one to be mounted horizontally, at least for test purposes), was much larger. The barrel was to be 156 metres (512 feet) long, with a bore of 1 metre (3.3 feet). Originally intended to be suspended by cables from a steel framework, it would have been over 100 metres (300 feet) high at the tip. The complete device weighed about 2,100 tonnes (the barrel alone weighed 1,655 tons). It was a space gun intended to shoot projectiles into orbit, a theme of Bull&#x27;s work since Project HARP. Neither of these devices could be elevated or trained, making them useless for direct military purposes, unless some form of terminal guidance could be used to direct the fired projectile onto its intended target.

It is possible that Big Babylon was intended both to launch satellites and to serve as a weapon, but its ability to fire conventional projectiles in the latter role would have been very limited: in addition to the impossibility of aiming it, it would have had a slow rate of fire, and its firing would have produced a very pronounced &quot;signature&quot; which would have revealed its location. Since it was immobile, it suffered from the same vulnerability as Germany&#x27;s V-3 cannon, which the RAF readily destroyed in 1944. Also, Iraq already had Scud missiles which were far more effective than the outdated supergun technology.

===Future plans===

Very large cannons, which would be capable of being elevated and trained, were also planned. The first was to have a bore of 350 mm (13.8 inches) and a barrel length of about 30 metres (100 feet), and it was expected to have a range of up to 1000 kilometres (about 625 miles), making Israel and central Iran well within reach of Iraqi artillery fire.

==Outcome==
The metal tubes for the barrels and gun cradles were purchased from firms in the United Kingdom, including Sheffield Forgemasters of South Yorkshire, and Walter Somers of Halesowen. Other components, such as breeches and recoil mechanisms, were ordered from firms in Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland, and Italy. Baby Babylon was completed, and test shots were fired from it, revealing problems with the seals between the barrel segments. As those were being worked on, Bull was assassinated in March 1990, possibly by Mossad, halting the project.

Most of the barrel sections for Big Babylon were delivered to, and assembled on, a site excavated on a hillside, instead of being suspended by cables from a steel framework as originally planned. Calculations had shown that the original support framework would be insufficiently rigid. It was never completed.

In early April 1990, United Kingdom customs officers confiscated several pieces of the second Big Babylon barrel, which were disguised as &quot;petrochemical pressure vessels&quot;. The parts were confiscated at Teesport Docks. More pieces were seized in Greece and Turkey in transit by truck to Iraq. Other components, such as slide bearings for Big Babylon, were seized at their manufacturers&#x27; sites in Spain and Switzerland.

After the Gulf War in 1991, the Iraqis admitted the existence of Project Babylon, and allowed UN inspectors to destroy the hardware in Iraq as part of the disarmament process.

Several barrel sections seized by UK customs officers are displayed at the Royal Armouries, Fort Nelson, Portsmouth. Another section was on display at The Royal Artillery Museum, Woolwich, London, until 2016.

==In media==
The events of Project Babylon are dramatized in the 1994 HBO movie &quot;Doomsday Gun&quot; starring Frank Langella as Bull, with Kevin Spacey, Alan Arkin, and Clive Owen in supporting roles, and in Frederick Forsyth&#x27;s novel &quot;The Fist of God&quot;.

The novel &quot;Splinter Cell&quot;, written by Raymond Benson under the pseudonym David Michaels, refers to Project Babylon and Gerald Bull as the antagonists in the story who develop and manage to fire a new supergun, &quot;Babylon Phoenix.&quot;

The novel &quot;Nature of the Beast&quot; by Louise Penny also revolves around the story of Gerald Bull and Project Babylon.

The Babylon Project also provided the inspiration for the &quot;Golgo 13&quot; manga story &quot;The Gun at Am-Shara&quot;, in which the title character assassinates a fictionalized version of Gerald Bull.

In &quot;&quot;, the Babylon guns are the objective of the final mission, requiring the player to mark them for airstrikes.

The video game &quot;&quot; reimagined the gun as the &quot;Type 07 supergun&quot;.

<doc id="771351" wikidata="Q2586944" url="?curid=771351" title="Megarian Decree">
<text>The Megarian Decree was a set of economic sanctions levied upon Megara c. 432 BC by the Athenian Empire shortly before the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War. This move is considered one of the first uses of economics as a foreign policy tool. The decree addressed the Megarians&#x27; supposed trespass on land sacred to Demeter known as the Hiera Orgas, the killing of the Athenian herald who was sent to their city to reproach them, and giving shelter to slaves who had fled from Athens. The Megarian decree effectively blocked Megara from trading in any port within the Delian League, isolating the city and greatly damaging its economy. The exact influence the Megarian Decree had on the beginning of the Peloponnesian War is a matter that is highly debated to this day.

== Background ==

The Megarian Decree was seen as an act of revenge by the Athenians for the treacherous behaviour of the Megarians some years earlier. It may also have been a deliberate provocation towards Sparta on the part of Pericles, who was the sponsor of the decree. Aristophanes also cited that it was enacted to avenge the theft of the female attendants of Aspasia, who was Pericles&#x27; partner, but this is generally taken to be a joke at Pericles&#x27; and Aspasia&#x27;s expense. There are scholars who view the Megarian Decree as one of the main causes of the Peloponnesian War.

The economic blockade banned Megarians from harbours and marketplaces throughout the large Athenian Empire, which effectively strangled the Megarian economy. The sanctions would have also affected Megara&#x27;s allies and may have been seen as a move by Athens to weaken its rivals and to extend its influence. Megara controlled the important routes between Peloponnese and Attica, making it crucial for both Athens and Sparta. The ban strained the fragile peace between the two states. The Peloponnesian War began after Megara appealed to Sparta, its ally, for help. In the build-up to the conflict, the repeal of the decree was Sparta&#x27;s main demand to the Athenians. Thucydides mentions that the revoking of the Megarian decree was only one of several demands made by the Spartans if Athens wished to avoid war, other demands included: an end to the siege of Potidaea, the immediate independence of Aegina, and that the Athenians will not infringe on the independence of the Hellenes.

==Significance==

The extent to which the decree encouraged the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War is the subject of debate. The primary source for the war, Thucydides, puts very little emphasis upon the decree in his analysis of the cause of the war and treats it as a pretext on the part of the Spartans. Thucydides considers the true cause of the war to be Sparta&#x27;s fear of Athens&#x27; growing empire. He does not describe the decree in detail, unlike for the conflicts over Potidaea and Corcyra. 

The main evidence for the significance of the decree is Aristophanes, an ancient playwright and satirist of the time. His play &quot;The Acharnians&quot; (II.530-7) mentions how the decree left the Megarians &quot;slowly starving&quot; and caused them to appeal to the Spartans for aid. Another of Aristophanes&#x27;s plays, &quot;Peace&quot;, also mentions how war was being brewed in Megara by the god of war. However, as these are comedic plays meant to entertain, their veracity as historical records are questionable.

Oblique references to the decree in Thucydides seems to suggest its importance since the Spartans state that &quot;war could be avoided if Athens would revoke the Megarian decree&quot;. However, Thucydides also reports that the Spartans had sought a declaration of war from the Peloponnesian League during the rebellion of Samos in 440, well before the Megarian decree had been passed.

Plutarch (Pericles 29) wrote that had the Athenians repealed the Megarian Decree &quot;it seems unlikely that any of the other issues would have brought war down on the Athenians.&quot; For this reason he believed that Pericles, because he was &quot;the most ardent opponent of reconciliation ... alone was responsible for the war.&quot; 

Donald Kagan interprets the decree as an attempt by Athens to solve a problem without breaking the Thirty Years&#x27; Peace with Sparta. Megara had injured Athens in a way that required some meaningful response, but Athens openly attacking the Spartan ally would violate the peace. Athens thus imposed the embargo, which was meant to show other Spartan allies that Athens had commercial means of punishing attackers who were under Sparta&#x27;s military protection. Thus, the decree could be seen as an attempt to avoid provoking Sparta directly.

==Alternative Interpretations==
The historical revisionist G. E. M. de Ste. Croix argues that a trade sanction would not significantly affect Megara as the decree applied only to Megarian citizens although the majority of trade in all cities was likely conducted by metics (foreigners or outsiders), who would be unaffected by a ban on citizens of Megara. The scholar attributed the war to the Spartan zeal for war, which he said was driven by a number of factors such as a sense of invincibility, its vulnerability as a polity, and the danger posed by its massive slave population.

De Ste. Croix also highlights the uncertainty regarding the context in which the decree was passed. At the beginning of the Second Peloponnesian War, the Athenians invaded Megara twice a year with large forces to ravage their land and maintained a naval blockade. After six years, there were few or no remaining crops, which may account for the &quot;starvation&quot; suggested in &quot;The Acharnians&quot;. De Ste. Croix also points out that the decree would have been only effective in a context prior to the war for one year since the Megarians would have had no right of entry to markets in any war situation.

<text>Aquilegia formosa, the crimson columbine, western columbine, or (ambiguously) &quot;red columbine&quot;, is a common wildflower native to western North America, from Alaska to Baja California, and eastward to Montana and Wyoming.

==Description==
&quot;Aquilegia formosa&quot; is a perennial herb that grows to 20–80 cm in height, averaging around 60 cm. Flowers, which can be seen from April to August (with some variation between regions), are about 5 cm long and red and yellow in color. The sepals and petal spurs are typically a reddish-orange color, attributed to the anthocyanin pigments pelargonidin and cyanidin, and carotenoids. Petal blades are yellow, pigmented by carotenoids. The primary pollinators are hummingbirds, although bees, butterflies, and flies will also visit flowers. Despite several floral adaptations to hummingbird pollination, at ~9,000-10,000 feet in elevation in the eastern drainages of the central Sierra Nevada mountains of California, &quot;A. formosa&quot; forms hybrid zones with &quot;Aquilegia pubescens&quot;, which is primarily pollinated by hawk moths.

The flowers are edible, with a sweet taste—though the seeds can be fatal if eaten, and most parts of the plant contain cyanogenic glycosides.

==Distribution==
Within its range, the crimson columbine can be found in most kinds of habitat (chaparral, oak woodland, mixed-evergreen or coniferous forest). It is not found on desert floors, nor at altitudes above 3300 metres, and it is absent from the Central Valley of California. It prefers moist locations such as stream banks.

==Native American use==
Some Plateau Indian tribes used the &quot;Aquilegia formosa&quot; to concoct a perfume. It is also used medicinally by several Native American tribes.

==Etymology==
&quot;Aquilegia&quot; is derived from the Latin word &#x27;aquila&#x27;, meaning &#x27;eagle&#x27;, or possibly from the Medieval German words &#x27;Acheleia&#x27; or &#x27;Akelei&#x27;; this name is in reference to its talon-like nectaries. &quot;Formosa&quot; means &#x27;handsome&#x27;, &#x27;beautiful&#x27;, or &#x27;well-formed&#x27;.

<text>King&#x27;s Highway 101, commonly referred to as Highway 101, is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. The highway connects Highway 17 west of Wawa with Highway 11 in Matheson before continuing east to the Ontario–Quebec border where it becomes Route 388. The highway forms one of the only connections between the two routes of the Trans-Canada Highway between Nipigon and Temagami, and crosses some of the most remote regions of Northern Ontario. Major junctions are located with Highway 129 near Chapleau and Highway 144 southwest of Timmins, though the distance between these junctions is significant.

Highway 101 was first assumed in 1940, though it was not given a numerical designations until 1944. The route initially connected Timmins with Highway 11. In the 1950s and 1960s, it was extended east to the Quebec border and west to the newly opened Highway 17 over Lake Superior. The highway reached its maximum length in 1967, and remained unchanged until 1997, when a section through Timmins was transferred to the responsibility of that city.

== Route description ==

Highway 101 begins in the west at Highway 17 near the town of Wawa and the village of Michipicoten, within Algoma District. Initially proceeding north, the route quickly turns eastward in Wawa and enters the barren expanses of the boreal forest, travelling through uninhabited wilderness for much of its journey across the Canadian Shield. Approximately east of Wawa, the route encounters Highway 547, which travels north to Hawk Junction. From that junction, Highway 101 travels south for several kilometres before resuming its east–west orientation. Just east of The Shoals Provincial Park, the highway crosses the Laurentian Divide, the boundary between the Great Lakes and Arctic Ocean watersheds; a sign and a small picnic area mark the transition. Approximately midway between Wawa and Chapleau, the route enters Sudbury District, through which it continues most of the distance to Timmins.

Approaching Chapleau, Highway 101 encounters Highway 129, onto which it turns northward and becomes concurrent for . Prior to entering the town, Highway 101 branches eastward, passing north of Chapleau Airport and resuming its course through the wilderness. Midway between Chapleau and Timmins, the route passes the village of Foleyet. It briefly travels through Timiskaming District before entering Cochrane District, through which the remainder of the route passes. After entering the city of Timmins, and approximately east of Highway 129, the route meets Highway 144, which travels south to Sudbury. Classified as a city, accelerated development has occurred progressively in the western portion of the municipality , with the urban portion located in the centre of the city. Through the urban portion, Highway 101 is not maintained as a provincial highway and is a local road. This discontinuity begins just east of Kamiskotia Road and continues for to Gervais Street North.
East of Gervais Street North, Highway 101 travels northeast to Hoyle, passing beside several large open pit mines on the outskirts of Timmins. It then turn east and crosses the Frederick House River on the northern shores of Night Hawk Lake. The route passes through the only agricultural area along its journey, travelling straight for the remainder of the distance to Highway 11 west of Matheson. After a concurrency with Highway 11, Highway 101 branches north into Matheson, where it crosses the Black River before curving east. Returning to wilderness, the route zig-zags towards the Ontario–Quebec border near Rouyn-Noranda, travelling several kilometres south of Lake Abitibi. The roadway continues eastward as Quebec Route 388 into the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region. With the exception of an undivided urban four lane section through Timmins, from Government Road in Mountjoy to Gervais Road South in Porcupine, the entire highway is two lanes wide.

== History ==
Highway 67 was the first provincial highway to provide access to Timmins from the Ferguson Highway (Highway 11). When it was designated in mid-1937,
shortly after the merging of the Department of Northern Development into the Department of Highways (DHO), several other roads had been &quot;built&quot; in the area, but hardly improved beyond the clearing of trees. The DHO set forth to construct several new highways in the north.
A concession road between Hoyle and Matheson already existed at this point, and over the next several years it was reconstructed to provincial standards. On June 26, 1940, the route was designated as a provincial highway. However, it was not numbered on official maps.
During World War II, plans arose to connect Timmins with the Quebec border, and the route via Matheson was chosen as the most direct path. By the end of the war, the road between Hoyle and Matheson had been numbered as Highway 101 and extended eastward to Abitibi, ending at Garrison Creek.
The route remained this way for several years.

The Trans-Canada Highway Act was passed in 1950 and provided the impetus to construct Highway 17 around Lake Superior, which was carried out over the course of the decade.
This resulted in the planning of a new road to connect Highway 11 with Highway 17; it was decided that Highway 101 would be extended west as the new connector highway. In order to accommodate this future extension, the section of Highway 67 between Timmins and Hoyle was renumbered as Highway 101 in mid-1955.
On September 1, 1955, the route was extended west of Timmins to Warren Lake.
West of Warren Lake, Highway 616 and Highway 624 continued to the CNR stop in Foleyet; these would soon become part of Highway 101.
Highway 101 was opened to the Quebec border in December 1958 with the completion of the final gap. In addition, work began on December 18 to clear the route of the Foleyet to Chapleau Resource Road.
On April 1, 1960, Highway 616 and Highway 624 were renumbered as part of Highway 101,
making the highway long; it now connected Foleyet to the Quebec border.
In 1963, several new sections of Highway 101 were opened. On May 16, the majority of the new Chapleau–Foleyet road was designated as Highway 101, with the exception of a bypass of Foleyet and the old route of Highway 624 that opened on December 19.
In addition, a new road west of Chapleau was assumed in December, terminating at the Grazing River near the present entrance to The Shoals Provincial Park.

Work also progressed from the west, near Wawa. Prior to the opening of Highway 17 and Highway 101, a road connected the port at Michipicoten with Wawa. Highway 101 follows a portion of this route, but south of the Highway 17 junction the old road is now known as Pinewood Drive. In October 1965, a road was designated as Highway 101, travelling as far east as the Michipicoten River, The final section, a gap between the Michipicoten River bridge and the Grazing River, opened to traffic on January 1, 1967, completing the link between Wawa and Timmins.

A segment of Highway 101 was transferred to the City of Timmins on April 1, 1997 as part of a province-wide downloading program.
This portion is now locally maintained and is known as Riverside Drive in the Mountjoy area, Algonquin Boulevard downtown, Schumacher Drive in Schumacher, Harold Avenue in South Porcupine and King Street in Porcupine. The discontinuous section begins east of Kamiskotia Road near Mountjoy and continues to Gervais Street North in Porcupine, encompassing a majority of the portion within urban Timmins.

<text>The formal definition of large-calibre artillery used by the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms (UNROCA) is &quot;guns, howitzers, artillery pieces, combining the characteristics of a gun, howitzer, mortar, or rocket, capable of engaging surface targets by delivering primarily indirect fire, with a calibre of and above&quot;. This definition, shared by the Arms Trade Treaty and the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, is updated from an earlier definition in United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/36L, which set a threshold of . Several grammatical changes were made to that latter in 1992 and the threshold was lowered in 2003 to yield the current definition, as endorsed by UN General Assembly Resolution 58/54.

Historically, large-calibre weapons have included bombards and siege guns.

== Late Middle Ages ==

In the context of late medieval siege warfare the term superguns applies to stone-firing bombards with a ball diameter of more than . These superguns were either manufactured by forging together longitudinal iron bars, held in place by iron rings, or cast in bronze with techniques generally similar to bell-founding. Known examples include the Pumhart von Steyr, Dulle Griet and Mons Meg (all iron) as well as the cast-bronze Faule Mette, Faule Grete and Dardanelles Gun.

At the beginning of the development of superguns was the desire to increase the effect of the projectiles. To this end, master gunners first simply used larger powder loads. These, however, exerted larger pressure on the existing cannon and could make it burst, causing the death of the irreplaceable gunner with his crew (and even kings). In addition, it was observed that, due to their higher velocity, stone balls were shattered by the impact on the walls rather than smashing them. Thus, the mass of the cannon balls and, consequently, of the ordnance too continually increased, finally culminating in giant cannon like the Pumhart von Steyr which fired a ball. Apart from the anticipated improvement in penetrating power, other factors such as prestige and a potential deterrent effect also played an important role.

For all their manufacturing quality the superguns were only moderately successful. Their military effectiveness turned out to be out of all proportion to their overwhelming logistical demands and financial costs. For the cost of a single supergun, two or three large bombards with a reasonably smaller caliber (in German &quot;Hauptbüchse&quot;) could be produced whose firepower was enough to shatter any medieval wall, in particular when it was concentrated in a battery. Due to their less bulky dimensions and higher rate of fire, these artillery pieces could be more flexibly deployed and caused more destruction in any given length of time. Furthermore, the transition from stone to smaller, but much more devastating iron balls meant that super-sized bores became unnecessary. The caliber of a ball, for example, could be reduced from when using an iron projectile instead.

Thus, as early as the second half of the 15th century, further development in siege technology concentrated on the &quot;Hauptbüchse&quot;, and bombards largely disappeared from the leading artillery arsenal of the dukes of Burgundy.

At about the same time super-sized bombards were phased out in Western Europe, the technology was transmitted to the Ottoman army by one Orban, a Hungarian gunfounder, on the occasion of the Siege of Constantinople in 1453. The extant Dardanelles Gun, cast by the Ottoman gunfounder Ali several years later, is assumed to have followed closely the outline of Orban&#x27;s guns. A similar super-sized bombard was employed by the Ottoman navy aboard a carrack of possibly Venetian design at the Battle of Zonchio in 1499.

In India, a large forge-welded iron cannon was built during the reign of Raghunatha Nayak (1600–1645), and was then one of the largest cannons in the world. Artillery was used by Indian armies predominantly for defending against besieging armies.

== Modern weapons ==


With the new metallurgical methods and precision engineering of the Industrial Revolution, a revolution in armaments, including artillery took place. In the 1860s, the industrialist Sir William Armstrong, who had already built one of the first breech-loading rifled artillery pieces, constructed a 600-pounder &#x27;monster gun&#x27; of then extraordinary size at the Elswick Ordnance Company in Newcastle. The gun was a rifled muzzle-loader of that fired shells of up to 600 pounds (270 kg) and could pierce 4.5 inches (11.4 cm) of iron armour. Armstrong identified them as &quot;shunt&quot; guns, but they were soon popularly known as &quot;monster&quot; guns.

By the 1880s he had built guns of over 40 feet (12 m) in length that could fire 1,800 pound (810 kg) shells and punch through an incredible 30 inches (76 cm) of iron at a range of . The gun was exhibited at the Royal Mining Engineering Jubilee Exhibition held at Newcastle in 1887 for Queen Victoria&#x27;s golden jubilee.

Prior to World War I, the German military was especially interested in the development of superweapons due to the need for the Schlieffen plan to march past a line of Belgian fortifications constructed specifically to stop such an invasion route. During the opening phases of the war, the Germans employed a Krupp howitzer (the Big Bertha) and two Skoda Mörser M. 11 mortars to reduce the famous fortresses of Liège and Namur. Their low overland mobility made them arrive later than the infantry at Liège, so several infantry assaults were made with heavy loss of life and generally little success. The guns arrived a few days later and reduced the forts at Liège one-by-one over a short period of a few days.

Larger artillery after this opening period was generally limited to railway guns, which had much greater mobility, or naval monitors (two of the British Lord Clive class monitors were fitted with an 18-inch (457 mm) gun, and HMS General Wolfe fired at a railway bridge in Belgium). All of the major powers involved employed such weapons in limited numbers, typically between 280 and 305 mm (11 to 12 inches) although some larger weapons were also used.

The longest-ranged and longest-barreled of the heavy guns deployed in World War I was the Paris Gun, which was used to bombard Paris from a distance of over . The gun had a bore diameter of and a barrel length of . It was fired from concealed fixed positions in the forest of Coucy.

The British attempted to develop weapons to counter the Paris Gun, but none was ready for testing until after the Armistice. A gun under development by Vickers for a class of never-built Russian battleships was converted and lined down to , with the designation &quot;8-inch sub-calibre Mark I&quot;. The barrel was 120 calibres long. Testing commenced in February 1919, but after only six rounds were fired a crack was discovered, and the gun was scrapped in 1928. A weapon of similar concept, the &quot;8-inch sub-calibre Mark II&quot;, was converted from a 12-inch gun (either Mark XI, XI*, or XII), producing a /75 calibre weapon. However, with the war ending before the gun was ready, this weapon was soon scrapped.

Development continued during the inter-war era, although at a more limited pace as aircraft were expected to take over in the long-range bombardment role. Nevertheless, the Germans built a handful of powerful Krupp K5s and the largest artillery pieces (by caliber) ever used in combat: the 800 mm (31.5 in.) Schwerer Gustav and Dora. The latter had been designed specifically to defeat the Maginot Line, firing a shell to a range of . Although their original role proved unnecessary, Gustav was used successfully to destroy Soviet heavy fortifications, most notably those at Sevastopol. Dora was readied for combat at Stalingrad, but was withdrawn before it could be used. Development might have continued but for the ever-increasing Allied air power, which limited Hitler&#x27;s options in terms of re-opening bombing attacks on London. This led to the development of the V-3 &quot;London Gun&quot; or &quot;Hochdruckpumpe&quot;, fired from Mimoyecques in the Pas de Calais, about away. Two attempts to build underground bunkers for the huge weapons were thwarted by massive Royal Air Force bombing raids, which made further attempts futile. Two smaller prototype versions of the gun were used during the Battle of the Bulge.

During World War II, the British developed an experimental 13.5/8 inch hypervelocity gun named Bruce, which was deployed near St Margaret&#x27;s in Kent among their cross-Channel guns. It was intended only for stratospheric experiments, primarily with smoke shells. These experiments were important in the development of the Grand Slam bomb. It was used from March 1943 through February 1945.

==The &quot;Supergun Affair&quot;==
Canadian engineer Gerald Bull became interested in the possibility of using &#x27;superguns&#x27; in place of rockets to insert payloads into orbit. He lobbied for the start of Project HARP to investigate this concept in the 1960s, using paired ex-US Navy 16&quot;/50 caliber Mark 7 gun barrels welded end-to-end. Three of these 16&quot;/50 (406 mm) guns were emplaced, one in Quebec, Canada, another in Barbados, and the third near Yuma, Arizona. HARP was later cancelled, and Bull turned to military designs, eventually developing the GC-45 howitzer. Some years later, Bull interested Saddam Hussein in funding Project Babylon. The objective of this project is not certain, but one possibility is that it was intended to develop a gun capable of firing an object into orbit, whence it could then drop onto any place on the Earth. Gerald Bull was assassinated in March 1990, terminating development, and the parts were confiscated by British customs after the Gulf War.

It has been suggested that the US Navy had developed a supergun (actually a prototype railgun, known as the Electro-Magnetic Laboratory Rail Gun), capable of shooting shells at 5,600 mph (9,012 km/h) or Mach 7 (seven times the speed of sound).

<text>USS &quot;Algonquin, completed as El Toro in 1891 for the [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company#Morgan Line and the Sunset—Gulf Route|Southern Pacific Railroad&#x27;s Morgan Line]], was a small [[tugboat|harbor tug]] commissioned by the [[United States Navy]] 2 April 1898. Renamed Accomac, after [[Accomac, Virginia]], June 1898, renamed Nottoway in 1918 and, after the Navy adopted alphanumeric hull numbers on 17 July 1920, classified as YT-18, a district tug. On 5 October 1942 the name was cancelled and the tug was simply YT-18 until 1944 when classification was changed to YTL-18&quot;, a little harbor tug. Over the years as a Navy tug, from 1898 to 1946, the tug served from Cuba to Boston.

==Construction==
The steam tug &quot;El Toro&quot; was built at Newport News, Virginia by Newport News Shipbuilding for the Southern Pacific Railroad Company owned Morgan Line with delivery 20 May 1891. The tug was designed by naval architect Horace See with a quadruple expansion steam engine, then an unusual feature. &quot;El Toro&quot; was built principally as a fire boat with towing capability to tow the Morgan Line ships arriving or departing New York between the passenger terminal at North River Pier 37 and the cargo terminal at Pier 25. &quot;El Toro&quot; was the second ship, hull number 2, constructed by the then small shipyard, and its success led to building the line&#x27;s cargo and passenger ships &quot;El Sud&quot; (hull #3), &quot;El Norte&quot; (#4), and &quot;El Rio&quot; (#5) and &quot;El Cid&quot; (#6) as its next four ships.

The See designed quadruple expansion steam engine had cylinders of , , and with stroke connected to two opposed cranks each driven by two cylinders arranged in tandem and driving a propeller. Steam at pressure was provided by a two furnace steel return tube type boiler in diameter by in length. Two Worthington fire and bilge pumps provided water for fire fighting or bilge pumping.

A summary of the previous year written in 1895 gives a picture of the tug&#x27;s duties:

*Steamships towed from Company&#x27;s piers to Erie Basin, or distance equal thereto: 70
*Steamships towed from piers Nos. 37 to 25: 132
*Steamships docked at piers Nos. 37 and 25: 152
*Lighters towed and moored: 520
*Miles run without tow: 5342
*On fire duty: Remaining time
*Days in commission: 351
*Coal consumed per day&quot; 1 1/6 tons.

&quot;El Toro&quot; was the flagship of the New York Naval Reserve and in 1891 the new tug is noted as taking the commander to the exercise while flying the new flag of the Naval Reserve.

==Navy purchase and service==
Due to the impending war with Spain &quot;El Toro&quot; was purchased by the Navy on 26 March 1898 and commissioned on 2 April 1898 with the name USS &quot;Algonquin&quot;, Ensign Walter S. Crosley in command.

Ensign Crosley described his reporting to the New York Navy Yard on 1 April 1898 with orders to report as a watch standing officer aboard and, upon being redirected to &quot;fit out and command&quot; &quot;Algonquin&quot; to be ready for sea immediately only to find the old Morgan tug as an &quot;April Fool&#x27;s joke.&quot; Crosley found there was no crew and that fitting out meant acquiring nearly everything from hawsers to stores, which he had to load aboard himself from a commandeered horse cart. With six men sent from on 2 April the tug was put into commission at two p.m. with final crew, including a sixty-one-year-old that had not been to sea in twenty-five years reporting to assist the captain in getting to Key West, Florida, still assembling on the evening of 3 April.

&quot;Algonquin&quot; departed the Navy Yard on the afternoon of 4 April for Key West, Florida with a quickly assembled crew, only two of which had been in the Navy and only four had been to sea, in company with the tug commanded by Lieutenant York Noble. &quot;Nezinscot&quot; turned back while still in Buttermilk Channel with &quot;Algonquin&quot; continuing alone, reaching Scotland Lightship at about eight in the evening, until suffering weather damage to a hatch cover and having to seek shelter behind the Delaware Breakwater for pumping out. After a delay of nearly a day the tug got underway for Port Royal, South Carolina where &quot;Nezinscot&quot; caught up and, on meeting more poor weather on the way south, took the smaller and slower &quot;Algonquin&quot; in tow until breaking down and then being towed by &quot;Algonquin&quot; until reaching the fleet at Key West on 13 April.

Once with the fleet the tug made regular trips to Cuba towing captured vessels to Key West and making logistics runs that included dispatches and even laundry, the loss of which in an involved the tug almost sinking when seas swept over the ship taking boxes and the laundry from lashings on top of the deck house. The tug had left Key West overloaded and nearly sank off Cuba, being taken in tow by with all hands aboard the tug bailing as the pumps would not work. After arrival at Key West the fleet&#x27;s commander-in-chief declared &quot;Algonquin&quot; unfit for such service whereupon Ensign Crosley was offered and took command of .

On 15 June 1898, &quot;Algonquin&quot; was renamed &quot;Accomac&quot;. The vessel served at Key West through end of the year. In January 1899, she was reassigned to the Cuban occupation forces and was based at Havana, Cuba. Between late 1900 and December 1911, the small ship successively served as a yard tug at Port Royal, South Carolina, Key West, and Pensacola, Florida. On 14 February 1907 she sank the steamer in a collision off the Palafox Street Wharf, Pensacola, Florida. On 4 December 1911, &quot;Accomac&quot; arrived at the Boston Navy Yard where she spent the remainder of her active career. She was renamed &quot;Nottoway&quot; on 1 August 1918.

On 17 July 1920 the Navy adopted the alphanumeric system of hull designations with &quot;Nottoway&quot; being designated YT-18. On 5 October 1942, her name was cancelled, and she became simply &quot;YT-18&quot;. On 15 May 1944, the tug was redesignated a small harbor tug, &quot;YTL-18&quot;. She served at Boston as a yard tug through the end of World War II.

&quot;YTL-18&quot; was placed out of service at Boston on 3 April 1946, and her name was struck from the Navy List on 17 April 1946. On 15 October 1946, she was sold to Mr. Arthur M. Hall, of Boston, Massachusetts, presumably for scrapping.

<text>USS &quot;Accomac&quot; (LST-710/APB-49) was a , the second ship in the service of the United States Navy named after Accomac, Virginia.

She was laid down as the unnamed LST-710 on 13 May 1944 at Jeffersonville, Indiana by Jeffersonville Boat &amp; Machine, launched on 28 June 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Maude B. Schricker, and commissioned on 24 July 1944.

==Service history==
&quot;LST-710&quot; served in the Asiatic-Pacific theater during World War II and participated in the invasion of Luzon carried out at Lingayen Gulf in January 1945. By the following summer, she had returned to the United States at San Diego where she began conversion to a self-propelled barracks ship. On 1 August 1945, she was named Accomac and was redesignated APB-49.

&quot;Accomac&quot; continued conversion work and remained at San Diego until 8 September when she got underway for Adak, Alaska. The barracks ship arrived at her destination on 21 September and began taking on cargo and mail. She stood out of Adak two days later and shaped a course for Japan. On 3 October, she anchored in Ominato Ko, Japan. Two weeks later, she moved to Aomori Wan where she remained for over a month. On 21 November, the ship left Aomori Wan for Yokosuka, arriving there on 25 November. She ended the old year, 1945, at Yokosuka. On 14 February 1946, &quot;Accomac&quot; weighed anchor and set course for Sasebo where she arrived four days later. The ship remained there until 3 March at which time she got underway for the United States. After 27 days at sea, the barracks ship reentered San Diego on 30 March. She remained there until decommissioned on 9 August 1946.

She was berthed with the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Diego for over 12 years. Though no date for her strike from the Navy list has been found, this probably occurred late in 1959. On 7 December 1959, she was sold to the Union Minerals &amp; Alloys Corp., of New York City, for scrapping.

&quot;Accomac&quot; earned one battle star for her World War II service as &quot;LST-710&quot;.

<text>The Brown Debating Union (BDU) is a student-run debating organization at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, United States. The team competes in American Parliamentary Debate and British Parliamentary Debate. Currently the team is ranked 2nd in North America.

== History ==

The Brown Debating Union has existed since 1824. It began to organize formal debate tournaments with peer institutions, as well as on-campus debates for student groups, during the early twentieth century. By the 1950s, the debate program had become part of the Brown University English Department. Competing on the National Debate Tournament circuit, the debate team was fairly successful. 

However, in the 1980s the English department stopped funding the team, and the BDU became an autonomous student organization funded by the Undergraduate Finance Board. Without the funds to participate in costly policy debate, they participated in parliamentary debate. The Union currently competes in debate tournaments held by the American Parliamentary Debate Association. Their annual debate tournament is typically held during the last weekend of October every year.

Since 1882, the BDU has held the Radcliffe Hicks Debate, an annual contest for sophomores and juniors. First and second-place winners receive monetary prizes from the Hicks endowment.

==Structure==

The Brown Debating Union is run by a board of students elected every winter. The board is responsible for organizational decisions including handling finances, running tournaments and training students. The board consists of eight members: the president, vp of operations, vp of finance, vp of administration, vp of recruitment, logistics chair, social chair and communications chair. 

==National competition==

The Brown Debating Union competes mostly in the American Parliamentary style of debate as a member of the American Parliamentary Debate Association, an intercollegiate debate association with over fifty member universities across the United States. The BDU competes at tournaments across the country that take place on Fridays and Saturdays each week. It also hosts its own parliamentary debate tournament twice a year, and has been involved in APDA governance, with BDU members serving on APDA&#x27;s executive board.

==International competition==
The Brown Debating Union also competes internationally, notably at the North American Debating Championship, the World Universities Debating Championship, as well as Inter-Varsity tournaments at Oxford, Cambridge, and Hart House. BDU debaters won the inaugural North American Women&#x27;s Debating Championship in 2015 and were semifinalists at the 2014 North American Universities Debating Championship.

<text>The Annie E. Casey Foundation (AECF) is a charitable foundation focused on improving the well-being of American children and youth.

The AECF is one of the dominant organizations in child welfare and juvenile justice in the U.S., and one of the most influential &quot;watchdogs&quot; for child well-being, as they collect and publish most of the data on children in poverty in the U.S. annually, through its &quot;Kids Count Data Book.&quot;

==History==
The AECF was started in 1948 in Seattle by UPS founder James E. Casey and his siblings George, Harry and Marguerite. Their foundation was named in honor of their mother. The foundation moved to Baltimore in 1994.

Originally a charity, chiefly focused on providing foster care, the organization gradually shifted to a broader role in attempting to advance child well-being through social experimentation, research and publicity. Along the way, it divested its direct services foster care operation, while increasing its focus on family-strengthening (a model that was proposed by the AECF) economic stability, community change research, advocacy and action.

Through its extensive publicity efforts, the AECF has become a major source of information on the welfare of children in the United States,

==Casey Family Services==
From 1976 to 2012, the AECF operated Casey Family Services, a direct services organization that provided foster care and family services in the northeastern United States. Starting out in Connecticut and Vermont, the program expanded throughout New England and into Maryland before its closure in 2012.

==Child well-being publicity and publications==
Among the organization&#x27;s practices is the development of &quot;public accountability&quot; for child welfare outcomes—through continuing publication, and publicizing, of research and comparative data that assess the health and wellness of children in the various states and communities across the nation. In addition to reports, AECF operates the KIDS COUNT Data Center, which features national, state, and local data on the well-being of kids and families in the U.S.

In keeping with this goal, the foundation is a regular contributor to public broadcasting, including National Public Radio.

In another key form of &quot;public accountability&quot;, the foundation develops several written publications reporting the current status of children across the nation, state-by-state.

In particular, the foundation produces a detailed, annual child-welfare research report,
the &quot;KIDS COUNT Data Book&quot; (also known as the &quot;Kids Count&quot; or simply the &quot;Data Book&quot;), surveying the well-being of children in the 50 US states, ranking the states on 10 core indicators, and overall—drawing heavily on documented sources and official reports. This reference book, printed every year since 1990, is considered one of the foremost reference documents—for academics, media, business and public leaders—on child health and well-being in the United States, and particularly in each of the 50 states, comparatively.

In 2014, the organization also released its &quot;Race for Results Index&quot;, comparing the previous 23 years of data accumulated on the well-being of America&#x27;s children—intending to start a national conversation about startling disparities between racial and ethnic groups. For the first time, this index was based on indicators of success: reading and math proficiency, high school graduation rates, teen birthrates, employment futures, neighborhood poverty levels, family income and education levels. Standardized scores, indicating the children&#x27;s likelihood of success in adult life, were presented for each state and racial group (where valid data was available) using data gathered between 2010 and 2013.

The foundation also sponsors (or produces), and distributes, research reports and white papers on various topics involving child welfare and related programs and public policy issues.

==Child welfare development grants==

The foundation works with—and makes grants to—governments (particularly states), universities and civic organizations, to improve conditions for children.

AECF describes the grantees as the &quot;KIDS COUNT Network&quot; and uses them as outlets for its outreach communications and influence efforts, although it accepts that their individual priorities and goals may vary somewhat from AECF&#x27;s.

==Juvenile justice alternatives==
The Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative (JDAI), a project developed in 1992 by the AECF, demonstrates ways for jurisdictions to safely reduce reliance on secure confinement of children, and strengthen juvenile justice systems through interrelated reform strategies. The JDAI reports that it is now being copied in approximately &quot;200 jurisdictions in 39 states and the District of Columbia&quot;. The U.S. Department of Justice Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) has worked directly and extensively with the AECF on these issues, as well.

The JDAI Helpdesk used to be an online information tool for juvenile justice advocates, practitioners, policymakers, and other parties seeking to improve juvenile justice systems, sharing the juvenile justice &quot;best practices&quot;, research and materials produced by JDAI jurisdictions. Featured materials included strategies and tools documented to safely reduce secure confinements, while improving public safety, avoiding costs and doing &quot;what works for youth&quot; to develop them into &quot;healthy, productive adults&quot;.

The JDAI Helpdesk was operated—in partnership with the AECF—by the Pretrial Justice Institute.

One prominent success story is the Bon Air Juvenile Correctional Center near Richmond, Virginia. AECF provided technical expertise to assist the Virginia Department of Juvenile Justice in significantly reducing juvenile prison populations.

== Thrive by 25 ==
In 2021, the AECF announced an initiative called Thrive by 25, which is meant to increase its focus on improving the lives of youth and young adults. Over 10 years, the organization will dedicate at least 50 percent of its philanthropic investments to ensure that young people between the ages 14 and 24 have the family connections, relationships, communities, and educational and employment opportunities they need to succeed.

<doc id="771413" wikidata="Q259594" url="?curid=771413" title="Lyubov Popova">
<text>Lyubov Sergeyevna Popova (; April 24, 1889 – May 25, 1924) was a Russian-Soviet avant-garde artist, painter and designer.

== Early life ==
Popova was born in Ivanovskoe, near Moscow, to the wealthy family of Sergei Maximovich Popov, a very successful textile merchant and vigorous patron of the arts, and Lyubov Vasilievna Zubova, who came from a highly cultured family. Lyubov Sergeyevna had two brothers and a sister: Sergei was the eldest, then Lyubov, Pavel and Olga. Pavel became a philosopher and the guardian of his sister&#x27;s artistic legacy.

Popova grew up with a strong interest in art, especially Italian Renaissance painting. At eleven years old she began formal art lessons at home; she was first enrolled in Yaltinskaia&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Gymnasium, then in Arseneva&#x27;s Gymnasium in Moscow. By the age of 18 she was studying with Stanislav Zhukovsky, and in 1908 entered the private studios of Konstantin Yuon and Ivan Dudin. In 1912 to 1913, she began attending the studios of the Cubist painters Henri Le Fauconnier and Jean Metzinger at Académie de La Palette in Paris.

== Career ==

=== Travels ===
Popova traveled widely to investigate and learn from diverse styles of painting, but it was the ancient Russian icons, the paintings of Giotto, and the works of the 15th- and 16th-century Italian painters which interested her the most.

In 1909 she traveled to Kiev, then in 1910 to Pskov and Novgorod. The following year she visited other ancient Russian cities, including St. Petersburg, to study icons. In 1912 she worked in a Moscow studio known as &quot;The Tower&quot; with Ivan Aksenov and Vladimir Tatlin, and also visited Sergei Shchukin&#x27;s collection of modern French paintings.

In 1912–1913 she studied art with Nadezhda Udaltsova in Paris, where she met Alexander Archipenko and Ossip Zadkine in 1913. After returning to Russia that same year, she worked with Tatlin, Udaltsova and the Vesnin brothers.

In 1914 she traveled in France and Italy at the development of Cubism and Futurism.

== Style ==

=== Cubo-Futurism ===
Popova was one of the first female pioneers in Cubo-Futurism. Through a synthesis of styles she worked towards what she termed &quot;painterly architectonics&quot;. After first exploring Impressionism, by 1913, in &quot;Composition with Figures&quot;, she was experimenting with the particularly Russian development of Cubo-Futurism: a fusion of two equal influences from France and Italy.

From 1914 to 1915 her Moscow home became the meeting-place for artists and writers. In 1914–1916 Popova together with other avant-garde artists (Aleksandra Ekster, Nadezhda Udaltsova, Olga Rozanova) contributed to the two &quot;Knave of Diamonds&quot; exhibitions, in Petrograd &quot; Tramway V&quot; and the &quot;0.10&quot;, &quot;The Store&quot; in Moscow. An analysis of Popova&#x27;s cubo-futurist work also suggests an affinity with the work of Fernand Leger, whose geometry of tubular and conical forms in his series of paintings from 1913 to 1914 is similar to that in Popova&#x27;s paintings.

=== Suprematism ===
Her painting &quot;The Violin&quot; of 1914 suggests the development from Cubism towards the &quot;painterly architectonics&quot; series of 1916–1918. This series defined her distinct artistic trajectory in abstract form. The canvas surface is an energy field of overlapping and intersecting angular planes in a constant state of potential release of energy. At the same time the elements are held in a balanced and proportioned whole as if linking the compositions of the classical past to the future. Color is used as the iconic focus; the strong primary color at the center drawing the outer shapes together.
In 1916 she joined the &quot;Supremus&quot; group with Kazimir Malevich, the founder of Suprematism, Aleksandra Ekster, Ivan Kliun, Nadezhda Udaltsova, Olga Rozanova, Ivan Puni, Nina Genke, Ksenia Boguslavskaya and others who at this time worked in Verbovka Village Folk Centre. The creation of a new kind of painting was part of the revolutionary urge of the Russian avant-garde to remake the world. The term &#x27;supreme&#x27; refers to a &#x27;non-objective&#x27; or abstract world beyond that of everyday reality.
However, there was a tension between those who, like Malevich, saw art as a spiritual quest, and others who responded to the need for the artist to create a new physical world. Popova embraced both of these ideals but eventually identified herself entirely with the aims of the Revolution working in poster, book design, fabric and theatre design, as well as teaching. At &quot;0.10&quot; she had exhibited a number of figurative painted cardboard reliefs in a cubist derived style. In 1916 she began to paint completely abstract Suprematist compositions, but the title &quot;Painterly Architectonics&quot; (which she gave to many of her paintings) suggests that, even as a Suprematist, Popova was more interested in painting as a projection of material reality than as the personal expression of a metaphysical reality. Popova&#x27;s superimposed planes and strong color have the objective presence of actual space and materials.

In 1918 Popova married the art historian Boris von Eding, and gave birth to a son. Von Eding died the following year of typhoid fever. Popova was also seriously ill but recovered.

=== Constructivism ===
As early as 1917, in parallel with her Suprematist work, the artist had made fabric designs and worked on &quot;Agitprop&quot; books and posters, In the &quot;Tenth State Exhibition: Non Objective Creativity and Suprematism&quot;, 1918, she contributed the architectonic series of paintings. She continued painting advanced abstract works until 1921. In the 5x5=25 Exhibition of 1921, Popova and her four fellow Constructivists declared that easel painting was to be abandoned and all creative work was to be for the people and the making of the new society. Popova worked in a broad range of mediums and disciplines, including painting, relief, works on paper, and designs for the theater, textiles, and typography. Popova did not join the Working Group of Constructivists when it was set up in Moscow in March 1921, but joined by the end of 1921. In 1923 she began creating designs for fabric to be manufactured by the First State Textile Printing Works in Moscow.

From 1921 to 1924 Popova became entirely involved in Constructivist projects, sometimes in collaboration with Varvara Stepanova, the architect Alexander Vesnin and Alexander Rodchenko. She produced stage designs: Vsevolod Meyerhold&#x27;s production of Fernand Crommelynck&#x27;s &quot;The Magnanimous Cuckold&quot;, 1922; her &quot;Spatial Force Constructions&quot; were used as the basis of her art teaching theory at Vkhutemas. She designed typography of books, production art and textiles, and contributed designs for dresses to LEF.

She worked briefly in the Cotton Printing Factory in Moscow with Varvara Stepanova.

== Death and legacy ==
Popova died at the peak of her artistic powers two days after the death of her son, from whom she had contracted scarlet fever in 1924 in Moscow. A large exhibition of her work opened in Moscow from December 21, 1924, to January 1925, at Stroganov Institute, Moscow. The exhibition included Popova&#x27;s works such as seventy-seven paintings, as well as books, posters, textile designs, and line engravings. &quot;Artist-Constructor&quot; was the term applied to Popova by her contemporaries in the catalogue of the artist&#x27;s posthumous exhibition.

&quot;Rodchenko/Popova: Defining Constructivism&quot;, an exhibition of the work of Popova, Rodchenko, and other Constructivists was shown at Tate Modern, London, in 2009, and subsequently at Museo Reina Sofia, Madrid.

Popova&#x27;s work was included in the 2021 exhibition &quot;Women in Abstraction&quot; at the Centre Pompidou.

<doc id="771415" wikidata="Q16962063" url="?curid=771415" title="Article 4 direction">
<text>An Article 4 direction is made by a local planning authority in the United Kingdom and exceptionally may be subject to intervention by the government. It serves to restrict permitted development rights, which means that a lot of the things people do to their land or houses without planning permission and often take for granted, are brought into the realms of planning consent. It does not in itself prohibit any action but means that a landowner is required to seek planning consent whereas without the direction this would not be necessary.

An Article 4 direction is not a conservation designation as such. It is a statement made under the Town and Country Planning Acts, specifically the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995. The direction removes all or some of the permitted development rights on a site. For example, it could stop a landowner from holding car boot sales on their land for 14 days per year—a right which they would otherwise have—or could restrict a householder from converting a property into multiple flats.

There are certain permitted development rights that cannot be withdrawn by an Article 4 direction. These exemptions are to ensure permitted development rights related to national concerns, safety, or maintenance work for existing facilities cannot be withdrawn.

Article 4 directions were in the past a rarely used instrument which was not particularly effective, and was difficult to apply as it always required the approval of the Secretary of State. The 1995 Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order made significant improvements to the process, and since that time the use of Article 4 directions has increased.

==Types of Article 4 direction==
Since 1995 there have been three types of direction:
*directions under article 4(2) affecting conservation areas. The aim of an Article 4(2) Direction is to encourage the retention of high-quality architectural features and to preserve and enhance the character and appearance of the built heritage. The designation of a Conservation Area only goes some way towards protecting the integrity of buildings and their character. Under the Town and Country Planning Act (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, permitted development rights enable property owners within a conservation area to undertake small-scale extensions and/or alterations without the need for planning permission. Where these rights are unchecked, they can erode the special interest of the conservation area. 
*directions under article 4(1) affecting only listed buildings; and
*directions under article 4(1) affecting other land.

==Powers to make a direction==
A direction under either article 4(1) or 4(2) of the 1995 order may be made by the district or county planning authority in relation to a conservation area, but only by the district/borough council in other cases. The Secretary of State may also make a direction.

<doc id="771418" wikidata="Q2881381" url="?curid=771418" title="Balloon Kid">
<text>Balloon Kid is a platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy. It was released in October 1990 in North America and in January 1991 in Europe. It is the sequel to &quot;Balloon Fight&quot;. It was never released in Japan for the original Game Boy, but two years after its original release, a licensed Family Computer port titled was reprogrammed and released by Sanrio&#x27;s subsidiary Character Soft exclusively in Japan on March 27, 1992. A Game Boy Color edition with a few new features titled was released in Japan on July 31, 2000.

==Gameplay==

In 1-player mode, the gameplay is an arrangement of the &quot;Balloon Trip&quot; mode of &quot;Balloon Fight&quot;, where the screen automatically scrolls toward the left, while the player controls Alice who uses two balloons to float into the air with. To make her float in the air, the player must press (and sometimes hold) the A button to make her wave her arms to hover upward. Alice also has the ability to remove her balloons and walk on the ground, as well as jumping. If both of her balloons are popped or removed, and if she lands safely, she can inflate two new balloons and fly again.

The object of this mode is to travel from the beginning to the end while collecting balloons left by Alice&#x27;s brother, Jim, along the way. The player must also prevent Alice from bumping into enemies that are attempting to pop her balloons, push her or kill her altogether. Some enemies, such as Balloon Birds, came from &quot;Balloon Fight&quot;. The giant fish that eats anyone who flies too close to the water also came from &quot;Balloon Fight&quot;. There are four bosses in &quot;Balloon Kid&quot;. To defeat them, the player must make Alice fly about them and make her detach her balloons to bounce on them. She also can jump and stomp on them, whenever it is safe for her, like in other typical platformers.

The 2-player mode is loosely based on &quot;Balloon Fight&quot;″s Game A and Game B modes, where one player battles against another player. One player controls Alice, while the other controls Alice&#x27;s friend and eternal rival: Samm. The goal is to collect more balloons than the other player before they arrive at the end of the stage.

&quot;Balloon Kid&quot;″s &quot;Balloon Trip&quot; mode is based on Balloon Fight&#x27;s mode of the same name, but with Alice instead of a Balloon Fighter. Everything else, including the BGM itself, are unchanged from &quot;Balloon Fight&quot;″s Balloon Trip mode.

==Plot and setting==
===Setting===
&quot;Balloon Kid&quot; takes place in a small part of an unnamed, Earth-like world. The only city in this part of the world is a town known as Pencilvania, a little town with pencil-shaped skyscrapers. Other places in this part of the world are these unnamed locations in order of appearance: a forest, an ocean with a giant whale, an icy mountain, and an industrial building. The first place a player starts from is a small house in a rural part of Pencilvania. There lived a brother and sister who loved to play with balloons. Alice and her younger brother, Jim, would spend endless days filling the skies with their balloons.

One day, Jim filled all his balloons and tied them together to make a beautiful balloon rainbow across the sky. Alice said: &quot;What a great idea this was, Jim, but please be careful!&quot;. Just then, a strong wind blew and Jim was carried away into the sky. &quot;Oh, no! This is terrible, I must save Jim!&quot;, thought Alice. Meanwhile, Jim, who was a very clever boy, thought, &quot;I wonder how Alice will find me...Wait! I&#x27;ve got an idea. I&#x27;ll leave a trail of balloons for Alice to follow!&quot;.

===Characters===
* Alice - the protagonist of &quot;Balloon Kid&quot;, she must save her brother Jim from tragedy. Player 1 controls her in all three modes.
* Jim - Alice&#x27;s mischievous younger brother who accidentally flew away in a bunch of balloons while he was making a balloon rainbow across the sky.
* Samm - Alice&#x27;s frenemy. Player 2 controls him in 2-Player mode.

==Ports and related releases==

On March 27, 1992, a subsidiary of Hello Kitty creator Sanrio, known as Character Soft, reprogrammed and published a Family Computer version of &quot;Balloon Kid&quot;, titled as . This version was released in Japan, where &quot;Balloon Kid&quot; was not. &quot;Balloon Kid&quot; was created after it was brought to North America. The notable changes to the game were &quot;Balloon Kid&quot;″s plot being replaced with Hello Kitty&#x27;s, as well as updated/changed visuals.

On July 31, 2000, &quot;Balloon Kid&quot; was remade and renamed as , and was also developed by Pax Softnica and published by Nintendo, but released in Japan for the Game Boy Color through the Nintendo Power flash RAM cartridge series. This version features colored graphics, battery-backed memory for helping players save their progress in order to pick any stage of their choice after they completed them. Super Game Boy compatible features such as frames were added as well. &quot;Balloon Fight GB&quot; was later added to the Virtual Console for the Nintendo 3DS in Japan on October 19, 2011, while &quot;Balloon Kid&quot; was added to the same platform in North America on November 3, and in Europe on January 26, 2012.

Some of the game&#x27;s BGM was added in some parts of the &quot;Game Boy Camera&quot;, such as the &quot;Hot Spot&quot; section.

==Development and reception==
&quot;Balloon Kid&quot; was designed by Yoshio Sakamoto and developed by Nintendo in co-operation with the external company Pax Softnica. It was first published in North America in February, and finally in Europe on September 28. As such, it is one of the few first-party Nintendo games that were not published in Japan, until Nintendo licensed it to Sanrio&#x27;s subsidiary Character Soft for reprogramming and publishing it to the Family Computer as &quot;Hello Kitty World&quot; in Japan on March 27, 1992, while &quot;Balloon Kid&quot; was remade for Game Boy Color and released in Japan on July 31, 2000. According to Hitoshi Yamagami, director of &quot;Balloon Fight GB&quot;, the Game Boy Color version was developed due to demand for a &quot;Balloon Fight&quot; sequel and that the success of &quot;Game Boy Gallery&quot; made them consider making an updated version of &quot;Balloon Kid&quot; for the Japanese market. Both &quot;Balloon Kid&quot; and &quot;Balloon Fight GB&quot; were later re-released in their original regions as part of the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console lineup, but &quot;VS Mode&quot; became incompatible.

&quot;IGN&quot; editor Lucas M. Thomas called the game &quot;a solid little adventure game&quot; that stood out to him because of its improvements over the gameplay of the original Balloon Trip mode of &quot;Balloon Fight&quot;. Although he found it to be &quot;not mind-blowing, but it is fun and adds a bit of tension to things&quot;, he thought that &quot;Balloon Kid&quot; is &quot;a nice little lost sequel from yesteryear that is pleasant to play through again for just three bucks&quot;. &quot;Mean Machines&quot; rated the game 51%, describing it as &quot;full of promise&quot;, then adding that the repetitive gameplay and low difficulty caused the game to become boring. They added that while the premise was interesting, they couldn&#x27;t &quot;help thinking that this is a mediocre game&quot;. Author Jeff Rovin in the book &quot;How to Win at Game Boy Games&quot; noted the gameplay as &quot;novel&quot; if repetitive after the second stage of the game, adding that regardless the game was entertaining for all ages, and &quot;a worthy addition to the Game Boy library&quot;, grading the game B.

<text>Edwin Johannes Hildegard Linkomies (22 December 1894 – 9 September 1963, until 1928 &quot;Edwin Flinck)&quot; was Prime Minister of Finland from March 1943 to August 1944, and one of the seven politicians sentenced to five and a half years in prison as responsible for the Continuation War, on the demand of the Soviet Union. He was paroled in 1948. Linkomies was a prominent fennoman academic, pro-rector (administrative head) of the University of Helsinki 1932 to 1943, rector 1956 to 1962, and the government&#x27;s Chancellor of the University from 1962 until his death.

==Biography==

Linkomies was born as Edwin Flinck in southeastern Finland&#x27;s Viipuri, the son of a Swedish-Finnish officer who died soon after Edwin&#x27;s birth, but Edwin grew up in western Finland at Rauma, in a mostly Finnish-speaking region of Finland. He had a quick and splendid career in academia: He graduated at age nineteen, wrote his dissertation at 22 at the University of Helsinki, where seven years later he was appointed professor and head of the department of Latin literature. Meanwhile, he had continued his research in Germany, at Leipzig and Halle. He would keep in close contact with German universities for the rest of his life; as a teacher and scientific leader he was known for his &quot;Anglo-Saxon style&quot; — clear and simplistic in his presentations, emphasizing the grand lines rather than intriguing details and exceptions — but also as demanding, authoritarian, keen of the dignity of his office, and maybe too self-confident.

Linkomies was in many respects &quot;the last of his kind.&quot; Most of all, he was the last in a long line of prominent Finnish academics who were recruited from academia to important political tasks. But he was also the last to give lectures in formal academic dress, and the last to expect students and university employees to bow deeply for their rector.

Linkomies&#x27;s ideologic development may for later generations seem remarkable, but among his contemporaries it was not unheard of to have been ardently nationalist, anti-Scandinavian, monarchy minded, anti-Socialist, and anti-democrat, only to shred these opinions one after another. His memoirs describes his astonishment over how the Socialist half of Finland&#x27;s population turned out to be equally patriotic defenders as the non-Socialists after the Soviet Union&#x27;s attack in November 1939. According to his own account, he was also one of the first Finns to realize the troubling nature of the Nazis — at least among his fellow Conservatives.

During the interbellum, much of Linkomies&#x27;s rhetoric and political energy was directed against the Swedish-speaking Finns, and the remnants of their privileges and dominance in Finnish society; but also against Sweden and Scandinavia, which he perceived as both too Socialist and too eager to dominate Finland. However, in the 1950s, &quot;after&quot; the disappointment over Sweden&#x27;s limited support during the wars, he contributed energetically to inter-Nordic contacts and cultural exchange, and may be credited for the at least partial healing of the rupture between Conservatives in Finland and Scandinavia, that had its background in fennomania and the Åland Crisis.

An assessment of Linkomies&#x27;s role as politician is complicated by the fact that he at, in at least two critical moments in Finland&#x27;s history deliberately spoke and acted against his own conviction, if one is allowed to believe his account in his memoirs. 
* In the early 1930s, he argues that his ambition was to steer Finland&#x27;s Conservative party, Kokoomus, in democratic direction after its entanglement with the semi-fascist Lapua Movement. But in order to achieve this, he appeared to conform to the lesser evils of anti-parliamentarism, militant anti-Socialism, and authoritarianism.
* During the Continuation War, after the Wehrmacht’s defeat at Stalingrad, he was appointed prime minister with peace at the top of his agenda, but neither in deeds nor in words would the government led by him and president Ryti reveal this aim, fearing the majority of Finns were unprepared, and the German co-belligerent still too strong. Furthermore, he did not dare to establish contacts with the growing domestic opposition to the war, and only very cautiously and hesitantly with countries that probably would have been inclined to support the peace process, notably the United States, Sweden, and Britain, if they had had confidence in Finland&#x27;s wish for peace.

<text>York Factory was a settlement and Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) factory (trading post) on the southwestern shore of Hudson Bay in northeastern Manitoba, Canada, at the mouth of the Hayes River, approximately south-southeast of Churchill.

York Factory was one of the first fur-trading posts established by the HBC, built in 1684 and used in that business for more than 270 years. The settlement was headquarters of the HBC&#x27;s Northern Department from 1821 to 1873. In 1936, the complex was designated a National Historic Site of Canada.

In 1957, the HBC closed it down. It has been owned by the Canadian government since 1968 and the site is now operated by Parks Canada. No one lives permanently at York Factory; there is a summer residence for Parks Canada staff, and some nearby seasonal hunting camps. The wooden structure at the park site dates from 1831 and is the oldest and largest wooden structure built on permafrost in Canada.

==Location==
York Factory is on the north bank of the Hayes River, about inland. The mouth of the Nelson River is to the north, across &quot;Point of Marsh&quot;. The Hayes is a more practical canoe route, although the Nelson is much larger, with it draining Lake Winnipeg. Seagoing ships anchored at Five Fathom Hole from the fort due to the shallow bottom, and goods were transferred by smaller boats.The Shamattawa Airport and Gillam Airport are nearby today.

== History ==


From the 17th to the late 19th century, the depot at York Factory and its predecessors were the central base of operations for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s (HBC) control of the fur trade and other business dealings with the First Nations throughout Rupert&#x27;s Land, the vast territory comprising the entire watershed of Hudson Bay, and which now forms much of Canada.

The first three HBC posts were established on James Bay about 1670. In 1684, Fort Nelson, a fur trading post at the mouth of the Nelson River and the first headquarters of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, was established at the mouth of the nearby Nelson River. The company built a second fort, York Factory, on the Hayes river, naming it after the Duke of York. The establishment of the forts provoked a response from New France. 

In the Hudson Bay expedition (1686), the French marched overland from Quebec and captured all the posts on James Bay. During King William&#x27;s War, France several times sent a naval force to Hudson Bay to capture or destroy the fort. In 1690, Pierre Le Moyne d&#x27;Iberville tried but was driven away by a larger English ship. In 1694, d&#x27;Iberville returned and captured York Factory with a show of force. He renamed it Fort Bourbon. English forces returned the next year and retook the fort from its small French garrison. 

In 1697, d&#x27;Iberville won the Battle of Hudson&#x27;s Bay, the largest Arctic naval battle in North American history. The French force won in the naval battle with three English warships and again captured York Factory since d&#x27;Iberville had laid siege to the fort in such a way as to give the appearance of having a much stronger force. York Factory was held by the French until 1713, when it was returned to the British in the Treaty of Utrecht. The HBC then again placed its northern headquarters at York Factory, at the mouth of the Hayes River.

From 1788 to 1795, the company constructed a square bastion fort of stone and brick at York Factory. The fort was known as The Octagon” because of the octagonal shape of the area enclosed. The choice of material was poor, however, as the stone and brick could not stand up to heaving permafrost, and in 1831, the stone fort was razed. The three-story center section of the current compound was completed that same year, with the two-story wings finished within the two years that followed.

During its first century, the depot operated by drawing First Nations traders to the post, rather than sending its own traders out into the field. Its position at the mouth of the Nelson allowed access by canoe from the watersheds of the Saskatchewan and Red rivers.

In the late 18th century, the centralized nature of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s operation from the depot began to become a disadvantage against the more nimble &quot;voyageurs&quot; of the North West Company. They operated by travelling among the First Nations on the vast water network of lakes and rivers. In response, the company began sending out its own traders from the depot and eventually established inland posts, first along the Saskatchewan River, and then stretching as far as the Oregon Country. Twice annually from 1821 to 1846, brigades known as the York Factory Express travelled overland to Fort Vancouver headquarters for the HBC&#x27;s Columbia Department, brought supplies and trade goods, and returned with furs destined for London.

By the mid-19th century, York Factory had developed an extensive trading post and settlement with 50 on-site buildings, most of which have been destroyed, and a permanent workforce. It was not a popular location. The chief trader, John McLean, wrote that he &quot;took leave of Fort York, its fogs, and bogs and mosquitoes, with little regret&quot; in 1837. 

The reign of York Factory as one of the most important Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company posts declined in 1860s and 1870s. The transfer of Rupert&#x27;s Land to Canada and the changes in the HBC Northwest transportation network increased the use of the United States railways, steamboats, and Red River carts for Upper Fort Garry&#x27;s southern supply line. In 1890, the depot remained in company hands after the acquisition of Rupert&#x27;s Land by Canada. In 1872, York Factory&#x27;s role diminished to outfitting only to particular posts in Manitoba. In 1873, the post&#x27;s fur trade headquarters title was removed, and certain responsibilities were transferred to Upper Fort Garry, present-day Winnipeg.

The importance of York Factory declined further. From 1874 to 1875, the post virtually stopped receiving supplies and goods to be transported elsewhere. In 1878, the post&#x27;s British products began being relocated to Norway House. In 1911, York Factory had a brief upswing when it was designated the headquarters for the new Nelson River District. In 1929, the Factory lost the title to Churchill, due to the establishment of the railway line that connected Churchill to Winnipeg. From that point forward, York Factory served as a regional trading post.

In 1957, Hudson&#x27;s Bay York Factory closed. The residents were relocated to York Landing Cree Nation, about ENE of Thompson, Manitoba, as well as Split Lake and Shamattawa. In oral stories, Cree elders who once resided at York Factory in the first half of the twentieth century recalled their desires to remain at Kihci-waskahikan or Great House when operations ceased. Kihci-waskahikan and Great House are words for the post used by the Swampy Cree, West Main Cree, Lowland Cree, and/or Home Guard Cree.

The historic site is staffed by Parks Canada from June 1 to mid-September. Archaeological excavations of the 18th-century &quot;octagon&quot; have been conducted since 1991.

<doc id="771436" wikidata="Q1322150" url="?curid=771436" title="List of Classic NES Series games">
<text>This is a list of games that are part of the Classic NES Series in North America, in Japan, and NES Classics in Europe and Australia. The series consists of emulated Nintendo Entertainment System, Family Computer, and Family Computer Disk System games for the Game Boy Advance.

A special edition Game Boy Advance SP that has a similar color pattern to an NES controller (along with a Famicom counterpart in Japan), was released to go along with these games. In Japan, the color of the cartridges often matches the color of their original Famicom cartridges, but in North America, all the games in this series were released in a light gray cartridges made to resemble the default color of NES cartridges.

==List==
All of the games were published by Nintendo.

===Nintendo===
A total of 18 first-party games were released in the series. Of these, six were previously released by alternative means on the Game Boy Advance:
* &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; for the GameCube featured an Advance Play mode, allowing NES games to be played on a Game Boy Advance by using a GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable. Two other games feature a yellow check mark, as they do not support Advance Play.
* The e-Reader accessory featured a NES emulator for the Game Boy Advance, allowing NES games to be played after scanning the corresponding cards.
===Third party===
== Reception ==
Upon launch of the series in Japan, 1 million units were sold within eight days.

The series of reissues had a mixed reception. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot complained that a &quot;Bomberman&quot; without multiplayer is &quot;hardly a &quot;Bomberman&quot; at all&quot;. &quot;Metroid&quot;″s inclusion in the series was considered redundant by Bob Colayco of GameSpot, since it was already included as an unlockable extra in the remake &quot;&quot; as well as in &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;.

Some reviewers were annoyed that the Classic NES Series versions of some games differed slightly from the originals. For example, Craig Harris of IGN complained that the Classic NES Series version of &quot;Xevious&quot; had an automatic firing setting that made it less difficult than the original. Reviewers also complained about the lack of the pie/cement level in &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. In &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, the screen ratio aspect was altered, causing odd graphical artifacts.

The prices of the Classic NES Series and previous rereleases were also criticized. Many reviewers noted that $20 was a high price for one game. Both GameSpot and IGN noted that Nintendo had given away &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; and &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot; for free in the Collector&#x27;s Edition bonus disc, although they conceded that the Classic NES Series version was portable. However, reviewers consistently hailed &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;Castlevania&quot;, &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot; and &quot;Dr. Mario&quot; as being worth the cost of the cartridge.

<text>Ozomatli is an American rock band, formed in 1995 in Los Angeles. They are known both for their vocal activist viewpoints and incorporating a wide array of musical styles – including salsa, jazz, funk, reggae, hip hop, and others. The group formed in 1995 and has since released seven studio albums. The group is also known for advocating for farm-workers&#x27; rights and immigration reform. The band has performed in various countries all over the world, including China, Tunisia, Jordan, Cuba, and Burma. Although the band has had many member changes over the years and has sometimes had as many as ten members, the current six members have been in the band since its debut album.

In 1998, Ozomatli released its self-titled debut album, and soon after opened for Santana on their Supernatural Tour. The group released &quot;Embrace the Chaos&quot; in 2001, followed by &quot;Street Signs&quot; in 2004. &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess with the Dragon&quot; followed in 2007, which saw the band experimenting with a more diverse array of musical styles. The group composed music for &quot;Happy Feet 2&quot; and recorded &quot;Ozomatli Presents Ozokidz&quot;, a family-friendly album. From 2011 to 2014, Ozomatli also served as the house band for stand-up comedian Gabriel Iglesias&#x27; television show, &quot;Gabriel Iglesias Presents Stand Up Revolution&quot;.

==History==
===1995–1998: Formation and debut album===
Ozomatli take their name from the Nahuatl word from the astrological symbol of the monkey, taken from the Aztec calendar. Ozomatli is also a god of dance, fire, the new harvest, and music. In 1995, all the members met while attempting to form a workers union within Los Angeles. Though they were not able to win recognition, they were given an abandoned building for one month. The building turned into a cultural arts center, and within it Ozomatli was born.

In a 2007 NPR interview, band members Jiro Yamaguchi and Ulises Bella describe Ozomatli:
The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Ozomatli&quot;, was released on June 16, 1998, on Almo Sounds. At the time, in addition to the band&#x27;s six constant members, namely vocalist/trumpet player Asdru Sierra, vocalist/guitarist Raul Pacheco, sax and clarinet player Ulises Bella, bassist Wil-Dog Abers and percussionists Justin &#x27;El Niño&#x27; Porée and Jiro Yamaguchi, Ozomatli also featured MC Chali 2na, turntablist Cut Chemist, drummer William Marrufo, and saxophone player Jose Espinoza. The album featured the band&#x27;s trademark mix of several types of Latin music: tropical genres like merengue and cumbia, Mexican styles like norteño, along with Jamaican music like ska and reggae, mixed with a heavy dose of American hip-hop and funk, often with a few genres mixed together in the same song. The band sang its socially-conscious (but sometimes humorous) lyrics mostly in Spanish, while Chali 2na&#x27;s rapped in English.

The album reached mainstream success following an appearance on the late night talk show &quot;Vibe!&quot;. It reached No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Albums chart (71 weeks) and No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Pop Albums chart (50 weeks). Two singles released from the album were &quot;Cut Chemist Suite&quot; and &quot;Super Bowl Sundae&quot;. In 1999, Ozomatli joined Mana and Carlos Santana on tour following Santana&#x27;s release of Supernatural, and in 2002, the band appeared on &quot;One of These Days&quot;, the penultimate track on the latter&#x27;s album &quot;Shaman&quot;.

===1999–2005: &quot;Embrace the Chaos&quot; and &quot;Street Signs&quot;===
Ozomatli&#x27;s second album, &quot;Embrace the Chaos&quot;, was released on September 11, 2001, the same day as the September 11 attacks. Although many American bands cancelled their concerts, Ozomatli gained some recognition for continuing to play their concerts, all the while continuing their commitment to social justice and progressive politics, in addition to the rising anti-war movement. The album featured a similar mix of Latin and hip-hop music as the debut had, with the lyrics taking an even more political stance. In 2002, &quot;Embrace the Chaos&quot; won a Grammy for the Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album.

By the album&#x27;s release, the band had experienced several member changes: drummer William Marrufo had been replaced by Andy Mendoza, and MC Chali 2na, turntablist Cut Chemist, and saxophone player Jose Espinoza had all left. With no official MC for the rap vocals, the band used a variety of guest MCs on the album, including Kanetic Source. Percussionist Justin Porée also did some of the rap vocals for the first time. Rene &#x27;DJ Spinobi&#x27; Dominguez also appeared on turntables as a guest. While touring for the album, Kanetic Source and DJ Spinobi both joined the lineup.

In 2003, Ozomatli released a six-song EP through Concord Records, featuring a collaboration with the Kumbia Kings on &quot;Mi Gente&quot;. In addition to Kanetic Source and DJ Spinobi, the album also featured new members Sheffer Bruton on trombone and Mario Calire on drums. The EP featured mostly the band&#x27;s Latin-influenced side, with most lyrics in Spanish, although the song &#x27;Let Me Dream&#x27; was the first song sung (as opposed to rapped) entirely in English that would appear on their recorded releases.

Before recording their next album, Kanetic Source was replaced by M.C. Jabu Smith-Freeman. The resulting 10-man lineup: the core of Sierra, Pacheco, Bella, Abers, Porée and Yamaguichi joined by Bruton, Calire, MC Jabu and Dj Spinobi would last for the next few years.

In 2004, &quot;Street Signs&quot; was released under Concord Records. In 2001, the album won the Grammy for &quot;Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album2005, The album also won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 2005. &quot;. In addition to MC Jabu&#x27;s rap vocals, Porée played a bigger role than before as second MC, and original MC Chali 2na guested on one song as well. The album expanded the band&#x27;s sound even farther, with a Middle-Eastern influence featured on some tracks. While it was still predominantly in Spanish, the band was also singing more in English as well.

In 2005, Ozomatli released their live album &quot;Live at the Fillmore&quot;, recorded at The Fillmore in San Francisco.

===2006–2009: &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess with the Dragon&quot;===

In 2006, Ozomatli were invited by the U.S. State Department to serve as official Cultural Ambassadors on a series of government-sponsored international tours. The band has since traveled to Asia, Africa, South America, the Middle East, Tunisia, India, Jordan, Nepal, Myanmar, Vietnam, Thailand, and China.

In late 2006, shortly before the release of &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess With the Dragon&quot;, DJ Spinobi left the band to pursue personal projects (but stuck around until the album&#x27;s release, as he appears in the photos and is credited as a member). This was the end of the longest lasting Ozomatli lineup, and the first of many lineup changes that would occur over the next year and a half.

April 3, 2007, saw the release of their fourth studio album &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess With The Dragon&quot;, which was co-produced by K. C. Porter and released on Concord Records. The genre-crossing album was written at a local Los Angeles Latino art gallery, Tropico de Nopal. The album includes songs such as &quot;After Party&quot;, which pays homage to old-school Chicano R&amp;B, &quot;When I Close My Eyes&quot;, which nods back to Fishbone and Oingo Boingo, &quot;La Segunda Mano&quot;, which features the vocals of Quetzal&#x27;s Martha Gonzales blending son jarocho with hip-hop, &quot;City of Angels&quot;, which celebrates the city of Los Angeles, and &quot;Temperatura&quot;, which was inspired by the May 2006 pro-immigration marches. The band also experimented with a more accessible Latin-pop sound on songs like &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop&quot; and &quot;Here We Go&quot;, and for the first time featured more English lyrics than Spanish lyrics.

On September 20, 2007, Ozomatli announced that MC Jabu was leaving the group on amicable terms. He would not be officially replaced, although Tre Hardson would take his place on tour in 2007 and 2008.

In early 2008, the group did a song for the Los Angeles Dodgers called &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop the Blue&quot;, their first recording with Tre Hardson. In the video, LA drummer Chris Cano is seen in place of Calire. Shortly thereafter, Sheffer Bruton and Tre Hardson were no longer seen playing with the group, and Mario Calire appeared back on the drumseat. In the summer of 2008, Ozomatli announced Chali 2na would be joining them for their Fall 2008 tour, although he did not permanently rejoin the band. Later that year, group members Wil-dog and Justin contributed their voices to the Konami music game Dance Dance Revolution X as in-game announcers.

===2010–present: Stripped-down lineup===
In 2010, Ozomatli released their fifth full-length album, &quot;Fire Away&quot;, which was recorded by a stripped-down lineup, featuring the six constant members plus Carire on drums. Justin Porée, in addition to his percussion duties, also became the band&#x27;s only MC on the album and also sang some lead vocals as well. Bassist Abers also got his first lead vocal spot on the song &#x27;Caballito.&#x27; While the band&#x27;s sound remained an eclectic mix, there was a noticeable drop in the influence of Latin musics, and not many lyrics in Spanish. Several of the songs featured a more accessible, R&amp;B-based sound. The album also had fewer overtly political songs, although the track &#x27;Gay Vatos in Love&#x27; made a clear statement of support for LGBT rights.

In 2010, Ozomatli helped celebrate the Boston Pops 125th Anniversary, accompanied by the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Since that first orchestral collaboration, they have gone on to perform with the National Symphony Orchestra at the Kennedy Center, the Colorado Symphony, the San Diego Symphony, and the New York Pops.

Ozomatli made an appearance at TEDxSF – the first musical talk ever given at any TED conference – mixing discussion and sound to explore the challenges and promises of musical identities in a global age.

Ozomatli has also been involved in composing and scoring and contributing music to &quot;Happy Feet 2&quot; and Elmo&#x27;s Musical Monsterpiece for Warner Brothers Interactive, SIMS for EA Games, music for PBS Kids, the films &quot;A Better Life&quot; and &quot;Harlistas&quot;, and for the TV Show &quot;Standup Revolution&quot; on Comedy Central.

In this period of time, the band focused on &quot;Ozomatli Presents Ozokidz&quot;, a special family-friendly set geared towards performing for children and adults alike. The album was released on Hornblow Recordings in September 2012.

The next record was &quot;Place in the Sun&quot; released in 2014, and featuring Dave Stewart&#x27;s production and co-writing, released on Vanguard. The album featured somewhat of a return to the Latin-flavored sounds of the band&#x27;s earlier work, with more lyrics in Spanish than the previous two albums, although English remained the primary language. It was recorded by the same lineup as the previous album, with Carire on drums. Calire subsequently left the band, and percussionist Jiro Yamaguchi took over the drum seat, leaving the band with six members.

Ozomatli celebrated their 20th anniversary as a performing band in 2015, with all remaining members having been in the band since its debut album,

The band&#x27;s next project, released in May 2017, was &quot;Nonstop Mexico to Jamaica&quot;, an album of songs that have been a big part of the Mexican and Mexican-American community&#x27;s heritage, culling from Selena, Cafe Tacuba, Mana, and many others. As reflected in the title, the songs are approached reggae style and the project was being produced by Jamaican reggae legends, Sly and Robbie. Although the album contains be some English-language lyrics, the album was the band&#x27;s first Spanish-dominated release since &quot;Street Signs&quot;.

In 2021, Ozomatli released a cover of Ramon Ayala&#x27;s &quot;La Rama Del Mezquite&quot;, featuring Cherine Anderson. As part of their 25th anniversary, the band also announced a new album in development, to be released via Blue Élan Records.

==Social and political activism==
Ozomatli create music to: give voice to and reveal the culture and lives of Latinos; fight for workers&#x27; rights; and promote a global unity within both the city and the world. They promote this through their music, during their TEDxSF talk, and as Cultural Ambassadors of the US.

<text>Desford is a village and civil parish in the Hinckley and Bosworth district of England, west of the centre of Leicester and around 7 miles north east of Hinckley. Situated on a hill approximately 400 feet above sea level, the parish includes the hamlets of Botcheston and Newtown Unthank and a scattered settlement at Lindridge. The population at the 2021 census had increased to 4,592. Desford is in the Doomsday Book of 1086 but the name itself is older than that meaning Deor&#x27;s Ford suggesting an Anglo Saxon origin. Another suggestion is that it means &#x27;ford frequented with wild animals&#x27;.

==Manors==
At Lindridge about north of the town is a rectangular moat up to wide enclosing an area about by . In the 19th century it was temporarily drained and six early 14th century pottery vessels were found. A building such as a manor house is likely to have stood on the island created by the moat. The moat is a scheduled monument.

In 1261, the manor of Desford was held by Simon De Montfort until he was killed at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. All his lands, which included Desford, were then given by Henry III to his own son, Edmund Grouchback, who was Earl of Lancaster until his death in 1297.

The Old Hall or Old Manor House in Desford High Street is a gable-roofed building with an irregular front of four bays, dating from about 1600 or a few years thereafter. It is built of brick in English bond with stone quoins and has a timber frame. The house has a two-storeyed porch whose upper storey is jettied. Attached to the house is an early 18th-century service wing built of brick in Flemish bond. The Manor House and its attached buildings are Grade II* listed buildings.

==Churches==
The Church of England parish church of Saint Martin has a Norman font but the present building appears to be late 13th century. The chancel includes two lancet windows. There is a south aisle with an arcade that seems to be late 13th century. The west tower and spire are Perpendicular Gothic and therefore later: a window in the tower west wall is 14th century. The architect Stockdale Harrison of Leicester restored St. Martin&#x27;s in 1884. The tower has a ring of six bells, all cast by John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough in 1912. St. Martin&#x27;s is a Grade II* listed building. The first rector of St Martin’s was recorded in 1246 as Brian de Walton. It is believed a rood-screen once stretched across the chancel arch and above the screen was an image of Christ impaled on the cross.

St. Martin&#x27;s parish is part of a united benefice with St. Mary Magdalene, Peckleton.

Desford has a free church, built in 1866 at the top of Chapel lane, which is a member of the Baptist Union of Great Britain.

In 1790, the little chapel of the Strict Baptists was built in the High Street but only the graveyard with a few stones remains.

==Economic history==
Until the 1700s most of the residents were engaged in agriculture farming arable strips in four open fields in the parish and pasturing their animals on the low lying meadows by the streams. 

Desford&#x27;s common lands 1000 acres of open fields were enclosed by Act of Parliament in 1759 . Prior to the Industrial Revolution the cottage industry of stocking or framework knitting developed in the village, the first reference being in 1704. This continued well in to the 19th century, with over a hundred framework knitters being recorded in the 1851 Census. 

The 19th century was a time when coal mining became a large scale industry in west Leicestershire. In 1875 an unsuccessful attempt was made to sink a coalmine in the parish, at Lindridge. This failed due to constant flooding. In the present century the nearest coal mine, Desford Pit, only two miles away, employed many Desford people until it closed in 1984. To commemorate the pit’s closure a half winding wheel was erected in Lindridge Lane by the Desford History Society. 

The Leicester and Swannington Railway was built through the parish in 1832 initially to haul coal from the coalfields to Leicester. It passes within of the town and Desford railway station was built at Newtown Unthank to serve the parish. The Midland Railway took over the line in 1845 and had extended it to by 1848. British Railways withdrew passenger services in 1964 and today the Leicester to Burton-upon-Trent Line carries only goods traffic. The larger houses in Station Road were built for middle-class commuters to Leicester.

Caterpillar Inc. is now a significant employer in the parish (see below).

== Public houses ==
Over the years Desford has possessed a number of inns and pubs including The Blacksmiths Arms, The Blue Bell, The Bulls Head, The Red Lion, The Lancaster, The Roebuck, The Wheel and the White Horse. Of these the only ones surviving as public houses are the Lancaster near to the site of the old station and the Blue Bell Inn in the centre of the village. The building of the Roebuck can still be seen but is now a private residence. The Red Lion was redeveloped as part of a small exclusive development - there is a plaque on the wall commemorating the site of the former Red Lion Inn. The White Horse Inn is now a branch of the popular Italian tapas chain &quot;Pesto&quot;.

==Aerodrome==
South of the town, Reid and Sigrist had created Desford Aerodrome on Carts Field plus land in the adjoining Peckleton parish, it is mentioned in &quot;The Bystander&quot; in 1929. By 1936. It was a flying training school, with George E. Lowdell as its Chief flying Instructor. The majority of aeroplanes used were De Havilland Tiger Moth single engined biplanes. An early form of flight simulator was also used and was visible from the public road. Leicester Aero Club used the aerodrome until it moved to nearby Ratcliffe Aerodrome. Early in 1939 Lowdell flew the first flight of the New Malden-built Reid and Sigrist R.S.1 Snargasher from Desford. During World War Two the aerodrome was an RAF training centre. 

Post 1945 RAF No 1969 AOP Flight was stationed here. Reid and Segrist developed the R.S.3 Desford as a trainer aircraft for use after the war. 

The aerodrome has been redeveloped as an industrial site where Caterpillar Inc. has a large factory. The officers mess was located on what is now the Sport in Desford site. 

==Amenities==
The parish has three public houses, two in Desford: the Blue Bell, Lancaster Arms and the Greyhound in Botcheston.

Desford has a community primary school and a secondary school, Bosworth Academy.

Desford has an Italian restaurant (Pesto, previously the White Horse), a public library and a sports club. Tropical Birdland, a visitor attraction exhibiting many bird species, is situated in Lindridge Lane in Desford.

There are two Co-Operative Society shops, an independent store which is now also the post office as well as a Fish and Chip takeaway and an Indian takeaway, Little India. There is a take away and eat in café called the &quot;Food Room&quot; situated in the centre of the village in one of the oldest buildings. 

Sport in Desford (SiD) was set up as an independent organisation by Desford Parish Council (DPC) in 1988 and it became a Registered Charity (No.: 1100319) in 2003. DPC acquired the 5 acre plot on Peckleton Lane from Caterpillar UK in 1988 and SiD has developed what was a derelict site ever since, including the building of the double storey clubhouse, the new Scout Hall (funded by DPC) and the extra tennis court.

The Parish Council maintain the following open spaces in the parish:

=== The Pickard Recreation Area ===

* This open space was given to the village by Councillor Pickard in the early 1900s for the use of young children. Consequently appropriate play equipment has been installed there.
* There is also a pleasant grass area surrounded by trees and spring bulb planting
* Some seating is provided

=== The Kirkby Road Recreation Area ===

* This is a large grassed area near the Primary School which has space for Changing Rooms and 2 full size football pitches

<doc id="771451" wikidata="Q334093" url="?curid=771451" title="Neurosis (band)">
<text>Neurosis is an American post-metal band from Oakland, California. It was formed in 1985 by guitarist Scott Kelly, bassist Dave Edwardson, and drummer Jason Roeder, initially as a crust punk band. Chad Salter joined as a second guitarist and appeared on the band&#x27;s 1987 debut &quot;Pain of Mind&quot; and then Steve Von Till replaced him in 1989. The following year, the lineup further expanded to include a keyboardist and a visual artist. Beginning with their third album &quot;Souls at Zero&quot; (1992), Neurosis transformed their hardcore sound by incorporating diverse influences including doom metal and industrial music, becoming a major force in the emergence of the post-metal and sludge metal genres.

The band&#x27;s lineup stabilized in 1995 with the addition of Noah Landis, who replaced Simon McIlroy on keyboards and electronics. That same year they formed the experimental music group Tribes of Neurot and in 1999 the record label Neurot Recordings. This line-up remained stable until 2019, when the band parted ways with Kelly after discovering his history of domestic violence against his family, though this would not come to light until August 2022 out of respect for the privacy of Kelly&#x27;s family members. The band has been on hiatus since then, and there is currently no information on whether or not the band will continue or disband.

Neurosis have garnered critical recognition over the course of their 11 studio albums. The BBC credited them with taking &quot;heavy music to previously unimaginable spaces ... [and shaping] metal&#x27;s definitive response to the 21st century.&quot;

==History==
===Formation and early years (1985–1995)===

In late 1985, Scott Kelly, Dave Edwardson, and Jason Roeder, formerly members of Violent Coercion, founded Neurosis as a hardcore punk outfit, inspired also by British crust punk in the vein of Amebix.

In 1986, Chad Salter was added on second guitar and vocals. There have only been a few changes in the lineup of Neurosis&#x27; musicians since band&#x27;s inception. In 1989 guitarist/vocalist Chad Salter was replaced by Steve Von Till, who previously played in bands Transgressor, Peace Test and Tribe of Resistance, and in 1990, Simon McIlroy joined the band as a synthesizer/sampler with Adam Kendall as visual artist (Adam and Simon have been friends since they were teenagers and they were doing a lot of experimental music together before). In 1995, Noah Landis, a childhood friend of Dave Edwardson, replaced Simon McIlroy as keyboardist.

With &quot;The Word as Law&quot;, Neurosis began to transition from the rapid-fire hardcore punk of &quot;Pain of Mind&quot; to the more experimental sound of &quot;Souls at Zero&quot;, which featured slower tempos, unorthodox song structures, and guest performers on instruments like trumpet, violin and flute. The album would ultimately prove critical in the development of the post-metal genre and atmospheric sludge metal. Neurosis&#x27; signature sound came into full force with &quot;Enemy of the Sun&quot;, with &quot;The Quietus&quot; observing that &quot;at the time few could have predicted this black hole of agonizingly precise metal riffs, unnerving backmasking, industrial folkisms and extensive sampling&quot;.

===&quot;Through Silver in Blood&quot; to &quot;The Eye of Every Storm&quot; (1996–2004)===
In 1996, Neurosis attracted mainstream attention with its Relapse Records debut, &quot;Through Silver in Blood&quot; and subsequent tour with Pantera. In 1999, Neurosis released &quot;Times of Grace&quot;, which was designed to be played synchronously with &quot;Grace&quot;, an album released by Neurosis&#x27; ambient side project, Tribes of Neurot.

In the early 2000s, the band founded their own independent record label, Neurot Recordings, which, in addition to releasing material from Neurosis and its associated projects, signed several other artists.

Beginning with &quot;A Sun That Never Sets&quot;, Neurosis began incorporating clean vocals and acoustic instrumentation with a growing folk music influence, more noted presence of classical string instruments (which had been used sparsely since &quot;Souls At Zero&quot;) as well as slower tempos and a more contemplative sound. Allmusic described this change as an &quot;aesthetic sea change&quot;. 2004&#x27;s &quot;The Eye of Every Storm&quot; expanded upon this change by incorporating more ambient textures into the mix and presenting a softer post-rock oriented sound.

===&quot;Given to the Rising&quot;, &quot;Honor Found in Decay&quot;, &quot; Fires Within Fires&quot; (2007–2019)===

The band released their ninth studio album &quot;Given to the Rising&quot; on May 8, 2007, through Neurot Records. On this album Neurosis re-incorporated a more aggressive approach into their music once again, and the album was well received by critics.

The band entered the studio in December 2011 to record the follow-up to &quot;Given to the Rising&quot;. The new album, entitled &quot;Honor Found in Decay&quot;, was released in late October 2012.

The band performed at Roadburn 2016, with Brooklyn Vegan&#x27;s Ian Cory writing that &quot;once the house lights came up it was hard to justify watching anything else.&quot; This was part of their series of shows performed in celebration of their 30th anniversary as a band.

On May 5, 2016, relapse Records confirmed they were reissuing &quot;A Sun That Never Sets&quot; and &quot;The Eye of Every Storm&quot; on vinyl on June 17 with new artwork.

On August 1, 2016, the band released a teaser trailer for their upcoming album online. Their eleventh studio album, titled &quot;Fires Within Fires&quot;, was released on September 23, 2016.

=== Scott Kelly&#x27;s dismissal, Jason Roeder&#x27;s retirement from touring (2019–present) ===
Following a Facebook post confessing to allegations of abuse towards his wife and family, Scott Kelly retired from music and public life in August 2022.

According to a statement released by the band&#x27;s Facebook page the next day, Kelly had been quietly expelled from the group in 2019 when his bandmates discovered the extent of his abuse and domestic violence. The band never made any prior formal announcements regarding this &quot;out of respect for [Kelly&#x27;s] wife&#x27;s direct request for privacy, and to honor the family&#x27;s wish not to let their experience become gossip in a music magazine.&quot; In the post, the band condemned Kelly&#x27;s abuse and described being filled with &quot;disgust and disappointment&quot; towards &quot;a man who we once called Brother&quot;. There is currently no announcement or info on whether or not the band will continue or disband, as &quot;in due course, when it&#x27;s appropriate, we will provide more information about our future musical endeavors, but that time is not now.&quot;

In January 2025, drummer Jason Roeder announced on his social media pages that he would no longer be touring and he intended to sell most, if not all, of his musical equipment. In a follow-up post, Roeder denied he was retiring from music altogether, and further stated: &quot;As far as Neurosis goes - I don&#x27;t know. The remaining members are truly amazing people and with or without me I am sure they will continue to do mind-blowing work, whatever form it takes.&quot;

==Visuals==

From 1990 to 1993, Adam G. Kendall was recruited to create visuals and perform live with the band. Following his departure from touring, Pete Inc. took over the job, although Kendall continued to contribute visuals for the band until as late as 1997. Kendall also shot the footage for the &quot;Locust Star&quot; video.

Josh Graham took over live visuals in early 2000 as Pete wasn&#x27;t &quot;cutting the mustard&quot; (in the words of Steve Von Till), and created album artwork for 2004&#x27;s &quot;The Eye of Every Storm&quot;, 2007&#x27;s &quot;Given to the Rising&quot;, and 2012&#x27;s &quot;Honor Found in Decay&quot;, as well as re-designs for the reissues of Souls at Zero and Enemy of the Sun. Graham and Neurosis amicably parted ways in late November 2012 via an announcement on the band website. He was not replaced and the band ceased to use live visual media.

Often experimental and psychedelic in nature, Neurosis&#x27; visual media have added to the reputation of their live performances. Many of the visuals for their tours supporting &quot;Through Silver in Blood&quot; are taken from Ken Russell&#x27;s film &quot;Altered States&quot;. Other images are included in the enhanced portion of the &quot;Sovereign&quot; EP, and on the &quot;A Sun That Never Sets&quot; DVD video release. The majority of the DVD release was directed by Graham, with an additional video by Chad Rullman.

==Musical style and influences==
Neurosis formed as a hardcore punk band, performing a blend of hardcore and heavy metal inspired by British punk and described as crust punk or crossover. Already their second album &quot;The Word as Law&quot; (1990) incorporated avant-garde music and sludge metal, a genre marrying the ferocity of hardcore and the deep heaviness of doom metal. Thereafter, the band developed an original sound. Greg Moffitt of the BBC wrote that through a &quot;process of evolution and refinement&quot; beginning with their third album &quot;Souls at Zero&quot; (1992) and culminating in their fifth, &quot;Through Silver in Blood&quot; (1996), they &quot;[took] heavy music to previously unimaginable spaces and, in the process, shape[d] what has thus far been metal&#x27;s definitive response to the 21st century.&quot;

The style Neurosis pioneered has been named post-metal, an &quot;expansive, progressive and often apocalyptic&quot; sound, &quot;adding alien sounds, oddball instrumentation and atmospheric depth to [the] viscerally crushing approach&quot; of sludge metal. Their sound has also been described as experimental/avant-garde metal, doom metal, post-hardcore, industrial metal, drone metal, stoner metal, psychedelic metal, progressive metal, alternative metal, art metal, and extreme metal, and as employing elements of folk. Steve Huey of AllMusic called it sludge infused with industrial, metal, and alternative rock, while Kory Grow of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it a mix of &quot;metal, punk, sludge and avant-garde experiments.&quot;

When asked what the band&#x27;s influences are in a 2000 interview, Scott Kelly stated: &quot;Mainly ourselves at this point, but our foundation ranges through Black Flag, Pink Floyd, Die Kreuzen, Amebix, Jimi Hendrix, King Crimson, The Melvins, Celtic Frost and, of course, Hank Williams.&quot; In other interviews, members of the band also listed Throbbing Gristle, Joy Division, Black Sabbath, Crass, Voivod, Loop, Godflesh, Swans, and Townes Van Zandt as influences. In 2007, Steve Von Till stated that lyrically he and Kelly are inspired by literature, alluding to writers such as Cormac McCarthy, Jack London, and Paul Bowles.

In an interview with The Guardian in 2016, the band cited the British Anarcho-punk bands of the early 80s &quot;rife with bitterness, rage and fear, but also possessed of a desire to experiment with punk rock’s parameters, be they sonic, visual or ideological&quot; as being a collective influence, including Flux of Pink Indians, Oi Polloi, Icons of Filth, Amebix, Discharge, Subhumans, Rudimentary Peni, Crass and Chumbawamba. Other artists of other genres were also mentioned such as Killing Joke Swans, Skullflower, Hawkwind and Townes Van Zandt.

Some commentators note that both sonically and lyrically, Neurosis convey an intense emotional-spiritual effect. There is a mythical aspect to their imagery or a ritual aspect to their performance. Brandon Geist of &quot;Revolver&quot; relates that &quot;Kelly and Von Till ... speak about their band in bold, quasi-religious, &#x27;honor and glory&#x27;–type language. Words like &quot;commitment&quot;, &quot;sacrifice&quot;, &quot;surrender&quot;, and &quot;spirit&quot; come up a lot.&quot;

Many bands and artists have cited Neurosis as an important inspiration, including 
Converge, 
Slipknot, 
Agalloch, 
Yob, 
Isis, 
Mastodon, 
Amenra, 
Kylesa, 
Pelican, 
Wolves in the Throne Room, 
Cobalt, 
Withered, 
Baroness, 
Oathbreaker, 
Chelsea Wolfe, 
Pallbearer, and
Full of Hell. 
Their influence echoes through acts that have defined the post-metal genre, such as Isis, Boris, Agalloch, Amenra, Pelican, and Deafheaven.

<text>Emmanuel Laurent Petit (; born 22 September 1970) is a French former professional footballer who played as a defensive midfielder at club level for Arsenal, Barcelona, Monaco, and Chelsea. He represented France at international level in two FIFA World Cups and two UEFA European Championships; he scored the third goal in France&#x27;s 3–0 victory in the 1998 FIFA World Cup Final and was also a member of the French squad that won UEFA Euro 2000.

==Early life==
Petit was born in Dieppe, Seine-Maritime, and grew up in Arques-la-Bataille.

==Club career==
Petit began his career at minor club ES Arques-la-Bataille before being signed by Arsène Wenger&#x27;s Monaco side at the age of 18. He made his debut soon after and played in the 1989 Coupe de France final. Petit became a regular at Monaco, playing as a left-sided or central midfielder. In 1991, he won the Coupe de France with Monaco and also played in the 1992 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final (which Monaco lost to Werder Bremen). In 1996–97, his final season at Monaco, he captained his side to the Ligue 1 title.

Petit joined Arsenal in June 1997 for £2.5 million, where he was reunited with his former Monaco manager Arsène Wenger. Wenger switched Petit from central midfielder to defensive midfielder, and partnered him with fellow Frenchman Patrick Vieira. The French duo formed a midfield partnership which brought instant success, as Petit won the double with Arsenal in his very first season, clinching both the Premier League title and the FA Cup. Altogether, in the three seasons in his Arsenal career, Petit made 118 appearances and scored 11 goals, including a stunning drive from outside the area against Derby County (which was also the winning goal), during the 1997–98 season.

Petit moved to Barcelona (together with Arsenal teammate Marc Overmars) in the summer of 2000 for £7 million (€14 million). At Barcelona, he was moved back into defence and suffered a rash of niggling injuries. As a result, he failed to settle and could not hold down a regular place. In his biography, published in 2008, the midfielder gave his time at Barcelona a special chapter in which he exposed that coach Lorenzo Serra Ferrer did not even know what position he played when he joined the team. His only goal for Barcelona came on 13 May 2001 at home to Rayo Vallecano in a 5–1 win.

After his first season at the Camp Nou, Petit was linked with moves back to England with Manchester United, Tottenham and Chelsea, joining the latter in 2001 in a £7.5 million transfer deal. He initially was a first-team regular for the &quot;Blues&quot; in a largely disappointing first season and played in the 2002 FA Cup final which Chelsea lost to his old club, Arsenal. He scored his first goal for Chelsea in a 2–1 win over Derby on 30 March 2002. His second season saw a significant improvement, as he formed an impressive midfield partnership with Frank Lampard as Chelsea impressed in the winner-takes-all final game of the season against Liverpool as Chelsea secured the fourth UEFA Champions League berth. He also scored twice throughout the season: against Everton in the League Cup, and former club Arsenal in the league. After a series of knee injuries, however, he spent much of the final season of his career on the sidelines, and he was released on a free transfer in the summer of 2004, his final appearance for the club coming against Blackburn Rovers on 1 February 2004.

After being released by Chelsea, Petit rejected the chance to sign for Bolton Wanderers, and he announced his retirement on 20 January 2005 after failing to fully recover following knee surgery.

==International career==
Playing for the France national team, Petit earned 63 caps and scored six international goals in his career and won the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000. He scored twice in the 1998 World Cup, the first from a powerful shot from just outside the box against Denmark, which turned out to be the match winner, and a second in the final against Brazil. The goal he scored in the final was particularly memorable, as he had embarked on an optimistic run across field before calmly slotting in the goal in the final minute of regular time. That same goal happened to be the 1,000th goal in the history of the French Football Federation and the last World Cup Finals goal of the 20th century. France won the match 3–0. An earlier Petit corner kick had set up Zinedine Zidane&#x27;s header for France&#x27;s first goal. Petit was also part of the 2002 World Cup squad, though France failed to advance past the group stages and failed to score a single goal in three matches during their defence of the trophy.

Petit retired from international football in September 2003.

==Style of play==
Although capable of playing as a defender, Petit usually played as a defensive midfielder throughout his career, and was known for his energy, work-rate, strength, tackling, aerial prowess, and positional intelligence in this position, as well as his elegance, his passing range, and his striking ability from distance with his left foot; as such, he was not only capable of breaking up attacks, but of dictating play in midfield, creating chances for teammates, and even scoring goals.

==Personal life==
Petit married French actress Agathe de La Fontaine, in 2000, but they divorced in 2002 after having one child, Zoe. He now shares his life with Maria Servello, with whom he had another child, Violet, in 2007. He has often appeared on French TV as a football analyst.
His brother Olivier was an amateur footballer when Petit was a teenager. While playing for his club Arques in 1988, Olivier collapsed and was rushed to hospital where he was pronounced dead due to a blood clot of the brain. In his biography, Petit explained that this event shocked him to such an extent that it almost made him quit football. He viewed his brother as a gifted young man who had good looks and did well in all his endeavours, whether it was football or education. At age 18, he was already facing the demanding rigors of the Monaco youth academy, and not so soon, he had lost his grandfather. His brother’s and grandfather’s loss happened in a bracket of two years and the passing of his brother almost became the final straw.

Petit wore the number 17 shirt in club football throughout his career as 17 was his brother&#x27;s age when he died 

He starred as himself in a Christmas special episode of British police show &quot;The Bill&quot; in 1998.

Petit has been an ambassador for the Homeless World Cup movement since the tournament was hosted by Paris in 2011.

<text>Java Virtual Machine Tool Interface (JVMTI, or more properly, JVM TI) was introduced in J2SE 5.0 (&quot;Tiger&quot;). This interface allows a program to inspect the state and to control the execution of applications running in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). JVMTI is designed to provide an Application Programming Interface (API) for the development of tools that need access to the state of the JVM. Examples for such tools are debuggers or profilers.

The JVMTI is a native interface of the JVM. A library, written in C or C++, is loaded during the initialization of the JVM. The library has access to the JVM state by calling JVMTI and JNI (Java Native Interface) functions and can register to receive JVMTI events using event handler functions that are called by the JVM when such an event occurs.

JVMTI was defined through the Java Community Process by JSR-163, the specification for the Java Platform Profiling Architecture. The JVMTI replaces the JVMPI (Java Virtual Machine Profiling Interface) and the JVMDI (Java Virtual Machine Debug Interface). The JVMPI and the JVMDI are declared as being deprecated in J2SE 5.0 and were removed in Java SE 6.

JVMTI is the lowest-level of the Java Platform Debugger Architecture.

<doc id="771458" wikidata="Q57405" url="?curid=771458" title="Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono">
<text>Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (born 9 September 1949), commonly referred to as SBY, is an Indonesian politician and retired army general who served as the sixth president of Indonesia from 2004 to 2014 and the second president of Indonesia from the military after Suharto. He founded the Democratic Party of Indonesia and served as its 4th chairman from 2014 until 2020. He also served as the 8th and 10th coordinating minister for political and security affairs from 2000 until 2001 and again from 2001 until 2004. He also served as the president of the Assembly and chair of the Council of the Global Green Growth Institute. He was also the former chairman of ASEAN due to Indonesia hosting of the 18th and 19th ASEAN Summits.

Yudhoyono won the 2004 presidential election—the first direct presidential election in Indonesia, defeating incumbent president Megawati Sukarnoputri. He was sworn into office on 20 October 2004, together with Jusuf Kalla as vice president. He ran for re-election in 2009 with Boediono as his running mate, and won with an outright majority of the votes in the first round of balloting; he was sworn in for a second term on 20 October 2009.

During his tenure as president, Indonesia participated in many world peace missions, both at the national and international levels. Yudhoyono successfully negotiated a deal that ended the Aceh insurgency, an insurgency which lasted from 1976 to 2005. As a result, he was given the title &quot;Father of Peace.&quot;

Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono is the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award (Champions of the Earth) in 2014.

==Name==
The name &quot;Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono&quot; is of Javanese origins, with Sanskrit roots. &quot;Susilo&quot; comes from the words &quot;su-&quot;, meaning &quot;good&quot; and &quot;-sila&quot;, meaning &quot;behaviour, conduct, or moral.&quot; &quot;Bambang&quot; is a traditional male name in Javanese, meaning &quot;knight.&quot; While &quot;Yudhoyono&quot; comes from the words &quot;yuddha&quot;, meaning &quot;battle, fight&quot;; and &quot;yana&quot;, meaning &quot;journey.&quot; Thus his full name roughly translates to &quot;well behaved knight on a war mission.&quot;

The name &quot;Yudhoyono&quot; is not an inherited surname; most Javanese do not have surnames. Rather, he chose it for his military name-tag, and it is how he is referred to abroad. His children and grandchildren go by the name &quot;Yudhoyono,&quot; and in formal meetings and functions he is addressed as Dr. Yudhoyono. In Indonesia, he is usually referred to and widely known as &quot;SBY.&quot;

==Early life and education==
===Early life and family===
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was born on 9 September 1949, in Tremas, a village in Arjosari, Pacitan Regency, East Java, to a lower-middle-class family. His father was a Javanese man named Raden Soekotjo (1925 – 4 August 2001), whose lineage can be traced to Hamengkubuwono II, while his mother was a Javanese woman named Siti Habibah (30 June 1932 – 30 August 2019).

===Education===
Yudhoyono had wanted to join the army since he was a child. In school, he developed a reputation as an academic achiever, excelling in writing poems, short stories, and play-acting. Yudhoyono was also talented in music and sport, reflected when he and his friends established a volleyball club called &quot;Klub Rajawali&quot; and a band called &quot;Gaya Teruna&quot;.

When he was in fifth grade, Yudhoyono visited the Indonesian Armed Forces Academy (AKABRI). After seeing the soldiers training there and perhaps inspired by his own father&#x27;s career, Yudhoyono became determined to join the Indonesian Armed Forces and become a soldier. Yudhoyono planned to enlist after graduating from high school in 1968; however, he missed the registration period.

Young Yudhoyono then became a student under the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology (ITS) in Surabaya before entering the Vocational Education Development Center in Malang, East Java. There, he was able to prepare everything for the next phase of his education at the military academy AKABRI. Yudhoyono officially entered AKABRI in 1970 after passing the test in Bandung.

Yudhoyono also studied in the United States, where he received his master&#x27;s degree in Business Management from Webster University in 1991. He subsequently earned PhD in agricultural economics from the Bogor Agricultural University on 3 October 2004, two days before his presidential victory was announced. He was also awarded two honorary doctorates in 2005 in the fields, respectively, of law from his alma mater, Webster University, and in political science from Thammasat University in Thailand. On 12 June 2014, he earned professor degree from Defense University of Indonesia in National Defense Science.

==Military service==
===Military academy===

Yudhoyono spent three years at AKABRI and became the commander of the Cadet Corps Division there. He graduated from AKABRI as second lieutenant in 1973, and as the best graduate of the year, received the prestigious Adhi Makayasa medal from President Suharto.

===Kostrad===
After graduating, Yudhoyono joined the Army Strategic Reserve (Kostrad) and became a platoon commander in the 330th Airborne Battalion. Aside from leading his troops, Yudhoyono was also tasked with giving the battalion soldiers lessons on general knowledge and English. Yudhoyono&#x27;s proficiency in English was one of the reasons why he was sent to the United States to undertake the Airborne and Ranger Courses at Fort Benning in 1975.

Yudhoyono returned to Indonesia in 1976, where he became a platoon commander in the 305th Battalion and was assigned to Indonesian-occupied East Timor. Yudhoyono had several tours of duty and, like many other Indonesian officers involved in the occupation of East Timor, was accused of committing war crimes. However, Yudhoyono has never been charged with any specific act. From East Timor, Yudhoyono became a mortar platoon commander in 1977, an operations officer for an airborne brigade from 1977 to 1978, and a company commander at Kostrad from 1979 to 1981. Yudhoyono then spent 1981 and 1982 working at the Army headquarters.

While working at the Army headquarters, Yudhoyono was sent to the United States again, this time to participate in the Infantry Officer Advanced Course at Fort Benning and in training with the 82nd Airborne Division. Yudhoyono also spent time in Panama and went through the jungle warfare school. When Yudhoyono returned in 1983, he was made commander of the Infantry Trainers&#x27; School. It was not long before he was abroad again, this time to Belgium and West Germany, to undertake the Antitank weapons Course. In 1985, Yudhoyono also took a Battalion Commando Course in Malaysia.

From 1986 to 1988, Yudhoyono served with Kodam IX/Udayana, which covers Bali and the Lesser Sunda Islands. Yudhoyono was a battalion commander from 1986 to 1988 and was part of the operational staff in 1988. In 1989, Yudhoyono became a lecturer at the Army Staff College (Seskoad) and delivered a presentation entitled &quot;ABRI&#x27;s Professionalism at the Present and in the Future&quot;. Together with Agus Wirahadikusumah, Yudhoyono published a book entitled &quot;The Challenges of Development&quot;.

Whilst at Seskoad, Yudhoyono also took the opportunity to further his own military education. He went to the US Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. While in the United States, he took the opportunity to obtain an MA degree in business management from Webster University in 1991.

In 1992, Yudhoyono was transferred to the Army Information Department and worked as a speechwriter for General Edi Sudrajat, the Army chief of staff. In 1993, when Edi became commander of the Military of Indonesia (ABRI), Yudhoyono joined Edi&#x27;s personal staff. Edi did not last long as ABRI commander and Yudhoyono was then transferred back to Kostrad where he became a brigade commander. A year later, Yudhoyono was the operations assistant at Jaya (Jakarta) Military Area Command before taking command IV/Diponegoro Military Area Command in Central Java. Yudhoyono had one more stint overseas when he became Indonesia&#x27;s chief military observer of the United Nation Peacekeeping Force in Bosnia in 1995–96.

When Yudhoyono returned to Indonesia, he was made KODAM Jaya chief of staff before being appointed as KODAM II/Sriwijaya commander. In this position, Yudhoyono was responsible for military operations in southern Sumatra. He served in this position until 1997, when he was appointed chief of staff for social-political affairs. At the same time, he was also appointed chairman of the ABRI Faction in the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly General Session and participated in Suharto&#x27;s election to a seventh term as president.

===Suharto&#x27;s resignation===
During the days which would lead to Suharto&#x27;s resignation in May 1998, Yudhoyono and pro-reform ABRI officers conducted meetings and discussions with Nurcholish Madjid, a secular pro-reform Muslim leader. From his discussions, Yudhoyono accepted the fact that Suharto should resign but like the ABRI officers who went to the meeting with him, was reluctant to withdraw their support of Suharto publicly, much less ask for Suharto&#x27;s resignation. Nevertheless, the pressure eventually become too much for Suharto, who resigned on 21 May 1998.

As Indonesia entered the reform era, ABRI&#x27;s popularity, because of its association with Suharto, was at an all-time low. To de-emphasise ABRI&#x27;s political role, Yudhoyono&#x27;s chief of staff for social-political affairs was renamed chief of staff for territorial affairs and in 1999, ABRI was renamed TNI and the Indonesian National Police (Polri) was split off. At this time, Yudhoyono&#x27;s popularity began to increase as he offered ideas and concepts to reform the military and nation. He did this by combining the strong reformist sentiment of the time with TNI&#x27;s concern for security and stability. Because of his high education (finishing his doctorate during the course of the presidential elections) and his well-planned manoeuvres, Yudhoyono came to be known as &quot;the thinking general.&quot;

==Political career==
===Wahid presidency===

Yudhoyono was appointed mining and energy minister in the cabinet of President Abdurrahman Wahid in 1999. According to General Wiranto, who assisted Wahid in the formation of the Cabinet, he had recommended to the president that Yudhoyono would do better as Army chief of staff. However, Wahid rejected the idea and Yudhoyono became the minister of mining and energy instead. At the same time, Yudhoyono ended his military career with the rank of lieutenant general, although he would be made honorary general in 2000.

Yudhoyono&#x27;s popularity grew, even as minister of mining and energy. In June 2000, there were rumours that Wahid, because of his lack of skill as an administrator was going to appoint a first minister to look after the day-to-day running of the government. Yudhoyono&#x27;s name appeared as a potential candidate for the position, although eventually Wahid appointed Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri as the day to day administrator.

In August 2000, after a cabinet reshuffle, Yudhoyono became the coordinating minister for politic and security affairs. One of his tasks was to separate the army from politics. This was in line with his reformist ideas on the future of Indonesian military, and is a view he has held since his days in an army policy center. He said at that time:

Another task that Yudhoyono was given was as an intermediary between Wahid and the Suharto family. At the time, Wahid was trying to make Suharto hand back all the money which he had allegedly obtained through corruption when he was president. Yudhoyono was sent by Wahid to convey this wish and to negotiate with the former first family. However, Yudhoyono was not successful in this venture.

At the beginning of 2001, with political pressure increasing on him, Wahid ordered Yudhoyono to form a crisis centre with Yudhoyono as chairman The purpose of this crisis centre was to assist the president in giving policy advice and was headquartered at Yudhoyono&#x27;s office. It seemed as if because of this appointment, Yudhoyono could be considered one of Wahid&#x27;s men, however Yudhoyono would break ranks from Wahid in July 2001 when the latter was facing impeachment. In desperation, Wahid issued a decree freezing the People&#x27;s Representative Council (DPR) and then asked Yudhoyono to declare a state of emergency to further strengthen his position. Yudhoyono refused to accept this, and Wahid dismissed him.

===Megawati presidency===

On 23 July 2001, in a special session, the MPR impeached Wahid and replaced him with Megawati as president. A few days later when the MPR assembled to , Yudhoyono threw his name in the hat and competed against Golkar&#x27;s Akbar Tanjung and United Development Party&#x27;s (PPP) Hamzah Haz. Yudhoyono and Akbar lost out to Hamzah Haz who became the new vice president.

Yudhoyono was appointed to his old position of coordinating minister of political and security affairs in Megawati&#x27;s new cabinet. After the Bali bombings in October 2002, he oversaw the hunt for and arrest of those responsible, and gained a reputation both in Indonesia and abroad as one of the few Indonesian politicians who was serious about the War on Terrorism. His speech during the one-year anniversary of the Bali bombings (in which many Australians were killed) was praised by the Australian media and public. Yudhoyono also dealt with the Free Aceh Movement (GAM), a separatist movement wanting to separate the Province of Aceh from Indonesia. On his advice, Megawati declared martial law in Aceh on 19 May 2003, which was then extended in November.

===Democratic Party===

Yudhoyono&#x27;s supporters saw Yudhoyono&#x27;s participation in the vice-presidential election as a sign of his popularity and recognised Yudhoyono&#x27;s potential as a possible leader for Indonesia. One of these supporters, Vence Rumangkang approached Yudhoyono with the idea of forming a political party to help shore up support for the 2004 presidential elections. Yudhoyono approved of the idea and after going through the basic concepts, left Rumangkang in charge of forming the Party.

From 12 to 19 August 2001, Rumangkang began holding a series of meetings to discuss the formation of the party while holding consultations with Yudhoyono. Yudhoyono personally led the meetings on 19 and 20 August 2001, and the basic outline of the Democratic Party was finalised.

On 9 September 2001, the formation of the party was officially declared, and it was registered at the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights on 10 September.

The organizers behind Democratic Party&#x27;s formation went to extreme lengths to make sure that PD was Yudhoyono&#x27;s personal political party. The declaration of its formation was 9 September 2001, which was Yudhoyono&#x27;s birthday, and the Party originally had 99 members.

===Road to presidency===
The United Democratic Nationhood Party (PPDK) was the first to bring up the subject of nomination. In September 2003, Yudhoyono&#x27;s own party began to make preparations in case Yudhoyono was willing to accept a presidential nomination. The Democratic Party then initiated a publicity campaign to promote Yudhoyono as a candidate. For his part, Yudhoyono was not responsive to both PPDK and the Democratic Party&#x27;s manoeuvrings to nominate him and continued his duties as minister. PPDK was disappointed in Yudhoyono&#x27;s reaction, and the Democratic Party continued to wait for Yudhoyono to resign his position, as was expected of all presidential candidates apart from the incumbent president and vice president.

The turning point came on 1 March 2004, when Yudhoyono&#x27;s secretary, Sudi Silalahi announced to the media that for the last six months, Yudhoyono had been excluded from policy decision-making in the field of politics and security. On 2 March 2004, Megawati responded that she had never excluded Yudhoyono, while her husband, Taufiq Kiemas called Yudhoyono childish for complaining to the media instead of the president herself. On 8 March 2004, Yudhoyono sent a letter asking for permission to meet the president about his ministerial authority. Megawati did not respond when she received the letter, although she invited Yudhoyono along to a cabinet meeting on 11 March 2004. Yudhoyono did not attend the cabinet meeting and instead held a press conference at his office and announced his resignation from the position of coordinating minister of political and security affairs. He also announced that he was ready to be nominated as a presidential candidate.

Yudhoyono&#x27;s popularity skyrocketed after his falling out with Megawati as he was seen by the people as the underdog. However this popularity did not translate to a victory for the Democratic Party at the 2004 legislative elections. The party won 7.5% of the votes, which was still enough to nominate Yudhoyono as a presidential candidate. Yudhoyono accepted the nomination and picked Golkar&#x27;s Jusuf Kalla as his running mate. Aside from the Democratic Party, their presidential and vice-presidential candidacy was supported by the Crescent Star Party (PBB), the Reform Star Party (PBR) and the Indonesian Justice and Unity Party (PKPI).
Yudhoyono&#x27;s manifesto for the future of Indonesia, summarised in a book titled &quot;Vision For Change&quot; written by him and distributed for free during the campaign, was built on four pillars: prosperity, peace, justice and democracy. At the top of his agenda was a plan for increasing economic prosperity, aiming for economic growth of at least 7% and a revival of small and medium-sized enterprises. He also put forward policies to offer better credit lines, to cut red tape, improve labour laws and to root out corruption from the top down. He told an interviewer:

Yudhoyono&#x27;s perceived communication skills made him the front-runner throughout the election campaign, according to many opinion polls and the opinions of election commentators, ahead of the other candidates (Megawati, Wiranto, Amien Rais, and Hamzah). On 5 July 2004, Yudhoyono participated in the first round of the presidential election, coming first with 33% of the votes. However, 50% of votes were required for a new president and vice president to be elected, and this meant Yudhoyono going into a run-off against Megawati.

In the run-off, Yudhoyono faced a challenge from Megawati&#x27;s Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle (PDI-P), forming a national coalition with Golkar, the PPP, Prosperous Peace Party (PDS) and the Indonesian National Party (PNI). Yudhoyono then declared that his coalition, which now received political support from the National Awakening Party (PKB), the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) and the National Mandate Party (PAN), would be the people&#x27;s coalition. On 20 September 2004, Yudhoyono participated in the run-off election, winning it with 60.87% of the vote. Yudhoyono was inaugurated as president on 20 October 2004. In February 2010, SBY was named as the political figure who had achieved by the influential Public Affairs Asia network and magazine.

==Presidency (2004–2014)==

===Government and cabinets===
Presidential elections were held in Indonesia on 8 July 2009. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono won more than 60% (60.08%) of the vote in the first round, which enabled him to secure re-election without a run-off. Yudhoyono was officially declared the victor of the election on 23 July 2009, by the General Election Commission. Other candidates are Megawati Sukarnoputri PDI-P Party 26.79%, Jusuf Kalla Golkar Party 12.41%.
The day of his inauguration in 2004, Yudhoyono announced his new cabinet, which would be known as the United Indonesia Cabinet (&quot;Kabinet Indonesia Bersatu&quot;). Consisting of 36 ministers, it included members of the Democratic Party, Golkar and the PPP, PBB, PKB, PAN, PKP, and PKS. Professionals were also named in the cabinet, most of them taking on ministries in the economic field. The military were also included, with five former members appointed to the cabinet. As Yudhoyono&#x27;s promised during the election, four of the cabinet appointees were female. Yudhoyono&#x27;s Second United Indonesia Cabinet was announced in October 2009 after he was re-elected as president earlier in the year. The vice president in Yudhoyono&#x27;s second cabinet was Boediono. Boediono replaced Jusuf Kalla who was vice president in the first Yudhoyono cabinet.

===Balance of power with Kalla===
Although he had won the presidency, Yudhoyono was still weak in the Indonesian parliament, the House of Representatives (DPR). The Democratic Party, even combined with all of its coalition partners, had far fewer representatives than Golkar and the PDI-P, which played the role of opposition.

With a national congress to be held in December 2004, Yudhoyono and Kalla had originally backed Agung Laksono speaker to become Golkar chairman. When Agung was perceived to be too weak to run against Akbar Tandjung, Yudhoyono and Kalla threw their weight behind Surya Paloh. Finally, when Paloh was perceived to be too weak to run against Akbar, Yudhoyono gave the green light for Kalla to run for the Golkar Chairmanship. On 19 December 2004, Kalla was elected as the new chairman of Golkar.

Kalla&#x27;s victory posed a dilemma for Yudhoyono. Although it now enabled Yudhoyono to pass legislation, Kalla&#x27;s new position meant that he was now more powerful than Yudhoyono in terms of influence in parliament.

After the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami Kalla, apparently on his own initiative, assembled Ministers and signed a vice-presidential decree ordering work to begin on rehabilitating Aceh. The legality of his vice-presidential decree was questioned although Yudhoyono maintained that it was he who gave the orders for Kalla to proceed.

In September 2005, when Yudhoyono went to New York City to attend the annual United Nations Summit, he left Vice President Kalla in charge. Yudhoyono held a video conference from New York to receive reports from ministers. Critics suggest that this was an expression of distrust by Yudhoyono. The suggestion seemed to gain momentum when Kalla only showed up for one video conference and then spent the rest of the time taking care of Golkar matters.

To defuse political tensions in the country with the increase in fuel prices, a number of national figures met including former presidents Abdurahman Wahid and Megawati Sukarnoputri to defuse the atmosphere.

President Yudhoyono sent Vice President Jusuf Kalla to meet with these national figures. After previously keeping in touch with Megawati, Kalla also held a meeting with former President KH Abdurrahman Wahid (Gus Dur). The arrival of Kalla at Gus Dur&#x27;s residence Jl. Warung Silah Ciganjur, Jakarta, was greeted directly by Yenny Wahid on the terrace of the house. Kalla, wearing a long-sleeved batik shirt, immediately entered the living room where Gus Dur had been sitting waiting. After shaking hands and hugging each other, Kalla sat on the left side of Gus Dur in a long chair with Mrs. Mufidah. Meanwhile, Mrs. Sinta Nuriyah sat beside Yenny Wahid. The conversation was immediately warm, punctuated by Gus Dur&#x27;s typical jokes.

Kalla in particular came to the residence of Megawati on Jl Teuku Umar Jakarta, for a friendly and halal bi halal 1428 H. Kalla was welcomed by Megawati Soekarnoputri along with Taufiq Kiemas and his daughter Puan Maharani. After shaking hands with Kalla, Megawati went inside a few moments later. For a few minutes, it turned out that Megawati came back into the living room and met with Kalla and Mufidah&#x27;s mother, who were sitting side by side with Puan Maharani. On that occasion the two leaders had a casual chat. Megawati had time to talk about food. Meanwhile, the Vice President responded intimately, resulting in very warm communication. The gathering of about 15 minutes gave the impression that there was never any difference between the two leaders.

===Dealings with Suharto===
On 6 May 2005, Yudhoyono visited Suharto at hospital when the latter suffered from intestinal bleeding. On 5 January 2007, Yudhoyono and his wife visited Suharto, who was again hospitalised due to anaemia as well as heart and kidney problems. After the visit, Yudhoyono made an appeal to all Indonesians to pray for Suharto&#x27;s recovery.

Responding to some public requests for Suharto to be granted a pardon for possible past mistakes in governing Indonesia, presidential spokesperson Andi Mallarangeng said, &quot;A visit from an incumbent president to a hospitalized former president is something normal. However, this show of humanity and legal steps are two different things.&quot;

===Foreign policy===
President Yudhoyono&#x27;s foreign policy sought to create new breakthroughs for the strategic development of Indonesia&#x27;s defense, namely ending the US military embargo, which was aided by support from Washington. The Bush administration claimed that ending the arms embargo and modernizing the Indonesian Defence Force will help Jakarta address mutual security concerns such as terrorism, maritime piracy, narcotics trafficking, pandemic disease, and disaster relief. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns said that Indonesia, as &quot;the world&#x27;s largest Muslim state and its third-largest democracy, is a voice of moderation in the Islamic world and plays a unique strategic role in Southeast Asia&quot;.

In February 2005, the US government reinstated Indonesia&#x27;s eligibility for the International Military Education and Training program in order to upgrade the quality of its officer corps. In May 2005, it removed restrictions on nonlethal defense equipment such as communications and transport systems. This lifted the last remaining barrier, a ban on sale of lethal weaponry and related equipment. Still recovering from the Asian financial crisis, the Indonesian government lacked the funds to purchase new armaments but took advantage of the new rules to purchase spare parts for its aging fleet of 10 U.S.-supplied F-16 fighters. Invoking these accomplishments at the APEC conference, Yudhoyono argued that Indonesia had proven itself worthy of resumed military engagement with the United States. While there, he also spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin about further defense cooperation with Moscow following the 2003 purchase of four Sukhoi warplanes and two MI-35 assault helicopters. In addition to its dealings with the United States and Russia, Yudhoyono considered purchasing weapons from other potential suppliers, which included several European Union countries, South Korea, India, and China.

===Economic policy===
In a meeting with regional heads, President Yudhoyono outlined some of the government&#x27;s achievements in the economic field

He indicated that GDP and foreign exchange reserves had increased significantly and the ratio of debt to gross domestic product could be reduced from 56 percent to 23 percent. President Yudhoyono added that the debt ratio of 23 percent to GDP wasfar below developed countries such as Germany (86.1 percent), United States (104.1 percent), and United Kingdom ( 107 percent). He said, during the 2004-2014 period, domestic and foreign debt could also be reduced while the state budget was increased fourfold. In 2004, the country&#x27;s per capita income was recorded at US$1188 but ten years later it rose to US$3490. Indonesia is also recorded as a country with the second highest economic growth rate since 2009 after China with the country&#x27;s exports increasing threefold. In the energy sector, Yudhoyono acknowledged, although electricity capacity increased twice during his administration, it remained small. Yudhoyono gave the example of the Master Plan for the Acceleration of Indonesian Economic Development (MP3EI), which from 2011 to 2013, reached a value of IDR 828.7 trillion.

Yudhoyono was also able to initiate the disbanding of the Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI) because he wanted Indonesia to be more independent and less dependent on many parties. President Yudhoyono said

Established in 1992, the CGI was a consortium of countries and institutions providing loans to Indonesia, set up by the Indonesian government and the World Bank. Its membership was made up of 30 bilateral and multilateral creditors, including the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund and industrialized countries such as Japan and the United States, as well as many other smaller countries and many other world financial and aid institutions. In 2006 the Consultative Group on Indonesia pledged $5.4 billion in fresh loans and grants for Indonesia. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani said the Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI) was no longer needed as the country&#x27;s primary creditors were only the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Japan, and that Indonesia now preferred one-on-one negotiations rather than round table, multilateral ones. She said the dissolution of the CGI was also of benefit to Indonesia as it freed the government of the need to explain its intentions and plans to many different parties. Iman Sugema, director of the International Center for Applied Finance and Economics (Inter-CAFE) at the Bogor Institute of Agriculture (IPB), applauded the president&#x27;s plan to dissolve the CGI and said the CGI had not benefited Indonesia because the donor countries often put too many demands on the nation.

===Social protection and education===

The Yudhoyono government enacted Law Number 24 of 2011 concerning the Social Security Administering Body. The law is a government initiative to improve people&#x27;s welfare through the health and employment insurance system. According to the Coordinating Minister for People&#x27;s Welfare, Agung Laksono, &quot;Private insurance companies need not worry about the implementation of Law concerning the Social Security Administering Body (BPJS), there will still be middle to upper income groups who need their services,&quot; the law calls for the establishment of a Social Security System which will be operated by an institution that will be formed by combining two state-owned companies, namely PT Jamsostek which provides workers&#x27; social security BPJS Ketenagakerjaan and PT Askes which is engaged in health insurance BPJS Kesehatan. The merger of the two companies was expected to occur before 1 January 2014. Meanwhile, according to Suryo Bambang Sulisto, Chairman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin), &quot;Indonesian entrepreneurs accepted the law as something positive and Kadin members were ready to apply it in their companies.&quot;

In the field of education, Yudhoyono has implemented a number of programs to improve the development of Indonesian human resources, including the (BOS) program which was established in July 2005. Under this arrangement, the government provides money to school principals to help finance the running of schools. BOS is expected to provide significant financial assistance to schools, schools are expected to reduce fees or if they are able, eliminate fees altogether, in addition in June 2006, Yudhoyono launched &quot;BOS Buku&quot; which provides funds for the purchase of textbooks. In 2011, he founded LPDP, a social institution that provides scholarships for Indonesian children who want to continue their higher education at home and abroad.
He also founded the Indonesian Defense University, a higher education institution that specifically studies military and defense strategy studies and near the institution was founded the (IPSC) an institution that specifically educates Indonesian peacekeeping troops for the UN, which he initiated because he was once a UN peacekeeping force.

===Other activities===
On 17 August 2007, Yudhoyono proposed that eight nations that were home to some 80% of the world&#x27;s tropical rainforests join diplomatic ranks amid increasing concern over global warming. Indonesia led a summit of eight countries (on 24 September in New York) – Brazil, Cameroon, Congo, Costa Rica, Gabon, Indonesia, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea. On 3–15 December 2007, Indonesia hosted the 13th Conferences of the Parties (COP-13) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Bali.

During the Pope Benedict XVI Islam controversy, Yudhoyono stated that the Pope&#x27;s comments were &quot;unwise and inappropriate,&quot; but also that &quot;Indonesian Muslims should have wisdom, patience, and self-restraint to address this sensitive issue...We need them so that harmony among people is not at stake.&quot;

Yudhoyono was one of the 100 World&#x27;s Most Influential People in 2009 according to TIME Magazine.

During an official visit to Australia on 9–11 March 2010, he was appointed an Honorary Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) and addressed Australian Parliament, the first Indonesian head of state to do so.

Yudhoyono was made an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) by HM Queen Elizabeth II on 30 October 2012.

===Assassination plot===
Indonesian security forces claimed to have uncovered a plot to murder Yudhoyono, which was set on Indonesian Independence Day on 17 August 2010.

===Political party===
During his presidency, Yudhoyono further consolidated his position within the Democratic Party. In May 2005, at PD&#x27;s first National Congress, Yudhoyono was elected chairman of the executive board (&quot;Ketua Dewan Pembina)&quot;. In this position, Yudhoyono had the highest authority, superseding that of chairman.

===2014 general election===
On 27 December 2012, the daily edition of &quot;The Jakarta Post&quot; hinted at a possible collaboration in Indonesia&#x27;s 2014 general election between the families of Yudhoyono and former Indonesian President Megawati and their political parties, the Democratic Party and the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle respectively. The Constitution of Indonesia limits presidents to two terms of office, making Yudhoyono ineligible to run for a third term.

==Post-presidency==

After his terms as president ended, Yudhoyono remained active in politics, being re-elected as leader of his party in 2015. In the 2019 presidential election, he supported Prabowo Subianto&#x27;s second bid for presidency. Yudhoyono was replaced by his son Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono as the leader of the Democratic Party on 15 March 2020.

After 10 years of his presidency ended on 20 October 2014, SBY was elected as President of the Assembly and Chair of the Council of the Global Green Growth Institute for the period September 2014 to December 2016. SBY succeeded Danish Prime Minister (from 2009 to 2011 and since June 2015) Lars Løkke Rasmussen, the previous GGGI Council chair.

He continued to live with his wife Ani until her death on 1 June 2019. In November 2021, it was announced Yudhoyono was diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer.

In the 2024 presidential election, he initially backed Anies Baswedan and had a meeting with him in his private library to give campaign advice. But then, he withdraw his support after Anies picked Muhaimin Iskandar as his running mate without any consultation with the Democratic Party, calling out Anies and NasDem Party as dishonest. He then choose to back Prabowo by stating his readiness and comfort to join him in his campaign on 18 September 2023, confirming his endorsement on 20 November 2023. Prabowo stated that Yudhoyono had given him a great morale boost and trust, even expressing his astonishment when Yudhoyono decided to show up on his final rally in Gelora Bung Karno Stadium on foot, walking for 7 km.

<doc id="771463" wikidata="Q577125" url="?curid=771463" title="Leander of Seville">
<text>Leander of Seville (; ; 534 AD, in Cartagena – 13 March 600 or 601, in Seville) was a Hispano-Roman Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of Seville. He was instrumental in effecting the conversion of the Visigothic kings Hermenegild and Reccared to Chalcedonian Christianity. His brother (and successor as bishop) was the encyclopedist Isidore of Seville. 

==Life==
Leander, Isidore and their siblings belonged to an elite family of Hispano-Roman stock of Carthago Spartaria (Cartagena). Their father Severianus is claimed to have been a or governor of Carthago Spartaria, according to their hagiographers, though this seems more of a fanciful interpretation since Isidore simply states that he was a citizen. The family as a matter of course were staunch Chalcedonians, as were most of the Romanized population; the Visigothic nobles and the kings were Arians.

The family moved to Seville around 554. The children&#x27;s subsequent public careers reflect their distinguished origin: Leander and Isidore both became bishops of Hispalis (Seville), and their sister Florentina was an abbess who directed forty convents and one thousand nuns. The third brother, Fulgentius, was appointed Bishop of Astigi (Ecjia). All four siblings are considered saints of the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches.

The Chalcedonian hierarchy were in contact with representatives of the Eastern Roman or Byzantine emperor, who had maintained a considerable territory in the far south of Hispania ever since his predecessor had been invited to the peninsula by king Athanagild several decades before. In the north, Liuvigild struggled to maintain his possessions on the far side of the Pyrenees, where his Merovingian cousins and brothers-in-law cast envious eyes on them.

Leander, enjoying an elite position in the secure surroundings of tolerated Chalcedonian Christian culture in Seville, became, around 576, a Benedictine monk, and then in 579 he was appointed bishop of Seville. In the meantime he founded a celebrated school, which soon became a center of Chacedonian Christian learning. As bishop he had access to the Chalcedonian Merovingian princess Ingunthis, who had come as a bride for the kingdom&#x27;s heir, and he assisted her to convert her husband Hermenegild, the eldest son of Liuvigild, an act that cannot honestly be divorced from a political context. Leander defended the new convert even when he went to war with his father &quot;against his father&#x27;s cruel reprisals&quot;. Pierre Suau puts it, &quot;In endeavoring to save his country from Arianism, Leander showed himself an orthodox Christian and a far-sighted patriot.&quot;

Exiled by Liuvigild, as his biographies express it, when the rebellion failed, he withdrew to Byzantium – perhaps quite hastily – from 579 to 582. It is possible, but not proven, that he sought to rouse the Byzantine Emperor Tiberius II Constantine to take up arms against the Arian king; but in any case the attempt was without result. He profited, however, by his stay at Byzantium to compose works against Arianism, and there became acquainted with the future Pope Gregory the Great, at that time legate of Pope Pelagius II at the Byzantine court (Later Gregory sent him a copy of &quot;Pastoral Care)&quot;. A close friendship thenceforth united the two men, and some of their correspondence survives. In 585 Liuvigild put to death his intransigent son Hermenegild, a martyr and saint of the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches. Liuvigild himself died in 589. It is not known exactly when Leander returned from exile, but he had a share in the conversion of Reccared the heir of Liuvigild, and retained an influence over him.

Leander introduced the recitation of the Nicene Creed at Mass, as a way to help reinforce the faith of his people against Arianism. In 589, he convoked the Third Council of Toledo, where Visigothic Hispania abjured Arianism. Leander delivered the triumphant closing sermon which his brother Isidore entitled (&quot;a homily upon the triumph of the Church and the conversion of the Goths&quot;). On his return from this council, Leander convened a synod in his metropolitan city of Seville (Conc. Hisp., I), and never afterwards ceased his efforts to consolidate the work of extirpating the remains of Arianism, in which his brother and successor St. Isidore was to follow him.

==Works==
Only two works remain of this writer: (a monastic rule composed for his sister) and (P.L, LXXII). St. Isidore wrote of his brother: &quot;This man of suave eloquence and eminent talent shone as brightly by his virtues as by his doctrine. By his faith and zeal the Gothic people have been converted from Arianism to the Catholic faith&quot; (&quot;De script. eccles.&quot;, xxviii).

==Legacy==
The city of San Leandro in the US state of California is named after St. Leander. His supposed likeness and crosier is depicted on the crest of Sevilla Fútbol Club.

The Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches recognise feast days for Leander on both 27 February and 13 March for observance in particular circumstances. In the Spanish national liturgical calendar, the feast day is commemorated on 13 November.

<doc id="771465" wikidata="Q3043208" url="?curid=771465" title="Ostensive definition">
<text>An ostensive definition conveys the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. This type of definition is often used where the term is difficult to define verbally, either because the words will not be understood (as with children and new speakers of a language) or because of the nature of the term (such as colors or sensations). It is usually accompanied with a gesture pointing to the object serving as an example, and for this reason is also often referred to as &quot;&quot;.

==Overview==
An ostensive definition assumes the questioner has sufficient understanding to recognize the type of information being given. Ludwig Wittgenstein writes:
So one might say: the ostensive definition explains the use—the meaning—of the word when the overall role of the word in language is clear. Thus if I know that someone means to explain a colour-word to me the ostensive definition &quot;That is called &#x27;sepia&#x27; &quot; will help me to understand the word... One has already to know (or be able to do) something in order to be capable of asking a thing&#x27;s name. But what does one have to know?
The limitations of ostensive definition are exploited in a famous argument from Wittgenstein’s &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; (which deal primarily with the philosophy of language), the private language argument, in which he asks if it is possible to have a private language that no one else can understand.

John Passmore states that the term was first defined by the British logician William Ernest Johnson (1858–1931):

&quot;His neologisms, as rarely happens, have won wide acceptance: such phrases as &quot;ostensive definition&quot;, such contrasts as those between ... &quot;determinates&quot; and &quot;determinables&quot;, &quot;continuants&quot; and &quot;occurrents&quot;, are now familiar in philosophical literature&quot; (Passmore 1966, p. 344).

<doc id="771466" wikidata="Q2834192" url="?curid=771466" title="Dark Funeral">
<text>Dark Funeral is a Swedish black metal band from Stockholm, founded by guitarists Blackmoon and Lord Ahriman in 1993. They emerged during the second wave of black metal.

Their lyrical themes have traditionally pertained to Satanism and anti-Christianity. Certain past and present members including Blackmoon, Ahriman, Caligula, and Chaq Mol have each declared an affinity for Satanism, with Ahriman and Caligula notably being practitioners of LaVeyan Satanism. In their earlier years, their lyrical themes usually revolved specifically around depictions of Hell and Satan. After Emperor Magus Caligula joined the band, their lyrics came to focus more on blasphemy and anti-Christian rhetoric, although there have been several exceptions to this.

The group have released seven full-length albums and are one of the most prominent acts in the Swedish black metal scene.

== History ==
===&quot;Dark Funeral EP&quot; and &quot;The Secrets of the Black Arts&quot; ===
In 1993, guitarists David Parland, also known as Blackmoon, and Mikael Svanberg, also known as Lord Ahriman, established Dark Funeral, recruiting Paul Mäkitalo, also known as Themgoroth, formerly of the band Scum, as bassist and vocalist, and Joel Andersson, also known as Draugen, shortly thereafter. In January 1994, Dark Funeral recorded their self-titled EP at Unisound Studio with Dan Swanö of Edge of Sanity fame as producer, subsequently being released on 4 May, 1994. That same day, Dark Funeral performed their first gig at Lusa Lottes Pub in Oslo, Norway, alongside bands such as fellow live debutees Gorgoroth, and Marduk, who were also performing their first show abroad. Draugen departed Dark Funeral following the EP&#x27;s recording, being replaced by Equimanthorn.

In 1995, Dark Funeral signed with No Fashion Records, subsequently composing songs in anticipation for their debut full-length album. Initially, the band recorded several tracks that would appear on &quot;The Secrets of the Black Arts&quot; at said Unisound Studio with Swanö as producer, but opted to re-record the album with Peter Tägtgren of Hypocrisy fame at The Abyss Studio, composing a further track, &quot;When Angels Forever Die&quot;, and incorporating a cover of Von&#x27;s &quot;Satanic Blood&quot;, for their debut album. Concerning the band&#x27;s decision to re-record their debut album, within a 2009 interview with &quot;Rites of the Black Moon Webzine&quot;, Blackmoon elaborated that the initial recordings at Unisound Studio suffered from a sonic flatness, partly due to Swanö&#x27;s exhaustion and to the quality of new recording gear that Swanö had recently acquired. Shortly after recording their album at The Abyss, Dark Funeral played their first festival gig, Under the Black Sun I, in Berlin. A few weeks prior to this gig Emperor Magus Caligula (Magnus &#x27;Masse&#x27; Broberg, the original vocalist of Hypocrisy) replaced Themgoroth, becoming a permanent member during the summer of 1995. Concerning the factors underlying Themgoroth&#x27;s departure, Blackmoon elucidated that Themgoroth was unable to fulfil the quality the band expected within their live performances. On 28 January 1996, &quot;The Secrets of the Black Arts&quot; was released, with the album thence being licensed to Metal Blade in North America and Mystic Productions in Poland. Equimanthorn was soon replaced by Alzazmon, later known for his work with Dissection and Gorgoroth. The line-up of Emperor Magus Caligula, Lord Ahriman, Alzazmon and Blackmoon recorded their versions of Bathory&#x27;s &quot;Call from the Grave&quot; and &quot;Equimanthorn&quot; for the Bathory tribute &quot;In Conspiracy with Satan&quot;. (These also appeared later re-mastered for the re-titled re-release of the band&#x27;s debut &quot;In the Sign…&quot;). Blackmoon departed Dark Funeral at the end of 1996, citing conflict with Lord Ahriman as the primary instigator for his decision to depart. Together with Necromass, the band thence embarked on the Satanic War Tour I throughout Europe.

=== &quot;Vobiscum Satanas&quot; and &quot;Teach Children to Worship Satan&quot;===
The second leg of the Satanic War Tour followed with Ancient and Bal-Sagoth as support. Dark Funeral played their first show in America at the Expo of the Extreme festival in Chicago. From there, the band embarked on &quot;The American Satanic Crusade Tour&quot; with Usurper in support. Originally, the tour was supposed to also feature Acheron and Deströyer 666, but both bands cancelled. In September, the band returned to The Abyss Studio to record what would become &quot;Vobiscum Satanas&quot;.

The Ineffable Kings of Darkness Tour with Enthroned and Liar of Golgotha took place with Dominion joining the band as a session bass player. The band also made their second major festival appearance at the Swedish Hultsfreds festival. After the festival, Typhos was fired and Dominion, who originally was a guitarist, was taken on as the band&#x27;s second guitarist, and Caligula reverted to doing both vocals and bass.

Before the band headed out on the &quot;Bleed for Satan&quot; tour with Cannibal Corpse and Infernäl Mäjesty, Alzazmon left, and the band&#x27;s longtime friend Gaahnfaust, who was also in the band back in 1996 for a short time, was recruited. The band returned overseas for another mini-tour, &quot;Black Plague Across the West&quot;, when they played in Mexico for the first time before they headed to the US and the state of California. Afterwards, they also embarked on their longest and most successful European tour, &quot;The Satanic Inquisition&quot;, together with Dimmu Borgir.

With engineer Tommy Tägtgren, the band recorded the EP &quot;Teach Children to Worship Satan&quot; at The Abyss Studio B (featuring the new song &quot;An Apprentice of Satan&quot; and cover-versions of Slayer, Mayhem, Sodom and King Diamond). For the EP, the band also filmed a live video for &quot;An Apprentice of Satan&quot;. They joined Deicide, Immortal, and Cannibal Corpse for the No Mercy Festivals. After the departure of Gaahnfaust, Matte Modin (Defleshed) joined the band as a permanent member and made his debut at the With Full Force festival.

=== &quot;Diabolis Interium&quot; and &quot;De Profundis Clamavi Ad Te Domine&quot; ===
In January/February, the band again entered The Abyss Studio, enlisting the help of producer Peter Tägtgren and studio technician Lars Szöke, to record their third full-length album, &quot;Diabolis Interium&quot;. Due to the overwhelming positive response to the new album from both the public and the press, the band was able to secure deals that brought their music across to a much wider audience, with licenses in Japan (Soundholic Co. Ltd), Brazil (Hellion Records), Poland (Mystic Productions), Romania (Rocris Disc), Bulgaria (Rocris Disc), Thailand (S.Stack Co. Ltd), Russia (Irond Records Ltd), Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China (Magnus Music). With the exceptional response to the album in Brazil, which was released through Hellion Records, another local label, Somber Records licensed the band&#x27;s entire back catalogue. As soon as &quot;Diabolis Interium&quot; was released, Dark Funeral once again went on tour. First they toured Europe, supported by Tidfall, Anorexia Nervosa and Ragnarok. On this tour, the band brought in Mikael Hedlund (Hypocrisy) to play the bass. After this tour, Mikael resumed duties with his main band. They recruited Richard Cabeza for the session bassist slot. The band also toured the US, supporting their longtime friends Cannibal Corpse. With &quot;Diabolis Interium&quot;, the Swedish radio station Rocket 95.3 FM nominated Dark Funeral in the category “Best Swedish Hard Rock Band”. Other bands nominated at the same time and in the same category were Breach, Entombed, and Arise.

In October 2002, the band embarked on their first tour in the Far East, which included shows in Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore. The band was the first Western extreme metal band to play Taiwan and Singapore. On 29 November 2002, the band and MNW/No Fashion Records announced that they were no longer contractually-bound to Necropolis Records, who had licensed the band&#x27;s 2001 release &quot;Diabolis Interium&quot; for North America. Official termination of contract papers had already been delivered to Necropolis Records, putting an official end to Dark Funeral&#x27;s tenure with said record label. This was a result of Necropolis&#x27; alleged breach of contract with the band and label.

After the Asian tour, guitarist Dominion felt it was in the best interests of both the band and himself to resign his position, due to commitment to studies. Dominion officially resigned upon the band&#x27;s completion of their Asian tour. He would later explore other musical options. After this the band begin auditioning guitarists to replace the departed Dominion. A new guitarist was found in the form of Chaq Mol, who had a long history in different local metal acts. He is also in the two-man doom/black metal project Mordichrist. He made his official debut with the band at Wacken Open Air 2003.

After a successful gig at the Wacken Open Air Festival in Germany, the band headed down to South America for a tour through Brazil, Chile, and Colombia. This tour became one of the most successful ever undertaken by the band. During the tour, the band recorded a couple of the shows with plans to release a live album. After sifting through the recorded material with their live sound engineer (Erik Lidbom, Hitfire Productions), &quot;De Profundis Clamavi Ad Te Domine&quot; was born.

Dark Funeral officially announced their split from MNW/No Fashion Records, after the band did not receive royalties for their back-catalogue. A series of legal battles began, where Ahriman and Caligula sought the rights to Dark Funeral&#x27;s back-catalogue. Shortly after, the band signed a license deal with Regain Records for their live album &quot;De Profundis Clamavi Ad Te Domine&quot;, which was licensed to several other countries. On 31 May 2005, the album was released in the US through Candlelight Records.

In January 2004, the band partnered with Goatwhore and Zyklon in Japan on the Extreme the Dojo Volume 9. Shortly after, the band continued to tour with a spate of Mexican dates. The band made appearances at festivals including Spain&#x27;s Piorno Rock (with Sepultura, Saxon, Destruction, Lacuna Coil, among others), Finland&#x27;s Tuska Open Air Metal Festival, and X-Mass Festivals across Europe. The band appeared as the headlining act at Germany&#x27;s Party San, Swedish Nordic Rage, and LA&#x27;s Gathering of the Bestial Legions Festival. The band also played in Italy together with Defleshed for a short burst of dates. In December 2004, Dark Funeral resumed touring by first playing Israel, and then hitting Russia and Ukraine for the Black Winter Days Tour, together with openers Horned NecroCannibals and Icewind Blast.

=== &quot;Attera Totus Sanctus&quot;, and &quot;Attera Orbis Terrarum Part I&quot; and &quot;II&quot; ===
On 20 January 2005, they signed a new record deal with Regain Records. The band concentrated on writing material for a new full-length album, yet made time to perform at the Metal Mind Festival in Poland, before joining the No Mercy Tour with Six Feet Under, Nile and Dying Fetus, among others.

On 18 August, Dark Funeral&#x27;s next album, &quot;Attera Totus Sanctus&quot;, was completed. It entered the Swedish top 40 at number 35. The new album became Album of The Month at Metallian.com. In November, Dark Funeral began working with Dragon Production, a division of A.S.S. Concert &amp; Promotion GmbH. Dragon Production were entrusted with handling the band&#x27;s tour bookings for Europe.

In 2006, Dark Funeral performed on a tour in South America. On 8 October 2006, at a concert in Lima, Peru, they were forced to perform without their vocalist and bassist, Caligula, due to illness. Many angry fans started a riot and vandalized the properties near the venue. Following the riot, all the band&#x27;s instruments were confiscated by Peruvian police. After a week, the band announced they had to postpone their upcoming concerts in Latvia and Lithuania because of this unfortunate situation.

In early 2007, Dark Funeral toured North America with Enslaved. In April 2007, the band had planned an Eastern European tour to Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic states. It was around this time that Matte Modin had allegedly concocted false stories in order to avoid playing with the band. He first alleged that he had an infection in his arm, and could not participate on the Eastern European tour. However, it emerged that he had chosen to tour with the punk band Raised Fist instead. After returning from the Metalferry show in Sweden in between, Matte announced to the rest of the band that he could not go to the Baltic states, as it was his son&#x27;s birthday. Dark Funeral soon realised Matte Modin&#x27;s motives. Consequently, the upcoming tour was cancelled, and Matte Modin was ejected from the band. In June 2007, the band announced Nils Fjellström, alias Dominator (also in Aeon and Sanctification, among others), as their new drummer. The band had a special appearance playing live on the pornographic film &quot;Club Satan: The Witches Sabbath&quot;, to which they also contributed their song &quot;King Antichrist&quot; off &quot;Attera Totus Sanctus&quot;.

The band toured North America again in 2007, and re-issued their first three albums, each with a bonus disc of material. In 2007 and 2008, the band released &quot;Attera Orbis Terrarum – Part I&quot; and &quot;Attera Orbis Terrarum – Part II&quot;, respectively.

On 24 October 2008, it was announced that the Supreme Court of Sweden had ruled in favour of Dark Funeral in the dispute with MNW/No Fashion Records.

=== &quot;Angelus Exuro pro Eternus&quot; ===
After several shows promoting the album, Dark Funeral released their fifth studio album in 2009, &quot;Angelus Exuro pro Eternus&quot;. They also shot a controversial music video for &quot;My Funeral&quot;.

The latter half of 2010 saw the band consisting of only Ahriman and Chaq Mol on guitars, following the departure of Emperor Magus Caligula in July 2010, and B-Force and Dominator in the coming months. Caligula&#x27;s was arguably the most significant: after being in Dark Funeral for fifteen years as vocalist and lyricist, he had spent the longest time in the band, aside from Ahriman. It was announced Caligula was to be married and that he sought to settle down in his new life. B-Force left the band of his own volition. Ahriman used this time to work on new material, in the absence of a full line-up for live performances and studio recording.

On 30 June 2011, Dark Funeral announced that Nachtgarm of Negator is the new vocalist. A week prior it had also been announced that Dominator returned to the band. On 27 July 2011, Zornheym was revealed to be the band&#x27;s new bassist, completing the lineup.

In late 2012, Dark Funeral parted ways with Nachtgarm, who returned to Negator. Zornheym exited the band in 2014.

=== &quot;Where Shadows Forever Reign&quot; ===
On 16 December 2014, Dark Funeral released a new track and music video entitled &quot;Nail Them to the Cross&quot;. The video revealed a new vocalist, Heljarmadr (Gra, Domgård, Cursed 13) and bassist Natt (Angrepp, Withershin) to the group&#x27;s ranks, although by the time the band started recording in February 2016 for their sixth album &quot;Where Shadows Forever Reign&quot;, which was released on 3 June by Century Media, Natt was no longer in the group, having Lord Ahriman record the bass for the album. In 2016, Gustaf Hielm, who played session bass on Attera Totus Sanctus, enrolled again as a session bass player, this time for concerts. In November 2017, it was announced that drummer Dominator has left the band and was replaced by Jalomaah.

=== &quot;We Are the Apocalypse&quot; ===
In May 2021, the band reported they were entering the studio to record their seventh studio album. The band completed recording the album in September 2021. In a Facebook post from November 2021, the band stated their seventh studio album will be entitled &quot;We Are the Apocalypse&quot; and is scheduled to be released on 18 March 2022.

<text>Kfar Tapuach (, &quot;lit.&quot;, Apple-village) is an Orthodox Jewish Israeli settlement in the West Bank, founded in 1978. It sits astride Tapuach Junction, one of the major traffic junctions in the West Bank. The executive director of the village council is Yisrael Blunder, and the chief rabbi is Shimon Rosenzwieg. In , it had a population of .

The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.

==History==
According to ARIJ, Kfar Tapuach was established in 1978 on land which Israel had confiscated from the Palestinian town of Yasuf.

==Demographics==
Although its population consists entirely of Jews, Kfar Tapuach is one of the more diverse Israeli settlements, with its population coming from a range of backgrounds. Founded by a core of Habbani Yemenite Jews from the moshav of Bareket, it has since absorbed Jewish immigrants from Russia and the United States, a large group of Peruvian converts to Judaism from Trujillo, Peru, and others. Between February 2004 and August 2009, over 90 new families moved to Kfar Tapuach.

==Public services==
The settlement includes four synagogues, two &quot;mikvaot&quot; (ritual baths) for women and men, a nursery school, and three kindergartens.

==Biblical Tappuah==
Kfar Tapuach is named after biblical Tapuach (Tappuah or Tapuah), which appears in the Bible in the Book of Joshua () as one of the first 31 cities conquered by Joshua Bin-Nun and the children of Israel.

== Kahanism ==
Kfar Tapuach is noted for its concentration of followers of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane.

<doc id="771477" wikidata="Q655629" url="?curid=771477" title="Subway to Sally">
<text>Subway to Sally is a German medieval metal band founded in Potsdam in the early 1990s. Their music has clear folk and medieval influences, later also adding gothic and metal elements. With their continuous inclusion of oriental sounds and elements of classical music and the use of instruments seldom seen in metal bands such as bagpipes, shawm, violin, hurdy-gurdy and lute, Subway to Sally has acquired the label of medieval metal. The band has released 12 studio albums, two live albums, and two live DVDs. Their fame is centered mainly in the German-speaking countries, having played only a handful of concerts outside of that area.

== History ==

The very first concert given by Subway to Sally was held in September 1990. The band then consisted of Ingo Hampf, Bodenski, Simon, Coni (trumpet) and Guido (drums). Their first appearance onstage was given in the Potsdamer &quot;Stube&quot; in January 1992, in the constellation with which they later recorded their first album (&quot;Album 1994&quot;). With the group deciding on needing a fiddle to complete the sound, they brought Frau Schmitt (Silke Volland) to the band, who in turn introduced them to Eric Fish (Erik Hecht) on bagpipes.

In their early years, Subway to Sally played Irish/Scottish-inspired folk rock, as reflected by the tracklist of their first album which was their only album where the majority of songs are in English. For these English lyrics they hired a friend. After this, the group decided that they wanted to keep their lyrics in German, thus becoming a part of the first wave of bands to do so after the Berlin Wall broke down. Their second album, released in 1995 and aptly named &quot;MCMXCV&quot;, saw a mixture of biblically-inspired lyrics and what is often referred to as medieval music. Three major changes can be noted with the release of &quot;MCMXCV&quot;: the appearance of German lyrics penned by Bodenski, Eric Fish moving up from the piper to being the frontman and main singer, and two translated folk songs, &quot;Krähenfraß&quot; (&quot;The two Corbies&quot;) and &quot;Carrickfergus&quot;, adapted to fit the band&#x27;s style.

Between 1994 and 1997, the band rapidly released four albums and toured Germany to exhaustion, with an average of around 100 concerts per year. Drummer T.W. left the band in 1997 after completing the recordings of &quot;Foppt den Dämon!&quot; and was replaced by David Pätsch for the tour and subsequent albums. &quot;Bannkreis&quot; was the first chart entry of the band. With &quot;Hochzeit&quot;, the band broke their habits and spent more time on album production, leading to a more polished sound. This paid off with another chart placement, as the album made it to number 19 in the official charts. The sound of &quot;Hochzeit&quot; is very much continued with the next studio album, &quot;Herzblut&quot;, though thematically moving in a different direction. Where &quot;Hochzeit&quot; is darker and ends on the note of &quot;Müde&quot; (&quot;Tired&quot;), &quot;Herzblut&quot; starts off with the energetic &quot;die Schlacht&quot; (&quot;the battle&quot;), declaring &quot;Ich gewinne diese Schlacht&quot; (&quot;I am winning this battle&quot;).

In 2003, the album &quot;Engelskrieger&quot; was released. In preparation of the release, the band made the lyrics available on their homepage, leading to wild discussions and accusations of &quot;selling out&quot;. The sound of the record, breaking clearly with their previous works, did nothing to silence those accusations. Subway to Sally had grown up, met up with the real world and made a deeply disturbing record, dealing with modern issues on modern terms. The song &quot;Wenn Engel hassen&quot; (&quot;When angels hate&quot;) from &quot;Herzblut&quot; can be said to explore the same terrain that &quot;Geist des Kriegers&quot; (&quot;Spirit/Ghost of the warrior&quot;) does, dealing with an individual running amok. Several band members have emphasized the impact of the September 11 attacks and the following political events as inspirational source for the album. Other songs deal with incest, euthanasia, leaders who mislead their people, and the general fall and corruption of Western society. &quot;Engelskrieger&quot; entered the German charts at number 9, and the band once more toured extensively. A live DVD was filmed in the Columbiahalle in Berlin on the first leg of the tour, leading to the release of a double DVD in the fall of 2003. In April 2004, Subway to Sally changed labels, leaving Universal (Motor) for the smaller metal label Nuclear Blast.

The band&#x27;s concert in Lindenpark on 30 December 2004 was drummer David Pätsch&#x27;s last show. Pätsch left the band to pursue another musical direction with the Blue Man Group in Berlin. Subway to Sally then spent half a year looking for a replacement before finally deciding on Simon Michael Schmitt to replace Pätsch. The recording of the new album was already finished by the time &quot;Tiny Simon&quot; joined the band.

Despite being very pleased with the outcome of &quot;Engelskrieger&quot;, the band made no secret of it being a one-off and a return to the more conventional &quot;Sally-Sound&quot; with the next studio recording. &quot;Nord Nord Ost&quot; was originally planned to be released in 2004 but was delayed until late 2005 due to the extensiveness of the production. Though the band have previously made use of musicians from outside the band, they now did so on a bigger scale, involving the Deutsches Filmorchester Babelsberg to create a wider and more orchestral sound. The album debuted at number 5 in the official charts, the highest chart placement the band has seen to date.

In 2006, the group released the CD/DVD &quot;Nackt&quot;, which was a live recording of acoustic versions of some of their songs.

On 19 October 2007, their album &quot;Bastard&quot; was released via Nuclear Blast Records. &quot;Bastard&quot; was recorded at Horus studio in Hanover, Germany, and Lundgaard studio in Denmark.

== Side projects ==
Several of the band members have side or solo projects going. Wanting to &quot;return to his roots&quot; as a musician, Eric Fish started touring on his own in 1999. This project has now grown up to become a band in its own right. Three CDs have been released; &quot;Auge in Auge&quot;, &quot;Zwilling&quot; and &quot;Gegen den Strom&quot;. Fish is also involved in an online-only project called &quot;Weiß&quot; and often appears as a guest musician for other bands such as Letzte Instanz and Fiddler&#x27;s Green. Bodenski has published a book of poems, called &quot;Inniglich&quot;, which draws heavily from his lyrics for Subway to Sally and also contains other works and non-published Sally songs. Along with his brother Chris and his sister Dodo Little, Simon also plays in the power metal band Silverlane which signed with Drakkar Entertainment in 2008. Frau Schmitt used to be a member of the somewhat &quot;folky-jazzy&quot; ensemble 17 Hippies.

<doc id="771479" wikidata="Q1074666" url="?curid=771479" title="Chiquita">
<text>Chiquita Brands International [[Société à responsabilité limitée|S.à.r.l.]] (), formerly known as [[United Fruit Company|United Fruit Co.]], is a Swiss-domiciled American producer and distributor of bananas and other produce. The company operates under subsidiary brand names, including the flagship Chiquita brand and Fresh Express salads. Chiquita is the leading distributor of bananas in the United States.

Chiquita is the successor to the United Fruit Company. It was formerly controlled by American businessman Carl Lindner Jr., whose majority ownership of the company ended when Chiquita Brands International exited a prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy on 19 March 2002. In 2003, the company acquired the German produce distribution company, Atlanta AG. Fresh Express salads was purchased from Performance Food Group in 2005. Chiquita&#x27;s former headquarters were located in Charlotte, North Carolina.

==History==


Chiquita Brands International&#x27;s history began in 1870, when ship&#x27;s captain Lorenzo Dow Baker purchased 160 bunches of bananas in Jamaica and resold them in Jersey City eleven days later. In 1873, Central American railroad developer Minor C. Keith began to experiment with banana production in Costa Rica. Later, he planted bananas alongside a Costa Rican railroad track to provide revenue for the railroad. In 1878, Baker partnered with Andrew Preston to form the Boston Fruit Company.

United Fruit Company was founded in 1899, when the Boston Fruit Company and various fruit exporting concerns controlled by Keith merged. In 1903, United Fruit Company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and became the first company to use refrigeration during open sea transport. In the same year, a US-funded railroad was built in Guatemala to benefit the company. During this period, United Fruit Company was known for its aggressive and exploitative practices in its operations in Central America. In 1913 the United Fruit Company created the Tropical Radio and Telegraph Company.

In 1928, workers went on strike in protest against poor pay and working conditions in the company plantations in Ciénaga (Colombia). The company lobbied the U.S. government to send troops to assist in repressing the outbreak; however, the Colombian government opted to quell the strike on its own, sending its own military forces into the town of Ciénaga, where the strikers had gathered, on 6 December. The repression resulted in the deaths of scores of plantation workers and their families. This episode is known in the history of Colombia as the Masacre de las Bananeras (Banana Massacre). 

United Fruit used emotionally charged advertising campaigns to gain support, like &quot;The Great White Fleet,&quot; a cruise liner that took American tourists to nations in Central and South America that United Fruit had invested in. Positive corporate image was fostered by commercials, which presented these destinations as exotic, fun excursions. Nevertheless, well planned tourist trips concealed the brutal and corrupt reality that existed on United Fruit&#x27;s plantations in Latin America. By 1930, the company&#x27;s fleet had grown to 95 ships.

In 1944, the company premiered the &quot;Chiquita Banana&quot; advertising jingle, which extolled the virtues of the fruit as well as when to eat them and how to store them. The song, which had an infectious calypso beat, began with the words &quot;I&#x27;m Chiquita Banana, and I&#x27;ve come to say.&quot; The brand name Chiquita was registered as a trademark in 1947.

In 1952, the government of Guatemala began expropriating unused United Fruit Company land to landless peasants. The company responded by intensively lobbying the U.S. government to intervene and mounting a misinformation campaign to portray the Guatemalan government as communist. In 1954, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency deposed the government of Guatemala, elected in 1950, and installed a pro-business military dictatorship.

By 1955, United Fruit Company was processing 2.7 billion pounds (1.2 billion kilograms) of fruit a year. In 1966, the company expanded into Europe. In 1966 United Fruit acquired J. Hungerford Smith Company, owner of A&amp;W Root Beer. Eli Black came in 1968 and was made chairman, president, and CEO. 

===United Brands===
In 1970, the company merged with AMK Corporation and changed its name to United Brands Company. AMK owned the meatpacker John Morrell &amp; Co.. Black took a controlling interest by outbidding two other conglomerates, Zapata Corporation and Textron. In 1971 United Brands formed a wholly owned subsidiary, A&amp;W Distributing Co., to retail A&amp;W Root Beer. 

After the suicide of Black in 1975, the company was acquired by Seymour Milstein and Paul Milstein. In 1980, Chiquita was an official sponsor of the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. In 1982, United Brands sold the A&amp;W Restaurants to A. Alfred Taubman. In 1983, United Brands sold A&amp;W Root Beer to a group of investors.

In 1984, Cincinnati investor Carl Lindner Jr. became the controlling investor in United Brands. In 1985, United Brands sold TRT (formerly Tropical Radio Telegraph) to UNC Resources.

===Chiquita Brands===

In 1990, the company renamed itself Chiquita Brands International, as it undertook major investments in Costa Rica. However, the company began to see a decline in Honduran operations during the first half of 1990. As a result, Chiquita initiated the &quot;Banana Wars&quot; with rival company Fyffes over the limited banana supply. Chiquita began illegally seizing and destroying Fyffes&#x27; shipments, as well as bribing judges to validate detention orders on Fyffes&#x27; ships. This culminated in the destruction of ten million dollars worth of produce. Fyffes manager Ernst Otto Stalinski alleged that Chiquita used a falsified arrest warrant in a kidnapping attempt, and he filed suit several times.

In 1993, the company was hit by European tariffs on the import of Latin American bananas. In 1994, some Chiquita farms were certified by the Rainforest Alliance&#x27;s Better Banana Project as being environmentally friendly. In 1995, the company sold the John Morrell meat business that was part of the original AMK Corporation. In 1998, the world&#x27;s largest banana processing facility debuted in Costa Rica. In 2001, the EU dismantled their banana import policy that favored European companies. This ended any ongoing banana disputes.

===Restructuring===
In November 2001, Chiquita filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in order to restructure the company. It emerged from the bankruptcy on 19 March 2002, ending Cincinnati businessman Carl H. Lindner Jr.&#x27;s control of the company. Also in 2002, Chiquita joined the Ethical Trading Initiative and was named as a top &quot;green stock&quot; by &quot;The Progressive Investor&quot;.

In 2003, Chiquita acquired the German produce distribution company, Atlanta AG. It also sold its processed foods division to Seneca Foods that year. In 2004, 100% of Chiquita farms were certified compliant with the SA8000 labor standard and the company earned the &quot;Corporate Citizen of the Americas Award&quot; from a Honduran charity. Fresh Express salads was purchased from Performance Food Group in 2005.

===Acquisition===
In March 2014, Chiquita Brands International and Fyffes announced that their boards of directors had unanimously approved a merger agreement. In the stock-for-stock transaction, former Chiquita shareholders would own approximately 50.7% of the new company, ChiquitaFyffes, while Fyffes shareholders would own 49.3% of the new company. The all-stock purchase was valued at US$526 million. The agreement would have created the largest banana company in the world with projected annual revenues of US$4.6 billion and have been domiciled in Ireland but be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Chiquita&#x27;s CEO Ed Lonergan would have served as Chairman and Fyffes Executive Chairman David McCann would have become the CEO of the proposed entity. Lonergan called this a &quot;milestone transaction&quot; and that &quot;the combined company will also be able to provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice;&quot; while McCann added that both companies would benefit from their &quot;joint expertise, complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business&quot;. According to Chiquita, the deal would &quot;provide substantial operational efficiencies and cost savings&quot;. Reuters reported that the merger would create tax advantages deriving from being based in Ireland, similar to those enjoyed by Perrigo following its takeover of the Irish company Élan. The deal was a corporate inversion, as the takeover company (Chiquita, United States), was to relocate its domicile to that of the purchased company (Fyffes, Ireland).

A $611 million takeover offer by Cutrale of Brazil and Safra group in August 2014, was rejected outright by Chiquita, with the company refusing to meet with the bidders to discuss the offer. Chiquita said it was pressing on with its merger with Fyffes. However, shortly after Chiquita shareholders rejected the Fyffes merger the Cutrale-Safra offer of $14.50 per share was accepted. Yet the North Carolina Economic Development board asserted that if the headquarters was moved away, the company would be due to return N.C. and local incentive money. Former Charlotte City Council member John Lassiter, who heads the board, said the new owners would inherit Chiquita&#x27;s responsibilities under a 2011 deal that brought the company to the city. The agreement stipulated that it received more than $23 million in incentives from Charlotte and Mecklenburg County for moving its headquarters and hundreds of high-paying jobs from Cincinnati and if it moved again within 10 years it must repay the &quot;clawback&quot; provision. Lassiter said of the matter: &quot;It’s not a question of opinion. It’s &#x27;What does the agreement say?’ I would expect both the city (of Charlotte) to impress its position (on the new owners) and for the (new ownership) to follow expectations under its provisions of the agreement.&quot;

==Operations==
Chiquita Brands International operates in 70 countries and employs approximately 20,000 people as of 2018. The company sells a variety of fresh produce, including bananas, ready-made salads, and health foods. The company&#x27;s Fresh Express brand has approximately $1 billion of annual sales and a 40% market share in the United States.

On 29 November 2011, the North Carolina Economic Investment Committee approved $22 million in incentives for Chiquita to move its headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina. The same day, Chiquita officially announced their move to the city, with the new headquarters residing in the NASCAR Plaza tower. Research and development was also moved to the Charlotte area. In addition to the incentives, the company cited the growing airport as a reason for the move. According to the company&#x27;s 2012 annual report, the company was aiming to &quot;transform [itself] into a high-volume, low-cost operator&quot; and to &quot;minimize investments outside of [its] core product offerings&quot;.

By 2019, the company&#x27;s main offices left the United States and relocated to Switzerland.
==Logo==
The company mascot &quot;Miss Chiquita&quot;, now Chiquita Banana, was created in 1944 by Dik Browne, who is best known for drawing the popular comic strips &quot;Hi and Lois&quot; and &quot;Hägar the Horrible&quot;. Miss Chiquita started as an animated banana with a woman&#x27;s dress and legs in the manner of Carmen Miranda. Vocalist Patti Clayton was the original 1944 voice of Miss Chiquita, followed by Elsa Miranda, June Valli and Monica Lewis. Advertisements featured the trademark banana character wearing a fruit hat. The banana with a fruit hat was changed into a woman in 1987. A new Miss Chiquita design was unveiled in 1998. Peel-off stickers with the logo started being placed on bananas in 1963. They are still placed by hand today to avoid bruising the fruit.

A commercial in 1947, with a theme song in English ended with the lyrics &quot;si, si&quot; emphasizing for consumers the origin of the bananas as Latin America. Another commercial featured a man of Latin descent with exaggerated stereotypical features. As times changed throughout the 1960s, so did the iconography and publications of Chiquita and their produce, of bananas.

== Criticism ==

===Monopolistic practices===

In 1976, the European Commission held that United Brands had been abusing a dominant market position, contrary to Article 86 of the EEC Treaty; in particular, by imposing unfair conditions on its customers, by refusing to supply certain customers, and by charging dissimilar prices for equivalent transactions. In 1978, the commission&#x27;s decision was upheld by the European Court of Justice.

===&quot;Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; charges===
On 3 May 1998, &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; published an eighteen-page section, &quot;Chiquita Secrets Revealed&quot; by investigative reporters Michael Gallagher and Cameron McWhirter. The section accused the company of mistreating workers on its Central American plantations, polluting the environment, allowing cocaine to be brought to Borneo on its ships, bribing foreign officials, evading foreign nations&#x27; laws on land ownership, forcibly preventing its workers from unionizing, and a host of other misdeeds. Chiquita denied all the allegations, and sued after it was revealed that Gallagher had repeatedly hacked into Chiquita&#x27;s voicemail system. A special prosecutor was appointed to investigate, because the elected prosecutor at the time had ties to Carl Lindner Jr.

Gallagher had claimed to have obtained over 2,000 voicemails from a Chiquita executive, but in truth he had obtained them by hacking into Chiquita&#x27;s voicemail system as often as 35 times a day. He had continued hacking into the system despite being explicitly directed not to do so by editors and lawyers. According to McWhirter, he also refused to give straight answers about his source to editors and outside lawyers–facts that aroused the suspicions of McWhirter and other reporters.

Six weeks after the stories ran, Gannett reached a settlement with Chiquita, averting a lawsuit. Under the terms of the settlement, on 28 June 1998, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; retracted the entire series of stories and published a front-page apology saying it had &quot;become convinced that [the published] accusations and conclusions are untrue and created a false and misleading impression of Chiquita&#x27;s business practices&quot;. The &quot;Enquirer&quot; also agreed to pay a multi-million-dollar settlement. The exact amount was not disclosed, but Chiquita&#x27;s annual report mentions &quot;a cash settlement in excess of $10 million&quot;. Gallagher was fired and prosecuted and the paper&#x27;s editor, Lawrence K. Beaupre, was transferred to the Gannett&#x27;s headquarters amid allegations that he ignored the paper&#x27;s usual procedures on fact-checking.

In an article examining the Chiquita series, Salon.com said the &quot;Chiquita Secrets Revealed&quot; series &quot;presents a damning, carefully documented array of charges, most of them &#x27;untainted&#x27; by those purloined executive voice mails.&quot;

===Payments to terrorist groups===
In the 1990s and early 2000s, faced with an unstable political situation in Colombia, Chiquita and several other corporations including the Dole Food Company, Fresh Del Monte Produce and Hyundai Motor Corporation made payments to paramilitary organizations in the country, most notably the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC). Chiquita paid the AUC $1.7 million in a ten-year period. Although official accounts from the company state they only made these payments as the AUC was extorting payments from Chiquita in order to ensure their security, these claims are disputed as Chiquita also allowed AUC to use their loading facilities to transport AK-47s. Indeed, the Chiquita&#x27;s United States counsel had warned them against using this extortion defense in cases where the company benefitted from these payments, and the company&#x27;s lawyer reportedly told them to stop making the payments. Chiquita&#x27;s dealings with AUC continued even after it was officially designated as a terrorist organization in the United States. Although the company eventually voluntarily disclosed their involvement with AUC to the United States Department of Justice, they still sent over $300,000 to the organization even after the Justice Department instructed them to halt all payments.

On 14 March 2007, Chiquita Brands was fined $25 million as part of a settlement with the United States Justice Department for having ties to Colombian paramilitary groups. According to court documents, between 1997 and 2004, officers of a Chiquita subsidiary paid approximately $1.7 million to the right-wing United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), in exchange for local employee protection in Colombia&#x27;s volatile banana harvesting zone. Similar payments were also made to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), as well as the National Liberation Army (ELN) from 1989 to 1997, both left-wing organizations. All three of these groups are on the U.S. State Department&#x27;s list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations. Chiquita sued to prevent the United States government from releasing files about their illegal payments to Colombian left-wing guerrillas and right-wing paramilitary groups.

On 7 December 2007, the 29th Specialized District Attorney&#x27;s Office in Medellín, Colombia subpoenaed the Chiquita board to answer questions &quot;concerning charges for conspiracy to commit an aggravated crime and financing illegal armed groups&quot;. Nine board members named in the subpoena allegedly personally knew of the illegal operations. One executive for the company penned a note which proclaimed that the payments were the &quot;cost of doing business in Colombia&quot; and also noted the &quot;need to keep this very confidential – people can get killed.&quot;

In 2013 and 2014, Chiquita spent $780,000 lobbying against the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, hiring lobbyists from Covington and Burling, a high-powered white shoe law firm.

On 24 July 2014, a US appeals court threw out a lawsuit against Chiquita by 4,000 Colombians alleging that the corporation was aiding the right-wing paramilitary group responsible for the deaths of family members. The court ruled 2-1 that US federal courts have no jurisdiction over Colombian claims.

In 2016, Judge Kenneth Marra of the Southern District of Florida ruled in favor of allowing Colombians to sue former Chiquita Brand International executives for the company&#x27;s funding of the outlawed right-wing paramilitary organization that murdered their family members. He stated in his decision that “&#x27;profits took priority over basic human welfare&#x27; in the banana company executives&#x27; decision to finance the illegal death squads, despite knowing that this would advance the paramilitaries&#x27; murderous campaign.&quot;
In February 2018, an agreement between Chiquita and the families of the victims had been reached.

Information about who was behind the Chiquita payments to terrorist groups was made available by the National Security Archive, a nongovernmental research organization, in a series of document releases related to Chiquita&#x27;s operations.

In 2018, Colombia&#x27;s Office of the Attorney General filed charges against 13 Chiquita Brands International executives and administrators after tracing payments made by a local Chiquita affiliate to the paramilitary group AUC, some of which was used to buy machine guns.

In June 2024, a federal jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida found Chiquita liable for the killing of eight Colombians by the right wing paramilitary group United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia. The jury verdict also ordered the company to pay $38.3 million to family members of the victims. The case is &quot;In Re: Chiquita Brands International, Inc., Alien Tort Statute and Shareholders Derivative Litigation&quot; (0:08-md-01916), presided by Judge Kenneth Marra.

===Workers&#x27; rights===
A recurrent issue in agricultural large-scale production are workers&#x27; rights violations, in which Chiquita has been involved as well.

In May 2007, the French non-governmental organization (NGO) Peuples Solidaires (fr) publicly accused the Compañia Bananera Atlántica Limitada (COBAL), a Chiquita subsidiary, of knowingly violating &quot;its workers&#x27; basic rights&quot; and endangering their families&#x27; health and their own. According to the charge, the banana firm carelessly exposed laborers at the Coyol plantation in Costa Rica to highly toxic pesticides on multiple occasions. Additionally, COBAL was accused of using a private militia to intimidate workers. Finally, Peuples Solidaires claimed that Chiquita ignored some union complaints for more than a year.

Another, more recent case of exploitative working conditions dates from April 2019. The Swiss magazine &quot;Beobachter&quot; publicised severe labour rights issues on Ecuador&#x27;s banana plantations, some of which supply Chiquita. These violations involve 12-hour workdays, poverty wages and employment without contracts.

===Environmental issues===

In 1998, a coalition of social activist groups, led by the European Banana Action Network (EUROBAN), targeted the banana industry in general and Chiquita in particular, aiming to create a new climate of corporate social responsibility. Their strategy was to encourage small farming of bananas rather than large scale monoculture, and to push for subsidies and other government relief to level the field for small producers. The fair trade movement, which sought to influence consumers to purchase the products of smallholders, also joined in the action.

Chiquita responded to the activism with changes in corporate management and new patterns of global competition, according to J. Gary Taylor and Patricia Scharlin. Chiquita partnered with the Rainforest Alliance, an environmental group dedicated to preserving the rainforest, and made major reforms in the way they plant and protect their bananas. The changes focused on the use of pesticides but also affected corporate culture. In 2000, Chiquita adopted a new code of conduct that included Social Accountability International&#x27;s SA8000 labor standard. Also in 2000, Chiquita achieved Rainforest Alliance certification for environmentally friendly practices on 100% of its farms. In 2001, Wal-Mart named Chiquita as the &quot;Environmental Supplier of the Year&quot;.

Chiquita has more recently been involved in the hazardous use of pesticides: The Danish media and research centre Danwatch, who specialise in investigative journalism, published a report on pesticide use on banana plantations in Ecuador, some of which supply Chiquita. They found aerial spraying of pesticides without warnings to workers, and the handling of pesticides without proper protections or equipment. Among the pesticides sprayed is Paraquat, a highly hazardous pesticide forbidden in Switzerland and the EU. When approached for comment, Chiquita would neither confirm nor deny the allegations, but reportedly began an internal investigation, the results of which have not been made public.

== In popular culture ==

* Gabriel García Márquez alludes to the Banana Massacre in his novel One Hundred Years of Solitude by describing a military suppression that resulted in the death of 3,000 plantation workers in the fictional town of Macondo. While García Márquez has stated that the deaths in his novel are potential overestimations, the actual number of deaths has never been confirmed. Estimates gathered from oral histories to primary sources vary widely, from 47 to upwards of 1,000 casualties.
* The mission patch for the sixth flight test of SpaceX&#x27;s Starship rocket was likely based on the Chiquita logo, and the &quot;payload&quot; for this mission was a Chiquita banana. The company has also teased a future collaboration with SpaceX.

<doc id="771497" wikidata="Q455834" url="?curid=771497" title="Giovanni Battista Donati">
<text>Giovanni Battista Donati (; 16 December 182620 September 1873) was an Italian astronomer.

Donati graduated from the university of his native city, Pisa, and afterwards joined the staff of the Observatory of Florence in 1852. He was appointed director in 1864.

Donati was also a pioneer in the spectroscopic study of the stars, the Sun, and comets. He observed the total solar eclipse of 18 July 1860, at Torreblanca in Spain, and in the same year began experiments in stellar spectroscopy. In 1862 he published a memoir, &quot;Intorno alle strie degli spettri stellari&quot;, which indicated the feasibility of a physical classification of the stars.

Donati also used spectroscopy of comets to determine their physical composition, in particular with the comet 1864b, which spectrum he found containing three emitting lines which would four years later be identified by William Huggins to be carbon. He discovered that the spectrum changed when a comet approached the Sun, and that heating caused it to emit its own light rather than reflected sunlight: he concluded that the composition of comets is, at least in part, gaseous.

Between 1854 and 1864 he discovered six new comets, including the spectacular Comet Donati (C/1858 L1), found in 1858.

An investigation of the great aurora of 4 February 1872 led Donati to refer such phenomena to a distinct branch of science, designated by him &quot;cosmical meteorology&quot;. However, he could not follow up on the subject, as he died from cholera, which he had contracted while attending a scientific convention in Vienna, the following year.

<text>Coilus was a legendary king of the Britons during the time of the Roman occupation of Britain as recounted in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s pseudohistorical &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. He came to power in 142AD.

He was the son of King Marius and ruled following his father&#x27;s death.

According to Geoffrey, Coilus was brought up in Rome and favoured the company of Romans in Britain. Throughout his reign, he paid Rome its tribute without question. In Britain, he allowed the nobles peace and granted them large gifts. He was succeeded by his only son, Lucius.

<text>Ferdinando Maria Meinrado Francesco Pascale Rosario Carulli (9 February 1770 – 17 February 1841) was an Italian composer for classical guitar and the author of the influential &quot;Méthode complète pour guitare ou lyre&quot;, op. 27 (1810), which contains music still used by student guitarists today. He wrote a variety of works for classical guitar, including numerous solo and chamber works and several concertos. He was an extremely prolific writer, composing over 400 works for the instrument.

==Biography==

Carulli was born to an affluent, upper-class family in Naples. His father, Michele, was a distinguished literator, secretary to the delegate of the Neapolitan Jurisdiction. 

Like many of his contemporaries, Carulli was taught musical theory by a priest, who was also an amateur musician. Carulli&#x27;s first instrument was the cello, taught to him by the local priest. At the age of twenty, Carulli discovered the guitar and devoted his life to the study and advancement of this instrument. As there were no professional guitar teachers in Naples at the time, Carulli developed his own style of playing.

Carulli was a gifted performer. His concerts in Naples were so popular that he soon began touring Europe. Around 1801 Carulli married a French woman, Marie-Josephine Boyer, and had a son with her. A few years later Carulli started to compose in Milan, where he contributed to local publications. After a highly successful Paris tour, Carulli moved there. At the time the city was known as the &#x27;music-capital&#x27; of the world, and he stayed there for the rest of his life.

Carulli became highly successful as a guitar teacher in Paris. It was also here that the majority of his works were published. Later in his life he became a self-publisher. In addition to his own music, he published the works of such other prominent guitarists including Filippo Gragnani, whom he befriended and who later dedicated three guitar duets to Carulli.

Toward the end of his life, Carulli also began to experiment with instrument making. In collaboration with Parisian luthier René Lacôte, he developed a 10-string instrument, the &quot;Decacorde&quot;.

Carulli died in Paris on 17 February 1841, eight days after his 71st birthday.

==Music/style==

Carulli was among the most prolific composers of his time. He wrote more than four hundred works for the guitar, and countless others for various instrumental combinations, always including the guitar. His most influential work, the &quot;Method, op. 27&quot;, published in 1810, contains pieces still widely used today in training students of the classical guitar. Along with numerous works for two guitars, works for guitar with violin or flute, and three concertos for guitar with chamber orchestra, Carulli also composed several works for guitar and piano (in collaboration with his son, Gustavo).

Many of the pieces now regarded as Carulli&#x27;s finest were initially turned down by publishers who considered them too difficult for the average recreational guitarist. It is likely that many of his best works remained unpublished and are now lost. Nevertheless, several of Carulli&#x27;s published works point at the likely quality and sophistication of his concert music, the &quot;Six Andantes Op. 320&quot; (dedicated to the guitarist Matteo Carcassi) being a good example. The great majority of Carulli&#x27;s surviving works, however, were those considered marketable enough by mainstream Parisian publishers aiming at an amateur recreational market.

In addition to his highly successful &quot;Methode Op. 27&quot; (which went through four editions during his lifetime and a major revision, as Op. 241), Carulli also published several supplements to the method, along with a method without explanatory text (&quot;L&#x27;Anti Methode Op. 272&quot;), a method for the decacorde, a harmony treatise, a treatise dealing with guitar accompaniment of the voice, and several collections of vocalises and solfèges. The latter studies were intended to exploit the guitar&#x27;s accompanying capabilities, and to be used by both singer-guitarists amateurs, and voice teachers who were not proficient figured bass readers.

Classical guitarists have recorded many of his works. Arguably his most famous work is a duet for guitar and flute, which was recorded by Alexander Lagoya and Jean-Pierre Rampal, although his Duo in G Op.34 achieved a measure of indirect fame in Britain as the theme tune of cult 1980s science fiction/television game show &quot;The Adventure Game&quot;. The Duo in G has been recorded several times, most famously by Julian Bream and John Williams.

==Instruments used by Carulli==
Among the guitars used by Carulli, one finds
* Guitar around 1810 (photos)According to Philip James Bone&#x27;s book &quot;The guitar and mandolin : biographies of celebrated players and composers for these instruments&quot; (p. 70, 71), this instrument was presented by Ferdinando Carulli to his son Gustave Carulli. The initials GC can be seen on the instrument, at either side of the bridge.
* Pierre René Lacôte, Guitar called &quot;Décacorde&quot;Carulli worked together with Lacote to create the 10-string Décacorde. There exists a patent for this instrument. It is speculated that the original &quot;invention&quot; and patent was aimed at amateur guitarists: in the patent configuration only the 5 lower strings are fretted. On the other hand, there also exist other configurations, where 6 or 7 strings are fretted, and it is speculated that these Décacordes were played professionally.

<text>John Youie &quot;Long John&quot; Woodruff (July 5, 1915 – October 30, 2007) was an American middle-distance runner, winner of the 800 meter event at the 1936 Summer Olympics.

==Early life==
Woodruff was only a freshman at the University of Pittsburgh in 1936 when he placed second at the National Amateur Athletic Union meet and first at the Olympic Trials (in the heat 1:49.9; WR 1:49.8), earning a spot on the U.S. Olympic team. Woodruff was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

Despite his inexperience, he was the favorite in the Olympic 800 meter run, and he did not disappoint. In one of the most exciting races in Olympic history, Woodruff became boxed in by other runners and was forced to stop running. He then came from behind to win in 1:52.9. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the race:

During a career that was curtailed by World War II, Woodruff won one Amateur Athletic Union title in 800 meter in 1937 and won both and IC4A titles from 1937 to 1939. Woodruff also held a share of the world 4×880 yard relay record while competing with the national team.

Woodruff graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 1939, with a major in sociology. While at the University of Pittsburgh, Woodruff became a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. and then earned a master&#x27;s degree in the same field from New York University in 1941. He entered military service in 1941 as a second lieutenant and was discharged as a captain in 1945. He re-entered military service during the Korean War era, and left in 1957 as a lieutenant colonel. He was a battalion commander in the 369th Coastal Artillery Regiment, later the 569th Transportation Battalion of the New York Army National Guard.

==Later years==
In later years Woodruff lived in New Rochelle in Westchester County, New York and in Hightstown, New Jersey. He coached young athletes and officiated at local and Madison Garden track meets. Woodruff also worked as a teacher in New York City, a special investigator for the New York Department of Welfare, a recreation center director for the New York City Police Athletic League, a parole officer for the state of New York, a salesperson for Schieffelin and Co. and an assistant to the Center Director for Edison Job Corps Center in New Jersey. In the late 1990s John, with his wife Rose, retired to Fountain Hills, Arizona residing at Fountain View Village retirement community. Woodruff&#x27;s last public appearance was on April 15, 2007 when he, along with the members of the Tuskegee Airmen, was honored by the Arizona Diamondbacks by throwing out the first pitch. John Woodruff is buried at Crown Hill Cemetery, Indianapolis (section 46, lot 86).

==Legacy==
Each year, a 5-kilometer road race is held in Connellsville to honor Woodruff. In 2016, the 1936 Olympic journey of the eighteen Black American athletes, including Woodruff, was documented in the film &quot;Olympic Pride, American Prejudice&quot;.

<doc id="771514" wikidata="Q240866" url="?curid=771514" title="Elizabeth Roemer">
<text>Elizabeth &quot;Pat&quot; Roemer (September 4, 1929April 8, 2016) was an American astronomer and educator who specialized in astronomy with a particular focus on comets and minor planets. She was well-known for the recovery of lost comets, as well as for her discovery of two asteroids, the co-discovery of Jupiter&#x27;s moon Themisto, and for the asteroid 1657 Roemera that was named in her honor.

== Life ==
Roemer was born on September 4, 1929, in Oakland, California, and was raised in Alameda, California, by her father and mother, Richard Quirin and Elsie B. Roemer. From a young age, Roemer expressed interest in scientific reasoning and matters regarding astronomy. It was revealed by Roemer in an interview that while she was a freshman in high school many of her teachers lacked the proper qualifications. This was because she was a student during the Second World War, when many individuals were teaching on emergency credentials. One of her general science teachers had made remarks with astronomical implications that Roemer believed to be incorrect. One of these statements was that Polaris was the largest star. Despite not having books or sources that contained the correct answers, Roemer was encouraged to look for the right answers elsewhere. She got in touch with a teaching assistant in the Astronomy Department at Berkeley who helped her find the information she was looking for. This marked the beginning of her interest in other aspects of astronomy. 

Roemer graduated valedictorian of her high school class in 1946, and in that same year she won the National Westinghouse Science Talent Search. She became a serious amateur astronomer and was determined to pursue her interest in comets and asteroids. In 1950 she graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a BA in astronomy. She graduated with honors as a Bertha Dolbeer Scholar. During her graduate studies at Berkeley, Roemer taught adult extension classes in Oakland to finance her tuition from 1950–1952. This was the experience that allowed her to develop a passion for teaching. From 1954–1955, she worked as an assistant astronomer and lab technician at UC’s Lick Observatory, and in 1955 she earned her PhD from Berkeley.

After receiving her PhD, Roemer continued her time at UC as an assistant astronomer and conducted research at the University of Chicago’s Yerkes Observatory. Roemer received the title of astronomer in 1957 at the US Naval Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. She began to gain traction for rediscovering comets by using a high definition 40-inch reflecting telescope to photograph and analyze nuclei. Her groundbreaking research led to the recovery of dozens of short period comets–comets that take less than 20 years to orbit the Sun. Scientists at the time did not have methods or equipment that could easily track short period comets around the Sun, and these comets would become “lost” once the distance became too great. Roemer found these lost comets by searching the area they were predicted to be as they rounded the Sun and detected faint movement relative to surrounding stars. This was no simple feat, as predicting the position and brightness of the comet was extremely difficult, especially for comets that had been missing for extended periods of time. Roemer’s data and measurements of the brightness of these recovered comets at large distances has aided astronomers of her time and allowed for the tracking of many short period comets around the Sun until this day.

In 1965, she became the acting director at the US Naval Observatory. She was then hired by the University of Arizona in Tucson as an associate professor in the lunar and planetary laboratory in 1966, and promoted to full professor by 1969. In addition, she was asked to chair the committee that would set up UA’s Department of Planetary Sciences in 1972. In 1980, while still a UA professor, she served as an astronomer at Tucson’s Steward Observatory. She served at the observatory until 1997. Roemer finally retired in 1998 but continued her research on comets and asteroids as astronomer and professor emerita. On April 8, 2016, Roemer died in Tucson, Arizona.

== International Astronomical Union ==
Roemer was noted as an exemplary member of the astronomy community and served on many astronomical commissions and organizations. She held various positions throughout the years, including president and vice-president of the International Astronomical Union&#x27;s Commission 6 and Commission 20.

== Major accomplishments ==
In 1961, asteroid 1657 Roemera was named in her honor. She discovered the asteroid 1930 Lucifer on October 29, 1964, and the asteroid 1983 Bok on June 9, 1975. She also co-discovered Jupiter’s moon Themisto with Charles T. Kowal in 1975. Themisto was lost soon after its discovery because it is an irregular moon of Jupiter. However, it was finally recovered in 2000. Throughout her career, Roemer detected the return of 79 periodic comets and computed the orbits of numerous comets and minor planets.

== Awards and recognition ==
Roemer received several awards and recognitions in the course of her lifetime and professional career. She was a recipient of the BA Gould Prize of the National Academy of Sciences, the NASA Special Award, and the Donohoe Lectureship of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. In 1960, Mademoiselle Magazine honored her work with comets and named her one of its Ten Young Women of the Year. Roemer expressed her hope that her Mademoiselle Merit Award would encourage others to explore the field of astronomy in a letter to the manager of Women’s News for Westinghouse. 

== Death and legacy ==
Elizabeth Roemer was an active member of the astronomy community until her death in 2016. She became a member of the Friends of Lowell Observatory in 2006, as well as a member of the Percival Lowell Society. Before dying, she made a donation that created what is known as the Elizabeth Roemer Foundation Donation. The money was used to create an instrumentation fund in the Lowell Observatory Foundation, supporting the acquisition, development, maintenance of, and access to improved technologies and materials within the observatory’s facilities. Her support created safe and effective organization and operation of the observatory&#x27;s equipment and technology.

<doc id="771517" wikidata="Q1851201" url="?curid=771517" title="Alexandre Lagoya">
<text>Alexandre Lagoya (29 June 1929 – 24 August 1999) was a French classical guitarist and composer. His early career included boxing and guitar, and as he cites on the sleeve of a 1981 Columbia album, his parents hoped he would outgrow his predilection for both.

==Life and career==
Lagoya was born on 29 June 1929 in Alexandria, Egypt, to a Greek father and an Italian mother. By 1955, when he married the French guitarist Ida Presti, his career had already begun. On the sleeve of his 1981 record with Columbia, Lagoya pays deep tribute to Presti and admits that after her premature death he was unable to play for years. He returned to the guitar as a teacher, tutoring among other famous guitarists the Canadian virtuoso Liona Boyd (who claims in her autobiography that she was also his lover). In the early 1980s, aged 52, he burst back on the international scene with a record for Columbia and an international tour.

Lagoya played a variety of works for guitar, performing concerts and recording albums, often collaborating with Presti and also with other musicians. Lagoya was also a successful teacher. He taught at the Conservatoire de Paris and, in Canada, and developed a new method of hand positioning which he believed helped people learn to play the guitar better. He also added the use of the little finger to plucking and claimed to have invented a method for maximizing the sound coming from the classical guitar.

Concerning the right hand, Alexandre Lagoya preferred the technique of plucking from the right side of the nail, and he believed it gave a more powerful sound.

A number of composers wrote works for Lagoya and the Presti-Lagoya Duo, including:

* Daniel Jean-Yves Lesur: &quot;Élégie&quot; (1956).
* Pierre Petit: &quot;Tarantelle&quot; (1959); &quot;Toccata&quot; (1959).
* André Jolivet: &quot;Sérénade pour deux guitares&#x27; (1959).
* Joaquín Rodrigo: &quot;Tonadilla&quot; (1959). Rodrigo finished another piece for two guitars, the &quot;Concierto Madrigal&quot; (first named &quot;Concierto para una Virreina de España&quot;, in 1966, but Presti died before she and Lagoya could perform it. Angel and Pepe Romero subsequently gave the first performance of it in Los Angeles in July 1970, 30 July. 
* Pierre Wissmer: &quot;Prestilagoyana&quot; (1969).
* Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco: &quot;Sonatina Canonica pour deux guitares&quot;, Op. 196 (1961).
* Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco: &quot;Les Guitares bien tempérées - 24 Préludes et fugues pour deux guitares&quot;, Op. 199 (1962).
* Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco: Concerto pour deux guitares et orchestre, Op. 201 (1962).
* Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco: &quot;Fuga elegiaca pour deux guitares&quot;, Op. postuma (1967).
* Joaquín Rodrigo: &quot;Triptico para guitarra&quot; (1977).

<doc id="771519" wikidata="Q1395018" url="?curid=771519" title="Kalonzo Musyoka">
<text>Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka (born 24 December 1953) is a Kenyan politician who was the tenth Vice-President of Kenya from 2008 to 2013. Musyoka served in the government under the late President Daniel arap Moi as the Secretary of Kenya African National Union party (1980-1988), Assistant Minister for Works (1986-1988), Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly (1988-1992), Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1993 until 1998, Minister of Education (1998-2001); and subsequently, under the late President Mwai Kibaki, he was Minister of Foreign Affairs again from 2003 to 2004, then Minister of the Environment from 2004 to 2005. He was an unsuccessful candidate in the 2007 presidential election, after which he was appointed vice-president by Kibaki in January 2008.

Kalonzo Musyoka is the party leader of the Wiper Democratic Movement (formerly Orange Democratic Movement-Kenya). He also serves as Chief Commissioner for The Kenya Scouts Association.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Tseikuru, in a remote part of Kitui District in British Kenya&#x27;s then Southern Province. Between 1960 and 1967 he studied at Tseikuru Full Primary School to attain basic education. Then he went to Kitui High School in Kitui for the ordinary level and eventually to Meru School in Meru from where he graduated in the advanced level in 1973. Kalonzo Musyoka graduated with a Bachelor of Law degree from the University of Nairobi in 1977. He continued further studies at the Kenya School of Law in 1978 where he was awarded a Post graduate diploma in Law. In 1979, he attended the Mediterranean Institute of Management in Cyprus where he earned a post graduate Diploma in Business.

In 2009, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in divinity among other 17 beneficiaries at the Charter hall in Nairobi. This was one of the &quot;honorary professorships and doctorate degrees&quot; that were issued by Professor Clyde Rivers, the International Commissioner of the Latin University of Theology, based in Inglewood, California.On 19 December 2008, Kalonzo Musyoka was honoured with a Doctorate in Humane Letters (honoris causa) in recognition of his achievements in peace making, conflict resolution efforts, sustainable community development and humanistic ideals by Kenyatta University during its 25th graduation. Named African Dignitary Man of the year 2016.

==Political career==
Musyoka vied for the Kitui North Constituency parliamentary seat in 1983, but was defeated. At that time, Kenya was one-party state and the only party fielding candidates was Kenya African National Union (KANU). However, only two years later, in 1985 the Kitui North seat was vacated and Musyoka won subsequent by-elections, thus becoming an MP at the age of 32. In 1986 he was appointed Assistant Minister for Works, Housing and Physical Planning, serving until 1988. He was re-elected at the 1988 parliamentary elections and served as Deputy Speaker of the National assembly from 1988 to 1992. He was also KANU&#x27;s National Organizing Secretary from 1988 to 2002.

===1992–1997 Kenyan Parliament===
Kenya&#x27;s first multiparty elections were held in 1992. Musyoka stayed in KANU, renewed his parliamentary position and was appointed as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation. He also held couple of other ministerial positions while part of the KANU government.
In June 1993, he addressed the World Conference on Human Rights in Austria which was the first human rights conference held since the end of the Cold War. He termed the illicit mineral trade which fuels and finances what he called &#x27;the cause of incessant conflicts, environmental degradation but ultimately and sadly too, poverty&#x27;. The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action was the major result from this meeting after the participants reached a consensus.

===1997–2002 Kenyan Parliament===
He was again elected to the parliament at the 1997 elections, but now from Mwingi North Constituency, since his former constituency Kitui North was split into new constituencies.

===2002–2007 Kenyan Parliament===
In the months leading up to the 2002 general election, under the leadership of then KANU secretary general, Raila Odinga, he decamped from KANU to join the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) as a founding member under the banner of the National Rainbow Coalition, which went on to win the general elections.

On 1 December 2003, as the Minister for home affairs and international co-operation for Kenya, he welcomed the people to this meeting, whose theme was Strengthening the role of IGAD in regional peace initiatives and post conflict reconstruction on behalf of the republic of Kenya and thanked the Danish government, IGAD Secretariat and the ISS on behalf of the IGAD Member States for their preparations and funding of the meeting. Kalonzo Musyoka was involved in the Sudan peace process between 1993 and 1997 and he was part of the team that reconstituted the draft establishing IGAD in 1995.

Musyoka became Minister for Foreign Affairs for a second time under President Mwai Kibaki, but in a cabinet reshuffle on 30 June 2004 he was moved to the post of Minister for Environment. In late August 2004, he was additionally removed from his position as chairman of the Sudanese and Somali peace talks and was replaced by John Koech. Musyoka was reportedly unhappy with President Kibaki&#x27;s refusal to honour a pre-election &quot;Memorandum of understanding&quot; (MOU) which they had signed with the president&#x27;s party NAK. He was one of the leaders of the successful &quot;No&quot;-campaign in the November 2005 referendum on the proposed new constitution. Following the referendum, he was dismissed from the Cabinet.

Subsequently, Kalonzo Musyoka decamped Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) into the little-known Labor Party of Kenya.

Kalonzo Musyoka was widely expected to vie for the presidency in the December 2007 election. Musyoka campaigned for the ODM-Kenya ticket, facing a number of other contenders. His rating for December 2007 election steadily dropped, and political analysts wondered whether he would make a significant impact. His relationship with fellow ODM-Kenya leader Raila Odinga, who was also after the ODM-Kenya presidential ticket, was the subject of much speculation. Many observers questioned whether the presidential hopefuls of ODM-Kenya, particularly Raila and Musyoka, could unite to support one common candidate for the general election.

The ODM-Kenya split into two factions, one gathered around Musyoka and the other around Odinga, in August 2007. Musyoka was elected by his faction as its presidential candidate on 31 August 2007, receiving 2,835 votes in a secret ballot against Julia Ojiambo, who received 791 votes.

Musyoka has been quoted as saying &quot;... the war against poverty could not be won unless environmental issues were addressed.&quot;

Musyoka launched his presidential campaign at Uhuru Park in Nairobi on 14 October 2007. This move was criticised by those who saw him as a traitor to the ODM party of Raila Odinga. December 2007 polls put Odinga ahead and Kibaki following closely, Kalonzo however said that &quot;atapitia katikati&quot; (passing between two people).

===After 2007===

According to official results, Musyoka placed a distant third behind Kibaki and Odinga with 9% of the vote. Amid a violent crisis over the results, with supporters of Odinga disputing the outcome, Kibaki appointed Musyoka as vice-president and Minister of Home Affairs on 8 January 2008. Musyoka expressed gratitude to Kibaki and, referring to the ongoing dispute and violence, said that he was &quot;intensely aware that the appointment has come at a difficult time when our nation is going through a painful moment&quot;. He took office as vice-president on 9 January.
The political crisis eventually led to the signing of a power-sharing agreement between Kibaki and Odinga. In the Grand Coalition Cabinet that was announced on 13 April 2008, Musyoka remained vice-president and Minister of Home Affairs.

In 2010 Musyoka supported the draft constitution in the campaign for 4 August referendum but Members of the campaign team opposing the draft constitution claimed that he was secretly opposing the draft leading to a satirical comparison of Musyoka to a watermelon which is naturally green outside and red inside, the team supporting the draft constitution was represented by color green while the team opposing the draft constitution was represented by the color red hence the &quot;green team&quot; and the &quot;red team&quot;, Musyoka&#x27;s nickname watermelon was because of his alleged open support for the green team and secret support for the red team. Most of the opposition of the draft constitution were the clergy.

===2013 Elections===

In the race for the 4th president of Kenya, Kalonzo Musyoka joined his longtime political opponent Raila Odinga to form the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) with Musyoka shelving his presidential ambition to run as Odinga&#x27;s running mate.

When the first round of the presidential election took place on 4 March 2013, Uhuru Kenyatta was declared the president-elect of Kenya by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. Raila Odinga challenged this in the Supreme Court of Kenya. Questions were raised why Musyoka was not a petitioner in the case.

After the Supreme Court dismissed the CORD Petition, he left office when the President-elect, Uhuru Kenyatta, was sworn in.

===2017 Elections===

For the 2017 general election, Musyoka once again joined Raila Odinga to form the National Super Alliance to oppose president Kenyatta and deputy president William Ruto. Musyoka then ran under Odinga as his running mate.

===2022 Elections===

In the 2022 elections, Musyoka announced that he would vie for presidency; he however dropped his presidential bid and supported Azimio la Umoja candidate Raila Odinga.

==Other responsibilities==
Dr Kalonzo Musyoka has, since 10 June 2013, served as the University Chancellor of the Uganda Technology and Management University (UTAMU), a privately owned university in Uganda, based in Kampala, that country&#x27;s capital and largest city.

In July 2019, Dr Kalonzo Musyoka was appointed by President Uhuru Kenyatta as a special envoy to the republic of South Sudan. In February 2020, he was able to broker a peace deal in South Sudan between President Salva Kiir and former rebel leader Riek Machar. The deal saw the two form a unity government.

==Personal life==
Kalonzo Musyoka is married to Pauline. They have four children. He is a baptised and devout Christian. He is the patron of the Kalonzo Musyoka Foundation and he has served since 2006.

<text>Yesha () is a Hebrew acronym for &quot;Judea, Samaria, Gaza&quot; (, &quot;Yehuda Shomron &#x27;Azza&quot;) – a geographical area, roughly corresponding to the West Bank and Gaza Strip combined. &quot;Yesha&quot; is one of a number of terms used to describe the areas of former Mandatory Palestine, occupied by Egypt and Jordan and later became a part of a military governorate.

The Israeli Military Governorate was established by Israel in the Israeli-occupied territories following the Six-Day War in June 1967, together with Sinai and Golan areas. In 1982, areas of Yesha were transferred from military occupation governance to Israeli Civil Administration under the Ministry of Defense, whereas East Jerusalem was unilaterally annexed to Israel; the same year Sinai was returned to Egypt, while Western Golan was unilaterally annexed via the Golan Law. In 1994 and 1995, much of Yesha was transferred to autonomous rule of the Palestinian Authority, under the Oslo Accords. 

Other acronyms used by Israelis for the West Bank portion are Shai ( &quot;Shomron VeYehuda&quot; – Samaria and Judea), and Ayosh ( &quot;Ezor Yehuda VeShomron&quot; – Judea and Samaria Area).

The Yesha Council is the umbrella organization of the various municipal councils (local, regional, and cities) which represent Jews in the area. The Judea and Samaria Area administrative division was established to govern Israeli communities within the boundaries of Yesha (in area C of the West Bank).

== Not to be confused with ==
Aside from being an acronym, &quot;yesha&quot; () is also the Hebrew word for salvation. As such, it has been used as place name for a moshav in Israel, Yesha, and also features in the biblical name Yeshayahu (Isaiah). In addition, neither of these uses is to be confused with Yeshua or Yeshu.</text><links>

<doc id="771523" wikidata="Q2199411" url="?curid=771523" title="Lucius of Britain">
<text>Lucius (Welsh: Lles map Coel, Lleirwg, Lleufer or Lleufer Mawr) was a supposed 2nd-century king of the Britons traditionally credited with introducing Christianity into Britain. Lucius is first mentioned in a 6th-century version of the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, which says that he sent a letter to Pope Eleutherius asking to be made a Christian. The story became widespread after it was repeated in the 8th century by Bede, who added the detail that after Eleutherius granted Lucius&#x27; request, the Britons followed their king in conversion and maintained the Christian faith until the Diocletianic Persecution of 303. Later writers expanded the story, giving accounts of missionary activity under Lucius and attributing to him the foundation of certain churches.

== First mention: Papal Catalogues ==
The first mention of Lucius is in a list of popes, with additional biographical notes, written in 532 AD and called the &quot;Catalogus Felicianus&quot;. In regards to King Lucius it says;

&quot;(Pope Eleutherius) ..received a letter from Lucius, King of Britain, asking him to appoint a way by which Lucius might become a christian&quot;.

The Catalogus Felicianus is an update of earlier lists. The first known version, (and probably based on a still earlier catalogue) the &quot;Liber Generationis&quot; (235 AD) is completely lost. Copies of the second version, the Liberian Catalogue, contained within the &quot;Chronograph&quot; (354 AD) are in circulation, but the key period covering Lucius and Pope Eleutherus (174-189 AD), which occurs between Pope Soter (166–174) and Pope Victor (189–199) is incomplete and mentions neither person.

&quot;&quot;Soter 9 years...&quot; 
&quot;... 3 months, 2 days. He was in the times of Antoninus and Commodus, from the consulate of Verus and Herenianus [171] to that of Paternus and Bradua [185].&quot;
&quot;Victor 9 years, 2 months 10 days. He was in the time...&quot;.

== Academic debates ==
Because there is no other contemporary evidence for a British King Lucius, either in the writings of antiquity or in subsequently discovered artefacts (e.g. coins or inscriptions), academics question if he really existed.

In 1868 Arthur West Haddan and William Stubbs suggested that it might have been pious fiction invented to support the efforts of missionaries in Britain in the time of Saint Patrick and Palladius. Since the early twentieth century most scholars have believed that his appearance in the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; is the result of a scribal error, based on a theory proposed by German scholar Adolf von Harnack. Von Harnack argued that King Lucius was actually King Abgar VIII of Edessa and the mix up was due to a scribal error. Von Harnack then suggested that a scribe had used Agbar&#x27;s middle name of Lucius, and had mistakenly described him as King of &#x27;Britanio&#x27; (e.g. Britain) instead of &#x27;Britio&#x27;, a citadel of Edessa, present day Şanlıurfa in Turkey.

Harnack&#x27;s proposal has been more recently challenged by British archaeologist David J. Knight. In his book &quot;King Lucius of Britain&quot;, Knight argues that Abgar of Edessa was never called Lucius of Britio/Birtha in contemporary sources, and that to call Lucius King of a &#x27;Citadel&#x27; (eg Britio) is non-sensical. Furthermore, Agbar was only granted additional his Latin names; Lucius Aelius Septeimus, sometimes after 193 AD, several years after Lucius&#x27; conversion. Knight therefore argues for accepting the traditional identification of Lucius as a British ruler.

== British sources ==
For centuries the story of this &quot;first Christian king&quot; was widely believed, especially in Britain, where it was considered an accurate account of Christianity among the early Britons. During the English Reformation, the Lucius story was used in polemics by both Catholics and Protestants; Catholics considered it evidence of papal supremacy from a very early date, while Protestants used it to bolster claims of the primacy of a British national church founded by the crown.

The English monk Bede included the Lucius story in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, completed in 731. He may have heard it from a contemporary who had been to Rome, such as Nothhelm. Bede adds the detail that Lucius&#x27; new faith was thereafter adopted by his people, who maintained it until the Diocletianic Persecution. Following Bede, versions of the Lucius story appeared in Nennius&#x27;s 9th-century &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, and in 12th-century works such as Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, William of Malmesbury&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Pontificum Anglorum&quot;, and the Book of Llandaff. The most influential of these accounts was Geoffrey&#x27;s, which emphasizes Lucius&#x27; virtues and gives a detailed, if fanciful, account of the spread of Christianity during his reign. In his version, Lucius is the son of the benevolent King Coilus and rules in the manner of his father. Hearing of the miracles and good works performed by Christian disciples, he writes to Pope Eleutherius asking for assistance in his conversion. Eleutherius sends two missionaries, Fuganus and Duvianus, who baptise the king and establish a successful Christian order throughout Britain. They convert the commoners and flamens, turn pagan temples into churches, and establish dioceses and archdioceses where the flamens had previously held power. The pope is pleased with their accomplishments, and Fuganus and Duvianus recruit another wave of missionaries to aid the cause. Lucius responds by granting land and privileges to the Church. He dies without heir in AD 156, thereby weakening Roman influence in Britain.

== Church of St Peter upon Cornhill ==
There is a long-standing tradition in London that St Peter upon Cornhill church was founded by King Lucius. Interestingly, the church altar is sited directly above the potential location of a pagan shrine room, of the great Roman London basilica.

Two other facts however, may give credence to a Roman past. The first is that London sent a bishop, Restitutus, to the Council of Arles in 314 AD. Restitutus must have had a church base. Secondly, in 1417, during a discussion about the order of precedence in a Whit Monday procession, the Mayor of London confirmed that St Peter&#x27;s was the first church founded in London. Given that St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral was founded in 604, this clearly implies that St Peter&#x27;s was considered in 1417 to be founded pre-600.

== King Lucius Tablet ==
The London historian John Stow, writing at the end of the 16th century, reported &quot;there remaineth in this church a table whereon is written, I know not by what authority, but of a late hand, that King Lucius founded the same church to be an archbishop&#x27;s see metropolitan, and chief church of his kingdom, and that it so endured for four hundred years&quot;. The &quot;table&quot; (tablet) seen by Stow was destroyed when the medieval church was burnt in the Great Fire of London, but before this time a number of writers had recorded what it said. The text of the original tablet as printed by John Weever in 1631 began:

Be hit known to al men, that the yeerys of our Lord God an clxxix [AD 179]. &quot;Lucius&quot; the fyrst christen kyng of this lond, then callyd Brytayne, fowndyd the fyrst chyrch in London, that is to sey, the Chyrch of Sent &quot;Peter&quot; apon Cornhyl, and he fowndyd ther an Archbishoppys See, and made that Chirch the Metropolitant, and cheef Chirch of this kingdom...

A replacement, in the form of an inscribed brass plate, was set up after the Great Fire and still hangs in the church vestry. The text of the brass plate has been printed several times, for example by George Godwin in 1839, and an engraving of it was included in Robert Wilkinson&#x27;s &quot;Londina Illustrata&quot; (1819–25).

==Lucius of Chur==
Lucius of Britain is sometimes identified with Lucius of Chur who was active in Switzerland. This is because Lucius of Chur was often referred to (in German language) as (&#x27;nobleman of the Pritanni&#x27;). However, here refers to tribe after which the Swiss region Prättigau was named, not to Britain.

The municipality had a population of 6,764 (as of January 1, 2006) and covered an area of 1,088.25 km2 of which 149.30 km2 was water. The population density was 6.2 inhabitants per km2.

Eno railway station is the first station north of Joensuu on the railway between Joensuu and Nurmes.

The municipality was unilingually Finnish. The name &quot;Eno&quot; comes from the Karelian word, which means the center of the river, where the water flows most strongly. The beaver of the coat of arms on the triple hill refers to Majoinvaara in Eno, and the ax carried on its shoulder symbolizes deforestation and forestry. The coat of arms was designed by Ahti Hammar and approved by Eno&#x27;s municipal council at its meeting on November 22, 1954. The coat of arms was approved for use by the Ministry of the Interior on April 15, 1955.

Eno was consolidated with Joensuu on January 1, 2009.

<text>Dimitrij Rupel (born 7 April 1946) is a Slovenian politician.

== Early life and education==
Rupel was born in Ljubljana, in what was then the PR Slovenia, into a bourgeois family of former anti-fascist political emigrants from the Julian March (his grandfather was the last Slovene mayor of Duino in Austria-Hungary).

After receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree in comparative literature and sociology from the University of Ljubljana in 1970, he continued his studies at the University of Essex, and Brandeis University where he obtained a PhD in sociology in 1976. During this time, he published literary works, journalistic and critical articles, and worked as a translator and editor. From 1977 to 1978, he taught at Queen&#x27;s University in Canada, then in 1985 at the New School for Social Research of New York and at Cleveland State University in 1989.

==Career==
===Career in national politics===
Together with other Slovene intellectuals in the 1980s, initiated and edited the alternative and dissident journal &quot;Nova Revija&quot;, which later became the platform for democratic reform in the Socialist Republic of Slovenia.

In 1987, he was among the authors of the Contributions to the Slovenian National Program, an intellectual manifesto that demanded a democratic, pluralistic and sovereign Slovenian state. The publication of the manifesto by the journal &quot;Nova revija&quot;, edited by Rupel, caused a huge scandal in Yugoslavia, and Rupel was forced to step down as editor. In 1989, he was one of the founders of the Slovenian Democratic Union (&quot;Slovenska demokratična zveza&quot;, SDZ), one of the first parties that opposed Communist rule.

After the victory of the anti-Communist DEMOS coalition in the first free elections in Slovenia in 1990, Rupel was appointed as State Secretary for International Cooperation in the cabinet of Lojze Peterle, thus becoming &quot;de facto&quot; the first foreign minister of the Republic of Slovenia, which was then seeking independence from Yugoslavia. During his term in office, Slovenia declared its independence and gained international recognition. Rupel also remained in office during the first centre-left coalition government led by Janez Drnovšek.

In 1991, the Slovenian Democratic Union suffered an internal split: Rupel led its left-wing fraction, formed among others by Jelko Kacin, Igor Bavčar, and France Bučar, into the formation of a new party, called the Democratic Party. The same year, he was elected its president. In the elections of 1992, the new party suffered a defeat, but Rupel managed to be elected a representative in the National Assembly of Slovenia. In 1994, most of Rupel&#x27;s party merged into the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia party, led by Janez Drnovšek. In 1994, he ran for mayor of Ljubljana and took office in 1995. He remained in this position until 1997, when he was appointed ambassador to the United States.

Rupel returned to the post of the foreign minister of Slovenia in 2000 in the third cabinet of Janez Drnovšek. He remained in this position until July 2004, when Prime Minister Anton Rop replaced him with Ivo Vajgl. He returned to his seat in parliament, left the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia party, and joined the opposition Slovenian Democratic Party. In October 2004, this party won the election and Rupel became foreign minister in Janez Janša&#x27;s centre-right government when it was approved by parliament on 3 December 2004. After years of negotiations, disagreements and delays he signed the Agreement on Succession Issues of the Former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on behalf of Slovenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;NN 2/2004 (17.3.2004.)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2005 he was the chairman-in-office of the OSCE.

In 2008, after the victory of the centre-left coalition led by Borut Pahor, Rupel was replaced as foreign minister by Samuel Žbogar. However, he was nominated by newly elected Prime Minister Borut Pahor as his personal Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs.

===Later career===
Rupel is a member of PEN, AAASS, the Slovenian Writer&#x27;s Association, and the Association of Sociologists. In addition to Slovene, he speaks English, Croatian, German, Italian and French to varying degrees.

In 2017 Rupel was an international observer in the 2017 Catalan independence referendum.

In 2020, Rupel was one of the candidates for the post as Representative on Freedom of the Media of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

==Personal life==
Rupel is the uncle of the Slovene pop-singer Anja Rupel.

He was married to Marjetica Ana Rudolf Rupel until her death in 2022. She was previously married to Slovenian singer Lado Leskovar. Her father was Janko Rudolf, Slovenian partisan, People&#x27;s Hero and politician.

<doc id="771536" wikidata="Q7227647" url="?curid=771536" title="Pond's">
<text>Pond&#x27;s is an English brand of beauty and health care products, currently owned by Unilever.

==History==
Pond&#x27;s Cream was invented in the United States as a patent medicine by pharmacist Theron T. Pond (1800–1852) of Utica, New York, in 1846. Mr. Pond extracted a healing tea from witch hazel [&quot;Hamamelis&quot; spp.] which he discovered could heal small cuts and other ailments. The product was named &quot;Golden Treasure.&quot; After Theron died, it would soon be known as &quot;Pond&#x27;s Extract.&quot;

In 1849, the &quot;T. T. Pond Company&quot; was formed with Pond and other investors. Soon after, he sold his portion of the company because of failing health. He died in 1852. In 1914, the company was incorporated under the name &quot;Pond&#x27;s Extract Company&quot;.

The company then moved to Connecticut establishing its manufacturing center there. Later it moved its sales office to New York City.

In 1886, Pond&#x27;s began to advertise nationally. They advertised under the name of Pond&#x27;s Healing until 1910.

By the twentieth century, the company&#x27;s main emphasis was selling cosmetics products. The &quot;Pond&#x27;s Vanishing Cream&quot; and the &quot;Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream&quot; were created, marking the entrance of Pond&#x27;s products into the facial care industry. Today Pond&#x27;s is sold around the world. Its largest markets are in Spain and in Asia, including India, Japan and Thailand.

=== 1910s ===

By 1910, Pond&#x27;s was a well established brand among Americans. Concentrating mostly on their vanishing cream, the Pond&#x27;s company began an ad campaign that would become popular because of the celebrities involved in it. &quot;Pond&#x27;s Healing&quot; took a back seat to &quot;Pond&#x27;s Vanishing Cream&quot;, as &quot;Pond&#x27;s Healing&quot; and &quot;Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream&quot; would be announced in small print under the &quot;Pond&#x27;s Vanishing Cream&quot; advertisements.

By 1914, mentions of &quot;Pond&#x27;s Healing&quot; were taken off the ads, and the Pond&#x27;s company began to advertise &quot;Pond&#x27;s Vanishing Cream&quot; and &quot;Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream&quot; together, making sure to explain each cream&#x27;s different purposes on the new ads. One particular ad line read &quot;Every normal skin needs these two creams&quot;.

As a result of the new campaign, &quot;Pond&#x27;s Vanishing Cream&quot; had a 60% increase in sales during 1915, and &quot;Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream&quot; had a 27% increase.

===1920s===
By 1922, sales of the products had gone down, as many believed that such an easily available product could not perform as well as other, &quot;designer&quot; products. Because of this, the Pond&#x27;s Company then targeted royalty, politicians and people of high class stature to become advertisers for the company. In addition, these ads were printed in magazines such as &quot;Vogue&quot; and others, to give customers a feeling that they really were getting a quality product for a fair price.

In 1923, Queen Marie of Romania visited the United States, and she enjoyed the product so much that in 1925 she wrote to the Pond&#x27;s Company requesting more supplies. Her letter was, in turn, used for advertisement, and Her Majesty joined the list of celebrities who had previously sponsored the products.

Around the time of Queen Marie&#x27;s visit to the United States, the Pond&#x27;s Company began to place samples of their products at their magazine ads, and the characters of &quot;Peter&quot; and &quot;Polly Ponds&quot; were created, as part of their campaign to entice normal people into buying their cream again. The marketing strategies proved successful, as sales of the Pond&#x27;s facial creams went up again.

&quot;Peter&quot; and &quot;Polly Ponds&quot; disappeared from the company&#x27;s ad campaigns after 1925.

=== 1930s-&#x27;40s ===
During the Depression Era of the 1930s, the company&#x27;s business slowed somewhat. However, the Pond&#x27;s company expanded slowly, adding Face Powder. 
&#x27; Angel Face &#x27; was first marketed in 1946.

=== First merger ===
Pond&#x27;s Company was merged in 1955 with the Chesebrough Manufacturing Company, which had a good percentage of brands in the facial care field. With this merger, &quot;Pond&#x27;s Creams&quot; became sisters with the Cutex nail polish brand and the Matchabelli perfumes.

With the Chesebrough Manufacturing Company in command, &quot;Pond&#x27;s Creams&quot; became available at many supermarkets across the United States. The creams&#x27; bottles consisted of small, glass bottles with a round cap. The bottles were recognizable by their distinctive colors, usually in green, blue or white. The bottle design is still in use by the Pond&#x27;s brand.

=== Second merger ===
In 1987, the Chesebrough Manufacturing Company, popularly known as &quot;Chesebrough-Ponds&quot;, was acquired by Anglo-Dutch company Unilever, giving &quot;Pond&#x27;s Creams&quot; a more international reach.

<text>This is a list of &quot;[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]&quot; cast members who portrayed or voiced characters appearing in the film series. The list below is sorted by film and the character&#x27;s surname, as some characters have been portrayed by multiple actors.

==Overview==
Dozens of actors from the United Kingdom and Ireland portrayed or voiced characters appearing in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series based on the book series by J. K. Rowling. In all the films, Daniel Radcliffe played Harry Potter, Rupert Grint played Ron Weasley and Emma Watson played Hermione Granger. When they were cast only Radcliffe had previously acted in a film. Complementing them on screen are such actors as Helena Bonham Carter, Jim Broadbent, John Cleese, Robbie Coltrane, Warwick Davis, Ralph Fiennes, Michael Gambon, Brendan Gleeson, Richard Griffiths, Richard Harris, John Hurt, Jason Isaacs, Miriam Margolyes, Helen McCrory, Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman, Fiona Shaw, Maggie Smith, Timothy Spall, Imelda Staunton, David Thewlis, Emma Thompson, and Julie Walters, among others. Thirteen actors appeared as the same character in all eight films of the series.

Some well-known British actors who have not appeared in the series were asked in jest why they had not been cast. When David Yates was directing the fifth film, Bill Nighy (who knew Yates personally) said that he hoped the director would cast him in &quot;Harry Potter&quot;. &quot;But nobody called&quot;, Nighy added. However, in 2009, Yates cast Nighy as Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour in the seventh film. Nighy said, &quot;I am no longer the only English actor not to be in &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and I am very pleased.&quot; Jude Law once quipped, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s asked me. I was a bit too old for Harry.&quot; He would later be cast as a younger Albus Dumbledore in &quot;Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald&quot;.

J. K. Rowling gave a speech at the premiere of the final film in the series, &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot;, on 7 July 2011 in London. Rowling praised the film series&#x27; acting talent and announced that there are seven young &quot;Harry Potter&quot; cast members whom she refers to as &quot;The Big Seven&quot;; they are Radcliffe, Grint, Watson, Tom Felton, Matthew Lewis, Evanna Lynch and Bonnie Wright.

<text>Intramuros () is the historic walled area within the city of Manila, the capital of the Philippines. It is administered by the Intramuros Administration with the help of the city government of Manila.

Intramuros comprises a centuries-old historic district, entirely surrounded by fortifications, that was considered at the time of the Spanish Empire to be the entire City of Manila. Other towns and &quot;arrabales&quot; (suburbs) located beyond the walls that are now districts of Manila were referred to as &quot;extramuros&quot;, Spanish for &quot;outside the walls&quot;, and were independent towns that were only incorporated into the city of Manila during the early 20th century.

Intramuros served as the seat of government of the Captaincy General of the Philippines, a component realm of the Spanish Empire, housing the colony&#x27;s governor-general from its founding in 1571 until 1865, and the Real Audiencia of Manila until the end of Spanish rule during the Philippine Revolution of 1898. The walled city was also considered the religious and educational center of the Spanish East Indies. Intramuros was also an economic center as the Asian hub of the Manila galleon trade, carrying goods to and from Acapulco in what is now Mexico.

During the early 20th century, under the administration of American colonial authorities, land reclamation and the construction of the Manila South Port subsequently moved the coastline westward and obscured the walls and fort from the bay, while the moat surrounding the fortifications was drained and turned into a recreational golf course. The Battle of Manila in 1945 during World War II entirely flattened Intramuros. Though reconstruction efforts began immediately after the war, many of its original landmarks are still lost today; under the Intramuros Administration, Intramuros is still in the process of postwar reconstruction and revival of its cultural heritage.

While Intramuros is no longer the seat of the contemporary Philippine government, several Philippine government agencies are headquartered in Intramuros. Moreover, Intramuros remains a significant educational center as part of the city&#x27;s University Belt. Several offices of the Philippine Catholic Church are also found in the district.

Intramuros was designated a National Historical Landmark in 1951. The fortifications of Intramuros were declared National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines, owing to its historic and cultural significance. San Agustín Church, one of four UNESCO World Heritage Sites under the entry Baroque Churches of the Philippines, is located within the walled district. Intramuros and other historical sites in Manila are currently being proposed by the UNESCO Philippine National Commission to the country&#x27;s tentative list for future UNESCO World Heritage Site inscription as The Walled City and Historic Monuments of Manila.

==History==

=== Pre-Hispanic period ===
The strategic location of Manila along the bay and at the mouth of the Pasig River made it an ideal location for the Tagalog tribes and kingdoms to trade with merchants from what would be today&#x27;s China, India, Borneo, and Indonesia. The prehistoric polity of Maynila was located where Intramuros would be built.

In 1564, Spanish explorers led by Miguel López de Legazpi sailed from New Spain, now Mexico, and arrived on the island of Cebu in April 1565, establishing the first Spanish capitania in the Philippines. Having heard from the natives about the rich resources in Maynila, Legazpi dispatched two of his lieutenant-commanders, Martín de Goiti and Juan de Salcedo, to explore the island of Luzon.

The Spaniards arrived on the island of Luzon in 1570. After quarrels and misunderstandings between the Muslim natives and the Spaniards, they fought for control of the land and settlements. After several months of warfare the natives were defeated, and the Spaniards made a peace pact with the councils of Rajah Sulaiman III, Lakan Dula, and Rajah Matanda who handed over the city to the Spaniards.

===Spanish colonial period (1571–1898)===


Legazpi declared the area of Manila as the new capital of the Spanish colony on June 24, 1571, because of its strategic location and rich resources. He also proclaimed the sovereignty of the Monarchy of Spain over the whole archipelago. King Philip II of Spain delighted at the new conquest achieved by Legazpi and his men, awarding the city a coat of arms and declaring it as: &quot;Ciudad Insigne y Siempre Leal&quot; (English: &quot;Distinguished and Ever Loyal City&quot;). It was settled and became the political, military, and religious center of the Spanish Empire in Asia.

The city was in constant danger of natural and man-made disasters and worse, attacks from foreign invaders. In 1574, a fleet of Chinese pirates led by Limahong attacked the city and destroyed it before the Spaniards drove them away. The colony had to be rebuilt again by the survivors. These attacks prompted the construction of the wall.

The city of stone began during the rule of Governor-General Santiago de Vera. The city was planned and executed by Jesuit Priest Antonio Sedeno in accordance with the Laws of the Indies and was approved by King Philip II&#x27;s Royal Ordinance that was issued in San Lorenzo de El Escorial, Spain. The succeeding governor-general, Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas brought with him from Spain the royal instructions to carry into effect the said decree stating that &quot;to enclose the city with stone and erect a suitable fort at the junction of the sea and river&quot;. Leonardo Iturriano, a Spanish military engineer specializing in fortifications, headed the project. Chinese and Filipino workers built the walls.

Fort Santiago was rebuilt and a circular fort, known as Nuestra Senora de Guia, was erected to defend the land and sea on the southwestern side of the city. Funds came from a monopoly on playing cards and fines imposed on its excessive play. Chinese goods were taxed for two years. Designed by Geronimo Tongco and Pedro Jusepe, construction of the walls began on 1590 and continued under many governor-generals until 1872. By the middle of 1592, Dasmarinas wrote the King about the satisfactory development of the new walls and fortification. Since the construction was carried on during different periods and often far apart, the walls were not built according to any uniform plan.

Improvements continued during the terms of the succeeding Governor-Generals. Governor-General Juan de Silva executed certain work on the fortifications in 1609 which was improved by Juan Niño de Tabora in 1626, and by Diego Fajardo Chacón in 1644. The erection of the &quot;Baluarte de San Diego&quot; was also completed that year, replacing the Nuestra Senora de Guia. This bastion, shaped like an &quot;ace of spades&quot; is the southernmost point of the wall and the first of the large bastions added to the encircling walls, then of no great height nor of finished construction. Ravelins and &quot;reductos&quot; were added to strengthen weak areas and serve as outer defenses. A moat was built around the city with the Pasig River serving as a natural barrier on one side. By the 18th century, the city was totally enclosed. The last construction works were completed by the start of the 19th century.

====Inside colonial Intramuros====
The main square of the city of Manila was &quot;Plaza Mayor&quot; (later known as Plaza McKinley then &quot;Plaza de Roma&quot;) in front of the Manila Cathedral. East of the plaza was the &quot;Ayuntamiento&quot; (City Hall) and facing it was the Palacio del Gobernador, the official residence of the Spanish viceroyalties to the Philippines. An earthquake on June 3, 1863, destroyed the three buildings and much of the city. The residence of the Governor-General was moved to Malacañang Palace located about up on the Pasig River. The two previous buildings were later rebuilt but not the Governor&#x27;s Palace.

Inside the walls were other Roman Catholic churches, the oldest being San Agustin Church (Augustinians) built in 1607. The other churches built by the different religious orders – San Nicolas de Tolentino Church (Recollects), San Francisco Church (Franciscans), Third Venerable Order Church (Third Order of St. Francis), Santo Domingo Church (Dominican), Lourdes Church (Capuchins), and the San Ignacio Church (Jesuits) – has made the small walled city the &quot;City of Churches&quot;. Intramuros was the center of large educational institutions in the Philippines.

Convents and church-run schools were established by the different religious orders. The Dominicans established the Universidad de Santo Tomás in 1611 and the Colegio de San Juan de Letrán in 1620. The Jesuits established the Universidad de San Ignacio in 1590, the first university in the Philippines. It closed in 1768, following the expulsion of the Jesuits in the Philippines. After the Jesuits were allowed to return to the Philippines, they established the Ateneo Municipal de Manila in 1859. In the initial period of colonization, there were a total of 1,200 Spanish families living in the vicinity of Intramuros, 600 Spanish families within the walls and another 600 living in the suburbs outside Intramuros. In addition to this were about 400 Spanish soldiers garrisoned at the walled city.

===American period (1898–1946)===
After the end of the Spanish–American War, Spain surrendered the Philippines and several other territories to the United States as part of the terms of the Treaty of Paris for $20 million. The American flag was raised at Fort Santiago on August 13, 1898, indicating the start of American rule over the city. The Ayuntamiento became the seat of the Philippine Commission of the United States in 1901. Fort Santiago became the headquarters of the Philippine Division of the United States Army.

The Americans made drastic changes to Manila, such as in 1903, when the walls from the Santo Domingo Gate up to the Almacenes Gate were removed as the wharf on the southern bank of the Pasig River was improved. The stones removed were used for other construction happening around the city.

The walls were breached in four areas to ease access to the city: the southwestern end of &quot;Calle Aduana&quot; (now Andres Soriano Jr. Ave.); the eastern end of &quot;Calle Anda&quot;; the northeastern end of &quot;Calle Victoria&quot; (previously known as &quot;Calle de la Escuela&quot;); and the southeastern end of &quot;Calle Palacio&quot; (now General Luna Street). The double moats that surrounded Intramuros were deemed unsanitary and were filled in with mud dredged from Manila Bay, where the present Port of Manila is now located. The moats were transformed into a municipal golf course by the city.

Reclamations for the construction of the Port of Manila, the Manila Hotel, and Rizal Park obscured the old walls and skyline of the city from Manila Bay. The Americans also founded the first school under the new government, the Manila High School, on June 11, 1906, along Victoria Street.

In 1936, Commonwealth Act No. 171 was passed requiring that all future buildings to be constructed in Intramuros adopt Spanish colonial type architecture.

====World War II and Japanese occupation====

In December 1941, the Imperial Japanese Army invaded the Philippines. The first casualties in Intramuros were the destruction of Santo Domingo Church and the original University of Santo Tomas campus during an assault. The whole city of Manila was declared by General Douglas MacArthur as an open city as Manila was indefensible.

In January 1945, the battle for the liberation of Manila began when American troops returned. Intense urban fighting occurred between the combined American and Filipino troops under the United States Army and Philippine Commonwealth Army including recognized guerrillas, against the 30,000 Japanese defenders. As the battle continued, both sides inflicted heavy damage on the city culminating with the Manila massacre by Japanese troops.

The Imperial Japanese Army was pushed back, eventually retreating into the Intramuros district. General MacArthur, though opposed to the bombing of the walled city, approved heavy shelling, which resulted in deaths of over 16,665 Japanese within Intramuros.
Two of the eight gates of Intramuros were badly damaged by American tanks. The bombings levelled most of Intramuros, leaving only 5% of the city structures. 40% of the walls were destroyed in the bombings. Over 100,000 Filipino men, women and children died from February 3 to March 3, 1945, during the Battle of Manila.

At the end of World War II, all of the buildings and structures in Intramuros were destroyed, with only the damaged San Agustin Church still standing.

===Contemporary period (1946–present)===


In 1951, Intramuros was declared a historical monument and Fort Santiago, a national shrine with Republic Act 597, with the policy of restoring, reconstructing, and urban planning of Intramuros. In 1956, Republic Act 1607 declared Intramuros a &quot;commercial, residential and educational district&quot;, opening up the district to development disregarding the historicity of the area. The same law also repealed Commonwealth Act No. 171 and Republic Act No. 597. Several laws and decrees also followed but results were deemed unsatisfactory due to limited funds.

In 1979, the Intramuros Administration (IA) was created by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 1616, signed by President Ferdinand Marcos on April 10 of that year.

Since then, the IA has been slowly restoring the walls, the sub-features of the fortification, and the city within. The remaining five original gates have been restored or rebuilt: Isabel II Gate, Parian Gate, Real Gate, Santa Lucía Gate and the Postigo Gate. The entrances made by the Americans by breaching the walls at four locations are now spanned by walkways thereby creating a connection, seamless in design and character to the original walls. Buildings destroyed during the war were subsequently rebuilt: Manila Cathedral was rebuilt and was opened to the public in 1958, Ayuntamiento de Manila was rebuilt in 2013, while the San Ignacio Church and Convent is currently being reconstructed as the Museo de Intramuros.

In January 2015, during Pope Francis&#x27;s visit to the Philippines, he led a mass at the Manila Cathedral that was attended by an estimated 2,000 bishops, priests and religious leaders of the Philippine Catholic Church. Anthology, an annual 3-day festival about architecture and design, was first launched in June 2016 at Intramuros. Since then, it has been renting Fort Santiago as a venue where seminars and other activities were held, with guest speakers from local and international people from the field of architecture and design. It is made possible through the partnership of WTA Architecture + Design Studio and the Intramuros Administration, who are also responsible for the critically acclaimed the Book Stop Intramuros located in Plaza Roma.

The Department of Tourism along with the Intramuros Administration launched the first major project of the newly created Faith Sector that focuses on the historic and cultural religious wealth of the Walled City. For the 2018 lenten season, seven religious destinations can be visited. For the first time since World War II, &quot;Visita Iglesia&quot; is once again possible in Intramuros. The seven destinations are the Manila Cathedral, San Agustin Church, San Ignacio Church, Guadalupe Shrine in Fort Santiago, Knights of Columbus Fr. Willman Chapel, Lyceum of the Philippines University Chapel, and the Mapua University Chapel. The event pays homage to the original seven churches during the prewar Intramuros. The 2018 lenten season event draws Infinite People from both foreign and local tourists in Intramuros. The Intramuros Administration, together with the Royal Danish Embassy in Manila, and Felta Multimedia, Inc., opened the iMake History Fortress at the Baluarte de Santa Barbara in Fort Santiago last March 19, 2018. The facility is the first history-based Lego education center in the world.

The COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 caused the Intramuros Administration to temporarily close several sites within Intramuros including Fort Santiago, Museo de Intramuros, and Casa Manila.

==City walls==

The stone outline of the defensive wall of Intramuros is irregular in shape, following the contours of Manila Bay and the curvature of the Pasig River. The Muralla walls covered an area of of land, surrounded by thick stones and high walls that rise to . The walls stretched to an estimated 3-5 kilometers in length. An inner moat &quot;(foso)&quot; surrounds the perimeter of the wall and an outer moat &quot;(contrafoso)&quot; surrounds the walls that face the city.

===Defense structures===
Several bulwarks (&quot;baluarte&quot;), ravelins (&quot;ravellin&quot;) and redoubts (&quot;reductos&quot;) are strategically located along the massive walls of Intramuros following the design of medieval fortifications. The seven bastions (clockwise, from Fort Santiago) are the Bastions of Tenerias, Aduana, San Gabriel, San Lorenzo, San Andres, San Diego, and Plano. The bastions were constructed at different periods of time, the reason for the differences in style. The oldest bastion is the Bastion de San Diego, which was built in 1587.

The fortifications of Intramuros comprises several parts, the front facing the sea and the river, which were less elaborate and complex, and the three-sided land front with its corresponding bastions. Fort Santiago was built at the northwest tip where the sea and river converge, and this functioned as a citadel. Fort Santiago has significantly served as military headquarters of Spanish, British, United States and Japan during different eras throughout the Philippine history.

In Fort Santiago, there are bastions on each corner of the triangular fort. The &quot;Baluarte de Santa Bárbara&quot; faces the bay and Pasig River; &quot;Baluarte de San Miguel&quot;, faces the bay; and the &quot;Medio Baluarte de San Francisco&quot;, which faces the Pasig River.

=== Gates ===


Before the American Era, entrance to the city was through eight gates or &quot;Puertas&quot;. They were, clockwise, from Fort Santiago, &quot;Puerta Almacenes&quot;, &quot;Puerta de la Aduana&quot;, &quot;Puerta de Santo Domingo&quot;, &quot;Puerta Isabel II&quot;, &quot;Puerta del Parian&quot;, &quot;Puerta Real&quot;, &quot;Puerta Sta. Lucia&quot;, and &quot;Puerta del Postigo&quot;. Three of the gates were destroyed. Two of them, the Almacenes Gate and the Santo Domingo/Customs Gate, were destroyed by American engineers when they open up the northern part of the walls to the wharves.

The Banderas Gate was destroyed during an earthquake and was never rebuilt. Formerly, drawbridges were raised and the city was closed and under the watch of sentinels from 11:00 pm until 4:00 am. It continued so until 1852, when, in consequence of the earthquake of that year, it was decreed that the gates should remain open night and day.

==Present day Intramuros==
Intramuros is the only district of Manila where old Spanish-era influences are still plentiful. Fort Santiago is now a well-maintained park and popular tourist destination. Adjacent to Fort Santiago is the reconstructed Maestranza Wall, which was removed by the Americans in 1903 to widen the wharves thus opening the city to Pasig River. One of the future plans of the Intramuros Administration is to complete the perimeter walls that surround the city making it completely circumnavigable from the walkway on top of the walls.

There has been minimal commercialization occurring within the district, despite restoration efforts. A few fast food establishments set up shop at the turn of the 21st century, catering mostly to the student population within Intramuros. Shipping companies have also set up offices inside the district. Concerts, tours and exhibitions are frequently held within Intramuros to draw both local and foreign tourists.

===Register of Styles===
The Intramuros Register of Styles is the main architectural code of Intramuros, the historic core of the City of Manila, Philippines. It became part of Presidential Decree No. 1616, as amended, when it was gazetted by the Official Gazette of the Philippines on June 17, 2022. The Intramuros Administration is the agency of the Philippine Government responsible for the implementation of the Register of Styles.

Intramuros in Manila is the only locality in the Philippines where, for cultural reasons, the use, height, scale, and aesthetics of all new constructions and development are pre-determined and strictly regulated under the force of a national law. The Register of Styles, as an integral part of Presidential Decree No. 1616, is the main legal document prescribing and guiding the implementation of pre-war architectural colonial styles in Intramuros.

The Register of Styles is the first document to detail the historical styles of Intramuros. It was authored by Rancho Arcilla, who was then the Archivist of the Intramural Administration, and under the initiative of Guiller Asido, the former Administrator of Intramuros. Being an integral part of Presidential Decree No. 1616, the Register of Styles is the only architectural stylebook in the Philippines with the force and potency of a national law.

By form, the urban landscape of Intramuros mostly lacked setbacks, with buildings that were mostly terraced (rowhouses). Courtyards or backyards were exceptionally well adapted to the climate. By style Intramuros was described as both vernacular and cosmopolitan. While its Church and State buildings were European in orientation, albeit adapted and localized, most of the buildings enclaved within its walls embraced tropical vernacular constructions as exemplified by the Bahay na bato. Churches, fortifications, and palaces fashioned in European styles, though few, became icons and objects of popular imagination. In contrast, the vernacular Bahay na Bato, which was adopted in majority of buildings, prevailed in terms of number of constructions. Except in certain instances, the Register of Styles prescribes tha Bahay na bato as the default style for new constructions in Intramuros.

The Register of Styles prescribes the Bahay na bato as the default style for new constructions in Intramuros. It explicitly recognized the Bahay na Bato as the dominant architectural typology of Intramuros during the Spanish colonial era until the destruction of the Walled City in 1945 during the Second World War. Pursuant to the Intramuros Register of Styles, new constructions in Intramuros that do not follow the Bahay na Bato typology may only be allowed only in specific locations where a Non-Bahay na Bato structure (e.g. a Neoclassical building) was known to exist. Otherwise, new constructions are required to follow the Bahay na Bato type.

===Education===
The center of education since the colonial period, Manila — particularly Intramuros — is home to several Philippine universities and colleges as well as its oldest ones. It served as the home of the University of Santo Tomas (1611), Colegio de San Juan de Letran (1620), Ateneo de Manila University (1859), Lyceum of the Philippines University and Mapúa University. The University of Santo Tomas transferred to a new campus at Sampaloc in 1927, and Ateneo left Intramuros for Loyola Heights, Quezon City (while still retaining &quot;de Manila&quot; in its name) in 1952.

New non-sectarian schools were established and built over the ruins after the war. The Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila, established in 1965 by the city government of Manila, was built at the site of the old &quot;Cuartel España&quot; (Spanish Barracks). The Lyceum of the Philippines University, a private university founded in 1952 by Philippine President Jose P. Laurel, was built over the lot of San Juan de Dios Hospital. The hospital moved out to Roxas Boulevard in Pasay.

The Mapúa University, which was founded in 1925 in Quiapo, Manila moved in Intramuros after the war. Its postwar campus was built on the location of the destroyed San Francisco Church and the Third Venerable Order Church at the corner of San Francisco and Solana Streets. The three new educational institutions, along with Colegio de San Juan de Letran formed an academic cooperation called the Intramuros Consortium.

===Churches===

Intramuros, as the seat of religious and political power during the colonial period, was the home to eight grand churches built by different religious orders. All but one of these churches were destroyed in the Battle of Manila. Only San Agustin Church, the oldest building in existence in Manila completed in 1607, was the only structure inside the Walled City not to be destroyed during the war. The Manila Cathedral, the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila, was reconstructed in 1958.

The other religious orders reconstructed their churches outside Intramuros after the war. The Dominicans rebuilt Santo Domingo Church on Quezon Avenue in Quezon City. The Augustinian Recollects moved to their other church, the San Sebastian Church (now Basilica), northeast of the Muralla, walled city. The Capuchins moved the Lourdes Church in 1951 to the corner of Kanlaon St. and Retiro St. (now Amoranto Ave.) in Quezon City. It was declared a National Shrine in 1997. The Order of Saint John of God moved to Roxas while the Order of Poor Clares in Aurora Boulevard. The San Ignacio Church and Convent is now currently being reconstructed as Museo de Intramuros, an ecclesiastical museum.

===Monuments and statues===
World War II, along with various disasters, has led to the destruction of numerous historical monuments and statues. However, several monuments have managed to withstand and the ones that remain can still be visited today in Intramuros. Other statues and monuments have been added as a testament to the area&#x27;s rich history.

==Administration==

=== Intramuros Administration ===
The Intramuros Administration (IA) is an agency of the Department of Tourism that is mandated to orderly restore, administer, and develop the historic walled area of Intramuros that is situated within the modern City of Manila as well as to insure that the 16th to 19th century Philippine-Spanish architecture remains the general architectural style of the walled area. The Intramuros Administration oversee the day-to-day administration of the district, including the issuance of building permits, traffic re-routing, among others. Its office is located at Palacio del Gobernador in Plaza Roma.

=== Barangays ===
Intramuros is composed of five barangays numbered 654 to 658. These five barangays only serve the welfare of the city&#x27;s constituents because they neither have executive nor legislative powers.

Barangays 654, 655, and 656 are part of Zone 69 of the City of Manila, while barangays 657 and 658 are part of Zone 70.

<text>Sir Richard van der Riet Woolley OBE FRS (24 April 1906 – 24 December 1986) was an English astronomer who became the eleventh Astronomer Royal. His mother&#x27;s maiden name was Van der Riet.

==Biography==

Woolley was born in Weymouth, Dorset and attended Allhallows College, then in Honiton, for about 18 months, but then moved with his parents to the Union of South Africa upon their retirement. There he attended and received his degree in Mathematics and Physics from the University of Cape Town. Woolley returned to the United Kingdom and studied for a further MA degree in Mathematics and, later, a PhD at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. After two years at Mount Wilson Observatory he again returned to the United Kingdom in 1931.

From 1937 to 1939, he was Senior Assistant Observer and John Couch Adams Astronomer at the Cambridge Observatory.

Woolley specialized in solar astronomy and in 1939 he was appointed director of the Commonwealth Solar Observatory in Canberra, Australia. He later returned to the United Kingdom to take up his appointment as Astronomer Royal from 1956 to 1971.

Woolley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1953 and won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society 
in 1971. 
From 1972 to 1976 he was director of the new South African Astronomical Observatory. He retired in the late 1970s and spent most of his retirement in South Africa.

Woolley was appointed an OBE in 1953 and knighted in 1963.

==Views on the practicality of space flight==

Woolley is known for his initial disbelief in the practicalities of space flight, a notion he shared with Sir Harold Spencer Jones, his predecessor as Astronomer Royal. In a 1936 book review of P.E. Cleator&#x27;s &quot;Rockets Through Space&quot;, Woolley wrote:
&quot;The whole procedure [of shooting rockets into space]...presents difficulties of so fundamental a nature, that we are forced to dismiss the notion as essentially impracticable, in spite of the author&#x27;s insistent appeal to put aside prejudice and to recollect the supposed impossibility of heavier-than-air flight before it was actually accomplished&quot;

On appointment as Astronomer Royal, he reiterated his long-held view that &quot;space travel is utter bilge&quot;. Speaking to &quot;Time&quot; in 1956, Woolley noted
&quot;It&#x27;s utter bilge. I don&#x27;t think anybody will ever put up enough money to do such a thing . . . What good would it do us? If we spent the same amount of money on preparing first-class astronomical equipment we would learn much more about the universe . . . It is all rather rot&quot;

Woolley&#x27;s protestations came just one year prior to the launch of Sputnik 1, five years before the start of the Apollo Program, and thirteen years before the first human landing on the Moon.

In a 1995 letter to &quot;New Scientist&quot;, J.A. Terry and John Rudge pointed out that the quotation ascribed to Woolley is actually a misquotation of what he actually said (as they had heard themselves on &quot;Radio Newsreel&quot;). Terry and Rudge report that Woolley&#x27;s statement was: &quot;All this talk about space travel is utter bilge, really.&quot; Woolley went on to say: &quot;It would cost as much as a major war just to put a man on the moon.&quot; Terry and Rudge assert that Woolley&#x27;s latter prediction turned out to be quite accurate, and state that the deletion of the first four words of the quotation by newspaper editors was in reaction to the fact that it was those self-same newspaper&#x27;s hyperbolic articles, talking about space travel, that Woolley was criticising. &quot;Anyone&quot;, said Terry and Rudge, &quot;who had seen the flamboyant articles about space travel and the imminent colonisation of the moon and planets that were splashed all over the newspapers in 1956, with science fiction-style illustrations, must have been immediately aware of what the new Astronomer Royal was riled about.&quot;

The municipality covers an area of of which is water. The population density is . The municipality is unilingually Swedish.

Godby, the largest village and administrative centre of Finström, is the second biggest built-up area in Åland after Mariehamn, inhabited by around 1300 people, or one-thirds of the municipality&#x27;s population. A pharmacy, banks, a post office, a swimming hall and a health center are among the amenities that can be found in Godby.

==History==
Finström was widely inhabited in the Viking Age. The church of St. Michael is one of the oldest in Åland with the oldest parts dating from the 12th century. Grelsby kungsgård was the place where king Gustavus Vasa stayed with his entourage of 312 people for a few days in the spring of 1556. Swedish king Gustaf IV Adolf also stayed there for six weeks in the summer of 1808 prior to the 1809 loss of Finland to Russia. During the Finnish Civil War several communists were executed outside Godby, on the ice of Färjsundet.

==Geography==
Finström is right in the middle of mainland Åland and is bordered by a total of five municipalities: Sund to the east, Saltvik to the northeast, Geta to the north, Hammarland to the west and Jomala to the south. The most significant main roads of Finström are Highway 2 between Mariehamn and Sund, and Highway 4 to Geta.

Långsjön, the largest lake in Åland, is located in the municipality, as is the Almskogen nature reserve. Notable bays include Kasviken and Ödkarbyviken.

==Economy==
Godby is by far the center of Finström&#x27;s economy. The biggest employer in the municipality is Optinova, a plastic factory with 130 employees. Tourism is also an important line of business.

Agricultural products grown especially in the northern parts of Finström include apples and various vegetables, and fishing is also a source of income for some.

<doc id="771545" wikidata="Q1358690" url="?curid=771545" title="Panda Express">
<text>Panda Express is an American fast food restaurant chain that specializes in American Chinese cuisine. With over 2,400 locations, it is the largest Asian-segment restaurant chain in the United States, and is mainly located in North America and Asia. Panda Express restaurants were traditionally located in shopping mall food courts, but the chain now operates units in many other environments and formats, including stand-alone restaurants, as well as universities, casinos, airports, military bases, amusement parks and other venues.

The chain offers a variety of American-Chinese dishes, including orange chicken, sweet fire chicken breast, Beijing beef, grilled teriyaki chicken, and Kung Pao chicken, with certain premium dishes such as honey walnut shrimp and black pepper Angus steak having additional costs for the patron. The company is headquartered in Rosemead, California. The Panda Express brand is a casual, fast-food variation of corporate sibling Panda Inn, which is a chain of upscale, table service restaurants.

== History ==


The Panda Restaurant Group, parent company of Panda Inn, Panda Express, and Hibachi-San, was founded by Andrew Cherng, Peggy Cherng and Andrew&#x27;s father, Master Chef Ming Tsai Cherng. Andrew Cherng and his father are Chinese born, while Peggy was born in Burma and raised in Hong Kong. Both Andrew and Peggy Cherng are alumni of Baker University in Baldwin City, Kansas (where they first met).

Andrew went into business with his father in the United States in 1973, opening their first Panda Inn restaurant in Pasadena, California. At the beginning, business was lacking to the degree that Andrew had to offer special deals and freebies so that customers would dine at Panda Inn. In 1982, Peggy joined Andrew in the restaurant business. While operating Panda Inn, Andrew became acquainted with then-UCLA head football coach Terry Donahue, as well as Terry&#x27;s brother Dan, who happened to be in the real estate business. It was because of this connection that in 1983, Donahue Schriber Real Estate, the manager of the Glendale Galleria, invited the Cherngs to develop a fast-food version of Panda Inn for the Galleria&#x27;s food court, and Panda Express was launched that October. A second location was opened two years later at the Westside Pavilion in 1985. The chain has steadily expanded across the United States since then. Chef Andy Kao claims to have developed the original Chinese-American orange chicken recipe at a Panda Express in Hawaii in 1987.

At first, Panda Express restaurants were found solely in food courts in major shopping malls. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Cherngs began experimenting with supermarket-based branches, through a deal with Vons, and then stand-alone restaurant locations. In 1997, the company opened its first stand-alone, drive-through restaurant, in Hesperia, California. Today less than 2% of its restaurants are in malls.

In the late 2000s, the Cherngs began implementing play areas, known as the Panda Express Play Places, which had been developed in the late 90&#x27;s by their business partner, Reginald Schwaab. The Play Places were a major success primarily in the East coast of America, where the chain made continued successes. Due to covid and increased costs in regard to upkeep, the play places were removed from the chain in August of 2020.

Because Peggy had worked for several years as a software designer and engineer for defense contractors like McDonnell Douglas, Panda Express computerized its operations early on. Peggy also brought a systems analysis perspective to the business and worked through the logistics and standardization issues necessary to scale up the concept.

In 2005, Panda Express began to open units in food courts on college campuses, some of which participate in the residential student meal plans. In 2008, the Cherngs were the recipients of the City of Angels Award, given by the LAX Coastal Area Chamber of Commerce, for their contributions to the greater Los Angeles area. As of 2007, the company&#x27;s highest revenue location, bringing in over annually, was located at the Ala Moana Center food court in Honolulu, Hawaii.

On the ABC News TV program &quot;Nightline&quot;, April 18, 2011, there was a feature segment on Panda Express and its success. The segment described how Andrew Cherng encourages his workers and management to go through self-help programs emphasizing Landmark Education.

In 2011, a suit was filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against Panda Express because it was reportedly treating its Hispanic employees differently than Asian employees. In June 2013, it was announced that the restaurant chain will pay $150,000 to settle another EEOC action on behalf of at least three female teenagers who were allegedly sexually harassed between 2007 and 2009 by one male kitchen supervisor in Kauai, Hawaii. In addition to the fines, Panda Express revised its policies and was required to provide anti-discrimination and sexual harassment training for employees.

Later that year, Panda Express opened its first location in the western Pacific by opening a location in the American territory of Guam. The first location in the state of Alaska was later opened in December 2015.

As of 2017, the Panda Restaurant Group had annual sales of over $3 billion and close to 39,000 employees. The Cherngs also opened Panda Innovation Kitchen in Pasadena with their daughter, Andrea Cherng, overlooking a majority of the restaurant&#x27;s business. The idea for Panda Innovation Kitchen is to experiment with new flavours and ingredients to come up with new menu items. In addition, they also opened a tea bar to introduce Taiwanese drinks such as boba milk tea and new drinks like the Fortune Cookie Shake.

In December 2017, Panda Express had opened the chain&#x27;s 2,000th location, which is located in New York City near Columbia University.

In February of 2022, Panda Restaurant Group filed a U.S. trademark application for the name PANDAVERSE for “downloadable virtual goods, namely, food items and beverages for use in virtual worlds&quot; and &quot;virtual food and beverage products.” The filing marked an intention to expand the Panda Express brand into the Metaverse.

== International ==
Panda Express also operates in Canada, Saudi Arabia, Guatemala, Japan, Mexico, El Salvador, the Philippines, South Korea, and the United Arab Emirates. The first location in Mexico opened in Mexico City in September 2011.

In October 2013, the first Panda Express located in Canada opened on Hunt Club Road in Nepean, Ontario, but has since closed. The first location in Calgary was opened in October 2016.

On May 26, 2014, it was reported by Arabian Business news that Panda Express would be opening a restaurant in the United Arab Emirates. The first Panda Express restaurant in the Middle East was open in Dubai in November 2014.

The first location in South Korea was opened in Seoul in September 2014 as a joint venture with Seoul-based SF Innovation Co.

In July 2016, Panda Express opened its first location in Guatemala, in Guatemala City.

In September 2017, Panda Express opened its first location on the Dutch Caribbean country of Aruba at the Queen Beatrix International Airport.

Although it is unknown when Panda Express opened its first restaurant in Saudi Arabia, a second Panda Express in Saudi Arabia opened in Riyadh in January 2018. Both Saudi Arabian restaurants, as well as the ones in United Arab Emirates are operated by Gourmet Gulf.

In July 2018, Panda Express entered El Salvador for the first time by opening two locations in the capital city of San Salvador.

In September 2018, Panda Express announced its joint venture with Jollibee Foods Corporation to bring its stores in the Philippines. A year later, in December 2019, the first Panda Express restaurant in the Philippines opened at SM Megamall in Mandaluyong. More branches were opened, all located in the Greater Manila Area.

The first Panda Express in Russia opened in Moscow in September 2018. However, in March 2022, Panda Express has ceased all corporate support, including operations, marketing, and supply chain in response to the Russian war against Ukraine.

Panda Express previously had eight sites in Japan that were operated under a franchise agreement that later lapsed. In November 2016, the company returned to the country by opening a new restaurant in Kawasaki. This restaurant is operated as part of a joint partnership with Ippudo. As of August 2022, were nine restaurants in the country.

In October 2020, the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; reported that a fake Panda Express restaurant in the southwestern Chinese city of Kunming had been reported for trademark infringement, and was closed during an investigation. The reportedly fake restaurant used the same Panda Express logo, and its menu reportedly included the same Kung Pao Chicken and Tangerine Peel Chicken as the company&#x27;s restaurants.

In August 2022, Panda Express opened its first European site in Kaiserslautern Military Community Center food court, Ramstein Air Base, Germany.

==Philanthropy==
In 1999, Panda Express launched Panda Cares to &quot;give back to the community&quot;. They provide funding, food and volunteer services to children in need and disaster relief efforts. The company installed donation boxes in all the Panda Express restaurants in 2010. The charity has raised $107 million, with $89 million coming from in-store donation boxes, and $41 million has been donated to &quot;The Leader In Me&quot;, a program to teach leadership and life skills that has been rolled out to 865 elementary schools in 39 states. The organization has also donated $37 million to Children&#x27;s Miracle Network Hospitals, to support medical costs for poor children, and also supports disaster relief efforts.

<doc id="771546" wikidata="Q1459470" url="?curid=771546" title="List of political parties in Finland">
<text>This article is a list of political parties in Finland, which includes Finland&#x27;s national-level political parties and excludes local and provincial parties (such as the parties of Åland). A party is defined as a political association whose existence is recorded in the Ministry of Justice&#x27;s party register.

Finland has a multi-party system. Coalition governments which comprise a majority of seats in the Parliament of Finland are the norm. Those parties which are not in government are called the opposition. Due to the lack of an electoral threshold, many parties are usually represented in Parliament. As a result, it is all but impossible for one party to win a majority. Additionally, the parties usually cannot win enough seats between them to form a governing coalition on their own. Most Finnish governments, particularly since World War II, have thus been grand coalitions comprising parties stretching across the political spectrum.

Parties work in parliamentary groups (&quot;eduskuntaryhmät&quot;), usually voting with party discipline, which is, however, not absolute.

Parties are composed of local chapters based in municipalities. In municipalities, which are fundamental administrative units in the country, parties hold seats in the municipal councils, but often have to compete for them with local non-party groups (independents).

Finnish law states that a political association which fulfills certain conditions is eligible to become a political party free of charge. Among these conditions are:

* that the primary purpose of the association is to affect governmental affairs,
* that it has received at least 5,000 votes in any parliamentary, municipal, county, or European Parliament election,
* that the association&#x27;s rules secure the following of democratic principles in its decision making and activities,
* and that it has a general program based on these rules which expresses the association&#x27;s principles and goals regarding its actions in governmental affairs.

A registered party may nominate candidates in any national and local elections, and a party that is represented in parliament is entitled to a government subsidy relative to its number of seats. To qualify as a registered party, an association must have bylaws guaranteeing democratic internal organization and must be able to present 5,000 signatures from its supporters who are eligible to vote. A party that fails to win a single seat in two consecutive parliamentary elections is stricken from the register, but may apply again.

<text>Kizhi (, ; ) is an island near the geometrical center of Lake Onega in the Republic of Karelia (Medvezhyegorsky District), Russia. It is elongated from north to south and is about long, wide and is about away from the capital of Karelia, Petrozavodsk.

Settlements and churches on the island were known from at least the 15th century. The population was rural, but was forced by the government to assist development of the ore mining and iron plants in the area that resulted in a major Kizhi Uprising in 1769–1771. Most villages had disappeared from the island by the 1950s and now only a small rural settlement remains. In the 18th century, two major churches and a bell tower were built on the island, which are now known as Kizhi Pogost. In the 1950s, dozens of historical wooden buildings were moved to the island from various parts of Karelia for preservation purposes. Nowadays, the entire island and the nearby area form a national open-air museum with more than 80 historical wooden structures. The most famous is the Kizhi Pogost, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

==History==

===Name===
The name Kizhi is believed to originate from ancient Veps or Karelian word &quot;kizhat&quot; or &quot;kizhansuari&quot; (&quot;social gathering&quot; or &quot;island of games&quot;). In Russian, it can be pronounced with stress on either syllable; the stress on the ultimate syllable is grammatically incorrect in Karelian language.

===Industrial development===
Since at least the 14th century, the island was part of the exchange route between Novgorod and White Sea. The numerous settlements on Kizhi and neighboring islands (about 100 by the 16th century) comprised an administrative entity called Spas-Kizhi Pogost. Since the 13th and 14th century, the area acquired economical importance as a source of iron ores. By the early 18th century, as a consequence of the industrial reforms of Tzar Peter I, several ore mines and metallurgy plants were built on the Onega Lake, in particular on the place of modern Medvezhyegorsk and Petrozavodsk cities. Those plants required hard physical labor such as cutting forests for wood, coal burning, ground works, etc., which was mostly provided by the local peasants. The labor was forced; the disobeyed were punished by public beating and fines that sparked local riots. The largest one occurred in 1769–1771 and is known as Kizhi Uprising, which was sparked by a governor order to send peasants during the harvest season for works at Tivdiysk marble mine and construction of the Lizhemsky metallurgical plant. Peasants disobeyed and boycotted the order. They were soon joined by up to 40,000 people from all over Karelia led by Kliment Sobolev, Andrei Salnikov and Semen Kostin. The revolt was based in the Kizhi Pogost that resulted in its name. The peasants sent petitioners to St. Petersburg, but those were arrested and punished, and a military corps was sent to suppress the uprising. They arrived to Kizhi by the end of June, 1771, and after artillery fire the peasants quickly surrendered. The leaders and 50–70 other peasants were publicly beaten and sent to exile in Siberia. Many others were forced into military service, which was a form of punishment of the time. However, the recruitment of peasants for the construction of local plants and mineworks had stopped.

===Farming and other traditional activities===
From the early times, the most important occupation of the islanders was farming. All available area, about half of the island was converted to fields; from the remaining half, a quarter was rocky and the rest occupied by swamps. On one occasion in the 18th century, two villages were moved from Kizhi island to the nearby infertile mainland to free land for farming. Until 1970, the island had about of fields yielding various grains and potato, and combine harvesters and tractors for field cultivation. The farming was stopped in 1971 by a government directive. Some fields were reconstructed in 2004 as part of the Kizhi museum. Those fields are an exhibit demonstrating major steps of the farming and harvesting work.

Other traditional activities of the area included embroidery, making beaded jewelry, weaving (including traditional birch bark weaving), knitting, spinning, woodcarving (which included making traditional Russian wooden toys) and pottery.

===Original churches of Kizhi===


The first mentioning of churches on the island is dated to 1563. This document describes two domed wooden churches with a bell tower standing in the southern part of the island (on the site of the present Kizhi Pogost), and mentions their earlier description of 1496. A more detailed description was documented in 1628. In particular, contrary to the later, domed churches of the pogost, the first ones had pyramidal roofs. Those churches were burned by a fire caused by lightning in the end of the 17th century. The first church raised after the fire was the Church of the Intercession (, 1694) which was heated and held services all year long. It was reconstructed several times in 1720–1749 and in 1764 rebuilt into its present 9-dome design. In 1714, the 22-dome Transfiguration Church () was constructed and soon after the bell tower was added, thereby completing the Kizhi Pogost. The bell tower was entirely rebuilt in 1862. Much earlier, some time in the 17th century, a long fence was built around the churches, which then served as a protection ground against Swedish and Polish incursions.

Kizhi churches were built on stones, without a deep foundation. Their major basic structural unit is a round log of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) about in diameter and long. Many thousands logs were brought for construction from the mainland which was a complex logistical task at that time. The logs were cut and shaped with axes and assembled without nails, using interlocking corner joinery — either round notch or dovetail. Flat roofs were made of spruce planks and the domes are covered in aspen.

==Kizhi museum==

Open-air museum Kizhi is one of the first in Russia, which started functioning on the island in 1951 and currently contains about 87 wooden constructions. The most famous of them is the Kizhi Pogost, which contains two churches and a bell tower surrounded by a fence. The pogost was included in the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1990. Since 1951, a large number of historical buildings were moved to the island. They include Church of the Resurrection of Lazarus from Murom Monastery, which is regarded as the oldest remaining wooden church in Russia (second half of the 14th century), several bell towers, more than 20 peasant houses, mills, barns and saunas. In 1993, the museum was included into a short list a Russian Cultural Heritage sites. The museum contains more than 41,000 exhibits. Most of them are domestic artifacts: tools, dishes, utensils, furniture, etc. There are about 1000 icons of the 16th–19th centuries which includes Russia&#x27;s only collection of &quot;heavens&quot;. There are also church items, such as crosses early manuscript of 17th–19th centuries. The museum also contains exhibits of the 20th century, about 10,000 photographs and 1,500 drawings.

The museum conducts a wide range of scientific studies in the history, archeology, ecology, nature and other fields related to the island. It is based in Kizhi and Petrozavodsk, has an advanced web portal and a web camera on the island. Kizhi museum also publishes the monthly &quot;Kizhi newspaper&quot;. In summer, it runs week-long education courses at the school and university level.

===Church of the Resurrection of Lazarus===
Tradition says that the church was built by the monk Lazarus (1286 (?) – 1391) in the second half of the 14th century. The church became the first building of the future Murom Monastery located on the eastern shore of Lake Onega. Over time, the church became the main attractions of the monastery as it was reputed to miraculously cure illnesses. Clergy announced the monk Lazarus as a local saint, and every summer, on 23–24 June, the church was attracting pilgrims. The building is tall and has a perimeter of .
The original two-tier iconostasis of the church is preserved; it consists of 17 icons of 16th–18th centuries.

===Chapel of the Archangel Michael===
The Chapel of the Archangel Michael was moved to Kizhi in 1961 from the Lelikozero village.
It measures and has a rectangular frame elongated from east to west and a two-slope roof. Above the entrance hall there is a belfry capped with a pyramid roof. The iconostasis of the chapel has two tiers and contains icons of 17th–18th centuries.

==Demography==
By the end of the 16th century, there were 14 settlements on the island. By the early 1900s, their number reduced to nine, which were named Pogost, Bachurino, Bishevo, Bosarevo, Vasilyevo, Kyazhevo, Morozovo, Navolok and Yamka. By the end of World War II, seven of them disappeared and only Vasilyevo and Yamka remain. They are a part of the &quot;Kizhi rural settlement&quot; belonging to the larger Velikogubskoe rural settlement of Medvezhyegorsky District, Republic of Karelia, Russia.

==Settlements==

The pogost settlement is located near the Kizhi Pogost. It was first mentioned in the early 17th century; then it consisted of four houses, two of which were burned down during a local revolt. By 1678, the number of houses increased to seven, six of which belonged to the Pogost priests and one to a peasant. The settlement shrank to five houses by the early 1900s and disappeared by 1950. Nowadays, on their place stands a historical house of Oshevnev, which was moved here in 1951 from Oshevnevo village, and which became the first exhibit of the Kizhi museum opened in 1960.

Bachurino was named after a peasant Fedor Bachurin; between the 17th and 19th centuries, it contained only two houses which then grew to three. This settlement was the poorest on the island – in 1876, it owned only one horse and two cows, and in the early 20th century, only two cows for 24 people living there.

Bishevo settlement was located in the north-eastern part of the island. In 1563, it had one house but there were four houses there by 1678. In 1820, from eight men of the settlement, six were wealthy – the settlement had 5 horses, 11 cows and 4 sheep. In the early 1900s, there were only 4 horses and 3 cows for 11 people, and by 1950 the settlement had disappeared.

Bosarevo settlement was formed in 1858-1869 with one house of 11 people, which became two by 1911.

Kyazehvo settlement was located on the northernmost shore of the island and had two houses in 1563. One more was built by 1876, but the houses were small and had almost no animals. Thirteen people lived there by 1905.

Morozovo settlement was known since 1582 and contained one big house which was taken apart in 1950. Nearby, there is the Chapel of the Three Saints. It stands 22 metres tall with a perimeter of and was built in the late 18th century in the Kavgora village.

Navolok settlement was one of the largest and richest in the area with four houses in 1563 and seven from 1696. About 40 people lived there in the 19th century, most of whom were peasants but two were shoe makers and one carpenter. The settlement had a boat which was used for cargo.
While most Kizhi settlements were shrinking with time, Vasilyevo was growing from one house in 1840 to two in 1876, three in 1911 and five in 2009. Of the present five houses, two are original and others were moved here as museum exhibits. Near them, there is a historical Chapel of the Assumption of the Virgin () of 17th–18th century measuring .

Yamka settlement had two houses in 1563, both of which were burned down in 1616. They were rebuilt later and by 1911, the settlement was the largest on the island with 11 houses. One of its inhabitants, Semen Kostin, was a leader of the Kizhi Uprising of the 1769. One of his neighbors became a wealthy merchant and a regular donor to the reconstruction of the Kizhi churches. Apart from historical houses and barns, in Yamka there is a windmill built in 1930 and two chapels. The Chapel of Spas () measures . It was built in the 17th–18th centuries in Vigovo village and moved to Kizhi in the 1950s. Its style is similar to that of the Chapel of the Archangel Michael (see above). The Chapel of Petr and Pavel is smaller () and simpler in design. It was built in the early 18th century in the Tipinitsa village and then moved to Kizhi. Its interior could not be preserved.

==Geography and nature==

===Geology, flora and fauna===

The area of Kizhi island differs from most of other parts of Onega Lake. It is characterized by numerous small islands, which reduce the water flow, and relatively shallow and uneven lake bottom. Whereas the average depth of the lake is , the depth is about in the Kizhi and only in some places reaches . Because of the weak flows and shallow depth, water is relatively warm and quiet that promotes growth of aquatic vegetation. Fish types include roach, some gobies, crucian carp, sabre carp, perch, ruffe, pike, common dace, silver bream, Ide, gudgeon, carp bream, spined loach, European smelt, char, pike-perch, rudd and burbot.

Along the center of the island runs a narrow ridge, which is a remnant of the ice age. It has steep slopes in some parts and is up to tall. There are no forests on the island, but only individual trees of elm, spruce, pine, birch, aspen and alder. The trees host about 28 species of polypores (tree mushrooms), and there are more than 100 species of moss. Most of the island is covered in meadows, which are quite varied and rich in colors and species, including rare and protected. A large part of them are of legume family. Common are cow parsley, various species centaurea, tansy and verbascum densiflorum.

About 180 bird species from 15 families are known in the Kizhi area, and about 45 types of them were observed on the island. Most of them are migratory and stop on the island either for rest or nesting, such as swans, geese, ducks, lake seagulls, sterna, but there are also more stationary birds like house sparrow, Eurasian siskin, common chaffinch, skylark, jackdaw and crow. Among animals and amphibians, there are only newts (smooth newt and great crested newt), vipers, common lizard, frogs and toads (common frog, common toad and moor frog) and mice – the island is too small for larger animals which are abundant in the area.

===Climate===
The climate on the island is typical of the area, but is cold for most parts of the world. Low temperatures suppress bacterial activity, which is one of the major factors behind the longevity of the wooden structures of Kizhi.

===Access===
Although Kizhi island is within a kilometer distance from major islands and peninsulas of Onega lake, there are no major cities and transport routes nearby. Access to Kizhi is provided by hydrofoil (several trips a day from Petrozavodsk during the summer months), cruise ship, helicopter and snowcat (in the winter). Transportation over the island is mostly on foot. During the winter, snowmobiles are also used. On nearby islands there are several guesthouses. There is an 8-room (20 beds) wooden guest house and a restaurant on the island.

<text>A kennel club (known as a kennel council or canine council in some countries) is an organization for canine affairs that concerns itself with the breeding, showing and promotion of more than one breed of dog. Kennel clubs became popular in the mid 19th century. All-encompassing kennel clubs are also referred to as &#x27;all-breed clubs&#x27;, although &quot;all&quot; means only those breeds that they have decided to recognize, and &quot;breed&quot; means &quot;purebred&quot; dogs, not including dog hybrids and crossbreeds or mixed-breed dogs. A club that handles only one breed is known as a [[breed club (dog)|breed club]].

==Role==
Kennel clubs maintain breed standards, record pedigrees, and issue the rules for conformation dog shows and trials and accreditation of judges. They often serve as registries, which are lists of adult purebred dogs and lists of litters of puppies born to purebred parents. A kennel club manages all these aspects of the dog breeds it claims to represent, either directly or through its member bodies.

Today&#x27;s kennel clubs specialize in working dogs or conformation show dogs. In today&#x27;s parlance, dog clubs for mixed-breed dogs are gaining ground and are now sometimes categorized as kennel clubs. The original purpose of a kennel club, however, was the breeding and showing of conformation bench purebreds, and this remains the most widely accepted definition. Widely known kennel clubs such as The Kennel Club, the American Kennel Club, the United Kennel Club, and the Canadian Kennel Club each offer canine events and training programs as well as dog registration services.

==History==
By the mid-19th century, ownership of selectively bred dogs was common among the affluent throughout Europe.

Kennel clubs were founded from the necessity to bring order out of chaos to the sport of public competitive dog exhibitions. The first dog show in England was held in 1859, which was a social affair held by English aristocrats to raise funds for charity. They grew in popularity over fourteen years and were held in a rather ad hoc manner.

In 1859, the first dog show society came into existence in Birmingham, England. Within three years, the &quot;&quot; held the first dog show on the European continent in Paris, exhibiting a range of breeds, although the definition of guarding a breed remained open to interpretation.

Recognizing the necessity for the establishment of a governing body with punitive powers, MP Sewallis Shirley, called a group of well-known fanciers together and The Kennel Club was formed. In April 1873 a small group of people had a meeting in a three-roomed flat, which led later that year to the Kennel Club&#x27;s first show at The Crystal Palace with 975 entrants.

The first general meeting of the Kennel Club took place in Birmingham&#x27;s Great Western Hotel in December 1874. During the same year, one of the first important actions of the club was to publish a stud book, which contained the pedigrees of 4,027 dogs that had won prizes at shows in the previous fourteen years. Rules were formed and classifications established.

In 1881, the French &quot;Société Centrale Canine&quot; was founded, followed by the Italian &quot;Ente Nazionale della Cinofilia Italiana&quot; (ENCI) in 1882, the American Kennel Club in 1884 and the Swedish &quot;Svenska Kennelklubben&quot; (SKK) in 1889. The United Kennel Club was established in 1898. The was formed in 1911, under the auspices of the Austrian, Belgian, Dutch, French and German canine societies. The new kennel club rules reflected that pedigrees must be registered with their respective club.

Clubs acted as a court of appeal to set and maintain standards. They successfully popularized the sport of dog showing and elevated it from venues such as bars and public houses to fashionable locations. Through a kennel club, people could obtain pedigrees for their dogs, which were included on permanent registers. Kennel clubs have had more influence on the development of dog breeds than any other factor since the original diversification of dogs according to function.

==International kennel clubs==
Nations that have active groups of dog breeders and people who practice the hobby of dog fancy usually have their own national kennel clubs, often affiliated with those of other countries. Most kennel clubs have reciprocal arrangements and dogs registered in one country can be re-registered in another country if the dog is imported.

The , sometimes translated as the International Canine Federation in English or simply known by its abbreviation &#x27;FCI&#x27;, is an international federation of national kennel clubs and purebred registries. The FCI is based in Thuin, Belgium and has 98 members and contract partners (one from each country) and as such, the FCI is considered to the largest kennel club in the world. Worldwide, the majority of countries are members or have contract partners with the FCI, with only Africa and the Middle East poorly represented. In Europe, only the United Kingdom, Kosovo and Bulgaria are not represented by the FCI. Likewise, in the Americas only the US and Canada are not members.

In contrast to national kennel clubs, the FCI is not a registry and does not issue any pedigree, with the issue of pedigrees and record keeping of breeders and breeder addresses the responsibility of the national canine organisations recognised by the FCI.

The purpose of the FCI is to make sure that the pedigrees and judges are mutually recognised by all the FCI members. At present the FCI recognises 356 breeds, with each breed being considered as the &#x27;property&#x27; of a specific country, usually based upon the country where the breed has first originated. These breed &#x27;owner&#x27; countries write the breed standard of the specific breed, with the breed standard being a detailed description of the ideal type of the breed, in partnership with and under the oversight of the Standards and Scientific Commissions of the FCI. The FCI is responsible for publication and maintenance of these breed standards, along with the translation of breed standard into the four working languages of the FCI (English, French, German and Spanish). The FCI breed standards act as the reference for the judges at shows held in the FCI member countries, as well as maintaining the qualification and license of judges in dog shows in FCI member countries. For breeders, the FCI breed standards are used as the reference in their attempt to produce top-quality dogs according to the ideal type as set out by the FCI.

<text>Mikhael Leonidovich Gromov (also Mikhail Gromov, Michael Gromov or Misha Gromov; ; born 23 December 1943) is a Russian-French mathematician known for his work in geometry, analysis and group theory. He is a permanent member of Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques in France and a professor of mathematics at New York University.

Gromov has won several prizes, including the Abel Prize in 2009 &quot;for his revolutionary contributions to geometry&quot;.

==Biography==
Mikhail Gromov was born on 23 December 1943 in Boksitogorsk, Soviet Union. His father Leonid Gromov was Russian-Slavic and his mother Lea was of Jewish heritage. Both were pathologists. His mother was the cousin of World Chess Champion Mikhail Botvinnik, as well as of the mathematician Isaak Moiseevich Rabinovich. Gromov was born during World War II, and his mother, who worked as a medical doctor in the Soviet Army, had to leave the front line in order to give birth to him. When Gromov was nine years old, his mother gave him the book &quot;The Enjoyment of Mathematics&quot; by Hans Rademacher and Otto Toeplitz, a book that piqued his curiosity and had a great influence on him.

Gromov studied mathematics at Leningrad State University where he obtained a master&#x27;s degree in 1965, a doctorate in 1969 and defended his postdoctoral thesis in 1973. His thesis advisor was Vladimir Rokhlin.

Gromov married in 1967. In 1970, he was invited to give a presentation at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Nice, France. However, he was not allowed to leave the USSR. Still, his lecture was published in the conference proceedings.

Disagreeing with the Soviet system, he had been thinking of emigrating since the age of 14. In the early 1970s he ceased publication, hoping that this would help his application to move to Israel. He changed his last name to that of his mother. He received a coded letter saying that, if he could get out of the Soviet Union, he could go to Stony Brook, where a position had been arranged for him. When the request was granted in 1974, he moved directly to New York and worked at Stony Brook.

In 1981 he left Stony Brook University to join the faculty of University of Paris VI and in 1982 he became a permanent professor at the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques where he remains today. At the same time, he has held professorships at the University of Maryland, College Park from 1991 to 1996, and at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences in New York since 1996. He adopted French citizenship in 1992.

==Work==
Gromov&#x27;s style of geometry often features a &quot;coarse&quot; or &quot;soft&quot; viewpoint, analyzing asymptotic or large-scale properties. He is also interested in mathematical biology, the structure of the brain and the thinking process, and the way scientific ideas evolve.

Motivated by Nash and Kuiper&#x27;s isometric embedding theorems and the results on immersions by Morris Hirsch and Stephen Smale, Gromov introduced the h-principle in various formulations. Modeled upon the special case of the Hirsch–Smale theory, he introduced and developed the general theory of &quot;microflexible sheaves&quot;, proving that they satisfy an h-principle on open manifolds. As a consequence (among other results) he was able to establish the existence of positively curved and negatively curved Riemannian metrics on any open manifold whatsoever. His result is in counterpoint to the well-known topological restrictions (such as the Cheeger–Gromoll soul theorem or Cartan–Hadamard theorem) on &quot;geodesically complete&quot; Riemannian manifolds of positive or negative curvature. After this initial work, he developed further h-principles partly in collaboration with Yakov Eliashberg, including work building upon Nash and Kuiper&#x27;s theorem and the Nash–Moser implicit function theorem. There are many applications of his results, including topological conditions for the existence of exact Lagrangian immersions and similar objects in symplectic and contact geometry. His well-known book &quot;Partial Differential Relations&quot; collects most of his work on these problems. Later, he applied his methods to complex geometry, proving certain instances of the &quot;Oka principle&quot; on deformation of continuous maps to holomorphic maps. His work initiated a renewed study of the Oka–Grauert theory, which had been introduced in the 1950s.

Gromov and Vitali Milman gave a formulation of the concentration of measure phenomena. They defined a &quot;Lévy family&quot; as a sequence of normalized metric measure spaces in which any asymptotically nonvanishing sequence of sets can be metrically thickened to include almost every point. This closely mimics the phenomena of the law of large numbers, and in fact the law of large numbers can be put into the framework of Lévy families. Gromov and Milman developed the basic theory of Lévy families and identified a number of examples, most importantly coming from sequences of Riemannian manifolds in which the lower bound of the Ricci curvature or the first eigenvalue of the Laplace–Beltrami operator diverge to infinity. They also highlighted a feature of Lévy families in which any sequence of continuous functions must be asymptotically almost constant. These considerations have been taken further by other authors, such as Michel Talagrand.

Since the seminal 1964 publication of James Eells and Joseph Sampson on harmonic maps, various rigidity phenomena had been deduced from the combination of an existence theorem for harmonic mappings together with a vanishing theorem asserting that (certain) harmonic mappings must be totally geodesic or holomorphic. Gromov had the insight that the extension of this program to the setting of mappings into metric spaces would imply new results on discrete groups, following Margulis superrigidity. Richard Schoen carried out the analytical work to extend the harmonic map theory to the metric space setting; this was subsequently done more systematically by Nicholas Korevaar and Schoen, establishing extensions of most of the standard Sobolev space theory. A sample application of Gromov and Schoen&#x27;s methods is the fact that lattices in the isometry group of the quaternionic hyperbolic space are arithmetic.

===Riemannian geometry===
In 1978, Gromov introduced the notion of almost flat manifolds. The famous quarter-pinched sphere theorem in Riemannian geometry says that if a complete Riemannian manifold has sectional curvatures which are all sufficiently close to a given positive constant, then must be finitely covered by a sphere. In contrast, it can be seen by scaling that every closed Riemannian manifold has Riemannian metrics whose sectional curvatures are arbitrarily close to zero. Gromov showed that if the scaling possibility is broken by only considering Riemannian manifolds of a fixed diameter, then a closed manifold admitting such a Riemannian metric, with sectional curvatures sufficiently close to zero, must be finitely covered by a nilmanifold. The proof works by replaying the proofs of the Bieberbach theorem and Margulis lemma. Gromov&#x27;s proof was given a careful exposition by Peter Buser and Hermann Karcher.

In 1979, Richard Schoen and Shing-Tung Yau showed that the class of smooth manifolds which admit Riemannian metrics of positive scalar curvature is topologically rich. In particular, they showed that this class is closed under the operation of connected sum and of surgery in codimension at least three. Their proof used elementary methods of partial differential equations, in particular to do with the Green&#x27;s function. Gromov and Blaine Lawson gave another proof of Schoen and Yau&#x27;s results, making use of elementary geometric constructions. They also showed how purely topological results such as Stephen Smale&#x27;s h-cobordism theorem could then be applied to draw conclusions such as the fact that every closed and simply-connected smooth manifold of dimension 5, 6, or 7 has a Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature. They further introduced the new class of &quot;enlargeable manifolds&quot;, distinguished by a condition in homotopy theory. They showed that Riemannian metrics of positive scalar curvature &quot;cannot&quot; exist on such manifolds. A particular consequence is that the torus cannot support any Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature, which had been a major conjecture previously resolved by Schoen and Yau in low dimensions.

In 1981, Gromov identified topological restrictions, based upon Betti numbers, on manifolds which admit Riemannian metrics of nonnegative sectional curvature. The principal idea of his work was to combine Karsten Grove and Katsuhiro Shiohama&#x27;s Morse theory for the Riemannian distance function, with control of the distance function obtained from the Toponogov comparison theorem, together with the Bishop–Gromov inequality on volume of geodesic balls. This resulted in topologically controlled covers of the manifold by geodesic balls, to which spectral sequence arguments could be applied to control the topology of the underlying manifold. The topology of lower bounds on sectional curvature is still not fully understood, and Gromov&#x27;s work remains as a primary result. As an application of Hodge theory, Peter Li and Yau were able to apply their gradient estimates to find similar Betti number estimates which are weaker than Gromov&#x27;s but allow the manifold to have convex boundary.

In Jeff Cheeger&#x27;s fundamental compactness theory for Riemannian manifolds, a key step in constructing coordinates on the limiting space is an injectivity radius estimate for closed manifolds. Cheeger, Gromov, and Michael Taylor localized Cheeger&#x27;s estimate, showing how to use Bishop−Gromov volume comparison to control the injectivity radius in absolute terms by curvature bounds and volumes of geodesic balls. Their estimate has been used in a number of places where the construction of coordinates is an important problem. A particularly well-known instance of this is to show that Grigori Perelman&#x27;s &quot;noncollapsing theorem&quot; for Ricci flow, which controls volume, is sufficient to allow applications of Richard Hamilton&#x27;s compactness theory. Cheeger, Gromov, and Taylor applied their injectivity radius estimate to prove Gaussian control of the heat kernel, although these estimates were later improved by Li and Yau as an application of their gradient estimates.

Gromov made foundational contributions to systolic geometry. Systolic geometry studies the relationship between size invariants (such as volume or diameter) of a manifold M and its topologically non-trivial submanifolds (such as non-contractible curves). In his 1983 paper &quot;Filling Riemannian manifolds&quot; Gromov proved that every essential manifold formula_1 with a Riemannian metric contains a closed non-contractible geodesic of length at most formula_2.

===Gromov−Hausdorff convergence and geometric group theory===
In 1981, Gromov introduced the Gromov–Hausdorff metric, which endows the set of all metric spaces with the structure of a metric space. More generally, one can define the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between two metric spaces, relative to the choice of a point in each space. Although this does not give a metric on the space of all metric spaces, it is sufficient in order to define &quot;Gromov-Hausdorff convergence&quot; of a sequence of pointed metric spaces to a limit. Gromov formulated an important compactness theorem in this setting, giving a condition under which a sequence of pointed and &quot;proper&quot; metric spaces must have a subsequence which converges. This was later reformulated by Gromov and others into the more flexible notion of an ultralimit.

Gromov&#x27;s compactness theorem had a deep impact on the field of geometric group theory. He applied it to understand the asymptotic geometry of the word metric of a group of polynomial growth, by taking the limit of well-chosen rescalings of the metric. By tracking the limits of isometries of the word metric, he was able to show that the limiting metric space has unexpected continuities, and in particular that its isometry group is a Lie group. As a consequence he was able to settle the Milnor-Wolf conjecture as posed in the 1960s, which asserts that any such group is virtually nilpotent. Using ultralimits, similar asymptotic structures can be studied for more general metric spaces. Important developments on this topic were given by Bruce Kleiner, Bernhard Leeb, and Pierre Pansu, among others.

Another consequence is Gromov&#x27;s compactness theorem, stating that the set of compact Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature ≥ &quot;c&quot; and diameter ≤ &quot;D&quot; is relatively compact in the Gromov–Hausdorff metric. The possible limit points of sequences of such manifolds are Alexandrov spaces of curvature ≥ &quot;c&quot;, a class of metric spaces studied in detail by Burago, Gromov and Perelman in 1992.

Along with Eliyahu Rips, Gromov introduced the notion of hyperbolic groups.

===Symplectic geometry===
Gromov&#x27;s theory of pseudoholomorphic curves is one of the foundations of the modern study of symplectic geometry. Although he was not the first to consider pseudo-holomorphic curves, he uncovered a &quot;bubbling&quot; phenomena paralleling Karen Uhlenbeck&#x27;s earlier work on Yang–Mills connections, and Uhlenbeck and Jonathan Sack&#x27;s work on harmonic maps. In the time since Sacks, Uhlenbeck, and Gromov&#x27;s work, such bubbling phenomena has been found in a number of other geometric contexts. The corresponding compactness theorem encoding the bubbling allowed Gromov to arrive at a number of analytically deep conclusions on existence of pseudo-holomorphic curves. A particularly famous result of Gromov&#x27;s, arrived at as a consequence of the existence theory and the monotonicity formula for minimal surfaces, is the &quot;non-squeezing theorem,&quot; which provided a striking qualitative feature of symplectic geometry. Following ideas of Edward Witten, Gromov&#x27;s work is also fundamental for Gromov-Witten theory, which is a widely studied topic reaching into string theory, algebraic geometry, and symplectic geometry. From a different perspective, Gromov&#x27;s work was also inspirational for much of Andreas Floer&#x27;s work.

Yakov Eliashberg and Gromov developed some of the basic theory for symplectic notions of convexity. They introduce various specific notions of convexity, all of which are concerned with the existence of one-parameter families of diffeomorphisms which contract the symplectic form. They show that convexity is an appropriate context for an h-principle to hold for the problem of constructing certain symplectomorphisms. They also introduced analogous notions in contact geometry; the existence of convex contact structures was later studied by Emmanuel Giroux.

<text>Wenger was a Swiss cutlery manufacturer that exists today as a brand of once-rival Victorinox, used for knives, watches and licensed products. Founded in 1893, it was best known as one of two companies to manufacture Swiss Army knives. Based in Delémont, Wenger was acquired in 2005 by Victorinox and partially absorbed. Since 2013 Wenger Swiss Army knives have been integrated in the Victorinox collection as the &quot;Delémont collection&quot;.

==History==
The history of Wenger S.A. is strongly linked to the history of the Swiss Army knife.

===Company origins===
The industrial cutlery house of Paul Boechat &amp; Cie (the future Wenger) was founded 1893 at Courtételle in the Delémont valley in the Canton of Jura. It received a contract from the Swiss Army to produce knives as the second industrial cutlery manufacturer of Switzerland. In 1897 Theodore Wenger, a minister who had served in the US, was returning home to Switzerland and was hired by the group of entrepreneurs that had bought Boechat &amp; Cie two years earlier (later renaming the company &quot;Wenger et Cie.&quot;). One of Wenger&#x27;s first acts was to acquire a manufacturer of spoons and forks which he moved to a rented factory in Delémont.

In 1900, a new facility was built. Both the utensil operations and the Courtételle cutlery production were incorporated into the new plant now called Fabrique Suisse de Coutellerie et Services. In 1908 the Swiss Army decided to split the contract, with half of the order going to Victorinox, in the German-speaking canton of Schwyz, and the other half to Wenger in the French-speaking part of the canton of Bern. In 1929, after Theo Wenger&#x27;s death, Kaspar Oertli gained majority share in the company.

===Between 1929 and 2005===

In 1988, Wenger started producing watches, one year before Victorinox.

===Crisis and restart===
After the September 11 attacks all air traveling and related industries were facing a severe crisis. This was also the case for the Swiss Army knife manufacturers especially Wenger S.A. Changing airport security regulations which precluded the carrying of pocket knives diminished the sales of Swiss Army knives at duty-free shops. The crisis led to the acquisition of Wenger by its competitor Victorinox in 2005. With the backing of Victorinox, Wenger was able for a time to maintain its own production and branding of Swiss army knives and watches. Wenger knives had been advertised as the &quot;Genuine Swiss Army Knife&quot; and Victorinox as the &quot;Original Swiss Army Knife&quot;.

===Rebranding after acquisition===
After being acquired by Victorinox, in 2005 Wenger S.A. started to develop new products. In the process of rebranding itself as a provider of multifunctional tools for outdoor adventures, Wenger started to cooperate with individuals such as Ueli Steck and Mike Horn acting as their brand ambassadors providing each of them with a suited multi-functional tool adapted to their specific challenges. Additionally Wenger cooperated with Alinghi providing the sailors with a suited multifunctional tool. Most recently Wenger supports the Patagonia Expedition Race.

===Product lines merging===
On January 30, 2013, Wenger and Victorinox announced that the separate knife brands were going to be merged into one brand: Victorinox. The press release stated that Wenger&#x27;s factory in Delémont would continue to produce knives and all employees at this site will retain their jobs. They further elaborated that an assortment of items from the Wenger line-up will remain in production under the Victorinox brand name. Wenger&#x27;s U.S. headquarters will be merged with Victorinox&#x27;s location in Monroe, Connecticut. Wenger&#x27;s watch and licensing business will continue as a separate brand.

===Recent developments===
In March 2016, during the Baselworld 2016 expo, Victorinox relaunched the Wenger brand with marketing emphasising Swiss values at a reasonable price. Wenger changed its slogan to &quot;A Swiss Company Since 1893&quot; from &quot;Maker of the genuine Swiss Army Knife&quot;, which was used for decades.

In 2017, Victorinox released a Swiss Army Knife model named “Wenger Red”. This knife has the Wenger logo and the Wenger brand name in the scale of the knife. This knife is delivered in a box with the Victorinox logo and brand name. This part number is produced in Delémont, Switzerland. This is the only Swiss Army Knife with the Wenger logo and brand name that is being produced and sold as today.

==Products==
The two main product lines of Wenger S.A. are the &quot;Genuine Swiss Army Knife&quot; and Wenger Watch. 
Additionally Wenger S.A. makes kitchen cutlery under the brand names of Swibo, Grand Maitre.

Genuine Swiss Army Knife

Wenger produced pocket knives with body sizes ranging from about 65 mm to 130 mm (2.5&quot; to 5&quot;) and blades of about 50 mm to 100 mm (2&quot; to 4&quot;) in a red- or black-coloured case. These knives often featured tools such as can openers and screwdrivers. Since 2004, Wenger&#x27;s &quot;Evolution&quot; series introduced ergonomic handles designed by Swiss designers Patrick Eppenberger and Paolo Fancelli, although the classic flat handles remained available. Additionally, Wenger offered handles in various colors and materials, distinguishing itself from Victorinox by using a rectangular frame around the Swiss cross emblem (Victorinox uses a shield-shaped frame). On Wenger knife blades, the brand name was accompanied by an embossed armbrust (crossbow), referencing Swiss national hero Wilhelm Tell.

Wenger produced numerous variants of Swiss Army knives, catering to diverse needs:

Basic Models: These included only a blade and a multifunction tool that acted as a bottle opener, can opener, and screwdriver.

Specialized Models: For specific groups like cyclists, golfers, or anglers, Wenger offered tailored knife designs.

Larger Models: The Ranger, NewRanger, and RangerGrip lines, measuring 127 mm when closed, featured locking blades with a liner-lock system. Certain models were designed for one-handed opening, which restricted their carry in Germany under § 42a of the German Weapons Act.

The Giant: The Swiss Army knife is famous for integrating different tools into one knife. Wenger created &quot;The Giant,&quot; a knife featuring 87 tools and 141 functions, securing a Guinness World Record for the largest Swiss Army knife. It measured 24 cm in width, weighed 1345 g, and was first introduced in 2007.

Heritage: Based on the original 1908 Swiss Army knife, Wenger introduced the limited-edition Heritage line.

Wenger collaborated with individuals and organizations to create specialized knives:

Titanium Line: Designed for speed climber Ueli Steck, these knives met the demands of extreme mountaineering challenges.

Alinghi SUI 1: Developed for the Swiss America’s Cup sailing team Alinghi, these knives were tailored for sailors and used during the 32nd America’s Cup in 2007.

Mike Horn Knife: Released in 2009, this knife supported adventurer and environmentalist Mike Horn&#x27;s expeditions.

Patagonia Expedition Race Knife: Created for participants of the Wenger-sponsored Patagonia Expedition Race.

Other Wenger Cutlery Products

Kitchen Knives: Wenger marketed kitchen knives under the &quot;Grand Maître&quot; brand (&quot;Great Master&quot;) for private use and &quot;SWIBO&quot; for professional use, including butcher’s knives with signature bright yellow handles. Later, other handle colors were introduced.

By maintaining a blend of innovation and tradition, Wenger solidified its place in the history of Swiss Army knives, offering both practical tools and collectible items.
===Wenger Watches===
Wenger Watches are made in Switzerland. The company&#x27;s head office is located in Delémont Switzerland. Wenger watches are supposedly related to the basic ideas and concept of the Swiss Army Knife, having a multifunctional outdoor focus. Additionally Wenger produces several watches focusing only on elegance.

==Other products==
Wenger also makes notepads that can function as a twofold wallet.

Wenger produced bayonets for the Swiss Stgw 90 assault rifle. The bayonet has an overall length of 310 mm and a muzzle ring diameter of 22 mm. The 177 mm long blade is single-edged and it has no fuller. The bayonets were manufactured exclusively for the Swiss Army by Wenger and Victorinox (before the two companies merged).

In North America, licensed products using the Wenger and SwissGear trademarks are owned independently from Victorinox SA, and are used to market camping equipment (particularly tents, backpacks and sleeping bags), luggage, backpacks and office/business needs.

<text>The Andorran diner (ADD) is a commemorative currency issued in form of coins intended for collectors and without a legal tender value. A diner is divided into 100 cèntims. The name &quot;diner&quot; (&quot;money&quot; in Catalan) is derived from the Roman currency &quot;denarius&quot;.

The Servei d&#x27;Emissions de la Vegueria Episcopal has issued from 1977 onwards various series of diner denominated coins. Previously there were minor privately issued diner coinage (with no legal value). There have been silver, golden and bimetallic issues. The most commemorated topic is Charlemagne.

The exchange rate was defined (informally) as 100 ESP (0.60 EUR) or 5 FRF (about 130 ESP or 0.75 EUR) to one diner. But there is no bank or other authority where visitors to Andorra can change diners for euros. It is only an informal relation. It is not possible to buy anything with diners in Andorra. It is not possible to open an account in diners. It is only an artificial currency to produce commemorative coins.

In 1998 the General Council of the Valleys issued for the first time a series of diner denominated coins to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the &quot;Manual Digest&quot;.

<doc id="771589" wikidata="Q297435" url="?curid=771589" title="Roscellinus">
<text>Roscelin of Compiègne (), better known by his Latinized name Roscellinus Compendiensis or Rucelinus, was a French philosopher and theologian, often regarded as the founder of nominalism.
==Biography==
Roscellinus was born in Compiègne, France. Little is known of his life, and knowledge of his doctrines is mainly derived from Anselm and Abelard. He studied at Soissons and Reims, was afterwards attached to the cathedral of Chartres and became canon of Compiègne. As a monk of Compiègne, he was teaching as early as 1087. He had contact with Lanfranc, Anselm, and St. Ivo of Chartres.

Roscellinus&#x27;s exposition of Nominalist doctrines, and especially his application to the dogma of the Trinity, attracted broad attention. He maintained that the three persons of the Trinity were not referred to as three substances or Gods only by convention, arguing that if they were really one substance then God the Father and the Holy Spirit would have become incarnate along with God the Son. Roscellinus cited Lanfranc and Anselm in support of this doctrine.

In 1092/1093, however, a council convoked at Soissons by the archbishop of Reims condemned his interpretation and accused Roscellinus of tritheism. Roscellinus, out of fear of excommunication and even stoning to death by the orthodox populace, recanted his beliefs, but later returned to professing them. 

Roscellinus left for England, but having made himself unpopular by an attack on the doctrines of Anselm, he left the country and repaired to Rome, where he was well received and became reconciled to the Catholic Church. He then returned to France, taught at Tours and Loc-menach (where he had Abelard as a pupil), and finally became canon of Besançon. He is heard of as late as 1121, when he came forward to oppose Abelard&#x27;s views on the Trinity. He was also sent a letter by Theobald of Étampes in response to his criticisms of the sons of priests.

Of his writings there exists only a letter addressed to Abelard on the Trinity, in which Roscellinus &quot;belittles Abélard and makes merry over his castration.&quot; Hauréau brings forward his name in connection with a text, &quot;Sententia de universalibus secundum magistrum R.&quot;, but this is a conjecture. His doctrines are attested by Anselm, Abelard, John of Salisbury, and an anonymous epigram.

==Nominalism==
According to Otto of Freisingen, Roscellinus &quot;was the first in our times to institute the theory of words&quot;, but the chronicler of the &quot;Historia Francia&quot; mentions before him a &quot;magister Johannes&quot;, whose personality is much discussed and who has not yet been definitively identified. 

The &quot;sententia vocum&quot; was one of the anti-realist solutions of the problem of universals accepted in the early Middle Ages. In accordance with a dichotomy set out by Porphyry, the first medieval philosophers regarded genera and species either as things or as having no existence. The philosophers described this using terminology drawn from Boethius, referring to such abstract concepts as either (things) or (words). Nominalists held that: 

# only the individual exists (is ); 
# universals are merely words (). 

In Roscellinus&#x27;s theory, the universal is merely an emission of sound (), in conformity with Boethius&#x27; definition. Because Roscellinus did not discuss the philosophical concepts of genus and species, he is sometimes considered a pseudo-nominalist, or a moderate realist. However, because of his position as the first medieval philosopher to challenge medieval Realism, he has also been invoked as a forefather of modernity.

Roscellinus was also taken to task by Anselm and Abelard for the less clear idea which he gave of the whole and of composite substance. According to Anselm, he maintained that colour does not exist independently of the horse which serves as its support and that the wisdom of the soul is not outside of the soul which is wise. Anselm argues that Roscellinus denies to the whole, such as house, man, real existence of its parts, treating the word alone as having parts.

Roscellinus was not without his supporters; among them was his contemporary Raimbert of Lille, and what the monk Hériman relates of his doctrine agrees with the statements of the master of Compiègne. Universal substances, says Hériman, are but a breath. He merely comments on the saying of Anselm characterized by the same jesting tone, and says that to understand the windy loquacity of Raimbert of Lille one has but to breathe into his hand.

==Tritheism of Roscelin==
Roscelin considered the three Divine Persons as three independent beings, like three angels; if usage permitted, he added, it might truly be said that there are three Gods. Otherwise, he continued, God the Father and God the Holy Ghost would have become incarnate with God the Son. To retain the appearance of dogma he admitted that the three Divine Persons had but one will and power [&quot;Audio ... quod Roscelinus clericus dicit in tres personas esse tres res ab invicem separatas, sicut sunt tres angeli, ita tamen ut una sit voluntas et potestas aut Patrem et Spiritum sanctum esse incarnatum; et tres deos vere posse dici si usus admitteret&quot; (letter of Anselm to Foulques)].

This characteristic tritheism, which Anselm and Abelard agreed in refuting even after its author&#x27;s conversion, seems an indisputable application of Roscelin&#x27;s anti-Realism. He even argues that if the three Divine Persons form but one God, all three have become incarnate. There are therefore three Divine substances, three Gods, as there are three angels, because each substance constitutes an individual, which is the fundamental assertion of anti-Realism. The ideas of the theologian are closely linked with those of the philosopher.

<text>This article discusses [[Chinatown]]s in the [[Americas]], urban areas with a large population of people of Chinese descent. The regions include: Canada, the United States, and Latin America.

==Locations==
===Canada===

Chinatowns in Canada generally exist in the large cities. Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver, Victoria, and Winnipeg have Chinatowns.

Chinatowns have existed in some smaller towns throughout the history of Canada. Prior to 1900, almost all Chinese were located in British Columbia, in towns such as Nanaimo, New Westminster, Mission, Lillooet, Barkerville, and Penticton. Some British Columbia towns that were majority Chinese for years, such as Stanley, Rock Creek, and Richfield were not known as Chinatowns.

From 1923 to 1967, immigration from China was suspended due to exclusion laws. In 1997, the handover of Hong Kong to China caused many from there to flee to Canada due to uncertainties. According to an article from the Globe and Mail, Canada had 25 Chinatowns total across the entire country between the 1930s to 1940s, some of which had become extinct.

====Vancouver====

Vancouver&#x27;s Chinatown is the largest in Canada. Dating back to the late 19th century, the main focus of the older Chinatown is Pender Street and Main Street in downtown Vancouver, which is also, along with Victoria&#x27;s Chinatown, one of the oldest surviving Chinatowns in North America. Vancouver has been the setting for a variety of modern Chinese Canadian culture and literature. Vancouver&#x27;s Chinatown contains numerous galleries, shops, restaurants, and markets, in addition to the Chinese Cultural Centre and the Dr. Sun Yat Sen Classical Chinese Garden and park; the garden is the first and one of the largest Ming era-style Chinese gardens outside China. Although only one neighborhood is designated as Chinatown in modern Greater Vancouver, the high proportion of Chinese people living in the region (the highest in North America) has created many commercial and residential areas that while Chinese-dominated are not called &quot;Chinatown&quot;. In Greater Vancouver that term refers &quot;only&quot; to the historic Chinatown in the city core. There is an abundance of Chinese- and Asian-themed malls in the region, with the highest concentration in the Golden Village district of Richmond.

===United States===

Chinatowns in the United States of America have existed since the 1840s on the West Coast and the 1870s on the East Coast. The Chinese were one of the first Asian groups to arrive in large numbers. Circumstances caused by the Korean and Vietnam wars, the 1965 Immigration Act, in addition to the desire for skilled workers caused more immigration from China and the rest of Asia. As of the early 21st century the Chinese are the largest of the Asian immigrant groups; and have been so for most of the history of the United States. As other immigrants of other countries arrive, Chinatown, the oldest of the Asian ethnic enclaves has become a pattern for other Asian enclaves such as Japantown, Koreatown, and Little India. The Flushing Chinatown in New York City is now home to the largest Chinese population outside of Asia, while the Chinatown in San Francisco is the oldest in the United States.

====New York City====

The New York metropolitan area contains the largest ethnic Chinese population outside of Asia, comprising an estimated 893,697 uniracial individuals as of 2017, including at least 12 Chinatowns - six (or nine, including the emerging Chinatowns in Corona and Whitestone, Queens, and East Harlem, Manhattan) in New York City proper, and one each in Nassau County, Long Island; Edison, New Jersey; and Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey, not to mention fledgling ethnic Chinese enclaves emerging throughout the New York City metropolitan area. Chinese Americans, as a whole, have had a (relatively) long tenure in New York City. The Manhattan Chinatown is home to the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere.

The first Chinese immigrants came to Lower Manhattan around 1870, looking for the &quot;golden&quot; opportunities America had to offer. By 1880, the enclave around Five Points was estimated to have from 200 to as many as 1,100 members. However, the Chinese Exclusion Act, which went into effect in 1882, caused an abrupt decline in the number of Chinese who immigrated to New York and the rest of the United States. Later, in 1943, the Chinese were given a small quota, and the community&#x27;s population gradually increased until 1968, when the quota was lifted and the Chinese American population skyrocketed. In the past few years, the Cantonese dialect that has dominated Chinatown for decades is being rapidly swept aside by Mandarin Chinese, the national language of China and the lingua franca of most of the latest Chinese immigrants. While the Flushing Chinatown in Queens has become the largest Chinatown in the world, it has also become the epicenter of organized prostitution in the United States. Flushing is undergoing rapid gentrification by Chinese transnational entities. The growth of the business activity at the core of Downtown Flushing, dominated by the Flushing Chinatown, has continued despite the COVID-19 pandemic.

====San Francisco====

A Pacific port city, San Francisco has the oldest and longest continuous running Chinatown in the Western Hemisphere. It originated circa 1848 and served as a gateway for incoming immigrants who arrived during the California gold rush and the construction of the North American transcontinental railroads. Chinatown was later reconceptualized as a tourist attraction in 1910.

San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown was almost completely destroyed by the 1906 earthquake and fire, but some of its inhabitants did not relocate elsewhere. Looming large were proposals by real estate speculators and politicians to expand the Financial District&#x27;s influence into the area, by displacing the Chinese community to the southern part of the city. In response, many of Chinatown&#x27;s residents and landlords defiantly stayed behind to stake their neighborhood&#x27;s claim, sleeping out in the open and in makeshift tents. Numerous businesses and housing based in brick buildings survived with moderate damage and continued functioning, if only in a limited capacity. In just two years after the earthquake, the landmark Sing Fat and Sing Chong buildings were completed as a statement of the Chinese community&#x27;s resolve to remain in the area. As a result of this action, Chinatown remains the longest, continuously occupied Chinese community outside of Asia.

Still a community of predominantly Taishanese-speaking inhabitants, San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown became one of the most important Chinese centers in the United States.

===Latin America===

Chinatowns in Latin America (, singular &quot;barrio chino&quot; / , singular &quot;bairro chinês&quot;) developed with the rise of Chinese immigration in the 19th century to various countries in Latin America as contract laborers (i.e., indentured servants) in agricultural and fishing industries. Most came from Guangdong Province. Since the 1970s, the new arrivals have typically hailed from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Latin American Chinatowns may include the descendants of original migrants — often of mixed Chinese and Latino parentage — and more recent immigrants from East Asia. Most Asian Latin Americans are of Cantonese and Hakka origin. Estimates widely vary on the number of Chinese descendants in Latin America. The oldest Chinatown in Latin America is in Mexico City, dating back to at least the early 17th century. Two notable Chinatowns exist in Lima, Peru.

In Brazil, the Liberdade neighborhood in São Paulo has, along with a large Japanese community, an important Chinese community. There is a project for a Chinatown in the Mercado neighborhood, close to the Municipal Market and the commercial Rua 25 de Março.

<doc id="771595" wikidata="Q1267256" url="?curid=771595" title="Party of National Unity (Czechoslovakia)">
<text>The Party of National Unity () was a party created on 21 November 1938 in the Czech part of Czechoslovakia after the occupation of large parts of the country by Germany (Munich Agreement) and Hungary (First Vienna Award) as a last attempt to unify forces to save Czechoslovakia from disappearing. Its Slovak equivalent in the Slovak part of Czechoslovakia was the Hlinka&#x27;s Slovak Peoples Party - Party of Slovak National Unity created on 8 November.
It included most then-existing Czech political parties - including the Republican Party of Farmers and Peasants, Czechoslovak People&#x27;s Party, National Unification, Czechoslovak Traders&#x27; Party, and National Fascist Community, with minor parties like the National League, Czechoslovak Christian Social Party, National People&#x27;s Party and part of the Czechoslovak National Social Party.

The only parties outside the Party of National Unity were the Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the other part of the National Social Party. The latter two founded the National Labor Party in December 1938 as a non-Communist left &quot;loyal opposition&quot;.

Ideologically the Party of National Unity was corporatist and quasi-fascist. Its chairman was the nation&#x27;s Prime Minister, Rudolf Beran.

The party was forcibly dissolved after the creation of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in March 1939. Some of the membership created the &quot;Národní souručenství&quot; (&quot;National Partnership&quot;), the only Czech political organization permitted by the Germans in the Protectorate.

<doc id="771597" wikidata="Q5100184" url="?curid=771597" title="Chinatowns in Latin America and the Caribbean">
<text>Chinatowns in Latin America (, singular &quot;barrio chino&quot; / , singular &quot;bairro chinês&quot;) developed with the rise of Chinese immigration in the 19th century to various countries in Latin America as contract laborers (i.e., indentured servants) in agricultural and fishing industries. Most came from Guangdong Province. Since the 1970s, the new arrivals have typically hailed from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Latin American Chinatowns may include the descendants of original migrants — often of mixed Chinese and Latino parentage — and more recent immigrants from East Asia. Most Asian Latin Americans are of Cantonese and Hakka origin. Estimates widely vary on the number of Chinese descendants in Latin America but it is at least 1.4 million and likely much greater than this.

Unlike the Chinatowns of Anglo America and Europe, pure-blood ethnic Chinese were relatively few in number but now increasing rapidly due to generally lower levels of Chinese immigration to some parts of Latin America. Residents of Latin American Chinatowns tend to be multilingual. Latin America&#x27;s Chinatowns include those of Mexico City, Havana, Buenos Aires, and Lima. Some of these Chinatowns mainly serve as tourist attractions and not as true, living ethnic communities. The Chinatown of Havana, Cuba&#x27;s is largely multi-generation Spanish-speaking Chinese Cuban whereas the Chinatown of the Belgrano district of Buenos Aires, Argentina consists of many first-generation Holo- and Mandarin-speaking immigrants from Taiwan.

Politically, several nations of Latin America recognize the government of the Republic of China in Taiwan. A Chinese arch was presented as a gift to the Barrio Chino of Panama City, following the visit of Panama by the then Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui. After the major official visit by the Cuban Revolution&#x27;s Fidel Castro to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1995, materials were given for the new Chinese arch on Calle Dragone in Havana&#x27;s Barrio Chino.

==Argentina==
It is centered on Arribeños, Mendoza and Montañeses Streets, in the middle-class neighbourhood of Belgrano, Buenos Aires. Large numbers of recent Taiwanese and Mainland Chinese immigrants have settled in the area. Also included are ethnic Chinese from other parts of the Americas and East Asia, and Asians of non-Chinese ancestry, mainly Japanese and Korean, whose first immigrants date from WWII and the Korean war. As of 2018, the community was made up of 200,000 people.

==Brazil==

A significant population of Chinese Brazilians live in Liberdade area in São Paulo. There are 250 thousands Chinese immigrants or descendants living in Brazil. Many Chinese immigrants settled in São Paulo following the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. While most of the Chinese in Brazil descend from Mainland China, many also descend from the Taiwanese, while some of them are descended from Hong Kong and Macau.

==Cuba==

Chinese immigration to Cuba started in 1847 when Spanish settlers brought in Cantonese contract workers to work in the sugar fields. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese workers were brought in from China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan during the following decades to replace the labor of African slaves. After completing 8-year contracts, the Chinese immigrants generally settled permanently in Cuba, where their descendants have since intermarried with local Cubans.

Unlike that of Argentina and other Latin American countries, the overseas Chinese population of Cuba was once large, but the now-diminished Chinese Cuban community is today clustered around the largely dying &quot;Barrio Chino&quot; — called &quot;Barrio Chino de La Habana&quot; — on Calle Zanja, in Havana. After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, many Chinese Cuban entrepreneurs fled the country for the United States. Since the 1960s, Cuba has not attracted very many, if any, Chinese immigrants (developments or redevelopments of Chinatowns tend to require much private investments for which political conditions in Cuba are not favorable).

Only one Chinese-language newspaper, &quot;Kwong Wah Po&quot;, remains in Cuba. Havana&#x27;s Chinatown was formerly among the largest in Latin America as the neighborhood comprised 44 square blocks during its prime. To tie in with the Revolution&#x27;s economic reliance on tourism, attempts have recently been launched to attract revitalization investment for the Chinatown from Mainland Chinese state-run enterprises and overseas Chinese private investors, particularly Chinese Canadians.

==Chile==
Between 1,200 and 1,500 Chinese workers in Peru offered support to the Chilean side in the War of the Pacific (1879–1883) and thus went to Chile at the war&#x27;s end.

Most Chinese shops, supermarkets, and restaurants located in Barrio Patronato neighborhood in Santiago. However, some Chinese businesses can also be found in shopping centers such as Santiago Centro and Estación Central.

==Colombia==
The city of Cali has the largest Asian community because of its proximity to the Pacific Coast. The Chinese population can also be found in Barranquilla and Medellin. A small Chinatown exist in capital city Bogotá, especially in San Victorino area.

==Dominican Republic==
The first recorded mention of a Chinese presence in the Dominican Republic was in 1864 during the Dominican Restoration War, with references to a man called “Pancho el Chino,” who fought in the War. There are also reports that a businessman named Gregorio Riva brought a handful of Chinese laborers over from Cuba to make bricks and quicklime in the Cibao region. This group of Chinese immigrants eventually built warehouses in Samaná, Yuna and Moca. By 1870 the Chinese migrants had built the cemetery in Moca. By 1878 the presence of Chinese-Dominicans in Puerto Plata had increased thanks to the work of General Segundo Imbert, who was Governor of Puerto Plata.

A large influx of Chinese came during the American occupation of the Dominican Republic in 1916 to 1924, when ethnic Chinese came over to take part in the rapid economic expansion that resulted from the occupation. In 1937, more Chinese migrants that came to the Dominican Republic due to the Second Sino-Japanese War. In 1944 an official Chinese office was opened in the Dominican Republic and in 1945 a branch of the Chinese Nationalist Party was also opened. By the 1950s Chinese-Dominicans had established a small niche in the Duarte area of Santo Domingo and most of the businesses in that part of the city were Chinese-owned. Since Chinese migration had declined during the 1960s and 1970s, the community&#x27;s growth was limited.

The original idea for a Chinatown in Santo Domingo was conceived in the early 1990s, but it took some years before the idea was to materialize. Chinatown took one step closer to becoming a reality when the organization Flor Para Todos was recognized. The area where the China Town is located, has been inhabited by Chinese immigrants for decades.

On 8 December 2004, through an agreement with the Santo Domingo municipal authorities, the Foundation was given the go-ahead to start construction on the project. Aside from the agreement with the city municipality, agreements with the Tourism Ministry were signed to promote Chinatown as a tourist attraction, agreements with the Culture Ministry were signed in order to develop cultural activities and an agreement with the Police Department was signed in order to increase police protection in the area. Santo Domingo&#x27;s Chinatown was officially inaugurated as a Chinatown in 2006.

==French Guiana==
There is a Chinatown in Cayenne, French Guiana.

==Jamaica==
Kingston, Jamaica has a Chinatown/Chinese-influenced district. Jamaica has a history of Chinese, chiefly Hakka people from Guangdong province, and currently form less than 0.2% of the country&#x27;s population, (6,000 Chinese residents nationwide and possibly tens of thousands of mixed African/Chinese people in Jamaica).

==Mexico==
===History===
The first Chinese immigrants to Mexico came from China, some were Philippine-born Chinese, brought by the Manila-Acapulco galleon trade . However most contemporary Chinese immigrants came to Mexico during the 20th century as contract workers and political refugees. With the rise of anti-Chinese sentiment in Mexico in the 1930s under President Plutarco Elías Calles, most Chinese Mexicans, including individuals of mixed Chinese and Mexican descent, were forced out of Mexico and deported to China.

===Mexico City===

Mexico City&#x27;s small &quot;barrio chino&quot; is on Calle Dolores in Cuauhtémoc borough in the city center. The neighborhood Viaducto Piedad in the borough of Iztacalco also has a notable population of Chinese immigrants.
===Mexicali, a historic Chinese outpost===

The border city of Mexicali, Baja California, contains the second largest concentration of Chinese Mexicans in Mexico. The neighborhood is located on Avenida Madero Calle Azueta, is called &quot;La Chinesca&quot; (The &quot;Chinesque&quot; one). Some of the earliest Chinese settlers who arrived in the United States eventually went south to Mexico to escape institutionalized anti-Chinese persecution in California. The largest number of new Cantonese-speaking Chinese immigrants came mostly from the Guangzhou area around 1919. Mexicali had a local chapter of the Kuomintang. There is now a consulate of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in Mexicali as well as one in nearby Tijuana. 

The economic problems of Mexico in the 1980s led many Chinese-Mexicans to migrate north into the United States. Today, members of the multi-generational Chinese-Mexican community own and operate many businesses across the city. One of the oldest Chinese restaurants, Restaurant 19, is named after one of the early Mexican Chinatown corridors, Alley 19, which opened December 18, 1928, and eventually closed in winter 2001. It was one of the oldest Chinese restaurants in Mexico. This restaurant was utilized by many U.S. and Mexican officials and celebrities throughout the years; its end eventually came due to the devaluation of the peso in the 1980s and the new border crossing that takes tourist and locals away from the original heart of Mexicali. Currently there are more than 80 Chinese restaurants from small coffee shops &quot;(cafés de chinos)&quot; to huge 750 occupancy dining rooms. Nowadays, there are about 2,000 Chinese Mexicans living in the city; however, there are 100,000 residents more than thought who are of Chinese descent .
===Monterrey===
After the USMCA was ratified, an industrial Chinatown with signs in both Spanish and Chinese formed in Monterrey to take advantage of tariff free trade with the United States given its proximity to Texas. 

===Tijuana===

The Chinese enclave in the Mexican city of Tijuana is located in La Mesa. The enclave is home to 15,000 ethnic Chinese immigrants as of 2012, a number that has tripled from about 5,000 in 2009. The enclave is the second largest after the American enclave. The mayor of Tijuana Jorge Hank Rhon had received negative publicity from the local newspapers for his support for the official establishment of the Chinatown as there is general negative sentiment from locals who view China as a major rival for trade with the United States. There are various official events held during the summer recognizing the area in Tijuana&#x27;s La Mesa District. Tijuana&#x27;s Chinese community started around the late 1800s to the early 1900s when the Chinese immigrants to the United States fled California during a period called the &quot;yellow peril&quot;. As Tijuana was a border town, it was an important city towards the establishment of the Mexicali Chinatown, where at the time, the Chinese community would outnumber Mexicans 2 to 1. Though the numbers were far fewer in Tijuana, thousands would come through Tijuana on their way to Ensenada and Mexicali, a journey usually by foot for 120 miles to the east. By the 1920s, the Chinese numbering around 15,000 would concentrate in Mexicali to avoid the Mexican civil war. Racism would keep the population small for many decades until the early 2000s when Aeromexico would first offer direct flights from Tijuana to Japan. In 2008, the airline would offer direct flights to Shanghai, making Tijuana the only Mexican city to offer such a route. The author has attributed the immigrant Chinese population rise to the direct flight, where there were 5,000 Chinese immigrants in 2009 and 15,000 by 2012. In 2012, the Chinese community started making the enclave known in 2012, whereas the community largely kept to itself in years prior. The Chinatown is one of the few recent Chinatowns that was not created from commercial ventures.

==Panama==

The main Panamanian Chinatown is located in Panama City and is called the &quot;Barrio Chino&quot;, located in the neighborhood of San Felipe in the City of Panama. It consists of four Portals, beginning in Carlos A. Mendoza Street, covering Veraguas Street and part of the Eloy Alfaro and B Avenue. Most of the traditional Chinese shops are located in Carlos A. Mendoza Street, where you can find all kinds of shops, which range from food, articles for parties and events, Chinese curiosities and traditional Chinese food restaurants. There is also a part of Panama City named El Dorado with a mall that has the same name. It&#x27;s full of Chinese and other Asiatic stores, restaurants and beauty shops. In the surrounding streets you can find Chinese casinos, churches and even a bank.

In Panama City the major Chinese New Year celebration is at &quot;El Barrio Chino” in San Felipe but every Chinese community in other provinces has their own celebration.

==Peru==
The main Peruvian Chinatown is located in Lima and is called the &quot;Barrio Chino&quot;, located on Calle Capón (Block 7 of Ucayali Street); it is one of the two earliest Chinatowns in the Western Hemisphere, and contains various notably Chinese architectural features.

Other Peruvian cities with notable Chinese-Peruvian populations include Chimbote, Trujillo, and Chiclayo, all on the north coast, where Chinese immigrants were brought to work on sugar cane plantations. Historical Chinese immigration to the Amazonian region of Peru may be documented in a small village intriguingly named &quot;Chino&quot; several miles outside of Iquitos.

==Trinidad and Tobago==
The Caribbean, English speaking majority country&#x27;s capital, Port of Spain, has a Chinatown with an arch on Charlotte Street, which has Chinese businesses and merchants since 1970s.

==Venezuela==
Venezuela is also home to one of Latin America&#x27;s largest concentrations of ethnic Chinese. The city of Valencia, Carabobo home of the major Chinese community hosts various markets devoted to Chinese culture where can be found from smoked ducks to authentic pottery. A local newspaper is also edited in Chinese. A lively &quot;barrio chino&quot; also can be found on Avenida Principal El Bosque in the El Bosque district of Caracas.

Cantonese is widely spoken among Chinese Venezuelans, especially the variety commonly known as Hoisan or Toisan, but there has been recent Taiwanese immigration, adding to the linguistic and cultural diversity. Chinese from other places of the world also settled in Venezuela, especially from the Philippines, where they were experienced persecution in the 1970s under Ferdinand Marcos, and Cuba, where Fidel Castro&#x27;s Communist Revolution seized their businesses.

<doc id="771600" wikidata="Q5100181" url="?curid=771600" title="Chinatowns in Asia">
<text>Chinatowns in Asia are widespread with large concentrations of overseas Chinese in East Asia and Southeast Asia, and ethnic Chinese whose ancestors came from southern China — particularly the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and Hainan — and settled in countries such as Brunei, Cambodia, East Timor, Indonesia, India, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam, Japan and Korea centuries ago — starting as early as the Tang dynasty, but mostly notably in the 17th–19th centuries (during the reign of the Qing dynasty), and well into the 20th century. Today the Chinese diaspora in Asia is primarily concentrated in Southeast Asia; however, the legacy of the once widespread overseas Chinese communities in Asia is evident in the many Chinatowns found across East, South and Southeast Asia.

These ethnic Chinese often arrived from southern mainland China. They were mainly Chinese people of Cantonese (Vietnam, Cambodia, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia), Hakka (India, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, Brunei), Hokkien (Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Myanmar), and Teochew/Chaozhou (Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia) origin and less often of Hainanese, Hokchew and Henghwa origin in some countries.

Binondo, located in Manila, Philippines, is considered by many to be the oldest existing Chinatown in the world, having been officially established in 1594 by the Spanish colonial government in the Philippines as a permanent settlement for Chinese who had converted to Christianity. A separate area, called the Parian, was allotted for unconverted Chinese.

Ethnic Chinese represent a large minority population in most of these countries—with Singapore being the exception, where Chinese-origin Singaporeans form the majority of the population. Chinese Indonesians and Chinese Filipinos have adapted to Indonesian and Filipino ways. The Thai Chinese and Chinese Cambodian people have generally assimilated into the larger Thai and Cambodian population.

==Origin of Chinatowns in Asia==
Historically, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and to some extent East Asia have been areas of overseas Chinese migration within Asia. In the 18th and 19th century there were waves of Chinese migration to other parts of Asia, primarily in Southeast Asia. As a result of this migration, Chinatowns emerged in areas with high amounts of Chinese migrants.

==Specific Asian Chinatowns==
===Afghanistan===
In the Taimani area of the capital Kabul, there is an office building named &quot;China Town&quot;, with spaces for Chinese traders and merchants, as well as a small market.

===Cambodia===
Cambodia started to contact China as early as the 1st century CE, but it was only until the 19th century that many Chinese started to immigrate to Cambodia. Most Chinese settlers in Cambodia are Teochew people, followed by some Cantonese, Hokkien, and Hakka. 

In the late 19th century, during the reign of Luong Preah Norodom, a plot of land along the riverside, north of the royal palace (Psar Chas) in Phnom Penh, was gifted to the Chinese immigrants. This became Phnom Penh Chinatown. The settlement gradually grew and expanded. However, after the Khmer Rouge, Chinatown was reduced to the areas around Orussey Market and Central Market. It also lies on Charles de Gaulle Street, Kampuchea Krom Boulevard (west of Central Market), Monivong Boulevard, and Street 166.

Phnom Penh Chinatown is known for its Chinese cuisine, including grilled squids, tea eggs, lamina mee, and stir fry. There are also other businesses such as Feng Shui services and herbal shops.

Phnom Penh Chinatown is also the site of many Chinese festival celebrations. The most prominent of which being Chinese New Year but also the Spirit Parade Day, the Moon Cake Festival, and the Dragon Boat Festival.

===East Timor===
Dili, the capital of East Timor, has a Chinatown business area on Hudilaran Street.

===India===
Most of the Chinese community in Kolkata live in or near Tiretta Bazaar, the local Chinatown. Many Hakkas live in a community known as Tangra, which used to be dominated by leather tanneries (the Hindu majority will not touch cattle) and Chinese restaurants. , there were roughly 7,000 people of Chinese origin in Tangra, but the population was as high as 20,000. The population decline has been attributed to increased pollution regulations on tanneries and the immigration of younger generations to countries such as Australia, Canada, and the United States for better economic opportunities.

Another Chinatown is in Byculla, Mumbai. However, it has diminished in population as many of its Indian-born Chinese ethnic residents were denied Indian passports, a backlash from the 1962 Indo-China war.

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia, many Chinese reside within the Major cities and towns of Java, Sumatra, Sulawesi, Borneo and The Moluccas. There is also a sizeable Chinese population in small towns and villages across Sumatra and Borneo. In Java, especially in Jakarta, Chinese people reside in the northern, central and the western part of the province, such as Glodok, Mangga Dua, Pinangsia, Kelapa Gading, Grogol, Pantai Indah Kapuk, and Pluit. Other Chinatowns in Java are located in the Tangerang city center; Suryakencana Street in Bogor, West Java; Jalan Pekojan in Semarang; Lasem in Central Java; Kampung Ketandan in Yogyakarta; Kya-Kya in Surabaya; Kampung Balong in Surakarta; Jalan Kyai Tamin and Pasar Besar in Malang; Jalan Pemuda in Magelang; Pakelan in Kediri; Jalan Karyawan baru in Mojokerto; Keplekan Kidul and Jalan Blimbing in Pekalongan; Jalan Gajah Mada in Sidoarjo; and Jalan Veteran in Tegal.

As for Sumatra and Borneo, many cities and towns have significant Chinese populations that can be found dispersed in and around the city. Those are:
*Bangka Belitung – Pangkal Pinang, Sungailiat, Tanjung Pandan, Manggar, Toboali and Muntok (with Hakka majority)
*North Sumatra – Medan (), Binjai, Lubuk Pakam, Pematangsiantar, Rantau Prapat, Tanjungbalai, Tebing Tinggi, Sibolga (with Hokkien majority)
*Riau – Pekanbaru, Dumai, Selat Panjang, Bagansiapiapi, Panipahan, Bagan Batu (with Hokkien majority)
*Riau Islands – Batam, Tanjung Pinang, Tanjung Balai Karimun (with Hokkien majority)
*South Sumatra – Palembang (with Hakka and Cantonese majority)
*West Kalimantan – Pontianak, Ketapang, and Bengkayang (with Teochew majority) and Singkawang (with Hakka majority)

&quot;Chinatown&quot; in Indonesian is known as Pecinan or Kampung Cina.

===Japan===

In Japan, ethnic Chinese immigrants are called &quot;&quot;. The largest Chinatown in Asia and one of the largest in the world is located in Yokohama and the city of Kobe has a growing Chinatown. Nagasaki&#x27;s Chinatown (Japanese: , ) was founded in 1698 AD. Most Chinese immigrants in Japan were from Taiwan who arrived during the Japanese colonial period.

Nagashima Resort is Chinese Style Amusement Park. There is a Chinese restaurant called , () over there.

Tokyo&#x27;s Ikebukuro district is home to many ethnic Chinese who arrived in the 1980s. Though in Tokyo, this Chinatown is relatively small and unannounced compared to Yokohama&#x27;s Chinatown just to the south of the city.

===Laos===
Vientiane contains a Chinatown on Samsenthai Road.

===Malaysia===

With around a quarter of the Malaysian population of Chinese origin, urban districts with a large concentration of ethnic Chinese are to be found across the country. The term &quot;Chinatown&quot; is rarely used to refer to such places locally except for tourism purposes — particularly about Petaling Street, the center of Kuala Lumpur&#x27;s Chinese business district and is predominantly Cantonese-speaking.

In the northern Malaysia, the population of Georgetown on the island of Penang is essentially Hokkien-speaking, and close to 90% of the population is of Chinese origin. Other urban areas with a high proportion of Chinese people in the city center include Kuching (90%), Ipoh (82%), Kota Kinabalu (78%), and Malacca (62%).

In the East Coast region of Malaysia, the city of Kuala Terengganu has an old Chinese settlement known as Kampung Cina. This area, located at the river mouth of Terengganu River that empties into the South China Sea, is one of Southeast Asia&#x27;s early Chinese settlements (with many of the current buildings dating back to the late 1800s and early 1900s) and contains stately ancestral homes, temples, townhouses, and businesses. It is a significant area to the city&#x27;s Chinese community and culture, with many heritage buildings. Kampung Cina is also a significant tourist attraction in Kuala Terengganu.

===Myanmar===
The primary Chinatown in Myanmar is situated in Downtown Yangon within the Lanmadaw township and Latha township. Other Chinatowns exist in Myanmar&#x27;s major cities, such as Mandalay.

The Kokang Chinese is another significant group in northern Shan State who make up 30–40% of the total Chinese Burmese population. Kokang was founded in 1739 as the Chiefdom of Kokang and became populated by Ming loyalists during the rise of the Qing dynasty. Kokang today is a self-administered zone with a 90% Han Chinese population.

===Pakistan===

There is a sizeable community of Chinese people in Pakistan, mainly concentrated in urban centers. The areas of Clifton and DHA in Karachi have many Chinese restaurants and businesses and are sometimes dubbed as Chinatown.

===Philippines===

The best-known Chinatown in the Philippines is the district of Binondo in Manila. Binondo is the oldest Chinatown in the world, having been established in 1594, when the Spanish colonial government of the Philippine islands restricted the residence of Chinese who had converted to Christianity to this area. Unconverted Christians were allotted a different enclave, then called the Parian, which is no longer in existence as a Chinatown.

Many prominent Chinese Filipino families have roots in this district. Among the attractions of Binondo is Divisoria, a shopping area popular for bargain shopping.

Chinese settlement—predominantly Hokkien—in the Philippines pre-dates the arrival of the Spanish in 1521. Chinese merchants have been trading with the indigenous tribes of the islands since the 8th century. During Spanish colonial rule, the Chinese were intermediate in Filipino society as middlemen between the Spanish upper class and the native Filipinos.

During the rule of Ferdinand Marcos, bitterness against Chinese Filipinos grew, starting in 1972. Many of the community went to Venezuela, North America, Australia, among other countries. In the first-ever visit to Manila&#x27;s Chinatown by a Filipino president, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who is of part Chinese descent herself, recognized the efforts and contributions of Chinese Filipinos.

In 2006, plans were drawn up to construct a newer but synthetic Chinatown in shopping-mall form along Diosdado Macapagal Boulevard in the Manila Bay area of Manila, which would rival the nearly-400-year-old original Chinatown in the Binondo district. It was to be dubbed &quot;Neo Chinatown&quot; and designed based on traditional Chinese architecture. It was to be a joint venture of local Chinese Filipino and Mainland Chinese investors. Neo Chinatown sought to replicate the vibrant night market scene found on the streets of Hong Kong and Taipei.

Davao Chinatown, also known as Mindanao Chinatown, is the only Chinatown in Mindanao , located in Davao City.

===Singapore===

Singapore, a multi-racial but predominantly Chinese country, has a relatively large Chinatown in a district to the south of the river initially designated for Chinese settlement by Sir Stamford Raffles. It remains known as Chinatown in English, and &quot;Niú chē shuǐ&quot; (牛车水, lit. &#x27;ox cart water&#x27;) in Chinese, and the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station that serves the area is known by both names. The area around the station serves as a tourist attraction selling souvenirs, and also locally frequented areas including several traditional stores, markets, restaurants, apartment complexes, nightclubs, and Chinese temples, including the Buddha Tooth Relic temple, and the Thian Hock Keng Temple. Festival markets are also set up in the area during special events in the Lunar calendar, such as the Chinese New Year or the Mid-Autumn Festival.

Chinatown is not exclusively Chinese; the Masjid Jamae and the Sri Mariamman Hindu Temple can also be found off the main street.

In 1989, several areas in Chinatown were earmarked by the Urban Redevelopment Authority as historical conservation areas. Under that program, the historic streets of Kreta Ayer Road, Telok Ayer Street, Ann Siang Hill, and Bukit Pasoh Road were restored. Because of its proximity to the administrative center and the central business district, specialized professional and consultancy businesses, and upmarket retail and dining establishments, have displaced many traditional companies in the historical shophouses in Chinatown.

===South Korea===

South Korea&#x27;s Chinatowns are located in Incheon and Seoul. Seoul&#x27;s Chinatown is unofficial. A newly planned Chinatown was built in suburban Goyang (Ilsan) in 2005.

Incheon&#x27;s Chinatown is Korea&#x27;s only official Chinatown. It is in Jung-gu and was formed in 1884. It used to be the largest Chinatown in South Korea before the departure of the Chinese from the county. In 2002, to capitalize on the large number of mainland Chinese visitors visiting South Korea, the Incheon city council planned to revive its moribund Chinatown for US$6.2 million (worth about 6.5 billion South Korean &quot;won&quot;). It claims to be the largest Chinatown in South Korea and features an 11-metre-high Chinese-style gateway.

Busan is also considering reviving its Chinatown.

Due to institutionalized anti-Chinese discrimination during the Park Chung Hee administration and lack of economic opportunities, many ethnic Chinese left South Korea during the 1960s and 1970s for Taiwan or the United States. Since then the actual Chinese populations of many Chinatowns in South Korea declined. Ethnic Koreans own many businesses in these Chinatowns.

===Thailand===
Chinese Thais of Teochew (Chaozhou) descent are the dominant group of ethnic Chinese, with smaller numbers of those of Cantonese and Hakka origin as well. Rama, I was the founder and the first monarch of the reigning House of Chakri of Siam. His mother, Daoreung (original name Yok), was part-Chinese.

The Chinatown of Bangkok is located on Yaowarat Road and Sampeng Lane, including Huai Khwang District especially Pracha Rat Bamphen Road. It is considered the &quot;New Chinatown&quot; of modern Chinese such as students and tourists.

The city of Phuket is home to Thailand&#x27;s second Chinatown, which is on Phang Nga Road, Thalang Road, Krabi Road, Phuket Road, Ratsada Road, Yaowarat Road, Deebook Road, and Thepkrasattree Road Phuket. Early Chinese settlers founded it.

There is a Chinese community in northern Thailand, in a town called Mae Salong, near Myanmar. After the defeat and exile of Kuomintang (KMT) from mainland China by forces led by Mao Zedong, several KMT army divisions in Yunnan Province fled into neighboring Myanmar. After being expelled from that country, the mainland Chinese veterans fought Thai communists on behalf of the Thai government and were granted citizenship. Veterans of the Kuomintang Army 93rd Division established Mae Salong. Many Thai-born Chinese generations have relocated to Taiwan, although their fathers and grandfathers refuse because of an owed apology from the KMT for refusing them in the 1950s and 1960s. They have since made a retirement home-styled town called &quot;the home to the glorious people&quot; (榮民之家). Today, Mae Salong is a spot for tourists from Taiwan and mainland China.

A shopping district in Chiang Mai city called Trok Lao Zhou has been dubbed the &quot;Chinatown of Chiang Mai.&quot; It is a historic alleyway within Waroros Market (Kad Luang) that is of Chinese and Hmong origins.

The community of Chak Ngaeo in Bang Lamung District has been dubbed the &quot;Chinatown of the East.&quot;

===United Arab Emirates===
There are approximately 180,000 Chinese people in the United Arab Emirates, 150,000 of whom are in Dubai. Many Chinese expatriates hail from the Wenzhou region.

In 2018, Emirati-based developer Emaar announced a project to build the Middle East&#x27;s largest Chinatown in Dubai Creek Harbour. The plan coincided with the visit of China&#x27;s paramount leader, Xi Jinping.

In Abu Dhabi, a small Chinatown exists in Madinat Zayed.

===Vietnam===

Ethnic Chinese have migrated to and lived in Vietnam for centuries. During the transition of power from the Ming Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty in China, many anti-Qing elements fled prosecution and came to Vietnam. To avoid angering the Qing government, the Vietnam government sent them south to populate the scarcely-populated area. They pioneered many settlements in the south of the country, including what was then referred to as Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City.

Ho Chi Minh City&#x27;s Chinatown is the Chợ Lớn (&quot;Big Market&quot;) district, which has been a stronghold for the Chinese-Vietnamese community since the late 1770s when many Cantonese and Teochew Chinese arrived. Its main thoroughfares are Nguyễn Trãi Street and Trần Hưng Đạo Street. The Cholon area was the bastion of ethnic Chinese free enterprise, until the victorious communist government confiscated private property after the Vietnam War&#x27;s conclusion in 1975.

During the prelude to the Sino-Vietnamese War, the Vietnamese government decided to expel the Sino-Vietnamese from the Northern part of the country, creating a second wave of boat people, many of whom returned to China. After the Sino-Vietnamese War&#x27;s conclusion (the late 1970s and early 1980s), many Chinese Vietnamese (called in Vietnamese the &quot;Viet Hoa&quot;) along with their ethnic Vietnamese, or the &quot;Viet Kinh&quot;, compatriots fled the country as &quot;boat people.&quot; However, this third wave was mostly ethnic Vietnamese. As a result, many overseas Chinese-Vietnamese communities were founded in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the United States. Nevertheless, Vietnam still has a remnant ethnic Chinese community.

<doc id="771605" wikidata="Q3674986" url="?curid=771605" title="Chinatowns in Europe">
<text>Urban Chinatowns exist in several major European cities. There is a Chinatown in London, England, as well as major Chinatowns in Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle and Liverpool. In Paris there are two Chinatowns: one where many Vietnamese – specifically ethnic Chinese refugees from Vietnam – have settled in the &quot;Quartier chinois&quot; in the 13th arrondissement of Paris which is Europe&#x27;s largest Chinatown, and the other in Belleville in the northeast of Paris. Berlin, Germany has two Chinatowns, one in the East and one in the West. Antwerp, Belgium also has an upstart Chinese community.

==Western Colonialism and European Chinatowns==
Some European Chinatowns have long histories while others are still relatively new developments. Many early Chinese seamen settled in several European port cities and established several communities. The oldest Chinatown in Europe is in Liverpool, England. It was established in the early 19th century when Liverpool began importing cotton and silk from Shanghai. In the 1910s, Mainland Chinese labourers from the Zhejiang province who remained in France established the first Chinatown of Paris. There are other Chinese who &quot;jumped ship&quot; to Europe after working as hired hands on European ships or docks. 

As a legacy of European colonialism in Asia, many Asian subjects of British and Continental European empires immigrated to the colonizing country. During the 1950s, immigrants from Hong Kong began migrating to the United Kingdom in large numbers, which resulted in the formation of London&#x27;s second Chinatown in the Soho district. Some Chinese from the former Portuguese colony of Macau have resettled in Portugal.

In 1998, many more Chinese Indonesian immigrants arrived to escape the violent pogroms in Indonesia towards ethnic Chinese (mainly as a result of the Asian financial crisis of 1997).

After the fall of Saigon at the close of the Vietnam War, the ethnic Chinese boat people from Vietnam were resettled in France and Germany in the late 1970s and 1980s and began settling extensively in Paris&#x27;s Chinatown, immensely revitalising the area during that time. Paris&#x27;s Chinatown currently has a vibrant Southeast Asian ethnic Chinese character, while its newer counterpart in Belleville largely consists of fairly recent Mainland Chinese. Some Chinese Vietnamese refugees also ended up in Hong Kong, then a British-administered territory. These Vietnamese were resettled in the United Kingdom (there are several Vietnamese businesses in London&#x27;s Chinatown).

Although Mainland China was carved into several Western spheres of influence, the country as a whole was not a colony of a foreign maritime power. Nevertheless, many mainland Chinese, legal and undocumented immigrants, have especially contributed to the development of Chinese communities in Europe, including the currently nascent Chinatown in the Esquilino district of Rome, Italy. There has been new immigration from the Fujian and Zhejiang provinces of China, many of whom are illegal immigrants who work in the unskilled service industries–especially in restaurants and garment sweatshops—of Europe.

==Chinatowns by European country==

===Belgium===

The only &quot;official&quot; Chinatown (recognized by the Belgian government as Chinatown on the tourist guide maps and books of Belgium) is Van Wesenbekestraat in Antwerp, Flanders. It consists of many shops, supermarkets, restaurants, and a bakery as well as a little Chinese temple.

===France===

The Chinese community in France was estimated to count persons in 2004 and persons in 2007. The Chinatown in Paris located in the 13th &quot;arrondissement&quot; is the largest in Europe.

==== Paris ====

Paris has several Asian neighborhoods (), the largest being located in the 13th &quot;arrondissement&quot; (13th district). Chinatown Paris is bounded roughly by Avenue de Choisy, Avenue d&#x27;Ivry and Boulevard Masséna, and includes the Les Olympiades complex. The area was originally an ethnic Vietnamese district, when Vietnamese refugees arrived in the area in the 1970s following the Vietnam War. Later waves of immigrants included ethnic Chinese from Indochina, Laotians and Cambodians, who also fled their countries following their communist takeovers.

Although a large number of the earlier Vietnamese immigrants integrated into French society shortly after their arrival and moved to other areas of Paris and the surrounding Île-de-France region, they still maintain a strong commercial and cultural presence in the area. Within this neighborhood, commercial activity is dominated by Chinese and Vietnamese businesses, with a smaller number of Laotian and Cambodian establishments. Roughly 50,000 people live in the district, with a majority being Chinese, and significant Vietnamese and Laotian populations. The flagships of the &quot;Tang Frères&quot; and &quot;Paristore&quot; Asian specialty supermarkets are located close to each other in Chinatown.

Before WWII, Parisian Chinatown was based in a real Asian community, located in marginal and poor areas, formed through successive waves of migration, the first of them during the 1900s in the Arts et Métiers quarter around rue au Maire, then in the now disappeared Chinatown of Gare de Lyon. Since the 1920s, luxury goods shops and restaurants settled as well in the La Madeleine-Opera district, where the Japanese quarter of Paris is now located around rue Sainte-Anne, and in the Quartier Latin near place Maubert, where some Vietnamese restaurants can still be found.

Another Chinatown area has settled in Belleville, Paris, which was recently named one of the most unique neighborhoods in the world as a result of the heavy Asian influence in the district. There is a large number of Far East restaurants, especially on Rue de Belleville and on Rue Civiale.

==== Marne-la-Vallée ====

The second largest community in France, essentially Chinese and residential, is located in the new town of Marne-la-Vallée eastward of Paris, notably in the communes of Lognes, Torcy and Noisy-le-Grand.

==== Lyon ====

Lyon, with a Chinese community of persons, also has a Chinatown, located in the &quot;Guillotière&quot; neighbourhood of the 7th &quot;arrondissement&quot;, on rue Passet, rue d&#x27;Aguesseau and rue Pasteur and the nearby streets in the area formed by rue Basse Combalot, rue de Marseille and rue Montesquieu. Thanks to its important silk industry and notably with the sericulture crisis of 1856, Lyon has early created a relationship with China. A Franco-Chinese institute existed as well from 1920 to 1946 at Fourvière for Chinese students.

==== Lille ====
The important Chinese community of Lille is disseminated in the city, but some Asiatic shops are gathered on rue Jules Guesde, in the cosmopolitan district of Wazemmes.

==== Toulouse ====
A small Chinatown is as well located in the Belfort district in Toulouse, mainly around rue Denfert Rochereau.

==== Montpellier ====
A new growing Asian community has settled in the Port Marianne District.

===Germany===

Berlin, the capital of Germany, has no established Chinatowns, but many Chinese restaurants can be found in the area around Kantstrasse of Charlottenburg in the West (dubbed &quot;Kantonstrasse&quot;).

Hamburg, Germany&#x27;s second largest city and its major port, has very close ties to China and Asia in general. Until the 1930s, it had the &quot;Chinesenviertel&quot; Chinatown within its St. Pauli district, that is being re-established since the 2010s. The city hosts the biennial high-level conference &quot;Hamburg Summit: China meets Europe&quot; and also has a major Chinese consulate at &quot;Elbchaussee&quot; 268 in Othmarschen since 1921. Shanghai is a sister city of Hamburg.

===Greece===
A small Chinatown exists in the port city of Thessaloniki, in the area around Aisopou Street, near the Thessaloniki railway station. The around 2,200 Chinese nationals that live in the city work and live in and around this area, which is characterised by an abundance of Chinese-owned commercial stores and restaurants.

===Ireland===
In Dublin, Parnell Street between O&#x27;Connell and Cumberland Streets hosts a row of Chinese businesses. Many are arrivals from Fuzhou.

===Italy===

The country has had a very small Chinese population since World War II, but most of the current population has arrived since the 1980s. Over 310,000 Chinese are thought to be living in Italy according to 2016 statistics.

During the Second World War the silk products were replaced by leather belts more useful for the soldiers involved in the war. In the 1980s the community diversified its activities opening market stores, food stores and other shops. Today, chinatowns can be found in Prato and Milan.

The Italian term for Chinatown is &quot;quartiere cinese&quot; but Chinatown is also used.

===Netherlands===

The term &quot;Chinatown&quot; or &quot;Chinese buurt&quot; is used in the Dutch language.

The largest Chinatown of the Netherlands is located in Rotterdam, around the West-Kruiskade in the Oude Westen district. The first Chinese people settled in the Katendrecht district around 1911. A decade later the Chinese community at Katendrecht consisted of around 1500 people, which made it the largest Chinese community in the Netherlands.

After a large decline of people of Chinese origin in the Katendrecht area, more and more Chinese people moved to the West-Kruiskade area near the city center. Since the &#x27;80s this became the primary Chinatown of Rotterdam and started to attract Chinese people from smaller Dutch cities, like Eindhoven and Deventer.

The 2nd largest Chinatown is located near the famed De Wallen red light district of Amsterdam. This Chinatown, located on the Zeedijk and the Geldersekade, was formed in the early 20th century and revitalised in the 1980s. The street signs in this neighbourhood are in Dutch and Chinese. Amsterdam&#x27;s Chinatown also has the first and biggest Chinese-style Buddhist temple in the Netherlands. It is named &quot;Fo Guang Shan He Hua tempel&quot;.

The 3rd largest Chinatown is in the city of The Hague.

=== Poland ===
Poland&#x27;s main Chinatown is located in Wólka Kosowska, where Chinese immigrants are mainly engaged in trade and gastronomy. Along with Chinese, there is also notable population of Vietnamese. Some of them represent third generation of people of Vietanmese origin being raised in Poland.

===Portugal===
Portugal&#x27;s main Chinatown is Varziela Chinatown (&quot;Chinatown da Varziela&quot;), also known as Vila do Conde Chinatown in the outskirts of Vila do Conde, in Coastal Northern Portugal. The core of the community hosts 200 Chinese stores and has a population of 1500 ethnic Chinese (2015). Varziela Chinatown was established in 2001 in a decaying industrial area and it became a Chinese hub for Portugal and Spain, recently it started to attract Indians and other minorities. It bounced back from the 2008 crisis, when it was declining, the early community was said to have 160 stores and 600 ethnic Chinese inhabitants at its peak.

Varziela Chinatown is known for the illegal casinos, in an area where there is the legal Casino da Póvoa, one of the communities main entertainment venues, where the Chinese new year is traditionally celebrated.

Portugal&#x27;s other Chinatowns are located in Lisbon, around Martim Moniz, mostly in the form of shopping centres and Porto Alto also has a Chinatown.

Some early Chinese immigrants to Portugal came from the former Portuguese territory of Macau, when it was returned to Mainland Chinese control in 1999, while others came from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. Many Chinese also came from Brazil to Portugal. Besides speaking Portuguese, the Chinese population in Portugal also speaks Mandarin, Cantonese, and some of them even speak a mixed Cantonese-Portuguese creole called Macanese (or &quot;Patuá&quot;).

===Spain===

While there has been Chinese immigration to Spain, it has not been as much as in other European countries, such as France, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom. There are about 220,000 Chinese in Spain. Most Chinese-Spanish residents are people whose ancestors were coolies from mainland China. Others are immigrants or refugees from other places in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, and especially Cuba and Puerto Rico. In Spain, Chinese immigrants tend not to form separate neighborhoods (the quintessential image of a Chinatown) but live in areas mixed with other immigrants and Spaniards. However, in some places, Chinese immigration is enough to give a Chinese color to some streets.

Some examples of Spanish Chinatowns in Madrid: Dolores Barranco St in the Usera district, Lavapiés neighborhood or General Margallo St. in the district of Tetuán, and in the Madrid metropolitan area &quot;Cobo Calleja&quot; industrial park is the biggest Chinese industrial area in Europe; it is located in the southern city of Fuenlabrada. Barcelona, however, has had an area named &quot;Barrio Chino&quot; since the 1920s, in the old city between the Ramblas and the Paral·lel. The residents have been poor Spaniards and the area is marked by its prostitution, to the extent that any prostitution district of any Spanish city may be known as &quot;barrio chino&quot;, regardless of any Chinese presence, though the term does not imply a population of Chinese residents. The term came from an article whose author compared the state of the area with the popular image of foreign Chinatowns. Barcelona has another Chinese area around Calle Trafalgar and the surrounding streets. Other Spanish cities such as Valencia, Bilbao and Alicante have Chinese neighborhoods.

After the Spanish Miracle, Spain started receiving more Chinese immigrants, some of whom may have settled in the cheap &quot;Barrio Chino&quot;. As a result of the gentrification policy exemplified by the 1992 Summer Olympics, the area is being rebuilt as a chic neighborhood, and the more neutral name of &quot;El Raval&quot; has come to predominate. Recent Chinese immigrants have established wholesale clothes business at La Ribera, Ronda San Pedro and Trafalgar street. &quot;Barrios Chinos&quot; are also pan-Asian areas. Many Japanese, Koreans, Vietnamese, and Thais have settled in &quot;Barrios Chinos&quot;.

===United Kingdom===
Chinese people in the UK are relatively dispersed, and do not form ethnic enclaves as in many other countries, although most are to be found in large cities, several of which have Chinatowns, and the South-East. The largest Chinatown is in central London in the Soho area, established in the 1950s and 1960s. Other UK Chinatowns are found in the English cities of Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester and Newcastle, the Scottish city of Glasgow and a growing population of Chinese immigrants are present in Edinburgh, the Welsh capital Cardiff and Belfast, Northern Ireland.

====London====

Soho is the main Chinatown currently but not the original Chinatown, which was located near the docks along the Thames as the Chinese arrived from Canton, which was the major international port of China in the early 18th century. Opium could not be legally traded in China proper initially and opium was inspected and traded in London by the Keswicks and the Taipans. Silk and porcelain, as well as tea were loaded here, where a Chinese community thrived near Canton Street in the Docklands.

London&#x27;s current Chinatown in Soho is mainly commercially planned in the 1950s with many Chinese restaurants and businesses to detract from the sex trade in Soho. A new Chinese gate over Wardour Street marking the entrance to Leicester Square is planned as well. London&#x27;s Chinatown is undergoing gentrification, with a £50 million planned regeneration.

There are plans to re-enact London&#x27;s original Chinese district in Canary Wharf and the Docklands in Limehouse as part of the wider regeneration of East London to attract Chinese tourists. This area was bombed out, as with much of London, during the Blitz in the Second World War causing a relocation of the few ethnic Chinese who had lived there to other areas.

The Hakkas could not afford the rents from the Cantonese landlords, and moved out to Croydon where rents were very much cheaper to start businesses. As a result, other Chinese-run businesses can be found far away from central London, such as suburban Croydon.
The Government of Singapore owns the entire stretch of hotels around Cromwell Road. 


====Manchester====

Manchester&#x27;s Chinatown on Faulkner Street is the second largest in Britain after London&#x27;s. The Chinese British population, many of whom are immigrants from former British-ruled Hong Kong, especially settled in the Greater Manchester area. However, Hong Kong immigration to the United Kingdom has leveled off over the years and there has been a rise in Mainland Chinese immigration to the country.

====Birmingham====

Birmingham Chinatown is an area of Birmingham, United Kingdom. First emerging as an informal cluster of Chinese community organizations, social clubs, and businesses in the 1960s centred on Hurst Street, as a result of post-World War II migration from Hong Kong, the Chinese Quarter was officially recognized in the 1980s. It is well known for its Chinese restaurants, such as the China Court Restaurant, for the parade which is held there each year to celebrate the Chinese New Year, for the Birmingham Hippodrome and for being the location of the headquarters of Wing Yip.

To the rear of the area is the Irish Quarter which is located directly next to a large supermarket selling typical Chinese produce.

====Glasgow====

The Chinatown in Glasgow, Scotland is a Chinese shopping complex that opened in 1992 in Cowcaddens.

====Newcastle====

The Chinatown in Newcastle was primarily based on Stowell Street, but has expanded in recent years with many Chinese businesses in the surrounding area. The Chinatown incorporates the area from Stowell Street to Westgate Road. According to the BBC, Newcastle&#x27;s Chinatown is also undergoing regeneration. A gateway costing £160,000 has recently been constructed by Mainland Chinese engineers as part of the plans.

====Liverpool====
The Chinatown in Liverpool in the Merseyside area is on Duke Street and is home to the oldest Chinese community in Europe. It has been under regeneration. The arch located at the gateway is the largest of its kind outside of China.

====Sheffield====
Sheffield has no official Chinatown although London Road, Highfield is the centre of the Sheffield Chinese community. There are many Chinese restaurants, supermarkets and community stores, and the home of the Sheffield Chinese Community Centre. The Sheffield Chinese community is pressing for the street to be formally labelled Sheffield&#x27;s Chinatown.

Planning permission was granted in 2015 for New Era Square, a mixed-use development located between St Mary&#x27;s Gate, Bramall Lane and Sheldon Street (near to London Road) that media outlets dubbed &quot;Sheffield&#x27;s Chinatown&quot;. The £70 million development opened fully in May 2021 and consists of several residential and office buildings with ground floor retail centred around a pedestrianised square.

====Leeds====
Leeds has no official Chinatown, but the northeast area of the city centre is commonly referred to as Chinatown due to the presence of many longstanding Chinese restaurants, supermarkets and other commercial stores. The small &quot;Chinatown&quot; is centred on one of the city centre&#x27;s major outdoor car parks, and the majority of Chinese establishments can be found either on the west side of the car park on Vicar Lane, or on the east side on Templar Lane and Templar Place.

Plans to develop the area into an official Chinatown, complete with Chinese gates, have been met with setbacks, mainly due to the wide dispersal of the city&#x27;s Chinese community throughout the city and outlying suburbs. Furthermore, just as many if not more Chinese and other East Asian restaurants are to be found throughout the city centre, defeating the need for an official Chinatown.

<text>This article discusses [[Chinatowns]] in [[Oceania]].

==Australia==

Given its proximity to the Asian continent, Australia has had, and continues to witness, a massive immigration of Chinese and other Asians. As with Canada, the majority of ethnic Chinese immigrants to Australia are from Hong Kong and Canton. Chinese from various places of mainland China, Macau, Taiwan, Korea, Southeast Asia—especially Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Philippines, and Indonesia—and Latin America also settled Australia.

Many early Chinese from the Guangdong and Fujian provinces of China immigrated to Australia during the gold rush era. They were mainly Chinese of Taishanese, Cantonese, Hokkien, and Hakka origin. As in North America, the Chinese faced massive institutionalized discrimination, and Asian immigration was restricted by the White Australia Policy in the late 1880s. It was repealed by the 1970s under multiculturalist policies, which in turn ushered in a new wave of Asian immigration, particularly from Hong Kong and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and giving rise to several Australian Chinatown communities.

Australia has numerous contemporary city Chinatowns such as Chinatown, Gold Coast, and historic frontier and rural Chinatowns.

==French Polynesia==
The Chinatown, called &quot;Quartier Chinois&quot;, in French Polynesia is located in Papeete on Tahiti island. Its overseas Chinese also migrated to France. Starting in 1865, early Chinese migrants of the Hakka variety arrived in French Polynesia to work on the island cotton plantations. Many of these migrants were exploited. The ethnic Chinese population has been declining in French Polynesia.

==Guam==
Hagåtña (Agaña) has a unique Chinatown in Guam, a United States territory. The first Chinese immigrated during the Spanish territorial period, and their first descendants can speak Spanish. The Japanese, Koreans, Thais, Vietnamese, Filipinos, Chamorros, and other Pacific Islanders also settled the place, making it a multi-Asian district. These Asians also migrated to Hawaii or mainland United States.

== Nauru ==
The only Nauruan Chinatown is located at the Aiue Boulevard in the Aiwo District.

==New Caledonia==
Noumea has the only Chinatown, or &quot;Quartier Chinois&quot;, in New Caledonia. It has been settled by ethnic Vietnamese, Chinese Vietnamese, and Chinese Indonesian refugees. These Chinese also settled in France.

==New Zealand==
There is an overall strong Asian presence in many of the country&#x27;s urban areas. Many Taiwanese and Cantonese settlers from Hong Kong also live permanently in New Zealand, and in recent years New Zealand universities have been attractive to overseas students from Asia. Chinatowns existed on Greys Avenue in Auckland and Haining Street in Wellington up until the 1970s, and there is a growing community in both Christchurch and Dunedin.

The first early Chinese immigrants to New Zealand were Cantonese from Guangdong Province, who immigrated as a result of the Otago gold rush of 1861. The former Chinese gold-mining settlement near the present town of Lawrence is being restored as an open-air museum, as has a similar former settlement at Arrowtown. Because of this influx of Cantonese during the 1860s, there is a strong Chinese presence in Dunedin, which has the country&#x27;s only traditional Chinese Garden. Recent mayor from 2004 to 2010, Peter Chin is of Chinese descent. During the late 19th century and early 20th century, the area between Rattray Street and Stafford Street at the southern end of the city&#x27;s CBD had the highest concentration of Chinese businesses in the country, notably Choie (Charles) Sew Hoy&#x27;s importing company.

In the 1880s, openly sinophobic political ideology, especially in the heavily Chinese city of Dunedin, resulted in the New Zealand head tax, also known as the &#x27;Poll Tax&#x27;, aimed specifically at Chinese migrants. Racist violence towards Chinese people in New Zealand followed, such as the tragic murder of Joe Kum Yung by white supremacist Lionel Terry. This attack occurred in Haining Street in Te Aro, Wellington, on 24 September 1905, in the centre of what was once was a significant Chinatown.

Though Dunedin has no specific Chinatown area &quot;per se&quot;, a large proportion of the businesses in northern George Street cater specifically for the large East and Southeast Asian community centred on this part of the city.

Other groups of Chinese travelled from South Korea, South Africa, Australia, Latin America, and the other Pacific Islands. Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, and Filipino culture are also prevalent in New Zealand&#x27;s Chinatowns, making them multi-Asian places. 

In 2002, the New Zealand Government made a public apology to the Chinese for the poll tax that had been levied on their forebears a century ago. The apology was re-issued in Cantonese in 2023.

== Northern Mariana Islands ==
Saipan, in the Northern Mariana Islands has a residential district known as &quot;Chinatown&quot;. However, very few Chinese actually live there and most of the small groceries in the area are actually run by Koreans.

==Papua New Guinea==
Several old Chinatowns dot the landscape of Papua New Guinea. The Chinatown of Rabaul is among the oldest in the nation. There is also a Chinatown in the capital city of Port Moresby. Many ethnic Chinese have migrated to Australia.

==Solomon Islands==
There is an active Chinatown in the city of Honiara on the Solomon Islands. It was badly damaged in rioting in April 2006, following the election of Snyder Rini as Prime Minister. Chinatown, along with the surrounding areas, was once again left devastated in the aftermath of the 2021 Solomon Islands unrest.

==Vanuatu==
Vanuatu has a small Chinatown (&quot;Quartier Chinois&quot;) on Rue Carnot in Port Vila. Its population includes ethnic Vietnamese and ethnic Chinese residents.

<doc id="771611" wikidata="Q5100179" url="?curid=771611" title="Chinatowns in Africa">
<text>This article discusses Chinatowns in Africa. There are at least three major Chinatowns in Africa.

As former colonies of Europe, the coastal African nations of Madagascar, Mauritius, and South Africa were the main receiving points of Chinese immigrants from the 1890s to the early part of the 20th century. The early Chinese arrived to labour in the Transvaal gold mines of South Africa and on the Tananrive Tamatave railway of Madagascar. Many of these Chinese immigrants were exploited.

Today, South Africa remains the top African destination for first-generation Chinese-speaking immigrants.

==Kenya==
In the capital Nairobi, there is a small pocket of Chinese businesses along Argwings Kodhek Road in the Kilimani district, near the Chaka Place shopping center. There is a newer Chinatown with a larger collection of businesses on the former campus of Baraton University&#x27;s Nairobi extension campus.

==Madagascar==
Madagascar has received some Chinese immigrants. In Madagascar, there are about 30,000 Chinese, the majority of them came from the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong. A Chinatown, called &quot;Quartier chinois&quot;, is located in Antananarivo.

==Mauritius==

The Chinatown or &quot;Quartier chinois&quot; is in the city of Port Louis on &quot;rue Royale&quot;. The Hakka Chinese are the dominant group among the Chinese in Mauritius. The Chinatown of Port Louis is one of the oldest in Africa. In the 1780s, thousands of Chinese migrated to Mauritius and quickly formed a small Chinatown, the &quot;Camp des chinois&quot;, in Port Louis. The Chinatown of Port Louis hosts a very popular &quot;Chinese Food and Cultural Festival&quot; every year, which is appreciated by Mauritians of all communities.

== Namibia ==
There is a small Chinese district, supermarket, and arch in Windhoek.

== Nigeria ==
China Town, a Chinese-dominated business arena in the Ojota area of Lagos. The giant shopping centre, which sits on an expanse of land measuring 20,000 square metres, will no longer be for only economic activities. It will also help facilitate robust bilateral relationships between Nigerians and the Chinese people.

==South Africa==
Inner-city Johannesburg has a Chinatown on Commissioner Street, but a newer Chinatown can be found on Derrick Avenue in the hilly suburb of Cyrildene. Most of the inhabitants of the Cyrildene Chinatown are recent immigrants from mainland China. A Chinatown also exists in the city of Port Elizabeth with the first settlement located in the South End district of the city until the Apartheid government forcibly removed the Chinese from the district. The Chinese were later removed to Kabega Park area.

In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s immigrants from Taiwan settled extensively in South Africa. South Africa&#x27;s first Taiwan-born legislator was elected in the 1980s. After South Africa recognised the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1998 large numbers of mainland Chinese
immigrated to the country. South African Chinese are dispersed throughout South African cities. During the Apartheid regime (1948–93) Chinese South Africans were classified as &quot;Coloureds&quot; or &quot;Asian South Africans&quot;, while certain East Asian nationals (such as Japan and Taiwan) in South Africa were declared &quot;honorary whites&quot; and thus avoided most forms of official discriminatory laws (they could live in reserved &quot;white&quot; neighborhoods unlike native/black, and &quot;Asian&quot;-Indian South Africans), since Apartheid created a strict racial segregation system for non-white/European persons (esp. the black majority) in South Africa.

<text>Mary Harron (born January 12, 1953) is a Canadian film director and screenwriter.

She co-wrote the screenplay and directed &quot;American Psycho&quot;, &quot;The Notorious Bettie Page&quot;&quot;, and I Shot Andy Warhol.&quot;

==Early life==
Born in Bracebridge, Ontario, Canada, Harron grew up with a family with numerous connections to the arts. She is the daughter of Gloria Fisher and Don Harron, a Canadian actor, comedian, author, and director. Her parents divorced when she was six years old. Harron spent her early life residing between Toronto and Los Angeles. Harron&#x27;s first stepmother, Virginia Leith, was discovered by Stanley Kubrick and acted in his first film, &quot;Fear and Desire&quot; and was also featured in the 1962 cult classic &quot;The Brain That Wouldn&#x27;t Die&quot;. Leith&#x27;s brief acting career partly inspired Harron&#x27;s interest in making &quot;The Notorious Bettie Page&quot;. Harron&#x27;s stepfather is the novelist Stephen Vizinczey. Harron&#x27;s second stepmother is the Canadian singer Catherine McKinnon.

Harron moved to England when she was thirteen and later attended St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford University, where she received a Bachelors in English. While in England, she dated Tony Blair, later the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and Chris Huhne, another Oxford student who later became a prominent politician. She then moved to New York City and was part of its 1970s punk scene.

== Influences ==
During her adolescence, Harron was exposed to many different forms of art and film. In a 2020 interview with &quot;The New School&quot;, Harron states: &quot;My parents took us to whatever films they wanted to see so I saw a lot of art films that would not be considered suitable for a child.&quot; She goes on to explain that her largest influences, especially as a child around the age of ten, were Alfred Hitchcock, Bergman, and Satyajit Ray. After she had moved to London in her teen years she began attending the National Film Theatre where she was exposed to other international filmmakers like Fritz Lang, Howard Hawks, Claude Chabrol, and Roman Polanski. She was also exposed to noir films, namely &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;.

As an adult she was inspired by the films &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot; and &quot;The Piano&quot;, directed by Jane Campion. While she said that she had plenty of exposure to Hollywood films, she was enticed by these types of films because they were, in her words, the &quot;forerunners of independent film.&quot;

== Career ==

=== Early writing work ===
In New York, Harron helped start and write for &quot;Punk&quot; magazine as a music journalist; she was the first journalist to interview the Sex Pistols for an American publication. She grew up in the early punk scene of America. She found the culture easy for her to fit into and was constantly evolving and spreading into new demographics. During the 1980s, she was a drama critic for &quot;The Observer&quot; in London for a time, as well as working as a music critic for &quot;The Guardian&quot; and the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. In the late 1980s, Harron participated and began her film career writing and directing BBC Documentaries.

During the 1990s, Harron moved back to New York where she worked as a producer for PBS&#x27;s &quot;Edge&quot;, a program dedicated to exploring American pop culture. It was at this time that Harron became interested in the life of Valerie Solanas, the woman who attempted to kill Andy Warhol. Harron suggested making a documentary about Solanas to her producers, who in turn encouraged her to develop the project into what would be her first feature film. Harron says she owes her success with her first film to Andy who helped to sell the controversial focus on the attempted murderess, Solanas.

===&quot;I Shot Andy Warhol&quot;===

Harron&#x27;s feature film directorial debut, &quot;I Shot Andy Warhol&quot;, released in 1996, is the partially imagined story of Valerie Solanas&#x27; failed assassination attempt on Andy Warhol. She explains her interest in Solanas&#x27; life:

In an interview Harron did for CBC’s Newsworld’s &quot;On the Arts&quot; in 1996, she told film critic Christopher Heard that &quot;It was Valerie that really impelled [her] to make this film, because of the mystery of her story. [...] Not knowing who she was ... the lack of information about her.&quot; Solanas&#x27;s existence was &quot;a real piece of lost history&quot; and an &quot;unknown story&quot; that she sought to explore deeper.

As far as Harron&#x27;s amusement with Warhol went, she stated &quot;As I was growing up, Warhol was the most famous artist in the world, apart from Picasso [...] My mother [disapproved] of him, so that made him even more interesting.&quot; Also regarding her interest in Warhol’s story, she felt that he, before and after the shooting, were two vastly different people. This is her reason for viewing Warhol’s shooting as a “turning point” in his life.”

The film opened the “Un Certain Regard” section of the Cannes Film Festival and received an Independent Spirit Award nomination for best first feature film. It also won the sole acting award at that year&#x27;s Sundance Film Festival for Lili Taylor&#x27;s performance as Solanas.

===&quot;American Psycho&quot;===
Harron&#x27;s second film, &quot;American Psycho&quot;, released in 2000, is based on the book of the same title by Bret Easton Ellis, which is notorious for its graphic descriptions of torture and murder. The protagonist, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), is an investment banker who goes on a killing spree. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Stephen Holden wrote of the film:

The film was mired in controversy before production began, due in large part to the legacy of the book&#x27;s release. Harron has a liking for darker and more controversial topics, such as Valerie Solanas, but it was the satirical nature of the book that &quot;inspired her film about perfunctory violence and obsessive consumption.&quot; As Harron began production, the crew had to contend with threats of protest, as the issue of violence in the media became crystallized by the Columbine shootings. Campaigns against the film continued throughout production, the Feminist Majority Foundation condemning the film as misogynist, and the Canadians Concerned About Violence in Entertainment (C-CAVE) convincing restaurant owners to deny Harron permission to film in their establishments. When returning to work with co-writer Guinevere Turner, Harron felt they were best suited for the job of &quot;American Psycho&quot; as they needed no hesitation on feminist values, especially after Turner&#x27;s successful lesbian film &quot;Go Fish.&quot;

Although some criticized &quot;American Psycho&quot; for its violence against women, Harron and Turner made conscious decisions that project the female influence on this adaption. Harron&#x27;s adaptation of this film changes the focus from purely Bateman&#x27;s perspective to showcase the faces of the women as &quot;the perspective in those murder scenes wasn&#x27;t through Patrick Bateman but the women.&quot;

===&quot;The Notorious Bettie Page&quot;===
&quot;The Notorious Bettie Page&quot;, released in 2005, starred Gretchen Mol as Bettie Page, the 1950s pinup model who became a sexual icon. The film shows Page as the daughter of religious and conservative parents, as well as the fetish symbol who became a target of a Senate investigation of pornography. About the film, Harron said in 2006:

Harron later stated that the film suffered from false expectations, in that many male critics and male viewers expected and wanted the film to be &quot;sexy&quot;, but that the film instead portrayed &quot;what it&#x27;s like to be Bettie&quot;, and Page herself did not get a &quot;sexual charge&quot; out of her modelling.

===&quot;The Moth Diaries&quot;===

&quot;The Moth Diaries&quot; (2011), Harron&#x27;s fourth feature film, is another adaption of an American novel, being based on Rachel Klein&#x27;s 2002 novel of the same name. The film follows a group of girls living together at Brangwyn, a boarding school. A new student arrives, Ernessa (Lily Cole) and the girls begin to suspect that she is a vampire. Harron has described the film as a &quot;gothic coming-of-age story&quot; that explores the nuanced friendships of teenage girls as they are repeatedly confronted with the prospect of adulthood.

===&quot;Charlie Says&quot;===
Harron directed the 2018 independent film &quot;Charlie Says&quot;, with a screenplay by Turner, which tells the real-life story of how three of Charles Manson&#x27;s female followers (Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, and Leslie Van Houten) came to terms with the magnitude of their crimes while incarcerated in the 1970s. Matt Smith played Manson in flashbacks. The film had initially been intended for another director, but when that director was no longer available Harron took over. Harron stated that she was fascinated by the psychological aspects of how the women ended up committing murder as a result of both manipulation by Manson and feelings of solidarity with one another.

=== &quot;Dalíland&quot; ===
&quot;Dalíland&quot; is a 2022 film directed by Harron, from a screenplay by her husband John Walsh. The film, set in the 1970s, follows the marriage between painter Salvador Dalí and his wife Gala Dalí, played by Ben Kingsley and Barbara Sukowa. The film was shot in Liverpool and released at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival.

=== Other work ===
In addition to her films, Harron was also the executive producer of &quot;The Weather Underground&quot;, a documentary looking at the Weathermen (political activists and extremists of the 1970s). She has also worked in television, directing episodes of&quot; Oz&quot;, &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The L Word&quot; and &quot;Big Love&quot;. Working on the episode of &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; &quot;The Rainbow of Her Reasons&quot;, Harron was brought back together with &quot;I Shot Andy Warhol&quot; actress, Lili Taylor.

==Views==
Harron has been at times labelled a feminist filmmaker, in part due to her film on lesbian feminist Valerie Solanas, &quot;I Shot Andy Warhol&quot;, as well as a lesbian storyline within her 2011 teenage Gothic horror film &quot;The Moth Diaries&quot; (2011). She has consistently denied this label, although she considers herself a feminist. In a 2006 interview, and then again during an interview in 2012, she stated:

She is a member of Film Fatales, a women&#x27;s independent filmmaker collective.

Asked about her Canadian identity in a 2014 interview, Harron stated that she mostly felt &quot;just not American&quot;. She stated that, to her, being Canadian meant &quot;You don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re at the center of things.&quot; She also felt that, unlike American directors, she was not &quot;a moralistic filmmaker. I&#x27;m not trying to tell people what to do, and I&#x27;m not trying to lead... I&#x27;m interested in ambiguity.&quot;

Although her films deal with controversial materials, like &quot;American Psycho&quot;, in the opinion of director Buffy Childerhose, she does not put emphasis on gore and violence.

== Personal life ==
Harron lives in New York with her husband, filmmaker John C. Walsh, and their two daughters.

<text>Adolf Wallenberg (10 November 1862 – 10 April 1949) was a German internist and neurologist.

Wallenberg was born in Preussisch Stargard into a Jewish family. He studied at the universities of Heidelberg and Leipzig, receiving his doctorate from the latter institution in 1886. From 1886 to 1888 he worked as an assistant in the Städtisches Krankenhaus in Danzig, where he settled as a practitioner. From 1907 to 1928 he served as director of the internal medicine department at the hospital, attaining the title of professor in 1910. When the Nazis came to power, he was stripped of his research laboratory and forced to stop working because he was Jewish. He emigrated to Great Britain in 1938, then relocated to the United States in 1943, where he died several years later in Manteno, Illinois.

While working with Ludwig Edinger he described the avian brain, and also examined the role of the olfactory system in the assessment, recognition, and ingestion of food.

He described the clinical manifestations (1895) and the autopsy findings (1901) in occlusions of the &quot;arteria cerebelli posterior inferior&quot; (Wallenberg&#x27;s syndrome).

With Edinger, and later alone, he published the &quot;Jahresberichte über die Leistungen auf dem Gebiete der Anatomie des Zentralnervensystems&quot; (1895–1928). From 1996 until 2019 the &quot;Adolf Wallenberg-Preis&quot; was awarded by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Neurologie for outstanding contributions made in the field of cerebrovascular disease, cerebral hemorrhage or cerebral metabolism.

==Associated eponym==
* Wallenberg&#x27;s syndrome: (Synonyms: dorsolateral medullary syndrome, lateral bulbar syndrome, lateral medullary infarction syndrome, posteroinferior cerebellar artery syndrome): A complex of symptoms caused by occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, resulting in sensory and sympathetic disturbances, cerebellar ataxy, etc.

<text>Welsh Bicknor () is an area in the far south of the English county of Herefordshire. Despite its name, it is not now in Wales, but it was historically a detached parish (exclave) of the county of Monmouthshire. It lies within a loop of the River Wye and covers .

As its name suggests, Welsh Bicknor has close ties with Wales, having been a detached parish of Monmouthshire, although adjacent to English Bicknor and Lydbrook, which are part of Gloucestershire. 

==History==

Courtfield, the manor house of Welsh Bicknor, was originally known as Greyfield or Greenfield (the Welsh colour &quot;glas&quot; originally referred to a scale of colours including greys, greens and blues). The name altered after King Henry V of England had lived there as a young child of eight, following the death of his mother Mary de Bohun, under the care of Lady Margaret Montacute, wife of Sir John Montacute, 3rd Earl of Salisbury, long before his father, King Henry IV, usurped the throne of King Richard II. An effigy of Lady Margaret Montacute can be seen in Welsh Bicknor church and her plain tomb is beside the altar in Goodrich church.

The manor house and surrounding land of Welsh Bicknor belonged to the Vaughan family. However, in 1651 Richard Vaughan, who was a Catholic, had his land sequestered and given to Phillip Nicholas of Llansoy, in Monmouthshire, leading to the unusual situation of the exclave. It has been deemed part of Herefordshire since the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844.

Religious dissension within the Vaughan families continued for several generations. In 1715, a John Vaughan (presumably one of Richard&#x27;s descendants) refused the oath of allegiance to George I. He had estates in the several counties of Monmouthshire, Radnorshire, Herefordshire, and Gloucestershire valued at £1,000 per annum. In 1719 he was fined for not attending church.

A later generation, in the person of Richard Vaughan, joined Prince Charles Edward Stuart&#x27;s army in 1745. Vaughan took part in the Battle of Culloden and followed the Prince into exile. He and his brother William Vaughan were outlawed and their property seized, while they themselves fled to Spain and became officers in the army of that country. Both married Spanish women and some of their descendants settled in the home of their adoption and became grandees of Spain.

Richard Vaughan died in Barcelona in 1795 but his son William eventually returned to Wales and obtained a restoration of the main portion of his estates, as heir to his uncle. Later, John Vaughan of Courtfield, elder brother of William, took the oath of allegiance to King George III at Monmouth in 1778. Louisa Eliza Rolls, a Catholic convert who married into the recusant Vaughan family when she wed John Vaughan of Courtfield in 1830, prayed that her children might have vocations to priesthood or the religious life, and six of her sons became priests (including the later Cardinal Vaughan) and four of her daughters became nuns.

==Church and Rectory (now a Youth Hostel)==
The church of St Margaret, Welsh Bicknor, was extensively rebuilt in 1858, and was sold into private ownership in 2016.

Welsh Bicknor parish records are now held by Hereford Records Office.

There is a Youth Hostel at Welsh Bicknor, next to the church. The building had served as the rectory until it was leased to YHA in 1936. The youth hostel was called &#x27;Welsh Bicknor&#x27; for many years but was renamed YHA Wye Valley by the YHA in March 2013. The original hostel replaced the old Kerne Bridge hostel in 1936.

==Former Ross and Monmouth Railway==
The Ross and Monmouth Railway served the area from Kerne Bridge station across the River Wye. The line passed through with no intermediate station under Coppet Hill using the tunnel, with railway bridges across the Wye to Kerne Bridge in the Ross-on-Wye direction, and Lydbrook Junction in the Monmouth direction.

<doc id="771649" wikidata="Q5052453" url="?curid=771649" title="Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception (Syracuse, New York)">
<text>The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Syracuse, New York is the mother church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Syracuse. It is the seat of the Bishop of Syracuse, currently Douglas Lucia.

==History==

The church was initially constructed in 1874 by Lawrence J. O&#x27;Connor, and named Saint Mary&#x27;s Church. Formerly under the Diocese of Albany, the Diocese of Syracuse was created in 1887. In 1904, Bishop Patrick Ludden selected Saint Mary&#x27;s Church to become the new Cathedral.

Archimedes Russell, Architect was commissioned to expand the new Cathedral designing a new sanctuary and bell tower. For this purpose, the Parish purchased the La Concha Turkish bath house, demolished it and built the cathedral&#x27;s sanctuary.

Renamed The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, the new cathedral was consecrated in 1910. For the dedication, Pope Leo XIII gave Bishop Ludden a brick taken from the Holy Door at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome. When Bishop Ludden died in 1912, he was buried in the Crypt beneath the cathedral, where three other bishops and two monsignors are also buried.

==Today==
In addition to offering weekend and daily masses, the cathedral supports the Cathedral Emergency Services, offering a downtown food pantry.

Amaus Health Services at The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, Syracuse, offers interim primary medical care and dental services to those who are marginalized from the health care system, serving the economically vulnerable and uninsured, especially the homeless.

The Cathedral features the Shrine of the Blessed Mother having a statue sculpted by LeMoyne College Professor Jacqueline Belfort-Chalat.

In 2013, in the area of the Sacred Heart Altar, a mosaic was installed depicting Saint Marianne Cope surrounded by her leper patients in Hawaii. Custom made in Italy, it is 10 ft. by 5 ft. Saint Marianne Cope, a Sister of Saint Francis, was raised and ministered much of her adult life in Central New York before going to Hawaii to care for the lepers (Hansen&#x27;s Disease).

The cathedral hosts local musicals and concerts performed by both area high schools, colleges, and professional groups. A selection of works by Herbert Howells played on the cathedral&#x27;s 1892 Roosevelt-Schantz organ has been released on CD.

The Cathedral underwent a major renovation project during the spring and summer of 2017. It was rededicated on September 8, 2017. Cardinal Timothy Dolan of the Archdiocese of New York, along with Bishop Robert J. Cunningham, celebrated the re-dedication Mass.

<doc id="771650" wikidata="Q1190532" url="?curid=771650" title="Anthem of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic">
<text>The State Anthem of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic was an anthem of Lithuania under Soviet occupation from 1950 to 1989.

==History==
During the Soviet occupation in Lithuania, the anthem was officially adopted by the Lithuanian Soviet government in 1950, substituted for &quot;Tautiška giesmė&quot;, 
which had been used as a national anthem of Lithuania since 1944. In 1988, the official anthem of the Republic of Lithuania, &quot;Tautiška giesmė&quot;, was once again openly utilized as the Lithuanian anthem, and its status as the national anthem was restored by the independent Lithuanian government in 1992 and is still used today.

==Background==
The music was composed by Balys Dvarionas and Jonas Švedas, and the original lyrics authored by Antanas Venclova. After Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death, Vacys Reimeris changed the second stanza of the lyrics to remove mention of Stalin. The second stanza was changed to state that Lenin had lit the path to freedom, helped by the Russians, led by the party (Reimeris changed the word &quot;Stalin&quot; to &quot;party&quot;) and exhorted the Lithuanian people to work with the peoples of the other Soviet Republics. This Soviet era anthem was confirmed in Article 169 of the 1978 Constitution of the Lithuanian SSR. 

==Lyrics==
=== Post-Stalinist version ===
=== Original version ===
==Playback incident==
In 2015, during the victory ceremony for the Lithuanian team in World Deaf Basketball Championships in Taoyuan, Taiwan, where they achieved first place, the Soviet-era song was accidentally played, much to the surprise of the Lithuanians. The organizers promptly acknowledged their mistake and apologized.

<text>Scream of the Shalka is a Flash-animated series based on the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The series is the 40th anniversary special and was originally released in six weekly parts from 13 November to 18 December 2003 on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot; website.

Although &quot;Scream of the Shalka&quot; continues the narrative of the original 1963–1989 programme and the 1996 television film, the show&#x27;s 2005 revival ignored the events. The series was written by veteran &quot;Doctor Who&quot; writer Paul Cornell, with Richard E. Grant providing the voice for the Ninth Doctor. This performance followed years of rumours that Grant would play the Doctor in a film or new series, and indeed he had appeared as the &quot;Conceited Doctor&quot; in the Comic Relief special &quot;Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death&quot; (1999).

Grant subsequently went on to appear in the revival of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as Walter Simeon in &quot;The Snowmen&quot; (2012), and the Great Intelligence in &quot;The Bells of Saint John&quot; and &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot; (both 2013). Grant was shown alongside the Doctor&#x27;s other incarnations in the series 14 episode &quot;Rogue&quot; (2024). David Tennant, who appeared in a cameo role as the Caretaker, was cast as the Tenth Doctor in 2005. Derek Jacobi reprised his role as the Master in &quot;Utopia&quot; (2007). The Doctor&#x27;s companion for this adventure, Alison Cheney, was voiced by Sophie Okonedo, who appeared in the fifth series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as Liz Ten.

==Plot==
The TARDIS has unexpectedly materialised in the village of Lannet, Lancashire, in the year 2003. The Doctor, acting more disaffected than usual, lives with an android version of the Master, who acts as his ally. This version of the Master has the transferred consciousness of the original, but can&#x27;t leave the craft. The Doctor makes the acquaintance of Alison Cheney, a local barmaid. The other villagers refused to tell him why the other villagers seem so fearful. A tremor strikes the area, killing a homeless woman, and swallowing the TARDIS into lava below. Angered by the homeless woman&#x27;s death, the Doctor breaks into Alison&#x27;s home, and she admits to seeing aliens. The other villagers have decided to stay inside and make as little noise as possible since it attracts creatures. The Doctor deliberately attacks two of the wormlike monsters, who burst up through the floor. He deflects their shrieking sonic attack back at them and they escape.

The Doctor contacts UNIT but says he doesn&#x27;t want to get involved. He&#x27;ll leave as soon as he has his TARDIS returned to him. The Doctor leads a UNIT team down to get his ship. The creatures attack, and the Doctor separates himself from the group and meets Prime, the female commander of the Shalka Confederacy. Prime declares humans to be inferior and subject to their domination, declaring the start of an invasion of Earth. Prime orders her minions to have Alison killed, which forces the Doctor to make a deal to spare her life. The TARDIS is cast into a black hole the Shalka had created inside Earth which they are using as a gateway to bring in more troops. As he plummets into the black hole, the Doctor realizes his phone is still connected to the TARDIS and uses it to summon the ship; he and the Master expel the Shalka from the TARDIS into the black hole. For an unknown reason, the Shalka release Alison back to the surface.

As UNIT evacuates Lannet, the Doctor learns that one of the Shalka has been captured and that they have a vulnerability to pure oxygen. He also finds that the villagers have become mind-controlled by the invaders, who make them emit subsonic screams. The Earth&#x27;s ozone layer is being stripped away as the Shalka&#x27;s enslaved humans make their move all over Earth. The Doctor takes Alison and the Master back to the Shalka underground lair. Prime tells them that the Shalka inhabit 80% of the worlds in the universe. They live underground off of volcanic energy. When a species is on the edge of ecological destruction, the Shalka finish the job, with the rest of the universe none the wiser. 

The Doctor swallows a small piece of Shalka he removed from Alison&#x27;s forehead. He bonds with it, reprograms it, and uses its knowledge to plug himself into their sonic network and understand the shrieks. He engages Prime in a &quot;sonic duel&quot;, which he purposely throws but only to get Prime to move him toward the black hole controls, so that he could send Prime to her death. The Doctor coughs up the piece of Shalka. He puts it back in Alison&#x27;s head, where she fights off the remaining Shalka and shuts down the screams. The Doctor unplugs her a few moments before she can reprogram the scream to heal the atmosphere.

Back onboard the TARDIS, the Master reveals that it has been a long time since the Doctor had a living companion. His last companion was killed in the events that also led to the Master choosing to have his consciousness transferred into the android, and to the Doctor&#x27;s exile. Without being specific, the Master tells her that they are being controlled by an unknown force. The Doctor wants Alison to stay as his companion but refuses to admit to it directly. She decides to leave Earth with the Doctor and see the universe.

==Production==
&quot;Doctor Who&quot; had suspended production in 1989, and aside from charity specials had only resurfaced as an American-funded television movie in 1996, which did not garner enough ratings to go to a regular series. When &quot;Shalka&quot; was announced in July 2003 for planned broadcast in November, the possibility of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; returning to television screens still seemed remote and BBC Worldwide were continuing to shop around for another possible movie deal. As a result, BBCi officially announced, with BBC approval, that the Doctor appearing in &quot;Shalka&quot; would be the Ninth Doctor. However, events rapidly overtook this.

In September Lorraine Heggessey, the Controller of BBC One, managed to persuade BBC Worldwide that as their plans for a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; film were nowhere near fruition, BBC Television should be allowed to make a new series. A deal with Russell T Davies to produce the new series was quickly struck, and on 26 September, the BBC announced that &quot;Doctor Who&quot; would be returning to BBC One in 2005, produced by BBC Wales. As a result, the status of the &quot;Shalka&quot; webcast was in doubt even before it was released.

After the webcast, in February 2004, plans for sequels were indefinitely shelved. For a period, it was unclear if the new television Doctor would be the Ninth or Tenth Doctor, but this was ultimately settled in April 2004 when in an interview with &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;, Davies announced that the new television Doctor (played by Christopher Eccleston), would be the Ninth Doctor, relegating Grant&#x27;s Doctor to an alternate Doctor. Davies later commented that Grant had never been considered for the role in the television series, telling &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;: &quot;I thought he was terrible. I thought he took the money and ran, to be honest. It was a lazy performance. He was never on our list to play the Doctor.&quot; Grant&#x27;s likeness later appeared alongside incarnations of the Doctor in the series 14 episode &quot;Rogue&quot;.

The working title for this production was &quot;Servants of the Shalakor&quot;. This original story outline is included in the BBC Books novelization (see below).

==In print==
The novelization of &quot;Shalka&quot; was written by Paul Cornell. The book also includes a feature on the making of the webcast, as well as the original &quot;Servants of the Shalakor&quot; story outline.

== Critical analysis ==
A book length study of the serial, written by Jon Arnold, was published as part of The Black Archive series from Obverse Books in 2017. This detailed the story&#x27;s key points and the production process, and featured an in depth look at the unmade sequel story &quot;Blood of the Robots&quot;. This book also revealed that the Big Finish audio drama &quot;Immortal Beloved&quot; was originally intended as a &quot;Shalka&quot; sequel before being adapted to feature the Eighth Doctor.

==DVD release==
The British Board of Film Classification cleared all six episodes of the series for release on DVD. In March 2007, clips from the series were released to DVD, as part of &quot;Flash Frames&quot;, a documentary on the DVD release of the restored &quot;The Invasion&quot;. The story was released on DVD in Region 2 on 16 September 2013.

<text>Showaddywaddy are a rock and roll group from Leicester, England. They specialise in revivals of hit songs from the 1950s and early 1960s, while also issuing original material. They have spent 209 weeks on the UK Singles Chart, and have had 10 Top Ten singles, one reaching number one. The band were one of the leading acts in the rock and roll revival scene. Although they mainly covered American doo wop and rock and roll, they never charted in the US.

The eight piece band were known for their unusual feature of having two vocalists (Dave Bartram and Buddy Gask), two drummers (Romeo Challenger and Malcolm Allured), two guitarists (Russ Field and Trevor Oakes), and two bassists (Rod Deas and Al James). Although most have retired, a version featuring just Challenger performing and managed by Bartram still tour.

== History ==

=== Formation ===
The band was formed in 1973 by the amalgamation of two groups, Choise (Dave Bartram, Trevor Oakes, Al James, and Romeo Challenger) and the Golden Hammers (Buddy Gask, Russ Field, Rod Deas, and Malcolm Allured), the latter often known simply as The Hammers. They both played at the Fosse Way pub in Leicester, and soon discovered shared musical tastes. After playing together in jamming sessions, they joined permanently, and Showaddywaddy were born. 

The band&#x27;s first gig as professional musicians was at the Dreamland Ballroom in Margate, Kent, on 1 September 1973, although the first gigs under the Showaddywady name were in 1972. They chose the name Showaddywaddy from the word sung in the background of popular 1950s doo wop song &quot;Little Darlin&#x27;&quot; by The Diamonds.

=== 1970s–1980s ===
After a performance in a club, they were approached by an audience member from Birmingham, who asked them if they wanted to be on television; the show in question was &quot;New Faces&quot;, which was to produce its first series, they ended up going on the show, making it to the finals, and came in second place, losing to Tom Waite, on 29 December 1973. They had already signed with Bell Records prior to New Faces. Their first single, &quot;Hey Rock and Roll&quot; (written by the band), was released in April 1974. It reached number two on the UK Singles Chart.

The band are best known for wearing multi coloured Teddy boy drape jackets on stage. Bartram said that when they were on one episode of New Faces, producer Mickie Most was one of the panellists. When the cameras had shut off, he asked the group to sign with him, but because they were already with Bell Records, they couldn&#x27;t. A few weeks later, Most signed Mud to his label and got them to wear the exact same jackets as Showaddywaddy and a few days after tenure on New Faces had ended on 29 December 1973, Mud had released &quot;Tiger Feet&quot; on 4 January 1974, thus making them the first commercial rock revival band to be seen in the jackets. Bartram theorised that because Mud was only four people and they often wore the same colour jackets, compared to the eight piece multi coloured jacket Showaddywaddy, Mud didn&#x27;t have &quot;the same effect&quot;.

They had most of their biggest hits with covers of songs from the 1950s and the early 1960s. These included &quot;Three Steps to Heaven&quot; (originally by Eddie Cochran in 1960), &quot;Heartbeat&quot; (originally written and recorded by Buddy Holly), &quot;Under the Moon of Love&quot; (originally a US hit for Curtis Lee in 1961, again co-written by Tommy Boyce), &quot;When&quot; (originally by the Kalin Twins), &quot;You Got What It Takes&quot; (originally by Marv Johnson) and &quot;Dancin&#x27; Party&quot; (originally by Chubby Checker). These six singles were all produced by Mike Hurst (a former member of the Springfields). On the South African chart, &quot;Three Steps to Heaven&quot; reached number 6 in 1975 and &quot;Under the Moon of Love&quot; number 6 in 1977.

They have made nearly 300 television appearances, including their own BBC TV special, &quot;Showaddywaddyshow&quot;, broadcast between Christmas and New Year in 1980. The band also appeared in the 1975 film &quot;Three for All&quot;, where they performed &quot;The Party&quot; from their 1974 debut album. Starting with &quot;Dancin&#x27; Party&quot; (1977), the band produced their own records with more cover versions including &quot;I Wonder Why&quot; (originally by Dion and the Belmonts), &quot;Blue Moon&quot; (based on the Marcels&#x27; interpretation) and the Curtis Lee song &quot;Pretty Little Angel Eyes&quot;, co-written by Tommy Boyce. 

After their first single, Showaddywaddy went on to have a further 22 UK hits until late summer 1982. Their most recent chart single was &quot;Who Put the Bomp&quot;, a number 37 hit in 1982, which they also promoted in their final &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; performance. In total, they had ten top-ten singles, a solitary number one (&quot;Under the Moon of Love&quot; in 1976), and spent 209 weeks in the UK Singles Chart, including seven successive top-five entries. Their biggest-selling single was &quot;Under the Moon of Love&quot;, which sold 985,000 copies.

=== Later period ===
Malcolm Allured left the group in 1984, followed by Russ Field in 1985, and Buddy Gask in 1987. Field was replaced by Ray Martinez (who wrote &quot;The Only Way Out&quot; for Cliff Richard) in 1985, who was subsequently replaced by Danny Willson in 1995.

Cherry Red Records began to release Showaddywaddy&#x27;s extensive album back catalogue on CD from 2000 on their 7Ts imprint. The reissues featured rare bonus tracks, B-sides and non-album singles.

Early in 2008, the band finished recording their album &quot;The Sun Album (I Betcha Gonna Like It)&quot;, released on Voiceprint Records on 21 April 2008. A special limited edition (500 copies only) was available, signed by the whole band, and comprised a CD, a DVD, special packaging and extended sleeve notes. In September 2011, Bartram released his long-lost solo recordings from 1982 to 1985 on Invisible Hands Music; the original tapes, consisting of seventeen songs, had been in his loft for 25 years, and was entitled &quot;Lost and Found&quot;.

Al James retired from the band in 2008, playing his last gig with the band at the Cheese &amp; Grain in Frome, Somerset, on 20 December 2008. In early 2009, Trevor Oakes decided to take a break from the band due to ill health. He left the band and officially retired on 1 May 2009, meaning his last gig was also at the Cheese &amp; Grain. Danny Willson also left the band during 2009 to join Martin Turner&#x27;s Wishbone Ash, and his last gig was in Denmark on 8 August that year.

Lead singer Dave Bartram left Showaddywaddy on 3 December 2011 after 38 years fronting the band, and his last gig was at the Kings Hall Theatre in Ilkley, West Yorkshire. Bartram continues as the band&#x27;s manager, a role he has undertaken since 1984. The Ilkley gig also marked saxophonist David Graham&#x27;s last gig, who had been touring with the band since August 2009 - Graham rejoined however in 2020. When Graham left the band, they hired Dean Loach to join on keyboards and guitar, officially dropping the real saxophone instrument for the first time, with the sax effect being played on Loach&#x27;s keys instead.

=== Recently ===

In 2013, the band celebrated its 40th anniversary and undertook a UK-wide tour between 11 January and 1 June. On 17 June 2013, the band released a new collection of its entire studio recordings to celebrate their anniversary. The anthology featured the band&#x27;s entire 20th century catalogue of recorded material, including all of their original studio albums in mini-vinyl replica wallets, non-album A and B sides, together with a selection of alternative mixes and unreleased rarities unearthed from the vaults, in a 139-track, 10-CD box set. A 36-page booklet included a 7,000-word liner note from Showaddywaddy expert Steve Thorpe, and an introduction from former band member Dave Bartram. June 2013 also saw the release of their only live album to date. It contained 16 of their most famous tracks. This album was only available at live gigs with a pressing of only 1,000 copies.

Buddy Gask died on 7 June 2011 after suffering with ill health for a number of years.

Bartram did his first solo post-Showaddywaddy appearance on 1 November 2013, at Upstairs At The Western, a venue above The Western pub in Leicester, where he was interviewed by a compere and took questions from the audience in an &quot;evening with&quot;–type format. He also performed three acoustic numbers on the night, &quot;Smiling Eyes&quot;, &quot;Three Steps To Heaven&quot; and &quot;Hey Rock And Roll&quot; – the performance of &quot;Smiling Eyes&quot; was the song&#x27;s first live performance, having been originally released some 38 years earlier on the 1975 &quot;Step Two&quot; album.

In June 2014, Showaddywaddy completed the &quot;Once In A Lifetime&quot; arena tour, with Bay City Rollers (starring Les McKeown), David Essex, and The Osmonds. The same month saw the reissue of Showaddywaddy&#x27;s 2008 &quot;The Sun Album (I Betcha Gonna Like It)&quot;, which contained two new tracks.

Al James died on 16 November 2018 after falling down the stairs in his Market Harborough home.

Rod Deas retired from the band early in 2019, playing his last gig with Showaddywaddy at The Qube in Corby on Friday 25 January. Dave Bartram returned to the stage to give Rod a farewell speech before the second set. Guitarist Ray Hatfield (who joined January 2017 when Paul Dixon left), keyboardist Dean Loach, and bassist Billy Norman (who joined the band in January 2018) all left Showaddywaddy in the summer of 2020. This occurred during the Covid lockdown, and the band had stopped performing since March. Norman was replaced by Tom Bull, and Loach was replaced by Chris Savage of Mud II in August, but he left a month later after only ten gigs; Graham rejoined the band on saxophone, guitar, and bass, reintroducing the actual saxophone since he initially in 2011. Former guitarist Danny Willson returned to play with the band in September 2021 on a temporary arrangement.

On 1 December 2021, Billy Shannon and Sam Holland were added into the group. Shannon left the band on 1 November 2024. His last gig was at a Pontins in Pakefield. Former guitarist Danny Wilson played a one-off with the band the following day, in Kettering, and it was later announced by the band that Wilson would continue to perform with the band until early 2025, when Shannon&#x27;s replacement, Ed Handoll, will be ready to tour full time.

In September 2022, around £2,000 worth of merchandise fell out off their tour van, and were taken by an unknown amount of persons. Challenger&#x27;s wife eventually found some of the stock for sale on EBay, which were traced back to a Salvation Army shop in Beeston, Nottinghamshire. The shops owner claimed they were dropped off at a clothes bank. The shop returned all the remaining clothes for free. Challenger and his wife, Dawn, donated to the same Salvation Army shop as a way of thanking them.

Showaddywaddy have continued to tour, and still do around 100 dates a year in the UK and Europe. The band currently consists of one remaining original member, Romeo Challenger, along with saxophonist/guitarist David Graham who rejoined the band in 2020 (having previously toured with the band 2009 to 2011) vocalist Andy Pelos, bass player Tom Bull, guitarist and drummer Sam Holland, and vocalist and guitarist Ed Handoll.
In November 2024, to celebrate 50 years since its release, the song &quot;Hey Mister Christmas&quot; (originally released 15 November 1974) was re–issued. The song entered the UK Vinyl singles charts a week later, peaking at number one, their first number one single since &quot;Under the Moon of Love&quot; in 1976.

==== Lead vocalists ====
* Dave Bartram (member from September 1973–December 2011) – The youngest original member of SWW, Bartram was nineteen years old when he joined one of the bands predecessors, Choise. From 1967 to 1969, he had sung in Buttercup Jelly. Bartram was the core lead singer for Showaddywaddy, sometimes giving the lead vocals to Gask. Bartram retired in 2011 for many reasons including vocal strains, problems with breathing (including asthma), extreme muscle ache after a gig, and the lack of joy for performing. Bartram has managed the band since 1984, and if the group are playing near where he lives, he will sometimes come on stage during the second half of a show and introduce the band and say a few words.
* Buddy Gask (member from September 1973–September 1987) – The lead singer for SWW predecessor The Golden Hammers, William &quot;Buddy&quot; Gask was mostly a backing singer, but sometimes sang lead vocals, including two top ten hit&#x27;s: &quot;Hey Rock and Roll&quot; (UK 2) and &quot;Heartbeat&quot; (UK 7). Gask described himself as an &quot;extremist&quot; who always spoke his mind, which led to many arguments behind the scenes; Gask&#x27;s relationship with the band strained and he left the band in September 1987. He later moved to Spain, and died in 2011 aged 65. He died of cancer, but also had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.
* Andy Pelos (member from January 2012 onwards) – Pelos has worked behind the scenes in many theatre productions, Andy Pelos was a singer in Allured&#x27;s The Fabulous Teddy&#x27;s. In 2011, just before retiring, Bartram rang Pelos and asked him to take his place in 2012. Malcolm gave his blessing for him to leave T.F.T to join Showaddywaddy, and has been the lead singer since. He also plays guitar on stage. Gigs had to be postponed in September 2021, when Pelos tested positive for Covid-19.
* Billy Shannon (member from December 2021–November 2024) – The youngest member to ever join Showaddywaddy, he was from Rushall, and later lived in Telford. He started uploading videos of him singing 50s/60s rock and roll songs on YouTube in 2011. Billy Shannon is a stage name which he got after merging the names of singers Billy Fury and Del Shannon, which his uncle made up when Billy was four. He joined the group alongside Sam Holland in December 2021, and left the band in November 2024. In January 2025, he started work as a Dr. Hook tribute act.

==== Guitarists ====
* Russ Field (member from September 1973–July 1985) – The guitarist for The Golden Hammers, Field was the main guitarist for the original SWW. Unlike most members, he rarely switched instruments or performed choreographed dances on stage, but did sometimes play bass on stage. He left the band in July 1985 after a gig in Hillsborough Park, Sheffield on 20 July 1985. He no longer enjoyed touring and had a disagreement with the band regarding fees from a tour in Ireland in 1984. He made a guest appearance with The Fabulous Teddys with Allured and Gask in 2001, and from 1989 to 2017 ran a guest house in Berwick. Field also ran a guest house with his wife in Beadnell, Northumberland, and still plays guitar in a local covers band, Before The Mast. 
* Ray Martinez (member from August 1985–Spring 1995) – The first non-original member to join SWW, he replaced Russ Field. He was a member of prog rock band Spring from 1971 to 1972. He wrote &quot;The Only Way Out&quot;, a top ten for Cliff Richard in 1982. Martinez left Showaddywaddy in 1995, and later The Fabulous Teddys. He now lives in Monmouth where he teaches guitar.
* Danny Willson (member from 1995–August 2009/ September–November 2021 / November 2024 onwards) – Playing guitar since age eight, Willson joined Showaddywaddy in 1995 after Ray Martinez left. In March 2008, Willson joined Martin Turner&#x27;s Wishbone Ash, performing with the group when performances didn&#x27;t clash with Showaddywaddy. In 2009, he decided to join M.T.W.A. full time, and parted ways with SWW in August 2009, playing his last gig in Holstebro, Denmark on 8 August. The band were upset to see him go, but were happy that he was now joining a group who played music that influenced him more to originally play guitar as a child. Willson has returned to the group for a few gigs as a fill-in member in more recent years; he played a few gigs between September–November 2021, and has been an additional member for a few performances since November 2024.
* Paul Dixon (member from December 2008–January 2017) – Although joining full time in December 2008 when original member Al James retired, he started playing concerts in August 2008, when Willson became a father and took a short paternity leave. A former member of The Fabulous Teddys, he and Willson knew each other as his brother Rick was also in the Teddys. Dixon was fired from the band in January 2017 due to disagreements between him and the band. His last gig was at Whitley Bay Playhouse on 28 January.
* Rob Hewins (member from January 2012–November 2021) – A drummer since age 12, Hewins was a member of Ultravox for one week. He was the drummer for Alvin Stardust for six years, and then joined Martin Turner&#x27;s Wishbone Ash for five years starting in 2005, and his tenure briefly collided with Willson. He left in 2010, and twelve months later joined SWW after Bartram retired. On stage, he changed to guitar. Hewins left Showaddywaddy in November 2021, after playing his last gig at Bridlington Spa on 26 November.
* Ray Hatfield (February 2017–March 2020) – Also a former member of Martin Turner&#x27;s Wishbone Ash, Hatfield was a guitarist from 2005 to 2015, Hatfield joined in February 2017. Hatfield left the band along with Dean Loach and Billy Norman in March 2020. Their last gig was on 18 March 2020 at Butlins, Skegness (Showaddywaddy&#x27;s last gig before Covid-19 lockdown).
* Sam Holland (member from December 2021 onwards) – Holland played for many bands on cruise ships, until being invited to SWW in December 2021. He also plays drums and the timpani when Romeo Challenger is in centre stage.
*Ed Handoll — vocals / guitar (member since December 2024) – A musician and theatre actor who has worked in the west end, Handoll joined the group in December 2024, replacing Billy Shannon. Because of commitments to another band, Handoll did not join full time until January 2025, during which different guitarists (Geoff Saunders, Adam Ellis, and Danny Willson) stood in for him.

==== Bassists ====
* Rod Deas (member from September 1973–January 2019) – Originally a bassist for The Golden Hammers, he was the main bass player for SWW from 1973 until 2019. He also performed choreographed dances with Gask, James, and Allured. Deas retired from January 2019, playing his last gig with the band at The Qube in Corby on 25 January.
* &quot;Al James&quot; (member from September 1973–December 2008) – Choise&#x27;s bass player, Geoff Betts aka Al James, was a backing singer with Gask, but also played bass when Rod Deas was dancing around the stage. James retired from the band in December 2008, playing his last gig Cheese &amp; Grain in Frome, Somerset, on 20 December 2008. James later suffered several bouts of cancer, which weakened his body. In October 2018, he fell down the stairs in his Market Harborough home; he lived by himself so it took hours for anyone to help him. He died from complications from the fall at Kettering General Hospital on 16 November 2018, aged 72.
* Billy Norman (member from January 2018–March 2020) – Norman joined as a fill in member in January 2018 when Deas&#x27; attendance was starting to dwindle. Norman left the band along with Dean Loach and Ray Hatfield in March 2020. Their last gig was on 18 March 2020 at Butlins, Skegness (Showaddywaddy&#x27;s last gig before Covid-19 lockdown).
* Tom Bull (member since August 2020) – Bull joined on bass during lockdown in August 2020, five months after Billy Norman left. His first gig was at Norton Grange Coastal Village on the Isle of Wight on 20 September 2020.

==== Saxophonists ====
* Trevor Oakes (member from September 1973–May 2009) – The guitarist for Choise, Oakes was the saxophonist for the band, although did not play the sax on &quot;Under the Moon of Love&quot; (that was Jeff Daly). He also played guitar and danced. Oakes missed out on many gigs in 2009 due to health problems, and officially retired on 1 May 2009; he played his last gig at the Cheese &amp; Grain in Frome, Somerset, on 20 December 2008, which was also original member Al James&#x27; last gig before retiring. He started playing solo gigs a few years later. He has dementia. Trevor Oakes is the father of footballers Scott Oakes and Stefan Oakes. 
* David Graham (member from July 2009–August 2011 / September 2020 onwards) – Replacing Oakes as the sax player, former music teacher David Graham debuted on the stage one month before joining full time; he played the sax live for &quot;Under the Moon of Love&quot; on 9 July 2009 at the Assembly Rooms in Tamworth, which was also Willson&#x27;s last gig. Graham joined full time one month later, making his first real performance at Retrofest in Glasgow on 29 August 2009. He left in December 2011 at the same time as Dave Bartram as he felt too much pressure working both Showaddywaddy and as a solo artist in his own agency (the agency in question, DG Music, was bought by another local company in December 2024). Nine years later, Graham rejoined the band.

==== Keyboardists ====
* Dean Loach (member from January 2012–March 2020) – Loach was the first full time keyboardist to join the band in January 2012, when the group ditched the saxophone following Graham&#x27;s departure. Loach played the saxophone notes on the keys, and also played rhythm guitar. Loach left the band along with Billy Norman and Ray Hatfield in March 2020. Their last gig was on 18 March 2020 at Butlins, Skegness (Showaddywaddy&#x27;s last gig before Covid-19 lockdown).
* Chris Savage (member from August–September 2020) – The keyboardist for Mud II since 2004, Savage joined SWW for one month in 2020, just as they were starting to perform again due to lockdown. He joined in August 2020, and left in the September, playing a total of ten gigs, his last being at Great Yarmouth on 14 September.

==== Drummers ====
* Romeo Challenger (member from September 1973 onwards) – The drummer for Choise, Challenger has been the drummer and timpani player for Showaddywaddy since the group began. He remains in the band to this day, the only constant member and the sole original member since 2019. Challenger is the father of Benjamin Challenger who trialled for Leicester City before playing basketball for Leicester Riders, and then moved into athletics, gaining medals in the high jump at the 1998 and 2002 Commonwealth Games. 
* Malcolm Allured (member from September 1973–mid 1984) – The oldest original member of Showaddywaddy, Allured, nicknamed The Duke, mostly performed choreographed dances on stage, but also played double drumming with Challenger. He left the band in 1984, the first original member to depart.

<doc id="771656" wikidata="Q4993570" url="?curid=771656" title="Woodstock (song)">
<text>&quot;Woodstock&quot; is a song written by Canadian-American singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell. At least four versions of the song were released in 1970. Mitchell&#x27;s own version was first performed live in 1969 and appeared in April 1970 on her album &quot;Ladies of the Canyon&quot; and as the B-side to her single &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot;. A version by Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young appeared on their album &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; in March 1970 and became a staple of classic rock radio and the best-known version of the song in the United States. A third version, by the British band Matthews Southern Comfort, became the best-known version in the United Kingdom and was the highest charting version of the song in the UK, reaching the top of the Singles Chart in 1970. A fourth version by studio project the Assembled Multitude also became a chart hit.

The song&#x27;s lyrics refer to the four-day Woodstock Music and Arts Festival held in August 1969, and tell the story of a concert-goer on a trek to Max Yasgur&#x27;s farm in New York State to join in the &quot;song and celebration&quot;. Mitchell, who was unable to perform at the festival herself, was inspired to write the song after she heard an account of it from her then-boyfriend Graham Nash, who had performed at the festival. Mitchell&#x27;s anthemic song and the festival it commemorated became symbolic of the counterculture of the 1960s.

== Lyrics ==
Joni Mitchell&#x27;s lyrics were based on the description of the Woodstock Music and Art Festival she was given by her then-boyfriend, Graham Nash. She had not been able to go to the festival herself because a manager had told her that it would be more advantageous for her to appear on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;. She composed the song in a hotel room in New York City as she watched televised reports of the festival. &quot;The deprivation of not being able to go provided me with an intense angle on Woodstock&quot;, she told an interviewer afterwards. David Crosby, interviewed for the documentary &quot;Joni Mitchell: Woman of Heart and Mind,&quot; said Mitchell had captured in her song the feeling and importance of the Woodstock festival better than anyone who had actually been there.

The lyrics tell the story of a spiritual journey to Max Yasgur&#x27;s farm, where the festival was held, and make use of sacred imagery, comparing the festival site with the Garden of Eden (&quot;and we&#x27;ve got to get ourselves back to the garden&quot;). The saga commences with the narrator&#x27;s encounter of a fellow traveler (&quot;Well, I came upon a child of God, he was walking along the road&quot;) and concludes with their arrival at their destination (&quot;by the time we got to Woodstock, we were half a million strong&quot;).
There is also reference to the &quot;mutual assured destruction&quot; ideology of the Cold War (&quot;bombers riding shotgun in the sky...&quot;), contrasted with the peaceful intent of the festival goers (&quot;...turning into butterflies above our nation&quot;).

== Releases and cover versions ==
=== Joni Mitchell ===
Mitchell performed &quot;Woodstock&quot; seated at a piano at the 1969 Big Sur Folk Festival, one month after Woodstock, prior to its release on any album. Her solo performance can be seen in the festival concert film &quot;Celebration at Big Sur&quot;, released in 1971. (Mitchell had not yet developed her distaste for large festival gigs.) &quot;Woodstock&quot; was released on Mitchell&#x27;s third album, &quot;Ladies of the Canyon&quot; in March 1970, and served as the B-side for the album&#x27;s single, &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot;. She re-recorded &quot;Woodstock&quot; for her two live albums, &quot;Miles of Aisles&quot; and &quot;Shadows and Light&quot;. The original track was included on the 1996 compilation &quot;Hits&quot; and featured a stark and haunting arrangement of solo vocal, multi-tracked backing vocals and tremoloed Wurlitzer electric piano, all performed by Mitchell.

=== Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young ===
At about the same time that &quot;Ladies of the Canyon&quot; appeared, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young&#x27;s upbeat rock arrangement of &quot;Woodstock&quot; was released as the lead single from their 1970 &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; album. The CSNY version opened with a lead guitar riff played by Neil Young, who also played the solo. Stephen Stills sang the lead vocal, with backing harmonies from David Crosby, Graham Nash, and Young. The Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young version of &quot;Woodstock&quot; was also notable for its stop-time instrument patterns, just prior to the &quot;We are stardust, we are golden...&quot; chorus.

Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young had learned the song from Mitchell, who was Nash&#x27;s girlfriend at the time, but the band&#x27;s version introduced major changes in tone. Jimi Hendrix was involved early in the song&#x27;s development, and a recording taped on 30 September 1969, half a year before the album came out, with Hendrix playing bass and overdubbing guitar, was released in 2018 on the album &quot;Both Sides of the Sky&quot;. Sound engineer Eddie Kramer stated that with Jimi was &quot;... helping the song along, it sounds like Crosby, Stills &amp; Hendrix&quot;. The final version had Stephen Stills singing a slightly rearranged version of Mitchell&#x27;s lyrics which put the line &quot;we are billion year old carbon&quot;, which only appeared in her final chorus, into each of the first three choruses. That line was replaced with &quot;we are caught in the devil&#x27;s bargain&quot; in the last chorus, which was also in Mitchell&#x27;s final chorus.

&quot;Woodstock&quot; was one of the few &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; tracks on which Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young all performed their parts in the same session. The original lead vocal by Stephen Stills was later partly replaced with a vocal recorded by Stills, who recalled: &quot;I replaced one and a half verses that were excruciatingly out of tune.&quot; Neil Young disagreed, saying that &quot;the track was magic. Then later on [Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash] were in the studio nitpicking [with the result that] Stephen erased the vocal and put another one on that wasn&#x27;t nearly as good.&quot;

The Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young version of &quot;Woodstock&quot; peaked at #11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in May 1970 and #3 in Canada. A different recording of &quot;Woodstock&quot; by Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young was played under the closing credits of the documentary film &quot;Woodstock&quot; released March 1970.

&quot;Cash Box&quot; said that &quot;C, S, N &amp; Y steam along with a splendid song by Joni Mitchell&quot; and &quot;the foursome offer some much more solid undercurrents in the instrumental end.&quot;

=== Matthews Southern Comfort ===
&quot;Woodstock&quot; became an international hit in 1970 and 1971 thanks to a recording by Matthews Southern Comfort. The group performed &quot;Woodstock&quot; in the UK&#x27;s &quot;Live in Concert&quot; program, broadcast by BBC Radio 1 on 28 June 1970. Front man Iain Matthews recalled later that the group had prepared three songs for the session but the BBC needed one more, and he had suggested an impromptu cover of &quot;Woodstock&quot;, having heard Joni Mitchell&#x27;s version on her &quot;Ladies of the Canyon&quot; album earlier that week. There was a positive response to the song after the broadcast and the BBC contacted Matthews&#x27;s label, Uni Records. According to Matthews, the label &quot;had no idea what the [BBC] were talking about and contacted my management, who asked me about it. Uni suggested that we record the song and add it to the newly recorded Matthews Southern Comfort album, &quot;Later That Same Year&quot;. I declined to mess with the completed album, but agreed to have them release the song as a single.&quot;

Matthews said his band&#x27;s BBC Radio performance of &quot;Woodstock&quot; echoed the original, but for the studio recording of the song, made at Morgan Sound in Willesden Green, London, the band radically changed the arrangement. Matthews later admitted to unease when he eventually met Joni Mitchell because he had changed the melody of the song (&quot;... I couldn&#x27;t reach [her] high notes&quot;) but Mitchell said she preferred his arrangement. Matthews Southern Comfort bassist Andy Leigh recalled, &quot;We took [the song] apart and reassembled it and we knew we had something. We were an album band. We didn&#x27;t do singles.&quot; (Uni had issued one single off each of the first two of the three Matthews Southern Comfort albums, but neither charted.) &quot;But we knew this [track] ... was something special.&quot;

MCA Records, Uni&#x27;s parent company, agreed to release Matthews Southern Comfort&#x27;s version of &quot;Woodstock&quot; only if the Crosby Stills Nash &amp; Young version failed to chart in the United Kingdom. When that proved to be the case, Leigh said MCA &quot;reluctantly released ours because of that agreement, but they wouldn&#x27;t spend a penny on promotion ... But our managers, who were excellent, hired a PR, a song-plugger. Tony Blackburn, who had the breakfast show on Radio 1, played &#x27;Woodstock&#x27; and kept playing it and other DJs started doing the same.&quot; Matthews recalled that once Blackburn had made &quot;Woodstock&quot; by Matthews Southern Comfort his record of the week, &quot;it began to sell 30,000 copies a day, eventually going from #10 to #1 in a week.&quot;

Issued on 24 July 1970, &quot;Woodstock&quot; debuted on the UK Top 50 on 26 September 1970 and reached #1 on 31 October 1970, remaining there for two additional weeks. It was a #2 hit in Ireland and had widespread success in Europe, charting in Austria (#15), Denmark (#9), Finland (#23), Germany (#27), the Netherlands (#17), Norway (#2), Poland (#2), and Sweden (#2). In early 1971 the track also reached #3 in South Africa, #4 in New Zealand and was a minor hit in Australia (#55).

In November 1970, &quot;Woodstock&quot; by Matthews Southern Comfort had its US single release on the group&#x27;s regular US label, Decca Records, another MCA affiliate. Initially the single&#x27;s US release had only a marginal impact, spending six weeks on the 101–150 singles chart in &quot;Record World&quot; in December 1970 – January 1971 and then dropping off, having peaked at #110. But after its January 1971 single release in Canada, where a 30% Canadian Content radio airplay quota was being phased in, the track received airplay, at least partially because of its Canadian author, and assisted by airplay on Canadian radio stations with US listeners, notably CKLW, the Windsor ON station credited with the track&#x27;s Canadian &quot;breakout&quot;, &quot;Woodstock&quot; gained newfound US interest, debuting on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 of 6 March 1971 at #83 and rising to a #23 Hot 100 that May. In Canada &quot;Woodstock&quot; reached a #5 peak on the &quot;RPM&quot; 100 singles chart.

By the time of the North American success of Matthews Southern Comfort&#x27;s &quot;Woodstock&quot;, the band was no more. An October 1970 shake-up at MCA Records (UK) had resulted in the band splitting with MCA , causing the cancellation of a US tour that was set to begin that November, the month of &quot;Woodstock&#x27;s&quot; US single release. In December 1970 Matthews abruptly quit the band. He later attributed his departure to the demands that came with the band&#x27;s success with &quot;Woodstock&quot;. He said, &quot;It created all this peripheral stuff that took up my time. What would&#x27;ve been time learning to be a songwriter, became time spent doing interviews, photographs, tours and appearances;&quot; &quot;It all came to a head after a dreadful soundcheck at Birmingham town hall. I left the building, walked down to the station, got on a train home and locked my door for a week.&quot; Matthews&#x27; debut solo album &quot;If You Saw Thro&#x27; My Eyes&quot; was released on Vertigo Records on 1 May 1971. His former band co-members had three Harvest Records album releases as Southern Comfort before disbanding in 1972.

In the UK, &quot;Woodstock&quot; was the final single release by Matthews Southern Comfort, who had released two previous non-charting UK singles, and &quot;Woodstock&quot; remained Matthews&#x27; sole UK charting single. (Although previously a member of Fairport Convention, he had not featured on their one charting single, &quot;Si tu dois partir&quot;, and he did not rank in the UK charts as a solo artist). In other territories, two further tracks were issued as singles from the third and final Matthews Southern Comfort album, &quot;Later That Same Year,&quot; which outside the UK included &quot;Woodstock&quot; : &quot;Mare, Take Me Home&quot; and &quot;Tell Me Why&quot;, both of which made the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at respectively #96 and #98, while &quot;Mare, Take Me Home&quot; peaked at #86 in Canada Matthews Southern Comfort had a total of four US single releases, having had one non-charting US single, &quot;Colorado Springs Eternal&quot;, in April 1970. Iain Matthews – as Ian Matthews – as a solo act placed three singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and also the Canadian charts, one of which, the November 1978 release &quot;Shake It&quot;, became a major hit, reaching a &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 peak of #13 in April 1979, and reaching #6 in Canada.

Despite his difficulties with the success of &quot;Woodstock&quot; in 1970, Matthews said in 2017, &quot;Any kind of success in this business takes me by surprise. &#x27;Woodstock&#x27; was the first and most exciting. It&#x27;s still opening new doors to this day.&quot;

<text>Immediate early genes (IEGs) are genes which are activated transiently and rapidly in response to a wide variety of cellular stimuli. They represent a standing response mechanism that is activated at the transcription level in the first round of response to stimuli, before any new proteins are synthesized. IEGs are distinct from &quot;late response&quot; genes, which can only be activated later, following the synthesis of early response gene products. Thus IEGs have been called the &quot;gateway to the genomic response&quot;. The term can describe viral regulatory proteins that are synthesized following viral infection of a host cell, or cellular proteins that are made immediately following stimulation of a resting cell by extracellular signals.

In their role as &quot;gateways to genomic response&quot;, many IEG products are natural transcription factors or other DNA-binding proteins. However, other important classes of IEG products include secreted proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, and receptor subunits. Neuronal IEGs are used prevalently as a marker to track brain activities in the context of memory formation and development of psychiatric disorders. IEGs are also of interest as a therapeutic target for treatment of human cytomegalovirus.

== Types ==

The earliest identified and best characterized IEGs include &quot;c-fos&quot;, &quot;c-myc&quot; and &quot;c-jun&quot;, genes that were found to be homologous to retroviral oncogenes. Thus IEGs are well known as early regulators of cell growth and differentiation signals. However, other findings suggest roles for IEGs in many other cellular processes. Arc/Arg3.1, Zif268 and Homer are IEGs that regulate synaptic strength in neurons.

== Regulation ==

Expression of IEGs occurs in response to internal and external cell signals, occurring rapidly without the need to synthesize new transcription factors. The genetic sequences of IEGs are generally shorter in length (~19kb) and exhibit an enrichment of specific transcription factor binding sites, offering redundancy in transcription initiation. Translation of IEG mRNA into proteins occurs regardless of protein synthesis inhibitors which disrupts the process of protein production. Rapid expression of IEGs is also attributed to the accessibility of its promotor sequence through histone acetylation that is consistent pre- and post-expression. Downregulation of mRNA transcription occurs through redundant targeting of the 3&#x27; UTR region by microRNAs, resulting in translational repression and degradation. The expression of IEG protein is often transient due to rapid mRNA downregulation and increased proteolysis of translated products.

== Function ==
Activation of gene transcription is a complex system of signal cascades and recruitment of necessary components such as RNA polymerase and transcription factors. IEGs are often the first responders to regulatory signals with many reaching peak expression within 30 minutes after stimuli compared to 2–4 hours in the case of delayed primary response gene. There are many signaling pathways leading to the activation of IEGs, many of which (MAPK/ERK, PI3K, etc.) are studied in the context of cancer. As such, many IEGs function as transcription factors regulating expression of downstream genes or are proto-oncogenes associated with altered cell growth.

== IEGs in neurobiological research ==
Expression of IEGs is involved in neuronal activity and specifically memory formation, neuropsychiatric diseases, and behavioral activities. Immediate early genes present in the brain are associated with a range of functions such as modifying synaptic functions through transient and rapid activation growth factors or the expression of cellular proteins. These changes are theorized to be the means in which memory is stored in the brain as outline in the concept of memory trace or engram. In the context of neuropsychiatric diseases, up-regulation of certain IEGs related to the formation of fear-related memories contribute to the development of a variety of disease such as schizophrenia, Panic disorder, Post-traumatic stress disorder

=== Memory formation ===

Some IEGs such as &quot;ZNF268&quot; and Arc have been implicated in learning and memory and long-term potentiation.

A wide range of neuronal stimulation have been shown to induce IEG expression ranging from sensory and behavioral to drug-induced convulsions. As such, IEGs are utilized as a marker to understand neuronal ensembles associated with formations of certain memories such as fear, commonly attributed to the development of psychiatric disorders. For example, neurons expression &quot;Arc&quot; in the hippocampus show phenotypic and behavioral differences in response to stimuli such as altered dendritic spine morphology or spontaneous firing rate. This association suggests the expression of certain IEGs in response to a stimulus results in expansion of the related neuronal circuit by incorporating the activated neuron assembles. Other IEGs effect different neural properties with knock out of &quot;Arc&quot; showing adverse affects on the formation of long-term memory. These findings offer insight into the molecular mechanism and functional changes brought about by IEG expression, expanding the theory of memory trace.

Memory consolidation during a learning experience depends on the rapid expression of a set of IEGs in brain neurons. In general, expression of genes often can be epigenetically repressed by the presence of 5-methylcytosine in the DNA promoter regions of the genes. However, in the case of IEGs associated with memory consolidation demethylation of 5-methylcytosine to form the normal base cytosine can induce rapid gene expression. Demethylation appears to occur by a DNA repair process involving the GADD45G protein.

=== Psychiatric disorders ===
IEGs are used as markers in animal models of depression. Affected mice have altered levels of &quot;Arc,&quot;affecting synaptic activity, and &quot;EGR1,&quot; involved in memory trace encoding. Other neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia also exhibit altered IEG expression, with recent studies showing a correlation of low expression of &quot;EGR3&quot;, a transcription factor downstream of NMDARs, in patients exhibiting schizophrenia. As such, IEGs are crucial markers in evaluating neuronal activity in the context of psychiatric illness with its expression pattern shaped by environmental and genetic factors.

== Potential therapeutic applications ==

=== Human cytomegalovirus ===
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a prevalent beta herpesvirus that remains in the latent state, going unnoticed in healthy individuals but having serious consequences if the individual is immunocompromised. The virus cycles in and out of the latent state and is characterized by different gene expression regions: immediate-early (IE), early, and late. Conventional anti-viral treatments such as Ganciclovir use nucleoside analogs to target the early events of the viral replication cycles, however, these approaches are prone to developing resistance. Targeting IE1 and IE2 are thought to be crucial in regulating the pathogenesis of HCMV and retaining the virus in the latent state. Viral proteins derived from IE1 and IE2 regulate viral latency by controlling subsequent expression of early and late genes. Silencing of IE gene expression through antisense oligonucleotides, RNA interference, and gene-targeting ribosomes have been investigated for therapeutic applications. Alternatively, the rise of CRISPR technology allows for precise DNA editing that can knockout HCMV genes responsible for IE transcription. DNA targeting is more effective in latent infections, in which viral mRNA is absent or at a low concentration. Small molecule chemical inhibitors are also being investigated that target epigenetic factors and signaling proteins involved in IE expression.

<text>Sir Samuel Ferguson (10 March 1810 – 9 August 1886) was an Irish poet, barrister, antiquarian, artist and public servant. He was an acclaimed 19th-century Irish poet, and his interest in Irish mythology and early Irish history can be seen as a forerunner of William Butler Yeats and the other poets of the Irish Literary Revival.

==Early life==

Ferguson was born in Belfast, Ireland (now Northern Ireland) the third son of John Ferguson and Agnes Knox. His father was a spendthrift and his mother was a conversationalist and lover of literature, who read out the works of Shakespeare, Walter Scott, Keats, Shelley and other English-language authors to her six children.

Ferguson lived at a number of addresses, including Glenwhirry, where he later said he acquired a love of nature that inspired his works. He studied at the Belfast Academy and the Belfast Academical Institution. Later, he moved to Dublin, for law education at Trinity College, obtaining his BA in 1826 and his MA in 1832.

His father had exhausted the family property and Ferguson was forced to support himself through his student years. He turned to writing and was a regular contributor to &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; by the age of 22. He was called to the bar in 1838, but continued to write and publish, both in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s&quot; and in the newly established &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot;.

==Later life==

Ferguson settled in Dublin, where he practiced law. In 1846, he toured European museums, libraries and archaeological sites with strong connections to Irish scholarship.

He married Mary Guinness (1823–1905) in 1848, a great-great-niece of Arthur Guinness, and the eldest daughter of Robert Rundell Guinness who founded the Guinness Mahon bank. At that time he was defending the Young Irelander poet Richard Dalton Williams. He retired from the bar in 1867 when he was appointed First Deputy Keeper of Public Records of Ireland.

As well as his poetry, Ferguson contributed a number of articles on topics of Irish interest to antiquarian journals. In 1863, he traveled in Brittany, Ireland, Wales, England and Scotland to study megaliths and other archaeological sites. These studies were important to his major antiquarian work, &quot;Ogham Inscriptions in Ireland, Wales, and Scotland&quot;, which was edited after his death by his widow and published in 1887.

His collected poems, &quot;Lays of the Western Gael&quot; was published in 1865, resulting in the award of a degree LL.D. &quot;honoris causa&quot; from Trinity. He wrote many of his poems with both Irish and English translations. He received a knighthood in 1878.

Ferguson&#x27;s major work, the long poem &quot;Congal&quot; was published in 1872 and a third volume, &quot;Poems&quot; in 1880. In 1882, he was elected president of the Royal Irish Academy, an organisation dedicated to the advancement of science, literature and antiquarian studies. His house in North Great George&#x27;s Street, Dublin, was open to everyone interested in art, literature or music.

Ferguson gave the Rhind Lectures in 1884, on &#x27;Ogham inscriptions in Ireland and Scotland&#x27;.

He died in Howth, just outside Dublin city, and was buried in Donegore near Templepatrick, County Antrim.
