<text>Adler Berriman &quot;Barry&quot; Seal (July 16, 1939 – February 19, 1986) was an American commercial airline pilot who became a major drug smuggler for the Medellín Cartel. When Seal was convicted of smuggling charges, he became an informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration and testified in several major drug trials. He was murdered on February 19, 1986, by contract killers hired by the cartel.

==Early life and career==
Adler Berriman Seal was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the son of Mary Lou (née Delcambre) and Benjamin Curtis Seal, a candy wholesaler. Seal began to fly as a teenager, earning a student pilot certificate at 16 and a private pilot&#x27;s certificate at 17. His flight instructor described him as a naturally gifted pilot.

In 1962, Seal enlisted in the Louisiana Army National Guard for six years: six months of active duty, followed by five and a half years of inactive duty. Seal&#x27;s active duty began in July 1962. He was assigned to the 20th Special Forces Group and graduated from the United States Army Airborne School selection and training. His non-active duty was served in the 245th Engineer Battalion, where his military occupation code was radio telephone operator.

In 1964, Seal joined TWA as a flight engineer and was soon promoted to the first officer, then captain, flying a Boeing 707 on a regular Western Europe route. He was one of the youngest 707 command pilots in the TWA fleet. Seal&#x27;s career with TWA ended in July 1972, when he was arrested for involvement in a conspiracy to smuggle a shipment of plastic explosives to Mexico using a DC-4. The case was eventually dismissed in 1974 for prosecutorial misconduct, but in the meantime TWA fired Seal, who had falsely taken medical leave to participate in the scheme.

==Drug smuggling==
Seal admitted that he started smuggling small amounts of marijuana by air in early 1976. By 1978, he had expanded to flying significant loads of cocaine, pound-for-pound a much more profitable enterprise than marijuana smuggling.

Seal&#x27;s operations received an important boost when he was arrested and jailed in Honduras on the return leg of a drug-smuggling trip to Ecuador. Seal made important connections while in prison in Honduras, including Emile Camp, a fellow Louisiana pilot and smuggler who became one of Seal&#x27;s closest associates, and Ellis McKenzie, a local Honduran smuggler. Also, after his release from prison Seal met William Roger Reaves on the flight back to the U.S. It was Reaves who provided Seal with his first connection to the Medellín Cartel.

To expand his smuggling capacity, Seal also hired William Bottoms, his ex-brother-in-law, as a pilot. From 1980 on, Bottoms was the main pilot in Seal&#x27;s smuggling enterprise, often flying with Camp while Seal oversaw planning and operations.

In 1981, Seal began smuggling cocaine for the Medellín Cartel. At his peak, he earned as much as $500,000 per flight transporting shipments of cocaine from Colombia to the United States.

Seal&#x27;s smuggling method was to use low-flying planes and airdrop drug packages in remote areas of Louisiana. They were then picked up by Seal&#x27;s ground team and transported to the Colombian distributors in Florida. By 1982, Seal was using over a dozen aircraft in his smuggling operation. The number of planes and the frequency of flights soon attracted the attention of Louisiana State Police and Federal investigators.

To avoid this unwanted attention, Seal moved his aircraft to Mena Intermountain Regional Airport in Mena, Arkansas, where he did maintenance and modifications to improve the planes&#x27; carrying capacity and avionics. Seal&#x27;s activities in Mena later became the subject of rumor and controversy, but according to Seal&#x27;s biographer, former FBI agent Del Hahn, Seal did not use Mena as a drug transshipment point. However, an &quot;extensive joint investigation&quot; by the FBI, Arkansas State Police, and IRS revealed in 2020 that Barry Seal had in fact used the Mena airport for &quot;smuggling activity&quot; from late 1980 until March 1984.

=== Florida indictments and convictions ===
By 1981, DEA agents in Florida were aware of Seal&#x27;s smuggling activities. In April 1981, a DEA informant introduced Seal to an undercover DEA agent. After several months of contact, the undercover agent negotiated a deal with Seal to smuggle 1,200 pounds of methaqualone tablets into the United States (the tablets were counterfeits, made of chalk). The investigation into Seal was part of a major undercover operation called Operation Screamer in which over 80 pilots were eventually indicted. Two indictments were returned against Seal in March 1983. The first indictment charged Seal alone with two counts of conspiracy to distribute methaqualone. The second indictment charged Seal and three others with multiple counts of possession and distribution of methaqualone, phenobarbital, and meperidine.

Seal surrendered to federal authorities at the end of April 1983 and attempted to make a deal, first with the Florida task force, then with the Baton Rouge task force. Both rejected any deals, even though Seal told them a little about his involvement with the Ochoa family. Without a deal, Seal was tried in February 1984. After a month-long trial, Seal was convicted on all counts listed by the first indictment.

== Undercover work ==
In March of 1984, now facing a ten-year prison sentence, Seal decided to contact the South Florida Task Force - a cross-agency drug interdiction team led by then-Vice President George H.W. Bush. The office referred Seal to the DEA headquarters, which assigned DEA agent Ernst Jacobsen to debrief Seal and evaluate his potential as an informant. Jacobsen was impressed with Seal&#x27;s connections, especially those with the Ochoa family. On March 28, Seal signed a letter in which he agreed to act as a DEA informant. Afterwards, Seal pleaded guilty to the second indictment in Florida. Seal was then released from custody, with the terms of his sentence dependent upon his performance as an informant.

The South Florida Task Force planned an operation that directed Seal to set up a cocaine purchase with the Ochoas and other cartel members, which would provide a basis for future indictments in the United States. Seal had concealed his true identity in previous dealings with the cartel by using the name Ellis McKenzie (an associate that Seal had previously worked with). Through his cartel contacts in Miami, Seal arranged a meeting using the same alias. He flew down to Medellín for the meeting on April 8, and was accompanied by a Miami based cartel pilot who was unaware of Seal&#x27;s role as an informant.

=== In Nicaragua ===
Participants at the meeting included Pablo Escobar and Jorge, Fabio Jr., and Juan David Ochoa. The Colombian government had recently conducted a major raid on the cartel&#x27;s manufacturing facilities at a remote jungle location called Tranquilandia, resulting in the destruction of millions of dollars of both processed and unprocessed cocaine. Seal&#x27;s claims about this meeting and its aftermath, as presented by the Reagan administration, were denied by the Sandinista government and resulted in serious scrutiny by the media. 

According to Seal, the traffickers were making arrangements to set up shipping and production facilities in Nicaragua, where they had struck a deal with the Sandinista government. These arrangements were not yet complete, so Seal&#x27;s first shipment was to be a direct flight to the U.S. Originally planned for mid-April, the flight did not take place until the end of May. When it did, the overloaded plane crashed at the Colombia airfield on takeoff. The cartel provided a new plane, but it lacked the capacity for a direct flight to the U.S., so the cartel arranged a stopover in Nicaragua, which was earlier than the originally planned stopover at an airfield in Los Brasiles near Managua. After refueling, Seal left Los Brasiles, flying without lights, and was fired upon by Nicaraguan military units as he flew near Managua. The plane was hit by gunfire, and Seal had to make an emergency landing at Sandino International Airport in Managua. The drugs were unloaded by the military, and Seal and his co-pilot were taken to detention in downtown Managua. They were then released to the cartel&#x27;s Nicaraguan contact, Federico Vaughan. This account was criticized by reporter Jonathan Kwinty, then working as a staff reporter at the Wall Street Journal, in a critique of the administration&#x27;s claims in April 1987, who pointed out that the Administration had earlier referred to Los Brasiles as a military facility, while later acknowledging it to be a civilian field primarily used by crop-dusters, as the field was listed at the time by Department of Defense documentation.

According to a Federal grand jury&#x27;s indictment, Vaughan was an aide to Tomas Borge, Nicaraguan Minister of the Interior. This allegation was challenged by multiple reporters and congressional inquiries following the subsequent leaking of the story. Kwinty&#x27;s reported that Vaughn had worked in the interior ministry as the deputy manager of a state-run import-export business, and not as aide to Borge. In 1988, the Chair of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, William J Hughes, released further information regarding Vaughn. The subcommittee affirmed that Escobar and his associates were operating from Nicaragua, but also cast doubt regarding Vaughn&#x27;s ties. Hughes stated that subcommittee staff had called Vaughn&#x27;s number, only to discover that the Managua residence had been rented since 1981 by a recently expelled member of the US embassy staff. Hughes also raised several references to a &quot;Freddy Vaughn&quot;, particularly in July 1984, in Oliver North&#x27;s diary, although it was not conclusively established if this referred to the same individual. 

In Managua, Seal met again with Pablo Escobar, who was setting up a cocaine lab for production. After a discussion about how to move the increased flow of cocaine, Escobar decided to keep the first shipment in Nicaragua and have Seal return to the States and buy a larger plane.

The plane Seal acquired was a C-123K, a large aircraft used primarily for military transport. Before returning to Nicaragua, the DEA arranged for CIA technicians to install hidden cameras inside the plane.

Seal returned to the Los Brasiles airfield in Nicaragua on June 25. The pickup went as planned this time, and the cameras successfully photographed Seal and several individuals loading cocaine, aided by Pablo Escobar, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha (another important cartel member), and Federico Vaughan. On his return to the U.S., Seal landed at Homestead Air Force Base and the drugs were transferred into a Winnebago camper, which Seal turned over to his Colombian contact. The Reagan administration would later claim that the men assisting Seal, Gacha and Escobar were Sandinista soldiers, but none of the men were dressed in military uniforms.

The drugs could not be distributed, and the immediate arrest of those handling the vehicle would suggest to the Colombians that Seal had betrayed them, so DEA agents staged an accident with the camper, allowing the driver to escape. Unfortunately, the driver was arrested by local police, and the circumstances of the seizure raised the suspicions of the cartel.

Seal said he made one more trip to Nicaragua on July 7, bringing money to Escobar to pay the Nicaraguans for landing rights. Another shipment was also planned at this time, but under instructions from the DEA, Seal told Escobar his landing site was under DEA surveillance and unsafe for transport to avoid the need to seize a second load. The DEA felt this would be impossible to explain away, and Seal returned to the U.S. without cargo.

The DEA plan was to keep Seal working with the cartel on other parts of the supply chain, such as moving cocaine base into Nicaragua from Colombia and inspecting smuggling airfields in Mexico and the U.S. The ultimate hope was to arrest the cartel leaders in a jurisdiction where it would be easy to extract them.

However, the Nicaragua undercover operation came to an end soon after Seal&#x27;s return from his second trip when it was reported in the press. A leak regarding the operation came to light before Seal&#x27;s second trip. On June 29, General Paul F. Gorman, US Military Commander Southern Command, made a speech stating the US had evidence that elements of the Nicaraguan government were involved in drug smuggling, though Gorman did not mention Seal or the undercover flights. It is not clear whether Seal and his crew were informed of this before they returned to Nicaragua.

A more detailed account of American efforts in Nicaragua appeared on July 17 in an article by reporter Edmond Jacoby, published on the front page of the &quot;Washington Times&quot;. Although not a complete account, it gave enough information to spell an end to Seal&#x27;s work with the cartel, and to the DEA&#x27;s hopes of capturing the cartel leaders outside of Colombia.

=== In the U.S. ===
Following the exposure of the Nicaraguan investigation, the DEA had to move quickly to arrest the cartel distributors in Miami. The DEA had been informed before the publication of the Jacoby article, so they were still able to have Seal set up a meeting with the chief cartel supervisor in Miami, Carlos Bustamonte, and arrested him on July 17, along with other cartel employees.

The evidence acquired from the arrest, plus the evidence gathered by Seal, provided the basis for the first drug trafficking indictment in the U.S. against Escobar and the Ochoas.

Despite the exposure, Seal was able to put together a second major undercover operation for the DEA later that year. This operation involved a long, complicated cocaine shipment from Bolivia, refueling in Colombia, refueling again in Texas, and delivering the cocaine in Las Vegas. The DEA refused to let Seal leave the country due to the danger he was in, so Seal arranged for his ex-brother-in-law William Bottoms to make the flight. The flight, in January 1985, was successful and led to arrests and convictions.

In February, Seal also played a central role in an undercover operation against Norman Saunders, chief minister of the Turks and Caicos Islands, a British colony south of the Bahamas. Saunders was videotaped paying a bribe to Seal in Miami, and was also successfully prosecuted.

=== Continuing legal problems ===
While Seal had come to an agreement with the DEA and the Florida drug task force in March 1984, he was still under active investigation by state and federal authorities in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Little Rock, Arkansas. In October 1984, a grand jury in Louisiana was convened and began interviewing witnesses against Seal. Seal attempted to push back against the investigation by appearing in a television news series broadcast by WBRZ in Baton Rouge in November 1984. The documentary series, titled &quot;Uncle Sam Wants You&quot;, ran on five consecutive evenings. It included an interview where Seal denied he was a smuggler and depicted Seal as harassed by the government. The state narcotics agents who were investigating Seal in Baton Rouge sued over their depiction in the series, but the lawsuit was dismissed.

Soon after the broadcast, the heads of the Florida and Louisiana task forces met to work out an agreement that would allow Seal to continue working with the Florida task force and testify as a witness at trial. They agreed to a sentence for Seal&#x27;s Louisiana activities no greater than the sentence he received for his Florida smuggling, with both sentences to run concurrently.

== Sentencing ==
Seal was taken into federal custody in June 1985 and spent several months testifying in court. He was the primary witness in three trials: the trial of Saunders and the other Turks and Caicos officials in July; the trial of the cartel distributors in Miami in August; the trial of the cartel distributors who had arranged the shipment of cocaine from Bolivia to Las Vegas, also in August. All three trials resulted in convictions for all defendants. Seal also made a public appearance before the President&#x27;s Commission on Organized Crime, recounting his experiences as a drug smuggler.

=== In Florida ===
Following his testimony in the Miami trials, Seal appeared in Florida court again over his second indictment in the Big Screamer operation. Although Seal had pleaded guilty, with the support of his DEA supervisors, he was sentenced to five years of unsupervised probation. Following his testimony in Las Vegas, Seal spent another month in a witness protection center. In October 1985 he returned to court over the first indictment in Big Screamer, for which he had originally been sentenced to ten years. After listening to summaries of Seal&#x27;s successful work for the DEA, Judge Norman Roettger sentenced Seal to time served (a little over three months in witness protection) and three years probation.

=== In Louisiana ===
When Seal received only time served and probation, Louisiana state and federal drug investigators were faced with a dilemma. They had anticipated Seal would serve substantial time in Florida and were now bound by the agreement Florida and Louisiana drug task forces had made in December 1984. The Florida sentence meant no jail time for Seal in Louisiana, yet Seal was pleading guilty to buying 200 kilograms (440 lbs) of cocaine, already more serious than the Florida charges. Also, before the agreement was reached, the Louisiana task force investigation had been looking into Seal&#x27;s involvement in smuggling thousands of kilograms of cocaine.

At Seal&#x27;s sentencing hearing in January 1986, Judge Frank Polozola acknowledged that he was bound by the agreement, but informed Seal and his lawyer of his dissatisfaction with Seal&#x27;s failure to receive jail time in Florida, forcing Polozola to sentence Seal to probation on much more serious charges in Louisiana. He warned Seal that he intended to set strict probation provisions and that if Seal violated these, the plea bargain could be revoked and Seal re-sentenced.
Polozola took the occasion to say that people like Seal were &quot;the lowest, most despicable people I can think of.&quot; In imposing sentence, Polozola further stipulated that Seal could not carry a gun or hire armed bodyguards as this would be possession or constructive possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Seal&#x27;s attorney, Lewis Unglesby, told Polozola his ruling amounted to a death sentence for his client. Seal told friends that the judge &quot;made me a clay pigeon.&quot;

The probation conditions prohibited Seal from leaving Baton Rouge without written permission from Judge Polozola, who ordered Seal to spend every night at a halfway house from 6 pm to 6 am for the first six months of his probation. Seal was assigned to the Salvation Army&#x27;s Community Treatment Center in Baton Rouge.

== Murder ==

=== Background ===
Seal was originally introduced to the Medellín cartel members as a pilot named Ellis McKenzie. Although the newspaper report and the arrest of their Miami distributors confirmed that their pilot was DEA, it was not until the cartel members received a copy of Seal&#x27;s television documentary that they learned McKenzie was Seal. They put out a contract to kidnap or murder Seal.

Max Mermelstein, a high-level cartel distributor in Miami, later testified in court that he was shown the documentary a few days after it was broadcast and was told that the cartel wanted Seal either captured or killed: the price was $500,000 if Seal was killed, and $1,000,000 if he was captured alive. Mermelstein testified that he accepted the contract, believing that a refusal would mean death. He received a phone call from Fabio Ochoa and Escobar, who both thanked him for his help, and was given $100,000 for any costs he incurred. Before Mermelstein had located Seal, however, he was arrested by a federal task force in June 1985. He soon told the task force about the contract, and Seal was informed that the cartel was offering $500,000 for his death.

=== Killing ===
On the evening of February 19, 1986, Seal was shot to death in front of the Salvation Army Center, three weeks into his probation. When Seal drove into the center&#x27;s parking lot and parked, a man got out of a car behind the center&#x27;s donation drop boxes and opened fire with a suppressed MAC-10 submachine gun. Seal was hit six times and died almost instantly.

Six Colombians were arrested in connection with the murder. Three of them, Luis Carlos Quintero-Cruz, Miguel Vélez, and Bernardo Antonio Vásquez, were indicted on state charges for capital murder. A fourth man was indicted separately on lesser charges, and evidence of direct involvement was insufficient for two, who were released and deported.

In addition to the state charges against the killers, federal charges were filed against Fabio Ochoa, Pablo Escobar, and a third cartel member, Rafael Cardona Salazar, for conspiring to violate Seal&#x27;s civil rights by murdering him.

=== Trial ===
Widespread publicity and the general public outcry caused a delay of several months before Seal&#x27;s murder trial began. It proved impossible to impanel sufficient jurors in Baton Rouge, so the venue was moved to Lake Charles. The trial began in April 1987. The most important witnesses were Max Mermelstein and Luis Carlos Uribe-Munera.

Mermelstein, who had told the DEA of the murder contract after his arrest in 1985, testified that Ochoa, Escobar, and Cardona had asked him to take the contract and provided him with money and weapons to do the job. He had seen Cardona test-fire the murder weapon in Mermelstein&#x27;s garage and bullets that matched the murder weapon were later extracted from the garage wall by FBI forensics. Mermelstein also knew the defendant Vélez. He testified that Vélez was present when he was given the contract and that Vélez later asked Mermelstein to turn the contract over to him.

Uribe-Munera was a Colombian drug smuggler for the cartel. He testified that in January 1986, he was ordered by Jorge Ochoa to kill Seal. When Uribe-Munera learned that he would probably be killed afterward, he refused. He was then shot five times by cartel gunmen, but survived and eventually sought asylum at the U.S. embassy in Bogota. Uribe-Munera was brought to the U.S., where he agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine.

There was also extensive eyewitness and forensic evidence against Quintero-Cruz, Vélez, and Vásquez. A witness identified Vélez as the driver of the vehicle in the halfway house parking lot. Another eyewitness saw Quintero-Cruz outside the car, handing the MAC-10 to the car driver through the window after the murder. All three men&#x27;s fingerprints were found in the vehicle. Vasquez was identified as the purchaser of the halfway house vehicle by the car agency salesman and paid for hotel rooms and rental cars using his name. All three were found guilty and sentenced to life without parole.

In January 2023, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards denied Vásquez&#x27;s request for clemency.
== Personal life ==
Seal was married three times. His first marriage, to Barbara Dodson, lasted from 1963 to 1971. The second marriage, to Lynn Ross, lasted from 1971 to 1972. In 1973, he married Deborah DuBois. The marriage ended with his death in 1986. Seal had six children; two from his first wife, one from a relationship he had in between marriages, and three more with Deborah.

=== Controversies ===

==== Exposure of Nicaraguan undercover operation ====
In 1988, the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing that looked into how Seal&#x27;s 1984 trip to Nicaragua was leaked to the press. Questioned about the identity of the source, DEA agent Ernst Jacobson replied, &quot;I heard that the leak came from an aide in the White House&quot;. He stated that Iran–Contra figure Oliver North had attended two meetings about the sting operation and had the motivation to release the information. UPI reported: &quot;By linking the Sandinistas with drug traffic ... aid to the rebels accused of human rights violations might seem more palatable&quot;.

Subcommittee chairman William J. Hughes strongly suggested that North was the source of the leak, but Representative Bill McCollum said, &quot;...we don&#x27;t know who leaked this. No one has been able to tell us&quot;. Citing testimony of DEA Administrator John C. Lawn, the report of the Kerry Committee released in December 1988 pinned the leak on North stating he &quot;decided to play politics with the issue&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Frontline&quot;, North said he was told by his superiors on the National Security Council to brief Senator Paula Hawkins about the operation, but he denied leaking the report. Hawkins told &quot;Frontline&quot; that neither she nor her staff leaked the information after the briefing. Jacoby later denied that North was the source of his story and attributed it to a deceased staff member for Representative Dan Daniel.

==== Criticism of U.S. failure to protect Seal ====
Louisiana Attorney General William Guste wrote to United States Attorney General Edwin Meese criticizing the government&#x27;s failure to protect Seal as a witness. At Guste&#x27;s request, Meese launched an investigation to determine whether or not attorneys in Louisiana, Miami, and Washington had mishandled the case, and to determine whether or not Seal should have been forced into protective custody. Government attorneys stated that Seal placed himself in danger by refusing to move his family and enter a witness protection program.

==== Alleged CIA ties ====
Some accounts like that of Alexander Cockburn suggested that Barry Seal&#x27;s connections with the CIA might date back to the 1960s when he was allegedly a special forces helicopter pilot in Vietnam or even to the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961. Seal was reportedly involved in CIA-sponsored activities in Central America during the 1980s. This included transporting weapons to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, who were fighting against the Nicaraguan government and smuggling drugs. Seal&#x27;s connections to the CIA are controversial. The CIA denied having employed Seal and he denied ever having been a CIA asset.

=== Media depictions ===

<text>Alexander Porfyrovych Archipenko (February 25, 1964) was a Ukrainian-American avant-garde artist, sculptor, and graphic artist, active in France and the United States. He was one of the first to apply the principles of Cubism to architecture, analyzing human figures into geometrical forms.

==Biography==
Alexander Archipenko was born in Kyiv (Russian Empire, now Ukraine) in 1887, to Porfiry Antonowych Archipenko and Poroskowia Vassylivna Machowa Archipenko; he was the younger brother of Eugene Archipenko.

From 1902 to 1905 he attended the Kyiv Art School (KKhU). In 1906 he continued his education in the arts at Serhiy Svetoslavsky (Kyiv), and later that year had an exhibition there with Alexander Bogomazov. He then moved to Moscow where he had a chance to exhibit his work in some group shows.

Archipenko moved to Paris in 1908 and quickly enrolled in the École des Beaux-Arts, which he left after a few weeks. He was a resident in the artist&#x27;s colony La Ruche, among émigré Ukrainian artists: Wladimir Baranoff-Rossine, Sonia Delaunay-Terk, and Nathan Altman. After 1910 he had exhibitions at &quot;Salon des Indépendants&quot;, &quot;Salon d&#x27;Automne&quot; together with Aleksandra Ekster, Kazimir Malevich, Vadym Meller, Sonia Delaunay-Terk, Georges Braque, André Derain, and others.

In 1912, Archipenko had his first personal exhibition at the Museum Folkwang at Hagen in Germany, and from 1912 to 1914 he was teaching at his own Art School in Paris.

Four of Archipenko&#x27;s Cubist sculptures, including &quot;Family Life&quot; and five of his drawings, appeared in the controversial &quot;Armory Show&quot; in 1913 in New York City. These works were caricatured in the New York World.

Archipenko moved to Nice in 1914. In 1920 he participated in &quot;Twelfth Biennale Internazionale dell&#x27;Arte di Venezia&quot; in Italy and started his own Art school in Berlin the following year. In 1922 Archipenko participated in the &quot;First Russian Art Exhibition&quot; in the Gallery van Diemen in Berlin together with Aleksandra Ekster, Kazimir Malevich, Solomon Nikritin, El Lissitzky, and others.

In 1923, he emigrated to the United States. He became a U.S. citizen in 1929. In 1933 he exhibited at the Ukrainian pavilion in Chicago as part of the Century of Progress World&#x27;s Fair. Archipenko contributed the most to the success of the Ukrainian pavilion. His works occupied one room and were valued at $25,000.

In 1936 Archipenko participated in an exhibition &quot;Cubism and Abstract Art&quot; in New York as well as numerous exhibitions across Europe and other places in the U.S. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1962.

Alexander Archipenko died on February 25, 1964, in New York City. He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

== Contribution to art ==
Archipenko, along with the French-Hungarian sculptor Joseph Csaky, exhibited at the first public manifestations of Cubism in Paris; the Salon des Indépendants and Salon d&#x27;Automne, 1910 and 1911, being the first, after Pablo Picasso, to employ the Cubist style in three dimensions. Archipenko departed from the neo-classical sculpture of his time, using faceted planes and negative space to create a new way of looking at the human figure, showing a number of views of the subject simultaneously. He is known for having introducied sculptural voids, and for his inventive mixing of genres throughout his career: devising &#x27;sculpto-paintings&#x27;, and later experimenting with materials such as clear acrylic and terra cotta. Inspired by the works of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, he is also credited for introducing the collage to wider audiences with his &quot;Medrano&quot; series.

The sculptor Ann Weaver Norton apprenticed with Archipenko for a number of years.

Archipenko&#x27;s tall cubist statue of King Solomon is installed at the University of Pennsylvania campus. Archipenko began work on a smaller prototype of the statue in 1964, but died before the work was finished, leaving his wife to oversee its completion. The full-sized statue was completed in 1968 and was donated to the university in 1985.

==Commemoration and Legacy==
During his lifetime Arkhipenko maintained close ties with the Ukrainian community in the USA, participating in the creation of monuments to Shevchenko, Frank and Prince Volodymyr on American soil.

A street in the Obolonskyi District of Kyiv and a street in the Sofiivka area of Lviv are named in his honour.

On May 30, 2017, Ukraine celebrated the 130 years since the birth of Oleksandr Arkhipenko.

On November 9, 2017, the National Bank of Ukraine circulated a 2-hryvnia commemorative coin dedicated to the artist. His portrait is depicted on the reverse of the coin.

<text>Traianos Dellas (; born 31 January 1976) is a Greek professional football manager and former player. He last managed Super League club OFI. 

He was an integral part of Greece&#x27;s Euro 2004 winning squad, during which he became the only player to score a silver goal in an international football match.

==Club career==

Dellas started playing football professionally in 1993 at Aris for two years, where he helped the Thessaloniki side qualify for the 1994–95 UEFA Cup. He played alongside Fanis Katergiannakis, who was also part of the Greek squad at Euro 2004.

In the summer of 1994, Dellas was loaned to Panserraikos for two seasons, where he quickly became a regular.

Dellas came back to Aris before leaving for England to join Sheffield United. He was best remembered by fans at Bramall Lane for a game against Tranmere Rovers in March 1999. With the Blades 2–0 down, Dellas came on as a substitute and scored twice as they won 3–2. His other goal came from an impressive 30-yard strike in a home game against Portsmouth, another late winner.

In 1999, Dellas returned to his native Greece to play for AEK Athens through a recommendation by Vasilis Dimitriadis. He won the Greek Cup in 2000, playing alongside the likes of Demis Nikolaidis and Vasilios Tsiartas. Dellas had a fairly good presence for two years in the team, but a fall-out in 2001 with then-club president Makis Psomiadis and head coach Fernando Santos led to his release.

After the departure from AEK, Dellas signed for the Italian club, Perugia. However, Dellas was dropped from Perugia&#x27;s first team after a disagreement over his contract and he did not make a single appearance in the last six months of the season, playing only eight matches overall.

After leaving the club Dellas caught the attention of Serie A club Roma and he joined the team on a free transfer in 2002.
After finally establishing himself as a starter following the move of coach Fabio Capello to Juventus, Dellas&#x27;s performances were outstanding. He earned the peculiar honour of being one of three players alongside Francesco Totti and Vincenzo Montella who were not consistently booed by the fans during training and games during Roma&#x27;s disastrous 2004–05 season. After failing to renew his contract with the club, Dellas became a free agent. He would eventually miss nearly 8 months of football due to back and hernia injuries and thus, expected offers from the big clubs of Europe failed to materialize.

In the summer of 2005 Dellas decided to return to AEK, where his former teammate and good friend Demis Nikolaidis was the president. He renewed his contract in June 2007 for a further two years and became team captain. Here Dellas played alongside players like Rivaldo, Pantelis Kafes and the talented Sokratis Papastathopoulos. In AEK came very close of winning the league, but the opportunity was lost due to the &quot;Valner affair&quot; and the title went to Olympiacos. On 23 July 2008, Dellas and AEK agreed to terminate his contract by mutual consent after failing to agree on a new contract.

On 24 July 2008 agreed to sign a two-year deal with Cypriot football club Anorthosis Famagusta. Dellas helped the team to qualify for the UEFA Champions League in the season 2008–09, in the same group with his rival club when he was at AEK, Panathinaikos and Inter Milan of José Mourinho.

On 5 June 2010, Dellas agreed to sign with AEK Athens again, this time for one year, possibly intending to end his career at the team he supports. Nikos Liberopoulos also returned at the club and alongside Dellas formed their leading duo. On 12 December 2010, Dellas scored his first goal in the Greek championship after two years&#x27; absence, against AEL. On 16 March 2011 he scored in the semi-final of the cup against PAOK and sent AEK to the final of the tournament. On 30 April 2011, Dellas won with AEK his second Cup. He played at AEK for one more season when on 26 May 2012, Dellas announced his retirement from professional football.

==International career==

Dellas earned his first cap for Greece in April 2001 in a 2–2 draw with Croatia. Dellas had an exceptional tournament at Euro 2004, partnering again with his former teammate at AEK, Michalis Kapsis in the centre of what became an almost impenetrable Greek defence, leading to him being voted onto the tournament all-star squad. During the semi-finals, he scored the only silver goal ever in the last minute of first half of extra time against the Czech Republic, allowing Greece to progress to the final. This was his only goal for the Greek squad. The coach of Greece called him &#x27;the Colossus of Rhodes&#x27; in respect of his performances in the tournament and the moniker is now widely used in the press.

After Euro 2004, Dellas continued to be the heart of the Greek defense, but missed nearly eight months in 2005 due to injury. His absence was seen as a major factor in Greece&#x27;s failed 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign. Two years later, Dellas helped Greece qualify for Euro 2008 but could not find his form of 2004 as Greece exited the group stage without any points and having scored just one goal. He was also part of the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign but was not called up after the victory over Israel on 1 April 2009. Subsequently, he was not included in the provisional squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

==Managerial career==
On 4 April 2013, Dellas was appointed as AEK Athens&#x27;s new coach, replacing Ewald Lienen, with Akis Zikos being appointed as assistant manager. Following AEK&#x27;s relegation from the Super League, Dellas remained at the club&#x27;s wheel in Greece&#x27;s third division, instead of the second tier in order to clear the team&#x27;s debts. He successfully led the team back in the Super League in 2015. On 20 October 2015, Dellas resigned, after a 4–0 loss to Olympiacos.

On 7 November 2015, he signed a contract with club Atromitos. On 12 January 2018, he signed a contract with Panetolikos. He resigned on 19 April 2019. On 10 November 2020, Panetolikos announced his return as the manager of the club in a need of gaining points for avoiding relegation. His second tenure ended officially on 5 June 2021, after the club thanking him for having successfully avoided relegation for the club, which was achieved thanks to an away goal in a (2–1) defeat, and a late goal victory at home (1–0) in the 2nd leg of the relegation play-offs.

==Personal life==
Dellas married Greek model Gogo Mastrokosta on 11 September 2008. They have one daughter.

<text>Fuzzy dice, also known as fluffy dice, soft dice, or stuffed dice, are an automotive decoration consisting of two oversized (usually six-sided) plush dice which hang from the rear-view mirror. The original fuzzy dice, first used in the 1950s, were white and approximately across. Nowadays, fuzzy dice come in many colors and various sizes. In Britain and other parts of the world it is considered kitsch to display such items in a car.

==Origin and history==
The use of fuzzy dice is believed to be traced back to American fighter pilots during World War II. Pilots would hang the dice above their instruments displaying seven pips before a &#x27;sortie&#x27; mission for good luck. It is also speculated that the dice represented a high degree of risk associated with the fighter sorties; hundreds of pilots were shot down each week. Upon returning after the war, many airmen continued the tradition.

In the 1950s, the fuzzy dice became one of the first items sold specifically to be hung from a rear-view mirror. The &quot;Encyclopedia of American Social History&quot; notes that during the 1950s, young adults were drawn to cars that were &quot;customized for speed, painted with vivid colors, stripes, and flames, tuck-and-roll interiors, fuzzy dice suspended from the mirror, rock-and-roll on the radio...&quot;.

Another explanation for hanging these in a car has been proposed that &quot;displaying the dice meant the driver was ready and willing to be &#x27;dicing with death&#x27; in the dangerous and unregulated world of street racing&quot;.

In some segments, such as the lowrider community, research indicated that even the most dedicated individuals &quot;did not attach any significance to the dice&quot; that were hung from their car&#x27;s rearview mirror. 

A 1993 study found no correlation between the use of fuzzy dice and the degree of a driver&#x27;s reckless driving behavior. 

In some jurisdictions, suspending objects from rear-view mirrors is illegal.

A technology upgrade to the product includes illuminated LED plastic dice that change colors.

<text>Sir Charles Noble Arden-Clarke (25 July 1898 – 16 December 1962) was a British colonial administrator.

== Biography ==
Arden-Clarke was educated at Rossall School. He was the Resident Commissioner of the Bechuanaland Protectorate (later Botswana) between 1937 and 1942, a time at which the ruling regent Tshekedi Khama was in violent conflict with the British authorities. He was the Resident Commissioner of Basutoland from August 1942 to November 1946, and in 1946 was appointed as the first Governor of the newly created British Crown Colony of Sarawak, which was ceded in 1946 by the Kingdom of Sarawak. During his governorship in Sarawak he was despised by locals as, upon his appointment, Sarawak was engulfed with the Anti-cession Movement, which led to the assassination of his successor, Duncan Stewart in 1949 by the radical members of the Anti-cession movement. 

On 1 May 1948, he assumed the position of High Commissioner to Brunei. Documents were neither signed nor exchanged between Arden-Clarke and Anthony Abell, only the reading of the appointment for him was made in front of Brunei dignitaries in the State Court House. He promised the people of Brunei that it was his duty and responsibility to protect the interests and welfare of Brunei and its inhabitants and to contribute to its future development and progress. He was replaced by C.W. Dawson in October 1949.

After Sarawak, he was the last governor of the Gold Coast (later Ghana), from August 1949 until 1957, taking up residence in Fort Christiansborg. On 12 February 1951, he authorised Kwame Nkrumah&#x27;s release from imprisonment in James Fort. After independence, he was named the first Governor-General of Ghana in 1957. Arden-Clarke&#x27;s acceptance of the Africans and his attitude towards Kwame Nkrumah likely contributed to Ghana&#x27;s relatively smooth transition to independence.

<text>Île Amsterdam (), also known as Amsterdam Island and New Amsterdam (&quot;Nouvelle-Amsterdam&quot;), is an island of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands in the southern Indian Ocean that together with neighbouring Île Saint-Paul to the south forms one of the five districts of the territory.

The island is roughly equidistant to the land masses of Madagascar, Australia, and Antarctica – as well as the British Indian Ocean Territory and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands (about from each). It is the northernmost volcanic island within the Antarctic Plate.

The research station at Martin-de-Viviès, first called &quot;Camp Heurtin&quot; and then &quot;La Roche Godon&quot;, is the only settlement on the island and is the seasonal home to about thirty researchers and staff studying biology, meteorology, and geomagnetics.

==History==

The first person known to have sighted the island was the Spanish explorer Juan Sebastián Elcano, on 18 March 1522, during his circumnavigation of the world. Elcano called it Desesperanza (Despair), because he couldn&#x27;t find a safe place to land and his crew was desperate for water after 40 days of sailing from Timor. On 17 June 1633, Dutch colonial governor and mariner Anthonie van Diemen sighted the island, and named it after his ship, &quot;Nieuw Amsterdam&quot;. The first recorded landing on the island occurred in December 1696, led by the Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh.

French mariner Pierre François Péron wrote that he was marooned on the island between 1792 and 1795. Péron&#x27;s &quot;Memoires&quot;, in which he describes his experiences, were published in a limited edition, now an expensive collectors&#x27; item. However, Île Amsterdam and Île Saint-Paul were often confused at the time, and Péron may have been marooned on Saint-Paul.

Amsterdam and St. Paul islands were recommended in 1786 for a convict settlement by Alexander Dalrymple, the Examiner of Sea-Journals for the East India Company, when the British government was considering New South Wales and Norfolk Island for such a settlement. An investigation of those islands was subsequently undertaken in December 1792 and January 1793 by George Lord Macartney, Britain&#x27;s first ambassador to China, during his voyage to that country, who established that they were not suitable for settlement.

Sealers are said to have landed on the island, for the first time, in 1789. Between that date and 1876, 47 sealing vessels are recorded at the island, 9 of which were wrecked. Relics of the sealing era can still be found.

The island was a stop on the British Macartney Embassy on its voyage to China in 1793.

On 11 October 1833, the British barque &quot;Lady Munro&quot; was wrecked at the island. Of the 97 persons aboard, 21 survivors were picked up two weeks later by a US sealing schooner, &quot;General Jackson&quot;.

John Balleny in command of the exploration and sealing vessel &quot;Eliza Scott&quot; (154 tons) visited the island in November 1838 in search of seals. He returned with a few fish and reported having seen the remains of a hut and the carcass of a whale.

The islands of Île Amsterdam and Île Saint-Paul were first claimed by France in June 1843. A decree of 8 June 1843 mandated the Polish captain Adam Mieroslawski to take into possession and administer in the name of France both islands. The decree as well as the ship&#x27;s log from the &quot;Olympe&quot; ship from 1 and 3 July 1843, stating that the islands had been taken into possession by Mieroslawski, are still preserved.

However, the French government renounced its possession of the islands in 1853.

In January 1871 an attempt to settle the island was made by a party led by Heurtin, a French resident of Réunion. After seven months, their attempts to raise cattle and grow crops were fruitless, and they returned to Réunion, abandoning the cattle on the island.

In May 1880 circumnavigated the island searching for a missing ship the &quot;Knowsley Hall&quot;. A cutter and gig were despatched to the island to search for signs of habitation. There was a flagpole on Hoskin Point and north were two huts, one of which had an intact roof and contained three bunks, empty casks, an iron pot and the eggshells and feathers of sea-birds. There was also an upturned serviceable boat in the other hut, believed to belong to the fishermen who visited the island.

In 1892, the crew of the French sloop &quot;Bourdonnais&quot;, followed by the ship &quot;L&#x27;Eure&quot; in 1893, again took possession of Saint-Paul and Amsterdam Island in the name of the French government.

The island was attached to the French colony of Madagascar from 21 November 1924 until 6 August 1955 when the French Southern and Antarctic Lands was formed. (Madagascar gained independence in 1958.)

The first French base on Île Amsterdam was established in 1949, and was originally called Camp Heurtin. It is now the Martin-de-Viviès research station, named after Paul de Martin de Viviès who, with twenty-three others, spent the winter of 1949 on the island. The station was originally named Camp Heurtin and has been in operation since 1 January 1981, superseding the first station, La Roche Godon.

The Global Atmosphere Watch still maintains a presence on Île Amsterdam.

On 15 January 2025, a wildfire broke out in the island, forcing the evacuation of all 31 residents by boat to Réunion. Due to the island&#x27;s remote location, the fire spread unchecked. By 10 February, 45% of the island&#x27;s area had been affected, while water supply and telecommunications infrastructure at the Martin-de-Viviès research station was damaged.

==Amateur radio==
From 1987 to 1998, there were frequent amateur radio operations from Amsterdam Island. There was a resident radio amateur operator in the 1950s, using callsign FB8ZZ.

In January 2014 Clublog listed Amsterdam and St Paul Islands as the seventh most-wanted DXCC entity. On 25 January 2014 a DX-pedition landed on Amsterdam Island using MV &quot;Braveheart&quot; and began amateur radio operations from two separate locations using callsign FT5ZM. The DX-pedition remained active until 12 February and achieved over 170,000 two-way contacts with amateur radio stations worldwide.

==Environment==
===Geography===
The island is a potentially active volcano. It has an area of , measuring about on its longest side, and reaches as high as at the Mont de la Dives. The high central area of the island, at an elevation of over , containing its peaks and caldera, is known as the Plateau des Tourbières (&quot;Plateau of Bogs&quot;). The cliffs that characterise the western coastline of the island, rising to over , are known as the Falaises d&#x27;Entrecasteaux after the 18th-century French navigator Antoine Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux.

==== Geology ====

No historical eruptions are known, although the fresh morphology of the latest volcanism at Dumas Craters on the NE flank suggests it may have occurred as recently as the late 19th century. All the rocks are tholeiitic basalt and the oldest basalt sampled is no more than 720,000 years old.

There are two stratovolcanoes being Mont De La Dives which dominates and is younger and Le Mount du Fernand. Vents manifest as either cones or craters include Cratere Antonelli, Le Brulot, Le Chaudron, Le Cyclope, Crateres Dumas, Le Forneau, Cratere Inferieur, Grande Marmite, Cratere Hebert, Museau De Tanche, Cratere de l&#x27;Olympe, Cratere Superieur, Crateres Venus, and Cratere Vulcain (see map on this page).

The island is located on the mainly undersea Amsterdam–Saint Paul Plateau which is of volcanic hotspot origin. There is a magma chamber located at between depth below Amsterdam Island. The plateau which extends north west towards the Nieuw Amsterdam Fracture Zone (Amsterdam Fracture Zone) and south to beyond the island of St Paul with its presently known active area being delimited by the St. Paul Fracture Zone, is a feature of the sea floor near the Southeast Indian Ridge, which is an active spreading center between the Antarctic plate that the island lies on, and the Australian Plate. Helium isotopic compositional studies are consistent with its formation from the combined effects of accretion at the mid-ocean ridge ridge and mantle plume activity of a hot spot. This is either the Kerguelen hotspot or a potentially separate Amsterdam-Saint Paul hotspot but resolution of this issue is complicated by the recent volcanism on the island due to it being adjacent to the Southeast Indian Ridge. Recent authors have favoured a separate Amsterdam and St. Paul hotspot. There has been evidence at Boomerang Seamount to the north east of the island that Kerguelen-type source mantle exists beneath the Amsterdam and St. Paul Plateau. Which ever hot spot is responsible is moving south as Île Amsterdam rocks are older than St. Paul rocks. The Amsterdam–St. Paul Plateau while formed in the last 10 million years, started this formation beneath the Australian Plate so the island is built on the components of two tectonic plates.

===Climate===
Île Amsterdam has a mild, oceanic climate, &quot;Cfb&quot; under the Köppen climate classification, with a mean annual temperature of , annual rainfall of , persistent westerly winds and high levels of humidity. Under the Trewartha climate classification the island is well inside the maritime subtropical zone due to its very low diurnal temperature variation keeping means high.

===Flora and fauna===

====Vegetation====
&quot;Phylica arborea&quot; trees occur on Amsterdam, which is the only place where they form a low forest, although the trees are also found on Tristan da Cunha and Gough Island. It was called the &quot;Grand Bois&quot; (&quot;Great Forest&quot;), which covered the lowlands of the island until forest fires set by sealers cleared much of it in 1825. Only eight fragments remain. Sailors from HMS &quot;Raleigh&quot;, who visited the island on 27 May 1880, described the vegetation as:

&quot;Rough ground, grass several feet high, myrtle high in sheltered ravines, sedge, ferns (principally &quot;polypodium&quot;) and cabbages, grown into bushes with stumps several inches thick in the garden...&quot;

====Birds====

The island is home to the endemic Amsterdam albatross, which breeds only on the Plateau des Tourbières. Other rare species are the brown skua, Antarctic tern and western rockhopper penguin. The Amsterdam duck is now extinct, as are the local breeding populations of several petrels. There was once possibly a species of rail inhabiting the island, as a specimen was taken in the 1790s (which has been lost), but this was either extinct by 1800 or was a straggler of an extant species. The common waxbill has been introduced. Both the Plateau des Tourbières and Falaises d&#x27;Entrecasteaux have been identified as Important Bird Areas by BirdLife International, the latter for its large breeding colony of Indian yellow-nosed albatrosses.

====Mammals====
There are no native land mammals. Subantarctic fur seals and southern elephant seals breed on the island. Introduced mammals include the house mouse, brown rat and feral cats. An eradication campaign of these invasive species was started in 2023, which plans to eradicate all cats and rats from the island by late 2024.

A distinct breed of wild cattle, Amsterdam Island cattle, also inhabited the island from 1871 to 2010. They originated from the introduction of five animals by Heurtin during his brief attempt at settlement of the island in 1871 and by 1988 had increased to an estimated 2,000. Following recognition that the cattle were damaging the island ecosystems, a fence was built restricting them to the northern part of the island. In 2007 it was decided to eradicate the population of cattle entirely, resulting in the slaughter of the cattle between 2008 and 2010.

<text>Lawrence Park is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is bordered by Yonge Street to the west and Bayview Avenue to the east, and from Blythwood Ravine on the south to Lawrence Avenue on the north. Lawrence Park was one of Toronto&#x27;s first planned garden suburbs. Begun in the early part of the 20th century, it did not fully develop until after the Second World War. It was ranked the wealthiest neighbourhood in all of Canada in 2011.

Centred on Mount Pleasant Road, the neighbourhood grew slowly with medium-sized houses on narrow but deep lots. There are few commercial businesses within walking distance. The closest grocery stores are close to Yonge and Lawrence.

In its early years, the neighbourhood&#x27;s transportation was served predominantly by the northern section of the Toronto Transportation Commission&#x27;s Yonge streetcar line. When the Yonge subway opened to Eglinton in 1954, the TTC replaced this service with trolley buses on Yonge Street and Mount Pleasant Road, both terminating at the Eglinton station. The trolleys left Yonge when the subway was extended further north in 1973, although a less frequent local bus service remained; the trolleys on Mount Pleasant lasted until 1991, when they too were replaced with regular buses.

Demographically, the neighbourhood still retains a largely Anglo-Protestant population.

==History==

The assembly of Lawrence Park began in 1907 by the Dovercourt Land Building and Saving Company, which acquired the north parcel of the park from John Lawrence, after whom this neighborhood is named. The president of the Dovercourt Land Company was Wilfred Servington Dinnick. It was under Dinnick&#x27;s direction that Lawrence Park was developed as a suburb for the &quot;well do&quot;.

In the early years Howard and Lorrie Dunington-Grubb, who later founded Sheridan Nurseries, undertook much of the landscape architecture for the boulevards and parks of the suburb. They also took commissions for garden design from the owners of the new homes.

The first advertisement for Lawrence Park trumpeted it as an &quot;&quot;aristocratic neighborhood&quot;, &quot;four hundred feet above Lake Ontario, and Far from the Lake Winds in Winter&quot;. However, Lawrence Park&#x27;s development was sporadic. The building of houses was interrupted by two world wars, a recession, and a depression, and the neighborhood was completed only in the 1950s.

The area west of Mildenhall Road, following the north-south path of Braeside Road beyond Rothmere Drive, was part of the Toronto-North York boundary until 1998.

==Character==
Lawrence Park is one of Toronto&#x27;s most exclusive residential neighborhoods. In 2011, &quot;Canadian Business&quot; magazine named it the wealthiest postal code in Canada by household net worth, averaged at $3.88 million. The Blythwood cluster of the neighborhood, along Bayview Avenue, has an average household income of $622,238, while the West side centered around Mount Pleasant Road has an average household income of $469,448.

The neighborhood is located in a setting that includes gently rolling hills, several parks, and a ravine. Lawrence Park&#x27;s shops, schools and recreational facilities are located on its periphery. Many of the residents belong to The Granite Club, a sports and recreation centre on Bayview Avenue north of Lawrence Avenue. The majority of residents in this neighborhood own several properties across Ontario, which include winter chalets in Collingwood and summer cottages in Muskoka, particularly on the prestigious lakes of Rosseau, Muskoka and Joseph.

The shops and restaurants in the Yonge and Lawrence area, are well patronized by Lawrence Park residents. This shopping district includes some fashion stores, a plethora of nail salons, barber shops, hair salons, 2 Dollaramas, bakeries, gourmet dining, casual restaurants and coffee shops.

Notable institutions located in or adjacent to Lawrence Park are the Rosedale Golf Club, and The Granite Club.

===Homes===
Lawrence Park&#x27;s houses include a variety of architectural styles including English Cottage, Tudor Revival, Georgian and Colonial style designs. Most of these homes were built between 1910 and the late 1940s. For the last few years parts of Lawrence Park have been redeveloped with larger houses which do not match the scale of the original housing in the neighborhood.

In the first part of 2011, the average resale house price in the neighborhood was $2,421,036, higher than any Toronto neighborhood other than the Bridle Path.

The Lawrence Park Ratepayers Association (LPRA) has been active for several decades. Its mandate is to promote all matters regarding the welfare of Lawrence Park and its preservation as a residential park. The LPRA serves the residents of the portion of Lawrence Park that falls within the old City of Toronto - an area bounded by Lawrence Avenue East, Yonge Street, Blythwood Road and St. Ives. Its annual newsletter and website provide information about activities and issues in the neighbourhood.

<text>The River Quaggy (often the Quaggy River or simply Quaggy) is a river, in length, passing through the south-east London boroughs of Bromley, Greenwich and Lewisham. In its lower reaches it is an urban river, in its upper reaches further from London it is more natural and known as the Kyd Brook. The river rises from two sources near Princess Royal University Hospital (PRUH) at Locksbottom and is a tributary of the River Ravensbourne which it flows into near Lewisham station in Lewisham.

A long stretch of Kyd Brook is visible in Hawkwood, an area of open farmland and countryside upstream of Chislehurst that is owned and managed by the National Trust, but open to the public free of charge. From there the river flows northwards through Sundridge Park Golf Course then on across &quot;Chinbrook Meadows&quot; between Chinbrook and Grove Park, then through the outer parts of Mottingham, Middle Park, Horn Park, and Eltham. The river then enters Sutcliffe Park and starts to flow west through southern Kidbrooke, and Blackheath then finally through Lee and its park Manor House Gardens into Hither Green then Lewisham where it joins the River Ravensbourne next to Lewisham station. In Sutcliffe Park, the river used to run under the road and via a covered culvert through the park. This was remodelled several years ago to reintroduce a flood area to protect areas further down stream. Also this created a marshy area for wildlife to return. It is now an oasis full of wildlife in the middle of two major roads.

As part of the Ravensbourne catchment area, the river is kept constantly under inspection by the Environment Agency which issues flood warnings when applicable.

==River engineering==
In the 1960s the River Quaggy within Chinbrook Meadows, Sutcliffe Park, and other parks was channelized into long straight concrete culverts to alleviate flooding. In Chinbrook Meadows the channelized river was closed off behind tall hedges and iron fences; this cut the park in two with the larger part to the east of the river. In the early part of the current century the concrete channel with its fences and hedges was demolished and river was remodelled to give a natural, meandering appearance with a small flood plain; this was to encourage wild plants and animals back to the area and to be more pleasant and attractive for the public. There are several wooden foot bridges over the river replacing the concrete ones and their iron fences. The regeneration was completed on 1 October 2002 and cost a reported £1.1million. Since the restoration Chinbrook Meadows has won the Green Flag Award two years in a row. Shortly after the regeneration was completed the Quaggy was given a similar regeneration further downstream within Sutcliffe Park, a mile and a half to the north.

==Name==
The name has existed for quite a long while; references to it can be found in numerous works of British fiction in the 19th and 20th centuries, for example in Edith Nesbit&#x27;s &quot;The New Treasure Seekers&quot;. The name probably originated from the words quagmire and .

===Other names===
The river has been known by other names. Today Kyd Brook usually refers to the river in its upper reaches in Chislehurst and Farnborough. The place Kidbrooke took its name from the river but is on its lower reaches, where there are two tributaries called Middle Kid Brook and Lower Kid Brook. The place name Chinbrook is derived from &quot;Chin Brook&quot; which was another alternative name for the Quaggy River in that area at the beginning of the twentieth century.

==Tributaries==
The River Quaggy itself is a tributary of the River Ravensbourne which in turn flows into the River Thames. The Quaggy also has several small and named tributaries of its own. From source to mouth they are:

*Main Branch ()
*East Branch () - the two branches rise in Locksbottom, flow north and join together at Petts Wood.
*Petts Wood Ditch (), rises is southern Chislehurst, flows southward through the woodland of Petts Wood joining the Kyd Brook in northern Petts Wood.
*Milk Street Ditch (), rises near and is named after Milk Street in Sundridge, then flows east and joins the Quaggy in Sundridge Park Golf Course.
*Border Ditch (), rises in southern Grove Park, flows mostly eastward, joining the Quaggy in southern Chinbrook Meadows. 
*Grove Park Ditch (), rises in Lower Marvels Wood, Mottingham, flows west and joins the Quaggy in a sports ground just north of Chinbrook Meadows.
*Little Quaggy (), rises in Chislehurst, flows north through Coldharbour and Mottingham, through the lake of The Tarn then flows west and joins the Quaggy near Horn Park.
**Fairy Hall Flow () intermittent stream, when it flows, it rises in Elmstead, flows north through Mottingham, and joins the Little Quaggy near Horn Park
*Well Hall Stream (), rises in Shooters Hill, flows west through Well Hall then joins the Quaggy in Sutcliffe Park.
*Lower Kid Brooke (), rises in Well Hall, Eltham and flows southeast splitting into two distributaries before and joining the Quaggy in southern Blackheath.
*Middle Kid Brooke (), rises in Kidbrooke and flows southwest splitting into two distributaries before joining the Quaggy in Lee.
*Upper Kid Brooke (), rises in Kidbrooke and flows west before joining the Quaggy in Lewisham. These tributaries give their name to the place Kidbrooke.
*Quaggy Hither Green (), rises in Hither Green and flows north joining the Quaggy north of Hither Green railway station.

Another fairly substantial tributary and also so named, runs west, southwest from its source at Shooters Hill amalgamating with the main body in Kidbrooke.

<text>Bog iron is a form of impure iron deposit that develops in bogs or swamps by the chemical or biochemical oxidation of iron carried in solution. In general, bog ores consist primarily of iron oxyhydroxides, commonly goethite (FeO(OH)).

Iron-bearing groundwater typically emerges as a spring and the iron in it forms ferric hydroxide upon encountering the oxidizing environment of the surface. Bog ore often combines goethite and magnetite, and may include vugs and stained quartz. Oxidation may occur through enzyme catalysis by iron bacteria. It is not clear whether the magnetite precipitates upon the first contact with oxygen, then oxidizes to ferric compounds, or whether the ferric compounds are reduced when exposed to anoxic conditions upon burial beneath the sediment surface and reoxidized upon exhumation at the surface.

Bog iron, like other hydrous iron oxides, has a specific affinity for heavy metals. This affinity combined with the porous structure and high specific surface area of bog iron make it a good natural sorbent. These properties combined with the fact that bog iron is cheap to obtain are incentives for its utilization in environmental protection technologies.
Iron made from bog ore will often contain residual silicates, which can form a glassy coating that imparts some resistance to rusting.

== Formation ==
Iron is carried to bogs in low-pH, low-dissolved oxygen iron-bearing groundwater that reaches the surface through springs, along with structures of fractures, or where groundwater intersects surface flows. The iron in the water is then oxidized by dissolved oxygen or, through enzyme catalysis by iron bacteria (e.g., &quot;Thiobacillus ferrooxidans&quot; and &quot;Thiobacillus thiooxidans&quot;) that concentrate the iron as part of their life processes. Presence of these bacteria can be detected by the oily film they leave on the surface of the water. This change of oxidation state causes the precipitation of fine-grained iron solids near the point of groundwater discharge. A variety of iron minerals, such as goethite, magnetite, hematite, schwertmannite, and amorphous iron-aluminum-sulfate-rich solids, can be formed via oxidation of ferrous iron under the acidic conditions present. All photosynthesizers play dual roles as oxygen producers, and thus passive iron oxidizers, and as surfaces to which the iron can sorb or bind. This causes aquatic plants to become heavily encrusted with a light-orange floc of iron oxyhydroxide near the point of oxygen gas released from the plants. Factors such as local geology, parent rock mineralogy, ground-water composition, and geochemically active microbes and plants influence the formation, growth, and persistence of iron bogs. Bog iron is a renewable resource; the same bog can be harvested about once each generation.

== Iron extraction ==
Europeans developed iron smelting from bog iron during the Pre-Roman Iron Age of the 5th/4th–1st centuries BCE, and most iron of the Viking Age (late first millennium CE) was smelted from bog iron. Humans can process bog iron with limited technology, since it does not have to be molten to remove many impurities. Due to its easy accessibility and reducibility, bog iron was commonly used for early iron production. Early metallurgists identified bog-iron deposits by indicators such as withered grass, a wet environment, hygrophilous grass-dominated vegetation, and reddish-brown solutions or depositions in nearby waters. They stabbed wooden or metal sticks into the ground to detect larger ore-deposits, and cut and pulled back layers of peat in the bog using turf knives to extract smaller, pea-sized nodules of bog iron. Early iron-production from bog ore mostly occurred in bloomery furnaces. The resources necessary for production were wood for charcoal, clay for the construction of bloomery furnaces, and water for processing. Iron in the ore is reduced to a spongy iron bloom that stays in the upper part of the furnace while the undesirable elements stream downwards as slag. Smelting with a bloomery furnace often results in between 10 and 20 mass percent Fe being reduced to iron bloom, while the rest is transferred into the slag. The bloom must then be consolidated with a hammer to make usable wrought iron. There is some archaeological evidence that lime was added to furnaces to treat silica-rich ores that were difficult to smelt by the bloomery process.

==Europe==
The first iron smelting attempts date to the 2nd millennium BCE in the Near East. The technology then spread throughout Europe in the following two millennia, reaching Poland in the 2nd century BCE. Iron production reached Scandinavia around 800–500 BCE. Iron production sites in central Sweden are dated to the late Bronze Age and the innovation might have been transmitted from both the south and the east. The ore used was limonite in the form of red soil and bog ore. From 200 CE ore from limonite-deposits in lakes was used. The ore was reduced in bloomeries. There is evidence of a direct relationship between Viking settlements in northern Europe and North America and bog iron deposits. Bog iron dominated the iron production of Norse populated areas, including Scandinavia and Finland, from 500 to 1300 CE. Large scale production of bog iron was also established in Iceland at sites known as &quot;iron farms&quot;. Smaller scale production sites in Iceland consisted of large farmsteads and some original Icelandic settlements, but these seemed to only produce enough iron to be self-sufficient. Even after improved smelting technology made mined ores viable during the Middle Ages, bog ore remained important into modern times, particularly in peasant iron production. In Russia, bog ore was the principal source of iron until the 16th century, when the superior ores of the Ural Mountains became available.

==North America==

===Pre-Columbian===
Iron was produced by the Vikings on Newfoundland around 1021 CE. Excavations at L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows have found considerable evidence for the processing of bog iron and the production of iron ore. The settlement at L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows was situated immediately east of a sedge peat bog and 15 kg of slag was found at the site, which would have produced around 3 kg of usable iron. Analysis of the slag showed that considerably more iron could have been smelted out of the ore, indicating that the workers processing the ore had not been skilled. This supports the idea that iron processing knowledge was widespread and not restricted to major centers of trade and commerce. Ninety-eight nail fragments were also found at the site as well as considerable evidence for woodworking which points to the iron produced at the site possibly being used only for ship repair and not tool making.

===Colonial North America===
Bog iron was widely sought in colonial North America. The earliest known iron mines in North America are the mines from St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, reportedly in operation by Anthony Parkhurst in 1578. The first mining efforts in Virginia occurred as early as 1608. In 1619 Falling Creek Ironworks was established in Chesterfield County, Virginia. It was the location of the first blast furnace facility in North America.

Lake Massapoag in Massachusetts was drawn down by deepening the outlet channel in a search for bog iron. The Saugus Iron Works National Historic Site, on the Saugus River in Saugus, Massachusetts, operated between 1646 and 1668. The site contains a museum and several reconstructed buildings. The success of the Saugus Iron Works, and the rapid depletion of the region&#x27;s natural bog iron, led the owners to send prospectors into the surrounding countryside. In 1658 the company bought of land which covered areas that are now Concord, Acton, and Sudbury. They set up a large production facility in Concord, Massachusetts, along the Assabet River with dams, ponds, watercourses, and hearths, but by 1694 the natural bog iron there had also been exhausted, and the land was sold for farming.

In Central and Southern New Jersey, bog ore was mined and refined for the production of naturally rust-resistant tools and wrought iron rails, many of which still grace staircases in Trenton and Camden. During the American Revolution, bog iron cannonballs were cast for the colonial forces.

===19th century United States===
Bog iron was also found on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. The remains of a commercial smelting operation near Snow Hill, Maryland, are now a state and national historic site. Known as Furnace Town, it was called the Nassawango Iron Furnace after the nearby creek. The commercial furnace ran from about 1825 to 1850.

The Shapleigh Iron Company constructed a smelter at North Shapleigh, Maine, in 1836 to exploit a small bog iron deposit in Little Ossipee Pond. The plant commenced operation in 1837, but according to an 1854 history of Shapleigh &quot;the business [proved] unprofitable, therefore after a few years it was abandoned.&quot;

<text>Leslie Cornelius Arends (September 27, 1895July 17, 1985) was a Republican politician from Illinois who served in the United States House of Representatives from 1935 until 1974.

A native and lifelong resident of Melvin, Illinois, Arends attended Oberlin College and served in the United States Navy during World WarI. He was involved in farming and banking; in addition to renting out several farms he owned, he eventually became president of the local bank his father had started.

Arends was elected to the U.S. House in 1934. He served from 1935 until resigning on December 31, 1974. From 1943 until his retirement, Arends served as the Republican Whip, holding the post during periods of Republican majority (1947-1949, 1953–1955) and minority (1943-1947, 1949–1953, 1955–1974). In addition, Arends rose by seniority to become the ranking minority member of the House Armed Services Committee.

A party loyalist, Arends opposed much government spending, and provided strong support to the party&#x27;s presidential candidates. He remained loyal to Richard M. Nixon during the Watergate scandal, and indicated that he would not vote to impeach Nixon.

After resigning from the House, Arends served on the President&#x27;s Intelligence Advisory Board, and lived in retirement in Melvin, Washington, DC, and Naples, Florida. He died in Naples, and was buried in Melvin.

==Early life==
Born in Melvin, Illinois, on September 27, 1895, Arends was the youngest of ten children (only seven lived to adulthood) born to George Teis Arends and Talea (née Weiss) Arends. His father was born in Peoria to parents who were both natives of Germany; his mother was born in Hanover, Germany.

Arends attended the local schools and from 1912 to 1913 was a student at Oberlin College in Ohio. He enlisted in the United States Navy during World WarI, where he played in the Navy band at numerous war bond rallies. After his discharge he acquired and rented out several farms, and became active in banking. He eventually became president of the Commercial State Bank in Melvin, which had been founded by his father. He was a member of the Ford County Farm Bureau, and a member of the board of trustees of Illinois Wesleyan University, which awarded him the honorary degree of LL.D. in 1962.

==Congressional career==

In 1934, Arends was elected to the 74th Congress. He was reelected nineteen times, and served from January 3, 1935, until resigning on December 31, 1974, a few days before the end of his final term. He alternately served as majority whip and minority whip for House Republicans from 1943 to 1974, and was the longest-serving whip in U.S. House of Representatives history. He rose through seniority to become the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, where one of his pet projects was preventing the closure of Chanute Air Force Base in Illinois; it remained open until 1993.

Arends represented a heavily Republican, largely rural downstate Illinois district. Conservative but pragmatic, he opposed much of the New Deal and remained a staunch isolationist until America entered World WarII. After becoming minority whip in 1943, Arends helped create the powerful Conservative Coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats who controlled the domestic agenda from 1937 to 1964. He was reelected as whip amid Republican in-fighting following their large Congressional losses in the 1964 elections; after their setback, House Republicans replaced leader Charles Halleck with Gerald Ford. Ford backed Peter Frelinghuysen Jr. for Whip. Arends had usually been reelected Whip without opposition, and despite a strong challenge from Frelinghuysen relied on personal relationships forged over thirty years to provide the votes that enabled him to retain the post.

He supported Robert A. Taft over Dwight D. Eisenhower for the 1952 Republican presidential nomination, and was an early supporter of the party&#x27;s nominees Richard M. Nixon and Barry Goldwater in the campaigns of the 1960s. He organized the GOP opposition to Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s Great Society. Arends voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1964, and 1968, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, while Arends did not vote on the Civil Rights Act of 1960 and voted present on the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. During the Watergate scandal, Arends provided unwavering loyalty to President Richard M. Nixon, and said he would not vote for impeachment, citing his strong personal friendship with Nixon and belief that Nixon had performed capably as president. Despite the Whip challenge following the 1966 elections, Nixon&#x27;s successor Gerald Ford and Arends maintained a close personal friendship, ensuring Arends a good relationship with the White House after Nixon&#x27;s resignation.

==Post-Congressional career==

After leaving Congress, Arends served on the President&#x27;s Intelligence Advisory Board, and spent time at homes in Melvin, Naples, Florida, and Washington, DC.

===Legacy===

Arends&#x27;s papers are part of the collections of Illinois Wesleyan University, and the university library&#x27;s special collections room was named for him.

==Death and burial==

Arends died in Naples on July 17, 1985, and was buried at Melvin Cemetery in Melvin. He was survived by his wife Betty (Tychon) and daughter Leslie (&quot;Letty&quot;).

<text>Pietro Aretino (, ; 19 or 20 April 1492 – 21 October 1556) was an Italian author, playwright, poet, satirist and blackmailer, who wielded influence on contemporary art and politics. He was one of the most influential writers of his time and an outspoken critic of the powerful. Owing to his communications and sympathies with religious reformers, he is considered to have been a Nicodemite Protestant. Aretino was a good friend and publicist of the Venetian artist Titian, who painted his portrait three times. Aretino is also remembered for an exchange of letters he had with Michelangelo concerning the latter&#x27;s fresco The Last Judgment.

==Life==
His father was Luca Del Tura, a shoemaker from Arezzo, in Tuscany, Italy, who abandoned his family to join the militia. The father later returned to Arezzo, finally dying in poverty at the age of 85, unforgiven by his son, who never acknowledged the paternal name, taking &quot;Aretino&quot; (meaning &#x27;Arretine, from Arezzo&#x27;) as a surname.
His mother was Margherita, known as Tita, Bonci. Either before or after the abandonment (it is not known which), she entered into a lasting relationship with a local noble, Luigi Bacci, who supported Tita, Pietro and his two sisters and brought up Pietro as part of his own family.

Aretino spent a formative decade in Perugia, before being sent, highly recommended, to Rome. There Agostino Chigi, the rich banker and patron of Raphael, took him under his wing.

When Hanno the elephant, pet of Pope Leo X, died in 1516, Aretino penned a satirical pamphlet entitled &quot;The Last Will and Testament of the Elephant Hanno&quot;. The fictitious will cleverly mocked the leading political and religious figures of Rome at the time, including Pope Leo X himself. The pamphlet was such a success that it started Aretino&#x27;s career and established him as a famous satirist, ultimately known as &quot;the Scourge of Princes&quot;.

Aretino prospered, living from hand to mouth as a hanger-on in the literate circle of his patron, sharpening his satirical talents on the gossip of politics and the Papal Curia, and turning the coarse Roman pasquinade into a rapier weapon of satire, until his sixteen ribald (Lust Sonnets) written to accompany Giulio Romano&#x27;s exquisitely beautiful but utterly pornographic series of drawings engraved by Marcantonio Raimondi under the title finally caused such outrage that he had to temporarily flee Rome.

After Leo&#x27;s death in 1521, his patron was Cardinal Giulio de&#x27; Medici, whose competitors for the papal throne felt the sting of Aretino&#x27;s scurrilous lash. The installation of the Dutch pope Adrian VI ( in Pietro&#x27;s words) instead encouraged Aretino to seek new patrons away from Rome, mainly with Federico II Gonzaga in Mantua, and with the &quot;condottiero&quot; Giovanni de&#x27; Medici (&quot;Giovanni delle Bande Nere&quot;). The election of his old Medici patron as Pope Clement VII sent him briefly back to Rome, but death threats and an attempted assassination from one of the victims of his pen, Bishop Giovanni Giberti, in July 1525, set him wandering through northern Italy in the service of various noblemen, distinguished by his wit, audacity and brilliant and facile talents, until he settled permanently in 1527, in Venice, anti-Papal city of Italy, &quot;seat of all vices&quot;, Aretino noted with gusto.

He was a lover of men, having declared himself &quot;a sodomite&quot; since birth. In a letter to Giovanni de&#x27; Medici written in 1524 Aretino enclosed a satirical poem saying that due to a sudden aberration he had &quot;fallen in love with a female cook and temporarily switched from boys to girls...&quot; (&quot;My Dear Boy&quot;). In his comedy , the lead man is overjoyed to discover that the woman he has been forced to marry is really a page boy in disguise. While at court in Mantua he developed a crush on a young man called Bianchino, and annoyed Duke Federico with a request to plead with the boy on the writer&#x27;s behalf.

Safe in Venice, Aretino became a blackmailer, extorting money from men who had sought his guidance in vice. He &quot;kept all that was famous in Italy in a kind of state of siege&quot;, in Jacob Burckhardt&#x27;s estimation. Francis I of France and Charles V pensioned him at the same time, each hoping for some damage to the reputation of the other. &quot;The rest of his relations with the great is mere beggary and vulgar extortion&quot;, according to Burckhardt. Addison states that &quot;he laid half Europe under contribution.&quot;

At one time, Aretino owned the painting by Parmigianino, &quot;Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror&quot;.

Aretino is said to have died of suffocation from &quot;laughing too much&quot;. The more mundane truth may be that he died from a stroke or heart attack.

==Writings==

Apart from both sacred and profane texts – a satire of high-flown Renaissance Neoplatonic dialogues is set in a brothel – and comedies such as and , Aretino is remembered above all for his letters, full of literary flattery that could turn to blackmail. They circulated widely in manuscript and he collected them and published them at intervals winning as many enemies as it did fame, and earned him the dangerous nickname Ariosto gave him: (&quot;scourge of princes&quot;). In 1559, three years after Aretino&#x27;s death, his entire oeuvre was listed in the papal Index of Prohibited Books.

 is a brilliant parody of Castiglione&#x27;s , and features the adventures of a Sienese gentleman, Messer Maco, who travels to Rome to become a cardinal. He would also like to win himself a mistress, but when he falls in love with a girl he sees in a window, he realizes that only as a courtier would he be able to win her. In mockery of Castiglione&#x27;s advice on how to become the perfect courtier, a charlatan proceeds to teach Messer Maco how to behave as a courtier: he must learn how to deceive and flatter, and sit hours in front of the mirror.

==Portrayals by artists==

Aretino was a close friend of Titian&#x27;s, who painted his portrait three times: a 1527 portrait in the Kunstmuseum Basel, a 1537 portrait in the Frick Collection, and a 1545 portrait in the Pitti Palace. Luba Freedman cites a fourth portrait, from &quot;not later than 1535&quot;, but Xavier F. Salomon, chief curator at the Frick Collection, writes that &quot;there is no evidence that it ever existed&quot;. Titian also portrayed Aretino as Pontius Pilate in his painting &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;, in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, &quot;as a nameless soldier in the crowd&quot; in &quot;Alfonso d&#x27;Avalos Addressing his Troops&quot;, in the Prado Museum, Madrid, and next to a self-portrait in &quot;La Gloria&quot;, also in the Prado. Clement VII made Aretino a Knight of Rhodes, and Julius III named him a Knight of St. Peter, but the chain he wears for his 1545 portrait may have merely been jewelry. In his strictly-for-publication letters to patrons Aretino would often add a verbal portrait to Titian&#x27;s painted one.

Titian was far from the only artist who portrayed Aretino. &quot;Probably no other celebrity of the cinquecento had his image reproduced so often and in so many media: paintings, frescoes, sculptures, prints, medals[...] At various stages of his life Aretino was also portrayed by Sebastiano del Piombo, Alessandro Moretto, Francesco Salviati, Jacopo Tintoretto, and Giorgio Vasari. His portrait was engraved by Marcantonio Raimondi and Giovanni Jacopo Caraglio. His likeness was reproduced on medals by Leone Leoni, Francesco Segala, Alfonso Lombardi, and Alessandro Vittoria and his image was sculpted by Jacopo Sansovino and Danese Cattaneo.&quot;

==The Last Judgment==

In November 1545, Aretino wrote an open letter to Michelangelo criticizing the nudity in &quot;The Last Judgment&quot;, Michelangelo&#x27;s fresco in the Sistine Chapel in Rome. His dialogues, , Aretino wrote, &quot;demonstrate the superiority of my reserve to your indiscretion, seeing that I, while handling themes lascivious and immodest, use language comely and decorous, speak in terms beyond reproach and inoffensive to chaste ears. You, on the contrary, presenting so awful a subject, exhibit saints and angels, these without earthly decency, and those without celestial honors... Your art would be at home in some voluptuous bagnio, certainly not in the highest chapel in the world... I do not write this out of any resentment for the things I begged of you. In truth, if you had sent me what you promised, you would only have been doing what you ought to have desired most eagerly to do in your own interest.&quot; John Addington Symonds writes, &quot;Aretino’s real object was to wheedle some priceless sketch or drawing out of the great master. This appears from a second letter written by him on the 20th of January 1538.&quot;
Symonds describes Michelangelo&#x27;s answer to Aretino&#x27;s November 1545 letter: &quot;Under the form of elaborate compliment it conceals the scorn he must have conceived for Aretino and his insolent advice. Yet he knew how dangerous the man could be, and felt obliged to humour him.&quot; James Connor notes that, in Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;The Last Judgment&quot;, completed in 1541, he had painted Saint Bartholomew displaying his own flayed skin: sagging flayed skin ... many scholars believe depicts Michelangelo&#x27;s own features. Interestingly, the face of Saint Bartholomew [who is holding the skin] is similar to the face of Pietro Aretino, one of Michelangelo&#x27;s chief persecutors.&quot; But these resemblances were unrelated to Aretino&#x27;s letter to Michelangelo. Bernadine Barnes writes that no sixteenth-century critic noticed &quot;the portrait of Pietro Aretino in the fresco... [V]iewers of our own time have often seen him as St Bartholomew, who brandishes a knife in one hand and holds the skin with the semblance of Michelangelo&#x27;s face in the other. However, Aretino&#x27;s criticism [of Michelangelo] was not written until 1545, four years after the fresco was completed. Even Aretino&#x27;s good friend Vasari did not recognize him.&quot;

==Legacy==

Aretino is frequently mentioned in English works of the Elizabethan and later periods and differently appreciated, in comments ranging from &quot;It was one of the wittiest knaves that ever God made&quot; of Nashe (&quot;The Unfortunate Traveller&quot;) to &quot;that notorious ribald of Arezzo&quot; of Milton&#x27;s &quot;Areopagitica&quot;.

The English traveller Sir John Reresby visited &quot;the obscene profane poet&quot; Aretino&#x27;s grave in the church of San Luca, Venice, in the mid-1650s. He relates that the following epitaph had been removed by the inquisitors: This he translates as &quot;Here Aretin, the Tuscan poet, lies, who all the world abused but God, and why? he said he knew him not.&quot; His tomb in San Luca no longer exists.

Pietro&#x27;s first biographer states that there was no epitaph on the tomb. Those who claim that there was a sarcastic epitaph in hendecasyllables suspect that it should be attributed to Bishop Paolo Giovio, and that it was composed when Aretino was still alive:

In 2007, the composer Michael Nyman set some of Aretino&#x27;s to music under the title &quot;8 Lust Songs&quot;. Once again, Aretino&#x27;s texts proved controversial: at a 2008 performance at Cadogan Hall, London, the printed programs were withdrawn following allegations of obscenity.

<text>Sir Samuel Argall ( or 1580 – ) was an English sea captain, navigator, and Deputy-Governour of Virginia, an English colony.

As a sea captain, in 1609, Argall was the first to determine a shorter northern route from England across the Atlantic Ocean to the new English colony of Virginia, based at Jamestown, and made numerous voyages to the New World. He captained one of Lord De La Warr&#x27;s ships in the successful rescue mission to Virginia in 1610 which saved the colony from starvation.

In 1610 he named Delaware Bay in honor of Lord De La Warr. Shortly afterwards Dutch settlers along the bay gave it a different name, but the name Delaware Bay was restored when the English took control of the area in 1665.

He is best known for his diplomacy by force with the Chief of the Powhatan Confederacy. He abducted the Chief&#x27;s daughter, Pocahontas, on 13 April 1613, and held her as a captive at Henricus as security against the return of English captives and property held by Powhatan. Pocahontas had long been a friend of the English and was treated with great respect according to her rank, as the English considered her an Algonquian princess.

Eventually peace and trade relations were restored between the English and the Powhatan Confederacy, after English planter John Rolfe, of nearby Varina Plantation, met and married Pocahontas. Argall was also successful in taking action against French efforts at colonisation in Acadia in North America, and in North Africa. London ruled that the French violated the Charter of the Virginia Company.

Knighted by King James I after serving as Governor of the Virginia Colony, Argall was accused by planters of having been excessively stern in his treatment of them. Examinations of his conduct in London and the opinion of some modern historians have disputed these charges.

==Childhood==
Samuel Argall, baptized 4 December 1580, was the fourth son of Richard Argall (–1588) of East Sutton, Kent, by his third wife, Mary Scott (d. 1598). She was the daughter of Sir Reginald Scott of Scot&#x27;s Hall, one of the foremost houses in Kent, and his second wife, Mary Tuke, the daughter of Sir Bryan Tuke of Layer Marney, Essex and his wife. Tuke was secretary to Cardinal Wolsey.

==Shorter route to Virginia==
In 1609, Argall, as an English ship&#x27;s captain employed by the Virginia Company of London, was the first to develop a shorter, more northerly route for sailing from England across the Atlantic Ocean to the Virginia Colony and its primary port and seat of government at Jamestown. Rather than following the normal practice of going south to the tropics and west with the trade winds, Argall sailed west from the Azores to Bermuda and then almost due west to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. His voyage aboard the &quot;Mary and John&quot; took nine weeks and six days, including two weeks becalmed. This new route enabled the English to avoid hostile Spanish ships and to save on provisions.

Upon his arrival at Jamestown, Captain Argall found the colonists in dire straits. Argall resupplied them with all the food he could spare and returned to England at the end of the summer. The help came to the colony at one of the most critical periods in its history, as this was the beginning of the Starving Time, during which fewer than one in five survived. Without the provisions supplied by Argall, the colony may have been totally destroyed.

During this voyage, Argall also prevented the Spanish from learning about the weakness of the Jamestown colony. In July 1609, Argall encountered a Spanish reconnaissance ship, &quot;La Asunción de Cristo&quot;, under the command of Francisco Fernández de Écija, sent from St. Augustine by governor Pedro de Ibarra to survey activities at Jamestown. Argall had a larger ship, &quot;Mary and John&quot;, stationed at Cape Henry, and chased the Spanish ship, preventing it from entering Chesapeake Bay.

==Under Lord De La Warr==

Argall returned to the Virginia Colony in the summer of 1610, when Royal Governor Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr reinforced the defences of the English against the sometimes hostile Native Americans there. De La Warr became so ill that in the spring of 1611 he sailed home to England, and Sir Thomas Dale took his place as Deputy Governor in charge of the Virginia Colony. After De la Warr reached England and recovered, he wrote a book, &quot;The Relation of the Right Honourable the Lord De-La-Warre, of the Colonie, Planted in Virginia.&quot; He was considered the nominal Royal Governor until his death in 1618.

Serving under Dale, in March 1613, Argall, looking for food for the settlement, sailed up the Potomac River. There, he traded with the Patawomeck, a Native American tribe who were affiliated with the Powhatan Confederacy. The Patawomeck lived at the village of Passapatanzy, as well as several other villages along the river.

When two English colonists began trading with the Patawomeck, they discovered that Pocahontas, the daughter of Wahunsonacock, Chief of the Powhatan Confederacy, was living there. According to a book by Captain John Smith, she had been there for around three months. (But he had left the colony in 1609 and had only a brief exchange with Pocahontas during her visit to England, so the claim is difficult to verify.) Learning this, Argall resolved to capture Pocahontas to aid in negotiations with the Powhatan. Sending for the local chief, Japazaws, Argall told him he must bring her on board his ship, &quot;Treasurer&quot; and suggested luring her with the present of a copper kettle.

According to Patawomeck oral tradition, with the help of Japazaws, the colonists tricked Pocahontas into being captured. Their purpose, as Argall said in a letter, was to ransom her for English prisoners held by Chief Powhatan, along with various weapons and farming tools that the Powhatan people had stolen. Powhatan returned the captives, but failed to satisfy the colonists with the amount of weapons and tools he returned. A long standoff ensued.

Argall also used &quot;Treasurer&quot; to take Pocahontas, her family, and her retinue, including her brother in law Uttamatomakkin, to visit England in 1616. He also captained the ship &quot;George&quot;, that returned John Rolfe to Virginia, after his wife&#x27;s sudden death.

===Raid on Acadia===

Later in 1613, under orders from London, Argall began to raid Acadia, a French colony in what is now Canada. First he sacked the French Jesuit colony of Saint-Sauveur on Mount Desert Island (now part of the state of Maine). He took fourteen prisoners, whom he transported back to Jamestown. He then returned to burn the settlement and remaining structures of an earlier French settlement on Sainte-Croix (now in Maine) and the occupied site of Port Royal (now in Nova Scotia). One of his principal French captives later wrote to praise Argall&#x27;s character and conduct toward the prisoners. Argall was also the first Englishman to visit Manhattan, where he landed and warned the Dutch of their encroachment upon English territory.

===Land ownership and departure from Virginia===

Back In the Virginia Colony, Argall was viewed as an autocrat who was insensitive to the poorer of the colonists, who included indentured servants. The London Company granted him a parcel of land, which he forced free ancient planters to clear, and used the colony&#x27;s stock of corn to farm. 

After Argall served as Principal Governor of Virginia beginning in 1617, Lord De La Warr was enroute from England to investigate complaints about the man, but died at sea in 1618. Before he could be investigated further, Samuel Argall gave gubernatorial powers to Captain Nathaniel Powell and absconded to England aboard the pinnace, &quot;Ellinor&quot;, in 1618/9. Argall was succeeded by Sir George Yeardley (who named a son &quot;Argoll&quot; in his honor). After returning to London, Argall was cleared of the accusations against him, and continued to serve King James I.

==Later life and career==
In 1620, Argall was captain of a merchant vessel that took part in an expedition against Algiers in North Africa. It was then part of the Ottoman Empire. On his return, he was made a member of the Council of New England. Later he was named admiral for New England.

On 26 June 1622, Argall was knighted by King James I. In 1625, he was admiral of a fleet of 28 vessels, which took many prizes in capturing other nation&#x27;s vessels off the coast of France. In October he commanded the flagship in an unsuccessful attack on Cadiz, Spain.

Argall never married. He died at sea on or about 24 January 1626. He left a will dated 23 May 1625, which was proved 21 March 1626. In it he mentions the following relations: sister Filmer, niece Sarah Filmer, nephew Samuel Filmer; sister Bathurst, nephew Samuel Bathurst; sister Fleetwood; brother John Argall Esq and John&#x27;s son Samuel, whose descendants have flourished in Virginia and the West. He was interred in St Gluvias churchyard, Penryn, Cornwall.

<text>Robison Field is the best-known of several names given to a former Major League Baseball park in St. Louis, Missouri. It was the home of the St. Louis Cardinals of the National League from April 27, 1893 until June 6, 1920.

==History==

Today&#x27;s Cardinals of the National League began in 1882, as the St. Louis Browns of the then-major American Association. They won four championships during the Association&#x27;s ten-year existence of 1882 through 1891. During that decade, the team was playing their home games at Sportsman&#x27;s Park, at the corner of Grand and Dodier. In 1892, four of the Association clubs were absorbed into the National League, and the Association folded. Sportsman&#x27;s Park remained the home of the Browns during their first NL season.

=== New Sportsmans&#x27; Park ===

Although the Browns had been the most successful of the Association clubs, they fell on hard times for some years after the merger. For 1893, owner Chris von der Ahe moved his team a few blocks to the northwest and opened a &quot;New&quot; Sportsman&#x27;s Park, on the southeast corner of Natural Bridge and Vandeventer. The move to this particular site was part of a &quot;deal&quot;, as the property had been owned by a trolley company, who then ran a trolley line out near the ballpark. The diamond was in the northwest corner of the block. Prairie Avenue was the east (left field) border. Right field, the shorter of the outfields, was bordered by Lexington Avenue.

The ballpark was generations ahead of its time in some ways. Along with the basic stands, Von der Ahe had built an adjoining amusement park, a beer garden, a race track in the outfield, a &quot;shoot-the-shoots&quot; water flume ride, and an artificial lake (used for ice skating in winter). The side show notwithstanding, the club performed poorly on the field for most of the 1890s, consistently finishing at or near last place in the 12-team league as Von der Ahe sold off his best players in order to keep the club solvent.

On April 16, 1898, a fire ignited by a dropped and still-burning cigar consumed the grandstands and other structures. A heroic overnight effort was made to construct some temporary seating, and the game scheduled for the 17th was played. Von der Ahe was able to secure financing to rebuild the permanent stands, albeit in a much more modest design than before. But this was the last step in the decline of his once-proud franchise. 

=== League Park ===

In 1899, Von der Ahe sold the Browns to Frank and Stanley Robison. By then the ballpark was no longer the &quot;New&quot; Sportsman&#x27;s Park. During the Robison&#x27;s tenure, the venue was simply called League Park. It would bear that name through the 1910 season.

The Robison brothers sought to change the image and reverse the fortunes of their team. They dropped the old &quot;Browns&quot; identity, abandoning that team color and switching to Cardinal red. This would yield a new and lasting nickname. However, for 1899 they are known to historians as the &quot;Perfectos&quot;.

The Robisons had previously owned the Cleveland Spiders, and in fact still owned them as the 1899 season began (a situation that would not be allowed today). They stripped Cleveland of its best players, including Cy Young, and sent them to St. Louis. If this made the St. Louis club the &quot;Perfectos&quot;, it also unfortunately made the Cleveland club the &quot;Wanderers&quot;, as they became known when they were forced to play most of that season (their last) on the road. Despite loading up their roster, the previously cellar-dwelling St. Louis club was only able to improve to fifth place.

Cleveland and three other clubs were contracted after the 1899 season. The Cardinals began the 1900 season with less competition, but sank back toward the cellar again. The only thing that kept the baseball situation in balance was that the new Browns of the American League (who moved from Milwaukee to St. Louis in 1902) generally fared equally poorly in the pennant races.

The wooden ballpark continued to be plagued by fire. On May 4, 1901, a fire began under the main part of the stands, and as with the 1898 fire, the structure was consumed within half an hour. During the rebuilding process, the Robison brothers arranged with the management of Athletic Park (as the &quot;old&quot; Sportsman&#x27;s Park was being called by then) to play there until yet another wooden stand could be built. After playing there on the 5th, in a venue that local newspapers described as wholly inadequate for major league ball, they went on a month-long road trip, and returned to a newly rebuilt League Park on June 3.

In its final form, the park was typical for its era: a wooden structure, with a covered grandstand behind home plate and extending to first and third base; open bleachers extending to the left field corner; bleachers in parts of the outfield; and a covered pavilion from first base to the right field corner.

=== Robison Field ===

Helene Britton, daughter of Frank Robison, inherited the Cardinals team and the ballpark from her uncle Stanley upon his death in 1911. Helene renamed the ballpark Robison Field as a memorial to her father (who had died in 1908) and her uncle. She held the club for the next few seasons, until selling her interest in the team in 1917 to a group that included Sam Breadon.

The Cardinals never won a league championship at Robison Field, but they had some flirtations with success. In 1914, pennant fever gripped Robison Field for the first time in the 20th Century. In late August, the Cardinals were in a close three-way race with the New York Giants and the Boston Braves (who eventually won the National League title). An overflow crowd filled the old park for a doubleheader against the Giants on August 26. The Cardinals won the first game 1-0. The crowd swarmed the field between games, and Giants&#x27; manager John McGraw strenuously complained to the umpiring crew. The police cleared the field and the Giants went on to win the second game 4-0.[St. Louis &quot;Globe-Democrat&quot;, Aug. 27, 1914, p.6] Three days later, the Cardinals again drew an overflow crowd, this time for a doubleheader against the Braves, who swept the Cardinals and dealt a severe blow to the Cardinals&#x27; pennant hopes. [St. Louis &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot;, Aug. 30, 1914, sec.4 p.1]

=== Cardinal Field ===

Once the Robison family was no longer associated with the team, the park was often called simply Cardinal Field in its final years. Breadon attained majority ownership in 1920 and decided that the nearly three-decades-old wooden ballpark was no longer adequate.

In mid-season 1920 the Cardinals abandoned this ballpark and moved back to Sportsman&#x27;s Park. Their final game at the old park came on June 6, and after a road trip of three-plus weeks, they made their debut at the new park on July 1. The park had been rebuilt, owned and occupied by the American League version of the Browns since 1902. The &quot;Old&quot; Sportsman&#x27;s Park would outlive the &quot;New&quot; by some four decades.

==Legacy==

Robison Field was the last remaining major league ballpark that was primarily wooden. The park site continued to be owned by the Cardinals for a few more years. They finally sold the property to the developers of Beaumont High School, which was built on the site and was opened in 1926. After their constant on-field struggles at the old park, the club had begun to improve after their move, and with some fresh cash, they were ready to taste success. 1926 would also be the year of the Cardinals&#x27; first modern league and World Series championship.

Beaumont High School produced a number of major league ballplayers. Its own life cycle ended in the spring of 2014, when it closed.

<doc id="770467" wikidata="Q874296" url="?curid=770467" title="Tandem mass spectrometry">
<text>Tandem mass spectrometry, also known as MS/MS or MS2, is a technique in instrumental analysis where two or more stages of analysis using one or more mass analyzer are performed with an additional reaction step in between these analyses to increase their abilities to analyse chemical samples. A common use of tandem MS is the analysis of biomolecules, such as proteins and peptides.

The molecules of a given sample are ionized and the first spectrometer (designated MS1) separates these ions by their mass-to-charge ratio (often given as m/z or m/Q). Ions of a particular m/z-ratio coming from MS1 are selected and then made to split into smaller fragment ions, e.g. by collision-induced dissociation, ion-molecule reaction, or photodissociation. These fragments are then introduced into the second mass spectrometer (MS2), which in turn separates the fragments by their m/z-ratio and detects them. The fragmentation step makes it possible to identify and separate ions that have very similar m/z-ratios in regular mass spectrometers.

== Structure ==
Typical tandem mass spectrometry instrumentation setups include triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (QqQ), multi-sector mass spectrometer, ion trap, quadrupole–time of flight (Q-TOF), Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR), and hybrid mass spectrometers.

=== Triple quadrupole mass spectrometer ===
Triple quadrupole mass spectrometers use the first and third quadrupoles as mass filters. When analytes pass the second quadrupole, the fragmentation proceeds through collision with gas.

=== Quadrupole–time of flight (Q-TOF) ===
Q-TOF mass spectrometer combines quadrupole and TOF instruments, which together enable fragmentation experiments that yield highly accurate mass quantitations for product ions. This is a method of mass spectrometry in which fragmented ion (&quot;m&quot;/&quot;z&quot;) ratios are determined through a time of flight measurement.

=== Hybrid mass spectrometer ===
Hybrid mass spectrometer consists of more than two mass analyzers.

==Instrumentation==

Multiple stages of mass analysis separation can be accomplished with individual mass spectrometer elements separated in space or using a single mass spectrometer with the MS steps separated in time. For tandem mass spectrometry in space, the different elements are often noted in a shorthand, giving the type of mass selector used.

=== Tandem in space ===

In tandem mass spectrometry &quot;in space&quot;, the separation elements are physically separated and distinct, although there is a physical connection between the elements to maintain high vacuum. These elements can be sectors, transmission quadrupole, or time-of-flight. When using multiple quadrupoles, they can act as both mass analyzers and collision chambers.

Common notation for mass analyzers is &quot;Q&quot; – quadrupole mass analyzer; &quot;q&quot; – radio frequency collision quadrupole; &quot;TOF&quot; – time-of-flight mass analyzer; &quot;B&quot; – magnetic sector, and &quot;E&quot; – electric sector. The notation can be combined to indicate various hybrid instrument, for example &quot;QqQ&quot;&#x27; – triple quadrupole mass spectrometer; &quot;QTOF&quot; – quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (also &quot;QqTOF&quot;); and &quot;BEBE&quot; – four-sector (reverse geometry) mass spectrometer.

===Tandem in time===

By doing tandem mass spectrometry &quot;in time&quot;, the separation is accomplished with ions trapped in the same place, with multiple separation steps taking place over time. A quadrupole ion trap or Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) instrument can be used for such an analysis. Trapping instruments can perform multiple steps of analysis, which is sometimes referred to as MS&quot;n&quot; (MS to the &quot;n&quot;). Often the number of steps, &quot;n&quot;, is not indicated, but occasionally the value is specified; for example MS3 indicates three stages of separation.
Tandem in time MS instruments do not use the modes described next, but typically collect all of the information from a precursor ion scan and a parent ion scan of the entire spectrum. Each instrumental configuration utilizes a unique mode of mass identification.

===Tandem in space MS/MS modes===
When tandem MS is performed with an in space design, the instrument must operate in one of a variety of modes. There are a number of different tandem MS/MS experimental setups and each mode has its own applications and provides different information. Tandem MS in space uses the coupling of two instrument components which measure the same mass spectrum range but with a controlled fractionation between them in space, while tandem MS in time involves the use of an ion trap.

There are four main scan experiments possible using MS/MS: precursor ion scan, product ion scan, neutral loss scan, and selected reaction monitoring.

For a precursor ion scan, the product ion is selected in the second mass analyzer, and the precursor masses are scanned in the first mass analyzer. Note that precursor ion is synonymous with parent ion and product ion with daughter ion; however the use of these anthropomorphic terms is discouraged.

In a product ion scan, a precursor ion is selected in the first stage, allowed to fragment and then all resultant masses are scanned in the second mass analyzer and detected in the detector that is positioned after the second mass analyzer. This experiment is commonly performed to identify transitions used for quantification by tandem MS.

In a neutral loss scan, the first mass analyzer scans all the masses. The second mass analyzer also scans, but at a set offset from the first mass analyzer. This offset corresponds to a neutral loss that is commonly observed for the class of compounds. In a constant-neutral-loss scan, all precursors that undergo the loss of a specified common neutral are monitored. To obtain this information, both mass analyzers are scanned simultaneously, but with a mass offset that correlates with the mass of the specified neutral. Similar to the precursor-ion scan, this technique is also useful in the selective identification of closely related class of compounds in a mixture.

In selected reaction monitoring, both mass analyzers are set to a selected mass. This mode is analogous to selected ion monitoring for MS experiments. A selective analysis mode, which can increase sensitivity.

==Fragmentation==

Fragmentation of gas-phase ions is essential to tandem mass spectrometry and occurs between different stages of mass analysis. There are many methods used to fragment the ions and these can result in different types of fragmentation and thus different information about the structure and composition of the molecule.

===In-source fragmentation===
Often, the ionization process is sufficiently violent to leave the resulting ions with sufficient internal energy to fragment within the mass spectrometer. If the product ions persist in their non-equilibrium state for a moderate amount of time before auto-dissociation this process is called metastable fragmentation. Nozzle-skimmer fragmentation refers to the purposeful induction of in-source fragmentation by increasing the nozzle-skimmer potential on usually electrospray based instruments. Although in-source fragmentation allows for fragmentation analysis, it is not technically tandem mass spectrometry unless metastable ions are mass analyzed or selected before auto-dissociation and a second stage of analysis is performed on the resulting fragments. In-source fragmentation can be used in lieu of tandem mass spectrometry through the utilization of Enhanced in-Source Fragmentation Annotation (EISA) technology which generates fragmentation that directly matches tandem mass spectrometry data. Fragments observed by EISA have higher signal intensity than traditional fragments which suffer losses in the collision cells of tandem mass spectrometers. EISA enables fragmentation data acquisition on MS1 mass analyzers such as time-of-flight and single quadrupole instruments. In-source fragmentation is often used in addition to tandem mass spectrometry (with post-source fragmentation) to allow for two steps of fragmentation in a pseudo MS3-type of experiment.

===Collision-induced dissociation===
Post-source fragmentation is most often what is being used in a tandem mass spectrometry experiment. Energy can also be added to the ions, which are usually already vibrationally excited, through post-source collisions with neutral atoms or molecules, the absorption of radiation, or the transfer or capture of an electron by a multiply charged ion. Collision-induced dissociation (CID), also called collisionally activated dissociation (CAD), involves the collision of an ion with a neutral atom or molecule in the gas phase and subsequent dissociation of the ion. For example, consider
:&lt;chem&gt;{AB+} + M -&gt; {A} + {B+} + M&lt;/chem&gt;

where the ion AB+ collides with the neutral species M and subsequently breaks apart. The details of this process are described by collision theory. Due to different instrumental configuration, two main different types of CID are possible: &quot;(i)&quot; beam-type (in which precursor ions are fragmented on-the-flight) and &quot;(ii)&quot; ion trap-type (in which precursor ions are first trapped, and then fragmented).

A third and more recent type of CID fragmentation is higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD). HCD is a CID technique specific to orbitrap mass spectrometers in which fragmentation takes place external to the ion trap, it happens in the HCD cell (in some instruments named &quot;ion routing multipole&quot;). HCD is a trap-type fragmentation that has been shown to have beam-type characteristics. Freely available large scale high resolution tandem mass spectrometry databases exist (e.g. METLIN with 850,000 molecular standards each with experimental CID MS/MS data), and are typically used to facilitate small molecule identification.

===Electron capture and transfer methods===
The energy released when an electron is transferred to or captured by a multiply charged ion can induce fragmentation.

====Electron-capture dissociation====
If an electron is added to a multiply charged positive ion, the Coulomb energy is liberated. Adding a free electron is called electron-capture dissociation (ECD), and is represented by

:formula_1

for a multiply protonated molecule M.

====Electron-transfer dissociation====
Adding an electron through an ion-ion reaction is called electron-transfer dissociation (ETD). Similar to electron-capture dissociation, ETD induces fragmentation of cations (e.g. peptides or proteins) by transferring electrons to them. It was invented by Donald F. Hunt, Joshua Coon, John E. P. Syka and Jarrod Marto at the University of Virginia.

ETD does not use free electrons but employs radical anions (e.g. anthracene or azobenzene) for this purpose:

:formula_2

where A is the anion.

ETD cleaves randomly along the peptide backbone (c and z ions) while side chains and modifications such as phosphorylation are left intact. The technique only works well for higher charge state ions (z&gt;2), however relative to collision-induced dissociation (CID), ETD is advantageous for the fragmentation of longer peptides or even entire proteins. This makes the technique important for top-down proteomics. Much like ECD, ETD is effective for peptides with modifications such as phosphorylation.

Electron-transfer and higher-energy collision dissociation (EThcD) is a combination ETD and HCD where the peptide precursor is initially subjected to an ion/ion reaction with fluoranthene anions in a linear ion trap, which generates c- and z-ions. In the second step HCD all-ion fragmentation is applied to all ETD derived ions to generate b- and y- ions prior to final analysis in the orbitrap analyzer. This method employs dual fragmentation to generate ion- and thus data-rich MS/MS spectra for peptide sequencing and PTM localization.

====Negative electron-transfer dissociation====
Fragmentation can also occur with a deprotonated species, in which an electron is transferred from the species to a cationic reagent in a negative electron transfer dissociation (NETD):

:formula_3

Following this transfer event, the electron-deficient anion undergoes internal rearrangement and fragments. NETD is the ion/ion analogue of electron-detachment dissociation (EDD).

NETD is compatible with fragmenting peptide and proteins along the backbone at the Cα-C bond. The resulting fragments are usually a•- and x-type product ions.

====Electron-detachment dissociation====
Electron-detachment dissociation (EDD) is a method for fragmenting anionic species in mass spectrometry. It serves as a negative counter mode to electron capture dissociation. Negatively charged ions are activated by irradiation with electrons of moderate kinetic energy. The result is ejection of electrons from the parent ionic molecule, which causes dissociation via recombination.

====Charge-transfer dissociation====
Reaction between positively charged peptides and cationic reagents, also known as charge transfer dissociation (CTD), has recently been demonstrated as an alternative high-energy fragmentation pathway for low-charge state (1+ or 2+) peptides. The proposed mechanism of CTD using helium cations as the reagent is:
:formula_4
Initial reports are that CTD causes backbone Cα-C bond cleavage of peptides and provides a•- and x-type product ions.

===Photodissociation===
The energy required for dissociation can be added by photon absorption, resulting in ion photodissociation and represented by

:&lt;chem&gt;{AB+} + \mathit{h\nu} -&gt; {A} + B+&lt;/chem&gt;

where formula_5 represents the photon absorbed by the ion. Ultraviolet lasers can be used, but can lead to excessive fragmentation of biomolecules.

====Infrared multiphoton dissociation====
Infrared photons will heat the ions and cause dissociation if enough of them are absorbed. This process is called infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) and is often accomplished with a carbon dioxide laser and an ion trapping mass spectrometer such as a FTMS.

====Blackbody infrared radiative dissociation====
Blackbody radiation can be used for photodissociation in a technique known as blackbody infrared radiative dissociation (BIRD). In the BIRD method, the entire mass spectrometer vacuum chamber is heated to create infrared light. BIRD uses this radiation to excite increasingly more energetic vibrations of the ions, until a bond breaks, creating fragments. This is similar to infrared multiphoton dissociation which also uses infrared light, but from a different source. BIRD is most often used with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

===Surface-induced dissociation===
With surface-induced dissociation (SID), the fragmentation is a result of the collision of an ion with a surface under high vacuum. Today, SID is used to fragment a wide range of ions. Years ago, it was only common to use SID on lower mass, singly charged species because ionization methods and mass analyzer technologies weren&#x27;t advanced enough to properly form, transmit, or characterize ions of high m/z. Over time, self-assembled monolayer surfaces (SAMs) composed of CF3(CF2)10CH2CH2S on gold have been the most prominently used collision surfaces for SID in a tandem spectrometer. SAMs have acted as the most desirable collision targets due to their characteristically large effective masses for the collision of incoming ions. Additionally, these surfaces are composed of rigid fluorocarbon chains, which don&#x27;t significantly dampen the energy of the projectile ions. The fluorocarbon chains are also beneficial because of their ability to resist facile electron transfer from the metal surface to the incoming ions. SID&#x27;s ability to produce subcomplexes that remain stable and provide valuable information on connectivity is unmatched by any other dissociation technique. Since the complexes produced from SID are stable and retain distribution of charge on the fragment, this produces a unique, spectra which the complex centers around a narrower m/z distribution. The SID products and the energy at which they form are reflective of the strengths and topology of the complex. The unique dissociation patterns help discover the Quaternary structure of the complex. The symmetric charge distribution and dissociation dependence are unique to SID and make the spectra produced distinctive from any other dissociation technique.

The SID technique is also applicable to ion-mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS). Three different methods for this technique include analyzing the characterization of topology, intersubunit connectivity, and the degree of unfolding for protein structure. Analysis of protein structure unfolding is the most commonly used application of the SID technique. For Ion-mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS), SID is used for dissociation of the source activated precursors of three different types of protein complexes: C-reactive protein (CRP), transthyretin (TTR), and concanavalin A (Con A). This method is used to observe the unfolding degree for each of these complexes. For this observation, SID showed the precursor ions&#x27; structures that exist before the collision with the surface. IM-MS utilizes the SID as a direct measure of the conformation for each proteins&#x27; subunit.

Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) are able to provide ultrahigh resolution and high mass accuracy to instruments that take mass measurements. These features make FTICR mass spectrometers a useful tool for a wide variety of applications such as several dissociation experiments such as collision-induced dissociation (CID, electron transfer dissociation (ETD), and others. In addition, surface-induced dissociation has been implemented with this instrument for the study of fundamental peptide fragmentation. Specifically, SID has been applied to the study of energetics and the kinetics of gas-phase fragmentation within an ICR instrument. This approach has been used to understand the gas-phase fragmentation of protonated peptides, odd-electron peptide ions, non-covalent ligand-peptide complexes, and ligated metal clusters.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

==Quantitative proteomics==
Quantitative proteomics is used to determine the relative or absolute amount of proteins in a sample. Several quantitative proteomics methods are based on tandem mass spectrometry. MS/MS has become a benchmark procedure for the structural elucidation of complex biomolecules.

One method commonly used for quantitative proteomics is isobaric tag labeling. Isobaric tag labeling enables simultaneous identification and quantification of proteins from multiple samples in a single analysis. To quantify proteins, peptides are labeled with chemical tags that have the same structure and nominal mass, but vary in the distribution of heavy isotopes in their structure. These tags, commonly referred to as tandem mass tags, are designed so that the mass tag is cleaved at a specific linker region upon higher-energy collisional-induced dissociation (HCD) during tandem mass spectrometry yielding reporter ions of different masses. Protein quantitation is accomplished by comparing the intensities of the reporter ions in the MS/MS spectra. Two commercially available isobaric tags are iTRAQ and TMT reagents.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

===Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)===

An isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) is a reagent for tandem mass spectrometry that is used to determine the amount of proteins from different sources in a single experiment.
It uses stable isotope labeled molecules that can form a covalent bond with the N-terminus and side chain amines of proteins. The iTRAQ reagents are used to label peptides from different samples that are pooled and analyzed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. The fragmentation of the attached tag generates a low molecular mass reporter ion that can be used to relatively quantify the peptides and the proteins from which they originated.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

===Tandem mass tag (TMT)===
A tandem mass tag (TMT) is an isobaric mass tag chemical label used for protein quantification and identification. The tags contain four regions: mass reporter, cleavable linker, mass normalization, and protein reactive group. TMT reagents can be used to simultaneously analyze 2 to 11 different peptide samples prepared from cells, tissues or biological fluids. Recent developments allow up to 16 and even 18 samples (16plex or 18plex respectively) to be analyzed. Three types of TMT reagents are available with different chemical reactivities: (1) a reactive NHS ester functional group for labeling primary amines (TMTduplex, TMTsixplex, TMT10plex plus TMT11-131C), (2) a reactive iodoacetyl functional group for labeling free sulfhydryls (iodoTMT) and (3) reactive alkoxyamine functional group for labeling of carbonyls (aminoxyTMT).

=== Multiplexed DIA (plexDIA) ===
The progress in data independent acquisition (DIA) enabled multiplexed quantitative proteomics with non-isobaric mass tags and a new method called plexDIA introduced in 2021. This new approach increases the number of data points by parallelizing both samples and peptides, thus achieving multiplicative gains. It has the potential to continue scaling proteomic throughput with new mass tags and algorithms. plexDIA is applicable to both bulk and single-cell samples and is particularly powerful for single-cell proteomics.

==Applications==
===Peptides===

Tandem mass spectrometry can be used for protein sequencing. When intact proteins are introduced to a mass analyzer, this is called &quot;top-down proteomics&quot; and when proteins are digested into smaller peptides and subsequently introduced into the mass spectrometer, this is called &quot;bottom-up proteomics&quot;. Shotgun proteomics is a variant of bottom up proteomics in which proteins in a mixture are digested prior to separation and tandem mass spectrometry.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

Tandem mass spectrometry can produce a peptide sequence tag that can be used to identify a peptide in a protein database. A notation has been developed for indicating peptide fragments that arise from a tandem mass spectrum. Peptide fragment ions are indicated by a, b, or c if the charge is retained on the N-terminus and by x, y or z if the charge is maintained on the C-terminus. The subscript indicates the number of amino acid residues in the fragment. Superscripts are sometimes used to indicate neutral losses in addition to the backbone fragmentation, * for loss of ammonia and ° for loss of water. Although peptide backbone cleavage is the most useful for sequencing and peptide identification other fragment ions may be observed under high energy dissociation conditions. These include the side chain loss ions d, v, w and ammonium ions and additional sequence-specific fragment ions associated with particular amino acid residues.

===Oligosaccharides===
Oligosaccharides may be sequenced using tandem mass spectrometry in a similar manner to peptide sequencing. Fragmentation generally occurs on either side of the glycosidic bond (b, c, y and z ions) but also under more energetic conditions through the sugar ring structure in a cross-ring cleavage (x ions). Again trailing subscripts are used to indicate position of the cleavage along the chain. For cross ring cleavage ions the nature of the cross ring cleavage is indicated by preceding superscripts.

===Oligonucleotides===
Tandem mass spectrometry has been applied to DNA and RNA sequencing. A notation for gas-phase fragmentation of oligonucleotide ions has been proposed.

===Newborn screening===
{{Main|Newborn screening}}
Newborn screening is the process of testing newborn babies for treatable genetic, endocrinologic, metabolic and hematologic diseases. The development of tandem mass spectrometry screening in the early 1990s led to a large expansion of potentially detectable congenital metabolic diseases that affect blood levels of organic acids.

Small molecule analysis

It has been shown that tandem mass spectrometry data is highly consistent across instrument and manufacturer platforms including quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) and Q Exactive instrumentation, especially at 20 eV.

== Limitation ==
Tandem mass spectrometry cannot be applied for single-cell analyses as it is insensitive to analyze such small amounts of a cell. These limitations are primarily due to a combination of inefficient ion production and ion losses within the instruments due to chemical noise sources of solvents.

== Future outlook ==
Tandem mass spectrometry will be a useful tool for protein characterization, nucleoprotein complexes, and other biological structures. However, some challenges left such as analyzing the characterization of the proteome quantitatively and qualitatively.

<text>Giulio Carlo Argan (17 May 1909 – 12 November 1992) was an Italian art historian, critic and politician.

==Biography==
Argan was born in Turin and studied in the University of Turin, graduating in 1931. In 1928 he entered the National Fascist Party. In the 1930 he worked for the National Antiquity and Arts Directorate, first in Turin and then in Modena and Rome, where he collaborated to the creation of the Istituto Superiore per la Conservazione ed il Restauro and directed the magazine &quot;Le Arti&quot;. His career was boosted by his friendship with the Fascist leader Cesare Maria De Vecchi, then national Minister of Education.

In 1938 he published a manual of art for high schools, while in the 1940s he collaborated to the magazine &quot;Primato&quot;, founded and directed by Giuseppe Bottai, another Fascist &quot;gerarca&quot;. After World War II, he taught in universities Palermo and, from 1959, in Rome. Argan co-founded the publishing house Il Saggiatore and he was a member of the Superior Council of Antiquities and Fine Arts (predecessor of the Ministry of Culture), in which he remained until 1974. In 1968 he published his most famous work, &quot;Storia dell&#x27;Arte Italiana&quot; (History of Italian Art). In 1973 he founded the Rome ISIA, Italy&#x27;s oldest institution in the field of industrial design.

He was the first Communist mayor of Rome, between 1976 and 1979. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1992. He died in Rome.

<text>Aristarchus of Samothrace ( &quot;Aristarchos o Samothrax&quot;; BC) was an ancient Greek grammarian, noted as the most influential of all scholars of Homeric poetry. He was the head librarian of the Library of Alexandria and seems to have succeeded his teacher Aristophanes of Byzantium in that role.

== Life ==
Aristarchus left the island of Samothrace at a young age and went to Alexandria, where he studied with the director of the library. Later, he was a teacher at the royal courtyard, and then director of the library from 153 to 145BC. After he was persecuted by his disciple Ptolemy the Benefactor, he found refuge in Cyprus, where he died.

It is said that Aristarchus had a remarkable memory and was completely indifferent as to his external appearance.

Accounts of his death vary, though they agree that it was during the persecutions of Ptolemy VIII of Egypt. In one account, he contracted an incurable dropsy and starved himself to death while in exile on Cyprus.

== Work ==
=== Homeric poems ===

He established the most historically important critical edition of the Homeric poems, and he is said to have applied his teacher&#x27;s accent system to it, pointing the texts with a careful eye for metrical correctness. His rejection of doubtful lines made his severity proverbial. It is likely that he, or more probably, another predecessor at Alexandria, Zenodotus, was responsible for the division of the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; into twenty-four books each.

=== Other works ===
According to the &quot;Suda&quot;, Aristarchus wrote 800 treatises ( &quot;hypomnemata&quot;) on various topics; these are all lost but for fragments preserved in the various &quot;scholia.&quot; His works cover such writers as Alcaeus, Anacreon, Pindar, Hesiod, and the tragedians.

=== Punctation ===
He modified the system of the ancient Greek textual signs (&quot;semeia&quot;) and from some point on these signs were called Aristarchian symbols. The historical connection of his name to literary criticism has created the term aristarch for someone who is a judgmental critic.

<doc id="770475" wikidata="Q4973043" url="?curid=770475" title="Brodie knob">
<text>A brodie knob (alternative spelling: brody knob) is a doorknob-shaped handle that attaches to the steering wheel of an automobile or other vehicle or equipment with a steering wheel. Other names for this knob include suicide, necker, granny, knuckle buster, and wheel spinner.

== Design and use ==
The device is a small, independently rotating knob (similar to a U.S. classic door knob) facing the driver that is securely mounted on the outside rim of a steering wheel. The protruding knob is an aftermarket accessory. The free rotation is intended to help make steering with one hand easier or faster.

Some heavy automobiles without a power steering system tended to have heavy and slow responses requiring hand-over-hand turning of the wheel by the driver, and the knob allowed the driver to &quot;crank&quot; the steering wheel to make faster turns.

Brodie knobs were popular on trucks and tractors before the advent of power steering. Their primary use is still in trucks, particularly semi trucks, where they allow simultaneous steering and operation of the radio or gearshift. They are also used on forklifts, farm tractors, construction equipment, riding lawnmowers, and ice resurfacers, where frequent sharp turning is required.

The knobs are sometimes installed as an aftermarket accessory on farm and commercial tractors, their primary purpose being to ease one-handed steering. At the same time, the driver operates other controls with the other hand or is moving in reverse.

Some boats are equipped with a helm featuring a stainless-steel wheel with a brodie knob.

== Etymology and disadvantages ==
The &quot;Steering Wheel Spinner Knob&quot; was invented by Joel R. Thorp of Wisconsin in 1936. The name &quot;Brodie knob&quot; is a reference to Steve Brodie and was meant to describe all manner of reckless stunts that can be performed with the spinner knob.

The device allows the driver to turn the steering wheel quickly from fully one side to the other, making it possible to make cars &quot;spin like a top&quot; on snow-covered streets, but it also causes drivers to oversteer at speed because of the reduced driver&#x27;s feel for the car&#x27;s steering system and the road.

The device is often called a &quot;suicide knob&quot; because of being notoriously useless for controlling the wheel during an emergency.

It is also called a &quot;knuckle buster&quot; because of the disadvantage posed by the knob when letting go of the steering wheel after going around a corner, the wheel spins rapidly, and the knob can hit the user&#x27;s knuckle, forearm or elbow. If the driver is wearing a long-sleeved shirt, the protruding accessory on the steering wheel&#x27;s rim can also become caught in the sleeve&#x27;s open cut by the button. Attempting to free a tangled shirt sleeve from the knob may cause the driver to lose control of the car. The knobs can be dangerous if improperly installed, and in case of a collision because they can cause additional injuries to the driver upon impact.

Other names include &quot;wheel spinner,&quot; &quot;granny knob,&quot; and &quot;necker&#x27;s knob&quot; because it facilitated driving by using only one arm, leaving the other arm for romantic purposes.

== Legality ==
Some U.S. states have laws that regulate or prohibit the use of brodie knobs. Some states allow the use of an accessory knob on the steering wheel for drivers who need them to operate a vehicle because of a disability.

The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations restrict the use of auxiliary devices for specific construction vehicles. Moreover, OSHA prohibits modification of industrial equipment without the approval of the equipment manufacturer.

In the Netherlands, brodie knobs are only allowed if the driver has a valid medical reason for it. In forklifts and other equipment requiring frequent sharp steering, they are permitted regardless of medical reason.

The regulations in the UK do not allow any protrusions of the steering wheel, except for those with disabilities who need modifications for their cars.

<doc id="770481" wikidata="Q313018" url="?curid=770481" title="Aristophanes of Byzantium">
<text>Aristophanes of Byzantium ( ; Byzantium – Alexandria BC) was a Hellenistic Greek scholar, critic and grammarian, particularly renowned for his work in Homeric scholarship, but also for work on other classical authors such as Pindar and Hesiod. He soon moved to Alexandria and studied under Zenodotus, Callimachus, and Dionysius Iambus. He succeeded Eratosthenes as head librarian of the Library of Alexandria at the age of sixty. His students included Callistratus, Aristarchus of Samothrace, and perhaps Agallis. He was succeeded by Apollonius &quot;The Classifier&quot; (not to be confused with Apollonius of Rhodes, a previous head librarian of Alexandria). Aristophanes&#x27; pupil, Aristarchus of Samothrace, would be the sixth head librarian at the Library of Alexandria.

== Work ==
Aristophanes was the first to deny that the &quot;Precepts of Chiron&quot; was the work of Hesiod.

=== Inventions ===
==== Accent system ====
Aristophanes is credited with reducing the accents used in Greek to designate pronunciation to a definite accent system, as the tonal, pitched system of archaic and Classical Greek was giving way (or had given way) to the stress-based system of Koine. This was also a period when Greek, in the wake of Alexander&#x27;s conquests, was beginning to act as a lingua franca for the Eastern Mediterranean (replacing various Semitic languages). The accents were designed to assist in the pronunciation of Greek in older literary works.

==== Punctuation ====
He also invented one of the first forms of punctuation in BC: single dots (&quot;théseis&quot;, Latin &quot;distinctiones&quot;) that separated verses (colometry), and indicated the amount of breath needed to complete each fragment of text when reading aloud (not to comply with rules of grammar, which were not applied to punctuation marks until centuries later). For a short passage (a &quot;komma&quot;), a &quot;stigmḕ mésē&quot; dot was placed mid-level (·). This is the origin of the modern comma punctuation mark, and its name. For a longer passage (a &quot;kolon&quot;), a &quot;hypostigmḗ&quot; dot was placed level with the bottom of the text (.), similar to a modern colon or semicolon, and for very long pauses (&quot;periodos&quot;), a &quot;stigmḕ teleía&quot; point near the top of the line of text (·). He 
used a symbol resembling a for an obelus.

=== Lexicography ===
As a lexicographer he compiled collections of archaic and unusual words. Aristophanes chiefly devoted himself to the poets (especially Homer) who had already been edited by his master Zenodotus. He also edited Hesiod, the chief lyric, tragic and comic poets, arranged Plato&#x27;s dialogues in trilogies, and abridged Aristotle&#x27;s Nature of Animals. His arguments to the plays of Aristophanes and the tragedians are in great part preserved. As a lexicographer, Aristophanes compiled collections of foreign and unusual words and expressions, and special lists (words denoting relationship, modes of address). He also wrote a whole book on the proverbial moaning stick of Archilochus, but the one surviving fragment from this pertains to shellfish.

=== Surviving works ===
All that has survived of Aristophanes of Byzantium&#x27;s voluminous writings are a few fragments preserved through quotation in the literary commentaries, or &quot;scholia&quot;, of later writers, several &quot;argumenta&quot; to works of Greek drama, and part of a glossary. The most recent edition of the extant fragments was edited by William J. Slater.

<doc id="770489" wikidata="Q115683" url="?curid=770489" title="Michael Arlen">
<text>Michael Arlen (born Dikran Sarkis Kouyoumdjian;, , 16 November 1895 – 23 June 1956) was an essayist, short story writer, novelist, playwright, and scriptwriter. He had his greatest successes in the 1920s while living and writing in England, publishing the best-selling novel &quot;The Green Hat&quot; in 1924. Arlen is most famous for his satirical romances set in English smart society, but he also wrote gothic horror and psychological thrillers, for instance &quot;The Gentleman from America&quot;, which was filmed in 1948 as &quot;The Fatal Night&quot;, and again in 1956 as a television episode for Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s TV series &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. Near the end of his life, Arlen mainly occupied himself with political writing. Arlen&#x27;s vivid but colloquial style &quot;with unusual inversions and inflections with a heightened exotic pitch&quot; came to be known as &#x27;Arlenesque&#x27;.

Very much a 1920s society figure resembling the characters he portrayed in his novels, and a man who might be referred to as a dandy, Arlen invariably impressed everyone with his immaculate manners. He was always impeccably dressed and groomed, and was seen driving around London in a fashionable yellow Rolls-Royce and engaging in various luxurious activities. However, he was well aware of the latent suspicion of foreigners, mixed with the envy with which his success was viewed by some.

His works became an inspiration for famous Hollywood movies such as &quot;A Woman of Affairs&quot; (1928), starring Greta Garbo and John Gilbert; &quot;The Golden Arrow&quot; (1936), starring Bette Davis; and he was screenwriter of &quot;The Heavenly Body&quot; (1944), based on a story by Jacques Théry, starring William Powell and Hedy Lamarr.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Michael Arlen was born Dikran Sarkis Kouyoumdjian on 16 November 1895, in Ruse, Bulgaria, to an Armenian merchant family. In 1892, his family moved to Plovdiv, Bulgaria, after fleeing Turkish persecutions of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. In Plovdiv, Arlen&#x27;s father, Sarkis Kouyoumdjian, established a successful import business. In 1895, Arlen was born as the youngest child of five, having three brothers, Takvor, Krikor, and Roupen, and one sister, Ahavni. Arlen&#x27;s family moved once more: this time to the seaside town of Southport in Lancashire, England.

===Adolescence===
After studying at Malvern College and spending a brief time in Switzerland, the young Arlen enrolled as a medical student at the University of Edinburgh, despite his and his family&#x27;s intention that he attend the University of Oxford. If we are to view Arlen&#x27;s first published book, &quot;The London Venture&quot;, as being semi-autobiographical, then we will never know why Arlen made this &quot;silly mistake&quot; of going to Edinburgh instead of Oxford. We know however what led Arlen to London, where he would make his break into a literary career.

In &quot;The London Venture&quot;, Arlen wrote: &quot;I, up at Edinburgh, was on the high road to general fecklessness. I only stayed there a few months; jumbled months of elementary medicine, political economy, metaphysics, theosophy – I once handed round programmes at an Annie Besant lecture at the Usher Hall – and beer, lots of beer. And then, one night, I emptied my last mug, and with another side-glance at Oxford, came down to London; &#x27;to take up a literary career&#x27; my biographer will no doubt write of me.&quot; (p. 132)

In 1913, after a few months of university, Arlen moved to London to live by writing. A year later, the First World War broke out and made Arlen&#x27;s position in England as a Bulgarian national rather difficult. Arlen&#x27;s nationality was still Bulgarian, but Bulgaria had disowned him because he would not serve in Bulgaria&#x27;s army. Bulgaria being allies with Germany made England suspicious of Arlen, who could neither be naturalized as a British citizen, nor change his name. In London, Arlen found company in modernist literary circles with others who had been looked upon suspiciously or had been denied military service. Among these were Aldous Huxley, D. H. Lawrence, Nancy Cunard, and George Moore.

===Young adulthood===
Arlen began his literary career in 1916, writing under his birth name, Dikran Kouyoumdjian, firstly in a London-based Armenian periodical, &quot;&quot;, and soon afterward for &quot;The New Age&quot;, a British weekly review of politics, arts, and literature. For these two magazines, Arlen wrote essays, book reviews, personal essays, short stories, and even one short play.

His last submissions to &quot;The New Age&quot;, a series of semi-autobiographical personal essays entitled &quot;The London Papers&quot;, were assembled in 1920 and published with slight revisions as &quot;The London Venture&quot;. From this time onward he began to sign his works as &#x27;Michael Arlen&#x27;. In January and April 1920, he had already published two short stories in &quot;The English Review&quot; signed thus. He became naturalized as a British citizen in 1922, and legally changed from his birth name to Michael Arlen.

Arlen spent some time in France with Nancy Cunard in 1920, although she was married to someone else at the time; the relationship fuelled Aldous Huxley&#x27;s jealousy. During the 1920s, Arlen rented rooms opposite &#x27;The Grapes&#x27; public house in Shepherd Market, then a bohemian Mayfair address. He later used Shepherd Market as the setting for &quot;The Green Hat&quot;.

====Fame and fortune====
After &quot;The London Venture&quot;, Arlen worked on romances, spicing them with elements of psychological thrills and horror, including &quot;The Romantic Lady&quot;, &quot;These Charming People&quot;, and &quot;&quot;Piracy&quot;: A Romantic Chronicle of These Days&quot;. In &quot;These Charming People,&quot; for instance, Arlen wrote tales which included elements of fantasy and horror, in particular &quot;The Ancient Sin&quot; and &quot;The Loquacious Lady of Lansdowne Passage&quot;. The volume also introduced a &#x27;gentleman crook&#x27; reminiscent of Raffles. His identity is not entirely clear until the story &quot;Salute the Cavalier&quot;. The title of another story, &quot;When a Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square&quot;, was the inspiration for the popular song of the same name.

These works culminated in the book that would launch Arlen&#x27;s fame and fortune in the 1920s: &quot;The Green Hat&quot;, published in 1924. &quot;The Green Hat&quot; narrates the short life and violent death of Iris Storm, a &quot;femme fatale&quot; and dashing widow, the owner of a yellow Hispano-Suiza as well as the green hat of the title. Arlen adapted the novel for a 1925 Broadway play, starring Katharine Cornell and Leslie Howard in his most successful Broadway appearance to date. An almost simultaneous but less successful adaptation in London&#x27;s West End starred Tallulah Bankhead. The book figures in &quot;A Question of Upbringing&quot; by Anthony Powell as representative of life in Shepherd Market.

The novel was adapted for the silent 1928 Hollywood film &quot;A Woman of Affairs&quot; starring Greta Garbo and John Gilbert. &quot;The Green Hat&quot; was considered provocative in the United States; hence, the movie was not allowed to make any references to it. The film obscured or altered plot points in the novel concerning homosexuality and venereal disease. It was adapted a second time in 1934, as &quot;Outcast Lady&quot;, with Constance Bennett and Herbert Marshall in the main roles.

After the publication of &quot;The Green Hat&quot;, Arlen became almost instantly famous, rich, and as with celebrities today, incessantly in the spotlight and newspapers. During this period of his fame, the mid-1920s, Arlen frequently travelled to the United States and worked on plays and films, including &quot;Dear Father&quot; and &quot;These Charming People&quot;.

According to Noël Coward&#x27;s biographer Sheridan Morley, in 1924 Arlen rescued the play &quot;The Vortex&quot; by writing Coward a cheque for £250 when it seemed that otherwise the production would collapse (according to Coward himself—“Present Indicative,” p. 188–it was for £200). &quot;The Vortex&quot; made Coward&#x27;s name.

Naturally, after all this fame and attention, Arlen felt somewhat anxious to write the book that would follow &quot;The Green Hat&quot;. Notwithstanding, Arlen wrote &quot;Young Men in Love&quot; (1927) and received mixed reviews.

After &quot;Young Men in Love&quot;, Arlen continued with &quot;Lily Christine&quot; (1928), &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot; (1929), and &quot;Men Dislike Women&quot; (1931), none of which received the enthusiastic reviews that &quot;The Green Hat&quot; had received. Arlen also wrote a volume of &quot;Ghost Stories&quot; (1927), which were influenced by Saki, Oscar Wilde and Arthur Machen.

===Later life===

In 1927, Arlen, feeling ill, joined D. H. Lawrence in Florence, Italy. Lawrence was working on &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; and Arlen served as a model for the character Michaelis.

Arlen then moved to Cannes, France and, in 1928, married Countess Atalanta Mercati. They had two children, a son, Michael John Arlen born in 1930, and a daughter, Venetia Arlen, born in 1933.

With his following novel, &quot;Man&#x27;s Mortality&quot; (1933), Arlen turned to political writing and science fiction, brushing aside his earlier, smart society romances. Set fifty years in the future, in 1983, the book can be seen as portraying a Dystopia, whose rulers claim that it is a Utopia. Most critics compared it unfavourably with Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot;, which had been published the previous year.

In the following years, Arlen also returned to gothic horror with &quot;Hell! Said the Duchess: A Bed-Time Story&quot; (1934). In his final collection of short stories, &quot;The Crooked Coronet&quot; (1939), Arlen briefly returns to his earlier romantic, but also comic, style. Arlen&#x27;s claim to fame in the world of crime fiction rests on one short story, &quot;Gay Falcon&quot; (1940), in which he introduced gentleman sleuth Gay Stanhope Falcon. Renamed Gay Lawrence and nicknamed &#x27;the Falcon&#x27;, the character was taken up by Hollywood in 1941, and expanded into a series of mystery films with George Sanders in the title role. When Sanders left the role, he was succeeded by his brother Tom Conway, who played Gay Lawrence&#x27;s brother Tom and also used the nickname &#x27;the Falcon&#x27;.

In 1939, when the Second World War began, Arlen returned to England. While his wife, Atalanta, joined the Red Cross, Arlen wrote columns for &quot;The Tatler&quot;. That same year, his final book, &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot; (1939), was published, a political novel, commenting harshly on Germany&#x27;s position in the war.

In 1940, Arlen was appointed Civil Defence Public Relations Officer for the East Midlands, but when his loyalty to England was questioned in the House of Commons in 1941, he resigned and moved to America, where he settled in New York in 1946. For the next ten years of his life, Arlen suffered from writer&#x27;s block. 

He died of cancer on June 23, 1956, in New York.

==Critical reception==
Horror writer Karl Edward Wagner included &quot;Hell! Said the Duchess&quot; on his list of &quot;The Thirteen Best Supernatural Horror Novels&quot; in the May 1983 issue of &quot;The Twilight Zone Magazine&quot;. F. Scott Fitzgerald was an admirer of Arlen&#x27;s work. In &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot;, Ernest Hemingway recounts how, as he and Fitzgerald were sharing a long car journey to Paris, Fitzgerald told him the plots of all Arlen&#x27;s books, concluding that the author was &quot;the man you had to watch&quot;.

<text>Formigas Islets ( ; literally, &quot;Islets of the Ants&quot;), sometimes referred to as the Formigas Bank, are a group of uninhabited rocky outcroppings in the eastern group of the Azores archipelago, an autonomous region of Portugal. The bank is located northeast of Santa Maria and southeast of São Miguel, covering a surface area of approximately . The submerged Dollabarat Reef is in the same area. The only structure on the islets is a lighthouse located on Formigão (&quot;Big Ant&quot;), the largest islet.

==History==

The Formigas were discovered by Portuguese explorers Diogo de Silves and Gonçalo Velho Cabral in 1431 during their journey to Madeira. The islets were neglected due to the contemporaneous discovery of the neighboring inhabitable islands of Santa Maria and São Miguel. In the 16th century, Portuguese chronicler Gaspar Frutuoso reported on the Formigas&#x27; rich marine life.

The Formigas served as both an aid and hindrance to navigation from their discovery well into the 20th century. On 8 April 1832, the British ship &quot;Zyllah&quot; wrecked on a subsurface rock at the Formigas and its crew had to be rescued the next day by the British merchantman &quot;Morley&quot;. Nearly ninety years later on 16 June 1921, the Greek cargo ship &quot;Olympia&quot; ran aground and wrecked at Formigas; the crew survived.

The islets have long garnered scientific and commercial interest. In 1886, the Italian ship &quot;Corsaro&quot; visited the Formigas Islets, dredging the area for the first time for scientific research purposes. Prince Albert I of Monaco&#x27;s &quot;Princess Alice&quot; expedition also visited the islets in 1895 to investigate the marine life, for both scientific and commercial fishery purposes.

Since 4 April 1988, the Formigas Bank has the status of Nature Reserve and is protected by a decree of the Legislative Assembly of the Azores (Regional Legislative Decree Nº11/88/A). It is also considered a European Site of Community Importance (Rede Natura 2000). The habitats protected by the Azorean decree include the area from the emerged islets to depths of more than , yet this has not stopped incidents of commercial fishing. Consequently, the area is regularly patrolled by a Portuguese naval vessel based in Ponta Delgada.

Since 16 June 2008, the Formigas Islets and neighboring Dollabarat Reef have been recognized as a Ramsar Convention wetland under the name &quot;Ilhéus das Formigas e Recife Dollabarat&quot;.

===Formigas Lighthouse===
The Formigas Lighthouse () is located on Formigão, the largest islet of the Formigas. The current beacon is a stone tower painted white. As the base of the tower is at an elevation of about above sea level, the beacon is at above sea level. The lighthouse&#x27;s signal is visible from away on clear days, although there have been reports of seeing it from the southeastern part of São Miguel and the northeastern part of Santa Maria. In rough seas, waves completely immerse the tower.

As early as 1883 the Portuguese government formally recognized the dangers posed by the Formigas to navigation and proposed building a lighthouse on the islets, but nothing was constructed at the time. On 2 March 1895, at the General Meeting of the Autonomous District of Ponta Delgada, the District initiated construction of lighthouses on São Miguel and Santa Maria. Because of this, and also due to the technical difficulties of building a lighthouse in that era in a place so inhospitable as the Formigas, construction of a lighthouse on the islets themselves was further delayed.

Finally, in the summer of 1948 the Portuguese government began a complex operation to build a lighthouse on Formigão. In order to land personnel and equipment on the islet, the workers first had to break away subsurface rocks and build a wharf. Despite various interruptions to the work due to rough seas and inclement weather, in 36 days the workers managed to build a small beacon. In 1962, the Portuguese Navy&#x27;s lightship &quot;NRP Almirante Schultz&quot; anchored at the Formigas and was used as a work base for renovating and modernizing the lighthouse. In the succeeding years the lighthouse was further modernized; the beacon now runs on solar power and its old acetylene lamp has been replaced with a newer model.

==Geography==

The islets are composed of basalt flows that occurred approximately 4 million years ago, although calcareous fossiliferous sediments dating to 4-6 million years ago have been discovered. The bank extends for from northwest to southeast and is wide. Due to strong currents and frequent large swells, the linear rock outcroppings lack any terrestrial flora or fauna. Along the archipelago&#x27;s perimeter, the seabed drops steeply to a depth of on either side, and gently at the northern and southern tips. The area of the bank referred to as the Dollabarat Reef is an area of shallower gradient, situated along the southwest of the Formigas Islets.

&quot;Formigas&quot; is Portuguese for ants, as the small and dispersed rocks resemble scattered ants. The largest islet Formigão has a maximum altitude of above sea level. Generally the islets are useful for navigation and visible up to away on clear days, but during inclement weather a ship can run aground on the rocks without even seeing the lighthouse.

===Biome===
The Formigas Bank is essentially a submarine volcano inhabited by deep-dwelling marine species such as coral and sponges. The volcanic cone is delimited approximately by the Formigas islets of the northwest and Dollabarat Reef to the southeast. In the ancient crater there is a rich community of species common to the Azores. Among the species typical of the area are wrasse (Mediterranean rainbow wrasse and ornate wrasse), damselfish, sergeant fish (yellow and black), grouper, Mediterranean parrotfish, and the emblematic Atlantic goliath grouper, serranidae and barred hogfish. Alongside these are African threadfish and longbill spearfish, pelagic predators that also reside in the bank, and migratory species like manta ray and whale shark.

The base and surface of the volcano is covered in various types of black coral, soft corals, sponges, and other invertebrates, as well as various algae, forming a mosaic of micro-habitats. The geological differences of the Formigas Islets and Dollabarat Reef relative to the rest of the Azores are accentuated by the types of flora present there. The Formigas and Dollabarat both have an elevated biomass of brown algae considered unique to the Azores; the fields of kelp are situated between and below the crater at the Formigas, while at Dollabarat the brown algae is located along the reef&#x27;s flanks.

<text>The urethral sponge is a spongy cushion of tissue, found in the lower genital area of females, that sits against both the pubic bone and vaginal wall, and surrounds the urethra.

==Functions==
The urethral sponge is composed of erectile tissue; during arousal, it becomes swollen with blood, compressing the urethra, helping, along with the pubococcygeus muscle, to prevent urination during sexual activity.

===Female ejaculation===

Additionally, the urethral sponge contains the Skene&#x27;s glands, which may be involved in female ejaculation.

===Sexual stimulation===
The urethral sponge encompasses sensitive nerve endings, and can be stimulated through the front wall of the vagina. Some women experience intense pleasure from stimulation of the urethral sponge and others find the sensation irritating. The urethral sponge surrounds the clitoral nerve, and since the two are so closely interconnected, stimulation of the clitoris may stimulate the nerve endings of the urethral sponge and vice versa. Some women enjoy the rear-entry position of sexual intercourse for this reason, because the penis is often angled slightly downward and can stimulate the front wall of the vagina, and in turn the urethral sponge.

===Relation with the G-spot===

The urethral sponge is an area in which the G-spot (Gräfenberg Spot) may be found. Although the G-spot may exist, it has been doubted by various researchers. A team at The King&#x27;s College in London, the biggest study on the G-spot&#x27;s existence thus far, and involving 1,800 women, found no proof that the G-spot exists. The authors of the study concluded that the &quot;G-spot&quot; may be a figment of people&#x27;s imagination, which has been encouraged by magazines, sex therapists and suggestive therapeutics. Other studies, using ultrasound, have found physiological evidence of the G-spot in women who report having orgasms during intercourse.

<text>Squirrel and G-Man Twenty Four Hour Party People Plastic Face Carnt Smile (White Out) is the debut studio album by the English rock band Happy Mondays, which was released in mid-April 1987 by Factory Records. After finalising their line-up, the band began playing local venues in Manchester, toured with New Order, and released an EP and a single in 1985. Happy Mondays&#x27; debut album was recorded at Fire House in London in December 1986 with producer John Cale. Halfway through the two weeks of sessions, they scrapped all their recordings and began again. Cale and engineer Dave Young did not understand the band members&#x27; vision of the album, and found them difficult to work with. Deemed a punk-funk and post-punk album, most of its songs were lyrically akin to stories on &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

&quot;Squirrel and G-Man Twenty Four Hour Party People Plastic Face Carnt Smile (White Out)&quot; received generally-positive reviews from music critics; some liked Happy Mondays&#x27; musicianship, and others were indifferent about Cale&#x27;s production. The album sold 3,500 copies within six months of release, and &quot;Tart Tart&quot; was released as its lead single in March 1987. It gave the band national exposure when its music video was played on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Chart Show&quot;. Over the next five months, Happy Mondays headlined shows and supported a number of bands; the most notable were two dates supporting New Order, one of which was an all-day benefit hosted by Factory Records. &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single in October 1987.

==Background==
At age 16, Shaun Ryder left school in 1978 and found a job with his father at a post office. Two years later, he formed a band with his brother Paul Ryder on bass, their cousin Matt Carroll on guitar, and the Ryders&#x27; father&#x27;s drum machine. Paul joined his brother at the post office after finishing his education. Mark Day began working at the post office in 1981, and quickly joined the band on guitar. When they were rehearsing in Day&#x27;s attic by early 1982, they called themselves Something in the Attic. Carroll left after a few more rehearsals, after naming the band Avant-Garde. Shaun learned about drummer Gary Whelan through his fiancé&#x27;s sister; she and Day separately asked Whelan to join them. By the end of 1982, the band – now named Penguin Dice – were writing original material. Their name was changed to Happy Laws in early 1983, and eventually to Happy Mondays.

The band talked about Whelan&#x27;s schoolmate, Paul Davis, whom Shaun Ryder saw around the neighbourhood. Davis attended a few rehearsals before joining the band on keyboards. After meeting them at a club, Phil Saxe became the band&#x27;s manager. Over the next 18 months, the band performed at venues across Manchester such as the Boardwalk and the International and supported New Order on the last date of their United Kingdom tour in January 1985. Saxe met Mike Pickering, who was working in A&amp;R for Factory Records, and told him about Happy Mondays. Factory founder Tony Wilson and directors Rob Gretton and Alan Erasmus saw the band at the Haçienda, and were impressed. Happy Mondays released their debut EP, &quot;Forty Five EP&quot; (produced by Pickering), on Factory in September 1985.

Happy Mondays met Mark &quot;Bez&quot; Berry through their mutual friend, Little Mini; Bez had attended school with Davis, Day and Whelan. At the band&#x27;s next gig, Bez was invited to dance on stage because Shaun Ryder had a bad acid trip earlier that evening. The latter befriended Terry Hall, whom he knew from Hall&#x27;s work with the Specials and Fun Boy Three. Ryder and the rest of Happy Mondays (with Bez in tow) supported Hall on tour with his newest outfit, the Colourfield, studying the band&#x27;s stage presence in an attempt to improve their own. Happy Mondays&#x27; next single, the Bernard Sumner-produced &quot;Freaky Dancin, was released in June 1986. It had wah-wah guitar over a backbeat, which could potentially become the band&#x27;s core sound. During a promotional shoot while producing the song, Bez graduated from being the band&#x27;s friend to becoming their percussionist and dancer.

==Recording==
Vini Reilly of Happy Mondays&#x27; labelmates, the Durutti Column, was touted as the producer of the band&#x27;s upcoming debut album. Happy Mondays, however, wanted to enlist Sumner again; he took a temporary break from producing to focus on New Order&#x27;s &quot;Brotherhood&quot; (1986). Sumner had worked on remixes for other acts, and mixed &quot;From the Hip&quot; (1984) by Section 25; both projects were too energy-consuming, and he felt that his efforts were best spent working with New Order. Sumner was also concerned that he would accidentally make Happy Mondays sound closer in style to New Order. Wilson, who had shifted his focus to new signees the Railway Children and Miaow, suggested Reilly despite reservations about Happy Mondays&#x27; debut. Reilly met the band; he was dismayed by their attitude, and criticised Day&#x27;s guitar playing. Shaun Ryder said that he was initially brought in to produce &quot;Freaky Dancin before Sumner, but &quot;only lasted about two hours before he decided he couldn&#x27;t handle us&quot;. Wilson searched through his record collection to find a suitable producer for Happy Mondays&#x27; debut album. After comparing Ryder&#x27;s lyrics with those by Patti Smith, Wilson thought of John Cale, who had produced Smith and was a member of the Velvet Underground.

Wilson theorised that if the album sold poorly after release, it would be ensured steady sales in the years that followed by having Cale&#x27;s name attached to it. Saxe saw Happy Mondays as Manchester&#x27;s answer to New York&#x27;s Velvet Underground. Concerned that Wilson would not accept Cale as the producer, Saxe asked Sumner to suggest Cale on his behalf. Wilson knew Cale, because he had appeared on Wilson&#x27;s &quot;So It Goes&quot; programme for Granada Television. Happy Mondays recorded at Fire House in London over two weeks in December 1986. Cale picked the studio because he had been in a band with its owner, Dave Young. The sessions cost £6,000 and were produced by Cale; Young was the engineer, with assistance from Zuni and Andy Kelly.

Factory set Happy Mondays up in a Belsize Park house, with the band living in one room and electricians and builders living in the other rooms. Day was the only band member with a full-time job by this point, and could afford food; the others resorted to theft. The first two days consisted of playing songs for Cale, who was impressed with Day&#x27;s skills. After the first week, they scrapped their efforts and began again. Young was bewildered by the band&#x27;s performances, saying that its members did not seem to know what they were playing much of the time. Cale found it difficult to work with Shaun Ryder; he liked his voice, but was unable to follow the lyrics. Ryder wrote them on pieces of scrap paper before discarding them, leaving Cale unable to see if they could be improved. Many of his vocals included ad-libs (making it difficult to re-do a specific line), and Ryder said that he had forgotten what he sang moments before.

The band wanted to make a rap version of &quot;Little Matchstick Owen&quot; after recording it, and Pickering suggested enlisting London-based Three Wise Men. The studio&#x27;s window cleaner said that he could rap, however, to the band&#x27;s surprise of the band. Mike Bleach then rapped over this new version, which was renamed &quot;Little Matchstick Owen&#x27;s Rap&quot;. Wilson regretted using Cale, because he &quot;didn&#x27;t have a fucking clue what was going on&quot; and did not understand the band or their vision of the album. Shaun Ryder was the only band member who was aware of Cale&#x27;s previous work, and did not want to waste &quot;weeks in some studio grafting away, fuck that&quot;. Wilson attempted to visit the band during recording, but was unable to find the studio. He regretted this, since he was disappointed with the final recordings and &quot;stunned by how incredibly lame the songs were&quot;; they &quot;sounded really thin and amateur&quot;. Ryder said that Cale captured their live sound &quot;pretty much&quot;, and &quot;didn&#x27;t do much&quot; to enhance their performances. Cale was struggling with sobriety, and ate tangerines as a result; the band complained that all he would do was sit around and eat the fruit.

==Composition and lyrics==
===Overview===
The sound of &quot;Squirrel and G-Man Twenty Four Hour Party People Plastic Face Carnt Smile (White Out)&quot; has been described as mixing the punk-funk of ESG with the atmosphere of Joy Division. &quot;Classic Pop Mag&quot; described its sound as &quot;rough-around-the-edges funky post-punk.&quot; In his biography of the band, &quot;Shaun Ryder: Happy Mondays, Black Grape &amp; Other Traumas&quot;, Mick Middles referred to album as &quot;a thousand nights, drunk on funk, dull thuds and a wandering bass, [with] a wholly intoxicated... sound&quot;. It has many characteristics which would be developed on the band&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Bummed&quot; (1988), such as Shaun Ryder&#x27;s seemingly-nonsensical lyrics combined with funk rhythms. Ryder said that house music was seeping into club nights, although the band was unable to bring that influence into their songs because they were insufficiently competent. He attributed the pauses in the songs to attempts to emulate the music of the Doors. In hindsight, he said that it could be viewed as latter-day indie rock: &quot;At the time, indie [rock] meant, tight, fast, neat music&quot; while the band sought to have a &quot;really spacious, trippy sound&quot;. 

During their live performances, the band would unintentionally play songs longer than necessary; Shaun Ryder said that they &quot;could never get the timing right to end a song together&quot;. He freestyled lyrics over these extended versions, and new songs would evolve from the freestyles. They recorded the shows, and worked on material during practice sessions. The album&#x27;s title is partially the result of Little Mini. He visited them, took one look, and exclaimed: &quot;Fucking hell, twenty-four hour party people, plastic people smile a white out...&quot; The full title had a number of references; &quot;Squirrel&quot; is the nickname of Davis&#x27; mother, &quot;G-Man&quot; alludes to Bez&#x27;s father being a police officer, &quot;Twenty Four Hour Party People&quot; is a synonym for the band, and &quot;Plastic Face&quot; and &quot;Carnt Smile&quot; were two truncated Salford expressions meaning &quot;miserable bastards&quot;. Ryder considered the sentence a joke before liking the sound of it as an album title, which &quot;[k]ind of summed the whole thing up&quot;.

===Songs===
Shaun Ryder said that most of the lyrics were crafted &quot;like short stories from &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;&quot;. The title of &quot;Kuff Dam&quot; comes from a pornographic magazine, &quot;Mad Fuck&quot;, which Ryder had read years earlier and decided to spell the name backwards. Ryder saw it as an attempt to find his voice, something he felt more important than trying to fit a story into a song. &quot;Tart Tart&quot; is partially inspired by a girl, Dinah, who dealt drugs and gave Bez and Ryder a place to stay. A couple of lines address her death, which resulted from a brain hemorrhage. The song is also about the UK AIDS crisis and Martin Hannett. Ryder had not met Hannett, but Sumner told stories about him. Enery&quot; tackles sexually-transmitted diseases, of which Ryder was aware through friends.

The drums in &quot;Russell&quot; recall those in &quot;Movement&quot;-era (1981) New Order. Its lyrics are taken verbatim from the blurb of Russell Grant&#x27;s book, &quot;Your Sun Signs&quot;. Whelan said that Shaun Ryder saw the book at the Boardwalk and began reading its back cover aloud. &quot;Olive Oil&quot; has been compared to fellow Manchester band the Smiths. Its title was inspired by a girl the band knew who had large eyes and feet. The jangly guitar work in &quot;Weekend S&quot; is reminiscent of the indie scene at the time, and its name was shortened from &quot;The Weekend Starts Here&quot;. The song is based on Ryder&#x27;s visits to Manchester clubs and bars during the early 1980s. Paul Ryder copied the bass line in Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;Got to Give It Up&quot; (1977) for &quot;Little Matchstick Owen&quot;, which was named after Welsh boxer Johnny Owen.

&quot;Oasis&quot; originated from a jam session in Whelan&#x27;s bedroom, and is named after a city market at which his friend worked. An earlier version had appeared on the &quot;Forty Five EP&quot; two years before, with lyrics from &quot;It&#x27;s Not Unusual&quot; (1965) by Tom Jones which were omitted from the album. &quot;Desmond&quot; has a melody similar to &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot; (1968) by the Beatles. The song is about a character known as &quot;Eddie the Breakdancer&quot;; Whelan disliked it, feeling that the band did not perfect it in the studio. &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; deals with people on the dole who prefer partying to looking for work. Shaun Ryder felt that he found his voice with the song, instead of writing what others expected him to. The introduction of &quot;Cob 20&quot;, the closing track, evokes the Cure. Its title refers to a school friend of the Ryders who would ride his sister&#x27;s Raleigh Twenty bicycle.

==Release==
Happy Mondays began 1987 with two shows in Manchester and London in January and February, respectively. &quot;Tart Tart&quot; was released as the lead single from their forthcoming album on 12&quot; vinyl, with &quot;Little Matchstick Owen&#x27;s Rap&quot; as the B-side, in March of that year. In his 2006 book, &quot;Factory Records: The Complete Graphic Album&quot;, Matthew Robertson wrote that the &quot;intensely acidic colour background&quot; of the artwork was adapted from a TV screen as its &quot;horizontal emphasis evokes a sense of landscape&quot;, and the &quot;overlaid painted sections&quot; are a response to its music &quot;in an attempt to capture an essence of frustration&quot;. In the music video for &quot;Tart Tart&quot;, filmed at Strawberry Studios, Shaun Ryder&#x27;s lip-synching is imposed over footage of the other band members in winter scenery. Happy Mondays received national exposure for the first time when the video was played on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Chart Show&quot;.

&quot;Squirrel and G-Man Twenty Four Hour Party People Plastic Face Carnt Smile (White Out)&quot; was released by Factory Records in mid-April 1987. Its initial vinyl version had a removable PVC sleeve with the band&#x27;s name and the album&#x27;s title in large, bold letters. Central Station Design (who created the artwork) suggested this sleeve, anticipating pushback from the label over its cost. The cover had an array of cakes and trifles, and the back cover had a tray of fish. Robertson said that the two images &quot;suggest the humorous and hyperactive temperament&quot; of the band members. Iain Ellis of &quot;PopMatters&quot; said that Central Station Design &quot;introduce a spot-effects technique into the background&quot;, evoking the work of Roy Lichtenstein.

The first 3,000 copies of &quot;Squirrel and G-Man Twenty Four Hour Party People Plastic Face Carnt Smile (White Out)&quot; were released with &quot;Desmond&quot;, which received attention for the song&#x27;s similarity to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot;. Factory received a writ from lawyers for Michael Jackson, who owned Northern Songs (the Beatles&#x27; music publisher). Saxe said that they had received authorization for the melody by telephone; Factory promised to destroy all copies with the song, but did not do so. They drafted Young to quickly record the replacement track, &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot;, at Suite Sixteen Studios in Rochdale, and the album was re-released on 5 May 1987. Happy Mondays toured the UK in April and May of that year with a mixture of headlining shows and supporting slots for the Fall, the Farm and the Weather Prophets.

The band supported New Order at an all-day benefit show in London organised by Factory on 6 June 1987, and supported them again three days later in Glasgow. They flew to the United States to appear at a showcase gig run by Wilson in New York City on 15 July 1989. It was played in the midst of a city-wide New Music Seminar in an attempt to secure licensing deals for the band&#x27;s releases in North America. Factory released the sampler album &quot;Young, Popular &amp; Sexy&quot; with &quot;Kuff Dam&quot; after New Order&#x27;s commercial breakthrough in the US. The show went poorly, with several members becoming ill; the equipment they hired did not show up, and the gear they could find did not work properly. A handful of headlining shows followed in July and August 1987.

&quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; was released as the second single from &quot;Squirrel and G-Man Twenty Four Hour Party People Plastic Face Carnt Smile (White Out)&quot; on 12 October 1987 on 12&quot; vinyl, with &quot;Yahoo&quot; and &quot;Wah Wah (Think Tank)&quot; its B-sides. Factory took on two film-makers, Keith Jobling and Phil Sotton, who were known as the Bailey Brothers; they had worked on videos for the Smiths album, &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; (1986). Tony Wilson saw Happy Mondays live with the duo, telling them that he wanted to make a music video for &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot;. The Bailey Brothers were impressed with the band&#x27;s performance, and signed up for the task. They filmed the band driving an Oldsmobile in Ancoats, with footage from a passenger&#x27;s perspective filmed later. The single was promoted with a UK tour that month, their first headlining tour in the country. Happy Mondays ended 1987 with two shows at Warrington and Manchester in December. They played four shows in 1988: a supporting slot for Stump in February and three headlining shows in May.

===Reissues and related releases===
&quot;Squirrel and G-Man Twenty Four Hour Party People Plastic Face Carnt Smile (White Out)&quot; was released on CD in 1990, and was reissued in 2000 by London Recordings. It was part of Rhino Records&#x27; &quot;Original Album Series&quot; box set in 2013, which collected the band&#x27;s first four studio albums. The album was reissued on vinyl in 2020. &quot;Tart Tart&quot; and &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; were reissued on vinyl in 2019 as part of the band&#x27;s &quot;The Early EPs&quot; compilation. After Paul Ryder&#x27;s death in July 2022, Whelan&#x27;s brother Jase suggested that &quot;Tart Tart&quot; could be reissued to honour him. On 28 July 2022, &quot;Tart Tart&quot; was released as a single with the album version, a BBC version and a live version as its B-sides. Its profits were donated to MusiCares, an organization which helps people in the music industry who are dealing with addiction.

&quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; appeared alone on Happy Mondays&#x27; first and third compilation albums, &quot;Double Easy – The U.S. Singles&quot; (1993) and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (1999). &quot;Kuff Dam&quot;, &quot;Tart Tart&quot; and &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; were included on their second compilation album, &quot;Loads&quot; (1995). &quot;Tart Tart&quot; and &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; are on the band&#x27;s fourth compilation album, &quot;The Platinum Collection&quot; (2005). &quot;Olive Oil&quot; and &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; were included on their fifth compilation album, &quot;Double Double Good: The Best of Happy Mondays&quot; (2012).

==Reception==

&quot;Squirrel and G-Man Twenty Four Hour Party People Plastic Face Carnt Smile (White Out)&quot; received generally-positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic reviewer Ned Raggett said that Cale managed to &quot;capture the cluttering mess&quot; of Happy Mondays&#x27; &quot;approach well enough&quot;; author Dave Thompson, in his book &quot;Alternative Rock&quot; (2000), noted Cale&#x27;s &quot;manic production&quot;. &quot;Sounds&quot; writer Ron Rom said that the album was &quot;full of bitter disdain and sardonic, esoteric arrogance,&quot; with Cale&#x27;s &quot;unremarkable production&quot; doing &quot;little to cut through the gloom&quot;. He added that the band &quot;hit hard... and they rarely miss&quot; with &quot;[s]cruffy council estate vocals&quot; from Shaun Ryder. &quot;The Observer&quot; John Savage called the album the &quot;finest flowering to date&quot; of any Manchester act.

&quot;Melody Maker&quot; reviewer Paul Mathur called Shaun Ryder&#x27;s lyrics a &quot;source of haphazardly magical beauty, mixing bluntness and oblique suggestion with a certain shuffled cliche&quot;. &quot;Record Mirror&quot; writer Nancy Culp said that his lyrics &quot;come across as the most bleak and hopeless this side of a Cure record&quot;; &quot;putting aside the fact that you feel like wrenching the damn record off after three tracks,&quot; the album had &quot;something curiously addictive&quot;. Andy Darling of &quot;City Limits&quot; wrote that the songs would sound &quot;great live&quot;, however, &quot;on record it fails&quot;. &quot;Trouser Press&quot; reviewers Doug Brod and Michael Krugman called the album &quot;unimaginative&quot; and &quot;often unlistenable&quot;, with &quot;no apparent flourishes&quot; from Cale.

&quot;Squirrel and G-Man Twenty Four Hour Party People Plastic Face Carnt Smile (White Out)&quot; peaked at number four on the UK Independent Albums Chart. &quot;Tart Tart&quot; peaked at number 13 on the Independent Singles Chart, and &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; reached number ten. Ten thousand copies of the album were pressed, although only 3,500 were sold within six months of release. The Railway Children had moved to Virgin Records and Miaow had broken up by this point, and Wilson saw no commercial potential in Happy Mondays. By the end of 1987, the album had sold 5,000 copies. Although the band had success in the media, it did not translate into sales. Shaun Ryder said, &quot;I thought that [the positive attention from music publications] meant loads of money would come in, but it meant absolutely fuck all&quot;.

&quot;PopMatters&quot; listed &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; at 92nd on their list of 100 Best Alternative Singles of the 1980s. The track lent its name to the film &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; (2002), a fictional retelling of the band&#x27;s history with Factory Records and the label&#x27;s other acts. A remix of &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; by Jon Carter, released on 12-inch vinyl in May 2002 to coincide with the film, charted in the UK at number 97.

<doc id="770517" wikidata="Q4992107" url="?curid=770517" title="Supreme Court of Hawaii">
<text>The Supreme Court of Hawaii is the highest court of the State of Hawaii in the United States. Its decisions are binding on all other courts of the Hawaii State Judiciary. The principal purpose of the Supreme Court is to review the decisions of the trial courts in which appeals have been granted. Appeals are decided by the members of the Supreme Court based on written records and in some cases may grant oral arguments in the main Supreme Court chamber. Like its mainland United States counterparts, the Supreme Court does not take evidence and uses only evidence provided in previous trials.

The Supreme Court of Hawaii meets in Aliiōlani Hale in Honolulu.

==History==

The case law reported in &quot;Hawaiian Reports&quot; dates back to January 1847 and the reign of Kamehameha III, long before Hawaii was annexed by the United States in 1898. (Early Hawaiian cases were originally reported in &quot;The Polynesian&quot;.) 

Kamehemeha III sought to modernize the Hawaiian Kingdom by rapidly transitioning from indigenous traditions to a new legal system based on Anglo-American common law. Hawaii is one of the rare examples of an indigenous polity which voluntarily adopted the common law (albeit as part of the larger objective of avoiding annexation by larger colonial powers), in contrast to the common law&#x27;s coercive imposition elsewhere by English-speaking colonists.

==Functions==
The Hawaii State Supreme Court has original jurisdiction to answer questions of law that have been passed to it from trial courts or the federal court, hear civil cases submitted to the Supreme Court on agreed statements of facts, and decide questions coming from proceedings of writs of mandamus, prohibition, and habeas corpus.

==Justices==

The Supreme Court consists of five justices who are initially appointed to ten-year terms by the Governor of Hawaii, who makes their nomination from a list of four to six candidates from the Hawaii Judicial Selection Commission. The Governor&#x27;s nominee is subject to confirmation by the Hawaii State Senate. Candidates must be U.S. citizens, Hawaii residents, and have been licensed to practice law for at least 10 years prior to nomination. The Judicial Selection Commission can opt to retain incumbent justices for additional ten-year terms. All justices must retire at 70 years of age.

As of , the justices are:

<doc id="770520" wikidata="Q7364392" url="?curid=770520" title="Ron Sims">
<text>Ronald Cordell Sims (born July 5, 1948) is the former deputy secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, having served in the position from May 8, 2009 to July 2011. He is also a former King County executive. Sims ran unsuccessfully for higher office twice: United States senator in 1994 and governor of Washington in 2004.

==Early life==
Sims was born in Spokane, Washington, to Reverend James C. Sims Sr. and Lydia T. Sims. He graduated from Lewis and Clark High School and attended Central Washington University in Ellensburg, where he earned a B.A. in psychology. Between graduation and his election to the King County Council he worked in the office of the Washington State Attorney General, for the Federal Trade Commission, for the juvenile offenders program of the city of Seattle, and as an aide in the state senate. He is an ordained Baptist minister.

==Political career==

In 1985, Sims was elected to the King County Council, being reelected in 1989 and 1993. During his first term, he and fellow Councilman Bruce Laing led a campaign that saw the county rededicate its name, in 1986, to honor Martin Luther King Jr., rather than original namesake and slaveowner William R. King, who had been elected as Vice President of the United States just prior to the 1852 creation of the county. (The namesake change was legally enshrined by Washington state in 2005.)

In 1994, he was defeated by Republican incumbent Slade Gorton in an election for the United States Senate.

In 1996, he was appointed King County Executive after the previous holder of the office, Gary Locke, was elected governor of Washington. He was re-elected in 1997, 2001 and 2005.

On July 29, 2003, he announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for Washington state governor in the 2004 election. Sims made news in the campaign when he proposed replacing the state sales tax and business and occupation tax with a progressively graduated income tax. In the primary election held on September 14, 2004, Sims lost to state Attorney General Christine Gregoire.

On February 2, 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Sims to become Deputy Secretary of the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, being confirmed by the United States Senate on May 6, 2009 and sworn in on May 8, 2009 

On June 14, 2011, less than two years after accepting his HUD appointment, Sims announced his resignation and intent to return to Seattle, citing a desire to spend more time with his family. Sims&#x27; announcement followed the release of official travel records to Americans for Limited Government that showed Sims had spent 45 of 128 travel days during his tenure on trips to Seattle, a statistic that the group said raised &quot;questions about the legitimacy of these trips.&quot; A HUD spokesperson responded that the trips were legal and appropriate, noting that &quot;every trip taken by Deputy Secretary Ron Sims was in response to a formal speech or forum participation request.&quot;

==King County issues==

===Brightwater sewage treatment plant===

The Brightwater sewage treatment plant built by King County across the county line in neighboring Snohomish County caused a number of issues, including a lawsuit between the counties over impact mitigation; cost overruns; and concerns over earthquake fault lines running through the site.

===Tent City 4===
On April 29, 2004, Sims announced his intention to temporarily locate a tent city on county-owned land near Bothell, Washington and gave the King County Council 90 days to determine a more permanent location within the county for the tent city to be located. Opponents of the plan filed a lawsuit that resulted in the move being cancelled. In May 2005, the council voted to have a one-year moratorium prohibiting the siting of homeless encampments on public land pending a review of the availability, suitability, and appropriateness of using county-owned land. Sims never conducted this review, and the moratorium remains in place, but the homeless encampment is currently moving from church property to church property throughout east King County.

===Critical Area Ordinance===
On October 26, 2004, the King County Council passed the controversial Critical Area Ordinance (CAO) to protect environmentally sensitive areas (such as wetlands and streams) and restrict development in hazardous areas (such as floodplains and landslide prone steep slopes). The plan drew the ire of many property rights groups, rural landowners, and developers as the ordinance prevented land owners from developing areas of their property that met the critical area definition. This included a requirement that landowners in rural areas that haven&#x27;t already cleared their land must keep 50% to 65% of their property in its &quot;natural state&quot;. Three referendums to repeal the ordinance gathered over 17,000 signatures each, far more than the 6,900 required to qualify to be on the ballot. However, a lawsuit filed by King County and a pro-growth management group prevented the referendum from being put on the ballot, and the state Supreme Court ruled that a state law requiring local governments to protect critical areas prevented local referendums from overturning critical area ordinances.
On July 7, 2008, a Washington State Appeals Court found that the portion of the CAO known as the clearing and grading ordinance is an indirect and illegal &quot;tax, fee, or charge&quot;, and that prior to restricting the clearing of land for lawn or pasture, King County must demonstrate how that act could cause harm.

===Rails to trails proposal===

On May 16, 2005, Sims announced a controversial plan to purchase the Woodinville Subdivision railroad that runs through the east King County roughly parallel to Interstate 405 and replace most of its track with a bicycle trail. Although there is support for purchasing the railroad in order to prevent its current owner, BNSF Railway, from selling off the right of way piecemeal, the plan to remove the tracks has raised concerns from rail transportation advocates, environmental groups, and the owners, employees and customers of the popular Spirit of Washington dinner train (which ran on the tracks). It has also resulted in the formation of a grassroots movement, Eastside Rail Now!, which is aimed at stopping the removal of the tracks and at using them to begin a rail transit service in addition to their current freight and dinner train functions. In 2007, the Port of Seattle, King County, and BNSF signed a preliminary agreement in which the Port would purchase the rail line from BNSF and then exchange the line plus $66 million to pay for removal of the tracks and replacement by a bicycle trail for Boeing Field

===Boeing Field airlines proposal===
In July 2005, Southwest Airlines formally proposed plans to spend $130 million on a passenger terminal and other facilities and move the airline&#x27;s operation from Sea-Tac Airport to Boeing Field after several months of negotiations with Sims. The proposal from Southwest prompted Alaska Airlines to announce it would seek a similar agreement with the county. The proposals were met with opposition from residents of Georgetown, the Seattle neighborhood north of Boeing Field, many of Washington&#x27;s state and federal legislators, and the Seattle Chamber of Commerce. After months of pressure from the opposition, Sims killed Southwest&#x27;s and Alaska&#x27;s proposals in October 2005, stating that while the area around Boeing Field might have been able to support Southwest&#x27;s bid with only minor road improvements, it could not support both the Southwest and Alaska proposals without major infrastructure improvements.

=== Armen Yousoufian and Qwest Field ===
On May 30, 1997 Armen Yousoufian, the owner of the University Plaza Hotel in Seattle, requested documents from Mr. Sims’ office concerning the upcoming election (June 17, 1997) about and financing documents for Seattle’s Qwest Field. It took Mr Sims&#x27;s office nearly four years to provide Yousoufian with the documents. Yousoufian eventually sued to be given the documents, and was also awarded five dollars a day for the delay, plus $87,000 in attorneys’ fees. In 2005, after further appeal by Yousoufian, the amount was increased to 15 dollars a day bringing the total to $122,000, plus a further $171,000 in attorneys’ fees, which some claim to be the highest such fine ever assessed in state history. Yousoufian appealed further, and in January 2009 a divided Washington Supreme Court agreed that the $15 a day fine was insufficient. Two justices recommended that the King County Superior Court award $100 a day, the maximum provided for under the law.

==Personal==
Sims and his wife, Cayan Topacio, live in the Mount Baker neighborhood of Seattle. They have three sons: Douglas, Daniel, and Aaron.

<text>The MIT Blackjack Team was a group of students and ex-students. The students were from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, and other leading colleges; they used card counting techniques and more sophisticated strategies to beat casinos at blackjack worldwide. The team and its successors operated successfully from 1979 through the beginning of the 21st century. Many other blackjack teams around the world have been formed with the goal of beating the casinos.

==Blackjack and card counting==

Blackjack can be legally beaten by a skilled player. Beyond the basic strategy of when to hit and when to stand, individual players can use card counting, shuffle tracking, or hole carding to improve their odds. Since the early 1960s, a large number of card counting schemes have been published, and casinos have adjusted the rules of play in an attempt to counter the most popular methods. The idea behind all card counting is that, because a low card is usually bad and a high card usually good, and as cards already seen since the last shuffle cannot be at the top of the deck and thus drawn, the counter can determine the high and low cards that have already been played. They then may know the probability of getting a high card (10, J, Q, K, A) as compared to a low card (2, 3, 4, 5, 6).

==Early days==
In 1979, several friends of J.P. Massar at MIT took a class on blackjack called &quot;How to Gamble If You Must.&quot; They reported to Massar, then about to graduate with a master&#x27;s degree in computer science, that the game was beatable. Using a mainframe computer at the Lincoln Lab in nearby Lexington, Massachusetts, Massar determined that by playing enough hands with enough players willing to signal others about their hands, it was possible for a player to win more hands than they would lose.

Massar and several others took a trip to Atlantic City during spring break to test the theory, but did not find success. The group went their separate ways when most of them graduated in May of the same year. Most never gambled again, but some of them maintained an avid interest in card counting and remained in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Two of them, J.P. Massar and Jonathan, offered a course on blackjack for MIT&#x27;s January 1980 Independent Activities Period (IAP), during which classes may be offered on almost any subject.

In late November 1979, a professional blackjack player named Dave contacted Massar after seeing a flyer for Massar&#x27;s blackjack course. He offered to bankroll a group to go to Atlantic City to take advantage of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission&#x27;s recent ruling which made it illegal for the Atlantic City casinos to ban card counters. Casinos instead have to take other countermeasures like shuffling the cards earlier than normal, using more decks of cards, or offering games with worse rules to destroy the advantage gained by counting—even though these all negatively impact the non-counter as well.

The group of four players, a professional gambler, and an investor who put up most of their capital ($5,000), went to Atlantic City in late December. They recruited more MIT students as players at the January blackjack class. They played intermittently through May 1980 and increased their capital four-fold, but were nonetheless more like a loose group sharing capital than a team with consistent strategies and quality control.

In May 1980, Massar met Bill Kaplan at a Chinese restaurant in Cambridge. Kaplan had earned his BA at Harvard in 1977 and delayed his admission to Harvard Business School for a year when he moved to Las Vegas and formed a team of blackjack players using his own research and statistical analysis of the game. Using funds he received on graduation as Harvard&#x27;s outstanding scholar-athlete, he generated more than a 35 fold rate of return in less than nine months of play. Kaplan continued to run his Las Vegas blackjack team as a sideline while attending Harvard Business School but, by the time of his graduation in May 1980, the players were so &quot;burnt out&quot; in Nevada they were forced to hit the international circuit. Not feeling he could continue to manage the team successfully while they traveled throughout Europe and elsewhere, encountering different rules, playing conditions, and casino practices, Kaplan parted ways with his teammates, who then splintered into multiple small playing teams in pursuit of more favorable conditions throughout the world.

After meeting Kaplan and hearing about his blackjack successes, Massar asked Kaplan if he was interested in going with a few of Massar&#x27;s blackjack-playing friends to Atlantic City to observe their play. Given the serendipitous timing (Kaplan&#x27;s parting with his Las Vegas team), he agreed to go in the hopes of putting together a new local team that he could train and manage. Kaplan observed Massar and his teammates playing for a weekend in Atlantic City. He noted that each of the players used a different, and overcomplicated, card counting strategy. It resulted in error rates that undermined the benefits of the more complicated strategies. After returning to Cambridge, Kaplan detailed the problems he observed to Massar.

Kaplan said he would back a team but it had to be run as a business with formal management procedures, a required counting and betting system, strict training and player approval processes, and careful tracking of all casino play. A couple of the players were initially averse to the idea. They had no interest in having to learn a new playing system, being put through &quot;trial by fire&quot; checkout procedures before being approved to play, being supervised in the casinos, or having to fill out detailed player sheets (such as casino, cash in and cash out totals, time period, betting strategy and limits, and the rest) for every playing session. However, their keen interest in the game coupled with Kaplan&#x27;s successful track record won out.

==Capitalization and growth (1980–1989)==
The newly capitalized &quot;bank&quot; of the MIT Blackjack Team started on 1 August 1980. The investment stake was $89,000, with both outside investors and players putting up the capital. Ten players, including Kaplan, Massar, Jonathan, Goose, and &quot;Big Dave&quot; (aka &quot;coach&quot;, to distinguish from the other Dave from the first round) played on this bank. Ten weeks later they more than doubled the original stake. Profits per hour played at the tables were $162.50, statistically equivalent to the projected rate of $170/hour detailed in the investor offering prospectus. Per the terms of the investment offering, players and investors split the profits with players paid in proportion to their playing hours and computer simulated win rates. Over the ten-week period of this first bank, players, mostly undergraduates, earned an average of over $80/hour while investors achieved an annualized return in excess of 250%.

The MIT Blackjack Team continued to play throughout the 1980s, growing to as many as 35 players in 1984 with a capitalization of as much as $350,000. Having played and run successful teams since 1977, Kaplan reached a point in late 1984 where he could not show his face in any casino without being followed by the casino personnel in search of his team members. As a result he decided to fall back on his growing real estate investment and development company, his &quot;day job&quot; since 1980, and stopped managing the team. He continued for another year or so as an occasional player and investor in the team, now being run by Massar, Chang and Bill Rubin, a player who joined the team in 1984.

The MIT Blackjack Team ran at least 22 partnerships in the time period from late 1979 through 1989. At least 70 people played on the team in some capacity (either as counters, big players, or in various supporting roles) over that time span. Every partnership was profitable during this time period, after paying all expenses as well as the players&#x27; and managers&#x27; share of the winnings, with returns to investors ranging from 4%/year to over 300%/year.

==Strategic Investments (1992–1993)==
In 1992, Bill Kaplan, J.P. Massar, and John Chang decided to capitalize on the opening of Foxwoods Casino in nearby Connecticut, where they planned to train new players. Acting as the General Partner, they formed a Massachusetts Limited Partnership in June 1992 called Strategic Investments to bankroll the new team. Structured similar to the numerous real estate development limited partnerships that Kaplan had formed, the limited partnership raised a million dollars, significantly more money than any of their previous teams, with a method based on Edward Thorp&#x27;s high low system. It involved three players: a big player, a controller, and a spotter. The spotter checked when the deck went positive with card counting, the controller would bet small constantly, wasting money, and verifying the spotter&#x27;s count. Once the controller found a positive, he would signal to the big player. He would make a massive bet, and win big. Confident with this new funding, the three general partners ramped up their recruitment and training efforts to capitalize on the opportunity.

Over the next two years, the MIT Team grew to nearly 80 players, including groups and players in Cambridge, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, Illinois, and Washington. Sarah McCord, who joined the team in 1983 as an MIT student and later moved to California, was added as a partner soon after SI was formed and became responsible for training and recruitment of West Coast players.

At various times, there were nearly 30 players playing simultaneously at different casinos around the world, including Native American casinos throughout the country, Las Vegas, Atlantic City, Canada, and island locations. Never before had casinos throughout the world seen such an organized and scientific onslaught directed at the game. While the profits rolled in, so did the &quot;heat&quot; from the casinos, and many MIT Team members were identified and barred. These members were replaced by fresh players from MIT, Harvard, and other colleges and companies, and play continued. Eventually, investigators hired by casinos realized that many of those they had banned had addresses in or near Cambridge, and the connection to MIT and a formalized team became clear. The detectives obtained copies of recent MIT yearbooks and added photographs from it to their image database.

With its leading players banned from most casinos and other more lucrative investment opportunities opening up at the end of the recession, Strategic Investments paid out its substantial earnings to players and investors and dissolved its partnership on December 31, 1993.

By the team&#x27;s peak in the 1990s, the team was visiting Las Vegas almost every weekend. According to a casino security investigator, the team took over $400,000 in one weekend. After the trips to Vegas, the team would enter what they remembered into computer programs to devise the best strategy for specific situations.

==Split and dissolution (1994–2000)==
After the dissolution of Strategic Investments, a few of the players took their winnings and split off into two independent groups. The Amphibians were primarily led by Semyon Dukach, with Dukach as the big player, Katie Lilienkamp (a controller), and Andy Bloch (a spotter). The other team was the Reptiles, led by Mike Aponte, Manlio Lopez and Wes Atamian. These teams had various legal structures, and at times million dollar banks and 50+ players. By 2000 the 15+ year reign of the MIT Blackjack Teams came to an end as players drifted into other pursuits.

In 1999, a member of the Amphibians won at Max Rubin&#x27;s 3rd Annual Blackjack Ball competition. The event was featured in an October 1999 &quot;Cigar Aficionado&quot; article, which said the winner earned the unofficial title &quot;Most Feared Man in the Casino Business&quot;.

==Strategy and techniques==
The team often recruited students through flyers and the players&#x27; friends from college campuses across the country. The team tested potential members to find out if they were suitable candidates and, if they were, the team thoroughly trained the new members for free. Fully trained players had to pass an intense &quot;trial by fire,&quot; consisting of playing through 8 six-deck shoes with almost perfect play, and then undergo further training, supervision, and similar check-outs in actual casino play until they could become full stakes players.

New members of the team would train for weeks or months, starting on MIT&#x27;s campus, then practicing in backroom card games in Boston&#x27;s Chinatown. They would then begin as the team&#x27;s mule in Vegas, carrying cash, as they worked up the team&#x27;s hierarchy.

The group combined individual play with a team approach of counters and big players to maximize opportunities and disguise the betting patterns that card counting produces. In a 2002 interview in &quot;Blackjack Forum&quot; magazine, John Chang, an MIT undergrad who joined the team in late 1980 (and became MIT team co-manager in the mid-1980s and 1990s), reported that, in addition to classic card counting and blackjack team techniques, at various times the group used advanced shuffle and ace tracking techniques. While the MIT team&#x27;s card counting techniques can give players an overall edge of about 2 percent, some of the MIT team&#x27;s methods have been established as gaining players an overall edge of about 4 percent. In his interview, Chang reported that the MIT team had difficulty attaining such edges in actual play, and their overall results had been best with straight card counting.

The MIT Team&#x27;s approach was originally developed by Al Francesco, elected by professional gamblers as one of the original seven inductees into the Blackjack Hall of Fame. Blackjack team play was first written about by Ken Uston, an early member of Al Francesco&#x27;s teams along with Bill Erb and Blair Hull. Uston wrote &quot;The Big Player&quot; (1977) and &quot;Million Dollar Blackjack&quot; (1981) about Blackjack team card counting techniques. Kaplan enhanced Francesco&#x27;s team methods and used them for the MIT team. The team concept enabled players and investors to leverage both their time and money, reducing their &quot;risk of ruin&quot; while also making it more difficult for casinos to detect card counting at their tables.

==In the media==

===Books===

*A variety of stories about a few of the players from the MIT Blackjack Team formed the basis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; best-selling &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot;, written by Ben Mezrich. While originally marketed as nonfiction, Mezrich later admitted characters and stories in the book were mostly fictitious and composites of players and stories he had heard about through hearsay. The private investigation firm referred to as Plymouth in &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; was Griffin Investigations.
*Mezrich wrote a follow-up book, &quot;Busting Vegas&quot;, which took even greater liberty with the actual happenings of the team. Many events in this book were at least partly based on incidents that occurred during the team&#x27;s Strategic Investments era.
* Jeff Ma wrote a book titled &quot;The House Advantage: Playing the Odds to Win Big in Business&quot; about his time on the 1994 MIT blackjack team.
* Nathaniel Tilton, a student of former MIT team captains Mike Aponte and Semyon Dukach, authored &quot;The Blackjack Life&quot; detailing his experiences playing and being trained by the MIT Blackjack Team players.

===Films===
* The 2004 film &quot;The Last Casino&quot; is loosely based on this premise and features three students and a professor counting cards in Ontario and Quebec.
* The 2008 film &quot;21&quot;, inspired by &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; and produced by and starring Kevin Spacey and Jim Sturgess, was released on March 28, 2008, by Columbia Pictures. Jeff Ma and Henry Houh, former players on the team, appear in the movie as casino dealers, and Bill Kaplan appears in a cameo in the background of the underground Chinese gambling parlor scene. The script took significant artistic license with events, with most of its plot being invented for the movie, hence it refers to being &#x27;inspired by true events&#x27; rather than &#x27;based on true events.&#x27; One of the most significant departures from reality was the portrayal of the team being run by a professor (the Kevin Spacey character), when in reality the team was always run by students and alumni. The characters in the movie were also fictionalized amalgams of various players throughout the years of the team&#x27;s existence - for example, the character Choi is very loosely based on Johnny Chang, and the character Ben Campbell is an amalgam of numerous players, with the opening scene based on Big Dave&#x27;s interview, and subsequent admission to Harvard Medical School, where much of the interview revolved around his participation on the team.
* The 2010 film &quot;Teen Patti&quot; is an uncredited remake of &quot;21&quot;.

===Television===
*The &quot;Mysteries at the Museum&quot; series on the Travel Channel featured the story of the MIT Blackjack Team in the episode titled &quot;Siamese Twins, Assassin Umbrella, Capone&#x27;s Cell&quot;.
*The story of the MIT Blackjack Team, in its incarnation as Strategic Investments, was told in The History Channel documentary, &quot;Breaking Vegas&quot;, directed by Bruce David Klein.
*The &quot;Bringing Down The House&quot; period was featured on episodes of the Game Show Network documentary series, &quot;Anything to Win&quot;, and HBO&#x27;s &quot;Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel&quot; (episode 116).
*The BBC documentary, &quot;Making Millions the Easy Way&quot;, addressed the &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; period as part of the renowned &quot;Horizon&quot; strand (directed by Johanna Gibbon), told the story of a Strategic Investments breakaway group, and revealed the science behind the winning formula.
*&quot;Double Down&quot;, an episode of &quot;Numb3rs&quot; concerned a counting group, led by a High School teacher, which launders money through casino winnings.

===Other===
* The StarTalk podcast has an episode dedicated to this topic
* Several members of the two teams have used their expertise to start public speaking careers as well as businesses teaching others how to count cards. For example:

:* Mike Aponte of the Reptiles co-founded a company with former MIT Blackjack Team member David Irvine called the Blackjack Institute.
:* Semyon Dukach of the Amphibians founded Blackjack Science.

<text>The Chronoliths is a 2001 science fiction novel by American-Canadian writer Robert Charles Wilson. It was nominated for the 2002 Hugo Award for Best Novel and tied for the 2002 John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.

==Plot summary==

Software designer Scott Warden is living with his family in early twenty-first century Thailand after his latest contract has ended. He and his friend Hitch Paley are among the first to find an enormous monolith which appears out of nowhere in the jungle. On closer examination, it is found to be a monument made of a mysterious, indestructible substance. It bears an inscription commemorating a military victory by someone named &quot;Kuin&quot;, presumably an Asian warlord—twenty years in the future.

Over the next twenty years, increasingly grand monuments to Kuin continue to appear—first in Asia, then in much of the rest of the world. Pro-Kuin and anti-Kuin political movements spring up, leading to the rise of economic problems, fatalistic cults, and open war.

Scott has become entangled with his former teacher and mentor Sue Chopra, a scientist who has assembled a team of fellow researchers to investigate the chronoliths and learn to predict their appearances. With Sue&#x27;s team, Scott witnesses a new chronolith that appears in Jerusalem.

Kaitlin, his daughter, becomes caught up in the hysteria and joins a pro-Kuin youth cult; while trying to find her, Scott meets Ashlee, a single mother whose son Adam Mills joined the same cult. This leads to Scott and his companions being on hand to witness yet another chronolith appearance in Mexico in which Adam apparently dies. Scott quits his work with Sue and marries Ashlee, trying to live a normal life. 

Sue Chopra comes to believe that Kuin has made the chronoliths in order to inspire fear and defeatism, making the future victories inevitable by gaining support ahead of time. In an effort to fight Kuin&#x27;s growing influence, she uses the revelation that Adam is alive and leading a Kuin worshipper group to recruit Scott back into her work, with the plan to destroy the first chronolith predicted to appear in the United States.

The chronolith appears, but shortly after, it self-destructs, apparently sabotaged by a maker who exceeded the limits of the technology.

A militant faction led by Adam Mills attacks their base of operations, takes Chopra hostage, and menaces Scott&#x27;s family. Before allowing herself to be taken hostage, Sue entrusts Scott with a secret: she believes it&#x27;s her fate to be made prisoner in order to be able to sabotage this chronolith. After this, a twenty year-long war ensues. While no physical Kuin ever appears to led the factions fighting on his name, Scott finds out by chance that Adam&#x27;s middle name was Quinn, which may hint to him being the closest to a real Kuin. 

Scott lives to see the collapse of the Kuinist movement and a scientific renaissance sparked by Chopra&#x27;s chronolith research. At the end of the story he and Kaitlin watch the launch of an interstellar probe that seems to be based on this research.

<text>Bummed is the second studio album by English rock band Happy Mondays, released on 21 November 1988 on Factory Records. During 1987 and early 1988, the band discovered house music and the rave drug ecstasy. Factory producer Martin Hannett was subsequently enlisted to produce the band&#x27;s next album. Sessions were held at The Slaughterhouse recording studio in Driffield over three weeks. The period was noted for heavy drug use by the band and Hannett, with their manager later calling it the first &quot;ecstasy-fuelled&quot; album, (although &quot;Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret&quot; by Soft Cell was really the first).Hannett moved recording to Strawberry Studios, where extra instrumentation was added. &quot;Bummed&quot; is a Madchester-style psychedelic funk album, where much of the lyrical content was influenced by the 1970 film &quot;Performance&quot;, with dialogue from the film sampled throughout.

Happy Mondays toured the United Kingdom supporting James in late 1988, which coincided with the release of the lead single from &quot;Bummed&quot;, &quot;Wrote for Luck&quot;, on 31 October 1988. Happy Mondays played a series of headlining shows to close out the year; stints in mainland Europe and the UK followed in the first half of 1989. &quot;Lazyitis – One Armed Boxer&quot;, an alternative version of the closing track &quot;Lazy Itis&quot;, was released as the second single from the album on 6 May 1989. Following this, the band embarked on a North American tour, supporting labelmates Pixies. At the suggestion of their manager, remixes of &quot;Wrote for Luck&quot; – retitled &quot;W.F.L.&quot; – were made by Paul Oakenfold and Vince Clarke of Erasure. These versions were released together as part of a reissued &quot;W.F.L.&quot; single in September 1989.

&quot;Bummed&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics, many of whom praised Hannett&#x27;s production work. It peaked at number 59 on the UK Albums Chart, though it was initially seen as a disappointing seller by Factory Records. The original version of &quot;Wrote for Luck&quot; reached number seven on the UK Independent Singles Chart. &quot;Lazyitis – One Armed Boxer&quot; charted at number 46 on the UK Singles Chart, followed by the remixed &quot;W.F.L.&quot; at number 68. &quot;Bummed&quot; appeared on album of the year and best of decade lists by &quot;NME,&quot; &quot;Sounds,&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;. &quot;Wrote for Luck&quot; and &quot;Bummed&quot; have been viewed as defining releases of the acid house era and the Second Summer of Love.

==Background==
Happy Mondays released their debut studio album, &quot;Squirrel and G-Man Twenty Four Hour Party People Plastic Face Carnt Smile (White Out),&quot; in April 1987 through Factory Records. The album had to be reissued due to the track &quot;Desmond&quot; sharing the same melody with &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot; (1968) by the Beatles. They were threatened with legal action over this; it was replaced on subsequent copies with the hastily recorded &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot;. During the session for it, the band also worked on several new tracks for their next album. The lead single from &quot;Squirrel and G-Man Twenty Four Hour Party People Plastic Face Carnt Smile (White Out)&quot;, &quot;Tart Tart&quot;, earned Happy Mondays national exposure for the first time when its music video was played on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Chart Show&quot;.

In the first half of 1987 (between recording and the release of their debut), Factory A&amp;R member and DJ Mike Pickering was introducing house music at the label&#x27;s Haçienda club. The members of Happy Mondays would visit the venue to immerse themselves in Pickering&#x27;s selections. It would prove to have an influence on the members, as it served as a bridge between the music they heard in their heads and what they wrote. The band at this point did not fit into any particular music scene; grebo was establishing itself, a new wave of gothic rock was being ushered in, and American indie bands were rising to prominence. In October 1987, the band embarked on their first headlining tour of the United Kingdom, which saw the debut of new songs &quot;Fat Lady Wrestlers&quot; and &quot;Moving in With&quot;.

Shortly before Christmas 1987, Happy Mondays dancer Bez was introduced to the rave drug ecstasy and quickly introduced it to the other members. Frontman Shaun Ryder grew tired of their manager, Phil Saxe, wanting someone who was more in tune with the scene at the Haçienda. In early 1988, Saxe left his role, citing that he could not devote enough time to it. He was replaced by Nathan McGough, who took on the role full-time at his suggestion. McGough had been a member of Factory band The Royal Family and the Poor and previously managed Factory act Kalima. McGough&#x27;s first measure was getting the band legally signed to Factory, who had no formal contracts with their artists up to that point. Around this time, the members had a lucrative business selling ecstasy; through various people, they had accumulated 15,000 pills of the drug.

==Recording and production==
===Demos===
McGough organised Happy Mondays to record demos of their new material at Out of the Blue Studios in Ancoats. Factory became aware that the band were known around London as being a difficult act to record with, not helped by the poor reception to the production of their debut album. Ryder was impressed with the self-produced material at Out of the Blue and asked if they could self-produce their next album, only to be told that they needed a known, popular producer. Factory director Alan Erasmus suggested Martin Hannett; he worked with the label in their early years and split following the construction of the Haçienda, which he was opposed to.

McGough liked the idea of having Hannett, as did Ryder, who learned of him through New Order frontman Bernard Sumner and his work on &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; (1979) by Joy Division. Factory Records co-founder Tony Wilson was hesitant about the idea before realising it would work well for both Hannett and the band. Hannett had been struggling financially at the time, stemming from a prior lawsuit with Factory. Bassist Paul Ryder and drummer Gary Whelan drove to pick Hannett up from Chorlton to take him to the studio. Happy Mondays and Hannett decamped to Strawberry Studios in Stockport with the intent to record demos; however, Hannett and the members instead spent session time in separate pubs. They ended up only recording an early version of &quot;Wrote for Luck&quot;.

===Main sessions===
&quot;Bummed&quot; was recorded in August 1988 at The Slaughterhouse in Driffield with engineers Colin Richardson and John Spence. It was a residential studio with a state-of-the-art 36-track recording console. The location was picked as it was a large distance from the Haçienda, in an attempt to cut Happy Mondays from their ecstasy supply. Upon arriving, they found that the living quarters had no food and the rooms were astray. They instead lived in a terrace house that previously contained the studio. Hannett stayed at another house in the nearby town, which allowed for visits from his family. Within two days of visiting a local pub, the band became aware of a nearby army base, where they befriended various personnel. The band started selling the servicemen ecstasy; rave culture subsequently broke out at the pub, which caught the attention of the local press.

Describing the drug&#x27;s impact on the recording, McGough recalled that the members of the band were consuming it daily and added they brought 200 pills of it with them, &quot;but they ran out after ten days so I had to go back to Manchester and collect another hundred. &quot;Bummed&quot; is definitely an E album, perhaps the first full album ever made on that drug.&quot; Bez was arrested while in Manchester for stealing a car and possessing marijuana. He also had 500 ecstasy pills, but the police were not aware of what they were at the time; he had to sit out of the remainder of the sessions. Ryder also noted the influence of LSD on the sessions. The band provided the alcoholic Hannett with large amounts of ecstasy to keep him from drinking during the recording.

Hannett would have the band perform the songs over and over for several hours at a time and, as such, would record the majority of the album live. Due to his previous experience as a bass player, Hannett spent time alone with Paul Ryder working on a specific sound. Hannett ran the instrument through a multitude of digital filters, time modulation, and effects pedals. In addition to using his own guitar on the album, guitarist Mark Day used one of Hannett&#x27;s. Aware of Hannett&#x27;s financial issues, Shaun Ryder bought the guitar from him for £300. On one occasion, Wilson visited the band during the sessions. Upon entering the studio, he found it dark and filled with smoke, as the floor was completely covered in house records.

Wilson brought with him a film crew to shoot part of the sessions for a TV programme he was involved in about working environments. As the band returned to Manchester, Hannett continued experimenting with the master tapes at Strawberry Studios with engineer Laurence Diana. He brought in additional musicians to enhance the tracks: percussion from drum teacher Dave Hassell, piano from his friend Steve Hopkins, and banjo from Derek &quot;Horseman&quot; Ryder (father of Shaun and Paul Ryder). Hannett saturated the recordings with effects such as reverb and echo. The sessions lasted for three weeks in total, costing £50,000; the final recordings were mixed at Strawberry Studios in September 1988.

==Composition and lyrics==
===Overview===
Musically, the sound of &quot;Bummed&quot; has been described as Madchester and psychedelic funk. Author Dave Thompson, in his book &quot;Alternative Rock&quot; (2000), said it sounded like the &quot;missing link between post-punk and the burgeoning baggy scene&quot;; he compared Ryder&#x27;s vocals to that of Fall frontman Mark E. Smith, recommended that Day should audition for Siouxsie and the Banshees, and suggested Bez and Wheelan &quot;send their résumés to Adam Ant&quot;. Ryder said it had a fuller sound when compared to &quot;Squirrel and G-Man Twenty Four Hour Party People Plastic Face Carnt Smile (White Out)&quot;, building off the progression from &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot;. Referring to the origin of the album&#x27;s name, Whelan recalled that &quot;&#x27;Bummed&#x27;, was a saying at the time. Shaun used to say he was out all night and he bummed her all night long, a slang word for sex. I didn&#x27;t even know what the album was called until it came out.&quot; Ryder said he used the term for the album intentionally to be &quot;offensive and we thought loads of people would take it the wrong way&quot;.

In his biography of the band, &quot;Shaun Ryder: Happy Mondays, Black Grape &amp; Other Traumas&quot;, author Mick Middles said the public overlooked its intent, theorising that it could be used in varying contexts: &quot;from the more obvious cadging (e.g. he bummed a fag from his mate) to scrounging a room for the night (e.g. he bummed a carpet)&quot;. The 1970 film &quot;Performance&quot; became a big influence on the band, with Ryder directly lifting lines of dialogue for lyrics or being inspired by some of the scenes in it. He would mix in slang words he had heard while shifting ecstasy. Ryder was expected to have finished writing the lyrics to the songs in the months prior to recording; by the time recording was nearly done, he had lyrics for less than half of the album. It prompted him to finish the other half in the final few days of the sessions.

===Songs===
&quot;Country Song&quot;, the opening track on &quot;Bummed&quot;, was originally known as &quot;Some Cunt from Preston&quot;, acting as rhyming slang for country and western. John Wilde of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; described it as &quot;the world&#x27;s first psycho-reggae-country-western number&quot;. It was written before the band had figured out their sound; while rehearsing at The Boardwalk, they came up with what Ryder called the &quot;Salford version of a country song&quot;. Its title changed from &quot;Some Cunt from Preston&quot; to &quot;Redneck&quot; before ending up at &quot;Country Song&quot;. &quot;Moving in With&quot; is about the place Ryder lived while in Boothstown, Salford. An earlier version of it was recorded during the same session as &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot;. With the song, Paul Ryder attempted to emulate the bass part in &quot;This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)&quot; (1983) by Talking Heads. Whelan&#x27;s drum part was inspired by the one in &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; (1985) by Kate Bush. Shaun Ryder&#x27;s lyrics were influenced by the folk tale Henny Penny and namecheck several of its characters.

&quot;Mad Cyril&quot; is named after a character from &quot;Performance&quot; and includes a sample of a different character from the same film, Harry Flowers. The song&#x27;s lyrics describe a gangster having a trip. &quot;Fat Lady Wrestlers&quot; is representative of the lifestyle the band had at the time, as Ryder explained: &quot;We were very much living like crazy hustlers&quot;. &quot;Performance&quot; is written from the perspective of Chas, another character from the film of the same name. Similar to &quot;Moving in With&quot;, it also references Ryder&#x27;s place in Boothstown, where they would stash valuable items such as drugs or clothes. &quot;Brain Dead&quot; opens with Ryder quoting a line from the film &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; (1970): &quot;You&#x27;re rendering that scaffolding dangerous!&quot;

With &quot;Wrote for Luck&quot;, the band tried to write a song that could be played at the Haçienda. Paul Ryder unsuccessfully tried to play sequenced basslines, which he heard in the Chicago house music that Pickering was playing at the club, on his bass guitar. Keyboardist Paul Davis tried to play the synth part from &quot;Two Tribes&quot; (1984) by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, while Whelan had a go at emulating &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; again. Day later contributed his guitar part, while Shaun Ryder added the song&#x27;s hook, &quot;Higher than high high&quot;, based on his mental state at the time. It marked the first time Ryder attempted to write a song about the same topic, namely a heroin drug deal gone wrong. One of its lines is dialogue directly taken from the 1974 film &quot;Stardust&quot;.

Ryder said &quot;Bring a Friend&quot; is the closest track to a love song on the album, with many of its lines taken from a pornographic magazine he had read while in Amsterdam. &quot;Do It Better&quot; was initially called &quot;E&quot;; it is centred around a guitar part and Ryder ad-libbing around the phrase &quot;on one&quot;, which referred to being high on ecstasy. The album&#x27;s closing track, &quot;Lazy Itis&quot;, has Can-esque drumming patterns and borrows a lyric from &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; (1965) by the Beatles, resulting in a writing credit between Happy Mondays and Lennon–McCartney. Its title phrase was a word the Ryders&#x27; grandmother used to say. For the single version of the track, Ryder decided to include lyrics from &quot;Gonna Make You a Star&quot; (1974) by David Essex.

==Release==
&quot;Bummed&quot; was released on 21 November 1988 through Factory Records. The cover art shows an image of Ryder&#x27;s face painted over in garish colours, which Central Station Design did as part of a series of celebrity shots done in the same way. Iain Ellis of &quot;PopMatters&quot; said Ryder&#x27;s &quot;cropped face [is] a disturbing caricature of drug-afflicted vacancy&quot;, which has &quot;become an emblem of the times, the carnival decadence of an era encapsulated in pictorial form.&quot; Matthew Robertson, in his book &quot;Factory Records: The Complete Graphic Album&quot; (2006), added to this, saying that the &quot;viewer cannot help but be caught by the haunting, mesmerizing, enormity&quot; of the artwork. The album&#x27;s inner sleeve featured two images of a naked woman, both of which were taken from the Readers&#x27; Wives section of an issue of &quot;Penthouse&quot;. Robertson said this was done &quot;for humour&#x27;s sake rather than shock value&quot;; Wilson dubbed it &quot;one of the most profoundly disturbing inner sleeves in record history&quot;. As a result of this imagery, retailers refused to stock the album; its Japanese release was delayed due to the image, resulting in copies being confiscated at customs. In addition, it received a negative reaction from journalists, such as Penny Anderson of &quot;City Life&quot; and Mandi James of &quot;NME&quot;, the latter of whom called the band &quot;sexist wankers&quot; for the decision.

Concerned about people stealing promotional posters, as they had done previously for New Order gig posters, Factory Records decided to purchase a building and have it plastered with posters of the album&#x27;s artwork. Located on Charles Street, it was noticed by various workers traveling in the southern part of Manchester. Middles said the landmark could be viewed as the first &quot;identifiable symbol of Manchester dance culture&quot; and Madchester as a whole. In early 1989, the band signed a publishing deal with FFRR Music; around this time, the band signed a contract with American label Elektra Records. The latter was impressed by the &quot;Wrote for Luck&quot; video and Wilson&#x27;s sales pitch. Factory also had smaller deals with labels in Europe, such as Rough Trade Records in Germany. By July 1989, &quot;Bummed&quot; was released in North America as &quot;Wrote for Luck&quot; was gaining traction at radio stations.

===Singles===
&quot;Wrote for Luck&quot; was released as the lead single from Happy Mondays&#x27; forthcoming album; author Simon Spence in his book &quot;Happy Mondays – Excess All Areas: A Biography&quot; (2014) listed the release date as 31 October 1988, while a contemporary issue of &quot;Music Week&quot; gave the date of 28 November 1988. &quot;Boom&quot; and three remixes (dance, radio, and club mixes) of &quot;Wrote for Luck&quot; were included as its B-sides. Robertson wrote that the sleeve&#x27;s &quot;hand-drawn lettering was an intentional move away from designers relying on type specimen books&quot;, as with previous Factory Records releases. The music video for &quot;Wrote for Luck&quot; was filmed by The Bailey Brothers in the middle of the October 1988 tour. They decided to shoot the band enjoying a night out at the Legend club in Manchester, which was a rival to the Haçienda. They hired the venue for the shoot, which featured their friends and crew members as extras. Concerned that the video was not going to receive airplay on &quot;The Chart Show&quot;, a second video was filmed during the afternoon with a younger crowd. It starred children from a local drama group who spent a week rehearsing acid house-style dancing. As none of them liked &quot;Wrote for Luck&quot;, The Bailey Brothers put on music by Pepsi &amp; Shirlie and Wham! in order for them to start dancing.

&quot;Lazy Itis&quot; was released as the second single from the album; a contemporary issue of &quot;Music Week&quot; listed the date of 24 April 1989, while Spence gave a release date of 6 May 1989. Robertson said the artwork was a &quot;bright arrangement [of colours] that is also bloated and sluggish and is delivered in a hallucinogenic daze&quot;, while its title is &quot;incorporated into a three-dimensional typographic sculpture through which runs a river of ink&quot;. The single iteration is dubbed &quot;Lazyitis – One Armed Boxer&quot;; its B-side is a remix of &quot;Mad Cyril&quot;. The former is a duet between Ryder and yodeller Karl Denver, which was intended as a theme song for an unrealised film by The Bailey Brothers. The song&#x27;s music video was filmed a month prior at the Mancunian Way flyover with the band and Denver. It stars the band in Strangeways prison attire, playing football, while their friend Big Les walks around them with a dog. The Bailey Brothers wanted to include rain in it, so they hired a rain machine. Filming concluded when Denver was unable to continue mouthing the words due to his teeth chattering from the cold.

In an attempt to boost the album&#x27;s reach in the UK, McGough suggested making a house remix for one of its tracks. He was put in contact with Pete Tong at FFRR, who connected McGough with Paul Oakenfold. Bez had previously spent the last six months convincing the band to work with him, and Ryder had been playing &quot;Jibaro&quot; (1988) by Oakenfold&#x27;s band Electra frequently during the making of &quot;Bummed&quot;. McGough quizzed the members on who else they wanted as a remixer, with Paul Ryder suggesting Vince Clarke of Erasure. Oakenfold played white label copies of his remix at various clubs, all to positive reception from the crowds. Reissued on 18 September 1989, &quot;Wrote for Luck&quot; – now retitled &quot;W.F.L.&quot; – included Clarke and Oakenfold remixes of the title track, with &quot;Lazyitis – One Armed Boxer&quot; as its B-side. Robertson said that the artwork for this version adapts the original &quot;Wrote for Luck&quot; cover as it &quot;becomes the backdrop for what appears to be a fish tank&quot;, with species of fish swimming in front of it. He added that this contributes a &quot;playful dimension to their pre-existing aesthetic&quot;.

===Reissues and related releases===
&quot;Bummed&quot; was reissued in 2007 as part of a two-CD set through Rhino Records, which included B-sides, the &quot;Madchester Rave On&quot; (1989) EP, and a variety of remixes. It was included in Rhino Records&#x27; &quot;Original Album Series&quot; box set in 2013, which collected Happy Mondays&#x27; first four studio albums. That same year, the band performed the album in its entirety to celebrate its 25th anniversary in 2013. The album was re-pressed on vinyl in 2020 alongside their first, third, and fourth albums.

&quot;Wrote for Luck&quot;, &quot;Lazy Itis&quot;, and remixes of &quot;Wrote for Luck&quot; and &quot;Mad Cyril&quot; appeared on Happy Mondays&#x27; first compilation album, &quot;Double Easy – The U.S. Singles&quot; (1993). &quot;Mad Cyril&quot;, &quot;Lazy Itis&quot;, and a remix of &quot;Wrote for Luck&quot; were included on their second and fourth compilation albums, &quot;Loads&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Platinum Collection&quot; (2005). &quot;Mad Cyril&quot; and remixes of &quot;Wrote for Luck&quot; and &quot;Lazy Itis&quot; appeared on the band&#x27;s third compilation album, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (1999). Remixes of &quot;Wrote for Luck&quot; and &quot;Lazy Itis&quot; were included on the band&#x27;s fifth compilation album, &quot;Double Double Good: The Best of Happy Mondays&quot; (2012).

==Touring and live performances==
In October 1988, Happy Mondays supported James on their tour of the UK. Following this, the band played four headlining shows across November and December 1988, closing the year with a support slot for New Order at the G-Mex Centre. Happy Mondays played &quot;Performance&quot; and &quot;Do It Better&quot;, both of which Ryder picked, for Wilson&#x27;s TV programme &quot;The Other Side of Midnight&quot;. A launch party for the album was held on 28 November 1989 at the Heaven club in London. Preceded by two UK shows, Happy Mondays embarked on a stint in mainland Europe in January and February 1989. As the band had run out of money by the tour&#x27;s end, a few shows were quickly arranged afterwards so that they had enough funds to return home. A London show soon followed, where the members met Elektra A&amp;R representative Howard Thompson. On 21 February 1989, the band did a Peel session, where they played &quot;Mad Cyril&quot; and &quot;Do It Better&quot;.

Following this, Happy Mondays went on a UK tour until mid-March 1989. They supported the Shamen for two dates in Ireland before supporting My Bloody Valentine for three shows in France. Prior to the Ireland shows, Bez was arrested by his father, who was a cop, for violating his bail conditions set during the making of &quot;Bummed&quot;. Bez&#x27;s role was filled in by Andrew McKean, who previously worked with Saxe; Bez returned for the My Bloody Valentine shows. Happy Mondays played three UK shows in May 1989. Ryder and Bez flew to New York City, spending two days there drumming up publicity for a forthcoming tour. Happy Mondays appeared on the final episode of &quot;The Other Side of Midnight&quot;, where they performed &quot;Mad Cyril&quot; (changing the lyrics to reference Wilson) and &quot;Wrote for Luck&quot;. In July and August 1989, the band toured across Canada and the US, supporting labelmates Pixies.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Bummed&quot; was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. &quot;NME&quot; writer James Brown lauded the album&#x27;s &quot;shocking originality&quot; and found that its sound would &quot;fit startlingly amidst the rapid mutation of the current underground dance boom.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; Martin Aston said it &quot;continues the band&#x27;s warped version of Northern Soul rhythms, with stabbing guitars and Hammond organs, wayward sequencers, a dislocated rhythm section and surly sardonic vocalist ... [The] only real failing is its lack of versatility, but it&#x27;s Happy Mondays&#x27; stroppy spirit that counts most of all.&quot; Tony Beard of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; noted the band&#x27;s musical development, writing that &quot;the sound they slip into is a world away from the cack-handed northern funk they used to bash out.&quot; &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; journalist Greg Kot complimented Hannett&#x27;s production, calling it &quot;one excellent reason&quot; for listeners to buy the album.

Reviewing &quot;Bummed&quot; in retrospect for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised Hannett&#x27;s production as &quot;all smeared colors and harsh edges,&quot; and wrote that &quot;decadence has rarely sounded as dangerous as it did in the hands of the Mondays and this is where they reveled in that debauchery, pumping out stiff psychedelic funk as Ryder spat out rhymes of luck, lazyitis and fat lady wrestlers.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Alexis Petridis said, &quot;[a]lmost 20 years on, &quot;Bummed&quot; sounds extraordinary, but wildly abstruse&quot;. He expanded on this, calling it the &quot;result of the copious intake of ecstasy&quot;. Priya Elan of &quot;NME&quot; felt the album &quot;actually dated best&quot; out of all of the band&#x27;s releases, despite Hannett&#x27;s &quot;raw production show[ing] the Madchester sound in its infancy&quot;. BBC Music reviewer Daryl Easlea wrote that it had a &quot;heart and spirit that beats away&quot;, stopping the &quot;album from [the brink of] collapse.&quot; &quot;Mojo&quot; Danny Eccleston credited Happy Mondays with creating &quot;a new kind of psychedelic punk-funk&quot; on &quot;Bummed&quot;.

==Commercial performance and accolades==
&quot;Bummed&quot; peaked at number 59 on the main UK Albums Chart and number two on the UK Independent Albums Chart. Factory saw the album&#x27;s initial sales as highly disappointing, though they were not concerned due to a large cash flow injection from the sales of New Order&#x27;s &quot;Substance&quot; (1987) a year prior. By early 1989, it had sold 15,000 copies. Due to the success of the remixed &quot;W.F.L.&quot;, the album&#x27;s sales reached the threshold for gold certification in the UK. &quot;Lazyitis – One Armed Boxer&quot; charted at number 46 on the main UK Singles Chart and number six on the UK Independent Singles Chart. The original version of &quot;Wrote for Luck&quot; peaked at number seven on the UK Independent Singles Chart. The remixed &quot;W.F.L.&quot; peaked at number 68 on the main UK Singles Chart and number three on the UK Independent Singles Chart.

Spence said &quot;Wrote for Luck&quot; became the defining track of the acid house era. Scott Plagenhoef of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; considered &quot;Bummed&quot; the &quot;perfect summation of the 1988 British Summer of Love&quot;. It was included in the 2006 edition of &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In a piece for &quot;NME&quot;, journalist Mark Beaumont viewed the album as one of ten important releases that defined Factory Records&#x27; output. Manic Street Preachers covered &quot;Wrote for Luck&quot; as a B-side to their single &quot;Roses in the Hospital&quot; (1993), while the Panics covered &quot;Lazy Itis&quot; for &quot;Cruel Guards&quot; (2007).

<text>The Hawaii State Judiciary is the official name of the judicial system of Hawaii in the United States. Based in Honolulu, the Hawaii State Judiciary is a unified state court system that functions under the Chief Justice of the Hawaii State Supreme Court who is its administrator-in-chief.

==Principal courts==
The Hawaii State judiciary has four levels; two at the trial level and two at the appellate level. The trial-level courts are the district court, for lesser offenses and minor civil cases, and circuit court, for more serious offenses and major civil cases. There are two appellate courts, the Intermediate Court of Appeals, the lower appellate court, and the Supreme Court, for appeals from the decision of the Intermediate Court via certiorari, and for certain cases, such as election cases, over which it exercises original jurisdiction.

The specific roles and names of the courts are as follows:

* The Hawaii State Supreme Court is the state supreme court. It is the high court of the state and makes binding decisions over appeals from the lower courts upon transfer from the Intermediate Court of Appeals and cases eligible to be heard directly by the Hawaii Supreme Court. It is also responsible for court rules, licensing and disciplining attorneys.
* The Hawaii Intermediate Court of Appeals is the state&#x27;s intermediate appellate court. It reviews appeals from state trial court or administrative agency decisions. Its decisions, under certain circumstances, are subject to the Hawai`i Supreme Court&#x27;s review.
* The primary civil and criminal court in Hawaii is the body known as the Hawaii state circuit courts. They rule all jury trial cases and have exclusive jurisdiction over probate, guardianship and criminal felony cases as well as civil cases where the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000.
* The Hawaii State family courts deal with family law. They have exclusive jurisdiction over cases with minors involving delinquency, status offenses, abuse and neglect, termination of parental rights, adoption guardianships and detention among others. The Family Courts also oversee cases of domestic relations, include divorce, child support, and custody cases.
* The Hawaii state district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over traffic infractions, landlord-tenant disputes, civil bench trials cases where the amount in controversy is under $10,000, civil cases where claim does not exceed $25,000, criminal offenses punishable by fine or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, county-ordinance cases and petitions for restraining orders. The Hawaii State Small Claims Court is a division of district court dealing with small claims.
* The Hawaii Land Court has exclusive jurisdiction over cases involving land titles and is a part of circuit court.
* The Hawaii State Tax Appeal Court has jurisdiction over cases involving property, excise, liquor, tobacco, income and insurance taxes, and is a part of circuit court.

<text>Within industry, piping is a system of pipes used to convey fluids (liquids and gases) from one location to another. The engineering discipline of piping design studies the efficient transport of fluid.

Industrial process piping (and accompanying in-line components) can be manufactured from wood, fiberglass, glass, steel, aluminum, plastic, copper, and concrete. The in-line components, known as fittings, valves, and other devices, typically sense and control the pressure, flow rate and temperature of the transmitted fluid, and usually are included in the field of piping design (or piping engineering), though the sensors and automatic controlling devices may alternatively be treated as part of instrumentation and control design. Piping systems are documented in piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&amp;IDs). If necessary, pipes can be cleaned by the tube cleaning process.

&quot;Piping&quot; sometimes refers to piping design, the detailed specification of the physical piping layout within a process plant or commercial building. In earlier days, this was sometimes called drafting, technical drawing, engineering drawing, and design, but is today commonly performed by designers that have learned to use automated computer-aided drawing or computer-aided design (CAD) software.

Plumbing is a piping system with which most people are familiar, as it constitutes the form of fluid transportation that is used to provide potable water and fuels to their homes and businesses. Plumbing pipes also remove waste in the form of sewage, and allow venting of sewage gases to the outdoors. Fire sprinkler systems also use piping, and may transport nonpotable or potable water, or other fire-suppression fluids.

Piping also has many other industrial applications, which are crucial for moving raw and semi-processed fluids for refining into more useful products. Some of the more exotic materials used in pipe construction are Inconel, titanium, chrome-moly and various other steel alloys.

==Engineering sub-fields==
Generally, industrial piping engineering has three major sub-fields:
*Piping material
*Piping design
*Stress analysis

==Stress analysis==
Process piping and power piping are typically checked by pipe stress engineers to verify that the routing, nozzle loads, hangers, and supports are properly placed and selected such that allowable pipe stress is not exceeded under different loads such as sustained loads, operating loads, pressure testing loads, etc., as stipulated by the ASME B31, EN 13480, GOST 32388, RD 10-249 or any other applicable codes and standards. It is necessary to evaluate the mechanical behavior of the piping under regular loads (internal pressure and thermal stresses) as well under occasional and intermittent loading cases such as earthquake, high wind or special vibration, and water hammer. This evaluation is usually performed with the assistance of a specialized (finite element) pipe stress analysis computer programs such as AutoPIPE, CAEPIPE, CAESAR, PASS/START-PROF, or ROHR2.

In cryogenic pipe supports, most steel become more brittle as the temperature decreases from normal operating conditions, so it is necessary to know the temperature distribution for cryogenic conditions. Steel structures will have areas of high stress that may be caused by sharp corners in the design, or inclusions in the material. When 3D pipe stress is analyzed, it (3D Pipes) will be considered as 3D beams with supports on both sides. Moreover, the 3D pipe stress determines the bending moments of the pipes. Allowable (ASME) Pipe grades permitted for Oil and gas industries are : Carbon Steel Pipes and tubes (A53 Grade [A &amp; B], A106 Grade [B &amp; C]), Low &amp; Intermediate alloy steel Pipes (A333 Grade [6], A335 Grade [P5, P9, P11, P12, P91])

==Materials==
The material with which a pipe is manufactured often forms as the basis for choosing any pipe. Materials that are used for manufacturing pipes include:

*Carbon steel
*ASTM A252 Spec Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3 Steel Pile Pipe
*Plastic piping, e.g. HDPE pipe, PE-X pipe, PP-R pipe or LDPE pipe.
*Low temperature service carbon steel
*Stainless steel
*Nonferrous metals, e.g. cupro-nickel, tantalum lined, etc.
*Nonmetallic, e.g. tempered glass, Teflon lined, PVC, etc.

== History==

Early wooden pipes were constructed out of logs that had a large hole bored lengthwise through the center. Later wooden pipes were constructed with staves and hoops similar to wooden barrel construction. Stave pipes have the advantage that they are easily transported as a compact pile of parts on a wagon and then assembled as a hollow structure at the job site. Wooden pipes were especially popular in mountain regions where transport of heavy iron or concrete pipes would have been difficult.

Wooden pipes were easier to maintain than metal, because the wood did not expand or contract with temperature changes as much as metal and so consequently expansion joints and bends were not required. The thickness of wood afforded some insulating properties to the pipes which helped prevent freezing as compared to metal pipes. Wood used for water pipes also does not rot very easily. Electrolysis does not affect wood pipes at all, since wood is a much better electrical insulator.

In the Western United States where redwood was used for pipe construction, it was found that redwood had &quot;peculiar properties&quot; that protected it from weathering, acids, insects, and fungus growths. Redwood pipes stayed smooth and clean indefinitely while iron pipe by comparison would rapidly begin to scale and corrode and could eventually plug itself up with the corrosion.

<text>Furtwangen im Schwarzwald (; Low Alemannic: &quot;Furtwange im Schwarzwald&quot;) is a small city located in the Black Forest region of southwestern Germany. Together with Villingen-Schwenningen, Furtwangen is part of the district (German: Kreis) of Schwarzwald-Baar.

== Geography ==
Furtwangen is located in the Southern Black Forest Nature Park in the Southeastern Black Forest, around 25 kilometers west of the district town of Villingen-Schwenningen and around 27 kilometers northeast of Freiburg.

Furtwangen is the highest town in Baden-Württemberg. Between 850 m and 1,150 m above sea level, it lies in the upper Bregtal of the Central Black Forest in the headwaters of the Danube. The Breg is a small stream which, coming from the mountainous areas around Furtwangen, flows down through the inner city to the east. The Breg is one of the two little rivers which unite to form the river Danube.

The population of Furtwangen comprises around 10,000 inhabitants .

== History ==
Furtwangen gained the right to call itself a city in 1873. It was not the first time that Furtwangen applied for city rights. After all, in 1833, the village already had 2,292 inhabitants and 2,470 in 1840. The previous attempts had always failed because Furtwangen had no town hall, although higher administrative levels had already warned the building several times.

=== Coat of arms ===
The coat of arms is mainly in silver. It depicts a red castle ruin on green ground with silver openings, surrounded by two green fir trees.

=== Clockmaking ===
Furtwangen owes its economic boom to the clock, which reached the Black Forest in the 17th century and brought the region an unexpected boom in the 18th century. The founding of the watchmaking school in 1850 was the expression and motor of this development. Its first rector Robert Gerwig also achieved fame as one of the builders of the Black Forest Railway. The trade association, to which the city also owes the establishment of the Sparkasse, gave the impetus to establish the watchmaking school. Today&#x27;s Furtwangen University of Applied Sciences developed from the watchmaking school.

After the city elevation in 1873, industrialization began in Furtwangen through the watch industry. Large companies such as Baduf, Furtwängler and Siedle emerged. In total, they provided 2,000 jobs. At the turn of the century, the Furtwang industry was at its peak. The traffic conditions were improved by the Bregtalbahn, which opened in 1893.

Emilian Wehrle (1832–1896) made musical clocks in the Furtwangen-Schönenbach area from about 1857 until his death in 1896. These musical clocks included the Trumpeter clock, Flute clock, Singing Bird Clock, and Rooster Clock. These clocks call the hour with the sound of the trumpet, flute, song bird and rooster respectively.

== Culture and tourism ==
The German Clock Museum exhibits more than 8,000 items related to clocks and clockmaking. The museum&#x27;s history dates back to 1852, when Robert Gerwig, Director of the &quot;Grand Ducal Baden Clockmaking School&quot; in Furtwangen, began to collect old clocks as witnesses of traditional handicrafts. In 1978, the &quot;Historic Clock Collection&quot; is renamed into the &quot;German Clock Museum&quot;.

The Hexenloch Mill was built in 1825. It has been in the family since 1839. The mill was built as a sawmill, its wheels are driven by the water from the hay stream (approx. 300 litres/second). The large water wheel (4m diameter, 13 HP) is the drive of a high-speed and a circular saw which are still functional today.

== Education ==
The University of Applied Sciences Furtwangen was founded in 1850. It specialises in microelectronics, precision mechanics, computer sciences, informatics, digital media, industrial technologies, medical and life sciences, mechanical and medical engineering etc.

== Infrastructure ==
Strongly frequented by traffic is the &quot;B 500&quot; (Bundesstraße 500) road which is also commonly known as the black forest &quot;Panoramastraße&quot;. In 1972, the railway connection called &quot;Bregtalbahn&quot; was closed after 80 years of service. The railway track had led from Furtwangen to Donaueschingen.

<text>Pills &#x27;n&#x27; Thrills and Bellyaches is the third studio album by the English rock band Happy Mondays, released on 5 November 1990 by Factory Records. Disc jockey (DJ) Paul Oakenfold and collaborator Steve Osborne were previously enlisted by the band for remixes. The success of these led to the pair producing &quot;Step On&quot;, a cover of the John Kongos song, for Happy Mondays. The band went on a tour of the United States, and by the end of which, had started recording their next album with Oakenfold and Osborne at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles, California. They returned to the United Kingdom, where further recording took place at Eden Studios in London until September 1990. Described as a Madchester album, &quot;Pills &#x27;n&#x27; Thrills and Bellyaches&quot; saw substantial input from Oakenfold and Osborne, with the former making loops while the latter handled song arrangements.

The release of &quot;Pills &#x27;n&#x27; Thrills and Bellyaches&quot; was aided by a distribution and licensing deal between Factory Records and major label London Recordings. &quot;Kinky Afro&quot; was released as the second single from the album on 8 October 1990; the album was promoted with an arena tour in the UK, with support from Donovan, to close out the year. Preceded by festival appearances in the UK and Brazil, &quot;Loose Fit&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s third single in February 1991. Treks in mainland Europe and the US followed over the course of the next three months. After this, touring continued into August 1991 across a variety of festival performances and headlining shows.

&quot;Pills &#x27;n&#x27; Thrills and Bellyaches&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics, several of whom considered it the band&#x27;s creative peak. It peaked at number four on the UK Albums Chart, as well as charting in Austria, New Zealand, and Sweden. The album went on to sell 400,000 copies in the UK, where it was certified platinum. &quot;Step On&quot; reached the top five in the UK (where it would be certified gold) and appeared on several &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in the US. &quot;Kinky Afro&quot; had similar success, also reaching the top five in the UK (where it would be certified silver). &quot;Loose Fit&quot; charted in the UK top 20; &quot;Bob&#x27;s Yer Uncle&quot; peaked within the top 30 on two US charts. &quot;Pills &#x27;n&#x27; Thrills and Bellyaches&quot; appeared on album of the year and best of decade lists by &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;NME,&quot; and &quot;Select&quot;.

==Background==
Happy Mondays released their second studio album, &quot;Bummed&quot;, which was produced by Martin Hannett, in November 1988. To promote it, the band supported James and Pixies on separate tours as well as headlining treks of their own in the United Kingdom. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Wrote for Luck&quot;, became the defining track of the acid house era. Scott Plagenhoef of &quot;Stylus&quot; considered the album &quot;the perfect summation of the 1988 British Summer of Love&quot;. &quot;Wrote for Luck&quot; was remixed by DJ Paul Oakenfold, with assistance from Steve Osborne and Vince Clarke of Erasure. The remixes, under the name &quot;W.F.L.&quot;, appeared in September 1989, peaking at number 68 on the UK Singles Chart. Happy Mondays&#x27; second extended play (EP), &quot;Madchester Rave On,&quot; was released in November 1989, again produced by Hannett. It peaked at number 19 on the UK Singles Chart.

Oakenfold and Osborne were enlisted again to create remixes, which were successful commercially and critically. Around this time, the band appeared on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; with the Stone Roses, which acted as a catalyst for the Madchester scene. Relationships between band members became strained, while manager Nathan McGough spent more time partying than assisting them. Frontman Shaun Ryder was especially disconnected from the others, using heroin as a crutch. In February 1990, Happy Mondays&#x27; label in the United States, Elektra Records, picked them to contribute a cover for a 40th anniversary compilation album. Happy Mondays initially considered doing a Tom Waits track, until someone suggested John Kongos; they recorded Kongos&#x27; &quot;He&#x27;s Gonna Step on You Again&quot; (1971) at Eden Studios in London. At the suggestion of McGough, Oakenfold and Osborne produced the song, marking the first time either of them did so.

Unbeknownst to Happy Mondays, Oakenfold and Osborne added vocals from session vocalist Rowetta, who had met McGough some weeks earlier at the Haçienda in Manchester. As the band thought their cover would be wasted on the Elektra compilation, they gave the label a rendition of another Kongos song, &quot;Tokoloshe Man&quot; (1971). In March 1990, they embarked on a tour of mainland Europe, leading into two headlining shows at the GMEX Centre in Manchester. The band&#x27;s version of Kongos&#x27; track, shortened to &quot;Step On&quot;, was released as a single on 26 March 1990. The song&#x27;s music video was filmed while in Barcelona on the roof of a hotel with directors the Bailey Brothers. The band set up in a rehearsal room in Stretford to write material for their next album. Following this, the band headlined Glastonbury Festival and played a one-off show in Ibiza in June 1990. They embarked on a tour of the US in July 1990.

==Recording==
As the US tour came to a close in Los Angeles, California, the band decided to record their next album in the city. Shaun Ryder considered it an important break away from being constantly recognised in the UK, which the rest of the band agreed with. Other recording locations had been floated and declined, such as in Amsterdam and Barbados. An extra US show was scheduled but cancelled in order for the members to get into the right head space for recording. Due to the success of &quot;Step On&quot;, Oakenfold and Osborne had been earmarked to produce Happy Mondays&#x27; next release sometime prior. Elektra and Factory Records, the band&#x27;s UK label, booked the band to record at Capitol Studios. Upon entering it, the band had a week&#x27;s time to record the seven new songs they had; they convinced both labels to extend recording by three weeks. Oakenfold and Osborne sorted through the various demos the band had given the pair, picking the ones that would work well and those that would not.

As the band would hang out with Mancunian and Liverpudlian people from acid house club nights in the area, the strained relationships were sedated. They stayed at the Oakwood Apartments with their girlfriends and wives. Recording started on 23 July 1990; the sessions would begin at midday and conclude by midnight, lasting for six days per week, with engineer Ray Blair and studio assistant Cameron. Bassist Paul Ryder and drummer Gary Whelan would record their parts together, while the others would record theirs separately to avoid cabin fever. The first track they recorded was &quot;Kinky Afro&quot;, with bass and drums that Osborne laboured over to get a certain baggy sound. Whelan would often record drum loops and record new parts on top of them. A similar instance saw Whelan play over loops that Oakenfold made by scratching his records on &quot;God&#x27;s Cop&quot;. Due to Bez&#x27;s lacklustre skills as a percussionist, session musician Tony Castro was brought in by Blair to contribute to &quot;Loose Fit&quot; and &quot;Bob&#x27;s Yer Uncle&quot;.

Spurred on by the laidback nature of the sessions, the band attempted a cover of &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Talkin&#x27;&quot; (1966) by Fred Neil. With the guidance of Oakenfold, they kept the feel of the song while scrapping everything else, eventually causing the band to write &quot;Bob&#x27;s Yer Uncle&quot;. Shaun Ryder would attempt to get out of recording vocals frequently, claiming he was not in the right mood. Osborne had to talk him into the idea. As Osbourne learned from working on &quot;Step On&quot;, Ryder was &quot;not somebody who is a super-confident vocalist. Doing vocals for Shaun [Ryder] is not an easy thing&quot;. Ryder would subsequently only do vocals when Osborne was in the control room, aside from the occasional visit from Whelan. Factory founder Tony Wilson visited the band, fearing they would have spent the entirety of recording partying instead of working. Upon hearing a version of &quot;Bob&#x27;s Yer Uncle&quot;, he exclaimed that the band&#x27;s next release would be &quot;one of the great British albums of the age&quot;. The band flew home on 25 August 1990; one-by-one, each member did further work on the songs at Eden Studios, where Rowetta did guest vocals. Recording concluded by September 1990; Oakenfold and Osborne mixed the final tracks with assistant engineer Dave Burnham.

==Composition and lyrics==
Musically, the sound of &quot;Pills &#x27;n&#x27; Thrills and Bellyaches&quot; has been described as Madchester. According to the writer John Harris, it is slicker than &quot;Bummed&quot; and makes the band&#x27;s affinities with acid house more explicit, mixing guitar and bass with &quot;precise and pristine keyboard sounds&quot; and drums that are &quot;as crisp as on any house record&quot;. With the title, Shaun Ryder said the band wanted a &quot;mature, a rock classic title, but we thought fuck it, just give it something that everyone&#x27;s expecting&quot;. Oakenfold and Osborne had more input into the music than other people would, as the band trusted them. Oakenfold said Osborne had a bigger role in the overall sound of the album due to being a multi-instrumentalist. The former focused on making loops, while the latter tackled song arrangements with synthesisers and keyboards. All of the songs&#x27; sound is buoyed by Paul Ryder&#x27;s bass parts, which Osborne felt were important to the band&#x27;s dynamic. He had a laissez-faire attitude to his performances, even letting Osborne play bass on one track. Osborne felt guitarist Mark Day&#x27;s parts anchored a lot of the songs, often setting the tone for them. They initially wanted &quot;Tokoloshe Man&quot; (1971), another Kongos cover, on the album, but were denied it when they contributed it to Elektra&#x27;s anniversary compilation in lieu of &quot;Step On&quot;.

Shaun Ryder wrote the lyrics to the songs while in his apartment in Los Angeles, fueled by opium. The album opens with &quot;Kinky Afro&quot;, an ode to fatherhood and Ryder&#x27;s father, Derek. The song&#x27;s music is partially influenced by Paul Ryder listening to Hot Chocolate, namely their song &quot;Brother Louie&quot; (1973). Shaun Ryder took one of its lines for &quot;Kinky Afro&quot;; despite comparisons to &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; (1974) by Labelle, he claimed the song&#x27;s vocal hook was taken from the film &quot;Die Hard&quot; (1988). The song was initially called &quot;Groovy Afro&quot;, but was changed after &quot;Groovy Train&quot; (1990) by the Farm was released sometime prior. &quot;God&#x27;s Cop&quot; is inspired by James Anderton, the chief constable of the Greater Manchester Police, who claimed God was speaking to him. It opens with a slide guitar part, leading into a delta blues riff that is heard throughout the rest of the track; it is backed by a drum loop of &quot;Me Myself and I&quot; (1989) by De La Soul. &quot;Donovan&quot;, which musically retreads &quot;Mad Cyril&quot; from &quot;Bummed&quot;, was written after the band was listening to Donovan&#x27;s back catalogue while touring the US. It borrows a lyric from Donovan&#x27;s &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot; (1966).

&quot;Loose Fit&quot; is the result of jamming between Paul Ryder and Oakenfold; the song describes how one approaches life. In addition to this, some of the lyrics talk about the Gulf War and its events being reported on TV. &quot;Grandbag&#x27;s Funeral&quot; is centered around a guitar riff, reminiscent of the one heard in &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; (1974) by David Bowie. &quot;Dennis and Lois&quot; is named after a couple the band befriended upon visiting New York City for the first time. It includes a reference to &quot;The Profession of Violence&quot; by John Pearson, a book about the Kray twins. The music was influenced by &quot;Superstition&quot; (1972) by Stevie Wonder. &quot;Bob&#x27;s Yer Uncle&quot; is about dirty talking during sex, the music of which was influenced by the theme song to &quot;Daktari&quot;, according to Ryder. It includes a line from &quot;Why Did You Do It?&quot; (1975) by Stretch and samples a clarinet part from a Michael Nyman composition. The track originally had extracts from &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973) and numerous pornographic films that were removed before the album was released.

Kongos&#x27; &quot;Step On&quot; is a protest song that deals with white people&#x27;s appropriation of land in Africa. Happy Mondays&#x27; version opens with an Italo house piano, followed by a funk shuffle. Shaun Ryder ad-libbed various lines, such as &quot;Call the cops&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re twisting my melon man&quot;. The former was a catchphrase of a Haçienda patron, while the latter was taken from a line of dialogue in &quot;Man on the Edge&quot;, a documentary about Steve McQueen. Ryder had guessed some of the lyrics as he did not have a lyric sheet in front of him, which he re-recorded after learning what they were. &quot;Holiday&quot; incorporates a portion of &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; (1973) by the Velvet Underground, as well as &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Holiday&quot; (1980) by Change. Ryder wrote the song about issues he faced when dealing with customs officers. For &quot;Harmony&quot;, Ryder attempted to get Whelan to sing the track in the same manner that the Beatles would get their drummer Ringo Starr to sing a song. The song describes being high on the rave drug ecstasy. It lifts a lyric from &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Teach the World to Sing (In Perfect Harmony)&quot; (1971) by the New Seekers.

==Release==
McGough set about making Happy Mondays&#x27; next album a success; he was concerned with Factory&#x27;s ad hoc licencing agreements, finding it difficult to obtain sales numbers from Rough Trade Records in Germany. With an advance from Wilson, McGough set up a distribution and licencing deal with major label London Recordings, which would promote the album throughout the European continent. BMG had turned down an offer to distribute the band due to their &quot;interests outside of their musical output&quot;. During this time, the UK press noted a decline in the popularity of the Madchester scene. McGough wanted &quot;Kinky Afro&quot; as the next single, while Wilson aimed for &quot;Loose Fit&quot;. &quot;Kinky Afro&quot; was ultimately released as the second single from the album on 8 October 1990. A radio mix and a live version of the same song were included as B-sides. The music video for the song, directed by the Bailey Brothers, was filmed at Granada Studios. It shows the band being surrounded by dancing female models, one of whom was Whelan&#x27;s girlfriend.

&quot;Pills &#x27;n&#x27; Thrills and Bellyaches&quot; was released on 5 November 1990. The cover, done by Central Station Design, consists of American sweet wrappers, with the band&#x27;s name and the album&#x27;s title laid on top in cartoon lettering. Matthew Robertson wrote in his book &quot;Factory Records: The Complete Graphic Album&quot; (2006) that it blends ephemera from Los Angeles, where the album was recorded, and London, where it was mixed. Factory Records paid for Central Station Design to visit Los Angeles for a week while the band was in the midst of recording there in order to gather the materials that would end up on the final artwork. These pieces were used in the lettering, while pieces from London were used for the background. When the album was issued in the US, later in the month, the artwork was changed because of fears of being sued for copyright infringement. A launch party was held at the London Zoo on the same day as its UK release. The following week, on 12 November 1990, the band released the video album &quot;Call the Cops&quot;, which consisted of footage shot on their tour of the US. The band promoted &quot;Pills &#x27;n&#x27; Thrills and Bellyaches&quot; with an arena tour in the United Kingdom in November and December 1990, with support from Donovan, whom the band had met earlier in the year. Happy Mondays started in 1991 with appearances at the Great British Music Weekend festival in the UK and Rock in Rio 2 in Brazil. Both performances were lambasted by audience members; the latter was nearly abandoned due to rain, though the band continued playing despite being told they might get electrocuted.

A new music video was filmed for &quot;Step On&quot; on 12 January 1991 in London, directed by Jean-Baptiste Mondino. It was intended to coincide with a re-release of the song in the US. Originally planned for 18 February 1991, &quot;Loose Fit&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s third single on 25 February 1991. Wilson decided on it, though the band wanted &quot;God&#x27;s Cop&quot; as their next release. &quot;Bob&#x27;s Yer Uncle&quot; and a remix of &quot;Kinky Afro&quot; appeared as the B-sides to &quot;Loose Fit&quot;. Remixes of &quot;Loose Fit&quot; and &quot;Bob&#x27;s Yer Uncle&quot;, done by the Grid, were released on a 12&quot; vinyl, being retitled &quot;Loose Fix&quot; and &quot;Bob&#x27;s Yer Tune&quot;, respectively. The single, along with its music video, was delayed due to needing to remove lyrics about the Gulf War. Robertson said the song has a &quot;very dark and sinister subtext&quot; to it, and as such, Central Station Design &quot;set about capturing this idea by composing a murkier experience&quot; for its front artwork. The back cover features burned fat to &quot;simulate burnt, bubbling human flesh [which] was used to suggest the violence of warfare&quot;. Following this, they went on a tour of mainland Europe, which lasted until March 1991. It took into account the territories that London Recordings released the album in, in an effort to build a fan base in those counties.

Upon arriving back in the UK, the band performed &quot;Loose Fit&quot; on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Later in March 1991, the band returned to the US, where they toured for two months. A few of the shows were criticized by the press for their short length, often only playing for 50 minutes. The New York City date of the tour, on 24 April 1991, saw the band support Jane&#x27;s Addiction. Around this date, &quot;Bob&#x27;s Yer Uncle&quot; was released as the next single from the album instead of the planned &quot;Step On&quot; reissue. McGough had wanted Elektra to release &quot;God&#x27;s Cop&quot; or &quot;Loose Fit&quot; to capitalise on the band&#x27;s US shows. Senior management at Elektra caught wind of the band&#x27;s short sets and them cancelling or not showing up to promotional meet and greet events and decided to stop pushing the band in the US. Around the same time, contemporaries the Charlatans had returned to the UK from their own US tour, marking the end of the Madchester scene trying to break the US. Exhausted from the trek, Happy Mondays cancelled the last few shows in order to rest in Texas. A series of headlining shows and festival performances took place between May and August 1991.

===Reissues and related releases===
Happy Mondays released their first live album in 1991, titled &quot;Live&quot;, which was recorded during a Leeds show earlier that year. It was previously released as an official bootleg under the name &quot;Baby Big Head&quot;, which drew comparisons to the Who&#x27;s &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; (1970). Wilson was fine with the band self-releasing the bootleg; the band&#x27;s motivation for doing so in the first place stemmed from Factory owing the band around £100,000 in royalties. Rhino Records reissued &quot;Pills &#x27;n&#x27; Thrills and Bellyaches&quot; as a two-disc set in 2007, with bonus tracks and a DVD of the band&#x27;s music videos. In 2012, daily newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave readers a free copy of the album in each newspaper. It was included in Rhino Records&#x27; &quot;Original Album Series&quot; box set in 2013, which collected Happy Mondays&#x27; first four studio albums. The album was re-pressed on vinyl in 2020.

&quot;Kinky Afro&quot; and remixes of &quot;Loose Fit&quot;, &quot;Bob&#x27;s Yer Uncle&quot;, and &quot;Step On&quot; appeared on Happy Mondays&#x27; first compilation album, &quot;Double Easy – The U.S. Singles&quot; (1993). &quot;Loose Fit&quot;, &quot;Bob&#x27;s Yer Uncle&quot;, &quot;Step On&quot;, and a remix of &quot;Kinky Afro&quot; were included on their second compilation album &quot;Loads&quot; (1995). &quot;Kinky Afro&quot;, &quot;Loose Fit&quot;, &quot;Bob&#x27;s Yer Uncle&quot;, &quot;Step On&quot;, and a remix of the latter appeared on the band&#x27;s third compilation album, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (1999). &quot;Bob&#x27;s Yer Uncle&quot; and &quot;Step On&quot; appeared on their fourth compilation album, &quot;The Platinum Collection&quot; (2005). &quot;Kinky Afro&quot;, &quot;God&#x27;s Cop&quot;, &quot;Loose Fit&quot;, &quot;Dennis and Lois&quot;, &quot;Bob&#x27;s Yer Uncle&quot;, and &quot;Step On&quot; were included on the band&#x27;s fifth compilation album, &quot;Double Double Good: The Best of Happy Mondays&quot; (2012).

==Critical reception==
Several writers praised the writing of &quot;Pills &#x27;n&#x27; Thrills and Bellyaches&quot;. Stuart Maconie of &quot;NME&quot; hailed it as &quot;a tremendous record, and a gauntlet chucked at the feet of all the other would-be legends in town.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Jonathan Gold said any person with a &quot;degree can tell you about pop’s post-modern condition, the simultaneous existence of all forms of music at once, but you rarely hear it expressed like this on a single record&quot;. The staff at &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; praised the band for being &quot;more forward-thinking, diverse and downright &quot;interesting&quot; [on this album] than most would have imagined from previous dour efforts.&quot; &quot;Select&quot; Andrew Harrison referred to it as &quot;ludicrously, expansively, &quot;stupidly&quot; excellent&quot;, going on to praise Oakenfold&#x27;s DJ pedigree, which the &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; staff also did.

Other reviewers were less receptive to the album. Simon Reynolds, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called it a &quot;perplexing mishmash&quot; that can alienate listeners outside of Manchester&#x27;s rave scene &quot;because it&#x27;s designed to confuse and repel outsiders.&quot; In a less enthusiastic review, Bob Mack of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said that apart from &quot;Step On&quot; and &quot;Donovan&quot;, the album shows that the band is less interesting than their Madchester contemporaries and does not warrant comparisons to the Rolling Stones. &quot;Jornal do Brasil&quot; Arthur Dapieve called it disappointing, stating that the titles of the songs match the monotony of their sound. In a review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, critic Robert Christgau cited &quot;Grandbag&#x27;s Funeral&quot; and &quot;Kinky Afro&quot; as highlights but stated that &quot;their Voidoids is hotter than their &#x27;dance music.

Retrospective reviews were highly positive. In a review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine called &quot;Pills &#x27;n&#x27; Thrills and Bellyaches&quot; a hedonistic album that was the peak of Happy Mondays&#x27; &quot;career (and quite arguably the whole baggy/Madchester movement) ... a celebratory collage of sex, drugs, and dead-end jobs where there&#x27;s no despair because only a sucker could think that this party would ever come to an end&quot;. The staff at &quot;Q&quot; magazine called it their &quot;artistic peak&quot; and a &quot;top-hole album&quot;, while the staff at &quot;PopMatters&quot; saw the album as the band&#x27;s &quot;masterpiece&quot;, dubbing it the &quot;&quot;Ulysses&quot; of modern rock music — the rock album that didn’t just question what rock music is, but ignored what rock music is&quot;. BBC Music reviewer Daryl Easlea wrote that the album &quot;all gets a bit much toward the end, but no matter, what a hoot it is on the way there&quot;. Edward Sharp-Paul of &quot;FasterLouder&quot; said the band&#x27;s tracks &quot;still lived or died depending on whether the tone-deaf waster out front could think of something halfway coherent to mumble about.&quot; Writing for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Ian Cohen lauded the album as a &quot;masterpiece that reinvented post-punk for the rave era&quot;, which &quot;remains eternally alluring for any musical movement trying to balance drugs, thugs, and hugs, all raving under one roof.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Pills &#x27;n&#x27; Thrills and Bellyaches&quot; had 150,000 pre-orders. It peaked at number four on the UK Albums Chart, selling 400,000 copies after spending 28 consecutive weeks on the chart. It was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in March 1991. It also charted at number 27 in New Zealand, number 30 in Austria, number 41 in Sweden, number 89 in the US, and number 98 in Australia. &quot;The Quietus&quot; have referred to it as the band&#x27;s &quot;dance-rock breakthrough&quot;.

&quot;Step On&quot; charted at number five in the UK and number 46 in the Netherlands. In the US, it reached number 57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, as well as number nine on Alternative Airplay, number 13 on Dance Club Songs, number 46 on Dance Singles Sales, It was certified gold by the BPI in May 2021. &quot;Kinky Afro&quot; charted at number five in the UK and number 34 in New Zealand. It peaked at number one in the US on Alternative Airplay. It was certified silver by the BPI in September 2022. &quot;Loose Fit&quot; charted at number 17 in the UK and number 71 in the Netherlands. &quot;Bob&#x27;s Yer Uncle&quot; peaked at number 23 in the US on Alternative Airplay and number 25 on Dance Club Songs.

==Accolades and legacy==
Oakenfold and Osborne were nominated for, but ultimately lost, the British Producer of the Year award at the 1991 Brits for their work on &quot;Pills &#x27;n&#x27; Thrills and Bellyaches&quot;. The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; (2006).

Dave Simpson of &quot;Uncut&quot; said the band&#x27;s decision to work with Oakenfold and Osborne &quot;inspired everything from U2&#x27;s &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; and The Prodigy&#x27;s &#x27;Firestarter&#x27; to Blur&#x27;s hooking up with William Orbit and Suede aligning themselves&quot; with Osborne. Ian Cohen suggested in &quot;Pitchfork&quot; that &quot;Pills &#x27;n&#x27; Thrills and Bellyaches&quot; was &quot;perhaps the first example of a rock band reinventing themselves as a sampledelic hip-hop act.&quot; In a retrospective piece for &quot;DJ Mag&quot;, journalist Ben Cardew said tracks such as &quot;Kinky Afro&quot;, &quot;Loose Fit&quot;, and &quot;God&#x27;s Cop&quot; erased the &quot;genre distinctions between rock, funk, soul, and dance music, making it sound perfectly natural for a band raised in rainy Manchester to create sunshine funk music.&quot; Author Richard Luck said in his book &quot;The Madchester Scene&quot; (2002) that while the album was &quot;[n]either as coherent nor as polished&quot; as the Stone Roses&#x27; eponymous debut studio album, it stood as one of the most important albums from the time period &quot;if only because of Ryder&#x27;s songwriting and the heady mix of high times and low lives that infuses every track&quot;. In 2015, the band performed the album in its entirety on a UK tour to celebrate its 25th anniversary. They repeated this feat in Australia in 2019. Dzidziuś I Diabeł covered &quot;Loose Fit&quot; for their album &quot;Impreza&quot; (1993), while Hawke included a remix of &quot;Bob&#x27;s Yer Uncle&quot; on his album &quot;+++&quot; (2009).

<doc id="770557" wikidata="Q5025079" url="?curid=770557" title="Cambie Street">
<text>Cambie Street is a street in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is named for Henry John Cambie, chief surveyor of the Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s western division (as is Cambie Road, a major thoroughfare in nearby Richmond).

There are two distinct sections of the street. North of False Creek, the street runs on a northeast–southwest alignment (following the rotated street grid within Downtown Vancouver). As such, the street direction is approximately 45 degrees to that of the Cambie Bridge, and there is no seamless connection between the two. Instead, Nelson Street carries southbound traffic onto the bridge, and Smithe Street carries northbound traffic away from the bridge. The downtown section of Cambie Street runs from Water Street in Gastown in the north to Pacific Boulevard in Yaletown in the south and is a two-way street for its length.

South of False Creek, the street is a major six-lane arterial road, and runs as a two-way north–south thoroughfare according to the street grid for the rest of Vancouver. This section of the street was originally named Bridge Street, and was first connected to Cambie Street after the first Cambie Bridge opened in 1891; it was renamed Cambie Street after the second Cambie Bridge opened in 1912.

Between King Edward Avenue West and Southwest Marine Drive, the street has a 10 metre wide boulevard with grass and many well established trees on it; the boulevard was designated as a heritage landscape by the city of Vancouver in 1993.

==Canada Line construction==

When proposals to build SkyTrain&#x27;s Canada Line (formerly known as the Richmond-Airport-Vancouver or RAV Line) along Cambie Street first emerged, they were heavily protested by residents and business owners who wanted to keep the street as a heritage boulevard. They argued in favour of using the existing Arbutus Street rail corridor instead.

Once the decision was made to use the Cambie alignment for the Canada Line anyway, residents along the corridor successfully persuaded authorities to put the rail line in a tunnel instead of running it as a surface route, and to dig the tunnel using a tunnel boring machine. However, due to cost concerns and time constraints, the winning bidder decided to use a cut-and-cover method to build the tunnel – which required disruption to traffic and business along the corridor during the construction. As such, even though it cost less and was much faster than using a tunnel boring machine, the plan drew heavy criticism from area residents and businesses.

During 2006 to 2009, portions of the street south of False Creek were closed to traffic to allow for construction of the line. The cut-and-cover tunnel runs underneath the east side of the street for most of its route. South of West 63rd Avenue, the line emerges from the tunnel and runs on an elevated structure across the Fraser River.

Gregor Robertson, who later became the mayor of Vancouver, was a strong supporter of Cambie Street merchants and spoke regularly about hardships from the Canada Line construction. He called the handling of the rail line construction an &quot;injustice.&quot;

On March 23, 2009, Robertson testified in a lawsuit brought by Cambie Street merchant Susan Heyes, owner of Hazel &amp; Co., in the B.C. Supreme Court regarding damage to her business from the construction, a lawsuit for which she was awarded $600,000 by the B.C. Supreme Court due in part to the fact that there was insufficient action to mitigate the effects of Canada Line construction on Cambie Street merchants. The award for damages was later reversed at the British Columbia Court of Appeal, which determined that while the project had resulted in a legal nuisance to the claimant, the government had acted within its authority and was therefore not liable for damages. Leave for further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was subsequently denied. On the Canada Line&#x27;s opening day of August 17, 2009, Robertson said Greater Vancouver needed more rapid transit but the Canada Line was a &quot;great start&quot; and that he was a &quot;Johnny-come-lately&quot; to the project.

<text>Lorena Herrera de la Vega (born in Mazatlán, Sinaloa, Mexico), known professionally as Lorena Herrera, is a Mexican singer and actress.

== Biography ==
Lorena moved with her family to Mexico City, where she began a career as a fashion model. She became highly successful in Mexico, and gained an international reputation, posing for advertisements in Mexico and South America. As a model, she won the &quot;Look of the Year&quot; contest, awarded in Mexico. 

Lorena then began working in Mexico&#x27;s low-budget films. She has been involved in more than seventy-five films since she began her career as an actress in soap operas.

She also has created six music albums, of which five are studio albums, and one is an album of remixes named &quot;Soy (Remix)&quot;, released in 1997.

For her work in the motion picture and recording industries as well as television, Herrera&#x27;s handprints were embedded onto the &quot;Paseo de las Luminarias&quot; in 2012.

== Soap opera ==
Lorena Herrera met producer Emilio Larrosa, who had Televisa connections. Larrosa gave her a chance to star in his telenovela production &quot;Muchachitas&quot;&quot; (&quot;Young Girls&quot;), which was a huge hit across Latin America.

She was then hired to participate in the mega-hit telenovela &quot;Dos Mujeres, un Camino&quot;, where she played the mistress of a villain.

Herrera has since acted in many other telenovelas, including &quot;El Premio Mayor&quot;. She is also a singer, having released various Mexican music CDs and toured Mexico and the United States. She has been approached by &quot;Playboy Mexico&quot; to pose nude for that magazine (she appeared in the Mexican &quot;Playboy&quot; in the December 1987 issue, under the name &quot;Bárbara Ferrat&quot;). She has also released various calendars in which she assumed sensual poses, and she posed naked for &quot;Playboy&quot; again in March 2011 at 44 years of age.

On the Univision show &quot;El Gordo y la Flaca&quot;, Lorena shared a bathtub with &quot;El Gordo&quot;, Raul De Molina.

She worked as the evil stepmother of Lola (Monserrat) in &quot;Lola...Erase Una Vez&quot;. She is the mother of Grettell Valdez which interprets Carlota in Lola and she is also the mother of Zoraida Gomez in the soap opera &quot;Lola&quot;.

She has said that she likes singing, but acting is her favorite activity.

She has worked with Carla Estrada, Emilio Larosa, Pedro Damian and other producers.

She said recently on the &quot;Mentiras y Verdades&quot; show that she did not like to make novelas with Emilio Larrosa after &quot;El Premio Mayor&quot; told her that her part was going to be the antagonist.

<doc id="770568" wikidata="Q386288" url="?curid=770568" title="Tanoan languages">
<text>Tanoan ( ), also Kiowa–Tanoan or Tanoan–Kiowa, is a family of languages spoken by indigenous peoples in present-day New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.

Most of the languages – Tiwa (Taos, Picuris, Southern Tiwa), Tewa, and Towa – are spoken in the Native American Pueblos of New Mexico (with one outlier in Arizona). These were the first languages collectively given the name of &quot;Tanoan.&quot; Kiowa, which is a related language, is now spoken mostly in southwestern Oklahoma. The Kiowa historically inhabited areas of modern-day Texas and Oklahoma.

==Languages==

The Tanoan language family has seven languages in four branches: 
Kiowa–Towa might form an intermediate branch, as might Tiwa–Tewa.

==Name==

Tanoan has long been recognized as a major family of Pueblo languages, consisting of Tiwa, Tewa, and Towa. The inclusion of Kiowa into the family was at first controversial given the cultural differences between those groups. The once-nomadic Kiowa people of the Plains are culturally quite distinct from the Tiwa, Tewa, and Towa pueblos, which obscured somewhat the linguistic connection between Tanoans and Kiowans. Linguists now accept that a Tanoan family without Kiowa would be paraphyletic, as any ancestor of the Pueblo languages would be ancestral to Kiowa as well. Kiowa may be closer to Towa than Towa is to Tiwa–Tewa. In older texts, &quot;Tanoan&quot; and &quot;Kiowa–Tanoan&quot; were used interchangeably. Because of the cultural use of the name &quot;Tanoan&quot; as signifying several peoples who share a culture, the more explicit term &quot;Kiowa–Tanoan&quot; is now commonly used for the language family as a whole, with Tanoan being the branch that contains the languages now spoken in New Mexico and Arizona (i.e. Arizona Tewa).

The prehistory of the Kiowa people is little known. As a result, the history is obscure about the separation of the members of this language family into two groups (&#x27;Puebloan&#x27; and &#x27;Plains&#x27;) with radically distinct lifestyles. There is apparently no oral tradition of any ancient connection between the peoples. Scholars have not determined when the peoples were connected so that the common linguistic elements could have developed. The earliest traditions and historical notices of the Kiowa record them migrating from the north and west, to the territory now associated with the tribal nation. Today this area is within the modern states of Texas and Oklahoma, which they occupied from the late 18th century.

==Historical phonology==

The chart below contains the consonants of the Tanoan proto-language as reconstructed by Hale (1967) based on consonant correspondences in stem-initial position.

The evidence for &#x27; comes from prefixes; &#x27; has not been found in stem-initial position and thus is in parentheses above. Hale reconstructs the nasalization feature for nasal vowels. Vowel quality and prosodic features like vowel length, tone, and stress have not yet been reconstructed for the Tanoan family. Hale (1967) gives certain sets of vowel quality correspondences.

The following table illustrates the reconstructed initial consonants in Proto-Tanoan and its reflexes in the daughter languages.

As can be seen in the above table, a number of phonological mergers have occurred in the different languages.
Cognate sets supporting the above are listed below:

<text>John Thrasher (February 24, 1818–November 13, 1899) was the founder of the city of Norcross, Georgia, an original pioneer of Atlanta, and a well-travelled entrepreneur throughout the American Southeast.

== Founding of Atlanta ==

In 1839, Thrasher was hired to do work on the terminus of the Western and Atlantic Railroad. His work crew lived in the area of what is now downtown Atlanta. During the construction Thrasher built homes for his workers and a general store. Nicknamed &quot;Thrasherville&quot; instead of its official name &quot;Terminus&quot; (given by the railroad), it was the first land development of the area. A historical marker of this now stands on Marietta Street, in front of the State Bar of Georgia, just down from where the Philips Arena stands in present times.

Thrasher himself purchased a large amount of land in Whitehall which is now the site of West End, a neighborhood of Atlanta just southwest of the city center. This area was originally supposed to have been the zero-mile marker of the railroad and Thrasher expected enough traffic generated to bring business to the grocery store he built and to spur development on his land. In 1842, Lemuel P. Grant, a railroad employee, donated land just northeast of Whitehall to the railroad and the terminus was moved. Thrasher was so disgusted by this that he sold his land at a significant loss and moved to Griffin, Georgia.

In 1844 Thrasher married and moved back to Atlanta opening another store on Peachtree Street. He became active in local politics and became a state legislator representing Fulton County. It wasn&#x27;t until after the American Civil War and the destruction of Atlanta that he became deeply involved in Atlanta politics. He was instrumental in opening Atlanta&#x27;s first jail, its first school, and its streetcars.

==Founding of Norcross==
In 1870 Thrasher moved northeast of the city along the Richmond and Danville Railroad and founded the town of Norcross, named after Thrasher&#x27;s good friend, Jonathan Norcross, the fourth mayor of Atlanta. He was also elected the city&#x27;s first mayor. Thrasher quickly turned Norcross into a vacation destination with a resort hotel he built. He was an active philanthropist in Norcross, a founder of First Baptist Church, a donor of houses to clergy and land for a park, now called Thrasher Park in downtown Norcross. A daily train ran between Norcross and Atlanta, perhaps the first commuter train in Georgia.

==Later life==
In 1878 his wanderlust struck again and he moved to Central, South Carolina, where he built a restaurant on the train line that went from Atlanta to Washington, D.C. In the late 1880s, Thrasher and his wife followed his sons to Dade City, Florida, where he grew oranges. He never abandoned the railroads however, and was instrumental in bringing the railroads to that town. He died in Dade City on Nov. 13, 1899.

Adding to Thrasher&#x27;s legacy are Robert and George Woodruff, the great-grandsons of his first cousin, Caroline Thrasher. Robert Woodruff was a famous Atlanta philanthropist and CEO of Coca-Cola from 1923 to 1939.

John J. Thrasher&#x27;s descendants have established the Thrasher Family Association, which holds an annual reunion and publishes a quarterly newsletter.

<text>wxBasic is a free software / open-source software, cross-platform BASIC interpreter. As it is based on syntax of the BASIC language, it is designed to be simple to learn and understand, and allow novice programmers to write applications for graphical environments like Windows and Linux with minimal effort. wxBasic is a bytecode based language, like Perl or Java. It is licensed under the LGPL, so proprietary software&#x27;s source code can be linked against it.

It can create stand-alone executables by binding together source code with the interpreter. In contrast with executables created by similar commercial programs like Visual Basic, executables produced by wxBasic do not require any external DLL file, resource file, or installer to run. The executable is distributed alone and can be run immediately by end-users. As with programs written in any interpreted language, wxBasic programs may also be run straight from the source code on any platform, if wxBasic is present. 

wxBasic is written primarily in C, with some C++ linking it to the wxWidgets library. wxWidgets supplies the cross-platform features. It runs on Microsoft Windows using native controls, and on Linux and macOS using the GTK+ library. wxBasic is also the basis for the SdlBasic project.

==Example==
The following program implements a text viewer:
 &#x27; from http://wxbasic.sourceforge.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=554
 &#x27; Simple Text Viewer written in wxBasic
 dim AppName = &quot;Text Viewer&quot;
 fileName = &quot;&quot;

 &#x27; Main window
 dim frame = new wxFrame( Nothing, -1, AppName &amp; &quot; - Untitled Document&quot; )
 &#x27; Text edit control
 dim control = new wxTextCtrl( frame, -1, &quot;&quot;, wxPoint( 0, 0 ),
 wxSize( 100, 100 ), wxTE_MULTILINE | wxTE_READONLY | wxTE_RICH)

 &#x27; Status bar - The one at the bottom of the window
 dim status = frame.CreateStatusBar( 1 )
 frame.SetStatusText(&quot;Ready&quot;)
 &#x27; Dialog used for Open
 dim fileDialog = new wxFileDialog( frame )
 &#x27; add menubar to the frame
 dim mBar = new wxMenuBar()
 frame.SetMenuBar(mBar)
 &#x27; build the &quot;File&quot; dropdown menu
 dim mFile = new wxMenu()
 mBar.Append(mFile, &quot;&amp;File&quot;)

 &#x27; make it
 mFile.Append( wxID_OPEN, &quot;&amp;Open...&quot;, &quot;Loads an existing file from disk&quot; )
 mFile.AppendSeparator()
 mFile.Append( wxID_EXIT, &quot;E&amp;xit\tAlt-X&quot;, &quot;Exit Application&quot; )

 Sub onFileOpen( event )
 fileDialog.SetMessage(&quot;Open File&quot;)
 fileDialog.SetStyle( wxOPEN )
 If fileDialog.ShowModal() = wxID_OK Then
 fileName = fileDialog.GetPath()
 Ext = fileDialog.GetFilename()
 control.Clear()
 control.LoadFile( fileName )
 frame.SetTitle( AppName &amp; &quot; - &quot; &amp; fileName )
 frame.SetStatusText(Ext)
 End If
 End Sub
 Connect( frame, wxID_OPEN, wxEVT_COMMAND_MENU_SELECTED, &quot;onFileOpen&quot; )

 Sub onFileExit( event )
 frame.Close(True)
 End Sub
 Connect( frame, wxID_EXIT, wxEVT_COMMAND_MENU_SELECTED, &quot;onFileExit&quot; )

 &#x27; build the &quot;Help&quot; dropdown menu
 dim mHelp = new wxMenu()
 mBar.Append(mHelp, &quot;&amp;Help&quot;)
 mHelp.Append( wxID_HELP, &quot;&amp;About\tF1&quot;, &quot;About this program&quot; )
 Sub onHelpAbout( event )
 Dim msg = &quot;Text View allows any text file\n&quot; &amp;
 &quot;to be viewed regardless of its extension.\n&quot; &amp;
 &quot;If the file being opened isn&#x27;t a text file\n&quot; &amp;
 &quot;then it won&#x27;t be displayed. There will be a\n&quot; &amp;
 &quot;little garbage shown and that&#x27;s all.&quot;
 wxMessageBox( msg, &quot;About Text View&quot;, wxOK + wxICON_INFORMATION, frame )
 End Sub
 Connect( frame, wxID_HELP, wxEVT_COMMAND_MENU_SELECTED, &quot;onHelpAbout&quot; )

 frame.Show(True)

The outer main-belt asteroid 3555 Miyasaka was named in his honour by prolific astronomer Takao Kobayashi, with whom Miyasaka has been collaborating for many years, acknowledging the fact, that he is one of the few Japanese observers who devote themselves to follow-up observations.

<text>Reubin O&#x27;Donovan Askew (September 11, 1928 – March 13, 2014) was an American politician, who served as the 37th governor of Florida from 1971 to 1979. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 7th U.S. trade representative from 1979 to 1980 under President Jimmy Carter. He led on tax reform, civil rights, and financial transparency for public officials, maintaining an outstanding reputation for personal integrity.

Born in Muskogee, Oklahoma, Askew served as a military intelligence officer in the United States Air Force during the Korean War. He established a legal practice in Pensacola, Florida, after graduating from the University of Florida Levin College of Law in 1955. Askew won election to the Florida House of Representatives in 1958 and to the Florida Senate in 1962. He defeated incumbent Republican governor Claude R. Kirk Jr. in the 1970 gubernatorial election and won re-election in 1974.

As governor, Askew presided over the imposition of the state&#x27;s first corporate tax. He was one of the first of the &quot;New South&quot; governors and supported school desegregation. Askew is widely thought to have been one of the state&#x27;s best governors; in 2014 the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; ranked him the second best governor in Florida history and the Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University rated him one of the country&#x27;s top ten governors of the 20th century. Askew was the keynote speaker at the 1972 Democratic National Convention and declined an offer to serve as George McGovern&#x27;s running mate in the 1972 presidential election.

Askew served as the United States trade representative from 1979 to 1981. He sought the Democratic nomination in the 1984 presidential election but withdrew early in the race. After leaving public office, Askew taught at the public universities of Florida.

==Early life and education==
Askew was born in Muskogee, Oklahoma, the youngest of the six children of Leon G. Askew and Alberta (O&#x27;Donovan) Askew. His parents divorced when he was just two, primarily because of what Askew said was his father&#x27;s &quot;serious drinking problem.&quot; Two of his brothers later had similar problems. Askew chose to be a lifelong teetotaller and non-smoker after an unpleasant experience with a pipe as a teenager. After a final meeting under unpleasant circumstances when he was ten years old, Askew never saw his father again.

In 1937, his mother moved with Reubin to Pensacola, Florida. Askew&#x27;s middle name, O&#x27;Donovan, was his mother&#x27;s maiden name. His signature used the double initial (O&#x27;D.) in her honor. Reubin would sell magazines, shine shoes, bag groceries and sell his mother&#x27;s pies that were homemade to help supplement her income. Reubin&#x27;s mother was a waitress and a seamstress for the Works Progress Administration.

In 1944, Askew was initiated as a member of Escambia Chapter Order of DeMolay, the Masonic organization for young men. He graduated from Pensacola High School in 1946. Later that year, Askew entered the Army as a paratrooper, serving for two years; in 1948 he was discharged in the rank of sergeant.

Askew attended Florida State University, where he was a brother of Delta Tau Delta and Alpha Phi Omega. At Florida State, Askew was elected as student body president, beginning his long career in politics. He graduated from Florida State University in 1951 with a B.S. degree in public administration. He later completed law school at the University of Florida Levin College of Law.

==Career==
During the Korean War, Askew served in the U.S. Air Force from 1951 to 1953, as a military intelligence officer. He oversaw the program for taking and analyzing airplane reconnaissance photographs of Western Europe. He felt uncomfortable with this task since he believed it violated existing treaties.

In 1955, Askew returned to Pensacola, where he formed a law firm with David Levin. The firm was called Levin &amp; Askew, and now is named Levin Papantonio Law Firm.

==Legislative career==

In 1956, Askew was elected Assistant County Solicitor of Escambia County, Florida, as a Democrat. In 1958, he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives, representing Escambia County. After serving two terms in the House, in 1962 Askew was elected to the Florida Senate from the 2nd district, also representing Escambia defeating Philip D. Beall in the primary election. He was reelected to a redistricted seat encompassing both Escambia and Santa Rosa counties in 1966, and again in 1967 and 1968 being unopposed in 1968.

From 1969 to 1970, he served as president &quot;pro tempore&quot; of the Senate. In 1971 he received the Legion of Honor from the International Supreme Council of the Order of DeMolay.

Askew emerged as a progressive lawmaker: he supported reapportionment in the state legislature in order to recognize changes in population distribution and increase representation for urban counties, which had a higher population than rural ones. The state houses had been apportioned by geographic county, resulting in inequities that did not represent current state conditions. Urban areas were underrepresented in the legislature. As was typical of many states, rural legislators had resisted reapportionment in order to retain power.

Askew opposed legal racial segregation and the continuing disenfranchisement of black voters. They had been disenfranchised since the turn of the century, when Florida had passed a new constitution with provisions for voter registration and elections that effectively blocked blacks from the polls. Passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 authorized the federal government to exercise oversight over jurisdictions in which classes of voters were historically underrepresented in voter rolls and voting patterns; African Americans were helped to re-enter the political system.

==Governorship==


Askew won the Democratic nomination for governor in 1970. Secretary of State of Florida Thomas Burton Adams, Jr., was his running-mate for lieutenant governor. In its endorsement of the Askew-Adams ticket, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; reported that Askew had &quot;captured the imagination of a state that plainly deserves new leadership.&quot; During the campaign, the incumbent Republican governor, Claude R. Kirk Jr., ridiculed his opponent Askew as &quot;a momma&#x27;s boy who wouldn&#x27;t have the courage to stand up under the fire of the legislators&quot; and a &quot;nice sweet-looking fellow chosen by liberals...to front for them.&quot; Such rhetoric helped to reinvigorate the Democratic coalition. Mike Thompson, who managed the 1970 Republican gubernatorial primary campaign waged by state representative L. A. &quot;Skip&quot; Bafalis, sat out the general election between Kirk and Askew. Thompson later said that the often acerbic Kirk had demolished &quot;the coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats who elected him in 1966. ... The trail from Tallahassee to Palm Beach is littered with the bodies of former friends, supporters, and citizens -- all of whom made the fatal mistake of believing the words of Claude Kirk.&quot;

With 57% of the vote, Askew and Adams unseated Kirk and Lieutenant Governor Ray C. Osborne. From 1887 to 1969, the Florida Constitution did not provide for a lieutenant governor. The change allowed the top two positions to be filled by running mates from the same political party.

In 1974, Askew was re-elected, with J. H. Williams as his running mate. He is one of seven Florida governors to have been elected for two terms (the others were LeRoy Collins, Bob Graham, Lawton Chiles, Jeb Bush, Rick Scott, and Ron DeSantis). Askew was the first governor to serve two full four-year terms.

Through his two terms, Askew worked on tax reform. In 1971, he gained passage of the state&#x27;s first corporate income tax. He also gained an increase in the homestead exemption.

Askew argued for transparency in government. He tried three times to get the legislature to pass a bill requiring financial disclosure by public officials. When they did not, he used a provision of the 1968 constitution, collecting sufficient signatures to put the measure on the ballot in 1976. The voters passed the &quot;Sunshine Amendment&quot; by 78%, the first time the constitution was amended due to citizen action. It calls for full financial disclosure by public officials and candidates, a ban on gifts to legislators, and prohibits former officials from lobbying for two years after leaving office.
At a time of government scandals, he established a reputation for personal integrity and was known as &quot;Reubin the Good.&quot; According to a political foe, &quot;He has established a kind of morality in office that causes people to have faith&quot; in government.

In addition to dealing with state issues, Askew pursued collaboration with other governors: he chaired the Education Commission of the States (1973–1974), the Southern Governors&#x27; Conference (1974–1975), and the Democratic Governors&#x27; Conference (1976–1977). Governor Askew was chairman of the National Governors&#x27; Conference in 1977.

===Civil rights issues and the New South===

Askew was one of the first of the New South governors, elected in the same year as governors Jimmy Carter of Georgia, Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, who defeated Orval Faubus, and John C. West of South Carolina. They were later joined by Bill Clinton of Arkansas. Askew supported school desegregation and the controversial idea of busing to achieve racial balance (mandatory integration).

He expressed a progressive model in his appointments, naming the first black Justice of the State Supreme Court, Joseph Woodrow Hatchett. He appointed M. Athalie Range as Secretary of the Department of Community Affairs; she was the first black person appointed to state government since Reconstruction and the first woman to head a state agency in Florida. In 1978, Askew appointed Jesse J. McCrary Jr. as secretary of state; he was the first black person to hold a cabinet-level office in Florida in the modern era.

===Capital punishment===
After the 1972 U.S. Supreme Court decision in &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; effectively overturned existing state laws for capital punishment in the United States, Florida was the first state to enact a new death penalty statute, which Governor Askew signed despite personally believing that the death penalty was appropriate only in rare cases. Afterward the Supreme Court accepted new state death-penalty laws in &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot;. Immediately after the ruling, which effectively reinstated the use of the death penalty in the United States, Governor Askew began signing death warrants. Executions were not resumed until the administration of his successor, Bob Graham.

Based on issues related to the cases of two life-sentenced inmates, Wilbert Lee and Freddie Pitts, Askew ordered a new investigation, which found they had been wrongfully convicted of murder in 1963. Askew participated in part of the inquiry and in 1975 pardoned both inmates, who had been removed from death row after the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision halting capital punishment.

===Presidential politics===
Askew&#x27;s national stature in the Democratic Party grew, and in 1972, he was the keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach. For the 1972 presidential election, he was offered the vice presidential slot on the Democratic ticket with presidential nominee George McGovern, but he turned it down. He later accepted an appointment under President Jimmy Carter as chairman of the Advisory Committee on Ambassadorial Appointments.

===Trade representative===

Limited to two terms as governor by the Florida Constitution, Askew looked for his next opportunity. In 1979, he accepted President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s invitation to serve as United States Trade Representative, continuing until Carter&#x27;s term ended in January 1981. Askew was the first trade representative who held the title &quot;United States Trade Representative&quot;, not &quot;Special Trade Representative&quot;, as his predecessors were called.

===Presidential candidacy in 1984===

Askew joined a Miami law firm and at the same time began to organize a bid for the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination. He announced his candidacy on February 23, 1983, after making visits to all 50 states. The first serious presidential candidate from Florida, Askew never gained traction within the national Democratic Party. Although progressive on civil rights, he generally was more conservative than other candidates. Askew was against abortion, believing life began at birth, and favored a constitutional amendment to overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. On other issues, he supported the ERA but was against gay rights, supported a nuclear freeze but opposed arms control, supported both gun control and the death penalty, and called for pulling American Marines out of Beirut but supported President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s invasion of Grenada. Askew withdrew on March 1, 1984, after he finished last in the New Hampshire primary.

===U.S. Senate candidacy in 1988===

In 1987, Askew declared his candidacy for the U.S. Senate. But in May 1988, he withdrew from the contest, citing the need for perpetual fundraising. At the time of his withdrawal, he had lead in the polls. He endorsed Congressman Buddy McKay afterwards. Three days after dropping out, he resigned from his law firm, reportedly due to discontent from partners who had raised large amounts of money for Askew.

== Post-political career ==
In 1994, Askew was named to the founding class of the Florida DeMolay Hall of Fame.

The Reubin O&#x27;D. Askew School of Public Administration and Policy at Florida State University was named for him. It offers courses in government at several Florida universities. From 1999 until his death, Askew gave a graduate seminar at the school, on topics of state and local government as well as international trade.

For the ten years prior to that, Askew lectured and taught at each of the other ten public universities in the state. In 1994, the Reubin O&#x27;D Askew Institute on Politics and Society at the University of Florida was established to provide a center for bringing together people to work on state issues. Askew also lectured and participated in conferences there.

==Personal life==
Askew married Donna Lou Harper in August 1956. He proposed to her two weeks after the first date, and they married five months after. By all accounts, the two enjoyed a very happy marriage, and Askew remained faithful to her. They had two adopted children; a daughter and a son. Throughout his life, Askew refrained from smoking, drinking, swearing, and gambling.

==Death==
Askew died at a hospital in Tallahassee, Florida, on March 13, 2014, aged 85, from complications of pneumonia and a stroke.

<text>Hispania Baetica, often abbreviated Baetica, was one of three Roman provinces created in Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula) on 27 BC. Baetica was bordered to the west by Lusitania, and to the northeast by Tarraconensis. Baetica remained one of the basic divisions of Hispania under the Visigoths. Its territory approximately corresponds to modern Andalusia.

== Name ==
In Latin, &#x27; is an adjectival form of &#x27;, the Roman name for the Guadalquivir River, whose fertile valley formed one of the most important parts of the province.

== History ==

Before Romanization, the mountainous area that was to become Baetica was occupied by several settled Iberian tribal groups. Celtic influence was not as strong as it was in the Celtiberian north. According to the geographer Claudius Ptolemy, the indigenes were the powerful Turdetani, in the valley of the Guadalquivir in the west, bordering on Lusitania, and the partly Hellenized Turduli with their city Baelo, in the hinterland behind the coastal Phoenician trading colonies, whose Punic inhabitants Ptolemy termed the &quot;Bastuli&quot;. Phoenician Gadir (Cadiz) was on an island against the coast of Hispania Baetica. Other important Iberians were the Bastetani, who occupied the Almería and mountainous Granada regions. Towards the southeast, Punic influence spread from the Carthaginian cities on the coast: New Carthage (Roman &quot;Carthago Nova,&quot; modern Cartagena), Abdera and Malaca (Málaga).

Some of the Iberian cities retained their pre-Indo-European names in Baetica throughout the Roman era. Granada was called &quot;Eliberri&quot;, &quot;Illiberis&quot; and &quot;Illiber&quot; by the Romans; in Basque, &quot;iri-berri&quot; or &quot;ili-berri&quot;, still signifies &quot;new town&quot;.
The south of the Iberian peninsula was agriculturally rich, providing for export of wine, olive oil and the fermented fish sauce called &quot;garum&quot; that were staples of the Mediterranean diet, and its products formed part of the western Mediterranean trade economy even before it submitted to Rome in 206 BC. After the defeat of Carthage in the Second Punic War, which found its &quot;casus belli&quot; on the coast of Baetica at Saguntum, Hispania was significantly Romanized in the course of the 2nd century BC, following the uprising initiated by the Turdetani in 197. The central and north-eastern Celtiberians soon followed suit. It took Cato the Elder, who became consul in 195 BC and was given the command of the whole peninsula to put down the rebellion in the northeast and the lower Ebro valley. He then marched southwards and put down a revolt by the Turdetani. Cato returned to Rome in 194, leaving two praetors in charge of the two Iberian provinces. In the late Roman Republic, Hispania remained divided like Gaul into a &quot;Nearer&quot; and a &quot;Farther&quot; province, as experienced marching overland from Gaul: &quot;Hispania Citerior&quot; (the Ebro region), and &quot;Ulterior&quot; (the Guadalquivir region). The battles in Hispania during the 1st century BC were largely confined to the north.

In the reorganization of the Empire in 14 BC, Baetica was made a senatorial province, which means it was governed by a proconsul who had formerly been a praetor appointed by the Senate. Its capital was Colonia Patricia Corduba (modern day Córdoba), founded in 169 BC. Fortune smiled on rich Baetica, which was &quot;Baetica Felix,&quot; and a dynamic, upwardly-mobile social and economic middling stratum developed there, which absorbed freed slaves and far outnumbered the rich elite. The Senatorial province of Baetica became so secure that no Roman legion was required to be permanently stationed there, whereas &quot;Legio VII Gemina&quot; was permanently stationed to the north, in Hispania Tarraconensis, in a camp which later became the city of León.


Baetica was divided into four &quot;conventūs&quot;, which were territorial divisions like judicial circuits, where the chief men met together at major centers, at fixed times of year, under the eye of the proconsul, to oversee the administration of justice: the &quot;conventus Gaditanus&quot; (of Gades, or Cádiz), &quot;Cordubensis&quot; (of Cordoba), &quot;Astigitanus&quot; (of Astigi, or Écija), and &quot;Hispalensis&quot; (of Hispalis, or Seville). As the towns became the permanent seats of standing courts during the later Empire, the &quot;conventūs&quot; were superseded (Justinian&#x27;s Code, i.40.6) and the term &quot;conventus&quot; is lastly applied to certain bodies of Roman citizens living in a province, forming a sort of enfranchised corporation, and representing the Roman people in their district as a kind of gentry; and it was from among these that proconsuls generally took their assistants. So in spite of some social upsets, as when Septimius Severus put to death a number of leading Baetians— including women — the elite in Baetica remained a stable class for centuries.

Columella, who wrote a twelve volume treatise on all aspects of Roman farming and knew viticulture, came from Gades (Cádiz). The vast olive plantations of Baetica shipped olive oil from the coastal ports by sea to supply Roman legions in Germania and general demand elsewhere in the empire. Amphoras from Baetica have been found everywhere in the Western Roman Empire. It was to keep Roman legions supplied by sea routes that the Empire needed to control the distant coasts of Lusitania and the northern Atlantic coast of Hispania.

Baetica was rich and strongly Romanized, attracting colonists and merchants from Italy. Since the 1st century BC it produced outstanding figures like the aforementioned Columella, the rhetorician Seneca the Elder, his son the stoic philosopher Seneca the Younger, and Lucan, author of the epic poem Pharsalia on Caesar&#x27;s civil war against Pompey the Great. The last three were members of the Annaea family, a prominent Roman gens settled in Córdoba. Facts that the Emperor Vespasian was rewarding when he granted the &quot;Ius latii&quot; that extended the rights pertaining to Roman citizenship (&quot;latinitas&quot;) to the inhabitants of Hispania, an honor that secured the loyalty of the Baetian elite and its middle class. 

Baetica also gave Rome two emperors. Trajan, the first emperor since Claudius to be of provincial birth, though of Italic stock, was born in Itálica (Baetica), a colony established in 206 BC by Scipio Africanus for Roman veterans of the Second Punic War. Trajan&#x27;s kinsman and successor Hadrian also came from Itálica. Marcus Aurelius, though born in Rome, had ancestors born in the town of Ucubi (modern day Espejo), a Roman colony not far from Córdoba.

Baetica enjoyed &quot;Pax Romana&quot; for most of imperial history, though it faced a permanent threat stemming from Africa from the 2nd century AD. On 171 groups of &quot;mauri&quot; (natives of Mauretania Tingitana, roughly modern day Morocco) crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and looted rural towns for months until they were expelled. A century later, in 296–297, Emperor Maximian built a massive palace nearby Córdoba from where to command the campaign against piracy in the Strait and Berber incursions in Mauritania. 

Baetica was Roman until the brief invasion of the Vandals and Alans passed through in the 5th century, followed by the more permanent kingdom of the Visigoths. The province formed part of the Exarchate of Africa and was joined to Mauretania Tingitana after Belisarius&#x27; reconquest of Africa. The Catholic bishops of Baetica, solidly backed by their local population, were able to convert the Arian Visigoth king Reccared and his nobles. As an administrative unit, Baetica ceased to exist after the Islamic invasion in 711.

== Proconsuls ==

The Province was governed by a proconsul who had formerly been a praetor.

<text>The is a subcompact car manufactured by Toyota from 1973 until 1999, replacing the Publica, but retaining the Publica&#x27;s &quot;P&quot; code and generation numbering. The first generation Starlet was sold as the Publica Starlet in some markets. In Japan, it was exclusive to Toyota Auto Store dealers.

It is the first subcompact car from a Japanese automaker to offer a high-performance variant. These were available in three generations: the 1986–1989 Turbo S (EP71), the 1990–1995 GT Turbo (EP82), and the 1996–1999 Glanza V (EP91). Another variant was the Toyota Sera, a sport compact made in the early 1990s and officially sold only in Japan; the Sera had a unique two-door coupé body and butterfly doors but shared the Starlet&#x27;s chassis and mechanicals.

The Starlet was briefly exported to North America from 1981 to 1984.

In 1999, the Starlet was replaced by the Vitz—sold as the Echo or Yaris in international markets—and the bB mini MPV, which was later sold as the Scion xB in Canada and the United States and as the Daihatsu Materia in Europe. However, Toyota effectively vacated the European city car market until the Aygo was launched in 2005.

The &quot;Starlet&quot; nameplate was revived in 2020 for a rebadged Suzuki Baleno hatchback, sold exclusively in some African countries (and in India under the &quot;Glanza&quot; name).


== First generation (P40/P50; 1973) ==
Initially launched in April 1973 as the higher-grade and bigger model of the Publica P30, the Starlet was offered with 1,000 and 1,200 cc engines. The coupé&#x27;s wedgy design was developed from sketches made by Giorgetto Giugiaro. Model codes are KP40/KP45 for the sedan and coupé versions with the 1-litre engine and KP42/KP47 for the larger engined versions. Generally the car looked like a shortened Corolla. The body style was originally available only as a two-door coupé and was often referred to as a &quot;Baby Celica.&quot; The four-door sedan arrived in October 1973. Grades offered were Standard, Deluxe, Hi-Deluxe, ST, and SR. The top models were also offered with a five-speed manual transmission. The single-carb 1.0-litre 2K engine develops at 6,000 rpm while the 1.2 offers at the same engine speed. The twin-carb 3K-BR engine with 9.0:1 compression ratio and at 6,600 rpm used regular petrol, while a version with 10.0:1 compression (3K-B) running on premium petrol was offered in a single version of the top SR model. This engine has at 6,000 rpm.

The Starlet coupé and four-door were never sold in Europe and were generally not seen in most export markets, Toyota instead choosing to focus on the lower-cost Publica (1000) two-door sedan and station wagon.

In February 1976, the Starlet underwent some changes, mainly to meet Japan&#x27;s new emissions requirements. The 3K engine was replaced by the cleaner 1.2-litre 3K-U type, while the 1-litre option and the twin-carb 1.2 options were discontinued (in Japan, at least). With the update, the chassis number was changed to KP51 for both body styles. The new engine featured Toyota&#x27;s TTC-C emissions control system with a catalytic converter and power accordingly dropped to at 5,800 rpm. In September of the same year, the two-speed Toyoglide automatic gearbox became an option. The Starlet underwent an additional minor revision in January 1977; the ST version received intermittent wipers at this time. The first generation Starlet was discontinued in January 1978.

== Second generation (P60; 1978) ==
The 60 series, introduced in February 1978, was better known than its predecessor due to being the first Starlet extensively sold outside Japan. It was particularly well received in Europe, including the United Kingdom, at which time superminis were soaring in popularity. It was offered with a 993 (KP60 2K), 1,166 (KP62, 3K) or 1,290 cc (KP61, 4K) engine. Three- and five-door hatchbacks were offered in export markets, although a longer five-door wagon variant (also known as the &quot;Van&quot; in the Japanese market) was sold in Japan and certain Asian and European markets. The Van arrived in October 1978, at the same time that the 1.2-litre KP62 became available in most export markets. The KP62 was first seen in Sweden in July 1978, where it was equipped with the de-smogged 3K-C engine to meet that country&#x27;s particular emissions requirements. In Japan, all Starlets except the Van were only available with the larger 1.3-litre engine; the Van model retained the smaller, 1.2-litre, 3K-HJ type. 

The 60 series Starlet was the first Toyota passenger car to utilize rack-and-pinion steering. Suspension on 60 series Starlets is in the form of MacPherson front struts accompanied by four link rear suspension with coil springs for hatchback models and leaf spring suspension on van models.

Trim levels were Standard, De Luxe (also known as DX in some markets), GL, XL, S, Si, Sprint, SE and Lisse. Si models have a fuel injected 4K-E engine. Sprint models included the upgraded Toyota Sports Handling Suspension, a tachometer, five-speed (K50) transmission, 1,290cc (4K) engine and a sportier interior compared to other models. The external trimming on Sprint models is also clipped into place, as opposed to being glued on as in other models. Sprint models include the same alloy wheels as featured on early AE86 Corollas as well. Japanese market models did not generally have self-retracting rear seatbelts. Japanese and New Zealand market models have 203 mm front brake rotors, as opposed to many other markets receiving Starlets with 228 mm front brake rotors.

Vehicles fitted with a 2K engine received a smaller differential (X code, ) than vehicles fitted with a 4K engine (U code, ). Differential ratios depend on the trim model and market for each car, with 3.909:1 being common for vehicles with a 2K engine, 4.3:1 for European van models, 3.727:1 for Japanese van models, 3.417:1 for vehicles fitted with an automatic transmission, and 3.583:1 for general applications with a 4K engine. Other ratios also existed for various Japanese market models.

In 1980, the Starlet was facelifted to include square headlights. A second facelift followed in 1983 to incorporate a slant nose front end and a new lower hatch opening.

The 3-door KP61 was the only Starlet ever sold in the US, where it was available from the 1981 through the 1984 model years. The 1981–1982 models came with standard five-speed manual transmissions and tachometers. It is an equivalent to other markets&#x27; S model. The 1983–1984 models featured electronic fuel injection (EFI) with the 4K engine, but with a four-speed manual transmission and equipment similar to other markets&#x27; XLi model.

Common rust locations on a 60 series Starlet are under the rear hatch seal, around the front window wiper mount, behind the front fenders, and the bottom of the doors.



== Third generation (P70; 1984) ==
The P70 series of October 1984 saw the Starlet switch to front-wheel drive, which was now the normal format for cars of this size. Three-door and five-door hatchbacks were offered, and a three-door van for commercial use was also available in many markets. The 12 valve 1E and 2E engines replaced the old K-series engines. The extensive Japanese line up consisted of Standard, CD-L, DX, DX-A, Soleil, Soleil-L, XL, XL-Lissé, SE, Si, Si Limited, Ri, Turbo R, and Turbo S, although the one-litre version was available for export only. The engine fitted in turbo models was the 2E-TELU, and was installed with Toyota&#x27;s active suspension technology called TEMS. The Ri and Turbo R are the light weight models designed for motorsports.

For the export markets the Starlet 70 series were offered as 1.0 Standard, 1.0 DX, 1.0 XL, 1.0 XL Lisse, 1.3 DX, 1.3 XL, 1.3 S, and 1.3 SE. The export version &quot;Si Limited&quot; was basically an XL or 1.3 S with front and rear spoilers, sporty red and black interior, Multi-point fuel injection and special exterior colour 2-tone black-silver, or white.

The first Starlet assembled outside Japan was the 1985 1.0 XL built in Indonesia. A year later, the 1.3-litre model joined the production line there. The Indonesian-built Starlets were only available as 5-door with carburettor, 4-speed manual transmission for the 1.0-litre, or 5-speed manual gearbox for the 1.3-litre. The smaller engine cars were offered as XL, Lissé and Si Limited, while trim levels for the bigger engine models were SE and Si Limited. 

Facelift for the Japanese models was given in 1987 with new nose, tail lights, bigger bumpers, and revised interior. Indonesian-built Starlet received these minor changes in 1988, while the European and general market models retained the older appearance.



== Fourth generation (P80; 1989) ==
The Starlet 80 series was introduced to the Japanese market in December 1989. It featured a more rounded body style and interior. Japanese models received new twin cam engines: 4E-F, 4E-FE and turbocharged 4E-FTE. Export models retained the 1E and 2E engines, and the special version 4E-FE (only for UK and Hong Kong facelift models). The 1N 1.5-litre diesel engine was also available. The Starlet for Japan and Indonesia have a rear center garnish and therefore the license plate is mounted on the bumper. The 80 Series Starlets exported to other destinations have their number plates mounted on the hatch centre panel.

In Japan, the 80 Series Starlet was again offered in a wide range of variants: Soleil, the best selling Soleil L, S, X, X Limited, Si, Canvas Top, the sports model Gi and GT Turbo. The sports model have different bumpers, headlights, and tail lights from the regular models. Sports bucket front seats and a rear spoiler are also standard on the Gi and GT. The GT has a two-mode (low and high) turbo. The Japanese only full-time 4WD models (EP85) were offered in Soleil L, S, and X Limited grades.

New Zealand initially received the 3 door 1.0 XL, 1.3 XL and 1.3 S with manual transmission. In March 1993, the automatic only 5 door 1.3 XL was added into the line up. The 2E-engined versions were carburetted and produce .

The locally assembled Starlet for Indonesia was offered as 1.0 XL, 1.3 SE and 1.3 SE Limited with only 5-speed manual transmission. Only the 1.0 XL was sold in Singapore. All the Starlets officially sold in the Southeast Asian countries were the 5-door models.

The Starlet made its European debut at the 1990 Geneva Motor Show. The 1.3 XLi was the version sold in most European countries. The sporty 1.3 Si was offered in Switzerland. It came with standard sports front seats, three-spoke steering wheel, sunroof, and rear spoiler.

The UK model was the 1.0 GL, only offered as a three-door hatchback, replaced by the 1.3 GLi three-door from 1993 onwards. For 1994, the UK models were 1.3 XLi three-door and 1.3 GLi five-door. All GLi models have a sunroof.

They were some special editions of 80-series sold in Europe such as 1.3 Jeans in the UK and Germany, 1.3 Dance in Switzerland, and 1.3 Westwood in Belgium, all of these are based on the 1.3 XLi. There was also a van model for certain markets where the tax structure suited such a model, without rear seating and often with blanked out windows in the rear. While van versions of earlier Starlets had always been available in Japan, changes in the tax system meant that the fourth generation Starlet was only sold as a passenger car in the home market.

A minor facelift occurred in January 1992, with all Japanese models gaining fuel injection and the discontinuation of the X variant. A new front bumper and revised interior were installed, and the addition of a safety beam inside the doors were added for all models. The S, X Limited, Gi, and GT also gained a new rear center garnish. In Indonesia the new SE-G replaced the SE Limited. The SE-G has upmarket interior similar to the Japanese X Limited, and shares the redesigned tail lights and trunk garnish with the Gi and GT. For the Hong Kong market, the Japanese model Soleil L 5-door hatchback replaced the old 1.3 XL. The Starlet Canvas Top with folding canvas roof was offered in Hong Kong and certain European countries.

The second minor update was in May 1994 with new front end and tail lights. The full-wide rear garnish was removed. The hatch trunk now has smooth panel with small garnishes. The Gi and GT featured twin round headlights and mesh grille, also known as &quot;quad&quot; headlights. These minor changes were only extended to Japan, Hong Kong, Indonesia and New Zealand. For the Hong Kong market, the 5-door Soleil L continued, but the Canvas Top Si was removed. The Starlet 1.3 SE and 1.3 SE-G continued in Indonesia, but the 1.0 XL was discontinued. In New Zealand, the sporty 1.3 S was replaced by the new 1.3 GS.
Production in Japan ended in December 1995, but continued in Indonesia until March 1998. The last 80-series in Indonesia was marketed as the &quot;Fantastic Starlet&quot; and nicknamed &quot;turbo look&quot;, with sporty bumpers, grille, and hood from the Japanese Gi. At the beginning, the Starlet was offered in the mid-level SE and top-of-the line SE-G, but later the cheaper model was discontinued.

=== GT Turbo ===

The Starlet GT Turbo is a high performance model of the fourth generation Starlet, first introduced in 1990 as a successor to the 70 series Starlet 1.3 Turbo R. The EP82 GT Turbo was powered by a turbocharged version of a Toyota&#x27;s E Engine, the 4E-FTE with a CT9 turbocharger. This engine produced at 6,400 rpm. The car weighed in at , providing a greater than 100 kilowatt per tonne power-to-weight ratio. Adding to its handling abilities, Toyota&#x27;s active suspension technology continued from the previous generation, called TEMS.

As with other Japanese market Starlets, the GT Turbo received minor changes in January 1992 which included new bumpers and rear combination lamps.

The second minor change was given in May 1994, this time with four round quad headlights combined with the mesh grille. The tail lights remained the same, but the full length center garnish was replaced by the small ones on each side.

Production of the car ended in December 1995, but the popularity of the car is still maintained by a cult of drivers, mainly as a used import. The Starlet GT Turbo and the normally aspirated 1.3 Gi were replaced by the Starlet Glanza series, the Glanza V and Glanza S respectively.

Two limited edition versions of the GT Turbo were produced, the GT Limited and the GT Advance. Both feature small changes such as different steering wheels and gear shifter knobs, a rear strut bar, ABS (on later versions only) and were distinguishable by their two-tone paint scheme. These models also featured an optional LSD which was available with the C153 transaxle.

== Fifth generation (P90; 1996) ==


The Starlet 90 series, introduced in 1996, retained the same three- or five-door hatchback ideas. The unique design is a sloped-down belt line on the front doors. The Japanese versions were divided into three models: Reflet (normal), Glanza (sports) and Carat (more luxurious). The Reflet (Base, f, and x), the Carat, and the Glanza S were powered by the 4E-FE engine. The Base model was also offered with the 1N Diesel engine. Based on the five-door Reflet, the Starlet Remix came with a rugged SUV style. It has over fenders, body cladding, roof rail, and spare tire mounted on the back.

The 90-series Starlet shared its platform with the Paseo including suspension, engine, and many other components. The RHD Starlet received its own dashboard design with slightly higher center AC outlets, while the LHD version shares its dashboard with Tercel and Paseo.

The Starlet EP91 came to Europe in the second quarter of 1996. Although basically, all European models were 1.3 XLi with a version of the 4E-FE engine, they were marketed under different name across Europe. Initially, the UK models were the base 1.3 Sportif and the upmarket 1.3 CD (with standard CD-player and sunroof). In 1998, the UK lineup was revised with base 1.3 S, sporty 1.3 SR (with lowered suspension, spoiler, and sport exhaust), and loaded 1.3 GLS. The French models were Base, GL, and GLS. In Switzerland, the upgraded model similar to GLS is called 1.3 Crystal, while in Norway is called SLi. All of high-grade models have driver&#x27;s side SRS airbag, tachometer, front power windows, rear headrests, and coloured bumpers. ABS and Sunroof are options.

The only generation sold new in Australia, the EP91 Starlet was available from March 1996 to December 1999, originally under three trim levels, the base three-door Life, sporty three-door Group X and luxury five-door Style. In 1997, a five-door version of the Life was introduced. During 1998, the Group X and Style models were dropped, and the Life gained a driver&#x27;s airbag as standard equipment. When first sold in Australia, the Starlet suffered from higher pricing in its category, but sold well later on after Toyota entered a small-car price cut war, competing against the Hyundai Excel and Ford Festiva.

Minor changes with new front bumpers, grille, tail lights and revised interior fabric were new for 1998 Japanese market models. Production of the Starlet ended in July 1999, just after the launch of the Yaris.

This model was not offered for the Indonesian market; the previous EP81 Starlet was instead succeeded by the Soluna sedan in 2000. At the time, Toyota&#x27;s hatchback segment in Indonesia went into hiatus until 2006, when the second-generation Yaris was introduced and marketed as a spiritual successor of the Starlet.

=== Glanza ===
The Starlet Glanza is the sports version of the P90 generation Starlet, and is the successor to the 80 series naturally aspirated Starlet 1.3 Gi and Starlet GT Turbo. The Glanza S was powered by the naturally aspirated 1331 cc 4E-FE and the Glanza V was powered by the turbocharged 1331 cc 4E-FTE. The 4E-FE used in the Glanza S generated which, for the lightweight Starlet, was enough to propel the car from 0–100 km/h in 11.9 seconds. The turbo 4E-FTE used in the Glanza V generated at 6400 rpm with a 0–100 km/h time of 8.2 seconds (factory brochure stats).

In December 1996, the Glanza S Limited was released. It has standard body kits same as Glanza V Turbo except the scooped-hood and the engine did not have a Turbo. A lightweight version of the Glanza V was also available without air conditioner and electric windows to keep the car as light as possible, being intended for competitive usage.

While the Glanza S and Glanza V were only officially available on the Japanese market, many used private imports have made their way to the UK, New Zealand, and many other right-hand drive markets.

== Suzuki Baleno-based models ==
The &quot;Glanza&quot; nameplate was revived in June 2019 for the rebadged Indian market Suzuki Baleno hatchback. The vehicle was released through a partnership with Indian automobile manufacturer Maruti Suzuki. The Glanza is also sold in Africa since September 2020 under the revived Starlet nameplate.

== Motorsports ==
The Starlet EP81 participated in the WRC Acropolis Rally in Greece, and won the A5 class in the 1994 event. The EP71, EP82, and EP91 Starlet also competed in the Starlet One Make Race in Japan. The EP81 participated in the Indonesian Touring Car Championship, and rallies in the Caribbean.

<text>Aziz Nesin (; born Mehmet Nusret, 20 December 1915 – 6 July 1995) was a Turkish writer, humorist and the author of more than 100 books. Born in a time when Turks did not have official surnames, he had to adopt one after the Surname Law of 1934 was passed. Although his family carried the nickname &quot;Topalosmanoğlu&quot;, after an ancestor named &quot;Topal Osman&quot;, he chose the surname &quot;Nesin&quot;. In Turkish, &quot;Nesin?&quot; means, &quot;What are you?&quot;.

==Pseudonyms==
Generally going by the name &quot;Aziz Nesin&quot;, the name &quot;Aziz&quot; was originally his father&#x27;s nickname, used by Nesin for the pseudonym under which he started publishing. He wrote under more than fifty &quot;noms de plume&quot;, such as the pseudonym &quot;Vedia Nesin&quot;, his first wife&#x27;s name, which he used for love poems published in the magazine &quot;Yedigün&quot;.

==Biography==
He was born in 1915 on Heybeliada, one of the Princes&#x27; Islands of Istanbul, in the days of the Ottoman Empire. After serving as a career officer for several years, he became the editor of a series of satirical periodicals with a socialist slant. He was jailed several times and placed under surveillance by the National Security Service (MAH in Turkish) for his political views.

In 1946 Nesin launched a weekly satirical magazine, &quot;Marko Paşa&quot;, with two leading figures, namely Sabahattin Ali and Rıfat Ilgaz. Before that Nesin was a contributor to &quot;Tan&quot; newspaper. He was among the contributors of the &quot;Forum&quot; magazine in the 1950s. 

Nesin provided a strong indictment of the oppression and brutalization of the common man. He satirized bureaucracy and &quot;exposed economic inequities in stories that effectively combine and universal truths&quot;. Aziz Nesin has been presented with numerous awards in Turkey, Italy, Bulgaria and the former Soviet Union. His works have been translated into over thirty languages. During latter parts of his life he was said to be the only Turkish author who made a living only out of his earnings from his books.

On 6 June 1956, he married a coworker from the &quot;Akbaba&quot; magazine, Meral Çelen.

When he arrived in Bulgaria in 1965, he met the poet Recep Küpçü and took some of his manuscripts with him to Turkey.

In 1972, he founded the Nesin Foundation in Catalca. The purpose of the Nesin Foundation is to take, each year, four poor and destitute children into the Foundation&#x27;s home and provide every necessity - shelter, education and training, starting from elementary school - until they complete high school, a trade school, or until they acquire a vocation. Aziz Nesin donated to the Nesin Foundation his copyrights in their entirety for all his works in Turkey or other countries, including all of his published books, all plays to be staged, all copyrights for documentars, and all his works performed or used in radio or television.

Aziz Nesin was a political activist. In the aftermath of the 1980 military coup led by Kenan Evren, Turkish intelligentsia faced heavy oppression. Aziz Nesin led a number of intellectuals to rebel against the military government, by issuing the Petition of Intellectuals (), notable signatories of which included Yalçın Küçük, Korkut Boratav, Atıf Yılmaz and Murat Belge. He was the two-time President of Türkiye Yazarlar Sendikası (Turkish Writers&#x27; Union) once from 1980 to 1986, and subsequently from 1987 to 1989.

He was also a critic of Islam. In the early 1990s, he began a translation of Salman Rushdie&#x27;s controversial novel, &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;. This provoked outrage from Islamic organizations, who were gaining popularity throughout Turkey, who then tried to hunt him down. On 2 July 1993, while attending a mostly Alevi cultural festival in the central Anatolian city of Sivas, a mob organized by Islamists gathered around the Madimak Hotel, where the festival attendants were accommodated. After hours of siege, the intruders set the hotel on fire. After flames engulfed several lower floors of the hotel, firetrucks managed to get close, and Aziz Nesin and many guests of the hotel escaped. However, 37 people were killed. This event, also known as the Sivas massacre, was perceived as censorship, and human rights in Turkey were allegedly disrupted at that time. It also deepened the rift between fundamentalist Muslims and those that they regard as infidels.

He devoted his last years to combating religious fundamentalism. Aziz Nesin died on 6 July 1995 in Çeşme, İzmir, due to a heart attack. After his death, his body was buried at an unknown location in land belonging to the Nesin Foundation, without any ceremony, as requested in his will.

<doc id="770620" wikidata="Q5717514" url="?curid=770620" title="Henry Atkinson (soldier)">
<text>Henry Atkinson (1782 – June 14, 1842) was a United States Army officer serving on the western frontier during the War of 1812 and the Yellowstone expedition. With Benjamin O&#x27;Fallon, he negotiated treaties with Indigenous nations of the upper Missouri River in 1825. Over his career in the army, he served in the West, the Gulf Coast, and in New York at the border with The Canadas.

==Early life==
Henry Atkinson was born in 1782 in Caswell County (now Person County, North Carolina). His mother died soon after the birth of her sixth child. His father, John Atkinson, married Francis Dickens shortly after his first wife&#x27;s death and he had two more children with Francis.

In 1748 and 1749, John Atkinson received land grants from the colonial government. He was a local politician and a planter. During the American Revolutionary War, John was a member of the House of Commons and a delegate to the Hillsborough provincial congress in August 1775. He was also a member of the Hillsborough Committee of Safety during the war. He served twelve years as an Orange County Justice of the Peace beginning in 1776. He became North Carolina&#x27;s tobacco purchasing agent in 1781. He had a total of 6,100 acres in the present Caswell and Person counties in 1785. John died in 1792, leaving an estate of seventeen slaves and 3,665 acres of land.

His brothers Edward and Richard were legislators and Edward served as county sheriff.

==Early career==
Atkinson inherited a thousand acres in Caswell County when he was eighteen. He and nine other trustees obtained the charter for a local free school, Caswell Academy in 1802. She sat on the school&#x27;s board of trustees, first as clerk and next as treasurer. He established a small store in 1804, but it failed the following year. He also worked on the family&#x27;s plantation before July 1808.

He entered the United States Army on July 1, 1808, as a captain in the infantry, serving at various outposts on the Western frontier. He served in the New Orleans area. He moved to New York and was promoted to colonel in the Regular Army, seeing considerable action during the War of 1812. He commanded the 6th U.S. Infantry from 1815.

==Career after War of 1812 ==
After the war, Atkinson received orders in 1818 to lead the Yellowstone expedition along the Missouri River to the mouth of the Yellowstone River. The goal was to establish military forts to control Native Americans and allow American members of the fur trade to operate safely in the region. Colonel Talbot Chambers led the 1st Battalion of the Rifle Regiment left Belle Fontaine on August 30, 1818, up the Missouri River. On October 18 they arrived at Isle des Vaches, and spent the winter at Cantonment Martin. They left for Council Bluff where they met Major Stephen Harriman Long. Colonel Atkinson joined the military detachment and established their winter lodging, Cantonment Missouri. He led another expedition in 1825.

Appointed Commissioner together with Indian agent Benjamin O&#x27;Fallon and with a military escort of 476 men, General Atkinson and his fellow commissioner left Fort Atkinson on May 16, 1825, and ascending the Missouri, negotiated treaties of friendship and trade with tribes of the upper Missouri, including the Arikara, Cheyenne, Crow, Mandan, Ponca, and several bands of the Sioux.

The treaties acknowledged that the tribes lived within the United States, vowed perpetual friendship, and recognized the right of the United States to regulate trade, promising to deal only with licensed traders. The tribes agreed to forswear private retaliation for injuries and to return or indemnify the owner of stolen horses or other goods. Efforts to contact the Blackfoot and the Assiniboine were unsuccessful. Returning to Fort Atkinson at the &quot;Council Bluff&quot; in Nebraska, successful negotiations were had with the Otoe, the Pawnee and the Omaha.

He was appointed brevet brigadier general and was in overall command of U.S. forces during the Black Hawk War (1832). Although he delivered the final blow to the Black Hawk Indians at the Battle of Bad Axe, Atkinson was criticized for mishandling the operations of the war. Zachary Taylor and Henry Dodge, who served under him, were well-respected for their service during the war.

Atkinson organized the removal of the Winnebago to Iowa. A second Fort Atkinson was named in his honor in Iowa. The City of Fort Atkinson in Jefferson County, Wisconsin is also named after him. He initiated the construction of Fort Leavenworth and Jefferson Barracks (near St. Louis), where he spent the remainder of his career.

==Personal life ==
He married Mary Ann Bullitt on January 15, 1826, in the Christ Episcopal Church in Louisville, Kentucky. They had a son, Henry born in February 1827 and a son named Edward Graham Atkinson.

He died in his home on June 14, 1842. He was buried at Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery, Missouri. His body was later moved to Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, in the Bullitt-Gwathmey family lot.

<doc id="770628" wikidata="Q4074761" url="?curid=770628" title="Ben Bagdikian">
<text>Ben-hur Haig Bagdikian (January 30, 1920 – March 11, 2016) was an American journalist, news media critic and commentator, and university professor. An Armenian genocide survivor, he moved to the United States as an infant and began a journalism career after serving in World War II. He worked as a local reporter, investigative journalist and foreign correspondent for &quot;The Providence Journal&quot;. During his time there, Bagdikian won a Peabody Award and a Pulitzer Prize. In 1971, he received parts of the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot; from Daniel Ellsberg and successfully persuaded &quot;The Washington Post&quot; to publish them despite objections and threats from the Richard Nixon administration. He later taught at the University of California, Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism and served as its dean from 1985 to 1988.

Bagdikian was a critic of the news media. His 1983 book &quot;The Media Monopoly&quot;, warning about the growing concentration of corporate ownership of news organizations, went through several editions and influenced, among others, Noam Chomsky. He has been hailed for his ethical standards and has been described by Robert W. McChesney as one of the finest journalists of the 20th century.

==Personal life==
===Background===
Ben-Hur Haig Bagdikian, born in Marash, Ottoman Empire, on January 30, 1920, was the fifth and youngest child of Armenian parents Aram Toros &quot;Theodore&quot; Bagdikian (1882−1957) and Dudeh &quot;Daisy&quot; Uvezian (1886−1923). He had four sisters. His mother&#x27;s family was well-off, while his father came from a peasant family. He did graduate work at the American University of Beirut. The family was mostly based in Tarsus, where his father taught physics and chemistry at St. Paul&#x27;s College in Tarsus, run by Boston Congregationalists. His family knew English well. His father also spoke Armenian, Turkish, Arabic, and learned the Biblical languages.

His family left Marash on February 9, 1920, just ten days after Ben was born. They left during the Armenian genocide, as Turkish forces reached the city, while the French retreated. While escaping persecution, Bagdikian was dropped in the snow in the mountains while the family was climbing. Only an infant, he was thought to be dead. He was picked up when he began to cry. They arrived, first, in Boston and subsequently settled in Stoneham, Massachusetts. His father was a pastor at several Armenian churches in the Boston area (in Watertown, Cambridge) and Worcester. He had taken courses at the Harvard Divinity School and had been ordained. When Bagdikian was three years old his mother was diagnosed with tuberculosis almost immediately after arrival in Boston and died three years later, after spending some time hospitalized in sanatoriums.

Bagdikian was known throughout his life as Ben, though his baptismal name was Ben-Hur, after the Christian-themed historical novel &quot;Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ&quot; by Lew Wallace. Bagdikian grew up during the Great Depression, which, according to Robert D. McFadden, enforced a &quot;passion for social justice that shaped his reporting.&quot; He described himself as an &quot;Armenian overlaid by, of all things, the culture of New England Yankee.&quot;

===Religion===
Due to his father&#x27;s role, Bagdikian regularly attended sermons and &quot;disliked the avenging God of the Old Testament and was outraged when Abraham was prepared to obey the order to sacrifice his son as a gesture of faith.&quot; Later in adulthood, Bagdikian became a member of the First Unitarian Church of Providence, a Unitarian Universalist congregation in Rhode Island.

===Education and military service===
Bagdikian initially aspired to become a doctor because of his mother&#x27;s illness and his father&#x27;s collection of books on pulmonary diseases that he read. He graduated from Stoneham High School in 1937. He thereafter attended Clark University, in Worcester, Massachusetts, as a pre-medical student. He was editor of &quot;The Clark News&quot;, the college newspaper. He renamed it to &quot;The Clark Scarlet&quot;, based on the school&#x27;s colors. The university president, Wallace Walter Atwood, suspected it was too closely associated with communism. Having taken many chemistry courses he sought to apply for a job as a chemist upon graduating from Clark in 1941. He had the opportunity to work as a lab assistant at Monsanto in Springfield, Massachusetts.

He served as a navigator (first lieutenant) in the United States Army Air Forces from May 1942 to January 1946. He had volunteered to join the Air Forces immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941.

===Marriages===
Bagdikian married Elizabeth (Betty) Ogasapian in 1942, with whom he had two sons: Aram Christopher &quot;Chris&quot; Bagdikian (1944−2015) and Frederick, Jr. &quot;Eric&quot; Bagdikian (born 1951). They divorced in 1972. His second marriage, to Betty Medsger, a &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter, ended in divorce as well. His third wife was Marlene Griffith (born Marie Helene Ungar in Vienna), whom he married in 1983.

===Death===
Bagdikian died at his home in Berkeley, California, on March 11, 2016, aged 96. A memorial service was held at the Unitarian Universalist Church of Berkeley on June 2, 2016.

==Career==
Throughout his career, Bagdikian contributed to more than 200 national magazines and journals.

During his college years Bagdikian worked as a reporter for the &quot;Worcester Gazette&quot; and &quot;Springfield Morning Union&quot;. After World War II he briefly joined the staff of &quot;Flying Traveler&quot;, a magazine for private flying in New York.

===&quot;The Providence Journal&quot;===
Bagdikian began working for the &quot;Providence Journal&quot; in 1947 as a reporter and Washington bureau chief. He also served as a local reporter. Bagdikian and &quot;Journal&quot; editor and publisher Sevellon Brown won a Peabody Award in 1951 for their &quot;most exacting, thorough and readable check-up of broadcasts&quot; of Walter Winchell, Drew Pearson, and Fulton Lewis, leading TV and radio commentators. He was a member of the staff that received the 1953 Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting, Edition Time for coverage of a bank robbery in East Providence (including an ensuing police chase and hostage standoff) that resulted in the death of a patrolman. Bagdikian later described the paper as one of the better papers, besides their pro-Republican and anti-union editorials.

As a foreign correspondent in the Middle East, he covered the Suez Crisis in the fall of 1956 riding with an Israeli tank crew. In 1957, Bagdikian covered the civil rights movement, especially the crisis in Little Rock, Arkansas. In the fall of that year he traveled to the South with black reporter James &quot;Jim&quot; N. Rhea to cover the widespread discontent of the whites with the Supreme Court order to desegregate public schools.

===Freelance===
Bagdikian began a freelance career after leaving the &quot;Providence Journal&quot; in 1961. He researched media matters at the Library of Congress with the Guggenheim Fellowship he was awarded in 1961. Subsequently, he was a Washington-based contributing editor of &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; from 1963 to 1967. He also wrote for &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; when he focused on social issues, such as poverty, housing, and migration. Bagdikian researched news media at the RAND Corporation in 1969–70 and published a book titled &quot;The Information Machines: Their Impact on Men and the Media&quot; in 1971․ Edwin B. Parker of Stanford University praised the report for its readability, and breadth and depth of Bagdikian&#x27;s &quot;perception of technological and economic trends and his insight into potential social and political consequences.&quot;

===&quot;The Washington Post&quot;===
Bagdikian joined &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1970 and later served as its assistant managing editor and in 1972 its second ombudsman as a representative of the readers.

In June 1971 Bagdikian, as the assistant managing editor for national news at the &quot;Post&quot;, met with Daniel Ellsberg, a military analyst and former RAND Corporation colleague, who in a Boston-area motel passed him 4,000 pages of the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;, excerpts from which were published by &quot;The New York Times&quot; days earlier and halted by a federal judge. Bagdikian flew with the Papers to Washington, where he physically presented them in large boxes to executive editor Ben Bradlee at the latter&#x27;s home; he also gave the Papers to US Senator Mike Gravel on June 26 in front of the Mayflower Hotel. While the &quot;Post&quot; lawyers and management were opposed, Bagdikian argued strongly in favor of publication of the documents despite pressure from the Nixon administration not to on national security grounds. Bagdikian famously stated: &quot;the (only) way to assert the right to publish is to publish.&quot; The first part was published by the &quot;Post&quot; on June 18, 1971. William Rehnquist phoned &quot;Post&quot; executive editor Bradlee and threatened him with prosecution if the publication of the documents was not stopped. In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court decided 6–3 that &quot;to exercise prior restraint, the Government must show sufficient evidence that the publication would cause a &#x27;grave and irreparable&#x27; danger.&quot;

Just months after the publication of the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot; Bagdikian became an undercover inmate at the Huntingdon State Correctional Institution, a maximum-security prison in Pennsylvania, to expose the harsh prison conditions. With permission from the attorney general of Pennsylvania, he disguised himself as a murderer to observe the prison life without the knowledge of anyone inside the prison. He remained there for six days and his eight-part series on the conditions of the prison were published in the &quot;Post&quot; from January 29 to February 6, 1972. He reported &quot;widespread racial tension behind bars, outbursts of violence, open &#x27;homosexualism&#x27; and an elaborate, yet fragile, code of etiquette.&quot; Bagdikian and &quot;Post&quot; reporter Leon Dash published the series first as a report in 1972 and later as a book (1976).

Bagdikian left the &quot;Post&quot; in August 1972 after clashing with Bradlee &quot;as a conduit of outside and internal complaints.&quot;

===UC Berkeley===
Bagdikian wrote for the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; from 1972 to 1974. He taught at University of California, Berkeley from 1976 until his retirement in 1990. He taught courses such as Introduction to Journalism and Ethics in Journalism. He was the dean of the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism from 1985 to 1988. He was named Professor Emeritus upon departure.

==Media criticism==
In an interview with PBS&#x27;s &quot;Frontline&quot; Bagdikian stated that while the First Amendment allows newspapers to print anything, especially unpopular things, newspapers have an implied moral obligation to be responsible, because of their power on popular opinion and because the First Amendment was &quot;framed with the supposition that there would be multiple sources of information.&quot;

Bagdikian was an early advocate of in-house critics, or ombudsmen in newspapers, who he believed, would &quot;address public concerns about journalistic practices.&quot; He described the treatment of news about tobacco and related health issues as &quot;one of the original sins of the media,&quot; because &quot;for decades, there was suppression of medical evidence ... plain suppression.&quot; Bagdikian criticized the wide use of anonymous sources in news media, the acceptance of government narratives by reporters, particularly on &quot;national security&quot; grounds. Bagdikian formulated a law, dubbed the Bagdikian Law of Journalism: &quot;The accuracy of news reports of an event is inversely proportional to the number of reporters on the scene.&quot;

He was a harsh critic of TV news and the celebrity status of news anchors, which he argued, was the &quot;worst thing that can happen to a journalist.&quot; He noted, &quot;The job of the celebrity is to be observed, to make sure others learn about him or her, to be the object of attention rather than an observer.&quot; Bagdikian stressed the importance of local media. He argued that only locally based journalism can adequately report the local issues and candidates, otherwise &quot;voters become captives of the only alternative information, paid political propaganda, or no information at all.&quot; Regarding online journalism, Bagdikian stated that there is &quot;lots of junk on it, but it&#x27;s still an outlet for an independent with no money but plenty of ingenuity and skill, like MoveOn.org. It&#x27;s not controlled by the corporations. Not yet.&quot;

Bagdikian was a regular &quot;New York Times&quot; reader, and appreciated &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The Progressive&quot;, alternative radio, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;; he also read &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; to &quot;get a view of the total picture most magazine readers are getting.&quot; He also occasionally read the &quot;National Review&quot; and &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; &quot;to know what the right is thinking.&quot; Bagdikian recommended &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The Progressive&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; for those who wanted to stay informed but have limited time to do so.

In 1987 Bagdikian testified on the effects of profit on news reporting before the House Energy Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, along with economist John Kenneth Galbraith. Both Galbraith and Bagdikian voiced their concerns about the takeover of TV networks by large corporations.

==Publications==
Bagdikian&#x27;s first book, &quot;In the Midst of Plenty: The Poor in America&quot;, was published in 1964 by Beacon Press and covered various categories of poverty in America, including the poor in Appalachia, the elderly in Los Angeles, men in flophouses in Chicago, and others. His studies at the RAND Corporation produced two books: &quot;The Information Machines: Their Impact on Men and the Media&quot; and &quot;The Effete Conspiracy and Other Crimes by the Press&quot;, published by Harper &amp; Row in 1971 and 1972, respectively.

His memoir, &quot;Double Vision: Reflections on My Heritage, Life and Profession&quot;, was published by Beacon Press in 1995.

===&quot;The Media Monopoly&quot;===
In 1983 Bagdikian authored a widely cited and acclaimed work, &quot;The Media Monopoly&quot;, which was published by Beacon Press after it was rejected by Simon &amp; Schuster. Richard E. Snyder, Simon &amp; Schuster&#x27;s president, was, according to Bagdikian, &quot;vehemently opposed to the manuscript, because, among other reasons, [Snyder] felt it made all corporations look bad.&quot; The book examines the increasing concentration of the media in the US in the hands of corporate owners, which, he argued, threatened freedom of expression and independent journalism. He wrote that some 50 corporations controlled what most people in the United States read and watched. Bagdikian argued that &quot;media power is political power.&quot; The book went into 5 more editions—in 1987, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2000. In 2004, &quot;The New Media Monopoly&quot; was published, essentially the 7th edition of the original. In 2000 Bagdikian stated, &quot;Every edition has been considered by some to be alarmist and every edition ends up being too conservative.&quot; In this latest version, Bagdikian wrote that the number of corporations controlling most of the media decreased to five: Disney, News Corporation, Time Warner, Viacom, and Bertelsmann. He argued, &quot;This gives each of the five corporations and their leaders more communications power than was exercised by any despot or dictatorship in history.&quot;

The book became a &quot;standard text for many college classes&quot; and, along with &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot; by Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky, in the opinion of Neil Henry, is a work that is the &quot;most widely cited scholarly work about the effects of economics on modern news media practices, including market and political pressures that determine news content.&quot; The book was criticized by Jack Shafer for alleged bias. &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, though accepting such problems, declared that it is a &quot;groundbreaking work that charts a historic shift in the orientation of the majority of America&#x27;s communications media—further away from the needs of the individual and closer to those of big business.&quot;

==Political views==
Bagdikian was a self-proclaimed advocate for social justice. He described the McCarthy era as &quot;very reactionary.&quot; In 1997 Bagdikian opined that &quot;criticizing capitalism has never been a popular subject in the general news.&quot; In the 2000 U.S. presidential election Bagdikian endorsed Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate. He was a founding member of the grassroots network Armenians for Nader. He stated: &quot;I think Ralph Nader has already powerfully defined the issues in this campaign and has had influence on the positions of both major party candidates.&quot; He argued that &quot;there&#x27;s a natural hostility among corporate organizations toward Nader, because they see him as the person who&#x27;s embarrassed them endlessly and sees them as part of the national political problem.&quot;

He appeared on KPFK along with Serj Tankian and Peter Balakian on April 24, 2005, to talk about the Armenian Genocide.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had a 200-page file on Bagdikian spanning from 1951 to 1971. One document described him as well known in FBI files as a &quot;writer who has criticized the FBI in the past. He has made snide remarks relative to&quot; FBI director J. Edgar Hoover and &quot;some of his work has been described [specifically, by Hoover] as &#x27;utter bunk&#x27;.&quot; When Bagdikian requested all his FBI record under the Freedom of Information Act in 1975, the FBI withheld records on the part he played in the Pentagon Papers case. They were not released until 2018.

==Legacy and recognition==
C. Edwin Baker describes Bagdikian as &quot;probably the most quoted, certainly one of the most acute, commentators on media ownership.&quot; Arthur S. Hayes, Fordham University professor, wrote in his 2008 book &quot;Press Critics Are the Fifth Estate&quot; that Bagdikian has been &quot;farsighted, inspirational, influential, long lasting, and a forerunner.&quot; Sociologist Alfred McClung Lee praised Bagdikian as having the virtues of both an investigative journalist and a participant-observing social scientist. Robert D. McFadden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Bagdikian &quot;a celebrated voice of conscience for his profession, calling for tougher standards of integrity and public service in an era of changing tastes and technology.&quot; Edward Wasserman, the dean of the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism at the time of his death, Bagdikian was a &quot;major figure in 20th century US journalism and journalism education, and we&#x27;re all his beneficiaries.&quot; Jeff Cohen, the founder of the media watch group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) stated:
Michael Moore has named &quot;The Media Monopoly&quot; the most influential book he ever read. Robert W. McChesney, who cites Bagdikian as one of the strongest influences on him, called Bagdikian one of the finest journalists of the 20th century. McChesney argued that Bagdikian was &quot;certainly accorded more respect by working journalists&quot; than Herman and Chomsky, the authors of &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot;, due to their perceived radicalism, in contrast to Bagdikian&#x27;s liberal views. Progressive journalist and writer John Nichols, writing for &quot;The Nation&quot;, called Bagdikian a &quot;pioneering media reformer.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;, he said of Bagdikian :
The &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot; controversy at &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was recounted in the Steven Spielberg film &quot;The Post&quot; (2017), where Bagdikian was played by Bob Odenkirk.

<text>Air combat manoeuvring (ACM) is the tactic of moving, turning, and situating one&#x27;s fighter aircraft in order to attain a position from which an attack can be made on another aircraft. Commonly associated with dogfighting, air combat manoeuvres rely on offensive and defensive basic fighter manoeuvring (BFM) to gain an advantage over an aerial opponent.

== Historical overview ==
Military aviation originated in World War I when aircraft were initially used to spot enemy troop concentrations, field gun positions, and movements. Early aerial combat consisted of aviators shooting at one another with hand-held weapons. The first recorded aircraft to be shot down by another aircraft, which occurred on October 5, 1914, was a German Aviatik B.I. The pilot, Feldwebel Wilhelm Schlichting, was shot with a carbine wielded by observer Louis Quenault, who was riding in a French Voisin III piloted by Sergeant Joseph Frantz. The need to stop reconnaissance that was being conducted by enemy aircraft rapidly led to the development of fighter planes, a class of aircraft designed specifically to destroy other aircraft.

Fixed, forward-firing guns were found to be the most effective armament for a majority of World War I era fighter planes, but it was nearly impossible to fire them through the spinning propeller of one&#x27;s own aircraft without destroying one&#x27;s own plane. Roland Garros, working with Morane Saulnier Aéroplanes, was the first to solve this problem by attaching steel deflector wedges to the propeller. He achieved three kills but was shot down by ground fire and landed behind German lines. Anthony Fokker inspected the plane&#x27;s wreckage and learned to improve the design by connecting the firing mechanism of the gun to the timing of the engine, thus allowing the gun to fire through the propeller without making contact with the propeller. As technology rapidly advanced, new and young aviators began defining the realm of air-to-air combat, such as Max Immelmann, Oswald Boelcke, and Lanoe Hawker. One of the greatest of these &quot;ace pilots&quot; of World War I, Manfred von Richthofen (the Red Baron), wrote in his book &quot;The Red Fighter Pilot&quot;, &quot;The great thing in air fighting is that the decisive factor does not lie in trick flying but solely in the personal ability and energy of the aviator. A flying man may be able to loop and do all the stunts imaginable and yet he may not succeed in shooting down a single enemy.&quot;

Pilots soon learned to achieve a firing position (while avoiding the threat of enemy guns) by manoeuvring themselves behind an enemy aircraft; this is known as getting onto an aircraft&#x27;s &quot;six o&#x27;clock&quot; or onto their &quot;tail&quot;, plus a wide variety of other terms, usually coined by air crew. This type of combat became known as dogfighting. Oswald Boelcke, a German fighter ace during World War I, was the first to publish the basic rules for aerial combat manoeuvring in 1916, known as the &quot;Dicta Boelcke&quot;. He advised pilots to attack from the direction of the sun (toward which the defending pilot could not see), or to fly at a higher altitude than the opponent. Most of these rules are still as valuable today as they were a century ago.

Today&#x27;s air combat is much more complicated than that of older times, as air-to-air missiles, radar, and automatic cannons capable of high rates of fire are used on nearly all modern fighter aircraft. New and additional types of manoeuvres have emerged, intending to break radar lock by minimizing the Doppler signature of one&#x27;s own aircraft (&quot;keeping the enemy at 3 or 9 o&#x27;clock&quot;), or to exhaust the kinetic energy of an incoming missile (by changing the aircraft&#x27;s course from side to side, the missile, not flying directly at target but trying to forestall it, will make sharper turns and will eventually have to fly a longer path). However, close-range fighting with infrared guided missiles and aircraft cannons still obeys the same general rules laid down in the skies over Europe in the early 20th century. The master rule is still the same: get on the opponent&#x27;s rear without allowing them to do the same.

Close-range combat tactics vary considerably according to the type of aircraft being used and the number of aircraft involved.

==Tactics==

There are five things a pilot must remain aware of when contemplating aerial engagement; of these, seeing and keeping sight of one&#x27;s opponent are the most important. In Southeast Asia, over 85 percent of all kills are attributed to the attacker spotting and shooting the defender without ever being seen. Structural limitations of the attacking and defending fighters must be taken into account, such as thrust-to-weight ratio, wing loading, and the &quot;corner speed&quot; (the maximum or minimum speed at which the aircraft can attain the best turning performance). Variable limitations must also be considered, such as turn radius, turn rate and the specific energy of the aircraft. Position of aircraft must quickly be assessed, including direction, angle off tail (the angle between flight paths), and closing speed. Also, the pilot must be aware of his wingman&#x27;s position and maintain good communication.

A pilot in combat attempts to conserve his aircraft&#x27;s energy through carefully timed and executed manoeuvres. By using such manoeuvres, a pilot will often make trade offs between the fighter&#x27;s potential energy (altitude) and kinetic energy (airspeed), to maintain the energy-to-weight ratio of the aircraft, or the &quot;specific energy&quot;. A manoeuvre such as the &quot;low yo-yo&quot; trades altitude for airspeed to close on an enemy and to decrease turn radius. The opposite manoeuvre, a &quot;high yo-yo&quot;, trades speed for height, literally storing energy in &quot;the altitude bank&quot;, which allows a fast moving attacker to slow his closing speed.

An attacker is confronted with three possible ways to pursue an enemy, all of which are vital during chase. &quot;Lag pursuit&quot; happens in a turn when the nose of the attacker&#x27;s aircraft points behind an enemy&#x27;s tail. Lag pursuit allows an attacker to increase or maintain range without overshooting. &quot;Lead pursuit&quot; in a turn occurs when the nose of the attacking aircraft points ahead of the enemy. Lead pursuit is used to decrease the distance between aircraft, and during gun attacks when the cannons must be aimed, not at where the defender is, but where he will be when the bullets get there. &quot;Pure pursuit&quot; happens when the nose of the attacker points directly at the defender. Pure pursuit is when most missiles will be fired, and is the hardest position to maintain. These are known as pursuit curves.

The turning battle of a dogfight can be executed in an infinite number of geometric planes. Pilots are encouraged to keep their manoeuvres out of the strictly vertical and horizontal planes, but to instead use the limitless number of oblique planes, which is much harder for an adversary to track. This infinite number of planes around a fixed point about which the aircraft turns is termed the &quot;post and bubble&quot;. A fighter that can maintain position between an aircraft and its imaginary post cannot be attacked by that aircraft. The imaginary bubble, however, is misshapen by gravity, causing turns to be much tighter and slower at the top, and wider and faster at the bottom, and is sometimes referred to as a &quot;tactical egg&quot;.

The manoeuvres employed by the attacker can also be used by the defender to evade, or gain a tactical advantage over his opponent. Other components may also be employed to manoeuvre the aircraft, such as yaw, drag, lift, and thrust vectors. A key factor in all battles is that of &quot;nose-tail separation&quot;. While getting close enough to fire a weapon, an attacker must keep his aircraft&#x27;s nose far enough away from the tail of the defender to be able to get a good aim, and to prevent an overshoot. The defender, likewise, will use every manoeuvre available to encourage an overshoot, trying to change his own role to that of attacker.

<text>Edward Abnel Keli&#x27;iahonui Kawānanakoa (October 2, 1924 – July 29, 1997) was a member of the House of Kawānanakoa.

== Life ==
He was born October 2, 1924, to Abigail Kawānanakoa and her first husband, Andrew Anderson Lambert, in San Francisco, California. He was named after his great-uncle Prince Edward Abnel Keliʻiahonui who died at a young age.

His grandfather David Kawānanakoa (1868–1908) was officially named as one of the heirs to King David Kalākaua in his will. Although many in the native Hawaiian community considered him the heir to the throne, he considered himself an American citizen. As one of several heirs to the estate of his great-grandfather James Campbell, he often donated to community charities. He graduated from Punahou School and then left in 1942 for Menlo College. While in California, he joined the Army Air Corps and served as a pilot in World War II. He rejected an appointment to the United States Military Academy and instead obtained a degree from the University of Southern California.

In 1946, Kawānanakoa married Lila de Clark Whitaker. In 1960, the couple were divorced. The next year, Kawānanakoa married again to Carolyn Branch and had two children of their own. On July 29, 1997, Kawānanakoa died and was survived by his wife, eight children and his two sisters, Virginia Poomaikelani Kawānanakoa and Esther Kapiolani Kawānanakoa and cousin Abigail Kinoiki Kekaulike Kawānanakoa.
He was buried at the Oahu Cemetery.

== Children ==

<text>USS &quot;Absegami&quot; (SP-371) was a motorboat acquired on a free lease by the United States Navy during World War I. She was outfitted as an armed patrol craft and assigned to patrol the Delaware River from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Cape May, New Jersey on the Delaware Bay. When the Navy found her excess to their needs, she was returned to her former owner.

==Construction and career==
===Built in New York===
&quot;Absegami&quot; was a motor boat built in 1916 at New York City by the New York Yacht, Launch &amp; Engine Co.; acquired by the Navy on free lease from her owner, Allen K. White, Atlantic City, New Jersey, on 2 May 1917; and commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 30 April 1917, Ensign W. G. Morse .

===World War I service===
Following her commissioning, &quot;Absegami&quot; was assigned to section patrol duty in the 4th Naval District. Throughout World War I, the boat patrolled the Delaware Bay and Atlantic Ocean waters off Cape May, New Jersey. &quot;Absegami&quot; was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 2 December 1918 and returned to her owner four days later.

<text>The 1927 World Snooker Championship was a snooker tournament held at several venues from 29 November 1926 to 12 May 1927. At the time, it was titled the Professional Championship of Snooker but it is now recognised as the inaugural edition of the World Snooker Championship. The impetus for the championship came from professional English billiards player Joe Davis and billiard hall manager Bill Camkin, who had both observed the growing popularity of snooker, and proposed the event to the Billiards Association and Control Council. Ten players entered the competition, including most of the leading English billiards players. The two matches in the preliminary round were held at Thurston&#x27;s Hall in London, and the semi-finals and final took place at Camkin&#x27;s Hall in Birmingham. The players involved determined the venues for the quarter-finals, resulting in matches in London, Birmingham, Nottingham and Liverpool.

The final took place from 9 to 12 May 1927. Joe Davis won the title by defeating Tom Dennis by 20 to 11. Davis had led 7–1 following the first day&#x27;s play and had achieved a winning margin at 16–7. The highest break of the tournament was 60, compiled by Albert Cope in the 21st frame of his match against Davis. It remained the highest break in the Championship until Davis made a 61 in the 1929 final. The same trophy awarded to Davis is still presented to the world champion each year.

==Background==
Professional English billiards player and billiard hall manager Joe Davis had noticed the growing popularity of snooker compared to billiards in the 1920s, as had Birmingham-based billiard hall manager Bill Camkin. They persuaded the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC) to recognise an official professional snooker championship in the 1926–27 season. The BACC&#x27;s secretary, A. Stanley Thorn, had rejected a request in 1924 from professional Tom Dennis, doubting that snooker was popular enough to attract large enough audiences to make such a competition viable.

Davis drafted the conditions under which a championship could take place, after a conversation with Camkin, and sent it to the BACC, who gave their consent. At its meeting on 1 September 1926, the Professional Championship Committee of the BACC agreed the terms for the tournament, and set a closing date for entries of 1 November 1926. All professional players of English billiards were eligible to enter. The preliminary round matches were to be held at Thurston&#x27;s Hall in London, and the venue for the semi-finals and final was to be Camkin&#x27;s Hall on John Bright Street in Birmingham, the players having to arrange dates and venues for the other matches. The winner of the tournament would retain the title until either they resigned it, they were defeated in a BACC-sanctioned championship match, or they refused to defend it against a BACC-approved challenger; with a proviso that the champion would not be required to defend the title more than once a year. Match referees would require BACC approval, and the games were to be played with composition balls and under the official BACC rules of snooker. Stanley Thorn wrote that the decision to promote a professional championship was &quot;in view of the increasing popularity of the game of snooker&quot;, and added that &quot;the winner will be declared on the number of games won, but the conditions state that play shall be continued until the full number of games has been completed&quot;; therefore s were played after the result of each match was determined. The final was played over 31 s, the semi-finals were 23 frames, and the earlier matches were 15 frames.

The entry fee was five guineas per player, with a five-guineas wager between the players for each match. Gate receipts for each match, after expenses, were to be equally shared out between the players concerned. The terms specified that half of the total entry fees would go to the finalists, the winner receiving sixty percent of the part allocated to prize money. Davis, the eventual champion, received £6 and 10 shillings from gate receipts, but the BACC used £19 from the players&#x27; part of the entry fees, which were expected to be used as prize money, towards purchasing the trophy. Snooker historian Clive Everton wrote that when the official professional snooker tournament started, &quot;Billiards was still very much the premier game, with snooker a sideshow which few were convinced would ever come to much as a public entertainment,&quot; and that the early championships received &quot;minimal publicity&quot;. The same trophy awarded to Davis is still presented to the world champion each year.

Ten players entered the championship. There were two matches in a preliminary round; the two winners of these would join the other six players in the quarter-finals. &quot;The Observer&quot;&#x27;s correspondent opined that &quot;the policy of playing a serious [snooker] match in conjunction with the billiards has proved an additional public attraction&quot;, and that only three of the leading billiards players, Willie Smith, Tom Reece, and Arthur Peall, had declined to participate in the championship. An article in the &quot;Athletic News&quot; said that the field of entrants was &quot;on the whole representative and piquant&quot;.

Originally called the Professional Championship of Snooker, the annual competition was re-titled as the World Championship in 1935, but the 1927 tournament is now referred to as the first World Snooker Championship.

==Schedule==
==Summary==
The first match was between Melbourne Inman and Tom Newman; it was held at Thurston&#x27;s Hall, Leicester Square in London, as an extra attraction to the main event, a billiards match between them. The match took place on an experimental billiard table with inch , inch smaller than normal. The winner of the billiards match would be the first player to reach 16,000 points, with Inman receiving a 3,500 handicap head start. The match started on 29 November 1926 with two sessions per day until 11 December. One frame of snooker was played at the end of each . Inman won the first two frames, but after eight frames Newman led 5–3. Inman then won the next five frames to secure victory 8–5, the match finishing on the Monday afternoon, a week after it started. Newman won the billiards match easily 16,000–13,039 despite giving a 3,500 handicap.

Tom Dennis and Fred Lawrence played their match on 9 and 10 December at the Lord Nelson Hotel, Carlton Street, Nottingham. Dennis led 5–3 after the first day. Although Dennis won the first frame on the second afternoon, Lawrence won the other three to leave the match level at 6–6. In the evening session Dennis won the first two frames to eliminate Lawrence 8–6.

Joe Davis and Joe Brady met on 29 and 30 December 1926 in Cable Street, Liverpool. Davis won all four frames in the afternoon and led 5–3 at the end of the first day. The match ended 10–5 on the second day, with Davis having achieved a winning margin at 8–5.

Tom Carpenter and Nat Butler played their match on 31 December 1926 and 1 January 1927 at Thurston&#x27;s Hall. There were eight frames played on the first day, in two sessions. The score was 2–2 after the afternoon but Carpenter won all four in the evening to lead 6–2. Butler won the first frame on the second day but Carpenter won the next two to win 8–3.

The first semi-final saw Joe Davis meet Albert Cope over three days from 31 January to 2 February in Birmingham. On the first day Davis won the four afternoon frames and three of the four in the evening to lead 7–1. On the second day Davis extended his lead to 10–1 before Cope won three successive frames. Davis still led 11–4 overnight, just one frame from victory. On the final day Davis won the first frame to take the match 12–4. He took two more frames in the afternoon to lead 14–5 and eventually won 16–7. Cope made a 60 break in frame 21, winning the frame 87–24. Cope&#x27;s break of 60 was the highest made in the tournament, and in recognition of this Cope would receive a commemorative certificate from the BACC. The break remained the best in the Championship until Davis made a 61 in the 1929 final.

The match between Inman and Carpenter was also played at Thurston&#x27;s Hall, Leicester Square in London. As with the game between Inman and Newman, it was an extra to a billiards match. The billiards match was to 7,000 with Carpenter receiving a 1,000 start. The match lasted from Monday 14 to Saturday 19 March 1927 with two sessions per day. One frame of snooker was generally played in each session, although with a possible 15 frames and only 12 sessions, two frames were required on occasions. Two frames were played on the Wednesday afternoon. Carpenter won the evening frame on the Friday to win the match 8–3, having led throughout. Carpenter also won the billiards match, which finished the following day, 7,000–4,798.

The second semi-final, between Dennis and Carpenter, was held from 20 to 22 April in Birmingham. Carpenter led 5–3 after the first day but Dennis won all four frames on the second afternoon to lead 7–5. The second day ended with Dennis 9–7 ahead. Carpenter won three frames on the final afternoon to level the match at 10–10 but Dennis won the first two in the evening to complete a 12–10 victory.

Starting on 25 April, Newman and Davis contested the BACC Professional Billiards Championship, a title later recognised as the world championship for billiards. During the match, Davis compiled a billiards championship record break of 2,501, using the shot, where the are kept near a corner pocket for repeated strokes. Newman won the match 16,000–14,763 on 7 May.

===Final===
The snooker final between Davis and Dennis was played from 9 to 12 May at Camkin&#x27;s Hall in Birmingham and was refereed by Camkin. Davis won the first seven frames before Dennis took the last of the day to give Davis a 7–1 lead after the first day. Davis won three frames on the second afternoon and, although the evening session was shared, Davis led 12–4. Davis made a 57 break in frame 11, winning the frame 78–32. Davis secured a winning lead by taking the 23rd frame 80–34 to lead 16–7. Both sessions on the third day were shared, to leave Davis 16–8 ahead. Davis won four of the seven frames on the last day, resulting in a final score of 20–11. Davis was presented with the trophy by the BACC chairman John C. Bissett. After each of the sessions on 12 May, Davis was scheduled to perform an exhibition of the billiards pendulum cannon, which by that time was already on the way to being restricted in competitive play by the BACC.

Writing about the snooker final in &quot;The Billiard Player&quot;, Arthur Goundrill commented that &quot;without casting any doubts on Dennis&#x27;s skill as a player, it may be said that Davis is in a class by himself at the 22-ball game. &#x27;Extraordinary&#x27; is the only way to describe his potting, and his positional play is perfect in its conception.&quot; Quoting Davis&#x27;s brother Fred Davis, who said that &quot;Joe was a great player before anyone else knew how to play the game,&quot; Everton added &quot;he was certainly far too good for his rivals in the early championships&quot;. Davis went on to win the World Championship every year until 1940, after which the event was on hold, due to World War II, until 1946, when he won his fifteenth title and announced that he would no longer play in the tournament.

<doc id="770656" wikidata="Q3495282" url="?curid=770656" title="St. Louis Arena">
<text>St. Louis Arena (known as the Checkerdome from 1977 to 1983) was an indoor arena in St. Louis, Missouri. The country&#x27;s second-largest indoor entertainment venue when it opened in 1929, it was home to the St. Louis Blues and other sports franchises. The Arena sat across U.S.40 (now I-64) from Forest Park&#x27;s Aviation Field.

The Arena hosted conventions, concerts, political rallies, horse shows, circuses, boxing matches, professional wrestling, Roller Derby competitions, indoor soccer matches, the 1973 and 1978 NCAA men&#x27;s basketball Final Four, the NCAA Men&#x27;s Midwest Regional finals in 1982, 1984, and 1993, the 1992–94 Missouri Valley Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament, the 1968, 1969, and 1970 Stanley Cup Finals, and the 1975 NCAA Frozen Four ice hockey finals.

It was demolished in 1999.

==History==
At the conclusion of the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair, St. Louis ended its long tradition of annually hosting large indoor agriculture and horse shows. The city tore down its huge St. Louis Exposition and Music Hall and built the St. Louis Coliseum which was aimed at individual events such as boxing matches.

In 1928 the National Dairy Show offered the city the opportunity to become the permanent location for its annual two-week meeting of dairymen and their prize animals. With no public funds available, a group of businessmen raised private funding for what was projected as a $2 million building. The National Exposition Company in charge of the project hired Gustel R. Kiewitt as architect and the Boaz-Kiel Construction Company as general contractor. 
Kiewit&#x27;s design called for a lamella roof supported by 20 cantilever steel trusses, eliminating the need for view-obscuring internal support pillars. The lamella design consisted of Douglas fir ribs, thick, wide and long, fitted together diagonally and giving the appearance of fish scales. The huge structure was completed in 1929, just over a year after construction began. At long and wide, it was behind only Madison Square Garden as the largest indoor entertainment space in the country. A 13-story building could have been erected inside of it. 
The Arena was not well-maintained after the 1940s, and its roof was damaged by a February 1959 tornado. After repairs, it was re-opened as the home of the Central Hockey League&#x27;s St. Louis Braves, a Chicago Black Hawks farm team. The renovations included the removal of the fencing that enforced segregation, dating back to the time of the St. Louis Eagles.

On March 19, 1971, the St. Louis Stars hosted the 1971 NASL Professional Hoc-Soc Tournament here, which was the first indoor soccer tournament sanctioned by a Division One professional league in U.S. history.

In the 1973 NCAA Basketball Final, the UCLA Bruins and legendary coach John Wooden defeated Memphis State 87–66, behind 44 points from Bill Walton who went 21 of 22 from the floor. Over 19,000 were in attendance at the Arena.

On February 13, 1974, the St. Louis Stars played host to the Red Army team at the Arena in the final match of Russian squad&#x27;s three-city indoor soccer tour of North America. Attendance for the match was 12,241.

In the 1978 NCAA Basketball Final, the Kentucky Wildcats and coach Joe B. Hall defeated Duke 94–88, led by the 41-point effort of Jack Givens.

From 1980 to 1993, St. Louis Arena was the site of the Braggin&#x27; Rights basketball game played between the University of Missouri and the University of Illinois.

===Spirits of St. Louis – ABA Era (1974–76)===
After the 1968 departure of the NBA&#x27;s Hawks, the Carolina Cougars moved to the city and took the name Spirits of St. Louis. The Spirits played in the Arena for the final two seasons of the American Basketball Association (ABA), 1974–75 and 1975–76. Their announcer on KMOX radio was a young Bob Costas. Young players such as Steve Jones (&quot;Snapper&quot;, now a TV analyst), Marvin Barnes (&quot;Bad News), Maurice Lucas and Moses Malone all played for the Spirits during their tenure at the Arena. The team was not included in the ABA–NBA merger in 1976, when the Indiana Pacers, San Antonio Spurs, Denver Nuggets and New York Nets joined the NBA. The Spirits and the Kentucky Colonels were disbanded.
Spirits owners Ozzie and Daniel Silna pulled off a coup in their dissolution agreement when the ABA–NBA merger was finalized. The Silnas negotiated to receive a portion of TV monies in perpetuity, a deal that netted them over $250 million before they were bought out by the NBA in 2014 for a reported $500 million.

===The St. Louis Blues era (1967–1994)===
By the time the NHL&#x27;s St. Louis Blues began playing at the Arena, it had fallen into such poor condition that it had to be heavily renovated for the 1967–68 season. As a condition of getting the expansion franchise, Blues owner Sid Salomon Jr. purchased the Arena from the Chicago Black Hawks and spent several million dollars to renovate the building and add some 3,000 seats, bringing the total to almost 15,000. It never stopped being renovated from that day on, and held almost 20,000 seats by the time the Blues left the Arena in 1994. Many fans considered its sight lines the best of any arena in the league, which is remarkable considering that it was not originally built for hockey. It was also known as one of the loudest arenas in the league.

The Blues played their first game at the Arena on October 11, 1967, against the Minnesota North Stars, which ended in a 2–2 tie. Bill Masterton scored the building&#x27;s first goal while Larry Keenan scored the first Blues goal.

In 1977, the Arena and the Blues were purchased by Ralston Purina, which rechristened the building the Checkerdome after the company&#x27;s checkerboard logo. By 1983, the cereal and pet food corporation had lost interest in the Blues and the Arena, and forfeited the team to the league. The team was nearly moved to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, before it was purchased by Harry Ornest, a Los Angeles-based businessman, who promptly returned the Arena to its original name.

The Blues played their final game at the Arena on April 24, 1994, losing game four of the first round to the Dallas Stars 2–1. Phil Housley scored the Blues&#x27; final goal in the Arena while Dallas&#x27; Mike Modano scored the building&#x27;s final two goals.

After the Blues moved to their new home, the venue now known as Enterprise Center, during the 1994 offseason, the final event at the St. Louis Arena was a concert by Christian artist Carman Licciardello.

===Closure and demolition (1994–1999)===

As a condition for the private financing of the demolition of city-owned Kiel Auditorium and the construction of privately owned Kiel Center (now the Enterprise Center) on the same Downtown site, local business group Civic Progress, Inc. insisted that the Cheltenham-neighborhood would not be allowed to compete with Kiel Center for any events, while the insurance burden for the building was left with the City of St. Louis. With no income allowed for the Arena while insurance expenses continued, the building sat vacant while pressure built on the city government to either make it revenue-producing (essentially impossible under the Civic Progress-imposed non-compete clause) or raze it. The Arena remained vacant for nearly five years before it was demolished in 1999.

===The Arena site today===
A business/residential development, The Highlands (named after an amusement park that was once adjacent to the site), now occupies the land that the St. Louis Arena called home, and includes the following:
*Four apartment buildings, of which the two northern-most feature loft-style units.
*A Hampton Inn hotel, Mac&#x27;s Local Eats - a Farm to table Cheeseburger restaurant, a coffee shop and bakery, Children&#x27;s Miracle Network Hospitals of Greater St. Louis, and a yoga studio.
*1001 Highlands Plaza Drive West, an office building home to—among other businesses—the St. Louis group of iHeartMedia&#x27;s radio stations (KSLZ, KATZ-FM, KTLK-FM, KATZ, KLOU, and KSD).
*A grass plaza, with an oval grass section surrounded by concrete sidewalks now sits at 1001 Highlands Plaza Drive West at the location where the original arena stood.
*A medical office building.

==Sports teams==
Sports teams that called the Arena home include:

*St. Louis Flyers of the AHA and AHL (1929–1953)
*St. Louis Eagles of the NHL (1934–1935)
*Chicago Black Hawks of the NHL (occasional use, 1953–1959)
*St. Louis Braves of the CHL (1963–1967)
*St. Louis Blues of the NHL (1967–1994)

It rises in northern Lane County, approximately northeast of Springfield. It flows generally southwest and enters the McKenzie from the north on the north side of Springfield. The river&#x27;s valley is known as the Mohawk Valley.

The Mohawk River was probably given its name by Jacob C. Spores in 1849. Spores was a native of the Mohawk River region of New York, and the Oregon river&#x27;s valley reminded him of the Mohawk Valley in his home state. In turn, the Oregon river gave its name to the Mohawk River band of Kalapuyan Native Americans who inhabited the river valley in the 19th century. They are not related to the Mohawk tribe in the eastern United States.

Current and former settlements in the Mohawk Valley include Mabel, Marcola, Mohawk, and Wendling.

Named tributaries from source to mouth are North Fork Mohawk River and South Fork Mohawk River followed by Log, Bette, Drury, Shotgun, Polly, Mill, and Cartwright creeks. Further downstream come Parsons and McGowan creeks, then Alder Branch followed by Spores, Stafford, and Sister creeks.

<doc id="770661" wikidata="Q1992046" url="?curid=770661" title="Thurstone scale">
<text>In psychology and sociology, the Thurstone scale was the first formal technique to measure an attitude. It was developed by Louis Leon Thurstone in 1928, originally as a means of measuring attitudes towards religion. Today it is used to measure attitudes towards a wide variety of issues. The technique uses a number of statements about a particular issue, and each statement is given a numerical value indicating how favorable or unfavorable it is judged to be. These numerical values are prepared ahead of time by the researcher and not shown to the test subjects. The subjects then check each of the statements with which they agree, and a mean score of those statements&#x27; values is computed, indicating their attitude.

==Thurstone scale==
Thurstone&#x27;s method of pair comparisons can be considered a prototype of a normal distribution-based method for scaling-dominance matrices. Even though the theory behind this method is quite complex (Thurstone, 1927a), the algorithm itself is straightforward. For the basic Case V, the frequency dominance matrix is translated into proportions and interfaced with the standard scores. The scale is then obtained as a left-adjusted column marginal average of this standard score matrix (Thurstone, 1927b). The underlying rationale for the method and basis for the measurement of the &quot;psychological scale separation between any two stimuli&quot; derives from Thurstone&#x27;s Law of comparative judgment (Thurstone, 1928). ASU

The principal difficulty with this algorithm is its indeterminacy with respect to one-zero proportions, which return z values as plus or minus infinity, respectively. The inability of the pair comparisons algorithm to handle these cases imposes considerable limits on the applicability of the method.

The most frequent recourse when the 1.00-0.00 frequencies are encountered is their omission. Thus, e.g., Guilford (1954, p. 163) has recommended not using proportions more extreme than .977 or .023, and Edwards (1957, pp. 41–42) has suggested that &quot; “if the number of judges is large, say 200 or more, then we might use pij values of .99 and .01, but with less than 200 judges, it is probably better to disregard all comparative judgments for which pij is greater than .98 or less than .02.&quot;’ &quot; Since the omission of such extreme values leaves empty cells in the Z matrix, the averaging procedure for arriving at the scale values cannot be applied, and an elaborate procedure for the estimation of unknown parameters is usually employed (Edwards, 1957, pp. 42–46). An alternative solution of this problem was suggested by Krus and Kennedy (1977).

With later developments in psychometric theory, it has become possible to employ direct methods of scaling such as application of the Rasch model or unfolding models such as the Hyperbolic Cosine Model (HCM) (Andrich &amp; Luo, 1993). The Rasch model has a close conceptual relationship to Thurstone&#x27;s law of comparative judgment (Andrich, 1978), the principal difference being that it directly incorporates a person parameter. Also, the Rasch model takes the form of a logistic function rather than a cumulative normal function.

<text>Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom (19 January 1790 in Åsbo, Östergötland – 21 July 1855) was a Swedish romantic poet, and a member of the Swedish Academy.

==Life==
He was the son of a country parson, born in the province of Ostergotland on 19 January 1790. He studied in the university of Uppsala from 1805 to 1815, and became professor of philosophy there in 1828.

He was the first great poet of the romantic movement which, inaugurated by the critical work of Lorenzo Hammarsköld, was to revolutionize Swedish literature. 
In 1807, when in his seventeenth year, he founded at Uppsala an artistic society, called the Aurora League, the members of which included V. F. Palmblad, Anders Abraham Grafström, Samuel Hedborn (died 1849), and other youths whose names were destined to take a foremost rank in the literature of their generation.

Their first newspaper, &quot;Polyfem&quot;, was a crude effort, soon abandoned. Still, in 1810 there began to appear a journal, &quot;Fosforos&quot;, edited by Atterbom, which lasted for three years and finds a place in classic Swedish literature. It consisted entirely of poetry and aesthetic-polemical essays; it introduced the study of the newly arisen Romantic school of Germany, and formed a vehicle for the early works, not of Atterbom only, but of Hammerskijld, Dahlgren, Palmblad and others. 
Later, the members of the Aurora League established the &quot;Poetisk Kalender&quot; (1812-1822), in which their poems appeared, and a new critical organ, &quot;Svensk Litteraturtidning&quot; (181 5–1824).

Among Atterbom&#x27;s independent works the most celebrated is &quot;Lycksalighetens Ö&quot; (&quot;The Fortunate Island&quot;), a romantic drama of extraordinary beauty, published in 1823. 
Before this he had published a cycle of lyrics, &quot;Blommorna&quot; (&quot;The Flowers&quot;), of a mystical character, somewhat in the manner of Novalis. 
Of a dramatized fairy tale, &quot;Fågel Blå&quot; (&quot;The Blue Bird&quot;), only a fragment, which is among the most exquisite of his writings, is preserved. 
As a purely lyrical poet he has not been excelled in Sweden, but his more ambitious works are injured by his weakness for allegory and symbolism, and his consistent adoption of the mannerisms of Tieck and Novalis.

In his later years he became less violent in literary controversy. 
He became in 1835, professor of aesthetics and literature at Uppsala, and four years later he was admitted to the Swedish Academy. 
He died on 21 July 1855. 
His &quot;Svenska Siare och Skalder&quot; (6 vols., 1841–1855, supplement, 1864) consists of a series of biographies of Swedish poets and men of letters, which forms a valuable history of Swedish letters down to the end of the “classical” period. 
Atterbom&#x27;s works were collected (13 vols., Örebro) in 1854–1870.

<doc id="770668" wikidata="Q1428424" url="?curid=770668" title="Pathfinder (military)">
<text>In military organizations, a pathfinder is a specialized soldier inserted or dropped into place in order to set up and operate drop zones, pickup zones, and helicopter landing sites for airborne operations, air resupply operations, or other air operations in support of the ground unit commander. Pathfinders first appeared in World War II, and continue to serve an important role in today&#x27;s modern armed forces, providing commanders with the option of flexibly employing air assets.
There was a group of pilots who were also designated pathfinders. They flew C-47 (DC-3) aircraft and were the lead planes followed by paratroop transports, used for dropping paratroopers into designate drop zones such as on D-Day, the Normandy Invasion.

==History==
===United Kingdom===
During the Second World War small groups of parachute soldiers were formed into pathfinder units, to parachute ahead of the main force. Their tasks were to mark the drop zones (DZ) or landing zones (LZ), set up radio beacons as a guide for the aircraft carrying the main force and to clear and protect the area as the main force arrived. The units were formed into two companies to work with the two British airborne divisions created during the war, the 1st and 6th.

The 21st Independent Parachute Company was formed in June 1942 and became part of the 1st Airborne Division, then commanded by Major General Frederick &quot;Boy&quot; Browning, considered to be the father of the British Army&#x27;s airborne forces. The 22nd Independent Parachute Company was raised in May 1943 and was part of the 6th Airborne Division, under the command of Major General Richard &quot;Windy&quot; Gale.

During the Allied invasion of Sicily (codenamed &#x27;Operation Husky&#x27;) the 21st Independent Parachute Company parachuted ahead of the main force during Operation Fustian to capture the Primosole Bridge on the night of 13/14 July 1943. They then took part in Operation Slapstick, part of the Allied invasion of Italy, landing by sea at Taranto on 9 September. The company, with most of the rest of the 1st Airborne Division, after fighting briefly in the early stages of the Italian Campaign, returned to the United Kingdom in December 1943, but left an independent platoon behind in Italy to work with the 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade Group. Held in reserve and unused for the Allied Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy, the company took part in Operation Market Garden, landing at the Dutch town of Arnhem on the night of 17 September 1944. After marking the DZs and LZs the company was trapped with the rest of the division in the Oosterbeek Perimeter, suffering heavy casualties in what is now known as the Battle of Arnhem. The company did not see any further action in the war.

Towards the end of the war the 21st Independent Parachute Company went with the 1st Airborne Division as part of Operation Doomsday to disarm the German forces in Norway between May and October 1945. It was then attached to the 6th Airborne Division serving in Mandate Palestine where it was still serving in September 1946, when it was disbanded.

The 22nd Independent Parachute Company were the lead elements of the 6th Airborne Division&#x27;s drop into Normandy as part of Operation Tonga in the early hours of D-Day, 6 June 1944. The company, together with the rest of the division, remained in Normandy, acting as standard line infantry, until the 6th Airborne Division advanced to the River Seine in August, returning to England in September but was sent to Belgium in December, due to the German Ardennes offensive, again fighting as standard infantrymen. The company then participated in Operation Varsity, the airborne component of Operation Plunder, the British assault crossing of the Rhine in late March 1945 and then the subsequent Western Allied invasion of Germany.

The 22nd Independent Parachute Company was sent with the 5th Parachute Brigade, part of the 6th Airborne Division but temporarily detached, to the Far East in mid-1945, remaining there until disbanded in July 1946.

Post war the Regular Army&#x27;s parachute force was reduced to the 16th Parachute Brigade. To provide this formation with a pathfinder capacity the Guards Independent Parachute Company was formed in 1948 on the disbandment of Composite Guards Parachute Battalion. The Company deployed on a wide variety of operations between 1948 and 1977. It was deployed to Borneo during the Borneo Confrontation where it was used provide reinforcement to the SAS and its professional performance resulted in the formation of G Sqn of that regiment in 1966.

The pathfinder role in the Territorial Army (TA), the British Army&#x27;s part-time reserve, was continued by 16 (Lincoln) Independent Parachute Company as part of 44th Parachute Brigade (V).

The 16 Air Assault Brigade employs elite pathfinders in their Pathfinder Platoon.

===United States===

During World War II, the pathfinders were a group of volunteers selected within the Airborne units who were specially trained to operate navigation aids to guide the main airborne body to the drop zones. The pathfinder teams (sticks) were made up of a group of eight to twelve pathfinders and a group of six bodyguards whose job was to defend the pathfinders while they set up their equipment. The pathfinder teams dropped approximately thirty minutes before the main body in order to locate designated drop zones and provide radio and visual guides for the main force in order to improve the accuracy of the jump. These navigational aids included compass beacons, colored panels, Eureka radar sets, and colored smoke. When they jumped, the pathfinders many times would encounter less resistance than the follow-up waves of paratroopers, simply because they had the element of surprise on their side. Once the main body jumped, the pathfinders then joined their original units and fought as standard airborne infantry.

====World War II====
====Early operations====
The first two U.S. airborne campaigns, the drops into French North Africa (Operation Torch) and on Sicily (Operation Husky) did not make use of pathfinders. The jump into North Africa, made up of men of the 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion (509th PIB), resulted in its men being scattered to places such as Algeria, Gibraltar, and Morocco when they ran into bad weather and got lost. The next major airborne operation took place in the invasion of Sicily in July 1943. Many of the same problems were encountered, as the men were scattered as far as 65 miles from their drop zones, due to high winds and poor navigation. In fact, some of the paratroopers landed so far off course that it was a matter of weeks before they finally found their way back to Allied lines.

In a history of the 509th PIB&#x27;s wartime actions titled &quot;Stand in the Door! The wartime history of the 509th Parachute Infantry,&quot; authors and 509th veterans Charles H. Doyle and Terrell Stewart described how their unit formed the first U.S. Army pathfinder unit.

 [General James] Gavin likes to claim credit for &quot;inventing&quot; Pathfinders, pointing to bad drops in Sicily as the cause. Let us set the record straight: The 509th, the world&#x27;s most experienced bad drop specialists, first saw the need for them. Pathfinders were separate teams of &quot;advance men&quot; who jumped in ahead of main forces to set up beacons and other guides to incoming aircraft.

The 509th&#x27;s Scout Company was the first specialized Pathfinder group. In the U.S. Army, it started the training and experimentation necessary to develop the concept at Oujda. With fragments of practical knowledge from the British Airborne, company commander Captain Howland and his XO 1st Lt. Fred E. Perry worked hard to develop usable techniques. Perry recalls: &quot;Everyone knew through hard experience that the Air Corps needed help to drop us on the correct drop zone. We organized the Scout Company for this purpose. This was later made into a Scout Platoon under my command, consisting of 10 enlisted and myself. We were equipped with a British homing radio and U.S. Navy Aldis lamps, which radiated a beam to guide planes. We trained on this procedure until the invasion at Salerno.

In the meantime, the 82nd Airborne Division arrived from the States on May 10 and camped near the 509th at Oujda. We were attached to them. The 82nd would not buy our Scout Platoon idea, but they sure found out in a hurry after Sicily that we really had something that was needed.

At the time, Major General Matthew Ridgway and his &quot;All-American&quot; staff thought they knew it all. Impressed with themselves, although they were not jumpers or experienced glider troopers, they airily dismissed the 509th and its fresh combat experiences, as well as any nonstandard/Limey concept. They would learn the hard way.

====Sicily and Italy====
After the serious problems uncovered during the parachute drop in the Allied invasion of Sicily, the Allied high command questioned the utility of parachute infantry primarily because of the difficulty of dropping the infantry as cohesive units rather than as scattered groups. A review of procedures and methods resulted in the establishment of the pathfinder teams to aid navigation to drop zones. The pathfinder forces were only formed about a week in advance of the jump at Paestum, Italy, on September 13, 1943. When the majority of the pathfinders landed directly on target, they were able to set up their radar sets and Krypton lights on the drop zone. A quarter of an hour later, the main body of paratroopers from the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment (504th PIR) landed right on the middle of the drop zone.

The same night, the newly formed pathfinder detachment from the 509th PIB saw their first action in that capacity at Avellino, Italy. Compared to the successful pathfinders at Paestum, those of the 509th at Avellino had markedly less success. However, this was not their fault, as the mountainous terrain surrounding the area deflected the radar signals and caused the pilots to become disoriented.

====Normandy====
Airborne and pathfinder forces did not see combat again until June 6, 1944, at the commencement of the D-Day landings of Operation Overlord. Pathfinders taking part in the Allied parachute assault on Normandy, France, on June 6, 1944, were trained by the Pathfinder School at RAF North Witham (U.S. Army Air Force (USAAF) designation &#x27;Army Air Force Station 479&#x27;) Lincolnshire.

At 21:30 on June 5, about 200 pathfinders began to take off from North Witham, for the French Cotentin Peninsula, in 20 Douglas C-47 Skytrain aircraft of the 9th Troop Carrier Command Pathfinder Group. They began to drop at 00:15 on June 6, to prepare the drop zones for the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions. They were the first American troops on the ground on D-Day. However, their aircraft were scattered by low clouds and anti-aircraft fire. Many never found their assigned landing zones. Some of the landing zones were too heavily defended. Some were flooded.

The low clouds and extremely intense anti-aircraft fire caused the pathfinder sticks to be dropped off course, with only one stick landing in the correct place (Ambrose, p. 196). Their radar beacons did work somewhat effectively; even though the pathfinders set up their equipment off course, many of the sticks of follow up paratroopers landed clustered near these beacons.

However, the lights proved ineffective, as most were not set up due to the clouds and misdrops of the pathfinders. While the bad weather and heavy anti-aircraft curtailed the effectiveness of the pathfinder teams on D-Day, the overall airborne drop was a success. This was true because the misplacement and scattering of the airborne forces deceived the German High Command and, as happened in Sicily, convincing them that there were far more American paratroopers present than there actually were in France.

====Southern France====
The invasion of the South of France took place on August 15, 1944, in the form of Operation Dragoon (Rottman, p. 80). The 509th PIB, the 517th Parachute Regimental Combat Team, and the 551st PIB formed the American airborne contingent of the invasion, dropping into the French Riviera in the early hours of the morning. As had been the problem with previous night drops, such as Normandy, the pathfinders were misdropped when the planes carrying them got lost. Further delays were encountered when these men had to find each other on the ground, work their way through a heavily wooded area near the town of Le Muy, and fight off German soldiers in the process.

Due to the ineffective placement of the pathfinders, the follow-up waves of paratroopers were not dropped in the right place either. This was further exacerbated by pilot error, as many of the pilots opted to drop their paratroopers at too high an altitude; the result was that these men were widely scattered. An entire stick of men of the 509th PIB were dropped into the sea and drowned near Saint-Tropez. Much like the paratroopers in Normandy, however, the overall operation was a success as the paratroopers still managed to accomplish their missions and capture their objectives in conjunction with the seaborne landing forces.

====Netherlands====
Operation Market Garden, the brainchild of British Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, commander of the 21st Army Group, which took place on September 17, 1944, was the next major airborne operation into the Netherlands, the largest to date. The mission of the airborne troops was to capture a series of bridges from Best in the south, to Arnhem (by the British 1st Airborne Division) in the north. This would then allow the ground element to cross the bridges in a rapid manoeuvre. While the operation ultimately failed due to delays among the ground forces, the airborne divisions accomplished most of their missions; this was due in large part to the efforts of the pathfinder forces. A combination of the drop taking place in broad daylight and that the Germans were not expecting an airborne attack allowed the pathfinders to land on target and guide in the rest of the paratroopers to the proper locations. This is especially remarkable considering that the number of pathfinder sticks and the number of men in each stick were reduced to the bare minimum (one per drop zone) for this drop.

====Battle of the Bulge====
During the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, the 101st Airborne Division, along with elements of numerous other units, was trucked to the Belgian town of Bastogne in order to secure and defend the town which contained a major road junction. By December 22, 1944, the units defending the town were surrounded and running low on supplies. Two sticks of pathfinders of the 101st parachuted into besieged Bastogne to set up signal beacons to guide in a flight of planes to resupply the Allied units in that town; the resupply succeeded, thanks to the efforts of the pathfinders. There were pathfinder trained personnel already in Bastogne, but they were unable to perform their pathfinder duties without the equipment that was parachuted in with the pathfinders.

====Into Germany====
A similar mission was carried out by the pathfinders of the 506th PIR at Prüm, Germany, on February 13, 1945. Their objective was to set beacons to guide in planes to resupply the surrounded 4th Infantry Division, and they succeeded; this allowed the division to fight off the Germans surrounding them.

The only major airborne operation into Germany came on March 24, 1945, in the form of Operation Varsity, the crossing of the Rhine River by American, British and Canadian paratroopers. Because it was another daylight drop (navigation should not be a problem) and that the drop zones were heavily defended, pathfinders were not dropped prior to the main paratrooper forces in this operation. Instead, some set up beacons on the Allied side of the river, and others dropped with the main paratrooper force to set up smoke and panels as a final navigational aid.

====The Pacific Theater====
There was a much lesser demand for pathfinders and airborne forces in general in the jungles and islands of the Pacific. The 511th PIR was the only Pacific based airborne unit to employ pathfinders, which it did in the Philippines. They were used twice, at Tagaytay Ridge in early February 1945, and again on June 23, 1945. However, neither time did they parachute in to mark the drop zones; rather, they infiltrated over a beach in one instance, and across a river in the other.

====Post–World War II====
The divisional pathfinder units of World War II were assigned to the subordinate parachute infantry regiments. In 1947, the first divisional pathfinder platoon was organized in the Headquarters Company, 82nd Airborne Division. Pathfinders were also established in the 11th Airborne Division, at that time on occupation duty in Japan.

====Korean War====
The organizational structure of the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team included a Pathfinder Team; however, when the 187th conducted a parachute assault in October 1950 near the villages of Sukchon and Sunchon in North Korea, the commander, Brig. Gen. Frank S. Bowen, decided against using pathfinders on the jump. According to USAF Historical Study No. 71, &quot;Bowen thought that the use of pathfinder teams to signal for resupply drops would have been valuable, but such teams, had they been employed to mark the initial jump areas, would have been killed before they got into action.&quot;

====Vietnam War====

In Vietnam &quot;Pathfinder Infantrymen&quot; were inserted into areas to establish landing zones for air assaults or other helicopter operations. Pathfinders determined the most practical landing zones, withdrawal routes, approach lanes, and landing sites for helicopter assaults, in hostile areas. They themselves would then often be extracted with helicopter McGuire rigs.

The US Army&#x27;s 11th Aviation Group landed in the country in August 1965, and while assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) expanded its Pathfinder unit to company size, creating the provisional 11th Pathfinder Company.

While the 11th Pathfinder Company was assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division&#x27;s reconnaissance section, units such as the 1st Infantry Division, 101st Airborne (Airmobile), 82nd Airborne (3rd Brigade), etc., operated Ranger or Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol (LRRP) companies within their reconnaissance elements.

The 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile), which had deployed to Southeast Asia in September 1965, departed South Vietnam in April 1971. The 11th Aviation Group re-deployed from Southeast Asia in March 1973.

The activities of the Pathfinder Platoon, HHC, 160th Aviation Group, 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam are covered in the book &quot;Pathfinder: First In, Last Out&quot; by the late Richard R. Burns, a veteran of the unit. To date it is the only book covering pathfinders in Vietnam.

====Post–Vietnam Era====
In the post–Vietnam era the Army established pathfinder units in US-based aviation units, to include the 222d Aviation Battalion in Alaska and the 6th Cavalry Brigade (Air Combat) at Fort Hood, TX.

The Army also activated pathfinder units in both the Army Reserve and the National Guard. The first USAR unit was the 26th Infantry Platoon in Wichita, KS, which was formed with the lineage of a former Regular Army scout dog unit that had served in World War II and Korea. This was followed by the 27th Infantry Platoon in Grand Prairie, TX, which had no prior history, and the 5th Infantry Platoon, which carried the lineage of a former Regular Army pathfinder unit that had been assigned to Fort Rucker, AL, from 1963 to 1975, when it was expanded and reflagged as Company C (Pathfinder), 509th Infantry. In time the 54th Infantry Platoon was activated in Wenatchee, WA, and the 79th Infantry Platoon at Fort Douglas, UT. All were 22-man units with one officer, one NCOIC, an RTO for each, and three six-man teams. These were the USAR platoons, their locations and the commands to which they were assigned:

* 5th Infantry Platoon (Pathfinder), Fort Meade, MD (97th ARCOM; administratively attached to HQ 11th SFGA and later assigned to HQ 31st Aviation Group)
* 26th Infantry Platoon (Pathfinder), Wichita, KS (89th ARCOM)
* 27th Infantry Platoon (Pathfinder), NAS Dallas, Grand Prairie, TX (90th ARCOM)
* 54th Infantry Platoon (Pathfinder), Wenatchee, WA 124th ARCOM)
* 79th Infantry Platoon (Pathfinder), Fort Douglas, UT (96th ARCOM)

The Army National Guard activated five pathfinder detachments. Its 1136th Infantry Detachment was formed using the assets of the Pathfinder Detachment, HQ 36th Airborne Brigade when the brigade was inactivated in April 1980.

*28th Infantry Detachment (Pathfinder), Fort Indiantown Gap, Annville, PA (28th Inf Div, PA ARNG)
*76th Infantry Detachment (Pathfinder), Stockton, CA (40th Inf Div, CA ARNG)
*77th Infantry Detachment (Pathfinder), Columbus, OH (73rd Inf Bde, OH ARNG)
*667th Infantry Detachment (Pathfinder), Saint Thomas, VI (VI ARNG)
*1136th Infantry Detachment (Pathfinder), Austin, TX (TX ARNG)

==Modern pathfinders==
Pathfinders exist in a number of armed forces around the world. Most of them are senior members of parachute units and have earned the right to wear the maroon beret.

===Belgium===
Belgium has a platoon of pathfinders that is special operations capable as part of the Special Operations Regiment. They are paracommandos that receive an extra pathfinder course at Schaffen. The Belgian pathfinders keep close ties with their Dutch and British counterparts, with whom they perform joint exercises.

=== France ===
Commando Parachute Group (GCP Groupement de Commando Parachutistes): Each regiment within the 11th Parachute Brigade (11e Brigade Parachutiste) trains one or two GCP teams from their own ranks.
There are nineteen teams with about a dozen members each in the GCP, which is structured as follows:
* 1st Parachute Chasseur Regiment (1er Régiment de chasseurs parachutistes) (three teams of ten commandos)
* 1st Parachute Hussar Regiment (1er Régiment de hussards parachutistes) (two teams)
* 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment (2e Régiment étranger de parachutistes) (three teams)
* 3rd Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment (3e Régiment de parachutistes d&#x27;infanterie de marine) (two teams)
* 8th Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment (8e Régiment de parachutistes d&#x27;infanterie de marine) (two teams)
* 17th Parachute Engineer Regiment (17e Régiment de génie parachutiste) (two teams)
* 35th Artillery Parachute Regiment (35e Régiment d&#x27;artillerie parachutiste) (two teams)
* 11th Parachute Command and Transmission Company (11ème Compagnie de Commandement et de Transmissions Parachutiste (11e CCTP))
Not to mention the GCP (one team) of the 2nd Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment (2e Régiment de parachutistes d&#x27;infanterie de marine) stationed on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean.
===Netherlands===
The Netherlands have a pathfinders platoon which was founded in 2007. Since the Netherlands did not have a pathfinders unit before that, they were founded on the Belgian model where they receive their pathfinder courses in Schaffen. The Dutch pathfinders platoon maintains close cooperation with their Belgian counterparts, with joint training facilities and exercises.

===Portugal===
The Air-Land Pathfinders Company (&quot;Companhia de Precursores Aeroterrestres&quot;) is a special reconnaissance support unit of the Parachute Troops of the Portuguese Army. 

===South Africa===

The 44 Pathfinder Platoon is part of 44 Pathfinder Company of the South African Army, within 44 Parachute Brigade and 1 Parachute Battalion respectively.

===United Kingdom===
The Pathfinder Platoon is a special reconnaissance and special operations unit of the British Army, and an integral part of 16 Air Assault Brigade. The Pathfinder Platoon acts as the brigade&#x27;s advance force and reconnaissance force. Its role includes locating and marking drop zones and helicopter landing zones for air landing operations. Once the main force has landed, the platoon provides tactical intelligence for the brigade.

Following the 1982 Falklands War, 5 Airborne Brigade was established as a light, rapid reaction force for similar requirements. The brigade was formed from the Parachute Regiment, and support units. The brigade identified a requirement for an independent intelligence collection capability, deployable into a hostile or non-permissive environment ahead of the main force so in 1985 the Pathfinder Platoon was established.

Pathfinder Platoon operations have included:

* Operation Agricola: In June 1999, the Pathfinder Platoon was deployed to Kosovo. It operated behind enemy lines providing reconnaissance and forward air control. Once NATO forces entered Kosovo, the Platoon provided a defensive screen around Pristina International Airport prior to the arrival of the Russian forces.
* Operation Palliser: In May 2000 the Pathfinder Platoon deployed to Sierra Leone, to assist the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone efforts.
* Operation Essential Harvest: With the rise in ethnic tension overspilling in to violence in Republic of Macedonia between ethnic Albanian, National Liberation Army (NLA) and Macedonian security forces, the British Government sent a force to oversee a NATO-led ceasefire. The Pathfinders, alongside the UKSF, oversaw the uneasy truce and were used to establish links between the warring factions and monitor any hostile activities.
* Operation Veritas: The platoon deployed into Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan, in December 2001 to assist NATO&#x27;s International Security Assistance Force.
* Operation Telic: In Iraq, the primary mission for the teams was to conduct mobile surveillance/fighting patrols behind enemy lines in support of UK and US forces. After the hostilities, the unit were redeployed on the Iran/Iraq border as well as carrying out &quot;snatch squad&quot; tasks on suspected Ba&#x27;athist war criminals in Maysan.
* Operation Herrick: The Platoon was deployed to the southern Afghan province of Helmand alongside the British 3 Para Battle Group in 2006. They deployed again to Helmand, Afghanistan, in 2010/2011.

The platoon work under the command of the Brigade Headquarters. The Officer Commanding Pathfinder Platoon is a senior captain or major. The platoon operates in teams of 6 men. In 2006 a new rate of Parachute Pay (High Altitude Parachute Pay) was introduced for members of the Pathfinder Platoon following the recommendations of the Armed Forces’ Pay Review Body.

===United States===

The U.S. Army operates three Pathfinder schools. The first is the United States Army Pathfinder School, at Fort Moore (previously known as Fort Benning), Georgia, which serves as the Army proponent agency for Pathfinder operations and oversees the standardization of Army Pathfinder doctrine. The second is the Sabalauski Air Assault School of Fort Campbell, KY. The third is part of Fort Moore&#x27;s Army National Guard Warrior Training Center, which also conducts Pre-Ranger and Air Assault classes. The courses taught at the WTC and Fort Campbell do not include parachute jumps.

As the airmobile concept was being developed before the Vietnam War, starting about 1960 there was a pathfinder presence at Fort Rucker, Alabama, initially designated as the Pathfinder Team, Company A, 2d Battle Group, 31st Infantry, later re-flagged as the 5th Battle Group, 31st Infantry on 1 July 1963. The purpose of the battle group, which was organized differently than standard battle groups, was to provide training support to the Aviation Center. Subsequent reorganizations and re-flaggings led to the 5th Infantry Detachment (Pathfinder) and 5th Infantry Platoon (Pathfinder). On 1 July 1975 the unit was reorganized and re-flagged as Company C (Pathfinder), 509th Infantry, and it retained this designation until 1 June 1993 when it was re-flagged as Company A (Pathfinder), 511th Infantry. This designation only lasted until 31 October 1995 when the Pathfinder presence at Fort Rucker came to an end due to budget cuts that also ended the post&#x27;s Air Assault School. Combined with the inactivation of all five USAR pathfinder platoons and all five ARNG Pathfinder detachments at the end of fiscal year 1990, the inactivation of A-511th at Fort Rucker resulted in only two Pathfinder units remaining in the Army: a detachment in the 17th Aviation Brigade in Korea and a company in the 101st Aviation Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.

In June 2005 the 17th Aviation Brigade in Korea was inactivated, along with its pathfinder detachment. At the time it was the only pathfinder unit outside of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault).

When the U.S. Army reorganized its combat divisions under the modular concept, long range surveillance detachments (LRSD) were eliminated at division level. Concurrently in the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), the 101st Aviation Brigade (Attack) and the 159th Aviation Brigade (Assault) were reorganized to be identical combat aviation brigades, and the division&#x27;s former LRSD was transferred from the 311th Military Intelligence Battalion to the 159th CAB to become a second pathfinder company within the division. At this point the two pathfinder companies were (1) Company F (Pathfinder), 4th Battalion, 101st Aviation Regiment, 159th Combat Aviation Brigade and (2) Company F (Pathfinder), 5th Battalion, 101st Aviation Regiment, 101st Combat Aviation Brigade.

In 2006 the LRSD, 313th Military Intelligence Battalion in the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg was likewise transferred to the 2d Battalion, 82d Aviation Regiment, and reorganized and reflagged as Company F (Pathfinder).

Also formed up were two provisional pathfinder units not documented on the parent units’ MTOE. These were Company F, 2d Battalion, 10th Aviation Regiment, part of the Combat Aviation Brigade, 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) at Fort Drum, NY, and a pathfinder company operating as part of the 2d Battalion, 25th Aviation Regiment, Combat Aviation Brigade, 25th Infantry Division, Schofield Barracks, HI. These pathfinder units filled roles across the spectrum of their doctrinal missions, along with other roles outside of their prescribed task lists.

An Army News Service article dated 10 September 2014 noted the activation of a new company within the 1st Battalion, 509th Infantry Regiment at Fort Polk, Louisiana. This unit, Company C, was described as &quot;a rifle company with pathfinder capabilities.&quot;

Jump status for the two pathfinder companies in the 101st was terminated on 16 October 2013, resulting in the elimination of the last parachute billets in the division. This was followed on 15 May 2015 by the inactivation of the 159th CAB, which included the brigade&#x27;s pathfinder company. Concurrently the 101st CAB was redesignated as the CAB, 101st Airborne Division, bringing it in line with other non-numbered divisional CABs. At this point the division assumed the same organizational structure as the 10th Mountain Division, a light infantry unit.

On 2 August 2016 the remaining pathfinder company in the 101st Airborne Division was inactivated in a ceremony at Fort Campbell, KY. Media accounts erred in stating that “seventy-two years of service came to an end” with the inactivation of the company. The World War II pathfinder units were assigned at the infantry regiment level, not division level, and the division itself was inactivated in late 1945. Reactivated three times in the post-war years as a non-combat training division without pathfinders, the division was reformed again as a combat unit in 1956. Documentation on when pathfinders returned to the division is sparse, but most likely took place in the 1960s with the advent of helicopter warfare and the shift of the pathfinder mission from control of fixed-wing aircraft, which had gone to USAF combat control teams, to Army rotary wing aircraft. When the 101st Airborne Division stood down in Vietnam in early 1972, soldiers with time remaining on their tours, to include pathfinders, were reassigned to other units, such as the 3d Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division (Separate), and the division flag returned to Fort Campbell.

In the summer of 2016 the provisional pathfinder company in the 25th Infantry Division was inactivated, followed by the inactivation of the company in the 101st Airborne Division (above), and the provisional company in the 10th Mountain Division by October 2016. The last pathfinder unit in the Army, a company authorized by MTOE in the 82d Airborne Division, was inactivated in a ceremony at 1400 on 24 February 2017 at Simmons Army Airfield on Fort Bragg.

In July 2020 the Army announced that it was considering terminating its Pathfinder course at Fort Moore, Georgia, by the end of the Fiscal Year 2021, and it later decided to do so. By the end of 2021 the website for the Airborne &amp; Ranger Training Brigade no longer listed the Pathfinder course among its offerings. The website for the ARNG Warrior Training Center, also based at Fort Moore, showed no class dates past the end of FY 2021. The Sabalauski Air Assault School at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, under the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), continues to operate its own Pathfinder course.

Pathfinders in the U.S. Army wear the Pathfinder Badge.

<text>Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1947 followed yet another round of reform. The Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA) continued to vote by mail but the Hall of Fame Committee had revised the procedures for that election and reduced its historical jurisdiction relative to the Old-Timers Committee. The BBWAA now considered major league players retired no more than 25 years. The reform seemed to work, as it elected four: Mickey Cochrane, Frank Frisch, Lefty Grove, and Carl Hubbell.

In the wake of the successful BBWAA election, and perhaps in deference to those critics who believed that the 21 selections by the Old-Timers Committee in the previous two years had been too many in such a short time, the Hall of Fame Committee did not meet in 1947 to make further selections from among the players of the era before 1922, or to add names to the Roll of Honor. It was believed, with some optimism, that further revisions in the election process were currently unnecessary.

The new members of the Hall were formally inducted in Cooperstown, New York, on July 21, 1947, along with the previous year&#x27;s 11 selections by the Old-Timers Committee, with National League president Ford Frick presiding. Ed Walsh, elected in 1946, was the only inductee to attend the ceremony; all four 1947 inductees were still living, as were four of the 1946 selectees.

== Reform ==

After the January 1946 BBWAA election failed to elect any inductees, capping a seven-year period in which only one player had been elected, the Hall of Fame Committee concluded that the wide field of candidates from 1900 to the present was making it impossible for any single candidate to gain votes on 75% of all ballots. In response, the Committee selected at its April 1946 meeting eleven inductees, including most of the popular candidates from the era between 1900 and 1918; there was even some support on the committee for removing the BBWAA from the selection process entirely. There was a great deal of criticism regarding the committee&#x27;s decision in this regard, as they had been understood to only have the capacity to select players from the 19th century; many observers believed the committee was infringing upon the BBWAA&#x27;s jurisdiction over players of the 20th century.

The committee met again in December 1946, and formally revealed its previously unannounced decision that the jurisdictions of the BBWAA would no longer be defined by the fixed year 1900 receding into the past but by a fixed length of time from the present day, initially set at 25 years. Players who retired more than 25 years ago would be considered only by the Old-Timers Committee.

== BBWAA election ==

=== Eligibility revisions ===
The committee also revised the two-stage method by which the BBWAA election had been conducted in 1946. That year&#x27;s election, which saw every candidate do &quot;less&quot; well on the final ballot than on the nominating ballot, led to the initial vote again becoming the main election. Whereas the 1946 system &quot;required&quot; a second ballot before electing a candidate, now a second runoff election featuring the top 20 candidates, with the potential to select no more than one player, would be held &quot;only&quot; if no candidate received votes from 75% of the writers in the first election. There was also no longer any minimum number of ballots required to make the election valid.

The Hall of Fame Committee also instituted a change in the rules regarding eligibility of voters. Previously, all members of the BBWAA were permitted to cast ballots; however, it would now be necessary that a writer have been a BBWAA member for ten years before becoming eligible to vote. This resulted in fewer than half the BBWAA members casting ballots, and a 39% reduction in the number of ballots from the previous year.

Members of the BBWAA now had the authority to select any players active in 1922 or later, provided they had not appeared in a major league game in 1946. Just as in the elections prior to 1946, voters were instructed to cast votes for 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. If no candidate received votes on 75% of the ballots, the top 20 candidates would advance to the runoff election, with the vote totals from the first ballot not being revealed until the runoff was over.

In addition to many candidates becoming ineligible due to length of retirement, some players who had served in World War II and who had received votes in the 1945 and 1946 elections had now become ineligible once again as a result of appearing in major league games in 1946. Also, the previous year&#x27;s creation of the Roll of Honor had reduced the incentive to vote for managers, as there was a question of whether they were to be considered for this separate honor. The reduction of the field of eligible candidates was considerable; the players elected by the Old-Timers Committee in 1946 had received 37% of the vote in the last BBWAA election, and had included 4 of the top 5 candidates. Players now ineligible due to retirement prior to the cutoff point accounted for an additional 14% of the 1946 vote, and players returning from WWII had received another 2%. Because less than half of the previous year&#x27;s votes had been cast for those still eligible, hopes had increased that new inductees might at last be elected.

=== Election results ===
A total of 161 ballots were cast, with 1,559 individual votes for 39 specific candidates, an average of 9.68 per ballot; 121 votes were required for election. The results were announced in January 1947. For the first time in three elections and five years, the election was successful, electing four new inductees to the Hall; it was the largest group of inductees since the initial selections in 1936, and no runoff was necessary. The new system was hailed as a great success, and would be used with relatively minor revisions in the ensuing years.

The number of players receiving votes (39) was the lowest for any election yet, and barely half of the previous year&#x27;s total (76). Very few players received votes who had not appeared in past voting, suggesting that with the new rules in effect, many voters focused on the previous year&#x27;s results; with only weeks to complete their ballots, there was perhaps a limited effort to look for new candidates who had retired in the years between 1922 and 1945. With precise historical records scarce, and little time to seek them, there may also have been some uncertainty regarding particular candidates as to whether they had retired before or after 1922. Chief Bender, who received 72 votes, had played his last regular season in 1917; he was technically still eligible due to a single inning pitched in 1925, though it is unknown whether voters were aware of this. Bender had been - along with Mordecai Brown, an earlier figure who was more clearly now ineligible - one of only two pre-1920 candidates who received over 10% of the 1946 vote without being selected later by the Old-Timers Committee. Besides Bender, 4 other votes in the 1947 election also went to candidates retired slightly before 1922. With a reduced number of eligible voters, fewer candidates were named on only 1 or 2 ballots.

The trend of the past several years toward earlier players was now completely reversed; whereas players retired for well over 20 years had been receiving 60-70% of the vote, the 1947 election saw players retired for less than 13 years receive 73% of the vote. The top 9 candidates were all active in 1934 or later, and those who played their last season in the 1920s received only 16% of the vote.

The four candidates who received at least 75% of the vote and were elected are indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in &quot;italics&quot;:

<text>Titus Pomponius Atticus (November 110 BC – 31 March 32 BC; later named Quintus Caecilius Pomponianus Atticus) was a Roman editor, banker, and patron of letters, best known for his correspondence and close friendship with prominent Roman statesman Marcus Tullius Cicero. Atticus was from a wealthy Roman family of the equestrian class (lower aristocratic non-ruling class) and from the Pomponia gens.

A close friend since childhood, Cicero dedicated his treatise, , to Atticus. Their correspondence, often written in subtle code to disguise their political observations, is preserved in (&quot;Letters to Atticus&quot;) compiled by Tiro, Cicero&#x27;s slave (later his freedman) and personal secretary.

Born Titus Pomponius in Rome , Atticus&#x27; parents were Titus Pomponius, a wealthy businessman, and Caecilia. His family were equestrians and likely had been members of the prestigious equestrians with public horse () for many generations. He had a sister named Pomponia. 

Atticus&#x27; father supported his education. Among his school friends were three consuls: Cicero (consul in 63 BC), Lucius Manlius Torquatus (consul in 65), and Gaius Marius the Younger (consul in 82). Cicero was educated by tutors chosen by the famous orator Lucius Licinius Crassus; Atticus may have been part of this grouping as well. He is said to have been an excellent student; his education, evidenced by his school friends&#x27; political careers, would have prepared him well for Roman public life.

Atticus left Rome, probably to escape civil strife, in 86 BC. According to his biographer Nepos, Atticus was a distant relation of the plebeian tribune Publius Sulpicius Rufus – it is more likely that they were friends – which put him in danger when Sulla took the city. Atticus went to Athens, transferring most of his wealth, and staying away from Rome until around 65 BC. The city was not doing well in the aftermath of its capture by Sulla during the First Mithridatic War. His love of Athens inspired his self-appointed nickname &quot;Atticus&quot;, or &quot;Man of Attica&quot;, which is mentioned in the fifth book of Cicero&#x27;s . During his visit to Athens, Julius Caesar was Atticus&#x27;s guest.

===Career===
Atticus inherited family money, which he successfully invested in real estate, enhancing his wealth. Using his income to support his love of letters, he had trained Roman slaves as scribes and taught them to make papyrus scrolls, allowing Atticus to publish, amongst other things, the works of his friend Cicero. His editions of Greek authors such as Plato, Demosthenes, and Aeschines were prized for their accuracy in the ancient world. None of Atticus&#x27;s own writings have survived, but he is known to have written one book (in Ancient Greek) on Cicero&#x27;s consulship, the &quot;Liber Annalis&quot; (a work on Roman chronology), and a small amount of Roman poetry.

In 65 BC, Atticus returned from Athens to Rome. In keeping with his Epicurean sympathies, he kept out of politics to the greatest extent possible, except to lend Cicero a helping hand in times of peril — for instance, when Cicero was forced to flee the country in 49 BC, Atticus made him a present of 250,000 sesterces. All in all, his political activity was minimal, though we know that, like Cicero, he belonged to the &quot;optimates&quot; (the aristocratic party), and held generally conservative views. He was also a friend and partner of Marcus Licinius Crassus, a member of the First Triumvirate.

Upon the death of his wealthiest maternal uncle Quintus Caecilius, Atticus became his adopted son and heir, assuming the name Quintus Caecilius Pomponianus Atticus. Lucius Licinius Lucullus, despite being his personal friend, resented Atticus&#x27;s receiving an inheritance he felt he was entitled to for his association with the campaign against Mithridates and as Governor of Syria.

Atticus was friendly with the Liberators after the assassination of Julius Caesar but was not harmed following their defeat. According to Cornelius Nepos, he took care of Servilia after the death of her son Brutus at the Battle of Philippi.

=== Marriage and children ===

In his later years, he married a relative, Pilia ( – 46 BC), daughter of Pilius and a maternal granddaughter of the Triumvir Crassus. Atticus and Pilia were married in 58/56 BC, when Atticus was already 53/54 years old, and she died after 12 years of happy marriage. They had a daughter, Attica, who became the first wife of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa.

=== Death ===

Atticus lived out the remainder of his life in Rome. Just after his 77th birthday he fell ill, and at first his ailment appeared minor. But after three months his health suddenly deteriorated. Deciding to accelerate the inevitable, he abstained from ingesting any nourishment, starving himself to death, and dying on the fifth day of such fasting, &quot;which was the 31st March, in the consulship of Cn. Domitius and C. Sosius&quot;, that is in the year 32 BC. He was buried in a family tomb located at the Fifth Mile of the Appian Way.

<text>The Calvin L. Rampton Salt Palace Convention Center, more commonly known as the Salt Palace, is a convention center in Salt Lake City, Utah. Named after Utah&#x27;s 11th governor, Calvin L. Rampton, the moniker &quot;Salt Palace&quot; was previously used by two other venues in the city.

The convention center was opened in February 1996, after two years of construction. The building was used as the Main Media Center during the 2002 Winter Olympics and is used for regular conventions held in the city, such as FanX, RootsTech, and the Outdoor Retailers convention.

== Previous Salt Palaces ==
=== First Salt Palace (1899–1910) ===

The original Salt Palace was built in 1899 under the direction of Richard K.A. Kletting, architect, and owned by John Franklin Heath. It stood on 900 South, between State Street and Main Street in Salt Lake City. The Salt Palace was a frame structure covered by large pieces of rock salt, which gave it its name. The Palace had a large dome and was lit at night with hundreds of light bulbs. The building held a theater and was the centerpiece of an amusement park that included a dance hall, a bandstand, a bicycle racing track, rides, and other amusements. The Salt Palace and some of the other elements of the park were destroyed by fire on August 29, 1910.

=== Second Salt Palace (arena) (1969–1994) ===

The second Salt Palace in Salt Lake City was in use from 1969 to 1994, hosting among other events the home games of the Utah Stars and Utah Jazz basketball teams, and the Salt Lake Golden Eagles ice hockey team. Janet Jackson&#x27;s Rhythm Nation Tour became the fastest sell-out in Salt Palace history. Tickets for the June 18 concert were sold out in a record 1 hour and 20 minutes after the box office opened. A 1991 concert by rock band AC/DC resulted in three deaths and many injuries when the audience rushed towards the stage and trampled or trapped people. This version of the Salt Palace was demolished in 1994.

== Calvin L. Rampton Salt Palace Convention Center (1996–present) ==
Ground was broken for the current Salt Palace on April 27, 1994. Built on the site of the demolished arena, the current convention center boasts of exhibit space, of meeting space including a grand ballroom, and 66 meeting rooms. The Salt Palace served as the Olympic Media Center during the 2002 Winter Olympics.

In honor of the &quot;founding father&quot; of Salt Lake&#x27;s convention and tourism business, as well as Utah&#x27;s proactive economic development efforts, the Salt Lake County Council voted to officially change the name of the Salt Palace Convention Center to the Calvin L. Rampton Salt Palace Convention Center in the fall of 2007.

FanX, the biannual comic book convention, has been held at the Salt Palace Convention Center since September 2013. An annual family history and technology conference known as RootsTech is also held in the Salt Palace.

A Republican presidential debate hosted by Fox News was scheduled to take place at the Salt Palace Convention Center on March 21, 2016. The event was cancelled after Donald Trump said he would not participate and fellow candidate John Kasich said he would not debate without Trump.

A small public park formerly occupied the southeast corner of the building&#x27;s lot, but was closed in 2020 to build an attached hotel. The 700-room hotel, known as the Hyatt Regency Salt Lake City, opened in October 2022.

=== Solar panels ===
On May 24, 2012, a 1.65 MW solar array was completed on the roof. Covering an area of , at the time it was the largest solar array in Utah. It is expected to provide 17% of the electricity used by the Salt Palace.

<text>George Andrew Atzerodt (June 12, 1835 – July 7, 1865) was a German American repairman, Confederate sympathizer, and conspirator in the assassination of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. He was assigned to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson, but lost his nerve and made no attempt. Atzerodt was tried by a military tribunal, sentenced to death for conspiracy, and hanged along with three other conspirators.

==Early life==
Atzerodt was born in (now part of Unstruttal), in the Prussian Province of Saxony. He immigrated to the United States in 1843 at the age of eight. As an adult, he opened his own carriage repair business in Port Tobacco, Maryland. Despite having lived in the United States for most of his life, Atzerodt could not speak English fluently.

==Conspiracy==

In January 1865, some years after opening his failed carriage repair business, Atzerodt was introduced to John Wilkes Booth in Washington, D.C., by John Surratt. Atzerodt was willing to join in Booth&#x27;s earlier conspiracy to kidnap President Abraham Lincoln, as he later admitted in his trial.

According to the prosecution, Booth assigned Atzerodt to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson on April 14, 1865. On that morning, Atzerodt booked room 126 at the Kirkwood House in Washington, where Johnson was staying. At 10:15 P.M. that night, the same moment John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln at Ford&#x27;s Theater, Lewis Powell attacked the already injured Secretary of State William Seward, but Atzerodt could not muster the courage to kill Andrew Johnson. Instead, he began drinking at the hotel bar, becoming heavily intoxicated, and lost his nerve. He spent the rest of the night drunkenly walking the streets of Washington. He dropped his knife in a nearby gutter; a sharp-eyed woman saw this and reported it to the police immediately.

During his stay at the hotel, Atzerodt had asked the bartender about Johnson&#x27;s whereabouts. That aroused suspicion the next day, after Lincoln was assassinated. An employee of the hotel contacted the police regarding a &quot;suspicious looking man in a gray coat&quot;.

The military police then conducted a search of Atzerodt&#x27;s room on April 15 and found that he had not slept in it the night before. Additionally, he had a loaded revolver concealed under his pillow as well as a concealed Bowie knife. The police also found a bank book belonging to Booth in the room. Atzerodt was arrested on April 20, at the house of his cousin, Hartman Richter, in Germantown, Maryland.

==Trial and execution==
Atzerodt&#x27;s trial began on May 1, 1865. Atzerodt&#x27;s attorney, Captain William Doster, stated to the court that he intended &quot;to show that George Atzerodt was a constitutional coward; that if he had been assigned the duty of assassinating the Vice President, he could never have done it; and that, from his known cowardice, Booth probably did not assign to him any such duty.&quot; However, that was to no avail.

After the conviction, Atzerodt offered a confession to Reverend Butler, a minister who came to his cell to offer him comfort. Butler said that Atzerodt admitted going to the meeting in March to help plan the kidnapping of Lincoln while he attended a play at a hospital.

Atzerodt said he first heard about Booth&#x27;s plan to assassinate the President just two hours before the shooting. Atzerodt said that Booth really wanted David Herold to assassinate Vice President Johnson because he thought that Herold had &quot;more pluck&quot; than Atzerodt did. Atzerodt said Booth wanted him to &quot;back up&quot; Herold and &quot;give him more courage&quot;.

Atzerodt and three other convicted conspirators (Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, and David Herold) were hanged in Washington, D.C., on July 7, 1865. Atzerodt&#x27;s last words were &quot;May we all meet in the other world. God take me now.&quot; Atzerodt is interred in Glenwood Cemetery, located at 2219 Lincoln Road NE in Washington, D.C.

==Depiction in media==
Atzerodt appears in the season 1 episode &quot;The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln&quot; of &quot;Timeless&quot;, portrayed by Travis MacDonald. In the episode, he makes an attempt to assassinate Johnson but is stopped by Rufus and other soldiers and arrested by the authorities.

<text>Twenty20 (abbreviated T20) is a shortened format of cricket. At the professional level, it was introduced by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in 2003 for the inter-county competition. In a Twenty20 game, the two teams have a single innings each, which is restricted to a maximum of twenty overs. Together with first-class and List A cricket, Twenty20 is one of the three forms of cricket recognised by the International Cricket Council (ICC) as being played at the highest level, both internationally and domestically.

A typical Twenty20 game is completed in about three and a half hours, with each innings lasting around 90 minutes and an official 10-minute break between the innings. This is much shorter than previous forms of the game, and is closer to the timespan of other popular team sports. It was introduced to create a fast-paced game that would be attractive to spectators at the ground and viewers on television.

The game has succeeded in spreading around the cricket world. On most international tours there is at least one Twenty20 match and all Test-playing nations have a domestic cup competition.

==History==
===Origins===

When the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup ended in 2002, the ECB sought another one-day competition to fill with the younger generation in response to dwindling crowds and reduced sponsorship. The Board wanted to deliver fast-paced, exciting cricket accessible to fans who were put off by the longer versions of the game. Stuart Robertson, the marketing manager of the ECB, proposed a 20-over-per-innings game, invented by New Zealand cricketer Martin Crowe, to county chairmen in 2001, and they voted 11–7 in favour of adopting the new format.

The first official Twenty20 matches were played on 13 June 2003 between the English counties in the Twenty20 Cup. The first season of Twenty20 in England was a relative success, with the Surrey Lions defeating the Warwickshire Bears by nine wickets in the final to claim the title. The first Twenty20 match held at Lord&#x27;s, on 15 July 2004 between Middlesex and Surrey, attracted a crowd of 27,509, the highest attendance for any county cricket game at the ground – other than a one-day final – since 1953.

===Worldwide spread===
Thirteen teams from different parts of the country participated in Pakistan&#x27;s inaugural competition in 2004, with the Faisalabad Wolves the first winners. On 12 January 2005 Australia&#x27;s first Twenty20 game was played at the WACA Ground between the Western Warriors and the Victorian Bushrangers. It drew a sell-out crowd of 20,000, which was the first one in nearly 25 years.

Starting on 11 July 2006, 19 West Indies regional teams competed in what was named the Stanford 20/20 tournament. The event was financially backed by billionaire Allen Stanford, who gave at least US$28 million in funding money. It was intended that the tournament would be an annual event. Guyana won the inaugural event, defeating Trinidad and Tobago by five wickets, securing US$1 million in prize money.

On 5 January 2007 the Queensland Bulls played the New South Wales Blues at The Gabba, Brisbane. An unexpected 16,000 fans turned up on the day to buy tickets, causing Gabba staff to throw open gates and grant many fans free entry. Attendance reached 27,653. For the February 2008 Twenty20 match between Australia and India, 85,824 people attended the match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, involving the Twenty20 World Champions against the ODI World Champions.

The Stanford Super Series was held in October 2008 between the three teams. The respective winners of the English and Caribbean Twenty20 competitions, Middlesex and Trinidad and Tobago, and a Stanford Superstars team formed from West Indies domestic players. Trinidad and Tobago won the competition, securing US$280,000 prize money. On 1 November, the Stanford Superstars played England in what was expected to be the first of five fixtures in as many years with the winner claiming US$20 million in each match. The Stanford Superstars won the first match, but no further fixtures were held as Allen Stanford was charged with fraud in 2009.

===T20 leagues===
Several T20 leagues started after the popularity of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20. The Board of Control for Cricket in India started the Indian Premier League popularly known as IPL, which is now the largest cricket league, in 2008, which utilizes the North American sports franchise system with ten teams in major Indian cities. In September 2017, the broadcasting and digital rights for the next five years (2018–2022) of the IPL were sold to Star India for US$2.55 billion, making it one of the world&#x27;s most lucrative sports league per match. The IPL has seen a spike in its brand valuation to US$5.3 billion after the 10th edition, according to global valuation and corporate finance advisor Duff &amp; Phelps.

The Big Bash League, Bangladesh Premier League, Pakistan Super League, Caribbean Premier League, and Afghanistan Premier League started thereafter, following similar formulae, and remained popular with the fans. The Women&#x27;s Big Bash League was started in 2015 by Cricket Australia, while the Kia Super League was started in England and Wales in 2016. The Mzansi Super League in South Africa was started in 2018.

Several T20 leagues follow the general format of having a group stage followed by a Page playoff system among the top four teams where:
* The first- and second-highest placed teams in the group stage face off, with the winner going to the final.
* The third- and fourth-place teams face off, with the loser being eliminated.
* The two teams who have not yet made it to the final after the above two matches have been played face off to fill the second berth in the final.

In the Big Bash League, there is an additional match to determine which of the fourth- or fifth-placed teams will qualify to be in the top four.

===Twenty20 Internationals===

The first Twenty20 International match was held on 5 August 2004 between the England and New Zealand women&#x27;s teams, with New Zealand winning by nine runs.

On 17 February 2005 Australia defeated New Zealand in the first men&#x27;s international Twenty20 match, played at Eden Park in Auckland. The game was played in a light-hearted manner – both sides turned out in kit similar to that worn in the 1980s, the New Zealand team&#x27;s a direct copy of that worn by the Beige Brigade. Some of the players also sported moustaches or beards and hairstyles popular in the 1980s, taking part in a competition amongst themselves for &quot;best retro look&quot;, at the request of the Beige Brigade. Australia won the game comprehensively, and as the result became obvious towards the end of the NZ innings, the players and umpires took things less seriously: Glenn McGrath jokingly replayed the Trevor Chappell underarm incident from a 1981 ODI between the two sides, and Billy Bowden showed him a mock red card (red cards are not normally used in cricket) in response.

The first Twenty20 international in England was played between England and Australia at the Rose Bowl in Hampshire on 13 June 2005, which England won by a margin of 100 runs, a record victory which lasted until 2007.

On 9 January 2006 Australia and South Africa met in the first international Twenty20 game in Australia. In a first, each player&#x27;s nickname appeared on the back of his uniform, rather than his surname. The international match drew a crowd of 38,894 people at The Gabba.

On 16 February 2006 New Zealand defeated West Indies in a tie-breaking bowl-out 3–0; 126 runs were scored apiece in the game proper. The game was the last international match played by Chris Cairns.

The ICC has declared that it sees T20 as the optimal format for globalizing the game, and in 2018, announced that it will give international status to all T20 cricket matches played between its member nations. This resulted in a significant leap in the number of T20I matches played across the world.

==== Twenty20 World Cup ====

Every two years an ICC World Twenty20 tournament is to take place, except in the event of an ICC Cricket World Cup being scheduled in the same year, in which case it will be held the year before. The first tournament was in 2007 in South Africa where India defeated Pakistan in the final. Two Associate teams had played in the first tournament, selected through the 2007 ICC World Cricket League Division One, a 50-over competition. In December 2007 it was decided to hold a qualifying tournament with a 20-over format to better prepare the teams. With six participants, two would qualify for the 2009 World Twenty20 and would each receive $250,000 in prize money. The second tournament was won by Pakistan, who beat Sri Lanka by eight wickets in England on 21 June 2009. The 2010 ICC World Twenty20 tournament was held in the West Indies in May 2010, where England defeated Australia by seven wickets. The 2012 ICC World Twenty20 was won by the West Indies, by defeating Sri Lanka at the finals. It was the first time in cricket history when a T20 World Cup tournament took place in an Asian country. The 2014 ICC World Twenty20 was won by Sri Lanka, by defeating India at the finals, where the tournament was held in Bangladesh. The 2016 ICC World Twenty20 was won by West Indies. In July 2020, the ICC announced that both the 2020 and 2021 editions had been postponed by one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In June 2021, the ICC expanded the Twenty20 World Cup from 16 to 20 teams starting from the 2024 edition onwards.

===Impact on the game===

Twenty20 cricket is claimed to have resulted in a more athletic and explosive form of cricket. Indian fitness coach Ramji Srinivasan declared in an interview with the Indian fitness website Takath.com that Twenty20 had &quot;raised the bar&quot; in terms of fitness levels for all players, demanding higher levels of strength, speed, agility and reaction time from all players regardless of role in the team. Matthew Hayden credited retirement from international cricket with aiding his performance in general and fitness in particular in the Indian Premier League.

Several commentators have noted that the T20 format has been embraced by many Associate Members of the ICC partly because it is more financially viable to play. T20&#x27;s success has also inspired the invention of even shorter formats, such as T10 cricket and 100-ball cricket, and its impact on cricket has been compared to or served as inspiration for innovations in other sports, such as with the 3x3 variant of basketball or the Indian Pro Kabaddi League.

Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting, on the other hand, has criticised Twenty20 as being detrimental to Test cricket and for hampering batsmen&#x27;s scoring skills and concentration. Former Australian captain Greg Chappell made similar complaints, fearing that young players would play too much T20 and not develop their batting skills fully, while former England player Alex Tudor feared the same for bowling skills.

Former West Indies captains Clive Lloyd, Michael Holding and Garfield Sobers criticised Twenty20 for its role in discouraging players from representing their test cricket national side, with many West Indies players like Chris Gayle, Sunil Narine and Dwayne Bravo preferring instead to play in a Twenty20 franchise elsewhere in the world and make far more money.

=== Inclusion in multi-sport events ===
In June 2009, speaking at the annual Cowdrey Lecture at Lord&#x27;s, former Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist pushed for Twenty20 to be made an Olympic sport. &quot;It would,&quot; he said, &quot;be difficult to see a better, quicker or cheaper way of spreading the game throughout the world.&quot; This became a reality starting with the 2028 Summer Olympics. T20 cricket has also been accepted into the Asian Games and Commonwealth Games.

==Match format and rules==
===Format===
Twenty20 match format is a form of limited overs cricket in that it involves two teams, each with a single innings. The key feature is that each team bats for a maximum of 20 overs (120 legal balls). The batting team members do not arrive from and depart to traditional dressing rooms, but come and go from a bench (typically a row of chairs) visible in the playing arena, analogous to association football&#x27;s technical area or a baseball dugout.

===General rules===
The Laws of Cricket apply to Twenty20, with major exceptions:

* Each bowler may bowl a maximum of only one-fifth of the total overs per innings. For a full, uninterrupted match, this is four overs.
*If a bowler delivers a no-ball by overstepping the crease, it costs one or two runs (depending on the competition) and their next delivery is designated a &quot;free-hit&quot;. In this circumstance the batter can only be dismissed through a run out, hitting the ball twice or obstructing the field.
* The following fielding restrictions apply:
** No more than five fielders can be on the leg side at any time.
** During the first six overs, a maximum of two fielders can be outside the 30-yard circle (this is known as the powerplay).
** After the first six overs, a maximum of five fielders can be outside the fielding circle.
*** However, in Australia&#x27;s Big Bash League the Powerplay is only the first 4 overs, with the batters choosing when the same restrictions apply for 2 overs in the second half of the innings, in a period called a Powersurge.
* If the fielding team does not start to bowl their 20th over within 75 minutes, the batting side is credited an extra six runs for every whole over bowled after the 75-minute mark; the umpire may add more time to this if they believe the batting team is wasting time.

===Tie deciders===

Currently, if the match ends with the scores tied and there must be a winner, the tie is broken with a one-over-per-side Eliminator or Super Over: Each team nominates three batsmen and one bowler to play a one-over-per-side &quot;mini-match&quot;. The team which bats second in the match bats first in the Super Over. In turn, each side bats one over bowled by the one nominated opposition bowler, with their innings over if they lose two wickets before the over is completed. The side with the higher score from their Super Over wins.
If the Super Over also ends up in a tie, it is repeated until the tie is broken.

In the Australian domestic competition the Big Bash League, the Super Over is played slightly differently, with no two-wicket limit, and if the Super Over is also tied then a &quot;&quot; is used, with scores after the fifth ball for each team being used to determine the result. If it is still tied, then the countback goes to four balls, and so on. The latest Super Over to decide a match was between the United States and Pakistan on 6 June 2024, in the 2024 ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas, with the United States winning 18/1 to 13/1 in the Super Over after tying on 159.

Tied Twenty20 matches were previously decided by a bowl-out.

==International==

Women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s Twenty20 Internationals have been played since 2004 and 2005 respectively. To date, 76 nations have played the format, including all Test-playing nations.

===T20 International rankings===

In November 2011, the ICC released the first Twenty20 International rankings for the men&#x27;s game, based on the same system as the Test and ODI rankings. The rankings cover a two- to three-year period, with matches since the most recent 1 August weighted fully, matches in the preceding 12 months weighted two-thirds, and matches in the 12 months preceding that weighted one-third. To qualify for the rankings, teams must have played at least eight Twenty20 Internationals in the ranking period.

The ICC Women&#x27;s Rankings were launched in October 2015, which aggregated performance over all three forms of the game. In October 2018, the ICC announced that the women&#x27;s ranking would be split between ODIs and T20Is, and released both tables shortly thereafter.

<text>Théodore Aubanel (Occitan:&quot;Teodòr Aubanèu&quot;; 26 March 1829 – 2 November 1886) was a Provençal poet. He was born in Avignon in a family of printers.

Aubanel started writing poetry in French but quickly switched to Provençal, due to the influence of Joseph Roumanille. He is known primarily for &quot;La Miougrano entreduberto&quot; (1860, &quot;The Split Pomegranate&quot;) and &quot;Li Fiho d&#x27;Avignoun&quot; (1885, &quot;The Young Ladies of Avignon&quot;), two collections of lyric poems.

He died in Avignon.

<doc id="770696" wikidata="Q67692949" url="?curid=770696" title="Slovak orthography">
<text>The first Slovak orthography was proposed and created by the Slovakian Catholic priest Anton Bernolák (1762–1813) in his &quot;Dissertatio philologico-critica de litteris Slavorum&quot;, used in the six-volume &quot;Slovak-Czech-Latin-German-Hungarian Dictionary&quot; (1825–1927) and used primarily by Slovak Catholics.

The standard orthography of the Slovak language is immediately based on the standard developed by Ľudovít Štúr in 1844 and reformed by Martin Hattala in 1851 with the agreement of Štúr. The then-current (1840s) form of the central Slovak dialect was chosen as the standard. After Hattala&#x27;s reform, the standardized orthography remained mostly unchanged.

==Alphabet==
The Slovak alphabet is an extension of the Latin alphabet with 46 letters including the four diacritics (ˇ(mäkčeň), ´(acute accent), ¨(diaeresis/umlaut), ˆ(circumflex)), which makes it the longest Slavic and European alphabet.

In IPA transcriptions of Slovak, are often written with , i.e. as if they were palato-alveolar. The palato-alveolar exist in Slovak, but only as allophones of , which are normally retroflex, as in Polish.

The following digraphs are not considered to be a part of the Slovak alphabet:
* , which stands for the rising-opening diphthong , similar to the sequence in English (as in yap ), rather than the common realization of the underlying in the German word &quot;Wirt&quot; &#x27;host&#x27;, which is falling;
* , which stands for the rising-opening diphthong , similar to the sequence in English (as in yes );
* , which stands for the rising-backing diphthong , similar to the sequence in English (as in use ) (but with a short ending point), never as a falling-backing diphthong as in some Welsh English new .

In loanwords, all three can stand for the disyllabic sequences , rather than the rising diphthongs. The starting points of those diphthongs are written with , rather than (as in Spanish &quot;tierra&quot; ) because count as a long vowel in the rhythmical rule described below, unlike the phonological consonant followed by a short vowel. also counts as a long vowel, though there is no * sequence to rival it, as never appears before a vowel within the same word.

==Sound–spelling correspondences==
The primary principle of Slovak spelling is the phonemic principle. The secondary principle is the morphological principle: forms derived from the same stem are written in the same way even if they are pronounced differently. An example of this principle is the assimilation rule (see below). The tertiary principle is the etymological principle, which can be seen in the use of &quot;i&quot; after certain consonants and of &quot;y&quot; after other consonants, although both &quot;i&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are pronounced the same way.

Finally, the rarely applied grammatical principle is present when, for example, the basic singular form and plural form of masculine adjectives are written differently with no difference in pronunciation (e.g. pekný = nice – singular versus pekní = nice – plural).

Most foreign words receive Slovak spelling immediately or after some time. For example, &quot;weekend&quot; is spelled &quot;víkend&quot; , &quot;software&quot; - &quot;softvér&quot; , &quot;gay&quot; - &quot;gej&quot; (both not exclusively), and &quot;quality&quot; is spelled &quot;kvalita&quot;. Personal and geographical names from other languages using Latin alphabets keep their original spelling unless a fully Slovak form of the name exists (e.g. &quot;Londýn&quot; for &quot;London&quot;).

The letters e, i, í, ie, ia trigger the palatal realization of the preceding D, N, T, L with few exceptions when the letters denote the ordinary alveolar phonetic value. To accelerate writing, a rule has been introduced that the frequent sequences , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , are written without a mäkčeň as de, te, ne, le, di, ti, ni, li, dí, tí, ní, lí, die, tie, nie, lie, dia, tia, nia, lia.

Some exceptions are as follows:
#foreign words (e.g. &quot;telefón&quot; is pronounced )
#the following words: &quot;ten&quot; &#x27;that&#x27;, &quot;jeden&quot; &#x27;one&#x27;, &quot;vtedy&quot; &#x27;then&#x27;, &quot;teraz&quot; &#x27;now&#x27;
#nominative masculine plural endings of pronouns and adjectives do not turn the preceding d, n, t into palatal consonants (e.g. &quot;tí odvážni mladí muži&quot; , the/those brave young men)
#in adjectival endings, both the long é and the short e (shortened by the rhythmical rule) do not make the preceding d, n, t palatal, so that both &quot;zelené stromy&quot; &#x27;green trees&#x27; and &quot;krásne stromy&quot; &#x27;beautiful trees&#x27; feature the alveolar , rather than the alveolo-palatal .
#However, the adverb &quot;krásne&quot; (meaning &#x27;beautifully&#x27;) does feature the alveolo-palatal , resulting in a heterophonic homograph with &quot;krásne&quot; &#x27;beautiful&#x27; (inflected), which features the same alveolar as the uninflected form &quot;krásny&quot; , which has an unambiguous spelling. There are some more examples of heterophonic homographs like this.

When a voiced obstruent (b, d, ď, dz, dž, g, h, z, ž) is at the end of the word before a pause, it is pronounced as its voiceless counterpart (p, t, ť, c, č, k, ch, s, š, respectively). For example, &quot;pohyb&quot; is pronounced and &quot;prípad&quot; is pronounced .

When &quot;v&quot; is at the end of the syllable, it is pronounced as labio-velar . For example, &quot;kov&quot; (metal), &quot;kravský&quot; (cow - adjective), but &quot;povstať&quot; (uprise), because the is morpheme-initial (&quot;po-vstať&quot;).

The feminine singular instrumental suffix -ou is also pronounced , as if it were spelled -ov.

Consonant clusters containing both voiced and voiceless elements are entirely voiced if the last consonant is voiced, or entirely voiceless if the last consonant is voiceless. For example, &quot;otázka&quot; is pronounced and &quot;vzchopiť sa&quot; is pronounced . This rule applies also over the word boundary. One example is as follows: &quot;prísť domov&quot; (to come home) and &quot;viac jahôd&quot; (more strawberries). The voiced counterpart of &quot;ch&quot; is , and the unvoiced counterpart of &quot;h&quot; is .

One of the most important changes in Slovak orthography in the 20th century was in 1953 when &quot;s&quot; began to be written as &quot;z&quot; where pronounced in prefixes (e.g. &quot;smluva&quot; into &quot;zmluva&quot; as well as &quot;sväz&quot; into &quot;zväz&quot; ). The phonemic principle has been given priority over the etymological principle in this case.

===Rhythmical rule===

The rhythmical rule, also known as the rule of &quot;rhythmical shortening&quot;, states that a long syllable (that is, a syllable containing á, é, í, ý, ó, ú, ŕ, ĺ, ia, , iu, ô) cannot be followed by another long one within the same word. If two long syllables were to occur next to each other, the second one is to be made short. This rule has morphophonemic implications for declension (e.g. &quot;žen-ám&quot; but &quot;tráv-am&quot; ) and conjugation (e.g. &quot;nos-ím&quot; but &quot;súd-im&quot;). Several exceptions of this rule exist. It is typical of literary Slovak, and does not appear in Czech or in some Slovak dialects.

==Diacritics==
The acute mark (in Slovak &quot;dĺžeň&quot;, &quot;prolongation mark&quot; or &quot;lengthener&quot;) indicates length (e.g. í = ). This mark may appear on any vowel except &quot;ä&quot; (wide &quot;e&quot;, široké &quot;e&quot; in Slovak). It may also appear above the consonants &quot;l&quot; and &quot;r&quot;, indicating the long syllabic and sounds.

The circumflex (&quot;vokáň&quot;) exists only above the letter &quot;o&quot;. It turns the o into a diphthong (see above).

The umlaut (&quot;prehláska&quot;, &quot;dve bodky&quot; = two dots) is only used above the letter &quot;a&quot;. It indicates an opening diphthong , similar to German &quot;Herz&quot; &#x27;heart&#x27; (when it is not pronounced , with a consonantal ).

The caron (in Slovak &quot;mäkčeň&quot;, &quot;palatalization mark&quot; or &quot;softener&quot;) indicates a change of alveolar fricatives, affricates, and plosives into either retroflex or palatal consonants, in informal Slovak linguistics often called just &quot;palatalization&quot;. Eight consonants can bear a mäkčeň. Not all &quot;normal&quot; consonants have a counterpart with mäkčeň:
*In printed texts, the mäkčeň is printed in two forms: (1) č, dž, š, ž, ň and (2) ľ, ď, ť (looking more like an apostrophe), but this is just a convention. In handwritten texts, it usually always appears in the first form.
*Phonetically, two forms of &quot;palatalization&quot; exist: ľ, ň, ď, ť are palatal, while č, dž, š, ž are retroflex (which, phonetically speaking, is not &quot;soft&quot; but &quot;hard&quot;).

==Computer encoding==
The Slovak alphabet is available within the ISO/IEC 8859-2 &quot;Latin-2&quot; encoding, which generally supports Eastern European languages. All vowels, but none of the specific consonants (that is, no č, ď, ľ, ĺ, ň, ŕ, š, ť, ž) are available within the &quot;Latin-1&quot; encoding, which generally supports only Western European languages.

<text>The Neal S. Blaisdell Center is a community center near downtown Honolulu, Hawaii. The complex has a multi-purpose arena, concert hall, exhibition hall, galleria, meeting rooms, Waikiki Shell and others.

Constructed in 1964 on the historic Ward Estate and originally called the Honolulu International Center, the center was renamed after Mayor of Honolulu Neal S. Blaisdell, who oversaw its construction. It was remodeled and expanded in 1994. The complex is overseen by the city&#x27;s Department of Enterprise Services, which also oversees the Waikiki Shell. the city is seeking to redevelop the site with extensive stakeholder and public involvement to assess the community&#x27;s goals.

==Facilities and events==
===Arena===

The Neal S. Blaisdell Arena is a circular performance facility used for concerts and major sporting events. The arena can accommodate 7,700 seats for sports events, and up to 8,800 seats for stage events with seats set up on the arena floor.

On December 3, 1966, The Monkees gave their first live concert here. They played a 40-minute set. Loggins and Messina performed their final two concerts here on September 24 and 25, 1976.

Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite&quot; concert was held here on January 14, 1973. In recognition of the concert, a bronze statue of Presley was installed in 2007 outside the front of the arena. The statue was sponsored by the cable channel TV Land.

Other events at the arena include WWE live events, Disney on Ice, &quot;American Idol Live!&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street Live&quot;, college basketball and volleyball, and international gymnastics, as well as a fundraising concert for victims of Hurricane Iniki, with Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, Jackson Browne &amp; Bonnie Raitt, and a 1965 Billy Graham crusade.

Other music artists that have performed at the arena include The Beach Boys, Kiss, Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, The Rolling Stones, Mariah Carey, The Jackson 5, Metallica, Aerosmith, Van Halen, Bon Jovi, Elton John, Santana, Toto, Journey, Halsey Run-DMC, Coolio, Bruno Mars, No Doubt, America, Bread (band), Culture Club, Avenged Sevenfold, Janet Jackson, and Carrie Underwood.

During a circus performance in 1994, Tyke, an African Elephant, killed her trainer and charged out of the arena in a rage. The animal rampaged outside the arena for 30 minutes before police fired 87 rounds at the elephant, who eventually collapsed and died as a result of the shooting.

The Philippine TV show &quot;ASAP&quot; performed at the arena on June 30, 2018, through an international concert titled &quot;ASAP Live in Honolulu&quot;.

Many graduation and commencement ceremonies are held by schools in the arena and concert hall in late May and June.

===Sports===
The Arena also hosts the start of the exhibition season for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association and the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball and volleyball games for Hawaii Pacific University, the state&#x27;s largest private university. It served as the home court for University of Hawaii at Mānoa basketball until UH built the Stan Sheriff Center on campus in 1994. The arena was the home venue for several short-lived attempts to establish Hawaii professional sports teams, including the Hawaii Volcanos of the Continental Basketball Association, the Hawaii Hurricanes of the American Basketball Association, the Hawaii Leis of World Team Tennis and three indoor football teams: the Honolulu Hurricanes, the Hawaii Hammerheads, and the AF2&#x27;s Hawaiian Islanders, and the Arena Football League All-Star game of 2013. The Leis and Islanders each persisted for three full seasons, the longest of all the pro teams based at the arena. In 1982, the arena served as home court for Chaminade University in a Christmas Eve upset of a Ralph Sampson-led number one ranked University of Virginia, 77–72.

In November 2006, the Professional Bull Riders hosted the Cheeseburger Island Style PBR Hawaii All-Star Challenge, a special event that took place between the 2006 PBR World Finals and the start of the 2007 PBR season.

In 2020, the arena hosted a Davis Cup qualifying round matchup between the United States and Uzbekistan.

===Concert Hall===

With a capacity of 2,158 seats, the Neal S. Blaisdell Concert Hall was the home of the Honolulu Symphony and the Hawaii Opera Theatre. Broadway productions such as &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, &quot;Rent&quot;, &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;, &quot;Chicago&quot;, &quot;Cats&quot;, and other national touring shows have performed at the concert hall. In the fall and early winter of 2007 the concert hall was host to the Broadway musical &quot;The Lion King&quot;, a booking which displaced the Honolulu Symphony from its usual home and led to a major cash flow crisis for the orchestra. Elvis Presley also performed at the then Honolulu International Centre.

===Exhibition Hall===

Located between the Concert Hall and the Arena, the Exhibition Hall provides of exhibition space on the main floor that is expandable to when combined with adjoining spaces. Five meeting rooms are also available in the hall. The Exhibition Hall accommodates numerous local trade and consumer shows and fundraising events throughout the year, and is one of the main exhibition venues in Honolulu in addition to the Hawaii Convention Center.

The Exhibition Hall hosts events throughout the year such as craft fairs, gun shows, family expos, job fairs, food &amp; product shows, as well as private trade shows.

===Miscellaneous===
Many religious ceremonies have been performed in the Neal S. Blaisdell Center. The largest of which were the enthronement of Joseph Anthony Ferrario as the third Bishop of Honolulu and the ordination and installation of Clarence Richard Silva as the fifth Bishop of Honolulu, overseeing the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu. Kamehameha Schools has held their annual song contest at the Blaisdell since 1964.

On December 23, 1982, what is considered by many as the greatest upset in sports history happened at the Blaisdell Arena as the then number 1-ranked University of Virginia Cavaliers, led by future Hall of Famer Ralph Sampson, were beaten 77–72 by Chaminade University, a small NAIA school (today NCAA Division II) with a student body of 800.

<text>Northern Kalapuyan is an extinct Kalapuyan language indigenous to northwestern Oregon in the United States. It was spoken by Kalapuya groups in the northern Willamette Valley southwest of present-day Portland.

Three distinct dialects of the language have been identified. The Tualatin dialect (Tfalati, Atfalati) was spoken along the Tualatin River. The Yamhill (Yamhala) dialect was spoken along the Yamhill River. The language is closely related to Central Kalapuya, spoken by related groups in the central and southern Willamette Valley.

The terminal speaker of Northern Kalapuya was Louis Kenoyer who died in 1937.

<doc id="770725" wikidata="Q151446" url="?curid=770725" title="Propyne">
<text>Propyne (methylacetylene) is an alkyne with the chemical formula . It is a component of MAPD gas—along with its isomer propadiene (allene), which was commonly used in gas welding. Unlike acetylene, propyne can be safely condensed.

==Production and equilibrium with propadiene==
Propyne exists in equilibrium with propadiene, the mixture of propyne and propadiene being called MAPD:
The coefficient of equilibrium &quot;K&quot;eq is 0.22 at 270 °C or 0.1 at 5 °C.
MAPD is produced as a side product, often an undesirable one, by cracking propane to produce propene, an important feedstock in the chemical industry. MAPD interferes with the catalytic polymerization of propene.

===Laboratory methods===
Propyne can also be synthesized on laboratory scale by reducing 1-propanol, allyl alcohol or acetone vapors over magnesium.

==Use as a rocket fuel==
European space companies have researched using light hydrocarbons with liquid oxygen, a relatively high performing liquid rocket propellant combination that would also be less toxic than the commonly used MMH/NTO (monomethylhydrazine/nitrogen tetroxide). Their research showed that propyne would be highly advantageous as a rocket fuel for craft intended for low Earth orbital operations. They reached this conclusion based upon a specific impulse expected to reach 370 s with oxygen as the oxidizer, a high density and power density—and the moderate boiling point, which makes the chemical easier to store than cryogenic fuels that must be kept at extremely low temperatures.

==Organic chemistry==
Propyne is a convenient three-carbon building block for organic synthesis. Deprotonation with &quot;n&quot;-butyllithium gives propynyllithium. This nucleophilic reagent adds to carbonyl groups, producing alcohols and esters. Whereas purified propyne is expensive, MAPP gas could be used to cheaply generate large amounts of the reagent.

Propyne, along with 2-butyne, is also used to synthesize alkylated hydroquinones in the total synthesis of vitamin E.

The chemical shift of an alkynyl proton and propargylic proton generally occur in the same region of the 1H NMR spectrum. In propyne, these two signals have almost exactly the same chemical shifts, leading to overlap of the signals, and the 1H NMR spectrum of propyne, when recorded in deuteriochloroform on a 300 MHz instrument, consists of a single signal, a sharp singlet resonating at 1.8 ppm.

== In Astrophysics ==
Propyne has been detected in multiple astrophysical objects following its first observation in 1973 in the galactic center giant molecular cloud Sgr B2 using radio astronomy techniques. Propyne has been proposed to act as a precursor molecule to the formation of PAHs in space, such as indene.

Propyne has been detected by infrared spectroscopy in the chemically reducing atmospheres of the outer planets in our solar system, including on Jupiter in 2000 and on Saturn in 1997, both using the Infrared Space Observatory; on Titan in 1981 using Voyager&#x27;s IRIS instrument; and on the ice giants Uranus in 2006 and on Neptune in 2008 using the Spitzer space telescope.

<doc id="770726" wikidata="Q3192120" url="?curid=770726" title="Central Kalapuya language">
<text>Central Kalapuyan was a Kalapuyan language indigenous to the central and southern Willamette Valley in Oregon in the United States. It was spoken by various bands of the Kalapuya peoples who inhabited the valley up through the middle of the 19th century. The language is closely related to Northern Kalapuya, spoken in the Tualatin and Yamhill valleys. 

== Dialects ==
Dialects of Central Kalapuya that have been identified include:

*Ahantchuyuk dialect, spoken in the northeastern Willamette Valley along the Pudding and Molalla rivers
*Santiam dialect, spoken in the central Willamette Valley along the lower Santiam River
*Luckiamute dialect, spoken in the central Willamette Valley along the Luckiamute River
*Chepenafa dialect, spoken in the central Willamette Valley along Marys River
*Chemapho dialect, spoken in the central Willamette Valley along Muddy Creek
*Chelamela dialect, spoken in the southwestern Willamette Valley along the Long Tom River
*Tsankupi dialect, spoken in the southeastern Willamette Valley along the Calapooia River
*Winefelly-Mohawk dialects, spoken in the southeastern Willamette Valley along the McKenzie, Mohawk, and Coast Fork Willamette rivers

==Phonology==

The phonology of the Santiam dialect, as described by Jacobs (1945) and analyzed by Banks (2007), is listed below. Banks notes that Jacobs&#x27; analysis does not rigorously account for allophonic variation, and that, according to Jacobs, there may have been some interchangeability between the velar and uvular series.

===Consonants===
The nasals and likely had syllabic forms: and . Jacobs possibly notes that the plosives also have voiced allophones, as , , , , , and . Banks also notes that /h/, /hʷ/, /dz/, /dʒ/, and /ɸʷ/ may have been allophones.

===Vowels===

Santiam Kalapuya had three diphthongs: [ai], [au], and [ui]. Vowel length may have been phonemic, /ɔ/ may have been an allophone of /u/.

<text>Seals Stadium was a Minor League Baseball stadium in San Francisco, California, United States; it later became the first home of the major-league San Francisco Giants. Opened in the Mission District in 1931, Seals Stadium was the longtime home of the San Francisco Seals (1931–1957) of the Pacific Coast League. The PCL&#x27;s Mission Reds (1931–1937) shared the ballpark with the Seals for the first seven years, then moved to Los Angeles and became the Hollywood Stars.

In 1958, Seals Stadium became a temporary home for the Giants for their first two seasons in San Francisco while Candlestick Park was under construction. Less than three decades old, Seals Stadium was demolished in late 1959 after construction on Candlestick Park was finished.

==History==
===Early years===
Seals Stadium opened on April 7, 1931, after a construction cost of $1.25million. It was of concrete and steel construction and was named after its key tenant, the Pacific Coast League&#x27;s San Francisco Seals. It was uniquely designed to host another San Francisco Pacific Coast League team, the Mission Reds. The ballpark land had been part of pioneer land plots of the &quot;Home Plate Mine&quot;, which became an early nickname of the ballpark. Built during the Great Depression, Seals President &quot;Doc&quot; Strub described how laborers would leap onto the running boards of his automobile and beg for the opportunity to work on the project for $3 a day.

With two tenants, Seals Stadium was uniquely constructed with three dressing rooms. One dressing room was for the visiting team, and one for each of the minor league home teams. The stadium had six tower banks for lighting, which were described as the best in minor league baseball at the time.

Opening with a capacity of 18,600, Seals Stadium had no roof over the grandstands, because of San Francisco&#x27;s little rainfall during the summertime and the fans&#x27; preference to sit in the sun. The original uncovered grandstand stretched from foul pole to foul pole and there was uncovered bleacher section in right field. In some years during its minor league days, a live seal was kept in a water tank underneath the grandstand. The field was oriented southeast (home plate to second base), with the right field bleachers bounded by 16th Street.

=== San Francisco Seals (1931–1957) / Mission Reds (1931–1937) ===
The San Francisco Seals began play in 1903 as charter team in the Pacific Coast League. They played at the wooden Recreation Park, located at Valencia and 14th Street, before Seals Stadium was built for them. In 1926, the Pacific Coast League Mission Reds (named after the Mission District) relocated from Los Angeles where they had been called the Vernon Tigers. They joined the Seals at Recreation Park.

On March 13, 1931, Seals Stadium officially opened with a spring training game between the Seals and the Detroit Tigers. At the regular season home opener on April 7, 1931, Ty Cobb threw out the first pitch, with 25,000 fans in attendance. The Missions opened their home season at Seals Stadium a week later, April 14 - hosting the Seals.

Notably, Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio grew up in San Francisco and played for the Seals from October 1932 through 1935. In 1933, DiMaggio hit safely in a record 61 straight games for the Seals, with 169 RBI and a batting average of.340. Another future major league player Gus Suhr had an incredible season for the Seals in 1929, hitting .381 with 51 home runs and 177 RBI. Other notable Seals players included Hall of Famers Earl Averill, Tony Lazzeri, Joe Cronin and Lefty Gomez, as well as Dominic DiMaggio, Vince DiMaggio, Albie Pearson and Ferris Fain.
Seals Stadium hosted other events. On February 22, 1933, boxer Young Corbett III defeated Jackie Fields at the stadium, earning the title of World Welterweight Champion. Corbett later won the Middleweight Championship at Seals, beating Fred Apostoli on February 22, 1938.

While the Seals remained, the Mission Reds left Seals Stadium and moved to Los Angeles in 1938, where they became the Hollywood Stars, playing at Gilmore Field.

After World War II concluded, Seals owner Paul Fagan invested in a stadium makeover. Fagan had all billboards removed and had the entire stadium painted green. Nearby the stadium was the Rainier (later Hamm&#x27;s) Brewery. The roof of the brewery contained a sign depicting an enormous foaming glass of beer that was lit up at night and was visible from inside the park. Also nearby was the Langendorf Bakery, which sent the smell of baking bread into the ballpark. At the corner of 16th Street and Bryant was the Double Play bar and grill, which opened in 1909 and is still in operation today. It has been described as a &quot;shrine to baseball.&quot;

The Seals drew well at Seals Park. In 1948 they set a minor league attendance record, drawing 670,000 fans. This showcased the feasibility that San Francisco could someday sustain and support a Major League franchise and Fagan was posturing to position the Seals to become a major league franchise.
In 1950, Fagan briefly halted peanut sales at the stadium, possibly due to cleanup costs. The move was ill-advised, as disgruntled fans brought their own peanuts and hurled the shells onto the field. After the “Peanut Revolt,” Fagan gave away 18,000 free bags of peanuts.

In 1958, after the New York Giants announced their intention move to San Francisco, the Seals were forced to move. The minor league franchise was relocated to Phoenix, Arizona, in 1958, becoming the Phoenix Giants.

===San Francisco Giants (1958–1959)===

On May 28, 1957, the New York Giants and owner Horace Stoneham announced they intended to leave the Polo Grounds in New York City and relocate to San Francisco. The major league owners approved the move under the condition that the Brooklyn Dodgers would also complete their intended move to Los Angeles. Dodgers&#x27; owner Walter O&#x27;Malley and San Francisco Mayor George Christopher had worked to partner with Stoneham on the move to San Francisco. Both teams moving to California together made sense for scheduling balance and travel. On August 19, 1957, official announcement of the moves was made. By agreement, both teams would play in temporary locations while each city build a new ballpark. The Giants agreed to play at Seals Stadium while Candlestick Park was under construction and the Dodgers played at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, (bypassing smaller Los Angeles Wrigley Field), while Dodger Stadium was under construction.

To accommodate Major League Baseball, more seating was needed at Seals Stadium. A separate uncovered bleacher section was added in left field. The ballfield remained without a warning track. Given the temporary usage by the Giants, Seals Stadium was not renamed. The original plan was to play just the first year at Seals Stadium, but that proved to not be the case.

On April 15, 1958, the first West Coast Major League game was played at Seals Park. With Hall of Famers Willie Mays and Orlando Cepeda, the Giants opened with an 8–0 victory over Don Drysdale and the new Los Angeles Dodgers. Mays would go on to hit .347 with 29 home runs in 1958 and Cepeda would win the National League Rookie of the Year Award. Willie McCovey, another future Hall of Famer, then won the award in 1959. Cepeda would hit his first career home run at Seals Stadium on April 15, 1958.

The Giants drew well at Seals Stadium. Finishing 80–74 in 1958, they drew 1,272,625 fans. That increased to 1,422,130 in 1959, when the Giants finished 83–71.

Prevailing winds to left field aided right-handed hitters; of the 45 home runs hit in its first 19 major league games in 1958, 36 were to left field. All-Star Giants pitcher Johnny Antonelli was not a fan of the ballpark, telling reporters after a loss, &quot;A pitcher should be paid double for working here. Worst ballpark in America. Every time you stand up there, you’ve got to beat the hitter and a 30-mile-per-hour wind.&quot; A brewery was just north of the venue.

At the time, its weather was thought to be considerably less favorable than the site of the park under construction at Candlestick Point.

The final game at Seals Stadium took place on September 20, 1959. The Giants lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers 8–2 in front of 22,923 spectators.

===1959 demolition and site usage===

With Candlestick Park nearing completion, Seals Stadium was demolished in November 1959. Many of the seats and the light towers were eventually repurposed at Cheney Stadium in Tacoma, Washington.

After demolition, the site (bounded by Bryant Street, 16th Street, Potrero Avenue and Alameda Street) initially housed a White Front department store. For many years after, there were several automobile dealerships after the 1982 demise of Van Ness Avenue&#x27;s famed auto row. In the late 1990s, the area was converted to a shopping center.
==2008: 50th anniversary tribute==
On April 15, 2008, the San Francisco Giants paid tribute to the 50th anniversary of their move to Seals Stadium. There was a ceremony at the Seals Stadium site and another at AT&amp;T Park to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 1958 Opening Day. The Giants&#x27; home game that day – against the Arizona Diamondbacks – was started at 1:35 p.m., the starting time commemorated the same time of day Giants&#x27; pitcher Ruben Gomez threw the first pitch at Seals Stadium on Opening Day, April 15, 1958. The first 20,000 fans attending the Diamondbacks-Giants game received a commemorative poster print of the Gomez&#x27; first pitch from 1958. Orlando Cepeda and Gino Cimoli, the first men to bat on that historic day, threw out the ceremonial first pitch.

There were pre-game events at the site of Seals Stadium. Ceremonies included the unveiling of a new bronze historical plaque at the site, a recreation of the radio call of the first pitch by Jon Miller, an honoring of Mike Murphy, the Giants 50-year legendary clubhouse manager, as well as speeches/recollections by Willie Mays and others. Among those recognized were Giants Hall of Famers Mays and Orlando Cepeda and 1958 Giants players Jim Davenport and Eddie Bressoud. Descendants of former Giants&#x27; owner Horace Stoneham and Mayor George Christopher (both instrumental in moving the Giants from New York to San Francisco) were in attendance.
