<text>John Porter (born 11 September 1947 in Leeds) is an English musician and record producer.

== Biography ==
He attended St Michael&#x27;s School, Allerton Grange School, King&#x27;s College, London, and Newcastle University.

While at Newcastle, Porter met singer Bryan Ferry, and was part of his fledgling band The Gas Board. Ferry&#x27;s later band Roxy Music had achieved success in the early 1970s, but having had some troubles with bass players, Ferry invited Porter on board to record the 1973 album &quot;For Your Pleasure&quot; before the band found a permanent bassist. Porter went on to serve as a record producer for many later albums for Roxy Music and Bryan Ferry.

He has since produced for The Smiths, Billy Bragg, The Blades, Microdisney, School of Fish, B. B. King, Los Lonely Boys, Buddy Guy, Ryan Adams, Missy Higgins and numerous other bands. Lol Tolhurst, a founding member of The Cure, stated that Porter was the producer for the second album recorded by another of his bands, Presence.

In 1983, Porter married British model Linda Keith.

<text>John Clinton Porter (April 4, 1871 – May 27, 1959) was a U.S. political figure. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that he represented a &quot;unique mixture of reform politics and xenophobic Protestant populism [that] took him quite literally from the junk yard to City Hall.&quot; Porter was a member of the Ku Klux Klan during its popular resurgence in the early 1920s.

==Biography==

<text>The Tonto National Forest, encompassing , is the largest of the six national forests in Arizona and is the ninth largest national forest in the United States. The forest has diverse scenery, with elevations ranging from 1,400 feet (427 m) in the Sonoran Desert to 7,400 feet (2,256 m) in the ponderosa pine forests of the Mogollon Rim (pronounced MOH-gee-on, or MUH-gee-own). The Tonto National Forest is also one of the most visited &quot;urban&quot; forests in the United States.

The boundaries of the Tonto National Forest are the Phoenix metropolitan area to the south, the Mogollon Rim to the north and the San Carlos and Fort Apache Indian Reservation to the east. The Tonto (Spanish for &quot;foolish&quot;) is managed by the USDA Forest Service and its headquarters are in Phoenix. There are local ranger district offices in Globe, Mesa, Payson, Roosevelt, Scottsdale, and Young.

On June 13, 2020, a wildfire ignited in the Tonto Basin area. The Bush Fire, as it was named, burned , becoming Arizona&#x27;s fifth largest fire on record. The fire was sufficiently contained by July 1, prompting the Incident Management Team to transition control to the Forest Service, which subsequently conducted a Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) assessment to begin rehabilitation efforts. Investigators determined the fire was human-caused.

==Wildlife==
Many wildlife species inhabit the forest including Colorado desert raccoons, bald eagles, New Mexico black bears, Mearns coyotes, Arizona skunks, bobcats, greater roadrunners, prairie falcons, Coues&#x27; white-tailed deer, long-eared owls, desert mule deer, Western red-tailed hawks, Great blue herons, North American cougars, American barn owls, ring-tailed cats, American kestrels, pronghorns, javelinas, and Rocky Mountain elk.

==Lakes, rivers and streams==
The Tonto National Forest has six notable cold water reservoirs:
* Bartlett Reservoir
* Horseshoe Reservoir
The next four are created by the Salt River chain of dams:
* Saguaro Lake
* Canyon Lake
* Apache Lake
* Theodore Roosevelt Lake

==Wilderness areas==
There are eight federally designated wilderness areas within (or partially within) the Tonto National Forest:
* Four Peaks Wilderness
* Hellsgate Wilderness
* Mazatzal Wilderness (partly in Coconino NF)
* Pine Mountain Wilderness (partly in Prescott NF)
* Salome Wilderness
* Salt River Canyon Wilderness
* Sierra Ancha
* Superstition Wilderness

A portion of the Verde Wild and Scenic River also lies within the forest.

==History==
The Tonto Forest Reserve was established on October 3, 1905 by the United States General Land Office. In 1906 the forest reserves were transferred to the U.S. Forest Service, and on March 4, 1907 Tonto became a National Forest. On January 13, 1908 the Pinal Mountains National Forest was added along with other lands. On July 1, 1908 part of Black Mesa National Forest and other lands were added, and on July 1, 1953 part of Crook National Forest was added.

=== Proposed land transfer to Rio Tinto Group for copper mining ===
A land swap proposed as a part of the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act would permit a subsidiary of the Rio Tinto mining conglomerate, Resolution Copper Co., to acquire 2,422 acres of the Tonto National Forest, considered sacred by the San Carlos Apache Tribe, for purposes of copper mining. This proposal, in Section 3003, titled &quot;Southeast Arizona Land Exchange&quot;, is strongly opposed by many Native Americans, including the 57 member tribes of The Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, and by the Great Plains Tribal Chairmen&#x27;s Association.

<doc id="764977" wikidata="Q708904" url="?curid=764977" title="Peter Buell Porter">
<text>Peter Buell Porter (August 14, 1773 – March 20, 1844) was an American lawyer, soldier and politician who served as United States Secretary of War from 1828 to 1829.

==Early life==
Porter was born on August 14, 1773, one of six children born to Dr. Joshua Porter (1730–1825) and Abigail Buell (1734–1797), who married in 1759 in Lebanon, Connecticut. His siblings were: Joshua Porter (1760–1831), Abigail Porter (1763–1797), Eunice Porter (1766–1848), Augustus Porter (1769–1849), Sally Porter (1776–1820). His father, Dr. Joshua Porter, a 1754 graduate of Yale, fought in the Revolutionary War as a colonel. He was at the head of his regiment in October 1777 when John Burgoyne surrendered his 6,000 men after the Battles of Saratoga. After the war, he was elected to various official positions for forty-eight consecutive years. His maternal grandparents were Peter and Martha Buell (née Grant) of Coventry, Connecticut.

He attended and graduated from Yale College in 1791, studied law in Litchfield, Connecticut with Judge Tapping Reeve, who also taught Aaron Burr and John C. Calhoun.

==Career==
In 1793, Porter was admitted to the bar, and commenced practice in Canandaigua, New York. From 1797 to 1804, he was Clerk of Ontario County, and was a member of the New York State Assembly (Ontario and Steuben Co.) in 1802. In the fall of 1809, Porter moved to Black Rock, New York, later part of Buffalo, and became a member of the firm of Porter, Barton &amp; Company with his brother Augustus, which controlled transportation on the Niagara River. The company portaged goods by land from Lake Erie to Lewiston on the Niagara River through Niagara Falls, then shipped them east on Lake Ontario.

===United States Congress===
In 1809, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Democratic-Republican. He served in the 11th and 12th United States Congresses, holding office from March 4, 1809, to March 3, 1813. During his service in Congress, he was a leading figure among Congressional &quot;war hawks&quot; and Chairman of the Committee that recommended preparation for war with Great Britain, and was known as an early supporter of James Madison. Porter, along with Henry Clay and others, pressured Madison to end the discussion and take up arms against England, in what became known as the War of 1812.

At the same time, from 1810 to 1816, he was a member of the Erie Canal Commission, a commission on inland navigation established in 1810 by the New York State Legislature to survey a canal route from the Hudson River to the Great Lakes. Porter served on the Commission with fellow Democratic-Republicans, Simeon De Witt and DeWitt Clinton. The Federalists on the Committee were Gouverneur Morris, William North, Thomas Eddy, and Stephen Van Rensselaer. In 1811, Porter and the Democratic-Republicans were joined by Robert R. Livingston and Robert Fulton. Charles D. Cooper joined in 1815.

===War of 1812===

While in Congress, Porter, realizing the level of America’s unpreparedness for war, pushed for greater numbers of soldiers and supplies. When his efforts fell on deaf ears, he instead offered his experience in trade to the military. Beginning in May 1812, he was served as assistant quartermaster general in the New York State Militia. As a brigadier general, he criticized General Alexander Smyth’s abortive operations against British Canada in 1813 at the Battle of Frenchman&#x27;s Creek, culminating in a bloodless duel between the two. The historian John R. Elting wrote of the duel, stating &quot;Unfortunately, both missed.&quot;

Porter later raised and commanded a brigade of New York militia that incorporated a Six Nations Indian contingent and led his command with distinction. He brokered a deal with Red Jacket, who agreed to provide 500 troops under Porter&#x27;s command. For his actions, he was presented a gold medal under joint resolution of Congress dated November 3, 1814 &quot;for gallantry and good conduct&quot; during the Battle of Chippewa, the Battle of Niagara, and the Siege of Fort Erie.

====Ambush at Black Rock====
A British raiding force of 240 troops including regulars and militia led by Lt. Col. Cecile Bishop attacked Black Rock, New York. The American militia numbering 150 men guarding the location fled. The British raiders spiked guns, burned structures, destroyed a schooner, and took many provisions. While this was going on, Peter B. Porter gathered at least 140 militiamen, a company of regulars, and at least 40 allied Seneca warriors. While the British raiding force was withdrawing back to their own lines. Porter’s force ambushed them. The 40 Seneca warriors who were concealed in a ravine rose above cover and gave the war-whoop while attacking the British by surprise while Porter’s other troops attacked from 3 different points. The British were caught off guard and confused by the sudden American attack. The British withdrew in confusion to their boats returning to their lines. The British suffered 3 killed, 24 wounded, and 17 captured. One of the British killed was Lt. Col. Cecile Bishop. The American ambushing force suffered only 3 killed and 6 wounded.

====Ambush at South of Chippawa====
Peter B. Porter was able to successfully negotiate an alliance with Red Jacket to assist the American armed forces in the Battle of Chippawa. Red Jacket conceived of a plan to maneuver his force of 300 Seneca warriors close enough to ambush the enemy force which consisted of British regulars, Canadian militia, and Mohawks. Peter B. Porter accompanied Red Jacket’s force with a force of his own numbering 250-300 men. Porter’s 250-300 man force consisted mostly of American militia and some U.S. regulars. Porter and Red Jacket headed with their combined force of 600 Senecas, militia, and regulars to ambush the British-allied force. Porter’s 600 man force moved stealthily into the woods, creeping off to the south. The Americans entered the natural cover of the massive forest to stay out of sight of the enemy. The Americans came close undetected to the enemy’s position. The Americans formed a formation of 3 arcs. Red Jacket’s Senecas were in the 2 front arcs while Porter’s men were in the third arc in the rear. Red Jacket’s Senecas all wore white-hankie hats so that Porter’s men could tell the difference between a British Mohawk Indian and a pro-American Seneca indian in the heat of battle. Once the Americans were in position enveloping the unsuspecting enemy. Each American aimed and leveled his gun at an enemy. The Americans sprang their ambush and opened heavy fire. The British-allied force was taken completely by surprise and many of them dropped dead. The Americans then charged in and engaged the enemy in close hand-to-hand combat. The Americans brutally killed many British, Canadian, and Mohawk as they were still so shocked and confused from the American ambush. The British and their allies retreated into the wilderness. Peter and his force pursued the enemy. However, the Americans ran into a fresh reserve of British regulars waiting in linear formation who fired a volley. Porter and his force retreated to safety as the British pursued them a short distance. After the battle of Chippawa ended between the main British army and the main American army, all British forces including the British main army withdrew temporarily. Porter and his men came back to their ambush site to police the scene to assess casualties of their force and of the enemy. There were at least 90 dead bodies of British, Canadian, and mohawks. There were only a dozen dead Americans on the field. The Senecas scalped all of the dead British, Canadian, and Mohawks. After that, Porter, Red Jacket, and their forces withdrew from the field.

====Battle of Lundy’s Lane====
Peter Porter took part in this battle. Porter reinforced Jacob Brown’s main position with his militia. Other American forces engaged the British in ferocious fighting. After a long battle, the Americans withdrew under Jacob Brown’s orders against Porter’s advice.

====Hit-and-run sortie at Fort Erie====
During the siege of Fort Erie, the British suffered heavy casualties after making costly infantry assaults on the American entrenched fort. The Americans who were deeply entrenched in their fort’s defenses suffered minor casualties. The American commander Jacob Brown then wanted to conduct hit-and-run sorties on the British to cause heavier casualties on the British, disable their artillery, and destroy the magazine supplies. Peter B. Porter was to conduct one sortie while James Miller was to lead the other. Peter B. Porter would lead a raiding sortie of militia and regulars while Miller would lead a raiding party of regulars. The American raiders would infiltrate British lines to conduct their mission. Porter secretly led his force traveling along a hidden road using the cover of the woods while Miller led his force secretly in a ravine. The American raiders struck by surprise and full ferocity. In the chaotic attack, the Americans destroyed 3 batteries of cannons, blew up the magazine, and inflicted heavy casualties on the British. Afterwards, all the American raiders withdrew back into the fort. The British suffered 115 killed, 178 wounded, and 316 missing. The American raiders led by Porter and Miller suffered 79 killed, 216 wounded, and 216 missing. Even though the American sorties completed their objectives, it was still costly in terms of casualties for the Americans. Some time later, the entire American force at fort erie would evacuate to Sackets Harbor.

===End of the War===
With the end of military operations, Porter went to Washington where he was given command of all American forces on the Niagara Frontier by President Madison. When news of a peace treaty arrived, he returned to civilian life and was declared a hero by his fellow citizens.

===New York politics and return to Congress===
From February 1815 to February 1816, he served as Secretary of State of New York as a Democratic-Republican under New York Governor Daniel D. Tompkins. He was also elected to the 14th United States Congress. Although his term in Congress began on March 4, 1815, the actual Session began only in December, and he took his seat on December 11, 1815. On January 23, 1816, he resigned, having been appointed a Commissioner under the Treaty of Ghent, which caused a controversy as to the constitutionality of sitting in Congress and holding this commissionership at the same time.

In 1817, his political friends of Tammany Hall printed ballots with his name and distributed them among their followers to vote for Porter for Governor of New York at the special election which was held after the resignation of Governor Daniel D. Tompkins. DeWitt Clinton, the otherwise unopposed candidate, was fiercely hated by the Tammany organization, and Porter received about 1,300 votes although he was not really running for the office. Porter became a regent of the University of the State of New York in 1824, and served in that capacity until 1830.

He was again a member of the State Assembly (Erie Co.) in 1828, but vacated his seat when he was appointed to the Cabinet.

===Secretary of War===
From May 16, 1828, to March 9, 1829, Porter served as U.S. Secretary of War under President John Quincy Adams, and was an advocate for the removal of Eastern Indians beyond the Mississippi. He moved to Niagara Falls in 1836 and was a presidential elector on the Whig ticket in 1840.

==Personal life==
In 1818, Porter married Letitia Breckinridge (1786–1831), the daughter of John Breckinridge (1760–1806), a U.S. Senator from Kentucky from 1801 to 1805, and Attorney General of the United States under Jefferson from 1805 to 1806. Her mother was Mary Hopkins Cabell, of the Cabell political family. Letitia was widowed from her first marriage in 1804, to Alfred William Grayson, who had died in 1810. Grayson, a graduate of Cambridge University, was the son of Senator William Grayson of Virginia. Through her first marriage, she had a son, John Breckinridge Grayson (1806–1862). Together, Peter and Letitia had:
*Peter Augustus Porter (1827–1864), who married Mary Cabell Breckenridge (1826–1854)
*Elizabeth Lewis Porter (1828–1876), who was rumored to have almost married Millard Fillmore, who later served as President of the United States from 1850 to 1853.

On March 20, 1844, General Porter died in Niagara Falls and was interred in Oakwood Cemetery, along with brother Augustus.

===Descendants===
His son, Peter A. Porter died in the bloody Battle of Cold Harbor during the American Civil War. His grandson was Peter Augustus Porter (1853–1925), a U.S. Representative from New York and his nephews were Augustus Seymour Porter, a United States Senator from Michigan, and Peter B. Porter, Jr., an Assemblyman and Speaker of the New York State Assembly.

===Slave ownership===
In 1820, Porter and his wife Letitia signed an affidavit attesting to the ownership of five enslaved Africans. Their names were recorded as John Caldwell, born 1800; Richard Caldwell, born 1810; Lannia Caldwell, born 1803; Mildred Caldwell, born 1806; and Betsy Gatewood, born 1815. This affidavit appears in the Buffalo Town Proceedings, p. 93, in the collection of the Buffalo History Museum.

===Legacy===
Fort Porter, Porter Avenue in Buffalo, Porter Road (NY 182) in Niagara Falls, and the town of Porter in Niagara County are all named in honor of Gen. Porter. Porter&#x27;s letters and papers survive in the library collections of the Buffalo History Museum.

Porter Hall at Buffalo State College was named after Gen. Porter in 1980 but changed to Bengal Hall in July 2020 due to Porter&#x27;s slave ownership. Similarly, Porter Quadrangle within the Ellicott Complex at the University at Buffalo was named after Porter in 1974 but his name was removed in August 2020 due to Porter&#x27;s slave ownership.

In 1834, a paddle steamer named the &quot;General Porter&quot; was launched, on Lake Erie. 
She sailed out of Buffalo, New York, until 1838, when she was sold to the Royal Navy, which renamed her HMS &quot;Toronto&quot;. The Royal Navy employed her patrolling Lake Erie, the St Clair River, and the upper Niagara River.

<text>Rodney Robert Porter (8 October 1917 – 6 September 1985) was a British biochemist and Nobel laureate.

==Education and early life==
He was born in Newton-le-Willows, Lancashire, England, the son of Joseph Lawrence Porter, chief clerk of the Railway Carriage and Wagon Works in Earlestown (Newton-le-Willows), and his wife, Isabel May Reese. He was educated at Ashton-in-Makerfield Grammar School.

Rodney Robert Porter received his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Liverpool in 1939 for Biochemistry.

His career was interrupted by World War II during which he served as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Royal Engineers serving in Sicily and North Africa. In 1944 he was promoted to Major and transferred to the Royal Army Service Corps acting as a War Department analyst, based in Naples in Italy.

After the war he moved to the University of Cambridge where he became Fred Sanger&#x27;s first PhD student. He was awarded his doctorate (PhD) in 1948.

==Career and research==
Porter worked for the National Institute for Medical Research for eleven years (1949–1960) before joining St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital Medical School, Imperial College London and becoming the Pfizer Professor of Immunology. In 1967 he was appointed Whitley Professor of Biochemistry at the University of Oxford, and Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford. His colleague Elizabeth Press (Betty Press) worked with him at NIMR, St Mary&#x27;s and at Oxford contributing extensively to the work which led to the Nobel Prize.

==Awards and honours==
Porter was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1964. He won the Gairdner Foundation International Award in 1966. In 1972, Porter shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Gerald M. Edelman for determining the chemical structure of an antibody. Using the enzyme papain, he broke the blood&#x27;s immunoglobin into fragments, making them easier to study. He also looked into how the blood&#x27;s immunoglobins react with cellular surfaces.
He subsequently worked with colleagues Kenneth BM Reid, Robert Sim and Duncan Campbell on developing understanding of the Complement Proteins associated with defence against infection.

In 1991, Raymond Dwek founded the Oxford Glycobiology Institute at the Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford and this building was named after Porter as the Rodney Porter building. The department organises the Rodney Porter Memorial Lecture every year.

==Family==

In 1948 he married Julia New. They had five children together.

==Death==
Porter died following a four-car accident on 6 September 1985, near 
Beacon Hill, Surrey, near Guildford, as the driver of one of the cars. Julia was only slightly injured in the accident. They had been en route to France for a holiday, just prior to his formal retirement.

<text>The Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church (ARPC) is a theologically conservative denomination in North America. The ARPC was formed by the merger of the Associate Presbytery (seceder) with the Reformed Presbytery (covenanter) in 1782. It is one of the oldest conservative denominations in the United States.

==History==
After the Westminster Confession was signed by its drafters in 1643, some of the &quot;Covenanters&quot;, a Presbyterian group, left the Church of Scotland for the New World to avoid signing an oath to the monarch. These early believers seceded from the Church of Scotland over doctrinal differences. Some ministers stayed in the Church of Scotland to work out their differences.

By 1739, a Scottish Presbyterian pastor Ebenezer Erskine led a group of ministers to leave the Church of Scotland who formed a separate group, the Seceders, which again opposed the main group and had doctrinal differences. Ebenezer Erskine and his brother Ralph Erskine preached sermons that later became the inspiration for the Associate Reformed Church in the American colonies. The monarch moved some of Ebenezer Erskine&#x27;s followers to the northern Irish province of Ulster to quell religious disputes among Catholics and Protestants. These Ulster Scots Seceders and the Catholics continued to battle and some of the Scots Irish later emigrated to the American colonies with Seceder ministers from Scotland in the mid-1700s. They settled with the Covenanters in Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.

Some churches of the Covenanter tradition and the Seceder tradition came together officially in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1782. The Synod of the South was formed consisting of churches in North and South Carolina and Georgia in 1803 and still another in Texas. Each tradition put aside doctrinal differences to come together as long as oath-signing to a central government could be avoided. For decades, the Associate Reformed Church denounced slavery; however, in 1831, the church passed a resolution that members must free their slaves immediately or be denied communion. This led to a severance of churches in the Southern Synod--particularly in the Carolina presbytery--from the Northern Synod. In 1858, the Northern Synod of the Associate Reformed Church merged with the Associate Presbyterians to form the United Presbyterian Church of North America.

===Southern synod===
The Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church of today traces its roots to the Synod of the South, formed in 1803. Almost immediately after forming the Synod of the South, the ministers looked into forming a seminary closer to home for the education of the ministry and the growth of the church. Many of the ministers were traveling for more than thirty days on horseback to attend Synod meetings in the North. While they were gone, the churches and the congregations suffered in their absence. The solution they agreed to work towards was an academy called the Clarke and Erskine Seminary, which later became known as Erskine College and Seminary.

===Western synod===
While the larger Presbyterian Church was a mix of Scottish and English Presbyterians, several smaller Presbyterian groups were almost entirely Scottish Seceders, and they displayed the process of assimilation into the broader American religious culture. Fisk (1968) traces the history of the Associate Reformed Church in the Old Northwest from its formation by a union of Associate and Reformed Presbyterians in 1782 to the merger of this body with the Seceder bodies to form the United Presbyterian Church in 1858. It became the Associate Reformed Synod of the West and remained centered in the Midwest. It withdrew from the parent body in 1820 because of Confessional disagreements regarding the administration of sacraments.

The Associate Reformed Synod of the West maintained the characteristics of an immigrant church with Scottish roots, emphasized the Westminster Standards, used only the Psalms in public worship, was Sabbatarian and was strongly abolitionist and anti-Catholic. In the 1850s however, it exhibited evidence of assimilation. It showed greater ecumenical interest, greater interest in the evangelization of the West and of the cities, and a declining interest in maintaining the unique characteristics of its Scotch-Irish past.

==The ARPC today==

In 2018, the ARPC had 22,459 members in 264 churches. The denominational office is located in Greenville, South Carolina. Also, the denomination operates a conference center, Bonclarken, in Flat Rock, North Carolina. The conference center is surrounded by private property, many of whose owners trace their ARP roots to the beginnings of the denomination. Membership in the ARP Church is concentrated in the Southeastern United States, especially North Carolina and South Carolina. There are also numerous congregations in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Virginia. The ARPC has churches in Canada and in most states of the United States. There are separate synods in Mexico and Pakistan. The ARP Church was among the first to send missionaries to China as early as 1880. The ARP Church sponsors missionaries internationally through World Witness.

The ARP Church is affiliated with the North American Presbyterian and Reformed Council and shares a common theology with other conservative Presbyterian denominations. It holds to the infallibility and inerrancy of the Bible. The church does not ordain women as ministers or elders, though it does permit local sessions to determine whether to ordain female deacons. Having been originally formed by a merger of two denominations holding to exclusive psalmody, this was the practice of the ARP Church until 1946, when its synod allowed the use of hymns other than the Psalms; each congregational session has right of discretion concerning the matter of music in worship. At the 207th General Synod, a new ARP psalter was approved for use in the denomination to encourage the increased use of Psalm singing in public worship.

In 1837 the church established an academy for men in Due West, S.C., which in 1839 became Erskine College, the first four-year church-related college in that state.

Erskine Theological Seminary, established as Clarke and Erskine Seminary in 1837, is the professional school of Erskine College; it was incorporated into Erskine College when the latter was founded two years later. The Seminary became a separate but associated school in 1858 and was reincorporated into the College in 1925. Erskine merged with the Due West Female College in the first decade of the 20th century. Erskine became the first private denominational school in South Carolina to allow women instructors at that time. Since its inception, Erskine has provided training for students of the ARPC and of other denominations. Recent years, however, have witnessed ARP ministers graduating from other seminaries.

== Basic beliefs ==

Along with other Presbyterian churches, the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church uses the Westminster Confession of Faith, the Larger Catechism and the Shorter Catechism as subordinate standards. In its 1990 &quot;Purpose Statement&quot;, the church declared that &quot;we express our desire to continue to be a Presbyterian and Reformed church, committed to the Lordship of Jesus Christ and to the Bible as the Word of God.&quot; It listed some of its core commitments as:

* The worship of the Triune God.
* The Holy Scriptures as the basis for our faith and activity.
* Unity with other believers in Christ.
* Total stewardship of life, including tithing of time, talents, and money.
* Loving and caring for one another and for other people.
* Excellence in education and equipping leaders for tomorrow.
* Spreading the Gospel to all parts of the world.
* Evaluating and changing church structures and priorities to meet the challenges of the future while preserving the best of the past.

The ARPC takes a conservative view of the Bible, stating that &quot;the Bible alone, being God-breathed, is the Word of God written, infallible in all that it teaches, and inerrant in the original manuscripts.&quot; The Holy Spirit reveals through the text that &quot;God the Father gave His Son to save us from our sins.&quot;

== Interchurch organizations ==
The Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church is a member of the World Reformed Fellowship, and the North American Presbyterian and Reformed Council. Membership in the International Conference of Reformed Churches was dropped in June 2011.

== Stances regarding social issues==

The ARPC designates the Sunday nearest to January 22 as &quot;Sanctity of Human Life Sunday,&quot; encouraging non-violent opposition to legalized abortion. In addition, the denomination officially calls homosexuals &quot;to repentance, cleansing, and deliverance in the saving power of Jesus Christ.&quot;

==Members and ministers==
Evangelist Billy Graham attended the Chalmers Memorial ARP Church in Charlotte, North Carolina, as a child; his parents were members of the congregation. Graham was later ordained as a Southern Baptist minister.

The noted Southern writer Erskine Caldwell was the son of an ARP minister in Georgia.

Noted ARP ministers of today and the recent past include Jay E. Adams, Sinclair Ferguson, Derek Thomas, Michael A. Milton, and Frank Reich.

<doc id="764998" wikidata="Q27927" url="?curid=764998" title="Äynu language">
<text>Äynu (also known as Abdal) is an Turkic cryptolect spoken in Western China. It is spoken by the Äynu, a nomadic people, who use it to keep their communications secret from outsiders.

The grammar of Äynu is mostly Turkic, essentially Uyghur, while its vocabulary is mainly derived from Persian and other Iranian languages. Some linguists call it a mixed language, but other linguists argue that it does not meet the technical requirements of a mixed language.

== Name ==
The language is known by many different spellings, including Abdal, Aini, Ainu, Ayni, Aynu, Eyni and Eynu. The &quot;Abdal&quot; (ئابدال) spelling is commonly used in Uyghur sources. Russian sources use &quot;Eynu&quot;, &quot;Aynu&quot;, &quot;Abdal&quot; (, , ) and Chinese uses the spelling &quot;Ainu&quot; (). The Äynu people call their language Äynú (ئەينۇ, ).

==Geographic distribution==
Äynu is spoken in Western China among Alevi Muslims in Xinjiang on the edge of the Taklimakan Desert in the Tarim Basin.

Similarly mixed varieties of Turkic and Persian are spoken in other locations including Turkey and Uzbekistan. The speakers of these varieties are also referred to as &quot;Abdal&quot;.

==Use as a secret language==
The only speakers of Äynu are adult men, who are found to speak it outside of their area of settlement in order to communicate without being understood by others. Uyghur is spoken with outsiders who do not speak Äynu and at home when it is not necessary to disguise one&#x27;s speech.

==Vocabulary==
Most of basic vocabulary in Äynu comes from the Iranian languages, which might be speculated that the language have been originally an Iranian language and have been turned into a Turkic language after a long period. There are three vocabulary formation methods in the Äynu language: simple words, derived words, and compound words. The affixes of derived words have both Uyghur and Persian origin. Old people mostly use Persian affixes, while the young people use Uyghur derived vocabulary and affixes.

==Phonology==

// is a palatal consonant. Phonemes on the left of a cell are voiceless, while those on the right are voiced.

==Orthography==
Due to Äynu&#x27;s secretive nature, along with a lack of official status in areas which it is spoken in, it does not have any widely used writing system. However, the Uyghur Arabic alphabet is typically used in the occasion where it needs to be written.

==Numerals==
Äynu numerals are completely Persian. However, ordinal adjectives are made by adding Uyghur -(I)ncI suffix.

<text>Moordorf is an East Frisian village in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is both the highest and most densely populated &quot;Ortsteil&quot; of the municipality of Südbrookmerland, in the district of Aurich. Originally, Moordorf was a linear village but developed into a dispersed settlement due to the designation of new building areas.

Moordorf was an independent municipality until it was incorporated into the municipality of Südbrookmerland on 1 July 1972.

Moordorf&#x27;s most notable feature is Moormuseum Moordorf, a museum depicting what life was like in the small huts on the East Frisian moors.

==Etymology==
Initially, the place was called &quot;Kolonie am Schwarzen Weg&quot;. From 1771 onwards, the name &quot;Mohrdorff&quot;, later &quot;Moordorf&quot;, prevailed. The origin of the name (which translates to English as &quot;moor village&quot;) is sufficiently explained by its location in the moorland.

== Politics ==
After World War II, Moordorf was a stronghold of the SPD. In the first elections of 1949, the SPD received 30% of the votes. By 1990, the SPD received 70% of the vote. Currently, the mayor of Moordorf (&quot;Ortsvorsteher&quot;) is Stefan Kleinert (SPD).

He was a member of the Sejm from 2001 to 2007 and the chairman of the League of Polish Families party and, in 1989, founder of the Polish nationalist and far-right organization All-Polish Youth.

Since 2007, he has run his law firm in Warsaw, representing clients in various high-profile cases. He is a member of the Sejm again, effectively for KO, since late 2023.

== Early life ==
Born in Śrem, Roman Giertych comes from a family of Polish politicians, a son of Maciej Giertych and a grandson of Jędrzej Giertych. His uncle on his father&#x27;s side is Wojciech Giertych, O.P., Theologian of the Pontifical Household and professor of theology at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot; in Rome. Two of his aunts also entered religious life.

He spent his entire early life in Kórnik, where he finished both primary and secondary school. He graduated from Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań, with Master&#x27;s degrees in History (1989-1994) and Law (1990-1995). Following this, he completed his advocate apprenticeship in Warsaw in the year 2000. His apprenticeship supervisor was Polish advocate, Zdzisław Krzemiński, an expert in family and civil law and a supporter of Endecja.

==Political career==
Giertych and the LPR had a strong national and anti-EU profile. Prior to the 2003 Polish referendum on EU membership, the LPR campaigned against it, denouncing it as a &quot;centralised, socialist superstate&quot;. Officially, the LPR declares that it favours a &quot;Europe of nations&quot;. Under Giertych&#x27;s leadership, the LPR was successful in the European Parliament elections in June 2004, temporarily becoming the second-strongest Polish party with 14% of the votes. His father Maciej Giertych was elected MEP. In the 2005 parliamentary elections, LPR gained 8% of the votes.

In July 2004, Giertych was elected a member and vice-chairman of PKN Orlen investigation commission, which is credited, among other things, with destroying the presidential aspirations of Włodzimierz Cimoszewicz.

===Minister of Education===
On 5 May 2006, Giertych was appointed minister of education and vice-premier, while the LPR joined a governmental coalition with PiS. His nomination was largely controversial because of his nationalist and authoritarian views. The following day, about 100 people protested in front of the Ministry of Education against this appointment. A couple of weeks, later almost 140 000 people signed a petition to remove him from the post.

In March 2007 Giertych proposed a bill that would ban homosexual people from the teaching profession and would also allow dismiss from employment those teachers who promote &quot;the culture of homosexual lifestyle&quot;.

=== Later activity ===
The PiS-led coalition collapsed in mid-2007, triggering strife between the former partners. After losses in the elections of late 2007, Giertych stood down as leader of the LPR and left the party in 2009, which had already been deserted by most adherents such as Krzysztof Bosak and Robert Winnicki. Giertych became an active opponent of former coalition partner PiS. He declared numerous times to vote for PO, co-founded several political initiatives and established himself as a busy investigator of embezzlement charges against PiS cadre, while he is perceived critically in parts of the liberal public. Although Giertych changed party allegiance, he largely remains a proponent of right-wing politics, as is seen in his stance on abortion. He announced his intention to run for the Polish Senate in the 2023 Polish election, but he decided against it after the left-wing Nowa Lewica strongly opposed to him. Instead, he has been offered to be a candidate for the Polish Sejm in 2023, on KO&#x27;s lists, which he accepted. Since autumn 2023, he is a member of the Sejm following the 2023 Polish parliamentary election from the list of Civic Coalition. In January 2024, he was chosen to be deputy chairman of an investigation committee of the Civic Coalition parliament faction.

==Legal career and legal issues==
After leaving parliament in 2007, Giertych returned to legal practice. His legal practice was perceived as a way to keep in touch with politics, for he mostly served public figures in cases with high media attention. He represented entrepreneur Ryszard Krauze, accused of dealing with a gang, in a trial in which the claim was allowed in the first instance, consequently ordering Telewizja Polska (Polish Television) and Anita Gargas to apologize to the entrepreneur. He was also the attorney of Radosław Sikorski regarding offensive comments made on the internet forum of the weekly Wprost website.

Giertych was involved in helping the Jewish community of Góra Kalwaria to reclaim and restore a local synagogue. He was the lawyer of the then head of the European Council, Donald Tusk, in an inquiry into the cooperation of Polish services with the Russian FSB. He also represented the Tusk&#x27;s family. He was Michał Tusk&#x27;s attorney in his successful case against yellow press daily Fakt, as well as in a case concering damage to property. Giertych was also Katarzyna Tusk&#x27;s attorney in a trial, resulting in an apology of Fakt. He represented Donald Tusk in cases before prosecutors, the Amber Gold Investigation Committee and the VAT Investigation Committee.

Giertych also represented Austrian businessman Gerald Birgfellner in a case against the development company &quot;Srebrna&quot; (&quot;Silver&quot;) and an affiliated dispute with Jarosław Kaczyński, as well as Leszek Czarnecki in two cases.

In 2009, Giertych himself won a lawsuit brought against the publisher of the Fakt for the protection of personal rights. In 2017, he won a case before the Supreme Court concerning the liability of website publishers for user comments.

The deputy prosecutor general Bogdan Święczkowski filed a motion against Giertych to the bar&#x27;s disciplinary court to punish him for criticism he had expressed towards Zbigniew Ziobro and the prosecutor&#x27;s office in late 2016. Giertych stated that this procedure had been motivated politically. In 2020, it was dismissed.

=== Polnord trial ===
On 15 October 2020, Giertych was detained on accusations of money laundering. He, together with 12 other suspects, was accused to have trepanned 92 Mio. Złoty via fictitious obligations in 2014 out of real estate company Polnord, a former key player on the Polish market. The operation was represented to have benefited, among others, then-shareholder Ryszard Krauze, a fellow suspect and legal client of Giertych, who is a former billionaire struggling with bankruptcy since about 2010.

On 20 July 2020, the European Commission mirrored a statement of the Polish National Bar Council indicating that defense lawyers acting in politically sensitive cases were intensively screened by the authorities. Giertych, together with fellow lawyers Jacek Dubois and Mikołaj Pietrzak, filed a complaint against Zbigniew Ziobro and his deputy to the International Criminal Court in The Hague.

In late December 2021, Associated Press revealed that according to Canadian NGO Citizen Lab, the phone Giertych used in 2019 was infected by the Pegasus spy tool. In February 2022, Giertych spoke at a public hearing in the European Parliament about, among other things, the abuse of Pegasus in Poland.

On 29 March 2022, the Court did not consent to the temporary arrest demanded by the prosecutors due to alleged high probability of guilt. On 29 April 2022, the Regional Court in Lublin upheld the decision of a lower instance.

In June 2022, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe urged the European Commission to take a firm stance against the repression of political dissidents, as whom it identified Giertych. In July 2022, the European Commission published a report on the state of the rule of law in Poland that agreed with the aforementioned opinion.

Before the fall elections of 2023, Giertych largely stayed in Italy, where he owns a mansion. Critics argued that he was evading subpoena while staying abroad. He campaigned remotely and reappeared in public during the swearing-in ceremony. In January 2025 the Regional Prosecutor&#x27;s Office in Lublin announced the discontinuation of the investigation concerning Giertych, while 8 out of 12 other suspects still await trial.

<text>The Cahuilla, also known as ʔívil̃uqaletem or Ivilyuqaletem, are a Native American people of the various tribes of the Cahuilla Nation, living in the inland areas of southern California. Their original territory encompassed about . The traditional Cahuilla territory was near the geographic center of Southern California. It was bounded to the north by the San Bernardino Mountains, to the south by Borrego Springs and the Chocolate Mountains, to the east by the Colorado Desert, and to the west by the San Jacinto Plain and the eastern slopes of the Palomar Mountains.

==Language and name==
The Cahuilla language is in the Uto-Aztecan family. A 1990 census revealed 35 speakers in an ethnic population of 800. It is critically endangered, since most speakers are middle-aged or older. In their language, their autonym is ʔívil̃uqaletem, and the name of their language is ʔívil̃uʔat (Ivilyuat), but they also call themselves táxliswet, meaning &quot;person&quot;. &quot;Cahuilla&quot; is an exonym applied to the group after mission secularization in the Ranchos of California. The word &quot;Cahuilla&quot; is probably from the Ivilyuat word &quot;kawiʔa&quot;, meaning &quot;master.&quot;

==Prehistory==

Oral legends suggest that when the Cahuilla first moved into the Coachella Valley, a large body of water that geographers call Lake Cahuilla existed. Fed by the Colorado River, it dried up sometime before 1700, after one of the repeated shifts in the river&#x27;s course. In 1905 a break in a levee created the much smaller Salton Sea in the same location.

The Cahuilla lived off the land by using native plants. A notable tree whose fruits they harvested is the California fan palm. The Cahuilla also used palm leaves for basketry of many shapes, sizes, and purposes; sandals; and roofing thatch for dwellings. They lived in smaller groups than some other tribes.

==History==
The Cahuilla&#x27;s first encounter with Europeans was in 1774, when Juan Bautista de Anza was looking for a trade route between Sonora and Monterey in Alta California. Living far inland, the Cahuilla had little contact with Spanish soldiers, priests, or missionaries. Many European settlers and tradespeople viewed the desert as of little or no value and to be avoided. The Cahuilla learned of Spanish missions and their culture from Indians living close to missions in San Gabriel and San Diego. The Cahuilla provided security against the raids of the tribes from the desert and mountains on its herds for the vaqueros who worked for the owners of the Rancho San Bernardino.

The Cahuilla did not encounter Anglo-Americans until the 1840s. Chief Juan Antonio, leader of the Cahuilla Mountain Band, gave traveler Daniel Sexton access to areas near the San Gorgonio Pass in 1842. The Mountain Band also lent support to a U.S. Army expedition led by Lieutenant Edward Fitzgerald Beale, defending it against attacks by &quot;Wakara&quot; and his band of Ute warriors.

During the Mexican–American War, Juan Antonio led his warriors to join Californios led by José del Carmen Lugo in attacking their traditional enemy, the Luiseño. Lugo led this action in retaliation for the Pauma Massacre, in which the Luiseno had killed 11 Californios. The combined forces staged an ambush and killed 33–40 Luiseno warriors, an event that became known as the Temecula Massacre of 1847. (Historians disagree on the exact number of deaths; Luiseno oral tradition holds that more than 100 warriors were killed.) In the treaty ending the war with Mexico, the US promised to honor Mexican land grants and policies. These included recognition of Native American rights to inhabit certain lands, but European-American encroachment on Indian lands became an increasing problem after the US annexed California.

During the 1850s, the Cahuilla came under increasing pressure from waves of European-American migrants because of the California Gold Rush. In 1851, Juan Antonio led his warriors in the destruction of the Irving Gang, a group of bandits that had been looting the San Bernardino Valley. After the outcome of the Irving Gang incident, in late 1851, Juan Antonio, his warriors and their families, moved eastward from Politana toward the San Gorgonio Pass and settled in a valley that branched off to the northeast from San Timoteo Canyon, at a village named Saahatpa.

In addition to the influx of Anglo-American miners, ranchers and outlaws, and groups of Mormon colonists, the Cahuilla came into conflict with the neighboring Cupeño tribe to the west. In November 1851, the Garra Revolt occurred, wherein the Cupeno leader Antonio Garra attempted to bring Juan Antonio into his revolt. Juan Antonio, friendly to the Americans, was instrumental in capturing Garra, ending that revolt.

When the California Senate refused to ratify an 1852 treaty granting the Cahuilla control of their land, some tribal leaders resorted to attacks on approaching settlers and soldiers. Juan Antonio did not participate in this as long as he lived.

To encourage the railroad, the U.S. government subdivided the lands into one-mile-square sections, giving the Indians every other section. In 1877 the government established reservation boundaries, which left the Cahuilla with only a small portion of their traditional territories.

The Cahuilla have intermarried with non-Cahuilla for the past century. A high proportion of today&#x27;s Cahuilla tribal members have mixed ancestry, especially Spanish and African American. People who have grown up in the tribe&#x27;s ways and identify culturally with the Cahuilla may qualify for official tribal membership by the tribe&#x27;s internal rules. Each federally recognized tribe sets its own rules for membership.

==Current status==
Today Palm Springs and the surrounding areas are experiencing rapid development. The Agua Caliente Band of the Cahuilla is an important player in the local economy, operating an array of business enterprises, including land leasing, hotel and casino operations, and banking.

The Agua Caliente Indian Reservation occupies in the Palm Springs area, including parts of the cities of Palm Springs, Cathedral City, and Rancho Mirage. The total population living on its territory was 21,358 as of the 2000 census, although few of these are registered tribal members.

The Morongo Band of Mission Indians, also considered part of the Cahuilla nation, operates the Morongo Casino, Resort &amp; Spa, as well as the Hadley Fruit Orchards in Cabazon. The Morongo Casino is one of the largest Indian casinos in the United States. The Morongo Indian Reservation is in northern Riverside County. The city of Banning and community of Cabazon both extend partially onto reservation land. The reservation has a land area of , with a resident population of 954, the majority of Native American heritage.

Smaller bands of Cahuilla are in Southern California: the Augustine Band in Coachella (their village was &quot;La Mesa&quot; in the 1880s-90s); the Cabazon Band in Indio (their one-square-mile reservation now &quot;Sonora-Lupine Lanes&quot; in Old Town Indio); the Cabazon Reservations in Indio, Coachella, and Mecca (separate from Cabazon band); the Cahuilla Band in Anza; the Los Coyotes Band in Warner Springs (San Diego County); the Ramona Indian Reservation in Pine Meadow; Santa Rosa Indian Reservation in Pinyon; the Twentynine Palms Band in Twentynine Palms, Indio, and Coachella (&quot;Dates Lane&quot; community); the Torres-Martinez Band in La Quinta (was &quot;Rancho Santa Carmelita&quot; in Spanish-Mexican-1850s California times), Coachella, Thermal, Mecca, and Oasis; and the Mission Creek Reservation in Desert Hot Springs.

The Torres-Martinez tribe has offices throughout Southern California, offering TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) benefits for members. They are in Imperial Valley (El Centro), Blythe, Riverside, San Bernardino, Victorville, Palmdale, San Diego, Orange County (Santa Ana), Pomona, and Los Angeles. This is a result of Cahuilla migration to farming and factory jobs in the second half of the 20th century.

Extinct Cahuilla tribes (known as the Las Palmas band of Cahuilla-part of &quot;Western Cahuilla&quot;) in the early 20th century resided in the Palm Desert area (between Thousand Palms, Cathedral City and La Quinta). This was before land developers and US Armed Forces purchased what was tribal land from the Montoya family—part of the &quot;Desert Cahuilla&quot; in present-day Indian Wells, and from the San Cayetano band—part of &quot;Desert Cahuilla&quot; in &quot;Rancho San Cayetano&quot; during the Spanish-Mexican-1850s California period (now the city of Rancho Mirage). The number of these tribes&#x27; descendants is unknown. The Montoya family, who claim partial Cahuilla descent, are influential in local economics and city politics. 

The ethnic composition of the Cahuilla descendants is like that of many other Americans: mixed with European (especially Anglo/Irish-American and Spanish), African American, Asian-American (from historic interaction with Chinese railroad workers and Filipino farm laborers), and other tribal groups, mainly Apache migrant workers from Arizona. Some Cahuilla families continue to intermarry with local populations; others try to marry within Native American tribes.

To recognize Cahuilla history and cultural heritage, the University of California, Riverside, located on historically Cahuilla land, has created a land acknowledgment mentioning the Cahuilla and other local Indigenous peoples.

==Federally recognized tribes==
Anthropologists have historically divided the Cahuilla into &quot;Mountain,&quot; &quot;Desert,&quot; and &quot;(San Gorgonio) Pass&quot; or &quot;Western&quot; groups. Today, there are nine Southern California reservations that are acknowledged homes to bands of Cahuilla. These are in Imperial, Riverside, and San Diego Counties and are the territory of federally recognized tribes.
The Cahuilla bands (sometimes called &quot;villages&quot;) are:

&quot;Pass&quot; Cahuilla or &quot;Western&quot; Cahuilla (on San Gorgonio Pass, centering in Palm Springs and Palm Desert in Coachella Valley, wandering north to Desert Hot Springs)

<text>Maciej Marian Giertych (, born 24 March 1936 in Warsaw) is a Polish dendrologist and social conservative politician of the League of Polish Families (LPR). He favours state intervention in the economy. He was a member of the Sejm (between 2001 and 2004) and a Polish member of the European Parliament (from 2004 to 2009). He was a candidate in the 2005 Polish presidential elections, but withdrew from the race because of low vote results (circa 3%). He is a notable creationist and has stated that he opposes the theory of evolution as a scientist, a geneticist, and not on religious grounds.

==Biography==

Maciej Giertych was born on 24 March 1936 in Warsaw, the son of notable writer politician of the nationalist National Democracy movement Jędrzej Giertych and his wife Maria. Giertych was one of nine children, including his brother Wojciech Giertych, O.P., Theologian of the Papal Household and professor of theology at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot; in Rome. Two of his sisters also entered religious life.

In late 1945 his family left Poland for post-war Germany&#x27;s British zone and finally settled in the United Kingdom. In 1954 Giertych passed his final school exams and entered Oxford University, where he founded the Polish Students Club during his studies. He received the BA and MA in forestry. Between 1958 and 1962 he studied at the University of Toronto, where he received his PhD for studies on tree physiology.

In 1962, Giertych returned to Poland, where he completed his qualifications for an assistant professorship at the Institute of Dendrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN) in Kórnik near Poznań. In 1964 he married Antonina Giertych, née Jachnik. In 1970, he received his Habilitation degree for his studies on forest genetics at the Agricultural University of Poznań. Since 1976, he has lectured at the Nicolaus Copernicus University of Toruń. He has also published more than 200 works and studies, mostly on forest-related topics. The same year he became a member of the Forest Sciences Committee of the PAN. In 1981 he received the grade of &quot;associate professor&quot; and in November 1989 of full professor.

In 1986, Giertych joined the advisory council (Rada Konsultacyjna), made up of opposition members and party officials set up by the leader of the communist authorities, Wojciech Jaruzelski. He continuously showed his support for General Jaruzelski, and supported the alliance between Poland and the Soviet Union. The council included several prominent Poles such as Marek Kotański, Krzysztof Skubiszewski and Kazimierz Dejmek, but also leading members of the communist party. He also served as the Polish representative to the International Union of Forest Research Organisations from 1986 to 1995.

After the fall of the communist regime in Poland in 1990, Giertych continued his scientific work; between 1993 and 2000 he was an advisor to the Ministry of Environmental Affairs. In 1990 he was a member of one of the minor political parties, the National Party of Poland (&quot;Stronnictwo Narodowe&quot;). Most of its members eventually entered the League of Polish Families (LPR) and dissolved the National Party.

On 23 September 2001 Giertych was elected to the Polish Parliament from a Poznań constituency. On 16 June 2004 he became a Member of the European Parliament for the LPR. Together with the rest of his party he sits as a Non-attached Member.
Giertych comes from a prominent family of Polish nationalist politicians: he is the grandson of Franciszek Giertych and son of Jędrzej Giertych, and father of Roman Giertych, who led the LPR in the past.

==Political views==

Maciej Giertych opposed lifting the ban on purchase of land in Poland by foreigners (due to fears of resurgence of German colonialism), homosexuality and moral relativism. He criticized and opposed Poland&#x27;s entry into the European Union. He has supported closer ties with Eastern European countries (especially Russia), as well as defending Polish industry against what he regards as the unfair practices of western companies. He is also against the proposed European Constitution. In general, the views of Maciej Giertych are in line with the ideology of Radio Maryja, a media group and political-religious channel of religiously conservative parties in Poland. However, since 2014 and take over by Law and Justice, he deeply opposes it.

During his discourse Giertych had explicitly condemned National Socialism and insisted Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler also had an &quot;atheistic and socialistic taste about them&quot;. He praised Francisco Franco, António Salazar and Éamon de Valera, as guardsmen of traditional European values, in the same address to the European Parliament.

In February 2007, Giertych sparked outrage among European Union officials and Jewish organizations by publishing a brochure called &quot;Civilisations at war in Europe&quot; that claimed Jews create their own &quot;ghettos&quot; because they supposedly prefer to separate themselves from others. A number of journalists and certain Jewish organizations considered the brochure to be anti-Semitic.

During the European Parliament&#x27;s session on 14 March 2007, Parliament&#x27;s President Hans-Gert Pöttering reprimanded Maciej Giertych for the content of his pamphlet in accordance with Rule 147 of the EP&#x27;s Rules of Procedure. He said that the publication was &quot;a serious breach of fundamental rights and, in particular, the dignity of human beings to which our institution so strongly adheres&quot;. Pöttering dissociated the Parliament from the work saying that it had made no financial contribution to its publication. Several members of the Parliament have joined with the European Jewish Congress in calling for an investigation of the publishing of the pamphlet and whether Parliament funds were involved.

== Creationist views==

Giertych supports a version of creationism that attributes the creation of the universe, life, and its further development to an act of God&#x27;s will. He is an honorary member of the Daylight Origins Society, a creationist organisation based in the United Kingdom.

In his foreword to Gerard Keane&#x27;s 1999 book &quot;Creation Rediscovered&quot;, Giertych documented how his views changed from assuming evolution is true to being skeptical of it.

In 2006, Giertych rebutted the accusation that he advocated teaching creationism in schools. He stated, &quot;I am a scientist — a population geneticist with a degree from Oxford University and a PhD from the University of Toronto — and I am critical of the theory of evolution as a scientist, with no religious connotation.&quot;

On 11 October 2006 Giertych introduced and moderated a pro-creationist seminar held in Brussels for members of the European Parliament; The title of the presentation was &quot;Teaching evolutionary theory in Europe. Is your child being indoctrinated in the classroom?&quot;

In 2008, Giertych appeared in Ben Stein&#x27;s movie &quot;&quot; (credited as &quot;Marciej&quot; Giertych). The documentary features Giertych talking about his views on the theory of evolution.

<text>Count Heinrich von Bellegarde, Viceroy of Lombardy-Venetia ( or sometimes &quot;Heinrich von Bellegarde&quot;; 29 August 1756 – 22 July 1845), of a noble Savoyard family, was born in Saxony, joined the Saxon army and later entered Habsburg military service, where he became a general officer serving in the Habsburg border wars, the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. He became a &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; and statesman.

==Early career==
Born in Dresden in the Electorate of Saxony on 29 August 1756, his family stemmed from an old line of Savoyards. His father was the Saxon General Johann Franz von Bellegarde (named count in 1741) and his mother was &quot;Frau Reichsgräfin&quot; Maria Antonia von Hartig. Bellegarde first served in the Saxon army, receiving a commission as a &quot;Fähnrich&quot; (ensign) in the Infantry Regiment Bork; later as a lieutenant in the Queen&#x27;s regiment. Transferring his services to Austria in 1771, Bellegarde and distinguished himself leading the dragoon regiment &quot;Zweibrück&quot; in the War of the Bavarian Succession. In 1781, Joseph II named him major of the Savoy dragoons, and four years later he was colonel of the Dragoon Regiment &quot;Berlichingen&quot;.

At Batajnica (in German sources called Bexania), a village on the outskirts of Belgrade, at 09:00 on 9 September 1788, Bellegarde engaged in his first feat of arms (the War of Bavarian Succession had no battles): with four squadron of his regiment, he led an attack against the Ottomans entrenched in a line between Batajnica and Semlin; and in the enthusiasm of the attack brought with him a squadron of the Division Zeschwitz Cuirassiers, the Joseph Toscana Dragoons, part of a division of Zelschwit cuirassiers and a squadron of Wurmser Hussars, securing control of a dam and earthenworks on a Danube tributary.

By the end of fighting, in which Bellegarde played a pivotal role in leading the Wurmser Hussars to secure control of the earth works, the Ottoman force lost 300 men, and the Austrians lost 31, and 42 wounded. In the course of the following year, Bellegarde, with his dragoons, came under the command of General of Cavalry Count Kinsky. The largest part of the campaign, he remained with his regiment in cantonment, in the Banat, but as part of the force upon which Feldmarshal Laudon could draw. In late summer 1792, the Regiment Archduke Joseph Toscana dragoons transferred to the Netherlands.

==Wars of the First and Second Coalition==
After being appointed a General-Major in at the end of 1792, he fought in the War of the First Coalition in the Netherlands campaigns of 1793–1794, attached to the command of Feldzeugmeister Prince Hohenlohe, in the main headquarters of Trier. He commanded a defensive line between the Mosel and the Saar rivers, in the Eifel and at the border of the Liège; on his right stood Feldmarshal Lieutenant Beaulieu, and on his left, the Prussian general Kohler. He commanded three battalions, two light companies and two squadrons of hussars.

His contribution to the siege force at Le Quesnoy included two battalions of infantry regiment Grand Duke of Tuscany (Nr 23), a battalion of the Sinoth grenadiers, and two battalions of the Wartensleben. The French made several attempts to lift the siege. On 17 August 1793, he was in the nearby forest with his command, and led a bayonette charge against 6,000 French positioned in the trees, chased them out, and occupied the wood. preventing these troops from relieving the besieged fortress. At the Battle of Avesnes-le-Sec on 12 September, cavalry under his command overran another French relief force in a &quot;highly effective cavalry action&quot;.

After winning promotion to Feldmarshal-Leutnant, he served on the staff of the Archduke Charles in the fighting in Germany. He accompanied Charles to Italy in the following year. He was also employed in the congress of Rastatt.

In 1799, Bellegarde commanded a corps in eastern Switzerland, connecting the armies of Archduke Charles and Aleksandr Suvorov, and finally joined the latter in north Italy. He conducted the siege of the citadel of Alessandria, and was present at the decisive Battle of Novi. After the Austrian defeat at the Battle of Marengo (in which his brother Friedrich Bellegarde commanded a brigade), Emperor Francis II of Austria appointed Bellegarde to command the army in Italy with the rank of General of Cavalry. On 25 December, the French defeated Bellegarde at the Battle of Pozzolo.

==Napoleonic Wars==
In 1805, when Archduke Charles left to take command in Italy, Bellegarde became president &quot;ad interim&quot; of the council of war. He was, however, soon employed in the field, and at the sanguinary Battle of Caldiero he commanded the Austrian right.

In the War of the Fifth Coalition he commanded the I &quot;Armee Korps&quot;. He supervised the II &quot;Armee Korps&quot;, which was also posted on the north bank of the Danube River. Cut off from Archduke Charles as the result of the Battle of Eckmühl, he retreated into Bohemia, but managed to rejoin the main army before the great battles near Vienna.

He led the I Korps in the battles of Aspern-Essling and Wagram. After the 1809 war, Bellegarde became a Feldmarschall. From 1809 to 1813 he was governor-general of Galicia, but was often called to preside over the meetings of the Aulic Council, especially in 1810 in connection with the reorganization of the Austrian army.

In 1813, 1814 and 1815 he led the Austrian armies in Italy. His successes in these campaigns were diplomatic as well as military, and he ended them by crushing the last attempt of Joachim Murat to regain the Kingdom of Naples in 1815.

Between 1815 and 1816, he was Viceroy of Lombardy-Venetia. From 1816 to 1825, (when he had to retire owing to failing eyesight) he held various distinguished civil and military posts.

==Family==
Early in 1791 in Vienna, he married Baroness Augusta von Berlichingen, the widow of the Baron Friedrich August von Berlichingen, and the daughter of Baron Friedrich Alexander von Berlichingen. They had two sons: August (29. October 1795; † 21. June 1873) married Julie von Gudenus (28. October 1795; † 11. February 1865) and Heinrich (1798; † 17. June 1871) married Pauline von Wolkenstein-Trostburg (6. May 1805). He died in Vienna on 22 July 1845, aged 88.

<text>The Anchor Bible Series, which consists of a commentary series, a Bible dictionary, and a reference library, is a scholarly and commercial co-venture which was begun in 1956, with the publication of individual volumes in the commentary series. Over 1,000 scholars—representing Jewish, Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Protestant, Muslim, secular, and other traditions—have contributed to the project. Their works offer discussions that reflect a range of viewpoints across a wide theological spectrum.

 more than 120 volumes had been published, initially under oversight of the series&#x27; founding General Editor David Noel Freedman (1956–2008), and subsequently under John J. Collins (2008–present). Each volume was originally published by Doubleday (a division of Random House, Inc.), but in 2007, the series was acquired by Yale University Press. Yale now prints all new volumes as the Anchor Yale Bible Series, while continuing to offer all previously published Anchor Bible titles as well. In November 2024 Candida Moss was announced as the new general editor of the series.

==&quot;Anchor Bible Commentary Series&quot;==
The &quot;Anchor Bible Commentary Series&quot;, created under the guidance of William Foxwell Albright (1891–1971), comprises a translation and exegesis of the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament and the Intertestamental Books (the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Deuterocanon/the Protestant Apocrypha; not the books called by Catholics and Orthodox &quot;Apocrypha&quot;, which are widely called by Protestants &quot;Pseudepigrapha&quot;). For each biblical book, the series includes an original translation with translational and text-critical notes; overviews of the historical, critical, and literary evolution of the text; an outline of major themes and topics; a verse-by-verse commentary; treatment of competing scholarly theories; historical background; and photographs, illustrations, and maps of artifacts and places associated with biblical figures and sites. Depending on the size and complexity of the book, some are covered in more than one volume.

The series has produced over 100 titles since the release of the first volume in the early 1960s. Despite boasting at least one volume on every book of the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and Deuterocanon/Apocrypha, the series remains a work in progress. Revisions and replacements of earlier works continue to be released, and at least a half-dozen volumes are currently under contract or in production.

==&quot;Anchor Bible Dictionary&quot;==
The &quot;Anchor Bible Dictionary&quot; contains more than 6,000 entries from 800 international scholars. It has illustrations and line-art throughout, and is also available for download from Logos Bible Software or Accordance Bible Software. The &quot;Dictionary&quot; includes articles on the Dead Sea Scrolls, early Jewish-Christian relations, the historical Jesus, sociological and literary methods of biblical criticism, feminist hermeneutics, and numerous entries on archaeological sites, as well as bibliographies with citations listed individually at the end of each article.

==&quot;Anchor Bible Reference Library&quot;==

The &quot;Anchor Bible Reference Library&quot; is an open-ended series composed of more than thirty separate volumes with information about anthropology, archaeology, ecology, geography, history, languages, literature, philosophy, religions, and theology, among others.

<text>Konstantin Mikhaylovich Staniukovich or Stanyukovich (; March 30, 1843 – May 20, 1903) was a Russian writer, remembered today mostly for his stories of the Russian Imperial Navy.

==Biography==

===Early life===
The son of an admiral Mikhail Nikolaievich Staniukovich, he was enrolled in the Imperial Naval School. When he expressed his desire to pursue a literary rather than a naval career, his father engineered his immediate assignment, before graduation, to a long voyage &quot;to clear his head of nonsense&quot;. After the three-year tour ended, by which time he was graduated ship-board and twice promoted to full ensign, he nonetheless resigned from the Navy, was disowned by his family, and embarked on his career as a writer in the liberal camp of 1860s Russia.

===Career===
By the early 1880s, he had gained moderate acclaim for his writing on social issues. Arrested in 1885 for illegal contact with exiles in Western Europe and banished for three years to Siberia, he turned to his twenty-year-old memories of the Navy. Recycling the same cast of characters and the same stock situations over and over, but each time from a slightly different point of view, over the following two decades he created an opus of sea yarns still read today.

The sea stories tell of kind captains and of cruel ones, of efficient first officers and of the indifferent, of idealistic lieutenants and the careerists, of terrible boatswains and of the harmless—though all curse throughout. An admiral of ridiculous volatility makes several cameo appearances, stunning the officers, the crews, and the reader with his tantrums, and all else notwithstanding, with his deep love and respect for the sea and his charges. Shipwrecks, female passengers, adventures in distant America, shipboard duels act as foils for the plots. And through it all the sea and the air are rendered vividly, as the ordinary seamen tell their yarns, in lovingly rendered vernacular.

These are not the tales of Hornblower. A navy at peace is described, and though one suspects that it will not win many battles, one knows it will scuttle itself inexorably, so as not to surrender.

===Legacy===
Staniukovich died already famous. His political views ensured that he continued to be reprinted throughout the Soviet period, and a ten-volume edition of his collected works in 1977 had a print run of 375,000.

<doc id="765058" wikidata="Q3307314" url="?curid=765058" title="Denis Kearney">
<text>Denis Kearney (1847–1907) was a California labor leader from Ireland who was active in the late 19th century and was known for his anti-Chinese activism. Called &quot;a demagogue of extraordinary power,&quot; he frequently gave long and caustic speeches that focused on four general topics: contempt for the press, for capitalists, for politicians, and for Chinese immigrants. A leader of the Workingmen&#x27;s Party of California, he is known for ending all of his speeches with the sentence &quot;And whatever happens, the Chinese must go&quot; (a conscious inspiration from Roman senator Cato the Elder&#x27;s fame for ending all speeches with &quot;ceterum autem censeo Carthaginem esse delendam&quot; – &quot;Furthermore, I consider that Carthage must be destroyed&quot;.)

Kearney was part of a short-lived movement to increase the power of the working class, but after a few years his increasingly vitriolic language and his repeated arrests for inciting violence alienated many of those whom he was trying to influence. When the economy grew stronger in the early 1880s, Kearney faded from public notice. He started an employment agency where he worked until his health began to fail around 1900. He died in Alameda, California, in 1907.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Kearney was born in Oakmount, County Cork, Ireland. In census and voter registration records his birth year is listed as either 1846, 1847 or 1848. The second of seven sons, he left home after his father died when he was just 11 years old. He became a cabin boy on the clipper ship &quot;Shooting Star&quot;, and by his own account he &quot;circumnavigated the globe.&quot; In 1868 he arrived in the United States and married an Irish woman named Mary Ann Leary. Census records list a daughter, Maggie, was born in 1871. Two years later he and his family settled in San Francisco, where he became a U.S. citizen and started a drayage business. A son, William, was born in 1873, and another daughter, Amelia, was born in 1875. By 1877 his business was so well established that he owned five wagons and hauled goods throughout the city.

That same year, Kearney entered into the public arena when he challenged a city-backed monopoly on carting and hauling. As part of this effort he helped to start a loosely organized association of laborers, which within a year&#x27;s time grew into the Workingmen&#x27;s Party of California. For several years the Workingmen&#x27;s Party would provide a forum for Kearney to speak before growing crowds of unemployed people in San Francisco. At first his speeches focused on uniting the poor and the working class while attacking the greed of big business, especially the railroads. He thought of himself as a &quot;workingman&#x27;s advocate&quot;, although he remained highly critical of unions throughout his life and frequently denounced strikes.

Hubert Bancroft, author in the late 1880s of an influential history of California, considered the Workingmen&#x27;s Party to be &quot;ignorant Irish rabble, even though that rabble sometimes paraded the streets as a great political party.&quot; Kearney&#x27;s Irish immigrant background made him subject to frequent accusations that he was a foreign agitator. Middle class critics, fearful of Kearney&#x27;s radical rhetoric and pledges, questioned whether Irish immigrants—embodied by Kearney—should have the right to dictate social policy in San Francisco. As &quot;The Argonaut&quot;, the newspaper founded and published by the former Attorney General of California, Frank Pixley, noted:

When an organization, composed almost entirely of aliens, who are themselves here by the sufferance of a generous hospitality, band themselves together in defiance of the law to drive out a class, who, however objectionable, have the same legal rights as themselves, it is an act of insolent audacity that ought to move the indignation of every honest man.

===Labor organizer and orator===

In spite of growing criticism, Kearney&#x27;s popularity increased. At an outdoor gathering place near San Francisco City Hall known as &quot;The Sandlot&quot; he regularly spoke in front of crowds that numbered as many as 2,000 people. Observers said he had a natural ability to stir up crowds, and since his speeches often lasted as long as two hours he had plenty of opportunity to incite the audience. One of his trademarks was to gradually increase the volume of his speech until it reached fever pitch, then dramatically throw off his coat and unbutton his collar. Such gestures &quot;always provoked a storm of applause.&quot;

Kearney never attended school, but he was a prolific reader and loved to engage in debates. He attended a club in San Francisco known as the Lyceum of Self-Culture, where he sharpened his speaking skills at weekly forums. One of his contemporaries described him as &quot;temperate in everything but speech.&quot; He was said to speak forcibly, and when he wanted to make a point he used words &quot;like a missile.&quot; The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; said &quot;Mr. Kearney has power, and his power is that of the kind which to be appreciated must be seen and heard. It cannot be properly described.&quot;

In some of his speeches Kearny did not hesitate to urge people to take violent actions against politicians and other leaders. He frequently urged people to take immediate retribution on politicians who broke promises. &quot;Shoot the first man that goes back on you after you have elected him intelligently;&quot; he said, &quot;see that you hunt him down and shoot him.&quot; In another speech he declared &quot;Before I starve in this country I will cut a man&#x27;s throat and take whatever he has got ... The Workingmen&#x27;s Party must win, even if it has to wade knee deep in blood and perish in battle.&quot;

Although Kearney was arrested several times for inciting violence, he was always released when charges were either dropped or no one would testify against him. His arrests only served to further his popularity and increase the membership in the Workingmen&#x27;s Party.

===Anti-Chinese immigration agitator===
In one of his early speeches he urged laborers to be &quot;thrifty and industrious like the Chinese&quot;, but within a year&#x27;s time he began denouncing Chinese immigrants as the cause of white workers&#x27; economic woes. By 1878 he used the Sandlot forum to give frequent and violent speeches against Chinese immigrants and the problems he claimed they caused. He warned railroad owners that they had three months to fire all of their Chinese workers or &quot;remember Judge Lynch.&quot;

Within a short time he was known throughout California for his racially charged speeches in which he repeated his slogan &quot;The Chinese must go.&quot;

In 1878, Kearney traveled to Boston to carry his message against the Chinese to eastern audiences. He was warmly welcomed, and it was estimated that &quot;thousands, indeed, packed Faneuil Hall on August 5 to hear his first speech, and thousands more had to be turned away.&quot; Within a short time, however, the crowds at his speeches began to dwindle. &quot;The Boston Journal&quot; noted &quot;the workingmen of this state are by no means united in welcoming Kearney ... Many of them have no sympathy with his anti-Chinese policy, they dislike his openly Communistic principles, and will not endure his conceited intolerance.&quot;

While in Massachusetts he campaigned with the Massachusetts politician Benjamin Butler, the Greenback Party&#x27;s candidate for President. Kearney sought the vice presidential nomination, although Butler never offered it to him. After criticism of him increased in editorials and articles in eastern newspapers, he returned to San Francisco.

Kearney sometimes crossed paths with Chinese-American civil rights activist Wong Chin Foo. Wong challenged Kearney to a duel on the occasion of a speech by Kearney in New York in 1883, giving Kearney &quot;his choice of chopsticks, Irish potatoes, or Krupp guns.&quot; Kearney responded by calling Wong an &quot;almond-eyed leper.&quot; Wong&#x27;s darkly sarcastic commentary on Christian hypocrisy &quot;Why am I a Heathen?&quot; speculated that Kearney might slip into heaven (via an eleventh-hour repentance), and proceed to &quot;organize a heavenly crusade to have me and others immediately cast out and into the other place.&quot;

===Later life===
Kearney faded from the public&#x27;s eye by the early 1880s, leaving as his legacy only the anti-Chinese laws that the Workingmen&#x27;s Party had passed at the 1879 California Constitutional Convention. Many of these laws, which included a ban on the employment of Chinese laborers, were ruled unconstitutional by the federal Ninth Circuit Court. Corresponding with the Irish author and politician James Bryce in the late 1880s, Kearney nonetheless claimed credit for making the &quot;Chinese Question&quot; a national issue and affecting the legislation of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882.

Today there is a Kearny Street in San Francisco that runs through Chinatown; however it was not named after Denis Kearney but after the Mexican–American War Army officer Stephen W. Kearny.

==Excerpts from Kearney&#x27;s speeches==
* &quot;When the Chinese question is settled, we can discuss whether it would be better to hang, shoot, or cut the capitalists to pieces. In six months we will have 50,000 men ready to go out ... and if &#x27;John&#x27; [the Chinese] don&#x27;t leave here, we will drive him and his aborts [sic] into the sea ... We are ready to do it ... If the ballot fails, we are ready to use the bullet.&quot;
* &quot;When I have thoroughly organized my party, we will march through the city and compel the thieves to give up their plunder. I will lead you to the City Hall, clean out the police force, hang the Prosecuting Attorney, burn every book that has a particle of law in it, and then enact new laws for the workingmen.&quot;
* &quot;For reporters of the press I have great respect. The reporters of the newspapers are workingmen, like ourselves working for bread and butter. But for the villainous, serpent-like, slimy imps of hell that run the newspapers, I have the utmost contempt.&quot;
* &quot;If the legislature oversteps decency, then hemp is the battle-cry.&quot; [referring to hemp ropes that could be used in lynchings]

<doc id="765079" wikidata="Q2742862" url="?curid=765079" title="Didier Masson">
<text>Didier Masson (23 February 1886 – 2 June 1950) was a pioneering French aviator. He was born in Asnières, France. He died and was buried in Mérida, Yucatan, Mexico. Among his adventures was his life as a pioneering barnstormer, being the second flier in history to bomb a surface warship, as well as combat service in the Lafayette Escadrille with Edwin C. Parsons and Charles Nungesser. In one of the more unusual aerial victories of history, Masson shot down an enemy plane after his own plane&#x27;s motor quit running. Later in life, he was a manager for pioneer Pan American World Airways, as well as a French consular officer.

==Early life and flying career==

Didier Masson apprenticed as a jeweler for a short while in 1903 before joining the French army. He served in the 129e Regiment d&#x27;Infanterie from 1904 to 1906. After his enlistment ended, he worked for a magneto manufacturer for some years. In 1909, he hired on as a mechanic with Louis Paulhan. Masson claimed to have soloed in 1909 while still in his native country.

==Pioneering barnstormer==
When Paulhan made a barnstorming tour of the United States in 1910, Masson went with him. The two of them were advertised as appearing at an air meet in Boston on 19 August 1910. At Garden City, New York, Masson successfully test-hopped a biplane built by aviation pioneer E. Lilian Todd in the latter part of 1910. With Paulhan&#x27;s help, Masson continued to accumulate both solo and dual flight time even though too poor to own his own airplane.

In January 1911, he set out to simultaneously be the first aviator to deliver newspapers by air and to set a world&#x27;s nonstop distance record in the process. The projected hour and 45-minute flight was planned to carry the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; to San Bernardino, with an en route flyover of Pomona. On 7 January 1911, Masson took off from Los Angeles in the aircraft &quot;Pegasus&quot; at 0700 hours. After a navigational error of 180 degrees, high winds, and an eventful forced landing, he finally arrived at San Bernardino at 1240; his actual flight time was about 80 minutes. Also in January 1911, Masson won a prize for amateur pilots at Tanforan Racetrack in San Francisco, California.

He continued to fly in California, including a flight over Santa Barbara and an exhibition at Watsonville for May Day. He then relocated to Hawaii.

On 3 June, Masson arrived in Honolulu accompanied by Clarence H. Walker and the latter&#x27;s bride and Curtiss biplane. Walker staged an exhibition on 11 June that lost money for its promoter, although the pilot received his contracted fee of $1,250. On 16 June, Masson&#x27;s two monoplanes arrived on the ship &quot;Sierra&quot;. At 0611 hours, 18 June 1911, Masson took off on the first of ten promised flights, from Leilehua to Kapiolani Park. As he had promised, he flew over Schofield Barracks to let the army officers see him. The return flight from Kapiolani Park at 1330 hours did not go smoothly. Even after servicing, Masson&#x27;s new and untested plane did not depart, angering a crowd of spectators. Invidious comparison to an earlier barnstormer, J. C. &quot;Bud&quot; Mars, was made; however, Masson was saved from the perturbed mob by local police and soldiers. Four days later, the French pilot crashed that same plane from 100 feet altitude, destroying the plane but sparing him injury.

In October 1911, Masson wowed Canadians in Alberta with his exhibition of flying despite a paucity of aviation gasoline. After several foiled attempts, on 20 October, he finally succeeded in flying over Victoria Park, and after buzzing several grazing horses to frighten them from a field, landed to greet a crowd of spectators. Towards the end of October, Masson planned a Canadian record distance flight following the railroad from Edmonton to Calgary. A special train full of paying spectators had paid $20 each to accompany Masson&#x27;s epic flight. After several days of cold windy snowy weather, Masson took off, only to have his fuel tank break its mountings and drop on his head. The dazed aviator managed to land safely.

On 18 and 19 May 1912, Masson appeared at the fairgrounds at Lyons, Iowa, as a member of the Ivan Gates flying circus.

By January 1913, he could qualify for Aero Club of America Certificate No. 202 at the Glenn L. Martin Flying School.

==Mercenary==
Masson was working as an instructor for Martin in California when he was contracted by an agent of [gob of the state of sonora Ignacio pesqueira Gallegos and formal gob representative. to become a mercenary soldier. Masson hired on with the Mexican revolutionary leader for $5,000 as an airplane purchase fee, an allotment of $750 for equipment costs, $300 per month salary, $50 per flight for sorties flown in Mexico, and at least $250 for every bombing sortie flown. Masson flew a pusher airplane bought from Glenn Martin in 1912 and smuggled into Mexico through Arizona. The armed smugglers who forced their way into Mexico at the Nogales crossing included Masson and his mechanic, as well as the promote of Sonora Air force Eduardo Hay . oficials Camberos oficial Piña and the brothers Manuel Bauche Alcalde and Joaquín Bauche Alcalde.

The name of the aeroplane was &quot;Sonora&quot;. It could carry two people, or one person and of bombs. After a reconnaissance flight by Masson over Guaymas Harbor, he and Bauche used the aircraft to attack Federalist gunboats for the first aerial bombing of a surface ship. On 10 May 1913, Masson and Bauche overflew at least five Mexican gunboats and dropping four improvised pipe bombs containing of explosives. They missed, but the gunboats, seeing themselves as defenseless, steamed out of Guaymas Harbor to safety; indeed, some crew members leaped overboard in panic caused by the explosions. Masson also flew an unknown number of follow-up bombing missions.

Masson&#x27;s Mexican adventure came to an end when Masson quit flying for the Mexican Revolutionists on 5 August, claiming he had not been paid in a month, and that he had reservations about bombing cities. Masson returned to his newly adopted United States.
==World War I service==

On 8 September 1914, Masson re-enlisted in his old unit. After being transferred to the 36eme Regiment d&#x27;Infanterie for a short while, Masson began military pilot&#x27;s training at Pau. He earned his Military Pilot&#x27;s Brevet on a Caudron on 10 May 1915. He was then assigned to Escadrille 18, which was operating Caudrons. In September 1915, he received additional training, learning to fly Nieuports. He was then forwarded to a Nieuport squadron, Escadrille 16, in April 1916, and passed through to start instructing at Cazeau on the 16th. He was in this assignment only two months, checking into the famed Lafayette Escadrille, Escadrille N124, on 16 June 1916. Though he never became an ace, Masson did manage the remarkable feat of having his Nieuport 17&#x27;s engine cut out while in a dogfight and still downing his German opponent, gliding to safety near the French front lines afterwards. His hasty departure from the wrecked airplane saved him from the German artillery fire that was rained down upon it. By the time Masson departed N124, he was an Adjutant.

==Post World War I==

Masson returned to Mexico and married. He worked as an airport manager for Pan American in Central America. He also served as a French consular officer until the German invasion of France in 1940.

==Death==
Didier Masson died in Mérida, Yucatan, Mexico in June 1950.

<doc id="765080" wikidata="Q879106" url="?curid=765080" title="Robert J. Walker">
<text>Robert James Walker (July 19, 1801November 11, 1869) was an American lawyer, economist and politician. An active member of the Democratic Party, he served as a member of the U.S. Senate from Mississippi from 1835 until 1845, as Secretary of the Treasury from 1845 to 1849 during the administration of President James K. Polk, and briefly as Territorial Governor of Kansas in 1857. He was responsible for drafting the 1849 bill that eventually established the United States Department of the Interior.

As senator, Walker vigorously supported the annexation of Texas. As Secretary of the Treasury, he held responsibility for the management of funds relating to the Mexican–American War. He contributed to a bill called the Walker tariff, which reduced rates to some of the lowest in history. Walker was appointed Governor of Kansas in 1857 by President James Buchanan but resigned shortly after due to his opposition to the administration-sponsored pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution. After his retirement from politics, Walker supported the United States during the American Civil War and continued to practice law in Washington, D.C.

==Early life and education==
Born in Northumberland, Pennsylvania, to Revolutionary War veteran and Pennsylvania judge, Jonathan Hoge Walker (July 20, 1754 – March 23, 1824) and his wife Lucretia (&quot;Lucy&quot;) Duncan Walker (1770–1837), he and his brother Duncan grew up in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, from 1806 to 1814, where Jonathan Walker served as presiding judge of the judicial district. Judge Walker become the first judge of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in 1818 (after nomination by President James Monroe and confirmation by the Senate) and served until his death. Initially educated at the Bellefonte Academy, Robert Walker graduated in 1819 at the top of his class at the University of Pennsylvania where he was a member of the Philomathean Society.

He married Mary Blechynden Bache Walker and had five children, including Duncan Stephen Walker. His wife was a great-granddaughter of Benjamin Franklin.

==Career==
Admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in Pittsburgh in 1821, Walker practiced law in Pittsburgh from 1822 until 1826 when he moved to Natchez, Mississippi, where his father had died in 1824 at the home of his brother Duncan Walker. Robert Walker then joined his brother, Duncan Walker, in a lucrative law practice. Walker and his uncle also speculated in cotton, land and slaves. However, his brother Duncan (a former Mississippi legislator) moved to Texas in 1834 for health reasons, where he became involved in land speculation and the growing independence movement. For his involvement in the abortive Texas Revolution of 1835, Duncan Walker was imprisoned in Mexico, and traveled to Cuba after his release, where he died on December 31, 1835 (causing his brother Robert to inherit property in Texas).

===U.S. Senator (1835–1845)===
Robert Walker became politically prominent during the Nullification Crisis of 1832, even arguing the federal government&#x27;s right to coerce rebellious states and earning praise from former President James Madison. In 1836 Walker became the Union candidate for U.S. Senate from Mississippi and won election over the incumbent George Poindexter, who had criticized him for rigging bids to purchase land that Mississippi had acquired from the Choctaw as a result of the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek (1831). Walker served in the United States Senate as a Unionist Democrat from 1835 to 1845, winning re-election by a two to one margin over Sergeant S. Prentiss, as well as convincing Mississippi legislators to adopt resolutions denouncing nullification and secession as treason.

An ardent expansionist, Walker supported the administration of President Andrew Jackson and (perhaps to continue his brother&#x27;s legacy) voted for recognition of the Republic of Texas in 1837 and in January 1844 proposed annexation of Texas, subject to gradual emancipation and colonization of its black population, for which John C. Calhoun criticized him. Nonetheless, Walker proposed the joint annexation resolution of 1845. He also worked for the nomination and election of James K. Polk in 1844, in part because President Martin Van Buren opposed annexation. Walker also favored the award of public lands to new states and proposed a Homestead bill in 1836. He also endorsed a low tariff (which favored his state&#x27;s farming interests); opposed distribution of the federal surplus funds for fear of creating an excuse to raise tariff rates; and, significantly, supported the independent Treasury system idea. He also opposed the Bank of the United States, and later repeal of the Missouri Compromise of 1820.

As a Mississippi senator and slaveholder himself, Walker passionately defended slavery, while also opposing the African slave trade and favoring gradual emancipation and the efforts of the American Colonization Society. He stressed its economic benefits, and claimed slaves/African Americans would fall into turpitude or insanity without firm masters. However, in 1838 Walker freed some of his slaves.

Walker also claimed that independent Texas had to be annexed to prevent it from falling into the hands of Great Britain, which would use it to spread subversion throughout the South. He warned Northerners that if Britain succeeded in undermining slavery, the freed slaves would go north, where &quot;the poor-house and the jail, the asylums of the deaf and dumb, the blind, the idiot and insane, would be filled to overflowing.&quot;

===Secretary of the Treasury (1845–1849)===

Upon the recommendation of Vice President George M. Dallas, newly elected President Polk nominated Walker to become U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, and fellow Senators confirmed him. Walker served in that position throughout the Polk administration (from March 8, 1845, until March 5, 1849), and was an influential member of the President&#x27;s Cabinet.

Walker was involved in a prominent Treasury report of December 3, 1845, which attacked the tariff protection system for manufactures yet supported a tariff for revenue. The Walker Tariff of 1846 was based upon the principles of this paper and was in fact largely the secretary&#x27;s own work. He also drafted the 1849 bill to establish the United States Department of the Interior. Walker also supported the independent treasury system, and established a warehousing system for handling imports that has had lasting influence.

As Treasury Secretary, Walker was responsible for financing the Mexican–American War, but did so very loosely. On February 23, 1848, he wrote to Major General William Orlando Butler, &quot;Sir, Upon the ratification of a treaty of peace by the Republic of Mexico in conformity with the provisions of the act of the congress of the United States of America approved March 3, 1847 stated &#x27;an act making further appropriation to bring the existing war with Mexico to a speedy and honorable conclusion&#x27; you are authorized to draw on this department for any sum not exceeding three millions of dollars to be paid in pursuance of the promotion of said act.&quot;
During the Mexican-American War, the U.S. Treasury appeared short of money. An astonishingly large amount of funds (about $6 million) had been withdrawn from the army&#x27;s quartermaster and commissary departments. Investigation disclosed that $1.1 million of those funds had been deposited in the bank of Corcoran and Riggs, which in turn invested the funds in stock securities. Polk, who had run on an anti-bank platform, wrote in his diary that it was the most troubling moment of his presidency. Confronting Walker yielded only casual, vague replies. Polk ordered an investigation, but Walker still could not give Polk the answers he needed. Eventually Walker told Polk that the $600,000 remaining in the bankers&#x27; hands would be distributed to the army and Polk lost interest in the matter. No chicanery was proven before the investigation was dropped. However, before Walker&#x27;s initial appointment, Polk&#x27;s mentor Andrew Jackson had warned him &quot;that Walker wasn&#x27;t a man to be trusted with the nation&#x27;s cash.&quot;

After leaving Treasury in 1849, Walker resumed his legal practice in Washington, D.C. He and Edwin Stanton became Pittsburgh&#x27;s lawyers in the city&#x27;s (and Pennsylvania&#x27;s, represented by its attorney general Cornelius Darragh) litigation against the Wheeling Suspension Bridge in the United States Supreme Court. His business interests included land speculation and mining stocks.

In 1853, President Franklin Pierce offered Walker the post of United States Minister to China, but Walker declined.

===Kansas Territorial Governor (1857)===
Walker at first opposed the Compromise of 1850, but was won over later by the arguments of Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas. He was appointed governor of Kansas Territory on May 27, 1857, by President James Buchanan, but resigned in December because of his opposition to the Lecompton Constitution. In a to Secretary of State Lewis Cass dated December 15, 1857, he cited clear voting fraud and improper political pressure from the Administration. He did not, however, break with his party immediately, and favored the so-called English Bill. Partly due to his influence, enough anti-Lecompton Democrats were induced to vote for that measure to secure its passage.

===American Civil War and later life===
Despite his status as a former Mississippi senator and slave owner, as a Southern Unionist Walker supported the Union cause during the American Civil War. His eldest son, Duncan Stephen Walker, initially commissioned as a Captain of Volunteers in the Union Army, rose to receive a brevet commission as brigadier general on March 13, 1865, for his gallant and meritorious services during that war. The younger Walker initially served as adjutant on the staff of Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks, and later on the staff of Brig. Gen. William H. Emory and finally on the staff of Major Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock. Meanwhile, his father, former Treasury Secretary Walker, sailed to Europe in 1863 as financial agent of the United States, where he fostered confidence in the financial resources of the United States. He secured a loan of $250,000,000 in &quot;5-20&quot; bonds.

Walker resumed his Washington, D.C., law practice upon returning from Europe in November 1864, and also continued publishing on financial topics until his death in the national capital five years later. Both during and after the Civil War he was a contributor to the &quot;Continental Monthly&quot;, which for a short time he also published, with James R. Gilmore.

==Death and legacy==
Walker died in Washington, D.C., on November 11, 1869. He is buried at Washington&#x27;s Oak Hill cemetery. His son-in-law Benjamin H. Brewster became Attorney General under Chester A. Arthur. Many of his papers are held by the University of Pittsburgh, which has digitized them.

Initially, Walker County, Texas, was named in his honor. However, due to Walker&#x27;s support of the Union during the Civil War, the Texas Legislature withdrew the honor and honored Samuel Walker (no relation), a Texas Ranger, instead.

The survey ship &quot;Robert J. Walker&quot;, which served in the United States Coast Survey from 1848 to 1860, was named for Walker.

A merchant vessel named &quot;Robert J. Walker&quot; was constructed in 1943, and served until its sinking by a German U-boat off the coast of Australia the following year.

<doc id="765081" wikidata="Q494234" url="?curid=765081" title="Pretty Girls Make Graves">
<text>Pretty Girls Make Graves is a post-hardcore band formed in Seattle in 2001, named after The Smiths&#x27; song of the same name (which itself was named after a quote from Jack Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot;). Andrea Zollo and Derek Fudesco had played together previously in The Hookers, as well as The Death Wish Kids and Area 51 along with Dann Gallucci, with whom Derek had formed Murder City Devils. Not long before the Murder City Devils disbanded, Derek and Andrea formed Pretty Girls Make Graves along with Jay, Nick and Nathan. They played the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2004. The band announced its split on January 29, 2007, with their final two shows taking place in Seattle that June.

== History ==
The band released their first EP on Dim Mak and Sound Virus Records before releasing their debut album &quot;Good Health&quot; on Lookout Records in April 2002. The band would later sign to Matador Records where they released &quot;The New Romance&quot;, and then later &quot;Elan Vital&quot;. Guitarist Nathan Thelen left Pretty Girls Make Graves in March 2004 to form Moonrats and Leona Marrs (formerly of HintHint) joined as a multi-instrumentalist. On January 29, 2007, the band announced that Nick had left the band and their May 2007 tour would be their last.

===Post-breakup projects===
Clark formed Jaguar Love with former Blood Brothers members Johnny Whitney and Cody Votolato. They signed with Matador Records, the former label home of Pretty Girls Make Graves. On February 18, 2009, it was announced Jay was no longer playing in the line up of Jaguar Love, being replaced with a drum machine on that tour.

Dewitt continued working on his solo electronic project Dutch Dub. He also played with Amy Blaschke in Night Canopy. Fudesco, meanwhile, formed The Cave Singers, with Pete Quirk of Hint Hint and Marty Lund of Cobra High.

Soon after leaving Pretty Girls Make Graves, Thelen started Moonrats in Seattle together with keyboard player Aska Matsumiya and drummer Jason Echeverria. They moved to Los Angeles and released an EP on their own. They put out a full-length and a 7&quot; on LA Records in 2008. Thelen then formed Drug Cabin, with Marcus Congleton of Ambulance Ltd, releasing two albums in early 2015 on 401K Music Inc.

Zollo played drums with Triumph of Lethargy Skinned Alive to Death, and also sang in Deep Creep with Fudesco. She later left the music industry, and began work as a hairstylist.

===Reunion===
In November 2023, the band were announced on the line-up for the 2024 iteration of the When We Were Young festival. There, the band will perform &quot;The New Romance&quot; in its entirety. In February 2024, the band announced a headlining show to take place at The Showbox in Seattle that September.

<text>A fight song is a rousing short song associated with a sports team. The term is most common in the United States and Canada. In Australia, Mexico, and New Zealand, these songs are called the team anthem, team song, or games song. First associated with collegiate sports, fight songs are also used by secondary schools and in professional sports.

Fight songs are sing-alongs, allowing sports fans to cheer collectively for their team. These songs are commonly played several times at a sporting event. For example, the band might play the fight song when entering the stadium, whenever their team scores, or while cheerleaders dance at halftime or during other breaks in the game. In Australian rules football, the team song is traditionally sung by the winning team at the end of the game.

Some fight songs have a long history, connecting the fans who sing them to a time-honored tradition, frequently to music played by the institution&#x27;s band. An analysis of 65 college fight songs by &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; identified words commonly used in the lyrics of these songs, including fight, win, and victory. Other common elements of fight song lyrics are mentioning the team&#x27;s colors, spelling out the school&#x27;s name, and using the words &quot;hail&quot; and &quot;rah.&quot; Many songs were composed by students, alumni, or faculty of the institution; for example, Cole Porter wrote &quot;Bulldog&quot; for his alma mater Yale College. Some songs are created by pairing new lyrics with a pre-existing tune, even another college&#x27;s fight song. 

Hundreds of colleges have fight songs, most originating from the early 20th century in connection with football. The first collegiate fight song in the United States is Boston College&#x27;s &quot;For Boston&quot;, written and composed by T. J. Hurley in 1885. One of the oldest fight songs in Australia is Melbourne Grammar School&#x27;s &quot;Play Together, Dark Blue Twenty&quot; dating to before 1893. In 1997, &quot;USA Today&quot; selected &quot;Aggie War Hymn&quot;, the fight song of Texas A&amp;M University, as the &quot;No. 1&quot; college football fight song in the United States.

Although used similarly, stadium anthems differ from fight songs because they are not written specifically for a sports team. Fight songs are also different from an alma mater or school song, which is a patronal song for an educational institution and usually has a slower tempo.

==List of college fight songs==

Many colleges have unofficial fight songs or have changed their official song over the years. Additionally, some colleges have rally songs, spirit songs, cheer songs, and alma maters. This list is exclusively for the fight song or songs currently approved by the institution, even if played infrequently.

<doc id="765083" wikidata="Q4552059" url="?curid=765083" title="16 in Webster Groves">
<text>16 in Webster Groves is a 1966 documentary TV special produced by CBS News focusing on the experiences of adolescents growing up and living in Webster Groves, Missouri, United States.

Produced by Arthur Barron and narrated by Charles Kuralt, the program was inspired by a survey conducted by the University of Chicago. It showed the middle-American, middle class town to be a superficially friendly, prosperous, progressive, religious, charitable, arts-and-education oriented bedroom community whose adolescent culture, with the complicity (and, by inference, example and encouragement) of the adult population, was in fact clique-ridden, status-oriented, hypercompetitive, hypocritical, prejudiced, and materialistic. In stark contrast to the popular view in the mid-1960s that young people were rebelling against the values of their parents, the program depicted the Webster Groves teenagers as unimaginative and conformist. One sixteen-year-old girl, for example, declares that her dream is to live in a house down the street from the one she lives in now. That interview, and others with a cross section of sixteen-year-olds in the community, including minorities and exchange students, and consensual filming of their normal activities, both in school and at recreation, provided the content of the program.

A 2006 retrospective article in the local newspaper &quot;Riverfront Times&quot; indicated that, after the documentary aired, many the town&#x27;s citizens felt that their community had been unfairly portrayed. For example, when the documentary showed students running away from school in an apparent eagerness to leave, it was not mentioned that they were actually rushing out to see the CBS helicopter. Another time when the students were all portrayed as depressed, the real reason for that depression was not mentioned (the funeral of a popular student). However, in CBS&#x27;s follow up program they addressed this as a persistent rumour and said, in fact, that the scene had been shot three weeks after the funeral. Writer Jonathan Franzen, who was 16 in Webster Groves about ten years after the program aired, said &quot;[T]he Webster Groves depicted in it bears minimal resemblance to the friendly, unpretentious town I knew when I was growing up. But it’s useless to contradict TV...&quot;.

In response to the protest, CBS returned to Webster Groves and made a follow-up, &quot;16 In Webster Groves Revisited&quot;, which was essentially the same material with some added footage of residents venting. In the sequel, Kuralt said &quot;One sociologist suggested we ought to call it &quot;Forty in Webster Groves.&quot;&quot;

<doc id="765087" wikidata="Q520309" url="?curid=765087" title="Harold Spencer Jones">
<text>Sir Harold Spencer Jones KBE FRS FRSE PRAS (29 March 1890 – 3 November 1960) was an English astronomer. He became renowned as an authority on positional astronomy and served as the tenth Astronomer Royal for 23 years. Although born &quot;Jones&quot;, his surname became &quot;Spencer Jones&quot;.

==Early life==
Harold Spencer Jones was born in Kensington, London, on 29 March 1890. His father, Henry Charles Jones, was an accountant and his mother, Sarah Ryland, had earlier worked as a school teacher. He was educated at Latymer Upper School, in Hammersmith, West London, from where he obtained a scholarship to Jesus College, Cambridge. He graduated there in 1911, and was awarded a postgraduate studentship. He subsequently became a Fellow of the college.

==Chief Assistant at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, 1913–1923==
In 1913 he was appointed Chief Assistant at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, filling a vacancy created by the departure of Arthur Eddington to become Plumian Professor of Astronomy at Cambridge. In December 1913 Spencer Jones was elected to the Royal Astronomical Society.

Spencer Jones&#x27;s astronomical work extended over a range of subjects. He specialised in positional astronomy, particularly the motion and orientation of the Earth in space. He also studied the motions of stars. He travelled to Minsk in Eastern Europe in 1914 to observe a total solar eclipse, departing during peacetime but returning after the start of the First World War.

His activities at the observatory were disrupted by the war, when he worked temporarily for the Ministry of Munitions, particularly on optics.

In 1918 Spencer Jones married Gladys Mary Owers.

He resumed his astronomical work after the war, including studying the positions of stars, the rotation of the Earth, and the brightnesses of stars. During this period he wrote his textbook &quot;General Astronomy&quot;.

On 30 March 1921 Spencer Jones joined the British Astronomical Association. In 1922 he travelled to Christmas Island in an attempt to observe a total solar eclipse, intending to verify the deflection of the light of stars by the Sun that had been seen during a 1919 eclipse, but cloud defeated the attempts.

==His Majesty&#x27;s Astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope, 1923–1933==
The astronomer in charge of the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope, Sydney Hough, died in 1923, and Spencer Jones was appointed Hough&#x27;s successor as His Majesty&#x27;s Astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope. Spencer Jones and his wife sailed to South Africa, arriving in December 1923.

During his nine years at the observatory, Spencer Jones set about renewing its administration and scientific work. He made efforts to improve working conditions and morale at the observatory. He led efforts by the staff to measure the properties of large numbers of stars from photographic plates exposed on the observatory&#x27;s telescopes. This work included measuring the positions of stars that had been studied years earlier to determine their proper motions (their very small movements across the sky relative to distant stars). The velocities of stars along the line-of-sight were measured from their spectra. The staff members measured brightnesses of 40000 stars from their images on photographs. They also determined the distances of stars from their parallaxes – the very small apparent annual motions as the Earth orbited the Sun. Many of these results were published as star catalogues.

Spencer Jones&#x27;s own research concentrated on the motions of the Earth and the Moon. He refined knowledge of the Moon&#x27;s orbit using observations of occultations of stars. He obtained improved measurements of the distance of the Sun from the Earth using observations of the position of Mars in the sky through its parallax, and carried out a series of observations of the minor planet 433 Eros during its close approach in 1930–1931 for the same purpose. These Eros observations later gave the best measurement of the distance of the Sun then available. He was later awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society and the Royal Medal of the Royal Society for this work.

==Astronomer Royal, 1933–1955==
In 1933 Spencer Jones succeeded Sir Frank Dyson as Astronomer Royal, and consequently returned to Britain to take charge of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.

Spencer Jones took up the administrative challenges, including recruiting new staff and installing new instruments. He upgraded the time service provided by the observatory. He took on overall responsibility for the Nautical Almanac Office. He obtained government agreement to move the observatory from its historic site in Greenwich, which was by then significantly affected by the light and pollution of London, to a darker location away from the city.

Spencer Jones found time for his own scientific research. He analysed and published the Eros observations made in South Africa. He contributed significantly to precise measurements of the rotation of the Earth and of the motions of the planets.

The Second World War disrupted the activities of the observatory. A number of staff members left temporarily to engage in war work. Spencer Jones and his support staff moved from London to the comparative safety of Abinger, Surrey.

Active scientific activity resumed in Greenwich after the end of the war with the return of staff and some equipment. However, government agreement was reached to move the observatory to Herstmonceux Castle in Sussex, and the new site was purchased. Spencer Jones moved from Greenwich to Herstmonceux in 1948, but the removal of the whole institution was not completed for another ten years, because of the need to erect new buildings and a lack of funding following the war. The institution at its new location in Sussex assumed the name Royal Greenwich Observatory. Spencer Jones led major construction projects to accommodate instruments moved from Greenwich.

Spencer Jones played a leading role in plans to build a large telescope at Herstmonceux. These led to the Isaac Newton Telescope which was eventually opened in 1967.

One of his long-standing interests was time keeping and horology. He served as president of the British Horological Institute from 1939 to his death in 1960.

He was president of the International Astronomical Union from 1945 to 1948. He served as president of the Royal Astronomical Society from 1937 to 1939, and at other times as the society&#x27;s secretary, treasurer and foreign secretary.

He was knighted in 1943 and awarded the KBE in 1955.

In 1947, Spencer Jones was elected the first President of the Royal Institute of Navigation. In 1951, the Institute&#x27;s highest award, the Gold Medal was named in his honour and continues to be awarded by the Institute to those who make outstanding contributions to navigation.

== Personal life ==
Sir Harold Spencer Jones had two sons, John (whose early career was spent as a jet pilot with the Royal Air Force) and David, with his wife Lady Gladys Mary Owens Spencer Jones.

==Retirement and later life==
Spencer Jones retired as Astronomer Royal at the end of 1955. He continued to contribute actively to a number of scientific bodies. He died on 3 November 1960 aged 70. His cause of death was cardiac arrest.

==Opinions about space travel==
Spencer Jones&#x27;s successor as Astronomer Royal was Richard Woolley, who on taking up the position in 1956 responded to a question from the press and was misquoted as saying &quot;Space travel is utter bilge&quot;. Similarly, it is often stated that Spencer Jones himself had a strong disbelief in the practicalities of space flight, and that he famously said &quot;space travel is bunk&quot; only two weeks before the Sputnik 1 launch in October 1957. Despite recent suggestions that he did not actually make such a statement,
the quote was referenced in 1959 (during his lifetime) in the 17 September issue of New Scientist magazine (page 476). The sentiment of the quote is consistent with Spencer Jones&#x27; own 1957 editorial in the same magazine (10 October 1957), twelve years before the Apollo 11 landing on the Moon, in which he stated:

I am of the opinion that generations will pass before man ever lands on the moon and that, should he eventually succeed in doing so, there would be little hope of his succeeding in returning to the Earth and telling us of his experiences. Beyond the moon he is never likely to go unless, through an error in launching, his space vehicle misses its target and wanders off into space, never to return.

<text>St Patrick&#x27;s Pontifical University, Maynooth (), is a pontifical Catholic university in the town of Maynooth near Dublin, Ireland. The college and national seminary on its grounds are often referred to as Maynooth College.

The college was officially established as the Royal College of St Patrick by Maynooth College Act 1795. Thomas Pelham, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, introduced a bill for the foundation of a Catholic college, and this was enacted by parliament. It was opened to hold up to 500 students for the Catholic priesthood of whom up to 90 would be ordained each year, and was once the largest seminary in the world.

Degrees are awarded by the Pontifical University at Maynooth, which was established by a pontifical charter of 1896. The pontifical charter entitles the university to grant degrees in canon law, philosophy and theology.

The college is associated with the state-run Maynooth University, with which it shares an historic campus, as well as certain facilities.

==History==
===16th century foundation===
The town of Maynooth, County Kildare, was the seat of the Fitzgeralds, Earls of Kildare. The ivy-covered tower attached to St Mary&#x27;s Church of Ireland is all that remains of the ancient college of St Mary of Maynooth, founded and endowed by Gerald, 8th Earl of Kildare, and dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. On 7 October 1515 Henry VIII granted licence for the establishment of a college. In 1518, the 9th Earl presented a petition to the Archbishop of Dublin, William Rokeby, for a license to found and endow a college at Maynooth: the College of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In 1535 the college was suppressed and its endowments and lands confiscated as part of the Reformation.

===1795 re-establishment===
The present college was created in the 1790s against the background of the upheaval during the French Revolution and the gradual removal of the penal laws. The college was particularly intended to provide for the education of Catholic priests in Ireland, who until this Act had to go to continental Europe for their formation and theological education. Many were educated in France, and the church and government were concerned at the Dechristianization of France during the French Revolution, and at the same time at the risk of revolutionary thinking arising from training in revolutionary France (with whom Britain was at war). A number of the early lecturers in Maynooth, were exiles from France (such as sometimes called the French &quot;founding fathers&quot;, Professors Francois Anglade, André Darré, Louis-Gilles Delahogue, and Pierre-Justin Delort), also among the first professors was a layman James Bernard Clinch recommended by Edmund Burke. Also relevant was the enactment of the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1793.

The college was legally established on 5 June 1795 by the Maynooth College Act 1795 as &quot;The Royal College of St Patrick&quot;, by act of the Parliament of Ireland, to provide &quot;for the better education of persons professing the popish or Roman Catholic religion&quot;. The college was originally established to provide a university education for Catholic lay and ecclesiastical students, the lay college was based in Riverstown House on the south campus from 1802. With the opening of Clongowes Wood in 1814, the lay college (which had lay trustees) was closed and the college functioned solely as a Catholic seminary for almost 150 years.
In 1800, John Butler, 12th Baron Dunboyne, died and left a substantial fortune to the college. Butler had been a Roman Catholic, and Bishop of Cork, who had embraced Protestantism in order to marry and guarantee the succession to his hereditary title. However, there were no children to his marriage and it was alleged that he had been reconciled to the Catholic Church at his death. Were this the case, a Penal Law demanded that the will was invalid and his wealth would pass to his family. Much litigation followed before a negotiated settlement in 1808 that led to the establishment of a Dunboyne scholarship fund.

The land was donated by William FitzGerald, 2nd Duke of Leinster, who had argued in favour of Catholic Emancipation in the Irish House of Lords. He lived nearby at Carton and also at Leinster House. The building work was paid for by the British Government; parliament continued to give it an annual grant until the Irish Church Act 1869. When this law was passed the college received a capital sum of £369,000. The trustees invested 75% of this in mortgages to Irish landowners at a yield of 4.25% or 4.75% per annum. This would have been considered a secure investment at that time but agitation for land reform and the depression of the 1870s eroded this security. The largest single mortgage was granted to the Earl of Granard. Accumulated losses on these transactions reached £35,000 by 1906.

The first building to go up on this site was designed by, and named after, John Stoyte; Stoyte House, which can still be seen from the entrance to the old campus, is a well-known building to Maynooth students and stands very close to the very historic Maynooth Castle. Over the next 15 years, the site at Maynooth underwent rapid construction so as to cater for the influx of new students, and the buildings which now border St Joseph&#x27;s Square (to the rear of Stoyte House) were completed by 1824.

The Rev. Laurence F. Renehan (1797–1857), a noted antiquarian, church historian, and cleric, served as president of St Patrick&#x27;s from 1845 until 1857. Under Renehan, many of the college&#x27;s most important buildings were constructed by Augustus Pugin.

===Maynooth Grant===
Following the controversy regarding the Maynooth Grant, the college received a higher annual grant from the British Government, as well as a sum for repairs. In 1845, the British government under Robert Peel increased the annual grant to Maynooth College from £9,000 to £26,000, and provided a capital grant of £30,000 for building extensions again. However this was controversial as Roman Catholics saw it as a bribe, while most Protestants were not in favour of the government funding Roman Catholic education. For example, the Anti-Maynooth Conference was hosted in London in May 1845 by Conservatives, evangelical Anglicans and the Protestant Association to campaign against the Maynooth Grant.

===Oath of Allegiance===
As part of the Act on which Maynooth College was founded, students and trustees of the college were expected to take an Oath of Allegiance to the Crown. Some clerical students did not attend since they objected to pledging allegiance to the head of the Anglican church.

===Michael O&#x27;Hickey===
In 1909, Irish language activist and scholar Micheál Pádraig Ó hIcí (1860–1916) was dismissed from his position as Professor of Irish for his conduct in the controversy over Irish as a matriculation subject for the new National University of Ireland. He was supported by such Maynooth figures as the college president, Daniel Mannix, and the Professor of Theology, Walter McDonald (1854–1920).

In &quot;An Linn Bhuí&quot;, the Irish-language journal of Co Waterford, O&#x27;Hickey&#x27;s home county, Mícheál Briody, lecturer at the Languages Centre, Helsinki University, Finland, says that O&#x27;Hickey was a prominent member of the Gaelic League and fiercely in favour of compulsory Irish for the new University of Ireland, whereas Mannix, then President of St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth, together with most of the Catholic bishops, was opposed. This was the cause of O&#x27;Hickey&#x27;s sacking. Briody says that the senate of the new university, one year after O&#x27;Hickey&#x27;s sacking, agreed to Irish being compulsory for matriculation and not long after that Mannix was posted as the Archbishop of Melbourne in Australia against his own will. Mannix, however, later became a strong supporter of Irish republicanism and something of a thorn in the side of the authorities both ecclesiastical and civil, in Australia as well as Britain.

===Expansion===
In 1876 the college became a constituent college of the Catholic University of Ireland, and later offered Royal University of Ireland degrees in arts and science. Even after the granting of the Pontifical Charter in 1896 the college became a &quot;recognised college&quot; of the National University of Ireland in 1910, and from this time its arts and science degrees were awarded by the National University of Ireland. However, during this time the Pontifical University of Maynooth continued to confer its degrees in theology, because until 1997 theology degrees were prohibited by the Royal University of Ireland and its successor the National University of Ireland.

===Lay entry===
In 1966 after a gap of nearly 150 years lay students again entered the college, these being the members of lay religious institutes, and in 1968 all laity were accepted; by 1977 they outnumbered religious students.

===Separation of NUI Maynooth / Maynooth University===
In 1997 the Universities Act, 1997 was passed by the Oireachtas. Chapter IX of the Act provided for the creation of the separate Maynooth University. This new university was created from the college&#x27;s faculties of Arts, Celtic Studies and Philosophy, and Science.

In 1994, W. J. Smyth had been appointed to the position of Master of St Patrick&#x27;s College Maynooth (NUI). In 1997 this position was converted into President of MU. After his 10-year term ended in 2004, he was replaced by John Hughes as president of Maynooth University and a new line of heads for the college.

===Seminary in 21st century===
By 2016, the number of resident seminarians dropped from several hundreds to just 40 to 60. In August 2016 it was revealed that, due to frequent use of Grindr by college students, the then Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin decided to transfer the students from his diocese to the Irish Pontifical College in Rome. According to Martin, &quot;there are allegations on different sides&quot;, one of which of an &quot;atmosphere that was growing in Maynooth&quot; of a &quot;homosexual, a gay culture, that students have been using an app called Grindr&quot;, which &quot;would be fostering promiscuous sexuality, which is certainly not in any way the mature vision of sexuality one would expect a priest to understand&quot;.

Subsequently, the college trustees had ordered a review of the college&#x27;s policy on social media use.

==Student activities and alumni==
Maynooth Students&#x27; Union represents students of St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth and NUI Maynooth.

The &quot;Maynooth Union&quot; was founded in 1895 during the centenary and the constitution agreed in 1896, to &quot;foster a spirit of mutual sympathy between the College and its past students and friends&quot;, it hosts an annual reunion. Maynooth Alumni Association provides graduates of the St. Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth and NUI Maynooth, with a channel to keep in touch with their &quot;alma mater&quot; as well as with friends and classmates from their time in Maynooth it is based in Riverstown Lodge on the south campus.

In 1972 Maynooth entered the Gaelic Football Sigerson Cup for the first time and won it in 1976. They also participate in the Hurling competition, the Fitzgibbon Cup and won it in 1973 and 1974.

==Emblem==
St. Patrick&#x27;s Flag is used as the emblem of the college, and the flag has flown above Stoyte House, a new logo was used for the buildup and since the bicentennial of the college based on the Gothic buildings. The St. Patrick&#x27;s flag is on the coat of arms of the Duke of Leinster who donated the land for Maynooth College. The St. Patrick&#x27;s flag is also contained in the logo of St. Patrick&#x27;s Pontifical University Maynooth, the Maynooth logo, with the papal keys symbol behind it.

==Governance==
From its foundation 1795 Maynooth had been governed by a board of clerical (long-serving Catholic bishops of Ireland) and lay trustees appointed by the government. The lay trustees were prominent Catholic Lords, such as the Earl of Fingall Arthur James Plunkett and the Lord Chancellor of Ireland. One of the side effects of the act to disestablish the Church of Ireland, was that Maynooth&#x27;s governance and funding changed, leaving only the Bishops on the board of trustees.(Vic., C.25)

===Library===
Prior to the establishment of the college, students for the diocesan priesthood had to travel to the European mainland, to one of the many Irish colleges based principally in France, Spain, and the Low Countries. The continental background of early members of staff, some of whom were native French refugees from the French Revolution, is reflected in the Library&#x27;s holdings. A large proportion of the 22,000 pre-1850 books were published abroad. Several professors and eminent churchmen were great collectors, and their collections ultimately came to the Library. At the beginning, the Library was small and there were no text books for the students. Many professors decided to go into print and to write their own, having their students subscribe in advance. Printing by subscription was a common practice and the subscription lists still show the names of students and staff from this early period in the college&#x27;s history.

When the annual grant received by the college was increased threefold in 1845, the president at the time, Laurence Renehan, started much needed renovations. Augustus Welby Pugin was brought in to design new buildings, which included a library with high gothic windows and an open timbered roof, completed in 1861. The tall wooden stacks and long center tables hardly changed for over a century, and daylight was considered sufficient to work by until 1970, when electric lighting was finally introduced. It now houses the pre-1850 books and manuscripts and is known as the Russell Library. It is home to a fine collection of Gaelic manuscripts, as well as non-Gaelic manuscripts that are largely the literary contributions of staff and students. When the last Irish college in Spain (Salamanca) closed in 1951, the archives were transferred to Maynooth. These included documents from other Irish colleges (Alcalá, Santiago, and Seville) and administrative records dating back to the end of the sixteenth century. The Russell Library housed two-thirds of the book stock and most readers until 1984.

Prior to October 1984, the Library of Maynooth College occupied eight locations. Two of these had been principal locations: the Main Library, located in the building complex built by Pugin for the Seminary in the mid-nineteenth century, and the New Arts Library in the new campus, created in the middle of the twentieth century. A shortage of space in the Library and the lack of modern facilities led the college and its then President Monsignor Olden to build a new library from donations in Ireland and abroad, mainly the United States. The foundation stone of the new building was blessed by Pope John Paul II during his visit to Ireland in 1979 and in 1983 the John Paul II Library opened its doors. The former eight locations were reduced to three: the old &quot;Main Library&quot; became, in 1984, the Russell Library for old and rare books and manuscripts, the new John Paul II Library became the main working academic library, and a separate Chemistry Store for a surfeit of chemistry periodicals. In November 2010, the construction of an extension to the existing library began, which opened in 2012. It incorporated the former Chemistry Store, thus reducing the library locations to two.

===National Science Museum and Museum of Ecclesiology===

The museum in Maynooth College established in 1934 contains many items from the college&#x27;s history, including ecclesiastical artifacts and scientific apparatus such as that of the physicist Nicholas Callan. Nicholas Callan figure in the study of electromagnetism, inventing the induction coil and &quot;Maynooth Battery&quot;. Callan is buried in the college grounds. Apparatus associated with telegraphy, notably items used by Marconi are also stored in the Museum.

<doc id="765096" wikidata="Q2160833" url="?curid=765096" title="Rocky River (Ohio)">
<text>The Rocky River is a relatively short river in Cuyahoga County, Ohio that forms the natural western boundaries of Cleveland and the suburb of Lakewood with the suburbs of Fairview Park and Rocky River. The latter community is named after the river. To the south of Fairview Park and west of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, the river forms the natural boundary between the suburb of Brook Park and the communities of North Olmsted and Olmsted Township. Ranked by Field &amp; Stream as one of the top steelhead trout rivers in the world, the Rocky River is the center of the Rocky River Reservation of the Cleveland Metroparks.

==Watershed==
The river itself is formed by the confluence of the East and West Branches in North Olmsted at Cedar Point Hill (unrelated to the theme park of the same name north of Sandusky), just west of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.

The headwaters of the larger West Branch are predominantly located in Medina County, where the north and south branches merge to form the west branch and flow northward through, among other locales, the town of Olmsted Falls. The East Branch first begins in the Cleveland suburb of North Royalton, near State Rd. and Wallings Rd. The flow here is actually to the south, through Richfield and Hinckley Townships. The East Branch wraps around Whipp&#x27;s Ledges in Hinckley Township and begins its north-northwest journey. Hinckley Lake is actually the East Branch Rocky, impounded in the late 1920s/early 1930s. On its course back through southwestern Cuyahoga County, the East Branch is an important local feature in the cities of Strongsville and Berea.

The lower portions of both branches and the mainstem Rocky River flow through a V-shaped valley; the valley and the river are part of the Cleveland Metroparks system. The Rocky River valley is heavily forested, and a parkway along the river provides access to many different activities available in the park. Given the heavy population density of Cleveland and its older suburbs, many of which border the valley, the valley provides a popular location for recreational activities that would be difficult in other parts of the city.

===Pollution===
The Rocky River is largely free from industrial pollution. This is because most of its sources are in agricultural and suburban areas, which results in natural organic pollution and sewage, resulting in higher bacteria levels than rivers downstream from industrial discharges.

===Crossings and tributaries===
The Rocky River valley is quite deep from the confluence of the East and West Branches at Cedar Point downstream to Lake Erie, at times approaching below the ground level on either side of the valley. This depth has required several high-level and low-level bridges to cross the valley between Lakewood and Rocky River and between Cleveland and Fairview Park.

Several of the low-level bridges which cross the river within the valley are subject to closure and flooding during and after heavy storms, but these low-level bridges are mostly used by local traffic on the Valley Parkway which follows Rocky River&#x27;s course, and cross it several times.

<text>Álvaro del Portillo y Diez de Sollano (11 March 1914 – 23 March 1994) was a Spanish Catholic bishop and engineer who served as the prelate of Opus Dei between 1982 and 1994.

Church leaders Pope John Paul II and Cardinal Carlo Caffarra have praised Portillo as a faithful servant of God. John Paul II referred to him as a &quot;good and faithful servant&quot; while Caffarra dubbed him a &quot;disciple of Christ&quot;.

His cause of sainthood commenced on 21 January 2004 after being titled as a Servant of God. The confirmation of his heroic virtue on 28 June 2012 allowed for Pope Benedict XVI to name him as Venerable. He was beatified on 27 September 2014 in Madrid in a Mass that Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over on the behalf of Pope Francis.

==Life==

Alvaro del Portillo was born in Madrid on 11 March 1914. He was the third of eight children to the devout Ramón del Portillo Pardo and Clementina Diez de Solano Portillo; the couple had married on 11 January 1908. He was baptized on 17 March in the parish of Saint Joseph. He studied civil engineering and after obtaining his doctorate at the University of Madrid taught at its School of Engineering. He briefly worked with the Bureau of Highways and Bridges in the provinces crossed by the rivers Júcar, Duero and Ebro.

He received his Confirmation on 28 December 1916 from the Bishop of Siguenza Eustaquio Nieto y Martín and went on to receive his First Communion on 12 May 1921.

In 1935, he joined Opus Dei and was subsequently ordained to the priesthood on June 25, 1944 by Bishop Leopoldo Eijo y Garay of Madrid as one of the first three men ordained for Opus Dei He continued his studies to obtain a doctorate in Philosophy and Letters in history in 1944 from Central University of Madrid, with a dissertation entitled &quot;Discoveries and Exploration on the California Coast&quot;. In 1948 he earned a Doctorate in Canon Law from the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot;
He then dedicated himself exclusively to the ministry and government of Opus Dei as its Secretary General. During the pontificate of Pope Pius XII (1939–1958), he worked in several Dicasteries of the Holy See. He met with that pontiff in a private audience on 4 June 1943 and met with Giovanni Battista Montini (the future Pope Paul VI) on the following 17 June.

In 1963, he was named by Pope John XXIII as a consultant on the Pontifical Commission for the revision of the Code of Canon Law. Pope Paul VI named him consultant on several post-Conciliar commissions. In 1975, he was chosen general president of the Opus Dei and successor of Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer, and in 1982, the Holy See appointed him as the first Prelate of Opus Dei. In 1991, he was consecrated a bishop by Pope John Paul II, with Archbishops Giovanni Battista Re and Justin Francis Rigali serving as co-consecrators. That same year, he attended World Youth Day in Czestochowa.

He has written extensively about pastoral and ecclesiological matters that examine among others, the role of the lay faithful in the Roman Catholic Church, the human side of priestly formation, the dynamics and functionality of pastoral structures. As Prelate, he also served as Grand Chancellor of the University of Piura in Peru.

Shortly after his 80th birthday, he returned to Rome on a pilgrimage from the Holy Land. He died shortly thereafter. He had celebrated his last Mass at the Church of the Cenacle. Later that day, Pope John Paul II came to pray before del Portillo&#x27;s remains, which now lie in the crypt of the Church of the Prelature, Our Lady of Peace at Bruno Buozzi 75, Rome.

==Contribution to the Second Vatican Council==
The history of del Portillo&#x27;s involvement is as follows:

*May 2, 1959: named Consultor of the congregation of the Council;
* August 10, 1959: named President of the VII internal Commission De laicatu catholico;
* Named member of the pre-preparatory Commission on the states of perfection;
* August 12 elected member of the III Commission of the Congregation of the Council encharged to study the so-called peculiaria nostrae aetatis apostolatus media.
* October 4, 1962: named conciliar &quot;Peritus.&quot;
* November 4, 1962: named &quot;Peritus&quot; of the Commission for the Discipline of the Clergy and Christian People;
* November 8, 1962: named Secretary of this organism
* Named Consultor of the Commissions for the Bishops and the regime of the dioceses, the Religious and the Discipline of the Faith.
* September 29 – December 1963: during the Second Session of the Council, the Commission for the Discipline of the Clergy and the Christian People, of which D. Alvaro was Secretary, was charged to synthesize into a single conciliar decree (to become &quot;Presbyterorum Ordinis). He coordinated the work of the members of the Commission which became a conciliar text of a single chapter subdivided into 10 parts.

According to Salvador Bernal, his biographer: Del Portillo was the person who argued that there be a specific Decree for priests. Also one of the decisions of the Commission for the Discipline of the Clergy and the Christian People was &quot;defend centuries-old traditions against those who regarded them as mere pietism. It discussed the presence of the priest in the world, and why he needed a good formation in the basic human virtues in order to serve the men and women of his time. But it also warned that priests should not adopt lay lifestyles, much less take on commitments of a partisan political nature. Finally, it asserted the freedom to join associations which in one way or another could help them achieve personal sanctification in the carrying out of their priestly ministry.&quot;

&quot;Not a week had gone by after the close of the Council when Cardinal Ciriaci, president of the commission of which Don Alvaro had been secretary, sent him a note expressing heartfelt gratitude and congratulations for the happy conclusion of a great achievement.&quot; The note said: &quot;You steered to a safe harbor your decree, which is by no means the least important of the decrees and constitutions of the Council.&quot; The vote on the document was 2390 to 4, a nearly unanimous approval after thorough debate, on December 7, 1965. Ciriaci said: (History would regard this decree as) &quot;a fresh, and practically unanimous, confirmation by the Second Vatican Council of ecclesiastical celibacy and the exalted mission of the priesthood.&quot;

Pope Paul VI also commented on his work: &quot;I am well aware of the extent to which this is a result of your prudent, tenacious, and courteous efforts. Without failing to respect the freedom of others to have and to express their own opinions, you never swerved from the track of fidelity to the great principles of priestly spirituality.&quot;

==Veneration==

===Process===
On his death, John Paul II recalled del Portillo&#x27;s &quot;zealous priestly and episcopal life, the example he always gave of fortitude and of trust in divine providence and his fidelity to the See of Peter.&quot;

The then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger referred to del Portillo&#x27;s &quot;modesty and availability in every circumstance,&quot; in his work at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which del Portillo &quot;enriched in a singular way with his competence and experience.&quot;

On December 6, 2002, Javier Echevarria Rodriguez ordered an investigation into the cause for canonization of del Portillo.

In 2004, the Cardinal Vicar of Rome, Camillo Ruini, said &quot;The rather frequent occasions that I had to meet Bishop del Portillo imprinted on my soul the conviction that I found myself in the presence of an exemplary pastor.&quot; He added: &quot;In the firmness of his adherence to the doctrine of the Church, in his union with the Pope, in his pastoral charity, in his humility, and in his balance, he exhibited an extraordinary interior richness.&quot; According to the Cardinal, &quot;the service that Don Alvaro always provided to the Church of Rome and the prompt and effective way that he supported the Holy Father&#x27;s pastoral initiatives in this diocese showed the love of the Church that he had learned from St. Josemaría.&quot;

Ruini said that there is a desire for a &quot;quick beginning of this cause of canonization&quot; on the part of &quot;so many members of the ecclesiastical hierarchy and of the people of God.&quot; Also that there is &quot;an abundant store of testimonies of people who knew him, among them, those of quite a few cardinals and bishops,&quot; he said. He then added: &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Conference [of Italy] has unanimously expressed its favorable opinion&quot; on beginning the cause.

For the process, 133 witnesses were interviewed. Among them were 19 cardinals and 12 bishops or archbishops. 62 of the witnesses belong to the Prelature; 71 do not belong to it. The documentation submitted to the Vatican comprised 2,530 pages in three volumes.

===Venerable===
On June 28, 2012 — as approved by Pope Benedict XVI — the Vatican announced that his life had been recognized as one of &quot;heroic virtue&quot;, a major step towards an eventual beatification. From this time on, del Portillo was styled &quot;Venerable Servant of God&quot;.

===Beatification===
On July 5, 2013 Pope Francis published a decree from the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints declaring the miraculous character of a cure of a Chilean boy attributed to the intercession of the del Portillo. Del Portillo was beatified on September 27, 2014 in his birth city of Madrid by Cardinal Angelo Amato, prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints. May 12 was appointed as his feast day. The former Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, Cardinal Angelo Amato, described his holiness as part of the transformation of the world.

===Excerpts from his works===
&quot;Authentic joy is based on this foundation: that we want to live for God and want to serve others because of God. Let us tell the Lord that we want nothing more than to serve him with joy. If we behave in this way we shall find that our inner peace, our joy, our good humour will attract many souls to God. Give witness to Christian joy. Show to those around you that this is our great secret. We are happy because we are children of God, because we deal with him, because we struggle to become better for him. And when we fail, we go right away to the Sacrament of joy where we recover our sense of fraternity with all men and women.&quot; Homily, 12 Apr 1984; quoted by Francis Fernandez Carvajal in &quot;In Conversation With God&quot;, vol.5, p. 155

<text>George Browne Post (December15, 1837November28, 1913) was an American architect trained in the Beaux-Arts tradition. Active from 1869 almost until his death, he was recognized as a master of several contemporary American architectural genres, and played a role in the birth of the skyscraper. He was President of the American Institute of Architects from 1896 to 1898.

Many of his most characteristic projects were for commercial buildings where new requirements pushed the traditional boundaries of design. Many of the buildings he designed have been demolished, since their central locations in New York and other cities made them vulnerable to rebuilding in the twentieth century. Some of his lost buildings were regarded as landmarks of their era. His sons, who had been taken into the firm in 1904, continued after his death as George B. Post and Sons until 1930.

== Early life and education ==
Post was born on December 15, 1837, in Manhattan, New York, to Joel Browne Post and Abby Mauran Church. After graduating from New York University in 1858 with a degree in civil engineering, Post became a student of Richard Morris Hunt from 1858 to 1860. In 1860, he formed a partnership with a fellow student in Hunt&#x27;s office, Charles D. Gambrill, with a brief hiatus for service in the Civil War.

== Career ==
=== Military service ===
Post served in the American Civil War under General Burnside at the Battle of Fredericksburg and later rose to the rank of colonel in the New York National Guard.

=== Architect ===
In 1867, Post founded his own architectural firm which expanded in 1904 when two of his sons, J. Otis and William Stone joined him to form become &quot;George B. Post and Sons.&quot;

Post served as the sixth president of the American Institute of Architects from 1896 to 1899. He also trained architect Arthur Bates Jennings.

Post designed many of the prominent private homes in various places, with many concentrated in New York City and Bernardsville, NJ. He also designed many prominent commercial and public buildings.

A true member of the American Renaissance, Post engaged notable artists and artisans to add decorative sculpture and murals to his architectural designs. Among those who worked with Post were the sculptor Karl Bitter and painter Elihu Vedder. Post was a founding member of the National Arts Club, serving as the club&#x27;s inaugural president from 1898 to 1905. In 1905, his two sons were taken into the partnership, and they continued to lead the firm after Post&#x27;s death, notably as the designers of many Statler Hotels in cities across the United States. From that time forward, the firm carried on under the stewardship of Post&#x27;s grandson, Edward Everett Post (1904–2006) until the late twentieth century.

Sarah Landau&#x27;s publication &quot;George B. Post, Architect: Picturesque Designer and Determined Realist&quot; (1998) inspired a retrospective exhibition in 1998–99 to revisit Post&#x27;s work at the Society. In 2014, curator, architect George Ranalli presented an exhibition of Post&#x27;s drawings and photographs of the design of the City College of New York&#x27;s main campus buildings, on loan from the New-York Historical Society.

Post received the AIA Gold Medal in 1911. His extensive archive is in the collection at the New-York Historical Society.

==== Private residences ====
The Cornelius Vanderbilt II House, which Post designed in partnership with Richard Morris Hunt, was an English Jacobethan Gothic red-brick and limestone chateau that stood at the corner of East 57th Street and Fifth Avenue and was one of the most opulent single-family homes of its time. It featured a lavishly scrolled cast-iron gate forged in Paris (now in Central Park), sculptural reliefs by Karl Bitter (now in the Sherry-Netherland Hotel), an ornate reddish-brown marble fireplace sculpted by Augustus Saint-Gaudens (now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art), and elaborate interior decoration by Frederick Kaldenberg, John LaFarge, Philip Martiny, Frederick W. MacMonnies, Rene de Quelin, and Augustus Saint-Gaudens and his brother Julius. The mansion was razed in 1927 for the construction of the Bergdorf Goodman Building at 754 Fifth Avenue. The mansion was photographed by Albert Levy while being built.

Post also designed the palazzo across the street that faced the Vanderbilt Mansion for Collis P. Huntington (1889–94). In Newport, Rhode Island, he built a home for the president of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, C.C. Baldwin, &quot;Chateau-Nooga&quot; or the Baldwin Cottage (1879–80), a polychromatic exercise in the &quot;Quaint Style&quot; with bargeboards and half-timbering; John La Farge provided stained glass panels.

Post also designed many of the gilded-age mansions found in Bernardsville, NJ and was credited more than anyone with selling wealthy New Yorkers on the idea of establishing a country home in the Somerset Hills. He designed Kenilwood—a grand home built in 1896–1897 as a wedding gift for his son—and an excellent residential example of Gothic Revival architecture in America. Kenilwood remained in the Post family until it was purchased by Mike Tyson in 1988.

==== Public buildings ====
Post also designed more staid public and semi-public structures including the New York Stock Exchange Building, the New York Times Building, the Bronx Borough Hall and the Wisconsin State Capitol.

In 1893, Post was named to the architectural staff of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois, by Burnham and Root, where he designed the Manufactures and Liberal Arts Building.

In 1894, Post, along with J. Herbert Ballantine, Robert L. Stevens, and Edward T. H. Talmadge each pledged $8,000 to purchase land in Bernardsville, New Jersey, to establish the Somerset Hills Country Club, which, after being built on the banks of Ravine Lake was relocated in 1917 to its present site and includes a golf course designed by A.W. Tillinghast.

Many of Post&#x27;s design&#x27;s were landmarks of the era. Post&#x27;s Equitable Life Building (1868–70), was the first office building designed to use passenger elevators; Post himself leased the upper floors when contemporaries predicted they could not be rented. His Western Union Telegraph Building (1872–75) at Dey Street in Lower Manhattan, was the first office building to rise as high as ten stories, a forerunner of skyscrapers to come. Post&#x27;s twenty-story New York World Building (1889–90) was the tallest building in New York City when it was erected in &quot;Newspaper Row&quot; facing City Hall Park.

== Personal life ==
Post married Alice Matilda Stone (1840–1909) on October 14, 1863. Together, they had five children: George Browne, Jr., William Stone, Allison Wright, James Otis and Alice Winifred.

Post died on November 28, 1913, in Bernardsville, New Jersey. He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City.

<doc id="765108" wikidata="Q1912943" url="?curid=765108" title="Tallong, New South Wales">
<text>Tallong is in the traditional lands of the Gundungurra people. It is a village east of the Great Dividing Range and is located in the Southern Highlands region of New South Wales, Australia, in Goulburn-Mulwaree Council. At the , the village had a population of 914. The town is 8.5 km from the town of Marulan and 25 km from the town of Bundanoon.

The principal industries of the village include stud farms, arts and crafts and services for surrounding farms.

Tallong is home to the Tallong Midge Orchid (&quot;Genoplesium plumosum&quot;), a tiny flower found only in the area surrounding the town. This orchid is now a protected species. It was discovered in 1997.

== Etymology ==

The original settlement was named Barber&#x27;s Creek after the watercourse that runs through the town. In the early twentieth century the town was renamed &quot;Tallong&quot; after an Aboriginal word meaning either &quot;tongue&quot; or &quot;spring of water&quot;.

==History==

=== Colonial era ===
The first European settler in the area was George Barber, a cattle farmer. In 1814 Barber established a cattle station along what became known as Barber&#x27;s Creek. In 1821 he received a grant of covering the general Tallong-Marulan district, to be converted from cedar brush to farmland. Before his death in a riding accident in 1844, Barber had extended his local landholdings to , which he named &quot;Glenrock&quot;. He is buried in the Old Marulan Cemetery in Marulan.

In the late 1820s, that portion of Barber&#x27;s land that would eventually become the township was sold or reallocated to Sydney entrepreneur and mariner Billy Blue. Convict labour was used to clear the grazing land and prepare a route for the Main South railway line to Goulburn. Tallong was selected as the location for a railway refuelling point, and the town&#x27;s initial population consisted of convicts, woodcutters, railway workers and their families.

The opening of the railway in 1869 brought shops, a school, hotels and a post office to the town.

=== Post-Federation ===
By 1900, cattle grazing was slowly giving way to a thriving fruit industry, known particularly for apples and pears. The village sent an annual exhibit of a tall pyramid of fruit to the Sydney Royal Easter Show; Tallong&#x27;s apples and pears took top honours several times throughout the early part of the twentieth century.

The population reached 200 in 1920, and a Memorial Hall was constructed to mark the town&#x27;s growth and record the service of local residents in World War I. The Hall and war memorial are still standing today.

In 1955 the Australian poet and novelist Seaforth Mackenzie drowned while attempting to swim across Tallong (formerly Barber&#x27;s) Creek near the town.

Tallong was destroyed in the Chatsbury bushfire of 1965. Its economy did not fully recover and the award-winning fruit industry folded. Many residents moved and the post office and a number of small businesses closed.

== Heritage listings ==
Tallong has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Main Southern railway: Tallong railway station

== Attractions ==
The village is also home to one of the oldest surviving single-teacher schoolhouses in Australia at Tallong Public School. Moreover, it is home to the country campus of Santa Sabina College.

Furthermore, the village is home to two lookouts on the plateau that makes up the Shoalhaven Gorge (a which looks over the drop to the Shoalhaven River) and Morton National Park. The lookouts are known as&quot; Badgerys Lookout&quot; and &quot;Longpoint Lookout&quot;.

Tallong is home to the big apple and host to the award-winning annual &quot;Apple Day&quot; festival although the festival was cancelled for 2024.

There is also an annual Tallong Trail Ride in support of the Rural Fire Service.

<doc id="765116" wikidata="Q510522" url="?curid=765116" title="Hendrik Potgieter">
<text>Andries Hendrik Potgieter, known as Hendrik Potgieter (19 December 1792 – 16 December 1852) was a Voortrekker leader. He served as the first head of state of Potchefstroom from 1840 and 1845 and also as the first head of state of Zoutpansberg from 1845 to 1852.

==Beyond the Orange River==
Potgieter and his party moved inland to the present Free State, where they signed a treaty with the leader of the Barolong, Moroka. The treaty stipulated that Potgieter would protect the Baralong against the Matabele raiders, in exchange for land. The tract of land was from the Vet River to the Vaal River.

The Matabele leader, Mzilikazi, was threatened by the white incursion into what he saw as his sphere of influence, which led to the Matabele&#x27;s attack on the Potgieter laager in October 1836, at Vegkop, near the present-day town of Heilbron. The attack was beaten off, but the Matabele made off with most of the trekker oxen, crucial draught animals for the wagons. The combined trek groups of Piet Retief and Gerrit Maritz came to Potgieter&#x27;s rescue. Moroka also helped with oxen. His group joined up with Retief and Maritz at Thaba Nchu, where they formed a Voortrekker government and decided to move to Natal. Potgieter was not in favour of this plan and stayed behind in the Free State.

==Dingane campaign==
In 1838, after Piet Retief and his party were killed by Dingane, and other Voortrekker parties were attacked (Weenen massacre) at the Bloukrans and Bushman Rivers, Potgieter and another leader, Pieter Lafras Uys assembled a military force. To prevent schism and discord, the new Voortrekker leader in Natal, Maritz, diplomatically pronounced that both Uys and Potgieter were to be in command. However, a struggle between the hot-headed Uys and Potgieter ensued.

The divided force was lured into an ambush by the Zulus at Italeni, and both Uys and his son Dirkie, were killed. The surrounded and outnumbered force fled. Potgieter was criticised for his actions, and the force was called &quot;Die Vlugkommado&quot; or Flight Commando. He was further accused, unjustly, of causing the death of Uys by deliberately leading the force into the ambush. He left Natal for good soon afterwards and moved to the Transvaal.

==Transvaal settlements==
Potgieter subsequently went on to found Potchefstroom (named after him), by the banks of the Mooi River, and served as its first head of state of the Potchefstroom Republic between 1840 and 1845. Later, in 1845, he also founded Ohrigstad (originally named Andries-Ohrigstad after Potgieter himself and George Ohrig) as a trading station. Owing to a malaria outbreak, the town had to be abandoned. The inhabitants, including Potgieter, moved to the Soutpansberg area, where he founded the town Zoutpansbergdorp (which means &#x27;Salt Pan Mountain Town&#x27;), later renamed Schoemansdal.

After the 1842 annexation of Natal by Britain, many Natal Trekkers moved to the Free State and the Transvaal. These newcomers and their leader, Andries Pretorius, refused to accept the authority of Potgieter, and a power struggle developed. War was averted, and in 1848 a peace treaty was signed in Rustenburg 

In 1852 after the sand river convention with king Moshoeshoe the Boers had access to the Transvaal, In 1852 Hendrik Potgieter led a Boer expedition against Transvaal Ndebele chief Mankopane Mapela Langa which was fatal for the Boers and saw them leave mokopane for zoutpansburg they would later return to mokopane during 1800s and amended their issues with the local kings Masebe iii Langa and Mokopane ii Kekana with the help of Paul Kruger who negotiated a peace treaty with Mankopane &amp; Mokopane in 1869. The missionaries and the Boers would go on to establish mokopane. In 1907 the city was renamed potigieterus in honor of the battles between the locals and Boers. 

In 1852 again Hendrick led another commando against King Sekwati’s forces. The Boers besieged the Pedi stronghold, hoping they would run out of food and water. But they managed to maintain themselves by sending young warriors to steal through the Boer lines at night. On the twenty-fourth day, the Boers departed with the Pedi cattle. Potgieter died on 16 December 1852 in Zoutpansbergdorp. A number of African chiefs who held him in very high regard came to pay their respects before his death.

He was elected to Volksraad, and served several times as the Chairman of Volksraad.

<text>Pieter Johannes &quot;Piet&quot; Potgieter (1822 – 1854) was a South African Boer political figure. He was the acting head of state of Zoutpansberg from 1852 to 1854, and the first son of voortrekker Andries Potgieter.

He married Elsie Maria Aletta van Heerden, who later married Stephanus Schoeman, a subsequent leader of The Republic of Zoutpansberg, and acting president of the South African Republic. The town Piet Potgietersrust, now Mokopane, was named in Potgieter&#x27;s memory in 1907.

==Leader of Zoutpansberg==
When Andries Hendrik Potgieter died in 1852, he left his son, cmdt.genl. Piet Potgieter, in charge of the Zoutpansbergdorp. Potgieter had a short tenure, as he soon died in a campaign against tribal leader Mgombane ka Gegana.

In September 1854 Piet&#x27;s uncle, field cornet Hermanus Potgieter (Groot Hermaans), was searching for ivory near the Nyl River, an area ruled by chiefs Makapan and Mankopane (also: Mapela or Mapele). For reasons imperfectly known, the chiefs decided to massacre them and other unrelated white travellers. The act claimed the lives of 28 white settlers, and the Potchefstroom governance authorized a punitive commando under the command of Piet Potgieter and M. W. Pretorius. The tribesmen retreated into Makapansgat cave, where they were to suffer heavy casualties. One of their snipers however managed to fatally shoot Piet Potgieter. Potgieter was the only Boer casualty of the campaign, but his death brought an end to his family&#x27;s hegemony in the north.

==Descendants==
The family was the starting point of an influential South-Africa lineage. The Potgieters&#x27; daughter Elsie Maria Aletta married reverend Ds. J H M Stofberg, the secretary and head of the NG Church in South-Africa, after ex president Schoeman granted his blessing. They had two children of which one became a political figure through the South-African Broederbond and a member of the executive committee of the National Party, Dr. Pieter Johannes Potgieter Stofberg. National Party Minister Hendrik Schoeman was also closely related to this family.

<text>Oskar Potiorek (20 November 1853 – 17 December 1933) was an officer of the Austro-Hungarian Army, who served as Governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1911 to 1914. He was a passenger in the car carrying Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife Duchess Sophie of Hohenberg when they were assassinated in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914. Potiorek had failed to inform the driver of a change of route which led the royal car to take a wrong turn, stalling after trying to turn around, and ending up in front of Gavrilo Princip. In World War I, Potiorek commanded the Austro-Hungarian forces in the failed Serbian campaign of 1914. He was removed from command, retiring from the army shortly afterward.

== Early life ==
The Potiorek family had Czech origin, the family moved from Bohemia to Carinthia before the birth of Oskar. His father, Paul Potiorek decided to move to Carinthia after he was appointed as a chief inspector of mines in Bad Bleiberg. Oskar Potiorek was born in Bad Bleiberg on 20 November, 1853. On September 1, 1871, he was commissioned as an officer. He entered military service in the 2nd technical regiment (Genieregiment) with the rank of lieutenant, where he was promoted to first lieutenant on May 1, 1873. Oskar attended the Imperial and Royal Military Institute of Technology and the &quot;Kriegsschule&quot; academy in Vienna. He was promoted to Captain on 1 May 1879 and in 1883 he served with the 17th Infantry Regiment. From 1886 he was again in the General Staff, in the Office of Operations and Special Staff Activities. Here he was promoted to the rank of Major on 1 May 1887 and Lieutenant Colonel on 1 November 1889. In 1890 he was transferred to the 7th Infantry Regiment for troop duty, in 1891 he was again transferred to the General Staff, in 1892 he was promoted to colonel and appointed head of the Office of Operations and Special Activities. On 1 May 1898, he was appointed commander of the 64th Infantry Brigade in Budapest with the rank of Major General. He was appointed deputy chief by Emperor Franz Joseph in 1902. However, the emperor ignored his ambitions, when in 1906 he filled the post of chief of staff with &quot;Feldmarschall-Leutnant&quot; Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf at the behest of heir presumptive and deputy commander-in-chief Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Potiorek became commanding general at Graz, Styria, in the rank of a &quot;Feldzeugmeister&quot;. Serving as inspector general in Sarajevo in 1910, he was appointed Bosnian governor (&quot;Landeschef&quot;) the next year, holding both civil and military offices. 

He kept command of III Corps until April 1910, when he handed it over to Lieutenant General Karl Schikofsky.

Potiorek did his utmost to replace Conrad, his long-time rival. However his efforts were only partially successful: In 1911, when Franz Joseph replaced Conrad as Chief of the General Staff, but the Emperor appointed Lieutenant General Blasius Schemua as Chief of General Staff, and then Conrad again on 12 December 1912, in the middle of the Serbian crisis. The rivalry and antipathy between the two high rank officers had serious consequences during the Serbian campaigns in the autumn of 1914.

In 1913 Potiorek invited Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie, to watch his troops on maneuvers scheduled for 26 and 27 June 1914. An attack on the life of former governor Marijan Varešanin in 1910 and several rumours of future assaults (leaked by Serbian prime minister Nikola Pašić) did not keep the archduke from a public appearance in Sarajevo, backed by Potiorek, who worried about his own prestige.

== Assassination of Archduke Ferdinand ==

On 28 June the royal couple arrived from Ilidža by train and went to Philipovic army camp where Franz Ferdinand performed a brief review of the troops. Potiorek was waiting to take the royal party to the city hall (present-day National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina) for the official reception. Franz Ferdinand, his wife and several officials switched into a six-car motorcade driving down Appel Quay along Miljacka River without further security measures. Potiorek was in the third car, a Gräf &amp; Stift &quot;Double Phaeton&quot;, open six-seater driven by Leopold Lojka, together with the owner Count Harrach and the royal couple. At 10:10, when the vehicles passed the central police station, assassin Nedeljko Čabrinović hurled a hand grenade at the archduke&#x27;s car. Lojka accelerated when he saw the object flying towards the car, the grenade bounced off the coachwork and exploded under the wheel of the next car, wounding two passengers and several spectators.

A furious Franz Ferdinand, after attending the official reception at the City Hall, asked about visiting the members of his party that had been wounded by the bomb. A member of the archduke&#x27;s staff, Andreas von Morsey, according to his own accounts suggested this might be dangerous, but Potiorek replied &quot;Do you think Sarajevo is full of assassins? I will take responsibility&quot;. Nevertheless, the governor decided that the royal car should travel on an alternative route to the Sarajevo hospital. However, he failed to tell the driver about this decision. On the way to the hospital, Lojka took a right turn opposite the Latin Bridge, where one of the conspirators, Gavrilo Princip, was standing outside the corner delicatessen at the time. The assassin had already abandoned his plans, but when he saw the driver begin to back up the car right in front of him, he stepped forward, drew his gun, and at a distance of about four or five paces, fired two shots into the car. Franz Ferdinand was hit in the neck and Sophie in the abdomen. Neither Potiorek, Count Harrach nor Leopold Lojka were injured. Princip later claimed that the bullet that killed Sophie was meant for the governor.

== After Ferdinand&#x27;s assassination ==
Following the assassination, Potiorek organized and stimulated anti-Serb riots in Sarajevo. Potiorek reestablished an auxiliary militia, the Schutzkorps, to implement the policy of anti-Serb repression. Schutzkorps, predominantly recruited among Bosniak population, were involved in the persecution of people of Serb ethnicity particularly in Serb populated areas of eastern Bosnia. Around 5,500 ethnic Serbs were arrested in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Between 700 and 2,200 died in prison while 460 were executed. Around 5,200 Serb families were forcibly expelled from Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Despite his responsibility, Potiorek remained in office. When the assassination and the succeeding July Crisis led to the outbreak of World War I, he became the commander of the Balkanstreitkräfte (Balkan Armed Forces). It is speculated that this &quot;survivor&#x27;s guilt&quot; led Potiorek to take charge of the Austro-Hungarian army and lead the first mission to &quot;punish&quot; Serbia. He was reportedly very zealous in his actions (multiple times he claimed &quot;I was spared at Sarajevo so that I may die avenging it!&quot;), but was apparently an inept commander. The small Royal Serbian Army remained undefeated in all major battles and after the textbook military disasters at the Battle of Cer and the Battle of Kolubara with huge numbers of casualties, he was removed from command on 22 December 1914 and replaced by Archduke Eugen of Austria, a choice that reportedly made him suicidal.

==Death and legacy==

Potiorek retired to Carinthian Klagenfurt, where he died in 1933. He is buried in the cemetery of the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt.

<text>The Combat Infantryman Badge (CIB) is a United States Army military decoration. The badge is awarded to infantrymen and Special Forces soldiers in the rank of colonel and below, who fought in active ground combat while assigned as members of either an Infantry or Special Forces unit of brigade size or smaller at any time after 6 December 1941. For those soldiers who are not members of an infantry, or Special Forces unit, the Combat Action Badge (CAB) is awarded instead. For soldiers with an MOS in the medical field they would, with the exception of a Special Forces Medical Sergeant (18D), receive the Combat Medical Badge. 18D Special Forces Medics would receive the Combat Infantryman badge instead.

The CIB and its non-combat contemporary, the Expert Infantryman Badge (EIB), were created in November 1943 during World War II to boost morale and increase the prestige of service in the Infantry. Specifically, it recognizes the inherent sacrifices of all infantrymen, and that they face a greater risk of being wounded or killed in action than any other military occupational specialties.

==History==
After the United States&#x27; declaration of war in 1941, the War Department had difficulty in recruiting soldiers into the Infantry branch in the case when men were given the opportunity to choose their branch of assignment, and the morale of soldiers in the Infantry Branch remained low, namely due to the fact that &quot;[o]f all Soldiers [&quot;sic&quot;], it was recognized that the infantryman continuously operated under the worst conditions and performed a mission that was not assigned to any other Soldier [&quot;sic&quot;] or unit ... [t]he infantry, a small portion of the total Armed Forces, was suffering the most casualties while receiving the least public recognition.&quot; Lt. Gen. Lesley J. McNair, commanding officer of the U.S. Army Ground Forces, championed the idea of creating an award recognizing the unique dangers faced by infantrymen.

On 27 October 1943, the War Department formally established the Combat Infantryman Badge (CIB) and the Expert Infantryman Badge (EIB) awards in Section I, War Department Circular 269:

Moreover, War Department Circular 269 stipulated: &quot;...only one of these badges will be worn at one time&quot; and &quot;the Combat Infantryman badge is the highest award&quot;; the awarding of the CIB was officially authorized with an executive order dated 15 November 1943; later, on 30 June 1944, the U.S. Congress approved an extra ten dollars in monthly pay to every infantryman awarded the CIB—excepting commissioned officers. The World War II regulations did not formally prescribe a specific combat service period establishing the infantryman&#x27;s eligibility for being awarded a Combat Infantryman Badge, thus, in 1947, the U.S. government implemented a policy authorizing the retroactive awarding of the Bronze Star Medal to World War II veteran soldiers who had been awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge, because the CIB was awarded only to soldiers who had borne combat duties befitting the recognition conferred by a Bronze Star Medal. Both awards required a commander&#x27;s recommendation and a citation in the pertinent orders. General Marshall initiated this after Medal of Honor–recipient Major Charles W. Davis noted to him that: &quot;It would be wonderful, if someone could design a badge for every infantryman who faces the enemy, every day and every night, with so little recognition&quot;.

War Department Circular 105, dated 13 March 1944 amended WD Circular 269. Page 2, paragraph IV. BADGE – Section 1, Circular No. 269 War Department, 1943, is amended by adding paragraph 8 as follows:

8. Retroactive award of Expert and Combat Infantryman badges may be awarded to any infantryman who, on or after 6 December 1941, has established eligibility and been recommended for such award under the provisions of paragraph 2b or paragraph 3b. The Expert Infantryman badge may be awarded under paragraph 2a, only to those infantryman who have established eligibility and been recommended for such award on or after 27 October 1943.

From the beginning, Army leaders have taken care to retain the badge for the unique purpose for which it was established and to prevent the adoption of any other badge that would lower its prestige. At the close of World War II, the largest war in which armor and artillery played key roles in the ground campaigns, a review was conducted of the CIB criteria with consideration being given to creating either additional badges or authorizing the badge to cavalry and armor units. The review noted that any change in policy would detract from the prestige of the badge.

==Eligibility requirements==
A soldier must meet the following requirements to be awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge:
# Be an infantryman satisfactorily performing infantry duties
# Assigned to an infantry unit during such time as the unit is engaged in active ground combat
# Actively participate in such ground combat

Campaign or battle credit alone is not sufficient for award of the CIB. The specific eligibility criteria for the CIB require that an officer (SSI 11 or 18) in the grade of colonel or below, or an Army enlisted soldier or warrant officer with an infantry or Special Forces MOS, who subsequent to 6 December 1941 has satisfactorily performed duty while assigned or attached as a member of an infantry, ranger or special forces unit of brigade, regimental, or smaller size during any period such unit was engaged in active ground combat. Eligibility also includes soldiers or officers with an MOS other than infantry or Special Forces that hold a prior or secondary infantry or Special Forces MOS and that are assigned or temporarily attached to an infantry unit of any size smaller than a brigade. Eligibility for Special Forces personnel in Military Occupational Specialties (MOS) 18B, 18C, 18E, 18F, and 18Z (less Special Forces medical sergeant) accrues from 20 December 1989. Retroactive awards of the CIB to Special Forces personnel are not authorized prior to 20 December 1989. A recipient must be personally present and under hostile fire while serving in an assigned infantry or Special Forces primary duty, in a unit actively engaged in ground combat with the enemy. The unit in question can be of any size smaller than brigade.

On or after 18 September 2001: a soldier must be an Army infantry or special forces officer (SSI 11 or 18) in the grade of Colonel or below, or an Army enlisted soldier or warrant officer with an infantry or special forces MOS, who has satisfactorily performed duty while assigned or attached as a member of an infantry, ranger or special forces unit of brigade, regimental, or smaller size during any period such unit was engaged in active ground combat. A soldier must be personally present and under fire while serving in an assigned infantry or Special Forces primary duty, in a unit engaged in active ground combat, to close with and destroy the enemy with direct fires. Army soldiers possessing MOS of 18D (Special Forces Medical Sergeant) who satisfactorily perform special forces duties while assigned or attached to a special forces unit of brigade, regimental, or smaller size during any period such unit was engaged in active ground combat may be awarded the CIB. These soldiers must have been personally present and engaged in active ground combat, to close with and destroy the enemy with direct fires. Retroactive awards under these criteria are not authorized for service prior to 18 September 2001. Those soldiers possessing MOS of 18D who qualify for award of the CMB from 18 September 2001 to 3 June 2005 will remain qualified for the badge.

==Qualifying conflicts, operations and periods==

The CIB is authorized for award for the following qualifying wars, conflicts, and operations. A separate award of the CIB has been authorized for qualified soldiers in the following qualifying periods:

*World War II (7 December 1941 to 3 September 1945)
*Korean War (27 June 1950 to 27 July 1953)
*Vietnam War and other operations (2 March 1961 to 10 March 1995)
** Vietnam War (2 March 1961 to 28 March 1973) combined with qualifying service in Laos (19 April 1961 to 6 October 1962)
** Dominican Republic (28 April 1965 to 1 September 1966)
** South Korea on the demilitarized zone (DMZ) (4 January 1969 to 31 March 1994)
** El Salvador (1 January 1981 to 1 February 1992)
** Grenada (23 October to 21 November 1983)
** Joint Security Area, Panmunjom, South Korea (23 November 1984)
** Panama (20 December 1989 to 31 January 1990)
** South West Asia Conflict (Operation Desert Storm) (17 January to 11 April 1991)
** Somalia (5 June 1993 to 31 March 1994)
*Global War on Terrorism (18 September 2001 to 30 August 2021)
**Afghanistan (OEF, 18 September 2001 to 31 December 2014; OFS, 1 January 2015 to a date to be determined)
**Iraq (OIF, 19 March 2003 to 31 August 2010; OND, 1 September 2010 to 31 December 2011)
**Iraq &amp; Syria (OIR, 15 June 2014 to a date to be determined)

NOTE: Subsequent awards of the CIB are &quot;not authorized&quot; for the same qualifying period, as outlined above. Subsequent awards of the CIB may be awarded provided the soldier has met eligibility criteria in separate Qualifying Periods/Eras. For example, a second award with superimposed star on the wreath could be awarded for a soldier who served in Somalia (3rd Qualifying Era) and OEF (4th Qualifying Era).

In the Korean War: The special requirements for award of the CIB for service in South Korea are rescinded. Army veterans and Service members who served in South Korea on or after 28 July 1953 and meet the criteria for award of the CIB may submit an application (to include supporting documentation) for award of the CIB.

==Badge design==
The original, World War II–model CIB was a silver and enamel badge, consisting of a rectangular bar with an infantry-blue field upon which is superimposed a Springfield Arsenal Musket, Model 1795. The composite device is superimposed to an elliptic oak-leaf wreath, symbolizing steadfast character, strength, and loyalty. During World War II, there existed metallic, composite models of the CIB composed of a separate EIB rectangle-badge and oak-leaf wreath that then was pinned to the blouse, as a Combat Infantryman Badge. Later, a matte-black subdued metal badge was created for wearing on the fatigues in the field. Since World War II, the CIB has been made in cloth (colored and subdued) for wear, like the matte-metal model, on the fatigue field uniform, and, a miniature ( long) lacquered-metal CIB model is available for wearing on the mess dress uniform and civilian clothes.

On 8 February 1952, the Army approved the addition of stars to the CIB indicating the soldier&#x27;s having fought in more than one war. The first was the second-award CIB recognizing Korean War combat operations; in that time, the U.S. Army&#x27;s Institute of Heraldry also had created eighth-award CIB designs. The second- through fourth-award CIB awards were indicated with silver five-point stars, one to three stars centered, at badge&#x27;s top, between the tips of the oak-leaf wreath; the fifth- through eighth-awards of the CIB were indicated with gold stars. However, Army Regulation 600-8-22 (Military Awards) only authorizes up to three awards of the CIB. There are four periods for which an award of the badge can be made:

:# World War II (7 December 1941 to 3 September 1945)
:# Korean War (27 June 1950 to 27 July 1953)
:# Vietnam War and other Cold War era actions (2 March 1961 to 10 March 1995)
:# War on Terror (18 September 2001 to a date to be determined)

Currently, the Combat Infantryman Badge is worn above the service ribbons above the left-breast pocket of the Class-A uniform coat and of the other uniforms with which the CIB is authorized. As of June 2011, the badge and its sew-on equivalent may be worn on the Army Combat Uniform (ACU).

==Three-time recipients==
In 1984, the National Infantry Museum at Fort Benning, Georgia, unveiled two plaques listing over 200 soldiers who had received the Combat Infantryman Badge three times. The ceremony was presided over by Lieutenant General David E. Grange Jr., Fort Benning&#x27;s commander from 1979 to 1981 and a three-time CIB recipient himself, as well as the fort&#x27;s then-commander, Major General John W. Foss. A new exhibit, featuring 325 names, was unveiled on October 23, 2012.

Because the gap between the second (Korean War) and fourth (War on Terror) periods of eligibility is more than forty-eight years, longer than any likely career as an infantryman, all three-time CIB recipients served in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War.

==Master Infantryman Badge==

In late 2024 it was reported that &quot;master combat badges&quot; would debut in Spring 2025; the Master Infantryman Badge, Master Medical Badge, and Master Soldier Badge. The badges would represent those who have earned both a combat badge (CIB, CMB, or CAB) and an expert badge (EIB, EFMB, or ESB). The proposed &quot;master badges&quot; are alleged to appear identical to their respective combat badges, replacing the silver wreaths on the full-color metal badges with gold wreaths; subdued pin-on badges and sew-on badges would see their black wreaths also replaced with gold. Soldiers that had earned a combat badge but a &quot;separate&quot; expert badge (a CIB and an EFMB, for example) would wear the master badge aligning with their combat badge (in the case of a CIB and an EFMB, the awardee would wear the Master Infantryman Badge). As of 03 2025, no official announcement has been made concerning the badges.

<doc id="765131" wikidata="Q16241952" url="?curid=765131" title="Cahuilla mythology">
<text>For the Cahuillas, cosmological values and concepts were established when the world was created by Mukat. The Cahuilla creation story tells of the origin of the world, the death of god (Mukat), and the consequences of that death for humans (e.g., the need for death, social roles, and so forth). It also describes the basic concepts of supernatural power and its proper use in the contemporary world.

At the beginning of creation, all creatures were said to be much larger than they were today. These were called &quot;nukatem&quot;. Over time, the nukatem stopped being active and shrank, turning into natural objects such as mirages, rainbows, earth and other things.

==Deities==
* Kutya&#x27;i – Spirit of wind, mischievous, nocturnal, steals clothing.
* Menily – Lunar deity
* Mukat – Creator.
* Muut – Psychopomp, often depicted as an owl.
* Pemtemweha – Protector of animals, often seen as a white deer.
* Sungrey – Medicine, founded the spring Agua Caliente (Hot Water) in the desert.
* Taqwus – A trickster god, he comes out at night to steal souls and cause mischief.

==Creation==
The creation myth of the Cahuilla is fairly expansive, such that almost all of their mythological figures and norms are included in the tale. In the creation, Mukat and Temayuwat were born from the union of twin balls of lightning, which were the manifestations of &quot;Amnaa&quot; (Power) and &quot;Tukmiut&quot; (Night). Mukat and Temayuwat began a creative contest, in which Temayuwat was bested and fled with his ill-formed creation below the earth.

Mukat taught his people the art of fighting with a bow and arrow, which incurred their displeasure. On account of this, they consorted with the Frog to bewitch him. Upon his death, he taught the people mourning ceremonies and a proper form of funerary ritual (by cremation). Along with initiatory rites during puberty, these rites form the essential corpus of Cahuilla religious observance.

==Ritual cremation==
The Cahuilla response to death was a six night affair intended to mark the passing of a member of the community and put an end to grief. The Cahuilla seem to have had a practical view of death that included it as a necessary component of their world. It was held annually during the winter months, and its date fluctuated according to supplies and internal factors.

Commonly, these rites took place in a large structure called the &quot;kis-amnawut&quot; (roughly translated as house power-great)). The ritual for the dead was interwoven with other aspects of Cahuilla life; it wasn&#x27;t until the fourth day of the mourning ritual, for example, that infants of the tribe would be publicly named.

<doc id="765133" wikidata="Q1032414" url="?curid=765133" title="Canadian Soccer Association">
<text>The Canadian Soccer Association (; branded as Canada Soccer) is the governing body for soccer in Canada. Headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario, the federation is a full member of FIFA and governs Canadian soccer at the international, professional, and amateur levels, including: the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s national teams, Canadian Premier League, youth organizations, beach soccer, futsal, Paralympic and deaf national teams. The Canadian Soccer Association also administers and operates the Canadian Championship, and the Futsal Canadian Championship. 

==History==

The Dominion of Canada Football Association, today known as the Canadian Soccer Association, was founded in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in July 1912. The organization joined FIFA on December 31, 1912. On June 21, 1926, the DCFA resigned from FIFA, only to rejoin on June 20, 1948. The governing body of the game retained that name until it was changed to The Football Association of Canada on June 6, 1952. The association later changed its name to the Canadian Soccer Football Association in 1958 and then at last to the Canadian Soccer Association in 1971.

Canada Soccer has hosted several global soccer tournaments, including the 1976 Olympic football tournament, the 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, and will co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup along with Mexico and United States. The association has also hosted the FIFA U-20 World Cup (2007), the FIFA U-16 World Championship (1987), and the FIFA U-20 Women&#x27;s World Cup (2002, 2014).

==Organization and governance==
Canada Soccer is a non-profit organization governed by a board of directors consisting of 14 directors: a President, Vice President, six elected directors, and six appointed or independent directors. Each of the six elected directors is elected from one of six geographic regions. The board must include at least three men and three women.

Canada Soccer is administered by the General Secretariat. The general secretary is the chief executive of Soccer Canada, and is appointed by the board of directors.

Canada Soccer is a member of the worldwide soccer body FIFA and the North American soccer body CONCACAF and also has a relationship with the International Olympic Committee.

Canada Soccer&#x27;s objectives, as described in its by-laws, are to:
# promote, regulate and control the game of soccer throughout Canada, particularly through youth and development programs;
# organize competitions in Association Football in all its forms at a national level, by defining the areas of authority conceded to the various leagues of which it is composed;
# draw up Association Football regulations and provisions, and ensure their enforcement;
# protect the interests of its Members;
# respect and prevent any infringement of the statutes, regulations, directives and decisions of FIFA, CONCACAF and The CSA, as well as the Laws of the Game;
# prevent all methods or practices that jeopardize the integrity of matches or competitions or give rise to abuse of Association Football;
# control and supervise all friendly Association Football matches played throughout Canada;
# manage international sporting relations connected with Association Football;
# host competitions at international and other levels.

==National teams==
===Men&#x27;s national team===
The Canada men&#x27;s national soccer team represents Canada in international soccer competitions at the senior men&#x27;s level. Their most significant achievements are winning the 1985 CONCACAF Championship to qualify for the 1986 FIFA World Cup, winning the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup to qualify for the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup and qualifying for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A Canadian club team also won a gold medal in the 1904 Summer Olympics.

The men&#x27;s national soccer team have played at the FIFA World Cup on two occasions, in 1986, and 2022. They have yet to make it through to the knockout stages. By qualifying for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Canada ended a 36-year drought. Canada with Mexico and the United States will jointly host the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the first 48-team event.

Canada have played at the CONCACAF Gold Cup on eighteen occasions, most recently in 2021. They co-hosted the tournament in 2015, where they finished 4th in their group, and did not advance to the knockout stage.

===Women&#x27;s national team===
The Canada women&#x27;s national soccer team represents Canada in international women&#x27;s soccer competitions at the senior women&#x27;s level. Its most significant achievements are winning the 1998 CONCACAF Women&#x27;s Championship to qualify for the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, and winning the 2010 CONCACAF Women&#x27;s World Cup Qualifying to qualify for the 2011 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. The Canadian team also won a gold medal in the 2020 Summer Olympics.

The women&#x27;s national soccer team has played at the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup on eight occasions (missing only the inaugural 1991 edition), most recently in 2023. The team reached international prominence at the 2003 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, losing in the third place match to the United States. Canada hosted the 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, and reached the quarterfinals.

The team has played at the CONCACAF W Championship on ten occasions, most recently in 2022. It hosted the tournament in 1994 and 1998.

Canada has played at the Summer Olympics on four occasions, most recently at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, where they were crowned champions for the very first time.

=== Youth national teams ===
The men&#x27;s youth team most significant achievements are winning the 1986 CONCACAF U-20 Tournament to qualify for the 1987 FIFA World Youth Championship, and winning the 1996 CONCACAF U-20 Tournament to qualify for the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship.

The women&#x27;s youth team most significant achievements are winning the 2004 CONCACAF Women&#x27;s U-20 Championship, winning the 2008 CONCACAF Women&#x27;s U-20 Championship to qualify for the 2008 FIFA U-20 Women&#x27;s World Cup, and winning the 2010 CONCACAF Women&#x27;s U-17 Championship to qualify for the 2010 FIFA U-17 Women&#x27;s World Cup.

==Professional leagues==
Despite a long history of professional soccer in the country, Canada have struggled to build and sustain domestic soccer leagues. They have gone through many different iterations, finally landing on the Canadian Premier League that was founded in 2019.

=== Men ===
The Canadian Premier League (CPL) is the top division of soccer in Canada. It is the only fully professional, and only fully national league in the system. Founded in 2019, the CPL is composed of eight teams and is sanctioned by the CSA. There are also three Canadian teams which play in Major League Soccer, the first-division league sanctioned by the United States Soccer Federation, reflecting a longstanding practice of major Canadian sports franchises competing in American leagues.

CSA does not have a sanctioned second-division men&#x27;s soccer league; however, they do have a third-division sanctioned league: League1 Canada which was founded in 2022. League1 Canada is contested by clubs from four divisions; these are Ligue1 Québec, League1 Ontario, League1 British Columbia, and League1 Alberta for both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s divisions. In 2022, Toronto FC II and Whitecaps FC 2 began play in MLS Next Pro, a USSF-sanctioned third-division league.

At the professional level, Canada&#x27;s domestic cup is the Canadian Championship. Founded in 2008, the Canadian Championship is an annual tournament contested by Canadian professional teams and the champions of each League1 Canada division. The winner is awarded the Voyageurs Cup and a berth in the CONCACAF Champions Cup. Canada&#x27;s best performance in the CONCACAF Champions Cup came in the 2014–15 competition, when Montreal Impact reached the finals. Toronto FC also reached the final in 2018 where they fell in penalties to C.D. Guadalajara.

=== Women ===

 Canada does not have a professional women&#x27;s league. The CSA previously had an affiliation with the U.S.-based National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL) where some Canada women&#x27;s national soccer team players were assigned to NWSL clubs. This affiliation ended after the 2021 season when the allocation system was abolished, although many Canadians continue to play in the American league.

In 2022, former national team player Diana Matheson and then national team captain Christine Sinclair announced a new Canadian women&#x27;s professional league which will start play in April 2025. Matheson and Project 8 Sports Inc. are leading this effort while Sinclair is involved in an advisory role. 

Six teams are expected to play the inaugural season of the Northern Super League. Halifax Tides FC, AFC Toronto, Calgary Wild FC, Montreal Roses, Ottawa Rapid and Vancouver Rise are expected to take the field in 2025.

== Controversies ==

=== Sexual harassment ===
In July 2022, an independent review summarized in a 125-page report by McLaren Global Sport Solution, commissioned by Canada Soccer, concluded that Canada Soccer mishandled sexual harassment allegations in 2008 against then Canada U-20 women&#x27;s soccer coach Bob Birarda, who was later found guilty of three counts of sexual assault. It said Canada Soccer was &quot;described by many as being dysfunctional and inefficient&quot; in 2007 and 2008, and concluded among other things that &quot;harassment was not a priority issue amongst the senior Canadian Soccer Association leadership team&quot; at the time.

In 2022, Canada Soccer&#x27;s then newly appointed Secretary General Earl Cochrane said: &quot;We are going to be leaders in this safe sport – through policy, practice, programs.&quot;

=== Drone spying scandal ===

On July 22, 2024, New Zealand’s women’s soccer team made a startling report to French authorities, claiming a drone had been flying over their practice sessions in Saint-Étienne. French investigators quickly traced the drone to Joseph Lombardi, a staff member of Canada Soccer. 

The Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) confirmed that both Lombardi and assistant coach Jasmine Mander, had been sent home. In response, Canadian head coach Beverly Priestman issued a public statement clarifying that, while she hadn’t &quot;directed&quot; the staffers responsible for the drone, she was stepping down from coaching the upcoming game. She also offered an apology to New Zealand, acknowledging that the actions didn’t reflect the values her team stands for. Canada Soccer quickly launched an investigation into the matter, with FIFA soon announcing it would hold its own disciplinary hearings.

Canada Soccer’s CEO, Kevin Blue, spoke to reporters, suggesting that, based on initial findings, the drone incident might not have been an isolated one, but part of a &quot;systemic culture.&quot; He added that Priestman would not be coaching the Canadian team at the Paris Olympics.

Following their investigation, FIFA announced that Priestman, Lombardi, and Mander were all found responsible for &quot;offensive behavior&quot; and violations of fair play. As a result, the three were handed a one-year ban from all soccer-related activities, and Canada’s national team was hit with a six-point penalty in the ongoing Olympics, making their already challenging route to the knockout stages even harder.

<text>Eugène Édine Pottier (; 4 October 1816 – 6 November 1887) was a French revolutionary, poet, song-writer, and freemason. He is most known for writing the lyrics of &quot;The Internationale&quot;, a left-wing anthem.

== Life and Work in Paris ==
Pottier grew up as the son of a packer but later trained as an industrial textile designer, a profession that he celebrated in a poem called The Exposition, about the Paris Exposition of Industrial Design in 1861. He began writing songs already in his teens, inspired by the example of Pierre-Jean de Béranger, whose book he apparently discovered in an armoire. By the time of the French Revolution of 1848 and the brief Second Republic, he was writing and performing political songs in the company of other worker-songwriters or &quot;chansonniers&quot; as they were known in French. At a time when up to seventy percent of the French population was illiterate, these songs, called &quot;chansons sociales&quot; or socially critical songs, offered political mobilization as well as entertainment to working people, and were often set to familiar tunes to encourage singing along. His songs of this period include titles such as &quot;Etats généraux du travail&quot; [Estates General of Labor] &quot;Liberté, égalité, fraternité, et gaité&quot; (best translated as &quot;Liberty, Equality, Fraternity--and Fun&quot;)

After the coup by Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, who called himself Napoleon III, crushed the Second Republic in favor of the Second Empire, Pottier worked as an industrial designer. The Industrial Exposition of 1861 and the spread of the Second Empire Style benefitted artisans such as Pottier who claimed to be the &quot;owner of the best design studio in Paris&quot; at the time. Pottier&#x27;s relative prosperity did not deter him from political activity. As censorship was relaxed after 1867, he joined the French affiliate of the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association, which had been founded by Karl Marx and others in London in 1864 and became informally known as the First International. Pottier&#x27;s songs from this period, while not as overtly political, still critiqued social and economic injustice, with titles such as &quot;Ce que dit le pain&quot; [What the Bread Says], or environmental destruction &quot;La mort d&#x27;un globe&quot; [Death of a World]. Others reflected his curiosity and engagement with science and industrial innovation in France and the world, in songs such as &quot;La nouvelle ère&quot; [The New Era], which celebrated the first trans-Atlantic telegraphic cable and with it instantaneous contact between Europe and North America.

== Pottier and the Paris Commune of 1871 ==
As a member of the International, Pottier welcomed the abdication of Napoleon III after his war against Prussia collapsed in September 1870, and the ensuing declaration of the Third Republic and the Government of National Defense. He represented the second arrondissement of Paris in the radical Republican Central Committee in the attempted revolt of January 1871. This organization, along with the International and the Revolutionary Socialist Party supported by followers of Louis-Auguste Blanqui opposed giving up the guns and canon of the Parisian National Guards to the Government of National Defense. When this conservative republican government retreated to Versailles on 18 March Pottier was elected a member of the Paris municipal council, the Paris Commune, on 26 March 1871, representing first the second arrondissement and later, after the French army attacked from Versailles, the eleventh. In addition to representing these arrondissements, Pottier also served on the Commune&#x27;s Federation of Artists which was chaired by the painter Gustave Courbet, all of which left him little time for writing songs. Only after the Commune fell to the army on 28 May, did he write &quot;L&#x27;Internationale&quot;, shortly before fleeing France first for Britain and then, in 1873, for the United States.

== U.S. Exile and Return to Paris ==
While in exile in New Jersey, Pottier made a precarious living teaching French but received support from other French exiles and from the freemason lodge, Les Égalitaires, which had been established in New York by French exiles already in the Second Empire and which he joined in 1875. In his cover letter, he said that Freemasonry was &quot;composed of a group of freethinkers who, having made a clean sweep on tradition and recognizing nothing superior to human reason, consciously dedicate themselves in search of Truth and Justice&quot;. Although not well-known in the U.S., Pottier gave several speeches to commemorate the inaugural meeting of the U.S. Socialist Labor Party, Paterson, N.J chapter in 1878, and the anniversary of the Commune&#x27;s founding on 18 March 1878; the latter was publishes as a pamphlet in New Jersey and as far away as San Francisco. During his U.S. exile, Pottier also wrote a number of songs and poems, including a long French poem with an English title, &quot;The Workingmen of American to the Workingmen of France&quot; (1876), which was addressed as if by an American workers delegation to the French workers visiting the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia and which combines a celebration of the exposition with a critique of global capitalism and U.S. hegemony. By the time Pottier was able to return to Paris in 1881, after the French National Assembly passed the Amnesty Law, he was old and sick but nonetheless kept on writing songs. When &quot;Chacun vit de son métier&quot; [To Each His Trade] won the silver medal at &quot;La Lice Chansonnière&quot; (a workers&#x27; song competition) in 1883, Pottier resumed contact with his Communard comrades, especially Jean Allemane and Jules Vallès. Allemane published this and other popular songs by Pottier such as &quot;Jean Misère (best translated as Johnny Misery) and &quot;Political Economy&quot; in pamphlet form and in a small anthology with a telling title, &quot;Poésies d&#x27;économie sociale et chansons socialistes révolutionnaires.&quot;

&quot;L&#x27;Internationale&quot;, however, did not appear in print until April 1887 in a collection of Pottier&#x27;s songs called &quot;Chants révolutionnaires&quot;, likewise edited by Allemanne. In this collection, Pottier set his song to the tune of the 1792 anthem, &quot;La Marseillaise.&quot; It was sung in this form at Pottier&#x27; burial, in November 1887, which drew up to 10, 000 mourners to the northeast section of Père Lachaise Cemetery according to eyewitness Ernst Museux. The setting that is usually sung today was composed only in July 1888 by Pierre De Geyter for the workers singing club Le Lyre Travailleur after a young socialist teacher Charles Gros shared it with the future mayor of the industrial town of Lille Gustave Delory. &quot;The Internationale&quot; was sung by the Parti ouvrier français (French Workers Party) and first translated into English in 1894 by American publisher Charles H. Kerr. After German socialist Wilhelm Liebknecht and other members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany attended an international socialist meeting at Lille in 1896, the &quot;Internationale&quot; was translated into German by Emil Luckhardt and adopted by the Second International. The first Russian translation followed in 1902 by Arkady Yakovievich Kots, who studied metallurgy in France at first heard the &quot;Internationale&quot; in Lille in 1899. This version served as the anthem of the Soviet Union from 1919–40 and Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, aka Lenin, who admired the Commune, acknowledged the 25th anniversary of Pottier&#x27;s death in a 1913 article in &quot;Pravda&quot;.

== Legacy ==
After Pottier&#x27;s death, the &quot;Internationale&quot; became the anthem of the Second and later also the Third Internationale, often without his name attached. Many of his other songs circulated in individual pamphlets and in multiple editions of his &quot;Chants révolutionnaires&quot; between 1908, when the stone that now marks his grave was erected, and 1937, the fiftieth anniversary of his death. His collected works, including speeches and letters as well as songs and poems, was published by then-premier French leftist press François Maspero in 1966, and his songs, including the &quot;Internationale&quot;, recorded on several LPs printed to celebrate the centennial of the Commune in 1971 by record labels favoring &quot;chansons sociales&quot; such as Le Chant du monde. A selection of his poems was published in a pocket edition marking the bicentennial of Pottier&#x27;s birth in 2016 by the publisher Le Temps de cerises, named in honor of a famous Commune song by Jean-Baptiste Clément. Apart from the &quot;Internationale&quot; which is sung in at least eighty languages worldwide as well as by well-known 20th century singers in English from Pete Seeger to Billy Bragg, and by more recent groups in France from the French-singing Brooklyn-based Les Sans Culottes, Sing in Solidarity (chorus of the Democratic Socialists of America), performed &quot;The Internationale&quot; on Democracy Now! to the Senegalese Eyo&#x27;Nile Brass Band, other songs by Pottier such as &quot;La mort d&#x27;un globe&quot; [Death of a World]; &quot;Jean Misère&quot; [Johnny Misery], &quot;Elle [La Commune] n&#x27;est pas morte&quot; [The Commune did not die], &quot;L&#x27;économie politique&quot; {Political Economy] and &quot;Quand reviendra-t-elle?&quot; {When will the Commune return?] appear on the album &quot;La Commune refleurira&quot; [The Commune will bloom again] issued to commemorate the sesquicentennial of the Commune by the collective Les Ogres de Barback in 2021. These and other songs were published in English for the first time in 2024.

A key song on Barback album,&quot;The Commune did not die&quot;, written in Paris in May 1886, may celebrate not only the Communard dead and their French socialist inheritors but also activists in the International Working Peoples Association killed in the Haymarket incident in Chicago that month. Even if Pottier does not mention the Haymarket, his younger contemporary Jules Jouy wrote at least two songs about the Haymarket in 1887, after several had been tried and, in four cases, executed for their political views. Pottier&#x27;s song begins by naming some of those, such as Eugène Varlin and Théophile Ferré, who were shot during the last days of the Commune but he ends in defiance, in terms that, like the 150th anniversary album, anticipate its return:
:Bref, tout ça prouve aux combattants
:Que Marianne a la peau brune
:Du chien dans l&#x27; ventre et qu&#x27;il est temps
:De crier &quot;Vive la Commune!&quot;
:Et ça prouve a tous les Judas
:Que si ça marche dle la sorte,
:Ils sentiront dans peu
:Nom de Dieu!
:Que la Commune n&#x27;est pas morte!
In English:

In short, this proves to those who fought

Our Marianne is well tanned

And that it is time to shout

&quot;Vive La Commune!&quot; again.

And it proves to every Judas

That it will come by and by

That they will see it soon enough, my God,

&quot;The Commune did not die!&quot;

<text>The Powers Accounting Machine was an information processing device developed in the early 20th century for the U.S. Census Bureau. It was then produced and marketed by the Powers Accounting Machine Company, an information technology company founded by the machine&#x27;s developer. The company thrived in the early 20th century as a producer of tabulating machines. It was a predecessor to the Unisys corporation.

==Development==
===Census Bureau ===
In 1890, the government began leasing tabulating machines from Herman Hollerith&#x27;s Tabulating Machine Company, to more efficiently, expansively, and accurately produce the national census. In 1900, Hollerith raised the lease pricing. This led the newly formed U.S. Census Bureau to seek other suppliers under its new director, Simon North, in 1903. North returned most of Hollerith&#x27;s machines, and the Census Bureau began using Charles F. Pidgin&#x27;s tabulators. These machines proved too slow, so the Bureau undertook to develop its own machine for the 1910 census. North secured a $40,000 appropriation for the project.

===James Powers===

James Legrand Powers was a mechanical engineer. He was born in Odessa, Russia, in 1871, and graduated from the Technical School of Odessa. He emigrated to the United States in 1889.

The Census Bureau hired him as a technician in 1907 to help develop the competing tabulating machine. He had already done early experimental work in office machines, and had several patents to his name.

Although Hollerith had numerous patents for his tabulators, Powers managed to avoid infringement, by using mechanical sensors on the punch readers, instead of electrical sensors. The new machine was faster, cheaper, more accurate, less error-prone, and less wasteful than Hollerith&#x27;s or Pidgin&#x27;s, while maintaining compatibility with Hollerith&#x27;s punched card format.
 The key advantages of the new machine were feeder mechanisms, and the &quot;whole card punch,&quot; an improvement over the character-by-character punch of earlier designs. A second machine was also developed by W. W. Lasker, to automate printing results.

Powers secured a patent for his version of the tabulating machine, which allowed him to later create a business around the technology he had invented.

A prolific inventor, he did not restrict himself to office machinery. See, for example, the &quot;Germproof Drinking Cup&quot;. The inventor was a member of the Machinery Club and the American Society of Mechanical Engineering through the time of his death on Tuesday, November 8, 1927, at age 57. The New York Times ran a brief paid obituary two days later.

===First usage===
The United States Census Bureau tested the machine in the real world by allowing the Cuban government to conduct its census in 1908-1909 using prototypes of the new tabulating machine.

==Corporate==
After successful use in the 1910 census, Mr. Powers formed a corporation to manufacture his machines and sell them commercially. The company was founded in 1911 in Newark, New Jersey. In 1914, he moved to Brooklyn, New York.

Originally known as Powers Tabulating Machine Company, the name was changed to Powers Accounting Machine Company to better target a broad scope of market.

In 1927 the Remington Typewriter Company and the Rand Kardex Corporation merged, forming Remington Rand Inc. Within a year Remington Rand acquired the Powers Accounting Machine Company.

In Europe, Powers established European operations in 1915 through the Accounting and Tabulating Machine Company of Great Britain Limited, and in 1929 renamed to Powers-Samas Accounting Machine Limited (Samas, full name Societe Anonyme des Machines a Statistiques, had been the Power&#x27;s sales agency in France).

<doc id="765155" wikidata="Q1779710" url="?curid=765155" title="Queen's Hall">
<text>The Queen&#x27;s Hall was a concert hall in Langham Place, London, opened in 1893. Designed by the architect Thomas Knightley, it had room for an audience of about 2,500 people. It became London&#x27;s principal concert venue. From 1895 until 1941, it was the home of the promenade concerts (&quot;The Proms&quot;) founded by Robert Newman together with Henry Wood. The hall had drab decor and cramped seating but superb acoustics. It became known as the &quot;musical centre of the [British] Empire&quot;, and several of the leading musicians and composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries performed there, including Claude Debussy, Edward Elgar, Maurice Ravel and Richard Strauss.

In the 1930s, the hall became the main London base of two new orchestras, the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the London Philharmonic Orchestra. These two ensembles raised the standards of orchestral playing in London to new heights, and the hall&#x27;s resident orchestra, founded in 1893, was eclipsed and it disbanded in 1930. The new orchestras attracted another generation of musicians from Europe and the United States, including Serge Koussevitzky, Willem Mengelberg, Arturo Toscanini, Bruno Walter and Felix Weingartner.

In 1941, during the Second World War, the building was destroyed by incendiary bombs in the London Blitz. Despite much lobbying for the hall to be rebuilt, the government decided against doing so. The main musical functions of the Queen&#x27;s Hall were taken over by the Royal Albert Hall for the Proms, and the new Royal Festival Hall for the general concert season.

==Background==

The site on which the hall was built was bounded by the present-day Langham Place, Riding House Street and Great Portland Street. In 1820 the land was bought by the Crown during the development of John Nash&#x27;s Regent Street. Between then and the building of the hall, the site was first sublet to a coachmaker and stablekeeper, and in 1851 a bazaar occupied the site. In 1887, the leaseholder, Francis Ravenscroft, negotiated a building agreement with the Crown, providing for the clearing of the site and the erection of a new concert hall. The name of the new building was intended to be either the &quot;Victoria Concert Hall&quot; or the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Concert Hall&quot;. The name finally chosen, the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Hall&quot;, was decided very shortly before the hall opened. The historian Robert Elkin speculates that the alternative &quot;Victoria Concert Hall&quot; was abandoned as liable to confusion with the &quot;Royal Victoria Music Hall&quot;, the formal name of the Old Vic.

The new hall was to provide a much-needed music venue in the centre of London. St James&#x27;s Hall, just south of Oxford Circus, was too small, had serious safety problems, and was so poorly ventilated as to be unpleasant. Bernard Shaw in his capacity as a music critic commented on &quot;the old unvaried round of Steinway Hall, Prince&#x27;s Hall and St James&#x27;s Hall&quot;, and warmly welcomed the new building.

==Construction==
Ravenscroft commissioned the architect Thomas Edward Knightley to design the new hall. Using a floor plan previously prepared by C. J. Phipps, Knightley designed a hall with a floor area of 21,000 square feet (2,000 m²) and an audience capacity of 2,500. Contemporary newspapers commented on the unusual elevation of the building, with the grand tier at street level, and the stalls and arena downstairs. The exterior carving was by Sidney W. Elmes and Son, and the furnishing was by Lapworth Brothers and Harrison. The lighting was a combination of gas and electricity.
The original decor consisted of grey and terracotta walls, Venetian red seating, large red lampshades suspended just above the orchestra&#x27;s heads, mirrors surrounding the arena, and portraits of the leading composers to the sides of the platform. The paintwork was intended to be the colour of &quot;the belly of a London mouse&quot;, and Knightley is said to have kept a string of dead mice in the paint shop in order to ensure the correct tone. The arena had moveable seating on a &quot;brownish carpet that blended with the dull fawnish colour of the walls&quot;. The arched ceiling had an elaborate painting of the Paris Opéra, by Carpegat. Of the accompanying details of the painting, E. M. Forster remarked on &quot;the attenuated Cupids who encircle the ceiling of the Queen&#x27;s Hall, inclining each to each with vapid gesture, and clad in sallow pantaloons&quot;.

In the centre of the arena there was a fountain containing pebbles, goldfish and waterlilies. According to the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham, &quot;Every three or four minutes some fascinating young female fell into the fountain and had to be rescued by a chivalrous swain. It must have happened thirty-five times every night. Foreigners came from all parts of Europe to see it&quot;. At the top of the building, adjoining the conservatory, was the Queen&#x27;s Small Hall, seating 500, for recitals, chamber-music concerts and other small-scale presentations. In July 1894, Bernard Shaw described it as &quot;cigar-shaped with windows in the ceiling, and reminiscent of a ship&#x27;s saloon … now much the most comfortable of our small concert rooms&quot;. The hall provided modern facilities, open frontage for carriages and parking room, a press room, public spaces and bars.

At the time, and subsequently, the hall was celebrated for its superb acoustics, unmatched by any other large hall in London. Soon after its opening, Shaw praised it as &quot;a happy success acoustically&quot;. Knightley followed the example of earlier buildings noted for fine acoustics; the walls of the auditorium were lined with wood, fixed clear of the walls on thick battens, and coarse canvas was stretched over the wood and then sealed and decorated. He calculated that the unbroken surface and the wooden lining would be &quot;like the body of the violin – resonant&quot;. &quot;The Observer&quot; commented that the building resembled a violin in construction and shape, and also that &quot;the ground plan of the orchestra was founded on the bell of a horn&quot;.

Shortly before the opening, Ravenscroft appointed Robert Newman as manager. Newman had already had three different careers, as a stockjobber, a bass soloist, and a concert agent. The rest of his career was associated with the Queen&#x27;s Hall, and the names of the hall and the manager became synonymous.

==Early years==

The Queen&#x27;s Hall first opened its doors on 25 November 1893. Newman gave a children&#x27;s party in the afternoon, and in the evening 2,000 invited guests attended what Elkin describes as &quot;a sort of private view&quot;, with popular selections played by the Band of the Coldstream Guards, and songs, piano and organ solos performed by well-known musicians. After the performances, the seats in the arena were removed, lavish refreshments were served, and the guests danced.

On 27 November there was a smoking concert given by the Royal Amateur Orchestral Society, of which Prince Alfred (the second son of Queen Victoria) was both patron and leader. The performance was attended by the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Connaught. Knightley had built a royal box in the grand circle, but Prince Alfred told Newman, &quot;my brother would never sit in that&quot;, and Newman had it demolished. The royal party was seated in armchairs in the front of the stalls (pictured right). The programme consisted of orchestral works by Sullivan, Gounod, Auber, Mendelssohn and Tchaikovsky, and solos from the violinist Tivadar Nachéz and the baritone David Ffrangcon-Davies.

The official opening of the hall took place on 2 December. Frederic Hymen Cowen conducted; the National Anthem was sung by Emma Albani and a choir of 300 voices assembled at short notice by Newman; Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Hymn of Praise&quot; followed, with Albani, Margaret Hoare and Edward Lloyd as soloists. In the second part of the programme there was a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Emperor Concerto&quot;, with Frederick Dawson as soloist.

From the autumn of 1894, the hall was adopted as the venue for the annual winter season of concerts of the Philharmonic Society of London, which had formerly been held at St James&#x27;s Hall. At the first Philharmonic concert at the Queen&#x27;s Hall, Alexander Mackenzie conducted the first performance in England of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Pathétique Symphony&quot;, which was so well received that it was repeated, by popular acclaim, at the next concert. During the 1894–95 season, Edvard Grieg and Camille Saint-Saëns conducted performances of their works. The Society remained at the Queen&#x27;s Hall until 1941.

===Promenade concerts===

To fill the hall during the heat of the late-summer period, when London audiences tended to stay away from theatres and concert halls, Newman planned to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts, with low-priced tickets to attract a wider audience than that of the main season. Costs needed to be kept down, and Newman decided not to engage a star conductor, but invited the young and little known Henry Wood to conduct the whole season. There had been various seasons of promenade concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan&#x27;s concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others. Newman aimed to do the same: &quot;I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music&quot;.

Newman&#x27;s determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available in all parts of the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were about one fifth of those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.

Newman needed to find financial backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard &quot;diapason normal&quot;. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers&#x27; voices. Wood, who was a singing teacher as well as a conductor, agreed. The brass and woodwind players of the Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra were unwilling to buy new low-pitched instruments; Cathcart imported a set from Belgium and lent them to the players. After a season, the players recognised that the low pitch would be permanently adopted, and they bought the instruments from him.

On 10 August 1895, the first of the Queen&#x27;s Hall Promenade Concerts took place. It opened with Wagner&#x27;s overture to &quot;Rienzi&quot;, but the rest of the programme comprised, in the words of a historian of the Proms, David Cox, &quot;for the most part ... blatant trivialities&quot;. Newman and Wood gradually tilted the balance from light music to mainstream classical works; within days of the opening concert, Schubert&#x27;s Unfinished Symphony and further excerpts from Wagner operas were performed. Among the other symphonies presented during the first season were Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Great C Major&quot;, Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Italian&quot; and Schumann&#x27;s Fourth. The concertos included Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Concerto and Schumann&#x27;s Piano Concerto. During the season there were 23 novelties, including the London premieres of pieces by Richard Strauss, Tchaikovsky, Glazunov, Massenet and Rimsky-Korsakov. Newman and Wood soon felt able to devote every Monday night of the season principally to Wagner and every Friday night to Beethoven, a pattern that endured for decades.

===Other presentations===

Many events at the Queen&#x27;s Hall were not presented by Newman. The hall was frequently let to organisations such as the Bach Choir and the Philharmonic Society (from 1903 the Royal Philharmonic Society), and later the London Choral Society and Royal Choral Society. The hall was used for a wide range of other activities, including balls, military band concerts under Sousa, lectures, public meetings, Morris dancing, Eurythmics and religious services. On 14 January 1896, the UK&#x27;s first public film show was presented at the Queen&#x27;s Hall to members and wives of the Royal Photographic Society by the maker of the &quot;Kineopticon&quot; and Fellow of the society, Birt Acres, and his colleague, Arthur Melbourne-Cooper. This was an improved version of the early Kinetoscope.

Newman continued to be interested in new entertainments. The music hall entertainer Albert Chevalier persuaded him to instigate variety performances in the Queen&#x27;s Small Hall from 16 January 1899. These shows were well received; &quot;The Times&quot; commented that Chevalier&#x27;s &quot;vogue with the cultured classes is as great and as permanent as with his former patrons&quot;.

Despite all these various activities, in the public mind the Queen&#x27;s Hall quickly became chiefly associated with the promenade concerts. Newman was careful to balance &quot;the Proms&quot;, as they became known, with more prestigious and expensive concerts throughout the rest of the year. He would foster the careers of promising artists, and if they were successful at the Proms they would, after two seasons, be given contracts for the main concert series, billed as the Symphony Concerts. The Proms had to be run on the tightest of budgets, but for the Symphony Concert series Newman was willing to pay large fees to attract the most famous musicians. Soloists included Joseph Joachim, Fritz Kreisler, Nellie Melba, Pablo de Sarasate, Eugène Ysaÿe and, most expensive of all, Ignacy Jan Paderewski. Conductors included Arthur Nikisch and Hans Richter. Among the composers who performed their own works at the hall in its first 20 years were Debussy, Elgar, Grieg, Ravel, Saint-Saëns, Schoenberg, Richard Strauss and Sullivan.

==Early 20th century==
In 1901 Newman became the lessee of the hall as well as its manager, but the following year, after unwise investment in theatrical presentations, he was declared bankrupt. The music publisher Chappell and Co took over the lease of the building, retaining Newman as manager. The Queen&#x27;s Hall orchestra and concerts were rescued by the musical benefactor Sir Edgar Speyer, a banker of German origin. Speyer put up the necessary funds, encouraged Newman and Wood to continue with their project of musical education, and underwrote the Proms and the main Symphony Concert seasons. Newman remained manager of the hall until 1906 and manager of the concerts until he died in 1926.
The standard of orchestral playing in London was adversely affected by the deputy system, in which orchestral players, if offered a better-paid engagement, could send a substitute to a rehearsal or a concert. The treasurer of the Royal Philharmonic Society described it thus: &quot;A, whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends B (whom you don&#x27;t mind) to the first rehearsal. B, without your knowledge or consent, sends C to the second rehearsal. Not being able to play at the concert, C sends D, whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away&quot;. The members of the Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra were not highly paid; Wood recalled in his memoirs, &quot;the rank and file of the orchestra received only 45s a week for six Promenade concerts and three rehearsals, a guinea for one Symphony concert and rehearsal, and half-a-guinea for Sunday afternoon or evening concerts &quot;without&quot; rehearsal&quot;. Offered &quot;ad hoc&quot; engagements at better pay by other managements, many of the players took full advantage of the deputy system. Newman determined to put an end to it. After a rehearsal in which Wood was faced with a sea of entirely unfamiliar faces in his own orchestra, Newman came on the platform to announce: &quot;Gentlemen, in future there will be no deputies; good morning&quot;. Forty players resigned &quot;en bloc&quot; and formed their own orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra. Newman did not attempt to bar the new orchestra from the Queen&#x27;s Hall, and its first concert was given there on 9 June 1904, conducted by Richter.

By the 20th century the Queen&#x27;s Hall was regarded not only as &quot;London&#x27;s premier concert-hall&quot; but as &quot;the acknowledged musical centre of the Empire&quot;. The drabness of its interior decor and the lack of leg-room in the seating attracted criticism. In 1913, &quot;The Musical Times&quot; said, &quot;In the placing of the seats apparently no account whatever is taken even of the average length of lower limbs, and it appeared to be the understanding … that legs were to be left in the cloak room. At twopence apiece this would be expensive, and there might be difficulties afterwards if the cloak room sorting arrangements were not perfect&quot;. Chappells promised to rearrange the seats to give more room and did so within the year; the seating capacity of the hall was reduced to 2,400. War intervened before the question of refurbishing the decor could be addressed.

===First World War and post-war===

On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Newman, Wood and Speyer were obliged to consider the immediate future of concert-giving at the Queen&#x27;s Hall. They discussed whether the Proms should continue as planned, and agreed to go ahead. However, within months anti-German feeling forced Speyer to leave the country and seek refuge in the U.S., and there was a campaign to ban all German music from concerts. Newman put out a statement declaring that German music would be played as planned: &quot;The greatest examples of Music and Art are world possessions and unassailable even by the prejudices and passions of the hour&quot;.

When Speyer left Britain in 1915, Chappell&#x27;s took on financial responsibility for the Queen&#x27;s Hall concerts. The resident orchestra was renamed the New Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra. Concerts continued throughout the war years, with fewer major new works than before, although there were nevertheless British premieres of pieces by Bartók, Stravinsky and Debussy. An historian of the Proms, Ateş Orga, wrote: &quot;Concerts often had to be re-timed to coincide with the &#x27;All Clear&#x27; between air raids. Falling bombs, shrapnel, anti-aircraft fire and the droning of Zeppelins were ever threatening. But [Wood] kept things on the go and in the end had a very real part to play in boosting morale&quot;. The hall was hit by German air raids, but escaped with only minor damage. A member of Wood&#x27;s choir later recalled a hit in the middle of a concert:

After the war, the Queen&#x27;s Hall operated for a few years much as it had done before 1914, except for what Wood called &quot;a somewhat disagreeable blue-green&quot; new decor. New performers appeared, including Solomon, Lauritz Melchior and Paul Hindemith. During the 1920s, however, the hall became the battleground between proponents and opponents of broadcasting. William Boosey, the head of Chappells, and effective proprietor of the Queen&#x27;s Hall, was adamantly against the broadcasting of music by the recently established British Broadcasting Company (BBC). He decreed that no artist who had worked for the BBC would be allowed to perform at the Queen&#x27;s Hall. This put performers in a dilemma; they wished to appear on the air without forfeiting the right to appear at Britain&#x27;s most important musical venue. The hall became temporarily unable to attract many of the finest performers of the day.

In the middle of the impasse Newman&#x27;s health failed, and he died in November 1926 after a brief illness. Wood wrote, &quot;I feared everything would come to a standstill, for I had never so much as engaged an extra player without having discussed it with him first&quot;. Newman&#x27;s assistant, W. W. Thompson, took over as manager of the orchestra and the concerts, but at this crucial point Chappells withdrew financial support for the Proms. After lengthy negotiations, the BBC took over from Chappells in 1927 as sponsor. The Proms were saved, and the hall continued to play host to celebrity concerts throughout the rest of the 1920s and the &#x27;30s, some promoted by the BBC, and others as hitherto by a range of choral societies, impresarios and orchestras. As Chappells owned the title &quot;New Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra&quot;, the resident orchestra had to change its name once again and was now known as Sir Henry J. Wood&#x27;s Symphony Orchestra.

==Last years==
In 1927, the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, under its conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler, gave two concerts at the Queen&#x27;s Hall. These, and later concerts by the same orchestra in 1928 and 1929, made obvious the comparatively poor standards of London orchestras. Both the BBC and Sir Thomas Beecham had ambitions to bring London&#x27;s orchestral standards up to those of Berlin. After an early attempt at co-operation between the BBC and Beecham, they went their separate ways; the BBC established the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Adrian Boult, and Beecham, together with Malcolm Sargent, founded the London Philharmonic Orchestra.

Both orchestras made their debuts with concerts at the Queen&#x27;s Hall. The BBC orchestra gave its first concert on 22 October 1930, conducted by Boult in a programme of music by Wagner, Brahms, Saint-Saëns and Ravel. The reviews of the new orchestra were enthusiastic. &quot;The Times&quot; commented on its &quot;virtuosity&quot; and of Boult&#x27;s &quot;superb&quot; conducting. &quot;The Musical Times&quot; commented, &quot;The boast of the B.B.C. that it intended to get together a first-class orchestra was not an idle one&quot;, and spoke of &quot;exhilaration&quot; at the playing. The London Philharmonic made its debut on 7 October 1932, conducted by Beecham. After the first item, Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Roman Carnival Overture&quot;, the audience went wild, some of them standing on their seats to clap and shout. During the next eight years, the orchestra appeared nearly a hundred times at the Queen&#x27;s Hall. There was no role for the old resident orchestra, many of whose members had been engaged by the BBC, and in 1930 it disbanded.

With orchestral standards now of unprecedented excellence, eminent musicians from Europe and the U.S. were eager to perform at the Queen&#x27;s Hall. Among the guest conductors at the hall in the 1930s were Serge Koussevitzky, Willem Mengelberg, Arturo Toscanini, Bruno Walter and Felix Weingartner. Composer-conductors included Richard Strauss and Anton Webern. Some recordings made in the hall during this period have been reissued on CD.

===Second World War===

On the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the BBC immediately put into effect its contingency plans to move much of its broadcasting away from London to places thought less at risk of bombing. Its musical department, including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, moved to Bristol. The BBC withdrew not only the players, but financial support from the Proms. Wood determined that the 1940 season would nevertheless go ahead. The Royal Philharmonic Society and a private entrepreneur, Keith Douglas, agreed to back an eight-week season, and the London Symphony Orchestra was engaged. The concerts continued through air raids, and audiences often stayed in the hall until early morning, with musical entertainments continuing after the concerts had finished. The season was curtailed after four weeks, when intense bombing forced the Queen&#x27;s Hall to close. The last Prom given at the Queen&#x27;s Hall was on 7 September 1940. On 8 December doors and windows of the hall were blown out by blast. After temporary repairs, concerts were continued; after further damage on 6 April 1941 repairs were again quickly made, and the hall re-opened within days.

On the afternoon of 10 May 1941, there was an Elgar concert at the hall. Sargent conducted the &quot;Enigma Variations&quot; and &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;. The soloists were Muriel Brunskill, Webster Booth and Ronald Stear, with the London Philharmonic and the Royal Choral Society. This concert, the last given at the hall, comprised in the view of &quot;The Times&quot; &quot;performances of real distinction&quot;. That night there was an intensive air raid in which the chamber of the House of Commons and many other buildings were destroyed, and the British Museum and Westminster Abbey were seriously damaged. A single incendiary bomb hit the Queen&#x27;s Hall, and the auditorium was completely gutted by fire beyond any hope of replacement. The building was a smouldering ruin in heaps of rubble; the London Philharmonic lost thousands of pounds&#x27; worth of instruments. All that remained intact on the site was a bronze bust of Wood retrieved from the debris. Concerts continued in London at the Royal Albert Hall and other venues. The Proms were relocated to the Albert Hall, which remains their principal venue. In 1951, the Royal Festival Hall was opened and succeeded the Queen&#x27;s Hall as the main London venue for symphony concerts other than the Proms.

It was reported in late 1946 that the Commissioners of Crown Lands had increased the site&#x27;s ground rent from £850 to £8,000, setting back the possibility of re-building the hall, or of building a new Henry Wood Concert Hall. In 1954 the government set up a committee, chaired by Lord Robbins with Sir Adrian Boult among its members, to examine the practicability of rebuilding the hall. The committee reported that &quot;on musical grounds and in the interest of the general cultural life of the community&quot; it was desirable to replace the hall, but it was doubtful whether there was a potential demand that would enable it to run without &quot;seriously subtracting from the audiences of subsidised halls already in existence&quot;. From 1982, London had a second hall large enough for symphony concerts, in the Barbican Centre.

The former site of the Queen&#x27;s Hall was redeveloped by the freeholder, the Crown Estate. It is now occupied by the Saint Georges Hotel. In 2004, Richard Morrison wrote of the Queen&#x27;s Hall:
 The site is now marked by a commemorative plaque, which was unveiled in November 2000, by Sir Andrew Davis, chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra.

<text>A Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature to the End of the Sixth Century A.D., with an Account of the Principal Sects and Heresies is a 1911 religious encyclopedia of biographies.

Edited by William C. Piercy and Henry Wace, Dean of Canterbury (1836–1924) in English-language version, it is in the public domain as of 2004. The Christian Classics Ethereal Library has scanned the original printed copy. In 1999, Hendrickson Publishers reprinted it under the title &quot;A Dictionary of Early Christian Biography&quot;.

Its predecessor was &quot;A Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines&quot; (four volumes, 1877–1887) edited by Wace and William Smith. That in turn represented an updated version of &quot;Smith&#x27;s Bible Dictionary&quot; of 1863.

<text>WANF (channel 46) is a television station in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, affiliated with CBS. It is the flagship property of locally based Gray Media and is co-owned with CW affiliate WPCH-TV (channel 17) and low-power, Class A Telemundo affiliate WKTB-CD (channel 47). WANF and WPCH-TV share studios on 14th Street Northwest in Atlanta&#x27;s Home Park neighborhood, while WANF&#x27;s transmitter is located in the city&#x27;s Woodland Hills section.

The station was built in 1971 as WHAE-TV (later WANX-TV), owned by the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN). Originally a nonprofit operation airing religious programs, the station gradually became a more commercially oriented independent station and broadened its programming to include older movies and family-friendly classic TV shows. CBN sold the station to Tribune Broadcasting in 1983, and the call sign was changed to WGNX in 1984. Tribune substantially built up the station, upgrading programming and turning it into Atlanta&#x27;s top-rated independent local station; it also started a local newscast for the station in January 1989.

After a major switch of television affiliations in Atlanta in 1994, WGNX became Atlanta&#x27;s new CBS affiliate and the only such station owned by Tribune. However, news was not seriously expanded until after the Meredith Corporation acquired the station in 1999 as part of a purchase-and-trade with Tribune. The WGCL-TV call sign was adopted in 2000 as part of a major, but short-lived, rebrand of the station to &quot;Clear TV&quot; and its newscasts to &quot;Clear News&quot;. Meredith also assumed operating control of WPCH-TV in 2011, purchasing the station outright in 2017. Over the course of its news-producing history, the station has generally been a revolving door of management and presenting talent with little ratings success.

The acquisition of Meredith by Gray Media in 2021 has resulted in an increased infusion of resources into the station&#x27;s newsroom as well as other investments by Gray in Atlanta-area media. As part of a wide-scale rebrand of its news service to &quot;Atlanta News First&quot;, WGCL-TV changed its call sign to WANF on September 30, 2022.

== History ==

=== As an independent station ===

==== Construction and CBN ownership ====
On January 23, 1968, the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), owned by evangelist Pat Robertson, filed an application with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for authority to build a new television station on channel 46 in Atlanta. The application was granted on May 5, 1968, but after several changes in the proposed studio location, the station began broadcasting on June 6, 1971, as WHAE-TV from leased studio facilities in the Protestant Radio and TV Center on Clifton Road. Originally, it operated for six hours a day on weekdays and twelve on Sundays. It was largely an unprofitable operation with, as John Carman writing for &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; put it, &quot;no particular interest in profits&quot;. On September 3, 1977, WHAE-TV changed its call sign to WANX-TV, with a station spokesman stating it wanted &quot;a new identity&quot; and a &quot;fresh start&quot;.

Over the course of the 1970s and early 1980s, WHAE-TV/WANX-TV, like other CBN independent stations, eventually adopted a program schedule consisting of older, &quot;family-friendly&quot; classic shows as well as some religious programming, such as CBN&#x27;s &quot;The 700 Club&quot;. Movies, a common staple of independents, had been completely absent from the station&#x27;s lineup until 1974, when the outlet moved into studios on Briarcliff Road that had been vacated by WATL (channel 36), which had been temporarily shuttered in 1971, and thereafter owned by Production 70s, a video production house that declared bankruptcy. This facility had been built around a 1916 red clapboard house. It also began to operate on a more commercial basis in 1980, following a restructuring of the CBN media operation into the commercially authorized Continental Broadcasting Network, turning its first-ever profit in 1982. By 1983, it had tied WTBS (channel 17), Ted Turner&#x27;s independent-turned-superstation, in the local ratings, and &quot;The 700 Club&quot; was the only religious program on its weekday lineup.

==== Tribune ownership ====
In July 1983, Tribune Broadcasting of Chicago announced it would spend $32 million to purchase WANX-TV from CBN. It was the company&#x27;s fifth station, purchased as CBN was seeking to raise money for other operations and retire some of its debts. On March 15, 1984, the call sign was changed to WGNX, stated to be a mixture of the call signs of Tribune stations WGN-TV in Chicago and WPIX in New York City.

WGNX emerged as the number-one local independent in Atlanta under Tribune&#x27;s ownership. A reported $40 million in program expenditures lifted costs market-wide for syndicated shows and gave channel 46 a stronger lineup. With $19 million in revenue for 1985, WGNX more than doubled the billing of its primary competitor, WATL. WATL, which engineered its own rise to viability in the late 1980s, and WGNX gave Atlanta its first serious local independent stations. Atlanta Hawks basketball moved from WVEU (channel 69) to WGNX in the 1986–87 season.

In November 1993, Tribune committed to the new WB Television Network, to be launched by Warner Bros. Television in January 1995. Tribune would hold an ownership stake, and six of the company&#x27;s seven independent stations, including WGNX, were initially to join at launch.

=== As a CBS station ===

==== A last-minute big switch ====
On May 23, 1994, New World Communications signed a long-term agreement to affiliate its nine CBS-, ABC- or NBC-affiliated television stations with Fox, which had just acquired the television rights to the National Football Conference (NFC) of the National Football League. New World had a uniquely suited portfolio for Fox. Many of its stations were CBS affiliates in NFC markets—including Atlanta, where it owned WAGA-TV (channel 5); Fox would sell WATL, which it had purchased and where a news department had been partially set up.

Rumors began to circulate wildly in the local industry following the announcement of the New World/Fox deal. General manager Herman Ramsey wrote a memo to his staff: &quot;Have you ever heard so many rumors in a week and a half? ... I believe that the likelihood of WGNX affiliating with any network other than Warner Brothers in January &#x27;95 is small.&quot; Behind the scenes, however, Ramsey was lobbying Tribune to pursue the CBS affiliation for WGNX.

By September, CBS had not found a replacement affiliate in Atlanta even though WAGA was due to join Fox at the end of the year. More or less out of desperation, CBS purchased WVEU for $22 million. However, CBS only took cursory steps toward closing the purchase in hopes of finding a higher-profile outlet in Atlanta, even if it was only an affiliate. It continued to negotiate with Fox and Tribune. By mid-November, with only a month to go before WAGA was due to switch to Fox, CBS had not filed paperwork to purchase channel 69 at the FCC and refused to confirm that it was still moving forward with the deal. 

On November 16, CBS announced that it would not be moving to WVEU but instead to WGNX. CBS preferred to have its programming on a station that already aired local news, and WGNX was the only independent station in the market with a functioning news department. Had CBS moved its programming to WVEU, it would have faced the prospect of a sharp drop in local ratings for the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; until it could build a local news department for channel 69. Setting up a news department would have been a part of an unprecedented campaign to promote WVEU and build its facilities to a level commensurate with its new status as a CBS owned and operated station. One consultant interviewed by &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; estimated CBS would have had to spend close to $100 million to build out WVEU. 

As part of the deal, CBS agreed to buy WVEU and immediately put it back on the market. Additionally, WATL was sold to Qwest Broadcasting (a joint venture between music producer Quincy Jones, former NFL defensive end Willie Davis, television producer Don Cornelius, television host Geraldo Rivera, and Tribune) in a two-station, $167-million deal, affiliating with The WB.

WGNX became Atlanta&#x27;s new CBS affiliate on December 11, 1994. The Atlanta Hawks immediately moved to WATL.

One problem CBS would have faced with its planned move to WVEU remained unchanged with the move to WGNX-the loss of viewership in northeastern Georgia. The move to a UHF signal that did not reach as far as WAGA-TV&#x27;s VHF signal left 72,000 viewers unable to watch CBS programming over-the-air. This shortfall was resolved in October 1995, when the network affiliated with WNEG-TV in Toccoa. While licensed to a city in the Greenville–Spartanburg, South Carolina–Asheville, North Carolina market, WNEG-TV reached an area underserved by the network.

==== Meredith ownership ====

On August 23, 1998, Tribune Broadcasting announced it would sell WGNX to the Meredith Corporation for $370 million, as a three-way exchange deal in which Tribune would concurrently acquire Fox affiliate KCPQ in Tacoma, Washington, from Kelly Broadcasting. The trade made sense for Tribune and Meredith. Tribune&#x27;s portfolio of stations at this point consisted entirely of Fox and WB affiliates outside of WGNX, and Meredith already owned several CBS stations, with Atlanta becoming its largest TV station and representing a rare opportunity to acquire a major station in a top-10 media market.

Meredith began to make aggressive changes in an attempt to turn around the laggard WGNX, a station described by &quot;Mediaweek&quot; magazine as &quot;somewhat untended&quot;. Having long since outgrown its studio in Briarcliff, channel 46 began construction of new studios in Midtown as part of a plan to increase news output from 90 minutes a day to five hours.

On July 4, 2000, to reflect these changes, WGNX changed its station branding from &quot;CBS Atlanta&quot;—adopted the year prior in a recognition that the station was not channel 46 on cable—to &quot;Clear TV&quot; and adopted the call sign WGCL-TV. The station began broadcasting its newscasts from the Midtown studio on March 25, 2001.

After the resignation of Allen Shaklan, WGNX/WGCL-TV&#x27;s first general manager under Meredith, in 2002, the station dropped the &quot;Clear News&quot; format and hired Sue Schwartz, who had last run KTVK in Phoenix. Kevin O&#x27;Brien, president of Meredith&#x27;s television station group, identified turning WGCL-TV around as the company&#x27;s number one priority.

Beginning in 2009, Meredith began to hub master control operations for its two other southeastern stations—WHNS in Greenville, South Carolina, and WSMV-TV in Nashville—at WGCL-TV. By 2011, the hub was handling eight of Meredith&#x27;s twelve stations.

On January 18, 2011, Meredith Corporation entered into a local marketing agreement with the Turner Broadcasting System, owner of WPCH-TV, to assume operational control of the station and move its operations to the WGCL-TV studios. Production of the station&#x27;s 45 Atlanta Braves broadcasts was also transferred from Turner Sports to Fox Sports South as a result. Meredith purchased the station outright from Turner&#x27;s corporate parent, Time Warner, in 2017; as the only broadcast license held by the company, its divestiture was intended to remove a potential hurdle to the acquisition of Time Warner by AT&amp;T. From 2011 to 2013, WGCL-TV was the preseason television home of the Atlanta Falcons, with games moving to WUPA in 2014.

==== Sale to Gray Television; relaunch as &quot;Atlanta News First&quot; ====
On May 3, 2021, locally based Gray Television announced its intent to purchase the Meredith Local Media division, including WGCL-TV and WPCH, for $2.7 billion. The sale was completed on December 1. For Gray, a company whose Georgia roots date to 1897, channel 46 became the company&#x27;s flagship property and a springboard for major investments in Atlanta-area media. In 2022, Gray spent $30 million to acquire WKTB-CD, Atlanta&#x27;s Telemundo affiliate and the largest independently owned Telemundo outlet in the eastern United States, and co-owned Surge Digital Media, a boutique digital advertising agency; former owner Susan Sim Oh joined Gray at the conclusion of the sale, and Gray announced plans to relocate Telemundo Atlanta from its studios in Duluth to WGCL-TV. It also acquired WKSY-LD, a low-power station licensed to Summerville and Trion.

In addition, in 2021, Gray acquired Third Rail Studios, a film and television production facility located on the site of the former General Motors Doraville Assembly plant in Doraville; it then announced a partnership with NBCUniversal to run Third Rail and a major expansion of the Assembly complex slated to be completed in 2023.

On August 31, 2022, Gray announced that WGCL-TV and WPCH&#x27;s news programs would take on the umbrella brand of &quot;Atlanta News First&quot;, with WGCL-TV additionally changing its call sign to WANF, on September 30. In interviews, multiple station executives commented that they did not consider this a &quot;rebranding&quot; but a &quot;branding&quot;; in their view, channel 46 had no brand at all when Gray took over. According to general manager Erik Schrader, Gray wanted to bill WANF as a station with a very deep connection to Atlanta and which was owned by a locally headquartered company.

Gray and the Atlanta Hawks reached a deal in December 2023 to broadcast 10 games during the 2023–24 NBA season, primarily on Friday nights. All ten games would air on WPCH, with two of them simulcast by WANF. All games would be produced by Bally Sports Southeast.

==News operation==
===Independent era===
Even after Tribune—with its independent news operations in Chicago, New York, and Denver—acquired channel 46, launching a news department was not immediately on the station&#x27;s radar due to its expense. However, ratings began to rise, and after must carry rules for TV stations on cable systems were removed in 1987, management felt that WGNX needed to differentiate itself from cable channels to retain carriage. At one meeting, Tribune Broadcasting president Jim Dowdle asked general manager Ramsey while standing in the station parking lot, &quot;Don&#x27;t get excited, not now, but if we were to put a newsroom in that building, where would it go?&quot; After research showed enthusiasm for a possible newscast, the station prepared a cost-analysis to present to Tribune.

In July 1988, Tribune approved WGNX to start a 30-minute local newscast to air at 10 p.m. seven days a week. After an investment of several million dollars, &quot;Georgia&#x27;s News at Ten&quot; began broadcasting on January 15, 1989; prior to its launch, Atlanta had been the largest market in the United States without an independent prime time newscast. The newscast, which focused on longer reports, won awards from journalists&#x27; organizations and increased its ratings; in June 1990, it expanded to an hour when &quot;USA Tonight&quot;, a nationally syndicated news program produced by Tribune, was discontinued.

===Changes with CBS and &quot;Clear News&quot;===
When WGNX became a CBS affiliate, the 10 p.m. newscast moved to 11 p.m., and a briefly aired 7:30 p.m. newscast was dropped. Over the course of the next several years, the station slowly expanded its news output, with noon and 7 p.m. local newscasts in 1995; the latter moved to 6 p.m. in 1996.

In 1997, one series of billboards for the station featured news anchors Karyn Greer and John McKnight next to the words &quot;NAME &#x27;EM&quot;, daring viewers to take an interest in the relative unknowns on channel 46; the station&#x27;s newscasts were being outrated by other stations&#x27; presentations of syndicated programs including &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, &quot;Family Matters&quot;, and &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. By 1999, when Meredith took over, the 6 p.m. local news ranked seventh out of all seven major commercial stations in Atlanta in that time slot, and Allen Shaklan, the new general manager, noted that his station existed &quot;below people&#x27;s horizon of visibility&quot;. The station was producing just 90 minutes of news a day in three half-hour newscasts.

In 2000, as part of the image overhaul, with the new WGCL-TV call sign came a new moniker, &quot;Clear News&quot;, and a format focused on more substantive stories with fewer murders, fires, and accidents. The station also began airing a two-hour morning newscast and a 5 p.m. news hour as it was able to expand ahead of its move to Midtown. With the move, the station adopted a new green and gold set and theme music that was an orchestration of &quot;I Can See Clearly Now&quot;. However, Clear News was dismantled after the 2002 resignation of Allen Shaklan, and Sue Schwartz rebranded the station as &quot;CBS 46, Atlanta&#x27;s News Channel&quot;, with some limited initial success.

By 2005, the station had canceled its 5 p.m. newscast to focus on the less crowded 4 p.m. market and cut back its morning news presence to bolster its evening newscasts, which had the benefit of lead-ins from CBS prime time ratings. It then returned a 5 p.m. newscast in 2010, by which time it had expanded its morning newscast to hours.

The station usually came in fourth place in Atlanta&#x27;s news ratings behind WSB, WAGA and WXIA. Shortly before Gray closed on its purchase of WGCL-TV, Rodney Ho of &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; described the station as &quot;a bit of a revolving door news operation&quot;, noting that it was about to have its ninth news director since 2007.

===Gray news expansions===
After purchasing WGCL-TV–WPCH, Gray announced expansions in the news staff and offerings of the WGCL-TV newsroom, which was staffed by 50 to 60 people at the time Meredith sold it. In March 2022, Gray declared its intent to add 40 more news employees as well as 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. local newscasts; the staffing expansion ultimately materialized as an increase of 50. Two months later, WGCL-TV added a 7 p.m. newscast and began producing a 7–9 a.m. morning newscast for air on WPCH-TV, bringing the total weekday news output across the two stations to 11 hours a day. According to Schrader, Gray intended for channel 46 to be a &quot;community-focused local news service&quot; that emphasized breaking news, investigative journalism, and weather coverage. Both station and corporate executives said these moves were natural given Gray&#x27;s longstanding emphasis on local news; news director Kim Saxon pointed out that Gray CEO Hilton Howell regularly watched channel 46&#x27;s newscasts. The changes culminated in the implementation of the new &quot;Atlanta News First&quot; brand. A two-hour prime time news block also airs at 9 p.m. on WPCH-TV.

In its first spring sweeps as &quot;Atlanta News First&quot;, WANF finished fourth at 6 p.m. with only 34,000 viewers, barely half the viewership commanded by market-leading WSB-TV but within 4,000 viewers of third-place WXIA. Its 11 p.m. newscast was a distant fourth with 6,400 viewers, not even half of third-place WXIA&#x27;s total.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:


Cozi TV and Grit were added as subchannels in 2015.

WPCH-TV is Atlanta&#x27;s ATSC 3.0 (Next Gen TV) station, transmitting its own ATSC 3.0 signal as well as those of the market&#x27;s four major network affiliates (WSB, WAGA, WXIA and WANF). WANF in turn transmits WPCH&#x27;s primary subchannel.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
As WGCL-TV, this station ended regular programming over UHF channel 46 on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television; it retained its digital signal on UHF channel 19, using virtual channel 46. The analog signal continued to operate for another two weeks, until June 26, to broadcast information regarding the transition to digital television under the SAFER Act.

<doc id="765172" wikidata="Q2143290" url="?curid=765172" title="Legend of the Five Rings">
<text>Legend of the Five Rings (often abbreviated L5R) is a fictional setting created by John Zinser, Dave Seay, Ryan Dancey, Dave Williams, DJ Trindle, Matt Wilson and John Wick and first published by a joint venture between Alderac Entertainment Group and ISOMEDIA in 1995. The setting primarily involves the fictional empire of Rokugan, though some additional areas and cultures have been discussed. Rokugan is based roughly on feudal Japan with influences from other East Asian cultures such as China, Mongolia and Korea. This setting is the basis for the Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game as well as the Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game. Legend of the Five Rings was also the &quot;featured campaign setting&quot; of the &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; expansion to the third edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, though this book is now out of print.

The timeline of the &quot;Legends of the Five Rings&quot; setting can be influenced by players of the collectible card game, and to a lesser extent the role-playing game, with the winners of major tournaments making pivotal decisions that become canonical history in future products. The most significant example of this was the &quot;Race for the Throne&quot; event, which took place through 2007 and 2008, which allowed players of both the collectible card game and the role-playing game to affect the storyline of their Clan by earning points in various Spheres of influence.

L5R was acquired by Fantasy Flight Games in 2015. In 2020, FFG&#x27;s parent company Asmodee transferred L5R to another subsidiary, Edge Studio.

== Products ==

=== Collectible card game ===

The Legend of the Five Rings collectible card game is played by two or more players (in tournaments, generally two), each with two decks of at least 40 cards each (formerly at least 30 cards each). The game continues until a player has reached one of several different victory conditions, at which point that player is declared the winner. Victory conditions include winning militarily (destroying all provinces of one&#x27;s opponent), by honour (reaching a certain number of honour points), dishonour (forcing one&#x27;s opponent under a certain honour point threshold), through enlightenment (by putting cards called rings into play) or via a couple of special cards which essentially mean &quot;game won&quot;.

In the game&#x27;s tournaments players can affect the storyline of the game, their deck construction directly contributing to the lives (or deaths) of the characters involved. This is in turn reflected in future expansions of the game, and the mechanics of the cards therein. The full current rules of the collectible card game can be found at the Comprehensive Rules Site. The Kotei Season runs generally February through June of each year, where regional tournaments occur around the world. Each season incorporates a major event currently going on in the Emerald Empire, with each event determining at least one factor of the larger story. Kotei winners are pre-qualified into major events such as Gen Con and the European Championships, allowing them to skip the qualifying rounds.

Legend of the Five Rings has many cards that are directly influenced by players and their actions. These cards often feature an attribution on the vertical right side of the card, which includes the name of the player, the event, and the date involved in the creation of the card or theme behind the card. Having your name on a card is a goal of many players of Legend of the Five Rings.

The CCG ended its run in 2015 when Fantasy Flight Games acquired the game and converted it to a living card game.

===Role-playing game===

The Legend of the Five Rings Role-Playing Game is a role-playing game that requires one person to be game master and any number of other people to play different characters. There is no &quot;winner&quot; or &quot;loser&quot;, and the players do not generally compete against each other. Instead, the players work together to find a solution to some problem which the game master has presented their characters. The setting allows for stories which are oriented around action, courtly diplomacy or a mix of the two.

The Legend of the Five Rings Role-Playing Game is currently in its fifth edition. The first four editions used an original ruleset designed specifically for the setting. To distinguish this game system from the d20 System mechanics (see below), it is often referred to as the d10, &quot;classic&quot;, or the &quot;Roll &amp; Keep&quot; (&quot;R&amp;K&quot;) system.

In September 2017, after Legend of the Five Rings was purchased by Fantasy Flight, they announced a fifth edition of the RPG, which was released on October 11, 2018. It features an alternate version of the Roll and Keep system using special dice.

In 2020, FFG&#x27;s parent company Asmodee transferred FFG&#x27;s RPG lines, including Legend of the Five Rings, to Edge Studio, another subsidiary of Asmodee.

In August 2022, Edge Studio released &quot;Adventures in Rokugan&quot;, a roleplaying game set in Rokugan but utilizing a system compatible with the 5th Edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

===Live-action roleplaying===
In 2004 a live-action roleplay version of the game was released. Live-Action roleplaying has long been a major part of Legend of the Five Rings at events such as Gen Con. Heroes of Rokugan, a fan-run group, organizes yearly LARPs as part of their own storyline.

===Board games===
&quot;Clan War&quot; was a miniature based model strategy game produced by AEG, whose story line is derived from the Legend of the Five Rings setting. This game is currently out of print; in 2010, however, a limited selection of the metal miniatures used to play the game was released by Valiant Enterprises Ltd. A second Legend of the Five Rings board game titled &quot;Art of War&quot; has been demonstrated several times but never released.

In 2011 AEG released a board game titled &quot;War of Honor&quot;, which utilized the same cards as the collectible card game in a simplified game. Four complete decks were included with the game, making it self-contained, however additional cards can also be included. A second game, titled &quot;Ninja: Legend of the Scorpion Clan&quot;, was released the same year. This is a board game for 2–4 players in which one player takes the role of a Scorpion Clan ninja attempting to infiltrate a Lion Clan compound, with the other players defending it.

In 2013 a Legend of the Five Rings themed version of the card game &quot;Love Letter&quot; was released. Using a deck of 16 cards and taking roughly an hour to play, the game simulates the courtly intrigue surrounding the attempts of several players to court a princess.

In 2017, Fantasy Flight Games released &quot;Battle for Rokugan&quot;, an L5R-themed area-control strategy board game in which the clans fight to conquer regions on a map of Rokugan.

In 2024, Office Dog Games released &quot;River of Gold,&quot; an economic board game in which the players take the role of river merchants aligned with one of six clans from Rokugan, developing ports, trading resources, and accumulating local influence. 

=== Living card game ===

After Legend of the Five Rings was purchased by Fantasy Flight Games, they released a new version of the card game. Fantasy Flight&#x27;s version (renamed Legend of the Five Rings: The Card Game) is distributed as an introductory core set with periodical Clan Packs (which focus on a single clan) and Dynasty Packs (which have a variety of clan cards). Unlike the collectible card game version, the cards in the core set and packs are non-random.

The game is played by two players, each with two decks of 40–45 cards each. The game continues until a player has reached one of several different victory conditions, at which point that player is declared the winner. Victory conditions include breaking the province which holds their opponent&#x27;s stronghold, accumulating 25 honor, or having their opponent run out of honor. In the game&#x27;s tournaments players can affect the storyline of the game.

=== Video game ===
In 2023, Swedish game development studio Palindrome Interactive announced that they had partnered with publisher Asmodee to bring the franchise to the video game genre for the first time, with the game .

==Setting==

Legend of the Five Rings is set primarily in the fictional land of &quot;Rokugan&quot; (also known as the Emerald Empire), based on feudal Japan with influences from other East Asian cultures, where samurai, shugenja, and trained courtiers vie for control of the noble courts. Rokugan itself is home to mostly humans, divided into a society based on clans, with eight Great Clans and various minor ones, though at the moment they are all in confusion, and are vying for one of their members to be the new Emperor. They are regularly threatened by evil plots from within, but the main threat still lies to the southwest of Rokugan: the deadly wastes of the Shadowlands, where demonic hordes roam.

The world of L5R, which contains Rokugan, also contains the nations of the Burning Sands as well as the Ivory Kingdoms. A few foreign visitors from these lands have been featured in Legend of the Five Rings, but have not played a major role in the storyline. Much is unknown of these lands, mostly due to the extreme xenophobia of the Rokugani, shown in the story by an Imperial mandate of non-interaction with gaijin.

== History ==

=== Ownership ===
In 1997, FRPG was purchased by Wizards of the Coast. The existing licenses remained in place, so the same creative team continued work on Legend of the Five Rings, AEG continued publishing the RPG, and Wizards began publishing the card game. In 1999, Legend of the Five Rings changed hands once more when Wizards was purchased by toy-making giant Hasbro (however, &quot;Wizards&quot; continued operations under their original name). The previous licenses were still in effect, so changes to the games and the development teams as a result were unnoticeable. Wizards of the Coast re-released Oriental Adventures (a long out-of-print AD&amp;D supplement), changing the setting from the original Kara-Tur to Rokugan, and updating the supplement to the d20 rules. Several of the following sourcebooks provided dual (d20 &amp; d10/R&amp;K) rulesets.

In late 2000, however, speculation about the future of Legend of the Five Rings – especially the RPG – began to run rampant after Hasbro, during a string of decisions that greatly upset the leadership at Wizards, decided to sell Legend of the Five Rings two years before AEG&#x27;s long-standing license was due to expire. Any fears turned out to be unfounded when, less than half a year later, AEG won the bidding war for Legend of the Five Rings.

Until 2015, AEG owned Legend of the Five Rings. They designed and published the card game and the role-playing game. AEG released Lotus Edition for the CCG in late 2005, beginning the Age of Enlightenment story arc. Samurai Edition was released in July 2007 and included the Race for the Throne story arc. Celestial Edition was released in mid-2009, followed by Emperor Edition in early 2012 and Ivory Edition two years after that, in 2014. The final arc designed by AEG, Onyx Edition, was to be released in 2016.

On September 11, 2015, AEG and Fantasy Flight Games jointly announced that the setting had been sold to FFG. A new version of the card game (incompatible with the CCG) was released as a Living Card Game at Gen Con 2017.

=== Story Team ===
There have been five &#x27;eras&#x27; when it comes to the L5R Story Lead/Team.

The previous lead was Rich Wulf, assisted by Shawn Carman. Wulf&#x27;s works include Way of the Wolf, Bells of the Dead, Rokugan, and many other Legend of the Five Rings products. Large contributions to the Legend of the Five Rings series were also made by Ree Soesbee, who was lead writer of Legend of the Five Rings prior to Rich Wulf, and John Wick before her who along with the founding members of Five Rings Publishing Group created the world. While the property was controlled by Wizards of the Coast, the creation of the Four Winds arc (starting with Gold Edition) was helmed by Paul Allen Timm and Rob Heinsoo with contributions from Andy Heckt and Frank Chafe.

Currently, Shawn Carman is the head of the Legend of the Five Rings Story Team. He has had great success at incorporating player effects into the game in a smooth manner, regardless of how odd the results of a tournament may be to the setting of the game. His team includes Nancy Sauer, Brian Yoon, Yoon Ha Lee, and Robert Denton with Fred Wan acting as co-lead and continuity editor. The team formerly included Rusty Priske and Lucas Twyman.

=== International Olympic Committee legal issues ===

One legal issue for Legend of the Five Rings involved the use of a symbol that consisted of five interlocking rings, arranged in essentially a star pattern. This symbol was used for several years in the role-playing game and featured prominently on the backings of the cards in the collectible card game. The United States Olympic Committee sued Wizards of the Coast, who at that time owned Legend of the Five Rings, over the logo, because a special Act of the U.S. Congress gave them the exclusive rights to any symbol consisting of five interlocking rings.

The only way to completely resolve the issue was to quit using the symbol. For the role-playing game this meant very little, but for the collectible card game it meant that the backing of the cards had to be redesigned, which left players with a mix of cards that essentially resulted in marked decks. In an attempt to appease the players, Wizards released the first set with the different backs – Spirit Wars – bundled with opaque sleeves that would obscure the designs on the backs of the cards, allowing players to use any mix of cards in their decks.

<doc id="765175" wikidata="Q4698338" url="?curid=765175" title="Air lock">
<text>An air lock is a restriction of, or complete stoppage of liquid flow caused by vapour trapped in a high point of a liquid-filled pipe system. The gas, being less dense than the liquid, rises to any high points. This phenomenon is known as vapor lock, or air lock.

Flushing the system with high flow or pressures can help move the gas away from the highest point. Also, a tap (or automatic vent valve) can be installed to let the gas out.

Air lock problems often occur when one is trying to recommission a system after it has been deliberately (for servicing) or accidentally emptied. Take, for example, a central heating system using a circulating pump to pump water through radiators. When filling such a system, air is trapped in the radiators. This air has to be vented using screw valves built into the radiators. Depending on the pipe layout – if there are any upside down &#x27;U&#x27;s in the circuit – it will be necessary to vent the highest point(s). Otherwise, air lock may cause waterfall flow where the loss of hydraulic head is equal to the height of airlock; If the hydraulic grade line drops below the output of the pipe, the flow through that part of the circuit would stop completely. Note that circulating pumps usually do not generate enough pressure to overcome air locks.

==Undulating pipes==
A reservoir feeds a gravity distribution system, for drinking water or irrigation, with an outlet pipe going into the ground from the bottom of the reservoir. This pipe undulates with a series of alternating low points and high points. When the water drains from the reservoir, it will pass the first low point and fill as far as the first high point. If the water flow velocity is below the rising velocity of air bubbles, then water trickles down to the next low point and traps the remaining air between the first high point and the second low point.

As more water flows down, the upward leg after the second low point fills up. This exerts a pressure on the trapped air from the water on either side. If there is more water pressure from the section after the trapped air, then a full air lock is formed, and the water level stops at the first high point and no further water can flow. If there is more water pressure from the section before, then some water can flow, but the full pipe hydraulic head will not be reached and so flow is much less than expected. If there are further undulations, then the back pressure effects add together.

Long pipelines built across fairly level, but undulating land are bound to have many such high and low points. To avoid air or gas lock, automatic vents are fitted which let air or gas out when above a certain pressure. They may also be designed to let air in under vacuum. There are many other design considerations for design of water pipeline systems, e.g.

==Plumbing traps==

The air lock phenomenon can be used in a number of useful ways. An &#x27;S&#x27; trap (a pipe that descends from a reservoir, then curves back up, then down again) allows liquid to flow from top to bottom unhindered, and gas cannot flow through the trap unless it has enough extra pressure to overcome the liquid head of the trap. This is usually about 75 to 100 mm of water and prevents foul smelling air coming back from water drainage systems via connections to toilets, sinks and so on. &#x27;S&#x27; traps work well unless the drainage water has sand in it – which then collects in the &#x27;U&#x27; part of the &#x27;S&#x27;.

<doc id="765176" wikidata="Q7957641" url="?curid=765176" title="WXIA-TV">
<text>WXIA-TV (channel 11) is a television station in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, affiliated with NBC. It is owned by Tegna Inc. alongside MyNetworkTV affiliate WATL (channel 36). The two stations share studios at One Monroe Place on the north end of midtown Atlanta; WXIA-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located in the city&#x27;s east section, near Kirkwood. Atlanta is the largest television market where the NBC station is not owned and operated by the network.

WXIA-TV is popularly known within the Atlanta metropolitan area by its longtime on-air brand, 11 Alive, which the station has used since 1976.

==History==
What is known today as WXIA-TV originally signed on the air September 30, 1951, at 5 p.m., as WLTV on VHF channel 8. It was the first full time ABC affiliate for Atlanta, taking it over from WSB-TV and WAGA-TV (channel 5), both originally primary NBC and CBS affiliates respectively that previously shared ABC programming as a secondary affiliation. It was the third Atlanta television station to sign-on after WSB-TV and WAGA, all signing on within a three-year time frame.

Owned and operated by a group of Atlanta businessmen organized as Broadcasting, Inc., WLTV was indirectly born from the 1950 merger of Atlanta&#x27;s two newspapers. &quot;The Atlanta Journal&quot; had originally owned channel 8 as WSB-TV, while &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; held a construction permit for channel 2 as WCON-TV. Construction had already begun on the WCON-TV facilities when the Howell family, longtime owners of the &quot;Constitution&quot;, sold their paper to Cox Enterprises, owners of the &quot;Journal&quot;. However, Cox had a problem. At the time, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) did not permit the sale of television station construction permits, considering it &quot;trafficking&quot;. Cox had little option but to keep the WCON-TV construction permit rather than the already-operating WSB-TV. As such, it announced plans to move the WSB-TV intellectual unit to the stronger channel 2 facility when it was completed and sell its channel 8 license, which was acquired by Broadcasting, Inc., for $525,000. The sale was challenged by applicants for additional stations that were affected by the then-ongoing freeze on new construction permits, including Georgia Tech (owners of WGST radio) and Decatur radio station owner E.D. Rivers, in part because planned allocation changes meant that there would be no further commercial VHF stations for Atlanta, and they sought to operate the channel as well.

The FCC dismissed the complaints and approved the sale of the channel 8 license to Broadcasting, Inc., in August 1951. Testing for the new channel 2 began on September 25, 1951, and WSB-TV moved there on September 30. Channel 8 returned at 5 p.m. that day as WLTV. Due to the way the transfer was structured legally, WXIA operates under the license originally granted to WSB-TV, while the current WSB-TV license dates from 1951. Thus, the present-day channel 11 is the second-oldest broadcasting facility in the South; WSB-TV signed on in 1948, four months after WTVR-TV in Richmond, Virginia.

Several more large changes would come for WLTV in the years that followed. When the FCC lifted its freeze on new TV stations with the Sixth Report and Order in April 1952, it made several changes to television allocations and substituted channel 11 for 8 at Atlanta, modifying WLTV&#x27;s license to specify channel 11. The change coincided with the reallocation of channel 8 to non-commercial educational use at Athens and mitigated interference with channel 9 at Rome. The station would not change channels until September 1953, by which time Broadcasting, Inc., had sold WLTV to Cincinnati-based Crosley Broadcasting Corporation. In line with its other television stations, Crosley changed the call letters to WLWA (often rendered as &quot;WLW-A&quot;) on March 3, 1953.

In 1962, WLWA was purchased by Indianapolis businessman Richard Fairbanks, via his WIBC, Inc., as part of a settlement between Crosley and Fairbanks. Crosley had started WLWI (now WTHR) in Indianapolis in 1957, but Fairbanks insisted that the last VHF allocation in Indianapolis should go to a local owner. Eventually, the two companies agreed to what amounted to a trade, in which Crosley kept WLWI while Fairbanks bought WLWA. The Atlanta station&#x27;s call sign then became WAII-TV, using the slogan &quot;The Eyes of Atlanta&quot; and the calls standing for &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s 11&quot; (II). The station was sold to Pacific &amp; Southern Broadcasting in 1968 and on March 23 became known as WQXI-TV, aligning it with WQXI AM and FM (the calls had originally been used on channel 36, currently WATL, from 1954 to 1955). Pacific &amp; Southern later merged with Combined Communications Corporation; the merged company could not purchase both WQXI radio and television, as the FCC had barred new radio-television combinations in top 50 markets. The radio stations were sold to Jefferson-Pilot Broadcasting; as a result of the split, the station assumed the WXIA-TV call letters on December 24, 1973.

On September 20, 1976, WXIA first adopted &quot;11 Alive&quot; as its on-air branding, as part of Combined&#x27;s practice of using the word &quot;Alive&quot; as part of the brand of most of their stations (two stations not owned by Combined also adopted the &quot;11 Alive&quot; branding that same year, then-independent station WPIX (now a CW affiliate) in New York City—which used the brand until 1986, and NBC affiliate WIIC in Pittsburgh, now WPXI—which used it until 1979). In 1979, Combined merged with the Gannett Company in what became the largest media merger in history up to that time. Following the acquisition, most of the former Combined stations stopped using the &quot;Alive&quot; brand, though WXIA continued to call itself &quot;11 Alive&quot;.

On September 1, 1980, WXIA swapped affiliations with WSB-TV and became an NBC affiliate. This move could be traced to ratings: NBC slid to a very poor third place; meanwhile, ABC was in first place for most of the late 1970s and was seeking out affiliates with higher viewership in many markets, including Atlanta. ABC thus jumped at the chance to affiliate with longtime market leader WSB-TV. Some network daytime programs switched stations in August, before the full affiliation switch occurred. In 1993, Gannett dropped the &quot;11 Alive&quot; moniker as part of the introduction of new on-air graphics for its newscasts and promos; however, the brand was so well established in Atlanta that viewer outcry forced Gannett to restore it after only a month; even so, the &quot;11 Alive&quot; brand was not fully restored until 1996, when the &quot;11 Alive News&quot; title was restored for its newscasts (which were retitled &quot;11 News&quot; with the removal of the &quot;11 Alive&quot; brand).

On June 5, 2006, Gannett entered into an agreement to purchase WATL from the Tribune Company for $180 million, creating Atlanta&#x27;s first television duopoly; the sale was finalized on August 7, 2006. WATL occasionally airs NBC programs when WXIA is not able due to extended breaking news and severe weather coverage, or special programming. As a result of the WATL acquisition, WXIA management decided to house the combined operation at WATL&#x27;s facility at One Monroe Place, leaving WXIA&#x27;s longtime studios at 1611 West Peachtree Street; WXIA and WATL began broadcasting from the new studios on July 27, 2008.

Around the first week of October 2012, Gannett entered a dispute against Dish Network regarding compensation fees and Dish&#x27;s AutoHop commercial-skip feature on its Hopper digital video recorders. Gannett ordered that Dish discontinue AutoHop on the account that it is affecting advertising revenues for WXIA and WATL. Gannett threatened to pull both stations should the skirmish continue beyond October 7 and Dish and Gannett fail to reach an agreement. The two parties eventually reached an agreement after extending the deadline for a few hours.

On June 29, 2015, the Gannett Company split in two, with one side specializing in print media and the other side specializing in broadcast and digital media. WXIA and WATL were retained by the latter company, named Tegna.

On January 24, 2019, WXIA debuted a new station logo for the first time in 26 years; the &quot;11&quot; in the new logo is similar to Louisville sister station WHAS-TV.

==Programming==
The station previously aired a program called &quot;Noonday&quot; for many years, beginning with the news at noon and at 12:30 continuing on for the rest of the hour with features, akin somewhat to the &quot;Today Show&quot;. This program was canceled in 1997, but the half-hour noon newscast was preceded by the hour-long &quot;Atlanta &amp; Company&quot;, a program which has some similar features, but is partly paid for by the companies featured on it, until 2015, when the noon newscast was canceled. The program then expanded to 90 minutes, currently running from 11 to 12:30 p.m.

===Sports programming=== 
Owing to NBC&#x27;s longstanding contract with the International Olympic Committee, WXIA was the local broadcaster for the 1996 Summer Olympics held in Atlanta. It also carried the Atlanta Braves&#x27; World Series victory the previous year (coverage alternated between NBC and ABC as part of &quot;The Baseball Network&quot;, so WSB had Games 1, 4 and 5, while WXIA received Games 2, 3 and the clinching sixth game; all Braves games on NBC&#x27;s MLB broadcast contract from 1981 to 1989 (and before that, from 1976 to 1980 with ABC&#x27;s broadcast contract) and postseason games in select years from 1996 to 2000 were also broadcast on WXIA which include their 1999 World Series appearance). WXIA also aired a Braves game in 2023 as part of a simulcast between NBC and Peacock&#x27;s &quot;MLB Sunday Leadoff&quot; package. From its switch to NBC in 1980 up to 1997, all Atlanta Falcons involving them playing an AFC team at home were aired on WXIA. Today, the station airs any Falcons contests under NBC&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; banner (afternoon games air either on WAGA or WANF). The station also provided local coverage of Super Bowl XXVIII, which was hosted at the Georgia Dome. WXIA also aired all Atlanta Hawks games carried through NBC&#x27;s NBA coverage from 1990 to 2002.

===News operation===
WXIA presently broadcasts 33 hours, 25 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 5 hours, 35 minutes each weekday, hours on Saturdays and two hours on Sundays). It also produces a half-hour prime time newscast at 10 p.m. for sister station WATL, which competes with the longer-running hour-long 10 p.m. newscast on Fox-owned WAGA-TV. The station&#x27;s Doppler weather radar site is located west of Atlanta in far southern Cobb County, south-southwest of Mableton, on the south side of Interstate 20 not far west of Six Flags Over Georgia.

The station began calling its newscasts &quot;News Watch&quot; in 1963 and began broadcasting news in color for the first time on March 20, 1967. From the early 1970s onward, channel 11&#x27;s newscasts waged a spirited battle with WAGA for second place behind long-dominant WSB-TV. When WAGA switched to Fox in 1994, WXIA surged to become a solid runner-up, usually finishing well ahead of perennial third-place finisher WGCL-TV; however, by May 2009, WXIA&#x27;s ratings had been surpassed by WGCL at noon and 11 p.m. The morning news program &quot;Today in Atlanta&quot; had experienced a 40% ratings drop, leaving them a very distant third behind the local morning shows on WSB and WAGA, and sometimes fourth behind WGCL.

WXIA formerly had a partnership with The Weather Channel to use their weather forecasters and provide local weather forecasts (incidentally, NBCUniversal—which owns NBC through parent company Comcast, Atlanta&#x27;s primary cable television provider—held a majority ownership stake in The Weather Channel until 2018). WXIA became the first Atlanta station to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition on February 2, 2006. As part of the conversion to HD, a new HD-ready news set from Production Design Group, Ltd. was built and the station began using a new graphics package from Giant Octopus.

In February 2010, WXIA began a nightly news segment, &quot;Bull Fighters&quot;, which consists of eight reporters/anchors; the segment is usually provided by former WAGA sports reporter Jeff Hullinger. On April 28, 2010, a new 4:30 a.m. newscast called &quot;Wake Up with Chesley&quot; debuted, featuring meteorologist Chesley McNeil and travel producer Matt Holmes; in addition to news updates throughout the show, McNeil primarily gives weather updates while Holmes gives travel delays and information. On January 29, 2013, on the noon broadcast, WXIA debuted the new Gannett standardized graphics and music (&quot;This is Home&quot; by Gari Media Group); their renovated studio debuted on February 12, 2013.

On January 29, 2015, WXIA announced that the 5 p.m. newscast would return for the first time since 2003, when &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; took over that time slot; that show moved to the 3 p.m. timeslot. However, the new newscast came at the cost of ending its noon and 7 p.m. newscasts, which were replaced by an extension of &quot;Atlanta &amp; Company&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, respectively (the latter reversing its 2007 move from WXIA to WATL). These changes went into effect on March 2, 2015.

Between July 31 and August 28, 2017, WXIA underwent a significant relaunch of its news department, mirroring a similar move that was made by Tampa Bay sister station WTSP in April of that same year. The station renamed its morning and late-night newscasts as &quot;Morning Rush ATL&quot; and &quot;The Late Feed,&quot; respectively. Shiba Russell, who came over from NBC O&amp;O station WNBC the previous year, became the solo anchor of &quot;Morning Rush ATL&quot;, while Vinnie Politan became the anchor of &quot;The Late Feed&quot;.

In March 2020, WXIA relaunched its noon newscast; however, it was meant to be temporary due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In June 2021, WXIA re-titled its morning and late-night newscasts once again; the former is now titled &quot;11 Alive Morning News&quot; and the latter, which had been renamed from &quot;The Late Feed&quot; to &quot;Up Late&quot; following Vinnie Politan&#x27;s departure from the station in November 2018, returned to the previous &quot;11 Alive News at 11&quot; title.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

The NBC Weather Plus service was discontinued on December 1, 2008; however, some stations, including WXIA, continued to air national and local radar with Weather Plus branding, supplied by The Weather Channel through the end of December. In January, WXIA rebranded the channel &quot;11Alive Weather&quot; and kept the &quot;L-Bar&quot; with weather information from The Weather Channel, but shifted the remainder of the content to a local radar loop, and eliminated the background music that aired with it. It was later rebranded as the &quot;11Alive Weather Information Zone&quot; or &quot;WIZ&quot; in 2010, along with the weather segments during newscasts on the main channel. This service was also carried on digital cable in the Atlanta area through Charter Spectrum and Comcast.

In early December 2010, the WIZ was moved to WATL, and aired on channel 36.2, while 11.2 continued to air a static message graphic directing over-the-air viewers to tune there and re-scan if necessary. One month later, on January 10, the channel was removed completely from WXIA, and 11.3 became 11.2, before being reversed the following day. In 2011, Atlanta-based Bounce TV launched on September 26 with WATL 36.2 as its &quot;de facto&quot; flagship affiliate, with the WIZ channel being restored two weeks later on 36.3. In early October, 11.2 again became Universal Sports and 11.3 was deleted and was reversed again a week later, with WIZ bounced back to its original channel 11.2. In November 2011, 11.3 was deleted leaving 36.3 as the sole channel for Universal Sports until it became a cable channel in 2012. Eventually, WIZ was converted from being presented using internal station weather computers to presentation and programming from The Local AccuWeather Channel. But an agreement with WAGA-TV and AccuWeather has made WXIA switch its programming and presentation to WeatherNation TV.

The station added Universal Sports at the beginning of May 2009 on channel 11.3, added it to 36.3 in October 2011, and then deleted it from 11.3 in November 2011. However, it used severe video data compression, which left very obvious blurriness and pixelation during high-motion scenes common in sports. This low-bitrate sacrifice protects the quality of the main HD channel and is unavoidable because Universal Sports transmits its programming via satellite in this highly compressed form (4.48 Mbit/s). It was therefore not originally transmitted on sister station WATL (virtual channel 36.3, digital channel 25) because it would look the same there, and that station&#x27;s bandwidth is being used for mobile television (ATSC-M/H), including WXIA&#x27;s mobile channels. Additionally, mobile communications work better on higher UHF TV channels than on low VHF ones.

In early 2018, the station added new network Quest on new subchannel 11.4, taking over many of WXIA-DT2&#x27;s cable slots and leaving that station for the most part exclusive to over-the-air customers.

In February 2020, WeatherNation TV was replaced by a VHF simulcast of WATL on subchannel 11.2. The simulcast ended on April 5, 2021, when it was replaced with Twist after the network launched.

=== Analog-to-digital conversion ===
WXIA-TV originally had the only VHF allotment for digital television in the area, until WGTV (channel 8) was moved from UHF 22 to VHF 12 (now 8). The station shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 11, on June 12, 2009, at 12:30 p.m., as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 10, using virtual channel 11.

<text>Nathan Roscoe Pound (October 27, 1870 – June 28, 1964) was an American legal scholar and educator. He served as dean of the University of Nebraska College of Law from 1903 to 1911 and was dean of Harvard Law School from 1916 to 1936. He was a member of Northwestern University, the University of Chicago Law School and the faculty at UCLA School of Law in the school&#x27;s early years, from 1949 to 1952. &quot;The Journal of Legal Studies&quot; has identified Pound as one of the most cited legal scholars of the 20th century.

==Early life and education==
Pound was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, to Stephen Bosworth Pound and Laura Pound. His sister was the noted linguist and folklorist, Louise Pound.

Pound studied botany at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, where he became a member of the Acacia fraternity. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1888 and his master&#x27;s degree in 1889. In 1889 he began the study of law; he spent one year at Harvard but never received a law degree. Following his year at Harvard, he returned to Nebraska where he passed the bar without a law degree. He received the first PhD in botany from the University of Nebraska in 1898. From 1899 to 1907, he taught law on the faculty of the University of Nebraska law school.

==Career==
In 1903, Pound became dean of the University of Nebraska College of Law. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1911. That same year, he began teaching at Harvard and in 1916 became dean of Harvard Law School and served in that role until 1937. He wrote &quot;Spurious Interpretation&quot; in 1907, &quot;Outlines of Lectures on Jurisprudence&quot; in 1914, &quot;The Spirit of the Common Law&quot; in 1921, &quot;Law and Morals&quot; in 1924, and &quot;Criminal Justice in America&quot; in 1930.

In 1908 he was part of the founding editorial staff of the first comparative law journal in the United States, the &quot;Annual Bulletin&quot; of the Comparative Law Bureau of the American Bar Association. In 1909, he taught at the University of Chicago Law School. Although it is not often remembered now, Pound was a Roman law scholar. He taught that subject at Nebraska, Northwestern and Harvard. Pound was sufficiently adept at Latin to translate Roman law into English for a sourcebook he used for those classes, and he was said by Professor Joseph Henry Beale to have &quot;brought the spirit of Roman law to Harvard.&quot; Pound was also the founder of the movement for &quot;sociological jurisprudence,&quot; an influential critic of the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;liberty of contract&quot; (freedom of contract) line of cases, symbolized by &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot; (1905), and one of the early leaders of the movement for American Legal Realism, which argued for a more pragmatic and public-interested interpretation of law and a focus on how the legal process actually occurred, as opposed to (in his view) the arid legal formalism which prevailed in American jurisprudence at the time. According to Pound, these jurisprudential movements advocated &quot;the adjustment of principles and doctrines to the human conditions they are to govern rather than to assumed first principles.&quot; While Pound was dean, law school registration almost doubled, but his standards were so rigorous that one-third of those matriculated did not receive degrees. Among these were many of the great political innovators of the New Deal years.

In 1929 President Herbert Hoover appointed Pound as one of the eleven primary members of the Wickersham Commission on issues relating to law enforcement, criminal activity, police brutality, and Prohibition.

During Roosevelt&#x27;s first term, Pound initially supported the New Deal. In 1937, however, Pound turned against the New Deal and the Legal Realism movement altogether after Roosevelt proposed packing the federal courts and bringing independent agencies into the executive branch. Other factors contributing to this &quot;lurking conservatism&quot; within Pound included bitter battles with liberals on the Harvard law faculty, the death of his wife, and a sharp exchange with Karl Llewellyn. Pound, however, had for years been an outspoken advocate of these court and administrative reforms that Roosevelt proposed and it was acknowledged that he only became conservative because he saw an opportunity to gain attention after his Harvard colleagues had turned on his ideas of government reform after Roosevelt had proposed them.

In 1937 Pound resigned as Dean of Harvard Law School to become a University Professor and soon became a leading critic of the legal realists. He proposed his ideas of government reform to Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek. In 1934 Pound received an honorary degree from the University of Berlin, presented by the German ambassador to the United States. Pound was among the famous American jurists to express a liking for Adolf Hitler.

In the 1940s, Pound was apparently favourably disposed to replacing John P. Higgins as a judge on the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, which was conducting a war crimes trial in Tokyo, though an appointment did not eventuate. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1940. He joined the faculty of UCLA School of Law in 1949, the year the law school opened, and remained on the faculty until 1952.

===Criminal justice in Cleveland===

In 1922 Roscoe Pound and Felix Frankfurter undertook a detailed quantitative study of crime reporting in Cleveland newspapers for the month of January 1919, using column inch counts. They found that in the first half of the month, the total amount of space given over to crime was 925in., but in the second half, it leapt to 6642in. This was despite the fact that the number of crimes reported had increased only from 345 to 363. They concluded that although the city&#x27;s much publicized &quot;crime wave&quot; was largely fictitious and manufactured by the press, the coverage had a very real consequence for the administration of criminal justice.

Because the public believed they were in the middle of a crime epidemic, they demanded an immediate response from the police and the city authorities. The agencies, wishing to retain public support, complied, caring &quot;more to satisfy popular demand than to be observant of the tried process of law.&quot; The result was a greatly increased likelihood of miscarriages of justice and sentences more severe than the offenses warranted.

===Contribution to jurisprudence===
Roscoe Pound also made a significant contribution to jurisprudence in the tradition of sociological jurisprudence, which emphasized the importance of social relationships in the development of law and vice versa. His best-known theory consists of conceptualizing law as social engineering. According to Pound, a lawmaker acts as a social engineer by attempting to solve problems in society using law as a tool. Pound argued that laws must be understood by examining the &quot;interests&quot; that they serve. These &quot;interests&quot; might be individual interests, such as the protection of an individual&#x27;s life or property, or broader social interests.

==Personal life==
In 1903, Pound co-founded the Society of Innocents, the preeminent senior honor society at Nebraska. He was a Freemason and was a member and Past Master of Lancaster Lodge No. 54 AF &amp; AM in Lincoln, Nebraska. He also served as Deputy Grand Master for the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts in 1915 and delivered a series of Masonic lectures for the Grand Lodge in March and April 1916. He helped found The Harvard Lodge A.F. &amp; A.M. along with Divinity School professor Kirsopp Lake and others.

In 1946, Pound helped the 22-year-old Charlie Munger, later a successful businessman and investor, to get into Harvard Law school.

==Posthumous honors==
Pound was inducted into the Nebraska Hall of Fame in 1976.

<text>Voice-tracking, also called cyber jocking and referred to sometimes colloquially as a robojock, is a technique employed by some radio stations in radio broadcasting to produce the illusion of a live disc jockey or announcer sitting in the radio studios of the station when one is not actually present. It is one of the notable effects of radio homogenization.

==Background==
Voice-tracking refers to the process of a disc jockey prerecording their on-air &quot;patter&quot;. It is then combined with songs, commercials, and other elements in order to produce a product sounding like a live air shift. Voice-tracking has become common on many music radio stations, particularly during evening, overnight, weekend, and holiday time periods. Most radio station owners consider it an economical alternative to employing live disc jockeys around the clock.

The process goes back decades and was very common on FM stations in the 1970s. At that time, elements were recorded on reel-to-reel magnetic tapes and broadcast cartridges and played by specialized professional audio equipment. It has become more controversial recently as computer technology permits the process to be more flexible and less expensive, allowing for fewer station employees and an effective illusion of live, local programming. With the repeal of the FCC&#x27;s Main Studio Rule in 2017, these studios have begun to be shut down, and a station can be centralcast from a radio group&#x27;s headquarters thousands of miles away with the only localization occurring with weather forecasts, local news (if even broadcast) and local advertising.

Most contemporary broadcast automation systems at music stations effectively function as high-tech jukeboxes. Pieces of audio footage are digitized as computer files and saved on one or more hard drives. Station personnel create &quot;program logs&quot; which list exactly what is supposed to be on the air and in what order. The computer follows the instructions set out in the playlist.

==Variations==
In some cases, voice-tracking is done to give station employees the flexibility to carry out other responsibilities. For example, a DJ may also have managerial duties as a program director or general manager. Voice-tracking allows that person to record a three-hour air shift in considerably less time, freeing them up to do office work. Alternatively, a popular live weekday morning host can record voice tracks throughout the week for a Saturday show, allowing them to be on the air six days a week without extra physical presence each Saturday. 

Companies housing more than one station can use the technique to stretch out their air staff. For example, the live midday disc jockey on a country station can then record voice tracks for the overnight shift of the sister rock station (often using a different name).

Some &quot;cyber jocks&quot; provide voice-tracking services for several different radio syndication stations (and in several radio formats), sometimes affiliates located hundreds of miles away from each other that are all part of a radio network.

One notorious form of voice-tracking involves using out-of-market talent. In this form, the station contracts with a disc jockey in another city (often employed by the same corporation, but sometimes as a freelancer). The outsider will add local color using information provided by the station and news stories gleaned from newspapers available on the Internet. The recorded voice tracks are then sent to the station. DJs of this style often make a point of trying to sound as local as possible, sometimes going so far as falsely claiming to have visited a local landmark or attended a station&#x27;s promotional event. However, sometimes the DJ has actually been to the location, or monitored the event online and can speak with knowledge about it without making a claim to having been there that day, although it may be implied. 

One type of use is to provide smaller-market radio stations with a polished, &quot;big city&quot; sound using experienced disc jockeys from larger cities who can produce content quicker than younger or less-experienced (often local) talent.

Others may prefer to use smaller market talent (who are paid less than their counterparts in major markets) to voice-track on their larger stations, thus eliminating the need for higher-paid air talent in the larger markets. See the &quot;controversy&quot; section below for more.

A common example of voice-tracking technology is a DJ recording their voice over the end of one track and into the beginning of another. These tracks (with the voice transition covering the end of one and the start of the next) are then played on air to give the listener the effect of a live show. This and other similar work can often be done remotely with the cyber jock able to plug directly into the station&#x27;s automated system. Time checks are often interspersed to further the perception of a live show. 

These and similar techniques, like prerecorded time checks, greatly add to perception that a show is being broadcast live. When used correctly the average listener and even professionals may not be able to tell the difference between a live and a prerecorded show.

==Formatics==
Different radio stations want their DJs to speak only at certain times, so cyber jocks have to be made aware of each station&#x27;s rules and broadcast clock. What follows is an example.

At example station ZZZZ, the DJs have to follow certain rules within its clock. These are called formatics. Armed with the knowledge of these rules, the clock, and with the station&#x27;s music log, the cyber jock can recreate what the finished radio program should sound like. 
*DJs have to backsell (or give the title and artist of a song played previously) three songs before playing the commercials at 22 minutes past the hour.
*DJs have to read or play a pre-recorded weather forecast at 44 minutes past the hour 
*DJs have to play the station&#x27;s legally required identification near the top of the hour 
*DJs are allowed to speak only over the song&#x27;s instrumental portion at the beginning. (As depicted in the example below)

As an example, see the following graphic:&lt;br&gt;
As song one begins to fade out the next song begins. In this case, the DJ does not start talking until the second song starts, and they stop at the point that the song&#x27;s vocals start. This interval is called an intro, ramp, or post. This is the most common method. If the cyber jock knows the song that their voice will be played over, they know how much time they have until they have to stop talking to avoid talking over the vocals of the song. If they time their speech correctly, they will do just that. DJs call this &quot;Pegging the Post&quot; or &quot;hitting the post&quot;.

If the station employs other methods of doing this, the cyber jock should be familiar with them, and can alter their speech and timing to accommodate them or use software to adjust the speed of their natural voice to fit the ramp and hit the post. Cyber jocks can also listen to tapes of other people on the station to get an idea of the overall sound the station is working toward.

==Controversy==
Voice-tracking has been a hotly contested issue within radio circles. Claims were made that the sense of locality is lost, especially when a station employs a disc jockey who has never set foot in that station&#x27;s town. There is also concern about voice-tracking taking away job opportunities and providing fewer opportunities for disc jockeys in the amounting radio homogenization.

Still, supporters of voice-tracking contend that a professional presentation on the air by an outsider is preferable to using a local DJ who is not very good. They claim listeners generally like the sound, usually cannot tell that there is not a live disc jockey, and often do not care about the issue even when told. This, however, is not always the case, especially in towns where names have unusual pronunciations; if an out-of-market disc jockey cannot pronounce the name of a fairly common town in the market (for instance, a common barometer in the Milwaukee market is the proper pronunciation of the suburban community of Oconomowoc), it is often a dead giveaway that the jockey is voice-tracked from out of market. Because of this, out-of-market DJs will often avoid making references to local information to avoid any possible faux pas. Some DJs will be trained to pronounce location information or be briefed on local news and events in the area they are serving. 

Proponents also claim that the cost savings gleaned from judicious use of voice-tracking can help keep a struggling station afloat. In those cases, they argue, the process is actually &quot;saving&quot; other jobs.

Since voice-tracking is designed to work without human intervention, stations using the process may have no one in the building at all outside of business hours. However, a station manager can often log into the station&#x27;s main computer system from home (or other remote location) in certain instances, such as if a song track is not working properly. Malfunctions in the automation equipment or programming after hours, resulting in dead air or a continuous repeating loop, can go on for hours before being corrected by management.

Another concern is how to alert the public in the event of emergencies, such as weather emergencies like tornado warnings, oncoming hurricanes and blizzard situations, along with other emergencies such as a train derailment or hazardous materials situation. In these cases, other automated systems come into play. Emergency Alert System (EAS) equipment is programmed to automatically break into whatever is playing and deliver information to the listener, usually using audio from a local government weather radio service. Often if severe weather conditions are known, a live person is &quot;on-call&quot; to stay at the station and give out details about the situation. For other stations, a &#x27;news sharing&#x27; agreement with a television station allows them to carry the audio of a television station during a breaking news or weather situation, allowing warning of the events without the costs of hiring extra staff.

<text>WATL (channel 36) is a television station in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, affiliated with MyNetworkTV. It is owned by Tegna Inc. alongside NBC affiliate WXIA-TV (channel 11). The two stations share studios at One Monroe Place on the north end of midtown Atlanta. WATL&#x27;s transmitter shares a broadcast tower with several other local stations near North Druid Hills, just northeast of the city.

==History==

===Early history===
In the fall of 1952, Robert Rounsaville, the owner of radio station WQXI (790 AM) in Atlanta, applied for a construction permit to build the first UHF station in the city on channel 36, which was granted on November 19, 1953. On October 26, 1954, the FCC granted a Special Temporary Authority to begin commercial operation under the call sign WQXI-TV. Actual full-time programming began on December 18, 1954. Rounsaville also had construction permits for UHF stations in Louisville, Kentucky (WQXL-TV), and Cincinnati, Ohio (WQXN-TV), which were never placed in operation. An article on the history of WQXI-TV relates how the station shared a house in the northeast Atlanta area of Buckhead at 3165 Mathieson Drive with WQXI radio. In addition, the programming included old movies, live interview shows, a Saturday-evening barn dance and a live bingo game show. Because expensive UHF converters were required, the station could not attract enough viewers to make the station successful; as a result, WQXI-TV signed off on May 31, 1955, after less than six months on the air. (The WQXI call sign was later used on Channel 11, now-sister station WXIA-TV, from 1968 to 1974.) Despite being off the air, the call letters were changed to WATL-TV in early 1956.

On August 17, 1964, the FCC announced that an application had been filed to transfer the WATL-TV construction permit from Robert Rounsaville to Daniel H. Overmyer for a price of $100,000; FCC approval of the transfer was granted on May 12, 1965. At the time of the FCC sale approval, Overmyer owned construction permits for two UHF stations, WDHO-TV in Toledo and WNOP-TV in Cincinnati. In addition, he was in the process of buying existing construction permits for two other UHF stations in San Francisco (KBAY-TV, channel 20) and Pittsburgh (WAND-TV, channel 53), as well as applying for new UHF stations in Houston and Dallas. Neither of the Overmyer-owned stations had signed on by the time of the FCC approval of the channel 36 purchase. Under Overmyer, the station permit bore the call letters WBMO-TV, for his daughter, Barbara Morton Overmyer; it was to have been one of the owned-and-operated stations of the new Overmyer Network, (later United Network), which folded at the end of May 1967 after only a single month of broadcasting.

Channel 36 would remain dark until the station was relaunched on August 16, 1969, having returned to the WATL-TV call letters. It was jointly owned by the U.S. Communications Corporation station group of Philadelphia, a subsidiary of AVC, holding an 80 percent interest and the remaining 20% by Overmyer. Overmyer had previously sold the majority interest (80%) in the construction permits for Atlanta, Cincinnati, San Francisco, Pittsburgh and Houston to AVC on March 28, 1967, with FCC approval of their sale coming December 8, 1967. None of the stations were on the air at the time of their sale to AVC, but U.S. built all but one: WATL-TV, WXIX-TV, KEMO-TV and WPGH-TV, in addition to owning Philadelphia&#x27;s WPHL-TV. The Houston station (KJDO-TV) was never constructed; the permit was deleted by the FCC in October 1971.

U.S. Communications reportedly spent $1 million on programming in the first year, including &quot;Lost in Space&quot; and a block of dinnertime game shows. Ted Turner&#x27;s WTCG (channel 17, later WTBS and now WPCH-TV), which had been operating two years longer, spent far less on programming and survived. WATL was also the first station in the country to run music videos all weekend, on a show called &quot;The Now Explosion&quot;.

On March 24, 1971, Frank Minner Jr., the president of U.S. Communications Corporation, announced at an Atlanta press conference that, due to low advertising revenue, WATL-TV (and KEMO-TV) would go off the air on March 31. The last full broadcast day was March 31, 1971, and the station signed off in the early morning hours of April 1. For about a week before it left the air, the station ran :30-second announcements with a photograph of its studios at 1810 Briarcliff Road. Turner&#x27;s first move after acquiring WTCG, the UHF station that would serve as the foundation of his media empire, was to take &quot;The Now Explosion&quot; from WATL.

In July 1971, U.S. Communications Corporation put WATL-TV and KEMO-TV up for sale.

===Stability, then transition from independent station to Fox===
On July 17, 1974, two and a half years after filing to buy the station, the Briarcliff Communications Group received FCC approval to purchase the construction permit for WATL-TV from U.S. Communications Corporation for $23,500. Briarcliff Communications was partially owned (30.5%) by Don Kennedy, a well-known broadcaster in Atlanta; Kennedy started WKLS-FM in the early 1960s and also the Georgia News Network, providing statewide news to radio stations. He was also the host known as Officer Don of the children&#x27;s TV show &quot;The Popeye Club&quot; on WSB-TV from 1956 until switching the show to &quot;Officer Don&#x27;s Club House&quot; on WATL-TV in 1969. On July 5, 1976, Kennedy returned channel 36 to the air for good. The existing transmitter facilities were used, but the studios were now located at 1800 Peachtree Road, rather than the previous Briarcliff Road location.

Channel 36 ran public domain movies, financial news, low-budget local shows, religious programs, and a blend of CBS, NBC and ABC shows pre-empted from WAGA-TV, WSB-TV and WXIA-TV, respectively. One popular local program in 1976–77 was &quot;The Kids&#x27; Show with Otis&quot;, where segments featuring a puppet named Otis, played by a teenaged puppeteer named Steve Whitmire, played as interstitials between public-domain black-and-white cartoons. Whitmire&#x27;s work on the show won him an audition with Jim Henson and led to a nearly four-decade-long career with the Muppet organization, playing iconic characters such as Rizzo the Rat, Bean Bunny, Wembley Fraggle, and (after Henson&#x27;s death in 1990) Kermit the Frog and Ernie. The station also made a brief venture into subscription television with a trial in late 1980 and early 1981, but it opted not to move forward after the trial.

The station introduced several program changes, including daily business programming from the Financial News Network, in late 1981, but financial difficulties caused Briarcliff to search for a buyer. In 1982, the station was sold to Sillerman Morrow Broadcasting, an owner of radio stations formed by Robert F. X. Sillerman and Bruce &quot;Cousin Brucie&quot; Morrow. In the fall of 1983, WATL moved toward a more traditional independent schedule with a couple cartoons, a few westerns, and a few classic sitcoms plus more movies. Then in 1984, the station was sold again, this time to Outlet Communications; the sale closed in early 1985, having been intentionally delayed to allow buyer and seller to take advantage of new tax breaks. Gradually, WATL acquired stronger programming such as &quot;Cheers&quot;, &quot;Webster&quot;, and &quot;Family Ties&quot;, as well as newer syndicated cartoons as these became abundant by 1985. Outlet also built new studios for the station. Even though competing independent WGNX (channel 46, now CBS affiliate WANF) billed more than twice WATL in 1986, it was WATL that became one of the charter affiliates of the newly launched Fox Broadcasting Company on October 9, 1986. All of this upgrading left the station $65 million in debt by 1989, $43 million of which was already on the books when Outlet purchased the station.

Outlet continued to own the station until 1989, when Outlet sold WATL, along with WXIN in Indianapolis, to Chase Broadcasting for $120 million. By then, the station was called &quot;Fox 36&quot;. In 1992, WATL and WXIN were included in Chase&#x27;s merger with Renaissance Broadcasting. Less than a year later, WATL was sold to Fox Television Stations outright and channel 36 became a Fox owned-and-operated station—the first network-owned station in Atlanta. Fox was in the planning stages for a news department at the station, and WATL had even gone as far as hiring a news director. However, on May 22, 1994, New World Communications announced an affiliation agreement with Fox, months after the network won the broadcast rights to the NFL&#x27;s National Football Conference. In this deal, most of New World-owned longtime &quot;Big Three&quot;-affiliated stations, including Atlanta&#x27;s longtime CBS affiliate WAGA, would switch over to the Fox network. As a result, Fox canceled the plans for a newscast on WATL and put the station up for sale.

CBS, which was losing WAGA as an affiliate, made an offer to buy WATL, but backed out after Fox demanded $120 million, far more than CBS was willing to spend on the soon-to-be independent station. At that point, it almost seemed likely that WATL would join the soon-to-launch United Paramount Network (UPN) in early 1995. Rival station WGNX, then owned by Tribune Broadcasting was already slated to join The WB and had turned CBS down, forcing CBS to make a deal to buy WVEU. Eventually, however, Tribune agreed to let WGNX join CBS, and WVEU became the UPN affiliate.

===Changing affiliations and owners===
Fox programming moved from WATL to WAGA on December 10, 1994, with WATL briefly reverting to an independent station under the branding &quot;WATL 36&quot;. Not long after that, Fox subsequently sold the station to Qwest Broadcasting, a company partially owned by musician Quincy Jones and Tribune Broadcasting (Fox would not be without an owned-and-operated station in Atlanta for long, as it bought WAGA and the other New World stations in late 1996). Although it lost the Fox affiliation, WATL kept Fox Kids programming, which was not cleared by WAGA; outside of the loss of the prime time Fox shows and weekend sports, channel 36&#x27;s programming was largely unchanged. WATL did affiliate with The WB in January 1995; since the sale to Qwest Broadcasting would not be finalized until December 14, 1995, the station ended up under the unusual distinction of being affiliated with one network while owned by another, as for nearly a year WATL operated as a WB affiliate (under the branding &quot;WB 36&quot;) owned by Fox. In 1999, Tribune sold WGNX to the Meredith Corporation; the company then purchased WATL outright in February 2000. WATL continued to air Fox Kids programming until September of that year, when it moved to WHOT (channel 34, now Univision O&amp;O WUVG). In 2004, the station rebranded from &quot;WB 36&quot; to &quot;WATL, Atlanta&#x27;s WB&quot;.

On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation and Warner Bros. Entertainment (the Time Warner division that operated The WB) announced plans to dissolve The WB and UPN, combining them to launch The CW Television Network in September 2006. As part of this joint venture, it was announced that CBS-owned WUPA would become The CW&#x27;s Atlanta affiliate. It would not have been an upset had WATL been chosen instead, however; CW representatives were on record as preferring to affiliate with The WB and UPN&#x27;s &quot;strongest&quot; stations in terms of overall viewership, and Atlanta was one of the few markets where the WB and UPN stations were both relatively strong. On May 15, 2006, Tribune announced that the three WB affiliates it owned that would not become CW affiliates—WATL, WPHL-TV in Philadelphia and KTWB-TV in Seattle]—would be joining MyNetworkTV, which was formed in February by Fox Television Stations and its syndication division, 20th Television. As a result, WATL is one of a handful of stations to have been affiliated with both Fox and MyNetworkTV.

===Acquisition by Gannett===
On June 5, 2006, Tribune announced that it entered into an agreement to sell WATL to the Gannett Company, the owners of Atlanta&#x27;s NBC affiliate WXIA-TV, for $180 million. The sale was completed on August 7, 2006, giving Gannett the first television duopoly in Atlanta. WATL aired Atlanta Falcons preseason games in August 2008 while its sister station was committed to the 2008 Summer Olympics.

WATL introduced its new on-air branding, MyAtlTV on August 20, 2006, ahead of the September 5 debut of MyNetworkTV (and about a month before The WB&#x27;s final night of programming). Prior to the acquisition by Gannett, WATL&#x27;s studios were located at One Monroe Place. When the station was acquired, WXIA management decided to move WXIA&#x27;s operations to the Monroe Place studios (an atypical instance where the senior partner in a duopoly relocates to the studios of the junior partner). During construction, WATL&#x27;s studios were located with WXIA at 1611 West Peachtree Street, behind competitor WSB. In the 2013–2014 television season, WATL changed its on-air name to &quot;The ATL&quot;.

Around the first week of October 2012, Gannett entered a dispute against Dish Network regarding compensation fees and Dish&#x27;s AutoHop commercial-skip feature on its Hopper digital video recorders. Gannett ordered that Dish discontinue AutoHop on the account that it is affecting advertising revenues for WXIA and WATL. Gannett threatened to pull both stations should the skirmish continue beyond October 7 and Dish and Gannett fail to reach an agreement. The two parties eventually reached an agreement after extending the deadline for a few hours.

On June 29, 2015, the Gannett Company split in two, with one side specializing in print media and the other side specializing in broadcast and digital media. At that time, both WATL and WXIA became part of the latter company named Tegna Inc.

==Programming==
The station airs Fox&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Marketplace&quot; paid programming block on Saturdays from 7 to 9 a.m., in lieu of WAGA. WATL also broadcasts the Sony Pictures Television game shows &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, a rarity for a MyNetworkTV affiliate, in the event that those programs are preempted on WXIA-TV.

In 2014, WATL reached a deal with Sinclair Broadcast Group to serve as the local outlet for its in-house syndicated programming, including &quot;Ring of Honor&quot; wrestling and the American Sports Network.

===Newscasts===

In September 2006, following its acquisition by Gannett, WXIA-TV began producing a prime time newscast at 10 p.m. for WATL, &quot;My 11 Alive News at 10&quot; (now called &quot;11 Alive News: Primetime at 10 on The ATL&quot;); it competes against the 10:00 p.m. newscast broadcast by WAGA. On December 2, 2019, WATL began airing WXIA-produced newscasts through all three hours of prime time weeknights, bumping MyNetworkTV programming to overnight hours.

In April 2017, WATL added a 7:00 p.m. newscast; it was meant as a temporary measure to allow the sale of additional ad inventory for the 2017 special election; however, it was continued after the election and remains on-air.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

As with the same arrangement with sister stations KUSA and KTVD in Denver, WATL airs its main channel in upscaled 1080i rather than MyNetworkTV&#x27;s default 720p format, allowing it to present syndicated programming and accommodate the broadcast of NBC programming preempted on WXIA without requiring downscaling.

From June 2006, WATL aired The Tube on digital channel 36.2, but following that network&#x27;s shutdown in October 2007, the digital subchannel was deleted. In early December 2010, WXIA&#x27;s 11Alive Weather Information Zone was moved from channel 11.2 to WATL&#x27;s 36.2, before eventually returning it to WXIA. Atlanta-based Bounce TV aired on 36.2 from its launch on September 26, 2011, until September 25, 2017, when the network moved to WSB-TV&#x27;s digital channel 2.2. At that point, 36.2 went dark, until a new network was announced, but returned to the air , as an affiliate of This TV, which can be also seen on WANN-CD2.

In late October 2011, Universal Sports was added to digital channel 36.3, until the network ceased over the air broadcasting and moved to cable-only distribution at the end of 2011. On December 24, 2011, the channel was replaced by former owner Tribune&#x27;s Antenna TV network.

In late summer 2019, the fourth subchannel of WATL was launched as a UHF simulcast of WXIA-TV, which allows homes with issues receiving WXIA&#x27;s channel 10 VHF signal or only a UHF antenna to receive WXIA in some form. Instead of channel 36.4, WATL-DT4 maps to channel 11.11.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WATL shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 36, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 25, using virtual channel 36.

<doc id="765184" wikidata="Q6414271" url="?curid=765184" title="Kinshasa Highway">
<text>The Kinshasa Highway is an informal name for a route across the Democratic Republic of the Congo into Uganda and beyond, consisting of paved highways in some places and seasonally impassable tracks in others. The name has gained currency for the role which long-distance truck drivers played in the early spread of AIDS in the 1980s (also described in the book &quot;The Hot Zone&quot; in Part 4). Although there is a paved road from Kinshasa to Kikwit and a little beyond, and there are paved roads between Kisangani, Bukavu, Kampala and Nairobi, there has never been a paved highway across the centre of the Congo joining Kinshasa and Kikwit to Bukavu. Neither is there any coordinating authority for a &#x27;Kinshasa Highway&#x27; or &#x27;Autoroute de Kinshasa&#x27;.

==Highways in DR Congo==
One of the most reliable indicators of highway condition in Africa are the Michelin maps which grade highway condition, in part from traveller&#x27;s reports. The 2000 edition for &#x27;Africa Central and South&#x27; indicates three &#x27;transcontinental routes&#x27; between Kinshasa and Kisangani or Bukavu, all of them with very long stretches of road in the lowest category of highway condition, described as &#x27;earth tracks likely to become impassable in bad weather&#x27;. The area has some of the highest rainfall in Africa. The editions published in the 1980s and 1990s indicate the same, an absence of paved roads through 750 km of rainforest from central to eastern DR Congo.

One reason for the absence of highways through the rain forests and swamps of the central Congo, in addition to the difficulty of building and maintaining them, is that river transport has traditionally been used to a much greater extent than road transport in the country.

===Spread of HIV-1 ===
It was said that the route of the Kinshasa Highway had to be carved out from thick jungle, and that after it was paved, AIDS spread quicker, as carriers of the disease travelled along its length on board cars and trucks, from populated areas to more isolated rural areas. Prostitutes at truck stops helped spread the disease even faster, and it was also referred to as the &#x27;AIDS Highway&#x27;. This description may apply to a few highways which have been paved in the eastern Congo, such as the Kisangani-Bukavu road. It applies to an extent to the road across Uganda and into Kenya but this road was constructed and paved several decades before the emergence of AIDS.

It has been established from analysing archived samples of HIV, that HIV-1 originated in the Kinshasa of the 1920s and spread through the railroad into Brazzaville and the mining province, Katanga long before AIDS was recognized in the early 80s.

<doc id="765190" wikidata="Q1691308" url="?curid=765190" title="Jody Powell">
<text>Joseph Lester &quot;Jody&quot; Powell, Jr. (September 30, 1943 – September 14, 2009) was an American political advisor who served as a White House press secretary during the presidency of Jimmy Carter. Powell later co-founded a public relations firm.

==Early life and education==
Born in Cordele, Georgia, Powell grew up on a farm in Vienna, 35 miles east of Carter&#x27;s home town of Plains. He attended the United States Air Force Academy beginning in 1961, but was expelled three years later for cheating on a history exam. After finishing his Bachelor of Arts at Georgia State University in 1966, Powell enrolled in the doctoral program in political science at Emory University. He earned a Master of Arts in the discipline before leaving the program.

== Career ==
While at Emory in 1968, he sent a paper he had written on southern populism to Jimmy Carter. He began working for the future president, who at the time, was running for governor of Georgia. Powell&#x27;s first job for Carter was as a volunteer driver, with Powell taking Carter to various campaign stops throughout Georgia. Powell eventually became Carter&#x27;s close friend and functionally served as his press secretary. Powell eventually quit Emory prior to completing his doctorate to work full-time for Carter.

===Carter administration===
During Carter&#x27;s presidential campaign in 1976, Powell was noted for his energy and for calling reporters from wayside pay telephones to make sure they got Carter&#x27;s record straight. In the run-up to the 1976 presidential election, &quot;Time Magazine&quot; profiled Powell, anticipating that if Carter were elected, Powell would serve a &quot;dual role as adviser and spokesman&quot; and would become one of the most powerful White House press secretaries in history due to his close relationship with Carter.

After Carter&#x27;s 1976 election as president, Powell was described as a member of the &quot;Georgia Mafia&quot;, a group of close aides from Georgia who moved to high positions in the Carter administration, but who were inexperienced in national politics. Powell and Carter&#x27;s chief of staff Hamilton Jordan appeared in 1977 as caricatures on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; in 1977 and were pictured on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, where they were dubbed Carter&#x27;s &quot;whiz kids&quot;. Powell served as White House press secretary for Carter&#x27;s entire term as president.

===Later career===
In 1985, he published a memoir, &quot;The Other Side of the Story&quot;, in which he discussed his leak to the Associated Press of the Jimmy Carter rabbit incident, Carter&#x27;s 1979 encounter with a swamp rabbit, that &quot;was intent on climbing into the Presidential boat&quot;.

In 1990, he participated in Ken Burns&#x27; PBS documentary miniseries &quot;The Civil War&quot;, lending his distinctive voice to Confederate figures of the American Civil War, notably Generals Stonewall Jackson, John B. Gordon, and Nathan Bedford Forrest.

Powell and Sheila Tate, former White House press secretary to Nancy Reagan, co-founded Powell Tate, a public relations firm based in Washington, D.C., in 1991. Powell worked as CEO of the firm until his death in 2009. Powell was a member of the Board of Advisors for the Special Operations Warrior Foundation.

== Death ==
Powell died on September 14, 2009, from a heart attack at his home on the Eastern Shore in Maryland.

<text>WUPA (channel 69), branded Atlanta 69, is an independent television station in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. The station is owned by the CBS News and Stations group and maintains studios on Northeast Expressway (I-85) in unincorporated DeKalb County; its transmitter is located near Shepherds Lane and Arnold Avenue in the Woodland Hills section of northeastern Atlanta (near North Druid Hills).

Channel 69 in Atlanta first began broadcasting in 1981 as WVEU. Years of technical issues provoked by interference to mobile radio users and consequent limitations on the station&#x27;s operating hours and signal strength contributed to the failure of subscription television (STV) and a music video service that operated the station. WVEU&#x27;s local founders sold the station to CBS in 1994 at a time when CBS needed to find a new affiliate in Atlanta, but the network was able to negotiate to affiliate with another, more built-up station instead. WVEU became an affiliate of UPN and was then sold to the Paramount Stations Group. Under the new WUPA call sign, Paramount substantially improved the station&#x27;s programming and ratings in the years that followed before UPN was replaced with The CW in 2006. After successive owner Paramount Global sold the majority of its stake in The CW to Nexstar Media Group in 2022, WUPA disaffiliated from the network on September 1, 2023, reverting to independent status.

==History==
===Construction, land mobile dispute, and STV years (1981–1984)===

In 1978, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) received two applications for new television stations to use channel 69 in Atlanta; on August 19, 1980, the final decision was given to award it to a consortium of Atlanta-based investors known as Broadcast Corporation of Georgia (BCG), which proposed a hybrid operation consisting of conventional ad-supported programming in the daytime and a subscription television (STV) service in evening hours. BCG&#x27;s majority owner, Atlanta attorney David Harris, was approached by backers of a California STV company whom he thought were merely seeking advice on how to build the station. The antenna atop the Peachtree Plaza Hotel from which channel 69 would radiate had been hoisted into place in mid-August, days before the license decision was publicized. The subscription programming would be supplied under the Superstar TV name by Subscription Television of Greater Atlanta, a consortium originally reported to be co-owned by Clint Murchison—who had subscription television holdings in other cities, including the Super TV service in the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore markets—and Atlanta electronics manufacturer Dynacom, which would produce the decoders subscribers would need to view Superstar programming. In actuality, the owner was not Clint Murchison but Clyde A. Murchison, whom a 1982 article in &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; described as Clint&#x27;s great-nephew.

WVEU began broadcasting on August 22, 1981. However, a planned full launch on October 1 had to be scuttled because the station&#x27;s broadcasts on channel 69—at the top of the TV band, 800 to 806 MHz—were interfering with two-way land mobile radio transmissions. Further, the station had planned to fill daytime hours with programming from a business news service known as The Market Report, which ran into financial difficulties and was unable to start on time. Superstar TV was able to begin operating before the end of the year, with an official kickoff held on January 8, 1982. The FCC continued to curtail WVEU&#x27;s operating hours; WVEU was only allowed to sign on after 7 p.m. on weekdays and after 3 p.m. on Saturdays, though it was allowed to operate all day on Sundays. It only offered commercial, non-STV programming on Sundays from 7 a.m. to 3 pm, running Superstar TV at all other times it was on the air.

The two-way radio dispute continued to loom large over every facet of WVEU&#x27;s operations for several years, as the station subsisted on production contracts. In June 1983, the FCC ruled that the station could begin operating at 50 percent power before 7 p.m. if it paid an estimated $250,000 to relocate all of the land mobile users affected by interference. However, these users protested the decision and filed for reconsideration with the commission. In February 1984, the FCC ordered the station to engage the users or pay them to relocate on penalty of losing the provisional program test authority under which WVEU had operated since 1981. While the dispute was resolved by July 1984, when the FCC granted a full license to BCG, the issue had doomed Superstar TV, which filed for bankruptcy in April 1983 and made its last broadcasts on the morning of July 23 with fewer than 3,000 subscribers.

===The independent years (1984–1995)===
To replace Superstar TV, WVEU signed an operating agreement with VideoMusic Channel, which had broadcast music videos on Atlanta-area cable systems, to program nearly all of channel 69&#x27;s airtime. The station brought the programming in-house in August 1984 before eventually canceling it altogether and replacing it with syndicated shows and reruns because, it learned, music videos were not very &quot;salable&quot; to advertisers. That same year, negotiations were held and an initial agreement reached to sell the station to the RBP Corporation of Massachusetts, but no transaction was consummated.

The station also made its first entry into the television sports market, airing what was to be a package of 30 Atlanta Hawks NBA games in the 1984–85 season, with John Sterling as the play-by-play announcer. This package was whittled down to 19 games because of insufficient advertiser interest. A new 20-game package was carried in the following season, this time with the Hawks selling the advertising time; the Hawks later added a game at The Omni that sold out, their first home telecast in two years.
Through the mid-1990s, WVEU became Atlanta&#x27;s television station of last resort while a stabilizing WATL (channel 36) and a growing WGNX (channel 46) became the city&#x27;s primary local independents. In a 1991 article by Prentis Rogers in &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot;, it was described as the city&#x27;s &quot;quicker picker-upper&quot;, constantly airing shows that the local network affiliates passed on. These included CBS&#x27;s morning news program (under the titles of the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot;, &quot;The Morning Program&quot;, and &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;) from 1986 through 1994 and its late night programming, as well as numerous preempted network sports telecasts that the local affiliates could not air due to scheduling conflicts. Beyond displaced network programs, WVEU featured an eclectic mix, a function of being what &quot;Business Atlanta&quot; writer Russell Shaw called the &quot;poor cousin&quot; of Atlanta independent television. There were telecasts of martial arts movies under the banner &quot;Black Belt Theater&quot; and later hosted by Morgus the Magnificent, a character first introduced decades prior in Detroit and New Orleans; professional wrestling; a weekday public access show, &quot;Community&quot;; &quot;The Auto Doctor&quot;, a locally produced weekly magazine show about cars; and jazz music video show &quot;Jazz Beat&quot;. After another proposed sale, this one to the Home Shopping Network in 1989, fell through, the station added Japanese-language programming under the title &quot;600 Station&quot; to its morning lineup.

===Almost a CBS affiliate===

On May 23, 1994, as a result of the network winning the rights to air NFC football games, New World Communications announced an affiliation deal with Fox to switch the affiliations of most of New World&#x27;s stations to the network. One of the stations involved was WAGA-TV (channel 5), which would replace Fox-owned WATL as that network&#x27;s Atlanta outlet. This left CBS in the position of seeking a new Atlanta-area affiliate.

In July, BCG approached CBS and proposed to sell WVEU to the network. Two months later, CBS had still not lined up a new affiliate in Atlanta, even though WAGA was due to join Fox at year&#x27;s end. Unable to find a higher-profile station, CBS agreed to buy WVEU for $22 million and relaunch it as a CBS owned-and-operated station. Bill Carter of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called CBS&#x27;s purchases of WVEU and WGPR-TV in Detroit &quot;little more than acquisitions of broadcasting licenses&quot; because the stations lacked the facilities and staff typical of network affiliates. For this reason, a CBS move to WVEU would have meant an unprecedented campaign to build up the station, including major expenses in promotion and starting a local news department. One consultant interviewed by &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; estimated that CBS would have to spend as much as $100 million over several years to build out WVEU. Those expenses potentially included replacing channel 69&#x27;s facilities off I-85, which were of inadequate size for a full-service, news-producing station. In return, while CBS was guaranteed to have an affiliate, it faced the prospect of steep ratings declines for the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; and had a much weaker signal than the outgoing WAGA. For the outgoing Broadcast Corporation of Georgia, and particularly for majority owner David Harris, the sale to CBS was an unexpected windfall. WVEU had never turned a profit in its 13-year history; in 1993, it became cash flow–positive for the first time in its history.

As 1994 continued, CBS took only minimal steps to close on the purchase and continued to campaign for a better partner. The network continued to negotiate with Fox and with Tribune Broadcasting, then-owner of WGNX. By mid-November, CBS had not filed paperwork for the deal at the FCC, even though WAGA was scheduled to join Fox within a month. CBS executives refused to confirm that they were still moving forward with the deal. On November 16, it was announced that CBS would not be moving to WVEU but instead to WGNX. CBS had preferred to move to a station that already aired local news, even if it was only an affiliate; WGNX was the only independent station in the market that already had a functioning news department. CBS committed to buy WVEU and immediately resell it.

===UPN affiliation (1995–2006)===
Even though channel 69 was not to be the CBS affiliate in Atlanta, WVEU emerged from the sale to CBS having secured a valuable network affiliation. WATL aligned with the upstart WB network for January 1995, and the new United Paramount Network (UPN) still had not signed up an Atlanta affiliate. With no other realistic options available, UPN signed an agreement with WVEU in December, a month before its launch. Behind UPN came a buyer: the Paramount Stations Group, which began to negotiate with CBS to acquire WVEU. Paid programming was reduced from 40 hours a week to 13, and stronger syndicated and UPN shows lifted channel 69&#x27;s ratings.

In May 1995, CBS agreed to sell WVEU to Viacom, the parent company of the Paramount Stations Group, for $27 million; to stay under the 12-station ownership limit of the time, the company sold one of its non-UPN stations, KSLA in Shreveport, Louisiana. After closing on the purchase, Viacom began a significant makeover of the station. This included a new call sign, WUPA (for United Paramount/Atlanta), which it assumed on December 11, as well as a more aggressive stance to purchasing syndicated programming. Household ratings tripled, and the network recognized WUPA as its first affiliate of the year.

In the late 1990s, WUPA began to add local sports programming. When TBS converted from a superstation to a basic cable channel, it was forced to reduce the number of Atlanta Braves baseball games it telecast. WUPA picked up an 11-game package of Braves games sold by TBS for the 1998 season, which became a 30-game package for 1999 before being reclaimed for the new Turner South regional cable channel in 2000. When Atlanta got a hockey team, the new Atlanta Thrashers aired 15 games a year on WUPA. The Hawks returned to channel 69 in 2001 after 15 years when their existing carrier, WHOT-TV (channel 34), was sold to be changed to Spanish-language programming.

Over the course of the early 2000s, WUPA sought to bolster its local identity. It changed its branding from &quot;UPN 69&quot; to &quot;UPN Atlanta&quot; in 2003 and began producing non-news specials; it also sponsored the Music Midtown festival.

===The CW (2006–2023)===

On January 24, 2006, the Warner Bros. unit of Time Warner and CBS Corporation (which had been created as a result of the split of Viacom at the start of the year) announced that the two companies would shut down The WB and UPN and combine the networks&#x27; respective programming to create a new &quot;fifth&quot; network called The CW; the day of the announcement, it was revealed that 11 of CBS Corporation&#x27;s 15 UPN affiliates, including WUPA, would become CW stations.

===Return to independence (2023)===
On October 3, 2022, Nexstar Media Group acquired majority ownership of The CW. Under the agreement, CBS was given the right to pull its affiliations from WUPA and its seven other CW stations. On May 5, 2023, CBS announced it would exercise that right and WUPA would cease airing the network&#x27;s programming at the end of August, returning to independent status. The CW affiliation was moved to Gray Television-owned WPCH-TV as part of a larger contract extension between Gray and the network. The station was rebranded as &quot;Atlanta 69&quot; as part of a larger naming convention among the disaffiliated stations highlighting the city and channel number.

==Local programming==

===Newscasts===
On April 5, 2004, NBC affiliate WXIA-TV began producing a half-hour prime time newscast at 10 p.m. for WUPA titled &quot;UPN Atlanta News at Ten&quot;. This program, for which WXIA-TV sold the advertising, was accompanied by a separately produced, live half-hour talk program at 10:30 p.m. titled &quot;Atlanta Tonight&quot;. Up against stiff competition from the incumbent 10 p.m. newscast on WAGA, both programs seen on channel 69 suffered, and the 10 p.m. newscast and &quot;Atlanta Tonight&quot; were canceled on August 28, 2005, for &quot;economic reasons&quot;.

On January 17, 2020, CBS Television Stations announced that it would be introducing a nightly 10 p.m. newscast for WUPA, produced by New York City sister station WCBS-TV; the program debuted February 17. In March 2020, following the temporary shutdown of the CBS Broadcast Center during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, and for the next five months, WUPA began simulcasting &quot;WBZ News at 10&quot; from sister station WSBK-TV in Boston, with local coverage limited to a news ticker and prerecorded weather forecasts.

On August 11, 2020, the Atlanta-oriented newscast was relaunched, with production shifted to KTVT in Fort Worth, Texas. On July 18, 2022, this newscast was relaunched as &quot;Atlanta Now News&quot; under a new hybrid local/national format which continues to be produced from Fort Worth.

In addition to the newscast, WUPA produces a weekly public affairs program called &quot;Focus Atlanta&quot;.

===Sports===
In 2014, WUPA became the official television station of the Atlanta Falcons, gaining rights to its preseason games and introducing weekly programs dedicated to the team. The preseason broadcasts were initially produced by CBS Sports but have been produced by Tupelo Raycom since 2017. The Falcons partnered with WAGA-TV in 2020.

In 2017, as part of a broadcasting deal with the city&#x27;s new Major League Soccer franchise Atlanta United FC and Fox Sports Networks, WUPA began to air the team&#x27;s overflow games. WUPA was replaced in this role by WPCH-TV for the 2022 season.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:


===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WUPA shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 69, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television; its digital broadcasts remained on UHF channel 43, using virtual channel 69.

The station was repacked from channel 43 to 36 in 2019.

<doc id="765198" wikidata="Q7378089" url="?curid=765198" title="Rufus Putnam">
<text>Rufus Putnam (April 9, 1738 – May 4, 1824) was an American military officer who fought during the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War. As an organizer of the Ohio Company of Associates, he was instrumental in the initial colonization by the United States of former Native American, English, and French lands in the Northwest Territory in present-day Ohio following the war. 

Ultimately attaining the rank of brigadier general during the Ohio campaign of 1792–1793, he became known as &quot;Father of the Northwest Territory&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Putnam was born in Sutton, Massachusetts. Rufus&#x27;s father Elisha died when Rufus was 6 or 7, and Rufus temporarily lived with his paternal grandfather in Rhode Island. Elisha Putnam and Israel Putnam, who became a renowned general during the Revolutionary War were cousins. Ann Putnam, accuser of the Salem witch trials, was a first cousin once removed. After Rufus Putnam&#x27;s mother married John Sadler, Rufus lived with his mother and stepfather in Sutton, where the family ran an inn.

Putnam served in various Provincial Massachusetts regiments from 1757 to 1760, during the French and Indian War. During the war, Putnam saw action in the Great Lakes region, and near Lake Champlain.

==Migration and work==
After the war, Putnam relocated to New Braintree, Massachusetts. There, he worked as a millwright from 1761 to 1768. 

==Farmer and surveyor==
While Putnam worked as a millwright, he devoted his free time to self-education, studying geography, mathematics, and surveying.

In 1769, Putnam became a farmer and surveyor. Rufus Putnam, along with his cousin Israel Putnam and two others, traveled in 1773 to survey near present-day Pensacola, Florida. There, Putnam surveyed and chartered lands along the Mississippi River, which the Crown was going to grant to veterans of the French and Indian War in lieu of payment for their service.

== Revolutionary War ==
After the Battle of Lexington and Concord, Putnam enlisted the same day, on April 19, 1775, in one of Massachusett&#x27;s first revolutionary regiments. Putnam later was commissioned in the Continental Army as a lieutenant colonel, under the command of David Brewer. Brewer&#x27;s regiment first engaged with the British Army in Roxbury, Massachusetts. After the Battle of Lexington and Concord and the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Americans laid siege against the British in Boston. The long siege lasted for many months with neither side able to make any progress. At the urging of William Heath, Putnam used his experience working with British military engineers during the French and Indian war to build fortifications in Roxbury and other locations that were critical to the siege. After his initial success, he borrowed from Heath the book &quot;Attack and Defense of Fortified Places&quot;, by John Müller that showed him additional techniques for building defensive fortifications. Using Muller&#x27;s ideas, Putnam devised a system for fortifying Dorchester Heights, overlooking Boston Harbor. Despite the frozen ground in early March, 1776, Putnam&#x27;s plan of using timbers and fascines allowed the colonial troops to put up the defenses overnight allowing for the subsequent emplacement of artillery, brought from Fort Ticonderoga by Henry Knox weeks earlier, the next day. Putnam&#x27;s success in establishing a fort in a matter of just hours took the British by surprise and left them in an untenable position, resulting in their evacuation of Boston by sea in the following weeks.

General Washington appointed Putnam to be the Chief of Engineers of the Works of New York. He was soon promoted to engineer with the rank of colonel where he directed the building of fortifications which secured victories at Sewall&#x27;s Point, Providence, Newport, Long Island, and West Point. In December, 1776, when the Continental Congress rejected his proposition to establish a national corps of engineers, Putnam resigned his commission. His resignation was short-lived and he eventually joined the Continental Army and served under Major General Horatio Gates. Putnam commanded two regiments in the battle of Saratoga. He continued to work on critical fortifications, including Fort Putnam at West Point in 1778. In 1779 Putnam served under Major General Anthony Wayne in the Corps of Light Infantry following the capture of Stony Point, commanding the 4th Regiment. Putnam&#x27;s remaining military career was less eventful. In January 1783 he was commissioned as brigadier general.

== Post-war activities ==
After the war was over, Putnam returned to Rutland, Massachusetts. In 1780 he had bought a farm confiscated from a Loyalist, and he settled there. He returned to working as a surveyor, inspecting lands in Maine (then part of Massachusetts). Putnam was a strong advocate of granting lands to veterans of the Revolution. He was one of the authors of the army&#x27;s Newburgh Petition, which was submitted to Congress requesting land disbursements. There was pent-up land hunger among younger men in New England, where topography and long settlement restricted buying land.

Putnam was an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati, and one of the principal benefactors of the Leicester Academy in Leicester, Massachusetts, and served on its board of trustees.
=== The Ohio Company ===
Putnam&#x27;s advocacy for land grants led him, with partners, to establish the Ohio Company of Associates for the purchase and settlement of Western lands. He established the Company in Boston on March 3, 1786, together with Benjamin Tupper, Samuel Holden Parsons, and Manasseh Cutler. Its primary purpose was to settle the Northwest Territory, roughly the lands between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River, which was ceded to the US by Great Britain under the Treaty of Paris (1783).

After passage of the Northwest Ordinance to organize the territory, the Company bought about of land north of the Ohio River, between the present day sites of Marietta, Ohio, and Huntington, West Virginia. Cutler had tried to purchase all the land between the Ohio and Scioto rivers, but the western half was optioned by the Scioto Company. It later failed without having purchased any of the land.

Putnam’s 1788 mapping of the Marietta Earthworks was described as “the genesis of the science of archaeology in the United States” by archaeologist Henry Clyde Shetrone and is one of the first detailed European descriptions of North American earthworks.

=== Later life ===
In 1788 Putnam led a group of Revolutionary veterans to settle the land in what became Ohio. These pioneers arrived at the confluence of the Ohio and Muskingum rivers on April 7, 1788, where they established Marietta, Ohio, as the first European-American permanent United States settlement in the Northwest Territory. Putnam was appointed to serve as one of three judges of the Northwest Territory after Samuel Holden Parsons died.
The territory had been historically occupied by Native American tribes, and more were driven west by colonial encroachment before the Revolution. As they had not ceded any land, they came into conflict with the arriving pioneers. They organized a coalition of tribes to try to expel the Americans from their territory.

From 1792 to 1793, Putnam served as a brigadier general in Anthony Wayne&#x27;s Ohio campaign against these Native American tribes, including Shawnee, Lenape and Seneca, who were ultimately defeated. In 1796, Putnam was appointed by the President as the first Surveyor General of the United States, a position he held until 1803. As Ohio residents organized to write a constitution and be admitted as a state, in 1802 Putnam was elected a Washington county delegate to the Ohio Constitutional Convention.

He was appointed as a Trustee of Ohio University, where he served for two decades, from 1804 to 1824. It was constructed on public lands, under the terms of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. Long participating in the Masons, a fraternal organization that expanded in the early nineteenth century, in 1808 Putnam was elected the first Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Free &amp; Accepted Masons of Ohio. 
==Marriage and family==
Established at work, in April 1761 Putnam married Elizabeth Ayers, the daughter of William Ayers, esquire of the Second Precinct of Brookfield (now North Brookfield), Massachusetts. Elizabeth died in 1762, possibly in childbirth.

On January 10, 1765, Putnam married again, to Persis Rice (1737–1820), the daughter of Zebulon Rice and Abigail Forbush Rice of Westborough, Massachusetts.

==Death==
Putnam died on May 4, 1824. He was buried at Mound Cemetery in Marietta, Ohio.

==Legacy and honors==

Rufus Putnam is depicted on a commemorative stamp issued on July 13, 1937, by the U.S. Post Office which commemorated the 150th anniversary of the North West Ordinance of 1787. The engraving on the stamp depicts a map of the United States at the time with the North West Territory between the figures of Putnam (right) and Manasseh Cutler.

Putnam&#x27;s home in Marietta has been designated a National Historic Landmark in his honor. His home in Rutland, Massachusetts (the General Rufus Putnam House) is on the National Register of Historic Homes and is currently being operated as a B&amp;B. The town of Putnam, Ohio (now a part of Zanesville, Ohio) was named for him. Fort Putnam (built by Rufus Putnam) is part of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. One of his grandsons, Catharinus Putnam Buckingham, served as a brigadier general in the Union Army during the American Civil War.

<text>George Palmer Putnam (September 7, 1887 – January 4, 1950) was an American publisher, writer and explorer. Known for his marriage to (and being the widower of) Amelia Earhart, he had also achieved fame as one of the most successful promoters in the United States during the 1930s.
==Early life==
George Palmer Putnam was born in Rye, New York on September 7, 1887, the son of John Bishop Putnam and the grandson of his namesake, George Palmer Putnam, founder of the prominent publishing firm that became G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons. He studied at Harvard University and the University of California, Berkeley.

In 1911, Putnam married Dorothy Binney (1888–1982), the daughter of Edwin Binney, inventor and co-owner, with cousin C. Harold Smith, of Binney &amp; Smith Inc., the company that made Crayola crayons. They had two sons, David Binney Putnam (1913–1992) and George Palmer Putnam Jr. (1921–2013), and for a time lived in Bend, Oregon, where Putnam was the publisher and editor of the local newspaper, the &quot;Bend Bulletin&quot;. He was mayor of Bend from 1912 to 1913. Putnam left Bend in 1915 to become the private secretary to Oregon Governor James Withycombe.

Within a few years, George and Dorothy moved to the East Coast, where Putnam entered the family publishing business in New York City.

During World War I, Putnam served with the United States Army field artillery. In 1926, under the sponsorship of the American Museum of Natural History, he led an expedition to the Arctic, up the west coast of Greenland. The following year he headed another expedition for the American Geographical Society to collect wildlife specimens on Baffin Island.

==1920s and 1930s business interests==
In July 1927 Putnam was responsible for the blockbuster publication of &quot;We&quot;, Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s autobiographical account of his early life and his Orteig Prize winning non-stop transatlantic solo flight from New York to Paris in May of that year. The book was one of the most successful non-fiction titles of all time, selling more than 650,000 copies in less than a year and earning its author over $250,000 ().

In 1927, Putnam&#x27;s wife, Dorothy Binney, traveled to South America and began a long, well-chronicled affair with George Weymouth, a man 19 years her junior; Putnam would leave Binney two years later. Many thought that George had left his first wife for Amelia Earhart, although for Binney, it was her own ticket out of an unhappy marriage.

In 1930, the various Putnam heirs voted to merge the family&#x27;s publishing firm with Minton, Balch &amp; Co., which became the majority stockholders. George P. Putnam resigned from his position as secretary of G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons and joined New York publishers Brewer &amp; Warren as vice president.

A significant event in Putnam&#x27;s personal and business life occurred in 1928, before the merger. Because of his reputation for working with Lindbergh, he was contacted by Amy Phipps Guest, a wealthy American living in London, who wanted to sponsor the first-ever flight by a woman across the Atlantic Ocean.

Guest asked Putnam to find a suitable candidate, and he eventually came up with the then-unknown aviatrix, Amelia Earhart. As it turned out, they shared many common interests: hiking, swimming, camping, riding, tennis and golf. When Putnam first met Earhart he was still married to Binney. After she completed her flight across the Atlantic, Putnam offered to help Earhart write a book about it, following the formula he had established with Lindbergh in the writing of &quot;WE&quot;. The resulting Earhart book was &quot;20 Hrs. 40 Min.&quot; (1928).

When they began writing, Putnam invited Earhart to live in his home, because he felt it would make the process easier. Shortly after, Binney left for South America. George and Dorothy divorced in 1929. Putnam had undertaken to promote Earhart in a campaign that included lecture tours and mass-market endorsements for luggage, Lucky Strike cigarettes (this caused image problems for her, and &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; magazine retracted an offer) and other products.
Putnam and Earhart made their relationship official shortly after his divorce was finalized, but they didn&#x27;t marry until 1931. Earhart&#x27;s ideas on marriage were liberal for the time, as she believed in equal responsibilities for both &quot;breadwinners&quot; and pointedly kept her own surname. GP, as she called him, soon learned that he would be called &quot;Mr. Earhart&quot;.

There was no honeymoon for the newlyweds because Earhart was involved in a nine-day cross-country tour promoting autogyros and the tour sponsor, Beech-Nut chewing gum. Although the couple had no children, he had two sons by his first marriage, explorer and writer David Binney Putnam (1913–1992) and businessman George Palmer Putnam Jr. (1921–2013). Earhart was especially fond of David who frequently visited his father at their family home in Rye, New York. George had contracted polio shortly after his parents&#x27; separation and was unable to visit as often.

Following Earhart&#x27;s successful 1932 solo transatlantic flight, Putnam again organized her public engagements and speaking tour across the United States. Earhart joined the faculty of Purdue University College of Technology in 1935 as a visiting faculty member to counsel women on careers and as a technical advisor to the Department of Aeronautics.

Earhart disappeared in 1937 while on her second attempt to complete a circumnavigational flight of the globe. In addition to her first work, Putnam published two other books Earhart wrote about flying, &quot;The Fun of It&quot; (1932), a memoir of her flying experiences and an essay on women in aviation and &quot;Last Flight&quot; (1937), consisting of letters and memorandum compiled by Putnam after her disappearance. Putnam also published her biography in 1939 under the title &quot;Soaring Wings: A Biography of Amelia Earhart&quot;. Although a major blaze at the Putnam residence in Rye destroyed many family treasures and Earhart&#x27;s personal mementos, Putnam later donated some of Earhart&#x27;s belongings, including photographs, private letters and a flight jacket, to Purdue University, where she had worked as a career counselor. Other personal effects were sent to the Women&#x27;s Archives in New York.

Putnam had Earhart declared dead on January 5, 1939, and remarried on May 21 of that year to Jean-Marie Cosigny James.

==Later years==
In 1938, Putnam set up a new publishing company in California, George Palmer Putnam Inc. With America&#x27;s entry into World War II in 1941, Putnam resumed active service, joining an intelligence unit as a captain and rising to the rank of major by 1942. In 1945, he and &quot;Jeannie&quot; divorced; she had initiated the action, citing incompatibility. Shortly after, he remarried again, to Margaret Havilland. They operated the Stove Pipe Wells resort in Death Valley, California.

In the book &quot;Death Valley Handbook&quot; (1947), Putnam was the binomial author of the plant taxon &quot;Gilia mohavensis&quot; . The name has since slipped into synonymy with &quot;Linanthus mohavensis&quot; , its basionym (or original species name).

George Putnam authored a number of books, including:
* &quot;Death Valley and Its Country&quot; (1946)
* &quot;Death Valley Handbook&quot; (1947)
* &quot;Hickory Shirt&quot; (1948)
* &quot;Hot Oil&quot; (1935)
* &quot;In the Oregon Country: Out-doors in Oregon, Washington, and California, Together with some Legendary Lore, and Glimpses of the Modern West in the Making&quot; (1915)
* &quot;Smiting the Rock: A tale of Oregon&quot; (1918) 
* &quot;Soaring Wings: A Biography of Amelia Earhart&quot; (1939)
* &quot;Wide Margins&quot; (1942 autobiography)
* &quot;Up In Our Country&quot; (1950)

==Death==
In late 1949, Putnam fell ill at his home in the Stove Pipe Wells, California resort in Death Valley, suffering from kidney failure. He died in Trona, California on January 4, 1950, aged 62. His body was cremated and the ashes interred in the Chapel of the Pines Crematory in Los Angeles.

==Honors==
Amelia Earhart, Putnam&#x27;s second wife, was the first president of The Ninety-Nines, an organization of (originally) 99 female pilots formed in 1929 for the support and advancement of aviation. Putnam had proposed an award as a means of honoring anyone who supports an individual member of the group (known as a &quot;49½&quot;), a Chapter or Section, or the organization as a whole. The &quot;George Palmer Putnam 49½ Award&quot; was originated to recognize such exceptional support of The Ninety-Nines.

In 1927, the Boy Scouts of America made Putnam an &quot;Honorary Scout&quot;, a new category of Scout created that same year. This distinction was given to &quot;American citizens whose achievements in outdoor activity, exploration and worthwhile adventure are of such an exceptional character as to capture the imagination of boys...&quot;. 

Due to his relationship with Amelia Earhart, Putnam has been the subject of numerous feature and documentary films including: &quot;Amelia Earhart&quot; (1976) with John Forsythe portraying Putnam. In &quot;Amelia Earhart: The Final Flight&quot; (1994), Bruce Dern played him. The documentary &quot;Amelia Earhart: The Price of Courage&quot; (1993) from &quot;American Experience&quot; also featured the Putnam-Earhart marriage. Richard Gere portrayed Putnam in the 2009 movie, &quot;Amelia&quot;.

==Popular culture==

In &quot;Flying Blind&quot;, a &quot;Nathan Heller&quot; novel by Max Allan Collins, George Putnam is a major character, but is portrayed as a villain using Earhart for his own purposes.

In the 2009 film &quot;Amelia&quot;, Putnam is portrayed by the actor Richard Gere.

<text>George Palmer Putnam (February 7, 1814 – December 20, 1872) was an American publisher and author. He founded the firm G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons and &quot;Putnam&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. He was an advocate of international copyright reform, secretary for many years of the Publishers&#x27; Association, and founding superintendent of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

==Early life==

Putnam was born in Brunswick, Maine, on February 7, 1814. 

==Career==
Putnam moved to New York City, where he was given his first job by Jonathan Leavitt, who subsequently published Putnam&#x27;s first book. In 1838, Putnam and John Wiley established the publishing house Wiley &amp; Putnam in New York City. In 1841, Putnam went to London where he set up a branch office, the first American to ever do so. In 1848, he returned to New York City, where he dissolved the partnership with John Wiley and established G. Putnam Broadway, publishing a variety of works including quality illustrated books.

In 1852, with the assistance of George William Curtis and other partners, he founded &quot;Putnam&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. It operated until 1856, resumed in 1868, and finally merged with &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Monthly&quot;. His company was the official publisher to the New York World&#x27;s Fair in 1852..

Putnam published the books of many classic American authors including his close friend Washington Irving, William Cullen Bryant, James Fenimore Cooper, and Edgar Allan Poe. He served as secretary for the Publishers&#x27; Association for many years and was an advocate of the creation of International Copyright Law. During the American Civil War, he participated in the Loyal Publication Society of New York, and suspended his business for three years (1863–1866) to become the United States government&#x27;s Collector of Internal Revenue in New York City.

An important member of the New York artistic community, Putnam was the leading publisher of art books in his time and became one of the founders of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and served as its honorary superintendent in 1872. He was also chairman of the Committee on Art at the Vienna Universal Exposition. He is believed to have been the first publisher to offer book royalties to authors, including Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Thomas Carlyle.

==Personal life==
Putnam married Victorine Haven; their marriage produced seven sons and four daughters. Their daughter, Mary Corinna Putnam (1842–1906), was a pioneering female doctor, the first woman admitted to the Faculté de Médecine de Paris. One of their sons, Herbert Putnam (1861–1955), became a noted librarian who served as the Librarian of Congress. Their youngest daughter Ruth Putnam (1856–1931) was an author.

==Death==
Putnam died in New York City, on December 20, 1872, at age 58.

==Legacy==
Following his death, his sons George and John, inherited the business and the firm&#x27;s name was changed to G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons. George Putnam published his father&#x27;s memoirs in 1912.

George Palmer Putnam&#x27;s grandson and namesake, George P. Putnam (1887–1950), was part of the family business but was also an author and explorer whose first wife was Dorothy Binney, the daughter of Edwin Binney who founded Crayola; after their divorce, he married the famous aviator Amelia Earhart. His granddaughter Brenda Putnam was a sculptor and author.

<doc id="765207" wikidata="Q2361741" url="?curid=765207" title="Pavel Tchelitchew">
<text>Pavel Fyodorovich Tchelitchew ( ; ) ( – 31 July 1957) was a Russian-born surrealist painter, set designer and costume designer.

== Early life ==
Tchelitchew was born to an aristocratic family of landowners and was educated by private tutors. Tchelitchew expressed an early interest in ballet and art. His family was forced to flee Russia after the Russian Revolution in 1917. He studied under Aleksandra Ekster at the Kiev Academy, and after graduation worked designing and building theater sets in Odessa and later Berlin from 1920 to 1923.

== Career ==
Tchelitchew moved to Paris in 1923 and became acquainted with Gertrude Stein and, through her, the Sitwell and Gorer families. His interest in creating multimedia experiences during this period that drew together painting, film, and dance, led to collaborations with ballet impresario Sergei Diaghilev (stage designer for &quot;Ode&quot; by Léonide Massine, 1928) and choreographer George Balanchine. He and Edith Sitwell had a long-standing close friendship and they corresponded frequently. Tchelitchew painted six major portraits of Sitwell.

His first U.S. show was of his drawings, along with other artists, at the newly opened Museum of Modern Art in 1930. In 1934, he moved from Paris to New York City with his partner, writer Charles Henri Ford. In New York he continued to work with Balanchine and met his greatest champion and patron, Lincoln Kirstein. From 1940 to 1947, he provided illustrations for the surrealist magazine &quot;View&quot;, edited by Ford and writer and film critic Parker Tyler.

His most significant work is the painting &quot;Hide and Seek&quot;, painted in 1940–42, and owned by the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

Tchelitchew&#x27;s early painting was abstract in style, described as constructivist and futurist and influenced by his study with Aleksandra Ekster. After emigrating to Paris he became associated with the neo-romanticism movement. He continuously experimented with new styles, eventually incorporating multiple perspectives and elements of surrealism and fantasy into his painting. As a set and costume designer, he collaborated with Sergei Diaghilev and George Balanchine, among others.

Tchelitchew&#x27;s works can be found in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the Courtauld Institute of Art in London, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

Among Tchelitchew&#x27;s well-known paintings are portraits of Natalia Glasko, Edith Sitwell, and Gertrude Stein and the works &quot;Phenomena&quot; (1936–1938) and &quot;Cache Cache&quot; (&quot;Hide and Seek&quot;, 1940–1942). Tchelitchew designed sets for &quot;Ode&quot; (Paris, 1928), &quot;L&#x27;Errante&quot; (Paris, 1933), &quot;Nobilissima Visione&quot; (London, 1938) and &quot;Ondine&quot; (Paris, 1939). He was known for camouflaging bodies and faces into geometric lines or landscaped forms on artwork. He used abstractionism and symbolism to convey both the outer and inner appearance of the object. 
== Personal life ==
Tchelitchew became a United States citizen in 1952, but lived mainly in Italy from 1949.

Tchelitchew was openly homosexual. He met the American pianist Allen Tanner in Berlin in the 1920s and the two men became lovers, moving to Paris together to pursue their artistic careers. In 1934, he left Tanner for the poet Charles Henri Ford. Ford and Tchelitchew had met shortly after Ford&#x27;s arrival in Paris in 1933 to publish &quot;The Young and Evil&quot;.

== Death ==
Tchelitchew died in Grottaferrata, Italy in 1957. His long time partner, Charles Henri Ford, was by his bedside. Tchelitchew&#x27;s body is interred in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

<doc id="765209" wikidata="Q230752" url="?curid=765209" title="Auditorium">
<text>An auditorium is a room built to enable an audience to hear and watch performances. For movie theaters, the number of auditoriums is expressed as the number of screens. Auditoriums can be found in entertainment venues, community halls, and theaters, and may be used for rehearsal, presentation, performing arts productions, public speeches or as a learning space.

== Etymology ==
The term is taken from Latin (from &quot;audītōrium&quot;, from &quot;audītōrius&quot; (&quot;pertaining to hearing&quot;)); the concept is taken from the Greek auditorium, which had a series of semi-circular seating shelves in the theatre, divided by broad &#x27;belts&#x27;, called &quot;diazomata&quot;, with eleven rows of seats between each.


== Auditorium structure ==
The audience in a modern theatre are usually separated from the performers by the proscenium arch, although other types of stage are common.

The price charged for seats in each part of the auditorium (known in the industry as the house) usually varies according to the quality of the view of the stage. The seating areas can include some or all of the following:

* Stalls, orchestra or arena: the lower flat area, usually below or at the same level as the stage.
* Balconies or galleries: one or more raised seating platforms towards the rear of the auditorium. In larger theatres, multiple levels are stacked vertically above or behind the stalls. The first level is usually called the dress circle or grand circle. The highest platform, or upper circle is sometimes known as &quot;the gods&quot;, especially in large opera houses, where the seats can be very high and a long distance from the stage.
* Boxes: generally placed immediately to the front, side and above the level of the stage. They are often separate rooms with an open viewing area which generally seat only a handful of people. These seats are generally considered the most prestigious of the house. A state box or royal box is sometimes provided for dignitaries.
* Seating arrangement: Seating arrangements in an auditorium seating layout (or assembly space) will either be identified as &quot;multiple-aisle&quot; or &quot;continental&quot;. These terms are commonly found in design standards manuals, building codes, and similar architectural reference documents. Each size is unique, with specific guidelines governing row size, row spacing, and exit ways. Basically, a multiple-aisle arrangement will have a maximum of 14–16 chairs per row with access to an aisle-way at both ends. In a continental arrangement, all seats are located in a central section. Here the maximum quantity of chairs per row can greatly exceed the limits established in a multiple-aisle arrangement. In order to compensate for the greater length of rows allowed, building codes will require wider row spacing, wider aisles, and strategically located exit doors. Although it would seem like more space is called for, a continental seating plan is often not any less efficient than a multiple-aisle arrangement. In fact, if it is carefully planned, a continental arrangement can frequently accommodate more seating within the same space.

== Similar structures at other venues ==
Sports venues such as stadiums and racetracks also have royal boxes or enclosures, for example at the All England Club and Ascot Racecourse, where access is limited to royal families or other distinguished personalities. In other countries, sports venues have luxury boxes, where access is open to anyone who can afford tickets. Additionally, some sports venues were themselves called auditoriums, such as the former Buffalo Memorial Auditorium.

<doc id="765210" wikidata="Q724242" url="?curid=765210" title="Bill Siksay">
<text>William Livingstone Siksay (born March 11, 1955) is a Canadian politician. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) who represented the British Columbia riding of Burnaby—Douglas for the New Democratic Party from 2004 to 2011.

==Early life==
Siksay was born in Oshawa, Ontario, to parents Patricia and William Siksay. Receiving his high school diploma from McLaughlin Collegiate and Vocational Institute in Oshawa, Ontario, Siksay attended Victoria College at the University of Toronto, graduating with a BA in 1978. He then enrolled in the MDiv programme at the Vancouver School of Theology at the University of British Columbia, studying as a candidate to be a congregational minister in the United Church of Canada. He was one of the first people to come out as gay or lesbian in the process of his ordination and helped start the debate in the church on the ordination and commissioning of openly gay or lesbian candidates. He did not complete the programme and was not ordained.

== Political career ==
Prior to running for elected office, he was constituency assistant to Svend Robinson for over 18 years. He also ran in the 1997 election in the riding of Vancouver Centre, but lost to incumbent Hedy Fry.

When Robinson resigned the Burnaby—Douglas seat in April 2004 due to a controversy around his theft of a piece of jewellery, Siksay won the nomination to replace Robinson as the NDP candidate in the upcoming election, and won the riding in the 2004 federal election on June 28.

With his election, Siksay became the first openly gay non-incumbent man to be elected to Canada&#x27;s House of Commons. All of the previous MPs to come out as gay (Robinson, Libby Davies, Réal Ménard and Scott Brison) came out after they were elected, and Mario Silva came out in a &quot;Toronto Star&quot; profile shortly after the 2004 election.

In the NDP Shadow Cabinet, Siksay was critic for Ethics, Access to Information and Privacy, and for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Issues; the NDP&#x27;s was the only shadow cabinet with this latter position. He was previously critic for Citizenship and Immigration, and then for Canadian Heritage and Housing.

In May 2005, Siksay introduced a bill to amend the &quot;Canadian Human Rights Act&quot; to prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or expression. He reintroduced the bill in the next parliament. In May 2009 he introduced it again, with additional provisions to add gender identity and expression to the hate crimes provisions of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;. By June 2010, the private member&#x27;s bill (C-389) had proceeded to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, with little overt opposition from the Conservative Party of Canada minority government evident. It passed at report stage by a vote of 143–131 on December 8, and passed at third reading by a vote of 143–135, in each case including members of all parties voting in favour.

In January 2006, Siksay was re-elected to the Burnaby—Douglas seat with a slightly increased plurality, with a margin of 2.5% (versus 2% in 2004). He was again re-elected by a narrow margin in the 2008 election.

Bill Siksay was the only MP in Parliament to vote against the Tackling Violent Crime Act (Bill C-2), arguing that its provisions on the age of consent would harm LGBT youth.

On December 16, 2010, Siksay announced that he would not run again in the subsequent election. His seat was retained for the New Democrats by Kennedy Stewart in the 2011 federal election.

== After politics ==
On July 2, 2014, Siksay began as working as the administrative assistant to the bishop of the Anglican Diocese of New Westminster, Melissa M. Skelton, who retired February 28, 2021. After Skelton&#x27;s retirement, Siksay continued to serve the new bishop of the diocese, John Stephens, and the executive archdeacon of the diocese, Douglas Fenton.

==Personal life==
He resides in Burnaby with his partner, the Reverend Brian Burke, and remains an active member of the United Church of Canada.

<doc id="765211" wikidata="Q4984083" url="?curid=765211" title="Budashiri">
<text>Budashiri or Buddhashiri (Mongolian: ᠪᠤᠳᠢᠰᠢᠷᠢ, , Sinicized as &quot;Putashali&quot;, ) (c. 1307 – c. 1340) was Empress of China and Khatun of Mongols as the wife of Jayaatu Khan Tugh Temür. She acted as an interim regent and was the prominent figure of the Yuan dynasty between 1332 and 1339; she was interim regent after the death of her husband and the election of his successor in 1332-1333, and then regent during the minority of his successor in 1333-1339.

She came from the Khongirad clan. Her father was Prince Consort Diwabala, Prince of Lu, and her mother was Princess Supreme Sengge Ragi of Lu.

==Empress of Yuan==
It is uncertain when Budashiri became the wife of Tugh Temür, though she became empress in 1328 when her husband ascended the throne for the first time. In the early part of 1329, she received the imperial seal.

During her husband&#x27;s reign, the empress was responsible for exiling the young Toghon Temür to Goryeo, and then to Henan. Her claim was that he was not the actual son of Khutughtu Khan Kusala (Emperor Mingzong), Tugh Temür&#x27;s older brother. It was during Toghon Temür&#x27;s exile that Budashiri also arranged for the execution of his stepmother, Babusha, having accused her of the coup against her late husband.

==Regency==

When Tugh Temür died in 1332, Budashiri acted as regent, which was in accordance with tradition and because Tugh Temür had not named a successor. It is said that on his deathbed, Tugh Temür had expressed remorse for what he had done to his elder brother, and intended to pass the throne on to his nephew Toghon Temür, his brother&#x27;s eldest son. As a result, Budashiri did not appoint her own son El Tegüs to the throne, but neither did she appoint Toghon Temür; it was Kusala&#x27;s second son, the six-year-old Rinchinbal, who was instead installed as emperor on 13 October 1332. This the empress did under pressure from the grand councilor, El Temür, who resisted allowing Toghon Temür to accede to the throne since he was suspected of having poisoned his father. A month after she had appointed Rinchinbal, Budashiri was granted the rank of empress dowager, and was tasked with assuming the regency. However, only two months (fifty-three days) later, the young emperor died.

El Temür went on to insist that she install El Tegüs on the throne, but the empress refused, maintaining that she was still honouring the wishes of her late husband, and that El Tegüs was too young to rule. Instead, she brought back the thirteen-year-old Toghon Temür and installed him as emperor in 1333. In 1336, she was elevated to the rank of grand empress dowager.

Budashiri remained regent for over seven years, virtually ruling over the empire. However, in 1340, when the emperor grew confident that he could take control and decide matters, he began an investigation into the injustices suffered by his late father and stepmother. He also pointed out the various wrongs done to him by the grand empress dowager. As a result, in mid-1340 he ordered that Budashiri be stripped of all her titles and exiled to Dong&#x27;an Prefecture (the modern-day city of Langfang in Hebei Province), where she was swiftly put to death. In further retaliation for the difficulties he had faced while in exile, Toghon Temür also banished El Tegüs, who was killed shortly afterwards. Budashiri was about 33 years old when she died.

== Family ==
It is thought she had borne him at least three sons:

# Aratnadara ( 22 February 1331)
# Gunadara, later renamed El Tegüs ()
# Baoning, later renamed Taipingna (died young)

It is not known if she had any daughters.

==In art==
A portrait of Empress Budashiri, alongside Empress Babusha, is found on the Yamantaka-Vajrabhairava mandala. Opposite of the two empresses are portraits of Tugh Temür and Kusala.

<doc id="765216" wikidata="Q765838" url="?curid=765216" title="Melvin Purvis">
<text>Melvin Horace Purvis II (October 24, 1903 – February 29, 1960) was an FBI agent instrumental in capturing bank robbers John Dillinger and Pretty Boy Floyd in 1934. All of this would later overshadow his military career which saw him directly involved with General George Patton, Hermann Göring, and the Nuremberg Trials.

==Early life and early career==
Purvis was born in Timmonsville, South Carolina, to Melvin Horace Purvis Sr. (1869–1938), a tobacco farmer and businessman, and Janie Elizabeth (née Mims, 1874–1927); he was the fifth of eight siblings. He attended Timmonsville High School where in 1920 he was the yearbook&#x27;s business manager, historian for his graduating class, on the football team, on the baseball team, was a president of the literary society, on the debate team, and played drums in the school orchestra. He then enrolled in the University of South Carolina and joined the Rho chapter of the Kappa Alpha Order there in 1921. He received his law degree from the University of South Carolina School of Law in 1922. Upon graduating, he passed the bar examination in South Carolina and practiced law in Florence as a junior partner at the firm of Willcox &amp; Hardee, now called Willcox, Buyck &amp; Williams, PA, for two years and as an insurance adjuster for W. H. Clarkson &amp; Co for 18 months. Seeking adventure, he went to Washington DC and unsuccessfully sought a job in the Foreign Service as a diplomat. He applied at the Justice Department and was hired by the Bureau of Investigation, the forerunner to the FBI, in December 1926 and began serving there in February 1927. BOI investigators looking into Purvis&#x27; character and background were told that he was honest and industrious and ambitious, but not brilliant or hard-boiled enough to be a &quot;money maker.&quot;

==Career at the FBI==
Purvis&#x27; performance reviews always rated his appearance and loyalty to the Bureau at 100%. He rated lowest for his understanding of the Manual of Instruction and the Manual of Rules and Regulations, which stayed at about 80% and for which Bureau of Investigation Director J. Edgar Hoover once chided him as being unacceptable. Just before becoming Special Agent in Charge of Chicago, his score on the rules and instruction rose to 100% and stayed there. He rose quickly through the ranks and by 1932, he had headed the Bureau of Investigation offices in Birmingham, Alabama, then Oklahoma City followed by a move to Cincinnati. In 1932, Hoover placed him in charge of the Chicago office. He led an investigation into the crash of United Airlines Trip 23, which uncovered foul play as the cause of the crash.

=== The Factor case ===
As Special Agent in Charge at the Chicago office, Purvis investigated John Factor&#x27;s kidnapping. It happened July 1, 1933 as Factor was returning home from an evening of gambling with friends near Elkhorn, Wisconsin. The man convicted of kidnapping him, Roger Touhy, claimed Factor faked his own kidnapping to avoid extradition to the United Kingdom for a stocks fraud he had been convicted, in absentia, for having committed there. The FBI believed Touhy chose Factor as a victim precisely because potential extradition would make Factor avoid help from the authorities. This is what he had done when his son had been previously kidnapped. Factor&#x27;s own kidnapping was reported, however; thus the FBI was required to investigate. He was released after 11 days of captivity, burned and beaten. He remembered the face of his abductor, the voices of his captors and environmental details. The house where he was held was found and from there, investigators tracked back to the Touhy gang. The gang had been arrested the day of Factor&#x27;s release, their car filled with guns and the equipment used to tie kidnap victims in that era: linen strips and tough window sash cord. With the permission of Elkhorn&#x27;s law enforcement, agents brought the gang to Purvis in Chicago without an extradition order. Roger Touhy was convicted of the kidnapping and lost on appeal before the Supreme Court of Illinois. Upon release, he wrote a book claiming that Factor faked his own kidnapping. Factor sued him, his publisher, printer and ghost-writer but the complaint was dismissed on a technicality. (Factor had been born in Russian Poland but left before the Bolshevik Revolution and refused, at the cost of his citizenship, to register as a citizen of Stalin&#x27;s USSR. As a stateless person at the time he filed, he could not sue.)

=== John Dillinger ===
John Dilllinger was already a convicted felon, paroled on May 22, 1933, when he robbed a bank in New Carlisle, Ohio, on June 10 of that year. Between then and March 3, 1934, he formed a gang and robbed ten banks. None of these were federal crimes, not even the killing of Sheriff Jesse Sarber. It was not until Dillinger drove a car across a state boundary that the FBI could get involved in the hunt for him.

==== The Little Bohemia Lodge ====
Dillinger and his gang had been on the run ever since his March 3 escape. They wanted to rest somewhere remote. At a restaurant just outside Chicago, the Little Bohemia Lodge in remote northern Wisconsin came up in conversation in on April 19. The gang decided to hide there for a few days and they arrived the afternoon of April 20. The next day the owner, Emil Wanatka, and his wife had figured out who they were and by late in the day they had had enough of them. Early the next morning Mrs. Wanatka got word out to her brother-in-law, Lloyd Voss, to call a federal authority they knew in Chicago. Purvis was contacted that morning but the lodge was in the jurisdiction of the St. Paul office, not Chicago. So he called that office and passed the tip to FBI Assistant Director Hugh Clegg, assigned by Hoover to oversee the pursuit of Dillinger, as well as FBI Inspector William Rorer and Special Agent in Charge at St. Paul, Werner Hanni. As ranking officer, Clegg chartered a plane to carry him and other agents from St. Paul, Minnesota to Rhinelander, Wisconsin. Fifty miles from the lodge, this was the closest they could get by air. Hanni, afraid of flying, travelled with his agents by car and brought the tear gas equipment that the planes refused to carry for safety reasons. Purvis and his Chicago agents flew in two other planes he chartered to Rhinelander to assist the Minnesota agents.

Clegg arrived first. He scoured the town for cars he could rent and went back to the airport when he saw Purvis&#x27; planes flying in. There, Mr. Voss told him the gangsters had changed their plans and decided to leave that evening after dinner. Clegg sent Purvis and other agents out to pick up the cars he had earlier found at a Ford dealership. Purvis also commandeered the car belonging to the airport bystander who had given them a ride to the dealership.

The only guide the agents had was a diagram drawn by Voss, but they set out at dusk over the slushy, muddy, potholed roads. It took them two hours to reach the vicinity of the lodge and two cars broke down on the way. Their agents rode on the running boards of the remaining cars, clutching their machine guns as best they could. Clegg and Purvis approached the house together. There were no outdoor lights. Mrs. Wanatka&#x27;s dogs began barking. No one had told them about the dogs, or about the three innocent diners inside. These three left the lodge and started up their car. Its radio blared loudly. The agents identified themselves, but the customers could not hear them over the radio. Clegg and Purvis simultaneously gave the order to shoot and instead of gangsters, agents killed Eugene Boiseneau, a 33-year-old Civilian Conservation Corps worker, and wounded Tom Morris, a 59-year-old cook at the CCC camp, and gas station attendant John Hoffman. Purvis tried to return fire on a fleeing figure that fired on them in the dark, but his machine gun jammed. This was Babyface Nelson who would kill Special Agent W. Carter Baum, wound Special Agent Jay C. Newman and also wound Sheriff&#x27;s Deputy Carl C. Christiansen later that night at a different location as they investigated a report of suspicious activity there. The car Newman was driving, which Nelson stole, was the one Purvis had commandeered. Agents sent to surround the lodge fell into a ditch in the dark while, unbeknownst to them, Dillinger&#x27;s gang escaped through rear windows on the second story. Hanni arrived with the tear gas and agents fired the canisters into the house at daybreak, but the only people left were lodge employees and the gangsters&#x27; girlfriends.

===== Aftermath =====
This raid would be the FBI&#x27;s worst failure for the next 59 years. Purvis was targeted for negative public attention despite the fact that the authorities from the St. Paul office had jurisdiction and of those both Assistant Director Clegg and Inspector Rorer outranked him. Nevertheless, a petition calling for Purvis&#x27;s suspension surfaced in the towns around the Little Bohemia Lodge. Inspector Rorer investigated on April 25 and found that it had been written by two reporters who then got a local resident to present it to the area civic organization as a petition calling for an investigation of the civilian deaths.

By May 8, Hoover was told that a former FBI agent, Thomas F. Cullen who had served in Chicago, was claiming to have heard that the agents at Little Bohemia that night had locked Clegg, Rorer, and Purvis in a shed, mutinying because of how badly the situation was being handled. He asked Assistant Director Harold Nathan to interview all the agents involved. On June 1 Nathan reported that every agent involved positively denied all the rumors. All the Chicago agents denied talking to Cullen. A week earlier, on May 2, Hoover had heard from Assistant Director Edward A. Tamm that the Chicago agents had been sent to Philadelphia on a false lead and, while there, Special Agent in Charge John Mclaughlin said he did not think Clegg, Rorer, Purvis, or Hanni were open enough to the observations and suggestions of agents under them. After this, Hoover put FBI Inspector Samuel P. Cowley on a special assignment to supervise the nationwide manhunt for Dillinger. Cowley was to personally control, and was personally responsible for, the special agents in charge who worked on this case, no matter where they were assigned.

==== Mock trial in pursuit of Dillinger ====
The false lead that sent federal agents to Pennsylvania in pursuit of Dillinger came from a Black man named John Kelly. Sometime after their return to Chicago they brought Kelly to FBI district offices there and led Kelly to believe he was on trial in order to scare the truth out of him, a very clear violation of the law and of his civil rights. FBI assistant director Nathan, who was far more senior than Purvis, was there and acted as judge. Another agent acted as defense counsel and a third acted as prosecuting attorney. Kelly eventually told his story to a Chicago newspaper and by early November someone had inquired about it of Director Hoover. Hoover immediately denied it, but on November 3 he sent a memo to Tamm stating that he had telephoned Purvis to ask him about it. Purvis told him that he had only witnessed Nathan giving Kelly a stern lecture to &quot;put the fear of God&quot; into the man and scare the truth out of him. He said that Mr. Faulkner and Mr. Waters were present and that Waters asked Nathan to let Kelly go quietly. He said if it was a mock trial, he had no knowledge of that and it certainly had not been planned. Purvis said he saw nothing to indicate it was anything more than an interrogation and a lecture. Hoover told Tamm that he informed Purvis that agents are only allowed to interrogate subjects and have no right to make them believe they are on trial; that if agents did this they would have no way to defend themselves. Four days later, Hoover wrote to Purvis that Nathan admitted to the FBI that a mock trial had, indeed, been held and that Purvis had, indeed, been present. Hoover told Purvis that he was disturbed by the differences in their stories and that activities like that cannot be tolerated under any circumstances in FBI offices.

==== Catching Dillinger ====
Anna Sage was born Ana Cumpănaș in Romania. She immigrated to Chicago with her first husband and had a son, but her marriage ended when she began an affair with East Chicago, Indiana, police officer Martin Zarkovich. She worked as a prostitute and took over the brothel when the owner died. Because of this, she was being deported as an undesirable alien. When she found out her friend, waitress and prostitute Polly Hamilton, was dating Dillinger she called her old boyfriend Zarkovich.

Cowley was in Purvis&#x27;s office when a call came in from East Chicago Police Captain Timothy O&#x27;Neill and Zarkovich on July 21, 1934. The officers met Purvis and Cowley in Cowley&#x27;s hotel room that night and later continued on to meet Sage. She offered to help catch Dillinger in exchange for being allowed to stay in the country with her son. Purvis told her he had no control over her fate, but he, as Special Agent in Charge of the Chicago office of the Department of Investigation, would recommend she not be deported. He said she could get a financial reward, but he had no control over that either. With faith in the promise of his recommendation, Sage agreed to help and he accepted her offer. She told them that Dillinger liked to go to movies—usually at the Marbro Theater—and she, Hamilton and Dillinger had plans to go the next night. Cowley, Purvis and O&#x27;Neill surveyed the area around the Marbro and decided ahead of time where agents would be posted.

Sunday morning Cowley ordered all agents to be ready to deploy on a moment&#x27;s notice. He was stationed with a team of agents at the Marbro when Sage called Purvis in the office and told him Dillinger would be leaving for either the Marbro or the Biograph Theater in five minutes. Purvis rushed agents there to survey it. Zarkovich and special agent Charles Winstead joined Cowley at the Marbro when Purvis took agent Brown to the Biograph. Winstead and Brown would call the office every five minutes to check in or when Dillinger appeared. Dillinger arrived at the Biograph with Sage and Hamilton 40 minutes after Purvis did. Brown immediately called Cowley who instructed that the agents there take positions in the same basic pattern as at the Marbro. He would bring his team and do the same. Five were posted closest to the entrance: Purvis, agents Herman Hollis and Brown to the south, and Chicago police officers Glen Stretch and Peter Sopsic to the north. Others would be stationed up and down the street to stop Dillinger should he get past the first five. Zarkovich would be directly across the street from the Biograph entrance. O&#x27;Neill was across the street and down the block southward at an alley entrance. Cowley would be across the street halfway up the block to the north.&quot;&quot;

In the heat, Dillinger was wearing a straw boater, grey trousers and no jacket. Purvis thought of arresting him at the ticket window but decided the risk to the crowd there was too great. Instead he bought a ticket, went into the theater and looked for Dillinger, hoping to surround and arrest him within but the theater was too crowded. He came back out and chatted with the ticket seller, finding out how long the movie lasted and when the customers would be leaving. All the agents had arrived so he went to each and relayed that information to them. He also told them to watch for his signals: lighting his cigar on recognizing Dillinger, and waving his hand to indicate the moment to arrest him. Then he stood closest to the theater exit. All the agents waited for two hours. Noticing men loitering in doorways that long, the theater employees thought they were about to be robbed. They phoned the police but a federal agent quietly identified himself to the officers in the arriving squad car and they withdrew. Moviegoers started flowing out of the theater shortly after. Dillinger appeared, flanked by Hamilton and Sage, in a crowd of women and children. Purvis lit his cigar. He waited for the crowd to disperse a bit as Dillinger moved south past him, then he gave the hand signal. Stretch and Sopsic, distracted by a pedestrian talking to them, did not see the signal. Purvis walked to the middle of the sidewalk and repeated it. They still missed it. Special Agents Redmon, Campbell, Winstead and Hollis moved a bit forward to act in their place if necessary. Purvis saw Hamilton give a small tug to Dillinger&#x27;s shirt as a signal that something was wrong. He saw Dillinger reach into his shirt for a pistol. He tore the buttons off his own jacket in reaching for his gun, but it was agents Hollis, Winstead and Clarence Hurt who shot Dillinger. He fell, mortally wounded, between where special agents Walter, Lackerman and Hurt had been positioned. Two bystanders were shot, one in the thigh and one grazed in the side. Dillinger died on the way to the hospital, so he was taken to a morgue instead, where he was identified by fingerprints and eventually released to his family.

Faithful to his promise, Purvis wrote Hoover asking what could be done for Anna Sage. Hoover replied that it was a State Department matter and they could do nothing. So Purvis released a statement about Anna Sage to the press that read, in part, 

=== Pretty Boy Floyd ===
Hoover had already put Cowley in personal control of all agents involved in investigating the June 1933 Kansas City Massacre. In mid-October Special Agent in Charge Purvis and agents under him were in Cincinnati working on a kidnapping case when the Cincinnati FBI office told them that Adam Richetti, one of the perpetrators of the massacre, had been caught in Wellsville Ohio the day before. Purvis got authorization from Cowley in Washington to drop the kidnapping and go to Wellsville to take Richetti into federal custody and pursue his companion, Charles Arthur, AKA &quot;Pretty boy,&quot; Floyd.

Floyd had been on the run since his escape when Richetti was captured. On October 22, 1934, he stopped at the widowed Elen Conkle&#x27;s farmhouse asking for food. Not knowing who he was, she fixed him a meal. Afterward her brother and sister-in-law came in from the fields where they had been working. Floyd asked them for a ride. Their car was parked behind a corn crib and as it began to pull out, Floyd shouted for them to back up because the police were pursuing him. Purvis and his agents had been canvasing the area in search of any trace of Floyd when they came upon the car behind the corn crib. As they pulled up on the other side of the crib, Floyd began to run, zig-zagging across an open field, pistol in hand. When he refused to stop and submit to the authorities, they opened fire and he dropped, mortally wounded.

After Purvis became a media figure for killing Dillinger, his high public profile was resented by local law enforcement. He reportedly incurred the wrath of Hoover, who had previously supported him but now supposedly felt overshadowed. Purvis resigned from the FBI in 1935. In a 2005 book co-written by Purvis&#x27;s son Alston, Hoover is portrayed as jealous of the attention given to Purvis after Dillinger was killed. However, a memo FBI Deputy Associate Director Deke Deloach sent to Administrative Division Assistant Director Jim Mohr the week after Purvis&#x27; death referred to a newspaper article that claimed Purvis had quit because he was not promoted to the number 2 or 3 spot in the FBI and that Washington officials quarreled over the vast publicity he received. According to the memo Clyde Tolson, reflecting on Purvis&#x27; resignation, said he had never heard the two allegations before. Notated in Hoover&#x27;s handwriting is the comment, &quot;Someone at Chicago must have talked.&quot;

== Career after the FBI ==
After leaving the FBI Purvis moved to San Francisco where he passed the California bar examination and practiced law for two years. He also began endorsing products including Gillette razors, Dodge cars and Post Toasties. This led to him signing on to host the radio show, &quot;Junior G-man: The Melvin Purvis Club&quot; as part of, not just a marketing scheme, but a crusade for social order through combating juvenile delinquency. In 1936, Purvis published a memoir of his years as an investigator with the Bureau, entitled &quot;American Agent&quot;. He had dinner in San Francisco with actor Frederick March in this time period, according to what March told the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1940. He told March that he might star in a movie with Universal Pictures. In 1937 he moved to Los Angeles, becoming a technical advisor on several films. He dated Jean Harlow briefly and befriended Clark Gable. He became engaged to actress Janice Jarrett, but they never married. He travelled to Europe in April shortly after the cancelled wedding. There he met and socialised briefly with Hermann Göring before returning to the US. In 1938 he settled back in Florence, South Carolina, and on September 14 of that year married his old sweetheart, Marie Rosanne Willcox, daughter of his first law partner. They had three sons. In 1939 he founded the Florence Evening Star and published it until 1941. In 1941 he bought part of WOLS, the local radio station in Florence. His spacious office there was where many members of the public came to meet the famous G-man.

=== Wartime service ===
The United States declared war on the Empire of Japan on December 8, 1941. Knowing Hoover had blocked professional opportunities from reaching him, Purvis quickly asked Hoover by letter not to prevent him serving in the Army as an officer. Purvis entered the service as a captain on January 31, 1942. By spring of that year he was serving in Washington in the Office of the Provost Marshal, part of whose jurisdiction was criminal investigation. He was promoted to major and received Provost Marshal training. He interviewed candidates for the Provost Marshal schools in Michigan and Georgia before being assigned as executive officer for Brigadier General Joseph V.D. Dillon, Provost Marshal General for the North African Theater which covered Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. Allied turncoats were rare, so the Provost Marshal instead focused on black marketeering. Purvis arrived in August 1943 to find that about 20% of American materiel arriving there was stolen and sold illegally, forcing him and the 350 men under him to spend significant amounts of time investigating and apprehending criminal groups.

Purvis also investigated criminal complaints lodged against military personnel. When General Patton slapped two soldiers being treated for PTSD in evacuation hospitals, Purvis was sent to interview him on August 10, 1943, as part of the investigation. This investigation resulted in Patton being demoted to military governor of Sicily. Sensitive missions in Italy and northwest Europe followed this assignment, but details of this part of his service were lost in a fire at the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis in 1973.

He was then summoned back to Washington DC to help organize the War Crimes Division of what was called at that time the War Department, now the Department of Defense. On February 8, 1945, the War Department tasked him with locating high-level Nazis accused of war crimes. In this capacity, he returned to Europe and searched Heidelberg on the strength of rumors that Adolf Hitler and Martin Bormann were alive and hiding there. Purvis had risen to the rank of colonel by the time he finished his service with the Army in April 1945.

Following this he was appointed Chief American Investigator of War Crimes and assisted in establishing the protocols for the Nuremberg Trials. While fulfilling this task, he was ordered to interview Göring in his cell. Göring asked Purvis on the night of October 15, 1946 if he could avoid execution by hanging and Purvis said no. That night, sometime after this interview, Göring committed suicide by ingesting cyanide.

=== Post-war service ===
When he returned to Florence, he bought out his partner at the radio station, becoming the sole owner. South Carolina senator Olin D. Johnston, chair of the Post Office and Civil Service Subcommittee, asked Purvis to serve as counsel to a subcommittee investigating the federal civil service system for bribery and waste and Purvis began in May 1951 and served until 1953 (The Senate Subcommittee on Manpower Policies was informally known as the Purvis Committee at the time). In mid-September 1958, he accepted Johnston&#x27;s invitation to serve as counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee&#x27;s Subcommittee on Improvements in Judicial Machinery in its task to reform judicial practices and end a logjam of cases.

==Death==
On February 29, 1960, Purvis was at his home in Florence, South Carolina, when he died from a gunshot wound to the head. His wife, in the yard at the time, found him on the landing of an upstairs hall. The shot was fired from the pistol that was given to him by fellow agents when he resigned from the FBI. That day the Chief Counsel for the US Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee, a former FBI agent who left the service in 1951, called Assistant FBI Director Robert Wick. He said Purvis had not looked well for weeks and had not eaten since coming down with the flu. Coworkers forced him to take a plane home. He looked ashen in color. He worried that he might have a progressive, degenerative bone disease but he had told the Chief Counsel a few weeks previous that he would never commit suicide because he had too much to live for. The FBI investigated his death and declared it a suicide, although the official coroner&#x27;s report did not label the cause of death as such. A later investigation suggested that Purvis may have shot himself accidentally while trying to extract a tracer bullet. He was 56 years old.

<doc id="765218" wikidata="Q654471" url="?curid=765218" title="Hero of the Russian Federation">
<text>Hero of the Russian Federation (), also unofficially called Hero of Russia (), is the highest honorary title of the Russian Federation. The title has a Gold Star medal, an insignia of honour that identifies recipients.

The title is awarded to persons for &quot;service to the Russian state and nation, usually connected with a heroic feat of valour&quot;. The title is bestowed by decree of the president of the Russian Federation. Russian citizenship or being in the service of the Russian state is not obligatory.

The title was established in 1992 and, , was awarded more than 970 times, of which more than 440 were posthumously.

== History ==

The title &quot;Hero of Russia&quot; is a successor to Hero of the Soviet Union (), which was established by Resolution of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union of 5 May 1934. The corresponding Gold Star is derived from the Soviet design, created by architect Miron Merzhanov and approved by Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of 1 August 1939, and the ribbon was updated from the Soviet flag colors to the colors of the Russian flag.

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russian Federation under president Boris Yeltsin retained a modified award by Law of the Russian Federation No. 2553-1 20 March 1992. Article 71 of the Constitution of Russia permits titles, orders and medals to be presented by the government, and Article 89 gives the Russian president power to create state awards. This is the highest honour that can be presented by the Russian president to a citizen.

== Statute ==
The title of Hero of the Russian Federation can be awarded for a heroic deed in the service of the state. It can be awarded to both civilian and military personnel. The title can also be awarded posthumously if the heroic act costs the recipient his or her life. The President of the Russian Federation is the main conferring authority of the award.

== Description ==
The insignia of the title of &quot;Hero of the Russian Federation&quot; is also called the &quot;Gold Star&quot; medal (), its design is similar to the Soviet variant.

The &quot;Gold Star&quot; medal is a gold five-pointed star with smooth 15mm dihedral rays on the obverse. The otherwise plain reverse bears the prominent relief inscription in 2mm high letters &quot;HERO OF RUSSIA&quot; () at its centre, in the upper portion, the award serial number in 1mm high numbers.

The insignia is secured to a standard Russian square mount by a ring through the suspension loop. The mount is covered by a silk moiré tricolour ribbon of white, blue, and red.

The insignia of Hero of the Russian Federation is worn on the left side of the chest above all other medals and decorations. It is always worn in full size; there is no ribbon bar or rosette that can be worn in lieu of the medal. When worn together with Soviet-era hero titles (Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Socialist Labour), the Russian title has precedence.

==Recipients==

The majority of the early recipients of the title fell into two categories: participants in the Chechnya conflicts or cosmonauts. On some occasions, the person who was awarded the title was killed while in the course of duty, such as Major Denis Vetchinov, who was killed early in the 2008 South Ossetia War. This includes those killed in battle as well as assassinated government officials. An example of such a recipient was Akhmad Kadyrov, the former governor of Chechnya. The pro-Moscow leader was killed in a bomb attack during the 2004 Victory Day parade in the Chechen capital of Grozny. Several days after Akhmad was killed, President Vladimir Putin awarded him the title. Some time after the incident, Putin awarded Kadyrov&#x27;s son, Ramzan, the same title for his work in Chechnya.

All Russian cosmonauts are awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation following their voyage into space; some may already have earned it, for example for long service as a test pilot. Cosmonauts are also awarded the title Pilot-Cosmonaut of the Russian Federation. Some recipients of the title, such as Sergei Krikalev, had also received the Soviet hero title, along with the Order of Lenin. Most of the cosmonaut double heroes were awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia titles &quot;for successful realization of flight and the courage and heroism shown.&quot;

Outside those two groups, athletes and other civilian and military officials have also received the title. Notable examples include:
* Submarine captain Gennady Lyachin, of the &quot;Kursk&quot;, which sank after an explosion in 2000. Due to his heroism during the explosion and his attempts at preserving the lives of the crew, Lyachin was posthumously awarded the title, and the members of his crew were awarded the Order of Courage.
* Athlete Larisa Lazutina was presented with the title for various medals won at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.
* Alexander Karelin was awarded for his recognition as the greatest wrestler of all time (from antiquity to the present day). He was a Greco-Roman wrestler in the Olympics, and in his career he won 887 bouts and lost only 2 times. His losses are controversial because commentators believe they were caused by trivial rule changes, not a bona fide athletic defeat.
* Arktika 2007 expedition members Anatoly Sagalevich, and Artur Chilingarov, who on 10 January 2008, performed the first ever descent to the ocean bottom at the North Pole. Awarded the title &quot;for courage and heroism showed in extreme conditions and successful completion of high-latitude Arctic deep-water expedition.&quot;
* Weapons designer Mikhail T. Kalashnikov, designer of the AK-47 assault rifle and PK machine gun. He received the honour on his 90th birthday, 10 November 2009.
On 16 August 2009, the Russian Air Force&#x27;s aerobatics demonstration team, Russian Knights&#x27; commander, Guard Colonel Igor Tkachenko was killed when his Sukhoi Su-27 collided in mid-air with another Sukhoi Su-27 whilst practicing for the 2009 MAKS Airshow. He was awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation posthumously on 22 August 2009.

The medal has been awarded posthumously approximately 340 times, primarily to people involved in the first and second wars in Chechnya. In 2010 a posthumous award was made by President Dmitry Medvedev to Evgeny Chernyshov, the chief of the Moscow fire department on 24 March 2010. Chernyshov died on 20 March 2010 saving others&#x27; lives.

On 28 March 2012, during a training exercise at a Far Eastern military base near the town of Belogorsk, Major Sergei Solnechnikov pushed a soldier away from an unsuccessfully thrown grenade and covered the grenade with his own body after it bounced back into the trench they were in with dozens of soldiers standing nearby. He was awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation posthumously the following day on 29 March.

In February 2014, Colonel who was commander of a detachment of Russian Spetsnaz took part in the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. On 4 April 2014 in a (&quot;closed&quot;) decree of the President of the Russian Federation, he was awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation for &quot;courage and heroism displayed in the performance of military duty.&quot;

On 24 November 2015, a Turkish Air Force F-16 shot down a Sukhoi Su-24 which Turkey claimed had violated its airspace. Lieutenant Colonel Oleg Peshkov and Major ejected successfully from the aircraft but they were exposed to ground fire and Peshkov died as a result. Murakhtin was rescued safely later. On 25 November, President Vladimir Putin awarded the Hero of Russia posthumously to Peshkov and Murakhtin was awarded with the Order of Courage.

On 17 March 2016, Senior Lieutenant Alexander Prokhorenko was the pilot of a Sukhoi Su-25 ground attack aircraft shot down during Palmyra offensive of the Syrian Civil War. During his last moments, he was allegedly surrounded on all sides by ISIS fighters and he decided to order an airstrike at his own position, killing himself and all of the approaching fighters. Before he died, he called the commander: &quot;They are outside, conduct the airstrike now please hurry, this is the end, tell my family I love them and I died fighting for my motherland. Unable command, I am surrounded, they are outside, I don&#x27;t want them to take me and parade me, conduct the airstrike, they will make a mockery of me and this uniform. I want to die with dignity and take all these bastards with me. Please my last wish, conduct the airstrike, they will kill me either way. They [are] outside, this is the end commander, thank you, tell my family and my country I love them. Tell them I was brave and I fought until I could no longer. Please take care of my family, avenge my death, good bye commander, tell my family I love them!&quot;. On 11 April 2016, President Vladimir Putin declared Prokhorenko a Hero of the Russian Federation, the highest Russian honor.

On 10 July 2016, Police Lieutenant Magomed Nurbagandov from Dagestan was captured by Islamic militants. With the whole incident videotaped by the militants, they demanded that Nurbagandov and his colleagues resign from the police force, but he defied them and said to the camera &quot;Keep on working, brothers!&quot; before being shot dead. On 22 September 2016, President Putin praised the officer as a model for others and awarded the Hero of Russia posthumously to Nurbagandov which was handed to his parents.

On 10 May 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin personally awarded medals to four officers of the Special Operations Forces for showing extraordinary courage combating terrorists in Syria. They were part of a 16-man special forces detachment unit which managed to successfully repulse attacks conducted by over 300 jihadists without any losses. The commander of the unit, Lieutenant Colonel Danilo was awarded the honorary title of Hero of the Russian Federation.

On 3 February 2018, Major Roman Filipov was the pilot of a Sukhoi Su-25 ground attack aircraft shot down by Syrian militants belonging to Tahrir al-Sham using a portable air-defence (MANPAD) system. Major Filipov successfully ejected but landed in a rebel-controlled area and fought a gun battle against militants. Images posted online show that he emptied both his pistol magazines and just as the militants surrounded him, he set off a hand grenade shouting “This is for the boys!” On 6 February 2018, President Vladimir Putin signed an executive order awarding Major Roman Filipov the title of Hero of the Russian Federation.

On 15 August 2019, Ural Airlines Flight 178 crash landed in a cornfield shortly after takeoff. With the successful emergency landing, the airline praised the professionalism of the pilots. The pilot in command and the first officer were awarded the honorary title of Hero of the Russian Federation; the rest of the crew were decorated with the Order of Courage.

In December 2020, according to the Russian Defense Ministry, 1st Captain of the Russian Navy&#x27;s Northern Fleet was awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation &quot;for the performance of special tasks associated with the risk to life during one of the long voyages.&quot;

<doc id="765220" wikidata="Q159542" url="?curid=765220" title="Jan Evangelista Purkyně">
<text>Jan Evangelista Purkyně (; also written Johann Evangelist Purkinje) (17 or 18 December 1787 – 28 July 1869) was a Czech anatomist and physiologist. In 1839, he coined the term &quot;protoplasma&quot; for the fluid substance of a cell. He was one of the best known scientists of his time. Such was his fame that when people from outside Europe wrote letters to him, all that they needed to put as the address was &quot;Purkyně, Europe&quot;.

== Biography ==
Purkyně was born in the Kingdom of Bohemia (then part of the Austrian monarchy, now Czech Republic). After completing senior high school in 1804, Purkyně joined the Piarists order as a monk but subsequently left &quot;to deal more freely with science.&quot;

In 1818, Purkyně graduated from Charles University in Prague with a degree in medicine, where he was appointed a Professor of Physiology. He discovered the Purkinje effect, the human eye&#x27;s much reduced sensitivity to dim red light compared to dim blue light, and published in 1823 description of several entoptic phenomena. He published two volumes, &quot;Observations and Experiments Investigating the Physiology of Senses&quot; and &quot;New Subjective Reports about Vision&quot;, which contributed to the emergence of the science of experimental psychology. He created the world&#x27;s first Department of Physiology at the University of Breslau in Prussia (now Wrocław, Poland) in 1839 and the world&#x27;s second official physiology laboratory in 1842. Here he was a founder of the Literary-Slav Society.

 In 1850, he accepted the Physiology chair at Prague Medical Faculty, a position he held until his death.

Purkyně is best known for his 1837 discovery of Purkinje cells, large neurons with many branching dendrites found in the cerebellum. He is also known for his discovery in 1839 of Purkinje fibres, the fibrous tissue that conducts electrical impulses from the atrioventricular node to all parts of the ventricles of the heart. Other discoveries include Purkinje images, reflections of objects from structures of the eye, and the Purkinje shift, the change in the brightness of red and blue colours as light intensity decreases gradually at dusk. Purkyně also introduced the scientific terms plasma (for the component of blood left when the suspended cells have been removed) and protoplasm (the substance found inside cells.)

Purkyně was the first to use a microtome to make thin slices of tissue for microscopic examination and was among the first to use an improved version of the compound microscope. He described the effects of camphor, opium, belladonna and turpentine on humans in 1829. He also experimented with nutmeg that same year, when he &quot;washed down three ground nutmegs with a glass of wine and experienced headaches, nausea, euphoria, and hallucinations that lasted several days&quot;, which remain a good description of today&#x27;s average nutmeg binge. Purkyně discovered sweat glands in 1833 and published a thesis that recognised 9 principal configuration groups of fingerprints in 1823. Purkyně was also the first to describe and illustrate in 1838 the intracytoplasmic pigment neuromelanin in the substantia nigra. He is also credited with the invention of the compressorium, a microscopy accessory to apply controlled pressure to specimens under observation.

Purkyně also recognised the importance of the work of Eadweard Muybridge. Purkyně constructed his own version of a stroboscope which he called &quot;forolyt&quot;. He put nine photos of him shot from various sides to the disc and entertained his grandchildren by showing them how he, an old and famous professor, is turning around at great speed.

==Family and death==
In 1827, at the age of 40, he married Julia Agnes Rudolphi (1800–1835), daughter of his supporter, the Swedish-born German naturalist Karl Asmund Rudolphi (1771–1832). They had two daughters and two sons. His wife and daughters died of cholera in Wrocław, leaving two sons. The older son (1831–1882) became a naturalist, while the younger son Karel (1834–1868) became a painter.

He is buried in the Prague Vyšehrad National Cemetery in Vyšehrad, Prague, in modern-day Czech Republic.

== Legacy ==

The Masaryk University in Brno, Czech Republic, bore his name from 1960 to 1990, as did the standalone military medical academy in Hradec Králové (1994–2004). Today a university in Ústí nad Labem bears his name: Jan Evangelista Purkyně University in Ústí nad Labem (Univerzita Jana Evangelisty Purkyně v Ústí nad Labem.)

The crater Purkyně on the Moon is named after him, as is the asteroid 3701 Purkyně.

<text>John Purcell VC (c. 1814 – 19 September 1857) was an Irish soldier in the British Army who received the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was born at Kilcommon, Oughterard, County Galway.

==Details==
He was about 43 years old, and a private in the 9th Lancers (The Queen&#x27;s Royal), during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place on 19 June 1857 at Delhi, India for which he and Thomas Hancock were awarded the VC:
In a later dispatch from Brigadier-General Hope Grant, C.B. to Major H. W. Norman, Assistant Adjutant-General of the Army, on 10 January 1858, Hope writes:

He was killed in action at Delhi a few weeks later, on 19 September 1857.

<doc id="765225" wikidata="Q17279394" url="?curid=765225" title="Spaghetti House siege">
<text>The Spaghetti House siege took place between 28 September and 3 October 1975. An attempted robbery of the Spaghetti House restaurant in Knightsbridge, London, went wrong and the police were quickly on the scene. The three robbers took the staff down into a storeroom and barricaded themselves in. They released all the hostages unharmed after six days. Two of the gunmen gave themselves up; the ringleader, Franklin Davies, shot himself in the stomach. All three were later imprisoned, as were two of their accomplices.

The three robbers had been involved in black liberation organisations and maintained consistently that they were acting for political reasons. The police did not believe them, and stated that this was a criminal act, not a political one.

The police used fibre optic camera technology for live surveillance, and monitored the actions and conversations of the gunmen from the audio and visual output. The feed was watched by a forensic psychiatrist who advised police on the state of the men&#x27;s minds, and how to best manage the ongoing negotiations.
==Background==
Post-Second World War Britain had a shortage of labour, which led to official policies to attract workers from the British Empire and Commonwealth countries. These people were placed in low-pay, low-skill employment, which forced them to live in poor housing. Economic circumstances and what were seen by many in the black communities as racist policies applied by the British government, led to a rise in militancy, particularly among the West Indian community; their feelings were exacerbated by police harassment and discrimination in the education sector. Ambalavaner Sivanandan, the director of the Institute of Race Relations in the mid-1970s, identifies that while the first generation had become partly assimilated into British society, the second generation were increasingly rebellious.

The ringleader of the attempted robbery of a branch of the Spaghetti House restaurant was Franklin Davies, a 28-year-old Nigerian student who had previously served time in prison for armed robbery; he was accompanied by two men, Wesley Dick (later known as Shujaa Moshesh), a 24-year-old West Indian, and Anthony &quot;Bonsu&quot; Munroe, a 22-year-old Guyanese. All three had been involved in black liberation organisations. Davies had tried to enlist in the guerrilla armies of Zimbabwe African National Union and FRELIMO in Africa; Munroe had links to the Black Power movement; Dick was an attendee at meetings of the Black Panthers, the Black Liberation Front (BLF), the Fasimba, and the Black Unity and Freedom Party; he regularly visited the offices of the Institute of Race Relations to volunteer and access their library. Sivanandan and the historian Rob Waters identify that the three men were attempting to obtain money to &quot;finance black supplementary schools and support African liberation struggles&quot;.

In the mid-1970s the branch managers of the London-based Spaghetti House restaurant chain met every Saturday night at the company&#x27;s Knightsbridge location, after closing their branches at the end of the evening&#x27;s business. The managers deposited their week&#x27;s takings at the Knightsbridge restaurant, before it was paid into a at a nearby bank.

==Attempted robbery: 28 September 1975==
At approximately 1:30 am on Sunday 28 September 1975 Davies, Moshesh and Munroe entered the Knightsbridge branch of the Spaghetti House. One carried a sawn-off shotgun, the others each carried a handgun. The three demanded the week&#x27;s takings from the chain—between £11,000 and £13,000. In the dim lights of the closed restaurant, the staff were able to swiftly hide the two briefcases of money under the tables. The robbers forced the staff down into the basement; the company&#x27;s general manager took the opportunity to escape out of a rear fire escape while they were being moved. He alerted the Metropolitan Police, who arrived on the scene within minutes. The getaway driver, Samuel Addison, saw the plan had gone wrong, and drove off in a stolen Ford. When the police entered the ground floor of the restaurant, Davies and his colleagues forced the staff into a rear storeroom measuring , locked the door, barricaded it with beer kegs and shouted to the police that they would shoot if they approached the door; the police surrounded the building and the siege began.

==Siege: 28 September – 3 October==

In the initial conversations the hostage-takers provided the police with the names of the hostages they held and Davies&#x27;s identity and criminal record was established. By 7:00 am the police had sealed off the area and put a cordon in place; 400 police officers were involved—including dog-handlers—and D11, the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s marksmen, was deployed.

Davies informed police that he was a captain in the BLF, but in a subsequent message said that the men were members of the Black Liberation Army, a Black Panther splinter group. Davies made several demands to the police. He wanted two black prisoners released from prison, although he did not know that they had already been released. He also wanted the Home Secretary to visit the siege, an aircraft made available to fly to the West Indies and a radio for them to listen to the news broadcasts of the situation. Only the request for a radio was granted.

Initially the police considered that the siege may have been a terrorist incident, but were subsequently dismissive of any political motivation, and insisted that it was only ever a criminal action. Sir Robert Mark—the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police at the time of the siege—later wrote:

From the outset it was rightly assumed that this was a simple armed robbery that had gone wrong and any attempts by Davies, the Nigerian, to represent it as a political act were received with the derision they clearly deserved.

Tony Soares, one of the founders of the BLF, told police he knew the three men, and offered to mediate, but his offer was turned down. He added that the BLF was a peaceful organisation, and that it did not know of or support the robbery. Jenny Bourne, the co-editor of &quot;Race &amp; Class&quot;, knew all three men and thinks they &quot;probably had very different motives&quot; for the robbery. Overall she considers the three, particularly Wesley Dick were driven by

the actualities of racism on the ground in Britain ... It was essentially the words of Angela Davis, George Jackson, Bobby Seale and Malcolm X that honed the resistance: &#x27;Seize the time&#x27;, &#x27;Off the pigs&#x27;, &#x27;Fuck the man&#x27; were the themes they transposed to Britain.

On the morning of 29 September—fifteen hours after the siege had begun—one of the hostages was released as a sign of good faith. He was a 59-year-old manager of one of the outlets. On the second day another hostage was released after he fell ill. During the course of the siege Mario Manca, the Italian consul general, attempted to liaise with the men, acting as a go-between. At one stage he offered to change places with one of the hostages who was unwell, but the offer was declined. Lord Pitt, the former chairman of the Greater London Council who was West Indian-born, also attempted to negotiate with the men, but had limited success.

Peter Scott, a forensic psychiatrist at the Maudsley Hospital, gave advice about the mental state of the criminals throughout the siege. He told the police that the longer the siege went on, the more an emotional transference would take place, in which the gunmen would be less likely to kill the hostages. On his advice, the main strategy of the police was to wait as long as was needed, keep the situation calm and to talk to the hostage takers as long as possible. The siege saw an early use of fibre optic camera technology by the police as a live surveillance technique. Two cameras were used to observe what was happening in the basement storeroom. One was threaded through the wall alongside a hot water pipe; the second way was through a vent, after acid was dripped onto the metal vent using an eyedropper, to make a small hole. The police were able to monitor the movement and conversations of the three hostage-takers.

The police persuaded the media to assist them. They asked &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; not to publish a story about the arrest of one of the gang&#x27;s associates. Using the information and advice from Scott, the police attempted to drive a wedge between Davies and his two colleagues. On the fourth day the police pushed a copy of &quot;The Daily Express&quot; under the door of the storeroom. It showed a photograph of Davies on the front page, describing him as the leader, and providing background information from his associates, making it look like the gang&#x27;s associates were selling the information to the newspapers. Across the front page, the police wrote the name of the person suspected of providing the arms. The following day, when two of the co-conspirators were arrested, police briefed the media about the arrests and stressed the criminal, not political, aspects of the case. The men heard the news on the radio that evening, which lowered their spirits. The following morning, the men decided to surrender.

At 2:55 am the gunmen turned out the lights and began a discussion among themselves. At 3:40 am they told the police that they were giving up. After the hostages came out first—all unharmed—the police told the three men to come out one at a time. The first two threw their guns out and followed; as police led them away there was a gunshot from the room, where Davies had shot himself in the stomach with a .22 rimfire revolver. In his pocket police found a note he had written to his brother just before the robbery:

Today I set out on a mission for the people. If things go wrong I shall pass over to the warrior&#x27;s rest. So if this note reaches you, it would mean that I am dead.
You must accept what happens to me as it should be accepted—with joy—because it is the most natural fate that awaits any of us blacks conscious enough to try and do something about our pathetic state of existence.

==Aftermath==
Davies was taken to St George&#x27;s Hospital where he underwent an operation; the bullet was not removed during the process. The hostages were also taken to the same hospital for a check-up, but none needed treatment. They then gave preliminary statements to the police at Cannon Row police station.

While on remand, Davies went on hunger strike. He was visited regularly by Giovanni Scrano, one of the hostages from the siege, who had built up a relationship with Davies during the incident; the relationship was later identified as an example of Stockholm syndrome.

The trial opened on 8 June 1976. As well as Davies, Dick and Munroe, three accomplices were present, charged with different offences, including assisting the robbery (the getaway driver), supplying firearms, and conspiracy charges. Davies, Dick and Munroe refused to accept the legitimacy of the court. When asked how they pleaded to the charges, Davies shouted &quot;We&#x27;ve stopped pleading—we&#x27;ve been pleading for 500 years. This isn&#x27;t a trial—it&#x27;s a lynching party.&quot; The three men turned their backs on the court and talked between themselves. The judge, Mervyn Griffith-Jones, ordered that the three men be taken back to their cells and that a plea of not guilty be entered on their behalf. One of the accomplices, Lillo Termine, pleaded guilty to the charges of conspiracy to rob the restaurant. Police said that he had been the one behind the robbery, and had planned it to pay off gambling debts. The trial ended on 30 June. Davies, Dick and Munroe were sentenced to 22, 18 and 17 years in prison respectively; Termine was given six years. One of the accomplices was acquitted and Addison, the getaway driver, was sent for re-trial as the jury could not reach a verdict. That November, following the second trial, Addison was found guilty and imprisoned for eleven years. Davies, Dick and Munroe died after being released from prison, two of them at relatively young ages; Dick changed his name to Shujaa Moshesh by the time of his death in Africa.

The Spaghetti House restaurant re-opened for business a week after the siege ended. In 2015 the Knightsbridge branch closed for business so the block could be redeveloped.

In early December 1975 members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) were cornered in a flat on Balcombe Street, London, leading to a six-day siege by police. The lessons learned from the Spaghetti House siege, including the use of live surveillance and forensic psychologists, were put into use to bring the siege to a successful conclusion for the police. Peter Waddington, in his study of policing, writes that the police&#x27;s &quot;reputation for restraint received dramatic vindication by the way in which two highly publicised sieges were handled by the Metropolitan Police&quot;. The police used the same tactics at the Iranian Embassy siege in 1980, until the terrorists killed one of the hostages, which led to a change in tactics and the use of the Special Air Service to storm the building. Waddington considers &quot;If there was criticism it was that the police showed an excessive disinclination to resort to force in such circumstances.&quot;

In 1976 Horace Ové, a Trinidadian-born writer and filmmaker, wrote the play &quot;A Hole in Babylon&quot;, based on the events at the restaurant; the play was later broadcast on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Play for Today&quot; series. Another fictionalised account of the crime, &quot;The Siege of Babylon&quot;, was written by Farrukh Dhondy in 1978. In 1982 &quot;Spaghetti House&quot;, an Italian comedy film, was produced which was loosely based on the events of the siege.

<doc id="765226" wikidata="Q172682" url="?curid=765226" title="John Baptist Purcell">
<text>John Baptist Purcell (February 26, 1800 – July 4, 1883) was an American prelate of the Catholic Church. He served as Bishop of Cincinnati from 1833 to his death in 1883, and he was elevated to the rank of archbishop in 1850. He formed the basis of Father Ferrand, the Ohio-based &quot;Irish by birth, French by ancestry&quot; character in the prologue of Willa Cather&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Death Comes for the Archbishop&quot; who goes to Rome asking for a bishop for New Mexico Territory.

==Early life and education==
John Baptist Purcell was born at Mallow, County Cork, Ireland on February 26, 1800, the son of Edward and Johanna Purcell who gave their children all the advantages of the education attainable at a time when the penal laws were less rigorously enforced. Purcell decided to seek higher education in the United States. 
Landing at Baltimore, Maryland, he soon obtained a teacher&#x27;s certificate at Asbury College. He spent a year giving lessons as private tutor in some of the prominent families of Baltimore. His ambition, however, was to become a priest.

On June 20, 1820, he entered Mount St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary, Emmitsburg, Maryland. His knowledge of the classics helped him take charge of important classes in the college, and at the same time prepare himself for the priesthood by the study of philosophy, theology, and other branches of the ecclesiastical curriculum.

After three years&#x27; study in the seminary he received tonsure and minor orders from Archbishop Ambrose Maréchal, of Baltimore, at the close of 1823. On March 1, 1824, in the company of Simon Gabriel Bruté, one of the professors of the seminary, afterwards first Bishop of Vincennes, he sailed for Europe to complete his studies in the Sulpician Seminaries of Issy and Paris. On May 26, 1826, he was one of 300 priests ordained in the Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral by Archbishop de Quelen.

==Career==
After his ordination, Purcell continued his studies until the autumn of 1827, when he returned to the United States to enter Mount St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary as professor. He afterwards became president, until his appointment as Bishop of Cincinnati, Ohio, to succeed Edward Fenwick. Purcell received notice of his appointment in August 1833, and was consecrated bishop in the cathedral of Baltimore, October 13, 1833, by Archbishop James Whitfield. He attended the sessions of the Third Provincial Council of Baltimore, which opened on the day of his consecration and continued for one week.

Going from Baltimore by stage to Wheeling, and from Wheeling to Cincinnati by steamboat, he reached his destination on November 14, 1833. Bishops Benedict Joseph Flaget and John Baptist Mary David of Bardstown, Rese of Detroit, and a few priests met him and conducted him to the cathedral, which was on Sycamore Street. He was canonically installed by Bishop Flaget.

===Founder bishop===
On his arrival in 1833 Bishop Purcell found himself in a city of about 30,000 inhabitants and only one Catholic church. The diocese embraced the whole State of Ohio. The difficulties increased, for soon the tide of immigration turned towards Ohio. Immigrants from Germany and Ireland came in thousands, and as most were Catholics it became his duty to provide for their spiritual needs. A seminary had been founded by Bishop Fenwick in the Athenaeum, which stood near the cathedral, but the number of students was as yet very small. He was untiring in his labour, preaching and giving lectures, writing articles for the &quot;Telegraph&quot;, a Catholic paper founded by Father Young, a nephew of Bishop Fenwick, the first Catholic paper published in the West. He taught classes in the seminary. At his first ordination he raised to the priesthood Henry Damian Juncker, afterwards first Bishop of Alton, Illinois. He lost no time in providing for the wants of the growing Church in Cincinnati. Holy Trinity on Fifth Street, the first church built for the German-speaking Catholics, was soon followed by another, St. Mary&#x27;s, at Clay and Thirteenth Streets.

In order to staff the seminary and school, Purcell invited the Jesuit Fathers, to whom he entrusted St. Xavier&#x27;s Church on Sycamore Street. He purchased a site for his new cathedral on Plum and Eighth Streets, and Western Row (now Central Avenue), then the western boundary of Cincinnati. Bishop Purcell began constructing a structure built of Dayton limestone, with a spire of solid stone rising to the height of 225 feet. Saint Peter in Chains Cathedral became one of the West&#x27;s finest. On October 13, 1846, it was consecrated by Archbishop Samuel Eccleston of Baltimore. After trying several locations for his diocesan seminary, Bishop Purcell finally located it on Price Hill, west of the city limits. The main building was completed in 1851, and named Mount St. Mary&#x27;s of the West, after his own alma mater at Emmitsburg. Bishop Purcell also established two orphan asylums, St. Aloysius&#x27;s for the children of German-speaking parents, and St. Peter&#x27;s (now St. Joseph&#x27;s) for children of English-speakers.

He made a complete visitation of his extensive diocese the first year of his administration, placing resident pastors in parishes or having priests to visit regularly the smaller communities that were unable to support a resident pastor. Bishop Purcell made several trips to Europe, visiting the various seminaries there, and recruiting missionaries for Ohio and points further west. On one trip, Bishop Purcell returned with Fathers Joseph Projectus Machebeuf and Jean-Baptiste Lamy. Father Machebeuf afterward became the first Bishop of Denver; Father Lamy, the first Archbishop of Santa Fé. In addition, pioneer missionary Stephen Badin spent his last years in the care of the cathedral.

==Archbishop==
Cincinnati was made a Metropolitan See in 1850. The pallium was conferred on Archbishop Purcell by Pope Pius IX, who at the same time made him assistant at the pontifical throne. The new ecclesiastical province of Cincinnati had for suffragans the Diocese of Cleveland, Detroit, Vincennes, (became Indianapolis in 1898) and Louisville. In 1851 the city had 13 parishes and 11 parish schools, with an enrollment of 4,494 pupils.

The following religious orders came to the archdiocese during the incumbency of Archbishop Purcell: the Sisters of Charity, founded at Emmitsburg, came to Cincinnati in 1829. In 1852 they formed an independent community, taking the name of the Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati. The Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, Belgium, came from Belgium in 1840. The Precious Blood Fathers came to Ohio in 1840. The Franciscan Fathers came to the diocese in 1844; the Ursuline Sisters, from France and Germany in 1845; the Good Shepherd Sisters in 1857; the Sisters of Mercy in 1858; Little Sisters of the Poor in 1868; Sisters of the Poor of St. Francis in 1858; Ladies of the Sacred Heart in 1869 and the Passionist Fathers in 1870.

In 1869, Archbishop Purcell attended the Council of the Vatican, and in the discussion of Papal Infallibility he took the side of the minority which opposed the opportuneness of the decision.

===Response to Anti-Catholicism===
The Catholic Church was unfavourably viewed by non-Catholics at the time, owing to the spread of anti-Catholic literature. One of the most salient events of his episcopate was a series of religious debates with Alexander Campbell (minister). The discussion was to be taken down by shorthand writers, printed after revision by the disputants, and sold, the net proceeds to be distributed equally among Catholic and Protestant charities.

In 1853, Purcell alienated Cincinnati&#x27;s Protestants by arguing that Catholics should not be taxed to support public schools. Later that year he created controversy when he invited Gaetano Cardinal Bedini, the emissary of Pope Pius IX, to visit Cincinnati. The German Protestant &quot;Forty-Eighters&quot;, who had fled Europe after the failed revolutions of 1848, saw Bedini as a symbol of oppression due to his role in putting down revolution in the Papal States in 1849. They organized a protest march to Purcell&#x27;s residence, where Bedini was staying, on Christmas Day 1853. When the demonstrators clashed with police, several were injured and one died.

===Slavery and the Civil War===
Until 1861, Archbishop Purcell condemned slavery only in the &quot;abstract&quot;, emphasizing the &quot;prudential motives&quot; that made abolition ill-advised, in his opinion. However, according to David J. Endres, &quot;Archbishop John Baptist Purcell of Cincinnati was ...the first American Catholic bishop to offer public support for immediate emancipation of slaves.&quot;

==Later years==
Archbishop Purcell celebrated his golden jubilee of priesthood 26 May 1876. Bishops and archbishops came personally or sent representatives. He had reason to rejoice when he saw the result of his work. When he came to Cincinnati he found a small city with but one church, and a diocese with a few Catholics scattered through the state. After 43 years of toil he found the city grown to a population of nearly 300,000, with 40 well-organized parishes having schools giving Catholic education to 20,000 children, a well-equipped seminary, colleges, and charitable institutions to take care of the poor and sick.

Throughout the diocese were well-organized parishes, churches, and parish schools. Forty years before he had only a few priests; in 1876 he could count on the help of 150 diocesan and 50 regular priests, and a Catholic population of 150,000. In reply to the addresses of congratulation on the occasion, he modestly referred the success to the cordial assistance of the priests and the generous aid of the laity. The serious financial disaster that clouded his last years came as a result of his natural brother and fellow priest, Father Edward Purcell, as well as the long-lasting effects of the Panic of 1873, also known as the Long Depression. Father Purcell took deposits from people who mistrusted banks, which were unstable institutions until the general government adopted national banking regulation. The Cincinnati crash or scandal occurred in the autumn of 1878, shortly after the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 was suppressed. The archbishop died five years later, in St. Martin, Ohio, on July 4, 1883.

After 14 years of litigation and mismanagement of assignees, the affair came to an end when the court found the amount due (with compound interest) from the cathedral and diocesan institutions to be $140,000. Archbishop William Henry Elder, who succeeded Archbishop Purcell, accepted the findings in 1892 and assessed parishes to meet the loans made to pay the judgment, and all the loans were repaid.

<doc id="765228" wikidata="Q680264" url="?curid=765228" title="Demi-glace">
<text>Demi-glace (, &#x27;half glaze&#x27;) is a rich brown sauce in French cuisine used by itself or as a base for other sauces. The term comes from the French word &quot;glace&quot;, which, when used in reference to a sauce, means &quot;icing&quot; or &quot;glaze.&quot; It is traditionally made by combining one part espagnole sauce and one part brown stock. The sauce is then reduced by half, strained of any leftover impurities, and finished with a sherry wine.

Common variants of demi-glace use a 1:1 mixture of beef or chicken stock to sauce espagnole; these are referred to as &quot;beef demi-glace&quot; (&quot;demi-glace au bœuf&quot;) or &quot;chicken demi-glace&quot; (&quot;demi-glace au poulet&quot;). 

== Preparation ==

Due to the considerable effort involved in making the traditional demi-glace, chefs commonly substitute a simple &quot;jus lié&quot; of veal stock or to create a simulated version, which the American cookbook author Julia Child referred to as a &quot;semi-demi-glace&quot; (i.e. sans espagnole sauce).

<doc id="765234" wikidata="Q268755" url="?curid=765234" title="Patricia A. McKillip">
<text>Patricia Anne McKillip (February 29, 1948 – May 6, 2022) was an American author of fantasy and science fiction. She wrote predominantly standalone fantasy novels and has been called &quot;one of the most accomplished prose stylists in the fantasy genre&quot;. Her work won many awards, including the World Fantasy Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2008.

==Personal life==
McKillip was born in Salem, Oregon to Wayne and Helen ( Roth) McKillip. She grew up in Oregon, Great Britain, and Germany. She attended the College of Notre Dame (Belmont, California) and San Jose State University (San Jose, California), where she earned her BA and MA degrees in English in the early 1970s. 

McKillip was married to David Lunde, a poet.
She died on May 6, 2022, at the age of 74 at her home in Coos Bay, Oregon.

==Career==
McKillip&#x27;s first publications were two short children&#x27;s books, &quot;The Throme of the Erril of Sherill&quot; and &quot;The House on Parchment Street&quot;. Her first novel, &quot;The Forgotten Beasts of Eld&quot;, was published in 1974, when she was 26 years old, and won the World Fantasy Award in 1975. She next wrote the &quot;Riddle-Master&quot; trilogy (1976–1979), which scholar Peter Nicholls described as &quot;a work of classic stature&quot;. It was selected as part of Gollancz&#x27;s Fantasy Masterworks series.

Since 1994, McKillip&#x27;s writing comprised mostly standalone novels. Most of her novels feature cover paintings by Kinuko Y. Craft. On writing fantasy, she said, &quot;The tropes of mythology and symbolism are the basics. It&#x27;s like a notation in music; you can change it in really wacky ways, but the sound is always the same, the sound is always there. As long as we need these symbols, then the stories will be written. But if we destroy the old symbols, then we might just have to come up with new ones—who knows?&quot; Critic Brian Stableford described McKillip as &quot;one of the most accomplished prose stylists in the fantasy genre&quot;, while Nicholls and John Clute considered her &quot;perhaps the most impressive author of fantasy story still active&quot;.

McKillip was the Guest of Honor at the 1985 Mythcon and the 1999 World Fantasy Convention, and in 2005 the &quot;Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts&quot; published a special issue on her work. She received the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 2008.

==Awards==
McKillip holds the record for the most Mythopoeic Fantasy Awards (four) and nominations (fifteen). She has also won World Fantasy Awards for Best Novel, as well as for Life Achievement.

<doc id="765239" wikidata="Q1988511" url="?curid=765239" title="Russian submarine Delfin">
<text>Delfin () was the first combat-capable Russian submarine. It was laid down in July 1901 by the Baltic Works in Saint Petersburg, added to the Imperial Russian Navy list in September 1902, and launched in May 1903 before beginning sea trials in the Gulf of Finland in June 1903. The trials were finished in October of that year and the submarine entered service, initially designated as a torpedo boat. During its construction it was initially named &quot;No. 113&quot;, which was later changed to &quot;No. 150&quot;, before finally receiving the name &quot;Delfin&quot; on 13 June 1904. The submarine&#x27;s armament included two Drzewiecki drop collars on the outside of the submarine, each holding one torpedo, and a single machine gun. 

It was first used as a training boat for new submariners as the Russian Navy decided to expand its submarine fleet and started preparing their crews before new vessels were completed. Despite being considered a success &quot;Delfin&quot; suffered two serious accidents early on in its career, a sinking in June 1904 and a large explosion in May 1905, with loss of life among the crew in both cases. &quot;Delfin&quot; was sent to the Pacific during the Russo-Japanese War and patrolled the coastal area near Vladivostok in the first half of 1905 to deter Japanese attacks. After the war it was used as a training boat for officers and crew and remained in the Russian Far East until the spring of 1916.

The final assignment of the submarine was serving in the role of coastal defense off Kola Bay after being transferred to the Arctic Ocean Flotilla. It was damaged in a storm and eventually struck from the navy list in August 1917. &quot;Delfin&quot; was scrapped in 1932.

==Background==

In the 19th century the Imperial Russian Navy had been among the European navies that took interest in developing submarines and several experimental underwater craft were built by Russia during that time, with the earliest dating back to the reign of Peter the Great. Although not all of these projects were successful, they allowed the Russian Navy to get an understanding submarine design and construction. The interest in submarine development continued by the turn of the century, and on 19 December 1900 a submarine committee was founded within the Naval Technological Committee (MTK), led by the engineer Ivan Bubnov, who would be responsible for the design of most tsarist submarines up until the Russian Revolution of 1917. The other members of the organization were engineer Ivan Goryunov and the officer Mikhail Beklemishev. The submarine committee was tasked with studying foreign designs as preparation for designing and constructing a combat submarine for the Russian Navy.

==Design and construction==

On 16 June 1901 the Russian submarine designers led by Ivan Bubnov presented a proposal to the Naval Technological Committee which was a version of John P. Holland boats with modifications made by Bubnov. This design would become the &quot;Delfin&quot;. Bubnov&#x27;s changes included changing the position of the ballast tanks and replacing internal torpedo tubes with Drzewiecki drop collars which held torpedoes on the outside of the boat. The proposal was quickly approved and the submarine, designated as torpedo boat &quot;No. 113&quot;, was laid down on 5 July 1901 at the Baltic Works in Saint Petersburg. It was labeled a torpedo boat by the Russian Navy because there were no commissioned submarines in the fleet up to this point. 

The submarine that was later renamed &quot;Delfin&quot; had a single hull, the outside of which was covered with teak as protection in case of grounding, and saddle tanks. Its propulsion was provided by two gasoline engines for moving on the surface and by one electric motor to move the boat underwater, giving power to the one propeller shaft. An engineer involved with the project, Ivan Goryunov, proposed equipping it with diesel engines, but there were limitations on their production and ultimately gasoline engines were used instead. This gave it a speed of while surfaced and while submerged, along with a total range of surfaced and submerged. 

The submarine was rated to a depth of . &quot;Delfin&quot; had a displacement of 113 tons on the surface and 126 tons while underwater, and a crew of 12 officers and men. Its length was , its beam was , and its draft was . &quot;Delfin&quot;″s armament consisted of one machine gun and two torpedoes, each carried in a Drzewiecki drop collar. 

It was added to the navy list on 27 September 1902 as &quot;No. 150&quot; and that same year the first crew members began to be gathered. The submarine was launched in May 1903 and the sea trials began the following month on 21 June in the Gulf of Finland. They were a success, although they also showed that it had a diving time of 12 minutes. The time to reach periscope depth was later reduced to five minutes. The submarine was inspected by Emperor Nicholas II and other officials on the Neva river in late August 1903. The trials were completed on 14 October, which is considered to be the founding date of the Russian submarine fleet. &quot;No. 150&quot; became the first combat submarine in the Russian Navy, though it continued to be classified as a &quot;torpedo boat&quot; until March 1906. After finishing the trials &quot;No. 150&quot; returned to the Baltic Works where it underwent some modifications, including the installation of a latrine for the crew.

==Service history==

Lieutenant Mikhail Beklemishev, who worked on the construction of the submarine, became its first commanding officer and selected the crew from among volunteers who were mechanically inclined, had served well, and did not smoke. After the start of the Russo-Japanese War in early 1904 it was used as a training boat for new submariners. The Russian Navy decided to build more submarines based on the success of &quot;No. 150&quot; and in December 1903 approved a design by Ivan Bubnov and Beklemishev for a larger submarine class, which became the . &quot;No. 150&quot; was used to train the crews for the new vessels even before they were finished and on 13 June 1904 its name was changed to &quot;Delfin&quot;.

An incident occurred on 29 June 1904 when &quot;Delfin&quot; performed a training dive along a wall at the Baltic Works. At the time there were 34 people on board, with many of them being submariner trainees. Beklemishev was not there and the acting captain was Lieutenant Anatoly Cherkasov. The design of the submarine required the use of the main hatch to remove air from the ballast tanks, which was then to be closed at the last moment. On that occasion Cherkasov waited too long to close the hatch and water started leaking into the submarine, causing one of the other sailors to panic and try to rush out of the hatch, which only increased the flow of water. This caused the boat to sink, and although two officers and eight sailors were able to eventually get out and swim to the surface the other 24 men died, including Cherkasov. Two days later &quot;Delfin&quot; was raised and sent to the Baltic Works for repairs. The sailors and officers who died were given a burial at the Smolensky Cemetery in Saint Petersburg. The survivors all chose to remain in the submarine service.
&quot;Delfin&quot; was later assigned to the squadron in the Russian Far East for service in the ongoing Russo-Japanese War. It was taken by railroad to Vladivostok, arriving on 7 October 1904. The submarine carried out its first war patrol in February 1905 and went on several more over the course of that year. &quot;Delfin&quot; and the other 12 Russian submarines that were active during the war operated within 150 nautical miles of their home base and their main purpose was to use their presence to deter a Japanese attack on Vladivostok.

A second incident happened on 5 May 1905. The gasoline tanks were being ventilated as part of a process to fix a problem with one of its other components, but while this was going on a spark from one of the crewmen on board turning on a light caused an explosion in the submarine. Two of the three men aboard at the time died and another explosion after that caused the submarine to sink. It was later lifted to the surface and underwent extensive repairs. &quot;Delfin&quot; reentered service in June. After being returned to service the boat was once again used for crew and officer training and spent over a decade stationed in the Far East, being part of the submarine unit of the Siberian Flotilla in Vladivostok. On 9 December 1914 &quot;Delfin&quot; suffered another explosion, while its electric batteries were being charged.

&quot;Delfin&quot; was one of the eight submarines of the Siberian Flotilla at the outbreak of World War I. In February 1916, &quot;Delfin&quot; was transferred from its base in Vladivostok to the Arctic Ocean Flotilla in Arkhangelsk, being moved first by railroad and later by the Northern Dvina river. At its new assignment the submarine was used for coastal defense off Kola Bay. After being damaged in a storm a decision was made not to restore it, and in August 1917 it was struck from the navy list. According to one source &quot;Delfin&quot; may have sunk in Murmansk on 5 September 1917. If that is the case, it was later raised, and may have been used as part of ship recovery equipment before being scrapped in 1932. In the 1920s the commander of the Baltic Fleet submarine division, Yakov Zubarev, proposed that &quot;Delfin&quot; be preserved as a monument due to its role as the first Russian combat submarine, but this was not done.

<text>Lewis Burwell Puller Jr. (August 18, 1945 – May 11, 1994) was an attorney and a United States Marine Corps officer who was severely wounded in the Vietnam War. He won the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography for his autobiography &quot;Fortunate Son&quot;.

==Life and career==
Lewis Burwell Puller Jr. was the son of Lt. General Lewis &quot;Chesty&quot; Puller, the most decorated Marine in the history of the U.S. Marine Corps. He followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and became a Marine officer.

Puller graduated from the Christchurch School, in Christchurch, Virginia, in 1963 and from the College of William and Mary in 1967. After his graduation from Officer Candidate School, he received orders to South Vietnam in July 1968, where he served as an Infantry Platoon Leader for three months in 1st Marine Division. On October 11, 1968, his rifle jammed during an engagement with North Vietnamese troops; Puller was wounded when he tripped a booby-trapped howitzer round, losing his right leg at the hip, his left leg to above the knee, his left hand and most of his fingers on his right hand in the explosion.

The shell riddled his body with shrapnel, and he lingered near death for days with his weight dropping to 55 pounds, but he survived. Puller later recalled the first time his father saw him in the hospital. He described how his father broke down weeping and that hurt him more than any of his physical injuries. Those who knew him say that it was primarily because of his iron will and his stubborn refusal to die that he survived. He was medically discharged from the Marine Corps. He was awarded the Silver Star Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, two Purple Heart Medals, and the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross for his service in the Marine Corps.

For years after he returned to a reasonably sound physical condition, he remained emotionally shaken, though he earned a Juris Doctor degree, had two children with the woman he had married before going to Vietnam, and raised a family. He was admitted to the Virginia Bar in 1974 and began working as a lawyer for the Veteran&#x27;s Administration and on President Gerald Ford&#x27;s clemency board. He mounted a campaign for Congress in 1978 as a Democrat in Virginia but lost in a landslide with only 28% of the vote against incumbent Republican Congressman Paul Trible. Throughout the years, he battled periods of despondency and drank heavily until 1981, when he underwent treatment for alcoholism. Despite that treatment, Puller continued to suffer severe depression and occasional bouts of alcoholism.

Puller told the story of his ordeal and its aftermath in his 1991 autobiography, &quot;Fortunate Son: The Autobiography of Lewis B. Puller Jr.&quot;, published by Grove Press.
The account ended with Puller triumphing over his physical disabilities and becoming emotionally at peace with himself. The following year he won the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. The title of this autobiography was borrowed from the song &quot;Fortunate Son&quot; by Creedence Clearwater Revival, to which he gives credit in the opening pages.

According to friends and associates, Puller spent the last months of his life in turmoil. He left his job as a lawyer at the Pentagon to accept a teaching position at George Mason University. In the days leading up to his death, Puller fought a losing battle with the alcoholism that he had kept at bay for 13 years, and struggled with a more recent addiction, to painkillers initially prescribed to dull continuing pain from his wounds.

==Death and aftermath==
Puller died from a self-inflicted gunshot on May 11, 1994. He was survived by his wife, Linda T. &quot;Toddy&quot; Puller, from whom he had separated in 1991. Puller&#x27;s survivors included his two children, Lewis III and Maggie; his twin sister, Martha Downs; and sister, Virginia Dabney.

Puller&#x27;s name is not listed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, which is reserved for those who died or who are listed as missing in action. However, his name is listed on the nearby In Memory Memorial Plaque, which represents those veterans, like Puller, who &quot;died after their service in the Vietnam war, but as a direct result of that service, and whose names are not otherwise eligible for placement on the memorial wall.&quot;

Terry Anderson, a former Associated Press journalist, who was held hostage in Lebanon, recalled the same hope he had had for his friend, Puller. &quot;This is a man who had so many burdens, so many things to bear. And he bore them well for 25 years,&quot; he said. &quot;What did I miss?&quot; Anderson asked. &quot;I was his friend. I thought he was winning&quot;.

Kiều Chinh, an actress who was a refugee after the fall of Saigon and who worked with Puller on his last project, an effort to build a school in Quảng Trị, said: &quot;Lewis Puller never stop fighting the war of healing... to heal not only his own wounds but the common wounds of the two nations.&quot;

In a statement, Puller&#x27;s wife, Toddy said, &quot;Our family has been moved and humbled by the outpouring of affection for Lewis. The many acts of kindness from our friends across the country have helped us in this very difficult time. It is clear that Lewis affected the lives of people in ways that we never knew.&quot; Of her deceased husband, she said, &quot;To the list of names of victims of the Vietnam War, add the name of Lewis Puller ... He suffered terrible wounds that never really healed&quot;. In 1991, she was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates.

On Veterans Day 2010, the Lewis B. Puller Jr. Veterans Benefits Clinic at The College of William &amp; Mary Law School was named in honor of Puller.

== Awards ==
During his military career, Puller earned the following:

===Silver Star citation===
Citation:
The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Second Lieutenant Lewis Burwell Puller, Jr. (MCSN: 0-105622), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as a Platoon Commander with Company G, Second Battalion, First Marines, FIRST Marine Division (Rein.), FMF, in connection with combat operations against insurgent communist (Viet Cong) forces in the Republic of Vietnam. On the morning of 11 October 1968, elements of Company G were helicopter lifted into an area near Viem Dong in Quang Nam Province in order to establish a blocking position for a search and destroy operation inside the village. Upon being inserted into the designated area, Second Lieutenant Puller expeditiously reorganized and deployed his men into advantageous positions. Then, completely disregarding the danger of being ambushed by enemy forces, he boldly led elements of his platoon across hazardous terrain in order to quickly establish contact with the company commander and coordinate his efforts with the remainder of the company. As he neared the command group, he inadvertently detonated a large enemy mine and fell seriously wounded. Ignoring the intense pain of his injuries as he received medical treatment, he calmly and effectively continued to direct the efforts of his unit. Directing another Marine to assume command, Second Lieutenant Puller gave him detailed instructions to ensure that he continued the assigned mission. Sincerely concerned for the welfare of his comrades, he remained alert and spoke words of encouragement to his litter bearers while being carried to the landing zone where he was medically evacuated. His resolute determination and composure under extremely hazardous conditions inspired all who observed him and contributed materially to his unit&#x27;s ability to continue its mission. By his courage, aggressive leadership and unfaltering devotion to duty, Second Lieutenant Puller upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and of the United States Naval Service.

<text>Shawn Lane (March 21, 1963 – September 26, 2003) was an American musician who released two studio albums and collaborated with a variety of musicians including Ringo Starr, Kris Kristofferson, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Reggie Young, Joe Walsh, Jonas Hellborg, Anders Johansson, Jens Johansson and many others. After studying the piano, he learned to play the guitar, which he played with exceptional speed.

==Early life==
Born in Memphis, Tennessee, Lane began playing piano with his sisters at the age of eight, but did not play guitar seriously until he was ten. At age 12–13 he began to practice heavily. At fourteen, he became the lead guitarist for Black Oak Arkansas (BOA), and alongside members including drummer Tommy Aldridge, toured over the next four years opening shows for bands including REO Speedwagon, Ted Nugent, Outlaws, Cheap Trick, Molly Hatchet and Blue Öyster Cult. During 1979 Shawn played in The Streets, recording studio demos with Andy Tanas on bass, Chris Craig on drums and Jimmy Henderson on guitar.

At age fifteen Lane saw Allan Holdsworth play guitar with the progressive band U.K., which inspired him to develop his own style of playing guitar. Lane also played in Savage Innocence with singer Jim &quot;Dandy&quot; Mangrum, keyboardist Billy Batte, drummer Chris Craig and bassist Kinley Wolfe who then played with The Cult. As the original members dropped out, Lane replaced them with players from his high school days. Lane began to play a style close to jazz fusion. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Lane played in The Willys, a band consisting of singer/keyboardist Sam Bryant, singer/bassist Rob Caudill and his brother, drummer Russ Caudill. The Caudill brothers had played in The Breaks with Susanne Jerome-Taylor. Lane also performed in the fusion band Out of Bounds, with Barry Bays and DeGarmo and Key drummer Chuck Reynolds.

==Adulthood and piano==
From age eighteen to twenty-six, Lane studied music, composed music, and played piano. In 1983 he became a father to a daughter named Ashley. Much of the material on Lane&#x27;s first studio album, &quot;Powers of Ten&quot;, was written on his home piano. He quickly developed his technique on the keyboard as well, taking influence from pianists such as Franz Liszt, Art Tatum and Georges Cziffra.

His demo tapes led Shawn to be sought out by Jim Ed Norman and a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records. Except for one cover song, Lane wrote all the material and played all the instruments on his debut album. The album sold well and earned several magazine awards. Following its release in 1992, &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine named him &quot;Best New Talent&quot; and &quot;Keyboard Magazine&quot; placed him second in the &quot;Best Keyboard Player&quot; category. During the production of the album, Lane continued to play live shows and do session work. On September 19, 1992, Lane played in &quot;Guitar Player Magazine&#x27;s&quot; 25th anniversary concert at Warfield Theatre, San Francisco alongside Steve Morse, John Lee Hooker, Dick Dale, Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter, Adrian Belew, Ry Cooder and others. He also performed on the Mark Varney Project&#x27;s &quot;Centrifugal Funk&quot; album along with Brett Garsed, Frank Gambale, Jimmy Earl, T. J. Helmerich. To promote his album, he formed The Powers of Ten band with Barry Bays on bass, keyboardist Doug Scarborough, Todd Bobo on saxophone and drummer Sean Rickman; they opened for Robben Ford&#x27;s US tour.

Lane released two more solo albums following his debut, &quot;Powers of Ten; Live!&quot;, recorded live in 1993, and &quot;The Tri-Tone Fascination&quot; in 1999.

==Collaborations==

During 1994 Lane met bassist Jonas Hellborg. Lane and Hellborg played with drummer Jeff Sipe in Hellborg, Lane, Sipe. Between 1994 and 1995, Lane played with D.D.T., a band consisting of Paul Taylor, Luther Dickinson, and Cody Dickinson; the latter three then formed the North Mississippi Allstars. Lane developed curricula and taught at several European conservatories, including the American Institute of Music in Vienna with Joey Tafolla and Milan Polak . He also wrote columns for &quot;Young Guitar Magazine&quot; in Japan which were published between February 1995 and 1996. During 1996 he also wrote columns for &quot;Guitar for the Practicing Musician&quot; in their Over the Top series. He engineered and co-produced the album &quot;Red Reign&quot; by Steven Patrick of Holy Soldier.

In September 1995, Hellborg, Lane, and drummer Anders Johansson played with Chinese pop singer Wei Wei and the trio appeared as an opening act at Chinese venues. Lane played the Warsaw Summer Jazz Days festival on June 19, 1998, with Hellborg and Félix Sabal Lecco. In 1998 he played the guitar solo on Bang a Drum featuring Jon Bon Jovi and Chris LeDoux, reaching number 68 on Hot Country Songs. During May 1999 he played with drummer Steve Ferrone at the Disma Music show, Rimini, Italy. Later, he and Hellborg formed an east–west fusion band with Indian musicians V. Selvaganesh and V. Umamahesh. On April 19, 2002, HLS opened for guitarist John Scofield at the Variety Playhouse, Atlanta. While in Memphis, Lane played with the Time Bandits, with singer Regina Parker, steel guitarist Tony Sutton, drummer Steve Sutton, and bassist Adam Sutton.

In February 2003, Lane and Hellborg toured India with drummer Andrea Marchesini, playing the Great Indian Rock Festival, Hamsadhwani Theatre, Pragati Maiden, New Delhi. Lane played the Swedish Jazz Celebration Festival, Stockholm, on March 29, 2003, with Hellborg, V. Umamahesh, V. Umashankar and Ramakrishnan. His last concert was at Smilefest in North Carolina with Hellborg and Jim Britt on May 31, 2003.

The Shawn Lane Memorial Concert was held on August 28, 2005, at the New Daisy Theatre in Memphis, Tennessee, celebrating the life and music of Shawn Lane with Andy Timmons, Jimi Jamison, Lord Tracy, Craig Erickson, Kevin Paige, FreeWorld, and Jim &quot;Dandy&quot; Mangrum.

==Influences==
Lane was influenced by many other artists but an important one was Pakistani musician Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Called &quot;the King of Kings of Qawwali&quot; and popular in Pakistan, India and Southern Asia, Khan fascinated Lane with his wide vocal range and the intertwining of his voice and the instrument. Lane was also a lover of great paintings and often spent free time on the road visiting museums. His favorite painter was Johannes Vermeer.

==Health and death==
Lane had psoriasis throughout his life. After age twelve, he also suffered from psoriatic arthritis, which caused stiffness in his joints and after 2000 was affecting his ability to play guitar (Lane stated that with proper rest he could still play live gigs, etc.). Lane had treated his psoriasis with hydrocortisone for many years, which caused his weight to increase, further loading his joints. The required usage of cortisone over time resulted in him having Cushing&#x27;s syndrome. Consequently, he backed off taking cortisone, but then the psoriasis would flare up, and he would need prescription pain killers to deal with the unremitting pain. The symptoms of his condition and the side effects of the medications created a vicious circle. Complicating matters, for many years Lane did not have medical insurance coverage. In 2003 he started having difficulty breathing and was told that he would have to remain on medical oxygen for the rest of his life.

Lane died in a hospital in Memphis on September 26, 2003, of lung-related illnesses.

==Legacy==
Although not a familiar name outside musicians&#x27; circles, guitar virtuosos such as Rusty Cooley, Michael Romeo, Alex Masi, Guthrie Govan, Buckethead, Paul Gilbert – who called Lane &quot;the most terrifying guy of all time&quot; during a guitar clinic when asked about his thoughts on Lane&#x27;s guitar playing skills – and many others regard Lane&#x27;s work highly. In 2008, &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;Few, if any, guitarists can play faster than Lane could, and his arpeggio sweeps and precision-picked lines blasted more rapid-fire notes than the average human mind could comprehend.&quot;

<text>GameStar is a monthly-released PC gaming magazine in Germany. It is the best-selling German-language magazine focused on PC gaming and it also hosts the largest video gaming-related portal in the German-speaking internet.

&quot;GameStar.de&quot; is the largest PC gaming web portal in the German-speaking internet and one of the largest web portals in the entirety of the German-speaking internet. The magazine also comes with a DVD, which features Demos, Mods, video-reviews as well as a full retail version of a videogame.

== Content ==
&quot;GameStar&quot; has been in published in various versions with different features. This includes the magazine version (which does not include any DVDs and is thus cheaper), a &quot;normal&quot; edition, which includes one DVD, and a XL Version, which contains 2 DVDs. The magazine for subscribers has less advertisement and shows a larger front-page picture. Until mid-2005 a CD-only version was also available, but it was decided that DVD-readers in Computers had become widespread enough, and so the CD-version was deemed unnecessary. Instead the XL version appeared for the first time.

&quot;GameStar&quot; also hosts a large internet forum, the GSPB (GameStar Pinboard). It is one of largest internet forums in the German-speaking internet.

== History and editorship ==
&quot;GameStar&quot; was founded by Charles Glimm, Jörg Langer und Toni Schwaiger with the IDG Entertainment Media GmbH as publisher and debuted in September 1997, with Jörg Langer as editor-in-chief.

The new magazine soon gained a lot of popularity. By the fourth quarter of 1999 it sold about 333,000 issues per month, in 2000 it overtook competitor PC Games as the largest German language videogames magazine in Europe.

IDG also started &quot;GameStar&quot; sister magazines in Italy, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and the United States. The US version was, quite differently from the rest, positioned as a magazine for adults, about PC and console games, similar to inCite. However they all folded after a few months due to disappointing sales. The only long term launch was achieved in Hungary. In 2005, &quot;GameStar&quot; spawned a sister magazine called &quot;/GameStar/dev&quot; which is targeted at European Game Developers. &quot;GameStar&quot; also has a sister magazine named &quot;GamePro&quot;, which focuses on console games. Incidentally its headquarters are right next-door to the &quot;GameStar&quot; office.

In April 2015 &quot;GameStar&quot; and its sister magazine &quot;GamePro&quot; were sold by IDG to the French publisher Webedia.

Jörg Langer was succeeded by Gunnar Lott as editor-in-chief, followed by Michael Trier on 1 December 2007. As of June 2016, editor-in-Chief is Heiko Klinge.

&quot;GameStar&quot; also held a popular known E-Sports-League, the &quot;GameStar Clanliga&quot;, featuring games such a &quot;Warcraft III&quot;, &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; as well as &quot;Tactical Ops&quot;.

== Sales and popularity ==
After it launched, &quot;GameStar&quot; was able to steadily gain in popularity. By the fourth quarter of 1999, it had sold about 331.535 issues per month and in 2000 it overtook its competitor &quot;PC Games&quot; as the largest German-language PC game magazine in Europe. Since then, &quot;GameStar&quot; has kept the spot as the best-selling German-language PC gaming-focused magazine in Europe.

Like the whole print market, &quot;GameStar&quot; was affected by diminishing sales. In 2008, the average monthly circulation was 250,000 copies, but by January 2015 sold issues per month had dropped to 63,189. Despite the drop, &quot;GameStar&quot; remains the highest-selling German -language PC gaming-focused magazine in Europe.
