<text>The 1985 Manchester Airport disaster occurred when British Airtours Flight 28M (officially known as Flight 328), an international passenger flight, was en route from Manchester Airport to Corfu International Airport. It caught fire on takeoff on 22 August 1985, resulting in 55 fatalities.

The aircraft, a Boeing 737-236(A), named &quot;River Orrin&quot;, was flown by British Airtours, a wholly owned subsidiary of British Airways. It had 131 passengers and six crew on the manifest. During the takeoff roll, a loud thump was heard, and takeoff was aborted. An engine failure had generated a fire and the captain ordered evacuation. The engine failure was later traced to an incorrectly repaired combustor, causing the turbine disc to shatter and puncture the wing fuel tanks. Most of the deaths were due to smoke inhalation, not burns; 82 people survived.

The accident was described as &quot;a defining moment in the history of civil aviation safety.&quot; It brought about industry-wide changes to the seating layout near emergency exits, fire-resistant seat covers, floor lighting, fire-resistant wall and ceiling panels, more fire extinguishers and clearer evacuation rules.

== Aircraft ==
The aircraft involved was a Boeing 737-236(A), registered as G-BGJL with serial number 743. It was manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes in April 1981 and was powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-15A engines. It had logged 12977 airframe hours in 5907 takeoff and landing cycles.

== Accident ==

===Attempted takeoff===

The flight crew, Captain Peter Terrington (39), and First Officer Brian Love (52), were seasoned pilots with 8,441 and 12,277 flight hours (including 1,276 and 345 hours on the Boeing 737), respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAIB_8/88&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At 07:13 BST (06:13 UTC), on runway 24 at Manchester International Airport during the takeoff phase, the pilots heard a loud thump coming from underneath the plane. Thinking a tyre had burst, the captain ordered an abandoned takeoff and then activated the thrust reversers. The first officer, who was in control of the aircraft at the time, applied &quot;harsh&quot; braking for about five seconds. The captain, concerned about a burst tyre, instructed the first officer to use less wheel braking, which was done. Fire warnings sounded in the flight deck nine seconds after the thump was heard (about 36 seconds before the aircraft stopped). Ten seconds later, the tower controller confirmed, &quot;right, there&#x27;s a lot of fire.&quot; Twenty-five seconds after the thud was heard (about 20 seconds before the aircraft stopped), the tower controller suggested evacuating passengers to the right side. The tower controller activated the airport&#x27;s fire-alarm siren the moment he first saw smoke coming from the aircraft, but firefighters working for the airport&#x27;s fire service had heard a &quot;bang&quot; and seen the smoke and fire for themselves, and had already initiated a response on their own.

===Forward evacuation===

The aircraft turned off the runway onto a short taxiway called link &quot;D&quot; and came to a full stop facing northwest. Evacuation efforts began immediately, but several difficulties were encountered. Arthur Bradbury, the purser and the crew&#x27;s senior flight attendant, tried to open the right front exit door about 10 seconds before the aircraft stopped, but it jammed due to a design fault in the emergency slide system and he abandoned attempts to open it. After about 25 seconds, Bradbury opened the left front door and successfully deployed the escape slide. At this time, the first two fire engines arrived. One began showering the fuselage and the open door with foam to prevent the fire from spreading to the door and the slide as passengers were evacuating, and to provide cooling to protect the passengers still inside.

When the second fire engine arrived, the first concentrated on the burning jet fuel and the left engine. The second sprayed foam over the fuselage and the open door. During this time, the &quot;No. 4 stewardess&quot;, Joanna Toff, had kept passengers out of the forward galley area to allow the purser time to open a door. When the left side door was opened, exiting passengers jammed themselves in the narrow passageway between the two forward galley bulkheads. Toff bodily pulled the passengers out one at a time until she cleared the jam. Meanwhile, the purser had resumed working on the right front door, and he successfully opened the door fully and deployed the escape slide about one minute after the plane had stopped. Sixteen passengers and Toff escaped through the left front door, one of whom was dragged out by Toff while unconscious. The purser and 34 passengers made their escape through the right front door.

===Overwing evacuation===

More difficulties were encountered at the overwing exits. The left overwing exit was blocked by smoke and flames. The passenger seated at the right overwing exit had difficulty understanding how to operate the hatch. At that time, no requirement existed that exit-row passengers receive a briefing on how and when to open the hatch. Once the hatch was released, it fell inward onto the passenger seated next to it, trapping her. Two passengers lifted the hatch and put it on a seat in the next row back, making the exit available for use 45 seconds after the aircraft had stopped. Once the hatch had been removed, passengers still encountered difficulties in getting to and using this exit. The exit-row seats allowed only to pass through, the armrests between those seats remained down, and the exit was directly over a seat, requiring passengers to manoeuvre awkwardly to escape. Passengers in the rear of the aircraft were panicking as smoke, and eventually flames, filled the hot cabin at about the same time the right overwing exit was opened. Passengers crawled over seat backs to get to the right overwing exit as well as the two front exits; some survivors told investigators that the aisle had become blocked with bodies.

This caused jamming at all exits, and the seat over which the overwing exit was located failed in such a way that the seat back collapsed forward, causing a further obstruction. A man who had been seated in 16C was found dead lying across this exit, and investigators were unsure whether the seat back collapse had trapped him. A 14-year-old boy was found lying across the top of the man from seat 16C by firefighters 5 minutes after the aircraft had stopped. He was alive, suffering only superficial burns to his hands. He was the last of 27 survivors to escape through that exit, and the last evacuee to survive the accident. Most of the 38 bodies were found clustered around the overwing exit. This exit was the first exit available to the 76 passengers seated behind it or even with it, and the nearest exit for 100 passengers.

===Fire and loss of aft exits===

Fuel had been spilling from the left wing from the moment the first loud noise was heard. That fuel had ignited on contact with flames from the hole in the engine combustion chamber as the aircraft began to decelerate on the runway. When the aircraft stopped, fuel was still leaking from a opening at a rate of per minute (, ), feeding a growing fire. By about this time, the fire had already penetrated the aluminium alloy skin of the aircraft below the level of the floor in the passenger compartment. The AAIB estimated that between fiveseconds before and 13seconds after the aircraft stopped were needed for fire to penetrate the fuselage skin. Passengers seated on the left side of the aisle and toward the rear felt intense radiant heat from the fire, and were very impatient to escape, many of them standing and crowding into the aisles while the aircraft was in motion.

As the aircraft began its right turn off the runway, around tenseconds before it stopped, one of the two flight attendants in the rear of the aircraft, probably the No 3 stewardess, opened the right rear door and deployed the emergency chute, but no one escaped through this door because it was blocked by smoke and flames. When the aircraft came to a stop, it was facing the northwest, and a light wind of was blowing from the west, carrying dense smoke, and occasionally flames, in through that door. When the door was first opened, the aircraft had been facing into the wind, and the exit had been clear. When the left front door was opened, this created an airflow from the front of the aircraft to the rear, and out through the right rear door, which likely contained the smoke to the rear of the aircraft. When the right overwing exit and the right front exit were opened, this flow was lost, and the entire cabin rapidly filled with smoke. The left rear exit remained closed.

Fire penetrated into the rear portion of the passenger cabin through the floor and along the left wall within oneminute of the aircraft stopping. Accident investigators said that this quick penetration of fire into the cabin appeared &quot;to conflict markedly with the air transport industry&#x27;s expectations&quot; for this type of fire, which at that time expected one to threeminutes would be available for evacuation before the fire would be &quot;in a position to directly threaten the occupants&quot;.

When firefighters determined that no more passengers would leave the aircraft unassisted, they entered the passenger cabin with fire hoses and attempted to extinguish the blaze inside the aircraft, but fighting the fire inside the aircraft had become futile and unsafe. One firefighter was slightly injured when an explosion threw him out of the door and down to the tarmac. The cause of the explosion was not determined, but heat-induced overpressure and rupture of an aerosol spray can or therapeutic oxygen cylinder are suspected.

===Casualties===
Toxic smoke and fire caused the deaths of 53passengers and two cabin crew, 48 of them from smoke inhalation. Seventy-eight passengers and four crew escaped, with 15people sustaining serious injuries. One passenger, a man rescued 33minutes after the start of the fire, was found unconscious in the aisle, but died in the hospital sixdays later from injuries to his lungs and the resulting pneumonia.

== Causes ==
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) report lists a cause for the accident and a separate cause for the fatalities, as well as four contributing factors:
# The vulnerability of the wing tank access panels to impact
# The lack of any effective provision for fighting major fires inside the aircraft cabin
# The vulnerability of the aircraft hull to external fire
# The extremely toxic nature of the emissions from the burning interior materials.

Chris Yates, an aviation analyst, later said of the accident, &quot;This was very much a defining moment in the history of civil aviation safety. Specifically, the investigation found that a lot of materials inside the passenger cabin produced highly toxic fumes and required airlines to look again and re-invent the wheel, so to speak.&quot;
It brought about industry-wide changes to the seating layout near emergency exits, fire-resistant seat covers, floor lighting, fire-resistant wall and ceiling panels, more fire extinguishers and clearer evacuation rules.

===Accident===
The subsequent investigation into the accident said that the No. 9 combustor can on the port engine ruptured, and a section of the can was ejected forcibly into an underwing fuel tank access panel. That panel was fractured, allowing fuel to spill onto hot combustion gases from the engine. The resulting fire developed catastrophically, primarily due to the orientation of the aircraft and the fire to the wind, &quot;even though the wind was light.&quot;

===Fatalities===
The AAIB concluded, &quot;the major cause of the fatalities was rapid incapacitation due to the inhalation of the dense toxic/irritant smoke atmosphere within the cabin, aggravated by evacuation delays caused by a forward right door malfunction and restricted access to the exits.&quot;

=== Previous engine repair ===
Records showed the engine in question, a Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-15, had experienced previous cracks to the No. 9 combustor can that had been repaired in 1983 by fusion welding. The repair did not include solution heat treatment, which was a required procedure for this type of repair. The AAIB evaluated conflicting evidence on the effect of solution heat treatment and &quot;considered that it would not have had a significant effect on the fatigue life of the can.&quot; The circumferential edges of the severed forward section of the No. 9 can coincided with some of the cracks that had been welded during that repair. Some of the fracture was in areas where no cracking had been seen at the time of the repair, and the fracture edges were severely damaged during the failure and the ensuing fire. Therefore, the AAIB could not conclude whether the quality of the repair had caused or contributed to the accident.

== Aftermath and commemoration ==
The Civil Aviation Authority was criticised for not implementing stringent safety regulations earlier.

The swift incursion of the fire into the fuselage and the layout of the aircraft impaired passenger evacuation, with areas such as the forward galley area becoming a particular bottleneck. Of those unable to escape, 48 died as a result of incapacitation and subsequently lethal toxic gas and smoke inhalation, some very close to the exits, with six dying from burns. The use of smoke hoods or misting systems was also examined.

The tragedy haunted captain Peter Terrington, who struggled with survivor&#x27;s guilt for the remainder of his life and discussed the accident with his family &quot;nearly every day.&quot; According to his wife Joan, he was &quot;completely devastated that passengers had lost their lives,&quot; and always questioned whether he should have done more. He retired from flying at age 52, after 32 years as a pilot, becoming a counsellor for elderly people dealing with depression and loneliness. He continuously attended the annual memorial service at Manchester Airport for the flight&#x27;s victims, remaining concerned that all lessons learned from the accident should be fully implemented in practice. Diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in his later years, Terrington died in February 2016 at age 70 following a brief illness.

In August 2018, a memorial commemorating the victims was unveiled near the accident site.

== Awards ==
The surviving cabin crew, Arthur Bradbury and Joanna Toff, and two members of the Manchester Airport Fire Service, Fireman Samuel Lyttle and Fireman Eric Arthur Westwood, were all awarded the Queen&#x27;s Gallantry Medal, and the two flight attendants who died, Sharon Ford and Jacqui Urbanski, received the same award posthumously. Their collective citation stated in summary:

== Appearance in media ==
The accident was the subject of a 1985 &quot;World in Action&quot; investigation.

In 2010, this accident was reconstructed for a season-9 episode of &quot;Mayday&quot; (&quot;Air Crash Investigation&quot;) entitled &quot;Panic on the Runway&quot; or &quot;Manchester Runway Disaster&quot;, showing computer simulations of the accident, as well as interviews with Captain Terrington, survivors, and the air crash investigators.

<doc id="776081" wikidata="Q1616413" url="?curid=776081" title="Umberto Cassuto">
<text>Umberto Cassuto, also known as Moshe David Cassuto (16 September 1883 – 19 December 1951), was an Italian historian, a rabbi, and a scholar of the Hebrew Bible and Ugaritic literature, in the University of Florence, then at the University of Rome La Sapienza. When the 1938 anti-Semitic Italian racial laws forced him from this position, he moved to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

==Early life and career==
Cassuto was born in Florence as the son of Gustavo and Ernesta Galletti in a traditionalist Jewish family. Cassuto studied there at the University of Florence (graduated in 1906), and the &quot;Collegio Rabbinico&quot; (ordained in 1908), where its principal Samuel Hirsch Margulies had a profound influence on him. After getting a degree and &quot;Semicha&quot;, he taught at both institutions. From 1922 to 1925, he was Chief Rabbi of Florence. In 1925 he became professor of Hebrew and literature at the University of Florence and then took the chair of Hebrew language at the University of Rome La Sapienza. When the 1938 anti-Semitic laws forced him from this position, he accepted an invitation to fill the chair of Biblical studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Mandatory Palestine in 1939, where he taught until his death in 1951.

== Work ==
=== Ugaritic translation and commentary ===
Cassuto was one of the first scholars who understood the importance of the archaeological finds from Ugarit in Syria, and the similarities between the Ugaritic texts and the Hebrew Bible. His Ugaritic studies thus throw considerable light on the literary structure and vocabulary exegesis of the Bible. His treatise &quot;Ha-Elah Anat&quot; (1951, 1965; &quot;The Goddess Anath&quot;, 1970), a translation with introduction and commentary of Ugaritic texts, particularly the epic of Baal, is of special importance.

=== Origins of the Pentateuch ===
By the first half of the 20th century, Julius Wellhausen&#x27;s version of the documentary hypothesis had become the dominant view on the origins of the Pentateuch in academia. Cassuto&#x27;s &quot;The Documentary Hypothesis and the Composition of the Pentateuch&quot; (Hebrew, &quot;Torat HaTeudot&quot;, 1941; English translation, 1961) offered a critique of Wellhausen; Cassuto proposed the Pentateuch was redacted by a school around the 10th century BCE. However, the question of when the Pentateuch was finally written does not affect any element of Cassuto&#x27;s radical critique of the dominant theories about its actual make-up, which was his chief concern, and so he treats the historical question only at the end and as a secondary issue in &quot;The Documentary Hypothesis and the Composition of the Pentateuch&quot;. Cassuto insisted throughout this work that it was merely a summary, in eight lectures, of his much more detailed and thorough examination of the documentary hypothesis in his &quot;La Questione della Genesi&quot; (1934). He refers all serious students to the latter work in almost every chapter. Some idea of that more thorough consideration, however, is available in English in his &quot;Commentary on the Book of Genesis (Part I) from Adam to Noah&quot; (1961) and &quot;(Part II) from Noah to Abraham&quot; (1964), and also his &quot;Commentary on the Book of Exodus&quot; (1967).

Cassuto&#x27;s criticisms, while influential amongst many Jewish scholars, were dismissed by the overwhelming majority of Christian scholars at the time, although Oswald Thompson Allis (1943) argued along parallel lines. Most scholars have tended to ignore Cassuto&#x27;s &quot;The Documentary Hypothesis and the Composition of the Pentateuch&quot; beyond mentioning it in their footnotes listings. Scholars such as Rolf Rendtorff and John Van Seters have also put forward theories on Pentateuchal historical origins very similar to Cassuto&#x27;s, at least insofar as their views on its mode of composition are concerned. Modern ideas about the dating of the Torah, however, have not endorsed Cassuto&#x27;s specific early historical dating, and the trend today is for the final act of composition to be seen as lying in the period 500–400 BC, or even later.

=== Text of the Hebrew Bible ===
Cassuto felt the need to produce the most accurate possible text of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible). He realised that the texts generally published at the time had mostly been edited by non-Jews, and Jews who had converted to Christianity. While Cassuto saw no reason to believe that major alterations had been made, he felt it was important to compare these printed editions with older manuscripts as a check.

Thus Cassuto sought to use the oldest and most reliable manuscripts of the Tanakh, dating back many centuries before the invention of printing. In particular, in 1944 he managed to visit the Great Synagogue of Aleppo, Syria and study the Aleppo Codex. He was one of the very few scholars to study this key manuscript before most of the Torah section and some of the Prophets and Writings sections disappeared in the 1947 anti-Jewish riots in Aleppo.

From his research, he concluded that the printed Bibles generally had an accurate text. However, he corrected the spelling of many words, and made a great many corrections to the vowel points and musical notes. He also revised the layout of the text, its division into paragraphs, the use of poetical lines when he deemed it appropriate (for example, in Psalms, Proverbs and Job) and similar matters. Where he differed from other Bibles in any of these respects, it is likely that Cassuto has better authority. Cassuto&#x27;s critical edition of the Hebrew Bible was published posthumously in 1953.

=== Bible commentaries ===
Cassuto&#x27;s most enduring legacy may be his commentaries on the Hebrew Bible. According to the Jewish Virtual Library, his 1944 &quot;Shirat ha-Alilah be-Yisrael&quot; (&quot;Song of the Plot in Israel&quot;, later published in English in &quot;Biblical and Oriental Studies II&quot;) was Cassuto&#x27;s &#x27;primary contribution&#x27;. He wrote a Hebrew commentary on the Bible that became very popular in Israel. He wrote a more detailed commentary on Exodus and at the time of his death had completed chapters 1–11 of a more detailed commentary on Genesis. Both of these latter commentaries were made available in English, and include his views on the documentary hypothesis.

<doc id="776099" wikidata="Q354374" url="?curid=776099" title="Adele Addison">
<text>Adele Addison (born July 24, 1925) is an American lyric soprano who was a figure in the classical music world during the 1950s and 1960s. Although she did appear in several operas, Addison spent most of her career performing in recital and concert. Her performances spanned a wide array of literature from the Baroque period to contemporary compositions. She is best remembered today as the singing voice for Bess (played by Dorothy Dandridge) in the 1959 movie, &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;. Known for her polished and fluent tone, Addison made a desirable Baroque vocal artist. She can be heard on numerous recordings, of which her Baroque performances are perhaps her best work. Many of her recordings were made with the New York Philharmonic under the baton of Leonard Bernstein.

==Early life and education==
Addison, who is African-American, was born on July 24, 1925, in New York City, moving to Springfield, Massachusetts as a child.

Addison began dedicated vocal studies as a teenager and, following high school, she won a scholarship to study at the Westminster Choir College in Princeton, New Jersey. Further scholarships enabled her to pursue graduate studies at Princeton University and attend summer sessions at the Berkshire Music Center (now the Tanglewood Music Center), where she studied with Boris Goldovsky.

==Career==
Addison made her professional recital debut in Boston, in 1948 while still a student at Princeton. Following graduation she moved to New York City to pursue a career as a classical soprano. Of her 1952 New York City recital debut &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The recital season reached a high point last night when Adele Addison, soprano from Springfield, Massachusetts, made her debut in Town Hall.&quot; Following her New York debut, she continued to study voice at the Juilliard School with Beverley Peck Johnson and with Povla Frijsh. In 1955 she made her New York City Opera debut as Mimi in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot;. The &quot;New York Post&quot; said the following of her debut, &quot;Adele Addison is about the most appealing interpreter of the little Parisian seamstress yet to appear on the City Center stage. Small, frail looking, and pretty, Miss Addison enhanced these assets by acting and singing with moving poignancy and sincerity.&quot; That same year, Addison was invited by Aaron Copland to perform the world premiere of his &quot;Dirge In Woods&quot; at a concert sponsored by the League of Composers.

Although Addison was offered more opera roles with several companies, she did not appear in many more opera productions as she preferred to sing in recital and on the concert stage. She did appear in a few more productions with the New York City Opera, the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company, and the New England Opera Theatre. Her other opera roles included the title role in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot;, Liù in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot;, Gilda in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, Micaela in Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;, Fiordiligi in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, and Nannetta in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot; among others. In 1959, Addison sang the role of Bess in the film version of Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;. The role was initially supposed to be sung by Urylee Leonardos, but apparently Leonardos&#x27; voice sounded too shrill when recorded so they replaced her with Addison at the last minute. In a 1996 &quot;Opera News&quot; interview she said, &quot;Today, young singers are almost forced to make a choice, because they are counseled that becoming established in opera is the way to make a career in music. I never had to make a choice. I loved the song repertoire from the start, and as I began to sing, for even the smallest ladies&#x27; clubs, etc., those inviting me expected and accepted that... Even as the years passed, and I sang all the rest of the repertoire – opera, oratorio, chamber music, etc. – the first love remained... My curiosity, joy and love for song never changed. It still has not.&quot;

Addison made numerous appearances with major orchestras, such as the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, and the Cleveland Orchestra. In 1961 she was chosen by Charles Münch as the soprano soloist in the World premiere of Francis Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Gloria&quot; with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. She became a favorite of Bernstein and the two collaborated frequently, including on a number of recordings. In 1961 he invited her to sing the soprano solos in the world premiere of Lukas Foss&#x27; &quot;Time Cycle&quot;&#x27; with the New York Philharmonic. She performed the work again later that year with Izler Solomon and the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. She also sang under Bernstein for the opening of Lincoln Center&#x27;s Philharmonica Hall (now Avery Fisher Hall).

Other noted performances by Addison include the world premiere of Lester Trimble&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; and her interpretation of Debussy&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Enfant prodigue&quot;.
Towards the late 1960s, Addison&#x27;s performing career began to slow down as she focused more on teaching. Although retired now, she taught voice on the collegiate level for more than thirtyfive years. She has been a voice teacher for SUNY at Stony Brook, Eastman School of Music and Aspen Music Festival and School. For many years, she was also on the faculty, serving for a time as Chair, of the Voice Department at the Manhattan School of Music, which awarded her an honorary doctorate in 2001. Many of her students, such as Dawn Upshaw, have gone on to have successful careers. Addison once said, &quot;What I try to pass on to my own students at the Manhattan School of Music is to make them aware of their own abilities, to know how much they need to know in order to be a singing musician.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1958, Addison married Norman Berger, a senior research scientist and clinical professor of prosthetics-orthotics education in the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at New York University. Their 47-year marriage lasted until Berger&#x27;s death in 2005.

<text>The Order of Canons Regular of Prémontré (), also known as the Premonstratensians, the Norbertines and, in Britain and Ireland, as the White Canons (from the colour of their habit), is a religious order of canons regular of the Catholic Church founded in Prémontré near Laon in 1120 by Norbert of Xanten, who later became Archbishop of Magdeburg. Premonstratensians are designated by &quot;OPraem&quot; (&quot;Ordo Praemonstratensis&quot;) following their name.

Norbert was a friend of Bernard of Clairvaux and was largely influenced by the Cistercian ideals as to both the manner of life and the government of his order. As the Premonstratensians are not monks but canons regular, their work often involves preaching and the exercising of pastoral ministry; they frequently serve in parishes close to their abbeys or priories.

==History==
The order was founded in 1120. Saint Norbert had made various efforts to introduce a strict form of canonical life in various communities of canons in Germany; in 1120 he was working in the now-extinct Ancient Diocese of Laon, in Picardy, northeastern France. There, in a rural place called Prémontré, he and thirteen companions established a monastery to be the cradle of a new order. As they were canons regular, they followed the Rule of St. Augustine, but with supplementary statutes that made their life one of great austerity. Common prayer and celebration of the Eucharist was to be the sustaining dynamic of the community.
In 1126, when the order received papal approbation by Pope Honorius II, there were nine houses; others were established in quick succession throughout western Europe, so that at the middle of the fourteenth century there were some 1,300 monasteries for men and 400 for women. The Norbertines played a predominant part in the conversion of the Wends and the bringing of Christianity to the territories around the Elbe and the Oder. In time, mitigations and relaxations emerged, and these gave rise to reforms and semi-independent congregations within the Order.

The Norbertines arrived in England about 1143, first at Newhouse in Lincoln, England; before the dissolution under Henry VIII there were 35 houses. Soon after their arrival in England, they founded Dryburgh Abbey in the Borders area of Scotland, which was followed by other communities at Whithorn Priory, Dercongal Abbey and Tongland Abbey all in the Borders area, as well as Fearn Abbey in the northern part of the nation. Like most orders they were almost completely devastated by the successive onslaughts of the Reformation, French Revolution, and Napoleon, but then experienced a revival in the 19th century.

By the beginning of the nineteenth century the order had become almost extinct, only eight houses surviving, all in the Habsburg monarchy. However, there was something of a resurgence, and at the start of the twentieth century there were 20 monasteries and 1000 priests. , the number of monasteries had increased to nearly 100 and spread to every continent. In 1893, Father Bernard Pennings and two other Norbertines from Berne Abbey arrived in the United States of America to minister to Belgian immigrants in northern Wisconsin. De Pere, Wisconsin became the site of the first Norbertine Abbey in the new world.

By their nature as canons regular the Premonstratensians have always engaged in pastoral work of various kinds, including what would now be called retreat centres (nearly everywhere), and care for pilgrims (as at Conques) and, like many religious houses, have often run schools on a variety of scales (Averbode Abbey, Berne Abbey, United States, Australia). In order to support themselves, the different communities have down the centuries, and in modern times, operated small-scale manual activities (SME) such as printing (Averbode Abbey, Tongerlo Abbey, Berne Abbey), farming (Kinshasa, Ireland, Postel Abbey), forestry (Schlägl Abbey, Geras Abbey, Slovakia), and cheese-making (Postel Abbey). They have also entered agreements with breweries (Tongerlo Abbey, Postel Abbey, Park Abbey, Leffe, Grimbergen) and undertaken artistic bookbinding (in Oosterhout). Other activities have included the running of an astronomical observatory (Mira, Grimbergen).

In 2015, there were some 1000 male and 200 female members of the Order.

The Feast of All Norbertine Saints and Blesseds is celebrated internally on November 13.

The Norbertines have also had a major presence in the area of Green Bay, Wisconsin, owning WBAY television and radio stations until the mid-1970s. The Norbertines ran two local boys high schools until 1990 and still run four local schools in De Pere and Green Bay. Among these schools is St. Norbert College, the only Norbertine higher education institution in the world.

==Canonesses==
The Order has several abbeys of women who, though technically called canonesses, follow the life of an enclosed religious order and are therefore more commonly termed Norbertine nuns. Like the Norbertine communities for men, those for women are autonomous. Unusually, within the religious communities of the Catholic Church, the Norbertine Order has always seen the spiritual life of the canonesses as being on an equal footing with that of its priests and lay brothers. In the Middle Ages, the Premonstratensians even had a few double monasteries, where men and women lived in cloisters located next to each other as part of the same abbey, the communities demonstrating their unity by sharing the church building. Today, it is common for a foundation of canonesses to have links not only with other canonesses, but also with a community of canons.

==Premonstratensian Rite==
The Premonstratensians were among the religious orders with their own rite who kept this rite after Pope Pius V suppressed such rites with a continuous tradition of less than two hundred years. The Premonstratensian Rite was especially characterized by a ritual solemnity. The Premonstratensian Rite was also characterized by an emphasis on the Paschal mystery unique among the Latin rites. This was especially seen in the solemnity with which the daily conventional High Mass and office was celebrated during the Easter octave, especially vespers which concluded with a procession to the baptismal font, a practice paralleled among the Latin rites only in similar processions still found in the Ambrosian Rite. Another unique practice of the Premonstratensian Rite was the celebration of a daily votive Mass in honor of the Virgin Mary in each of its abbeys and priories.

==Structure==
Since Norbertine abbeys (and most priories) are autonomous, practices and apostolates are different, depending on the needs of the local Church. Some houses are contemplative in character whilst others are highly active in pastoral ministry. However, each is guided by the Rule of Saint Augustine and the Constitutions established by the General Chapter, which is held every six years.

The general Chapter includes representatives from both male and female communities. The head of the Order, termed Abbot General, resides in Rome, and he is assisted in his duties by the Definitors (High Council) as well as commissions established for various aspects of the Order&#x27;s life such as liturgy and inter-abbey communications.

==Abbeys==
As of 2012, there were Premonstratensian abbeys or priories throughout the world: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Peru, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the USA.

==Controversies==
Northern Ireland&#x27;s Historical Abuse Inquiry investigated reports that Brendan Smyth, a member of the Norbertine Order, was allowed to continue paedophilia for more than four decades, even after Smyth himself had admitted in 1994, the same year that he was jailed for his crimes, that &quot;Over the years of religious life it could be that I have sexually abused between 50 and 100 children. That number could even be doubled or perhaps even more.&quot; Reviewers of the case agree that there was a deliberate plot to conceal Smyth&#x27;s behaviour, incompetence by his superiors at Kilnacrott Abbey.

<text>In Unix-like operating systems, &#x27; and &#x27; are special files that serve as cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs). They allow access to a CSPRNG that is seeded with entropy (a value that provides randomness) from environmental noise, collected from device drivers and other sources. typically blocked if there was less entropy available than requested; more recently (see below for the differences between operating systems) it usually blocks at startup until sufficient entropy has been gathered, then unblocks permanently. The device typically was never a blocking device, even if the pseudorandom number generator seed was not fully initialized with entropy since boot. Not all operating systems implement the same methods for and .

This special file originated in Linux in 1994. It was quickly adopted by other Unix-like operating systems.

==Linux==

The Linux kernel provides the separate device files and . Since kernel version 5.6 of 2020, only blocks when the CSPRNG hasn&#x27;t initialized. Once initialized, and behave the same.

In October 2016, with the release of Linux kernel version 4.8, the kernel&#x27;s was switched over to a ChaCha20-based cryptographic pseudorandom number generator (CPRNG) implementation by Theodore Ts&#x27;o, based on Bernstein&#x27;s well-regarded stream cipher ChaCha20.

Since version 5.17 of the Linux kernel, the random number generator switched from using the SHA-1 cryptographic hash function in the entropy collector to BLAKE2s, a newer, faster and more secure hash function.

=== Original implementation ===
Random number generation in kernel space was implemented for the first time for Linux in 1994 by Theodore Ts&#x27;o.
The implementation used secure hashes rather than ciphers, to avoid cryptography export restrictions that were in place when the generator was originally designed. The implementation was also designed with the assumption that any given hash or cipher might eventually be found to be weak, and so the design is durable in the face of any such weaknesses. Fast recovery from pool compromise is not considered a requirement, because the requirements for pool compromise are sufficient for much easier and more direct attacks on unrelated parts of the operating system.

In Ts&#x27;o&#x27;s implementation, the generator keeps an estimate of the number of bits of noise in the entropy pool. From this entropy pool random numbers are created. When read, the device will only return random bytes within the estimated number of bits of noise in the entropy pool. When the entropy pool is empty, reads from will block until additional environmental noise is gathered. The intent is to serve as a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator, delivering output with entropy as large as possible. This is suggested by the authors for use in generating cryptographic keys for high-value or long-term protection.

A counterpart to is (&quot;unlimited&quot;/non-blocking random source) which reuses the internal pool to produce more pseudo-random bits. This means that the call will not block, but the output may contain less entropy than the corresponding read from . While is still intended as a pseudorandom number generator suitable for most cryptographic purposes, the authors of the corresponding man page note that, theoretically, there may exist an as-yet-unpublished attack on the algorithm used by , and that users concerned about such an attack should use instead. However such an attack is unlikely to come into existence, because once the entropy pool is unpredictable it doesn&#x27;t leak security by a reduced number of bits.

It is also possible to write to . This allows any user to mix random data into the pool. Non-random data is harmless, because only a privileged user can issue the ioctl needed to increase the entropy estimate. The current amount of entropy and the size of the Linux kernel entropy pool, both measured in bits, are available in and can be displayed by the command and respectively.

=== Entropy injection ===
Gutterman, Pinkas, &amp; Reinman in March 2006 published a detailed cryptographic analysis of the Linux random number generator in which they describe several weaknesses. Perhaps the most severe issue they report is with embedded or Live CD systems, such as routers and diskless clients, for which the bootup state is predictable and the available supply of entropy from the environment may be limited. For a system with non-volatile memory, they recommend saving some state from the RNG at shutdown so that it can be included in the RNG state on the next reboot. In the case of a router for which network traffic represents the primary available source of entropy, they note that saving state across reboots &quot;would require potential attackers to either eavesdrop on all network traffic&quot; from when the router is first put into service, or obtain direct access to the router&#x27;s internal state. This issue, they note, is particularly critical in the case of a wireless router whose network traffic can be captured from a distance, and which may be using the RNG to generate keys for data encryption.

The Linux kernel provides support for several hardware random number generators, should they be installed. The raw output of such a device may be obtained from .

With Linux kernel 3.16 and newer, the kernel itself mixes data from hardware random number generators into on a sliding scale based on the definable entropy estimation quality of the HWRNG. This means that no userspace daemon, such as from , is needed to do that job. With Linux kernel 3.17+, the VirtIO RNG was modified to have a default quality defined above 0, and as such, is currently the only HWRNG mixed into by default.

The entropy pool can be improved by programs like , , etc. With , hardware random number generators like &quot;Entropy Key, etc.&quot; can write to . The diehard tests programs , and can test these random number generators.

=== Critique of entropy injection ===
In January 2014, Daniel J. Bernstein published a critique of how Linux mixes different sources of entropy. He outlines an attack in which one source of entropy capable of monitoring the other sources of entropy could modify its output to nullify the randomness of the other sources of entropy. Consider the function where &quot;H&quot; is a hash function and &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; are sources of entropy with &quot;z&quot; being the output of a CPU-based malicious HRNG Z:
# &quot;Z&quot; generates a random value of &quot;r&quot;.
# &quot;Z&quot; computes .
# If the output of is equal to the desired value, output &quot;r&quot; as &quot;z&quot;.
# Else, repeat starting at 1.
Bernstein estimated that an attacker would need to repeat 16 times to compromise DSA and ECDSA, by causing the first four bits of the RNG output to be 0. This is possible because Linux reseeds H on an ongoing basis instead of using a single high quality seed.

Bernstein also argues that entropy injection is pointless once the CSPRNG has been initialized.

In kernel 5.17 (backported to kernel 5.10.119), Jason A. Donenfeld offered a new design of the Linux entropy pool infrastructure. Donenfeld reported that the old pool, consisting of a single 4096-bit LFSR is vulnerable to two attacks: (1) an attacker can undo the effect of a known input; (2) if the whole pool&#x27;s state is leaked, an attacker can set all bits in the pool to zero. His new design, which is faster and safer, uses the blake2s hash function for mixing a 256-bit pool.

==BSD systems==
The FreeBSD operating system provides a link to . Both block only until properly seeded. FreeBSD&#x27;s PRNG (Fortuna) reseeds regularly, and does not attempt to estimate entropy. On a system with small amount of network and disk activity, reseeding is done after a fraction of a second.

DragonFly BSD inherited FreeBSD&#x27;s random device files when it was forked.

Since OpenBSD 5.1 (May 1, 2012) and uses arc4random, a CSPRNG function based on RC4. The function was changed to use the stronger ChaCha20 with OpenBSD 5.5 (May 1, 2014). The system automatically uses hardware random number generators (such as those provided on some Intel PCI hubs) if they are available, through the OpenBSD Cryptographic Framework. was removed in OpenBSD 6.3 (April 15, 2018).

NetBSD&#x27;s implementation of the legacy API has been switched over to ChaCha20 as well.

==macOS, iOS and other Apple OSes==
All Apple OSes have moved to Fortuna since at least December 2019, possibly earlier. It is based on SHA-256. Multiple entropy sources such as the secure enclave RNG, boot phase timing jitter, hardware interrupt (timing assumed) are used. RDSEED/RDRAND is used on Intel-based Macs that support it. Seed (entropy) data is also stored for subsequent reboots.

Prior to the change, macOS and iOS used 160-bit Yarrow based on SHA-1.

There is no difference between and ; both behave identically.

==Other operating systems==
 and are also available on Solaris,
NetBSD,
Tru64 UNIX 5.1B, AIX 5.2 and HP-UX 11i v2. As with FreeBSD, AIX implements its own Yarrow-based design, however AIX uses considerably fewer entropy sources than the standard implementation and stops refilling the pool when it thinks it contains enough entropy.

In Windows NT, similar functionality is delivered by , but reading the special file does not work as in UNIX. The documented methods to generate cryptographically random bytes are CryptGenRandom and RtlGenRandom. Windows PowerShell provides access to a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator via the cmdlet.

Cygwin on Windows provides implementations of both and , which can be used in scripts and programs.

<text>Robert Studley Forrest Hughes AO (28 July 19386 August 2012) was one of the most notable Australian-born art critics, writer, and producer of television documentaries. He was described in 1997 by Robert Boynton of &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;the most famous art critic in the world.&quot;

Hughes earned widespread recognition for his book and television series on modern art, &quot;The Shock of the New&quot;, and for his longstanding position as art critic with &quot;TIME&quot; magazine. He is also known for his best seller &quot;The Fatal Shore&quot; (1986), a study of the British convict system in early Australian history. Known for his contentious critiques of art and artists, Hughes was generally conservative in his tastes, although he did not belong to a particular philosophical camp. His writing was noted for its power and elegance.

==Early life==
Hughes was born in Sydney, in 1938. His father and paternal grandfather were lawyers. Hughes&#x27;s father, Geoffrey Forrest Hughes, was a pilot in the First World War, with later careers as a solicitor and company director. He died from lung cancer when Robert was aged 12. His mother was Margaret Eyre Sealy, née Vidal. His elder brother was Australian politician Thomas Eyre Forrest Hughes, the father of former Sydney Lord Mayor Lucy Turnbull, the wife of former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. He had another brother Geoffrey and one sister, Constance.

Growing up in Rose Bay, Sydney, Hughes was educated at Saint Ignatius&#x27; College, Riverview before studying arts and then architecture at the University of Sydney. At university, he associated with the Sydney &quot;Push&quot; – a group of artists, writers, intellectuals and drinkers. Among the group were Germaine Greer and Clive James.

==Career==

=== As an art critic ===
Hughes, an aspiring artist and poet, abandoned his university endeavours to become first a cartoonist and then an art critic for the Sydney periodical &quot;The Observer&quot;, edited by Donald Horne. Hughes was briefly involved in the original Sydney version of &quot;Oz&quot; magazine and wrote art criticism for &quot;Nation&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;.

In 1961, while still a student, Hughes was caught up in controversy when a number of his classmates demonstrated in a student newspaper article that he had published plagiarised poetry by Terence Tiller and others, and a drawing by Leonard Baskin.

Hughes left Australia for Europe in 1964, living for a time in Italy before settling in London in 1965, where he wrote for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, and &quot;The Observer&quot;, among others, and contributed to the London version of &quot;Oz&quot;. In 1970 he was appointed art critic for &quot;TIME&quot; magazine and moved to New York, where he soon became an influential voice.

In 1966 Hughes published a history of Australian painting titled &quot;The Art of Australia&quot;, still considered an important work.

Hughes wrote and narrated the BBC eight-part series &quot;The Shock of the New&quot; (1980) on the development of modern art since the Impressionists. It was produced and in part directed by Lorna Pegram. It was accompanied by a book with the same title. John O&#x27;Connor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;Agree or disagree, you will not be bored. Mr. Hughes has a disarming way of being provocative.&quot;

Hughes&#x27;s TV series &quot;American Visions&quot; (1997) reviewed the history of American art since the Revolution. Hughes&#x27;s documentary on Francisco Goya, &quot;Goya: Crazy Like a Genius&quot; (2002), was broadcast on the first night of the new British domestic digital service, BBC Four. He created a one-hour update to &quot;The Shock of the New&quot;, titled &quot;The New Shock of the New&quot;, which first aired in 2004. He published the first volume of his memoirs, &quot;Things I Didn’t Know&quot;, in 2006.

Following his death, Jonathan Jones wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that Hughes &quot;was simply the greatest art critic of our time and it will be a long while before we see his like again. He made criticism look like literature. He also made it look morally worthwhile. He lent a nobility to what can often seem a petty way to spend your life. Hughes could be savage, but he was never petty. There was purpose to his lightning bolts of condemnation&quot;.

=== As a journalist and historian ===
Hughes and Harold Hayes were recruited in 1978 to anchor the new ABC News (US) newsmagazine &quot;20/20&quot;. Their only broadcast, on 6 June 1978, proved so controversial that, less than a week later, ABC News president Roone Arledge terminated the contracts of both men, replacing them with veteran TV host Hugh Downs.

Hughes&#x27;s book &quot;The Fatal Shore&quot; followed in 1987. A study of the British penal colonies and early European settlement of Australia, it became an international best-seller. During the late 1990s, Hughes was a prominent supporter of the Australian Republican Movement. &quot;Australia: Beyond the Fatal Shore&quot; (2000) was a series musing on modern Australia and Hughes&#x27;s relationship with it. During production, Hughes was involved in a near-fatal road accident.

==Personal life==
Hughes met his first wife, Danne Emerson, in London in 1967. Together they became involved in the counterculture of the 1960s, exploring drug use and sexual freedom. They divorced in 1981; she died of a brain tumour in 2003. Their son, Danton, Hughes&#x27;s only child, was named after the French revolutionary Georges Danton. Danton Hughes, a sculptor, committed suicide in April 2001; he was found by his partner, fashion designer Jenny Kee, with whom he had been in a long-term relationship. Robert Hughes later wrote: &quot;I miss Danton and always will, although we had been miserably estranged for years and the pain of his loss has been somewhat blunted by the passage of time&quot;.

Hughes was married to his second wife, Victoria Whistler, from 1981 until their divorce in 1996.

In 1999, Hughes was involved in a near-fatal car accident south of Broome, Western Australia. He was returning from a fishing trip and driving on the wrong side of the road when he collided head on with another car carrying three occupants. He was trapped in the car for three hours before being airlifted to Perth in critical condition. Hughes was in a coma for five weeks after the crash. In a 2000 court hearing, Hughes&#x27;s defence barrister alleged that the occupants of the other car had been transporting illicit drugs at the time of the accident and were at fault. In 2003 Hughes pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing bodily harm and was fined A$2,500. Hughes recounts the story of the accident and his recovery in the first chapter of his 2006 memoir &quot;Things I Didn&#x27;t Know&quot;.

In 2001, Hughes wed his third wife, the American artist and art director Doris Downes. &quot;Apart from being a talented painter, she saved my life, my emotional stability, such as it is&quot;, he said.

==Death==
After a long illness, reportedly exacerbated by some 50 years of alcohol consumption, Hughes died at Calvary Hospital in The Bronx, New York City, on 6 August 2012, with his wife at his bedside. He was also survived by two stepsons from his wife&#x27;s previous marriage, Freeborn Garrettson Jewett IV and Fielder Douglas Jewett; his brothers, Tom and Geoffrey Hughes; a sister, Constance Crisp; and many nieces and nephews.

==Assessment==
When &quot;The Shock of the New&quot; was proposed to the BBC, television programmers were sceptical that a journalist could properly follow the aristocratic tone of Kenneth Clark, whose &quot;Civilisation&quot; had been so successful. &quot;The Shock of the New&quot; proved to be a popular and critical success: it has been assessed &quot;much the best synoptic introduction to modern art ever written&quot;, taking as its premise the vitality gained by modern art when it ceded the need to replicate nature in favour of a more direct expression of human experience and emotion. Hughes&#x27;s explanations of modern art benefited from the coherence of his judgments, and were marked by his ability to summarise the essential qualities of his subject.

Whether positive or negative, his judgments were enthusiastic. He championed London painters like Frank Auerbach and Lucian Freud, helping to popularise the latter in the United States, and wrote with unabashed admiration for Francisco Goya and Pierre Bonnard. By contrast Hughes was dismissive of much postmodernism and neo-expressionism, of painters like Julian Schnabel and David Salle, as well as the vicissitudes of a money-fuelled art market. While his reviews expressed antipathy for the avant-garde, he was beholden neither to any theory nor ideology, and managed to provoke both ends of the political spectrum. He distrusted novelty in art for its own sake, yet he was also disdainful of a conservative aesthetic that avoided risk. He famously labelled contemporary Australian indigenous art as &quot;the last great art movement of the 20th century&quot;. Hughes, according to Adam Gopnik, was drawn to work that was rough-hewn, &quot;craft attempted with passion.&quot;

Hughes&#x27;s critical prose, vivid in both praise and indignation, has been compared to that of George Bernard Shaw, Jonathan Swift and William Shakespeare. &quot;His prose&quot;, according to a colleague, &quot;was lithe, muscular and fast as a bunch of fives. He was incapable of writing the jargon of the art world, and consequently was treated by its mandarins with fear and loathing.&quot; In different moods he could write that &quot;Schnabel’s work is to painting what Stallone’s is to acting: a lurching display of oily pectorals,&quot; as well as conclude that Antoine Watteau &quot;was a connoisseur of the unplucked string, the immobility before the dance, the moment that falls between departure and nostalgia.&quot;

<text>A Bakewell tart is an English confection consisting of a shortcrust pastry shell beneath layers of jam, frangipane, and a topping of flaked almonds. It is a variant of the Bakewell pudding, closely associated with the town of Bakewell in Derbyshire.

==History==
The Bakewell tart developed as a variant of the Bakewell pudding in the 20th century. Although the terms &quot;Bakewell tart&quot; and &quot;Bakewell pudding&quot; have been used interchangeably, each name refers to a specific dessert recipe. The tart is closely associated with the town of Bakewell in Derbyshire.

==Variants==
===Cherry Bakewell===
A Cherry Bakewell, also known as a Bakewell cake, is a version of the tart where the frangipane is covered with a top layer of almond-flavoured fondant and a single half glacé cherry.

===Gloucester tart===
In Gloucester, a similar tart was made using ground rice, raspberry jam and almond essence. In May 2013, council leader Paul James discovered a recipe for &quot;Gloucester tart&quot; in a Gloucester history book. Subsequently, Gloucester museums revived the recipe, serving complimentary Gloucester tarts to museum patrons.

<text>RTL Lëtzebuerg is the main television channel in Luxembourg, broadcasting in Luxembourgish. It is part of RTL Group.

==History==
The small television market in Luxembourg led to a unique system in Europe: Luxembourg was the only country in the world in which television stations were operated in both the PAL and SECAM formats. Originally, both channels carried the same signal, Tele Luxembourg. Later, the signals were split in the two independent stations RTL-TVI (PAL, system G, on channel 27, the &quot;i&quot; stand for independent), targeting the French-speaking part of Belgium, and RTL Télévision (SECAM, system L, on channel 21), targeting France. Both stations initially continued to carry a lot of the same programming, with regards to foreign series and movies, but produced news and game shows for their target audience.

As restrictions on operating commercial television stations in Europe were relaxed in the mid-1980s, RTL-TVI moved entirely to Brussels, while the popularity of RTL Télévision was somewhat diminished by the success of M6. RTL Télévision was renamed RTL9 and, even though its original terrestrial frequency in Luxembourg remains, it is now primarily a cable station for France.

In 1984, German language RTL Plus (now RTL Television) was added on channel E7 (PAL-B).

All these stations carried a program in Luxembourgish, called . The main purpose was to show these stations were essentially broadcasters from Luxembourg and not aiming to be commercial stations in Belgium, France and Germany. When the stations were licensed in their intended broadcasting regions, this program was dropped.

Today, RTL Lëtzebuerg carries entertainment, magazine and news in Luxembourgish. Outside broadcasting hours, a live camera from the radio studio is broadcast, along with text news and traffic cameras. Programs from RTL Shop in French and sometimes German are broadcast a few hours a day, mostly in the morning.

For a few years the station&#x27;s only competitor was Tango TV, operated by Tele2 from 2002 to 2007. Its main competitors in 2012 are Eldo TV and Den Oppener Kanal (.dok). All other TV stations in Luxembourg only broadcast on a local level (Nordliicht TV in the north or Uelzecht Kanal in the south of the country). RTL also has a second channel, RTL Zwee, with mostly reruns and live sports programmes.

==Broadcast==
Viewers in Luxembourg can also tune into RTL 4 (channel 41), RTL 5, RTL 7 and RTL 8, which are intended for the Dutch market. Since all these stations have their television licences in Luxembourg, they are available as terrestrial channels. Like television channels in the Netherlands, they show all foreign programming in the original language with subtitles, rather than dubbed.

Since the switch to digital terrestrial television which was implemented overnight on 1 September 2006, RTL Télé Lëtzebuerg and RTL Zwee share channel 27, M6 is on channel 7, and RTL-TVI, Club RTL, Plug RTL, &amp; RTL 4, 5, 7, &amp; 8 are on channel 24.

<text>Caroline Island (also known as Caroline Atoll or Millennium Island) is the easternmost of several uninhabited coral atolls comprising the southern Line Islands in the central Pacific Ocean nation of Kiribati.

The atoll was first sighted by Europeans in 1606 and was claimed by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1868. It has been part of the Republic of Kiribati since the island nation&#x27;s independence in 1979. Caroline Island has remained relatively untouched and is one of the world&#x27;s most pristine tropical islands, despite guano mining, copra (coconut meat) harvesting, and human habitation in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is home to one of the world&#x27;s largest populations of the coconut crab and is an important breeding site for seabirds, most notably the sooty tern.

The atoll is known as the first place on Earth to see sunrise each day during much of the year, and for its role in the millennium celebrations of 2000. A 1995 realignment of the International Date Line made Caroline Island the first point of land on Earth to reach 1 January 2000 on the calendar.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The atolls (ring-shaped coral reefs) of the Pacific Ocean are the most marginal environment in the world for human habitation. They have generally not been occupied for more than 1,500 years, but started to be settled by humans once permanent islets formed around lagoons. In comparison with other atolls, Caroline Island has been relatively undisturbed.

There are indications that early Polynesians reached the island before Europeans, as several &quot;marae&quot; (communal or sacred places) and graves have been discovered, but no evidence has been found of long-term settlement. Evidence of the largest of the &quot;marae&quot;, located on the west side of Nake Islet, was documented in 1883.

===Early sightings and accounts===
Ferdinand Magellan may have sighted Caroline Island on 4 February 1521. The first recorded sighting of Caroline Island by Europeans was on 21 February 1606, by the Portuguese explorer Pedro Fernández de Quirós, who named the island San Bernardo, and who wrote an account of his voyage. The island was next seen by Europeans on 16 December 1795, when the British naval officer William Robert Broughton of named it Carolina, after the daughter of Philip Stephens, the First Secretary of the Admiralty. The island was sighted in 1821 by the English whaler &quot;Supply&quot;, and was then named &quot;Thornton Island&quot; for the ship&#x27;s captain. It was also recorded in the 19th century as Hirst Island and Clark Island.

Other early visits which left behind accounts of the island include that of the USS &quot;Dolphin&quot; in 1825, written by the United States Navy officer Hiram Paulding. According to this account, the crew of the &quot;Dolphin&quot; supplied themselves with fish from the island, although when wading back to their ship they were attacked by sharks.

The English whaling ship &quot;Tuscan&quot; reached Caroline island in 1835, and the geography and wildlife of the island were recorded by the ship&#x27;s surgeon, the biologist Frederick Debell Bennett, in his &quot;Narrative of a Whaling Voyage Round the Globe From the Year 18331836&quot;. Bennett knew that the island was seldom visited, &quot;although it is usually &#x27;sighted&#x27; by South-Seamen, when on their way from the Society Islands to the North Pacific&quot;. He noted that about seven years before the arrival of the &quot;Tuscan&quot;, a Captain Stavers had landed on the island and left behind some pigs, of which no trace remained.

===1883 solar eclipse===

In 1883 two expeditions arrived on Caroline Island in time to observe and record the solar eclipse of 6 May. On 22 March, American and English astronomers left the Peruvian port of Callao aboard the , arriving at the island on 20 April. Among those in the American expedition were the astronomers Edward S. Holden of the Washburn Observatory, the expedition&#x27;s leader, and Winslow Upton, professor of astronomy at Brown University. An expedition from France arrived two days later in the &quot;L&#x27;Eclaireur&quot;.

As small boats could not come close to the shore, the equipment was carried to the island by men standing in about of water, and then about further to the observation site. On the morning of 6 May, the sky cleared shortly before the time of first contact, and remained clear for the rest of the day. During the eclipse, the astronomers searched for Vulcan, a hypothetical intra-Mercurial planet, but discovered nothing. The duration of totality (the time the entire disc of the Sun is obscured) was 5 minutes 25 seconds, a little less than the maximum duration of 5 minutes 58 seconds. The Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa, a member of the French expedition, discovered an asteroid later that year, which he named Carolina after the island.

===Commercial enterprises and British claim===
In 1846, the Tahitian firm of Collie and Lucett attempted to establish a small stock-raising and copra-harvesting community on the island; the operation met with limited financial success. In 1868, Caroline was claimed for Britain by the captain of HMS &quot;Reindeer&quot;, which noted 27 residents in a settlement on South Islet. The island was leased by the British government to Houlder Brothers and Co. in 1872, with John T. Arundel as the manager; two of the islets are named for him. Houlder Brothers and Co. conducted minimal guano mining on the island from 1874. John T. Arundel and Co. took over the lease and the industry in 1881; the company supplied a total of about 10,000 tons of phosphate until supplies became exhausted in 1895. In 1885 Arundel established a coconut plantation, but the coconut palms suffered from disease and the plantation failed. The settlement on the island lasted until 1904, when the six remaining Polynesians were relocated to Niue.

The island was leased to S.R. Maxwell and Company and a new settlement was established in 1916, this time built entirely upon copra export. Much of the South islet was deforested to make way for coconut palms, a non-indigenous plant. The business venture, however, went into debt, and the island&#x27;s settlement slowly decreased in population. By 1926, it was down to only ten residents, and by 1936, the settlement consisted of only two Tahitian families. It was abandoned in the late 1930s.
During World War II, Caroline Island remained unoccupied, and no military action took place there. Under British jurisdiction, it was formally repossessed by the British Western Pacific High Commission in 1943 and then governed as part of the Central and Southern Line Islands. A Tahitian family was found to be living on the atoll when the American sailor John Caldwell visited it in September 1946. In January 1972, the Central and Southern Line Islands were joined with the British colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, which had become autonomous in 1971.

===Kiribati===

When the Gilbert Islands became the independent nation of Kiribati in 1979, Caroline Island became Kiribati&#x27;s easternmost point. The island is owned by the government of the Republic of Kiribati and overseen by the Ministry of Line and Phoenix Islands Development, which is headquartered on Kiritimati. Claims to sovereignty over the island by the United States were relinquished in the 1979 Treaty of Tarawa, ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1983.

The island was inhabited from 1987 to 1991 by Anne and Ron Falconer and their children, who developed a largely self-sufficient settlement. Following a transfer of ownership, the Falconers left the island. In the 1990s, the island was occasionally visited by Polynesian copra gatherers under agreements with the Kiribati government in Tarawa.
On 23 December 1994, the Republic of Kiribati announced a change of time zone for the Line Islands would take effect on 31 December 1994. This adjustment placed all of Kiribati on the Asian or western side of the International Date Line. Although Caroline Island&#x27;s longitudinal position of 150 degrees west corresponded to a UTC offset of −10 hours, the island&#x27;s new time zone became UTC+14. This move made Caroline Island both the easternmost land in the earliest time zone (by some definitions, the easternmost point on Earth), and the first point of land which would see sunrise on 1 January 2000—at 5:43 a.m. local time. Other Pacific nations, including Tonga, New Zealand and Fiji, protested the move, objecting that it infringed on their claims to be the first land to see dawn in the year 2000. According to the United States Naval Observatory, the first point of land to see sunrise on 1 January 2000 (local time) was between the Dibble Glacier and Victor Bay in East Antarctica, at 66 degrees south, where the sun rose at 12:08 a.m.

In August 1997, to promote events to mark the arrival of the year 2000, Caroline Island was renamed Millennium Island by the Kiribati government. In December 1999, over 70 Kiribati singers and dancers travelled to Caroline from South Tarawa, accompanied by approximately 25 journalists, as part of the celebrations to mark the arrival of the new millennium.

In 2017 a Russian businessman proposed a deal to invest $350 million to build a resort in Kiribati in exchange for sovereign rights over three islands. The deal was rejected by the Kiribati government based on a report from the Kiribati Foreign Investment Commission.

==Geography and climate==

Caroline Island lies near the southeastern end of the Line Islands, a string of atolls and islands extending across the equator, south of the Hawaiian Islands in the central Pacific Ocean. The slightly crescent-shaped atoll has a land area of . It consists of approximately 39 separate islets, surrounding a narrow lagoon; the smallest islet, Motu Atibu, may have disappeared. The islets—which rise to a height of above sea level—share a common geologic origin, and consist of sand deposits and limestone rock set atop a coral reef. According to the path of the International Date Line, the atoll is the easternmost point of land on Earth.

Three islets make up the bulk of Caroline&#x27;s land area: Nake Islet () at the north, Long Islet () at the northeast of the lagoon, and South Islet () at the southern end. The other islets, most of which were named during a 1988 ecological survey conducted by the naturalists Cameron and Angela Kepler, fall into four groups: the South Nake Islets, the Central Leeward Islets, the Southern Leeward Islets, and the Windward Islets. The island is vulnerable to erosion by spring tides, storms, and strong winds; storms have caused smaller islets to sometimes appear or disappear, and the shapes of larger ones to become altered.
The lagoon, roughly in size, is shallow—it is at most in depth—and is crossed repeatedly by narrow coral heads and patch reefs. Reef flats generally extend over from the shore—although some sources report them to extend more than from land—and make boat landings perilous except at high tide. There are no natural landings, anchorages, or deep water openings into the lagoon; water that spills into it over shallow channels at high tide is contained within the surrounding reef and remains stable despite ocean tides. Most landings are made at a small break in the reef at the northeast corner of South Islet.
There is no standing fresh water on Caroline Island, but Nake Islet and South Islet have underground freshwater aquifers and freshwater lenses. The underground water supply on Nake attracted Polynesian settlers, but the first European explorers to reach the atoll searched in vain for drinking water; wells were built to tap drinking water for later temporary settlements. Little is known about the island&#x27;s existing freshwater lenses. Soils are of poor quality, dominated by coral gravel and sand, with organic content present only within stable, forested island centers. Guano deposits make island soil, where it does exist, nitrogen-rich.
Like the rest of Kiribati, Caroline Island enjoys a tropical maritime climate which is consistently hot and humid, with air temperatures that relate closely to sea temperature. Across Kiribati average temperatures vary no more than 1 °C from season to season.

There is no weather station located at Caroline. During 2014 (as of 2021 the last year for which data is publicly available), monthly mean temperatures at South Tarawa, the capital of Kiribati, ranged between , with maximum monthly temperatures ranging from and minimum temperatures ranging from . Caroline Island lies within a region of highly variable precipitation; between 1950 and 2010 the region received an average of of rain annually. Tides are on the order of , and trade winds, generally from the northeast, mean that corner of the island experiences the roughest seas.
Caroline Island is among the most remote islands on Earth. It is from the closest land at Flint Island, and from the nearest continental land in North America.

==Geology==
Caroline Atoll is one of over 175 atolls and coral islands in the Pacific Ocean. The English naturalist and geologist Charles Darwin first suggested the theory, still accepted, that atolls originate from calcium carbonate platforms that grow around the cones of extinct, sinking volcanoes. Caroline Atoll&#x27;s high volcanic island has subsided below sea level; the surrounding coral reef has developed upwards, built by corals, its typically annular shape caused by underwater weathering. The coral reef will continue to develop as long as it is not overtaken by rising sea levels, in which case the corals will perish and the atoll will stop growing.
The Line Islands chain is made of seamounts and ridges from the Tuamotu Islands in the south to Johnston Atoll in the north; which rise from the ocean floor from a depth of . Caroline Island is one of 12 seamounts in the chain to rise above sea level.

The igneous rocks of all the Line Islands consist of alkali basalts and hawaiites, and are similar to those found in the Hawaiian Islands. Several models have been proposed to explain the formation of the chain&#x27;s complex geology. In 1972, the American geophysicist W. Jason Morgan postulated that the chain was formed 70 myr ago in parallel with the creation of the Hawaiian Islands, each by means of a single hotspot. Other experts argued against this model, pointing to geometric and paleomagnetic evidence, and the complex timing of the volcanic episodes that created the Line Island chain. In a 1976 paper, Winterer implied that chains of volcanoes were created by a series of individual hotspots.

Over the next decade it was discovered that Late Cretaceous and Eocene volcanism had occurred close to Caroline Island, as well as thousands of kilometres to the north, which disproved the single hotspot model for the formation of the Line Islands, and instead suggested the chain was made by a more complex series of volcanic events than the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. During the 1980s, scientists put forward new theories to explain the evolution of the chain, including a transform fracture zone theory (since refuted by paleomagnetic data), and a multiple hotspot model which is still being discussed as of 2020. A combination of hotspot-transform fracture zone phenomena is also possible.

==Flora and fauna==
Despite more than three centuries of occasional human impact on Caroline Island, it is one of very few remaining near-pristine tropical islands. The United Nations rated the atoll with a &#x27;Human Impact Index&#x27; rating of 1 in 1998, making it one of the most unspoiled islands in the world. Its undisturbed state has led to a proposal that it be designated a World Heritage Site and a Biosphere Reserve. Caroline was visited in 1965 by the Pacific Ocean Biological Survey Program, in 1974 by the Line Island Expedition, and in 1988 and 1991 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Wildlife Conservation Unit. A 1991 Kiribati Government expedition, comprising personnel of the Wildlife Conservation Unit and officials of the Ministry of Line and Phoenix Islands Development, agreed that with the exception of South Islet, Long Islet, and Nake Islet, the Caroline Atoll islets should become Wildlife Sanctuaries.
In 1988, 90% of Caroline Island had vegetation; two-thirds of the vegetation was woodland, and 89% of the plant species were indigenous. Caroline&#x27;s islets are made up of seven concentric plant communities, defined by a dominant species. One community—dominated by the coconut palm—was made by humans. The other six are:
* an outermost &quot;herb mat&quot;, comprising mainly the flowering shrub &quot;Heliotropium anomalum&quot; and the succulent plant &quot;Portulaca lutea&quot;;
* &quot;Beach Shrub&quot; (shrubland), consisting of the evergreen shrub Bay cedar &quot;Suriana maritima&quot;;
* the minor plant community &quot;Pandanus Forest&quot; (consisting primarily of specimens of the &quot;Pandanus tectorius&quot; tree);
* &quot;Tournefortia Scrub and Forest&quot;, populated by &quot;Heliotropium arboreum&quot;, which dominates the wooded islets of the atoll, forming 31% of the atoll&#x27;s land area;
* &quot;Cordia Forest&quot;, dominated by the flowering tree &quot;Cordia subcordata&quot;;
* &quot;Pisonia Forest&quot;, consisting of the &quot;Pisonia grandis&quot; tree, located in the interior of the larger islets, and widely distributed throughout the atoll.

Smaller islets lack the central forest and the smallest islets are vegetated solely by low-lying herbs. Coconut palms were introduced to the atoll after it was first discovered by Europeans, and a large plantation still exists on South Islet, with palms growing to a lesser degree on Long Islet and Nake Islet.
In 2014 the Kiribati government established a fishing exclusion zone extending to 12 nautical miles around each of the southern Line Islands—Caroline, Flint, Vostok, Malden, and Starbuck.

Caroline Island is an important breeding site for several species of seabirds, most notably the sooty tern (&quot;Onychoprion fuscata&quot;), numbering around 500,000—a colony of sooty terns dominates the eastern islets—and the great frigatebird (&quot;Fregata minor&quot;), numbering over 10,000, according to estimations made in 1980. Caroline Island and Flint Island host one of the world&#x27;s largest populations of the coconut crab (&quot;Birgus latro&quot;). Other native animals include the &quot;Tridacna&quot; clam, which is abundant in the central lagoon, hermit crabs, and multiple species of lizards.

Giant clam populations reach densities up to four per square foot (43 per m2) in parts of the lagoon. The most common species is the &quot;small giant clam&quot; &quot;Tridacna maxima&quot;, and the largest clam species, &quot;Tridacna gigas&quot;, is also found in the lagoon. The lagoon is a nursery habitat for fish species, including important and heavily exploited species such as the blacktip reef shark (&quot;Carcharhinus melanopterus&quot;) and the endangered Napoleon wrasse (&quot;Cheilinus undulatus&quot;).
The atoll is designated as a wildlife sanctuary for turtle nesting. The endangered green turtle (&quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;) nests on the beaches of Caroline Island, but there have been reports of poaching by homesteaders.
Human contact has caused the introduction of about twenty non-native species of flora to Caroline Island, including the vine &quot;Ipomoea violacea&quot;, which has begun to proliferate. Domestic cats and dogs introduced alongside a small homestead have driven the seabird population away from the islet of Motu Ana-Ana.

==Environmental issues==

Caroline Island is low-lying, with no land greater than above sea level. Regional sea surface temperatures have risen by around 0.1 °C per decade since the 1950s, and in 2006, the United Nations rated the island as among those most vulnerable to rising sea levels. The UNEP reported in 2006 that Caroline could disappear &quot;within the next 3050 years&quot;.
Caroline Island has recovered from destruction caused by settlers and business opportunists. The island&#x27;s indigenous plant and animal species are thriving, and it was reported in 2010 that its coral reefs are among the most pristine in the world. The introduced coconut palm is a highly competitive plant which blocks the light and so prevents other species from growing, but is only prevalent on South Islet. Wildlife can be adversely affected by the presence of tourists or hunters, and since 1979 all animals on the island have been protected under Schedule 2 of Kiribati&#x27;s Wildlife Conservation Ordinance. As of 2014, no governmental management plan or monitoring programme for the island has been produced.

<doc id="776293" wikidata="Q338190" url="?curid=776293" title="Rodney Frelinghuysen">
<text>Rodney Procter Frelinghuysen (born April 29, 1946) is an American former politician and lobbyist who served as the U.S. representative for from 1995 to 2019. The district includes most of Morris County, an affluent suburban county west of New York City. A member of the Republican Party, Frelinghuysen served as chair of the House Appropriations Committee from 2017 to 2019. Frelinghuysen announced on January 29, 2018, that he would not seek re-election that year.

He has at times supported abortion rights and at times voted to limit access to abortion. He opposed federal funding of Planned Parenthood, and opposed sanctuary cities, gun control, gay marriage, and federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. He endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. He voted to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and replace it with the American Health Care Act (AHCA). Frelinghuysen was criticized for using a fundraising letter to &quot;[out] a member of an activist group opposing him to her employer&quot; which resulted in a complaint by the Campaign for Accountability made with the Office of Congressional Ethics.

==Early life and education==
Frelinghuysen was born in New York City to Peter Frelinghuysen Jr., a New Jersey politician and Beatrice Sterling Procter, an heir to the Procter &amp; Gamble fortune.

Frelinghuysen is a member of a family long prominent in New Jersey politics, one which was ranked the seventh greatest American political dynasty by Stephen H. Hess, senior fellow emeritus at the Brookings Institution, and author of &quot;America&#x27;s Political Dynasties&quot;.

His father, Peter Frelinghuysen Jr., served as the U.S. representative from New Jersey&#x27;s 5th congressional district from 1953 to 1975, representing much of the same area Rodney did during his time in Congress. On his father&#x27;s side, he is a great-grandson of American Sugar Refining Company founder Henry Osborne Havemeyer and great-great-great-grandson of Ballantine Brewery founder Peter Ballantine. On his mother&#x27;s side, he is a great-great-grandson of William Procter, co-founder of Procter &amp; Gamble and grandson of William Cooper Procter, the president of Procter &amp; Gamble from 1907 to 1930.

He attended St. Mark&#x27;s School, an exclusive Episcopal preparatory school in Southborough, Massachusetts. Rejected by Princeton, the alma mater of his father and grandfather, Frelinghuysen instead matriculated at Hobart College in New York. There, he served as president of the Kappa Alpha Society and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in American history in 1969.

Frelinghuysen next enrolled in a graduate program at Trinity College but was soon drafted into the United States Army. Following basic training at Fort Dix, he was assigned as a clerk to the commanding officer of the 93rd Engineer Battalion, which was primarily responsible for building roads and water supply systems in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam.

==Local and state political career==
After his military service, Frelinghuysen was hired by then-Morris County Freeholder Director Dean A. Gallo to be the county&#x27;s state and federal aid coordinator and administrative assistant. He held this position until 1974, when he was elected as a Morris County Freeholder in his own right. He served three terms on the board, the last as its director.

In 1983, Frelinghuysen was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly, representing the 25th legislative district. Frelinghuysen served in the Assembly until 1994. He was Chairman of the Assembly Appropriations Committee during the 1988–89 legislative session. In 1990 he ran in the Republican primary for New Jersey&#x27;s 12th congressional district against Dick Zimmer and Phil McConkey.

During the race, the Frelinghuysen campaign &quot;broke ground in high-tech politicking&quot; when it sent voters a seven-minute video cassette of Frelinghuysen. The video, which contained photographs of Frelinghuysen in Vietnam and praise from former Gov. Tom Kean, served as a preemptive tactic against opponents&#x27; attempts to characterize Frelinghuysen as &quot;an irrelevant debutante&quot;. Frelinghuysen finished in third place.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
In late August 1994, U.S. Congressman Dean Gallo, the six-term Republican incumbent of New Jersey&#x27;s Eleventh Congressional District, announced his intention to withdraw from the upcoming election for medical reasons (he had recently been diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer and died two days before the election). As Gallo had already defeated three opponents in a hard-fought primary the previous June, his withdrawal triggered a convention of Republican committee members from the district&#x27;s municipalities. Frelinghuysen, who had been Gallo&#x27;s former employee and fellow Morris County freeholder and state assemblyman, sought the committee&#x27;s nomination at Gallo&#x27;s request, and was chosen to be the Republican nominee for the district.

Frelinghuysen went on to defeat former Democratic State Senator Frank Herbert 71% to 28% in the November 1994 election. However, the 11th had long been one of the most Republican districts in the Northeast, and Frelinghuysen had effectively clinched a seat in Congress by winning the Republican nomination. He was reelected nine times with no substantive opposition, never dropping below 59% of the vote. He has been challenged in the Republican primary three times: in 2008, 2010, and 2014. In 2008, he defeated Kate Erber in the June primary 87% to 13%. In 2010, he defeated Richard Luzzi 76% to 24%. In 2014, he defeated Rick Van Glahn 67% to 33%. This came even as his district was made slightly friendlier to Democrats on paper after the 2010 census, when it absorbed slices of heavily Democratic Montclair, Bloomfield and West Orange. However, Frelinghuysen still had little trouble winning reelection. In addition to his district being located in the New York City market, he was helped by his seat on the Appropriations Committee. He was a chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development from 2011 to 2017 before becoming chairman of the full committee in 2017. Appropriations subcommittee chairmen are nicknamed &quot;Cardinals&quot; for their influence over the budget. It has long been considered very difficult to unseat an Appropriations Committee member at an election, especially if he or she is a &quot;Cardinal.&quot;

In 2000, progressive activist filmmaker Michael Moore attempted to have a ficus challenge Frelinghuysen&#x27;s unopposed re-election to make the point that most Members of Congress &quot;run unopposed in their primaries and 95% are re-elected every time in the general election&quot;, adding &quot;we think it&#x27;s time to point out to the Frelinghuysen family that we live in a democracy, not a dynasty.&quot;

The top sectors supporting Frelinghuysen&#x27;s campaigns have been the aerospace, defense, pharmaceutical and health care industries.

On January 29, 2018 Frelinghuysen announced that he wouldn&#x27;t run for another term in 2018.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Appropriations (Chairman)
**As chair of the full committee, Frelinghuysen sat as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of all subcommittees

===Coalitions and caucuses===
* Republican Main Street Partnership
* Republican Majority For Choice
* Republicans for Choice
* Republicans For Environmental Protection

====Legislative record====
Since the start of his congressional tenure in 1995, Frelinghuysen had been the chief sponsor of 123 bills. Of these, four have become law:
* H.R. 1366 (104th): To authorize the extension of time limitation for the FERC-issued hydroelectric license for the Mount Hope Waterpower Project.
* H.R. 459 (106th): To extend the deadline under the Federal Power Act for FERC Project No. 9401, the Mount Hope Waterpower Project.
* H.R. 1964 (108th): Highlands Conservation Act
* H.R. 4850 (108th): District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2005

He had been the chief sponsor of nine resolutions, none of which passed. He introduced an amendment to the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013, the initial Hurricane Sandy relief legislation, which added $33.7 billion to the $17 billion initially allocated by the act. The amendment passed the House in a 228–192 vote, with the support of 38 Republicans and 190 Democrats. The amended act was not significantly modified by the Senate, and was signed into law.

==Political positions==
As of January 2018, Frelinghuysen had voted with his party in 95.4% of votes during the 115th United States Congress and voted in line with President Trump&#x27;s position in 90.2% of the votes. From the start of his tenure in the 104th Congress to the current 113th, Frelinghuysen has voted with his party 90% of the time.

Frelinghuysen&#x27;s voting record has been described as moderate. He was a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership. During the 2012 election season, Frelinghuysen rejected claims from Planned Parenthood leaders and progressive activists that he &quot;toes the line of Republican leadership&quot; and had aligned himself with the Tea Party movement.

As Frelinghuysen had been less conservative than many members of the Republican caucus, he was elevated to the Appropriations Committee chairship only based on his assurance to the conservatives that he would be willing to set aside his personal views to implement party policy. One conservative on the committee, Representative Robert Aderholt, said, &quot;One of the things we had discussed going into this, when he wanted to take the chairmanship, was that at the end of the day he understood that when he was negotiating these bills he&#x27;d be negotiating on behalf of his conference, as opposed to his own philosophy.&quot;

In a tele-townhall on March 20, 2017, he stated that was &quot;not sold&quot; on attempts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare) and had not seen any evidence to support claims that President Trump was wiretapped during the campaign. He believes Trump should release his tax returns, but does not support attempts to compel their release, adding &quot;I need to support the Chair&#x27;s ruling regardless of what the issue is.&quot;

===Abortion===
Frelinghuysen was a member of Republican Majority For Choice and Republicans for Choice. In 2017, he voted against the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would have implemented a national ban on abortions performed after 20 weeks of gestation.

From 2010 to 2012, his NARAL rating averaged 7%. He and fellow New Jersey Republican Leonard Lance were singled out by NARAL President Nancy Keenan over their support of H.R. 3 &quot;No Taxpayer Funding for Abortions Act&quot;. Frelinghuysen voted in 2015 to strip all federal funding from Planned Parenthood, despite having opposed similar measures in 2011, 2009 and 2007. He cited the Planned Parenthood 2015 undercover videos controversy for his change in position.

===Economy and budget===
In October 2017, Frelinghuysen was the only representative from New Jersey to vote in favor of a Republican budget resolution that would increase the federal deficit by $1.5 trillion. He said he voted &quot;for the budget resolution to get my appropriations bills done&quot; and that he would &quot;evaluate tax reform when I see the details.&quot; In December 2017, Frelinghuysen voted against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

Frelinghuysen was a supporter of earmarking, calling the practice a &quot;constitutional responsibility.&quot; He consistently ranks in the top 5% in terms of dollars procured. In fiscal year 2008 he ranked 21st, sponsoring or co-sponsoring 44 earmarks totaling $88 million; in fiscal year 2009 he ranked 12th, with 45 earmarks totaling $119 million; and in fiscal year 2010 he ranked 21st with 39 earmarks totaling $76 million. During the same period, Frelinghuysen was the top earmarker among New Jersey lawmakers. The majority of his earmarks were for defense-related expenses.

===Environment===
Frelinghuysen&#x27;s environmental position, as measured by the League of Conservation Voters annual &quot;Environmental National Scorecard&quot;, was largely centrist from 1995 to 2008, averaging 55%. Beginning in 2009, his environmental record veered sharply negative, averaging just 14% over the next nine years, through 2017. In 2017 Frelinghuysen was given a rating of 9%, the lowest of any New Jersey congressional representative. As of 2017, Frelinghuysen&#x27;s lifetime LCV Scorecard score was 33%.

In May 2003, Frelinghuysen introduced H.R. 1964, the Highlands Conservation Act, a bill that recognized &quot;the importance of the water, forest, agricultural, wildlife, recreational, and cultural resources of the Highlands region, and the national significance of the Highlands region to the United States&quot;, and authorized up to $10 million a year in federal matching funds for land preservation and protection in the Highlands states (Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut), as well as $1 million a year for United States Forest Service research and technical assistance programs. In November, 2004, George W. Bush signed the Highlands Conservation Act into law. In 2014, Congress failed to re-authorize the Act and the program expired.

As of May 2014 Frelinghuysen was one of eight Republican members of Congress who &quot;accept the prevailing scientific conclusion that global warming is both real and man-made,&quot; according to PolitiFact. However, he opposes federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. The Sunlight Foundation pointed out that among the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, Frelinghuysen has the third-highest amount of investment in oil stocks.
===Health care===
He favored repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), and voted in support of the budget resolution to repeal Obamacare in January 2017. In March 2017, when the Republican leadership was seeking support for the &quot;repeal-and-replace&quot; bill, the American Health Care Act (AHCA), he announced that he would oppose it on the grounds that it &quot;would place significant new costs and barriers to care on my constituents in New Jersey&quot; and would result in a &quot;loss of Medicaid coverage for so many people in my Medicaid-dependent state.&quot; On May 4, 2017, he voted for a revised version of the AHCA, although the provisions he had previously cited as objectionable were unchanged. He said that he &quot;voted for an improved health care act&quot;.

Frelinghuysen stressed the need to &quot;protect those with pre-existing conditions&quot;, but according to NJ.com, the bill &quot;would allow for exemptions from rules preventing those with pre-existing conditions from being charged more for their insurance. It also would allow states to request waivers from federal requirements that all insurers cover specific benefits such as hospitalization, mental health treatment and maternity care.&quot; Asked why he voted for the bill without waiting for an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office on its impact, Frelinghuysen said, &quot;I think there was a feeling that we needed to act and get the bill to the Senate so we can get them to act on it.&quot;

===Immigration===
Frelinghuysen had opposed sanctuary cities.

As Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, he was part of the 29 representatives voting to send the 2018 Homeland Security appropriations bill to the full House. Among other funding, the bill includes $5 billion in funding for Trump&#x27;s border wall. Referring to the bill, Frelinghuysen stated the bill &quot;provides the necessary funding for critical technology and physical barriers to secure our borders&quot;.

===Donald Trump===
Frelinghuysen endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

===Other issues===
Frelinghuysen had been in favor of auditing the Federal Reserve, and supported the Iraq War. He opposes same-sex marriage, and has voted against legislation which would establish net neutrality, which refers to the principle that Internet service providers cannot discriminate by user, content, website, or platform, and has voted in favor of legislation that would require photo IDs for voting in federal elections.

He had a &quot;D&quot; rating from NORML regarding his voting record on cannabis-related matters. He twice voted against providing veterans access to medical marijuana via their Veterans Health Administration doctor&#x27;s recommendation. He blocked a vote on an amendment that would have given banks the ability to lend to legal, state-regulated marijuana businesses without having to worry about subsequent punishment by federal financial regulators.

He was one of the 24 Republicans (and 227 Democrats) to vote &quot;yes&quot; on the 2008 effort to impeach President George W. Bush for misleading the United States into going to war in Iraq.

==Town halls and criticism of activist==
Frelinghuysen, who has not appeared at a public town hall since 2013, prefers small events at schools, community groups, and veteran organizations, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Since the 2016 election, a grassroots activist group called NJ 11th for Change has organized demonstrations and town halls in an effort to get a face-to-face between Frelinghuysen and his constituents.

In 2017, Frelinghuysen wrote a campaign fundraising letter to a board member of a local bank. While Frelinghuysen did not name NJ 11th for Change, a progressive lobbying group, he included a handwritten postscript warning &quot;One of the ringleaders works in your bank!&quot;, with an attached news article about one of NJ 11th for Change&#x27;s members. The individual subsequently resigned from her position as assistant general counsel and senior vice president at that bank, citing pressure over her political involvement as one of the reasons.

According to a lawyer and former staffer for the Office of Congressional Ethics, to be unlawful such a letter would need to threaten action or be written on congressional stationery, not campaign letterhead, and/or the bank would have to have business pending before a Frelinghuysen committee. The progressive lobbying group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) opined that &quot;whether or not [Frelinghuysen&#x27;s letter] breaks a criminal statute is one issue, but the very clear issue is that it appears that a member of Congress might be using his power to threaten someone&#x27;s employment because of their political activities.&quot; Richard W. Painter, a professor of law at the University of Minnesota and former chief White House ethics lawyer to President George W. Bush, described Frelinghuysen&#x27;s actions as &quot;not illegal but an awful thing to do.&quot;

Nonprofit ethics watchdog Campaign for Accountability filed a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics requesting an investigation into whether Frelinghuysen violated House ethics rules in his letter to the board member of the bank. Anyone can file a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics; the office reviews complaints from the public and can choose to refer those it considers valid to the House Ethics Committee.
Frelinghuysen hired lawyers following the complaint.

== Lobbying career ==
In 2021, Frelinghuysen registered as a foreign agent on behalf of Tatiana Clouthier, the Secretary of the Economy of Mexico. As a member of lobbying firm and law firm Greenberg Traurig, he and the firm &quot;technical advice, analysis and strategy on foreign trade that address and promote Mexico&#x27;s interests&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
In June 2013, Frelinghuysen was awarded the Navy Distinguished Public Service Award, the Navy&#x27;s highest civilian honor, for the &quot;long and selfless service&quot; he had provided to the force, ensuring it had necessary resources and supporting its members&#x27; quality of life.

Frelinghuysen was awarded the Vietnam Service Medal for his service during the Vietnam War.

==Personal life==
At the start of the 112th Congress, Frelinghuysen was ranked the ninth wealthiest member of congress, with an estimated personal wealth between $20 million and $65 million.

A &quot;Roll Call&quot; report on Frelinghuysen&#x27;s wealth in 2010 indicated that about a third stemmed from personal and family trust investments in Procter &amp; Gamble stock. He owns multiple properties, including nearly 18 acres of undeveloped land in Frelinghuysen Township, New Jersey.

On May 24, 2007, Frelinghuysen chased down a pickpocket who had stolen his wallet near his home in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Two Washington police officers saw the chase and arrested the 18-year-old suspect who had been caught by the 61-year-old congressman.

He and his wife Virginia have two daughters, Louisine and Sarah.

Frelinghuysen is an Episcopalian.

<text>Thomas F. Cheek (June 13, 1939 – October 9, 2005) was an American sports commentator who is best remembered as the play-by-play radio announcer for the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB), from the team&#x27;s establishment in 1977 until his retirement in 2004. During that time, he covered a 27-year streak of 4,306 consecutive games plus 41 post-season games—from the first Blue Jays game on April 7, 1977, until June 3, 2004. He was inducted to the Blue Jays Level of Excellence in 2004.

Cheek&#x27;s best-known call was perhaps his description of Joe Carter&#x27;s dramatic title-clinching home run in Game 6 of the 1993 World Series, when he said, &quot;Touch &#x27;em all, Joe, you&#x27;ll never hit a bigger home run in your life!&quot; He is also author of the book &quot;Road to Glory&quot;, chronicling the first 16 years of Blue Jays baseball.

Cheek received the 2013 Ford C. Frick Award after being nominated as a finalist for the award every year since 2005.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born and raised in the west side of Pensacola, Florida, Cheek, an avid sports fan, was given his first tape recorder at age 14, which inspired his interest in broadcasting.

His father, also named Tom Cheek, was a well known United States Naval Aviator in World War II and a recipient of the Navy Cross at the Battle of Midway.

From 1957 to 1960, Tom Cheek (the son) served in the United States Air Force, where he spent a year in Morocco as a teletype operator with the Strategic Air Command as an airman third class. During this time he was introduced to New York Yankees broadcaster Red Barber. Following his discharge in 1960, he attended the Cambridge School of Broadcasting in Boston for two years.

===Early broadcasting years===
Cheek began his radio broadcasting career in Plattsburgh, New York, as a disc jockey on WEAV in 1962. He then moved to Burlington, Vermont, where he worked for WDOT and was quickly promoted to corporate sales manager and sports director. He later moved from music to sports broadcasting when he moved to WJOY, where his on-air sports work included baseball, basketball, football and hockey for the University of Vermont.

In 1968, he was almost hired as the first broadcaster for the newly formed Atlanta Hawks of the NBA, but Skip Caray was chosen instead.

The newly formed Montreal Expos were looking for an announcer to complement their primary play-by-play man, Dave Van Horne. Burlington, although traditionally a Boston Red Sox town, was warming up to the new expansion team as it was only from Montreal. When it was decided the Expos would use a guest announcer format, Cheek got his first broadcast experience in Major League Baseball, filling in there occasionally from 1974 to 1976.

===Toronto Blue Jays===

Beginning in 1977, Cheek became the first full-time announcer for the Toronto Blue Jays alongside his first broadcast partner, Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Early Wynn, who remained with him through the end of 1980. Wynn was replaced by Jerry Howarth in 1981.

For the next 23 years, &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; were the radio voices of the Blue Jays, covering the team&#x27;s rise through the 1980s and culminating with their back-to-back World Series Championships in 1992 and 1993. They were joined by color commentator Gary Matthews in 2000 and 2001.

Cheek&#x27;s Blue Jays broadcasts originated from Toronto&#x27;s CKFH &quot;The Fan&quot; 1430, founded by another legendary Toronto sports broadcaster, Hockey Hall of Fame member Foster Hewitt. For a brief period, the broadcast was heard on 1050 CHUM; but following the Blue Jays&#x27; purchase by Rogers Communications, reverted to &quot;The Fan&quot;, which had changed its call sign and frequency to CJCL 590 AM, also known as FAN 590.

Cheek called many memorable moments in Blue Jays history, including many firsts; the Blue Jays&#x27; division-clinching game in 1985, and both final plays of the 1992 and 1993 World Series—the latter of which spawned his famous &quot;Touch &#x27;em all, Joe!&quot; quote, when Joe Carter clinched the World Series on a walk-off home run for only the second time in World Series history.

====&quot;The Streak&quot;====
Cheek announced every Blue Jays game from their inaugural game at Exhibition Stadium, in Toronto, on April 7, 1977, until June 3, 2004, when he took two games off following the death of his father—a streak of 4,306 consecutive regular season and 41 postseason games. On August 9, 2004, the Jays raised a banner to SkyDome&#x27;s (now the Rogers Centre) &quot;Level of Excellence&quot; bearing Cheek&#x27;s name and, in place of a jersey number, 4,306—his streak of straight regular-season broadcasts.

===Other broadcasting activities===
Cheek was a member of the broadcast team for ABC Sports at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, and at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo.

===Illness and death===
A week after his consecutive game streak ended, Cheek was forced to take time off to undergo surgery on June 12, 2004, to remove a brain tumor. Following the surgery, Cheek was able to call some Blue Jays home games while undergoing chemotherapy, but was replaced on the road by various guest announcers. For a time, it seemed he had recovered and would be able to resume calling Blue Jays games in 2005. However, the cancer returned and he required further treatment at Toronto&#x27;s Mount Sinai Hospital and Toronto Western Hospital.

Cheek sat in with the new commentator, Canadian-born former minor league baseball infielder/outfielder Warren Sawkiw, and Howarth, to call an inning of the Blue Jays&#x27; 2005 opening game in Tampa Bay. This would be Cheek&#x27;s final broadcast appearance.

Cheek died on October 9, 2005, at age 66 in Oldsmar, Florida. He was interred in the Sylvan Abbey Memorial Park in Clearwater, Florida.

==Personal life==
Cheek married his wife, Shirley, of Hemmingford, Quebec, in 1959. They had three children—Jeff, Lisa, and Tom—and seven grandchildren at the time of his death. Jeff was a pitcher in the Blue Jays organization from 1992 to 1994.

==Awards and honors==
Cheek was inducted into the Blue Jays Level of Excellence in 2004 with the number &quot;4306&quot; next to his name, signifying his broadcasting streak. Shortly before his death, Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame established the Tom Cheek Media Leadership Award for &quot;playing a key role in promoting Canadian sports&quot;; Cheek himself was the recipient of the first award. During the 2006 season, the Blue Jays wore a white circular sewn-on patch with the letters &quot;TC&quot;, and a radio microphone in black, beside the letters on their uniform sleeves in tribute to Cheek.

For nine straight years (2005–2013), Cheek was among the ten finalists for the Ford C. Frick Award by the National Baseball Hall of Fame, an award presented each year, during the Hall&#x27;s induction weekend, to a broadcaster for &quot;major contributions to baseball&quot;. He received the 2013 award on December 5, 2012.

<doc id="776311" wikidata="Q3845314" url="?curid=776311" title="Maratonistas de Coamo">
<text>The Maratonistas de Coamo (English: Coamo Marathon Runners) was a Puerto Rican professional basketball team based in Coamo, that competed in the National Superior Basketball (BSN) league from 1985 until 2015 when the team was sold and was relocated to Aguada as the Santeros. It is now a member of the Liga de Baloncesto Puertorriqueña, and recently won the LBP championship. Their home court was the Edwin &quot;Puruco&quot; Nolasco Coliseum.

The team was established as the Cardenales de Rio Piedras (Rio Piedras Cardinals) in 1940. They relocated in 1985 to the town of Coamo in central Puerto Rico. As the Cardinals, the franchise advanced to the BSN Finals 15 times, and won six BSN Championships. In Coamo, the Maratonistas advanced to their first and only finals berth in 2004, appearing there for the sixteenth time in franchise history and first since 1977, when the club was based in Río Piedras. The team ended up losing to the Ponce Lions in seven games.

==Franchise history==

===1940s-1985: Cardenales de Río Piedras===

The Maratonistas&#x27; previous incarnation, the Cardenales de Río Piedras, were formed in the 1940s. Early in their history they appeared in several Finals, winning their first championship in 1946 against the Capitanes de Arecibo. From 1955 to 1957, the team won three championships in a row. The team kept enjoying success during the following years, reaching the Finals in three more occasions (1959, 1960, 1962).

The team won a championship in 1963 led by players like Juan Báez and others. After that, the team reached the Finals four more times. During the 1970s, the team played their home games at Rubén Zayas Montañez Court.

The Cardenales would win another historic championship in 1976 beating the favorite Piratas de Quebradillas. The team, owned by attorney and engineer Rene Aponte Caratini, was one of the best in the league&#x27;s history. Their roster included center Earl Brown, and guards Butch Lee and the legendary Freddie &quot;Meteor&quot; Lugo. They would return to the finals in 1977 and lose to the Piratas in a thriller.

In 1985, the Cardenales de Río Piedras were relocated to Coamo under the name of the Maratonistas de Coamo.

===1985-1998: First decade and relocations===

After their relocation to Coamo, the Maratonistas enjoyed some success with the arrival of players like Dean Borges, Darryl Cambrelén, William &quot;Memo&quot; Reveron, Gerald Lebron Arrufat, Pablito Alicea, and Joao &quot;Pipoca&quot; Vianna, among others.

However, in 1996, the team was relocated again to Villalba, under the name of Avancinos de Villalba. The team remained in Villalba for three years.

===1999-2008: Return to Coamo and resurgence===

In 1999, the team returned to Coamo under the ownership of Fernando Ortíz. The team included young players like Carlos Escalera, Miguel Ali Berdiel, Christian Dalmau, and NCAA prospect Filiberto Rivera.

In 2004, the Maratonistas had their best season to date. Two of their players, Gabriel Mouneke and Carlos Escalera, were selected Most Valuable Player and Most Improved Player respectively. Coamo reached the BSN Finals against the Leones de Ponce, but lost on a seventh game to Ponce.

In 2008, the team was forced to recess due to financial problems.

===2011-2015===

In 2011, the team returned to the league led by 2007 Rookie of the Year Johwen Villegas.

In 2013, it was announced the team would return to league competition in 2014 after a two-year absence.

In 2015, the team was sold and relocated as the Santeros de Aguada.

<doc id="776318" wikidata="Q6183773" url="?curid=776318" title="Jerry Howarth">
<text>Jerry Howarth (born March 12, 1946) is an American Canadian former sports commentator, best known as the radio play-by-play voice of the Toronto Blue Jays from 1981 through the 2017 season.

Howarth had shared the play-by-play duties with his late longtime broadcast partner Tom Cheek from 1982 until 2005, then served as the play-by-play announcer until announcing his retirement before the start of spring training 2018 due to ongoing health concerns.

==Early career==
Born in York, Pennsylvania, and raised in San Francisco, California, Howarth grew up an avid sports fan. He graduated with a degree in Economics from the University of Santa Clara in 1968, then served two years as an officer in the U.S. Army. He launched his career as a sportscaster in 1974 by calling play-by-play action for AAA baseball&#x27;s Tacoma Twins of the Pacific Coast League, as well as basketball and football for the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington.

In 1976, Howarth became the play-by-play voice of the Salt Lake City Gulls, also of the Pacific Coast League. Howarth was then hired as the Assistant General Manager and performed double duty as play-by-play man for the Utah Pros of the short-lived Western Basketball Association. Howarth was then hired as Group Sales Director by the NBA&#x27;s Utah Jazz before joining KWMS radio in Salt Lake as the station&#x27;s sports talk show host.

==Toronto Blue Jays==
===The Tom and Jerry era===
In 1981, Howarth split his time between his radio duties in Salt Lake and his new career in Toronto. He worked part of the 1981 Blue Jays season as a commentator along with Early Wynn for CJCL, part of the Hewpax Sports Network that owned the Jays’ radio rights at the time. Starting in the 1982 season, he replaced Wynn and joined Tom Cheek as his full-time play-by-play partner. For the next 23 years, &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; would be the radio voices of the Blue Jays. Their partnership covered the rise of the Blue Jays through the 1980s, culminating with back to back World Series Championships in 1992 and 1993. 

On June 3, 2004, Cheek missed calling a Blue Jays game for the first time in 27 years, because his father died. He returned to the booth a week later only to miss more games when he was hospitalized and had a brain tumour removed. He was diagnosed with brain cancer, but continued to broadcast with Howarth during home games, taking a few innings off to rest during these games. Cheek&#x27;s health continued to deteriorate, eventually forcing him to discontinue his broadcasting career after the end of the 2004 Toronto Blue Jays season. Cheek died on 9 October 2005. 

===Play-by-play broadcaster===
As it became clear in early 2005 that Cheek would not be coming back, Howarth became the play-by-play broadcaster for Blue Jays games at this time and Warren Sawkiw filled in as analyst. Sawkiw continued to work alongside Howarth through the end of the 2006 Blue Jays season. In 2007, Sawkiw was replaced in the booth by former Blue Jay catcher Alan Ashby. Howarth continued to be the lead voice of the Toronto Blue Jays with Ashby serving as game analyst, until the end of the 2012 season. Howarth next worked alongside former Jays pitcher and World Series champion Jack Morris during the 2013 season. After one season, Morris was replaced by Joe Siddall who worked with Horwarth from 2014 through to 2017. During this time, Mike Wilner, host of the &quot;Blue Jays Talk&quot; radio show, also provided play-by-play for some innings. Duane Ward supplied colour commentary for some games during the 2014 and 2015 season and Kevin Barker supplied colour for some games during the 2016 season.

===Nickname controversy and retirement===
In October 2016, prior to the American League Championship Series between Toronto and Cleveland, Howarth revealed — in an interview on CJCL radio — that in 1992, he had quietly taken a vow to not use team nicknames or expressions on-air that he considered to be offensive to aboriginal Canadians or Native Americans, such as the Atlanta Braves and Cleveland Indians. He began the practice after receiving a letter from a listener who was a member of a First Nation group, whose writer explained that the names were offensive. Howarth felt the letter was written &quot;in such a loving, kind way&quot; and that it had &quot;touched [his] heart&quot;, which led him to respect their wishes. Renu Mandhane, chief commissioner of the Ontario Human Rights Commission, supported Howarth&#x27;s position, and called upon other media outlets to stop using the name in the wake of Cleveland&#x27;s playoff series.

On November 16, 2016, it was announced that Howarth had been diagnosed with prostate cancer, and that he would undergo surgery in the following week to remove a small tumor from his prostate. For health reasons, Howarth decided to retire from broadcasting in February 2018.

==Personal==
Howarth, who became a Canadian citizen in 1994, lives in Toronto with his wife Mary. They have two sons, Joe lives in Toronto, and Ben lives in Chicago.

Howarth coached high school basketball for 20 years at Etobicoke Collegiate Institute. He is also known for his active support and fund raising efforts on behalf of the Special Olympics.

==Awards==
* On August 11, 2012, Howarth was awarded the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame&#x27;s Jack Graney Award.

<doc id="776322" wikidata="Q1752878" url="?curid=776322" title="Non-rapid eye movement sleep">
<text>Non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM), also known as quiescent sleep, is, collectively, sleep stages 1–3, previously known as stages 1–4. Rapid eye movement sleep (REM) is not included. There are distinct electroencephalographic and other characteristics seen in each stage. Unlike REM sleep, there is usually little or no eye movement during these stages. Dreaming occurs during both sleep states, and muscles are not paralyzed as in REM sleep. People who do not go through the sleeping stages properly get stuck in NREM sleep, and because muscles are not paralyzed a person may be able to sleepwalk. According to studies, the mental activity that takes place during NREM sleep is believed to be thought-like, whereas REM sleep includes hallucinatory and bizarre content. NREM sleep is characteristic of dreamer-initiated friendliness, compared to REM sleep where it is more aggressive, implying that NREM is in charge of simulating friendly interactions. The mental activity that occurs in NREM and REM sleep is a result of two different mind generators, which also explains the difference in mental activity. In addition, there is a parasympathetic dominance during NREM. The reported differences between the REM and NREM activity are believed to arise from differences in the memory stages that occur during the two types of sleep.

==Stages==
NREM sleep was divided into four stages in the Rechtschaffen and Kales (R&amp;K) standardization of 1968. That has been reduced to three in the 2007 update by The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM).
* Stage 1 – occurs mostly in the beginning of sleep, with slow eye movement. This state is sometimes referred to as relaxed wakefulness. Alpha waves disappear and the theta wave appears. People aroused from this stage often believe that they have been fully awake. During the transition into stage-1 sleep, it is common to experience hypnic jerks. 
* Stage 2 – no eye movement occurs, and dreaming is very rare. The sleeper is quite easily awakened. EEG recordings tend to show characteristic &quot;sleep spindles&quot;, which are short bursts of high frequency brain activity, and &quot;K-complexes&quot; during this stage.
* Stage 3 – previously divided into stages 3 and 4, is deep sleep, slow-wave sleep (SWS). Stage 3 was formerly the transition between stage 2 and stage 4 where delta waves, associated with &quot;deep&quot; sleep, began to occur, while delta waves dominated in stage 4. In 2007, these were combined into just stage 3 for all of deep sleep. Dreaming is more common in this stage than in other stages of NREM sleep though not as common as in REM sleep. The content of SWS dreams tends to be disconnected, less vivid, and less memorable than those that occur during REM sleep. This is also the stage during which parasomnias most commonly occur.

==Sleep spindles and K-complexes==
Sleep spindles are unique to NREM sleep. The most spindle activity occurs at the beginning and the end of NREM. Sleep spindles involve activation in the brain in the areas of the thalamus, anterior cingulate and insular cortices, and the superior temporal gyri. They have different lengths. There are slow spindles in the range of 11 – 13 Hz that are associated with increased activity in the superior frontal gyrus, and fast spindles in the range of 13 – 15 Hz that are associated with recruitment of sensorimotor processing cortical regions, as well as recruitment of the mesial frontal cortex and hippocampus. There is no clear answer as to what these sleep spindles mean, but ongoing research hopes to illuminate their function.

K-complexes are single long delta waves that last for only a second. They are also unique to NREM sleep. They appear spontaneously across the early stages, usually in the second stage, much like the sleep spindles. However, unlike sleep spindles, they can be voluntarily induced by transient noises such as a knock at the door. The function of these K-complexes is unknown and further research needs to be conducted.

==Dreaming==
Although study participants&#x27; reports of intense dream vividness during REM sleep and increased recollection of dreams occurring during that phase suggest that dreaming most commonly occurs during that stage, dreaming can also occur during NREM sleep, in which dreams tend to be more mundane in comparison. It was initially thought that NREM sleep is the absence of dreaming, or dreams occur more rarely compared to REM sleep because 90–95% of those who wake up in the middle of REM sleep will report that they have had a dream, but only 5–10% of those waking up in the middle of non-REM sleep will report they&#x27;ve had a dream. However, when asked for more general thought processes or feelings, 70% of people who awaken from NREM sleep reports of having dream-like feelings, which is characteristic of NREM dreams, potentially disproving that theory.

Research has also shown that dreams during the NREM stage most commonly occur during the morning hours which is also the time period with the highest occurrence of REM sleep. This was found through a study involving subjects taking naps over specific intervals of time and being forcefully awakened, their sleep was separated into naps including only REM sleep and only NREM sleep using polysomnography. This implies that the polysomnographic occurrence of REM sleep is not required for dreaming. Rather, the actual mechanisms that create REM sleep cause changes to one&#x27;s sleep experience. Through these changes, by morning, a sub-cortical activation occurs during NREM that is comparable to the type that occurs during REM. It is this sub-cortical activation that results in dreaming during the NREM stage during the morning hours.

=== Self in dreaming ===
It is suggested that dreaming involves two selfs: aggressive self (REM) and friendly self (NREM). It seems that in NREM dreams, the self is put in different situations, largely negative, but is found to respond in a way that befriends or embraces the unfamiliar. It is sometimes thought that in NREM sleep, the dreamers are &quot;aware of being aware&quot;, also known as &quot;secondary awareness&quot;, which allows them to make better decisions and potentially reflect on them.

==Muscle movements==
During non-REM sleep, the tonic drive to most respiratory muscles of the upper airway is inhibited. This has two consequences:
# The upper airway becomes more floppy.
# The rhythmic innervation results in weaker muscle contractions because the intracellular calcium levels are lowered, as the removal of tonic innervation hyperpolarizes motoneurons, and consequently, muscle cells.

However, because the diaphragm is largely driven by the autonomous system, it is relatively spared of non-REM inhibition. As such, the suction pressures it generates stay the same. This narrows the upper airway during sleep, increasing resistance and making airflow through the upper airway turbulent and noisy. For example, one way to determine whether a person is sleeping is to listen to their breathing - once the person falls asleep, their breathing becomes noticeably louder. Not surprisingly, the increased tendency of the upper airway to collapse during breathing in sleep can lead to snoring, a vibration of the tissues in the upper airway. This problem is exacerbated in overweight people when sleeping on the back, as extra fat tissue may weigh down on the airway, closing it. This can lead to sleep apnea.

==Parasomnias==

The occurrence of parasomnias is very common in the last stage of NREM sleep. Parasomnias are sleep behaviors that affect the function, quality, or timing of sleep, caused by a physiological activation in which the brain is caught between the stages of falling asleep and waking. The autonomous nervous system, cognitive process, and motor system are activated during sleep or while the person wakes up from sleep.

Some examples of parasomnias are somnambulism (sleep walking), somniloquy (sleep talking), sleep eating, nightmares or night terrors, sleep paralysis, and sexsomnia (or &quot;sleep sex&quot;). Many of these have a genetic component, and can be quite damaging to the person with the behavior or their bed partner. Parasomnias are most common in children, but most children have been found to outgrow them with age. However, if not outgrown, they can cause other serious problems with everyday life.

==Polysomnography==
Polysomnography (PSG) is a test used in the study of sleep; the test result is called a polysomnogram. Below are images of the NREM stages 1, 2 and 3.

The figures represent 30-second epochs (30 seconds of data). They represent data from both eyes, EEG, chin, microphone, EKG, legs, nasal/oral air flow, thermistor, thoracic effort, abdominal effort, oximetry, and body position, in that order. EEG is highlighted by the red box. Sleep spindles in the stage 2 figure are underlined in red.

Stage N2: 
Stage N3:
==Slow-wave sleep==

Slow-wave sleep (SWS) is made up of the deepest stage of NREM, and is often referred to as deep sleep.

The highest arousal thresholds (e.g. difficulty of awakening, such as by a sound of a particular volume) are observed in stage 3. A person will typically feel groggy when awakened from this stage, and indeed, cognitive tests administered after awakening from stage 3 indicate that mental performance is somewhat impaired for periods up to 30 minutes or so, relative to awakenings from other stages. This phenomenon has been called &quot;sleep inertia.&quot;

After sleep deprivation there is usually a sharp rebound of SWS, suggesting there is a &quot;need&quot; for this stage.

Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) is a highly active state unlike a state of brain quiescence as previously thought. Brain imaging data has shown that during NREM sleep the regional brain activity is influenced by the waking experience just passed.

A study was done involving an experimental and a control group to have them learn to navigate a 3D maze. The blood flow in the parahippocampal gyrus increased in conjunction with the individual&#x27;s performance through the 3D maze. Participants were then trained in the maze for 4 hours and later, during the various sleep cycles of NREM sleep, REM sleep and wakefulness, they were scanned twelve times using a PET scan during the night. The PET scan demonstrated a higher blood flow in the hippocampus during SWS/NREM sleep due to the training from the previous day while the control group exhibited no increased blood flow and they had not received the training the prior day. The brain activity during sleep, according to this study, would show the events of the previous day do make a difference. One theory suggests a model of hippocampal-neocortical dialogue. &quot;Two stages of hippocampal activity have been proposed, the first being the recording of the memory during waking and the second involving the playback of the memory during NREM sleep. This process of reactivation of memory firing sequences is believed to gradually reinforce initially weak connections between neocortical sites allowing the original information to be activated in the cortex independently of the hippocampus, and thus ensuring refreshed encoding capacity of the hippocampus.&quot; Maquet concluded that the areas of the brain involved with information processing and memory have increased brain activity during the slow wave sleep period. Events experienced in the previous day have more efficient and clearer memory recall the next day thus indicating that the memory regions of the brain are activated during SWS/NREM sleep instead of being dormant as previously thought.

NREM SWS, also known as slow wave activity (SWA), is regarded as highly important in brain development due not only to its homeostatic behavior but also because of its distinct correlation with age. Children sleep longer and deeper than adults. The difference in depth of sleep has been quantified by EEG recordings of SWA. An increase in SWA peaks just before puberty and exponentially decreases from adolescence to adulthood in both longitudinal and cross-sectional studies of typically developing participants. This phenomenon is understood as memories and learned skills being metabolized during NREM sleep; the decrease in SWA is considered a reflection of synaptic rewiring and, therefore, an effect of behavioral maturation concluding. The critical period from childhood to emerging adulthood is also considered a sensitive period for mental disorders to manifest. For example, children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a brain disorder that affects cognitive and motor control, have shown considerably different cortical thickening trajectories in contrast with typically developing children per MRI data. Cortical thickness is a common measure of brain maturation; the main difference in children with ADHD shows a delay in cortical thickness, specifically in the frontal lobe. Significant correlations in the trajectory of gray matter thickness and SWA suggest that SWA may be able to indicate levels of cortical maturation on an individual level. However, there has yet to be a study in which the diagnosis of ADHD can be given directly from SWA readings.

== Memory ==
Non-rapid eye movement sleep is known for its beneficial effect on memory consolidation, especially for declarative memory (while procedural memory improvement is more associated with REM-sleep), even if establishing a clear-cut distinction between stages&#x27; influence on type of learning may not be possible.

Generally, both REM and NREM are associated with an increased memory performance, because newly encoded memories are reactivated and consolidated during sleep.

NREM sleep has been demonstrated to be intimately correlated with declarative memory consolidation in various studies, where subject slept after a declarative memory-task; these who had a sleep imbued of NREM stages, had a better performance after the nap or the night, compared to subjects who have been awake or had more REM-sleep.

The importance of NREM sleep in memory consolidation has also been demonstrated using cueing; in this paradigm, while participants are sleeping and are in NREM sleep stages, cues are proposed (which can be, for example, aurally-presented sounds or words, odors, and so on). The fact that this procedure was effective on the improvement of the later memory performance, indicates that during these stages, there is a reactivation of the memory traces and a subsequent consolidation, which are facilitated by the cues; importantly, this does not work if the cueing is presented when subjects are awake or in REM stages.

Furthermore, the specific and crucial role of SWS (Slow-Wave Sleep, a stage of NREM sleep) in memory consolidation has been demonstrated in a study where, through electrical stimulations, slow oscillations were induced and boosted; because of this SWA increase, participants had a better performance in declarative memory tasks. Not only SWA helps learning, but it is also crucial, because its suppression has been demonstrated to impair declarative memory consolidation.

On the other hand, sleep spindles (especially associated with N2 NREM sleep stage, but can also occur during N3 NREM sleep stage) are also crucial for declarative consolidation; indeed they are enhanced (increasing in density) after declarative learning, their increase is associated with a better memory performance (which has been proved using pharmacological manipulation of spindles&#x27; density, and measuring outcomes on learning tasks).

=== A working model of sleep and memory stabilization ===
Schreiner and Rasch (2017) proposed a model illustrating how the cueing beneficial effect on memory during sleep could function, which includes theta and gamma waves and sleep spindles.

Increased theta activity represents the successful reestablishment of the memory after the cueing: if such an increase is observed, it means that the association between the cue and the memory trace is strong enough, and that the cue is presented in an effective way and time. Theta waves interacts with gamma activity, and - during NREM - this oscillatory theta-gamma produces the relocation of the memory representation, from the hippocampus to the cortex. On the other hand, sleep spindles increase occurs right after or in parallel to the theta augmentation, and is a necessary mechanism for the stabilization, the reinforcement and also the integration of the newly encoded memory trace.

Importantly, in this working model, slow oscillations have the role of a &#x27;time-giving pace maker&#x27;, and seem to be a prerequisite for the success of cueing.

According to this model, enhancing only slow waves or only spindles, is not sufficient to improve memory function of sleep: both need to be increased to obtain an influence and this latter.

== NREM in other animals ==
Not much is known about NREM, so scientists have conducted studies in other animals to potentially understand more, in particular why the brain has evolved to have two distinct states. In their studies, it was found that between birds and certain mammals like dolphins, their brains exhibit similar behavior. It was found that certain species of birds have half their brain&#x27;s hemisphere release brain waves similar to a human&#x27;s during NREM sleep, and the other half of it fully conscious, allowing them to fly while sleeping. Certain species of dolphins also exhibit similar behavior as birds in order to be able to swim while sleeping.

In rats, after a 24-hour sleep deprivation, it was found that there was an increase of slow-wave activity in NREM sleep, which corresponds directly with the human brain which when sleep deprived, prioritizes NREM sleep over REM sleep, implying that the NREM sleep is responsible for regulating and compensating for missed sleep.

<text>Jean Seznec (19 March 1905, in Morlaix – 22 November 1983, in Oxford) was a historian and mythographer whose most influential book, for English-speaking readers, is &quot;La Survivance des dieux antiques&quot; (1940), translated as &quot;The Survival of the Pagan Gods: Mythological Tradition in Renaissance Humanism and Art&quot; (1953). Expanding the scope of work by Warburg Institute scholars Fritz Saxl and Erwin Panofsky, Seznec presented a broad view of the transmission of classical representation in Western art.

==Career==
Seznec won a place at the French Academy in Rome in 1929, where he studied under Émile Mâle, whose methodology influenced his own work. At the outbreak of World War II, Seznec returned from his position in Florence as director of the French Institute, to enlist. His major work was published in 1940, just as France fell. After the war he accepted a position in Romance Languages and Literatures at Harvard University, where he taught from 1941 to 1949. He then was elected Marshal Foch Professor of French Literature at Oxford University, a chair that he held, along with a fellowship of All Souls College, Oxford, from 1950 until his retirement in 1972. He edited exhibition catalogues and the edition of Paris Salon art criticism written by the &quot;Encyclopédiste&quot; Denis Diderot between 1759–1781, an important primary resource for understanding the history of taste. A conference was held in his memory at the Warburg Institute in 2000.

Thanks largely to Seznec, it is widely understood that the Olympian gods, and the earlier spirits of field and spring, did not die with the advent of Christianity, but lived on. His work traces the process in which they were already transformed during late antiquity, whether embedded within history as transfigured former human beings in the Euhemerist view that was embraced by Christian apologists (), or given planetary roles as astral divinities in the worldview of astrology and magic or allegorized as moral emblems. They surviving in pictorial and in literary traditions and among the common people went underground to feature in folk culture, took on strange new guises and were transformed in various ways, their myths recast to suit some of the mythic saints of late antiquity. Their imagery permeated Medieval intellectual and emotional life. The transformed mythology re-emerged in the iconography of the early Tuscan Renaissance, with new attributes that the ancients had never imagined, and enjoyed tremendous renewed popularity during the Renaissance.

Seznec&#x27;s work benefits from the illustrated formats it has been receiving in modern paperback formats. Studies such as Joscelyn Godwin&#x27;s &quot;The Pagan Dream Of The Renaissance&quot; (2002) depend on it. Godwin further explores Seznec&#x27;s theme, how pagan deities captivated the European imagination during the Renaissance, taking their place side-by-side with Christian iconography and doctrines.

<text>Amesbury High School is a coeducational public high school in the city of Amesbury, Massachusetts, serving as the primary high school for students from Amesbury and, South Hampton, New Hampshire, along with also drawing some students from other parts of the lower Merrimack Valley region.

It is in the Amesbury Public Schools district, and serves grades 9 through 12. The school mascot is the Red Hawks, the colors are red and white. The yearbook is called the &quot;Powwow&quot;. There are around 620 students, and almost 60 members of faculty and other staff.

==History==
Amesbury High School was originally housed in what is now called the Ordway building on School Street. A wooden school building built in 1882 served as its first permanent home. The growing school was allowed to expand in a new brick building built in 1917 and was designed by the Boston architecture firm Prescott &amp; Sidebottom. That building served as a high school until a fire destroyed it on April 7, 1964. At the time, plans were underway to build a replacement for the school, which had exceeded its 500-student capacity by 100. After a lengthy discussion, a new school was to be built on Highland Street, designed by Walter Scott Brodie of Kilham, Hopkins, Greeley &amp; Brodie of Boston. This school would have a capacity of 900 students. On September 28, 1969, the new school was dedicated. From 1964 until the 1969 opening of the new building, classes were held in nearby Haverhill, in that city&#x27;s former high school building (Haverhill High School itself having recently moved to a newly-constructed building).

==Athletics==
Amesbury High School competes in the Cape Ann League. Their teams wear red and white and their athletic director is Glen Gearin.

The annual Thanksgiving game between Amesbury High School and Newburyport High School is one of the oldest high school football rivalries in the country, dating back to 1891.

==Graduates==
The USA Network show &quot;Burn Notice&quot; stars Jeffrey Donovan, a graduate of Amesbury High School. In 2009, Donovan visited Amesbury High and started a scholarship of $10,000 for an aspiring art student who plans to major in a fine arts career program in college. The scholarship will be given out to one student every year until 2018.

Another graduate was Major General Frank D Merrill, famous for commanding the 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional), better known as &quot;Merrill&#x27;s Marauders,&quot; in the China-Burma-India Theater of WWII.

Author and historian Osmond Richard Cummings graduated in 1940.

<text>Charlotte Dod (24 September 1871 – 27 June 1960) was an English multi-sport athlete, best known as a tennis player. She won the Wimbledon Ladies&#x27; Singles Championship five times, the first one when she was only 15 in the summer of 1887. She remains the youngest ladies&#x27; singles champion.

In addition to tennis, Dod competed in many other sports, including golf, field hockey, and archery. She also won the British Ladies Amateur Golf Championship, played twice for the England women&#x27;s national field hockey team (which she helped to found), and won a silver medal at the 1908 Summer Olympics in archery. The &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; has named her as the most versatile female athlete of all time, together with track and field athlete and fellow golf player Babe Zaharias.

== Early life ==
Dod was born on 24 September 1871 in Bebington, Cheshire, the youngest of four children to Joseph and Margaret Dod. Joseph, from Liverpool, had made a fortune in the cotton trade. The family was wealthy enough to provide for all members for life; Lottie and her brother Willy never had to work. Besides Willy, Lottie had a sister, Annie, and another brother, Tony, all of whom also excelled in sports. Annie was a good tennis player, golfer, ice skater and billiards player. Willy Dod won the Olympic gold medal in archery at the 1908 Games, and Tony was a regional level archer and a chess and tennis player. The Dod children received a private education by tutors and governesses. In her childhood Lottie played the piano, banjo and she was member of a local choir. When Dod was nine years old, two tennis courts were built near the family&#x27;s estate, &quot;Edgeworth&quot;. Lawn tennis, invented in 1873, was highly fashionable for the wealthy in England, and all of the Dod children started playing the game frequently. Tennis parties were occasionally organized and among the invited guests were future Wimbledon champions Joshua Pim and the brothers Herbert and Wilfred Baddeley. When she was eleven Dod joined the Rock Ferry Tennis Club in Birkenhead.

== Tennis ==
Together with Annie, who was eight years her elder, Dod entered her first tennis tournament, the 1883 Northern Championships in Manchester, at age eleven. They had a bye in the first round and lost in the second round of the doubles tournament to Hannah Keith and Amber McCord, but won the consolation tournament. One journalist, Sydney Brown, noted that &quot;Miss L. Dod should be heard of in the future&quot;. The following year, 1884, she participated in two tournaments, the Northern Championships, played that year in Liverpool, and Waterloo. With Annie she reached the doubles finals in both tournaments and with Tony she was defeated in the first round of the mixed doubles event at Waterloo. At the Northern Championships in 1885, she came to prominence when she nearly beat reigning Wimbledon champion Maud Watson in the final, losing 6–8, 5–7. Dod would win the doubles event (with Annie). Earlier she had won the first singles title of her career at the Waterloo tournament where she was also victorious in the doubles and mixed doubles events. These performances earned her the nickname &quot;Little Wonder&quot; in the press.

In 1886, Dod won the singles title at the West of England Championships in Bath where she defeated Watson in the final, ending the latter&#x27;s run of 55 consecutive victories. That year, she played tournaments in Liverpool (Northern), Cheltenham and Derbyshire but won no further singles titles. In 1887, Dod became an established first-class player, illustrated by the fact she partnered the then seven-time Wimbledon doubles winner Ernest Renshaw at the mixed doubles event of the Irish Championships. She won the singles in Dublin defeating Watson in the final in straight sets. She again won the singles title at the Northern, defeating leading players Louisa Martin, May Langrishe and Watson without losing a set and conceding no more than two games per set.
Encouraged by these results, she decided to enter the 1887 Wimbledon Championships. Only six competitors, not having had included Martin and Watson, had entered. Dod had a bye in the first round and easily advanced through the semifinal and final of the All-Comer&#x27;s tournament to earn the right to challenge the defending champion, Blanche Bingley. She defeated Bingley in straight sets 6–2, 6–0, the second set lasting just 10 minutes. At 15 years and 285 days, she is the youngest winner of the ladies&#x27; singles championships.
During the match, Dod wore a metal-and-whalebone corset which punctured her skin and caused her to bleed as she played.
The two met again in the final of the 1888 West of England Championships. Although it was designated an &quot;open&quot; tournament, the officials made the remarkable decision to impose a handicap of 15 on Dod. She still managed to win against her opponent, now known by her married name, Blanche Hillyard. The Wimbledon final of 1888 was a rematch of the previous year, and Dod, this time defending her title in the Challenge Round, again emerged victorious (6–3, 6–3). During that year she won several doubles and mixed doubles titles with her sister Annie, May Langrishe and Ernest Renshaw.

Lottie Dod&#x27;s style of play, then regarded as unorthodox, now seems notably modern. She was perhaps the first player to advocate hitting the ball just before the top of the bounce and to adopt a modern, albeit single-handed, racquet grip. Her ground strokes were reported by contemporaries to be unusually firmly hit by the standards of the time, but – like many female players of the day – she served underhand and only rarely employed spin.

Dod only entered one open tournament in 1889 (the Northern Championships, which she won), and failed to attend Wimbledon, much to the disappointment of her fans. Together with Annie and some friends, she was on a sailing trip off the Scottish coast, and didn&#x27;t want to return in time for Wimbledon. This was followed by a complete absence from the game in 1890.

After failing to do so in 1889, Dod was determined to win Wimbledon three times in a row, starting in 1891. Although it was her only competitive appearance of that season, she won her third Wimbledon title by defeating Hillyard (6–2, 6–1) in the final of the All-Comers tournament. The reigning champion Lena Rice did not defend her title. 1892 saw Dod&#x27;s first singles defeat in an open tournament since 1886 when she lost to Louisa Martin of Ireland in the second round of the Irish Championships. It was the last of only five losses in her entire tennis career and her only defeat after the age of 15. She continued the year strongly, culminating in another easy straight-set Wimbledon victory over Hillyard. Dod&#x27;s last tennis season as a competitive player was 1893, and she played in just two tournaments, The Northern in Manchester and Wimbledon, winning both. On both occasions, she defeated Blanche Hillyard in three sets despite a heavy fall in the Wimbledon final. Her record of five Wimbledon titles would not last for long, as Hillyard, after losing in the final to Dod five times, won her sixth title in 1900. Suzanne Lenglen broke Dod&#x27;s record of three consecutive singles wins by winning from 1919 to 1923.

Apart from entering women&#x27;s tournaments, Dod sometimes played and won matches against men (who usually played with a handicap), and on one occasion defeated star players Ernest Renshaw and George Hillyard (the husband of Blanche) when doubling with Herbert Baddeley.

=== Grand Slam finals ===
== Winter sports ==

Although tennis would remain Dod&#x27;s favourite sport, she shifted her attention to other activities in the following years. In 1895, she joined her brother Tony on a trip to the winter sports resort of St. Moritz, which was very popular with English travellers. There, she passed the St. Moritz Ladies&#x27;s Skating Test, the most prestigious figure skating event for women at the time. Dod also rode the toboggan on the famous Sankt Moritz Cresta Run, and began mountaineering with her brother, climbing two mountains over 4,000 m in February 1896.

After a long cycling trip in Italy, Lottie and Tony returned to England, only to come back to St Moritz in November, now accompanied by their mother and brother Willy. This time, Dod took the St. Moritz Men&#x27;s Skating Test and passed, as the second woman ever. She also competed in curling. In the summer of 1897, she and Tony again ascended several mountains, this time in Norway.

== Field hockey ==
The sport of women&#x27;s field hockey was still rather young when Dod took up the game in 1897. She was one of the founding members of a women&#x27;s hockey club in Spital. Playing as a central forward, she was soon named captain of the team. Club matches in which Dod played were won, while losses happened only in her absence.

By 1899, Dod had made it to captain of the Cheshire county team, and represented her club at meetings of the women&#x27;s hockey association for the northern counties. She first played in the English national team on 21 March that year, winning 3–1 over Ireland. Both English goals in the 1900 England and Ireland rematch were scored by Dod, securing a 2–1 victory. Dod failed to attend the match against Wales, suffering from sciatica attacks which kept her from sporting for months.

Although she had recovered by 1901, Dod would not play again in national or county matches. All members of the Dod family stopped attending sports events for a while after their mother died on 1 August 1901, and Dod apparently lost her interest in field hockey during that period, although she did occasionally play for Spital Club until 1905.

== Golf ==

Few golf clubs allowed women to play around the time Lottie Dod first played golf at age fifteen. Unlike tennis, Dod found golf a difficult sport to master. By the time she got seriously interested in the sport, the Ladies Golf Union (LGU) had been founded, and women&#x27;s golf had become a real sport.

Dod helped establish a ladies&#x27; golf club at Moreton in 1894 and entered that year&#x27;s National Championships (match play) at Littlestone (Kent). She was eliminated in the third round, but Dod&#x27;s interest in the sport grew, and she became a regular competitor in the National Championships and other tournaments for the next few years. In 1898 and 1900 she reached the semi-finals of the National Championships, but was defeated narrowly both times. In 1900, she also played in an unofficial country match against Ireland, which the English won 37–18.

Dod did not compete in golf in 1901, and hardly entered major tournaments in the next two years, but she did play in the 1904 British Ladies Amateur, held at Troon. She qualified for the semi-finals for the third time in her life, and won it for the first time. Her opponent in the final was May Hezlet, the champion of 1899 and 1902. The match was very close, and the two were tied after 17 holes. Hezlet missed her putt on the final hole narrowly, after which Dod grabbed an unexpected victory, becoming the first, and to date only, woman to win British tennis and golf championships.

Following her victory, Dod sailed to Philadelphia, where she had been invited by Frances C. Griscom, a former American golf champion, to attend the U.S. Women&#x27;s Amateur as a spectator. Upon arrival, Dod found out the tournament regulations had been changed to allow for non-Americans to compete, and she was requested to compete. Her loss in the first round was a disappointment, but Dod persuaded several Americans to come and play in the British championships the following year.

In the week before these 1905 championships, three international matches were planned, starting off with the first British-American international match. Dod was the only British player to lose a match, as the United Kingdom won 6–1. Dod then played for the English team in a 3–4 defeat against Scotland and a 4–3 win over Ireland, although she lost both her matches. Dod was then eliminated in the fourth round of the National Championships. It was to be her last appearance in golf.

== Archery ==
In the autumn of 1905, Dod and her brothers sold &quot;Edgeworth&quot; and moved to a new home near Newbury, Berkshire. They had been practising archery from the times before, but all three became more serious now and joined the Welford Park Archers in Newbury. As one of their ancestors was said to have commanded the English longbowmen at the Battle of Agincourt, they found this an appropriate sport.

Lottie Dod won her first tournament by 1906, and finished fifth in the Grand National Archery Meeting of 1906, 1907 and 1908. Dod&#x27;s performances in the 1908 season earned her a spot on the British Olympic team. The field in the women&#x27;s archery event consisted only of British women, but without the best archer of the era, Alice Legh. Dod led the competition, held in rainy conditions, after the first day but was surpassed by Queenie Newall on the second day, eventually taking second place with 642 points to Newall&#x27;s 688. Her brother Willy fared better and surprisingly secured the gold medal in the men&#x27;s competition.

In 1910, Dod came close to winning the Grand National, which would have made archery the third sport in which she became a national champion. Both Lottie and her brother William led after day one, but moved down to second on the final competition day. After the Welford Archers were disbanded in late 1911, the Dods&#x27; interest in archery faded, meaning the end of Lottie Dod&#x27;s long competitive sports career.

== Later life ==
In 1913, Lottie and Willy moved to a new house in Bideford. When World War I broke out, Lottie worked for the British Red Cross from November 1916 at Chelsea VAD Hospital and in a military hospital in Speen, Berkshire.

Dod wanted to be transferred to the war zones in France but was hampered by sciatica and never served as a nurse outside England. She did receive a Service Medal by the Red Cross for serving more than 1,000 hours during the war.

She then lived in London and Devon, and she never failed to attend the Wimbledon Championships until she was in her late 80s. After her brother Willy died in 1954, she lived in several nursing homes on the English south coast, eventually settling at the Birchy Hill Nursing Home in Sway, Hampshire. There she died, unmarried, at age 88, passing away while listening to the Wimbledon radio broadcasts in bed.

Dod was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1983.

In May 2024, &#x27;The Lottie Dod&#x27; public house opened on the site of a former Wetherspoon&#x27;s in Moreton.

<doc id="776371" wikidata="Q305125" url="?curid=776371" title="Top rope climbing">
<text>Top rope climbing (or top roping) is a form of rock climbing where the climber is securely attached to a climbing rope that runs through a fixed anchor at the top of the climbing route, and back down to the belayer (or &quot;second&quot;) at the base of the climb. A climber who falls will be held by the rope at the point of the fall, and can then either resume their climb or have the belayer lower them down in a controlled manner to the base of the climb. Climbers on indoor climbing walls can use mechanical auto belay devices to top rope alone.

By definition, top roping can only be done on routes that are less than half the length of a typical climbing rope, which means single-pitch routes that are below in height. Top roping is also used in ice climbing, and the related sports of mixed climbing and dry-tooling, and it is used in combination with auto belay devices in both competition speed climbing and competition ice climbing.

Top roping is one of the safest forms of rock climbing and is used by most beginners and novices of the sport. Before the era of sport climbing, top roping a route for practice (known as headpointing or hangdogging) was considered poor practice; however, it is now a legitimate technique in preparing for a redpoint ascent. Top roping a new route is not considered a first free ascent of a climb, and because of the ability of the belayer to give aid to the climber, it is not strictly free climbing (although some advocate that with slack, it is similar to free climbing), and is thus differentiated from &quot;normal&quot; lead climbing.

==Description==
In top-roping, the climber and their belayer (or &quot;second&quot;), arrange a fixed anchor at the top of the climb and then hang the rope down from this anchor at the rope&#x27;s approximate mid-point, so that two parts of the rope are now hanging down the route. By definition, top-roping is only possible where the climbers can get to the top of the route by other means so that they can set up the anchor and pass the rope through it.

Once the top rope is set up, the climber is then tied to one end of the rope (using a figure-eight loop follow-through knot), and the belayer clips their belay device into the other side of the hanging rope. As the climber ascends the route, the belayer &quot;takes in&quot; the &quot;slack&quot; in the rope, so that a climber who falls can simply hang from the rope, unlike a lead climber who falls at least twice the distance to their last point of climbing protection.

In top-roping, the climbing rope needs to be at least twice the length of the climbing route (because the rope goes to the top of the climbing route and back to the climber who is starting at the ground level). As typical climbing ropes are in length, it means that top-roping is only done on routes that are in height (if not shorter, for safety), which are single-pitch routes.
A belayer who takes in all the slack and maintains a high level of tautness in the rope is giving the climber a source of artificial aid in ascending the route. A physically strong belayer, or a belayer with a light climber, can physically haul the climber up the route by pulling on the rope. Because of this, top roping is not considered free climbing (and nor is it considered lead climbing), and a top rope ascent cannot be used to claim a first free ascent (FFA) of a new climb.

==Use by leading climbers==

Before the arrival of sport climbing in the mid-1980s, practicing a traditional climbing route using a top rope before attempting to free climb the route was considered poor practice. A first free ascent where the climber had practiced the route on a top rope (called headpointing or hangdogging), was noted in guidebooks to record its lesser status. When the sport climbing definition of an FFA — the redpoint — became the standard definition in sport climbing and traditional climbing, such distinctions were dropped, and leading climbers now make extensive legitimate use of hangdogging and headpointing top-roping techniques when preparing (or projecting) for redpoint FFAs.

In the 1998 climbing film &quot;Hard Grit&quot;, British traditional climber Johnny Dawes advocated for the use of a top rope — with enough slack in the rope to avoid any implication of aid (so that in a fall, the climber would fall a few metres before the rope became taut)— to qualify as a free ascent on extreme traditional climbing routes, however, his view was not adopted by the wider climbing community.

==Equipment==
In common with lead climbing, top roping requires the standard equipment of a harness attached to one end of a dynamic kernmantle rope (usually via a figure-eight knot). The &quot;second&quot;, who is belaying, will use a standard mechanical belay device that is clipped into the rope, and which pays out the rope as needed but can grip it tightly to catch the climber in the event of a fall.

===Anchors===
Top roping requires a fixed anchor at the top of the climb, from which two sides of the rope can be hung back down to the base. Because top roping is either done by novice climbers, or by experienced climbers practicing to attempt a route at the limit of their capabilities, there is a high probability that the anchor will experience a load, and it, therefore, needs to be strong. Some climbing areas place fixed artificial anchors (such as iron rings or cement blocks) at the top of routes to assist top rope climbers in creating a strong fixed anchor.

===Auto belays===
Some indoor climbing walls offer auto belay devices that enable a solo climber to top rope without a belay partner. The auto belay is fixed to the top of the route and the climber clips into a wire that pays out from the device, which enables the device to belay the climber as if they were on a top rope. Top roping with auto belay devices is the format used in competition speed climbing and in the speed elements of competition ice climbing.

==Top rope solo climbing==

Top rope solo climbing is where a single-length static fixed rope, anchored to the top of the route, is laid along the length of the climb (unlike normal top roping, the two sides of the rope are not needed). The climber then clips-into the fixed rope using at least one progress capture device (PCD) such as a Petzl Micro Traxion or a Camp Lift, that will allow the rope to pay-through as the climber ascends but will grip the rope tightly in the event of a fall.

Big wall climbing can also use top rope solo climbing for the &quot;second&quot; (and other non-lead climbers), to speed up their follow-on ascent, and give the lead climber time to rest.

==Use in ice climbing==

Ice climbing, and the related sports of mixed climbing and dry tooling, also use top-roping techniques to provide greater safety to climbers as an alternative to lead climbing the routes. Lead climbing on ice is considered even more challenging than on rock, as the placement of secure ice screws is a complex task that requires judgment on ice quality and stability. The technique of top roping in ice climbing is identical to that of rock climbing but sometimes the creation of a secure anchor point at the top of the route can be more complex if it involves securing into the ice (e.g. it may require the creation of an Abalakov thread anchor point).

<text>The American way of life or the American way is the U.S. nationalist ethos that adheres to the principle of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. At the center of the American way is the belief in an American Dream that is claimed to be achievable by any American through hard work. This concept is intertwined with the concept of American exceptionalism, the belief in the unique culture of the nation.

==Definition==

American writer and intellectual William Herberg offers the following definition of the American way of life:


One commentator notes, &quot;The first half of Herberg&#x27;s statement still holds true nearly half a century after he first formulated it&quot;, even though &quot;Herberg&#x27;s latter claims have been severely if not completely undermined... materialism no longer needs to be justified in high-sounding terms&quot;.

In the National Archives and Records Administration&#x27;s 1999 Annual Report, National Archivist John W. Carlin writes, &quot;We are different because our government and our way of life are not based on the divine right of kings, the hereditary privileges of elites, or the enforcement of deference to dictators. They are based on pieces of paper, the Charters of Freedom - the Declaration that asserted our independence, the Constitution that created our government, and the Bill of Rights that established our liberties.&quot;

<doc id="776385" wikidata="Q6198637" url="?curid=776385" title="Jim Tyrer">
<text>James Efflo Tyrer (February 25, 1939 – September 15, 1980) was an American professional football offensive tackle widely regarded as one of the most dominant players of his era. He played 14 years of professional football (1961 - 1974) after an All-American college career for Ohio State University, competing in the American Football League (AFL) for the Dallas Texans / Kansas City Chiefs and later in the National Football League (NFL): 13 years for Texans/Chiefs and his final year with the Washington Redskins. He was a nine-time Pro Bowl selection and a six-time first-team All-Pro. Standing 6&#x27;6&quot; tall and weighing as much as 322 pounds during his career, Tyrer was known for his size, quick footwork, intelligence, and a notably large head, which he used to impose his will on opponents.

A cornerstone of the Chiefs&#x27; success, owner Lamar Hunt credited him for helping establish Kansas City as a major sports town. He was a Chiefs team captain four years (1967 - 1971) including the team&#x27;s Super Bowl IV championship season. Tyrer is often referenced as &quot;the greatest player not in the Hall of Fame,&quot; reflecting his lasting impact on the sport and much-debated omission from the Hall of Fame.

He played in a period when linemen were prohibited from using their hands for blocking, and defensive players were permitted to use the &quot;head slap&quot; technique—a practice later outlawed due to its brutality. Despite the physicality of the era and the demands of his position, Tyrer started 180 consecutive games, a then-record for the Chiefs, and every pre-season game (65) in his 13 years with the Texans/Chiefs franchise. His 180 starts surpasses all left tackles in the Pro Football Hall of Fame as of 2024.

In the early morning hours of Sept. 15, 1980, to the shock of the sports world, Tyrer murdered his wife, Martha, and then died by suicide. Teammate and author Michael Oriard would later describe Tyrer in the book &quot;The End of Autumn&quot; as &quot;the unlikeliest suicide-murderer to those who knew him.&quot;

Tyrer was a finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame at the time of the murder-suicide, his first year of eligibility. He did not advance in the selection process again for 44 years when research from Beneath the Shadow filmmaker Kevin Patrick Allen led to a tacit acknowledgement from the PFHOF senior committee that Tyrer likely suffered from brain trauma. On December 3, 2024, Tyrer reached the finalist stage for the Pro Football Hall of Fame&#x27;s Class of 2025.

== Early life ==
Born and raised in Newark, Ohio, Jim Tyrer attended Newark High School, where he excelled in track, basketball, and, most notably, football. On February 18, 1956, Tyrer’s father, Efflo Tyrer, who served as the city treasurer, suffered a fatal heart attack while attending the Central Ohio League high school basketball championship, which Newark won. The following night, 17-year-old Tyrer led his team to victory in a highly anticipated matchup against Mount Vernon High. He scored 24 points in the 68–62 triumph, later telling reporters, “Dad would have wanted me to play.” 

In 1970, Tyrer&#x27;s No. 77 jersey was retired as he was inducted into the Newark High School Hall of Fame.

==College career==
Tyrer played college football at Ohio State University under head coach Woody Hayes, and earned All-America honors. Hayes did not have a helmet that would fit Tyrer. A regular helmet had to be split in the middle and reconnected with a wide strip in the middle. A Riddell Company representative made several flights to Columbus, Ohio to get the changes right.

==Professional career==
Tyrer signed with the American Football League&#x27;s Dallas Texans in 1961. He played 13 years with that franchise (180 consecutive games), which became the Kansas City Chiefs in 1963, helping set the standard for his position at left offensive tackle. His 14th and final season was with the Washington Redskins under head coach George Allen, who preferred veteran players. Tyrer was traded from the Chiefs in late August 1974 for three draft picks.

Tyrer was named AFL Offensive Lineman of the Year in 1969. He and Ed Budde at guard made a powerful left side. In Super Bowl IV, Tyrer and Budde opened holes for Chiefs running backs against the Minnesota Vikings&#x27; opposing defensive linemen Jim Marshall and Alan Page, respectively, gaining 151 yards on 42 carries (3.6 yards per attempt) and 122 net passing yards in the team&#x27;s upset 23–7 victory. Pundits noted that Chiefs&#x27; running backs Warren McVea and Mike Garrett, both 5&#x27;9&quot;, were &quot;camouflaged&quot; by Tyrer, giving them an initial advantage against opponents.

Tyrer was an anchor of the Texans/Chiefs&#x27; line and was selected as &quot;The Sporting News&#x27;&quot;&#x27; AFL All-League tackle eight consecutive years, from 1962 through 1969. He was an AFL Western Division All-Star seven times, in 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1968 and 1969 before also capturing a pair of All-AFC accolades in 1970–71. His efforts in the upstart league would result in his selection to the American Football League All-Time Team. Houston Oilers defensive end Elvin Bethea, himself a member of the Professional Football Hall of Fame, described Tyrer as &quot;The preeminent left tackle in all of football. All other blockers I faced in the NFL were mediocre compared to him.&quot;

Tyrer announced his retirement in June 1975. He was inducted into the Kansas City Chiefs Hall of Fame on February 25, 1977. Tyrer jokingly said he&#x27;d been told he&#x27;d never win such an honor because &quot;they&#x27;d never be able to accumulate enough metal to match the size of my head.&quot; 
==Family==
Jim and Martha Tyrer had four children: Tina, Brad, Stefanie and Jason. Tyrer&#x27;s sons, Brad and Jason, went on to college football careers in the Big Eight Conference. Brad played for Nebraska under head coach Tom Osborne from 1982 to 1986. Jason was a defensive end for Kansas under head coach Glen Mason from 1988 to 1992. The resilience and post-tragedy successes of the children are what filmmaker Allen says drew him to create Beneath the Shadow, &quot;It&#x27;s pretty rare that you see four kids that go through something like this, and you look at them and you say, &#x27;Wow that&#x27;s motivating,&#x27;&quot; 

==After football==
Following his retirement from football, Tyrer ran his own company, Pro Forma, representing professional athletes in commercial ventures. After the business failed, he transitioned to working as a manufacturer&#x27;s representative, selling products on the road. He then operated two separate flea market booths in succession before buying and managing Crown Tire and Alignment, a gas station/tire store which also failed. In the last months of his life, amid unemployment, Tyrer and his wife, Martha, deeply in debt, sold Amway products.

== Death ==
In the pre-dawn hours of September 15, 1980, Tyrer shot and killed his wife Martha before turning the gun on himself and taking his own life. Three of the Tyrer&#x27;s four children — 17-year-old Brad, 12-year-old Stef, and 11-year-old Jason — were in the home at the time of the murder-suicide. The afternoon before, Tyrer had attended a Chiefs game at Arrowhead Stadium with son Jason. 

In 2021, the short documentary &quot;A Good Man: The Jim Tyrer Story&quot; by Kansas City filmmaker Kevin Patrick Allen was shown in select screenings, including a gathering of the Super Bowl IV champion Kansas City Chiefs and members of the Tyrer family. It led to a more extensive investigation into Jim and Martha Tyrer&#x27;s deaths and the lives of their surviving children for a yet-to-be-released feature-length film &quot;Beneath the Shadow.&quot; In June 2024, the Kansas City Star published an op-ed from Allen that revealed key findings strongly suggesting Tyrer suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) at the time of his death. Among those findings, a specialist who examined Tyrer two days before his death. Dr. Douglas Paone told Allen, “He (Tyrer) had CTE. There’s not a doubt in my mind.” Paone noted that Tyrer was having headaches, abdominal pain and a general feeling of not being himself. When Paone was unable to pinpoint the cause of Tyrer&#x27;s maladies, Martha Tyrer grabbed Paone by the arm while exiting the office and said, &quot;there&#x27;s something wrong with him... he&#x27;s just not the same.&quot; Tyrer played in an era where lineman were expected to use their head as a battering ram, and his daughter Tina has stated that the custom helmet he used for his large frame (6-7, 290 pounds) had a half-inch of cardboard lining with no suspension.

In 2024, he was named as a Seniors finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, marking the first time he has been considered by the full board since 1981. Tyrer is one of only two eligible players with at least six All-Pro selections to not be a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

<text>Herbert Jude Score (June 7, 1933 – November 11, 2008) was an American professional baseball pitcher and announcer in Major League Baseball (MLB). He pitched for the Cleveland Indians from 1955 through 1959 and the Chicago White Sox from 1960 through 1962. He was the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year in 1955, and an AL All-Star in 1955 and 1956. Due to an on-field injury that occurred in 1957, he retired early as a player in 1962. Score was a television and radio broadcaster for the Cleveland Indians from 1964 through 1997. He was inducted into the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame in 2006.

==Early life==
Herb Score was born in Rosedale, New York in 1933. He was given the middle name &quot;Jude&quot; after St. Jude, to whom his mother prayed during her pregnancy. At 3, he was run over by a truck and later had rheumatic fever. As a child, he started playing CYO basketball and baseball at Holy Name of Mary parish in Valley Stream, New York, where he made his First Communion and Confirmation.

As a teenager, he moved with his family to Lake Worth, Florida. In 1952, he threw six no-hitters for the Lake Worth Community High School baseball team, when the school won its only state baseball championship.

On June 7, 1952 (his 19th birthday), he signed a baseball contract with the Cleveland Indians. He was sent to Indianapolis of the American Association where he made 10 pitching starts. In 1953, he moved to Cleveland&#x27;s Class A affiliate, Reading (Pennsylvania) of the Eastern League. At Reading, he became a roommate and lifetime friend with Rocky Colavito, a near future Cleveland Indians home run hitter and right fielder from the Bronx, New York. For the 1954 season, both were promoted to Triple-A Indianapolis. Score won &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Minor League Player of the Year Award and began to be referred to as &quot;left-handed Bob Feller&quot;.

==MLB playing career==

===Cleveland Indians (1955–1959)===
In , Score came up to the major leagues (with Colavito) as a rookie with the Cleveland Indians at the age of 21. He quickly became one of the top power pitchers in the American League, no small feat on a team that still included Feller, Bob Lemon, and other top pitchers, going 16–10 with a 2.85 earned run average in his first year. He appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine on May 30, 1955. Score struck out 245 batters in 1955, a major league rookie record that stood until , when it was topped by Dwight Gooden (Score, Gooden, Grover Cleveland Alexander, Don Sutton, Gary Nolan, Kerry Wood, Mark Langston, and Hideo Nomo were the only eight rookie pitchers to top 200 strikeouts in the 20th century). It was the first time in major league history that a regular starting pitcher averaged over one strikeout per inning.

In , Score improved on his rookie campaign, going 20–9 with a 2.53 earned run average and 263 strikeouts, while reducing the number of walks from 154 to 129, and allowed only 5.85 hits per 9 innings, which remained a franchise record until it was broken by Luis Tiant&#x27;s 5.30 in .

====Injury from Gil McDougald&#x27;s line drive====
On May 7, , during the first inning of a night game against the New York Yankees at Municipal Stadium in Cleveland, Score threw a low fastball to Gil McDougald with Jim Hegan catching. McDougald lined the pitch to the mound and struck Score in the face, breaking Score&#x27;s facial bones and injuring his eye. The ball caromed to third baseman Al Smith, who threw McDougald out before he rushed to the pitching mound to aid Score. McDougald, seeing Score hit by the baseball and then lying down and injured, also ran immediately to the pitching mound, instead of first base, to help Score. McDougald reportedly vowed to retire if Score permanently lost his sight in one eye as a result of the accident. Score eventually recovered his 20/20 vision, though he missed the rest of the season.

He returned early in the season. Though many believe he feared being hit by another batted ball, and thus changed his pitching motion, Score rejected that theory. Score would tell Cleveland sportswriter Terry Pluto (for &quot;The Curse of Rocky Colavito&quot;) that, in 1958, after pitching and winning a few games and feeling better than he&#x27;d felt in a long time, he tore a tendon in his arm while pitching on a damp night against the Washington Senators and sat out the rest of the season.

In 1959, he shifted his pitching motion in a bid to avoid another, similar injury. &quot;The reason my motion changed&quot;, Score told Pluto, &quot;was because I hurt my elbow, and I overcompensated for it and ended up with some bad habits.&quot; As a result of the changes Score made in his pitching delivery, his velocity dropped and he incurred further injuries. Score pitched the full season, going 9–11 with a 4.71 earned run average and 147 strikeouts.

In the book &quot;The Greatest Team Of All Time&quot; (Bob Adams, Inc, publisher. 1994), Mickey Mantle picked Score as the toughest American League left-handed pitcher he faced (before the injury). Yogi Berra picked Score for his &quot;Greatest Team Of All Time&quot;.

===Chicago White Sox (1960–1962)===
Score was traded to the Chicago White Sox by Cleveland on April 18, 1960 for pitcher Barry Latman. Score&#x27;s roommate, Colavito, was traded to the Detroit Tigers the previous day. Score was reunited on the Chicago team with some former Indians players and manager Al Lopez. Score pitched parts of the following three seasons before retiring. He finished with a major league career record of 55–46, a 3.36 earned run average, and 837 strikeouts over eight seasons in 858 innings pitched.

==Broadcasting career==
Score retired from playing baseball in 1962. Beginning in 1964, he was employed as a television and radio play-by-play announcer with the Cleveland Indians for the next 34 years, first on television from to , and then on radio from to , the longest career for an Indians play-by-play announcer. Score was revered by the Indians fans for his announcing style, including a low voice and a low-key style, as well as a habit of occasionally mispronouncing the names of players on opposing teams. Score&#x27;s final Major League Baseball game as an announcer was Game 7 of the 1997 World Series.

==Retirement and death==
On October 8, 1998, while driving to Florida after being inducted into the Broadcasters Hall of Fame the night before, Score was severely injured in a traffic accident. He pulled into the path of a westbound tractor-trailer truck near New Philadelphia, Ohio, and his car was struck in the passenger side. He suffered trauma to his brain, chest, and lungs. The orbital bone around one of his eyes was fractured, as were three ribs and his sternum. He spent over a month in the intensive care unit, and was released from MetroHealth Hospital in mid-December. He was cited for failure to stop at a stop sign.

He went through a difficult recovery, but managed to throw out the first pitch at the Indians&#x27; Opening Day on April 12, 1999. He suffered a stroke in 2002, and died on November 11, 2008, at his home in Rocky River, Ohio, after a lengthy illness. He is interred at Lakewood Park Cemetery in Rocky River. The Indians wore a memorial patch on their uniform during the 2009 season to honor him.

<text>The British Rail Class 57 is a type of diesel locomotive that was remanufactured from Class 47s by Brush Traction of Loughborough between 1998 and 2004.

The Class 57 was produced in response to an order placed in November 1997 by the recently privatised freight operator Freightliner. The company sought to have its ageing Class 47s rebuilt, some of which had become increasingly unreliable and uncompetitive in comparison to new-build counterparts. Accordingly, redundant locomotives were handed over to Brush, where they were fitted with re-conditioned Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) engines and the same model of traction alternator as that fitted to the Class 56 heavy freight locomotive. As a result of this scheme, improved reliability and performance was recorded; Freightliner placed multiple follow-on orders for more to be rebuilt, as would other operators. However, Freightliner abandoned its long-term plans to acquire 25 further Class 57 locomotives in favour of new-built Class 66 locomotives instead.

There are three variants of the Class 57, one designed for freight traffic (57/0) and two to perform passenger operations. During April 2002, Virgin Trains West Coast signed a deal with the rolling stock lessor Porterbrook for the rebuilding of 12 Class 47s into Class 57/3s to conduct rescue duties as well as to drag electric trains along routes that lacked overhead wires to power them directly; further examples would be later ordered to expand Virgin&#x27;s fleet. The company named its Class 57 locomotives after characters and vehicles from &quot;Thunderbirds.&quot; Other passenger train operators that used the type included Arriva Trains Wales and Great Western Railway. Various freight haulage firms, and mixed traffic operators, opted to procure Class 57 locomotives as well; these include Direct Rail Services, Rail Operations Group, Advenza Freight, and Colas Rail; many of these obtained units as a result of Freightliner having made its own fleet redundant after procuring new-build locomotives.

==Background==
The Class 57 is a re-engineered diesel locomotive that was rebuilt from redundant Class 47 locomotives by Brush Traction at their Loughborough facility. The locomotives are fitted with a refurbished Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) engine and a re-conditioned alternator, improving reliability and performance. There are three variants of the Class 57, one designed for freight traffic (57/0) and two to perform passenger operations. Each locomotive reportedly cost £300,000, about one-third that of a new-build locomotive.

The origins of the Class 57 can be traced back to an order placed in November 1997 by the recently privatised freight operator Freightliner for an initial batch of six locomotives. In 1999, the rebuilding of a further six locomotives were ordered for a total of 12 Class 57/0 freight locomotives. Additionally, five locomotives of the Class 57/6 variant were produced between 2000 and 2003, while 12 Class 57/3 locomotives were ordered during 2002, and extended to cover four more units in 2003, making a total of 21 passenger units. During 2001, a single prototype Class 57/0 was converted with electric train heating for the purpose of garnering orders from passenger train operating companies.

==Current operators==
===Direct Rail Services===

The mixed-traffic operator Direct Rail Services (DRS) previously operated nine class 57/0s—comprising 57002-57004 and 57007-57012. DRS sold most of their 57/0 fleet during 2022 and 2023, with the locomotives being dispersed between Locomotive Services Limited, West Coast Railway, Harry Needle Rail and Ron Hull Scrap Merchants. West Coast Railway sebsequently bought 57008/11/12 from Ron Hull. The final DRS machine, 57002, was sold to Harry Needle Rail. During April 2012, DRS agreed terms with Porterbrook to lease 57302, 57305, and 57309 via a three-year deal. In December 2012, DRS started provided locomotives to the passenger train operator Virgin Trains West Coast. Another three Class 57/3s were leased as part of the deal, however, two of these had entered warm storage within two years. During July 2014, DRS took over the leases of the remaining six Class 57/3s from the national railway infrastructure owner Network Rail. In June 2023, six were returned to Porterbrook with five moving to GB Railfreight and one to Great Western Railway, leaving DRS with 57304, 57307, 57308 and 57309.
===GB Railfreight===

In June 2023, GB Railfreight began leases on 57301, 57303, 57305, 57306 and 57310. They are used for Multiple Unit transfers, and have also operated as the power for passenger charter trains.
===Great Western Railway===

During 2000, the rail leasing company Porterbrook placed an order for a prototype passenger locomotive fitted with electric train heating. During June 2001, this locomotive, 57601, was leased to the passenger train operator First Great Western, At the time, First Great Western were reportedly searching for a suitable replacement for its elderly Class 47 locomotives. 57601 hauled Mark 2 stock on day services from London Paddington to Plymouth and Penzance—until these services ceased in September 2002—and on the Night Riviera sleeper service. After an evaluation period, First Great Western agreed to lease three production Class 57/6s from Porterbrook in May 2002, the first of which being delivered during November 2003. As the prototype locomotive was non-standard, it was decided to order a fourth Class 57/6 in 2003 and return 57601 to Porterbrook; this occurred in December 2003 after the first production Class 57/6 was delivered, after which 57601 was sold by Porterbrook to the spot-hire company West Coast Railways. In mid-2015, First Great Western stated it had plans to obtain one more Class 57, but that the sub-class and number of which had not yet been confirmed.

The First Great Western fleet were originally painted green with a gold bodyside band to match the Night Riviera stock, with cast name and numberplates. All four locomotives were named after castles in Devon and Cornwall, and operate mainly on the Night Riviera sleeper service, with the occasional stock move. From March 2008, the fleet started to receive First Great Western blue livery, with 57605 the first repainted. During June 2010, 57604 received a repaint into lined Brunswick green livery, to commemorate the 175th anniversary of the Great Western Railway. Between December 2009 and July 2010, the rail freight operator First GBRf hired several Class 57/3s from Virgin Trains to operate in top-and-tail formation with Mark 2 stock on a First Great Western Taunton - Cardiff diagram; primarily due to unreliability, the Class 57/3s were replaced by Class 67 locomotives.

===Locomotive Services Limited===
In December 2021, the train operating company Locomotive Services Limited purchased 57302 and 57311 from Direct Rail Services. Also acquired in 2022 was 57004; this was subsequently sold to Great Western Railway as a source of spares for their Class 57 fleet. 57004 was stripped of recoverable components by GWR engineers at LSL&#x27;s Crewe depot in October 2022. Locomotive Services Limited also obtained 57003 directly from DRS, and 57007 from Harry Needle Railroad Company in 2022.

===West Coast Railways===

During April 2003, 57601 was sold to West Coast Railways (WCRC), but it remained in traffic with First Great Western for a few months. WCRC&#x27;s managing director stated that the first action taken upon taking control of the locomotive was to pass it through his paint shop to apply the house colours in the original diesel style.

In January 2011, WCRC purchased 57001 from Porterbrook as well as 57005 from Advenza Freight, followed in April 2011 by 57006 from Advenza, with 57001 and 57006 returned to service and 57005 stored at Carnforth. During January 2013, 57313-316 were purchased from Porterbrook, a move which made WCRC the only company to operate all three of the Class 57 sub-classes. Following the sales of DRS&#x27;s Heritage Fleet in 2022, West Coast Railway obtained ownership of 57009/010 directly from DRS; they also obtained 57008/011/012 from the original buyer, Ron Hull Limited.

==Former operators==
===Advenza Freight===
During January 2008, Advenza Freight purchased 57005 and 57006 from Porterbrook to use on a number of freight flows that had been recently won by the company. After Advenza ceased operations in 2009, 57005 was sold to West Coast Railways in January 2011, as was 57006 in April 2011.

===Arriva Trains Wales===
Between January and July 2006, passenger service operator Arriva Trains Wales hired Class 57/3s from Virgin Trains to operate a weekday Manchester Piccadilly to Holyhead diagram, hauling rakes of Mark 2 carriages.

During December 2008, Arriva Trains Wales commenced operation of the daily &quot;Premier Service&quot; between Holyhead and Cardiff with Mark 2 carriages. To provide the motive power for this train, ATW contracted Virgin Trains to provide Class 57/3 locomotives; these were initially operated in a top and tail formation, but later on their own. Four were repainted at Cardiff Canton, 57314 and 57315 receiving ATW livery, 57313 and 57316 plain blue with no signwriting. In March 2012, Class 67 locomotives took over the duties from the Class 57/3s.

===Colas Rail===
From the start of 2007 until 31 October 2009, the freight haulage company Colas Rail hired Class 57/3 locos from Virgin Trains to haul its timber trains. Starting in August 2009, a Class 57/0 was hired from Direct Rail Services on a trial basis for one or two days each week. Unlike the Virgin Trains Class 57/3s, all sixteen of which were variously used on the timber trains, Direct Rail Services specifically allocated 57002 to the Colas workings with 57008 as standby when 57002 was undergoing maintenance. 

===Freightliner===

During 1997, the recently privatised freight operator Freightliner placed an order for an initial six Class 57/0 locomotives. The first of these was released in July 1998, and coincided with the unveiling of the new British Racing Green Freightliner livery. After an evaluation period, Freightliner was sufficiently impressed to order a further six during June 1999, and stated its long-term plans to eventually acquire a fleet of 25 Class 57s. However, this plan was abandoned and no further Class 57s would be ordered by the company, largely due to Freightliner switching preference towards new-built Class 66s and opting to transfer its remaining Class 47s to the metal recycler CF Booth. 

During 2007, Freightliner started to replace its Class 57/0s with new Class 66 locomotives. Initially six Class 57/0s (the second batch) were returned to Porterbrook, and leased to Direct Rail Services in July 2007. Of the original six, three also went to Direct Rail Services and two to Advenza Freight in January 2008. The remaining Class 57/0 was sold to West Coast Railways in January 2011.

All were named:
===Network Rail===

During September 2011, Network Rail leased six Class 57/3s from Porterbrook, which were initially intended for use on test trains and the company&#x27;s deicing trains. 

Network Rail&#x27;s Class 57 fleet was also expected to occasionally operate with 171, 350, 375, 376, 377, 444 and 450s in response to emergencies, their primary operational area was the Southern Region. During early 2013, the organisation openly stated its target for emergency rescue operations in the region was to keep five Class 57s continuously available to respond; of these, two were fitted with tightlock couplings while three featured Dellner couplings instead. Typically, rescued trains would be hauled onto the nearest convenient station, but the Class 57 had sufficient capabilities to haul most trains through their original schedule if desired. To achieve the necessary compatibilities to work with various EMUs, the locomotives were outfitted with multiple types of adapter cables, pressure switches, and pickups to convey electricity and other services, such as pressurised air, to the rescued train. In July 2014, the leases were transferred to Direct Rail Services.

===Rail Operations Group===

During October 2018, the Rail Operations Group (ROG) confirmed a long-term lease for two Class 57 owned by Direct Rail Services. In October 2019, it was confirmed that ROG would lease a third Class 57/3 from Direct Rail Services. In March 2022, it was announced that the lease of the four Class 57s would be terminated and the locomotives returned to Direct Rail Services.

===Virgin Trains West Coast===


During April 2002, Virgin Trains West Coast signed a deal with Porterbrook for the rebuilding of 12 Class 47s into Class 57/3s, to create a fleet of locomotives for rescue duties, as well as haul electric trains along routes that lacked overhead wires to power them directly. The first of the locomotives was delivered in June 2002. After the discovery of structural defects, 47844 and 47849, which were to become 57307 and 57303, were replaced after they had been stripped down.

After it was announced by the Strategic Rail Authority during June 2003 that Class 390 &quot;Pendolinos&quot; would operate along the North Wales Coast Line to Holyhead hauled by Class 57/3s, a further four were ordered to expand Virgin&#x27;s fleet. Furthermore, it was decided to fit the fleet with Dellner retractable couplings, and the original 12 Class 57/3s were retrofitted with the coupling from October 2003. 

From spring 2005, Class 57/3s were used to haul two daily Virgin services from Crewe to Holyhead, complementing the Class 221 &quot;Super Voyagers&quot; that covered the other North Wales services. The downside of this arrangement was that whilst the Class 390 &quot;Pendolino&quot; sets are longer and have the added advantage of running off OHLE south of Crewe, coupling and uncoupling at Crewe added to the journey time. From December 2008, all North Wales Coast services were operated by Super Voyagers, except for one Saturday service, formed by a Class 57/3 and Class 390 &quot;Pendolino&quot; set. However, that was also converted to Voyager operation in November 2012.

As a nod to their purpose as rescue engines, Virgin named the engines after characters and vehicles from the TV series &quot;Thunderbirds.&quot; In keeping with that theme, the engines also bore special plates with the International Rescue logo above their regular nameplates including:

All were named:
After the completion of the West Coast Main Line upgrade in 2008, Virgin&#x27;s need for Class 57/3s decreased. The sixteen-strong fleet found other work with both Arriva Trains Wales and Colas Rail. During September 2010, six were placed in warm storage at Eastleigh Works before being returned to Porterbrook and leased to Network Rail in September 2011. 

In December 2012, the remaining seven Class 57/3s were returned, three of which were leased to Direct Rail Services, and the other four were sold to West Coast Railways.

<text>The British Rail Class 89 is a prototype electric locomotive. Only one was built, in 1986, by British Rail Engineering Limited&#x27;s Crewe Works. It was used on test-trains on both the West Coast and East Coast Main Lines. The locomotive was fitted with advanced power control systems and developed more than 6,000 bhp (4,500 kW). After being withdrawn in 1992, it was returned to service in 1996, before being again withdrawn in 2000. As of January 2021, it is in the final stages of an overhaul that will return it to the main line.

==Design==
The Class 89 locomotive was designed by Brush Traction, Loughborough to meet a specification issued by British Rail. BR subsequently changed the requirements of this specification, but not before Brush had committed to building the prototype locomotive.

The locomotive has six DC traction motors. The main armature current for all the motors is fed from a common thyristor drive, with each motor having an independent field current controller. The field current controllers comprise a two quadrant chopper inside a thyristor bridge. The bipolar transistor based choppers provide a fast fine control of motor torque for electric braking and slip control, while the thyristor bridge is used to invert the field current polarity.

==History==

The specification for the locomotive was laid out in mid 1981, which then went out to tender in April 1982. The contract to build the locomotive was awarded to Brush in June 1983, with BREL Crewe as the nominated subcontractor and delivery planned for September 1985.

The locomotive was built at British Rail Engineering Limited&#x27;s Crewe Works in 1986, emerging and being initially delivered to Derby Litchurch Lane Works on 2 October 1986. The Class 89 was then transferred by road to Brush Traction at Loughborough for static testing and commissioning.

The locomotive was taken to Crewe Electric TMD on 9 February 1987. The following day, it first ran under its own power, inside the depot perimeter. The first lone run on the mainline was on 20 February 1987. On 6 March 1987, the locomotive visited the Railway Technical Centre for weighing and other tests. 89001 was moved to the Old Dalby Test Track for evaluation and pantograph tuning on 13 April 1987. The locomotive was initially allocated to Crewe Electric depot for trials along the West Coast Main Line. Main line running between Crewe, Willesden and Carlisle was performed with the BREL International rake of Mark 3 coaches, along with measurement coaches. Following successful testing, 89001 was transferred to Hornsey on 9 December 1987, having been run for by that point. The locomotive was later transferred to Bounds Green, for passenger services on the East Coast Main Line. In May 1988 the locomotive returned to Old Dalby for braking trials. On 22 May 1988, 89001 along with a Class 90, Class 91 and Class 150 left for Hamburg for display at the International Traffic and Transport Exhibition, returning on 17 June 1988.

On 3 July 1988, the locomotive hauled the &quot;Mallard&quot; 50th anniversary special from London King&#x27;s Cross, along with the return journey. The locomotive began regular passenger service from London King&#x27;s Cross to Peterborough on 15 July 1988. As the development of the ECML Electrification continued, the engine was painted into the new style InterCity Swallow livery and named &quot;Avocet&quot;, in recognition of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on 16 January 1989 at King&#x27;s Cross station. After the ceremony the locomotive hauled a special train conveying the RSPB president Magnus Magnusson, along with other VIPs, to Sandy. Passenger use continued on the ECML until 5 March 1989, a week before the Class 91s entered service on the diagrams.

89001 suffered a serious failure and was withdrawn from traffic in July 1992. At the time of its failure it was still owned by British Rail and Brush had no contractual obligation with regard to it. Additionally, having received no orders from BR in return for their design investment, there was little incentive for Brush to construct spare parts for it. BR had written off the locomotive financially as part of the ECML development; thus it was seen as surplus and of nil value as an asset. As such, the locomotive was sidelined.

It was saved for preservation at the Midland Railway Centre by a group of Brush Traction employees. During this period of ownership the locomotive appeared at every major British Rail depot open day, in a slowly deteriorating Intercity Swallow livery.

===Legacy===
It was hoped that the Class 89 design would be used for electric locomotives for the Channel Tunnel and some investigation was undertaken. It was also hoped the Class 89 would be a viable Class 86 replacement; however an upgraded version of the Class 87 was ordered instead, as the Class 90.

Ultimately only technology and ideas from 89001&#x27;s internal design were used in the Class 9 Eurotunnel locomotives, and some similarity in electronics lives on today in the Class 92 locomotive design. Brush did eventually win the contracts to build Channel Tunnel locomotives, and similarities between these and 89001 enabled suitable spares to be constructed.

==GNER ownership==
In 1996 the InterCity East Coast franchise was won by the Great North Eastern Railway (GNER). Suffering from a motive power shortage, it purchased 89001 and repaired it for use on London to Leeds and Bradford services, investing £100,000 in an overhaul. It was also repainted in the GNER blue and orange livery. The locomotive returned to service in March 1997. However, in October 2000 the locomotive again suffered a major failure and was withdrawn from traffic. Its future was again in doubt, and it was laid up at Doncaster Works. It moved to Bounds Green TMD in December 2001 for use as a depot generator, before returning to Doncaster.

In December 2004 the locomotive was moved into the care of the AC Locomotive Group at Barrow Hill Engine Shed for secure storage. With the overhaul of the British Rail Class 91 fleet complete, along with the availability of Class 373 trains for lease, 89001 was seen as a one-off asset with little economic value.

==Preservation==

In October 2006 GNER put 89001 up for sale, with a six-week deadline for bids. The AC Locomotive Group launched an appeal and fundraising effort to save the locomotive, which was ultimately successful, and purchased it in December 2006. The locomotive was mostly complete, although a number of major components required expensive overhaul before it could run on the main line again. A thorough survey was undertaken to establish exactly what was required and costs drawn up. Cosmetic work in 2007 saw the loco return to its original InterCity Executive colour scheme. Electrical restoration work focused on repairing and/or refurbishing the items that led to the locomotive being withdrawn from service, namely the traction motors and their associated field converter electronics. The locomotive was lifted by Harry Needle Railroad Company at Barrow Hill Engine Shed in December 2010 and three traction motors were removed, including the one known to be faulty. In February 2011 these were being examined at Bowers to allow repair cost estimates to be made. Two of the field converters were removed, one being faulty, and again repair estimates were sought. Initially it was intended, as funds became available, to allow one power group (i.e. one bogie) to become fully operational.

On 30 April 2020 the locomotive was moved from Barrow Hill Engine Shed to Toton TMD to be repainted. It was outshopped in Intercity Swallow Livery. In October 2020 it was hauled to Soho TMD for testing. In December 2021, the AC Locomotive Group announced it had formed a new partnership with Locomotive Services Limited (LSL) that would see the remaining tasks in the overhaul completed and 89001 returned to the mainline. Once complete, it will operate with LSL for five years.

==Models==
Class 89 89001 is being made as a kit and as a ready-to-run model in OO gauge by Silver Fox Models.

In 2020, Accurascale announced their intention to manufacture a ready-to-run model in OO gauge to be sold as a Rails of Sheffield Exclusive Model.

==Other uses of Class 89==
Since 1989, numbers in the Class 89 range have been used to register preserved mainline-accredited diesel and electric locomotives, except shunters, on TOPS and its successor systems. These locomotives can continue to display their historic numbers, but are identified in industry data systems by their 89xxx identity.

<doc id="776432" wikidata="Q811132" url="?curid=776432" title="Baucau Municipality">
<text>Baucau (, ) is a municipality, and was formerly a district, of East Timor, on the northern coast in the eastern part of the country. The capital is also called Baucau (formerly Vila Salazar). The population of the municipality is 111,694 (census 2010) and it has an area of 1,506 km2.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Baucau&quot; is derived from the word &quot;Akau&quot;, which means &quot;pig&quot; in the local Waimoa language. During the Portuguese colonial era, the name of the district was transformed, first into &quot;Macau&quot; and finally into &quot;Baucau&quot;. An alternative name for the Baucau community is &quot;Wailia-Wailewa&quot;, meaning the &quot;great water spring of Wai Lia&quot;. In the Wai Lia area (part of the &quot;suco&quot; of ), a large spring is located under large trees; it is both an animist and a Christian holy place.

In 1936, the Portuguese colonial authorities renamed what was then the district of Baucau as &quot;São Domingos&quot;. However, that name, like other imperial-sounding names adopted in the colony at about that time, did not catch on, and a few years after World War II it was quietly abandoned.

==Geography==

The borders of the District of Baucau during the colonial era were the same as they are now. The north edge of the municipality is to the Wetar Strait; it also borders the municipalities of Lautém to the east, Viqueque to the south, and Manatuto to the west.

Baucau also has a wide coastline with sandy beaches, ideal for swimming and other watersports.

In the administrative post of Venilale are tunnels that the Japanese built during their occupation during the Second World War. Also in this administrative post is an ongoing project to reconstruct and renovate the Escola do Reino de Venilale (School of the Kingdom of Venilale).

==Administrative posts==
The municipality&#x27;s administrative posts (formerly sub-districts) are:
*Baguia
*Baucau
*Laga
*Quelicai
*Vemasse
*Venilale (formerly known as Vila Viçosa).

==Demographics==
Besides the national official languages of Tetum and Portuguese, most of the inhabitants speak the Papuan language Makasae. While most of the inhabitants are Roman Catholics, a few Muslims also live there.

==Economy==
Baucau has the most highly developed agriculture in East Timor. Besides the staples rice and corn, Baucau produces beans, peanuts, sweet potatoes, copra, candlenut and manioc. It also raises buffalo and goats. A shortage of transportation links and the unpredictability of energy availability stymie the development of emerging industries.
==Infrastructure==
Baucau has the country&#x27;s longest airport runway, in Cakung Airport, as currently, Dili&#x27;s Nicolau Lobato International Airport can only serve small airliners like the Boeing 737. The airport is located six km from the city of Baucau. It served as the country&#x27;s principal airport before the Indonesian invasion in 1975, when it was taken over by the Indonesian military. Bucoli, a village with symbolic role in the East Timorese resistance movement, is located in the subdistrict of Baucau.

<text>Nastaliq (; , ; ), also romanized as Nastaʿlīq or Nastaleeq, is one of the main calligraphic hands used to write the Perso-Arabic script and it is used for some Indo-Iranian languages, predominantly Classical Persian, Kashmiri, Punjabi and Urdu. It is often used also for Ottoman Turkish poetry, but rarely for Arabic. &quot;Nastaliq&quot; developed in Iran from &quot;naskh&quot; beginning in the 13th century and remains widely used in Iran, India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and other countries for written poetry and as a form of art.

== History ==
The name &quot;Nastaliq&quot; &quot;is a contraction of the Persian (), meaning a hanging or suspended &quot;naskh.&quot;&quot; Virtually all Safavid authors (like Dust Muhammad or Qadi Ahmad) attributed the invention of to Mir Ali Tabrizi, who lived at the end of the 14th and the beginning of the 15th century. That tradition was questioned by Elaine Wright, who traced the evolution of &quot;Nastaliq&quot; in 14th-century Iran and showed how it developed gradually among scribes in Shiraz. According to her studies, &quot;nastaliq&quot; has its origin from &quot;naskh&quot; alone, and not by combining &quot;naskh&quot; and &quot;taliq&quot;, as was commonly thought. In addition to study of the practice of calligraphy, Elaine Wright also found a document written by Jafar Tabrizi , according to whom:

Thus, &quot;our earliest written source also credits Shirazi scribes with the development of &quot;nastaʿliq&quot; and Mir ʿAli Tabrizi with its canonization.&quot; The picture of origin of &quot;nastaliq&quot; presented by Elaine Wright was further complicated by studies of Francis Richard, who on the basis of some manuscripts from Tabriz argued that its early evolution was not confined to Shiraz. Finally, many authors point out that development of &quot;nastaʿliq&quot; was a process which takes a few centuries. For example, Gholam-Hosayn Yusofi, Ali Alparslan and Sheila Blair recognize gradual shift towards &quot;nastaʿliq&quot; in some 13th-century manuscripts. Hamid Reza Afsari traces first elements of the style in 11th-century copies of Persian translations of the Qur&#x27;an.

Persian differs from Arabic in its proportion of straight and curved letters. It also lacks the definite article &quot;al-&quot;, whose upright &quot;alif&quot; and &quot;lam&quot; are responsible for distinct verticality and rhythm of the text written in Arabic. Hanging scripts like &quot;taliq&quot; and &quot;nastaliq&quot; were suitable for writing Persian – when &quot;taliq&quot; was used for court documents, &quot;nastaliq&quot; was developed for Persian poetry, &quot;whose hemistiches encourage the pile-up of letters against the intercolumnar ruling. Only later was it adopted for prose.&quot;

The first master of &quot;nastaliq&quot; was aforementioned Mir Ali Tabrizi, who passed his style to his son ʿUbaydallah. The student of Ubaydallah, Jafar Tabrizi (d. 1431) (see quote above), moved to Herat, when he became the head of the scriptorium (&quot;kitabkhana&quot;) of prince Baysunghur (therefore his epithet Baysunghuri). Jafar trained several students in &quot;nastaliq&quot;, of whom the most famous was Azhar Tabrizi (d. 1475). Its classical form &quot;nastaliq&quot; achieved under Sultan Ali Mashhadi (d. 1520), a student of Azhar (or perhaps one of Azhar&#x27;s students) who worked for Sultan Husayn Bayqara (1469–1506) and his vizier Ali-Shir Nava&#x27;i. At the same time a different style of &quot;nastaliq&quot; developed in western and southern Iran. It was associated with ʿAbd al-Rahman Khwarazmi, the calligrapher of the Pir Budaq Qara Qoyunlu (1456–1466) and after him was followed by his children, ʿAbd al-Karim Khwarazmi and ʿAbd al-Rahim Anisi (both active at the court of Ya&#x27;qub Beg Aq Qoyunlu; 1478–1490). This more angular western Iranian style was largely dominant at the beginning of the Safavid era, but then lost to the style canonized by Sultan Ali Mashhadi – although it continued to be used in the Indian subcontinent.

The most famous calligrapher of the next generation in eastern lands was Mir Ali Heravi (d. 1544), who was master of &quot;nastaliq&quot;, especially renowned for his calligraphic specimens (&quot;qitʿa&quot;). The eastern style of &quot;nastaliq&quot; became the predominant style in western Iran, as artists gravitated to work in Safavid royal scriptorium. The most famous of these calligraphers working for the court in Tabriz was Shah Mahmud Nishapuri (d. 1564/1565), known especially for the unusual choice of &quot;nastaliq&quot; as a script used for the copy of the Qur&#x27;an. Its apogeum &quot;nastaliq&quot; achieved in writings of Mir Emad Hassani (d. 1615), &quot;whose style was the model in the following centuries.&quot; Mir Emad&#x27;s successors in the 17th and 18th centuries had developed a more elongated style of &quot;nastaliq&quot;, with wider spaces between words. Mirza Mohammad Reza Kalhor (d. 1892), the most important calligrapher of the 19th century, reintroduced the more compact style, writing words on a smaller scale in a single motion. In the 19th century &quot;nastaliq&quot; was also adopted in Iran for lithographed books. In the 20th century, &quot;the use of &quot;nastaliq&quot; declined. After World War II, however, interest in calligraphy and above all in &quot;nastaliq&quot; revived, and some outstandingly able masters of the art have since then emerged.&quot;

The use of &quot;nastaliq&quot; very early expanded beyond Iran. Timurids brought it to the India subcontinent and &quot;nastaliq&quot; became favorite script at the Persian court of the Mughals. For Akbar (1556–1605) and Jahangir (1605–1627) worked such famous masters of &quot;nastaliq&quot; as Muhammad Husayn Kashmiri (d. 1611/1612) and Abd al-Rahim Anbarin-Qalam. Another important practitioner of the script was Abd al-Rashid Daylami (d. 1671), nephew and student of Mir Emad, who after his arrival in India became court calligrapher of Shah Jahan (1628–1658). During this era &quot;Nastaliq&quot; became the common script for writing the Hindustani language, especially Standard Urdu.

&quot;Nastaliq&quot; was also adopted in Ottoman Empire, which has always had strong cultural ties to Iran. Here it was known as &quot;taliq&quot; (Turkish &quot;talik&quot;), which should not be confused with Persian &quot;taliq script&quot;. First Iranian calligraphers who brought &quot;nastaliq&quot; to Ottoman lands, like Asadullah Kirmani (d. 1488), belonged to the western tradition. But relatively early Ottoman calligraphers adopted eastern style of &quot;nastaliq&quot;. In 17th century, student of Mir Emad, Darvish Abdi Bokharai (d. 1647), transplanted his style to Istanbul. The greatest master of &quot;nastaliq&quot; in 18th century was Mehmed Yasari (d. 1798), who closely followed Mir Emad. This tradition was further developed by son of Yasari, Mustafa Izzet (d. 1849), who was a real founder of distinct Ottoman school of &quot;nastaliq&quot;. He introduced new and precise proportions of the script, different than in Iranian tradition. The most important member of this school in the second half of the 19th century was Sami Efendi (d. 1912), who taught many famous practitioners of &quot;nastaliq&quot;, like Mehmed Nazif Bey (d. 1913), Mehmed Hulusi Yazgan (d. 1940) and Necmeddin Okyay (d. 1976). The specialty of Ottoman school was &quot;celî nastaliq&quot; used in inscriptions and mosque plates.

== &quot;Nastaliq&quot; ==
&#x27; or &#x27; (, , &quot;cursive &quot; or literally &quot;broken &quot;) style is a &quot;streamlined&quot; form of . Its development is connected with the fact that &quot;the increasing use of nastaʿlīq and consequent need to write it quickly exposed it to a process of gradual attrition.&quot; The &quot;shekasteh nastaliq&quot; emerged in the early 17th century and differed from proper &quot;nastaliq&quot; only in so far as some of the letters were shrunk (shekasteh, lit. &quot;broken&quot;) and detached letters and words were sometimes joined. These unauthorized connections &quot;mean that calligraphers can write &quot;shekasteh&quot; faster than any other script.&quot; Manuscripts from this early period show signs of the influence of &quot;shekasteh taliq&quot;; while having the appearance of a shrunken form of nastaliq, they also contain features of &quot;taliq&quot; &quot;due to their being written by scribes who had been trained in taʿlīq.&quot; &quot;Shekasteh nastaliq&quot; (usually shortened to simply &quot;skehasteh&quot;), being more easily legible than &quot;taliq&quot; gradually replaced the latter as the script of decrees and documents. Later, it also came into use for writing prose and poetry.

The first important calligraphers of &quot;shekasteh&quot; were Mohammad Shafiʿ Heravi (d. 1670–71) (he was known as Shafiʿa and hence &quot;shekasteh&quot; was sometimes called &quot;shafiʿa&quot; or &quot;shifiʿa&quot;) and Mortazaqoli Khan Shamlu (d. 1688–89). Both of them produced works of real artistic quality, which does not change the fact that in this early phase &quot;shekasteh&quot; still lacked consistency (it is especially visible in writing of Mortazaqoli Khan Shamlu). Most modern scholars consider that &quot;shekasteh&quot; reached its peak of artistic perfection under Abdol Majid Taleqani (d. 1771), &quot;who gave the script its distinctive and definite form.&quot; The tradition of Taleqani was later followed by Mirza Kuchek Esfahani (d. 1813), Gholam Reza Esfahani (d. 1886–87) and Ali Akbar Golestaneh (d. 1901).

The added frills made &quot;shekasteh&quot; increasingly difficult to read and it remained the script of documents and decrees, &quot;while &quot;nastaʿliq&quot; retained its pre-eminence as the main calligraphic style.&quot; The need for simplification of &quot;shekasteh&quot; resulted in development of secretarial style (&quot;shekasteh-ye tahriri&quot;) by writers like Adib-al-Mamalek Farahani (d. 1917) and Nezam Garrusi (d. 1900). The secretarial style is a simplified form of &quot;shekasteh&quot; which is faster to write and read, but less artistic. Long used in governmental and other institutions in Iran, &quot;shekasteh&quot; degenerated in the first half of the 20th century, but later again engaged the attention of calligraphers. &quot;Shekasteh&quot; was used only in Iran and to a small extent in Afghanistan and Ottoman Empire. Its use in Afghanistan was different from the Persian norm and sometimes only as experimental devices (&quot;tafannon&quot;)

== &quot;Nastaliq&quot; typesetting ==
Modern typography began with the invention of &quot;Noori Nastaleeq&quot; which was first created as a digital font in 1981 through the collaboration of Ahmed Mirza Jamil (as calligrapher) and Monotype Imaging (formerly Monotype Corp &amp; Monotype Typography). Although this employed over 20,000 ligatures (individually designed character combinations), it provided accurate results and allowed newspapers such as Pakistan&#x27;s &quot;Daily Jang&quot; to use digital typesetting instead of a group of calligraphers. It suffered from two problems in the 1990s: its non-availability on standard platforms such as Microsoft Windows or Mac OS, and the non-WYSIWYG nature of text entry, whereby the document had to be created by commands in Monotype&#x27;s proprietary page description language.


=== InPage ===
In 1994, InPage Urdu, which is a functional page layout software for Windows akin to QuarkXPress, was developed for Pakistan&#x27;s newspaper industry by an Indian software company Concept Software Pvt Ltd. It offered the &quot;Noori Nastaliq&quot; font licensed from Monotype Imaging. This font is still used in current versions of the software for Windows. As of 2009, InPage has become Unicode based, supporting more languages and the &quot;Faiz Lahori Nastaliq&quot; font with Kasheeda has been added to it along with compatibility with OpenType Unicode fonts.

=== Cross platform Nastaliq fonts ===

* Windows 8 was the first version of Microsoft Windows to have native Nastaliq support, through Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Urdu Typesetting&quot; font.

* Google has an open-source Nastaliq font called Noto Nastaliq Urdu. Apple provides this font on all Mac installations since macOS High Sierra. Likewise, Apple has carried this font on iOS devices since iOS 11.
* Awami Nastaliq features a more extensive character set than most Nastaliq typefaces, supporting: Urdu, Balochi, Persian, Khowar, Palula, Saraiki, Shina.
* Amar Nastaleeq was created for web embedding on Urdu websites in 2013. The font was announced by Urdu poet Fahmida Riaz.

== Letter forms ==
The &quot;Nastaliq&quot; style uses more than three general forms for many letters, even in non-decorative documents. For example, most documents written in Urdu.

==In Unicode==

Nastaliq is not separately encoded in Unicode as it is a particular style of Arabic script and not a writing system in its own right. Nastaliq letterforms are produced by choosing a Nastaliq font to display the text.

<text>In ballet, a (French, literally &quot;step of two&quot;) is a dance duet in which two dancers, typically a male and a female, perform ballet steps together. The &quot;pas de deux&quot; is characteristic of classical ballet and can be found in many well-known ballets, including &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, and &quot;Giselle&quot;. It is most often performed by a male and a female (a &quot;danseur&quot; and a &quot;ballerina&quot;) though there are exceptions, such as in the film &quot;White Nights&quot;, in which a &quot;pas de deux&quot; is performed by Mikhail Baryshnikov and Gregory Hines.

==&quot;Grand pas de deux&quot;==

A grand pas de deux is a structured &quot;pas de deux&quot; that typically has five parts, consisting of an &quot;entrée&quot; (introduction), an &quot;adagio&quot;, two variations (a solo for each dancer), and a &quot;coda&quot; (conclusion). It is effectively a suite of dances that share a common theme, often symbolic of a love story or the partnership inherent in love, with the dancers portraying expressions of affectionate feelings and thoughts between romantic partners. It is often considered to be the &quot;pièce de résistance&quot; and bravura highlight of a ballet and is usually performed by a leading pair of principal dancers.

===&quot;Entrée&quot;===
A &quot;grand pas de deux&quot; usually begins with an &quot;entrée&quot; (literally &quot;entrance&quot;), which serves as a short prelude to and also unequivocally denotes the beginning of the dance suite. During the &quot;entrée&quot;, the dancers first appear on the stage and, typically with great pageantry, acknowledge each other and position themselves near each other in preparation for the subsequent &quot;adagio&quot;. Depending on the choreography, the ballerina and danseur may enter the stage simultaneously or at different times.

===&quot;Adagio&quot;===
The &quot;adagio&quot; or &quot;adage&quot; (meaning &quot;slowly&quot;) part of a &quot;grand pas de deux&quot; features graceful and elaborate partnering by the dancing pair. In the &quot;adagio&quot;, the ballerina performs elegant, often slow and sustained movements while the danseur supports her. The danseur, in turn, strives to maintain a display of poise and seemingly effortless strength while providing support for the ballerina. The danseur may support the ballerina in a variety of common ways, including lifting her, holding and steadying her during turns, and offering a steady arm or hand for her to use as a &quot;virtual barre&quot; when she performs balancing feats that would be difficult or impossible without assistance. Because of this support the adagio is sometimes called &quot;supported adagio&quot;. 
===Variations===
Upon completion of the &quot;adagio&quot;, the dancers separate and each dancer, in turn, takes center stage and performs a &quot;variation&quot; (a solo dance). In general, the variations are intended to showcase spectacular, acrobatic leaps and turns, as well as the skills and athleticism of the individual dancers. The danseur&#x27;s variation is usually performed first, followed by the ballerina&#x27;s variation.

===Coda===
The &quot;coda&quot; (literally &quot;tail&quot;) is the concluding segment of a &quot;grand pas de deux&quot;. Typically, it is a recapitulation of earlier segments of the &quot;grand pas de deux&quot;, consisting of elements that are characteristic of the &quot;adagio&quot;, variations, or both, and ends during a grand musical climax.

==History==

Elements of the &quot;grand pas de deux&quot; first appeared in the early 18th century as opening acts of operas and ballets in which a couple would perform identical dance steps, sometimes while holding hands. At that time and throughout the Baroque period, ballet partner dancing was evolving to show more dramatic content. For example, in &quot;The Loves of Mars and Venus&quot; ballet of 1717, Mars (the male dancer) strove to portray gallantry, respect, ardent love, and adoration, while Venus showed bashfulness, reciprocal love, and wishful looks.

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a romantic &quot;pas de deux&quot; emerged that involved closer physical contact, with ballerinas dancing on their toes in the hands of their partners. As the 19th century progressed, the form became a showcase for the skills of the increasingly sophisticated ballerina.

The ballets of the late 19th Century—particularly of those of Marius Petipa—introduced the concept of the &quot;grand pas de deux&quot;, which often served as the climax of a scene or an entire performance. This involved a consistent format of &quot;entrée&quot; and &quot;adagio&quot; by a pair of leading male and female dancers, followed by virtuosic solos (first by the male and then the female) and a finale. During the 20th century, the &quot;grand pas de deux&quot; became more integrated with the story of the ballet, with increasingly acrobatic content.

<text>La Secta AllStar (or simply La Secta) is a rock en Español band from Puerto Rico. The band members are Mark Kilpatrick (bass guitar), Gustavo Laureano (singer), John Lengel (drums), and Mike Genao (guitar). They are known mostly for the song &quot;La Locura Automática&quot;.

==Band history==
Mark Kilpatrick and Gustavo Laureano met in Orlando, Florida where they studied sound engineering. After graduating they moved to Miami Beach and started working. They also began rehearsing in a local warehouse along with drummer John Lengel and guitarist Carlos Figueroa. They soon began writing and composing their songs and started playing at local clubs in Miami and Puerto Rico. It is during this time that artists like Ricky Martin and Ednita Nazario discovered them. In 1995, Martin recorded the song &quot;Bombón de Azúcar&quot; and in 1996, Nazario recorded &quot;Ultima Vez&quot;, also written by Laureano.

José Fernández Camilo became their manager and introduced them to producer Jorge Álvarez. Alvarez then introduced them to Andrés Levin, and La Secta Allstar signed a record deal with Fonovisa soon after. Their debut album, &quot;Aniquila&quot;, was released in 1997 producing four Top 40 hit singles: &quot;Se Acabó&quot;, &quot;Recompensa&quot;, &quot;Nunca Jamás&quot; and &quot;Bombón de Azúcar&quot;. This album was re-released in 1999 under the title &quot;Bombón de Azúcar&quot;. The main difference is that the new album did not include the songs &quot;Si Tú No Estás&quot; and &quot;Mar y Marea&quot;. These were in turn substituted by the Spanglish version of &quot;Bombón de Azúcar&quot; and a new track titled &quot;Luna de Día&quot;. &quot;Bombón de Azúcar&quot; was again re-released in 2007 with the addition of &quot;Mar y Marea&quot; while &quot;Si Tú No Estás&quot; has not been rereleased.

In January 2001, the band presented a sold-out concert at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan. After this and the success of this first album, the band released the follow-up titled &quot;La Secta Allstar&quot; in April 2001. This album was recorded and produced by the band itself. Four days after the release, the album had already sold 25,000 copies. The single &quot;Dame Lo Que Quieras&quot; peaked at local radio stations and won an ASCAP Award.

In 2004, the band released a fourth album titled &quot;Túnel&quot;. The album won a &quot;Premio Lo Nuestro&quot; award in the category of Best Rock Album. Shortly after guitarist Carlos Figueroa left the band, and Mike Genao replaced him, and the band then released their fifth album, &quot;Consejo&quot;, with Universal Latino. Consejo is the most successful album from La Secta. The album was certified Gold and Platinum under the RIAA in only two months after its release. The mega hit &quot;La Locura Automática&quot;, reached No. 1 in more than 13 countries (5 months No. 1 in Colombia). The album featured collaborations with many noted artists like Wilkins and reggaeton artists Wisin &amp; Yandel. A remix of &quot;La Locura Automática&quot; can be found on &quot;12 Discípulos&quot;, a reggaeton album produced by Eddie Dee, and on the Deluxe Edition of &quot;Consejo&quot; (along with another remix and a bonus DVD). &quot;Consejo&quot; was also nominated to a Latin Grammy as Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album and a Premio Lo Nuestro award, and won a Billboard Award in the Best Rock/Alternative Band category.

After touring heavily for this album, the band decided to take a small break during which singer Gustavo Laureano released a solo project. In 2008, the band returned with their next album titled &quot;Fuego&quot;, which won the band a Premio Lo Nuestro in the Rock Album of The Year category, among other awards. By 2013, La Secta was working on the pre-production of &quot;SÚBELO&quot;, their new studio album. Finally, the project would not be launched until 2021, when they rejoined as a musical band, being for now, a compilation of singles.

<text>Michael Moore Hates America is a documentary film directed by Michael Wilson that criticizes the work of film director Michael Moore.

It premiered September 12, 2004, in Dallas, Texas, at the American Film Renaissance film festival.

== Overview ==

The film and its poster are patterned after Moore&#x27;s film &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot;, during which Moore attempts to chase down Roger Bonham Smith for an interview. In this case, Wilson seeks an interview with Moore. Wilson also adopts other aspects of Moore&#x27;s style in his efforts at satirizing Moore. For instance, Wilson interviews a mix of Americans across the country and well-known figures like conservatives Dinesh D&#x27;Souza, David Horowitz and Andrew Breitbart, liberal Albert Maysles and fellow libertarians such as Penn Jillette and Tim Slagle. Wilson revisits some of Moore&#x27;s shooting locations and subjects from &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot; and &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;, and criticizes many aspects of Moore&#x27;s films by alleging they include fabrications and misrepresentations. For example, a scene from the Moore film &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; depicting the NRA as callous and uncaring about victims of shootings is criticized by Wilson. Wilson also criticizes a scene in &quot;Columbine&quot; in which Moore enters a bank in Traverse City, Michigan, and walks out with a gun that he received as a perk for opening a deposit account. Wilson asserts that this scene is fabrication, and that Michael Moore had grossly misled, and in some cases lied, to the staff of the bank in order to get his desired shots for the &quot;Columbine&quot; film. Numerous other subjects of Moore&#x27;s films were later interviewed by Wilson in the &quot;Michael Moore Hates America&quot; film, many of which decried Moore&#x27;s work as overt propaganda, including double-arm amputee soldier Peter Damon in &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; who stated on camera for Wilson, &quot;I want nothing to do with that man [Moore] and his propaganda.&quot;

== Reception ==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film was found to receive a generally positive reception, with 75% of critics giving the movie favorable reviews. Some critics favored the film&#x27;s examination of Moore&#x27;s methods. The film was also nominated for Best Documentary from the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival. Ebert and Roeper gave it “Two thumbs up”.

<text>State Road 581 (SR 581), also known as Bruce B. Downs Boulevard, is a north–south road in Pasco and Hillsborough County
extending from State Road 56, north to SR 54 in Wesley Chapel. SR 581, along with County Road 581 (CR 581), which extends to the south of SR 581&#x27;s southern terminus, forms the major thoroughfare through New Tampa, a part of the city of Tampa annexed during the 1980s, to Wesley Chapel. The portion of the road north of State Road 582 was renamed in 1984 from 30th Street by Hillsborough&#x27;s Board of County Commissioners in honor of Bruce Barkley Downs, a deputy county administrator for public works.

==Route description==
State Road 581 begins at the intersection between the northern terminus of County Road 581 and State Road 56. State Road 581 takes Bruce B. Downs Boulevard northbound through a rapidly developing area, which is sparsely populated, ending at State Road 54.

===County Road 581===
County Road 581 is a 12.6-mile long county road, extending from State Road 580 (Busch Boulevard) in Tampa to State Road 56 in Wesley Chapel, where it becomes State Road 581. The road begins at the intersection with State Road 580, at the southwest corner of Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, where County Road 581 heads south as 30th Street, with residential areas to the west and Busch Gardens to the east. North of Bougainvillea Avenue, the road passes by a Yuengling brewing plant and a more commercial area, heading towards State Road 582 (Fowler Avenue), where the name changes to Bruce B. Downs Boulevard and forms the western boundary of the University of South Florida. Just north of the shopping centers, CR 581 passes through medical centers on both sides of the road, intersecting CR 582A (Fletcher Avenue), then leaving the medical area to residential areas, where the road starts to curve to the northeast, and enters a more sparsely populated area with newer developments. It then has an interchange with I-75, continuing to the northeast and crossing into Pasco County, where it terminates at State Road 54 in Wesley Chapel.

<doc id="776510" wikidata="Q7061105" url="?curid=776510" title="History of Copenhagen">
<text>The history of [[Copenhagen]] dates back to the first settlement at the site in the 11th century. From the middle of the 12th century it grew in importance after coming into the possession of Bishop Absalon, and the city was fortified with a stone wall during the 13th century. The harbour and the excellent possibilities for herring fishing contributed to Copenhagen&#x27;s growth and development into an important trading centre. It was repeatedly attacked by the Hanseatic League as the Germans became aware of its expansion. In 1254, it received its charter as a city under Bishop Jakob Erlandsen.

The town was significantly enlarged under Christian IV of Denmark after his coronation in 1596 by the addition of new city districts and modern fortifications with earthworks and bastions. The king commissioned German and Dutch architects and craftsmen to construct magnificent edifices designed to enhance his prestige. By the time of Christian IV&#x27;s death in 1648, Copenhagen had become Denmark&#x27;s principal fortification and naval port, and the town formed a framework for the administration of the Danish kingdom and as a centre of trade in Northern Europe.

During 1658-59 it withstood a severe siege by the Swedes under Charles X and successfully repelled a major assault. In 1728 and again in 1795, the city was ravaged by large fires, which destroyed most of the medieval part of town. In 1801, a British fleet under Admiral Parker fought a major battle, the Battle of Copenhagen, with the Danish navy in Copenhagen harbour. It was during this battle Lord Nelson &quot;put the telescope to the blind eye&quot; in order not to see Admiral Parker&#x27;s signal to cease fire. When a British expeditionary force bombarded Copenhagen in 1807 in order to take control of the Danish navy, thus denying it to nascent French plans to invade Britain, the city suffered great damage and hundreds of people were killed. The main reason for the extensive devastation was that Copenhagen relied on an old defence line rendered virtually useless by the long ranged bombard ships and mortar batteries employed by the British. But not until the 1850s were the ramparts of the city opened to allow new housing to be built around the lakes which bordered the old defence system to the west. This dramatic increase of space was long overdue, not only because the old ramparts were out of date as a defence system, but also because of bad sanitation in the old city. Before this relaxation, the historic centre of Copenhagen was inhabited by approximately 125,000 people, peaking in the census of 1870 (140,000); today the figure is around 25,000. In 1901, Copenhagen expanded further, incorporating communities with 40,000 people, and in the process making Frederiksberg an enclave within Copenhagen.

Since the summer 2000, the cities of Copenhagen and Malmö have been connected by a toll bridge/tunnel (Øresund Bridge) for both rail and road traffic. As a result, Copenhagen has become the centre of a larger metropolitan area which spans both nations. The construction of the bridge has effected many changes to the public transportation system and the extensive redevelopment of Amager, south of the main city.

==First settlements==
Signs of human activity dating back to about 4000 BCE have been found, but there are no signs of permanent settlements from that time.

Archaeological excavations indicate that the first town dates back to the 11th century and consisted of two settlements, one in the western part of the medieval city encircled by what are now the streets of Mikkel Bryggersgade, Vestergade, Gammeltorv/Nytorv and Løngangsstræde, roughly corresponding to the coastline of the time, and another smaller settlement at what is now Kongens Nytorv. The surrounding area consisted of moist beach meadows and signs of cattle grazing have been found. The city probably had a harbour located at present day Højbro Plads. Details of the existence of a small town as early as the 11th century have recently been published by Videnskab.dk with a series of articles documenting new archeological finds. These provide evidence of a large estate at today&#x27;s Kongens Nytorv, a church close to the later St Clemens, a market, at least two wells and many smaller habitations spread over a fairly wide area.

==Absalon&#x27;s town==
In the 12th century Copenhagen assumed increasing importance and the town was reinforced with earthworks. The Roman Catholic Church erected cathedrals in Roskilde and in Lund (in what is now Sweden), which laid the basis for further development in those regional centres. As Copenhagen was midway between the two cities, it was centrally located for traffic and trading.

The earliest written mention of the town dates back to the 12th century, when Saxo Grammaticus in Gesta Danorum refers to it as &quot;Portus Mercatorum&quot;, which translates into Merchants&#x27; Harbour or in the Danish of the time &quot;Købmannahavn&quot;. In a letter from 1186, Pope Urban III refers to the city as &quot;Hafn&quot;, but this is probably just a shortened version of the full name.

In around 1160, Valdemar I gave control of Copenhagen to Absalon, Bishop of Roskilde. Whereas other cities in the Danish realm were under the governance of the king, Copenhagen was given to the Bishop of Roskilde as its lord and master.

In the years that followed, the town grew tenfold in size. Churches and abbeys were founded. Copenhagen&#x27;s economy blossomed as a result of the hugely prosperous herring fishery trade, which provided large parts of Roman Catholic Europe with salted herring for Lent.

==Behind the new earthworks==

Copenhagen is located at the most important approach to the Baltic Sea and the rich North German trading towns of the Hanseatic League, providing it with power and wealth but also threatening its very existence. The city was fortified with a city wall of stone during the 13th century, and from about 1290 until the middle of the 19th century all traffic entering and leaving Copenhagen had to pass through one of Copenhagen&#x27;s four city gates or the harbour. Although several Danish towns had ramparts at the time, the majority of them were earth ramparts possibly with palisades on top and a moat. Copenhagen was the second Danish town after Kalundborg to be fortified with a wall and towers. This is a strong indication that it was an important town at the time.

The plague disaster known as the Black Death is likely to have taken place in the late summer of 1350.

Time and again the town was besieged and laid waste by the Hanseatic League. At the same time the Danish king was also attempting to take Copenhagen back from the bishop. The crown succeeded in 1416, when Eric of Pomerania took over control of the town. Thereafter Copenhagen came under the rule of the Danish Crown.

Despite centuries of power struggles and warring, the town grew increasingly rich. Copenhageners did a brisk trade with friend and foe alike. Foreign merchants came to the town. Craft guilds were established and in 1479 the University of Copenhagen was founded.

In 1581 Christopher Valkendorf supervised the largest expansion of the ramparts in the history of the city, as with the invention of cannons vastly extended earth ramparts were required.

==Renaissance==
By the time of Christian IV&#x27;s coronation in 1596, Copenhagen had become rich and powerful. The new king decided to make the town the economic, military, religious, and cultural centre for the whole of the Nordic region. The king established the first trading companies with sole rights to trade with lands overseas. In order to restrict imports, factories were set up so that as many goods as possible could be manufactured at home.

Christian IV expanded Copenhagen by adding two new districts: Nyboder (New Booths) for the large numbers of navy personnel and the merchants&#x27; new district Christianshavn (Christian&#x27;s Harbour), which is modelled after Amsterdam. A modern fortification with earthworks and bastions was built to surround the whole of the extended town.

Apart from the new earthworks Christian IV commissioned German and Dutch architects and craftsmen to construct magnificent edifices designed to enhance his prestige. To this day, the buildings make their mark on the cityscape of Copenhagen.

By the time of Christian IV&#x27;s death in 1648, Copenhagen had become Denmark&#x27;s principal fortification and naval port, and the town formed a framework for the administration of the Danish kingdom and as a centre of trade in Northern Europe.

During 1658–59 the city withstood a severe siege by the Swedes under Charles X Gustav.

==18th century==
In July 1700, Copenhagen underwent a bombardment from a British-Dutch-Swedish navy but did not suffer much damage. From June 1711 to March 1712, it was haunted by the plague which killed about a third of the population.

During the fire of 1728 about a third of the city (the entire northern part), 1,600 houses and five churches burned down in the course of four days. Christian VI tore the old Copenhagen Castle down in 1731–32 to replace it with Christiansborg Palace, and during the reign of Frederick V Frederiksstaden, the most distinguished district of Copenhagen, with Amalienborg Palace at its center, was developed.

Near the end of the 18th century, Copenhagen&#x27;s trade and the wealth that followed reached its so far highest level. Although the fire of 1795 destroyed about a quarter of the city and rendered 3,500 homeless, the damage was relatively quickly repaired and most of the city was rebuilt by the turn of the 19th century.

==19th century==
On 2 April 1801 a British fleet under the command of Admiral Sir Hyde Parker fought and defeated a Danish-Norwegian fleet anchored just off Copenhagen. Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson led the main attack. He famously disobeyed Parker&#x27;s order to withdraw, destroying many of the Dano-Norwegian ships before a truce was agreed. Copenhagen is often considered to be Nelson&#x27;s hardest fought battle, surpassing even the heavy fighting at Trafalgar. It was during this battle that Lord Nelson famously &quot;put the telescope to the blind eye&quot; in order not to see Admiral Parker&#x27;s signal to cease fire.

The Second Battle of Copenhagen (or the Bombardment of Copenhagen) (16 August – 5 September 1807) was a British preemptive attack on Copenhagen, targeting the civilian population in order to seize the Dano-Norwegian fleet. The British landed 30,000 man and surrounded Copenhagen. The attack continued for the next three days and resulted in the death of at least 2,000 civilians and destruction of most of the city. The devastation was so great because Copenhagen relied on an old defence-line rendered virtually useless by the increase in shooting range available to the British.

The political after-effects of the conflict did even greater damage to the city and the nation. If the previous 25 years had been a heyday for Copenhagen, the next 25 years became a period of poverty. Surprisingly science, literature and art blossomed. Following the July Revolution of 1830 the Danish liberal and national movement gained momentum, and after the European Revolutions of 1848 Denmark became a constitutional monarchy on June 5, 1849. On January 1, 1840, the city was given a new municipal constitution which was expanded on March 4, 1857.
Roughly at the same time the ramparts of the city opened to allow new housing to be built around the lakes (&quot;Søerne&quot;) which bordered the old defence system to the west. This dramatic increase in space was long overdue, not only because the old ramparts were out of date as a defence system, but also because of bad sanitation in the old city. As the area within the ramparts had been almost constant since the reign of Christian IV despite a fourfold increase in the population, the buildings had become taller and the amount of space available to residents had decreased. By relaxing the demarcation line introduced as a result of the defences, unrestricted permission to build property outside the lakes was introduced in 1852. This caused a considerable growth in Nørrebro, Vesterbro and Frederiksberg. A new neighbourhood arose in 1861–77 on the island of Gammelholm as Holmen Naval Base was moved to Nyholm, and large parts of Nyboder were changed into ordinary residences. In 1868 it was decided to remove the ramparts and from 1872 the old glacises were converted into residential areas. By the construction of Frihavn harbour in 1894 another neighbourhood was founded stretching towards Hellerup. In 1900–01, the large developments of Brønshøj and Valby followed.

The Second War of Schleswig in 1864 (where Denmark lost a third of its area) was the primary reason the old ramparts were replaced by the Fortification of Copenhagen.

==20th century==

During World War II Copenhagen was occupied by German troops along with the rest of the country from April 9, 1940, until May 4, 1945. In August 1943, when the government&#x27;s collaboration with the occupation forces collapsed, several ships were sunk in Copenhagen Harbour by the Royal Danish Navy to prevent them being used by the Germans. Operation Carthage (the bombardment of the Shellhouse, the headquarters of the Gestapo) took place on March 21, 1945, by British de Havilland Mosquito bombers. During this attack the French School at Frederiksberg was also mistakenly bombed resulting in the death of many children. On 8 May 1945 Copenhagen was officially liberated by British troops led by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery who supervised the surrender of 250,000 German armed forces across Denmark of which near on 30,000 were situated around the capital.

The city has grown greatly since the war. In the 1970s, the so-called five-finger-plan provided commuter train links to the surrounding towns and suburbs. Conditions in the central city deteriorated rapidly in the 1980s and 1990s. Financially the city verged on bankruptcy. Negative factors included de-industrialization, flight to the suburbs, high unemployment, escalating welfare, dilapidated housing, and ethnic strong segregation. The city recovered rapidly by 2010, thanks to its service- and knowledge-based economy.

In 1992 construction on the Copenhagen Metro and in 1993 development of a new city area, the Ørestad, began on the island of Amager. The metro underground train system opened for traffic in 2002.

Since the summer of 2000, the cities of Copenhagen and Malmö have been connected by a toll bridge, the Øresund Bridge, for both rail and road traffic. It was inaugurated in July 2000 by Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden and Margrethe II of Denmark. As a result, Copenhagen has become the centre of a larger metropolitan area spanning both nations. The construction of the bridge has brought about significant changes in the public transportation system and the extensive redevelopment of Amager, south of the main city. The bridge has not yet been as widely used by motorists as was originally hoped, likely due to the high road tolls, allegedly slowing the planned integration of the region. Train passengers, however, are plentiful and increasing in numbers. The lack of a commonly acceptable currency throughout the area is another hindrance to the integration of the region, even though a growing number of shops, restaurants etc., if not usually encouraged, accept payment with either nation&#x27;s currency in the other country.

In December 2009 Copenhagen hosted the worldwide climate meeting COP15. When US President Barack Obama participated in the end of this meeting it was the fourth time an American President had visited Copenhagen during his term (Obama also visited Copenhagen in October 2009, George W. Bush in 2005 and Bill Clinton in the 1990s).

<doc id="776520" wikidata="Q2830508" url="?curid=776520" title="Alan Furst">
<text>Alan Furst (; born 1941) is an American author of historical spy novels. Furst has been called &quot;an heir to the tradition of Eric Ambler and Graham Greene,&quot; whom he cites along with Joseph Roth and Arthur Koestler as important influences. Most of his novels since 1988 have been set just prior to or during the Second World War and he is noted for his successful evocations of Eastern European peoples and places during the period from 1933 to 1944.

==Biography==
Furst was born in New York City, and raised on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. His family has ancestors in Poland, Latvia, and Russia. His great-grandfather was drafted into the Russian army, and, as a Jew, was required to serve 20 years.

He attended the Horace Mann School, received a B.A. from Oberlin College in 1962, and an M.A. from Penn State in 1967.

While attending general studies courses at Columbia University, he became acquainted with Margaret Mead, for whom he later worked. Before becoming a full-time novelist, Furst worked in advertising and wrote magazine articles, most notably for &quot;Esquire&quot;, and as a columnist for the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;.

==Early writings==
Furst&#x27;s papers were obtained by the Harry Ransom Center at The University of Texas at Austin. They include a 1963 letter from his grandfather, Max Stockman, which urged Furst to become a teacher and &#x27;write as a sideline&#x27; in his spare time. The collection also includes early articles on a wide variety of topics, published in many magazines for which no common denominator can be found, including &quot;Architectural Digest&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;50 Plus&quot;, &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, &quot;Islands&quot;, &quot;New Choices&quot;, &quot;New York&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Pursuits&quot;, &quot;Salon&quot;, and &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot;.

The Ransom collection remarks: &quot;Of note is the April 1984 &quot;Esquire&quot; article, &#x27;The Danube Blues,&#x27; which sparked Furst&#x27;s interest in writing espionage novels. Numerous slides of his 1983 Danube trip are also available. Unproduced screenplays include &#x27;Heroes of the Last War&#x27; (1984), and &#x27;Warsaw&#x27; (1992).&quot;

His early novels (1976–1983) achieved limited success. One item, held in the Ransom collection, includes the manuscript for &quot;One Smart Cookie&quot; (with Debbi Fields, 1987), a commissioned biography of the owner of the Mrs. Fields Cookies company.

The year 1988 saw publication of &quot;Night Soldiers&quot;—inspired by his 1984 trip to Eastern Europe on assignment for &quot;Esquire&quot;—which invigorated his career and led to a succession of related titles. His output since 1988 includes a dozen works. He is especially noted for his successful evocations of Eastern European peoples and places during the period from 1933 to 1944. While all his historical espionage novels are loosely connected (protagonists in one book might appear as minor characters in another), only &quot;The World at Night&quot; and &quot;Red Gold&quot; share a common plot.

Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the novelist Justin Cartwright says that Furst, who lives in Sag Harbor, Long Island, &quot;has adopted a European sensibility.&quot; Awarded a Fulbright teaching fellowship in 1969, Furst moved to Sommières, France, outside of Montpellier, and taught at the University of Montpellier. He later lived for many years in Paris, a city that he calls &quot;the heart of civilisation&quot; which figures significantly in all his novels.

In 2011, the Tulsa Library Trust in Tulsa, Oklahoma selected Furst to receive its Helmerich Award, a literary prize given annually to honor a distinguished author&#x27;s body of work.

In 2012, he appeared in a documentary about the life and work of author W. Somerset Maugham, &quot;Revealing Mr. Maugham&quot;.

<text>Afrodiziak was a British singing group composed of Caron Wheeler, Claudia Fontaine, and later Naomi Thompson, that was active in the 1980s. As a duo, Wheeler and Fontaine were best known for performing backing vocals on the Jam&#x27;s final single &quot;Beat Surrender&quot; in 1982 (on whose final tour they performed) and Elvis Costello&#x27;s 1983 album &quot;Punch the Clock&quot;, especially its lead single, the international hit &quot;Everyday I Write the Book&quot;. 

After the addition of Naomi Thompson as a third member, Afrodiziak performed backing vocals on the hit single &quot;Free Nelson Mandela&quot;, including the a cappella intro, staging it on Channel 4&#x27;s music show &quot;The Tube&quot; in March 1984. Heaven 17&#x27;s 1984 album &quot;How Men Are&quot; featured them prominently, especially on the singles &quot;Sunset Now&quot; and &quot;And That&#x27;s No Lie&quot;. Afrodiziak performed on Madness&#x27;s albums &quot;Keep Moving&quot; and &quot;Mad Not Mad&quot; in 1984 and 1985, appearing in the music video for that group&#x27;s single &quot;Sweetest Girl&quot;. 

Also in 1985, Afrodiziak performed backing vocals on the first two songs on Howard Jones&#x27; second album, &quot;Dream into Action&quot;, both of which (&quot;Things Can Only Get Better&quot; and &quot;Life in One Day&quot;) became worldwide hit singles; later that year, they went on tour as part of Jones&#x27;s band. Other acts the group sang backup for include Ian Gillan, Aztec Camera, Maxi Priest, Aswad, Sam Brown, and Julia Fordham. Besides &quot;The Tube&quot;, Afrodiziak also appeared on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;, &quot;Solid Gold&quot;, and &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. They performed live at the Montreux Jazz Festival, Live Aid Japan, Red Nose Day of Charity, and the first Free Nelson Mandela Concert.

Caron Wheeler went on to fame as a featured vocalist in the dance-R&amp;B collective Soul II Soul (she was the lead vocalist on the group&#x27;s two biggest hits, &quot;Keep on Movin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Back to Life&quot;, the video for the latter track also featuring Fontaine as a backing vocalist) and had a brief career as a solo artist. 

Claudia Fontaine continued working as a backing vocalist on albums by EMF, Neneh Cherry and Hothouse Flowers, among others, and appeared as a main vocalist with the British house music group the Beatmasters. She was featured among the Beatmasters&#x27; high-profile, often-changing vocalists, in particular on the 1989–90 dance club and pop chart success &quot;Warm Love&quot; (from the album &quot;Anywayawanna&quot;), and on &quot;Deeper into Harmony&quot; (from the 1991 album &quot;Life and Soul&quot;). Fontaine died on 13 March 2018.

<text>Jair-Rôhm Parker Wells (born October 13, 1958) is an American free improvising electric bassist. He is one of the founding members of the improvising band Machine Gun with Thomas Chapin and Robert Musso and the founder of the Meeting Interdisciplinary Arts Festival in Stockholm, Sweden. He lived in Stockholm, Sweden, from 1985 until 2017.

He has been a promoter of improvised and experimental music and has collaborated with Bob Belden, Karl Berger, Daniel Carter, Jaron Lanier, John Sinclair, Shabaka Hutchings, and Tony Scott. In 2017, he was in residence at EMS in Stockholm where he began work on his opera &quot;#blacbuc&quot;. The work was composed on the Buchla 100 and 200e systems at the institute. Compositions from his &quot;Liberation&quot; cycle are featured as part of res·o·nant, the light and sound installation by artist Mischa Kuball at the Jewish Museum Berlin.

Raised in southern Germany, Jair-Rohm moved to New York in 1978. After touring the United States for a year with a pop music band, he attended Tulane University in New Orleans. At Tulane he performed with local jazz and rhythm and blues musicians. He also performed as a member of Tulane University&#x27;s Tulanians, met and studied with Richard Payne, and discovered the music of Harry Partch. In 1980 he returned to New York and started work-study with saxophonist Ken Simon. He met Anthony Braxton and studied his music. In 1982 he founded his experimental music theater group Glass Thought Theater Ensemble. Between 1982 and 1983 he was composer in residence at the New York Theater Ensemble, writing and producing a trilogy of progressive &quot;operas&quot;. He received a Meet the Composer grant in 1983. During the next year, he lived in New Jersey and was a founding member of the New Brunswick Jazz Musician&#x27;s Collective, for which he composed several works for ensembles. He has performed at Vahdat Hall (Tehran, Iran), Xinghai Conservatory of Music (Guangzhou, China), Tribeca Performing Arts Center (New York), Globen Arena (Stockholm), Saxophone Jazz Pub (Bangkok, Thailand), Cafe Oto (London, England) and the Domicil Jazz Club (Munich, Germany).

<text>Free-to-air (FTA) services are television (TV) and radio services broadcast in unencrypted form, allowing any person with the appropriate receiving equipment to receive the signal and view or listen to the content without requiring a subscription, other ongoing cost, or one-off fee (e.g., pay-per-view). In the traditional sense, this is carried on terrestrial radio signals and received with an antenna.

FTA also refers to channels and broadcasters providing content for which no subscription is expected, even though they may be delivered to the viewer/listener by another carrier for which a subscription is required, e.g., cable television, the Internet, or satellite. These carriers may be mandated (or OPT) in some geographies to deliver FTA channels even if a premium subscription is not present (providing the necessary equipment is still available), especially where FTA channels are expected to be used for emergency broadcasts, similar to the 1-1-2 (112) emergency service provided by mobile phone operators and manufacturers.

On the other side, free-to-view (FTV) is generally available without subscription, but it is digitally encoded and may be restricted geographically.

Free-to-air is often used for international broadcasting, making it something of a video equivalent to shortwave radio.
Most FTA retailers list free-to-air channel guides and content available in North America for free-to-air use.

== Funding ==
Although commonly described as free, the cost of free-to-air services is met through various means:
* Tax funding
* Enforced levy of a licence fee for transmission and production costs (e.g., the BBC)
* Voluntary donation for local transmission and production costs (e.g., PBS)
* Commercial advertising for transmission and production costs and surplus revenues returned to the government (e.g., CBC Television/Télévision de Radio-Canada in Canada, SBS in Australia and TVNZ in New Zealand)
* Commercial sponsorship
* Consumer products and services where part of the cost goes toward television advertising and sponsorship (in the case of Japanese television broadcasters like TV Asahi and TV Tokyo which rely heavily on sponsorship, similar to Philippine broadcasters like ABS-CBN, TV5 and GMA)

==Middle East==
===Israel===
Up until 2012, Israel had several free-to-air channels. The major ones rating-wise were Channel 2, Channel 10, and Channel 1. The other ones were Educational, Channel 33, and Knesset 99.

Since 2018, Israel has several new free-to-air channels that replace their older counterparts. The major ones rating-wise: are Channel 12, Channel 13, Kan 11, and Channel 20. The others are Kan Educational, Makan 33, and Knesset Channel.

==Africa==
===South Africa===
In 1971, the SABC was finally allowed to introduce a television service. Initially, the proposal was for two television channels, one in English and Afrikaans, aimed at white audiences, and another, known as TV Bantu, aimed at black viewers. However, when television was finally introduced, there was only one channel with airtime divided evenly between English and Afrikaans, alternating between the two languages. Test transmissions in Johannesburg began on 5 May 1975, followed in July by ones in Cape Town and Durban. Nationwide services finally commenced on 5 January 1976.

In common with most of Western Europe, South Africa used the PAL system for colour television, being only the second terrestrial television service in sub-Saharan Africa to launch with a colour-only service, Zanzibar in Tanzania having introduced the first such service in 1973. (Tanzania itself did not establish a television service until the early 1990s, similarly concerned about the expense and perceived threat to cultural norms.) The Government, advised by SABC technicians, took the view that colour television would have to be available so as to avoid a costly migration from black-and-white broadcasting technology.

Initially, the TV service was funded entirely through a licence fee as in the UK, charged at R36. However, advertising began on 1 January 1978.

On 1 January 1982, two services were introduced, TV2 broadcasting in Zulu and Xhosa and TV3 broadcasting in Sotho and Tswana, aimed at a black urban audience. In 1985, a new service called TV4 was introduced, carrying sports and entertainment programming, using the channel shared by TV2 and TV3, which ended transmissions at 9:30 pm. In 1992, TV2, TV3 and TV4 were combined into a new service called CCV (Contemporary Community Values). A third channel was introduced known as TSS, or Topsport Surplus, Topsport being the brand name for the SABC&#x27;s sport coverage, but this was replaced by NNTV (National Network TV), an educational, non-commercial channel, in 1994.

The main channel, now called TV1, was divided evenly between English and Afrikaans, as before. It also became available in Walvis Bay, an enclave of South Africa in Namibia, which was itself then under South African administration, with a live feed of the channel broadcast via Intelsat being retransmitted on a local low-power repeater.

In 1986, the SABC&#x27;s monopoly was challenged by the launch of a subscription-based service known as M-Net, backed by a consortium of newspaper publishers on 1 October. However, as part of its licensing restrictions, it could not broadcast news programmes, which were still the preserve of the SABC, although M-Net started broadcasting a current affairs programme called Carte Blanche in 1988. As the state-controlled broadcaster, the SABC was accused of bias towards the apartheid regime, giving only limited coverage to opposition politicians.

==Asia==
===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, the largest and most dominant television channel, Television Broadcasts Limited, was the first free-to-air commercial television channel when it commenced broadcasting on 19 November 1967. It may also well be among the oldest and first stations to broadcast over-the-air in East and Southeast Asia.

ViuTV and RTHK TV started broadcasting in 2016.

===India and South Asia===

Around 600 FTA television channels and 180 radio channels are broadcast from ku-band and c-band transponders on the INSAT-4B and GSAT-15 satellite covering India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and parts of Afghanistan, and Myanmar. In India, the channels are marketed as DD Direct Plus/DD Free Dish by Doordarshan, India&#x27;s national broadcaster and other Indian private broadcaster ABS Free Dish from the ABS2 satellite. One can receive free-to-air regional TV channels using a small DTH antenna and a free-to-air set-top box.

===South Korea===
In Korea, KBS, MBC (the two main public broadcasters), SBS (privately owned, but available for free to viewers), and EBS (including both TV and radio) are the free-to-air broadcasting stations. They dominate more than 80% of advertisement profits, according to the recent survey from the agency.

Due to the recent government&#x27;s decision, digital television service for all free-to-air networks would be scheduled before 2012, followed by the end of analog television broadcasting.

== Europe ==
=== Satellite ===

European countries have a tradition of most television services being free-to-air. Germany, in particular, receives in excess of 100 digital satellite TV channels free-to-air. Approximately half of the television channels on SES Astra&#x27;s 19.2° east and 28.2° east satellite positions, and Eutelsat&#x27;s Hot Bird (13° east) are free-to-air.

A number of European channels which one might expect to be broadcast free-to-air - including many countries&#x27; national terrestrial broadcasters - do not do so via satellite for copyright reasons. (Rights to purchase programs for free-to-air broadcast, especially via satellite, are often higher in price than for encrypted broadcast.) The lack of FTA among public broadcasters are prevalent in countries whose broadcasters tend to use subtitles for foreign language programmes; although Spain&#x27;s two public domestic channels, La Una and La Dos, are also encrypted despite dubbed foreign programmes being the norm in Spain. However, these channels usually provide a scheme to offer free, but encrypted, viewing with free-to-view broadcasts. Certain programming on Italy&#x27;s RAI, and the majority of Dutch channels are covered by such schemes (although in the case of RAI some programming is transmitted without encryption where there are no copyright issues). In Austria, the main national networks broadcast free-to-view via satellite; however, all regional and some smaller channels are transmitted free-to-air, and the national public broadcaster, ORF, offers a special free-to-air channel which airs selected programming without (i.e. those without copyright issues) via satellite all over Europe.

As Germany and Austria speak the same language and use the same satellite, Austrian viewers are able to receive about 120 free German-speaking channels from both countries.

In general, all satellite radio in Europe is free-to-air, but the more conventional broadcast systems in use mean that SiriusXM style in-car reception is not possible.

Cable and satellite distribution allow many more channels to carry sports, movies and specialist channels which are not broadcast as FTA. The viewing figures for these channels are generally much lower than the FTA channels.

=== Terrestrial ===
Various European countries broadcast a large number of channels via free-to-air terrestrial, generally as an analog PAL/SECAM transmission, digital DVB-T/T2 or a combination of the two.

==== Croatia ====

In Croatia eleven national channels are free-to-air: HRT 1, HRT 2, HRT 3, HRT 4 (HRT being national broadcaster), Nova TV, Doma TV, RTL, RTL2, RTL Kockica, CMC and SPTV. There are around 21 local or regional channels. Before June 2020, they used to be transmitted via three OiV (state-owned public broadcasting company) DVB-T and one DVB-T2 (HEVC/H.265) MUXes. As of June 2020, the DVB-T MUXes were switched off and all eleven national channels are now distributed via two OiV DVB-T2 (HEVC/H.265) MUXes.

==== Denmark ====

In Denmark, six channels are as of 2020 free-to-air, distributed via 18 main transmitter sites and 30 smaller, auxiliary transmitters. The six channels (DR1, DR2, DR Ramasjang, Folketinget, TV2 Regionerne, and sign language/local programme) come in one DVB-T2 multiplex.

==== France ====

In France, there are 26 national television channels (MPEG-4 HD video) and 41 local television channels broadcast free-to-air via the TNT DVB-T2 service.

==== Germany ====

In Germany there are various free-to-air DVB-T services available, the number of which varies by region. Das Erste, ZDF, ZDFneo, ZDFinfo, 3sat, Arte, KiKA and Phoenix are available throughout the country, in addition to at least one region-dependent channel which is provided by the regional ARD member. Additionally, ARD&#x27;s EinsFestival, EinsPlus and tagesschau24 are variously available in some parts of the country, and various commercial channels are available in metropolitan areas.

==== Ireland ====

In the Republic of Ireland, there are nine television channels and 11 radio channels broadcast free-to-air via the DVB-T Saorview service. Analog PAL versions of some of the channels were also broadcast until October 24, 2012, when all analogue television broadcasting was shut down.

==== Malta ====

All of Malta&#x27;s national and political party channels are available free-to-air. The national channels TVM and TVM2, Parliament TV and the political party channels NET and ONE, all are broadcast via the free-to-air DVB-T service.

Even HD versions of these channels are available free-to-air. The only scrambled channel in Malta is ITV Teleshopping.

==== Netherlands ====

In the Netherlands, three national public television channels (NPO 1, NPO 2 and NPO 3) and seven national public radio channels broadcast free-to-air via the DVB-T Digitenne service. The television and radio channels of the regional public broadcasters are also free-to-air via the DVB-T service.

==== Spain ====

In Spain, there are around 25 national and 40 regional channels, as well as many local channels and radio stations. All television channels are in HD, with at least one UHD channel (La 1). The state broadcaster, Televisión Española, is publicly-funded and does not show commercials. The two major competing networks, Atresmedia and Mediaset, are privately-owned and show commercials. All broadcasts are free-to-air, and there is no concept of paying for a TV license. The acronym used for DVB-T in Spain is TDT ().

==== United Kingdom ====

In the UK, the five main free-to-air television networks are BBC One, BBC Two, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5. Around 108 free-to-air television channels and 30 free-to-air radio channels are available terrestrially via the Freeview DVB-T service. Seven HD channels are also broadcast via a public service broadcast multiplex and a commercial multiplex, both DVB-T2.

The informal term &quot;council telly&quot; is sometimes used for free-to-air television in the UK, evoking a basic service accessible to all.

== North America ==

There are a number of competing systems in use. Early adopters used C-band dishes several feet in diameter to receive analog microwave broadcasts, and later digital microwave broadcasts using the 3.7-4.2 GHz band. Today, although large C-band dishes can still receive some content, the 11.7-12.2 GHz is also used. Ku-band signals can be received using smaller dishes, often as small as under a meter (3 feet, 3 inches) in diameter, allowing FTA satellite to be picked up from smaller spaces such as apartment balconies (note, however, that these dishes are not quite as small as those commonly used for commercial services such as Dish Network, DirecTV, Bell ExpressVu, Shaw Direct, etc. Dishes intended for those services may not deliver an adequate signal on Ku-band). The European-developed DVB-S and DVB-S2 standards are the most commonly used broadcast methods, with analog transmissions almost completely discontinued as of mid-2014.

The most common North American sources for free-to-air DVB satellite television are:
* NHK World HD on Intelsat 9 (58°W)
* Retro TV, Heartland on AMC 9 (83°W)
* LPB Louisiana PBS channels LPBHD, LPB2, and LPB3 (Create) on SES 2 (89°W)
* NASA TV Multi-channel (NASA TV Public-Education, NASA Media, NASA TV UHD) on Horizons-1 (aka Galaxy 13) (127°W)
* Eternal Word Television Network on Galaxy 17 (91°W)
* My Family TV, CGTN on Galaxy 3C (95°W).
* AMGTV and BYU Television (BYUtv) on Galaxy 19 (97°W)
* English and foreign language broadcasters RT (TV network), Ebru TV, IRINN, Al Jazeera English and more up-linked by GlobeCast World TV on Galaxy 19 (97°W)
* Christian broadcasters such as The Word Network, Emmanuel TV, Daystar Television Network, JCTV, Trinity Broadcasting Network, The Church Channel, 3ABN, The Hope Channel, Amazing Facts Television, and God&#x27;s Learning Channel are broadcast from the Galaxy 19 (97°W) satellite for Glorystar and Spiritcast Satellite Systems TV.
* Peace TV English and Peace TV Urdu language which are global Islamic channels, available on Galaxy 19 (97°W)
* DoD News on AMC 1 (103°W)
* Jewish Life Television on Galaxy 18 (123°W)
* Montana Public Broadcasting Service and other PBS Satellite Services on AMC 21 (125°W)
* Classic Arts Showcase on Galaxy 17 (91°W) and Eternal Word Television Network HD on Galaxy 15 (133°W)
* Football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey wildfeeds on various satellites
* &quot;InfoWars&quot; and &quot;The Alex Jones Show&quot; broadcast from Austin, Texas, and creates free-to-air 24/7 content on Galaxy 16 99°W.

Most of these signals are carried by US satellites. There is little or no free Canadian DVB-S content available to users of medium-size dishes, as much of the available Ku-band satellite bandwidth is occupied by pay-TV operators Shaw Direct and Bell Satellite TV, although larger C-band dishes can pick up some content. FTA signals may be scattered across multiple satellites, requiring a motor or multiple LNBs to receive everything. This differs from Europe, where FTA signals are commonly concentrated on a few specific satellites.

Another difference between North American FTA and FTA in most of the rest of the world is that in North America, very few of the available signals are actually intended for home viewers or other end-users. Instead, they are generally intended for reception by local television stations, cable system headends, or other commercial users. While it is generally thought to be legal for home viewers to view such transmissions as long as they are not encrypted, this means that there are several unique challenges to viewing FTA signals, challenges not present in other areas of the world. Among these are:

* No schedule information is provided with most of the signals; therefore, satellite receivers cannot show a proper electronic program guide (EPG).
* Because many of these broadcasts are essentially point-to-point transmissions, the originators often do not follow any international standards when setting various identification fields in the data stream. This causes issues with receivers and software designed for use in other parts of the world, as they may assume that if a channel contains the same ID information as another channel, those are duplicate channels. This may be a valid assumption in other parts of the world, but is almost never valid for North American FTA signals. When such an assumption is made, during a &quot;blind scan&quot; the receiver or software will often fail to correctly insert one or more channels into its database, or it may overwrite previously scanned valid channels (including other channels on the same satellite) with invalid information picked up from another, more recently scanned channel. If the end user does not understand what is happening, they may assume that the receiver cannot receive certain channels or that it is defective, yet if the correct data for those channels can be manually entered, those channels may become receivable. This problem can be mitigated if receivers can be set to ignore channels that appear to be duplicates during a &quot;blind scan&quot;, except when such channels are on exactly the same satellite and same transponder frequency (as might occur if the user rescans a previously scanned satellite).
* Channels tend to come and go, or change transmission formats, often without any prior notice other than to their intended recipients. This means that a working channel could suddenly disappear without warning, and may need to be rescanned to become receivable again, or it may be gone permanently.
* Channels that are currently FTA can become scrambled (encrypted) with no advance warning. A few channels tend to go back and forth between being &quot;in the clear&quot; (unscrambled) to scrambled at various times, but in most cases, once a channel is scrambled it stays scrambled.
* Historically, it has appeared that broadcasters are more likely to scramble their signals when they become aware that home viewers and other &quot;unauthorized&quot; viewers are watching their signals. Therefore, those who know what signals are available may sometimes be reluctant to share that information in open forums. While sites exist that attempt to list currently viewable FTA signals, most of them are incomplete or do not contain current information. Such sites typically rely on reports of changes by viewers, and if viewers are reluctant to report new FTA signals for fear they might disappear, it becomes more of a challenge for such sites to maintain up-to-date listings.
* What some would consider the most desirable signals, e.g. feeds from broadcast networks, are primarily only available on C-band, which requires a large dish (usually at least in diameter or more, although a few hobbyists have found it possible to receive some C-band signals using smaller dishes and high quality LNBs). Also some of those signals utilize high-bitrate formats that cannot be received by many older receivers, even if those receivers are capable of receiving digital signals, and such signals may require a larger than usual dish for adequate reception. In many areas, local zoning laws and/or homeowner associations forbid the placement of a large dish, therefore such dishes have fallen out of favor since commercial satellite services became widely available. Therefore, very few people have the capability to receive the C-band broadcasts. Another issue is that properly aiming a C-band dish is not something that a typical end-user would know how to do, since it tends to be a somewhat complex procedure (especially when a moveable dish is used with the intention of tracking the visible satellite arc in order to receive multiple satellites), and many of the installers that knew how to set up and correctly aim a C-band dish have exited the business.
* While equipment and software is becoming available that allows home users to set up a backend system that can deliver received over-the-air ATSC signals to several frontend systems (for example, a HDHomeRun, VBox Home TV Gateway or similar TV tuner, used with MythTV or TVHeadEnd), a similar system for receiving FTA signals is considerably more difficult to set up. While PCI/PCIe tuner cards and USB tuners for DVB-S and DVB-S2 are available, there are often issues with drivers, or the cards may simply not be compatible with the backend software in use. Therefore, setting up such a system for FTA satellite reception tends to require considerably more technical knowledge, and a willingness to work through issues, than setting up such a system for receiving terrestrial signals.
* Some syndicated programming is being sent as data, similar to the way a video file might be sent over the Internet. This means that the programming is not sent in a format that can be viewed in real time, as it is being received. Instead, the data must be captured to a storage device and decoded for later use. Traditional satellite receivers and even many PC tuner cards are not capable of receiving these signals, and even if you have a card capable of receiving such signals, you also need special software to find such data streams and when one is found, to extract the data stream and save it.

The largest groups of end-users for Ku-band free-to-air signals were initially the ethnic-language communities, as often free ethnic-language programming would be sponsored by Multilingual American Communities and their broadcasters. Depending on language and origin of the individual signals, North American ethnic-language TV is a mix of pay-TV, free-to-air and DBS operations. Today, many American broadcasters send a multitude of programming channels in many languages, spanning many new channels, so they can get National support, which ultimately leads to carriage by cable systems, to additionally support the high costs of broadcasting signals in this way.

Nevertheless, free-to-air satellite TV is a viable addition to home video systems, not only for the reception of specialized content but also for use in locations where terrestrial ATSC over-the-air reception is incomplete and additional channels are desired.

==Oceania==
===Australia===

Australia has five major free-to-air networks: the two public broadcasting networks - ABC and SBS, and three commercial networks - Seven Network, Nine Network, and Network 10. Traditionally each network had only a single channel in a geographic area, but with the advent of digital television each network started broadcasting several SD multichannels, such as 7two, 9Gem, 10 Bold, and SBS Food, as well as at least one HD channel. There are also free-to-air community television channels in some major cities.

Viewers in remote parts of Australia are able to access many Australian free-to-air channels using the DVB-S2 Optus VAST service.

===New Zealand===

New Zealand has a number of FTA broadcasters such as Television New Zealand&#x27;s TVNZ 1 and TVNZ 2, as well as Discovery New Zealand&#x27;s Three and Bravo, Sky Network Television&#x27;s Sky Open and the government subsidised the Whakaata Māori and Te Reo channels.

Four channels, TVNZ 1, TVNZ 2, Three, Bravo are also broadcast timeshifted by +1 hour on Freeview and Sky platforms.

A broadcast of parliament and a number of local channels were available but since have closed, such as Cue TV were also available. Local stations such as CTV and Face TV (previously Triangle TV) were free-to-air analogue PAL transmissions prior to CTV migrating to the free-to-air digital DVB-T service and Face TV&#x27;s terrestrial free-to-air service shutoff from December 2013.

A digital terrestrial version of Freeview was launched in 2008, which, unlike the analogue and free-to-air satellite options, supports high-definition broadcasts for TVNZ 1, TVNZ 2, Three and Bravo. While, airing the timeshifted channels also. 

== South America ==

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil the main FTA satellite is the Star One D2, it holds approximately C-band analog channels (1985-2024), including all major networks like TV Globo (feed nacional digital HDTV), SBT (feed nacional digital HDTV), Record (feed nacional digital HDTV), Record News (feed nacional digital HDTV), RFTV (feed nacional digital HDTV), RedeTV!, Band (feed nacional digital HDTV), Cultura, Futura (feed nacional digital HDTV), TV Verdes Mares (feed nacional digital HDTV), Canal Gov, Canal Libras and others, 36 C-band and KU-band digital HDTV channels.

=== Chile ===
In Chile the main FTA satellite is the Hispasat 74W-1, it holds approximately 10 KU-band digital HDTV channels including all major networks like La Red, Telecanal, TVN Regional, TVN2 Regional, Canal 24HRS, CHV, CHV2, CDTV, TV Senado, La Red Feed, Telecanal Feed and TVN Feed.

<doc id="776558" wikidata="Q1025990" url="?curid=776558" title="Merritt, British Columbia">
<text>Merritt is a city in the Nicola Valley of the south-central Interior of British Columbia, Canada. It is northeast of Vancouver. Situated at the confluence of the Nicola and Coldwater rivers, it is the first major community encountered after travelling along Phase One of the Coquihalla Highway and acts as the gateway to all other major highways to the B.C. Interior. The city developed in 1893 when part of the ranches owned by William Voght, Jesus Garcia, and John Charters were surveyed for a town site.

Once known as Forksdale, the community adopted its current name in 1906 in honour of mining engineer and railway promoter William Hamilton Merritt III. The city limits consist of the community, a number of civic parks, historical sites, an aquatic centre, a local arena, a public library (which is a branch of the Thompson-Nicola Regional District Library System) and a civic centre. Merritt has dozens of bronzed hand prints of country music stars who have been in the city for the annual Merritt Mountain Music Festival displayed throughout town. Merritt is also home to a local radio station, a weekly newspaper and the Nicola Valley Institute of Technology campus. Nearby, there are four provincial parks, numerous lakes, and several recreational trails. Merritt is known as the &quot;Country Music Capital of Canada&quot; for its wealth of country music attractions, activities, and events.

Highway 5, and Highway 97C intersect at Merritt with Highway 97C East connecting the city to Kelowna and Penticton, Highway 97C Northwest to Logan Lake, Highway 8 to Spences Bridge and Lillooet, Highway 5A South to Princeton, Highway 5A North to Kamloops, Highway 5 South to Hope, and Highway 5 North to Kamloops. Merritt&#x27;s economy is dominated by the primary industries of forestry, tourism, and service.

== History ==

For years, the Merritt area was a gathering place for local European colonists and First Nations, as the area was a focus of transportation routes used by early pioneers. The grasslands eventually drew the attention of settlers interested in ranching, and the first ranches were staked in the mid-19th century.

In the 1880s three ranches located at the confluence of the Nicola and Coldwater Rivers, owned by William Voght, Jesus Garcia, and the John Charters Estate, became the focus of a farming community known as &quot;The Forks&quot;. With the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway through British Columbia in 1885, interest increased in the coal deposits south of The Forks.

Parts of the ranches owned by Voght, Garcia and Charters were surveyed in 1893 for the townsite of Forksdale, but the name did not catch on with locals. Instead, the name was changed in 1906 to honour William Hamilton Merritt III, a mining engineer and railway promoter. By 1907, the coal mines were in operation and with the completion of the Nicola, Kamloops and Similkameen railway from Spences Bridge, government and other offices starting moving from Lower and Upper Nicola to establish Merritt as the major settlement in the Nicola Valley.

Armstrong&#x27;s Store moved from Lower Nicola to Nicola Avenue in Merritt in the spring of 1907. G.B. Armstrong became Merritt&#x27;s first postmaster at this location in 1908. In 1910, Armstrong&#x27;s Department Store moved to 2025 Quilchena Avenue. In 1909, the Bank of Montreal moved from the settlement of Nicola to Merritt. A.E. Howse moved his department store to the west end of Nicola Avenue. The &quot;Nicola Herald&quot;, founded at Nicola Lake in 1905, moved from Nicola to Merritt in 1909 and the name was changed to the &quot;Merritt Herald and Nicola Valley Advocate&quot;. Other industries developed in the Valley, including ranching, copper, nickel, gold and silver mining, and forestry, and as a result, new business buildings were constructed.

The move toward incorporation began in 1910 and culminated on April 1, 1911, when Merritt was granted its city charter. The first Merritt City Hall was built in 1912. The top floor was police headquarters, the second for administration offices, and the bottom for the jail. The building included the fire hall and tower that housed a whistle to summon the volunteer fire fighters.

Merritt dedicated the names of its streets and avenues to early settlers. Among the names honoured were Charters, Chapman, Cleasby, Garcia, Voght, Coutlee, Nicola, Granite, and Quilchena.

As the town grew, it featured a drug store, a general store, a brewery and a jewellery store. The first electrical power service by the city was provided in February 1913.

Merritt and the Nicola Valley experienced prosperity until the passage of restrictive trade legislation in the United States in 1930. Because the city had financially backed one of the major sawmills, the loss of lumber markets caused the city to go into receivership from 1933 to 1952.

The next wave of immigrants, primarily Sikh, from the Punjab region of India, arrived in Merritt in the 1950s, followed by a large influx in the late 1960s and early 1970s to work in the booming forestry sector of the time and adding to the cultural mosaic of Merritt. Known as Indo-Canadians, they continue to play a crucial part in the economy—Aspen Planers Ltd., a major employer in the city, and many other businesses, restaurants and hotels in Merritt are owned by members of this group.

In advance polls during the 2015 Canadian elections, an unexpectedly high turnout in Merritt resulted in there being an insufficient quantity of ballots.

On November 15, 2021, the entire city was ordered to evacuate after heavy rainfall and flooding caused the municipality&#x27;s wastewater treatment plant to fail. Residents were asked to shelter with family or friends outside of the community, or in emergency evacuation shelters in Kamloops and Kelowna.

== Cityscape ==
Merritt is composed of four distinct residential areas: Bench, Collettville, Central and Diamondvale. The Bench is a residential mountain bench, hence the name, sited on the northwest side of the valley. Collettville, on the southwest edge of the community south of the Coldwater River, was the newest addition to Merritt. Central is situated at the south of the city centre. Diamond Vale is in the heart of the valley, and is the most populated. Each area is served by an elementary school: Bench Elementary, Collettville Elementary and French Immersion, Central Elementary, Diamond Vale Elementary. Also, a high school, Merritt Secondary School, that services the area. The main office for School District 58 Nicola-Similkameen, which operates the schools in the area, is also located in Merritt. The town is also served by the Nicola Valley Museum and Archives.

<text>Babimost () is a town in Zielona Góra County, Lubusz Voivodeship, western Poland. It is the administrative seat of Gmina Babimost. Babimost has an area of , and as of June 2022 it has a population of 3,848.

==Geography==
The town is situated on the Leniwa Obra creek, about northeast of Sulechów and about west of Poznań. Though located in Lubusz Voivodeship, Babimost is part of the Greater Poland historical region.

==History==

The territory became a part of the emerging Polish state under its first historic ruler Mieszko I in the 10th century. The settlement probably arose about 1000 AD around a castellany located at a crossing through the swampy Leniwa Obra river.
The estates were held by the Pomeranian Swienca family until 1307; together with nearby Sulechów, they were acquired by Margrave Waldemar of Brandenburg in 1319, who nevertheless died in the same year. By 1329, they were held by the Silesian duke Henry IV the Faithful, then a Bohemian vassal. Finally incorporated into the Polish Poznań Voivodeship in 1332 (which was later also part of the larger Greater Poland Province), Babimost received town privileges according to Magdeburg Law by King Władysław II Jagiełło in 1397. It was a royal town of Poland. King Sigismund the Old confirmed the city rights in 1530.

After the Protestant Reformation, the population increased due to the influx of German-speaking refugees from Silesia. Oppressed by the Catholic Habsburg rule, they were granted religious freedom by Polish king John II Casimir Vasa. In the mid-17th century, the starost of Babimost was Krzysztof Żegocki, who during the Swedish invasion of Poland was the first to organize a guerrilla unit to fight the invading forces and became famous in the battles of Kościan and Jasna Góra, thus earning the title of the &quot;First Partisan of the Commonwealth&quot;. During the war, which was part of the Second Northern War, Babimost was devastated by Swedish troops in 1656. The reconstruction of a synagogue is documented around 1700, a Protestant church was erected in 1782. The inhabitants were mainly shoe manufacturers, linen producers and hop (beer) and wine producers.

Upon the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, the town fell to Prussia. After the successful Greater Poland uprising of 1806, it was regained by the Poles and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw. At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, it again passed to Prussia, and was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Posen. Prussians conducted a policy of Germanisation towards the local population. German was introduced in Polish schools, German colonists were settled to change the ethnic composition. Between 1818 and 1938 it was part of the &quot;Bomst&quot; district within the Prussian &quot;Regierungsbezirk Posen&quot;, though the administrative seat was at Wollstein (Wolsztyn). When the town became part of the German Empire in 1871, it had 2,272 inhabitants, of whom 1,042 were Catholics (mostly Poles), 1,070 were Protestants (mostly Germans) and 160 Jewish. Despite attempts at Germanisation, Poles founded new organizations in the town, including an agricultural association (&quot;Kółko Rolnicze&quot;), People&#x27;s Bank (&quot;Bank Ludowy&quot;) and the Catholic Association of Polish Youth (&quot;Katolicki Związek Młodzieży Polskiej&quot;).

After Poland regained independence in 1918, Poles from the town and the surrounding area actively joined the Greater Poland Uprising to rejoin the area with Poland. On January 24, 1919, the insurgents captured Babimost, but under the Treaty of Versailles the town remained within Germany. In the interwar period, the town lay on the border with the Second Polish Republic; remaining with the German province of Posen-West Prussia and from 1938 to 1945 as part of the Province of Brandenburg. The majority of the town&#x27;s population was German-speaking, while up to a third of its residents were Poles. Attempts at Germanisation intensified, in response Poles set up private schools, gathered in theater groups and choirs, Polish press was spreading, and Polish organizations were active. In 1939, 1,950 inhabitants were registered as citizens of the town, of whom 600 were ethnic Polish. During the German invasion of Poland, in September 1939, the Germans arrested several regional Polish activists (including local Polish leader Jan Cichy), who were then deported to Nazi concentration camps, and later also expelled several Polish families from the county.

After the Vistula–Oder Offensive of the Red Army in the late days of World War II, large parts of the town lay in ruins. In 1945, Babimost was reintegrated with Poland and its German inhabitants were to be expelled by the new administration in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. However, with Polish and German ethnicities coexisting over centuries, no clear division between Poles and Germans could be made, so that the majority of those who were to be expelled, could stay by renouncing any German language and culture.

==Transport==

Voivodeship roads 303, 304 and 313 pass through the town. There is a railway station in Babimost and the Zielona Góra Airport is located nearby.

<doc id="776591" wikidata="Q1992226" url="?curid=776591" title="Cumulus humilis cloud">
<text>Cumulus humilis are cumuliform clouds with little vertical extent, common in the summer, that are often referred to as &quot;fair weather cumulus&quot;. If they develop into cumulus mediocris or cumulus congestus, thunderstorms could form later in the day.

They generally form at lower altitudes (500–3000 m (1,500–10,000 ft)), but in hot countries or over mountainous terrain these clouds can occur at an altitude of up to . They show no significant vertical development, indicating that the temperature in the atmosphere above them either drops off very slowly or not at all with altitude; that is, the environmental lapse rate is small or negative. Cumulus humilis clouds often have little variance in their depths due to their constrained vertical development. Cumulus humilis may be accompanied by other cloud types.

Air below the cloud base can be quite turbulent due to the thermals that formed the clouds, giving occupants of light aircraft an uncomfortable ride. To avoid turbulence where such clouds are present, pilots may climb above the cloud tops. However, glider pilots actively seek out the rising air to gain altitude.

These clouds may later metamorphose into cumulus mediocris and eventually cumulus congestus clouds when convection is intense enough, though the presence of these types of clouds usually indicates fair weather.

== Forecasting ==

Morning cumulus humilis clouds are signs of an unstable atmosphere. Larger clouds or possibly thunderstorms could form throughout the day to cause bad or severe weather in the afternoon or evening. Cumulus humilis clouds are not rain clouds but could precede a storm.

Cumulus humilis are sometimes seen beneath cirrostratus clouds, which block some of the heat from the sun and thus create an inversion, causing any cumuliform clouds to flatten and become cumulus humilis. In this case, a warm front could be approaching and rain is possible for the next 12 to 24 hours.

When cumulus humilis appear in a clear sky, they are an indicator of pleasant weather for the next several hours.

==Formation==
Cumulus humilis clouds are formed by rising warm air or thermals with ascending air currents of 2–5 m/s (7–17 ft/s). These clouds are usually very small convective clouds and usually form after a thermal reaches the condensation level. They can develop into cumulus mediocris clouds but most often dissipate a few minutes after formation.

<text>Nissim Ezekiel (16 December 1924 – 9 January 2004) was an Indian poet, actor, playwright, editor, and art critic. He was a foundational figure in postcolonial India&#x27;s literary history, specifically for Indian poetry in English.

He was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1983 for his collection, &quot;Latter-Day Psalms&quot;, by the Sahitya Akademi, India&#x27;s National Academy of Letters. Ezekiel has been applauded for his subtle, restrained and well crafted diction, dealing with common and mundane (everyday) themes in a manner that manifests both cognitive profundity, as well as an unsentimental, realistic sensibility, that has been influential on the course of succeeding Indian English poetry.
Ezekiel enriched and established Indian English language poetry through his modernist innovations and techniques, which enlarged Indian English literature, moving it beyond purely spiritual and orientalist themes, to include a wider range of concerns and interests, including familial events, individual angst and skeptical societal introspection.

==Early life==
Ezekiel was born on 16 December 1924 in Bombay (Mumbai) in Maharashtra. His father was a professor of botany at Wilson College, and his mother was the principal of her own school. The Ezekiels belonged to Mumbai&#x27;s Marathi-speaking Jewish community known as the Bene Israel.

In 1947, Ezekiel earned a BA in Literature from Wilson College, Mumbai, Bombay University. In 1947–48, he taught English literature and published literary articles. After dabbling in politics for a while, he sailed to England in November 1948. He studied philosophy at Birkbeck College, London. After three and a half years, Ezekiel worked his way home as a deck-scrubber aboard a ship carrying arms to Indochina.

==Career==

Ezekiel&#x27;s first book, &quot;A Time to change&quot;, appeared in 1952. A Time To Change, changed the trajectory of Indian poetry as it was a new form of poetry, Indian English Poetry. The book serves as a declaration of transformation, encompassing the poet&#x27;s personal life and surroundings. It brings about a significant shift with deep implications for society, intellectual thought, and moral values. Most importantly, it introduces a transformation in the way poetry is written. Written in 1952, it emphasizes the cultural context of the post colonial period. Ezekiel uses his poetry as a way to make remarks on the period emphasizing his approach to modernity and encompassing his personal life. A Time to Change may be a small volume with just around thirty-five pages, but it holds great significance in terms of its quality and historical importance. The title of the book indicates change embracing all aspects of Ezekiel&#x27;s writing or poetry and his aesthetics. A Time To Change marks the onset of a unique form of poetry and the start of a noteworthy career. The opening lines of the poem are &quot;We who leave the house in April, Lord,/How shall we return?/Debtors to the whore of Love&quot; suggesting that Ezekiel is expressing deep regret for leaving home during a season associated with renewal. In addition, A Time To Change represents Ezekiel&#x27;s talent for presenting an incident in dew stanzas and his ability to use gentle irony with sadistic humor. This departure is symbolic, representing a shift away from a life of natural happiness and spontaneity. A Time to Change depicts a book that fights larger concerns such as power, communication and the limitations of languages in the world. In addition, Ezekiel touches upon sexuality, human nature, and religion. Ezekiel is known in his early work that the titles of the poems describe the content of the poem and are closely related to the meaning.

Ezekiel has distinctive views of his language when it comes to his poetry. In Ezekiel&#x27;s earlier works much of the collection was defined by large language with a focus on rhyme, meter, and poetic form. In Ezekiel&#x27;s poetry the quality of the heart is evident through his undertones, irony, and self mockery. Within his poetry the lines are a similar length and if the poem has stanza, the stanza will have a similar number of lines. This demonstrates Ezekiel&#x27;s attention to detail with his writing by using symmetry, further emphasizing Ezekiel&#x27;s early dependence for structure in poetry. Ezekiel follows what Rene Wellek and Austin Warren use in their Theory of Literature or the &quot;extrinsic&quot; approach which examines literature in the broader context as it understands the relationship to society. It also looks at how literature has an impact by other influences in the world. The &quot;extrinsic&quot; approach follows closely to how Ezekiel writes because he writes about society, personal experiences, and human connections. Ezekiel also uses the &quot;itrinsic&quot; approach which focuses on the elements of the literature in itself such as using metaphors, similes, images, and the techniques that are found in the text. Ezekiel emphasizes the importance of creating literature that connects on a global scale. He references Berdyaev&#x27;s ideological approaches with creativity and how the poet should not imitate other cultures but should be genuine in their writing. The poet should prioritize their integrity and own experiences in poetry. Ezekiel believes the cultural roles are secondary which leads him to believe that poetry has a universal likening. For instance, Ezekiel emphasizes the significance of humanity in the universe in his poem &quot;Morning Prayer&quot;.

He published another volume of poems, &quot;The deadly man&quot; in 1960. After working as an advertising copywriter and general manager of a picture frame company (1954–59), he co-founded the literary monthly &quot;Jumpo&quot;, in 1961. He became art critic of &quot;The Times of India&quot; (1964–66) and edited &quot;Poetry India&quot; (1966–67). From 1961 to 1972, he headed the English department of Mithibai College, Bombay. &quot;The Exact Name&quot;, his fifth book of poetry, was published in 1965. During this period he held short-term tenure as visiting professor at University of Leeds (1964) and University of Pondicherry (1967). In 1969, at the Writers Workshop, Ezekiel published his &quot;Three Plays&quot; which includes &quot;Nalini, Marriage Poem, The Sleep-walkers&quot;. A year later, he presented an art series of ten programmes for Indian television. In 1976, he translated Jawaharlal Nehru&#x27;s poetry from English to Marathi, in collaboration with Vrinda Nabar, and co-edited a fiction and poetry anthology. His poem &quot;The Night of the Scorpion&quot; is used as study material in Indian and Colombian schools. Ezekiel also penned poems in &#x27;Indian English&#x27; like the one based on instruction boards in his favourite Irani café. His poems are used in NCERT and ICSE English textbooks. His poem &#x27;Background, Casually&#x27; is considered to be the most defining poem of his poetic and personal career.

Nissim Ezekiel is often considered the father of Modern Indian English poetry by many critics.

He was honoured with the Padmashri award by the President of India in 1988 and the Sahitya Akademi cultural award in 1983.

==Editor==

He edited &quot;The Indian P.E.N&quot;., official organ of P.E.N. All-India Centre, Bombay from The Theosophy Hall, New Marine Lines, and encouraged poets and writers.

He was the founding editor of &quot;Quest&quot; in 1954.

==Death==
After a prolonged battle with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Nissim Ezekiel died in Mumbai, on 9 January 2004 (aged 79).

<text>Marzullo&#x27;s algorithm, invented by Keith Marzullo for his Ph.D. dissertation in 1984, is an &quot;agreement algorithm&quot; used to select sources for estimating accurate time from a number of noisy time sources. A refined version of it, renamed the &quot;intersection algorithm&quot;, forms part of the modern Network Time Protocol.
Marzullo&#x27;s algorithm is also used to compute the relaxed intersection of n boxes (or more generally &quot;n&quot; subsets of R&quot;n&quot;), as required by several robust set estimation methods.

==Purpose==

Marzullo&#x27;s algorithm is efficient in terms of time for producing an optimal value from a set of estimates with confidence intervals where the actual value may be outside the confidence interval for some sources. In this case the best estimate is taken to be the smallest interval consistent with the largest number of sources.

If we have the estimates 10 ± 2, 12 ± 1 and 11 ± 1 then these intervals are [8,12], [11,13] and [10,12] which intersect to form [11,12] or 11.5 ± 0.5 as consistent with all three values. 
If instead the ranges are [8,12], [11,13] and [14,15] then there is no interval consistent with all these values but [11,12] is consistent with the largest number of sources — namely, two of them. 
Finally, if the ranges are [8,9], [8,12] and [10,12] then both the intervals [8,9] and [10,12] are consistent with the largest number of sources.
This procedure determines an interval. If the desired result is a best value from that interval then a naive approach would be to take the center of the interval as the value, which is what was specified in the original Marzullo algorithm. A more sophisticated approach would recognize that this could be throwing away useful information from the confidence intervals of the sources and that a probabilistic model of the sources could return a value other than the center.

Note that the computed value is probably better described as &quot;optimistic&quot; rather than &quot;optimal&quot;. For example, consider three intervals [10,12], [11, 13] and [11.99,13]. The algorithm described below computes [11.99, 12] or 11.995 ± 0.005 which is a very precise value. If we suspect that one of the estimates might be incorrect, then at least two of the estimates must be correct. Under this condition, the best estimate is [11,13] since this is the largest interval that always intersects at least two estimates. The algorithm described below is easily parameterized with the maximum number of incorrect estimates.

==Method==

Marzullo&#x27;s algorithm begins by preparing a table of the sources, sorting it and then searching (efficiently) for the intersections of intervals. For each source there is a range [c−r,c+r] defined by c ± r. For each range the table will have two tuples of the form . One tuple will represent the beginning of the range, marked with type −1 as and the other will represent the end with type +1 as .

The description of the algorithm uses the following variables: best (largest number of overlapping intervals found), cnt (current number of overlapping intervals), beststart and bestend (the beginning and end of best interval found so far), i (an index), and the table of tuples.
# Sort the table by the offset. (If two tuples with the same offset but opposite types exist, indicating that one interval ends just as another begins, then a method of deciding which comes first is necessary. Such an occurrence can be considered an overlap with no duration, which can be found by the algorithm by putting type −1 before type +1. If such pathological overlaps are considered objectionable they can be avoided by putting type +1 before −1 in this case.)
# [initialize] best=0 cnt=0
# [loop] go through each tuple in the table in ascending order
:# if cnt&gt;best then best=cnt beststart=offset[i] bestend=offset[i+1]

:&quot;commentary: the next tuple, at [i+1], will either be an end of an interval (type=+1) in which case it ends this best interval, or it will be a beginning of an interval (type=−1) and in the next step will replace best.&quot;

:&quot;ambiguity: unspecified is what to do if best=cnt. This is a condition of a tie for greatest overlap. The decision can either be made to take the smaller of bestend−beststart and offset[i+1]−offset[i] or just take an arbitrary one of the two equally good entries. This decision is relevant only when type[i+1]=+1.&quot;

==Efficiency==
Marzullo&#x27;s algorithm is efficient in both space and time. The asymptotic space usage is O(n), where n is the number of sources. In considering the asymptotic time requirement the algorithm can be considered to consist of building the table, sorting it and searching it. Sorting can be done in O(n log n) time, and this dominates the building and searching phases which can be performed in linear time. Therefore, the time efficiency of Marzullo&#x27;s algorithm is O(n log n).

Once the table has been built and sorted it is possible to update the interval for one source (when new information is received) in linear time. Therefore, updating data for one source and finding the best interval can be done in O(n) time.

<text>In oceanography, a gyre () is any large system of ocean surface currents moving in a circular fashion driven by wind movements. Gyres are caused by the Coriolis effect; planetary vorticity, horizontal friction and vertical friction determine the circulatory patterns from the &quot;wind stress curl&quot; (torque).

&quot;Gyre&quot; can refer to any type of vortex in an atmosphere or a sea, even one that is human-created, but it is most commonly used in terrestrial oceanography to refer to the major ocean systems.

== Gyre formation ==
The largest ocean gyres are wind-driven, meaning that their locations and dynamics are controlled by the prevailing global wind patterns: easterlies at the tropics and westerlies at the midlatitudes. These wind patterns result in a wind stress curl that drives Ekman pumping in the subtropics (resulting in downwelling) and Ekman suction in subpolar regions (resulting in upwelling). Ekman pumping results in an increased sea surface height at the center of the gyre and anticyclonic geostrophic currents in subtropical gyres. Ekman suction results in a depressed sea surface height and cyclonic geostrophic currents in subpolar gyres.

Wind-driven ocean gyres are asymmetrical, with stronger flows on their western boundary and weaker flows throughout their interior. The weak interior flow that is typical over most of the gyre is a result of the conservation of potential vorticity. In the shallow water equations (applicable for basin-scale flow as the horizontal length scale is much greater than the vertical length scale), potential vorticity is a function of relative (local) vorticity formula_1 (zeta), planetary vorticity formula_2, and the depth formula_3, and is conserved with respect to the material derivative:

: formula_4

In the case of the subtropical ocean gyre, Ekman pumping results in water piling up in the center of the gyre, compressing water parcels. This results in a decrease in formula_3, so by the conservation of potential vorticity the numerator formula_6 must also decrease. It can be further simplified by realizing that, in basin-scale ocean gyres, the relative vorticity formula_1 is small, meaning that local changes in vorticity cannot account for the decrease in formula_3. Thus, the water parcel must change its planetary vorticity formula_2 accordingly. The only way to decrease the planetary vorticity is by moving the water parcel equatorward, so throughout the majority of subtropical gyres there is a weak equatorward flow. Harald Sverdrup quantified this phenomenon in his 1947 paper, &quot;Wind Driven Currents in a Baroclinic Ocean&quot;, in which the (depth-integrated) Sverdrup balance is defined as:

: formula_10

Here, formula_11 is the meridional mass transport (positive north), formula_12 is the Rossby parameter, formula_13 is the water density, and formula_14 is the vertical Ekman velocity due to wind stress curl (positive up). It can be clearly seen in this equation that for a negative Ekman velocity (e.g., Ekman pumping in subtropical gyres), meridional mass transport (Sverdrup transport) is negative (south, equatorward) in the northern hemisphere (formula_15). Conversely, for a positive Ekman velocity (e.g., Ekman suction in subpolar gyres), Sverdrup transport is positive (north, poleward) in the northern hemisphere. 
=== Western intensification ===

As the Sverdrup balance argues, subtropical ocean gyres have a weak equatorward flow and subpolar ocean gyres have a weak poleward flow over most of their area. However, there must be some return flow that goes against the Sverdrup transport in order to preserve mass balance. In this respect, the Sverdrup solution is incomplete, as it has no mechanism in which to predict this return flow. Contributions by both Henry Stommel and Walter Munk resolved this issue by showing that the return flow of gyres is done through an intensified western boundary current. Stommel&#x27;s solution relies on a frictional bottom boundary layer which is not necessarily physical in a stratified ocean (currents do not always extend to the bottom).

Munk&#x27;s solution instead relies on friction between the return flow and the sidewall of the basin. This allows for two cases: one with the return flow on the western boundary (western boundary current) and one with the return flow on the eastern boundary (eastern boundary current). A qualitative argument for the presence of western boundary current solutions over eastern boundary current solutions can be found again through the conservation of potential vorticity. Considering again the case of a subtropical northern hemisphere gyre, the return flow must be northward. In order to move northward (an increase in planetary vorticity formula_2), there must be a source of positive relative vorticity to the system. The relative vorticity in the shallow-water system is:

: formula_17

Here formula_18 is again the meridional velocity and formula_19 is the zonal velocity. In the sense of a northward return flow, the zonal component is neglected and only the meridional velocity is important for relative vorticity. Thus, this solution requires that formula_20 in order to increase the relative vorticity and have a valid northward return flow in the northern hemisphere subtropical gyre.

Due to friction at the boundary, the velocity of flow must go to zero at the sidewall before reaching some maximum northward velocity within the boundary layer and decaying to the southward Sverdrup transport solution far away from the boundary. Thus, the condition that formula_20 can only be satisfied through a western boundary frictional layer, as the eastern boundary frictional layer forces formula_22. One can make similar arguments for subtropical gyres in the southern hemisphere and for subpolar gyres in either hemisphere and see that the result remains the same: the return flow of an ocean gyre is always in the form of a western boundary current.

The western boundary current must transport on the same order of water as the interior Sverdrup transport in a much smaller area. This means western boundary currents are much stronger than interior currents, a phenomenon called &quot;western intensification&quot;.

== Gyre distribution ==

=== Subtropical gyres ===

There are five major subtropical gyres across the world&#x27;s oceans: the North Atlantic Gyre, the South Atlantic Gyre, the Indian Ocean Gyre, the North Pacific Gyre, and the South Pacific Gyre. All subtropical gyres are anticyclonic, meaning that in the northern hemisphere they rotate clockwise, while the gyres in the southern hemisphere rotate counterclockwise. This is due to the Coriolis force. Subtropical gyres typically consist of four currents: a westward flowing equatorial current, a poleward flowing, narrow, and strong western boundary current, an eastward flowing current in the midlatitudes, and an equatorward flowing, weaker, and broader eastern boundary current.

==== North Atlantic Gyre ====
The North Atlantic Gyre is located in the northern hemisphere in the Atlantic Ocean, between the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in the south and Iceland in the north. The North Equatorial Current brings warm waters west towards the Caribbean and defines the southern edge of the North Atlantic Gyre. Once these waters reach the Caribbean they join the warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico and form the Gulf Stream, a western boundary current. This current then heads north and east towards Europe, forming the North Atlantic Current. The Canary Current flows south along the western coast of Europe and north Africa, completing the gyre circulation. The center of the gyre is the Sargasso Sea, which is characterized by the dense accumulation of &quot;Sargassum&quot; seaweed.

==== South Atlantic Gyre ====
The South Atlantic Gyre is located in the southern hemisphere in the Atlantic Ocean, between the Intertropical Convergence Zone in the north and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to the south. The South Equatorial Current brings water west towards South America, forming the northern boundary of the South Atlantic gyre. Here, the water moves south in the Brazil Current, the western boundary current of the South Atlantic Gyre. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current forms both the southern boundary of the gyre and the eastward component of the gyre circulation. Eventually, the water reaches the west coast of Africa, where it is brought north along the coast as a part of the eastern boundary Benguela Current, completing the gyre circulation. The Benguela Current experiences the Benguela Niño event, an Atlantic Ocean analogue to the Pacific Ocean&#x27;s El Niño, and is correlated with a reduction in primary productivity in the Benguela upwelling zone.

==== Indian Ocean Gyre ====
The Indian Ocean Gyre, located in the Indian Ocean, is, like the South Atlantic Gyre, bordered by the Intertropical Convergence Zone in the north and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to the south. The South Equatorial Current forms the northern boundary of the Indian Ocean Gyre as it flows west along the equator towards the east coast of Africa. At the coast of Africa, the South Equatorial Current is split by Madagascar into the Mozambique Current, flowing south through the Mozambique Channel, and the East Madagascar Current, flowing south along the east coast of Madagascar, both of which are western boundary currents. South of Madagascar the two currents join to form the Agulhas Current. The Agulhas Current flows south until it joins the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which flows east at the southern edge of the Indian Ocean Gyre. Due to the African continent not extending as far south as the Indian Ocean Gyre, some of the water in the Agulhas Current &quot;leaks&quot; into the Atlantic Ocean, with potentially important effects for global thermohaline circulation. The gyre circulation is completed by the north flowing West Australian Current, which forms the eastern boundary of the gyre.

==== North Pacific Gyre ====
The North Pacific Gyre, one of the largest ecosystems on Earth, is bordered to the south by the Intertropical Convergence Zone and extending north to roughly 50°N. At the southern boundary of the North Pacific Gyre, the North Equatorial Current flows west along the equator towards southeast Asia. The Kuroshio Current is the western boundary current of the North Pacific Gyre, flowing northeast along the coast of Japan. At roughly 50°N, the flow turns east and becomes the North Pacific Current. The North Pacific Current flows east, eventually bifurcating near the west coast of North America into the northward flowing Alaska Current and the southward flowing California Current. The Alaska Current is the eastern boundary current of the subpolar Alaska Gyre, while the California Current is the eastern boundary current that completes the North Pacific Gyre circulation. Within the North Pacific Gyre is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, an area of increased plastic waste concentration.

==== South Pacific Gyre ====
The South Pacific Gyre, like its northern counterpart, is one of the largest ecosystems on Earth with an area that accounts for around 10% of the global ocean surface area. Within this massive area is Point Nemo, the location on Earth that is farthest away from all continental landmass (2,688 km away from the closest land). The remoteness of this gyre complicates sampling, causing this gyre to be historically under sampled in oceanographic datasets. At the northern boundary of the South Pacific Gyre, the South Equatorial Current flows west towards southeast Asia and Australia. There, it turns south as it flows in the East Australian Current, a western boundary current. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current again returns the water to the east. The flow turns north along the western coast of South America in the Humboldt Current, the eastern boundary current that completes the South Pacific Gyre circulation. Like the North Pacific Gyre, the South Pacific Gyre has an elevated concentration of plastic waste near the center, termed the South Pacific garbage patch. Unlike the North Pacific garbage patch which was first described in 1988, the South Pacific garbage patch was discovered much more recently in 2016 (a testament to the extreme remoteness of the South Pacific Gyre).

=== Subpolar gyres ===
Subpolar gyres form at high latitudes (around 60°). Circulation of surface wind and ocean water is cyclonic, counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere, around a low-pressure area, such as the persistent Aleutian Low and the Icelandic Low. The wind stress curl in this region drives the Ekman suction, which creates an upwelling of nutrient-rich water from the lower depths.

Subpolar circulation in the southern hemisphere is dominated by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, due to the lack of large landmasses breaking up the Southern Ocean. There are minor gyres in the Weddell Sea and the Ross Sea, the Weddell Gyre and Ross Gyre, which circulate in a clockwise direction.

==== North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre ====

The North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre, located in the North Atlantic Ocean, is characterized by a counterclockwise rotation of surface waters. It plays a crucial role in the global oceanic conveyor belt system, influencing climate and marine ecosystems. The gyre is driven by the convergence of warm, salty waters from the south and cold, fresher waters from the north. As these waters meet, the warm, dense water sinks beneath the lighter, colder water, initiating a complex circulation pattern. The North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre has significant implications for climate regulation, as it helps redistribute heat and nutrients throughout the North Atlantic, influencing weather patterns and supporting diverse marine life. Additionally, changes in the gyre&#x27;s strength and circulation can impact regional climate variability and may be influenced by broader climate change trends.

The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a key component of the global climate system through its transport of heat and freshwater. The North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre is in a region where the AMOC is actively developed and shaped through mixing and water mass transformation. It is a region where large amounts of heat transported northward by the ocean are released into the atmosphere, thereby modifying the climate of northwest Europe. The North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre has a complex topography with a series of basins in which the large-scale circulation is characterized by cyclonic boundary currents and interior recirculation. The North Atlantic Current develops out of the Gulf Stream extension and turns eastward, crossing the Atlantic in a wide band between about 45°N and 55°N creating the southern border of the North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre. There are several branches of the North Atlantic Current, and they flow into an eastern intergyral region in the Bay of Biscay, the Rockall Trough, the Iceland Basin, and the Irminger Sea. Part of the North Atlantic Current flows into the Norwegian Sea, and some recirculate within the boundary currents of the subpolar gyre.

====Ross Gyre====

The Ross Gyre is located in the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica, just outside of the Ross Sea. This gyre is characterized by a clockwise rotation of surface waters, driven by the combined influence of wind, the Earth&#x27;s rotation, and the shape of the seafloor. The gyre plays a crucial role in the transport of heat, nutrients, and marine life in the Southern Ocean, affecting the distribution of sea ice and influencing regional climate patterns.

The Ross Sea, Antarctica, is a region where the mixing of distinct water masses and complex interactions with the cryosphere lead to the production and export of dense water, with global-scale impacts. which controls the proximity of the warm waters of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to the Ross Sea continental shelf, where they may drive ice shelf melting and increase sea level. The deepening of sea level pressures over the Southeast Pacific/Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas generates a cyclonic circulation cell that reduces sea surface heights north of the Ross Gyre via Ekman suction. The relative reduction of sea surface heights to the north facilitates a northeastward expansion of the outer boundary of the Ross Gyre. Further, the gyre is intensified by a westward ocean stress anomaly over its southern boundary. The ensuing southward Ekman transport anomaly raises sea surface heights over the continental shelf and accelerates the westward throughflow by increasing the cross-slope pressure gradient. The sea level pressure center may have a greater impact on the Ross Gyre transport or the throughflow, depending on its location and strength. This gyre has significant effects on interactions in the Southern Ocean between waters of the Antarctic margin, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and intervening gyres with a strong seasonal sea ice cover play a major role in the climate system.

The Ross Sea is the southernmost sea on Earth and holds the United States&#x27; McMurdo Station and Italian Zuchelli Station. Even though this gyre is located nearby two of the most prominent research stations in the world for Antarctic study, the Ross Gyre remains one of the least sampled gyres in the world.

====Weddell Gyre====
The Weddell Gyre is located in the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica, just outside of the Weddell Sea. It is characterized by a clockwise rotation of surface waters, influenced by the combined effects of winds, the Earth&#x27;s rotation, and the seafloor&#x27;s topography. Like the Ross Gyre, the Weddell Gyre plays a critical role in the movement of heat, nutrients, and marine life in the Southern Ocean. Insights into the behavior and variability of the Weddell Gyre are crucial for comprehending the interaction between ocean processes in the southern hemisphere and their implications for the global climate system.

This gyre is formed by interactions between the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Antarctic Continental Shelf. The Weddell Gyre (WG) is one of the main oceanographic features of the Southern Ocean south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current which plays an influential role in global ocean circulation as well as gas exchange with the atmosphere. The WG is situated in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, south of 55–60°S and roughly between 60°W and 30°E (Deacon, 1979). It stretches over the Weddell abyssal plain, where the Weddell Sea is situated, and extends east into the Enderby abyssal plain.

==== Beaufort Sea Gyre ====

The anti-cyclonic Beaufort Gyre is the dominant circulation of the Canada Basin and the largest freshwater reservoir in the Arctic Ocean&#x27;s western and northern sectors. The Gyre is characterized by a large-scale, quasi-permanent, counterclockwise rotation of surface waters within the Beaufort Sea. This gyre functions as a critical mechanism for the transport of heat, nutrients, and sea ice within the Arctic region, thus influencing the physical and biological characteristics of the marine environment. Negative wind stress curl over the region, mediated by the sea ice pack, leads to Ekman pumping, downwelling of isopycnal surfaces, and storage of ~20,000 km3 of freshwater in the upper few hundred meters of the ocean. The gyre gains energy from winds in the south and loses energy in the north over a mean annual cycle. The strong atmospheric circulation in the autumn, combined with significant areas of open water, demonstrates the effect that wind stress has directly on the surface geostrophic currents. The Beaufort Gyre and the Transpolar Drift are interconnected due to their relationship in their role in transporting sea ice across the Arctic Ocean. Their influence on the distribution of freshwater has broad impacts for global sea level rise and climate dynamics.

== Biogeochemistry of Gyres ==

Depending on their location around the world, gyres can be regions of high biological productivity or low productivity. Each gyre has a unique ecological profile but can be grouped by region due to dominating characteristics. Generally, productivity is greater for cyclonic gyres (e.g., subpolar gyres) that drive upwelling through Ekman suction and lesser for anticyclonic gyres (e.g., subtropical gyres) that drive downwelling through Ekman pumping, but this can differ between seasons and regions.

Subtropical gyres are sometimes described as &quot;ocean deserts&quot; or &quot;biological deserts&quot;, in reference to arid land deserts where little life exists. Due to their oligotrophic characteristics, warm subtropical gyres have some of the least productive waters per unit surface area in the ocean. The downwelling of water that occurs in subtropical gyres takes nutrients deeper in the ocean, removing them from surface waters. Organic particles can also be removed from surface waters through gravitational sinking, where the particle is too heavy to remain suspended in the water column. However, since subtropical gyres cover 60% of the ocean surface, their relatively low production per unit area is made up for by covering massive areas of the Earth. This means that, despite being areas of relatively low productivity and low nutrients, they play a large role in contributing to the overall amount of ocean production.

In contrast to subtropical gyres, subpolar gyres can have a lot of biological activity due to Ekman suction upwelling driven by wind stress curl. Subpolar gyres in the North Atlantic have a &quot;bloom and crash&quot; pattern following seasonal and storm patterns. The highest productivity in the North Atlantic occurs in boreal spring when there are long days and high levels of nutrients. This is different to the subpolar North Pacific, where almost no phytoplankton bloom occurs and patterns of respiration are more consistent through time than in the North Atlantic.

=== Nutrient availability ===

Primary production in the ocean is heavily dependent on the presence of nutrients and the availability of sunlight. Here, nutrients refers to nitrogen, nitrate, phosphate, and silicate, all important nutrients in biogeochemical processes that take place in the ocean. A commonly accepted method for relating different nutrient availabilities to each other in order to describe chemical processes is the Redfield, Ketchum, and Richards (RKR) equation. This equation describes the process of photosynthesis and respiration and the ratios of the nutrients involved.

The RKR Equation for Photosynthesis and Respiration:

: &lt;chem&gt;106CO2 +16HNO3 +H3PO4 +122H2O -&gt;(CH2O)106(NH3)16H3PO4 +138O2&lt;/chem&gt;
With the correct ratios of nutrients on the left side of the RKR equation and sunlight, photosynthesis takes place to produce plankton (primary production) and oxygen. Typically, the limiting nutrients to production are nitrogen and phosphorus with nitrogen being the most limiting.

Lack of nutrients in the surface waters of subtropical gyres is related to the strong downwelling and sinking of particles that occurs in these areas as mentioned earlier. However, nutrients are still present in these gyres. These nutrients can come from not only vertical transport, but also lateral transport across gyre fronts. This lateral transport helps make up for the large loss of nutrients due to downwelling and particle sinking. However, the major source of nitrate in the nitrate-limited subtropical gyres is a result of biological, not physical, factors. Nitrogen in subtropical gyres is produced primarily by nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which are common throughout most of the oligotrophic waters of subtropical gyres. These bacteria transform atmospheric nitrogen into bioavailable forms.

==== High-nutrient, low-chlorophyll regions ====
The Alaskan Gyre and Western Subarctic Gyre are an iron-limited environment rather than a nitrogen or phosphorus limited environment. This region relies on dust blowing off the state of Alaska and other landmasses nearby to supply iron. Because it is limited by iron instead of nitrogen or phosphorus, it is known as high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll region. Iron limitation in high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll regions results in water that is rich in other nutrients because they have not been removed by the small populations of plankton that live there.

==== Seasonality in the North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre ====
The North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre is an important part of the ocean&#x27;s carbon dioxide drawdown mechanism. The photosynthesis of phytoplankton communities in this area seasonally depletes surface waters of carbon dioxide, removing it through primary production. This primary production occurs seasonally, with the highest amounts happening in summer. Generally, spring is an important time for photosynthesis as the light limitation imposed during winter is lifted and there are high levels of nutrients available. However, in the North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre, spring productivity is low in comparison to expected levels. It is hypothesized that this low productivity is because phytoplankton are less efficiently using light than they do in the summer months.

=== Trophic levels ===
Ocean gyres typically contain 5–6 trophic levels. The limiting factor for the number of trophic levels is the size of the phytoplankton, which are generally small in nutrient limited gyres. In low oxygen zones, oligotrophs are a large percentage of the phytoplankton.

At the intermediate level, small fishes and squid (especially &quot;ommastrephidae&quot;) dominate the nektonic biomass. They are important for the transport of energy from low trophic levels to high trophic levels. In some gyres, &quot;ommastrephidae&quot; are a major part of many animals&#x27; diets and can support the existence of large marine life.

== Indigenous knowledge of ocean patterns ==
Indigenous Traditional Ecological Knowledge recognizes that Indigenous people, as the original caretakers, hold unique relationships with the land and waters. These relationships make TEK difficult to define, as Traditional Knowledge means something different to each person, each community, and each caretaker. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples begins by reminding readers that “respect for Indigenous knowledge, cultures and traditional practices contributes to sustainable and equitable development and proper management of the environment” Attempts to collect and store this knowledge have been made over the past twenty years. Conglomerates such as The Indigenous Knowledge Social Network (SIKU) https://siku.org/, the Igliniit project, and the Wales Inupiaq Sea Ice Directory have made strides in the inclusion and documentation of indigenous people&#x27;s thoughts on global climate, oceanographic, and social trends.

One example involves ancient Polynesians and how they discovered and then travelled throughout the Pacific Ocean from modern day Polynesia to Hawaii and New Zealand. Known as wayfinding, navigators would use the stars, winds, and ocean currents to know where they were on the ocean and where they were headed. These navigators were intimately familiar with Pacific currents that create the North Pacific gyre and this way of navigating continues today.

Another example involves the Māori people who came from Polynesia and are an indigenous group in New Zealand. Their way of life and culture has strong connections to the ocean. The Māori believe that the sea is the source of all life and is an energy, called Tangaroa. This energy could manifest in many different ways, like strong ocean currents, calm seas, or turbulent storms. The Māori have a rich oral history of navigation within the Southern Ocean and Antarctic Ocean and a deep understanding their ice and ocean patterns. A current research project is aimed at consolidating these oral histories. Efforts are being made to integrate TEK with Western science in marine and ocean research in New Zealand. Additional research efforts aim to collate indigenous oral histories and incorporate indigenous knowledge into climate change adaptation practices in New Zealand that will directly affect the Māori and other indigenous communities.

== Climate change ==
Ocean circulation re-distributes the heat and water-resources, therefore determines the regional climate. For example, the western branches of the subtropical gyres flow from the lower latitudes towards higher latitudes, bringing relatively warm and moist air to the adjacent land, contributing to a mild and wet climate (e.g., East China, Japan). In contrast, the eastern boundary currents of the subtropical gyres streaming from the higher latitudes towards lower latitudes, corresponding to a relatively cold and dry climate (e.g., California).

Currently, the core of the subtropical gyres are around 30° in both Hemispheres. However, their positions were not always there. Satellite observational sea surface height and sea surface temperature data suggest that the world&#x27;s major ocean gyres are slowly moving towards higher latitudes in the past few decades. Such feature show agreement with climate model prediction under anthropogenic global warming. Paleo-climate reconstruction also suggest that during the past cold climate intervals, i.e., ice ages, some of the western boundary currents (western branches of the subtropical ocean gyres) are closer to the equator than their modern positions. These evidence implies that global warming is very likely to push the large-scale ocean gyres towards higher latitudes.

<text>Baranów Sandomierski is a small town in southern Poland, in the Subcarpathian Voivodship, Tarnobrzeg County on the Vistula River, with 1,420 inhabitants as of December 2021. Baranów lies near the Vistula river, along voivodeship road nr. 985, which goes from Tarnobrzeg to Mielec. It belongs to the historic province of Lesser Poland, and for centuries was part of the Sandomierz Voivodeship. Its name comes either from sheep husbandry, which was prevalent in this area in the past (&quot;baran&quot; means ram in Polish), or from the Baranowski family, owners of the town.

==History==
The settlement or the gord of Baranów was first mentioned in 1135. It was conveniently located near the Vistula river ford, and in 1354 it was granted town charter by King Casimir III the Great. Baranów belonged to the Baranowski family, and in the late 15th century it became the property of the Kurozwecki family. In 1518 Barbara Kurozwecka married Stanisław Górka, so Baranów remained in the hands of the Górka family until 1560, when it was sold to Rafał Leszczyński. During the Protestant Reformation, Baranów was an important center of Calvinism. The town prospered due to grain trade, as well as its artisans. Its decline began during the catastrophic Swedish invasion of Poland (1655 - 1660), when Baranów was ransacked and burned.

In 1677 the town was sold to Dymitr Wiśniowiecki, later on it belonged to the Lubomirski family, and the Potocki family. In the mid-18th century its population was ca. 1,200. After the partitions of Poland Baranów found itself in the Austrian province of Galicia, where it remained from 1772 until 1918. The town further declined, as it was located near the tightly sealed Austrian - Russian border. Furthermore, frequent Vistula floods caused extensive damages, and on 24 August 1898 almost the whole town burned in a fire. Its decline was so severe that Baranów lost its town charter in 1896, remaining a village until 1934.

In the Second Polish Republic Baranów became part of Tarnobrzeg County, Lwów Voivodeship. In 1933, Baranów received its coat of arms. During the 1939 Invasion of Poland, units of the Kraków Army withdrew eastwards in the area of Baranów.

Throughout its occupation in Poland, the Baranów Castle was the seat of a local German administrative office. In June 1942, the German occupiers established the Baranów Ghetto, relocating over two thousand Jewish people from the city, Tarnobrzeg, and the surrounding villages. The next month, in July, the ghetto was liquidated, with the Jewish inhabitants being forcefully relocated to a ghetto in Dębica. About 60 people would be shot during this relocation.

Before World War II, around 1500 Jews lived in the town, however, most of them were murdered in the Holocaust.

In July 1944, units of the Red Army crossed the Vistula near the town, creating the so-called Baranów Bridgehead (see Vistula–Oder Offensive).

Between 1975 and 1998, the town belonged to the Tarnobrzeg Voivodeship.

==Castle==

The town is well known for its picturesque Renaissance castle/palace built in 1591–1606.

It is known as &quot;little Wawel&quot;. This castle is a class zero monument. It is believed to be the work of the famous architect, Santi Gucci, the court artist of King Sigismund II Augustus, who brought many foreign architects from around Europe to Poland in the 16th century. The castle was built around 1591–1606 for Rafał and Andrzej Leszczyński. Its style comes from the Italian renaissance. By the end of the 17th century, the next owners were the Lubomirski family, who decided to change the residence. They hired a Dutch architect, who added columns on the inside of the castle courtyard, on which there was a gallery of art by Giovanni Battista (unfortunately all the art was destroyed in two fires in 1848 and 1898).

<text>Stuart Elliott Eizenstat (born January 15, 1943) is an American diplomat and attorney. He served as the United States Ambassador to the European Union from 1993 to 1996 and as the United States Deputy Secretary of the Treasury from 1999 to 2001. For many years, and currently (as of 2025) he has served as a partner and Senior Counsel at the Washington, D.C.–based law firm Covington &amp; Burling and as a senior strategist at APCO Worldwide.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Stuart E. Eizenstat was born on January 15, 1943, in Chicago and raised in Atlanta; he was an all-city and honorable-mention All-America basketball player in high school. He earned an A.B. &quot;cum laude&quot; and Phi Beta Kappa, in political science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he was a brother of the Alpha Pi chapter of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity. He received his Juris Doctor degree from Harvard Law School in 1967. Eizenstat attended Blue Star Camps in Hendersonville, North Carolina, as a youth.

===Career===
He served as a law clerk for the Honorable Newell Edenfield of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.

Eizenstat worked as the issues director of Jimmy Carter&#x27;s 1970 gubernatorial campaign. 

Eizenstat worked on Carter&#x27;s 1976 presidential campaign. He served as his point man in the drafting of the 1976 party platform and headed the issues operations of Carter&#x27;s campaign.
From 1977 to 1981, he was President Carter&#x27;s Chief Domestic Policy Adviser, and Executive Director of the White House Domestic Policy Staff. 

In 1983, he wrote for &quot;Quarante&quot; magazine an article entitled &quot;The Quiet Revolution&quot;. He was the first to describe the &quot;feminization of poverty&quot;. He was President Bill Clinton&#x27;s Deputy Secretary of the Treasury (1999–2001), Under Secretary of State for Economic, Business, and Agricultural Affairs (1997–1999), and also served as the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade at the International Trade Administration (ITA) from 1996 to 1997.

In 1984, Eizenstat was elected as a fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration.

He has served as the United States Ambassador to the European Union from 1993 to 1996 and as co-chairman of the European-American Business Council (EABC). Additionally, he is a member of the Board of Advisors of the Global Panel Foundation.

Eizenstat led the U.S. delegation at the Third Conference of the Parties in Kyoto, Japan, which concluded by adopting the Kyoto Protocol and military exemptions to emissions controls.

In 2008, the Ambassador Stuart E. Eizenstat Distinguished Professorship in Jewish history and culture was endowed in Eizenstat&#x27;s honor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. For his work he has received the Courage and Conscience Award from the Government of Israel, the Knight Commander&#x27;s Cross (Badge and Star) of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, the French Legion of Honor from the Government of France, and the International Advocate for Peace Award from the Cardozo Journal of Conflict Resolution.

Eizenstat is also a member of the Atlantic Council&#x27;s Board of Directors.

On January 9, Eizenstat gave a eulogy for Carter upon the event of his 2025 state funeral. His stated purpose was to dispel the myth that Carter was an unsuccessful president but was successful in the years of his post-presidency.

===Holocaust restitution===
Eizenstat has devoted much effort to various aspects of Holocaust restitution. This has included partial recompense for slave and forced labor, and most recently in 2018 for the trauma suffered by Kindertransport. It has also included restitution of Holocaust-era assets to their original owners or their heirs. Initially, he did this as President Clinton&#x27;s &quot;Special Representative of the President and Secretary of State on Holocaust-Era Issues.&quot; In this position, he took a leadership role for many nations. In this role, he was approached by Turkish ambassador Şükrü Elekdağ who told him that &quot;Turkey could no longer guarantee the safety of the Jews in Turkey&quot; if there was any mention of the Armenian genocide in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Eizenstat has continued this role as a private citizen. In 1998, he organized the Washington Conference on Holocaust Era Assets, resulting in the Washington Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art.

Eizenstat acted on many occasions as a negotiator to gain payments by the current German government to Holocaust survivors, or their heirs. He also negotiated major agreements with the Swiss, Austrian, French, and other European governments, concerning slave and forced labor, which included life insurance policy payments to heirs of victims of the Holocaust; and restitution of Holocaust victim bank account assets, as well as of artworks which had been looted by the Nazis to their original owners, or their heirs. (Many such artworks had been acquired at a later date by National museums or important private museums.) One such piece is Gustav Klimt&#x27;s &quot;Lady in Gold&quot; which was returned to Maria Altmann. 

In 2018, he helped negotiate a symbolic payment of 2,500 euros to those who had survived the Holocaust by having escaped it through the Kindertransport program, which had been assisted by the British government. This followed the precedent established in 2014 when Child Survivors negotiated a symbolic payment of 2,500 euros to child Holocaust survivors. The Kindertransport survivors were also Holocaust survivors, since they had been separated from their parents, often as very young children, and nearly all of them later discovered that their parents had died as victims of the Nazis. Eizenstat wrote about his restitution efforts in his book &quot;Imperfect Justice: Looted Assets, Slave Labor, and the Unfinished Business of World War II&quot; (2009). 

In 2013 Eizenstat was appointed &quot;Special Advisor for Holocaust Issues&quot; to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He served as Expert Advisor on Holocaust Issues during the first Trump administration, and in 2021 he was appointed by the Biden administration to serve as Special Advisor on Holocaust Issues.

===Personal life===
He was married to the late Frances Eizenstat and has two sons and eight grandchildren.

<doc id="776687" wikidata="Q7071352" url="?curid=776687" title="Nzo Ekangaki">
<text>Nzo Ekangaki (22 March 1934 – 3 June 2005) was a Cameroonian political figure. He served as the Secretary-General of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) from 1972 to 1974.
== Biography ==
Ekangaki was born in Nguti, Kumba Division. In the 1950s he wrote the books &quot;An Introduction to Eastern Kamerun&quot;, published in 1956, and &quot;To the Nigeria People&quot;, published in 1958. After studying in West Germany, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Cameroon in 1961, and he became a member of the National Federal Assembly when the two Cameroons were united; he was re-elected in April 1964. On 14 February 1962, he was named Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and on 25 May 1965 he was named Minister of Labor. He served in the latter position until he was elected Secretary-General of the OAU during the 19th meeting of the Council of Ministers of the OAU on 15 June 1972 in Rabat, Morocco. He succeeded Diallo Telli of Guinea, who had served as Secretary-General of the OAU for 8 years.

Having fallen afoul of African leaders, Ekangaki resigned in 1974. Ahmadou Ahidjo, the President of Cameroon, was unhappy with both Ekangaki&#x27;s independent style at the OAU and his resignation. Back in Cameroon, Ahidjo sent Ekangaki to work as Technical Adviser at the Ministry of Territorial Administration, a very minor post for someone so prominent; Ekangaki remained there from 1974 to 1985. Subsequently Ekangaki worked at the Presidency as Adviser for Administrative Affairs under President Paul Biya from 1985 to 1989.

Ekangaki died at Yaoundé on 3 June 2005 and was buried in Nguti on 25 June.

<doc id="776697" wikidata="Q3905191" url="?curid=776697" title="Piney Woods">
<text>The Piney Woods is a temperate coniferous forest terrestrial ecoregion in the Southern United States covering of East Texas, southern Arkansas, western Louisiana, and southeastern Oklahoma. These coniferous forests are dominated by several species of pine as well as hardwoods including hickory and oak. Historically the most dense part of this forest region was the Big Thicket though the lumber industry dramatically reduced the forest concentration in this area and throughout the Piney Woods during the 19th and 20th centuries. The World Wide Fund for Nature considers the Piney Woods to be one of the critically endangered ecoregions of the United States. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines most of this ecoregion as the South Central Plains.

==Setting==
The Piney Woods cover a area of eastern Texas, northwestern Louisiana, southwestern Arkansas and the southeastern corner of Oklahoma. They are bounded on the east by the Mississippi lowland forests, on the south by the Western Gulf coastal grasslands, on the west by the East Central Texas forests and the Texas blackland prairies, on the northwest by the Central forest-grasslands transition, and on the north by the Ozark Mountain forests. They receive of precipitation annually.

==Flora==

The region has heavy to moderate rainfall, with some places receiving over of rain per year. Longleaf, shortleaf, and loblolly pines, along with bluejack and post oaks, dominate sandhills. A well-developed understory grows beneath the sparse canopy, and includes yaupon holly and flowering dogwood. Pine savannas consist of scattered longleaf and loblolly pines alongside black tupelos, sweetgums, and in acid soils along creeks sweetbay magnolias. Other common trees in this ecoregion include eastern redbud, river birch, red maple, southern sugar maple, and American elm. American wisteria, a vine, may cover groves of trees.

Two varieties of wetlands are common in the Piney Woods: bayous are generally found near rivers and sloughs are generally found near creeks. In bayous bald cypress, Spanish moss, and water lilies are common plants. Sloughs are shallow pools of standing water that most trees are not capable of growing in. Other species, such as the purple bladderwort, a small carnivorous plant, have found niches in sloughs. A baygall is another type of wetland found the Piney Woods and other forest of the Gulf Coast states in the USA.

Hardy species of prickly pear cactus and yucca can be found in the forests where deep sands occur. 

The indigenous Texas trailing phlox (&quot;Phlox nivalis texensis&quot;), an endangered species, grows in the sandy soils of longleaf pine forests.

Mammals: Common species in the Piney Woods include White-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;), Virginia opossum (&quot;Didelphis virginiana&quot;), northern raccoon (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;), striped skunk (&quot;Mephitis mephitis&quot;), eastern mole (&quot;Scalopus aquaticus&quot;), least shrew (&quot;Cryptotis parva&quot;), eastern gray squirrel (&quot;Sciurus carolinensis&quot;), eastern fox squirrel (&quot;Sciurus niger&quot;), and eastern cottontail (&quot;Sylvilagus floridanus&quot;). Somewhat less common are the northern river otter (&quot;Lontra canadensis&quot;), bobcat (&quot;Lynx rufus&quot;), gray fox (&quot;Urocyon cinereoargenteus&quot;), southern short-tailed shrew (&quot;Blarina carolinensis&quot;), North American beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;), and swamp rabbit (&quot;Sylvilagus aquaticus&quot;). Some carnivores such as the eastern spotted skunk (&quot;Spilogale putorius&quot;), ringtail (&quot;Bassariscus astutus&quot;), long-tailed weasel (&quot;Mustela frenata&quot;), American mink (&quot;Mustela vison&quot;), and red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), are uncommon, rarely seen, and in decline. Over a dozen species of bats occur in the region, some migratory like the Brazilian free-tailed bat (&quot;Tadarida brasiliensis&quot;) and silvered-haired bat (&quot;Lasionycteris noctivagans&quot;), others are year round residents like the Seminole bat (&quot;Lasiurus seminolus&quot;), evening bat (&quot;Nycticeius humeralis&quot;), Rafinesque&#x27;s big-eared bat (&quot;Corynorhinus rafinesquii&quot;), a threatened species in Texas. Rodents found in the Piney Woods include the southern flying squirrel (&quot;Glaucomys volans&quot;), common muskrat (&quot;Ondatra zibethicus&quot;), Baird&#x27;s pocket gopher (&quot;Geomys breviceps&quot;), woodland vole (&quot;Microtus pinetorum&quot;), and about 10 additional native rats and mice.

Several of the larger carnivores that once occurred in the Piney Woods are entirely extirpated, including the hog-nosed skunk (&quot;Conepatus leuconotus&quot;), red wolf (&quot;Canis rufus&quot;), jaguar (&quot;Panthera onca&quot;), and ocelot (&quot;Leopardus pardalis&quot;). The mountain lion (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;) and black bear (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;) have also been extirpated from most areas; however, very rare sightings or remains are occasionally documented, likely representing wandering individuals rather than breeding populations. Stable populations of black bears occur in adjacent areas north and east of the Piney Woods and they appear to be slowly increasing in numbers and dispersing. As of 2020, however, the black bear is largely extirpated from most quarters, and rare in peripheral areas. With the clearing of forest and decline of the native predators (or competitors), the nine-banded armadillo (&quot;Dasypus novemcinctus&quot;), coyotes (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;), and black-tailed jackrabbit (&quot;Lepus californicus&quot;) have expanded their ranges eastward into the region. Other species have been introduced into the region such as the nutria or coypu (&quot;Myocastor coypus&quot;), house mouse (&quot;Mus musculus&quot;), roof rat (&quot;Rattus rattus&quot;), and Norway rat (&quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;). Feral house cats (&quot;Felis catus&quot;) and feral pigs (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;) pose threats to native fauna and are serious conservation concerns.
Birds: With some species migrating through in the spring and fall, others nesting in the spring and summer months, and still others wintering in the region, well over 300 species of birds occur in the Piney Woods. A few of the many year round residents include the wood duck (&quot;Aix sponsa&quot;), black vulture (&quot;Coragyps atratus&quot;), red-shouldered hawk (&quot;Buteo lineatus&quot;), American kestrel (&quot;Falco sparverius&quot;), wild turkey (&quot;Meleagris gallopavo&quot;), northern bobwhite (&quot;Colinus virginianus&quot;), American woodcock (&quot;Scolopax minor&quot;), greater roadrunner (&quot;Geococcyx californianus&quot;), red-cockaded woodpecker (&quot;Picoides borealis&quot;), loggerhead shrike (&quot;Lanius ludovicianus&quot;), northern mockingbird (&quot;Mimus polyglottos&quot;), brown thrasher (&quot;Toxostoma rufum&quot;), Carolina chickadee (&quot;Poecile carolinensis&quot;), brown-headed nuthatch (&quot;Sitta pusilla&quot;), pine warbler (&quot;Dendroica pinus&quot;), Bachman&#x27;s sparrow (&quot;Aimophila aestivalis&quot;), and fish crow (&quot;Corvus ossifragus&quot;). Many additional species migrate from regions south and nest in the Piney Woods in the spring and summer, such as the anhinga (&quot;Anhinga anhinga&quot;), yellow-crowned night-heron (&quot;Nyctanassa violacea&quot;), little blue heron (&quot;Egretta caerulea&quot;), snowy egret (&quot;Egretta thula&quot;), purple gallinule (&quot;Porphyrula martinica&quot;), Chuck-will&#x27;s-widow (&quot;Caprimulgus carolinensis&quot;), scissor-tailed flycatcher (&quot;Tyrannus forficatus&quot;), prairie warbler (&quot;Dendroica discolor&quot;), Swainson&#x27;s warbler (&quot;Limnothlypis swainsonii&quot;), and painted bunting (&quot;Passerina ciris&quot;). Conversely, a different assemblage of birds migrate from the north to spend the winters months in the region, including the Canada goose (&quot;Branta canadensis&quot;), ring-necked duck (&quot;Aythya collaris&quot;), hooded merganser (&quot;Lophodytes cucullatus&quot;), blue-headed vireo (&quot;Vireo solitarius&quot;), Henslow&#x27;s sparrow (&quot;Ammodramus henslowii&quot;), Le Conte&#x27;s Sparrow (&quot;Ammodramus leconteii&quot;), and Smith&#x27;s longspur (&quot;Calcarius pictus&quot;). A few species that once occurred in the region are now extinct like the passenger pigeon (&quot;Ectopistes migratorius&quot;), Carolina parakeet (&quot;Conuropsis carolinensis&quot;), ivory-billed woodpecker (&quot;Campephilus principalis&quot;), and Bachman&#x27;s warbler (&quot;Vermivora bachmanii&quot;).
Reptiles: The American alligator (&quot;Alligator mississippiensis&quot;) ranges throughout all but the northwestern most area of the region, however they are not particularly common in the forested habitat compared to their abundance in the open marshlands and prairies to the south. The Sabine map turtle (&quot;Graptemys sabinensis&quot;) is endemic: and among the many other turtles found in the region are the alligator snapping turtle (&quot;Macrochelys temminckii&quot;), chicken turtle (&quot;Deirochelys reticularia&quot;), false map turtle (&quot;Graptemys pseudogeographica&quot;), river cooter (&quot;Pseudemys concinna&quot;), three-toed box turtle (&quot;Terrapene triunguis&quot;), eastern mud turtle (&quot;Kinosternon subrubrum&quot;), razor-backed musk turtle (&quot;Sternotherus carinatus&quot;), and spiny softshell turtle (&quot;Apalone spinifera&quot;). Lizards occurring in the Piney Woods include the green anole (&quot;Anolis carolinensis&quot;), six-lined racerunner (&quot;Aspidoscelis sexlineatus&quot;), prairie lizard (&quot;Sceloporus conssbrinus&quot;), slender glass lizard (&quot;Ophisaurus attenuatus&quot;), and a number of skinks including the five-lined skink (&quot;Plestiodon fasciatus&quot;), broad-headed skink (&quot;Plestiodon laticeps&quot;), southern coal skink (&quot;Plestiodon anthracinus&quot;), and little brown skink (&quot;Scincella lateralis&quot;). Snake diversity is relatively high in the Piney Woods for a temperate area of its size, with well over 30 species ranging into the region. The Louisiana pinesnake (&quot;Pituophis ruthveni&quot;) is endemic and Slowinski&#x27;s cornsnake (&quot;Pantherophis slowinskii&quot;) is nearly endemic. Five venomous snakes occur in the region, the Texas coralsnake (&quot;Micrurus tener&quot;), eastern copperhead (&quot;Agkistrodon contortrix&quot;), northern cottonmouth (&quot;Agkistrodon piscivorus&quot;), timber rattlesnake (&quot;Crotalus horridus&quot;), and pygmy rattlesnake (&quot;Sistrurus miliarius&quot;). Some of the non-venomous snakes include the rough greensnake (&quot;Opheodrys aestivus&quot;), Dekay&#x27;s brownsnake (&quot;Storeria dekayi&quot;), eastern hog-nosed snake (&quot;Heterodon platirhinos&quot;), western ribbonsnake (&quot;Thamnophis proximus&quot;), glossy swampsnake (&quot;Liodytes rigida&quot;), southern watersnake (&quot;Nerodia fasciata&quot;), diamond-back watersnake (&quot;Nerodia rhombifer&quot;), red-bellied mudsnake (&quot;Farancia abacura&quot;), North American racer (&quot;Coluber constrictor&quot;), coachwhip (&quot;Masticophis flagellum&quot;), scarletsnake (&quot;Cemophora coccinea&quot;), prairie kingsnake (&quot;Lampropeltis calligaster&quot;), speckled kingsnake (&quot;Lampropeltis holbrooki&quot;), western ratsnake (&quot;Pantherophis obsoletus&quot;). and at least a dozen others.
Amphibians: Over a dozen species of salamanders occur in the Piney Woods. The Louisiana slimy salamander (&quot;Plethodon kisatchie&quot;) of northern Louisiana and adjacent areas of southern Arkansas is endemic to the region. The three-toed amphiuma (&quot;Amphiuma tridactylum&quot;), commonly growing 18 to 30 inches (46-76 cm.), and other species such as the Gulf Coast waterdog (&quot;Necturus beyeri&quot;), Red River mudpuppy (&quot;Necturus louisianensis&quot;), and western lesser siren (&quot;Siren intermedia&quot;) are entirely aquatic. Other salamanders include the spotted salamander (&quot;Ambystoma maculatum&quot;), marbled salamander (&quot;Ambystoma opacum&quot;), mole salamander (&quot;Ambystoma talpoideum&quot;), small-mouthed salamander (&quot;Ambystoma texanum&quot;), spotted dusky salamander (&quot;Desmognathus conanti&quot;), western dwarf salamander (&quot;Eurycea paludicola&quot;), and the eastern newt (&quot;Notophthalmus viridescens&quot;). Anurans (frogs and toads) found in the Piney Woods include Blanchard&#x27;s cricket frog (&quot;Acris blanchardi&quot;), Cope&#x27;s gray treefrog (&quot;Hyla chrysoscelis&quot;), green treefrog (&quot;Hyla cinerea&quot;), cajun chorus frog (&quot;Pseudacris fouquettei&quot;), spring peeper (&quot;Pseudacris crucifer&quot;), eastern narrow-mouthed toad (&quot;Gastrophryne carolinensis&quot;), Hurter&#x27;s spadefoot toad (&quot;Scaphiopus hurterii&quot;), American bullfrog (&quot;Lithobates catesbeianus&quot;), bronze frog (&quot;Lithobates clamitans&quot;), pickerel frog (&quot;Lithobates palustris&quot;), and southern leopard frog (&quot;Lithobates sphenocephalus&quot;). The American toad (&quot;Anaxyrus americanus&quot;) occurs in northern areas and the Gulf Coast toad (&quot;Incilius nebulifer&quot;) occurs in the south. The Fowler&#x27;s toad (&quot;Anaxyrus fowleri&quot;) ranges throughout Arkansas and Louisiana, but populations in east Texas intergraded with Woodhouse&#x27;s toad (&quot;Anaxyrus woodhousii&quot;), however some regard the east Texas populations as a distinct species, the east Texas toad (&quot;Anaxyrus velatus&quot;).

Fish: The Piney Woods are rich in fish diversity. Fish occurring in the region include the chestnut lamprey (&quot;Ichthyomyzon castaneus&quot;), southern brook lamprey (&quot;Ichthyomyzon gagei&quot;), paddlefish (&quot;Polyodon spathula&quot;), alligator gar (&quot;Atractosteus spatula&quot;), spotted gar (&quot;Lepisosteus oculatus&quot;), bowfin (&quot;Amia calva&quot;), and redfin pickerel (&quot;Esox americanus&quot;). Some sport fish native to the Piney Woods include largemouth bass (&quot;Micropterus salmoides&quot;), spotted bass (&quot;Micropterus punctulatus&quot;), white bass (&quot;Morone chrysops&quot;), yellow bass (&quot;Morone mississippiensis&quot;), black crappie (&quot;Pomoxis nigromaculatus&quot;), white crappie (&quot;Pomoxis annularis&quot;), blue catfish (&quot;Ictalurus furcatus&quot;), channel catfish (&quot;Ictalurus punctatus&quot;), yellow bullhead (&quot;Ictalurus natalis&quot;), black bullhead (&quot;Ictalurus melas&quot;), redear sunfish (&quot;Lepomis microlophus&quot;), and longear sunfish (&quot;Lepomis megalotis&quot;). A multitude of smaller fish inhabit the waters of the Piney Woods. Endemics include the bluehead shiner (&quot;Pteronotropis hubbsi&quot;) and Creole darter (&quot;Etheostoma collettei&quot;). The western mosquitofish (&quot;Gambusia affinis&quot;), a species that has been widely introduced around the world and considered a pest in many areas, is a native in the Piney Woods. Just a few of the other small fish in the region include blacktail shiner (&quot;Cyprinella venusta&quot;), pallid shiner (&quot;Hybopsis amnis&quot;), blackspot shiner (&quot;Notropis atrocaudalis&quot;), peppered shiner (&quot;Notropis perpallidus&quot;), Sabine shiner (&quot;Notropis sabinae&quot;), weed shiner (&quot;Notropis texanus&quot;), blacktail redhorse (&quot;Moxostoma poecilurum&quot;), freckled madtom (&quot;Noturus nocturnus&quot;), brown madtom (&quot;Noturus phaeus&quot;), Blair&#x27;s starhead topminnow (&quot;Fundulus blairae&quot;), golden topminnow (&quot;Fundulus chrysotus&quot;), blachspotted topminnow (&quot;Fundulus olivaceus&quot;), bantma sunfish (&quot;Lepomis symmetricus&quot;), scaly sand darter (&quot;Ammocrypta vivax&quot;), redspot darter (&quot;Etheostoma artesiae&quot;), mud darter (&quot;Etheostoma asprigene&quot;), harlequin darter (&quot;Etheostoma histrio&quot;), and goldstripe darter (&quot;Etheostoma parvipinne&quot;).

Some endemic flora and fauna of the Piney Woods (threatened species: Federal++; State +: historical isolated Illinois population now extirpated = *).
== Level IV ecoregions ==
Within the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s ecoregions scheme, the Piney Woods are known as the South Central Plains, a Level III ecoregion. Within the South Central Plains, eight Level IV ecoregions are identified: Tertiary Uplands, Floodplains and Low Terraces, Pleistocene Fluvial Terraces, Cretaceous Dissected Uplands, Southern Tertiary Uplands, Flatwoods, Red River Bottomlands, and Blackland Prairie.
=== Tertiary Uplands (35a) ===
The rolling Tertiary Uplands, gently to moderately sloping, cover a large area in eastern Texas, southern Arkansas, and northern Louisiana. The rolling Tertiary Uplands are dominated by commercial pine plantations that have replaced the native oak–hickory–pine forest.

Ecoregion 35a is underlain by poorly-consolidated Tertiary sand, silt, and gravel; it lacks the Cretaceous, often calcareous rocks of the Cretaceous Dissected Uplands (35d) and the extensive Quaternary alluvium of Ecoregions 35b, 35g, and 73 (Mississippi Alluvial Plain). In eastern Texas and Louisiana, Tertiary deposits are mostly Eocene clays, silts, and sands, with some Paleocene sediments to the west. Soils are loamy, well-drained, thermic Ultisols or moderately drained Alfisols, typically with sandy and loamy surface textures.

In many areas of Ecoregion 35a, commercial pine plantations have replaced the native shortleaf pine–hardwood forest. Prominent native trees include shortleaf pine, loblolly pine, southern red oak, post oak, black oak, white oak, hickories, and sweetgum. American beautyberry, sumac, greenbriar, and hawthorn are common understory species. The sandier areas often have more bluejack oak, post oak, and stunted pines. Scattered, stunted, sandhill woodlands also occur. Grasses in the area include mid and tall grasses such as yellow Indian grass, pinehill bluestem, narrowleaf woodoats, and panicums.

The landscape is dissected by numerous small streams. Waters tend to be stained by organics, thus lowering water clarity and increasing total organic carbon and biochemical oxygen demand levels. Most streams have a sandy substrate and a forest canopy. Many do not flow during the summer or early fall. However, in sandhills, spring-fed, perennial streams occur; here, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, alkalinity, and hardness values are lower than elsewhere in the South Central Plains. Water quality in forested basins is better than in pastureland. Oil production has lowered stream quality in the south.

Timber production is the dominant land use, along with livestock grazing, poultry production, and oil and gas activities. Major settlements in the region include much of Little Rock; El Dorado, Arkansas; Texarkana; Ruston, Louisiana; and Longview, Tyler, and Nacogdoches in Texas. Protected areas include Caddo Lake National Wildlife Refuge, Poison Springs State Forest, much of Sabine National Forest, and Sabine Wildlife Management Area.

=== Floodplains and Low Terraces (35b) ===
The Floodplains and Low Terraces of Ecoregion 35 comprise the western margin of the southern bottomland hardwood communities that extend along the Gulf and Atlantic coastal plains from Texas to Virginia. Region 35b is nearly level, veneered by Holocene alluvium, and contains natural levees, swales, oxbow lakes, and meander scars. Longitudinal channel gradients are low and are less than in the Ouachita Mountains (ecoregion 36). Soils include Alfisols, Inceptisols, Vertisols, and Entisols and are generally somewhat poorly drained to very poorly drained, clayey and loamy.

Large parts of Ecoregion 35b are frequently flooded. Forested wetlands are characteristic, but pastureland also occurs. Cropland is far less common than in the Red River Bottomlands (35g). Active, meandering alluvial river channels are dynamic systems, with erosion and deposition reworking the topography of levees, ridges, and swales. Overbank flooding, subsurface groundwater, and local precipitation recharge water levels in backswamps, pools, sloughs, oxbows, and depressions of this floodplain region.

Potential natural vegetation is southern floodplain forest as in the Mississippi Alluvial Plain (ecoregion 73); it is unlike the oak–hickory–pine forest of the higher, better drained, and lithologically distinct Tertiary Uplands (35a) and Cretaceous Dissected Uplands (35d). Water oak, willow oak, sweetgum, blackgum, American elm, red maple, Southern red oak, swamp chestnut oak, and loblolly pine are typical. Understory flora include holly, grape genus, poison ivy, crossvine, greenbriar, and a variety of ferns and mosses. Bald cypress and water tupelo occur in semi-permanently flooded areas. Spanish moss hangs in these trees, and floating aquatic plants often occur. On wet flats, backswamps, and swamp margins that are seasonally flooded, overcup oak, water hickory, water elm, sweetgum, green ash, and red maple occur. River banks may contain black willow, sycamore, and eastern cottonwood. Wetness and flooding present severe limitations for agriculture. A few of the higher terraces may have some pasture, but most of the region has deciduous forest land cover. Silviculture activities range from selective tree removal to clearcutting to, in some areas, replacement with pine monoculture. Reservoirs have inundated large areas of this habitat and have altered downstream hydrology. The bottomland forests provide important wildlife habitat with a high diversity of species.

Settlements of the Floodplains and Low Terraces include parts of Beaumont and Lake Charles; typically these narrow and wet regions are less developed. Protected areas include Pond Creek National Wildlife Refuge, Little River National Wildlife Refuge, Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge, Upper Ouachita National Wildlife Refuge, Sabine Island Wildlife Management Area, and Trinity River National Wildlife Refuge.

=== Pleistocene Fluvial Terraces (35c) ===
The Pleistocene Fluvial Terraces are nearly level, poorly-drained, periodically wet, underlain by Pleistocene unconsolidated terrace deposits, and often covered by pine–hardwood flatwoods. The broad flats and gently sloping stream terraces are lower and less dissected than the Tertiary Uplands (35a), but higher than the floodplains of 35b and 35g. Soils are typically well to poorly drained Alfisols and Ultisols with loamy and sandy surfaces. Loblolly pine and oaks are common and are adapted to the prevailing hydroxeric regime; pastureland and hayland are less extensive.

A vertical sequence of terraces occurs. The lowest terrace is nearly flat, clayey, and has extensive hardwood wetlands. Higher terraces become progressively older and more dissected; they are dominated by pine flatwoods, pine savanna, prairie, or a mixed forest of pine and oak; flatwood wetlands are less extensive than on the lowest terrace. The mid-level terrace is veneered with windblown silt deposits (loess). Streams tend to be mildly acidic and stained by organic matter. They have more suspended solids, greater turbidity, and higher hardness values than the Tertiary Uplands (35a).

The southernmost piece of 35c, around Marksville, Louisiana, is a Pleistocene terrace with some similarities in soils and historical natural vegetation to that of the Lafayette Loess Plains (34j). The prairie has been converted to agriculture. Terraces are less extensive in Texas and Oklahoma, occurring mostly along the Red River, with some smaller terraces along the Sulphur River. In Texas, current land cover is mostly pine–hardwood forest, with post oak, Shumard oak, and eastern redcedar woods to the west. In Arkansas, loblolly pine is more common on the terraces than shortleaf pine, perhaps influenced by the seasonal wet-dry regime.

Settlements include White Hall, Arkansas; much of Pine Bluff, Arkansas; Sparkman, Arkansas; East Camden, Arkansas; Bastrop, Louisiana; Hermitage, Arkansas; Minden, Louisiana, and Ashdown, Arkansas. Protected areas include Cane Creek State Park, Seven Devils Wildlife Management Area (WMA), Crossett Experimental Forest WMA, and Lafayette WMA (Arkansas).

=== Cretaceous Dissected Uplands (35d) ===
The nearly level to hilly Cretaceous Dissected Uplands ecoregion has a greater drainage density than other parts of the South Central Plains.

Native vegetation is largely oak–hickory–pine forest. Today, woods and pastureland are common. Water quality in forested watersheds tends to be good, and is better than in pastureland. Streams generally have lower total dissolved solids values and much lower total organic carbon values than the Tertiary Uplands (35a) and Pleistocene Fluvial Terraces (35c), although turbidity, total suspended solids, and hardness values are slightly higher. Longitudinal stream gradients and Ouachita Mountain influences are greater than in ecoregions 35a or 35c.

Water quality in forested watersheds tends to be good, and is better than downstream of pastureland. Surface waters usually have lower total organic carbon values and slightly higher turbidity, total suspended solids, and hardness values than the Pleistocene Fluvial Terraces (35c). Streams lying in the Muddy Boggy Creek and Blue River watersheds often originate in, and share many aquatic species with, the Arbuckle Uplift (29g); alkalinity, hardness, and conductivity values are influenced by local springs, and increase westward. Streams in the eastern part of the Cretaceous Dissected Uplands drain the more rugged, lithologically distinct Ouachita Mountains (ecoregion 36); aquatic flora and fauna assemblages are influenced by the Ouachitas and are distinct from western streams.

Settlements include (in Arkansas) Arkadelphia; Hope; Lockesburg; (in Oklahoma) Hugo; Bennington; and Caney. Protected areas include Crater of Diamonds State Park, some portions of Ouachita National Forest, and Boggy Depot Park.

=== Southern Tertiary Uplands (35e) ===
The Southern Tertiary Uplands ecoregion of Texas and Louisiana generally covers the remainder of longleaf pine range north of the Flatwoods (35f) on Tertiary sediments. The region of Tertiary geology is more hilly and dissected than the Flatwoods (35f) to the south, and soils are generally better drained over the more permeable sediments. Soils are Ultisols and Alfisols with silt loam to loamy sand textures. The Pliocene-age to Eocene-age geology contains a variety of siltstones, sandstones, and calcareous and acidic clays.

Historical vegetation was dominated by longleaf pine–bluestem woodlands, but a variety of forest types were present, including shortleaf pine–hardwood forests, mixed hardwood–loblolly pine forests, and hardwood-dominated forests along streams. On more mesic sites, some American beech or magnolia–beech–loblolly pine forests occurred. Some small, scattered prairies with many rare plants are associated with areas of calcareous clay soils. Some sandstone outcrops of the Catahoula Formation have distinctive barrens or glades in Texas and Louisiana that contain several rare species. Forested seeps in sand hills support acid bog species including southern sweetbay, hollies, wax-myrtles, fetterbush, insectivorous plants, orchids, and wild azalea; this vegetation becomes more extensive in the Flatwoods (35f). Currently, the ecoregion in Texas and Louisiana has more pine forest than the oak–pine and pasture land cover more typical to the north in the Tertiary Uplands (35a). Large parts of the region are public National Forest land, such as Kisatchie National Forest. The Southern Tertiary Uplands ecoregion also covers the majority of Louisiana&#x27;s longleaf pine range west of the Mississippi River.

Settlements include (in Louisiana) Chatham; Clarks; Jena; Pineville; Leesville; (in Texas) Jasper; Lufkin; and Conroe. Protected areas include Jimmie Davis State Park, Big Cypress State Park, Esler Field Wildlife Management Area (WMA), Kisatchie National Forest (four large tracts), Alexander State Forest, Fort Johnson North Wildlife Management Area (WMA), Clear Creek WMA, the southern portion of Sabine National Forest, Angelina National Forest and Bannister WMA, Davy Crockett National Forest, and Sam Houston National Forest.

=== Flatwoods (35f) ===
The Flatwoods ecoregion occurs on mostly flat to gently sloping Pleistocene sediments. The northern boundary is generally along the Hockley Scarp or the division between Pleistocene and older Pliocene/Miocene formations to the north. Soils are poorly to moderately well drained Alfisols and Ultisols with mostly silt loam textures. They are generally more poorly drained than many areas of the Southern Tertiary Uplands (35e) to the north, and tend to be less clayey than in the Southern Subhumid Gulf Coastal Prairies (34b) and Northern Humid Gulf Coastal Prairies (34a) to the south.

This ecoregion once was dominated by longleaf pine flatwoods and savannas, but also supported other mixed pine–hardwood forest types. The longleaf pine community was characterized by longleaf pine over a great diversity of herbaceous species, with the structure and composition varying from the more open forests of the wet savannas to the more closed forests of the dry flatwoods. Savanna wetlands on the Montgomery Formation and prairie areas on the Beaumont Formation were most likely larger in the Flatwoods than in the Southern Tertiary Uplands (35e) and Tertiary Uplands (35a) to the north. The pine wetland savannas had scattered longleaf pine along with shrubs of sweetbay, wax myrtle, titi, and holly, and a diverse herbaceous layer of grasses, sedges, and, in some places, insectivorous plants and orchids. These wetland savannas are one of the rarest habitat types in Texas with only a few small fragments receiving any protected status. Other similar sites have been greatly modified or have become overgrown and less diverse.

Flatwood landscapes are characterized by pimple mounds, small hillocks that are abundant across the flats. On steep slopes, along streams and other areas where fire was less frequent, forests contained loblolly pine, sweetgum, white oak, southern red oak, willow oak, blackgum, and hollies. Although greatly reduced from its original extent, longleaf pine continues to characterize a significant portion of the area. Beech–magnolia was not extensive, occurring in narrow areas along some streams and mesic slopes.

This region is warmer, wetter, flatter, less dissected, and lower in elevation than the Tertiary Uplands (35a) and Southern Tertiary Uplands (35e) to the north, with a greater presettlement fire frequency. Streams are low gradient and sluggish. In the eastern part of the region near the boundary with the Red River Bottomlands (35g), more loess occurs, the landscape becomes more dissected, and it supports a mixed hardwood–pine forest. Almost all of the Big Thicket National Preserve is within this region. The area has a long history of modification, particularly by the lumber, railroad, and oil and gas industries that contributed to boom and bust cycles of development and occupance.

Settlements include (in Louisiana) Moss Bluff; DeRidder; (in Texas) Lumberton; Atascocita; Humble; and The Woodlands. Protected areas include Chicot State Park, Marsh Bayou Wildlife Management Area (WMA), West Bay WMA, Big Thicket National Preserve, and Kirby State Forest.

=== Red River Bottomlands (35g) ===
The Red River Bottomlands contain the floodplain and low terraces of the Red River within the South Central Plains (ecoregion 35). The region occurs in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana, and includes the highly meandering main channel of the Red River, oxbow lakes, meander scars, ridges, and backswamps.

The Holocene alluvium associated with Red River deposition developed well to somewhat poorly drained Vertisols and Entisols with clayey and loamy, reddish-brown, neutral to calcareous surfaces. The lithology contrasts with the Pleistocene terrace deposits of Pleistocene Fluvial Terraces (35c), and the Tertiary sediments of the Tertiary Uplands (35a). Natural vegetation of the bottomland hardwood forests included trees such as water oak, sweetgum, willow oak, southern red oak, Nutall oak, honey locust, water locust, eastern red cedar, blackgum, blackjack oak, overcup oak, river birch, red maple, green ash, and American elm. There are also some plant distribution differences between the floodplains of ecoregions 35g and 35b. Western species, such as bur oak and Durand oak, were native to the Red River Bottomlands but were typically absent from the Mississippi Alluvial Plain (ecoregion 73).

Currently in the Red River Bottomlands, most of its natural woodland has been cleared for cropland and improved pasture, although some woodland still occurs in very poorly drained and frequently flooded areas. The broad, nearly level bottomlands are often dominated by agriculture, with more cropland than other floodplains of the South Central Plains (ecoregion 35). In Oklahoma, The main crops are soybeans, grain sorghum, alfalfa, corn, and wheat; In Texas, soybeans, sorghum, wheat, and cotton; and in Louisiana, cotton, soybeans, corn, wheat, and rice, with some sugarcane in the southern portion. The Red River carries high silt loads and is almost continuously turbid compared to other rivers of the South Central Plains, although silt load has lessened in Louisiana with the construction of the river&#x27;s lock and dam system.

The Red River historically carried high silt loads and was almost continuously turbid compared to other rivers of Ecoregion 35. With the construction of the lock and dam system throughout its extent in Louisiana, silt load has lessened. The Louisiana portion of the Red River Bottomlands shares similarities in natural vegetation and other biota, hydrology, and land uses with parts of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain (ecoregion 73).

Settlements, all in Louisiana, include Shreveport; the eastern part of Natchitoches; Alexandria; Cheneyville; and Bunkie. Protected areas include Spring Bank Wildlife Management Area (WMA), Soda Lake WMA, John Franks WMA, Red River National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), Loggy Bayou WMA, Bayou Pierre WMA, Elbow Slough WMA, Grand Cote NWR, Lake Ophelia NWR, and the Acadiana Conservation Corridor.

=== Blackland Prairie (35h) ===
The level to rolling Blackland Prairie characteristically has dark soils derived from underlying Cretaceous marl, chalk, and limestone. Prairie was common or dominant during and shortly after the Hypsithermal Period in the middle of the Holocene Epoch. By the late 18th century, the Blackland Prairie was a mosaic of woodland, savanna, and prairies. Today, the fertile soils of the Blackland Prairie are mostly used for pastureland, woodland, and hayland.

<text>In physics, a unified field theory (UFT) is a type of field theory that allows all fundamental forces and elementary particles to be written in terms of a single type of field. According to modern discoveries in physics, forces are not transmitted directly between interacting objects but instead are described and interpreted by intermediary entities called fields. Furthermore, according to quantum field theory, particles are themselves the quanta of fields. Examples of different fields in physics include vector fields such as the electromagnetic field, spinor fields whose quanta are fermionic particles such as electrons, and tensor fields such as the metric tensor field that describes the shape of spacetime and gives rise to gravitation in general relativity. Unified field theory attempts to organize these fields into a single mathematical structure.

For over a century, unified field theory has remained an open line of research. The term was coined by Albert Einstein, who attempted to unify his general theory of relativity with electromagnetism. Einstein attempted to create a classical unified field theory, rejecting quantum mechanics. Among other difficulties, this required a new explanation of particles as singularities or solitons instead of field quanta. Later attempts to unify general relativity with other forces incorporate quantum mechanics. The concept of a &quot;Theory of Everything&quot; or Grand Unified Theory are closely related to unified field theory, but differ by not requiring the basis of nature to be fields, and often by attempting to explain physical constants of nature. Additionally, Grand Unified Theories do not attempt to include the gravitational force and can therefore operate entirely within quantum field theory.

The goal of a unified field theory has led to a great deal of progress in theoretical physics.

== Introduction ==

Unified field theory attempts to give a single elegant description of the following fields:

=== Forces ===

All four of the known fundamental forces are mediated by fields. In the Standard Model of particle physics, three of these result from the exchange of gauge bosons. These are:
*Strong interaction: the interaction responsible for holding quarks together to form hadrons, and holding neutrons and also protons together to form atomic nuclei. The exchange particle that mediates this force is the gluon.
*Electromagnetic interaction: the familiar interaction that acts on electrically charged particles. The photon is the exchange particle for this force.
*Weak interaction: a short-range interaction responsible for some forms of radioactivity, that acts on electrons, neutrinos, and quarks. It is mediated by the W and Z bosons.

General relativity likewise describes gravitation as the result of the metric tensor field, which describes the shape of spacetime:
*Gravitational interaction: a long-range attractive interaction that acts on &quot;all&quot; particles. In hypothetical quantum versions of GR, the postulated exchange particle has been named the graviton.

=== Matter ===

In the Standard Model, the &quot;matter&quot; particles (electrons, quarks, neutrinos, etc) are described as the quanta of spinor fields. Gauge boson fields also have quanta, such as photons for the electromagnetic field.

=== Higgs ===

The Standard Model has a unique fundamental scalar field, the Higgs field, the quanta of which are called Higgs bosons.

== History ==
=== Classic theory ===
The first successful classical unified field theory was developed by James Clerk Maxwell. In 1820, Hans Christian Ørsted discovered that electric currents exerted forces on magnets, while in 1831, Michael Faraday made the observation that time-varying magnetic fields could induce electric currents. Until then, electricity and magnetism had been thought of as unrelated phenomena. In 1864, Maxwell published his famous paper on a dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field. This was the first example of a theory that was able to encompass previously separate field theories (namely electricity and magnetism) to provide a unifying theory of electromagnetism. By 1905, Albert Einstein had used the constancy of the speed-of-light in Maxwell&#x27;s theory to unify our notions of space and time into an entity we now call spacetime. In 1915, he expanded this theory of special relativity to a description of gravity, general relativity, using a field to describe the curving geometry of four-dimensional (4D) spacetime.

In the years following the creation of the general theory, a large number of physicists and mathematicians enthusiastically participated in the attempt to unify the then-known fundamental interactions. Given later developments in this domain, of particular interest are the theories of Hermann Weyl of 1919, who introduced the concept of an (electromagnetic) gauge field in a classical field theory and, two years later, that of Theodor Kaluza, who extended General Relativity to five dimensions. Continuing in this latter direction, Oscar Klein proposed in 1926 that the fourth spatial dimension be curled up into a small, unobserved circle. In Kaluza–Klein theory, the gravitational curvature of the extra spatial direction behaves as an additional force similar to electromagnetism. These and other models of electromagnetism and gravity were pursued by Albert Einstein in his attempts at a classical unified field theory. By 1930 Einstein had already considered the Einstein-Maxwell–Dirac System [Dongen]. This system is (heuristically) the super-classical [Varadarajan] limit of (the not mathematically well-defined) quantum electrodynamics. One can extend this system to include the weak and strong nuclear forces to get the Einstein–Yang-Mills–Dirac System. The French physicist Marie-Antoinette Tonnelat published a paper in the early 1940s on the standard commutation relations for the quantized spin-2 field. She continued this work in collaboration with Erwin Schrödinger after World War II. In the 1960s Mendel Sachs proposed a generally covariant field theory that did not require recourse to renormalization or perturbation theory. In 1965, Tonnelat published a book on the state of research on unified field theories.

=== Modern progress ===
In 1963, American physicist Sheldon Glashow proposed that the weak nuclear force, electricity, and magnetism could arise from a partially unified electroweak theory. In 1967, Pakistani Abdus Salam and American Steven Weinberg independently revised Glashow&#x27;s theory by having the masses for the W particle and Z particle arise through spontaneous symmetry breaking with the Higgs mechanism. This unified theory modelled the electroweak interaction as a force mediated by four particles: the photon for the electromagnetic aspect, a neutral Z particle, and two charged W particles for the weak aspect. As a result of the spontaneous symmetry breaking, the weak force becomes short-range and the W and Z bosons acquire masses of 80.4 and , respectively. Their theory was first given experimental support by the discovery of weak neutral currents in 1973. In 1983, the Z and W bosons were first produced at CERN by Carlo Rubbia&#x27;s team. For their insights, Glashow, Salam, and Weinberg were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979. Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer received the Prize in 1984.

After Gerardus &#x27;t Hooft showed the Glashow–Weinberg–Salam electroweak interactions to be mathematically consistent, the electroweak theory became a template for further attempts at unifying forces. In 1974, Sheldon Glashow and Howard Georgi proposed unifying the strong and electroweak interactions into the Georgi–Glashow model, the first Grand Unified Theory, which would have observable effects for energies much above 100 GeV.

Since then there have been several proposals for Grand Unified Theories, e.g. the Pati–Salam model, although none is currently universally accepted. A major problem for experimental tests of such theories is the energy scale involved, which is well beyond the reach of current accelerators. Grand Unified Theories make predictions for the relative strengths of the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces, and in 1991 LEP determined that supersymmetric theories have the correct ratio of couplings for a Georgi–Glashow Grand Unified Theory.

Many Grand Unified Theories (but not Pati–Salam) predict that the proton can decay, and if this were to be seen, details of the decay products could give hints at more aspects of the Grand Unified Theory. It is at present unknown if the proton can decay, although experiments have determined a lower bound of 1035 years for its lifetime.

=== Current status ===

Theoretical physicists have not yet formulated a widely accepted, consistent theory that combines general relativity and quantum mechanics to form a theory of everything. Trying to combine the graviton with the strong and electroweak interactions leads to fundamental difficulties and the resulting theory is not renormalizable. The incompatibility of the two theories remains an outstanding problem in the field of physics.

<text>Carl Gustaf Ekman (6 October 1872 – 15 June 1945) was a Swedish politician. He was a Member of Parliament from 1911 to 1932 (serving in both lower and upper houses), leader of the Freeminded People&#x27;s Party between 1924 and 1932, and served as Prime Minister from 1926 to 1928 and again from 1930 to 1932.

==Biography==
Carl Gustaf Ekman was born in Munktorp (now Köping Municipality) in Västmanland County, to farmer and soldier Carl Ekman and Josefina Säfström. He began working at the age of twelve as a farmhand, read everything he could get his hands on, and was entrusted with duties inside the temperance movement, where he became a functionary. He was promoted to director of the Friends of the Temperance Movement&#x27;s disability and burial fund in the industrial town of Eskilstuna. In 1908 he was appointed as chief editor of the liberal newspaper &quot;Eskiltuna-Kuriren&quot;. His attempt to be elected to the Riksdag failed because of the domination of the Social Democrats in Eskiltuna, but in 1911 the Liberal Party gave him a seat in the upper house for the county of Gävleborg. He quickly established himself as the country&#x27;s leading proponent of total prohibition of alcohol. In 1913 he moved to Stockholm, and quickly won a seat representing the city in the Riksdag.

Ekman became the most influential and controversial politician of the 1920s. Among Social Democrats he was regarded as a &quot;class traitor&quot;, having come from a working-class background, but having become a member of a non-socialist party. He was in fact behind the downfall of several Social Democrat governments: Hjalmar Branting&#x27;s in 1923, Rickard Sandler&#x27;s in 1926, but also that of Arvid Lindman in 1930. In 1924 Ekman became the leader of the newly formed Freeminded People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Frisinnade folkpartiet&quot;), after those Liberals opposed to prohibition had departed to form the Liberal Party of Sweden.

As party leader he worked to strengthen the party&#x27;s influence by cooperating with both the right and left. His strategy for power was based on controlling the political center in order to &#x27;control the game&#x27;, this being predicated upon no one bloc having a clear majority in the Riksdag.

After Sandler&#x27;s fall from power in 1926, Ekman became Prime Minister for the first time. He was able to play the right off against the left by appealing to both and by doing so he became more successful than expected. He resolved an old debate on local taxes with a law on proportional taxation, which is still in effect to this day. He also concluded a sweeping reform of the school system. In the 1928 elections the conservative General Electoral League won, and he was forced to give up power to Arvid Lindman.

Ekman returned as Prime Minister in 1930, when he and Per Albin Hansson defeated the government&#x27;s proposal to raise tariffs on grain. His second period as Prime Minister was difficult; the international depression that had begun after the Wall Street crash of 1929 reached Sweden, affecting both industry and agriculture. Ekman&#x27;s traditional attitude of thriftiness made it difficult for him to accept economic-stimulation programs that would involve heavy public spending. 
In addition to this, a debate began after the Kreuger Crash about political contributions from Ivar Kreuger which Ekman had personally accepted on behalf of his party. At first Ekman denied having received any such money, but in the end the public debate forced him to resign from office a month before the Riksdag election of 1932, which resulted in a great defeat for the Freeminded People&#x27;s Party. Ekman never returned to politics. Less than two years after his resignation, his party was also gone; it merged with the Liberal Party to form the Liberal People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Folkpartiet liberalerna&quot;). Not even his enemies thought that he had actually taken money for himself; nevertheless his conflicting statements on the matter enabled others to cast suspicion on him, so that a formidable political opponent could be removed.

Ekman&#x27;s legacy has been colored to a great extent by his political maneuvering as well as by the scandal leading to his resignation; this does not do justice to his result-oriented policies during an anxious period when no lasting political majority could be formed. He died in Stockholm on 15 June 1945.

He was married to Laura Ekman (&quot;née&quot; Widlund), with whom he had four children.

<doc id="776726" wikidata="Q1285643" url="?curid=776726" title="Edmond Hoyle">
<text>Edmond Hoyle (167229 August 1769) was an English writer best known for his works on the rules and play of card games. The phrase &quot;according to Hoyle&quot; (meaning &quot;strictly according to the rules&quot;) came into the language as a reflection of his broadly perceived authority on the subject; use of the phrase has since expanded to any appeal to a putative authority.

==Life==
Little is known about Hoyle&#x27;s early life prior to publication of his books. Much of what is written about him is untrue or exaggerated. The suggestion that he trained at the bar is not known to be true. 

Hoyle died at age 97 on 29 August 1769 on Wellbank Street (today Welbeck Street), Cavendish Square, London.

==Treatise on whist==
By 1741, Hoyle began to tutor members of high society at the game of whist, selling his students a copy of his manuscript notes. Hoyle expanded the manuscript and published &quot;A Short Treatise on the Game of Whist&quot; in 1742, selling it for the high price of one guinea. When the book quickly sold out, rather than publish a new edition, Hoyle sold the rights to it to bookseller Francis Cogan for 100 guineas, an enormous sum for a small pamphlet. Before Cogan was able to publish a second edition, two printers pirated the work, giving the author as &quot;A Gentleman&quot; rather than Hoyle. The printers disguised their identities by publishing under false names, one as Webster, the other as Webb. Cogan published second and third editions and two months later, obtained an injunction against the pirates which he announced in a fourth edition (all 1743). To distinguish the genuine editions from the piracies, Cogan paid Hoyle two pence per copy to autograph the genuine works. The piracies were profitable to Hoyle, though a disaster for Cogan who was forced to lower the price of the book to match the pirates and to pay for Hoyle&#x27;s signature.

===Superseded by new rules===
The rules of whist published in &quot;A Short Treatise on the Game of Whist&quot; were regarded as authoritative until 1864, after which time they were superseded by the new rules written by John Loraine Baldwin and adopted by the Arlington and Portland clubs.

==Other published works==

Cogan published other works by Hoyle: &quot;A Short Treatise on the Game of Backgammon&quot; (1743), &quot;An Artificial Memory for Whist&quot; (1744), and more short treatises on the games of piquet and chess (1744) and quadrille (1744).
Cogan became bankrupt in 1745 and sold the Hoyle copyrights to Thomas Osborne, who published Hoyle&#x27;s treatises with much more success.

Hoyle wrote a treatise on the game of brag (1751), a book on probability theory (1754), and one on chess (1761). Over time, Hoyle&#x27;s work pushed off the market Charles Cotton&#x27;s ageing &quot;The Compleat Gamester&quot;, which had been considered the &quot;standard&quot; English-language reference work on the playing of games – especially gambling games – since its publication in 1674.

===Collected edition===
In 1748, Osborne stopped publishing the individual treatises and instead sold a collected edition under the title &quot;Mr. Hoyle&#x27;s Treatises of Whist, Quadrille, Piquet, Chess and Back-Gammon&quot;. The whist treatise was described as the eighth edition. The fourteenth edition (1765) was the last published during Hoyle&#x27;s lifetime. Fifteenth and sixteenth editions appeared after his death, with the autograph reproduced by woodblock print.

===Reprints===
The books were frequently reprinted in Ireland, something that was permitted as the English copyright statute, the Statute of Anne, did not extend to Ireland. One edition was printed in Edinburgh. Hoyle&#x27;s writing was translated into many continental languages; first Portuguese (1753), then German (1754), French (1761), Italian (1768), Russian (1769), and Dutch (1790).

Various facsimile and revised editions have appeared over the decades and centuries, often titled &quot;Hoyle&#x27;s Rules&quot; or &quot;Hoyle&#x27;s Games&quot; in English.

==Legacy and modern usage==
Because of his contributions to gaming, Hoyle was a charter inductee into the Poker Hall of Fame in 1979, even though he died 60 years before poker was invented.

The phrase &quot;according to Hoyle&quot; retains some currency in contemporary English, indicating &#x27;correctly or properly; according to an authority or rule&#x27;. In American English, &quot;a Hoyle&quot; can refer to any authoritative card-game rule book, in the same way that &quot;a Baedeker&quot; can refer to any travel guide.

Many modern books of collected rule sets for card games (and sometimes other games, such as board games, billiards, etc.) contain the name &quot;Hoyle&quot; in their titles, but the moniker does not mean the works are directly derivative of Edmond Hoyle&#x27;s (in much the same way that many modern dictionaries contain &quot;Webster&quot; in their titles without necessarily relating to the work of Noah Webster).

<text>Alphabet of Thorn is a 2004 fantasy novel written by American author Patricia A. McKillip. It was nominated for the 2005 Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature.

== Plot summary ==
Nepenthe is a sixteen-year-old orphan who was found and raised by the Royal Librarians of Raine. During the new queen&#x27;s coronation, visitors and ambassadors from the Twelve Crowns (domains) that comprise Raine gauge Queen Tessera&#x27;s strength. Bourne of Seale, a junior mage from the Floating School, meets Nepenthe in the library with a book inscribed with an unknown language, which seems to be written in configurations of plant thorns. Instead of delivering it to the Master Librarians, Nepenthe decides to transcribe it herself; she soon becomes obsessed with learning the book&#x27;s outcome. On the surface, it appears to be an epic poem documenting the conquests of Axis and Kane, an emperor and &quot;the Hooded One&quot;, three thousand years earlier.

As Nepenthe continues reading, the ruler of Seale prepares to usurp the throne from Tessera, whom he views as weak. (She is only fourteen years old.) Reading further as Seale&#x27;s army marches (and Bourne is imprisoned for treason), Nepenthe learns that Axis and Kane traveled through time to expand the reach and strength of Axis&#x27; empire. Popular histories in Raine list the man Kane as Axis&#x27; court mage; Kane was, but the &quot;woman&quot; Kane was also his lover who opened the Gates of Time for him. Kane became pregnant with his child, and she traveled with the infant through time to a cliff side near Raine. She wrote a book about her life in the language of thorns and because of her enchantments, no one but her daughter could read it—by the book&#x27;s climax, she has. The final words of the book open the Gates of Time that admit Axis and Kane, Nepenthe&#x27;s parents, and their uncountable legions of followers near Raine, three thousand years in their future.

When Queen Tessera learns of the planned invasion, with the help of Vevay, her own mage, and the magicians of the Floating School, she uses magic to make Raine seem a dilapidated ruin and thereby protect it from Axis. Nepenthe meets her mother and refuses Kane&#x27;s offer to rule Raine, because it would require Nepenthe to turn her back on the only world she&#x27;s ever known. Kane chooses to remain in Raine, where she can be with her daughter and won&#x27;t have to hide her identity. This effectively stops Axis&#x27; conquests because without her; he can&#x27;t travel through the Gates of Time. The forces of Seale see Axis&#x27;s army retreat in fear, which strengthens Tessera&#x27;s claim on the throne. Kane stays with her daughter, and Nepenthe remains in the Royal Library, the only life she ever wants to know.

==Literary significance and reception==
The Magill Book Review said in their 2004 review that &quot;Reading Patricia A. McKillip&#x27;s novels is itself like being drawn into a faraway world thick with magic. The intricate style weaves a tapestry whose extra dimensions reveal themselves only gradually.&quot; Publishers Weekly praised the female leads saying &quot;Best of all, the strong female leads neither rail against nor submit to patriarchy. In this magical world blissfully free of bias, people are simply themselves, equally intelligent and witty and thoroughly capable while prone to the occasional error, in a manner that transcends feminism and becomes a celebration of essential humanity.&quot;
