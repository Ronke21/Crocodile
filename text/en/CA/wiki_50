<text>Raft Island is a private island and CDP located near the Pierce County community of Rosedale, Washington, United States. Gig Harbor, Washington is the nearest incorporated town, although unincorporated Artondale is much closer. The island features approximately 200 homes on 160 acres. All of these homes are served through the Gig Harbor post office.

Raft Island contains parks, roads, several private beaches, a private tennis court, private boat launch, and a church camp. Because of its picturesque setting, Raft Island has been the subject of many artistic pursuits. The island is connected to the mainland by a -long bridge.

Raft Island size varies between 160 and 201 acres (813,910 m²) in area depending on high or low tide, and is oval in shape. It is located in Henderson Bay within Puget Sound.

According to Edmond S. Meany, Raft Island was probably named from its appearance. In 1841 Charles Wilkes of the United States Exploring Expedition gave it the name &quot;Allshouse Island&quot;, probably for Joseph Allshouse, a member of his crew.

<text>Kristijonas Donelaitis (; 1 January 1714 – 18 February 1780) was a Prussian Lithuanian poet and Lutheran pastor. He lived and worked in Lithuania Minor, a territory in the Kingdom of Prussia, that had a sizable Lithuanian-speaking minority. He wrote the first classic Lithuanian language poem, &quot;The Seasons&quot; (), which became one of the principal works of Lithuanian poetry. The poem, a classic work of Lithuanian literature, depicts everyday life of Lithuanian peasants, their struggle with serfdom, and the annual cycle of life.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Donelaitis was born at Lasdinehlen estate (now Gusevsky District) near Gumbinnen, Prussia. His parents were free peasants who owned the land that they cultivated. His father died in 1720, leaving seven children (four sons and three daughters). One of his three brothers, Friedrich, became a goldsmith in Königsberg. Another brother, Michael, inherited the father&#x27;s farm. His third brother, Adam, became a blacksmith and innkeeper.

In 1731, Donelaitis began attending the cathedral school in Kneiphof, a section of Königsberg. He lived in a pauper&#x27;s dormitory and often went hungry for days. After graduation, he received a scholarship in 1736 to study at the University of Königsberg. For four years he studied Lutheran theology. His world view was shaped by the classical curriculum, required Lithuanian studies, and the Pietism movement. He learned Greek, Latin, French, and Hebrew languages, and studied the writings of classical authors such as Homer, Hesiod, Horace, and Virgil. After graduation, he was appointed as a cantor in Stallupönen. After the school rector died, Donelaitis took over his position. In 1743, he passed the required examination to become a pastor in Tollmingkehmen.

===Life in Tollmingkehmen===

Donelaitis lived in Tollmingkehmen from 1743 until his death in 1780. At the time, the parish of Tollmingkehmen had around 30 villages with around 3,000 residents. The population was about two-thirds German and one-third Lithuanian. In 1744, Donelaitis married Anna Regina Ohlefant, widow of the school rector in Stallupönen. In 1747, he worked to restore the rectory, and built a new brick church in 1756. In 1757, during the Seven Years&#x27; War, Donelaitis and his parishioners retreated to the Romincka Forest to hide from the advancing Imperial Russian Army. When he returned to the town, Donelaitis refused to preach praises to the Russian Tsar. After the war he rebuilt a burned school and sponsored construction of a shelter for widows. His hobbies included building thermometers and barometers, and constructing pianos and clavichords. He died, aged 66, in Tollmingkehmen, East Prussia.

==Works==

None of Donelaitis&#x27;s works were published during his lifetime. Donelaitis wrote at least three poems in the German language (&quot;An der Amstrath Donalitius nach dem Verlust seiner Gattin&quot;, &quot;Der Gott der Finsterniss&quot;, and &quot;Unschuld sei mein ganzes Leben&quot;). His Lithuanian works consist of six fables and the poem &quot;The Seasons&quot;. Donelaitis&#x27;s publisher, Ludwig Rhesa, believed that the fables, based on Aesop&#x27;s Fables, were written for his students in Stallupönen. Their language and poetic rhythm are not as well-developed as in his later works.

His major work, &quot;The Seasons&quot;, was titled by Rheza. It consisted of four idylls, totaling 2,997 hexameters. The work was a long-term project, often revised and rewritten, without a clear beginning or ending. Only two original idylls survive. The other two were destroyed during the Napoleonic Wars. The full work is known from a copy made by Pastor Hohlfeldt after 1794. Between 1809 and 1818, Rheza collected Donelaitis&#x27;s works, edited and translated them, and finally published it as &quot;Das jahr in vier Gesängen&quot;. It was a heavily edited and censored edition, containing only about one sixth of the original poem. In 1824, Rheza also published the fables. A fuller publication of &quot;The Seasons&quot; was prepared by August Schleicher in 1865, but this edition was criticized by Georg H. F. Nesselmann, who prepared an edition in 1869.

==Legacy==
Donelaitis and his works are considered to be an important part of Lithuanian culture, which also led to creation of literature and music works based on Donelaitis&#x27;s life and his poem &quot;The Seasons&quot;. At the Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theatre in 1985, an opera &quot;Kristijonas&quot; by Algimantas Bražinskas was performed. In 2012, an oratorio &quot;Seasons&quot; by Bronius Kutavičius was performed.

<doc id="770750" wikidata="Q7866990" url="?curid=770750" title="USS Acacia">
<text>USS &quot;Acacia&quot; was a steam-powered tugboat in the service of the United States Navy during the American Civil War, named after the Acacia tree.

She was launched as &quot;Vicksburg&quot; sometime in September 1863, purchased and renamed by the Navy at Boston, Massachusetts on 28 October 1863, and commissioned in the Boston Navy Yard on 8 December 1863 with Acting Master John D. Childs in command.
==&quot;Chesapeake&quot;==

While the new tug was preparing for service in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, 17 Confederate agents disguised as passengers seized &quot;Chesapeake&quot; off Cape Cod, Massachusetts on 7 December 1863 as that packet was steaming from New York City to Portland, Maine. The liner&#x27;s captors took her to Saint John, New Brunswick, where, the next day, they landed the prize&#x27;s bonafide passengers, her former captain, and most of her crew.

Word of the takeover reached Portland on the morning of 9 December and quickly spread from there. The news prompted Federal officials at northern ports along the coast to speedy action.

At 16:00 that afternoon, &quot;Acacia&quot; sailed in search of the &quot;Chesapeake&quot;. &quot;En route&quot;, however, she began taking on water so fast that she soon found herself &quot;in a sinking condition&quot; and was forced to seek haven at Portland. On the morning of 11 December, Childs wired from there back to Boston, &quot;Through the help of the fire department the &quot;Acacia&quot; is now alongside a wharf, where she can not sink.&quot;

While &quot;Acacia&quot; was undergoing repairs at Portland, other Union ships continued to hunt for &quot;Chesapeake&quot;. On 17 December, the recently captured blockade runner &quot;Ella and Annie&quot; — which had been hastily manned, armed, and sent to sea — finally caught up with her at Sambro, Nova Scotia. Shortly thereafter, the Northern gunboat arrived on the scene; and her commanding officer prevented &quot;Ella and Annie&quot; from taking the recaptured tug back to Boston, lest such action seriously undermine relations between the United States and the British Empire. Instead, to observe diplomatic niceties, he escorted &quot;Chesapeake&quot; to Halifax where he asked Canadian courts to restore her to her owner. The following morning, the repaired &quot;Acacia&quot; arrived at Halifax with witnesses who could identify and testify against the Southern sailors.

==South Atlantic==
Her work along the Canadian coast completed, &quot;Acacia&quot; returned to Boston and resumed her preparation for blockade duty along the coast of the Carolinas. When ready, she proceeded south via Hampton Roads, Virginia, and arrived off Morris Island, South Carolina on the evening of 6 January 1864. The tug served in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron for the remainder of the war, spending most of her time near Breach Inlet in the line of Union warships outside Charleston Bar. From time to time during her deployment, she had brushes with blockade runners, occasionally forcing the escaping ships to turn back into port and compelling vessels attempting to enter back out to sea.

Ironically, her greatest success came on the morning of 23 December, not when she was on her blockade station, but while she was steaming from Charleston bar to Georgetown, South Carolina, with provisions for screw sloop . As she was passing Cape Romain Shoal, a lookout in the masthead reported two white smokestacks close inshore. &quot;Acacia&quot; altered course and, &quot;on closing in toward the bar, discovered ... a sidewheel steamer of perhaps . No colors could be seen.&quot; The stranger&#x27;s decks were crowded with men preparing to abandon her.

&quot;Acacia&quot; continued &quot;in as near as the depth of water would admit and fired a shell over her.&quot; She then lowered her boats, armed them for boarding, and fired another shot over them as they approached the stranded ship. The stranded steamer then sent up white flags as her own boats began pulling toward the mouth of Alligator Creek where they escaped.

Not a soul remained on board the blockade runner when the Union sailors reached her shortly past noon. Upon boarding the prize, they learned that she was &quot;Julia&quot;, a fast, shallow-draft, iron-hulled vessel built in 1863 at Renfrew, Scotland — apparently for the express purpose of violating the Federal blockade. &quot;Her engines had been purposely disabled ...&quot; and she was hard aground. The almost heroic efforts of the boarding party managed to get &quot;Julia&quot; afloat and underway on her own power shortly after daylight on the following morning, and she was ultimately sent to Key West where she was condemned by the prize court.

==Post-war==
After the end of the Civil War, &quot;Acacia&quot; sailed for Philadelphia on 24 April 1865. She was decommissioned in the navy yard at that port on 12 May and sold at public auction there. Redocumented as SS &quot;Wabash&quot; on 13 October, she served as a merchantman until abandoned in 1881.

<text>Dame Georgina Manunui te Heuheu (née Manunui, born 1943) is a New Zealand National Party politician. She was a Member of Parliament (MP) between 1996 and 2011, and a Cabinet Minister in the New Zealand Government.

==Early life==
Born Georgina Manunui in 1943, she is the daughter of George Manunui of Waitahanui. She is a member of the Ngāti Tuwharetoa tribe of the central North Island and is also related to Te Arawa and Tuhoe tribes. She was born and raised at Taurewa, near Mount Tongariro, and received her secondary schooling at Turakina Maori Girls&#x27; College (1956–59) and Auckland Girls&#x27; Grammar School (1960–61). 

She graduated from Victoria University of Wellington with a BA in English and an LLB, being the first Māori woman to gain a law degree and be admitted to the High Court as barrister and solicitor.

Georgina te Heuheu was first elected to Parliament in 1996.

She was the Minister for Courts and for Women&#x27;s Affairs (1998–1999) during the Fourth National Party Government.

Speculation about her future arose in 2004 after she criticised then leader Don Brash&#x27;s Orewa Speech. Questioned some weeks later, she refused to rule out the possibility that she might switch allegiance to the new Māori Party, which had formed after the resignation of Tariana Turia.

However she remained with National for the 2005 election and served as a backbencher for the party, serving as a Spokeswoman for Broadcasting, Associate Spokeswoman for Defence, Treaty of Waitangi Issues and Māori Affairs (Māori Development).

From 19 November 2008 until the 2011 election she was the Minister for Courts, Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, Minister of Disarmament and Arms Control, and Associate Minister of Māori Affairs in the National Party Government led by John Key. Te Heuheu announced she would retire at the 2011 election.

In her capacity as chairwoman she has been leading a review of Māori Television services and its operational structure to see whether better outcomes can be achieved for the station.

==Private life==
She married Timoti (&quot;Timi&quot;) te Heuheu, brother of Sir Tumu te Heuheu, a Ngāti Tuwharetoa leader and son of Sir Hepi Te Heuheu. He died in 2012. They had two sons.

<text>Yoncalla (also Southern Kalapuya or Yonkalla) is an extinct Kalapuyan language once spoken in southwest Oregon in the United States. In the 19th century it was spoken by the Yoncalla band of the Kalapuya people in the Umpqua River valley. It is closely related to Central Kalapuya and Northern Kalapuya, spoken in the Willamette Valley to the north.

The last known user of the language was Laura Blackery Albertson, who attested to being a partial speaker in 1937.

<text>The Seasons () is the first Lithuanian poem written by Kristijonas Donelaitis around 1765–1775. It is in quantitative dactylic hexameters as often used for Latin and Ancient Greek poetry. It was published as &quot;Das Jahr&quot; in Königsberg, 1818 by Ludwig Rhesa, who also named the poem and selected the arrangement of the parts. The German translation was included in the first edition of the poem. The book was dedicated to Wilhelm von Humboldt. The poem is considered a masterpiece of early Lithuanian literature.

==Synopsis==

The poem consists of 4 parts: &quot;Spring Joys&quot; (&quot;Pavasario linksmybės&quot;), &quot;Summer Toils&quot; (&quot;Vasaros darbai&quot;), &quot;Autumn Boons&quot; (&quot;Rudenio gėrybės&quot;), and &quot;Winter Cares&quot; &quot;(Žiemos rūpesčiai)&quot;. In these 4 idylls, totaling 2997 hexameters, are depicted the natural setting of Lithuania Minor, its people, their work, and their customs. The poem depicts a realistic portrayal of Lietuvininkai (Prussian Lithuanians) peasants&#x27; life in the middle 18th century, as it was affected by colonization of East Prussia. Germans and Austrians, Swiss and French, brought in and given special consideration by the government, became the upper class of landlords and officials, while the indigenous population became the lower class of serfs. In &quot;The Seasons&quot; the village life of the latter is depicted as patriarchal in structure. The natural virtues idealized by the Pietist movement, diligence, piety, honesty, and submission to authority, flourish. Social consciousness of the people is largely dormant. There appear only a few characters through whose lips the poet accuses the gentry and the government of exploiting the people. However, such characters are not portrayed sympathetically; they are considered degenerates by the villagers in the poem and by its author. The poet contents himself with telling his readers that all men were created equal in the beginning and that only later did some become lords and others serfs. Donelaitis calls the latter būrai (boors), and shows deep sympathy for them. He reprimands their evil exploiters, but he does not raise any protest against the system of serfdom.

The social contrast coincided with a national and even a moral division. The villagers, who cultivated the aforementioned virtues, were Lithuanian. The immigrant colonists tended to weaken these virtues with their drunkenness and their backsliding from the Church. The poet condemns the imported vices and urges his brother Lithuanians (Lietuvininkai) not to succumb to the novelties but to preserve their traditions, including their language, customs, and dress. In a word he preaches passive resistance, though with some exceptions. The author recognizes certain desirable traits in the newcomers. For instance, he urges Lithuanian women to learn industriousness and other useful virtues from the German women. In the general picture portrayed by the poem it is evident that with the aging and passing of the exponents of the old patriarchal culture the Lithuanian village with its traditions is sinking in the maelstrom of immigrant culture.

==Style==

&quot;The Seasons&quot; does not have any single, simple plot, with characters described in detail. The narrative of the poem is often interrupted by asides, didactic passages and lyrical reflections. The characters are sketchy; they are simply good or simply bad, with few nuances. Donelaitis is not giving too detailed description of objects or persons. He shows them in the dynamic of life, acting and speaking, even larger than life. The poet, moreover, knows the psychology of peasant and serf. To this end the poet makes ingenious use of synecdoche. He also employs hyperbole, exaggerating tempo of action, distances, and results to the point of demolishing the bounds of reality and creating a new artistic world.

Donelaitis has nature operating in terms which only a villager’s associations could attribute to it. The picturesque vocabulary of Donelaitis is akin to folklore. He never waters down a phrase, nor does he euphemize, but is able to recreate in words the substantiality of the world and the speech of the rustics he portrays. His diction is crisp and fresh, and - because of its authenticity - simple and dignified. On the other hand, the language is full of unique metaphors, personifications, analogies, and hyperbolas which make it highly poetical.

It is in quantitative dactylic hexameters as often used for Latin and Ancient Greek poetry, but due to the nature of the Lithuanian language it has far fewer dactyls than in Virgil or Homer, and in more than half of the lines the only dactylic foot is the 5th.

==Literary context==

This poem of Donelaitis did not differ in literary form from fables, poems, and idylls then in vogue in Germany and Europe in general, nor did it depart from the fashion of writing in imitation of the ancient Greek and Roman poets. &quot;The Seasons&quot;, moreover, followed the literary tendency of the day to portray not cities and aristocrats but rather the natural setting of the village and its inhabitants (for example James Thomson, Albrecht von Haller, Ewald Christian von Kleist, Barthold Heinrich Brockes). In the poem the reader finds a good deal of the didactic element so popular at the time.

Donelaitis was among the first European writers of the age to employ the classical hexameter. (Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, for example, used it in 1748). Furtheron, this Lithuanian poet nature was not conceived in the spirit of the Age of Enlightenment; the peasants he portrayed were not sentimentalized stereotypes. People in &quot;The Seasons&quot; are drawn realistically, with their labors, experiences, cares, and primitive mentality, abounding with mythology. Thirdly, Donelaitis is characterized by his clear stand in the social, ethnic, and moral clash between the immigrant colonists and the old Lithuanian inhabitants. This was his original contribution.

==Cultural significance==

&quot;The Seasons&quot; is the first classical piece of fiction written in the Lithuanian language, the first Lithuanian poem as well as the most successful Lithuanian hexameter piece to date. It has long stepped over the borders of Lithuanian literature: it has been translated into Belarusian, Bulgarian, Czech, English, Finnish, French, Georgian, German, Hungarian, Japanese, Yiddish, Italian, Latvian, Polish, Russian, Romanian and Esperanto. &quot;The Seasons&quot; (most probably in its German translation) was highly valued by Adam Mickiewicz and has inspired him to write a poem, &quot;Konrad Wallenrod&quot;. Goethe is also said to have liked the poem.

Acclaimed Lithuanian theatre director Eimuntas Nekrošius has adapted the first and third part of the piece to the performances &quot;Donelaitis. Metai. Pavasario linksmybės&quot; (&quot;Donelaitis.The Seasons.Spring joys&quot;) and &quot;Donelaitis. Metai. Rudens darbai&quot; (&quot;Donelaitis.The Seasons.Autumn toils&quot;), staged in 2003.

<doc id="770768" wikidata="Q1386534" url="?curid=770768" title="Liquid fuel">
<text>Liquid fuels are combustible or energy-generating molecules that can be harnessed to create mechanical energy, usually producing kinetic energy; they also must take the shape of their container. It is the fumes of liquid fuels that are flammable instead of the fluid.
Most liquid fuels in widespread use are derived from fossil fuels; however, there are several types, such as hydrogen fuel (for automotive uses), ethanol, and biodiesel, which are also categorized as a liquid fuel. Many liquid fuels play a primary role in transportation and the economy.

Liquid fuels are contrasted with solid fuels and gaseous fuels.

==General properties==
Some common properties of liquid fuels are that they are easy to transport, and can be handled with relative ease. Physical properties of liquid fuels vary by temperature, though not as greatly as for gaseous fuels. Some of these properties are: flash point, the lowest temperature at which a flammable concentration of vapor is produced; fire point, the temperature at which sustained burning of vapor will occur; cloud point for diesel fuels, the temperature at which dissolved waxy compounds begin to coalesce, and pour point, the temperature below which the fuel is too thick to pour freely. These properties affect the safety and handling of the fuel.

==Petroleum fuels==

Most liquid fuels used currently are produced from petroleum. The most notable of these is gasoline. Scientists generally accept that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of dead plants and animals by exposure to heat and pressure in the Earth&#x27;s crust.

===Gasoline===
Gasoline is the most widely used liquid fuel. Gasoline, as it is known in United States and Canada, or petrol virtually everywhere else, is made of hydrocarbon molecules (compounds that contain hydrogen and carbon only) forming aliphatic compounds, or chains of carbons with hydrogen atoms attached. However, many aromatic compounds (carbon chains forming rings) such as benzene are found naturally in gasoline and cause the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to the fuel.

Production of gasoline is achieved by distillation of crude oil. The desirable liquid is separated from the crude oil in refineries. Crude oil is extracted from the ground in several processes, the most commonly seen may be beam pumps. To create gasoline, petroleum must first be removed from crude oil.

Liquid gasoline itself is not actually burned, but its fumes ignite, causing the remaining liquid to evaporate and then burn. Gasoline is extremely volatile and easily combusts, making any leakage potentially extremely dangerous. Gasoline sold in most countries carries a published octane rating. The octane number is an empirical measure of the resistance of gasoline to combusting prematurely, known as knocking. The higher the octane rating, the more resistant the fuel is to autoignition under high pressures, which allows for a higher compression ratio. Engines with a higher compression ratio, commonly used in race cars and high-performance regular-production automobiles, can produce more power; however, such engines require a higher octane fuel. Increasing the octane rating has, in the past, been achieved by adding &#x27;anti-knock&#x27; additives such as lead-tetra-ethyl. Because of the environmental impact of lead additives, the octane rating is increased today by refining out the impurities that cause knocking.

===Diesel===
Conventional diesel is similar to gasoline in that it is a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons extracted from petroleum. Diesel may cost more or less than gasoline, but generally costs less to produce because the extraction processes used are simpler. Some countries (particularly Canada, India and Italy) also have lower tax rates on diesel fuels.

After distillation, the diesel fraction is normally processed to reduce the amount of sulfur in the fuel. Sulfur causes corrosion in vehicles, acid rain and higher emissions of soot from the tail pipe (exhaust pipe). Historically, in Europe lower sulfur levels than in the United States were legally required. However, recent US legislation reduced the maximum sulfur content of diesel from 3,000 ppm to 500 ppm in 2007, and 15 ppm by 2010. Similar changes are also underway in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and several Asian countries. See also Ultra-low-sulfur diesel.

A diesel engine is a type of internal combustion engine which ignites fuel by injecting it into a combustion chamber previously compressed with air (which in turn raises the temperature) as opposed to using an outside ignition source, such as a spark plug.

===Kerosene===

Kerosene is used in kerosene lamps and as a fuel for cooking, heating, and small engines. It displaced whale oil for lighting use. Jet fuel for jet engines is made in several grades (Avtur, Jet A, Jet A-1, Jet B, JP-4, JP-5, JP-7 or JP-8) that are kerosene-type mixtures. One form of the fuel known as RP-1 is burned with liquid oxygen as rocket fuel. These fuel grade kerosenes meet specifications for smoke points and freeze points.

In the mid-20th century, kerosene or &quot;TVO&quot; (Tractor Vaporising Oil) was used as a cheap fuel for tractors. The engine would start on gasoline, then switch over to kerosene once the engine warmed up. A &quot;heat valve&quot; on the manifold would route the exhaust gases around the intake pipe, heating the kerosene to the point where it can be ignited by an electric spark.

Kerosene is sometimes used as an additive in diesel fuel to prevent gelling or waxing in cold temperatures. However, this is not advisable in some recent vehicle diesel engines, as doing so may interfere with the engine&#x27;s emissions regulation equipment.

===Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)===

LP gas is a mixture of propane and butane, both of which are easily compressible gases under standard atmospheric conditions. It offers many of the advantages of compressed natural gas (CNG), but does not burn as cleanly, is denser than air and is much more easily compressed. Commonly used for cooking and space heating, LP gas and compressed propane are seeing increased use in motorized vehicles; propane is the third most commonly used motor fuel globally.

=== Carbon dioxide formation from petroleum fuels. ===
Petroleum fuels, when burnt, release carbon dioxide that is necessary for plant growth, but which (given the large scale of global emissions) is potentially harmful to world climate. The amount of carbon dioxide released when one liter of fuel is combusted can be estimated: As a good approximation the chemical formula of e.g. diesel is . Note that diesel is a mixture of different molecules. As carbon has a molar mass of 12 g/mol and hydrogen (atomic!) has a molar mass of about 1 g/mol, so the fraction by weight of carbon in diesel is roughly 12/14. The reaction of diesel combustion is given by:

2 + 3n 2n + 2n

Carbon dioxide has a molar mass of 44g/mol as it consists of 2 atoms of oxygen (16 g/mol) and 1 atom of carbon (12 g/mol). So 12 g of carbon yield 44 g of Carbon dioxide. Diesel has a density of 0.838 kg per liter. Putting everything together the mass of carbon dioxide that is produced by burning 1 liter of diesel can be calculated as:

formula_1

The number of 2.63 kg of carbon dioxide from 1 liter of Diesel is close to the values found in the literature. 

For gasoline, with a density of 0.75 kg/L and a ratio of carbon to hydrogen atoms of about 6 to 14, the estimated value of carbon emission if 1 liter of gasoline is burnt gives:

==Non-petroleum fossil fuels==

When petroleum is not easily available, chemical processes such as the Fischer–Tropsch process can be used to produce liquid fuels from coal or natural gas. Synthetic fuels from coal were strategically important during World War II for the German military. Today synthetic fuels produced from natural gas are manufactured, to take advantage of the higher value of liquid fuels in transportation.

==Liquefied natural gas==

Natural gas, composed chiefly of methane, can be compressed to a liquid and used as a substitute for other traditional liquid fuels. Its combustion is very clean compared to other hydrocarbon fuels, but the fuel&#x27;s low boiling point requires the fuel to be kept at high pressures to keep it in the liquid state. Though it has a much lower flash point than fuels such as gasoline, it is in many ways safer due to its higher autoignition temperature and its low density, which causes it to dissipate when released in air.

==Biodiesel==
Biodiesel is similar to diesel but has differences akin to those between petrol and ethanol. For instance, biodiesel has a higher cetane rating (45-60 compared to 45-50 for crude-oil-derived diesel) and it acts as a cleaning agent to get rid of dirt and deposits. It has been argued that it only becomes economically feasible above oil prices of $80 (£40 or €60 as of late February, 2007) per barrel. This does, however, depend on locality, economic situation, government stance on biodiesel and a host of other factors- and it has been proven to be viable at much lower costs in some countries. Also, it yields about 10% less energy than ordinary diesel. Analogous to the use of higher compression ratios used for engines burning higher octane alcohols and petrol in spark-ignition engines, taking advantage of biodiesel&#x27;s high cetane rating can potentially overcome the energy deficit compared to ordinary Number 2 diesel.

==Alcohols==
Generally, the term alcohol refers to ethanol, the first organic chemical produced by humans, but any alcohol can be burned as a fuel. Ethanol and methanol are the most common, being sufficiently inexpensive to be useful.

===Methanol===
Methanol is the lightest and simplest alcohol, produced from the natural gas component methane. Its application is limited primarily due to its toxicity (similar to gasoline), but also due to its high corrosivity and miscibility with water. Small amounts are used in some types of gasoline to increase the octane rating. Methanol-based fuels are used in some race cars and model aeroplanes.

Methanol is also called &quot;methyl alcohol&quot; or &quot;wood alcohol&quot;, the latter because it was formerly produced from the distillation of wood. It is also known by the name &quot;methyl hydrate&quot;.

===Ethanol===
Ethanol, also known as grain alcohol or ethyl alcohol, is commonly found in alcoholic beverages. However, it may also be used as a fuel, most often in combination with gasoline. For the most part, it is used in a 9:1 ratio of gasoline to ethanol to reduce the negative environmental effects of gasoline.

There is increasing interest in the use of a blend of 85% fuel ethanol blended with 15% gasoline. This fuel blend called E85 has a higher fuel octane than most premium types of gasoline. When used in a modern Flexible fuel vehicle, it delivers more performance to the gasoline it replaces at the expense of higher fuel consumption due to ethanol&#x27;s lesser specific energy content.

Ethanol for use in gasoline and industrial purposes may be considered a fossil fuel because it is often synthesized from the petroleum product ethylene, which is cheaper than production from fermentation of grains or sugarcane.

===Butanol===

Butanol is an alcohol which can be used as a fuel in most gasoline internal combustion engines without engine modification. It is typically a product of the fermentation of biomass by the bacterium &quot;Clostridium acetobutylicum&quot; (also known as the Weizmann organism). This process was first delineated by Chaim Weizmann in 1916 for the production of acetone from starch for making cordite, a smokeless gunpowder.

The advantages of butanol are its high octane rating (over 100) and high energy content, only about 10% lower than gasoline, and subsequently about 50% more energy-dense than ethanol, 100% more so than methanol. Butanol&#x27;s only major disadvantages are its high flashpoint (35 °C or 95 °F), toxicity (note that toxicity levels exist but are not precisely confirmed), and the fact that the fermentation process for renewable butanol emits a foul odour. The Weizmann organism can only tolerate butanol levels up to 2% or so, compared to 14% for ethanol and yeast. Making butanol from oil produces no such odour, but the limited supply and environmental impact of oil usage defeat the purpose of alternative fuels. The cost of butanol is about $1.25–$1.32 per kilogram ($0.57-$0.58 per pound or $4 approx. per US gallon). Butanol is much more expensive than ethanol (approximately $0.40 per litre or 1.50 per gallon) and methanol.

On June 20, 2006, DuPont and BP announced that they were converting an existing ethanol plant to produce 9 million gallons (34 000 cubic meters) of butanol per year from sugar beets. DuPont stated a goal of being competitive with oil at $30–$40 per barrel ($0.19-$0.25 per liter) without subsidies, so the price gap with ethanol is narrowing.

==Hydrogen==


Liquefied hydrogen is the liquid state of the element hydrogen. It is a common liquid rocket fuel for rocket applications and can be used as a fuel in an internal combustion engine or fuel cell. Various concept hydrogen vehicles have been lower volumetric energy, the hydrogen volumes needed for combustion are large. Hydrogen was liquefied for the first time by James Dewar in 1898.

==Ammonia==
Ammonia (NH3) has been used as a fuel before at times when gasoline is unavailable (e.g. for buses in Belgium during WWII). It has a volumetric energy density of 17 Megajoules per liter (compared to 10 for hydrogen, 18 for methanol, 21 for dimethyl ether and 34 for gasoline). It must be compressed or cooled to be a liquid fuel, although it does not require cryogenic cooling as hydrogen does to be liquefied.

<doc id="770769" wikidata="Q7745466" url="?curid=770769" title="The Language of the Genes">
<text>The Language of the Genes (HarperCollins, ) is a popular science book by Steve Jones about genetics and evolution. It followed a 1991 series of Reith Lectures by Jones with the same title. The book introduces all different aspects of genetics and molecular biology, and the new editions contain information about the frontiers of the field, such as the Human Genome Project. The first edition was published in 1993 and won the Rhône-Poulenc Prize (now known as the Royal Society Prizes for Science Books).

The title of the book is partly the result of Jones&#x27; regular use of a metaphor of nucleotides as letters, codons as words and genes as sentences, but also reflecting Jones&#x27; short explanation of language&#x27;s role in human evolution.

A second revised and expanded edition () was published by Flamingo on 18 September 2000.

<doc id="770775" wikidata="Q6646308" url="?curid=770775" title="South End Grounds">
<text>South End Grounds refers to any one of three baseball parks on one site in Boston, Massachusetts. They were home to the franchise that eventually became known as the Boston Braves, first in the National Association and later in the National League, from 1871 through part of the 1914 season. That stretch of 43 1/2 seasons is still the longest tenure of the Braves club at any of their various ballparks and cities since 1914.

At least in its third edition, the formal name of the park—as indicated by the sign over its entrance gate—was Boston National League Base Ball Park. It was located on the northeast corner of Columbus Avenue and Walpole Street (now Saint Cyprian&#x27;s Place), just southwest of Carter Playground. Accordingly, it was also known over the years as Walpole Street Grounds; two other names were Union Base-ball Grounds and Boston Baseball Grounds.

The ballpark was across the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad tracks, to the south, from the eventual site of the Huntington Avenue Grounds, home field of Boston&#x27;s American League team prior to the building of Fenway Park.

The Boston club was initially known as the &quot;Red Stockings,&quot; because four of its key players had come from the famous 1869–1870 barnstorming team known as the Cincinnati Red Stockings and took the nickname with them to Boston. Over time the team acquired other informal nicknames, such as &quot;Beaneaters,&quot; &quot;Red Caps,&quot; &quot;Rustlers&quot; and &quot;Doves.&quot; This team eventually adopted the official nickname &quot;Braves,&quot; just a few years before abandoning South End Grounds.

With its tight foul lines and expansive center field, like a scaled-down version of the Polo Grounds, it was sometimes said that the South End had no right or left field, only a center field.

South End Grounds was rebuilt twice during its lifetime, the first time by choice and the second time by necessity.

==First park==
The first game at the South End Grounds was played on May 16, 1871. The original stands were small and rectangular, not unlike the seating area at a county fair grounds. Behind the right field area were residences and other buildings, and a narrow road called Berlin Street. Columbus Avenue had not yet been extended as far as the ball park.

The Red Stockings dominated the National Association, finishing just two games behind the leaders in 1871, then winning four straight pennants to close out the NA. They joined the newly formed National League in 1876 and won three championships over the first 12 NL seasons. The last game at this version of the grounds came on September 10, 1887. The ballpark&#x27;s stands were demolished later that month to make way for a new structure.

==Second park==
The second South End Grounds was opened on May 25, 1888. Sometimes referred to as the &quot;Grand Pavilion,&quot; it consisted of a large double-decker grandstand behind home plate and uncovered stands stretching down the right and left field lines, as well as bleachers in right-center field. The medieval-style &quot;witch&#x27;s cap&quot; turrets were a very popular decoration on public seating structures of the 1880s and 1890s. The ballpark seated 6,800 by one estimate. It was the only double-decked baseball stadium ever built in Boston, apart from the rooftop seating which has turned the single-decked Fenway Park into a &quot;de facto&quot; double-deck ballpark. The stadium was destroyed in the Great Roxbury Fire of May 16, 1894, which began when children started a small fire beneath the right field bleachers, and which spread and destroyed the stadium and 117 other buildings. During the rebuilding process, the Bostons played their home games at Congress Street Grounds.
===Seating capacity===

==Third park==

The third South End Grounds was built in 10 weeks on the site of the old stand and opened on July 20, 1894. Because the previous structure had not been sufficiently insured, there wasn&#x27;t enough money to rebuild the stands according to its old plans, and a smaller structure was built. One result of the fire was a reconfiguration of the buildings and streets in the area. Berlin Street disappeared, and Columbus Avenue was constructed, running just outside the right field area, replacing wooden buildings that had once stood there.

Few photographs of this ballpark seem to be in circulation. In one sense, the best known photo might be the one showing the opening game of the 1903 World Series, with the Huntington Avenue Grounds in the foreground; and the South End Grounds in the background, its season over, partially hidden by smoke from the rail yards. That image can be seen beside this text. On September 12, 1911, 44-year-old legend Cy Young pitched the final home game of his career in a Boston uniform at the grounds against the New York Giants and fellow future Baseball Hall of Famer Christy Mathewson. The Braves, as they had been rechristened in 1912, moved out of the South End Grounds after their game on August 11, 1914, to accommodate larger crowds during the &quot;stretch drive&quot; of the 1914 pennant race. The team continued to play at Fenway Park until Braves Field was completed during the 1915 season. In contrast to the 11-year lifespan of the Huntington Avenue Grounds, the South End Grounds was the National Association / National League club&#x27;s home for parts of 44 seasons, a longer time span than any subsequent Braves&#x27; home fields.
===Seating capacity===

==Duration==
The Red Stockings / Beaneaters / Braves played their home games in various ballparks and cities, and the South End Grounds remains their longest-used home field in their history:

*South End Grounds 1871–1914 (43 1/2 seasons)
*Fenway Park 1914–1915 (parts of 2 seasons)
*Braves Field 1915–1952 (37 1/2 seasons)
*Milwaukee County Stadium 1953–1965 (13 seasons)
*Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium 1966–1996 (31 seasons)
*Turner Field 1997–2016 (20 seasons)
*Truist Park 2017–present

==Current use==

The stadium was demolished after the Braves left. The former site of the grandstand and the infield is located where Northeastern University&#x27;s Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Complex (ISEC) currently stands, between the Columbus Parking Garage and Ruggles Station of the Orange Line of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. The outfield was located where the garage stands. A historical marker commemorating the South End Grounds is located at Ruggles Station.

<doc id="770788" wikidata="Q7568485" url="?curid=770788" title="South Side Park">
<text>South Side Park was the name used for three different baseball parks that formerly stood in Chicago, Illinois, at different times, and whose sites were all just a few blocks away from each other.

== South Side Park I (1884) ==

The first South Side Park was the home of the short-lived Chicago Browns entry in the Union Association of 1884. The venue was also called Union Base Ball Park and 39th Street Grounds in local newspapers.

Indications are that the ballpark was on a block bounded by 39th Street (south); South Wabash Avenue (west); 38th Street (north); and South Michigan Avenue (east).

The Unions played 35 games at this park between May 2 and August 1. The papers indicated they were then headed on a three-week road trip. After that road trip, they re-emerged as the Pittsburgh entry, which played five home games at Exposition Park before taking to the road for the last few weeks of their existence.

There are no known photos or illustrations of the ballpark, and it does not appear in contemporary maps or city directories. The meager descriptions of the ballpark require some research to pin down its precise location. The ballpark was built in the summer of 1883. The Chicago &quot;Tribune&quot; of June 17, 1883, p. 9, gives the location of the new park as &quot;Thirty-ninth Street, between Michigan and Wabash Avenues.&quot; The corner of 39th and Wabash is stated as the main entrance.

That leaves the question of the northern boundary, which is given in the reports of a tragedy described in &quot;Tribune&quot; articles from July 20, 1884, p. 15; and from July 21, 1884, p. 8. The ball club had some fireworks left over from July 4, and they conducted a show on the night of the 19th, to use them up. One of the aerial bombs failed to explode in flight, and came down hard on a resident of 3800 South Michigan Avenue, killing her. The house, on the southwest corner of 38th and Michigan, was reported to stand &quot;close behind the inclosure&quot; of the ballpark. That indicates 38th as the northern boundary of the ballpark.

The park fell into disuse once the Union Association abandoned Chicago. The last reference to it in local newspapers came in the winter of 1884–1885 when the Chicago National League club was shopping around for a new location after having been driven from their lakefront ballpark. The &quot;Tribune&quot; for February 25, 1885, p. 6, reported that &quot;the old Union grounds&quot; at 39th and Wabash were looked at, but were considered too far from the business district to be suitable.

== South Side Park II (1890–1893) ==

The second South Side Park was first the home of the Chicago Pirates entry in the Players&#x27; League of 1890 (whose roster included Charles Comiskey), and then was the home of the National League club now called the Chicago Cubs during parts of 1891–1893. In 1890, it was usually called Brotherhood Park in the local newspapers, as with several of the Players&#x27; League venues.

By 1890 the National League club had become generally known as &quot;Anson&#x27;s Colts&quot;. The new Players&#x27; League club co-opted the old nickname &quot;White Stockings&quot; and initially labeled their ballpark as &quot;White Stocking Park&quot;. That name was soon replaced by &quot;Brotherhood Park&quot;. Although the club continued to call themselves &quot;White Stockings&quot;, local papers frequently referred to the team as the &quot;Pirates&quot;. Comiskey would adopt the &quot;White Stockings&quot; name again with his new team in 1900.

The park&#x27;s location was typically given as 35th and Wentworth, which was the location of the main entrance, and convenient to an east–west rail line.

The field generally occupied the same footprint as the future Comiskey Park along with Armour Square Park. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, in an article on January 19, 1890, stated that the property was bounded by 33rd and 35th Streets to the north and south, and by Wentworth Avenue and the Rock Island Railroad to the east and west respectively. The article said the grandstand would be built along 35th Street. However, another article exactly one month later stated that the grandstand was being built on the 33rd Street side of the block, to hold 4,000 patrons, and additional &quot;bleaching boards&quot; seating to accommodate another 3,000.

The League club acquired the lease on the grounds after Comiskey&#x27;s team and the league folded. They played a partial schedule at this field in 1891, continuing to play other games at West Side Park (I) during 1891. They then played their complete home season on the South Side in 1892.

When the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition opened in 1893, the League club wanted to break with their no-Sundays tradition and start playing Sunday games to attract Fair visitors, but their South Side lease forbade Sunday ball. They sought a new location, which turned out to be West Side Park (II). After drawing well on their first few Sundays, the club abandoned the South Side park and moved to the West Side on a full-time basis.

The south end of the property was the site of Comiskey Park from 1910 through 1990, and is now a parking lot for the current Sox ballpark. Armour Square Park was established in 1905 and still has ball fields on it.

== South Side Park III (1900–1940) ==

The third South Side Park, the best known and longest lived venue by that name, was on the north side of 39th Street (renamed Pershing Road in 1920) between South Wentworth Avenue and South Princeton Avenue, located at . It was a few blocks west of the 1884 ballpark. The 39th Street Grounds served as the playing field of the Chicago Wanderers cricket club during the 1893 World&#x27;s Fair and then through 1899. After Charles Comiskey built a wooden grandstand on the site in 1900, it became the home of the Chicago White Sox of the American League. It served as home to the White Sox first in 1900 as a minor league team, and then from 1901 to June 27, 1910, as a major league team.

The team abandoned the wooden ballpark, with its capacity of 15,000, in the middle of the 1910 season after the new (and much larger) steel and concrete Comiskey Park was finished, just three blocks north of the old park (corner to corner). So began a run of seasons for the White Sox in their new home.

Meanwhile, after some rebuilding, South Side Park became the home of the newly formed Negro league baseball team called the Chicago American Giants in 1911. It was renamed Schorling&#x27;s Park for team owner Rube Foster&#x27;s white business partner, John M. Schorling, a south side saloon keeper who leased the grounds. It was also called Cole&#x27;s Park and American Giants Park during this era.
The American Giants played their games there through the 1940 season. In late December, a fire heavily damaged the ballpark. Though often stated as happening on Christmas Day of 1940, it actually happened on the 23rd. Instead of rebuilding, the American Giants abandoned the site and would play their remaining seasons at Comiskey Park. Today, the Chicago Housing Authority&#x27;s Wentworth Gardens housing project occupies the site.

The South Side Park/Schorling&#x27;s Park/Wentworth Gardens site is located across Pershing Road from a junkyard site which was named a Superfund site in the late 1990s.

===World Series===
South Side Park was the host of three games in baseball&#x27;s first crosstown World Series in 1906. The Chicago White Sox defeated their crosstown rival Chicago Cubs in 6 games to clinch the title at home with an 8–3 victory to capture their first World Series title.

===Postseason history===
Schloring Park became part of Negro league history in 1913. It hosted Games 5–14 of a Championship Series held between the Chicago American Giants and the New York Lincoln Giants. This Series is considered the first postseason contest between Negro league baseball teams, with this played between what was considered the best teams of the East and West. The Park would host playoff games involving the American Giants nine times: 1920, 1921, 1922, 1926, 1927, 1928, 1932, 1934, 1937. The American Giants were victorious for the Negro National League pennant in 1920, 1921, 1922, 1926, and 1927 and the Negro Southern League pennant in 1932. They hosted Games 7–11 of the 1926 Colored World Series and Games 1–4 of the 1927 Colored World Series, which Chicago won both.

<text>Henry Clay Dean (27 October 1822 – 6 February 1887) was a Methodist Episcopal preacher, lawyer, orator and author who was a critic of the American Civil War and the Lincoln Administration.

==Early life and education==
Dean was born in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, October 27, 1822. Named for the senator from Kentucky, Henry Clay, Dean was born just two years after Clay guided the Missouri Compromise into law. He was one of three sons of Caleb Dean, a stonemason. He was a graduate of Madison College in Pennsylvania and taught for a time in the area and studied law.

Dean married Christiana Margaret Haigler on Jan. 19, 1847 and together they had six children: John Willey Dean, Charles Caleb Dean, Henry Clay Dean Jr., Mary Jermima Dean, George James Dean, Christiana Margaret Dean and Virginia Rebecca &quot;Vinnie&quot; Dean.

==Career==
In 1845 he joined the Methodist Episcopal Conference of Virginia and began to preach in the mountain region of that state where he remained for four years. In 1850 he removed to Iowa, locating to Pittsburg in Van Buren County, where he preached through the Keosauqua circuit, joining the Fairfield Conference. Through the influence of George Wallace Jones, one of Iowa&#x27;s early United States Senators, Dean was chosen chaplain of the United States Senate on December 4, 1855.

Dean was one of the trustees of the Iowa Wesleyan College at Mount Pleasant, Iowa. Dean was admitted to the bar but did not practice law until after the Civil War. He was a public speaker of rare eloquence and was frequently invited to deliver lectures, among which was a ‘Reply to Ingersoll,&#x27; ‘The Constitution,&#x27; ‘Declaration of Independence&#x27; and many other topics.

==United States Civil War==
Dean carried his Methodist values into the period leading up to the Civil War. He opposed the extension of slavery. He opposed the Lecompton Constitution written by proslavery Kansans and supported the popular sovereignty view of Stephen Douglas. He did not support the continuation of slavery in the nation, but he believed that slaves should be freed through government purchase over time. In his article &quot;The Bloodmarket of the Rich&quot;, Dean argued the entire war was conceived by an international conspiracy of bankers and &quot;stock-gamblers&quot;.

Dean was arrested for disloyal utterances and confined in prison for two weeks by order of Government officials. Upon his release he wrote and published a book with the title, ‘Crimes of the Civil War.&#x27; It was a bitter rebuttal against President Lincoln and the administration in the work of subduing the Rebellion.

==Later life==
With the conclusion of the war, Dean became a spokesman for Democrats in opposition to Radical Republicanism. In 1867 he began to advocate &quot;soft money&quot; inflation and payment of the national debt through the continued printing of paper money. In doing so, he became a founder of the United States Greenback Party among western Democrats. Dean vociferously promoted Greenbackism, decried the National Bank system, and denounced bondholders. He also again offered stinging criticism of Lincoln&#x27;s wartime actions. He brought his views together in Crimes of the Civil War and Curse of the Funding System (1869).
Dean also practiced law after the war and became known for accepting the cases of poor clients.
In 1871 Dean moved to a farm in Putnam County, Missouri, which he named ‘Rebel Cove&#x27;. He gathered a great library which was later destroyed by fire.

==Death and legacy==

Here is what Mark Twain had to say on the subject of Henry Clay Dean:

&quot;He began life poor and without education. But he educated himself - on the curbstones of Keokuk. He would sit down on a curbstone with his book, careless or unconscious of the clatter of commerce and the tramp of the passing crowds, and bury himself in his studies by the hour, never changing his position except to draw in his knees now and then to let a dray pass unobstructed; and when his book was finished, its contents, however abstruse, had been burned into his memory, and were his permanent possession. In this way he acquired a vast hoard of all sorts of learning, and had it pigeonholed in his head where he could put his intellectual hand on it whenever it was wanted.
His clothes differed in no respect from a &quot;wharf-rat&#x27;s,&quot; except that they were raggeder, more ill-assorted and inharmonious (and therefore more extravagantly picturesque), and several layers dirtier. Nobody could infer the master-mind in the top of that edifice from the edifice itself.

He was an orator - by nature in the first place, and later by the training of experience and practice. When he was out on a canvass, his name was a lodestone which drew the farmers to his stump from fifty miles around. His theme was always politics. He used no notes, for a volcano does not need notes.&quot;
- Life on the MississippiActually Henry Clay. NOT Dean.

<text>The Cincinnati Red Stockings of were baseball&#x27;s first all-professional team, with ten salaried players. The Cincinnati Base Ball Club formed in 1866 and fielded competitive teams in the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP) 1867–1870, a time of a transition that ambitious Cincinnati businessmen and ballplayer Harry Wright shaped as much as anyone. Major League Baseball recognized those events officially by sponsoring a centennial of professional baseball in 1969.

Thanks partly to their on-field success and the continental scope of their tours, the Red Stockings established styles in team uniforms and team nicknames that have some currency even in the 21st century. They also established the color red as the color of Cincinnati (continuing with the modern Cincinnati Reds), and they were the origin of the &quot;Red Sox&quot; in Boston Red Sox.

== Baseball club ==
The Cincinnati Base Ball Club, or simply Cincinnati Club, was established July 23, 1866, at a downtown law office, drawing up a constitution and by-laws and electing officers including Alfred T. Goshorn as president. A few years later Goshorn earned international fame as Director-General of the (U.S.) Centennial Exposition held 1876 in Philadelphia. Founding member George B. Ellard also led the Union Cricket Club, and the relationship between them proved decisive for the baseball club&#x27;s success.
The ball club&#x27;s first home field was at a location stated as &quot;the foot of Ninth Street, in the Mill Creek bottoms.&quot;[Cincinnati &quot;Enquirer&quot;, October 4, 1939, p.32]

After playing four matches that first summer, Cincinnati joined the NABBP for 1867 and concluded an agreement to play at the Union Cricket Club grounds (just west of Lincoln Park, a site now occupied by Cincinnati Union Terminal). George Ellard&#x27;s son says that &quot;a great number of the cricket club members&quot; joined and so &quot;the team was greatly strengthened and interest in baseball gained a new impetus.&quot; Plans for a new clubhouse and &quot;more substantical&quot; enclosing fence were approved in April and the commercial basis was approved in June: members of both clubs admitted free to all matches; otherwise &quot;ten cents for home matches and twenty-five cents for foreign matches. Ladies free.&quot; (Ellard 23–27).

The team was soon nicknamed &quot;Red Stockings&quot; in reference to the main feature of the uniforms designed by Ellard; long stockings were then a novelty in team uniforms. 

Harry Wright had migrated from New York in 1866 for a job as &quot;club pro&quot; at the Union Cricket Club. Next year he picked up similar baseball duties, but the lingo is commonly stretched to call him a baseball &quot;manager&quot; from that time. His first team may have been local to a man, but he both developed and imported players to represent the club in competitive play for the 1868 season. The first team won 16 matches with regional opponents, losing only to the touring Nationals from Washington. As for most hosts on that tour, it was a &quot;bad loss&quot; on the scorecard but an instructive one for Cincinnati: the players, the club, the fans, and perhaps the local newspapers. Everyone learned advanced points of play and, from their different perspectives, witnessed the gulf in playing strength.

About half of the 1868 Red Stockings were eastern imports, presumably compensated somehow. The two leading batsmen, John Hatfield and Fred Waterman, arrived from the New York Mutuals, one of the strongest teams anywhere and another team pushing the bounds of the amateur code. Asa Brainard had been the Brooklyn Excelsiors&#x27; regular pitcher for four seasons, succeeded in 1867 by Candy Cummings. Catcher Doug Allison was from the Geary club of Philadelphia, one of the stronger clubs in that city. There was one local recruit, too, from the rival Buckeye club: Charlie Gould at first base. Harry Wright remained the first pitcher, sharing that position and second base with Brainard, and three other incumbents remained in the outfield and at shortstop. The 1868 team played a heavy schedule including a late eastern tour, once again dominating the western teams but losing seven of 43 matches in all.

== First professional team ==

When the NABBP permitted professional members for 1869, Harry Wright and probably George Ellard organized a fully professional team: ten men on salary for eight months, March 15 to November 15. Wright played center field and coordinated the team defense, a novelty from any position. Younger brother and shortstop George Wright, new to the team in 1869, was its best player, maybe the best of his time.

The professional Cincinnati Red Stockings played their first game May 4, 1869, with a 45–9 win over the Great Westerns of Cincinnati. The team won 57 games and lost zero, counting only matches with Association clubs. They played over 60 games counting outside teams. Their commercial tour of continental scope, visiting both Boston and San Francisco, was unprecedented and may be essentially unrepeated. The first season ended November 6 at home with the Cincinnatis beating the Mutuals of New York 17–8.

With the same regular nine, the team continued to win regularly, perhaps 24 games before losing 8–7 in eleven innings to the Brooklyn Atlantics in Brooklyn, June 14. The Red Stockings remained one of the few strongest teams on the field, losing only six games, but attendance declined badly, especially at home.

== Perfect season ==

In 1869, the Red Stockings posted a perfect 57–0 record, the only perfect season in professional baseball history. This was the first team to play on the East and West coasts in the same season. More than 2,000 people greeted the team when it arrived in San Francisco at 10:00 p.m. &quot;They really helped nationalize the game and put Cincinnati on the map as a baseball town,&quot; said Greg Rhodes, a Reds historian who wrote &quot;The First Boys of Summer&quot; (Road West Publishing Company, 1994), along with &quot;Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; reporter John Erardi, about the 1869–1870 Red Stockings.

== 1870–1871 ==
On June 14, 1870, after 81 consecutive wins since assembling as the first openly professional team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings lost 8–7 to the Brooklyn Atlantics before a crowd of 20,000 at the Capitoline Grounds. Bob Ferguson scored the winning run in the 11th inning on a hit by pitcher George Zettlein.

The Executive Board now led by President A.P.C. Bonte recommended on November 21, 1870, that the club not employ a nine for 1871, for that had become too expensive. The spokesmen anticipated &quot;a development of the amateur talent of our club, such as has not been displayed since we employed professionals.&quot; The officers subsequently decided to disband the company (the players having disbanded via the market) and a public meeting of the members put that decision into effect.

Harry Wright was hired by Boston businessman Ivers Whitney Adams to organize a new pro club in Boston. Wright persuaded three Cincinnati teammates to join the 1871 Boston Red Stockings in the first professional league, as it turned out. Ex-Cincinnati Red Stockings moved around some (see the note on Team members) but Boston retained both Wright brothers throughout the five years of the National Association.

The current Cincinnati Reds club identifies itself with the Cincinnati Red Stockings, despite reorganization and defections in the early years.

The distinct Boston Red Stockings, beginning business with half of the Cincinnati team, both followed the young tradition and spread it to Boston. Eventually, the Boston Red Stockings evolved into the Boston Braves; the club is now based in Atlanta, and retain red as one of their uniform colors. The Boston Red Sox, established in 1901, adopted their version of the old nickname in 1908.

==Players==

Ten men composed the 1869 team and the First Nine returned for 1870 in the same roles.
* Asa Brainard, Pitcher
* Doug Allison, Catcher
* Charlie Gould, First Base
* Charlie Sweasy, Second Base
* Fred Waterman, Third Base
* George Wright, Shortstop
* Andy Leonard, Left Field
* Harry Wright, Center Field/Manager
* Cal McVey, Right Field
* Dick Hurley, substitute

From 1867 Harry Wright fulfilled the duties of modern field managers, general managers, and traveling secretaries. In 1868 he and Brainard shared the pitcher and second base positions with Allison, Gould, and Waterman already manning the other bases. For the crosstown rival Buckeye club, Sweasy and Leonard played second and third with Hurley a substitute. Among them only Gould was a Cincinnati native; the others were from the East, presumably compensated somehow by club members if not by the clubs. (The Association first permitted professional clubs for 1869.) Meanwhile, George Wright and McVey played in New York and Indianapolis, primarily at shortstop and pitcher.

For 1871 the Nine split between two teams in the new all-professional National Association: Gould, the Wright brothers, and McVey with the Boston Red Stockings; Brainard, Allison, Sweasy, Waterman, and Leonard with the Washington Olympics. Substitute Hurley is also a &quot;major leaguer&quot; for his brief play with the Olympics in 1872, although that club went out of business midseason and he did not return to the league. The leading substitute in the second season, Harry Deane joined the Fort Wayne Kekiongas in 1871 and later played a full season regularly.

Andy Leonard rejoined Gould, the Wrights, and McVey in Boston for 1872, the first of four consecutive championship seasons there. After one miss Harry won his last two championships as a non-playing manager in 1877–1878 with Leonard and brother George still among his regulars. Gould and McVey left in 1873, although McVey returned for 1874–75 only.

==Record==
Before Cincinnati hired its team for the 1869 season, the strongest clubs were located from Washington to Troy, New York. In 1867 and 1868, Cincinnati was beaten only by clubs from that eastern corridor, winning 16 and 29 games without defeat against western opponents.

<text>The Metropolitan Club (New York Metropolitans or the Mets) was a 19th-century professional baseball team that played in New York City from 1880 to 1887. (The &quot;New York Metropolitan Baseball Club&quot; was the name chosen in 1961 for the New York Mets, who began play in 1962.)

==History==
===Founding===
A Manhattan-based yachting team known as Metropolitan Club was in existence and covered by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in the 1850s, yet it remains very murky whether or not such a commonplace name as “Metropolitan” can really draw a 40-year link between two radically different sports and contexts.

The Metropolitan Club was founded in 1880 as an independent professional team by business entrepreneur John B. Day and baseball manager Jim Mutrie. Unusually for professional teams of the period, the Mets had an actual name and were listed in standings and box scores as &quot;Metropol&#x27;n&quot; as opposed to &quot;New York.&quot; Initially the team played its games in Brooklyn and in Hoboken, New Jersey as the other New York area clubs did at the time. However, by September, Day had arranged the use of a polo field just north of Central Park in Manhattan, bounded by 5th &amp; 6th Avenues and 110th &amp; 112th Streets. The site became known as the Polo Grounds because polo was initially played there. The Polo Grounds was the first professional baseball park in Manhattan.

The club name, &quot;Metropolitan&quot;, had previously been used by an amateur club that played its home games in the Hamilton Square neighborhood of New York as early as 1858.

===Joining the American Association===
The National League had expelled the Mutual Club of New York following the 1876 season for failing to make their final road trip of the year and by 1881 had still not replaced them with another New York City franchise. The upstart American Association therefore saw a significant opportunity when it invited the Metropolitan to join the new league for its 1882 inaugural season. Metropolitan declined, however, since joining would have meant forgoing lucrative home exhibition games against National League opponents.

Because of Metropolitan&#x27;s financial success at the Polo Grounds, and because each league knew that it needed a successful New York City franchise to compete against the other, at the end of 1882 both leagues tendered franchise offers to the Mets. Unbeknownst to the leagues, though, the Mets accepted both invitations. To satisfy these commitments, owners Day and Mutrie acquired the Troy franchise that had been eliminated from the National League (along with Worcester) to make room for new franchises in New York City and Philadelphia. Day and Mutrie entered the Mets into the American Association and a newly created New York team into the National League. The teams shared use of the Polo Grounds, which was reconfigured with two diamonds and two grandstands.

The club&#x27;s name &quot;Metropolitan&quot; was used in published standings of the Association, while the name &quot;New York&quot; was used for the National League entry. In the style of the day, the clubs were often called the &quot;Metropolitans&quot; and the &quot;New Yorks&quot;. The &quot;New Yorks&quot; would eventually acquire the separate nicknames of the &quot;Gothams&quot; and then the &quot;Giants&quot;. The Metropolitan club was referred to alternately as the &quot;Metropolitan,&quot; &quot;Metropolitans&quot; or the &quot;Mets&quot;. They were also referred to, on occasion, as the &quot;Indians&quot;.

==American Association successes==
Initially, managed by Mutrie, the Metropolitans enjoyed greater success on the field than the Gothams. The Mets finished fourth in , and won the American Association pennant. The Mets then faced Providence Grays of the National League in the 1884 World Series, but lost 3 games to none. Prominent Metropolitan players included Tim Keefe, Dave Orr, Chief Roseman, Jack Lynch, Candy Nelson and Dude Esterbrook.

A baseball oddity occurred for the Mets on April 30, 1885, when a man whose first name was not recorded played third base for them. With the Mets playing the Philadelphia Athletics at Polo Grounds I in Manhattan, a man listed only as &quot;Jones&quot; played as third baseman for the Metropolitans in his first game in the AA; an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that &quot;A new man covered third base for the local team. He is an amateur, and gave his name as &quot;Jones.&quot;&quot; The Metropolitans lost to the Athletics 2–1. Jones&#x27;s first name, date of birth, birthplace, and handedness were not recorded, and are still unknown.

===Demise===
Financially, though, the Gothams had more promise due to the National League&#x27;s stability, quality of play, and higher ticket prices. As early as 1884, the Mets were struggling to establish their own identity, and opened the season in a new ballpark, Metropolitan Park, located on the east side of Manhattan. The move proved unsatisfactory, and by mid-season they had quietly moved back to their original Polo Grounds home.

Prior to the 1885 season, Mutrie shifted over to manage the Gothams and brought along star pitcher Keefe and third baseman Esterbrook. The rechristened New York Giants finished second in the National League in 1885, while the Mets slumped to seventh place in the AA.

Prior to the 1886 season, Day and Mutrie sold the Mets to developer Erastus Wiman who moved the team to the St. George Cricket Grounds on Staten Island. Wiman, who also owned a ferry line, hoped to promote ferry trade across New York Harbor and further development of Staten Island. This business plan did not succeed, though, and the Mets ceased operation following the 1887 season. The team was bought by the Brooklyn Dodgers for $15,000 to gain territorial protection and the contracts of several of the Mets&#x27; stars, including Dave Orr and Darby O&#x27;Brien. The former minor league Staten Island Yankees played from 2001–2019 in a stadium very near the cricket ground used by the Mets.

==Present-day Mets==
In 1962, when the National League added a franchise in New York to replace the departed Giants and Dodgers, the owners and the fans of New York selected &quot;Mets&quot; as the nickname for the new club, in part to suggest continuity with the Metropolitans; its original formal name was the &quot;New York Metropolitan Baseball Club.&quot; These 20th-century New York Mets played their first two seasons at the final version of the Polo Grounds before it was ultimately torn down in 1964, when the Mets moved to Shea Stadium. They currently play in Citi Field, which was built next to the now-demolished Shea Stadium and opened in 2009.

<doc id="770811" wikidata="Q2047062" url="?curid=770811" title="Marius of Britain">
<text>Marius was a legendary king of the Britons during the time of the Roman occupation of Britain, as recounted in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s pseudohistorical &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. He came to power in 96AD. He was the son of King Arvirargus and ruled following his father&#x27;s death.

According to Geoffrey, he ruled wisely in the time when the Picts first arrived in Britain. A fleet of ships under the leadership of Sodric came from Scythia and landed in Albany. Once there, they began to destroy the lands and Marius was forced to react. Following numerous battles, Marius killed Rodric and set up a stone there to remember that triumph. In addition, that land became known as Westmorland after him. In respect for the people he defeated, he gave them a small portion of Albany called Caithness to live in. Marius refused, however, to give them women to marry so the Picts fled to Ireland and took wives there.

Marius established close ties with Rome and good diplomacy through tribute and respect of the Roman citizens in Britain. He followed the laws of his ancestors and ruled justly. When he died, he was succeeded by his son, Coilus.

<text>Ned Washington (born Edward Michael Washington, August 15, 1901 – December 20, 1976) was an American lyricist born in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

==Life and career==
Washington was nominated for eleven Academy Awards from 1940 to 1962. He won the Best Original Song award twice: in 1940 for &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; in &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and in 1952 for &quot;High Noon (Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin&#x27;)&quot; in &quot;High Noon&quot;.

Washington had his roots in vaudeville as a master of ceremonies. Having started his songwriting career with &quot;Earl Carroll&#x27;s Vanities&quot; on Broadway in the late 1920s, he joined the ASCAP in 1930. In 1934, he was signed by MGM and relocated to Hollywood, eventually writing full scores for feature films. During the 1940s, he worked for a number of studios, including Paramount, Warner Brothers, Disney, and Republic.

During these tenures, he collaborated with many of the great composers of the era, including Hoagy Carmichael, Victor Young, Max Steiner, and Dimitri Tiomkin.

With Leigh Harline, he contributed most of the melodic songs that distinguished the &quot;Pinocchio&quot; soundtrack, including &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot;.

He also served as a director of the ASCAP from 1957 until 1976, the year he died of a heart ailment.

Washington is a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame. His grave is located in Culver City&#x27;s Holy Cross Cemetery. He was posthumously honored as a Disney Legend, in 2001.

<text>Iolani Barracks, or hale koa (house [of] warriors) in Hawaiian, was built in 1870, designed by the architect Theodore Heuck, under the direction of King Lot Kapuaiwa. Located directly adjacent to Iolani Palace in downtown Honolulu, it housed about 80 members of the monarch&#x27;s Royal Guard until the overthrow of the Monarchy in 1893. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 as part of the Hawaii Capital Historic District.

==Design==
The structure clearly hearkens to the architecture of medieval castles of Europe with its crenelated parapets and towers. It was constructed with 4,000 coral block walls from the same limestone source used to build Kawaiahao Church and the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace and has a slate roof. It is surrounded by rooms once used by the guards as a mess hall, kitchen, dispensary, berth room, and lockup. Iolani Barracks was originally built a block behind (&quot;mauka&quot;, or inland of) Iolani Palace, where the Chiefs Children&#x27;s School used to situate.
==1873 Barracks Revolt==
On September 6, 1873, growing tensions between the enlisted men and the officers resulted in a mutiny after the Hungarian Captain Joseph Jajczay sent four men to the brig for deserting their post guarding the treasury. On the 6th, Jajczay returned from church to the barracks and was attacked by his own soldiers and the prisoners. When Adjutant General Charles Hastings Judd tried to calm the situation he was also attacked. The mutineers took control of the ʻIolani Barracks and later retrieved and loaded two cannons from near the palace. Authorities decided to wait out the mutiny by surrounding the barracks, but did not attack. On the 9th, King Lunalilo interviewed the mutineers and issued an offer to them; 13 agreed and surrendered. 
The Hungarian-born Jajczay was replaced by native Hawaiian Major William Luther Moehonua.

On the 12th, the 24 remaining mutineers agreed to another offer by the king granting full amnesty to end the mutiny. After this revolt, Lunalilo disbanded the Hawaiian Army; it was not restored until King Kalākaua came to power.

==Post-Monarchy==

After the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893, the Royal Guard were paid their month&#x27;s salary and disbanded. The barracks was used on several occasions as the headquarters of the National Guard of Hawaii. The building was used as temporary shelter for victims of the 1899 Chinatown fire. It also housed government offices and at one point served as a warehouse.

In 1965, the structure was moved, stone by stone, to its current location to make room for the Hawaii State Capitol. Today, the building serves as a visitors center for Iolani Palace and houses a gift shop, ticket office, video theater, and membership office.

<doc id="770822" wikidata="Q1147148" url="?curid=770822" title="Stampede Corral">
<text>The Stampede Corral was a multi-purpose venue (ice hockey, professional wrestling, rodeo, tennis) in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Located on the grounds of Stampede Park, the arena was completed in 1950 at a cost of C$1.25 million ($ million today) to replace Victoria Arena as the home of the Calgary Stampeders minor professional hockey club (not to be confused with the present-day Canadian Football League team of the same name), which hosted their Western Hockey League games for years. The Corral was built and owned by the not-for-profit Calgary Exhibition &amp; Stampede organization, which leased the underlying land at $1/year from the city of Calgary. Seating 6,475, plus standing room, it was used during the annual Calgary Stampede, with a variety of entertainment events in each year&#x27;s daily ENMAX Corral Show.

In March 2016, the Calgary Stampede organization announced plans to demolish the Stampede Corral to make way for a $500 million expansion of the adjacent BMO Centre. Stampede officials said that the Corral was no longer up to code, and would not have been worth the expense to renovate it. Demolition began in December 2020 and was completed in 2021.

At the time of construction, the Stampede Corral was the largest arena in Canada west of Toronto, and the first in the region without support columns obscuring the lines of sight. It was officially opened on December 15, 1950. The first hockey game was held at the Corral on December 26, as the Stampeders defeated the Edmonton Flyers 5–0 in a Western Canada Senior Hockey League game before a standing-room-only crowd of 8,729. Musicians from across the province played at the Corral in its lifespan, including Joni Mitchell, Loverboy, and Tegan and Sara.

The Stampede Corral hosted several major events, including the 1972 World Figure Skating Championships, the figure skating and ice hockey events at the 1988 Winter Olympics, as well as rodeo competitions. The Corral was also a frequent venue for the Canada Davis Cup team, with Canada holding a 5–0 all-time record in the Corral in this international tennis challenge. Most recently, Canada defeated Mexico 4–1 in the 2008 tournament.

For years, the Stampede Corral played host to special wrestling supershows promoted by Stu Hart&#x27;s Stampede Wrestling, particularly during the Calgary Stampede. Stampede Wrestling is known for having featured some of the biggest names in pro wrestling history prior to its purchase by the World Wrestling Federation (now known as WWE) in 1984, including Bret Hart, Archie Gouldie, Dan Kroffat and Jake Roberts. WWE also used the Corral numerous times for non-televised house shows.

On November 21, 2016, the last Disney On Ice show was cancelled at the last minute. No reason was cited for the cancellation, although Disney offered refunds.

The Stampede Corral housed one of Canada&#x27;s most extensive private sports photo collections on public display – part of the Calgary Stampede Archives collection. A significant restoration of the photo collection, taking two years and costing over $75,000, was underway in 2016.

<text>Robert Beno Cialdini (born April 27, 1945) is an American psychologist. He is the Regents&#x27; Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Marketing at Arizona State University and was a visiting professor of marketing, business and psychology at Stanford University.

==Education==
Cialdini received his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee in June 1967. He then went on to Graduate studies in Social Psychology at the University of North Carolina and earned his PhD in June 1970 and received postgraduate training in social psychology at Columbia University. He has held visiting scholar appointments at Ohio State University, the University of California, the Annenberg School of Communications, and the Graduate School of Business of Stanford University. Currently, Cialdini is Regents&#x27; Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Marketing at Arizona State University.

==Work==
Cialdini wrote the 1984 book on persuasion and marketing, &quot;Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion&quot;. It was based on three &quot;undercover&quot; years applying for and training at used car dealerships, fund-raising organizations, and telemarketing firms to observe real-life situations of persuasion. He found that influence is based on six key principles: reciprocity, commitment and consistency, social proof, authority, liking, scarcity. In 2016 he proposed a seventh principle. He called it the unity principle. The more we identify ourselves with others, the more we are influenced by these others.

The book has sold over five million copies and has been translated into 41 languages. It has been listed on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list and &quot;Fortune&quot; lists it in their &quot;75 Smartest Business Books&quot;. It is mentioned in &quot;50 Psychology Classics&quot;.

One of Cialdini&#x27;s other books, &quot;Yes! 50 Scientifically Proven Ways to Be Persuasive&quot;, was a &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller; and another of his books, &quot;The Small BIG: Small changes that spark a big influence&quot;, was a &quot;Times&quot; Book of the year. In 2016, Cialdini published &quot;Pre-suasion&quot;, which became a New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller.

The Robert B. Cialdini prize from the Society for Personality and Social Psychology is named after him in honor of psychological research that demonstrates societal relevance using field methods. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in April 2019.

==Projects==
Cialdini was hired alongside many other behavioral scientists for the Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2012. He also advised in the early stages of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016.

<doc id="770828" wikidata="Q810947" url="?curid=770828" title="Battersea Park">
<text>Battersea Park is a 200-acre (83-hectare) green space at Battersea in the London Borough of Wandsworth in London. It is situated on the south bank of the River Thames opposite Chelsea and was opened in 1858.

The park occupies marshland reclaimed from the Thames and land formerly used for market gardens. The park is Grade II* listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

==History==
Prior to 1846, the area now covered by the park was known as Battersea fields, a popular spot for duelling. On 21 March 1829, the Wellington–Winchilsea duel took place when the Prime Minister Duke of Wellington and the Earl of Winchilsea met on Battersea fields to settle a matter of honour. When it came time to fire, the duke aimed his duelling pistol wide and Winchilsea fired his into the air. Winchilsea later wrote the duke a groveling apology.

Separated from the river by a narrow raised causeway, the fields consisted of low, fertile marshes intersected by streams and ditches with the chief crops being carrots, melons, lavender (all the way up to Lavender Hill) and the famous &#x27;Battersea Bunches&#x27; of asparagus.

Running along the riverside from the fields were industrial concerns and wharves, including a pottery, copper works, lime kiln, chemical works, and, increasingly, railways. The site of Battersea Power Station was partly occupied by the famously bawdy Red House Tavern, patronised by Charles Dickens. Access was via the rickety wooden Battersea Bridge or by ferry from the Chelsea bank.

In 1845, spurred partly by the local vicar and partly by Thomas Cubitt, the builder and developer, whose yards were across the river in the still marshy and undeveloped area of Pimlico, a bill was submitted to Parliament to form a royal park of 320 acres. The Battersea Park Act 1846 (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. 38) was passed in 1846 and £200,000 was promised for the purchase of the land. The Commission for Improving the Metropolis acquired 320 acres of Battersea fields, of which 198 acres became Battersea Park, opened in 1858, and the remainder was let on building leases.

The park was laid out by Sir James Pennethorne between 1846 and 1864, although the park which was opened in 1858 varied somewhat from Pennethorne&#x27;s vision.

The park&#x27;s success depended on the successful completion of the Chelsea Bridge, declared open in 1858 by Queen Victoria. In her honour, the road alongside the eastern edge of the park was called Victoria Road, linked to Queens Road by Victoria Circus (now Queen&#x27;s Circus). Victoria Road and Queens Road later became Queenstown Road. Prince of Wales Road (now Prince of Wales Drive) was laid out along the southern boundary and Albert Bridge Road constructed along the western side. The park came under the management of the newly formed London County Council in 1889.

The park hosted the first exhibition football game played under the rules of the recently formed Football Association on 9 January 1864. The members of the teams were chosen by the President of the FA (A. Pember) and the Secretary (E. C. Morley) and included many well-known footballers of the day.

From the 1860s, the park was home to the leading amateur football team Wanderers F.C., winners of the first FA Cup, in 1872. The park also hosted the historic London v Sheffield football match in March 1866.

In 1924, the 24th Division War Memorial by Eric Kennington was unveiled by Field Marshal Lord Plumer and the Anglican Bishop of Southwark Cyril Garbett. It commemorates the over 10,000 men killed or listed as &quot;missing presumed dead&quot; whilst serving with the British Army&#x27;s 24th Division. It is now Grade II* listed.

During both wars, anti-aircraft guns and barrage balloons were installed to help protect London from enemy air raids. Shelters were dug, part of the park was turned over to allotments for much needed vegetables and a pig farm was also set up. Maintenance of the park was reduced as the war effort took priority.

On 16 September 1978, Battersea Park hosted a big punk rock concert featuring The Stranglers and several guests, among them Peter Gabriel and The Skids. &quot;The Stranglers booked some strippers to up the show&#x27;s visual aspect,&quot; recalled photographer Barry Plummer. &quot;But some of the lads in the audience got a bit carried away and also stripped completely naked. Eventually the police were called and took down all of the young ladies&#x27; particulars.&quot;

British artist Marion Coutts recreated Battersea, along with Regent&#x27;s and Hyde Park as a set of asymmetrical ping-pong tables for her interactive installation &quot;Fresh Air&quot; (1998–2001).

The 1996 film &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; was filmed at Battersea Park; it stands in for St James Park.

== The Festival Gardens ==
In 1951 the northern parts of the park were transformed into the &quot;Pleasure Gardens&quot; as part of the Festival of Britain celebrations. As well as a new water-garden and fountains, new features included a &quot;Tree-Walk&quot;, which consisted of a series of raised wooden walkways linked by tree house-like platforms suspended between the branches of a number of trees.

Popular attractions included the Guinness Clock, designed by Jan Le Witt and George Him, and the Far Tottering and Oyster Creek Branch Railway.

==Battersea Funfair==

Another part of the transformation was the addition of Battersea Funfair, with roller coasters, swings, roundabouts and other attractions.

The funfair&#x27;s leading attraction was the roller coaster ride, known as The Big Dipper, which opened in 1951. It was of wooden construction and suffered a major fire in 1970. It was closed after five children were killed and 13 injured in the Battersea Park funfair disaster on 30 May 1972 when one of the trains became detached from the haulage rope, rolling back to the station (the anti-rollback mechanism having failed) and colliding with the other train.

After the closure, the &quot;Jetstream&quot; ride was sold to Trusthouse Forte, the then owners of Belle Vue Zoological Gardens in Manchester. A night scene at the funfair, which was ghostly and empty, featured in the opening title scene for the 1960s television series &quot;Journey to the Unknown&quot;.
The site of the funfair was levelled and became a site for travelling fairs and exhibitions, and is the site of &quot;Battersea Evolution&quot;, formerly the &quot;Battersea Park Events Arena&quot;, which hosts exhibitions, conferences and Christmas parties.

==Current features in the park==
The park is home to a small children&#x27;s zoo, a boating lake, a bandstand, and all-weather outdoor sporting facilities including tennis courts, a running track and football pitches. Four West London hockey teams use the all-weather Astroturf pitches, including the Wanderers Hockey Club.

In the centre of the park is Pump House Gallery, which is housed in a four-storey Grade II listed Victorian tower. It is owned by Wandsworth Council.

On the western side there are two cricket pitches, home to the King&#x27;s Road Cricket &amp; Social Club. The club, whose members wear distinctive orange caps, can be seen playing on Saturdays and Sundays.

The park is the site of the London Peace Pagoda, erected in 1985. A Buddhist monk looks after the pagoda on a daily basis. A replica of the bronze statue of a dog that was the focal point of the historic vivisection-related Brown Dog affair was erected here in 1985. It was moved in 1994 to the Woodland Walk, near the Old English Garden.

In 2002–4 the park underwent a £11 million refurbishment funded in part by the Heritage Lottery Fund and was re-opened on 2 June 2004 by Prince Philip.

In 2007, a Dog Walk of Fame was inaugurated in the park.

The Winter Garden, next to Albert Bridge Road, was commissioned by the Friends of Battersea Park and designed by Dan Pearson Studios. It was opened by Mayor Boris Johnson on 3 March 2011, at which he unveiled a plaque designed by Steve Bunn of the RCA Sculpture School.

In 1871, James Robert Pulham constructed &quot;Waterfalls, Rocky stream, [and a] Cave for shady seat on the peninsula and in other parts of the Park&quot; in his patented anthropic rock Pulhamite. It was the first example of this unique rock landscape in a London Park. The waterfalls have not been running into the lake since the 1980s due to natural degradation and difficulties with providing energy to the pumps. 

In 2011, a sculpture commemorating the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, &quot;After 9/11&quot;, was unveiled by the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson.

In 2012, the park hosted one of the seven national Foodies Festivals on 17–19 August. Masterclasses were performed by chefs such as Levi Roots and Ed Baines, with burlesque shows, restaurant tents, city beaches and pop-up cinemas.

==Battersea Park Nature Areas==
A narrow strip along the eastern edge of the park and two smaller nearby areas have been designated the Battersea Park Nature Areas Local Nature Reserve, with an area of three hectares. They have a variety of woodland bird species including blackcap and bullfinch. There are 20 species of butterfly and several of stag beetle. Other invertebrate species include the hoverfly &quot;Volucella zonaria&quot;.

<doc id="770834" wikidata="Q1570942" url="?curid=770834" title="Tacoma Dome">
<text>The Tacoma Dome is an indoor multi-purpose arena in Tacoma, Washington, United States. It is located south of Downtown Tacoma, adjacent to Interstate 5 and Tacoma Dome Station. It is currently used for basketball tournaments by the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA), concerts, and other community events. In its early years, it was primarily used as a venue for minor league ice hockey and indoor soccer, and later temporarily hosted professional teams from Seattle.

==History==

Proposals to build a domed stadium in Tacoma were submitted to voters in various ballot measures in 1967, 1972, and 1976, but were all rejected. Following the completion of the Kingdome in Seattle, campaigners in Tacoma pushed for &quot;a dome of our own&quot;; a 1980 vote on a $28 million bond measure was approved and funded the construction of the Tacoma Dome. Construction began on July 1, 1981, at a site near Interstate 5; sites near Cheney Stadium and in downtown were also considered. The city planned to lure a National Hockey League team to the new stadium, but were unable to find a professional sports team to occupy the dome. It was designed by local architects McGranahan and Messenger, who won an international design competition, and cost $44 million to construct. It opened on April 21, 1983, with 25,000 people attending the opening ceremonies.

At in diameter and in height, the arena seats 20,722 for basketball games, with a maximum capacity of 21,000. It was the largest arena with a wooden dome in the world by volume at the time of its opening; the Superior Dome in Marquette, Michigan, opened in 1991 with a larger-diameter geodesic dome at , but is high and seats a maximum of 16,000. The dome&#x27;s roof weighs ; some of the planks that form the roof were sourced from felled timber following the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. Unlike most other arenas of its size, the arena contains little in the way of fixed seating, so as to maximize the flexibility of the seating arrangements and the shape of the playing field. It can also host American football, albeit with seating reduced to 10,000.

The dome&#x27;s first event was a concert by American singer/actor Rick Nelson and the Stone Canyon Band as part of the Dome&#x27;s opening festivities on April 24, 1983. The stadium&#x27;s turf was replaced in 1992 and 2006. The stadium has not had a professional team as a tenant since 2002, attributed in part to the lack of amenities and luxury boxes, while a newer arena in Kent hosts the Seattle Thunderbirds of the WHL and the reincarnation of the Tacoma Stars. Several new performing venues in the area, including KeyArena and the White River Amphitheatre, also lured away touring artists who would have used the Dome.

A report to the city in 2000 identified the need for private suites, larger concourses, and modern locker and dressing rooms as key issues for the Dome. A $42 million renovation plan, which included a new &quot;grand entrance&quot;, larger concessions, a loading dock, and luxury suites, was proposed by a city-contracted consultant in 2004. A bond issue to fund the renovation, which would require 60 percent of voters in favor, was approved in September 2005 but failed to meet the minimum turnout to validate the election. A second attempt in the February 2006 special election failed after receiving only 55 percent approval.

During a Monster Jam event at the Tacoma Dome in January 2009, a piece of debris from a truck flew into the stands during a freestyle performance, killing a six-year-old spectator and injuring another spectator. This is so far the only fatality to occur at a Monster Jam event.

On February 2, 2016, the Tacoma Dome started new security procedures in light of its sold-out AC/DC concert. The new enhancements included metal detector wands at each entrance, a bag size restriction, the prohibition of backpacks, and the search of all bags before entry. In November 2016, the City of Tacoma approved a two-year, $21.3 million renovation project. The renovations took place over the summer of 2018, with the cost rising to $30 million, and were completed on October 8, 2018. The renovations cost $32 million; among the new features were wider seats throughout the arena, showgoers having 6 inches of extra legroom and replacing the bench seating in the upper level.

==Tenants==
===Indoor soccer===

The first professional team to move into the Tacoma Dome were the Tacoma Stars of the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL); the stadium was the largest in the league, with seating for 20,284 in its indoor soccer configuration. The seventh and final game of the 1987 MISL Championship Series was played in front of 21,728 spectators at the Tacoma Dome, setting a league attendance record. The Dome also hosted the 1988 MISL All-Star Game on February 17, 1988, which drew 17,241 in attendance.

===Soccer===

The first professional soccer game to be played at the Tacoma Dome was a EuroPac Cup match between the Seattle Sounders and Internacional from Brazil. The Sounders lost 2–1 in front of 6,340; the stadium&#x27;s capacity was set at 19,000 for soccer. The team also bid for a lease to play their indoor season at the Dome, but lost to the Tacoma Stars.

The final match of the 1986 College Cup, the NCAA championship tournament for men&#x27;s soccer, was hosted at the Tacoma Dome on December 13, 1986. The Duke Devils won 1–0 against the Akron Zips and clinched their first national title in front of 4,652 spectators. The turf surface at the Dome was uneven and patched with electrical tape; it was later criticized as &quot;no place to play a championship game&quot; by Akron coach Steve Parker and &quot;dangerous&quot; by Duke midfielder Joey Valenti.

The second-division Seattle Sounders played several soccer matches at the Dome during their inaugural season in the American Professional Soccer League in 1994 before moving to Memorial Stadium in Seattle.

===Basketball===

The championship game of the NCAA Division I women&#x27;s basketball tournament (known as the Women&#x27;s Final Four) was hosted at the Tacoma Dome in 1988 and 1989. The latter was the first to be played in the same metropolitan area as the men&#x27;s Final Four, which was hosted by the Kingdome in Seattle.

The Seattle SuperSonics played their first exhibition game at the Tacoma Dome on October 9, 1983, and lost 117–98 to the Portland Trail Blazers. The stadium was configured with a maximum capacity of 22,000 for NBA games. The team played four regular season games in Tacoma during the 1983–84 season and averaged 11,852 in attendance, greater than in the Kingdome. The Sonics played four regular season games at the Dome during the 1984–85 season, but announced in April 1985 that they would not return for the following season to focus on their move to the Seattle Center Coliseum.

The Sonics relocated to Tacoma for 41 home games during the 1994–95 season while the Seattle Center Coliseum underwent extensive renovations to become KeyArena (now Climate Pledge Arena). The Dome was later used for Sonics games during other seasons and was offered by the city as a replacement for KeyArena during the team&#x27;s relocation negotiations in 2006. The Seattle Storm of the WNBA played an exhibition game at the Tacoma Dome in 2002 and a playoff game in 2013 that had been moved from KeyArena due to a scheduling conflict.

===1990 Goodwill Games===

The Dome was also the venue of ice hockey, gymnastics, and figure skating events during the 1990 Goodwill Games.

===American football===

It was the site of the NCAA Division I-AA football championship game in 1985 and 1986. The venue also hosted Seattle Seahawks scrimmages and an annual rivalry game between the Pacific Lutheran University and the University of Puget Sound, both based in the Tacoma area. A trophy for the rivalry game, unveiled in 2021, depicts the Tacoma Dome and the city skyline.

The short-lived Tacoma Express, a semi-professional American football team playing in the Minor League Football System, played an exhibition game against the Moscow Bears of the Soviet Union American Football League on July 2, 1990. The Express won 61–0 against the Bears, whose roster included rugby players and track-and-field athletes, in front of 1,303 spectators; it was the first time that a Soviet Union football team had played in the United States. The team had planned to play their regular season games at the Tacoma Dome, but were unable to afford the venue and moved to the Stadium Bowl.

===Ice hockey===

Several professional and junior ice hockey teams have also played at the Tacoma Dome. The Tacoma Rockets of the WHL played at the Dome from 1991 to 1995, but relocated to Kelowna, British Columbia, after finding the stadium unsuitable. The Tacoma Sabercats of the WCHL debuted on November 1, 1997, at the Dome, which underwent minor renovations to better accommodate ice hockey. The main grandstand&#x27;s first three rows were raised to improve sightlines, the Plexiglass barrier around the rink was replaced with seamless glass panels, and seating capacity was reduced to 9,500. The Sabercats had strong attendance, but ceased operations in 2002.

The Tacoma Dome also hosted National Hockey League preseason exhibition games in 1983, 1984, 1988, 1992, and 1996. Plans to attract an NHL team to the venue were made in the 1980s and 1990s, but were unsuccessful.

===Lacrosse===

The Premier Lacrosse League played four games at the Tacoma Dome over a two-day weekend in August 2022 as part of their fourth traveling season. The National Lacrosse League had previously considered an expansion team at the Tacoma Dome in 2006, but also solicited other bids from arenas in the Puget Sound region.

===High school sports===

The Tacoma Dome has hosted the Washington state championships for high school basketball, organized by the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA), since 1985; it was the first site nationwide to hold both boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; tournaments simultaneously. The WIAA also held the state championship games for high school football at the Tacoma Dome starting in 1995, having held the games at the Kingdome in Seattle beforehand; it elected to move the games out of the Tacoma Dome in 2019, citing rising costs and diminished sight lines inflicted by the 2018 renovations.

==Art==

The city government allocated $280,000 from the construction budget of the Tacoma Dome to furnish the arena with public art under its percent for art program. Among the five finalists was Andy Warhol&#x27;s adaption of his &quot;Flowers&quot; series, which would have painted a single orange flower on the roof. The city&#x27;s art commission endorsed a proposal by sculptor Stephen Antonakos to install abstract, neon-lit shapes on the dome&#x27;s roof. It was rejected in 1982 by the city council in April 1982 due to concerns about the neon tubes&#x27;s effects on the wooden roof and public outcry over the design.

A modified version of &quot;Neons for the Tacoma Dome&quot;, consisting of four indoor panels that measure up to with abstract shapes in neon, was announced in early 1984. The city council approved the purchase of &quot;Neons&quot;, but a public opposition group named &quot;No Neon&quot; petitioned the Pierce County Superior Court for an injunction to halt further spending on the commission. The injunction was denied and the group instead gathered signatures to decide the issue in a citywide election. &quot;Neons&quot; was installed over the Tacoma Dome&#x27;s southeast and northeast exits and unveiled to the public on July 31, 1984.

During the primary election on September 18, 74 percent of voters rejected an advisory question that would have endorsed the use of Antonakos&#x27;s artwork in the Tacoma Dome. The city council voted in December to approve the installation of &quot;Neons&quot;, but allow tenants to decide whether to light the sculpture. The precent for arts ordinance was repealed by voters in the November 1985 election.

==Naming rights==

The Tacoma city government considered selling the naming rights for the Dome on several occasions to pay for renovations or other amenities that would attract a major league team. In 2002, the city hired a consultant to explore naming rights deals for various public facilities, including the Tacoma Dome, that would fund repairs and renovations. A ten-year naming rights deal with Comcast or a local Toyota dealership was proposed the following year by the consultants after discussions with various companies. Comcast emerged as the frontrunner and offered $3.5 million for the ten-year term in addition to free advertising on cable television that would be of equivalent value. The company pulled out of the deal for the proposed &quot;Comcast Dome&quot; in December 2003, ahead of a city council vote and amid public backlash over the removal of &quot;Tacoma&quot; from its name.

An offer to sell naming rights to city-owned Tacoma Power for $1.25 million annually was rejected in 2009 after a search for a city-inclusive name. The city began soliciting new bids for a marketer in 2013 to search for naming rights sponsor, but the two submitted proposals were rejected for being too costly.

<doc id="770835" wikidata="Q7866989" url="?curid=770835" title="USS Acadia">
<text>&quot;Acadia&quot; (AD-42) was a in the service of the United States Navy, named after Acadia National Park. She was inactive and in reserve after her 1994 decommissioning at Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility (NISMF), Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, under maintenance category B, until sunk off Guam during a live-fire training exercise (Valiant Shield) on 20 September 2010.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Acadia&quot; was ordered on 11 March 1976, laid down on 14 February 1978 at San Diego, California, by National Steel and Shipbuilding Company, launched on 28 July 1979, sponsored by Mrs. Clarence R. Bryan, wife of Vice Admiral Clarence R. Bryan, and commissioned on 6 June 1981.

== Service history ==

=== 1981–1987 ===
&quot;Acadia&quot; completed her outfitting at her builder&#x27;s yard on 6 July and then made the brief trip to Naval Station San Diego. After a month clearing details and getting ready, the destroyer tender embarked upon her shakedown cruise on 7 August. That voyage took her to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and back to San Diego where she arrived on 28 August. When the ship returned to her home port, her crew concentrated their efforts on honing their skills as repairmen; and, except for a few brief periods at sea for underway training and propulsion plant certification, &quot;Acadia&quot; spent the rest of the year in port at San Diego.

The destroyer tender began 1982 as a fully operational mobile repair facility of the Pacific Fleet. She provided her services at San Diego until the beginning of February when she moved to the Naval Air Station, Alameda. At the end of the month, she steamed back to San Diego. Late in May, the ship embarked Naval Academy and NROTC midshipmen for their summer training cruise. On 14 June, &quot;Acadia&quot; stood out of San Diego on her way to Hawaii. The destroyer tender repaired ships of the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor from 22 June to 25 July. Returning to San Diego in August, she spent the remainder of the year in the immediate vicinity of her home port. Though she put to sea occasionally for training purposes, the majority of the time, she was in San Diego doing repair work for the fleet.

In December 1982, &quot;Acadia&quot; began preparations for the first overseas assignment of her career. On 4 January 1983, the destroyer tender put to sea for a journey to the Orient, the Indian Ocean and the east coast of Africa. &quot;Acadia&quot; stopped at Pearl Harbor between 12 and 14 January and, after another ten days at sea, arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 24 January. &quot;Acadia&quot; remained at Yokosuka for almost a month then visited Sasebo before setting a course for the Philippines on 23 February. The ship entered Subic Bay, Luzon on 27 February and performed repairs until 3 March when she put to sea for duty in the Indian Ocean. She reached the British outpost on Diego Garcia Island on 13 March and worked at that location for 16 days. On 29 March, &quot;Acadia&quot; headed for the east coast of Africa. She visited Mombasa, Kenya from 4 to 11 April, called at Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, between 13 and 16 April, and paused overnight at Masirah, an island off the coast of Oman near the Horn of Africa, on 22 and 23 April. The destroyer tender returned to the base at Diego Garcia on 29 April and spent the next month there repairing warships on duty in the troubled waters of the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf.

On 2 June 1983, &quot;Acadia&quot; departed Diego Garcia on her way to Pattaya, Thailand. The ship arrived at Pattaya on 11 June. For the rest of the deployment, she operated in Far Eastern waters proper. From Pattaya, she steamed back to Subic Bay where she provided repair services to ships of the US 7th Fleet during the latter part of June. During July, &quot;Acadia&quot; called at Hong Kong, Pusan in Korea, and at Sasebo, Japan. On 16 July, the destroyer tender stood out of Sasebo on her way back to the United States. She took the usual break in the transpacific voyage at Pearl Harbor between 27 and 29 July and reentered San Diego harbor on 4 August.

&quot;Acadia&quot; remained at San Diego for about two months after her return from the Orient. Post-deployment stand down consumed the first month, but she got back to work providing repair service during the second. Near the middle of October, the destroyer tender voyaged north to Bremerton, Washington, where she carried on her duties until 4 November. Returning south by way of San Francisco, &quot;Acadia&quot; reached San Diego again on 12 November. She resumed repair work at San Diego upon her return and remained so occupied through the end of 1983 and well into 1984. In fact, the ship did not get underway again until late in March 1984 when she put to sea for three days in the southern California operating area. She returned to port on 23 March and resumed repair work until June. During the week of 11 to 18 June, &quot;Acadia&quot; made the round-trip to Monterey and back. In July, she participated in a midshipman summer training cruise and, in August, carried out refresher training in the local operating area. During the remaining months of 1984, the destroyer tender concentrated on repair work and preparations for her second deployment overseas.

&quot;Acadia&quot; embarked upon the voyage to the Far East on 5 January 1985. She stopped over in Pearl Harbor from 12 to 14 January and then resumed her journey west. Steaming by way of Guam, the destroyer tender arrived in Subic Bay on 2 February. She conducted repairs there for about a week and voyaged to Hong Kong for a port visit. The ship returned to Subic Bay during the latter part of February and stayed there until 8 March. At that time, she headed for Japan. During March, she called at Sasebo and at the Korean ports of Pusan and Chinhae. On 28 March, the tender returned to Japan at Yokosuka. &quot;Acadia&quot; spent the remainder of her tour of duty with the 7th Fleet at Yokosuka carrying out an extremely heavy schedule of repairs on warships assigned to that fleet. On 12 June, she set out upon the voyage home. &quot;Acadia&quot; stopped at Pearl Harbor as usual and pulled into San Diego on 3 July. After a month of leave and upkeep, the destroyer tender began preparations for her first regular overhaul. On 16 September, she moved to the former Southwest Marine Shipyard (now owned by BAE Systems, and renamed BAE Systems San Diego Ship Repair) in San Diego where she underwent repairs until mid-December.

Holiday leave and upkeep occupied the last half of December 1985, but &quot;Acadia&quot; launched into a full schedule of repair services in January 1986. Except for occasional brief periods at sea and a port visit to San Francisco in June, she remained at San Diego until September. Early in the month, she put to sea for refresher training and, on the 28th, embarked upon the passage to Alameda. &quot;Acadia&quot; arrived at the Naval Air Station, Alameda, on 1 October and began a busy six weeks of repair work there. The destroyer tender returned to San Diego in the middle of November and spent the remainder of 1986 in preparations for overseas movement.

Although originally slated to deploy in January 1987, &quot;Acadia&quot; provided repair services to ships in the San Diego area into the spring. On 14 April, the tender sailed for the western Pacific, and after touching at Pearl Harbor (21 – 22 April) and Subic Bay (8 – 18 May), was en route to Diego Garcia when she was rerouted to the Persian Gulf.
An Iraqi Mirage F.1 had attacked and severely damaged the guided missile frigate on 17 May 1987. The crippled ship had limped into Bahrain, where &quot;Acadia&quot; was dispatched soon thereafter. Between 1 and 27 June, &quot;Acadia&quot; provided berthing, messing, and repair services to &quot;Stark&quot;, &quot;doing what she [&quot;Acadia&quot;] was designed to do, providing forward deployed support and battle damage repair...&quot;

=== 1987–1994 ===

On 5 September 1990 the ship departed San Diego for the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. She was responsible for the first reload of shipboard Tomahawk missiles outside the continental United States while pierside in Mina Jebel Ali. The reload recipient was the 

This was the first wartime deployment of a mixed male-female crew on a U.S. Navy combat vessel with just over one-third of her crew being women. During this time, the ship was branded as the &quot;love boat&quot; when 36 of the crew&#x27;s women (about 10%) discovered that they were pregnant. They were transferred off the ship due to a navy rule that required pregnant women be stationed within six hours of an obstetrician. Nine of the women had been already but unknowingly pregnant when the ship left port and five more were transferred in while unknowingly pregnant. The final 22 either became pregnant with a fellow crewmember, despite a prohibition on sexual relationships while deployed, or while on shore leave when the ship stopped in Hawaii, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. A US Navy spokesperson at the time defended the ship&#x27;s crew, noting that the ship&#x27;s &quot;pregnancy rate [was] lower than the civilian average—16%—for the age group of 20 to 24 year olds, and it [was] about half what the Navy would expect to see among its female population&quot;.

On 30 October 1990, the amphibious assault ship sustained a catastrophic mechanical failure when a high-pressure steam valve burst. This cost the lives of ten of her crew but repairs kept her fully operational for Operation Desert Storm after six weeks of repairs by &quot;Acadia&quot;.

On 18 February 1991, the guided missile cruiser struck two influence mines in the Persian Gulf just forward of her after gun mount during Operation Desert Storm, resulting in a cracked superstructure, a jammed port rudder and leaking port shaft seal. Despite severe damage to her stern, her forward weapon systems and Aegis combat system were back online within 15 minutes. &quot;Princeton&quot; remained on station for 30 hours until relieved. Repairs performed by &quot;Acadia&quot; in the Mina Jebel Ali near Dubai took five weeks, after which &quot;Princeton&quot; returned to the United States under her own power for additional repairs. &quot;Acadia&quot; returned to San Diego at the end of her deployment and received the Navy Unit Commendation for her service during the Gulf War.

In the summer of 1993, &quot;Acadia&quot; conducted sea trials which earned her two Battle Es for warship preparedness prior to her pending deployment to the Western Pacific and Persian Gulf. In early November 1993 she got underway with a crew of around 1,500 was now half female. &quot;Acadia&quot; proceeded to Hawaii, then to Guam for supplies before setting course for Hong Kong. Plans called for her to visit Singapore and then the Persian Gulf, but because of ongoing tensions in Mogadishu, Somalia, &quot;Acadia&quot; received orders to divert to Somalia way to her way to the United Arab Emirates. She encountered Typhoon Kyle in the South China Sea before she called briefly at Singapore for mail and personnel exchange. She then set out for Bali, conducting &quot;Acadia&quot;′s last crossing of the equator en route. &quot;Acadia&quot; visited Bali for rest and recreation, her crew&#x27;s last scheduled time ashore for over a month.

&quot;Acadia&quot; arrived off Mogadishu during the first week of December 1993. Upon arrival, a seaman from the Boats and Cranes Division of the Deck Department was knocked overboard while lowering the ship&#x27;s stairwell. The waters were known to be shark-infested as fishing vessels and fish factory ships frequently dumped their byproducts in the ocean. Fortunately, the seaman was rescued quickly by rescue swimmers and a small boat &quot;Acadia&quot; launched.

&quot;Acadia&quot; delivered overdue medical, dental, supply, and repair services to United States Marine Corps and U.S. Navy personnel that in Mogadishu by conducting boat runs operated by the Boats and Cranes Division. Many of the U.S. personnel ashore had been without running water for days or weeks and obviously were worn out by their duties ashore. To brighten the spirits of U.S. personnel ashore, &quot;Acadia&quot;′ crew created a choir to perform for Christmas, adding comical flare by rewording the &quot;Twelve Days of Christmas&quot; to reflect their time underway and presence in Mogadishu. The ship continued to support personnel at Mogadishu until 30 December 1993, when she got underway for the Strait of Oman and the United Arab Emirates, where she operated in support of U.S. Navy surface ships and submarines for three weeks. Her final voyage home involved calls at Hong Kong; Sasebo and Yokosuka, Japan; Guam; and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, before arriving a San Diego in mid-April 1994. After their return, &quot;Acadia&quot; and her crew received the Joint Forces Armed Expeditionary Medal and a bronze star on their Southwest Asia Service Medal.

==Decommissioning and fate==
On 16 December 1994, &quot;Acadia&quot; was decommissioned and laid up at the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility (NISMF), Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. She was struck from the Naval Register on 13 December 2007 and used as a target off Guam as part of a day-long bombardment of ordnance delivered from naval aircraft and ships during exercise Valiant Shield on 19–20 September 2010. She sank on 20 September 2010.

<text>In New Zealand politics, Māori electorates, colloquially known as the Māori seats (), are a special category of electorate that give reserved positions to representatives of Māori in the New Zealand Parliament. Every area in New Zealand is covered by both a general and a Māori electorate; as of 2020, there are seven Māori electorates. Since 1967, candidates in Māori electorates have not needed to be Māori themselves, but to register as a voter in the Māori electorates people need to declare that they are of Māori descent.

The Māori electorates were introduced in 1867 under the Maori Representation Act. They were created in order to give Māori a more direct say in parliament. The first Māori elections were held in the following year during the term of the 4th New Zealand Parliament. The electorates were intended as a temporary measure lasting five years but were extended in 1872 and made permanent in 1876. Despite numerous attempts to dismantle Māori electorates, they continue to form a distinct part of the New Zealand political system.

== Organisation ==
Māori electorates operate much as do general electorates, but have as electors people who are Māori, or of Māori descent, (&quot;see &quot;) and who choose to place their names on a separate electoral roll rather than on the &quot;general roll&quot;.

There are two features of the Māori electorates that make them distinct from the general electorates. First, there are a number of skills that are essential for candidates to have in order to engage with their constituencies and ensure a clear line of accountability to representing the &#x27;Māori voice&#x27;. This includes proficiency in , knowledge of , skills and confidence on the . Second, the geographical size of the Māori electoral boundaries vary significantly from the general electorates. Five to 18 general electorates fit into any one Māori electorate.

Māori electoral boundaries are superimposed over the electoral boundaries used for general electorates; thus every part of New Zealand simultaneously belongs both in a general seat and in a Māori seat. Shortly after each census all registered Māori electors have the opportunity to choose whether they are included on the Māori or general electorate rolls. Since 31 March 2023, Māori electors have been able to change rolls at any time, except in the three months preceding a general or local election or after a notice of vacancy is issued for a by-election. Each five-yearly census and Māori Electoral Option determines the number of Māori electorates for the next one or two elections.

==Establishment==

The establishment of Māori electorates came about in 1867 during the term of the 4th Parliament with the Maori Representation Act, drafted by Napier member of parliament Donald McLean. Parliament passed the act after lengthy debate, and during a period of warfare between the government and some North Island Māori hapū and was seen as a way to reduce conflict between cultures. Its primary aim was to enfranchise Maori who were indirectly excluded from parliament by the land ownership requirement. To vote, a person had to be male, a subject of the monarch, have title to land of at least 25 pounds, and not be in prison. Very few Maori qualified because of the property qualification - the land they owned was held in common and not by Crown grant: native title was not acceptable. Concern was raised that, indirectly, this ran contrary to section III of the Treaty of Waitangi which made all Maori subjects of the monarch with corresponding voting and representation rights. The act originally agreed to set up four electorates specially for Māori; three in the North Island and one covering the whole South Island. The four seats were a fairly modest concession on a per-capita basis at the time. Some MPs, such as James FitzGerald, regarded the concessions given to Māori as insufficient, while others disagreed. In the end, the setting up of Māori electorates separate from existing electorates assuaged the conservative opposition to the bill. The bill was intended as a temporary measure, giving specific representation to Māori until the land ownership issue was resolved. However, the Maori seats continued to become a permanent feature of the New Zealand parliament.

The first four Māori members of parliament, elected in 1868, were Tāreha Te Moananui (Eastern Maori), Frederick Nene Russell (Northern Maori) and John Patterson (Southern Maori), who all retired in 1870; and Mete Kīngi Te Rangi Paetahi (Western Maori) who was defeated in 1871. These four men were the first New Zealand-born members of the New Zealand Parliament. The second four members were Karaitiana Takamoana (Eastern Maori); Wi Katene (Northern Maori); Hōri Kerei Taiaroa (Southern Maori); and Wiremu Parata (Western Maori).

The first Māori woman MP was Iriaka Rātana, who represented the Western Maori electorate. Like Elizabeth McCombs, New Zealand&#x27;s first woman MP, Rātana won the seat in a by-election caused by the death of her husband Matiu in 1949.

===Elections===
Currently Māori elections are held as part of New Zealand general elections, but in the past such elections took place separately, on different days (usually the day before the vote for general electorates) and under different rules. Historically, less organisation went into holding Māori elections than general elections, and the process received fewer resources. Māori electorates at first did not require registration for voting, which was later introduced. New practices such as paper ballots (as opposed to casting one&#x27;s vote verbally) and secret ballots also came later to elections for Māori electorates than to general electorates.

The authorities frequently delayed or overlooked reforms of the Māori electoral system, with Parliament considering the Māori electorates as largely unimportant. The gradual improvement of Māori elections owes much to long-serving Māori MP Eruera Tirikatene, who himself experienced problems in his own election. From the election of 1951 onwards, the voting for Māori and general electorates was held on the same day.

Confusion around the Māori electorates during the 2017 general election was revealed in a number of complaints to the Electoral Commission. Complaints included Electoral Commission staff at polling booths being unaware of the Māori roll and insisting electors were unregistered when their names did not appear on the general roll; Electoral Commission staff giving incorrect information about the Māori electorates; electors being given incorrect voting forms and electors being told they were unable to vote for Te Pāti Māori (the Māori Party) unless they were on the Māori roll.

===Switching between rolls===
In June 2022, the Justice Minister Kris Faafoi of the incumbent Labour Party introduced a bill to allow people of Māori descent to switch between the general and Māori electoral rolls at any time. At the time, Māori were only allowed to switch between the two rolls every five years. To pass into law, the bill needed 75% majority support in Parliament. In addition, Māori Party co-leader Rawiri Waititi introduced a member&#x27;s bill which proposed automatically placing Māori on the Māori electoral roll and renaming the &quot;general electoral district&quot; the &quot;non-Māori electoral district.&quot; 

On 15 November 2022, the opposition National Party abandoned its opposition to the Māori Electoral Option bill after the Labour Government agreed to allow people of Māori descent to switch between the general and Māori rolls at any time except the three month period before general and local elections; giving the Government the 75% majority need to pass the bill into law. Te Pāti Māori criticised the compromise, with Waititi and fellow co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer describing the changes as &quot;second-rate&quot; and a &quot;half pie ka pai&quot; respectively. Waititi&#x27;s member bill had already been voted down in early November.

The Electoral (Māori Electoral Option) Legislation Act 2022 came into force on 31 March 2023; allowing people of Māori descent to switch between the general and Māori rolls at anytime until the three month period before elections. The Electoral Commission subsequently launched a campaign to encourage non-voters to register with either the general or Māori rolls. For the 2023 New Zealand general election, the cutoff date was set at midnight 13 July 2023. By 3 July 2023, over 12,000 people had switched between the Māori and general rolls; with 6,662 people shifting from the general to Māori rolls and 5,652 switching vice versa. Political expert and academic Dr Rawiri Taonui and journalist Tommy de Silva described that the increase of voters on the Māori roll as a form of strategic voting that reinforced the relevance of the Māori seats and Māori vote to New Zealand politics.

==Calls for abolition==
Periodically there have been calls for the abolition of the Māori electorates. The electorates aroused controversy even at the time of their origin, and given their intended temporary nature, there have been a number of attempts to abolish them. The reasoning behind these attempts has varied – some have seen the electorates as an unfair or unnecessary advantage for Māori, while others have seen them as discriminatory and offensive.

=== Early 20th century ===
In 1902, a consolidation of electoral law prompted considerable discussion of the Māori electorates, and some MPs proposed their abolition. Many of the proposals came from members of the opposition, and possibly had political motivations – in general, the Māori MPs had supported the governing Liberal Party, which had held power since 1891. Many MPs alleged frequent cases of corruption in elections for the Māori electorates. Other MPs, however, supported the abolition of Māori electorates for different reasons – Frederick Pirani, a member of the Liberal Party, said that the absence of Māori voters from general electorates prevented &quot;pākehā members of the House from taking that interest in Māori matters that they ought to take&quot;. The Māori MPs, however, mounted a strong defence of the electorates, with Wi Pere depicting guaranteed representation in parliament as one of the few rights Māori possessed not &quot;filched from them by the Europeans&quot;. The electorates continued in existence.

Just a short time later, in 1905, another re-arrangement of electoral law caused the debate to flare up again. The Minister of Māori Affairs, James Carroll, supported proposals for the abolition of Māori electorates, pointing to the fact that he himself had won the general electorate of Waiapu. Other Māori MPs, such as Hōne Heke Ngāpua, remained opposed. In the end, proposals for the abolition or reform of Māori electorates did not proceed.

=== Mid-20th century ===
Considerably later, in 1953, the first ever major re-alignment of Māori electoral boundaries occurred, addressing inequalities in voter numbers. Again, the focus on Māori electorates prompted further debate about their existence. The National Party government of the day had a commitment to the assimilation of Māori, and had no Māori MPs, and many believed that they would abolish the electorates. However, the government had other matters to attend to, and the issue of the Māori electorates gradually faded from view without any changes. Regardless, the possible abolition of the Māori electorates appeared indicated when they did not appear among the electoral provisions entrenched against future modification. In the 1950s the practice of reserving electorates for Māori was described by some politicians &quot;as a form of &#x27;apartheid&#x27;, like in South Africa&quot;.

In 1967, the electoral system whereby four electorate seats were reserved for representatives who were specifically Māori ended. Following the Electoral Amendment Act 1967, the 100-year-old disqualification preventing Europeans from standing as candidates in Māori electorates was removed. Simultaneously, the act allowed Māori to stand in general electorates. Since 1967, therefore, there has not been any electoral guarantee of representation by candidates who have Māori descent. While this still means that those elected to represent Māori electors in the Māori electorates are directly accountable to those voters, those representatives are not required to be Māori themselves.

In 1976, the National Government introduced the option for Māori to decide whether to enrol individually on the general electoral roll or the Māori roll. A large number of people (Māori and non-Māori) failed to fill out an electoral re-registration card that was distributed with the 1976 census, with census staff lacking authority to insist on the card being completed. This had little practical effect for non-Māori, but it transferred Māori to the general roll if the card was not handed in. Only 40% of the potential population registered on the Māori roll. This reduced the number of calls for the abolition of Māori electorates, as many presumed that Māori would eventually abandon the Māori electorates of their own accord.

=== Current positions ===
A number of currently active political parties oppose, or have opposed, the existence of Māori electorates.

==== National Party ====
The National Party has advocated abolition of the Māori electorates, though the party is not opposed to the seats. National did not stand candidates in Māori electorate from the 2005 election through the 2020 election. Bill English, the party&#x27;s leader in 2003, said that &quot;the purpose of the Māori seats has come to an end&quot;, and in 2004 party leader Don Brash called the electorates an &quot;anachronism&quot;. National announced in 2008 it would abolish the electorates when all historic treaty settlements have been resolved, which it aimed to complete by 2014. In 2014 though, then-Prime Minister John Key ruled out the abolition, saying he would not do it even if he had the numbers to do so as there would be &quot;hikois from hell&quot;. In 2020, party leader Judith Collins announced that &quot;I am not opposed to the Māori seats. The National Party has had a view for many years now that they should be done away with. But I just want people to feel that they all have opportunities for representation&quot;. In 2021, it was revealed that the National Party intended to run candidates in Māori electorates in the next general election.

==== ACT Party ====
The ACT Party opposes the Māori electorates. Its leader, David Seymour, has called for their abolition as recently as 2019. Hobson&#x27;s Pledge, a lobby group founded by former ACT Party leader Don Brash, advocates abolishing the allocated Māori electorates, seeing them as outdated.

==== New Zealand First ====
New Zealand First, whose &quot;Tight Five&quot; once held all Māori seats, has advocated for abolition of the separate electorates, while emphasising that the decision should be made by Māori voters. During the 2017 election campaign, the New Zealand First leader Winston Peters announced that if elected his party would hold a binding referendum on whether Maori electorates should be abolished. During post-election negotiations with the Labour Party, Peters indicated that he would consider dropping his call for a referendum on the Māori electorates due to the defeat of the Māori Party at the 2017 election. In return for forming a government with the Labour Party, New Zealand First agreed to drop its demand for the referendum.

The party has not stood candidates in the Māori electorates since the 1999 New Zealand general election.

==Individual electorates==

From 1868 to 1996, four Māori electorates existed (out of a total that slowly changed from 76 to 99). They comprised:
# Eastern Maori
# Northern Maori
# Southern Maori
# Western Maori
With the introduction of the MMP electoral system after 1993, the rules regarding the Māori electorates changed. Today, the number of electorates floats, meaning that the electoral population of a Māori seat can remain roughly equivalent to that of a general seat. For the 1996 election, the first under MMP, the Electoral Commission defined five Māori electorates: 
# Te Puku O Te Whenua (&quot;The belly of the land&quot;)
# Te Tai Hauauru (&quot;The western district&quot;)
# Te Tai Rawhiti (&quot;The eastern district&quot;)
# Te Tai Tokerau (&quot;The northern district&quot;)
# Te Tai Tonga (&quot;The southern district&quot;)

Major changes were made and a sixth Māori electorate was added for the second MMP election in 1999:
# Hauraki
# Ikaroa-Rawhiti
# Te Tai Hauāuru
# Te Tai Tokerau
# Te Tai Tonga
# Waiariki

Since 2002, there have been seven Māori electorates. For the 2002 and 2005 elections, these were:
# Ikaroa-Rāwhiti
# Tainui
# Tāmaki Makaurau (roughly equivalent to greater Auckland)
# Te Tai Hauāuru
# Te Tai Tokerau
# Te Tai Tonga
# Waiariki

From 2008, Tainui was largely replaced by Hauraki-Waikato, giving the following seven Māori electorates:
# Hauraki-Waikato – north-western North Island, including Hamilton and Papakura
# Ikaroa-Rāwhiti – eastern and southern North Island, including Gisborne and Masterton
# Tāmaki Makaurau – southern and central Auckland, and parts of western Auckland
# Te Tai Hauāuru – western North Island, including Taranaki and Manawatū-Whanganui regions
# Te Tai Tokerau – northernmost seat, including Whangārei, northern Auckland and parts of western Auckland
# Te Tai Tonga – all of the South Island, Stewart Island / Rakiura, Chatham Islands, and most of Wellington. Largest electorate by area.
# Waiariki – includes Tauranga, Whakatāne, Rotorua, Taupō

While seven out of 72 (9.7%) does not nearly reflect the proportion of voting-age New Zealanders who identify as being of Māori descent (about 14.8%), many Māori choose to enrol in general electorates, so the proportion reflects the proportion of voters on the Māori roll.

Former Māori Party co-leader Pita Sharples proposed the creation of an additional electorate, for Māori living in Australia, where there are between 115,000 and 125,000 Māori, the majority living in Queensland.

==Party politics==

As Māori electorates originated before the development of political parties in New Zealand, all early Māori MPs functioned as independents. When the Liberal Party formed, however, Māori MPs began to align themselves with the new organisation, with either Liberal candidates or Liberal sympathisers as representatives. Māori MPs in the Liberal Party included James Carroll, Āpirana Ngata and Te Rangi Hīroa. There were also Māori MPs in the more conservative and rural Reform Party; Maui Pomare, Taurekareka Henare and Taite Te Tomo.

Since the Labour Party first came to power in 1935, however, it has dominated the Māori electorates. For a long period this dominance owed much to Labour&#x27;s alliance with the Rātana Church, although the Rātana influence has diminished in recent times. In the 1993 election, however, the new New Zealand First party, led by Winston Peters – who himself held the general seat of Tauranga from 1984 to 2005 – gained the Northern Māori seat (electing Tau Henare to Parliament), and in the 1996 election New Zealand First captured all the Māori electorates for one electoral term. Labour regained the electorates in the following election in the 1999 election.

A development of particular interest to Māori came in 2004 with the resignation of Tariana Turia from her ministerial position in the Labour-dominated coalition and from her Te Tai Hauāuru parliamentary seat. In the resulting by-election on 10 July 2004, standing under the banner of the newly formed Māori Party, she received over 90% of the 7,000-plus votes cast. The parties then represented in Parliament had not put up official candidates in the by-election. The new party&#x27;s support in relation to Labour therefore remained untested at the polling booth.

The Māori Party aimed to win all seven Māori electorates in 2005. A Marae-Digipoll survey of Māori-roll voters in November 2004 gave it hope: 35.7% said they would vote for a Māori Party candidate, 26.3% opted for Labour, and five of the seven electorates appeared ready to fall to the new party. In the election, the new party won four of the Māori electorates. It seemed possible that Māori Party MPs could play a role in the choice and formation of a governing coalition, and they conducted talks with the National Party. In the end they remained in Opposition.

Similarly in 2008, the Māori Party aimed to win all seven Māori electorates. However, in the election, they managed to increase their four electorates only to five. Although the National government had enough MPs to govern without the Māori Party, it invited the Māori Party to support their minority government on confidence and supply in return for policy concessions and two ministerial posts outside of Cabinet. The Māori Party signed a confidence and supply agreement with National on the condition that the Māori electorates were not abolished unless the Māori voters agreed to abolish them. Other policy concessions including a review of the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004, a review of New Zealand&#x27;s constitutional arrangements, and the introduction of the Whānau Ora indigenous health initiative.

Discontentment with the Māori Party&#x27;s support agreement with National particularly the Marine and Coastal Areas Bill 2011 led the party&#x27;s Te Tai Tokerau Member Hone Harawira to secede from the Māori Party and form the radical left-wing Mana Movement. During the 2011 general election, the Māori Party retained three of the Māori electorates while Labour increased its share of the Māori electorates to three, taking Te Tai Tonga. The Mana Movement retained Te Tai Tokerau. Tensions between the Māori Party and Mana Movement combined with competition from the Labour Party fragmented the Māori political voice in Parliament.

In the 2014 election, Mana Movement leader Hone Harawira formed an electoral pact with the Internet Party, founded by controversial Internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom and led by former Alliance MP Laila Harré known as Internet MANA. Hone was defeated by Labour candidate Kelvin Davis, who was tacitly endorsed by the ruling National Party, New Zealand First, and the Māori Party. During the 2014 election, Labour captured six of the Māori electorates with the Māori Party being reduced to co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell&#x27;s Waiariki electorate. The Māori Party managed to bring a second member co-leader Marama Fox into Parliament as their party vote entitled them to one further list seat.

During the 2017 general election, the Māori Party formed an electoral pact with the Mana Movement leader and former Māori Party MP Hone Harawira not to contest Te Tai Tokerau as part of a deal to regain the Māori electorates from the Labour Party. Despite these efforts, Labour captured all seven of the Māori electorates with Labour candidate Tāmati Coffey unseating Māori Party co-leader Flavell in Waiariki.

Three years later, despite a historic landslide to the Labour party, Māori party candidate Rawiri Waititi successfully unseated Coffey, returning the Māori Party – now calling itself Te Pāti Māori – to Parliament. Special votes raised Te Pāti Māori&#x27;s party vote from a provisional result of 1% to a final party vote of 1.2%, thus allowing co-leader, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, to enter Parliament as a List MP.

Following the 2023 general election, Te Pāti Māori won a record six of the seven Māori electorates, unseating Labour from all but one of the seats.

== Influence outside New Zealand ==
The scheme has inspired some policymakers as a potential solution for underrepresented indigenous peoples.

===Australia===

In Australia, some have put forward the idea of dedicating seats to Aboriginal Australians. In 1983, Frank Walker, the New South Wales Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, proposed that each state send one Aboriginal senator to the federal parliament, and also the creation of four Aboriginal electorates for the NSW Legislative Assembly.

In 1995, MLC Franca Arena moved the Parliament of New South Wales to an inquiry and report on the idea of providing seats dedicated to people of Aboriginal background, modelled on the Māori electorates, to create opportunity for Indigenous representation in that parliament. The Standing Committee on Social Issues, of which she was not part, released a report on the merits of the system in November 1998. The report is said to have been well-researched, with a thorough discussion of the system&#x27;s mechanics, and through which paths it could come to fruition. The NSW Government members, however, did not conclude the proposal appropriate and leaned towards other measures to facilitate Aboriginal representation.

Another report was released in 2003 by the Legislative Assembly of Queensland&#x27;s Legal, Constitutional and Administrative Review Committee, inquiring how to help Indigenous self-determination. The idea of dedicated seats, however, although deemed to help reconciliation, was not suggested by the report because of strong opposition from some members of the committee.

<text>Interstate 271 (I-271) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway in the suburbs of Cleveland and Akron in the US state of Ohio. The highway is officially designated the Outerbelt East Freeway but is rarely referred to by that name by locals, instead simply referring to it as &quot;271&quot;.

==Route description==

I-271 begins at an interchange with I-71 in Medina Township to I-90 in Willoughby Hills, with an interchange with I-480 (and traveling concurrently with it for a short stretch). The width varies from point to point but is mostly four to six lanes wide south of I-480 and eight to twelve lanes wide north of I-480; there, it is divided into local–express lanes.

The local–express lanes begin at the southern interchange of U.S. Route 422 (US 422) and continue northward slightly beyond the end of I-271. The northbound express lanes allow access to all exits (excluding Chagrin Boulevard, Harvard Road, and State Route 175 (SR 175), a southbound-only exit). The southbound express lanes bypass all exits except for one combined exit for Chagrin Boulevard (west US 422), Harvard Road, Richmond Road (SR 175), and US 422 (east) interchange. The lanes then become the mainline of I-480N which in turn becomes I-480 westbound.

I-271 does not have a direct interchange with I-80/Ohio Turnpike—one of only a few examples of Interstate Highways that cross but do not intersect. The I-271/I-480 section was the only instance of a concurrency of two three-digit Interstate Highways in the nation until 2022, when a concurrency between I-587 and I-795, and I-840 and I-785 in North Carolina was established with the designation of I-587, I-785, and I-840. This is because I-80 was concurrent with I-271 until 1971, when I-80 was routed back on to the turnpike and replaced by I-480.

==History==

I-290 was to have followed the northern end of I-271. I-271 itself was to have followed I-480 and I-480N westward to I-71.

I-271&#x27;s express lanes were added between 1993 and 1995, with related projects continuing through 1998.

For many years, the interchange with SR 8 was only partially complete. The northbound exit and southbound entrance ramps connected with both directions of SR 8, but southbound I-271 could only access SR 8 southbound (though later both directions were accessible), and only northbound SR 8 could access I-271 northbound. To compensate for the missing movements, a half diamond was built at SR 82. The I-271/SR 8 interchange underwent reconstruction in 2008–2009 that turned it into a complete interchange allowing all movements.

Similarly, travelers going to and from the north on I-271 had to take surface streets to get to and from the west on I-480 in Cuyahoga County. This link is now covered by unsigned I-480N.

===I-271 rebuilding and widening program===

The need for the I-271 widening project between Miles Road and the Summit County line was identified in March 2002. I-271 will be widened from two to three lanes north and southbound between Miles Road and Columbus Road and from three to five lanes north and southbound between Columbus Road and the I-271/I-480 split near the Summit County line. Construction will last two years and includes replacement of the existing pavement, noise walls, lighting, and signing. A similar project to widen I-271 from two to three lanes will be constructed in Summit County between the Cuyahoga County line and SR 8 and will improve access to the Ohio Turnpike. That project is scheduled to begin in 2014 and be complete in 2016.

<text>The CDS – People&#x27;s Party (, derived from &quot;Centro Democrático e Social – Partido Popular&quot;, CDS–PP) is a conservative and Christian democratic political party in Portugal. It is characterized as being between the centre-right and right-wing of the political spectrum. In voting ballots, the party&#x27;s name appears only as the People&#x27;s Party, with the abbreviation CDS–PP unchanged.

The party was founded on 19 July 1974 during the Carnation Revolution. In its first democratic elections in 1975, the CDS-PP won 16 seats out of 230 – increasing to 42 in the 1976 legislative election. The party entered a short-lived coalition with the Socialist Party (PS) before joining the Democratic Alliance (AD). The party has been involved in centre-right coalitions with the Social Democratic Party (PSD) from 1980 to 1983 and again from 2002 to 2005. In the 2009 legislative election, the party won 21 seats, its most since the 1985 election, and increased it to 24 in 2011, leading to it forming a coalition government with the PSD.

The party is a member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) and the International Democracy Union (IDU). The party also has autonomous organisations which share its political beliefs, the People&#x27;s Youth and the Federation of Christian Democratic Workers.

After a disastrous result in the 2022 general elections, which left the party with no seats in the Assembly of the Republic for the first time ever since its founding, Francisco Rodrigues dos Santos resigned as president; he was replaced by MEP Nuno Melo in the 29th National Congress of the Party.

== History ==

=== Foundation ===
The CDS, Democratic Social Center, was founded on 19 July 1974 by Diogo Freitas do Amaral, Paulo Lowndes Marques, Adelino Amaro da Costa, Basílio Horta, Vítor Sá Machado, Valentim Xavier Pintado, João Morais Leitão and João Porto. By that time, Portugal was living an unstable political moment: instability, violence and great social tensions were evident after the Carnation Revolution held on 25 April of the same year. The then CDS declared itself as a party rigorously at the centre of the political spectrum, but by then it already counted with a major slice of Portuguese right-winger in its affiliations. On 13 January 1975, the leaders of CDS delivered at the Supreme Court of Justice the necessary documentation to legalise the party. The first congress was held on 25 January 1975, at the Rosa Mota Pavilion, Porto city, which was interrupted by a siege from far-left protesters.

=== First years of opposition ===
After 25 March 1975, a regime centred in social matters, state control of the economy and military leadership began its efforts to dominate the nation, which summed up with the COPCON (a post-revolutionary military organisation founded in 1974) and the constant attacks perpetrated on the western social democrat model, led the CDS to declare itself officially as an opposition party. Its 16 deputies cast the only votes against the Socialist-influenced Constitution of 1976, on 2 April. In the legislative election of 1976, the CDS achieved its objectives by having 42 deputies elected and so surpassing the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP).

=== The Democratic Alliance ===

In 1979, the CDS proposed a coalition with the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the People&#x27;s Monarchist Party (PPM). The proposal brought about the creation of the Democratic Alliance (AD), headed by Francisco Sá Carneiro, which won the general elections of 1979 and 1980.

In the AD governments, the CDS was represented by five ministers and ten state secretaries, with the president of the party, Diogo Freitas do Amaral, being nominated to the offices of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs (later nominated Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister).

On the night of 4 December 1980, Sá Carneiro and his Minister of National Defence, Adelino Amaro da Costa, were among those who died in a plane crash. Diogo Freitas do Amaral became caretaker prime minister until the formation of a new government, which Francisco Pinto Balsemão headed. This latter administration collapsed on 4 September 1981, after the resignation of Freitas do Amaral (both from the cabinet and from the party presidency). As a result, the Democratic Alliance ended.

=== An opposition of 20 years ===
After the collapse of the AD, the party looked for a new leader and new direction. Freitas do Amaral&#x27;s successor was Adriano Moreira, who, when having been unable to stop the party&#x27;s negative performance, did not stand for re-election. Freitas do Amaral returned as party president, during a period characterised by the electoral success of the PSD, Aníbal Cavaco Silva, to lead a rump of four deputies (later five) in parliament. Freitas do Amaral left the party in 1992.

In 1992, a new generation took over the party and in March of that year. At the party&#x27;s 10th Congress, the former president of the Centrist Youth (the then-youth organisation of the CDS), Manuel Monteiro, was elected to the presidency. A year later, at an extraordinary congress, the title People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Partido Popular&quot;) was added to the party&#x27;s official name in an effort to emulate the Spanish party of the same name.

In 1993, the CDS-PP was expelled from the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP), both for rejecting the Maastricht Treaty and therefore being not pro-integrationist enough and for not paying due membership fees.

The CDS-PP underwent an electoral recovery in the general election of 1995, electing 15 deputies. However, following poor electoral results in local elections in 1997, Manuel Monteiro resigned and was replaced at the party&#x27;s Braga congress by Paulo Portas who defeated Maria José Nogueira Pinto. Portas proposed a return to the party&#x27;s Christian democratic roots and set himself the challenge of keeping all 15 seats in parliament in the general election of 1999. This was accomplished.

=== The &quot;Democratic Coalition&quot; ===
After a massive electoral defeat in the 2001 local elections, the Socialist Party (PS) Prime Minister António Guterres resigned with a general election being held in early 2002. The PSD won a plurality, forcing them to enter into a coalition, 20 years after their previous coalition government with the CDS-PP. The CDS-PP gained three ministries: Paulo Portas as Minister of National Defence, Bagão Félix as Minister of Social Security and Celeste Cardona as Minister of Justice.

The CDS-PP contested the 2004 European election in a joint electoral list with the PSD called Forward Portugal (FP), retaining its 2 MEPs.

In the summer of 2004, PSD Prime Minister José Manuel Durão Barroso, resigned to become president of the European Commission and in order to avoid an early general election, President Jorge Sampaio invited Pedro Santana Lopes to form a new PSD/CDS-PP coalition government. Due to low popularity and what was seen as the inept handling of the country by the new prime minister, parliament was dissolved after just four months on 30 November 2004 and a new general election was scheduled for February 2005.

=== 2005 general election ===

In the 2005 legislative election, the CDS-PP obtained 7.2% of the vote and returning 12 deputies, losing two of its 14 deputies. The CDS-PP returned to opposition, with its coalition partner the PSD losing to the centre-left PS, whose leader José Sócrates became prime minister. This electoral failure for the CDS-PP, along with the defeat of the PSD led to Paulo Portas&#x27;s resignation as party leader and a congress to elect a new leader.

=== &quot;Portugal 2009&quot; ===
After the resignation of Paulo Portas, who had led the CDS-PP for seven years, two candidates then emerged: Telmo Correia and José Ribeiro e Castro, with the former being looked on as a favourite, following the line and style of Paulo Portas. However, José Ribeiro e Castro with his &#x27;Portugal 2009&#x27; platform was elected president of the CDS-PP. In May 2007, however, Paulo Portas was again elected as the leader of the party, amidst controversy.

The CDS-PP contested the 2009 European election in a standalone list, retaining its two MEPs with 8.4% of the vote.

In the 2009 legislative election, the party increased their share of the votes to 10.4% and won 21 seats, while remaining in opposition to Prime Minister José Sócrates.

=== Return to government in 2011 ===
In the 2011 legislative election, the CDS-PP increased its share of the vote yet again to 11.7%, returning 24 deputies. This, along with the victory of the PSD over the incumbent PS government, resulted in the CDS-PP joining a coalition government led by PSD leader and Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho, obtaining 5 ministries in the cabinet.

=== 2014 European elections ===
Th 2014 European election had the CDS-PP once again form a joint list with the PSD, this time called the Portugal Alliance. The list received 27.7% of the vote, second place behind the PS, and returned a single MEP for the CDS-PP.

=== 2015 general election and &quot;Portugal à Frente&quot; ===
The CDS-PP formed an alliance with the PSD ahead of the 2015 legislative election, called Portugal Ahead (&quot;Portugal à Frente,&quot; PàF) with PSD leader and Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho leading the coalition. The PàF coalition, however, lost 25 seats and the parliamentary majority, though they were still comfortably ahead of the Socialist Party by more than 20 seats. President Aníbal Cavaco Silva swore in Passos Coelho and his minority government, but ten days later the PàF government collapsed when the Communists, Greens and Left Bloc voted in favor of the Socialists&#x27; motion of no confidence. Socialist lead António Costa was sworn in as prime minister on 26 November in a minority government, thrusting PàF into opposition. Passos Coelho declared the end of the Portugal Ahead coalition 16 December.

=== 2019 European elections ===
The 2019 European election had the CDS-PP return to an individual list, rather than allying with the PSD. The CDS-PP again returned just a single MEP on 6.2% of the vote.

=== 2019 general election ===
Longtime leader Paulo Portas left the party&#x27;s leadership after 20 years in December 2015. In March 2016, Assunção Cristas, Portas&#x27;s chosen successor, was overwhelmingly elected leader of the party over Miguel Mattos Chaves. Cristas became the party&#x27;s first female leader. However, the subsequent legislative elections were disastrous for the party. The CDS-PP lost 13 of their previous 18 seats, leaving them with only five, and took less than 5% of the vote as António Costa&#x27;s Socialist government strengthened their position, but fell short of an absolute majority. Cristas resigned as CDS-PP as the election results became clear.

=== 2022 general election ===

A snap election was called for January 2022 after Costa&#x27;s budget was rejected when the Left Bloc and Communists joined the right-wing parties in voting against it. The party was led by Francisco Rodrigues dos Santos, the leader of People&#x27;s Youth, who narrowly won the 2020 leadership election. The election resulted in a surprise majority for Costa&#x27;s Socialists after tightening polls, and the CDS-PP lost their five remaining seats on just 1.6% and for the first time since the restoration of democracy returned no members of the Assembly. The party received just 86,578 votes, less than half of their 2019 total. The CDS-PP&#x27;s disastrous results were blamed partially on the rise of other right-wing parties, Liberal Initiative and Chega!, which both saw huge increases in support. Francisco Rodrigues dos Santos, then the president of the party, resigned on the very same night.

In the following congress, he was replaced by CDS&#x27;s single MEP, Nuno Melo.

=== 2024 general election and the new &quot;Democratic Alliance&quot;===
In November 2023, Prime Minister António Costa tendered his resignation after a series of police raids regarding an investigation around alleged corruption involving the award of contracts for lithium and hydrogen businesses, and, shortly after, a snap election was called for 10 March 2024. CDS–PP decided to contest the election in a joint alliance called &quot;Democratic Alliance&quot; (AD) alongside PSD and PPM. The AD coalition won by a slight margin over the Socialists, 29 to 28 percent, and formed a minority government. CDS–PP leader, Nuno Melo, became Defense minister. Three months later, in the 2024 European Parliament elections, the AD coalition was narrowly defeated by the Socialists, 31 to 32 percent.

== Ideology ==
A large ideological overlap exists between the CDS-PP and the Social Democratic Party (PSD). The CDS-PP&#x27;s original philosophy was based on Christian democracy, and it was originally positioned in the centre. A factional disagreement within the party between those that believed that the CDS-PP should be to the right of the PSD or in the political centre erupted. The party shifted in the early 1990s under the leadership of Manuel Monteiro. It still considers itself to be a centrist party. It has been also described as a national conservative party.

The party formerly had a pro-EU line, but switched under Monteiro, becoming mildly Eurosceptic, including opposing the Maastricht Treaty, with this change of policy credited for ending the party&#x27;s decline. As a result of the change, the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) expelled the CDS-PP from the EPP Group in the European parliament, with the CDS-PP joining the Union for Europe (UfE) group instead. Monteiro&#x27;s successor, Paulo Portas, continued the CDS-PP&#x27;s Eurosceptic line, but rejoined the EPP.

The CDS-PP has always strongly opposed the legalisation of abortion in Portugal and is officially an anti-abortion party. It had campaigned vigorously against the legalisation of abortion up to ten weeks in the 1998 referendum on abortion and in the 2007 referendum, where under the current law abortions are allowed up to 12 weeks if the mother&#x27;s life or mental or physical health is at risk, up to 16 weeks in cases of rape and up to 24 weeks if the child may be born with an incurable disease or deformity; whereas the new law proposal will allow abortions on request up to the tenth week. The CDS-PP has proposed what it considers to be responsible alternatives based on the &quot;right to life&quot; to solve the problem of illegal abortion and of abortion itself.

=== Political positions ===
Some of the party&#x27;s proposals include:
*Stronger immigration laws.
*Opposition to European federalism.
*Stronger relations with Brazil.
*Introducing a school voucher-based education system.
*A stronger stance on law and order issues.
*A substantial decrease in taxation.

==== Until 1991 ====
*Opposition to the MPLA regime of Angola and support for UNITA and RENAMO.
*Opposition to hard sanctions on South Africa.

=== Political support ===

In line with the two largest parties in Portuguese politics, but unlike the two far-left parties, the CDS-PP is a big tent party, with appeal across social and ideological groups. The party&#x27;s voters have a similar profile to the PSD. It has low voter loyalty, with voter retention historically being half the level of the three other largest parties.

The major issue on which the voter profile differs most significantly from the other parties is abortion, where those that identify as anti-abortion are significantly more likely to vote for the CDS-PP.

The CDS-PP receives a considerable amount of support amongst farmers in the north, as well as among entrepreneurs and managers.

=== International affiliations ===
The CDS-PP is a member party of the International Democracy Union (IDU) and European People&#x27;s Party (EPP). One MEP currently sits in the EPP Group in the European Parliament.

It was formerly a member of the European Union of Christian Democrats (EUCD), as well as the EUCD-affiliated EPP&#x27;s political group in the European Parliament, from 1986 to 1995. In 1995, the party –under the more Eurosceptic leadership of Manuel Monteiro– was kicked out of the EPP; it left the EUCD and joined the Union for Europe group in the European Parliament. In 2003, the party joined the European Democrats component of the European People&#x27;s Party–European Democrats (EPP–ED) group. In 2006, it left the European Democrats –now collapsing due to the formation of the Movement for European Reform– to join the EPP group proper.

<text>A trainer is a class of aircraft designed specifically to facilitate flight training of pilots and aircrews. The use of a dedicated trainer aircraft with additional safety features—such as tandem flight controls, forgiving flight characteristics and a simplified cockpit arrangement—allows pilots-in-training to safely advance their skills in a more forgiving aircraft.

Civilian pilots are normally trained in a light aircraft, with two or more seats to allow for a student and instructor.

==Tandem and side by side==
The two seating configurations for trainer aircraft are: pilot and instructor side by side, or in tandem, usually with the pilot in front and the instructor behind. The side-by-side seating configuration has the advantage that the pilot and instructor can see each other&#x27;s actions, allowing the pilot to learn from the instructor and the instructor to correct the student pilot. The tandem configuration has the advantage of being closer to the normal working environment that a fast jet pilot is likely to encounter.

It is now the norm for pilots to begin their flight training in an aircraft with side-by-side seating and to progress to aircraft with tandem seating. This, however, has not always been the case. For example, it was usual to find tandem seating in biplane basic trainers such as the Tiger Moth and the Jungmann, and the British used side-by-side seating in the operational conversion of some of its fast jets such as the English Electric Lightning.

==Phases==
Given the expense of military pilot training, air forces typically conduct training in phases to eliminate unsuitable candidates. The cost to those air forces that do not follow a graduated training regimen is not just monetary but also in lives. For example, for many years the Indian Air Force operated without a suitable advanced training aircraft, leading to a high casualty rate as pilots moved to high performance MiG-21 aircraft without suitable assessment of their aptitude for supersonic flight.

There are two main areas for instruction, flight training and operational training. In flight training a candidate seeks to develop their flying skills. In operational training the candidate learns to use their flying skills through simulated combat, attack and fighter techniques.

===Ab initio===

Typically, contemporary military pilots learn initial flying skills in a light aircraft not too dissimilar from civilian training aircraft. In this phase pilot candidates are screened for mental and physical attributes. Aircraft used for this purpose include the Slingsby Firefly, as at one time used by the United States Air Force Academy, and the Scottish Aviation Bulldogs of the RAF. The U.S. replaced the Firefly and the Enhanced Flight Screen Program (EFSP) with the Diamond DA20 and the Initial Flight Training (IFT) program. At the end of this stage, pilot trainees are assessed and those who pass advance to the full pilot training program. Those who are judged unsuitable for a pilot commission, but show other attributes, may be offered the chance to qualify as navigators and weapons officers. Smaller and more financially restricted air forces may use ultra-light aircraft, gliders and motor gliders for this role. The USAF Academy uses light piston-powered aircraft such as the Cirrus SR20 (designated T-53A) for basic cadet flight training.

===Basic training===
After the ab-initio phase a candidate may progress to basic, or primary, trainers. These are usually turboprop trainers, like the Pilatus PC-9 and Embraer Tucano. Modern turboprop trainers can replicate the handling characteristics of jet aircraft as well as having sufficient performance to assess a candidate&#x27;s technical ability at an aircraft&#x27;s controls, reaction speed and the ability to anticipate events. Prior to the availability of high performance turboprops, basic training was conducted with jet aircraft such as the BAC Jet Provost, T-37 Tweet, and Fouga Magister. Those candidates who are not suitable to continue training as fast jet pilots may be offered flying commissions and be trained to fly multi-engined aircraft.

===Advanced training===

Those that progress to training for fast jet flying will then progress to an advanced trainer, typically capable of high subsonic speeds, high-energy manoeuvers, and equipped with systems that simulate modern weapons and surveillance. Examples of such jet trainer aircraft include the supersonic Northrop T-38 Talon, Boeing–Saab T-7 Red Hawk, the BAE Hawk, the Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet, the Aero L-39 and Aero L-159, the Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Master, the KAI T-50 Golden Eagle, the Guizhou JL-9, the Pilatus PC-21 and the Yakovlev Yak-130.

Effective combat aircraft are a function now of electronics as much as, if not more so than, the aerobatic ability or speed of an aircraft. It is at this stage that a pilot begins to learn to operate radar systems and electronics. Modern advanced trainers feature programmable multi-function displays which can be programmed to simulate different electronic systems and scenarios. Most advanced trainers do not have radar systems of their own, but onboard systems can be programmed to simulate radar contacts. With datalinks and GPS, virtual radar systems can be created with similarly equipped aircraft relaying to each other their positions in real time and onboard computers creating a &quot;radar display&quot; based on this information. The aim of programmable displays is to speed pilot training by replicating as far as possible the systems a pilot will find in an operational aircraft.

===Lead-in fighter training===
Lead-in fighter training (LIFT) utilises advanced jet trainer aircraft with avionics and stores-management capability that emulate operational fighter planes, to provide efficient training in combat scenarios with reduced training costs compared to moving straight to operational conversion. The on-board avionics system may be linked to ground-based systems, and together they can simulate situations such as infrared or radar guided missile, interceptors, air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft batteries, radars, chaff and flare countermeasures and collision warnings, in low or dense electronic warfare environments. Systems may also be able to re-enact true-to-life combat situations.

===Operational conversion===

Most military jet-powered combat aircraft have two-seat trainer versions. These are combat capable operational conversion aircraft types to provide on the job training to pilots who have graduated to this level, and are usually available with little conversion in times of emergency to a reconnaissance or combat role. Most operational conversion aircraft retain the full functionality of the operational version with slight degradations to performance due to increased weight and drag, and possibly reduced range due to a reduced internal fuel load.

In some two-seat fighter aircraft such as the Tornado, the operational conversion unit (OCU) aircraft can be created by duplicating flight controls in the rear cockpit. In a normally single-seat aircraft, a second cockpit can be built behind the original cockpit (e.g. the TA-4S variant of the A-4SU Super Skyhawk) or the cockpit can be extended to place the instructor in a second seat behind the pilot. Once they are qualified to fly a specific type of aircraft, pilots will continue with regular training exercises to maintain qualifications on that aircraft and to improve their skills, for example the USAF&#x27;s &quot;Red Flag&quot; exercises. Deployments of small flights of aircraft together with support staff and equipment to exercises conducted by other nations can be used to develop fighting skills and interservice and inter unit competitions in bombing and gunnery between units can also be used to develop those skills.

The two-seat aircraft may itself become the basis of an operational aircraft, the second seat being used to create a weapons officer or navigators station in aircraft with originally only a pilot, for example the F-15E Strike Eagle is a development of the F-15D which is a two-seat training version of the F-15 Eagle.

In some air forces that have a mix of high- and low-performance aircraft, pilots can be first be assigned to aircraft with a lower level of performance before moving on to the most demanding aircraft. For example, in the Italian Air Force a pilot may begin his service career on the AMX attack aircraft, and as their experience grows, progress to more capable aircraft such as the Tornado IDS. Other air forces, such as Canada, do not do this, and assign first-tour pilots to aircraft such as the CF-18 Hornet.

===Multi-engine trainers===
Those pilots who train to fly transports, tankers and other multi-engine aircraft begin with small multi-engine aircraft such as the T-44A Pegasus variant of the Beechcraft King Air. Once they have mastered this, they may begin to fly in the right-hand seat of an operational type. Some air forces will seek to use a restricted number of multi-engined aircraft, with the derivatives of a basic aircraft filling different roles so that a pilot qualified on one of its types can easily convert to others in the same family. For example, the Boeing 707 was a popular airliner for conversion to tanker, transport and ELINT variants by numerous air forces.

===Navigation trainers===
A minority of military training aircraft, such as the Beechcraft 18, Vickers Varsity, Hawker Siddeley Dominie and Boeing T-43 were developed from transport designs to train navigators and other rear crews operators. As these navigational trainees are normally learning how to navigate using instruments, they can be seated at consoles within the aircraft cabin and do not require a direct view of the landscape over which the aircraft is flying. The operators of airborne weapons or radar-related systems can be similarly trained, either in training aircraft or in an operational aircraft during training flights.

==Aerobatic display teams==

Some jet trainers, such as the Aermacchi MB-339, Casa C-101, Folland Gnat, Fouga Magister and British Aerospace Hawk, are used by national formation aerobatic teams. Early jet aerobatic teams tended to use combat types such as the Hawker Hunter, English Electric Lightning, and North American F-100 Super Sabre. As air forces&#x27; combat fleets were scaled-down, it made sense for most national display teams to change to lighter training types. A few modifications may be needed to enable coloured smoke to be emitted during displays, but essentially these airframes can still perform their pilot training function.

== Combat use of trainers ==

In smaller air forces basic trainers, in addition to being used for training, are used to provide air support in the counter-insurgency and airborne forward air control role.

Most advanced trainers are capable of carrying and delivering war loads. However, most of these aircraft do not have the counter measures and sensors required to survive alone in a modern high intensity war fighting scenario, for example being vulnerable to MANPADS. However, they may still have a war fighting role in low intensity theatres if operated in conjunction with more capable aircraft.

Historically many jet trainers were marketed with specialised attack variants e.g. the BAC Jet Provost/BAC Strikemaster and the Cessna T-37 Tweet/A-37 Dragonfly. Especially against opponents operating without a fighter screen or an effective anti-aircraft capability, such trainer derived attack aircraft could perform adequately. For example, Impala aircraft derived from the Aermacchi MB-326 trainer formed the main strike strength of the South African Air Force in its Bush war, and aircraft such as the Hongdu JL-8 are being acquired for the attack role in low intensity theatres.

Despite their vulnerability, even small numbers of weapons-carrying trainer aircraft may achieve a disproportionate effect due to the element of surprise, especially when the attacked side believes to hold air supremacy. Forces that have used light trainer aircraft to great effect include the Biafran use of MFI-9s and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam use of covertly acquired light aircraft.

In high-intensity conflicts, advanced trainer type aircraft can have a military utility if they operate under an umbrella of other aerial assets. For example, the Franco-German Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet had an anti-shipping and light strike role when operating under an air umbrella provided by fighter aircraft, while the RAF planned to use pairs of gun- and AIM-9 Sidewinder-armed Hawk trainers in the point defence role. Each pair of Hawks was to be teamed with a Phantom FGR.2, in effect using the Phantoms as an Airborne Early Warning and Control system. Although never tested it was believed that the Hawk, combined with AIM-9L and flown by some of the best pilots in the RAF including those from the Red Arrows, would have made a viable air defence fighter.

==The future==
As the capabilities of front-line aircraft have increased, this has been reflected in increasingly sophisticated advanced trainers. As the costs of developing new aircraft have risen in real terms, it has become more likely that fewer aircraft will be designed specifically for the training role. The advanced trainer was often seen as a stepping stone by most nations in developing a fast jet design and manufacturing capability. With increasing costs, even major air forces will have difficulty reaching the economies of scale to justify development of new advanced trainers. Nations will be required to continue to push the modernisation of existing aircraft (some such as the Hawk dating from the 1970s) or co-operate in the development and procurement of advanced training aircraft. Furthermore, they must better utilise funding available by developing aircraft with an enhanced combat capability by producing operational single-seat variants, and better utilise aircraft on inventory incorporating operational systems either within the aircraft or as external pods.

The trend of programmable electronic systems and datalinks is likely to continue with the possibility that ground-based radar systems and processing systems will allow advanced training aircraft to function as if they truly had onboard radar systems, with the cockpit closely replicating the look and feel of an air force&#x27;s more capable aircraft for maximum familiarity. Programmable engine management and fly-by-wire flight control systems will allow an aircraft to mimic the flight characteristics of frontline aircraft with actual performance being restricted to a pilot&#x27;s level of ability, with more power and greater agility becoming available as a pilot&#x27;s skill improves.

Training is now also carried out on ground-based simulators.

==Historical==

Early trainers were often sport aircraft or obsolete combat aircraft. The French used a graduated system in which a pilot learned in progressively more capable aircraft, starting with aircraft that had been modified to prevent them from flying – called &quot;rouleurs&quot; or penguins.
Pilots who had mastered ground handling would then graduate to lower powered two seaters, before finishing on obsolete fighters. The supply of obsolete aircraft proved inadequate and production of Caudron G.III, Nieuport 83 and other types specifically for training was undertaken.
In the United Kingdom, a different training system was used, although it too started out with obsolete aircraft before the Avro 504 and Airco DH.6 became the primary trainers, supplemented until the end of the First World War with obsolete combat aircraft for advanced training. To train the many potential aviators coming from Canada and the US, the Royal Flying Corps Canada was set up, operating Curtiss JN-4 (Can) trainers until the United States began its own training program, using Curtiss JN-4s and Standard J-1s. In Germany, various obsolete two seaters were produced for training purposes, the most numerous being the Albatros C.III.

Between the World Wars, purpose built trainers covering a variety of specialties largely replaced obsolete types in the Western armed forces, including aircraft specifically for bombing and gunnery and navigational training. When Germany began rearming in the 1930s, many of the initial aircraft were designed with a dual role, so that when they were obsolete in their combat role they would be used as trainers. By World War II, however, their needs exceeded what could be spared from production and although using a number of purpose built designs such as the Bücker Bü 131, relied largely on captured aircraft and obsolete combat types.
The United States armed forces standardized on three types – a Primary trainer, of which the Stearman PT-13/PT-17 is the best known, a Basic trainer such as the Vultee BT-13, and an advanced trainer such as the well known North American AT-6 Texan, which would also be widely exported to the Commonwealth countries as the Harvard. In addition, production of various combat types was diverted to training although considerable effort was made to cover all possible types of training with purpose built types.
The British organized the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, which moved the bulk of aircrew training away from active war zones to Canada and elsewhere, where pilots started on the De Havilland Tiger Moth or Fleet Finch basic trainers before continuing on North American Harvards for advanced training, Avro Ansons, Airspeed Oxfords and Bristol Bolingbrokes for multi-engine as well as bombing training. Obsolete types such as the Fairey Battle and Westland Lysander were used for target towing, while other types such as the North American Yale were used for wireless operator (radio) training. Postwar, the United States operated the Beechcraft T-34 Mentor for basic flight training, while the United Kingdom operated the De Havilland Chipmunk. The North American T-28 Trojan replaced the T-6 in US service, while the Percival Provost filled a similar role with the RAF.

<text>USS &quot;Accelerate&quot; (ARS-30) was a salvage ship in the service of the United States Navy.

It was originally built as the steam-propelled mooring tender &quot;Toteco&quot; by Kyle &amp; Purdy, for International Petroleum. Either late in 1929 or early 1930, the vessel was renamed &quot;Walling&quot;.

==Service history==
===World War II, 1942–1946===
After the United States entered World War II, the Navy acquired her at New York City on 2 April 1942, classified her as a salvage vessel, ARS-30, on 11 April 1943, and simultaneously renamed her &quot;Accelerate&quot;. No conversion was deemed necessary to prepare it for Navy use. Between these last two events, it may have been used privately by the Merritt, Chapman, Scott Co. because the Navy accepted her back from the company on 5 September 1946.

Records on the ship&#x27;s naval career are scarce and in some matters confusing, if not contradictory. It appears that &quot;Accelerate&quot; was assigned to the 3rd Naval District throughout her service in the Navy. It was apparently operated under contract with the Navy by the Merritt, Chapman, and Scott Co. in waters near New York City. Some evidence exists indicating that the salvage vessel was placed in commission on 15 March 1945, but, if so, no logs of its service have been found, and no record of her decommissioning has survived.

===Disposal and sale===
The Navy declared the vessel surplus in February 1946 and its name was stricken from the Navy List on 7 February 1947. On 28 August 1947, the ship was transferred to the War Shipping Administration of the United States Maritime Commission for disposal.

The ship was sold in 1948 to C. Pateras and G. Glyptis of Venezuela. Soon renamed &quot;Marigo&quot;, it served several owners under the Venezuelan flag, bearing the names &quot;Marigo&quot; and &quot;George&quot;. In the late 1970s, it was registered as &quot;George&quot; and owned by Maritima Venezolana de Navegacion, S.A.

<doc id="770850" wikidata="Q3249497" url="?curid=770850" title="List of race horse trainers">
<text>Race horse trainers train horses for horse racing. This involves exercising, feeding, management and, in early years, to get them used to human contact.

Once a horse is old enough to be ridden, a trainer prepares a horse for races, with responsibility for exercising it, getting it race-ready by designing exercise routines tailored for each horse and its needs as well as determining which races it should enter. Leading horse trainers can earn a great deal of money from a percentage of the winnings that they charge the owner for training the horse. They typically collect 10% of the purse money won by the horses they are currently training. 

Outside horse racing, most trainers specialize in a certain equestrianism discipline. Some fields can be very lucrative, usually depending on the value of the horses one trains or prize money available in competition.

<doc id="770854" wikidata="Q3315673" url="?curid=770854" title="Levonorgestrel-releasing implant">
<text>Levonorgestrel-releasing implant, sold under the brand name Jadelle among others, are devices that release levonorgestrel for birth control. It is one of the most effective forms of birth control with a one-year failure rate around 0.05%. The device is placed under the skin and lasts for up to five years. It may be used by women who have a history of pelvic inflammatory disease and therefore cannot use an intrauterine device. Following removal, fertility quickly returns.
It is generally well tolerated with few significant side effects. Side effects may include irregular menstrual periods, no periods, headaches, and breast pain. Use is not recommended in people with significant liver disease. The levonorgestrel implant is a type of long-acting reversible birth control. It primarily works by stopping ovulation and by thickening the mucus around the cervix.
A levonorgestrel-releasing implant was approved for medical use in 1983 in Finland and in the United States in 1990. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Levonorgestrel implants are approved in more than 60 countries and used by more than seven million women. As of 2015 it is approved but not available in the United States.

== Medical uses ==

Levonorgestrel-releasing implant is 99–99.95% effective at preventing pregnancy, and is one of the most reliable, though not the most available, forms of birth control. Levonorgestrel-releasing implant prevents pregnancy through multiple methods: by preventing ovulation, which means that no eggs are released for fertilization; by thickening the mucus of the cervix, which prevents sperm from entering; and by thinning the lining of the uterus, which makes implantation of an embryo less likely.

The way in which levonorgestrel-releasing implant causes these effects is by use of hormones. A small amount of the hormone progestin is released through the capsules continuously, more during the first year and a half, but then at a level similar to most contraceptive pills afterward. Like all hormonal contraception, levonorgestrel-releasing implant does not protect against sexually transmitted infections.

Implantable contraceptives are especially effective in the developing world, as they do not require daily administration or access to a hospital to be effective. In addition, no continual contraceptive supplies (pills, condoms, etc.) are necessary, and it is a highly effective, low cost contraceptive over the long term.

== Contraindications ==

Levonorgestrel-releasing implant should not be used in women with liver disease, breast cancer, or blood clots. Women who believe they may already be pregnant or those with vaginal bleeding should first see a physician. However, since it does not contain estrogen like some birth control pills, older women, women who smoke, and women with high blood pressure are not restricted from using the system.

== Side effects ==

After three months of using, women may need to schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor blood pressure and discuss any concerns. Side effects may include irregular menstrual periods for the first approximately three months, including periods lasting longer than normal, bleeding or spotting between periods, heavy bleeding, or going with no period for the mentioned period of time. Sometimes, pain, itching or infection at the site of the implant will occur. Ovarian cysts may also occur, but usually do not require treatment, although they can cause pain even if benign.

==Technique==

=== Insertion ===

Levonorgestrel-releasing implant is implanted under the skin in the upper arm of a woman, by creating a small incision and inserting the capsules in a fanlike shape. Insertion usually takes 15 minutes and the capsules can sometimes be seen under the skin, although usually they look like small veins. They can also be felt under the skin. Once inserted, the contraceptive works within 24 hours and lasts up to five years.

=== Removal ===

Levonorgestrel-releasing implant can be removed by creating a second incision and withdrawing the capsules. It is normally removed when the five-year period is over, or if:

* Pregnancy is desired
* Different birth control is preferred
* Complications arise

Normally removal is not complicated; removal difficulties have been reported with a frequency of 6.2%, based on 849 removals. Removal difficulties include: multiple incisions, capsule fragments remaining, pain, multiple visits, deep placement, lengthy removal procedure, or other.

If desired, a new implant can be inserted at the time of removal.

==History==
It was developed by Sheldon J. Segal and Horacio Croxatto at the Population Council beginning in 1966, with the first clinical trial in Chile in 1974. It was first approved in Finland on November 23, 1983, where it was manufactured by Leiras Oy Pharmaceuticals. The original Norplant consisted of a set of six small (2.4 mm × 34 mm) silicone capsules, each filled with 36 mg of levonorgestrel implanted under the skin in the upper arm and effective for five years. The original (six-capsule) Norplant production has been phased out; USAID&#x27;s contract ran until December 2006.
The original (six capsule) Norplant was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on December 10, 1990, and marketed in the United States in 1991 by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. Norplant distribution in the United States ended in 2002; limited supplies still remained in the U.S. until 2004. Norplant was withdrawn from the UK market in 1999. Production of Norplant was discontinued globally in 2008.

Norplant II (Norplant-2, Jadelle), also developed by the Population Council and manufactured by Schering Oy, consists of two small (2.5 mm × 43 mm) silicone rods each containing 75 mg of levonorgestrel in a polymer matrix, instead of six capsules. It was approved May 31, 1996 by the FDA as being effective for three years; it was subsequently approved November 22, 2002 by the FDA as being effective for five years. Jadelle has not been marketed in the United States; Jadelle is the successor to the original Norplant in USAID&#x27;s contract beginning January 2007.

==Society and culture==

===United States ===
By 1996, more than 50,000 women had filed lawsuits, including 70 class actions, against Wyeth or its subsidiaries, or doctors who prescribed Norplant. Wyeth never lost a Norplant lawsuit, even in cases which came before a jury.

On August 26, 1999, after winning 3 jury verdicts, 20 pretrial summary judgments and the dismissal of 14,000 claims, Wyeth offered out-of-court cash settlements of $1,500 each to about 36,000 women who contended that they had not been adequately warned about possible side effects of Norplant such as irregular menstrual bleeding, headaches, nausea and depression. Wyeth said that most of the plaintiffs experienced routine side effects described in Norplant&#x27;s labeling information. Wyeth did not admit to any wrongdoing, saying the settlement offer &quot;was purely a business decision,&quot; noting &quot;our legal success has come at a steep price because lawsuits are time-consuming, expensive, and have a chilling effect on research,&quot; and that it would continue to offer Norplant and would contest &quot;any and all new lawsuits aggressively.&quot;

About 32,000 women accepted the out-of-court $1,500 settlements. On August 14, 2002, Wyeth won partial summary judgment and dismissal of the claims of the 2,960 remaining plaintiffs who had not accepted Wyeth&#x27;s out-of-court settlement offer.

In August 2000, Wyeth suspended shipments of Norplant in the United States because during regular quality assurance monitoring, representative samples of seven lots distributed beginning October 20, 1999 tested within product specifications, but at the lower end of the release rate specification for shelf life stability, raising concerns about those lots&#x27; contraceptive effectiveness. Wyeth recommended that women who had Norplant capsules from those lots implanted use backup contraception until they determined the clinical relevance of the atypically low levels of levonorgestrel release.

On July 26, 2002, Wyeth announced that data from investigations conducted in women with Norplant capsules from the suspect lots did not suggest less contraceptive effectiveness than that reported in clinical trials, and that therefore backup contraception could be safely discontinued. Wyeth also announced that due to limitations in product component supplies, they did not plan to resume marketing the six-capsule Norplant system in the United States.

===New Zealand ===
Jadelle was added to the Pharmaceutical Management Agency&#x27;s (Pharmac) schedule and subsequently subsidized in August 2010. Medical professionals raised concerns during a consultation process indicating preference for a product which is easier to insert. The agreement between Bayer New Zealand and Pharmac was conditional on Bayer New Zealand providing adequate training to ensure doctors are comfortable in the insertion and removal technique.

===Controversy===
Some American legislators have unsuccessfully attempted to provide financial incentives to women on welfare who agree to use Norplant. For example, in Kansas, Republican Kerry Patrick introduced legislation that would grant welfare recipients a one-time payment of $500 to use Norplant, followed by a $50 bonus each year the implants remained in place.&quot; Some judges have offered Norplant implants as a voluntary alternative to jail time for certain women convicted of child abuse or drug abuse during pregnancy.

Two days after the 1990 FDA approval of Norplant, an editorial in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; suggested reducing the size of the black underclass by offering welfare mothers increased benefits if they agreed to use Norplant. Eleven days later the &quot;Inquirer&quot; apologized for their &quot;misguided and wrongheaded&quot; editorial and for their suggestion of offering incentives for Norplant use.

Critics such as the ACLU argued that such uses are coercive and discriminatory, and compared such uses to early 20th-century American eugenics. In &quot;Killing the Black Body&quot;, black feminist Dorothy Roberts links such uses of Norplant to a &quot;white mainstream&quot; that is allegedly determined to &quot;demonize, even criminalize&quot; poor black women&#x27;s lives and reproductive choices.

Within two years of Norplant&#x27;s FDA approval, legislators in thirteen U.S. states had proposed nearly two dozen bills offering incentives for, or requiring use of Norplant by welfare mothers; none of these proposals passed.

The first big city to aggressively promote the use of Norplant was Baltimore. Baltimore targeted teenagers because the birthrate was three times higher than other states. In Baltimore, about ten percent of girls between ages 15 and 17 gave birth during 1990. Young mothers would often drop out of school and struggle to raise the child in poverty. The mayor at the time, Kurt Schmoke, pushed for laws that would give teen girls more access to Norplant. Norplant was eventually given to teen girls at schools without parental consent. Programs were designed for, and performed in, predominantly black schools. Laurence G. Paquin Middle School became the first school to provide Norplant to their students. Paquin Middle School had 355 female students but only 5 of them were not black. Their program started off as a pilot program and soon other urban high schools like San Fernando High School in Los Angeles and Crane High School in Chicago&#x27;s West Side adopted the program of providing Norplant to their students. Because of a focus on predominantly black schools, questions of racism arose among black community leaders.

<doc id="770865" wikidata="Q1417659" url="?curid=770865" title="Finn (Frisian)">
<text>Finn, son of Folcwald, was a legendary Frisian king. He is mentioned in &quot;Widsith&quot;, in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, and in the Finnesburg Fragment. He is named in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, while a Finn, given a different father but perhaps intending the same hero, appears in Anglo-Saxon royal pedigrees.

He was married to Hildeburh, a sister of the Danish lord Hnæf, and was killed in a fight with Hnæf&#x27;s lieutenant Hengest after Hnæf was himself killed by Frisians.

A passage from &quot;Beowulf&quot; as translated by Seamus Heaney (lines 1089–1090) reads:

:&quot;Finn, son of Folcwald,
:should honour the Danes...&quot;

A possible reference to a lost tradition on Finn appears in Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;. Snorri talks of the animosity between Eadgils and Onela (which also appears in &quot;Beowulf&quot;), and writes that Aðils (Eadgils) was at war with a Norwegian king named Áli (Onela). Áli died in the war, and Aðils took Áli&#x27;s helmet &quot;Battle-boar&quot; and his horse Raven. The Danish berserkers who had helped him win the war demanded three pounds of gold each in pay, and two pieces of armour that nothing could pierce: the helmet battle-boar and the mailcoat &quot;Finn&#x27;s heritage&quot;. They also wanted the famous ring Svíagris. Aðils considered the pay outrageous and refused.

Finn, the son of &quot;Fodepald&quot; (i.e. Folcwald) is also mentioned in the pedigree list of Saxon ancestors of the legendary kings of Kent that appears in &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;. The Wessex and Bernician royal genealogies in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and Anglian collection instead make the Finn in the royal pedigree son of Godwulf, and it is uncertain whether the same heroic Finn was originally intended. Richard North notes that &quot;Folcwalda&quot; is &quot;identical with the first element of &quot;fólcvaldi goða&quot; (&#x27;ruler of the host of gods&#x27;) which is an epithet reserved for Freyr&quot;. He also notes similarities with &quot;&quot;fólkum stýrir&quot; (&#x27;he leads peoples&#x27;, Húsdrápa) which celebrates Freyr&quot;.

Finn is a central subject of &quot;Finn and Hengest&quot;, a study of the Finnesburg Episode by J. R. R. Tolkien, edited by Alan Bliss and published posthumously in book form in 1982.

<doc id="770869" wikidata="Q484621" url="?curid=770869" title="Roberto Petagine">
<text>Roberto Antonio Petagine Hernandez (; born June 7, 1971) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball player of Italian descent. His Major League Baseball career includes brief stints with the Houston Astros (1994), San Diego Padres (1995), New York Mets (1996 and 1997), Cincinnati Reds (1998), Boston Red Sox (2005), and Seattle Mariners (2006); but he is best known for his success in the Japanese Central League between 1999 and 2004 where, as a member of the Yakult Swallows (1999–2002) and Yomiuri Giants (2003–2004), he was among Nippon Professional Baseball&#x27;s premier offensive players.

== Career ==

===Minor league career===
Petagine entered professional baseball on February 13, 1990, at the age of 18, when Houston signed him as an undrafted amateur free agent after starting his career in Venezuela with the Leones del Caracas baseball team in which he contributed with his power for several campaigns becoming a star and a well-known baseball player in his country. Later that year, he played his first pro season with the rookie-level GCL Astros of the Gulf Coast League. His production there, and the following year with Single-A Burlington, was solid (if unspectacular). Petagine would go on to substantial minor league success in his early to mid 20s, but even his early stats hinted at the trends that would define—and perhaps curse—his career in American baseball: always having an above-average OBP, but relatively little home run power, by the standards historically applied to first basemen.

A solid contact hitter who used the whole field with occasional pull power, the young Petagine was indeed most noteworthy for his control of the strike zone, and more specifically for the exceptional rate at which he drew walks. His breakout years were in 1992 through 1994, as he moved through the minors to Triple-A, cumulatively averaging an OBP above .400 and a .500+ slugging percentage.

&quot;Baseball America&quot; twice ranked him among the Astros&#x27; top ten prospects (in 1992 and 1994 Houston Astros Baseball America Top Ten Prospects, 1992 - 2013); he was a three-time All-Star (1996–1998) in Triple-A; and he won the International League MVP Award in back-to-back years: 1997 as a member of the Mets&#x27; Triple-A affiliate in Norfolk and 1998 as a member of the Reds&#x27; Triple-A affiliate in Indianapolis. Despite his early successes, though, Petagine would never become a regular in the majors, nor receive much chance to play his way into the role; he was traded three times between December, 1994 and February, 1998, and in December 1998 the Reds sold his contract to the Yakult Swallows.

=== Nippon Professional Baseball ===
A new home helped revitalize Petagine&#x27;s career. Let go by the Reds in 1998, he proved a welcome addition in the Japanese Central League, as he won three Gold Gloves, two home run titles and one Central League MVP award while playing for the Yakult Swallows (1999–2002) and Yomiuri Giants (2003–04). For Yakult and Yomiuri, Petagine hit .317 with 223 home runs and 594 RBI in 756 games.

In 2003–04, Petagine became the highest-paid baseball player in Japan. The Giants acquired him to take the place of Hideki Matsui, who had signed with the New York Yankees to play in Major League Baseball. However, Petagine was often forced to play as an outfielder because the Giants already had a first baseman in Kazuhiro Kiyohara. Still, he put up excellent numbers at the plate for those two seasons, producing a total of 73 home runs and 165 RBIs.

===Return to North American baseball===

Before the 2005 season, the Boston Red Sox agreed to a minor league contract with Petagine. He underwent knee surgery in spring training, preventing him from making the 25-man roster. In August, first baseman John Olerud was placed on the 15-day disabled list and his roster spot was filled by Petagine, who&#x27;d had a productive Triple-A season (including a .327 batting average with 20 home runs and 69 RBI in 74 games at Pawtucket). In 18 games with Boston, he hit .281 (9-for-34) with one home run and nine RBI.

The Red Sox declined to sign Petagine for the 2006 season. He signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners, and was invited to spring training. After a productive spring, he made the major league team as a backup to Richie Sexson. On July 9, 2006, he was designated for assignment by the Mariners.

To start the 2008 season, Petagine played first base for the Diablos Rojos del Mexico of the Mexican League. In 37 games, he batted .372 with six home runs and 27 RBIs.

===Korean baseball===
On May 12, 2008, the LG Twins announced that he would join the team, replacing starting pitcher Jamie Brown on the roster. The contract was worth a prorated $250,000 for the remainder of 2008. In his first full season with the LG Twins in 2009, Petagine hit 26 home runs and had 100 RBIs.

=== Return to Japan ===
Petagine returned to NPB in 2010 to play one season for the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks before retiring. He batted .261 with 10 home runs and 41 RBIs in 81 games.

<text>Svetlana Leonidovna Boginskaya (born February 9, 1973) is a former artistic gymnast for the Soviet Union and Belarus of Belarusian origin. She is a three-time Olympic champion, with an individual gold medal on vault from the 1988 Summer Olympics and team gold medals from the 1988 and 1992 Summer Olympics.

==Early life==
Boginskaya was born in Minsk, Belarus on February 9, 1973. She practiced figure skating before beginning gymnastics at age six, after seeing Nadia Comăneci compete at the Olympics. Two years later, she moved to Moscow to train full-time at the Round Lake Gymnastics Center, where she trained with Lyubov Miromanova.

== Gymnastics career ==
Boginskaya became a member of the Soviet national team at age 14. She competed internationally for the first time at the 1987 World Championships, where she placed third on balance beam; the team placed second. She went on to compete in the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea, where she won four medals: gold in the team competition, gold on vault, silver on floor, and bronze in the individual all-around.

Three days after the Olympics, Boginskaya&#x27;s longtime coach, Lyubov Miromanova, died by suicide. Miromanova had been a surrogate mother to Boginskaya, coaching and caring for her after she moved from Minsk to train full-time in Moscow.

After Miromanova&#x27;s death, Boginskaya began training with Tatiana Grosovivich. Under Grosovivich&#x27;s tutelage, Boginskaya competed at the 1989 European Women&#x27;s Artistic Gymnastics Championships, where she received gold in all-round, vault, and floor. Later that year, she placed first in all-around, floor, and team events at the 1989 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, eventually dedicating her performance to her late mentor.

The following year, Boginskaya became the fourth woman to win the gold medal in every individual event at the European Championships. She also competed at the FIG World Cup, where she placed first on floor.

In 1991, Boginskaya won gold at the World Championships on beam and silver in the all-around; the team won gold.

In 1992, Boginskaya competed at the European Championships, where she won gold on beam with a score of 9.95. However, she fell during her final event, the floor exercise, ultimately finishing fifth in the all-around. Her teammate, Tatiana Gutsu, received the all-around title. Despite Boginskaya&#x27;s fall on floor, she remained a favorite to win the all-around title at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. At the World Championships, Boginskaya won gold on vault and was selected for the Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics. Many in the gymnastics world expected a duel between Boginskaya and Zmeskal at the Olympics, and the media promoted this story. At the Olympic games, Boginskaya won her third Olympic gold in the team competition; in the individual competition, she faltered on the uneven bars and finished fifth in the individual all-around; Zmeskal finished tenth.

Following the 1992 Olympics, Boginskaya retired. However, she returned to the sport in 1995, stating that she had been inspired by Katarina Witt who had a memorable comeback at the 1994 Winter Olympics. Boginskaya moved to Houston, Texas to train with Bela Karolyi (1942-2024) and upgraded the difficulty of her routines. At the 1995 European Championships, she won silver in the all-around.

In 1996, at age 23, she placed second in the all-around at the American Cup behind one of Karolyi&#x27;s pupils, Kerri Strug. She also placed second at the European Championships in Birmingham behind the defending world champion Lilia Podkopayeva. She then progressed to the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, where she was one of a number of older gymnasts competing. Boginskaya competed in the all-around and vault finals, but did not medal. The Belarusian team came in sixth.

Following the 1996 Olympics, Boginskaya retired from gymnastics.

Boginskaya is among a small group of women to have competed in three Olympic Games; and due to the break-up of the Soviet Union, she competed at each Games under a different flag: USSR, the Unified Team, and Belarus. She was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 2005.

Boginskaya has remained active in both the American and international gymnastics communities, and works as a consulting guest coach. In the early 2010s, she frequently supported former teammate Oksana Chusovitina, who continues to compete in her late 40s, and has appeared on the competition floor as her coach.

== Post-gymnastics and personal life ==
Boginskaya lives in Houston, Texas with her husband and two children. She runs several businesses, including an online gymnastics apparel retailer and a summer camp for gymnasts.

==In popular culture==
After the 1992 Olympics, Boginskaya appeared alongside her compatriot Vitaly Scherbo in the music video for the song &quot;Revolution Earth,&quot; by The B-52&#x27;s.

==Trademarks==
Boginskaya&#x27;s floor routine at the 1988 Olympics was done to the music of Georges Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;, and another routine she performed in parts of 1990 and 1991 was choreographed by the Bolshoi Ballet. Her uneven bars exercise included a signature giant to handstand with 180° split into a toe-on element. Commentators and reporters cited her height and slim stature as elements she used to her advantage through attention to posture and body alignment; meanwhile they also suggested that she relied more on execution and presentation than difficulty, though she did usually fulfill requirements and earn 10.0 start values. She frequently landed dismounts and vaults with her right foot placed slightly in front of her left, an intentional touch of artistry that also helped her stick landings.

<doc id="770873" wikidata="Q7691702" url="?curid=770873" title="Teaneck Armory">
<text>Teaneck Armory is an armory and arena located on a site in Teaneck, New Jersey. It is owned and operated by the New Jersey National Guard.

==History==
The facility was completed in 1936 at a cost of $1 million. It was designed by Louis S. Kaplan (1896–1964), who as a young architect won a competition to design the Trenton War Memorial and after its dedication became the leading state architect until the early 1960s, designing or adapting many of its armories.

From 1967–68, the arena was the home of the New Jersey Americans of the American Basketball Association, the team that later became today&#x27;s Brooklyn Nets in the National Basketball Association. In 1968, the Americans were forced to forfeit a playoff game against the Kentucky Colonels because a circus group had rented the armory that week and the alternate location selected for the game, Long Island Arena in Commack, New York, had a floor in such poor condition that it was deemed unplayable.

Over the years the expansive floor and high-ceilinged space has been used for numerous film shoots, including &quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot;, &quot;Bogus&quot;, and &quot;Stonewall&quot;. The armory has also hosted concerts, three-quarter midget car races, Boy Scout jamborees, political rallies (including a November 6, 1960 campaign rally by presidential candidate John F. Kennedy), circuses, indoor soccer and various military uses. It has also been used for ceremonies and celebrations commemorating Eid ul-Adha.

==National Guard==
The Teaneck Armory can be distinguished by the M42 Duster anti-aircraft vehicle and the M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle facing Teaneck Road. During 2005, the major units of the 50th Main Support Battalion assigned to drill at the Armory were deployed for service in Iraq and Kuwait, along with many other units of the New Jersey National Guard. Other elements of the New Jersey National Guard based at the Teaneck Armory have been deployed to Afghanistan, Guantanamo Bay, and Kosovo, among other places. Additionally, a squadron of the New Jersey Wing of the Civil Air Patrol is located at the Armory.

==Flag==
In 2010, the armory unfurled its first garrison flag since 1936. Received as donation, the flag had hung over Wall Street office building for 21 days after the September 2001 attacks. 15 feet wide and 20 feet long, it weighs 50 pounds.

<text>Jessica Hahn (born July 7, 1959) is an American model and actress. She frequently appeared on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; throughout the late 1980s and into the 2000s.

==Jim Bakker scandal==
Hahn first came to public attention in 1987 after the disclosure that televangelist Jim Bakker had paid for her silence in response to an allegation against him of rape, which led to Bakker&#x27;s announcement that he was stepping down as head of PTL Satellite Network and Heritage USA. According to Hahn, on the afternoon of December 6, 1980, when she was a 21-year-old church secretary, she was drugged and raped by Bakker and another preacher, John Wesley Fletcher. Hahn was given a $279,000 () pay-off for her silence, which was paid with PTL&#x27;s funds to Hahn through Bakker associate Roe Messner. Bakker, who made all of the financial decisions for the PTL organization, allegedly kept two sets of books to conceal the accounting irregularities. Reporters from &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot;, led by Charles Shepard, investigated and published a series of articles regarding the PTL organization&#x27;s finances. This precipitated Bakker&#x27;s resignation and the publication of Hahn&#x27;s claims. In his 1997 book, &quot;I Was Wrong&quot;, Bakker disputed Hahn&#x27;s account, claiming that he was &quot;set up&quot; and that the sex was consensual.

==Acting and modeling career==
After the public revelation of the Bakker scandal, Hahn posed nude for &quot;Playboy&quot; (November 1987, December 1987 and September 1988) and videos appeared in several television shows, including &quot;Married... with Children&quot;. She was also known for her frequent appearances on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; throughout the late 1980s and into the 2000s.

==Personal life==
Hahn was born in Massapequa, New York, and graduated from Massapequa High School. She had a relationship with comedian Sam Kinison and appeared in his music video for &quot;Wild Thing&quot; in 1988. In 1991, she began a relationship with the co-creator of &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, Ron Leavitt, which continued until his death in 2008.

In December 2017, Hahn disclosed that she is married to Frank Lloyd (a film stuntman), is no longer active in show business, and lives on a ranch north of Los Angeles. In July 2023 &quot;People&quot; magazine reported that Hahn&#x27;s husband Frank Lloyd had filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences and stating the couple had been separated since 2018.

<text>Gran Turismo is the fourth studio album by Swedish band the Cardigans, released internationally on 19 October 1998 and in November 1998 in the United States. It features a darker and more moody type of music, mixed with more electronic sounds.

In an interview in 2009, producer and sound engineer Tore Johansson commented on the dark sound of the record, which sets it apart from the warm, jammy feel of many other recordings made at Tambourine Studios: &quot;It&#x27;s a very cold and defined recording, no natural reverb or audio curtains: there&#x27;s not a sound element on that disc which wasn&#x27;t deliberately put there.&quot;

The album and band were nominated for a total of seven awards at the 1999 Grammis—the Swedish equivalent of the Grammy Awards. &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; sold more than three million copies worldwide.

==Background==
The album&#x27;s name is explained by the band in a track on an advanced copy of the album titled &quot;Explain the Title of the Album &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;&quot;: &quot;The title can be interpreted in many ways but I think we only thought of a few ones we liked,&quot; Nina says. &quot;We talked about having like Italian or French title and Gran Turismo came up and it sort of felt really good and you know I can think of music sometimes as tourism and traveling. So to me &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; is sort of the way to describe music sometimes or spending time with music.&quot; Peter says, &quot;and I think that also the title suits this very album extremely well because the album is pretty much about trying to find your place in the world. I think sometimes you can always compare living to being a tourist in the world,&quot; Nina finishes.

<doc id="770909" wikidata="Q6869173" url="?curid=770909" title="National Counties of English and Welsh cricket">
<text>The National Counties, known as the Minor Counties before 2020, are the cricketing counties of England and Wales that do not have first-class status. The game is administered by the National Counties Cricket Association (NCCA), which comes under the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). There are currently twenty teams in National Counties cricket: nineteen representing historic counties of England, plus the Wales National County Cricket Club.

Of the 39 historic counties of England, 17 have a first-class county cricket team (the 18th first-class county is Glamorgan in Wales) and 19 participate in the National Counties championship. 

Since 2021, Cumberland and Westmorland have been represented by Cumbria in the National Counties championship, while the remaining two historic counties, Huntingdonshire and Rutland, have associations with other counties (Huntingdonshire with Cambridgeshire and Rutland with Leicestershire). Despite this, Huntingdonshire has its own Cricket Board, and took part in the English domestic one-day competition between 1999 and 2003. The Isle of Wight, historically a part of Hampshire but now a county in its own right, also has its own Cricket Board.

In 2020, the Minor Counties were rebranded as the National Counties Cricket Association.

==History==
The Minor Counties, i.e. those not afforded first-class status, formed their own Championship from 1895. In the early years, the results of matches against teams that did not play enough games to qualify for the final table were included in the records of those who did. For example, Cambridgeshire played only Norfolk. Five notionally Second Class county clubs – Essex, Warwickshire, Derbyshire, Hampshire and Leicestershire – joined the County Championship for the first time (some of them had had periods of being considered first-class before the Championship was constituted as such). Four further Minor Counties have since been granted first-class status – Worcestershire in 1899, Northamptonshire in 1905, Glamorgan in 1921 and Durham in 1992.

The second XIs of the first-class counties competed in the Minor Counties Championship from its early days and Lancashire Second XI won the Championship title in 1907. For 10 years before and 15 years after the Second World War, the first-class county second XIs frequently won the Minor Counties title, but after 1959, when the counties set up their own Second XI competition, fewer contested the Minor Counties games. Yorkshire Second XI was the last second XI winner of the title in 1971, and Somerset Second XI was the last to compete, withdrawing after the 1987 season.

The &quot;true&quot; Minor Counties teams (i.e. not the second XI of a first-class county) were often composed entirely of amateur players, though some had a few professionals as well, especially where there were strong professional leagues locally. An example of a professional who played regular Minor Counties cricket was the England bowler Sydney Barnes. After falling out with Lancashire, he played most of his cricket outside the first-class game with Staffordshire. In early days, Minor Counties teams supplied some amateur cricketers of note too: the most recent example of a Test cricket player whose main cricket was in the Minor Counties was David Townsend in 1934–35. His county cricket was for Durham, though he played first-class cricket for Oxford University.

Traditionally, the Minor Counties played a minimum of eight matches, until recent times of two days duration, and few of them played more than 12 matches. Usually the matches were fairly local, against neighbouring counties, rather than against distant teams, and matches were often played in batches so that amateur players could time their holidays from work to take part in several games over a period of a week or two. When they competed, the first-class county second elevens often played many more games.

The championship was decided by the average points gained per game. If the second-placed side had not met the leading team, under Rule 16 a challenge match could be played. The result was sometimes computed into the final championship table but this practice was discontinued in 1954 when Devon complained that they would drop from second to fourth as a result of the Challenge match.

The Minor Counties Championship was substantially reorganised in 1983 when the present two-division regional structure was introduced, along with a one-day knock-out competition. More recently, championship matches have increased to three days. The departure of Somerset Second XI in 1987 led to the introduction of the Wales Minor Counties side; Durham&#x27;s elevation to first-class status in 1992 saw the arrival of Herefordshire, the first time a side from that county had competed.

In 2020, the Minor Counties were renamed as &quot;National Counties&quot;, in part because of the negative connotations of the term &quot;Minor&quot;. The competition was restructured at the same time.

==Competitions==
* National Counties Championship – previously a competition in which teams played a minimum of eight two-day matches, usually against neighbouring counties, the competition was relaunched in 1983. It is now a three-day competition split into two divisions, each with 10 sides. Originally each team played all the others once a season; now six matches are played by each side. Divisional winners play off to decide Champions.
* NCCA Knockout Trophy – limited overs competition. Straight knockout with final at Lord&#x27;s.

==Minor Counties representative teams==
Teams representing the Minor Counties have featured in first-class and List A matches for many years.

===First-class matches===
The first Minor Counties side played a three-day match at Stoke-on-Trent against the South African cricket team that toured Britain and Ireland in 1912 and that took part in the Triangular Tournament. The first and third days of the match were washed out by rain; the Minor Counties&#x27; total of 127 relied heavily on 51 from Norman Riches, later Glamorgan&#x27;s first first-class captain, and the three South African wickets that fell for 22 runs by close of play on the second day were all taken by Durham medium-pace bowler Alfred Morris, whose only other first-class match was for &quot;An England XI&quot; against the Australians later that summer, when he took seven further wickets for a team composed largely of Test players.

Minor Counties&#x27; next outing as a first-class side was again against the South Africans, this time in 1924, but it was the third match, the 1928 game at Exeter against the West Indies that cemented the fixture in the calendar. After following on, Minor Counties won the match by 42 runs, thanks largely to 154 by Aaron Lockett, a batsman from Staffordshire (and later a first-class umpire) and six wickets for Edward Hazelton of Buckinghamshire.

After that, a Minor Counties representative side was normally accorded a first-class fixture against the touring team, though sometimes the match was downgraded to a two-day non-first-class match. In some cases, the Minor Counties team included uncapped players from first-class counties&#x27; second elevens or former first-class players, though the match venues were always in the &quot;true&quot; minor counties.

===List A Matches===

====Gillette Cup/NatWest Trophy/Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy====
The five top Minor Counties sides from the previous season were put into the draw for the first round of the second-ever Gillette Cup competition in 1964, alongside seven first-class counties. The five, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Durham, Hertfordshire and Wiltshire, were not seeded in any way, and Durham were drawn at home to Hertfordshire, beating them easily, and thereby becoming the first Minor County side in the cup&#x27;s second round (in which they lost heavily to the eventual winners, Sussex).

The Minor County representation in this competition remained at this level until 1983, by which time it had been renamed the NatWest Trophy. In that season, a new structure for the competition was adopted, with all the first-class counties taking part in the first round, and the numbers of teams being made up to 32 by the addition of Ireland, Scotland and 13 Minor County sides. The first round was seeded, with all of the non-first-class teams drawn against a first-class county.

At no stage in Minor County participation in this competition were first-class teams&#x27; second elevens considered eligible for qualification for the competition, but more recently minor counties had to compete against &quot;county board&quot; sides composed of non-first-class cricketers to qualify for the first round, with up to 60 teams involved.

The first Minor County to beat a first-class county in the Gillette Cup was Durham: in 1973, the county beat Yorkshire at Harrogate by five wickets. In all, 10 Minor Counties sides beat first-class opposition up to 2005 (and three other sides, Ireland, Scotland and Holland, also beat first-class counties). Minor County involvement in the competition ended after the 2005 season when the Cup changed to a league format for first-class counties (plus Ireland and Scotland) only.

====Benson &amp; Hedges Cup====
When the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup started as the second List A cup competition in England and Wales in 1972, it was organised in a different format from the knock-out Gillette Cup. The then 17 first-class counties were put into four mini-leagues for the first phase of the competition, and to even up the numbers, three additional teams were recruited: a combined Oxford and Cambridge Universities side, and two representative sides from the Minor Counties. For the first four years, the teams were called Minor Counties North and Minor Counties South; from 1976 to 1979, the counties were split longitudinally into Minor Counties East and West. None of these divided representative teams was at all successful: 63 of 64 games were lost and the exception was a no-result game involving Minor Counties South.

After 1980, as part of the same move that brought Ireland into the Gillette Cup, Scotland joined the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup, cutting the Minor Counties to a single team. Over the next 19 seasons until the format was changed again after the 1998 competition, the Minor Counties won six out of 75 matches, with a further four &quot;no-results&quot;. Both the Minor Counties&#x27; first two victories, in 1980 and 1981, were by the margin of three runs, against Gloucestershire and Hampshire respectively. At no stage did the representative team reach the next phase of the competition, the knock-out stage.

In 1999, the Benson &amp; Hedges was recast as a &quot;Super Cup&quot; for only the top eight first-class teams; another change in format in 2000 saw three leagues of six first-class counties set up. This lasted until the competition was abandoned in favour of the new Twenty20 Cup after the 2002 season, and the Minor Counties did not figure in this set-up.

<text>Jane X. Luu (; born July 1963) is a Vietnamese-American astronomer and defense systems engineer. She was awarded the Kavli Prize (shared with David C. Jewitt and Michael Brown) for 2012 &quot;for discovering and characterizing the Kuiper Belt and its largest members, work that led to a major advance in the understanding of the history of our planetary system&quot;.

Luu immigrated to the United States as a refugee in 1975, when the South Vietnamese government fell. She and her family lived in refugee camps and motels before they settled in Kentucky, where she had relatives. She graduated from high school as valedictorian and then earned a scholarship to Stanford University, receiving her bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics in 1984. Working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at NASA after college inspired her to study astronomy.

== Work as a graduate student and co-discovery of the Kuiper Belt ==

As a graduate student at the University of California at Berkeley and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she looked at links between asteroids and comets for her main PhD project. She also worked with David C. Jewitt to discover the Kuiper Belt, an area previously believed to contain no objects. In 1992, after five years of observation, they found the first known Kuiper Belt object other than Pluto and its largest moon Charon, using the University of Hawaii&#x27;s 2.2 meter telescope on Mauna Kea. This object is (15760) 1992 QB1, which she and Jewitt nicknamed &quot;Smiley&quot;. The American Astronomical Society awarded Luu the Annie J. Cannon Award in Astronomy in 1991. In 1992, Luu received a Hubble Fellowship from the Space Telescope Science Institute and chose the University of California, Berkeley as a host institution. The Phocaea main-belt asteroid 5430 Luu is named in her honor. She received her PhD in 1992 at MIT.

== Professional life ==

After receiving her doctorate, Luu worked as an assistant professor at Harvard University, since 1994. Luu also served as a professor at Leiden University in the Netherlands. Following her time in Europe, Luu returned to the United States and worked on instrumentation as a Senior Scientist at Lincoln Laboratory at MIT, focusing on defense-industry projects, specifically lidar systems.

In December 2004, Luu and Jewitt reported the discovery of crystalline water ice on Quaoar, which was at the time the largest known Kuiper Belt object. They also found indications of ammonia hydrate. Their report theorized that the ice likely formed underground, becoming exposed after a collision with another Kuiper Belt object sometime in the last few million years.

In 2012, she won (along with David C. Jewitt of the University of California at Los Angeles) the Shaw Prize &quot;for their discovery and characterization of trans-Neptunian bodies, an archeological treasure dating back to the formation of the solar system and the long-sought source of short period comets&quot; 
and the Kavli Prize (shared with Jewitt and Michael E. Brown) &quot;for discovering and characterizing the Kuiper Belt and its largest members, work that led to a major advance in the understanding of the history of our planetary system&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Luu enjoys traveling, and has worked for Save the Children in Nepal. She enjoys a variety of outdoor activities and plays the cello. She met her husband, Ronnie Hoogerwerf, who is also an astronomer, while working in the Netherlands in a tenured position at Leiden University. They have one child together.

<doc id="770920" wikidata="Q1680480" url="?curid=770920" title="James Guthrie (Kentucky politician)">
<text>James Guthrie (December 5, 1792 – March 13, 1869) was an American lawyer, plantation owner, railroad president and Democratic Party politician in Kentucky. He served as the 21st United States Secretary of the Treasury under Presidents Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan, and then became president of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. After serving, part-time, in both houses of the Kentucky legislature as well as Louisville&#x27;s City Council before the American Civil War (and failing to win his party&#x27;s nomination in the presidential election of 1860), Guthrie became one of Kentucky&#x27;s United States senators in 1865 (until resigning for health reasons in 1868 shortly before his death). Guthrie strongly opposed proposals for Kentucky to secede from the United States and attended the Peace Conference of 1861. Although he sided with the Union during the Civil War, he declined President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s offer to become the Secretary of War. As one of Kentucky&#x27;s senators after the war, Guthrie supported President Andrew Johnson and opposed Congressional Reconstruction.

Guthrie also was a director of the Louisville and Portland Canal Company, the first president of the University of Louisville, and presided over the Kentucky Constitutional Convention of 1849 (which explicitly ratified slavery in the state until its abolition after the Civil War). During the Civil War, Guthrie resisted federal pressure to nationalize the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, but allowed the Union to use it to move troops and supplies.

== Early and family life ==
James Guthrie was born on December 5, 1792, in Bardstown, Nelson County, Kentucky, to General Adam Guthrie (1762–1826) and his wife, the Pennsylvania-born Hannah Polk (1765–1842). Though his grandparents emigrated from Ireland, Guthrie was of Scottish descent. and his ancestor James Guthrie was a Scottish clergyman executed in 1661 after the Restoration of King Charles I (although the Scottish parliament in 1690 posthumously reversed the bill of attainder that led to his execution).

Adam Guthrie moved from Virginia across the Appalachian Mountains into Kentucky and married Hannah Polk in 1788. They had three sons and five daughters who survived to adulthood. Having fought Native peoples until they left the area after the American Revolutionary War, the senior Guthrie developed a large plantation in Nelson County, and twice won election to the Kentucky General Assembly (serving from 1800 to 1805, and again in 1808). James Guthrie received some of his early education in a log schoolhouse. During his father&#x27;s military campaigns, Guthrie studied at McAllister&#x27;s Military Academy in Bardstown.

In 1812, young James Guthrie took a job on a flatboat transporting goods (and slaves) down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to New Orleans, Louisiana. After three such trips, he decided to change careers, and began to study law under Judge John Rowan, along with Ben Hardin and Charles A. Wickliffe.

In 1821, Guthrie married Eliza Churchill Prather. The couple had three daughters—Mary Elizabeth, Ann Augusta, and Sarah Julia—before Eliza Prather Guthrie died in 1836. Sarah Julia Guthrie married chemist J. Lawrence Smith, after whom the J. Lawrence Smith Medal is named.

==Career==
Admitted to the Kentucky bar in 1817, Guthrie began his private legal practice in Bardstown.

In 1820, Governor John Adair appointed Guthrie as Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney for Jefferson County, Kentucky, whereupon Guthrie relocated to what was then the town of Louisville. In 1824, he served on a committee which sought to have Louisville recognized by the state legislature as a city (the state&#x27;s first). The effort failed, but Guthrie was elected to the town&#x27;s board of trustees, and later became its chair.

The following year, Guthrie became a director of the newly formed Louisville and Portland Canal Company. He helped secure federal funding for a bypass around the Falls of the Ohio. However, although Kentucky&#x27;s long-time Senator Henry Clay supported such internal improvements, his political opponent Andrew Jackson when elected president, cut off these funds shortly after taking office in 1829. Guthrie then secured private funds and the canal was completed in late 1830. Within a few years, however, steamboats became too wide for the canal, and their increasingly high smokestacks interfedered with bridges, so it became more an impediment than an aid.

===Kentucky politician===
Jefferson County voters elected Guthrie, who ran as a Democrat, to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1827. In his first year, he chaired the Internal Improvements Committee. In this capacity, he promoted construction of a number of roads and canals, as well as a railroad connecting Louisville to Frankfort. During his service in the House, Guthrie came to chair the Committee on the Courts of Justice.

In 1828, Guthrie mustered enough support to secure city status for Louisville. He was elected to the new city council, and quickly became chair of its most powerful committee, the finance committee.

Guthrie also served in the House (a part-time position) until 1831, when he was elected to the Kentucky Senate. Fellow legislators twice chose him President Pro Tempore. He served on the Finance and Education Committees. In 1834, Guthrie helped found the State Bank of Kentucky, and served as one of its directors. He unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1835.

Back in Louisville, Guthrie advocated constructing a new building to house both city and county government offices. Secretly, he hoped Kentucky&#x27;s capital would be moved to Louisville and that building would become the state&#x27;s capitol. However, the Panic of 1837 halted the courthouse&#x27;s construction, as well as the water works and a bridge over the Ohio River connecting Louisville to Indiana. Some called the unfinished courthouse &quot;Guthrie&#x27;s Folly&quot;, but it was still touted as Louisville sought to become the state&#x27;s capitol in 1842. All three projects were eventually completed, and Guthrie&#x27;s Folly became the Jefferson County Courthouse.

In 1836, a dispute arose among the medical faculty at Transylvania University. Guthrie encouraged some of the disgruntled faculty members to relocate to Louisville and start the Louisville Medical Institute, a precursor to the University of Louisville. In 1843, Guthrie became the third president of Louisville Medical Institute. In 1846, the Kentucky General Assembly chartered the University of Louisville, which subsumed the Louisville Medical Institute. Guthrie became president of the university on December 7, 1847, and served until his death. Working with the Trustees of the Common Schools, Guthrie established a high school that met in the university&#x27;s academic building; this school became Louisville Male High School.

Guthrie also promoted creating a Board of Health, as well as free public schools in Louisville. He encouraged the city to purchase the turnpike between Louisville and Portland (a town now absorbed by the city of Louisville) as well as to purchase stock in the Louisville and Ohio Railroad. He also convinced the city to buy the land that would become Cave Hill Cemetery, and his final resting place. Guthrie served on the Louisville City Council until 1839. In 1845, he was a delegate to a convention on internal improvements held in Memphis, Tennessee, and chaired by John C. Calhoun.

Guthrie represented Louisville at the Kentucky Constitutional Convention of 1849. The delegates chose him president over Whig Archibald Dixon. The major question the convention addressed was slavery. Guthrie owned enslaved persons, and believed that, if freed, the slaves would become vicious and ungovernable. The Kentucky Constitution of 1850 included explicit protections for slave property, and stipulated that no amendments could be proposed for a period of eight years.

===National service and politics===

President Franklin Pierce recognized Guthrie&#x27;s financial acumen and appointed him Secretary of the Treasury in 1853. Soon, Guthrie became the most influential member of Pierce&#x27;s cabinet. A hard money Democrat, Guthrie opposed a national bank, as well as small distinctive notes issued by free and charter banks. Instead, Guthrie advocated adoption of a universal currency that would be convertible to gold on demand. In his first report, he criticized his predecessor, Thomas Corwin, for making private arrangements for debt repurchases. He also accused Corwin of conspiring with a New York port master to under-report duties collected and deposit them into a trust. Guthrie caused a brief public uproar by removing the port master from his post.

During Guthrie&#x27;s tenure, the treasury had large budget surpluses due to the discovery of gold in California. He used much of these surpluses to pay down the national debt, which shrank from $63 million in 1853 to $25 million in 1857. He also purchased silver bullion for coinage which aided struggling banks by returning money to circulation and increasing their depleted reserves. He encouraged more efficient processes in the Treasury Department as a whole, and required monthly, rather than quarterly, reports from customs agents. In 1853,
Guthrie employed Captain Alexander Bowman of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to begin construction of an extension to the Treasury Building&#x27;s south wing. Many considered Guthrie to be the ablest Secretary of the Treasury since Alexander Hamilton.

As President Pierce&#x27;s term ended, Guthrie returned to Louisville and became vice-president of the struggling Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad. The railroad link between the two cities was completed in 1859, and in 1860, Guthrie succeeded John L. Helm as the railroad&#x27;s president. He continued as the railroad&#x27;s president through the Civil War, and after he became incapacitated in 1868 advocated the board&#x27;s electing former Union General William Tecumseh Sherman as his successor, although the board selected Russell Houston in 1869.

Meanwhile, Kentucky, delegates to the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston, South Carolina, favored Guthrie for the office of President. A two-thirds majority of delegates was required to secure the nomination. On the first of many ballots, Guthrie received 35.5 votes; by the thirty-ninth, he was up to 66.5, but still trailed the leading vote-getter Stephen Douglas, by 85 votes. With no candidate able to secure the needed votes, the meeting adjourned and reconvened in Baltimore, Maryland, a month later.

At the Baltimore meeting, Guthrie garnered 9 votes on the first ballot. He received 5.5 on the second ballot, which finally saw Douglas attain the necessary majority. Douglas was defeated by Abraham Lincoln in the presidential election. Guthrie was offered the job of Secretary of War by President Lincoln, but he declined because of age and failing health.

===Civil War===
Though a slave holder and states&#x27; rights advocate, Guthrie ardently opposed secession. On this topic, he stated &quot;I hate that word secession, because it is a cheat! Call things by their right names! The Southern States have... originated a revolution.&quot; He was not convinced that Lincoln&#x27;s election was an inescapable harbinger of war. He believed the Southern states, if they did not secede, would control Congress and the judiciary, and render Lincoln powerless to impose his agenda upon them.

At age 70, Guthrie was elected as one of Kentucky&#x27;s six delegates to the Peace Conference of 1861 in Washington, D.C., to devise means to prevent the impending Civil War. He was chosen to chair the conference&#x27;s Compromise Committee. He failed in his attempt to re-work and re-introduce the Crittenden Compromise earlier proposed in Congress by fellow Kentuckian John J. Crittenden.

The Compromise Committee proposed a plan that included seven constitutional amendments and relied on Henry Clay&#x27;s Missouri Compromise as a framework. Under the committee&#x27;s proposal, 36°30&#x27; north latitude would continue to divide slave and free territory in the United States, and no more territory would be annexed except with the consent of equal representation from both slave and free states. The delegates to the convention presented this idea to Congress on February 27, 1861, and asked them to call a national convention to consider the question, but Congress rejected this report.

Guthrie personally appealed to President Lincoln to consider the convention&#x27;s report, but to no avail. Still convinced that war could be averted, he participated in a convention of border states held at Frankfort in May 1861. This convention also failed to avert the war.

During the war, Guthrie&#x27;s Louisville and Nashville railroad was of vital importance. It was the only rail line originating in the Union and terminating in the Confederacy. Early in the war, the line was used to transport supplies to the Confederates in Tennessee, but after 1861, it was used primarily to benefit the Union. Despite pressure to relinquish control to the federal government, Guthrie remained president of the railroad, which became a frequent target for guerrilla attacks. Combining earnings from both passenger and military rates, Guthrie ensured that the line&#x27;s infrastructure at the close of the war was superior to what it had been before the war started.

Guthrie was a delegate to the 1864 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. He voted for the ticket of General George B. McClellan and former Kentucky governor Thomas Bramlette for president and vice-president, respectively. At the convention, he also opposed the Wade–Davis Bill.

===Later life===
The Kentucky Senate narrowly chose Guthrie over fellow Louisvillian and Union general Lovell H. Rousseau for a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1865. Senator Guthrie opposed the Republican Party&#x27;s Reconstruction efforts. Guthrie supported President Andrew Johnson, opposed the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau and the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment.

==Death and legacy==

On February 7, 1868, Guthrie resigned his position due to ill health. He suffered a stroke on April 8, 1868, which left him paralyzed and bedridden for the rest of his life. On June 11, 1868, he resigned as president of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, recommending General William Tecumseh Sherman to be his successor.

Guthrie died in Louisville on March 13, 1869, and was buried in Cave Hill Cemetery. The city of Guthrie, Kentucky, and Guthrie Street in Downtown Louisville are named in his honor.

The United States Revenue Cutter Service, a branch of the Treasury, named small patrol vessels after Guthrie, in 1868, 1888 and 1895.

<text>The Wales national rugby union team () represents Wales in men&#x27;s international rugby union. Its governing body, the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU), was established in 1881, the same year that Wales played their first international against England. The team plays its home matches at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff (currently known for sponsorship reasons as the Principality Stadium), which replaced Cardiff Arms Park as the national stadium of Wales in 1999.

Wales has competed annually in the Six Nations Championship (previously the Home Nations Championship and Five Nations Championship) since it was established in 1883. They have won the tournament (and its predecessors) outright 28 times, most recently in 2021. Since the Six Nations was formed in 2000, Wales have won six Six Nations titles, including four Grand Slams, and finished bottom twice. Wales has also participated in every Rugby World Cup since the competition was established in 1987; they finished third in the inaugural tournament and have since made two semi-finals, in 2011 and 2019. Wales were the host nation for the 1999 Rugby World Cup, although matches were also played in England, Scotland, Ireland and France.

The Wales team experienced their first &#x27;golden age&#x27; between 1900 and 1911; they first played New Zealand in 1905, winning 3–0 in a famous match at Cardiff Arms Park, and between March 1907 and January 1910, they won 11 consecutive matches, a record that stood for over a century. Welsh rugby struggled between the two World Wars, but experienced a second &#x27;golden age&#x27; between 1969 and 1980, when they won eight Five Nations Championships. In addition to their Six Nations successes, Wales also finished fourth at both the 2011 Rugby World Cup and 2019 Rugby World Cup. Additionally Wales won 14 consecutive matches between March 2018 and March 2019, and reached number 1 in the World Rugby Rankings for the first time in August 2019. Eight former Welsh players have been inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame; 10 were inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame prior to its 2014 merger into the World Rugby Hall of Fame.

===Early years (1881–1892)===
Rugby union took root in Wales in 1850, when Reverend Rowland Williams became Vice-Principal at St David&#x27;s College, Lampeter, and introduced the sport there. Wales played their first international match on 19 February 1881; organised by Newport&#x27;s Richard Mullock and captained by James Bevan, they played against England, losing by seven goals, one drop goal and six tries to nil (82–0 in modern scoring values). On 12 March 1881, the Welsh Rugby Union was formed at The Castle Hotel, Neath. Two years later, the Home Nations Championship – now the Six Nations Championship – was first played, but Wales did not register a win. However, rugby in Wales developed and, by the 1890s, the Welsh had introduced the &quot;four three-quarters&quot; formation – with seven backs and eight forwards instead of six backs and nine forwards – which revolutionised the sport and was eventually adopted almost universally at international and club level.

===First &#x27;golden age&#x27; (1893–1913)===

With the &quot;four three-quarters&quot; formation, Wales won the Home Nations Championship for the first time in 1893, winning the Triple Crown in the process. Wales next won the Championship in 1900, heralding the first &quot;golden age&quot; of Welsh rugby, which was to last until 1911. They won two more Triple Crowns in 1902 and 1905, and were runners-up in 1901, 1903 and 1904.
In 1906, Wales again won the Home Nations Championship, and later that year played South Africa for the first time. Wales were favourites to win the match, but South Africa dominated in the forwards and eventually won 11–0. Two years later, on 12 December 1908, Wales played the touring Australians, who they defeated 9–6.

In 1909, Wales won the Home Nations Championship and then, in 1910 – with the inclusion of France – the first Five Nations. In 1911, Wales took the first Five Nations Grand Slam, winning all their matches in the tournament. It would be nearly 40 years before they achieved a Grand Slam again. England&#x27;s defeat of Wales at Cardiff in 1913 was Wales&#x27; first home loss to one of the Home Nations since 1899, and their first home loss to England since 1895. The Great War came in 1914 and rugby was suspended for the duration.

==== &quot;The Game of the Century&quot; ====

When Wales faced New Zealand at Cardiff Arms Park in late 1905, they had not lost at home since 1899. This New Zealand team – referred to as &quot;The Original All Blacks&quot; – was the first of the southern hemisphere national teams to visit the British Isles, and were undefeated on their tour up to that point, having already beaten England, Ireland and Scotland.

Before the match, New Zealand team performed a haka (a Māori posture dance); the 47,000-strong crowd responded with the Welsh national anthem – &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot; (&quot;Land of My Fathers&quot;) – the first time a national anthem had been sung before a sporting fixture. Wales wing Teddy Morgan scored a try to give Wales a 3–0 lead, before New Zealand&#x27;s Bob Deans claimed to have scored a try, only to be dragged behind the goal-line before the referee arrived. The referee awarded a scrum to Wales and the score remained unchanged; Wales won 3–0. The loss was New Zealand&#x27;s only defeat on their 35-match tour.

===Post-war years (1920–1968)===

The post-First World War years marked a decline in Welsh rugby. An industrial recession struck the country, and hurt South Wales in particular. Welsh international results in the 1920s mirrored the performance of the economy: of their 42 matches, they won only 17, with three drawn. Half a million people emigrated from Wales to find work elsewhere during the depression; this included many Welsh rugby union internationals, who moved to the professional code of rugby league. Between 1923 and 1928, Wales managed only seven victories – five of them against France. However, even France managed to defeat Wales that decade, achieving their first victory in 1928. Welsh selection policy reflected the upheavals of the mid-1920s. In 1924, 35 different players were selected for Wales&#x27; four matches, with a different captain for each, and only Edward Watkins in the backs and Charlie Pugh in the forwards playing in all four matches.

A resurgence of both economy and rugby union followed in the 1930s and, in 1931, Wales won their first championship for nine years. That year, for the first time since the First World War, Wales retained the same side for two consecutive matches when they faced England and Scotland. Then, in 1933, captained by Watcyn Thomas, Wales defeated England at Twickenham. In 1935, Wales beat the touring New Zealand side 13–12, with Haydn Tanner making his first appearance. Although the Five Nations Championship was suspended during the Second World War, Wales did play a Red Cross charity match against England at Cardiff in 1940, losing 18–9.

After the Second World War, Wales played a New Zealand Army team (&quot;the Kiwis&quot;) in 1946, losing 11–3. The Five Nations (suspended during the war) resumed in 1947, when Wales shared the title with England. Although Wales suffered their first home defeat to France in 1948, they won their first Five Nations Grand Slam since 1911 in 1950. The next year, they lost 6–3 to the touring South Africans, despite dominating in the line-outs. They achieved another Grand Slam in 1952, followed by a 13–8 win over New Zealand in 1953. In 1954, St Helen&#x27;s in Swansea (a Welsh international venue since 1882) hosted its last international and Cardiff Arms Park officially became the home of the Welsh team. In 1956, Wales again won the Five Nations, but they did not regain the title until 1964 and did not win it outright until 1965.
Wales conducted their first overseas tour in 1964, playing several games and one test in South Africa. They lost the test against South Africa in Durban 24–3, their biggest defeat in 40 years. At the WRU annual general meeting that year, the outgoing WRU President D. Ewart Davies declared that &quot;it was evident from the experience of the South African Tour that a much more positive attitude to the game was required in Wales ... Players must be prepared to learn, and indeed re-learn, to the absolute point of mastery, the basic principles of Rugby Union football&quot;. This started the coaching revolution. The WRU Coaching Committee – set up in the late 1950s – was given the task of improving the quality of coaching and, in January 1967, Ray Williams was appointed Coaching Organiser. The first national coach, David Nash, was appointed in 1967 to coach Wales for the season, but resigned when the WRU refused to allow him to accompany Wales on their 1968 tour of Argentina. Eventually, the WRU reversed their decision, appointing Clive Rowlands to tour as coach. Of the six matches, Wales won three, drew two and lost one.

===Second &#x27;golden age&#x27; (1969–1979)===
Wales enjoyed a second &quot;golden age&quot; in the 1970s, with world-class players such as Gareth Edwards, J. P. R. Williams, Gerald Davies, Barry John, and Mervyn Davies in their side. Wales dominated Northern Hemisphere rugby between 1969 and 1979, and managed an incredible winning record, losing only seven times during that period. Wales toured New Zealand for the first time in 1969, but were defeated in both matches. In the second test, which they lost 33–12, New Zealand fullback Fergie McCormick scored 24 points; a record at the time.

In 1970, Wales shared the Five Nations with France, and recorded a 6–6 draw against South Africa in Cardiff. The following year, Wales recorded their first Five Nations Grand Slam since 1952. Using only 16 players in four games, the 1971 side achieved their most notable win of the tournament in their victory over Scotland; after a last-minute try by Gerald Davies that reduced Scotland&#x27;s lead to 18–17, flanker John Taylor kicked a conversion from the sideline described as &quot;the greatest conversion since St Paul&quot; to give Wales a 19–18 win. Wales contributed more players than any other team to the British Lions side that toured New Zealand that year. Those Lions became the only ones to win a series over New Zealand.

In the 1972 Five Nations Championship, Wales and Scotland refused to travel to Ireland at the height of the Troubles after receiving threats, purportedly from the Irish Republican Army. The Championship remained unresolved with Wales and Ireland unbeaten. Although the Five Nations was a five-way tie in 1973, the Welsh did defeat Australia 24–0 in Cardiff.

Wales next won the Five Nations outright in 1975, and in 1976, Wales won their second Grand Slam of the decade. Just like the first in 1971, they used only 16 players over their four matches. They repeated the feat in 1978 and, in the process, became the first team to win three consecutive Triple Crowns. Following their final Five Nations match of 1978, both Phil Bennett and Gareth Edwards retired from rugby.

Wales hosted New Zealand at Cardiff Arms Park in November 1978, losing 13–12 after a late penalty goal by the replacement New Zealand fullback, Brian McKechnie. The penalty was controversial because New Zealand lock Andy Haden had dived out of a line-out in an attempt to earn a penalty. Haden later admitted that he and Frank Oliver had pre-agreed this tactic should they find themselves in difficulties. Referee Roger Quittenton was criticised by the press for failing to notice the dive, but he later stated that the penalty had been given against Welsh lock Geoff Wheel for jumping off the shoulder of Oliver. Quittenton later said, &quot;Haden&#x27;s perception is that his dive secured the penalty. That is a load of rubbish&quot;. Wales then went on to win the 1979 Five Nations with a Triple Crown.

===Barren years (1980–2003)===

In 1980, the WRU&#x27;s centenary year, Wales lost 23–3 to New Zealand in Cardiff, with the All Blacks scoring four tries to nil. Wales won two matches in the Five Nations Championships of both 1980 and 1981, and in 1983 were nearly upset by Japan, winning 29–24 at Cardiff. In 1984, Australia defeated Wales 28–9 at Cardiff Arms Park.

Wales achieved only one win in 1987&#x27;s Five Nations before contesting the inaugural Rugby World Cup. Wales defeated Ireland in their crucial pool fixture, before defeating England in the quarter-finals. They then faced hosts New Zealand, who won 49–6, but beat Australia in the third place play-off game to claim third. The next year Wales won the Triple Crown for the first time since 1979, but heavy defeats on tour to New Zealand later that year saw the end of a number of Welsh players&#x27; careers, as several converted to rugby league.

Welsh rugby reached a nadir when Wales suffered their first Five Nations Championship whitewash; they had upset England in 1989 to avoid losing all their Championship matches that season, but in 1990, Wales were defeated in all four Five Nations&#x27; matches for the first time, before almost doing the same the following year. The 1991 World Cup saw further frustration, when Wales were upset by Samoa in their opening match. A second group-stage loss, by 38–3 to Australia, eliminated Wales from the tournament.

After winning two Five Nations games in 1992, and one in 1993, Wales won the Championship in 1994 on points difference. But without defeating one of Australia, New Zealand or South Africa during the inter-World Cup period, and again losing all four of their matches at the 1995 Five Nations Championship, Wales was not considered a major contender for the 1995 Rugby World Cup. At the 1995 World Cup, after comprehensively beating Japan, Wales lost to New Zealand; this meant that they needed to defeat Ireland to qualify for the quarter-finals. Wales lost 24–23 and so failed to progress beyond the pool stage for the second time, and later that year Kevin Bowring replaced Alec Evans to become Wales&#x27; first full-time coach.

Record defeats of 51–0 to France and 96–13 to South Africa, prompted the WRU to appoint New Zealander Graham Henry as coach in 1998. Henry had early success as coach, leading Wales to a 10-match winning streak; this included Wales&#x27; first victory over South Africa, a 29–19 win in the first match played at the Millennium Stadium. Henry was consequently nicknamed &quot;the Great Redeemer&quot; by the Welsh media and fans, a reference to the opening line of &quot;Cwm Rhondda&quot;, a popular song among Welsh rugby fans. Hosting the 1999 World Cup, Wales qualified for the quarter-finals for the first time since 1987, but lost 24–9 to eventual champions Australia. A lack of success in the Five and Six Nations (Italy joined the tournament in 2000), and especially a number of heavy losses to Ireland, led to Henry&#x27;s resignation in February 2002; his assistant Steve Hansen took over.

During Hansen&#x27;s tenure, the WRU implemented a significant change in the structure of the game domestically. Regional teams were introduced as a tier above the traditional club-based structures in 2003, and the five (later four) regional sides became the top level of domestic professional rugby in the country. At the 2003 World Cup, Wales scored four tries in their 53–37 pool stage loss to New Zealand, before losing in the quarter-finals to the eventual tournament winners, England, despite outscoring them by three tries to one.

=== Revival under Ruddock and coaching changes (2004–2007) ===
Coached by Mike Ruddock, Wales won their first Grand Slam since 1978 and their first Six Nations Grand Slam in 2005. A late long-range penalty from Gavin Henson gave them victory over England in Cardiff for the first time in 12 years, and after victories over Italy, France and Scotland, they faced Ireland in front of a capacity crowd at the Millennium Stadium where Wales&#x27; 32–20 victory gave them their first Championship since 1994. Later that year, they suffered a record home loss, 41–3 to New Zealand.

Ruddock resigned as head coach midway through the 2006 Six Nations, where Wales finished fifth, and Gareth Jenkins was eventually appointed as his replacement. Jenkins led Wales through the 2007 World Cup, where they failed to advance beyond the pool stage after losing their final game 38–34 to Fiji, thanks to a Graham Dewes try. Jenkins subsequently lost his job, and Warren Gatland, a New Zealander, was appointed as his successor.

=== Gatland era (2008–2019) ===

Wales faced England at Twickenham for Gatland&#x27;s inaugural match as coach and their first match of the 2008 Six Nations. They had not defeated England there since 1988, and went on to win 26–19. They won all their matches in the Championship, conceding only two tries in the process, to claim another Grand Slam. Later that year, Wales defeated Australia 21–18 in Cardiff, but then started a six-year, 23-game winless streak against the southern hemisphere nations of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.

At the 2011 World Cup, Wales reached the semi-finals for the first time since 1987, but lost 9–8 to France after captain Sam Warburton was sent off. The two teams met again in March 2012, with Wales needing a win to claim their third Six Nations Grand Slam in eight years, which they did with a 16–9 victory. This was followed immediately by an eight-match losing streak that was eventually broken during the 2013 Six Nations, where Wales retained the Championship for the first time since 1979. Wales reached the quarter-finals of the 2015 World Cup at the expense of hosts England, before losing 23–19 to South Africa. Wales also achieved a fourth Grand Slam in 14 years and their first in seven years in the 2019 Six Nations.

Wales reached the top spot in the men&#x27;s World Rugby Rankings in August 2019, holding the position for two weeks. They went on to top their pool at the 2019 Rugby World Cup, winning all their pool matches for the first time since the inaugural tournament in 1987, and ultimately reached the semi-finals before they were knocked out by eventual champions South Africa; Wales lost to New Zealand in the bronze final and finished fourth in the tournament.

=== Pivac era (2019–2022) ===
In July 2018, it was announced that then-Scarlets coach Wayne Pivac would succeed Gatland as Wales coach following the 2019 Rugby World Cup. Pivac&#x27;s first match in charge was a match against a Barbarians side coach by Gatland in November 2019. Despite winning Pivac&#x27;s first full international in charge in the 2020 Six Nations against Italy, Wales only recorded two other wins all year, finishing fifth in both the Six Nations and the Autumn Nations Cup. 2021 saw highs and lows. Wales won their fourth Six Nations title of the last decade, though they fell short of winning the Grand Slam at the death of their final match against France in Paris. They faced Argentina in a two-match test series, in which they drew the opening game and Wales lost in the second game 33–11. That autumn, Wales opened with losses to New Zealand and South Africa before beating Fiji and Australia.

Wales slumped to a fifth-place finish in the 2022 Six Nations Championship, their sole win coming at home against Scotland. In the final week of the tournament, Wales lost to Italy 22–21, their first ever home loss to the Italians.

They then embarked on a tour to South Africa over the summer. Wales narrowly lost the first test, losing 32–29 after a late penalty from Springbok outside half Handre Pollard. The following week, Wales secured their first ever win on South African soil, winning 13–12 in Bloemfontein. South Africa won the final test, and secured a 2–1 series win.

=== Second Gatland spell and record losing run (2022–2025) ===
On 5 December 2022, Warren Gatland was reappointed as head coach, following a review of Wayne Pivac and his performance in the 2022 Autumn Nations Series. The contract saw Gatland appointed as head coach through to the end of the 2023 Rugby World Cup, with the potential to extend for an additional four years, through the 2027 Rugby World Cup. Gatland&#x27;s initial coaching team included Alex King as attack coach, Mike Forshaw as defence coach, Jonathan Humphreys as forwards coach and Neil Jenkins as skills coach. Jonathan Thomas was added as a contact area skills coach.
In November 2024, they lost 24–19 to Fiji in the Autumn Nations Series. This was their tenth loss in a row, equalling a record set by head coach Steve Hansen from 2002 to 2003. It was also the first time Wales had ever lost to Fiji at the Millenium Stadium. A week later, they lost 52–20 to Australia at the Millennium Stadium, a record 11th straight consecutive defeat.

Throughout the 2025 Six Nations, they fell to 12th in the world rankings, below Six Nations hopefuls Georgia, following a second defeat to Italy in consecutive years and a first loss in Rome since the 2007 tournament. This was also their record 14th successive defeat in all competitions and an 8th consecutive defeat in Six Nations fixtures. Following this result, Warren Gatland&#x27;s departure as head coach was confirmed on 11 February 2025. He was replaced on an interim basis by Cardiff Rugby head coach Matt Sherratt, who would take charge of the side for the remainder for the 2025 Six Nations.

==Strip==

Wales play in red jerseys, white (or some times, black) shorts and red socks. For the 2015–16 season, the jersey design incorporated gold for the first time. The jerseys are embroidered with the WRU logo, which is based on the Prince of Wales&#x27;s feathers. The original motto beneath the feathers was a German phrase, &quot;Ich dien&quot;, meaning &quot;I serve&quot;, but this has been replaced with large letters reading &quot;WRU&quot;.

Wales&#x27;s alternate strip as of 2023 is black with yellow accents, inspired by the Flag of Saint David although there have been various different coloured strips in the past. Former change strips worn by Wales have used black, navy, white, yellow, grey &amp; green as their predominant colours. Wales previously wore black jerseys as part of celebrations for the WRU&#x27;s 125th anniversary in 2005. The jersey was worn against Fiji and then Australia that year; the Australia match was the first time Wales had not played in their red jersey against one of their traditional rivals.

In 1992, the Welsh Rugby Union agreed a deal with Cotton Traders to produce the national team&#x27;s kits. They were replaced in 1996 by Reebok, whose contract with the Welsh Rugby Union was worth £1.3 million in 1999. Wales received the first jersey sponsor in their history in 2000, when Redstone Telecoms agreed a deal worth £2 million. Redstone was replaced two years later by Reebok subsidiary Rockport, in a deal worth £1 million, followed by Brains Brewery in 2004, in conjunction with a four-year extension to the Reebok deal. Due to French alcohol advertising regulations, the &quot;Brains&quot; name was replaced by &quot;Brawn&quot; for the 2005 Six Nations Championship match between France and Wales at the Stade de France, and by &quot;Brawn Again&quot; for the corresponding match two years later. The Brains deal was extended in June 2008 until September 2009, with &quot;Brains SA&quot; appearing on Wales home shirts and &quot;SA Gold&quot; appearing on the team&#x27;s yellow change shirts. For the away match against France in February 2009, the &quot;Brains SA&quot; logo was replaced by the words &quot;Try Essai&quot;; &quot;essai&quot; is the French word for a try, but is also pronounced the same as &quot;SA&quot;, meaning the branding could have been viewed as &quot;an invitation to &#x27;try&#x27; Wales&#x27; best loved beer brand&quot;.

In 2008, Under Armour replaced Reebok as Wales&#x27; kit manufacturer in a four-year deal worth £10 million. Welsh insurance company Admiral replaced Brains as the main shirt sponsors in 2010, signing a three-year contract. That deal was extended by two years in both in 2013 and 2015, with the latter described as the WRU&#x27;s &quot;biggest shirt partnership deal in its history&quot;. In 2017, Japanese motor company Isuzu replaced Admiral as the main sponsors of the Wales team&#x27;s home shirts. Between 2017 &amp; 2019 the sponsorship of the team&#x27;s alternate shirt was taken on by Subaru as a result of both Subaru &amp; Izuzu&#x27;s UK imports being handled by IM Group. In October 2015, the WRU agreed a nine-year, £33 million extension to its contract with Under Armour, only for both parties to mutually terminate the deal four years early in 2020.

A new, seven-year contract with Italian company Macron was agreed in September 2020, believed to be worth around £30 million. In 2021 Cazoo replaced Izuzu as the shirt sponsor in a two-year deal, however Izuzu remained a partner of the WRU. In June 2023, Vodafone replaced Cazoo as the front of shirt sponsor (although it had already been present on the women&#x27;s team&#x27;s shirts since 2022), A month later, it was announced that comparison site Go.Compare would become the first back-of-shirt sponsor of the team. The new Macron kits were launched toward the end of July (Just after the 2023 World cup shirts) at which point it was also announced that player names would return to the back of the shirts, having previously been present between 2005 &amp; 2008.

==Support==

Rugby union and Wales&#x27; national team hold an important place in Welsh culture and society. Sport historian John Bale has stated that &quot;rugby is characteristically Welsh&quot;, and David Andrew said that &quot;To the popular consciousness, rugby is as Welsh as coal mining, male voice choirs, &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot;, Dylan Thomas, and Tom Jones&quot;. Welsh rugby&#x27;s first &#x27;golden age&#x27; (1900–1911) coincided with the country&#x27;s zenith during the 20th century, and rugby was important in building Wales&#x27; modern identity. There is a long tradition of Welsh supporters singing before and during matches. The choral tradition developed in Wales during the 19th century alongside the rise of nonconformity, and has extended to singing at rugby matches. Commonly sung songs include the hymn &quot;Cwm Rhondda&quot;, Tom Jones&#x27; &quot;Delilah&quot;, and Max Boyce&#x27;s &quot;Hymns and Arias&quot;.

==Home stadium==

Wales&#x27; first home international was played in 1882 at St Helen&#x27;s Ground in Swansea. In the 1880s and 1890s, home Welsh internationals were played at Cardiff, Swansea, Newport and Llanelli. Swansea continued to be used as an international venue until 1954, when Cardiff Arms Park became Wales&#x27; primary home venue. Cardiff Arms Park first had a stand erected in 1881, and continued to expand its seating that decade. Crowds continued to grow and in 1902 in Wales&#x27; match against Scotland a world record 40,000 spectators paid to see the match. In 1911, the owners of the Arms Park, the Marquess of Bute&#x27;s family, confirmed Wales&#x27; tenure and during the 1920s and 1930s, Wales gradually gained increasing control. A new stand was built at the park in the 1933–34 season, which increased the grounds&#x27; capacity to 56,000.

By 1958, the WRU had concluded that a new national ground was needed due to flooding that often affected Arms Park. After debate and disputes between the WRU and various other parties, including Cardiff RFC, it was decided in the 1960s that a new national stadium would be built with a new ground for the Cardiff club backing onto it. The National Stadium, as it was known, was officially opened in 1970.

Since 1999, Wales have played all their home matches at the 74,500-capacity Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, which is also Wales&#x27; national stadium. The Millennium Stadium was first conceived in 1994, when a group redevelopment committee was set up. It was decided to replace the National Stadium at Cardiff Arms Park after a review found it was out of date; new legislation also required stadia to be all-seated. Construction of the new stadium began in September 1997, and was completed by June 1999, in time for the Rugby World Cup. The construction, which cost the WRU £126 million, was funded by private investment, £46 million of public funds from the National Lottery, the sale of debentures to supporters (offering guaranteed tickets in exchange for an interest-free loan), and loans. While the new ground was being built, Wales used the old Wembley Stadium for their home matches – a deal reciprocated during construction of the new Wembley, when FA Cup finals were held at the Millennium Stadium.

==Record==

===Six Nations===
Wales compete annually in the Six Nations Championship, which is played against five other European nations: England, France, Ireland, Italy, and Scotland. The Six Nations started as the Home Nations Championship in 1883, as a contest between the four component nations of the United Kingdom. Wales first won it in 1893, when they achieved a Triple Crown. Wales have won the tournament outright 28 times, and shared 12 other victories. Their longest wait between championships was 11 years (1994–2005). Wales first won a Grand Slam in 1908 – although France did not officially join the Five Nations until 1910 – and their first Six Nations Grand Slam in 2005. Their most recent Grand Slam was won in 2019 with victory over Ireland on the final day of the Six Nations tournament. Their most recent Triple Crown was won in 2021 with victory over England in the third round of the Six Nations tournament. In 2024 Wales received the wooden spoon for the first time in 21 years.

===World Cup===
Wales have contested every Rugby World Cup since the inaugural tournament in 1987.

The 1987 tournament was Wales&#x27; most successful; they won all three pool matches and their quarter-final, before losing to the All Blacks in the semi-finals. They then faced Australia in the third place play-off match, which they won 22–21.

In the next two tournaments in 1991 and 1995, Wales failed to progress beyond the pool stage, winning just one match in each tournament. They also became the first co host nation to not make it out of the pool stage in 1991.

Both the 1999 and 2003 tournaments were more successful, with Wales qualifying for the quarter-finals both times. Wales hosted the event in 1999 and topped their pool only to lose to eventual winners Australia in the quarter-finals.

In 2003, they finished second in their pool behind the All Blacks, and faced England in the quarter-finals. They lost to England, the eventual champions, 28–17. Wales conceded 17 penalties, and their lack of discipline proved costly.

In the 2007 World Cup, Wales again failed to progress from the pool stage. After a loss to Australia, and two wins against Japan and Canada, they faced Fiji for a place in the quarter-finals. The game started poorly for Wales who were behind 25–3 at half-time. They fought back to lead by three points with six minutes remaining, but Fiji then scored a try to win 38–34 and eliminated Wales from the tournament.

At the 2011 World Cup, Wales reached the semi-finals for the first time since 1987. Playing the semi-finals against France, Wales lost 9–8, in a game overshadowed by the 18th-minute sending off of Wales&#x27; captain Sam Warburton for a dangerous tackle against Vincent Clerc.

At the 2015 World Cup Wales were in the same pool as Australia, England, Fiji and Uruguay. They finished second in the pool behind Australia and ahead of hosts England. South Africa defeated Wales in the quarter-finals.

In the 2019 World Cup Wales were in pool D with Australia, Fiji, Georgia and Uruguay. They won all their group matches to finish top of the pool. After defeating France in the quarter-finals, they lost to the eventual tournament winners South Africa in the semi-finals.

In the 2023 World Cup Wales were in pool C with Australia, Fiji, Georgia and Portugal. They won all their group matches to finish top of the pool. Argentina defeated Wales in the quarter finals.

===Overall===
When the World Rugby Rankings were introduced in October 2003, Wales were ranked 8th. They rose to 7th in June 2004, before falling back to 8th in November that year. Following a Grand Slam win in the 2005 Six Nations, they rose to a ranking position of 5th. They fell to 9th by June 2006, and, after rising back to 8th by September, fell to 10th after the 2007 World Cup. A second Six Nations&#x27; Grand Slam in 2008 propelled them to 6th in the rankings, but following losses to South Africa in the mid-year and end-of-year internationals Wales slipped to 7th. Wales climbed to 4th after a win over Scotland in their first match of the 2009 Six Nations. They slumped to 9th in 2010 but rose back to 4th after their fourth place in the 2011 World Cup. Since then, Wales have ranked the majority of the time among the top six teams. They reached 2nd during the 2015 Rugby World Cup, before hitting top spot for the first time on 19 August 2019, after winning 15 of their last 16 games.

Wales have won 406 of their 800 Test matches. Their biggest Test defeat was a 96–13 loss to South Africa in 1998, and their largest victory was a 98–0 defeat of Japan in 2004. Their record for most tries in a match is 16, scored against Portugal in 1994 – they also scored 102 points in this match, more than in any other Test. Wales&#x27; record for consecutive Test wins is 14, and for consecutive losses is 15.

==Coaches==
Following the unsuccessful tour to South Africa in 1964, the WRU set up a working party on coaching. The party recommended that Welsh clubs accept the principle of coaching. David Nash was appointed as the national team&#x27;s first coach in 1967, but for the 1968 tour of Argentina, the WRU initially planned not to have a coach tour with the team. Following pressure from the Welsh clubs at the WRU&#x27;s annual general meeting, the decision was reversed and Clive Rowlands was appointed as coach for the tour. The appointing of a coach for the team coincided with Wales&#x27; success in the Five Nations during the 1970s.

<text>A civic center or civic centre is a prominent land area within a community that is constructed to be its focal point or center. It usually contains one or more dominant public buildings, which may also include a government building. Recently, the term &quot;civic center&quot; has been used in reference to an entire central business district of a community or a major shopping center in the middle of a community. In this type of civic center, special attention is paid to the way public structures are grouped and landscaped.

In some American cities, a multi-purpose arena is named &quot;Civic Center&quot;, for example Columbus Civic Center. Such &quot;civic centers&quot; combine venues for sporting events, theaters, concerts and similar events.

In Australia, a civic centre can refer to a civic precinct, a show or meeting venue, or can also be used as a brand of Shopping Centre.

===United Kingdom===

In most cases civic centres in the UK are a focus for local government offices and public service buildings. The Cardiff Civic Centre is probably the oldest and best preserved civic centre in the UK. With the reforms of local government in London in 1965 and across England in anticipation of the implementation of the Redcliffe-Maud Report in 1974, a number of local authorities commissioned new civic centres sometimes funded by disposing of their 19th Century Town Hall buildings. Sir Basil Spence was responsible for designing three of these civic centres:

*&quot;Hampstead Civic Centre&quot;, which was only partially completed; and of which only the Swiss Cottage Library (1964) still exists.
*&quot;Sunderland Civic Centre&quot; (1970).
*&quot;Kensington and Chelsea Civic Centre&quot; (1977).

Other noteworthy civic centres include:
*&quot;Barking and Dagenham Civic Centre&quot; at Becontree Heath (1937).
*Southampton Civic Centre (1932).
*Newport Civic Centre (main building 1940, clock tower completed 1964).
*Plymouth Civic Centre (1950–1962), Devon, Architect Hector J W Stirling.
*Newcastle Civic Centre (1967).
*Civic Centre, Swansea (opened in 1982 as the County Hall)

War on Want&#x27;s slogan is &quot;poverty is political&quot; and its stated focus is on the root causes of poverty rather than its effects.

War on Want is a membership organisation governed by an elected council of management drawn from its membership. War on Want patrons include Naomi Klein, Owen Jones, Raj Patel and Mark Serwotka.

==History==
The organisation was formed in 1951 after a letter in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; from Victor Gollancz was read by Harold Wilson, later British Prime Minister, who coined the name. Since then, the organisation has taken part in many campaigns and investigations, including in the 1970s helping to expose baby food companies marketing powdered milk infant formula as a healthier option than breast milk to mothers in the developing world – a dangerous and expensive option for these mothers who had no access to safe drinking water and sterilisation facilities.

In the 1980s, War on Want campaigned on the role of women in the developing world, and supported liberation movements in Eritrea, South Africa and Western Sahara.

From 1983 to 1987, George Galloway was General Secretary of War on Want. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; accused Galloway of living luxuriously at the charity&#x27;s expense. An independent auditor cleared him of misuse of funds, though he did repay £1,720 in contested expenses. The official history of the charity says that Galloway&#x27;s methods of management created interpersonal problems among the staff, and although the charity grew under Galloway, his period in charge was followed by a serious internal crisis.

More than two years after Galloway stepped down as general secretary after being elected as a Labour MP, the British Government&#x27;s Charity Commission investigated War on Want, finding accounting irregularities including that the financial reports were &quot;materially mis-stated&quot; from 1985 to 1989, but little evidence that money was used for non-charitable purposes. Galloway had been general secretary for the first three of those years. The commission said responsibility lay largely with auditors and did not single out individuals for blame. War on Want was found to have been insolvent, and subsequently dismissed most of its staff and narrowly avoided administration. It was relaunched in 1991.

In the 1990s, it focused on issues that resulted from globalisation, including workers&#x27; rights and a call to set up a Tobin tax on currency speculation. The charity set up the Tobin tax Network (now a separate charity called Stamp Out Poverty) to develop the proposal and press for its introduction.

In 2006 War on Want launched a campaign for Palestinian human rights, including a report titled &quot;Profiting from the Occupation&quot;, which looked at European corporations who the charity claimed were profiting from Israel&#x27;s occupation of Palestinian territories. The campaign was praised by &quot;The Guardian&quot; at the time, which named the charity &quot;Campaign of the Week&quot;. In 2007 MP Lee Scott complained to the Charity Commission about an online &quot;guide for boycott, divestment and sanctions&quot; against Israel. War on Want said it already had permission from the Commission to advocate boycotts and sanctions to address &quot;the root causes of poverty and human rights abuses&quot;. In July 2009 the Commission concluded that no regulatory action was required, declaring itself satisfied that the charity&#x27;s trustees understood the official guidance on campaigning by charities and that War on Want&#x27;s campaigns on Palestine were linked to its charitable objects, making them legitimate under charity law. War on Want has continued its support of the BDS movement.

In 2011, War on Want marked its 60th anniversary with a repeat of the Yes campaign that first formed the charity, asking people to email the word Yes to show their support for withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. They delivered the petition to Foreign Secretary William Hague.

==Current work==
===Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership===

War on Want is campaigning against the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). TTIP is a proposed free trade agreement being secretly negotiated between the European Union and the United States. It argues that TTIP will cost more than one million jobs, lead to the irreversible privatisation of public services, a &quot;race to the bottom&quot; in food, environmental and labour standards and allow US companies to sue the UK government in private courts.

===Israel===

War on Want is calling for a two-way arms embargo between the UK and Israel. War on Want believes that by selling arms to Israel, the UK government is complicit in Israel&#x27;s crimes against the Palestinian people. War on Want advocates for a boycott of Israel until it complies with international law. It also campaigns to expose companies which sustain and profit from the Israeli-occupied territories.

===Food sovereignty===

War on Want&#x27;s &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; report revealed how the Department for International Development (DFID) used hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers&#x27; money with the express purpose of extending the power of agribusiness over the production of food in Africa. War on Want believes the root cause of the global food crisis is that food is treated like a financial commodity to be traded, and not a right for communities. It believes food production should be in the hands of small-scale producers.

===Other campaigns===
In its campaigning and programmes strands of work, War on Want focuses on
* corporate accountability
* private security companies
* the rights of Palestinians and putting a stop to the separation barrier
* the rights of the Saharawi in Western Sahara
* campaigning for tax justice
* securing workers&#x27; rights and a living wage for everyone
* informal economy
* sweatshop and plantation workers
* trade justice
* food justice
* halting the privatisation of vital resources in the global South
* The papers of War on Want are held at SOAS Archives

Organisations supported include those helping small-scale farmers in Sri Lanka, sweatshop workers in Bangladesh, olive farmers in the Palestinian territories and factory workers in China.

War on Want has released a series of &quot;alternative reports&quot; highlighting issues such as Coca-Cola&#x27;s overseas activities allegedly causing poverty and environmental damage. It has also released research on alleged human rights abuses by private military and security companies in Iraq and elsewhere, and a report highlighting how companies such as Tesco, Primark and Asda sell goods made by sweatshop labour in Bangladesh. War on Want campaigns against these corporations, and calls for the British government to regulate these industries as well for as the businesses themselves to take responsibility for their actions. In 2010, War on Want released a report exposing the companies that it describes as &quot;profiting&quot; from Israel&#x27;s occupation of the West Bank, and calling on ordinary people around the world to take action.

==Response==

===Solidarity===
War on Want has issued numerous statements of solidarity with organisations and movements all over the world. In October 2009, War on Want issued a statement of solidarity with Abahlali baseMjondolo in response to attacks on the Kennedy Road informal settlement and wrote a letter to the South African High Commissioner in London. The charity also spearheaded a campaign highlighting the forced displacement of poor South Africans in the lead-up to the 2010 World Cup.

===Israel boycott===

In 2010, War on Want&#x27;s campaign &quot;Help win justice for the Palestinian people this Christmas&quot; accused Israel of &quot;illegal Occupation,&quot; &quot;daily human rights abuses,&quot; and &quot;the siege on Gaza and the Apartheid Wall.&quot; As in previous years, War on Want called for holiday donations in the form of &quot;alternative gifts,&quot; to &quot;launch a sustained campaign against UK companies that are profiting from the Occupation&quot; and to &quot;secure compensation for those who have lost land due to construction of the Apartheid Wall.&quot;

NGO Monitor&#x27;s Dan Kosky wrote that due to War on Want&#x27;s support of an Israel boycott and its stand against the British presence in Iraq, a thorough review of the organization should be conducted by the UK regarding funding, for &quot;if not, the United Kingdom could find itself aiding an Israel boycott campaign.&quot; In January 2018, War on Want was listed as one of 20 anti-Israel BDS organizations banned from entering Israel and Israeli-occupied territory. Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan who formulated the list stated, &quot;Boycott organisations need to know that Israel will act against them and will not allow [them] to enter its territory in order to harm its citizens.&quot; In response, War on Want stated &quot;For 70 years, Israel has subjected Palestinians to a range of human rights abuses including travel bans... this blacklist is a repressive tactic borrowed from the same playbook used by the apartheid regime in South Africa.&quot;

In October 2018, War on Want&#x27;s PayPal account was terminated after receiving a complaint from two pro-Israeli legal groups; the Lawfare Project and UK Lawyers for Israel. The groups alleged that War on Want had links to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The groups also lodged a complaint with the Charity Commission which, however, in July 2019 cleared the charity of any wrongdoing.

In April 2020, &quot;Oliver Taylor&quot; got articles published in &quot;Arutz Sheva&quot;, &quot;The Algemeiner&quot;, &quot;The Times of Israel&quot;, and &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;. In these, he repeated the allegations made by the pro-Israeli groups that War on Want had &quot;ties to terrorist entities&quot;. Taylor described himself as a &quot;24-year-old student, barista, and political activist. During the week I work on completing my masters in political science, and come the weekend you will find me engrossed in all things coffee. Whether I am brewing it or sipping it.&quot; His profile photo was that of a young brown-eyed man smiling with a light stubble. But a report by &quot;Reuters&quot; concluded that Taylor most likely did not exist. There was no record of Oliver Taylor on the University of Birmingham where he supposedly studied and the six experts interviewed by &quot;Reuters&quot; agreed that the profile photo was a deepfake. The websites were forced to take down the articles when contacted by lawyers. Who actually penned those articles remained a mystery.

== Finances ==

Income in the years from 2011/12 to 2015/16 ranged from £1.6m (2011/12) to a high point of £2.1m (2014/15), with public donations and legacies the main source.

*The Network for Social Change
*The Open Society Foundation
*The Polden Puckham Charitable Foundation

<text>Pavel Kubina (born April 15, 1977) is a Czech former professional ice hockey defenceman who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Tampa Bay Lightning, Toronto Maple Leafs, Atlanta Thrashers and Philadelphia Flyers from 1998 to 2012.

==Playing career==
Kubina began his professional career with HC Vítkovice of the Czech Extraliga. He played there for four seasons, during which he was drafted in the seventh round of the 1996 NHL Entry Draft by the Tampa Bay Lightning.

Later in 1996, Kubina moved to Canada to join the Moose Jaw Warriors of the Western Hockey League (WHL), with which he scored 44 points in 61 games during the 1996–97 season. He made his NHL debut in the 1997–98 season, although he spent most of the year playing for the Adirondack Red Wings of the American Hockey League (AHL).

Kubina spent most of the next season in the NHL, scoring 21 points, while playing occasionally in the International Hockey League (IHL) for the Cleveland Lumberjacks. By the 1999–2000 season, Kubina had cemented his position in the Lightning&#x27;s lineup, scoring 26 points during the season.

Kubina scored 30 and 34 points in the 2000–01 and 2001–02 seasons respectively. In the 2003–04 season, he was named to the NHL All-Star Game and won the Stanley Cup with Tampa Bay over the Calgary Flames in the Finals.

On July 1, 2006, Kubina signed a four-year, $20 million contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs. He was suspended by the NHL for the first game of the 2006–07 season for cross-checking the Detroit Red Wings&#x27; Jiří Hudler in a pre-season game.

On July 1, 2009, Kubina was traded to the Atlanta Thrashers (along with Tim Stapleton) in exchange for Garnet Exelby and Colin Stuart.

On July 2, 2010, Kubina returned to the Tampa Bay Lightning, signing a two-year contract valued at $7.7 million worth approximately $3.85 million annually. On March 9, 2011, Kubina was suspended three games for an elbow on Chicago Blackhawks forward Dave Bolland, which resulted in a concussion for the latter.

On February 18, 2012, Kubina was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for Jon Kalinski, a second-round pick in either the 2012 or 2013 NHL Entry Draft and a fourth-round pick in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. He finished the 2011–12 season with 4 points in 17 games with the Flyers.

On September 15, 2012, Kubina left the NHL to join Genève-Servette HC of the Swiss National Liga A.

On December 20, 2013, Kubina announced his retirement from hockey.

==Personal life==
He and his wife, Andrea, welcomed their first child, a girl, Tereza on November 9, 2006, in the Czech Republic.

<text>Jorge Rafael Posada Villeta (born August 17, 1970) is a Puerto Rican former professional baseball catcher who played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees. Posada recorded a .273 batting average, 275 home runs, and 1,065 runs batted in (RBIs) during his career. A switch hitter, Posada was a five-time All-Star, won five Silver Slugger Awards, and was on the roster for four World Series championship teams.

Drafted by the Yankees in 1990, Posada was originally an infielder before moving to catcher during his minor league career. He debuted in the major leagues in 1995, but it was not until 1998 that he found regular playing time. A solid-hitting catcher, Posada established himself as a mainstay in the Yankees lineup and as one of the &quot;Core Four&quot; players who contributed to the Yankees&#x27; winning seasons. In 2003, he finished third in voting for the American League (AL) Most Valuable Player Award and became only the second Yankees catcher after Yogi Berra to hit 30 home runs in a season. Posada added one of his best seasons in 2007 at age 37 when he batted .338. Following a stint as designated hitter in 2011, he retired.

Posada is only the fifth MLB catcher with at least 1,500 hits, 350 doubles, 275 home runs, and 1,000 RBIs in a career. From 2000 to 2011, he compiled more RBIs and home runs than any other catcher in baseball. He is the only MLB catcher to ever bat .330 or better with 40 doubles, 20 home runs, and 90 RBIs in a single season. Away from baseball, Posada is the founder of the Jorge Posada Foundation, which is involved with research for craniosynostosis, a birth defect that impacts his son.

==Early life and education==
Jorge Posada was born on August 17, 1970, in the Santurce district of San Juan, Puerto Rico to a Cuban father and a Dominican mother. He attended Alejandrino High School in San Juan, where he participated in several sports, including baseball. He was named to the all-star team in 1988–89 as a shortstop. He also umpired for the girls&#x27; softball team.

Posada&#x27;s SAT scores were not high enough for him to enroll in a four-year college. Fred Frickie, the head coach of the college baseball team at Calhoun Community College in Decatur, Alabama, recruited Posada without scouting him in 1991. Posada accepted the scholarship at Calhoun without visiting the school. He made friends on the team quickly. Posada has also spoken about the racism he encountered from classmates at the school. He was voted best hitter (1990), co-captain (1991), and selected all-conference (1991). He was inducted in the Alabama Community College Athletic Hall of Fame in 2006 and Calhoun retired his number (#6).

==Professional career==

===Draft and minor leagues (1990–1996)===
Posada was drafted by the Yankees in the 24th round of the 1990 Major League Baseball draft as an infielder. Yankees scout Leon Wurth followed Posada as he played for Calhoun, and rated his bat and attitude highly. Posada signed with the Yankees for a signing bonus close to $30,000. The team agreed to keep him in their system for three years. Posada played second base in his first season with the Oneonta Yankees in the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League, in which he had a .235 batting average and four home runs in 71 games played. As the Yankees felt that Posada lacked the speed to remain an infielder, they began to transition Posada into a catcher in 1992. Though Posada initially resisted the position change, as he didn&#x27;t feel able to catch full-time, he agreed. That year, he played for the Greensboro Hornets of the Class A South Atlantic League. He finished the season with a .277 batting average, 38 extra-base hits, including 12 home runs and 58 runs batted in (RBIs). He caught Andy Pettitte for the first time while they were teammates at Greensboro.

A full-time catcher in 1993, Posada started the season with the Prince William Cannons of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League. After he hit 17 home runs and recorded 61 RBIs in 118 games for the Cannons, he was promoted to the Albany-Colonie Yankees of the Class AA Eastern League. He earned Carolina League mid-season and post-season All-Star honors. Still working on his defense, Posada committed 38 passed balls in the 1993 season, the most in the Carolina League.

The Yankees promoted Posada to the Columbus Clippers of the Class AAA International League in 1994. He batted .240 with 11 home runs on the year. His left leg was broken and ankle was dislocated in a home plate collision, prematurely ending his season. After recovering from the injury, Posada played for the Clippers for the majority of the 1995 season, batting .255 with eight home runs and 51 RBIs. The Yankees included Posada in trade discussions with the Seattle Mariners in their attempts to acquire Tino Martinez. Three weeks later, the Yankees attempted to trade Posada and Mariano Rivera to the Cincinnati Reds for David Wells, but that trade was not accepted. Returning to Columbus in 1996, Posada batted .271. He appeared in the 1996 Triple-A All-Star Game.

===New York Yankees (1995–2011)===
====1995–1999====
Posada made his MLB debut with the Yankees in 1995, replacing Jim Leyritz in the ninth inning of a game on September 4, 1995. Despite his appearing in only one game during the regular season, the Yankees included Posada on their postseason roster, and he appeared in Game 2 of the 1995 American League Division Series (ALDS) as a pinch runner, scoring a run. The Yankees lost the division series in five games to the Seattle Mariners.

Posada began the 1996 season with Columbus, but was promoted to the Yankees late in the season. He appeared in eight games, making his first start on September 25, 1996. Posada appeared in eight games in 1996, recording one hit and one walk. Posada did not appear in the postseason but the Yankees still succeeded as they defeated the Atlanta Braves in the 1996 World Series. Despite not being on the 1996 World Series or any Postseason rosters for the Yankees, Posada still received a 1996 World Series Championship ring from the Yankees.

Posada succeeded Leyritz in 1997 as the backup catcher to Joe Girardi, with Girardi serving as a mentor to Posada. Posada was expected to appear in approximately 40 games in 1997; he started in 52. Posada appeared in 60 games during the 1997 season and batted .250 with six home runs and 25 RBIs. The Yankees made the postseason again, but the team lost in the 1997 ALDS to the Cleveland Indians. After the 1997 season, the Yankees offered Posada and Mike Lowell to the Montreal Expos for Pedro Martínez; the Expos traded Martínez to the Boston Red Sox, instead.

During the offseason, Posada hired a personal trainer and running coach, who helped improve his physical conditioning. Going into the 1998 season, Posada pushed the Yankees to increase his playing time. Posada caught David Wells&#x27; perfect game on May 17, 1998. Overall, Posada batted .268 with 17 home runs and 63 RBIs over 111 games in the 1998 season. The Yankees reached the postseason for the fourth consecutive year and the team won the 1998 World Series in four games against the San Diego Padres.

The Yankees renewed Posada&#x27;s contract for $350,000 for the 1999 season, less than the $650,000 he requested. Posada struggled in April, batting .146 and striking out 15 times in 46 appearances. After batting .210 at the All-Star Break, he batted .285 for the remainder of the season, ending the year with a .245 batting average, 12 home runs, and 57 RBIs. He also committed 17 passed balls. Posada played in 112 games with 379 at-bats, while Girardi played in 65 games with 209 at-bats. While Girardi began the 1999 postseason as the regular catcher, Posada saw increased playing time. The Yankees entered the postseason once again and won the 1999 World Series against the Braves in only four games.

====2000–2006====
Girardi left the Yankees as a free agent after the 1999 season, and the Yankees entrusted Posada with the everyday catching job. Yankees&#x27; manager Joe Torre selected Posada for his first All-Star Game appearance that season. During the 2000 season, Posada batted .287 with 28 homers, 86 RBIs, 107 walks, and 151 strikeouts. The Yankees reached the postseason once again, and they won the 2000 World Series against the New York Mets. Posada won the Silver Slugger Award for catcher in 2000.

Posada appeared in the 2001 MLB All-Star Game. For the season, Posada batted .277 with 22 home runs and 95 RBIs, but led the league in passed balls and errors among catchers. The Yankees entered the postseason for another shot to win a championship, but lost to the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 2001 World Series in seven games. Posada won his second consecutive Silver Slugger Award in 2001. Posada started the 2002 MLB All-Star Game. He batted .268 with 20 home runs and 99 RBIs, and grounded into an AL-leading 23 double plays. He again led all catchers in errors. The Yankees entered the postseason again but lost in the 2002 ALDS to the Anaheim Angels. Posada won a Silver Slugger Award for a third consecutive season. Posada again started at catcher in the 2003 All-Star Game. For the season, he hit 30 home runs and drove in 101 runs, both career highs. He batted .281 and was also fifth in the league in OBP (.405), and sixth in the league in walks (93; walking 17.5% of the time, a career high). He tied Yogi Berra&#x27;s record for most home runs by a Yankee catcher. The Yankees again reached the postseason but lost to the Florida Marlins in the 2003 World Series. After the season, Posada won his fourth consecutive Silver Slugger Award. He finished third in the MVP voting, behind Alex Rodriguez and Carlos Delgado.
In 2004, Posada grounded into 24 double plays, which tied for the most in the AL, but batted .272 with 21 home runs and 81 RBIs. After defeating the Minnesota Twins in the 2004 ALDS, the Yankees lost to the Boston Red Sox in the 2004 ALCS despite leading the series three games to none. In 2005, Posada batted .262 with 19 home runs and 71 RBIs. The Yankees reached the postseason again, but lost to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the 2005 ALDS.

In 2006, Posada posted his highest batting average and home run total since 2003. He also led the major leagues with 20 pinch hits. In addition, work with new first base coach Tony Peña, a former catcher, helped him improve his percentage of runners thrown out stealing second almost 60 points above his career average. However, he again led the league in passed balls. He batted .277 and had 23 home runs with 93 RBIs. On May 16, Posada led the Yankees to a victory despite falling behind by nine runs, matching the largest deficit the Yankees overcame for a victory in franchise history. He registered a +0.93 win probability added in that game, the highest of his career.

====2007–2010====

Posada batted .338, with 20 home runs, 90 RBIs, and career highs in hits (171) and doubles (42) during the 2007 season. He joined Iván Rodríguez as the only two catchers in MLB history to record at least 40 doubles in two separate seasons. He finished the season third in the AL in on-base percentage (.426), fourth in batting average, sixth in on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS) (.970), and eighth in doubles and slugging percentage (.543). He finished sixth in MVP voting for the season, and won his fifth Silver Slugger Award. Posada and Jason Kendall were the only catchers to catch at least 120 games per season from 2000 through 2007. Posada became a free agent after the 2007 season. He signed a four-year, $52 million contract to remain with the Yankees. Posada was represented in negotiations by Sam and Seth Levinson of ACES Inc.

On July 21, 2008, Posada was placed on the disabled list (DL), the first time he was placed on the DL in his career. Posada intended to recover from this injury in order to perform as designated hitter or first baseman. However, the team decided to acquire Xavier Nady in order to allow him enough time to operate. Posada underwent surgery to repair a glenoid labrum in his right shoulder and was placed on the DL for the remainder of the 2008 season. He batted .268 with three home runs and 22 RBIs in 51 games prior to the injury. During his absence, the Yankees finished with an 89–73 record, third place in AL East behind the wild-card winning Boston Red Sox. It was the first and only season the Yankees were eliminated from postseason contention during Posada&#x27;s career.
Posada hit the first regular-season home run in the new Yankee Stadium on April 16, 2009, against Cliff Lee of the Cleveland Indians. During a game against the Toronto Blue Jays on September 15, 2009, Posada took exception to a pitch that was thrown behind him by Jesse Carlson. Posada walked and later scored on an RBI single by Brett Gardner. After Posada crossed home plate, he bumped into Carlson and was then ejected after taunting Carlson. Posada then charged at Carlson, igniting a bench-clearing brawl. Posada and Carlson were each suspended for three games for their roles in the brawl. Posada finished the 2009 season with a .285 batting average, 22 home runs, and 81 RBIs. During the 2009 postseason, Posada had a .276 batting average and two home runs. The Yankees won the 2009 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies.

In an interleague series against the Houston Astros in June 2010, Posada became the first Yankee since Bill Dickey in 1937 to hit a grand slam in back-to-back games. On July 23, 2010, Posada recorded his 1,000th career RBI against the Kansas City Royals. Posada finished the 2010 year batting .248 with 18 home runs and 57 RBIs. The Yankees went into the postseason again but lost to the Texas Rangers in the 2010 ALCS.

====2011====
Following the 2010 season, Posada underwent arthroscopic surgery in his left knee to repair a torn meniscus. Posada was shifted to designated hitter for the 2011 season due to his declining defensive performance, while Russell Martin became the new everyday catcher. After starting the 2011 season in a slump, Posada was moved to ninth in the batting order for a May 14 game against the Boston Red Sox. Posada asked to be removed from the lineup. Posada told reporters that he needed time to &quot;clear [his] head&quot; and also mentioned some &quot;stiffness&quot; in his back as the reasons for his request.
Posada hit .382 in June, but was removed from the everyday lineup in August due to his .230 season batting average. On August 13, 2011, his first start since being benched, in a game against the Tampa Bay Rays, Posada went 3-for-5 with a grand slam and six RBIs. His grand slam was the tenth of his career, moving him past Yogi Berra and Mickey Mantle for sixth place on the Yankees&#x27; all-time list. On August 25, 2011, he played second base for the first time in his major league career during the ninth inning of the Yankees&#x27; 22–9 victory over the Oakland Athletics; Posada recorded the final out by fielding a grounder. On September 10, 2011, Posada played as a catcher for the first time of the season due to injuries of Russell Martin and Francisco Cervelli. Posada finished the regular season with a .235 batting average, 14 home runs, and 44 RBIs.

In the 2011 ALDS, Posada recorded six hits, including a triple, four runs, and four walks in 14 at-bats as the starting DH, for a .429 batting average and a .579 on-base percentage. The Yankees lost the series to the Detroit Tigers in five games.

====Retirement====
When asked by reporters after the 2011 ALDS if he had considered that he might have played for the final time with the Yankees, Posada said, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to look at it like that. We lost, and we&#x27;ll see what happens in the off-season.&quot; As the interview session went on, he eventually became emotional and left the clubhouse area to compose himself. Girardi said, &quot;This guy, when you look at what he did in this series, he was awesome. He&#x27;s had a tremendous career, and I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s going to continue to play, and I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going to happen.&quot; Girardi added, &quot;But you talk about being proud of players—what he went through this year and what he gave us in the postseason, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a prouder moment that I&#x27;ve had of Jorge.&quot;

By November 2011, Posada received interest from &quot;five or six teams&quot;, but not the Yankees. He remained undecided on whether or not he wanted to keep playing. In January 2012, Posada decided to retire. The Yankees held a press conference officially announcing his retirement from baseball on January 24, 2012. He rejoined the Yankees as a guest instructor during spring training in 2013.

The Yankees retired Posada&#x27;s jersey number 20 on August 22, 2015.

Posada became eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2017, but he received only 3.8% of the vote and was dropped off the ballot.

==Personal life==
Posada&#x27;s mother is Dominican and his father, Jorge Posada Sr., is Cuban, but fled to Puerto Rico to escape Fidel Castro&#x27;s regime. Posada Sr. worked as a scout for the Colorado Rockies. 

Major League pitcher Bruce Brubaker married Posada&#x27;s mother&#x27;s sister, Leda, making him Posada&#x27;s uncle. Leo Posada, who played for the Kansas City Athletics in the early 1960s, is commonly believed to have been Jorge Posada&#x27;s uncle. They did enjoy a close relationship and worked together on Jorge&#x27;s game over the years. However, they were at most distant kin (Leo had just one sister; Jorge Sr. was not his brother).

Posada met Laura (née Mendez) at a party in 1997, soon recognizing her as the pitcher of the softball team in games he umpired. They were married on January 21, 2000. Laura, a former model and actress, works as an attorney. They have two children, Jorge Luis and Paulina. Derek Jeter served as best man at the wedding.

Posada&#x27;s son, Jorge Luis, suffers from craniosynostosis, which he was diagnosed with 10 days after he was born. Posada established the Jorge Posada Foundation, which helps fund research and offers family support. Jorge released a charity wine in 2008 called Jorge Cabernet to raise funds for his foundation. In June 2011, his son underwent what Posada hoped would be the final surgery for the condition.

Posada wrote a children&#x27;s book entitled &quot;Play Ball!&quot; that was published in 2006. He and his wife co-wrote &quot;Fit Home Team&quot;, a family health manual, and an autobiography titled &quot;The Beauty of Love: A Memoir of Miracles, Hope, and Healing&quot;, which describes their personal ordeals and how they dealt with them after learning of their son&#x27;s birth condition in 1999.

After Hurricane Maria had devastated Puerto Rico in September 2017, Posada launched a relief fundraiser. St. Louis Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina and wife, Wanda, also started a GoFundMe campaign for victims of the hurricane on September 21, 2017. By December, the fund had raised over $500,000.

Posada is a dedicated Catholic.

<text>The first USS &quot;Accentor&quot; (AMc-36) was the lead boat of the of coastal minesweepers in the service of the United States Navy, named after the accentor bird.

She was laid down on 21 January 1941 by W. A. Robinson, launched on 10 May 1941 and commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on 24 July 1941.

==Pre World War II==
Following outfitting there and shakedown training in nearby waters and off the Virginia capes, the coastal minesweeper arrived at Portland, Maine on 26 September and reported to the commanding officer of Mine Division 26 for duty in the inshore patrol. For almost one year — but for a month of availability at the Boston Navy Yard from 18 March to 17 April 1942 — she performed her duties of streaming and sweeping for mines. During this time, the United States entered World War II on 7 December 1941.

==World War II==
In mid-August 1942, orders arrived directing &quot;Accentor&quot; to proceed via Boston to Annapolis, Maryland for minesweeping tests in the Chesapeake Bay. She departed Portland on 22 August and reached the United States Naval Academy six days later. She was decommissioned there on 1 September and simultaneously placed in service. She spent the remainder of her naval career operating in the Chesapeake Bay region, for the most part under the auspices of the Naval Mine Warfare Proving Ground at Solomons Island, Maryland.

==Post World War II==
After World War II ended and most postwar minesweeping tasks had been completed, &quot;Accentor&quot; was placed out of service on 14 June 1946 and, a week later, declared surplus to the Navy needs. Struck from the Navy list on 3 July 1946, she was transferred early in October 1946 to the Maritime Commission for disposal and sold to Higgins, Inc., of New Orleans, Louisiana. She was delivered to that company at Lake Charles, Louisiana on 9 October 1946.

<text>Kuini Liliha (–1839) was a High Chiefess (aliʻi) and noblewoman who served the Kingdom of Hawaii as royal governor of Oʻahu island. She administered the island from 1829 to 1831 following the death of her husband Boki.

== Early life ==
She was born in 1802. Her father was Ulumāheihei Hoapili, a son of Kameʻeiamoku, one of the &quot;nīʻaupiʻo&quot; (highest noble rank) twin brothers. Her mother was High Chiefess Kalilikauoha of Maui, who was the daughter of King Kahekili II of Maui and his half-sister bride Luahiwa.
Some genealogists say Liliha was only adopted by Hoapili, but the practice known as &quot;hānai&quot; was considered a bond as strong as a blood relation. According to them, she was the biological daughter of Koakanu, a son or grandson of Kaolohaka-a-Keawe, one of the many issues of Keaweʻīkekahialiʻiokamoku; and his wife High Chiefess Loeau. Her name means &quot;heartsick queen&quot; in the Hawaiian language.
She had no siblings. 

Liliha was initially married to Kahalaiʻa Luanuʻu, a nephew of Kamehameha I. However, his uncle Boki, an advisor and friend to King Kamehameha II, took her from Kahalaiʻa as his wife after his previous wife Likelike was taken by his older brother Kalanimoku.

== United Kingdom ==

Boki, Liliha, and Mataio Kekūanaōʻa were principal members of the entourage that accompanied King Kamehameha II and Queen Kamāmalu on an 1824 diplomatic tour of the United Kingdom, visiting King George IV. The entire delegation contracted the measles, since native Hawaiians had no immunity to the disease. As a result, Queen Kamāmalu and several chiefs died, including Kamehameha II who was so distraught after his Queen&#x27;s death that he died in Liliha&#x27;s arms.

Boki and Liliha survived the measles and Boki took charge of what was left of the delegation. They managed to secure agreements of friendship from the British government. The Kingdom of Hawaii also became a protectorate of the British military under those agreements. Boki and Liliha returned to Oʻahu with the bodies of Kamehameha II and Kamāmalu in 1825 on the British warship . On the return journey, Liliha, Kekūanaōʻa and Manuia were baptized by the &quot;Blonde&quot;&#x27;s chaplain Richard Rowland Bloxam.

== Catholicism ==
Liliha became embroiled in the dispute over freedom of religion in the kingdom. Kaʻahumanu was a widow of Kamehameha I, and held great power as Kuhina Nui or chief advisor during the reigns of both Kamehameha II and Kauikeaouli (Kamehameha III). She had been influenced by the Protestant missionaries in Honolulu and was baptized into the Congregational church. Heeding the advice of her Congregationalist ministers, Kaʻahumanu convinced King Kamehameha III to ban the Roman Catholic Church from the islands.

The priests and lay brothers of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary were forcibly deported from the kingdom. Native Hawaiians who had converted were persecuted. Some were beaten and imprisoned. When Kaʻahumanu discovered that Boki and Liliha were among the first chiefs to convert to the suppressed Hawaii Church it angered the queen regent, who wanted all the chiefs to accept Protestantism in order that all Hawaiians would follow. Kuini Liliha&#x27;s steadfastness in her Catholicism influenced Native Hawaiian Catholics to persevere even in suppression.
Only after the intervention of the French government and Captain Cyrille-Pierre-Théodore Laplace and Kamehameha III&#x27;s proclamation of the Edict of Toleration did Hawaiians like Kuini Liliha have the legal right of membership in the Hawaii Catholic Church.

== Royal governor ==
As royal governor, Boki incurred large debts from the foreigners and attempted to cover them by traveling to the New Hebrides to harvest sandalwood. Before departing in 1829, Boki entrusted administration of Oʻahu to his wife. One of her new responsibilities was to become legal guardian and sole trustee of the properties of Kamehameha III, who had become king as a child. This was opposed by Kaʻahumanu who was ruling Hawaii as queen regent and had developed a rivalry with Liliha. About this time, Kaʻahumanu forced Liliha to give up some of her land in an area known as Punahou to missionary Hiram Bingham I. This eventually became the site of Punahou School, also known as Oʻahu College, for the children of the missionaries.

Boki and his entourage were lost at sea and pronounced dead, leaving Liliha in administration as royal governor. On April 1, 1831, Kaʻahumanu heard rumors of a planned rebellion, so sent Hoapili to remove Liliha of her power, replacing her with Kaʻahumanu&#x27;s own brother, John Adams Kuakini as governor of Oʻahu.
In November 1833 (after Kaʻahumanu&#x27;s death and Kamehameha III came to age) some chiefs planned to back her as Kuhina Nui, a position similar to prime minister or as powerful as co-regent. Instead, Hoapili put his support behind Elizabeth Kīnaʻu, who also acted as governor of Oʻahu with Kuakini returning to the island of Hawaiʻi.

== Legacy ==

Liliha had numerous other husbands and partners. In fact, she was probably the most married chiefess during her lifetime; she had a document seven partners or husbands.
Besides Kahalaiʻa Luanuʻu and Boki, she married Kalaniulumoku and Namaile by whom she had daughters, Jane Loeau (1828–1873), and Abigail Maheha (1832–1861), respectively. King Kamehameha III declared both eligible for the Hawaiian throne, and they were sent to the Chiefs&#x27; Children&#x27;s School later known as the Royal School in Honolulu.
With Kulinui she had a son, Aberahama Kaikioewa Palekaluhi (1830–1912). With Namaile or Kamaile, she had a son, John F. or Pius F. Koakanu (died 1885) and two daughters, Maheha (mentioned above) and Kailinoa. With Haalou she had another daughter Mary Ann Kiliwehi (1840–1873).

She died on August 24, 1839, in Honolulu and was buried on the sacred island of Mokuʻula on Maui.
Later she was reburied in the Waineʻe cemetery. Although treated as a rebel by Kaʻahumanu, she was generally loved by the people. For example, a traditional hula chant honors her memory.
A street is named for her in Honolulu.

<text>[[Andrej Hlinka|Hlinka]]&#x27;s Slovak People&#x27;s Party (), also known as the Slovak People&#x27;s Party (, SĽS) or the Hlinka Party, was a far-right clerico-fascist political party with a strong Catholic fundamentalist and authoritarian ideology. Its members were often called (Ľudáks, singular: ).

The party arose at a time when Slovakia was still part of Austria-Hungary and fought for democratic liberties, the independence and sovereignty of Slovakia, and against the influence of liberalism. After the formation of Czechoslovakia, the party preserved its conservative ideology, opposing Czechoslovakism and demanding Slovak autonomy. In the second half of the 1930s, the rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe and the party&#x27;s inability to achieve long-term political objectives caused a loss of the party&#x27;s faith in democratic procedures and saw the party turn towards more radical and extremist ideologies such as fascism.

After a merger with other parties in November 1938, which formed the Hlinka&#x27;s Slovak People&#x27;s Party – Party of Slovak National Unity, it became the dominant party of the Slovak Republic. In addition to adopting a totalitarian vision of the state, it included an openly pro-Nazi faction, which dominated Slovak policy between 1940 and 1942. The party&#x27;s chairmen were the Slovak priests Andrej Hlinka (1913–1938) and later Jozef Tiso (1939–1945), and its main newspapers were the (Slovak People&#x27;s News, 1910–1930), (Slovak, 1919–1945) and (Slovak Truth, 1936–1945).

==History==

===Austria-Hungary (1905–1918) ===
The creation process of the party took several years. With the exception of the short-lived Slovak Social Democratic Party (1905–1906), there was only one party in Austria-Hungary that specifically promoted the interests of the Slovaks at the turn of the 19th and 20th century — the Slovak National Party (SNS). The Slovak People&#x27;s movement was established within the Hungarian People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Néppárt&quot;, founded in 1895) which opposed liberalism and was popular amongst the religious Slovak population. The party&#x27;s program addressed several other problems of Slovak society including emigration, usury, corruption and forced magyarization. Due to the gradual shift away from these values, Slovak politicians began to form a separate group within the party. The party hierarchy reacted in November 1905 by asking its only MP, František Skyčák, to sign a testimony against the Slovak program. Skyčák refused and on 5 December 1905, he published a declaration of a new political party.

Other personalities, among them the Catholic priest Andrej Hlinka, joined the organisation in early 1906, before the Slovak National Party (SĽS) was officially formed on 18 March 1906 by Skyčák, Milan Hodža and A. Ráth. However, following a decision in April 1906, the party contested elections as part of the Slovak National Party until 1913 in order to prevent splitting the Slovak vote. However, their programmes were nearly identical; the SĽS called for strong democratization and included liberal reforms such as freedom of speech and universal suffrage. Despite the frequent electoral manipulations in Hungary at that time, the SĽS won six deputies and the SNS won one deputy. out of the 415 deputies of the Hungarian Diet in the 1906 parliamentary elections. The Hungarian government immediately reacted by implementing increasingly repressive measures to suppress the national and political consciousness and awareness of Slovaks.

In 1912, the SĽS refused to support the strong Czechoslovakist orientation of the SNS prevailing at that time, and made a similar declaration as in 1905, again without formal effects. On 19 July 1913, the SĽS became a separate political party with Hlinka as chairman and Ferdiš Juriga and Skyčák amongst its leadership. During World War I, the SĽS (just like the SNS) went into abeyance in order to prevent any possible pretext for accusations of activities against the Austro-Hungarian state. In 1918, Hlinka and Juriga staunchly supported the idea of a common Czechoslovak state and signed the Martin Declaration which rejected Hungarian jurisdiction and rule over Slovakia. The party participated in the creation of the Second Slovak National Council that existed from October 1918 to January 1919 and its leaders helped to consolidate the situation in Czechoslovakia during the first weeks of its existence.

===First Czechoslovak Republic (1918–1938)===
After the establishment of Czechoslovakia, the SĽS renewed its activities on 19 December 1918 in Žilina. On 17 October 1925, it was renamed the Hlinka&#x27;s Slovak People&#x27;s Party (HSĽS) to distinguish it from the Czechoslovak People&#x27;s Party. During the majority of the whole interwar period, the HSĽS was the most popular party in Slovakia and until 1938, was a standard part of the democratic political spectrum. The party operated mostly in opposition but not as a destructive power and remained loyal to Czechoslovakia. All of its programs had religious, national, social and constitutional values, its ideology was based on papal encyclicals Rerum novarum and Quadragesimo anno, and was oriented mostly towards its Catholic electorate. The party rejected economic liberalism and the theory of class struggle popular among socialists and communists, who were together with liberal atheists considered to be the party&#x27;s main enemies. The constitutional part of its program was derived from the Pittsburgh Agreement, which promised an autonomous status of Slovakia within Czechoslovakia. The HSĽS opposed centralism and ethnic Czechoslovakism, which did not consider Slovaks as a separate and distinctive ethnic group from the Czechs. In addition to its program, the popularity of the party was maintained by Hlinka&#x27;s charisma and cult of personality.

In the 1920 parliamentary elections the party participated together with the Czech People&#x27;s Party under the name &quot;Czechoslovak People&#x27;s Party&quot;. The alliance received 17.5% of the vote in Slovakia, making it the third largest party. Following the elections, Hlinka stated that he would &quot;work 24 hours a day until Slovakia turns from a red Slovakia into a white and Christian Slovakia.&quot; The majority of the party&#x27;s support came from Slovak farmers, mainly because the party criticized the land reforms of 1920–1929.

After the county elections in 1923, the party became the largest party in Slovakia, receiving 34.4% of the vote in the 1925 parliamentary elections. In 1923, the HSĽS founded the paramilitary Rodobrana organization to protect their meetings. Rodobrana was influenced and manipulated by Vojtech Tuka for his own anti-Czechoslovak intentions, and later it was banned by the Czechoslovak government for anti-constitutional activities. Rodobrana was inspired by Italian fascism, and became a magnet for young dissatisfied radicals, the core of the future fascist wing of the HSĽS. The HSĽS leadership attempted to bring Rodobrana under party control, and succeeded when its activities were restored in 1926. Rodobrana hosted several radicals like Alexander Mach and Ján Farkaš.

On 15 January 1927, the HSĽS became a member of the Czechoslovak government coalition after Jozef Tiso started negotiations during a foreign trip by Hlinka. The party held the Ministry of Health (Jozef Tiso) and the Ministry of the Unification of Laws and State Administration (Marek Gažík). After a controversial trial against the HSĽS member Vojtech Tuka, who was accused of high treason, the HSĽS left the government on 8 October 1929.
In order to contest the 1935 elections, the HSĽS joined with the SNS to create the &quot;Autonomous Block&quot;, which received 30.12% of the vote in the Slovak region of Czechoslovakia. However, it was dissolved after the elections. The HSĽS considered itself to be the only political party that vigorously defended Slovak national interests, but its inability to achieve autonomy decreased the prestige of its moderate wing and strengthened its radical members.

After the death of the 74-year old Hlinka in August 1938, the presidium of the party decided that the post of chairman would remain unoccupied. The party was subsequently led by vice-chairman Jozef Tiso until October 1939, when he became the new chairman. During the Czechoslovak crisis between the spring and fall of 1938, the HSĽS retained a common Czechoslovak platform. The party officially supported the national mobilization of Czechoslovakia against Nazi Germany and rejected the appeals of the Sudeten German Party to radicalize its position.

===Second Czechoslovak Republic (1938–1939)===
The situation dramatically changed in the fall of 1938. On October 6, 1938, after the Czech region of Czechoslovakia had lost its border regions to Germany following the Munich Agreement, the executive committee of the HSĽS together with most other Slovak parties declared the autonomy of Slovakia within Czechoslovakia. The Prague government accepted this declaration, and appointed Jozef Tiso as the Prime Minister of Autonomous Slovakia on the same day. The HSĽS became the dominant party in the subsequent Slovak governments. After the declaration of autonomy, internal tension between the Catholic conservative and radical fascist wings continued to grow. The conservative wing led by Tiso preserved its majority in the presidium of the party, but the radicals in turn gained influence and held important positions in new organizations like the Hlinka Guard (&quot;Hlinkova Garda&quot;) and the Slovak National Committees (&quot;Slovenské Národné Výbory&quot;).

On November 8, 1938, after the Slovak part of Czechoslovakia had lost one third of its territory to Hungary through the First Vienna Award (Vienna Arbitration), the Slovak branches of all parties except the Communists and Social Democrats merged with the HSĽS and formed the Hlinka&#x27;s Slovak People&#x27;s Party – Party of Slovak National Unity (HSĽS-SSNJ). The Slovak National Party joined the HSĽS-SSNJ coalition on December 15, 1938.

This new party quickly developed clearly authoritarian characteristics. It immediately subjected the leftist and Jewish parties to considerable harassment. In the December 1938 Slovak general election, the HSĽS-SSNJ coalition won 97.3% of the vote, out of which 72% went to candidates of the original HSĽS. The Social Democrats and Communists were shut out because the HSĽS-SSNJ government refused to publish new election procedures until it was too late for these parties to select their candidates. As of January 31, 1939, all parties except for the HSĽS-SSNJ, the German Party and the Unified Magyar Party (Representing the Hungarian minority) were prohibited. For all intents and purposes, Slovakia was now effectively a one-party state.

===First Slovak Republic (1939–1945)===

In a last-ditch attempt to save the country, the Prague government deposed Tiso as Slovak premier, replacing him with Karel Sidor. A few days later, amid massive German provocations, Hitler invited Tiso to Berlin and urged him to proclaim Slovakia&#x27;s independence. Hitler added that if Tiso did not do so, he would have no interest in Slovakia&#x27;s fate. During the meeting, Joachim von Ribbentrop passed on a bogus report stating that Hungarian troops were approaching Slovak borders. Tiso refused to make such a decision himself on the situation. After that, he was allowed by Hitler to organize a meeting of the Slovak parliament which would approve Slovakia&#x27;s declaration of independence from Czechoslovakia.

On 14 March, the Slovak parliament convened and heard Tiso&#x27;s report on his discussion with Hitler as well as a declaration of independence. Some of the deputies were skeptical of making such a move, but the debate was quickly quashed when Franz Karmasin, leader of the German minority in Slovakia, stated that any delay in declaring independence would result in Slovakia being partitioned between Hungary and Germany. Under these circumstances, the legislative chamber unanimously declared Slovak independence. Jozef Tiso was appointed the first Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic. The next day, Tiso sent a telegram, which had actually been composed the previous day in Berlin, asking the Reich to take over the protection of the newly created state. The request was readily accepted.

The HSĽS-SSNJ was the dominant force in the country, to the point that the parliamentary elections scheduled for 1943 did not take place, and it claimed to represent the nation and the social interests of all Slovak citizens. Historians describe the party as a &quot;fascist and clerical nationalist group with ties to Nazism&quot;. After 1939, the conflict between two wings of the party continued and reached a new level of severity. The conservative wing led by the Catholic priest Jozef Tiso, the president of Slovakia and chairman of the party, wanted to create a separate authoritarian and religious state modelled on fundamentalist Christian principles. The conservative wing had no doubts about the need to build a totalitarian state, but wished to do so gradually, preserving legal and political continuity with the previous regime. The radicals, who preferred the methods and theory of Nazism, were fervent antisemites, wanted to remove all Czechs and Hungarians from the country, and intended to create a radically nationalistic and corporatist state modelled on Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Nazi Germany. Their main organization was the Hlinka Guard, which was controlled by the HSĽS-SSNJ. The main representatives of the radical pro-Nazi faction were Vojtech Tuka and Alexander Mach.

In the spring of 1940, the conservative wing was close to victory over the radicals, especially when Tiso pacified the Hlinka Guard through organizational changes and bound it closer to the party&#x27;s leadership. However, at the July 1940 Salzburg Conference, the Government of Germany forced changes of personnel in the Slovak government and thus reinforced the radicals. The radical wing then held the most important positions of executive power. The new Prime Minister, Vojtech Tuka, also became the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Alexander Mach then once again became the leader of the Hlinka Guard and also the Minister of the Interior. Tiso changed his tactics and verbally adopted the idea of Nazism, but maneuvered and stated that it had to be implemented in &quot;folk and Christian spirit&quot;.

In the fall of 1940, the conservative wing began taking the initiative. Tiso undermined the already weak authority of the Slovak Parliament, and strongly rejected a proposal to replace four conservative ministers with radical Nazis. In early 1941, his faction silently thwarted a pro-Nazi coup attempt. On the other hand, Tiso allowed the radicals to take the initiative on the solution of the &quot;Jewish Question&quot;, wrongly assuming that he can redirect all responsibility for the Holocaust to them, and later on he publicly advocated the deportations of Jews into concentration camps in Nazi Germany.

The struggle between the party&#x27;s wings ended in the summer 1942 with the victory of the conservatives. Some radicals withdrew from public life, others lost their political influence or switched to the winning side, such as Alexander Mach. Due to pragmatic reasons, HSLS adopted the Führerprinzip, with a completely different purpose than in Germany, which was the preventive elimination of radicals without angering the German government. Germany naturally sympathized with the pro-Nazi radicals but allowed their opponents to win regardless. The reason was purely pragmatic, as Nazi foreign policy was more interested in a consolidated Slovakia as a model of an effective satellite state, and the conservative wing was more popular amongst the Slovak population and was widely perceived as being more qualified to manage the state. Germany however never stopped supporting the radicals and frequently utilized them to pressure the Slovak puppet state.

After the German occupation of Slovakia in 1944 and the outbreak of the Slovak National Uprising, the insurgent Slovak National Council (&quot;Slovenská národná rada&quot; or the SNR) declared the restoration of Czechoslovakia. On September 1, 1944, the SNR banned the HSĽS and all of its organisations such as the Hlinka Guard and Hlinka Youth, and confiscated their property. Although the uprising was later violently suppressed, the HSĽS never fully regained its authority. The party ceased to exist after the liberation of Slovakia by Czechoslovak troops and by the Red Army in April–May 1945. Many of the party&#x27;s members and supporters were prosecuted for war crimes in post war Czechoslovakia.

<text>Emil Joseph Holub (January 5, 1938 – September 21, 2019) was an American football center and linebacker in the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Texans/Kansas City Chiefs. He played college football at Texas Technological College (now Texas Tech University).

==Early life==
Holub was born on January 5, 1938, in Schulenburg, Texas. He graduated from Lubbock High School in 1957, where his nickname was &quot;The Beast&quot;. He lettered in football and track and field, participating in the power sports of shot put and discus. He received All-district honors as a junior. A knee operation forced him to miss his senior season.

He accepted a football scholarship from Texas Technological College (Texas Tech), where he was a two-way player and still nicknamed &quot;The Beast&quot; by his teammates. He played under coach DeWitt Weaver. He stood 6 ft 4 in and weighed 215 pounds. He played both offense (center) and defense (middle linebacker). In his very first varsity game in 1958, he blocked a field attempt to win the game over Texas A&amp;M. As a senior he had 15 unassisted tackles and 8 assisted tackles against Baylor. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named him Lineman of the Week for that game. He had 18 unassisted tackles, 10 assisted tackles and returned an interception for a 40-yard touchdown against Arkansas. In the Red Raiders&#x27; game against Tulane, he had a 28-yard touchdown return on an interception.

=== Honors ===
He also became a two-time first team All-American at center in 1959 and 1960 (a consensus All-American in 1960); the first Red Raider to receive All American honors twice. After his last game, the city of Lubbock celebrated &quot;E.J. Holub Day&quot;. In 1960, he was selected to the All Southwest Conference Team (the first Texas Tech player so honored), was 10th in Heisman Trophy voting, and played in the East-West Shrine Game, where he was named outstanding lineman. He also played in the Coaches All America Game and the Chicago All-Star Game.

He was the first player in Texas Tech football history to have his jersey number (55) retired, which occurred after his senior season. In 1977, he was inducted into the Texas Tech Hall of Fame. In 1982, he was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame. In 1986, he was inducted into the National Football Foundation College Football Hall of Fame in South Bend, Indiana; the first Texas Tech player ever inducted. In 1987, he was inducted into the Texas High School Football Hall of Fame. In 2008, he was selected as a Texas Tech&#x27;s Big 12 Legend. In 2011, he was inducted into the Lubbock Independent School District Athletics Hall of Honor. In 2012, he was inducted into the inaugural class of the Texas Tech Football Ring of Honor. In 2013, he was inducted into the Southwest Conference Hall of Fame.

==Professional career==
Holub was selected by the Dallas Texans in the first round (6th overall) of the 1961 AFL Draft and by the Dallas Cowboys in the second round (16th overall) of the 1961 NFL draft. On January 17, 1961, he signed with the Texans. In September 1961, &quot;Sports Ill&quot;ustrated referred to Holub as probably the AFL&#x27;s top draftee. He principally played linebacker from 1961 to 1967, and then center from 1968 to 1970. He played as a Dallas Texan in 1961 and 1962, and then as a Kansas City Chief from 1963 to 1970 after the team moved. He was on three AFL championship teams (Dallas 1962, Kansas City 1966, 1969), including the 1962 AFL title game with the Texans winning 20–17 in double-overtime against the defending champion Houston Oilers. This is the longest professional football league championship game ever played, was watched by millions on television, and played an important part in creating the grounds for an AFL-NFL merger. 

Holub began his professional career as a two-way player, playing center on offense and linebacker on defense — a rarity during the two platoon era. Holub had begun professional play one year before Chuck Bednarik retired in 1962, who was the last full-time two-way player in the National Football League. In one game in 1962, Holub played 58 of 60 minutes, alternating on offense and defense; in another he racked up a total of 56 minutes played.

As a rookie he became a starter at left outside linebacker. In 1964, he played in only 9 games after he needed to have surgery on both of his knees. In 1965, he was moved to right outside linebacker. In 1967, he played in only 6 games after being placed on the injured reserve list on November 2, with an injury that was reported as a pulled leg muscle.

In the early years he played both at linebacker and long snapper (on extra points or field goals) until his knee injuries and a torn hamstring forced him to switch to center in 1968, replacing the recently retired Jon Gilliam. Holub was simply not able to run with the necessary speed to play linebacker after repeated surgeries. In Super Bowl IV, he became the only player to start on offense and defense in more than one Super Bowl.

Even after eleven knee surgeries (six on the left and five on the right) as a player, Holub was a leader, a &quot;holler guy&quot;, and he was a team player, enduring pain to lead his team. He would spend hours in the training room, watching blood and liquid drain from his knee, then go out to the field and perform as though he was suffering from no physical problem. Surgeries were more invasive in Holub&#x27;s time, than for later football players. Facing a tenth operation on his legs (ninth on his knees) and the possibility of never playing football again, the New York Times said in 1971 that &quot;Holub perhaps suffered more than any other athlete just to play the game.&quot; He had 20 surgeries in his lifetime, 11 during his playing days. His scarred knees have been described as belonging to &quot;the annals of athletic injury&quot;, along with the likes of Joe Namath, Willis Reed, Bobby Orr and Gale Sayers.

He was an American Football League All-Star in 1961, 1962, 1964, 1965 and 1966 as a linebacker. He was named all American Football League at outside linebacker in 1962 and 1963. He was second team All AFL in 1961, 1965-1966, and 1969 (at center). Holub was the only player to start two Super Bowls at two different positions. He started Super Bowl I at linebacker, then started Super Bowl IV at center and was a driving force in helping the Chiefs defeat the Minnesota Vikings 23–7. He is pictured snapping the ball to QB Len Dawson on the cover of the January 14, 1970 edition of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, published following the game, entitled &quot;Len Dawson Engineers Superchief Upset&quot;.

==End of career==
With his knees wearing out, the Chiefs selected his eventual successor, Jack Rudnay, in the 1969 NFL/AFL draft. Rudnay took over the starting center position during the 1970 season, with Holub playing in all 14 games as a long snapper and starting in only 6 games at center. In 1971, he injured his left knee in the first week of training camp and later announced his retirement.

==Honors==
In 1976, he was inducted into the Kansas City Chiefs Hall of Honor, as a center and linebacker.

==Personal life==
Off the football field, Holub was known for his thougtfulness, generosity, and kindness towards others. He had a lifelong interest in horses and the life of cowboys. He took his first horse, named &quot;Cowboy&quot;, with him when the Dallas Texans moved to Kansas City. He once rode Cowboy, who lived to be 30, into Mike Ditka&#x27;s Dallas sportsbar. During the football off-seasons, he managed a ranch in Oklahoma.

After retiring, Holub was a rancher, and later became an advocate for Texas Tech by working for the Red Raider Club to raise scholarship funds. He is famous at Texas Tech for his rousing halftime speech to the Red Raiders in their final 1999 game, and the final game of coach Spike Dykes, that inspired the team to victory over Oklahoma.

== Death ==
On September 21, 2019, Holub died of natural causes.

<text>Os Normais (in Portuguese, literally &quot;The Normal Ones&quot;) is a Brazilian sitcom directed by José Alvarenga Jr. and written by Jorge Furtado, Alexandre Machado, and Fernanda Young. It aired from 2001 to 2003 on Rede Globo. It features a lot of nonsensical situations, unpredictable stories and wild, often explicit humour. The sitcom was adapted in 2003 into a film titled &quot;Os Normais, O Filme&quot; (distributed as &quot;So Normal&quot; in some countries), which received the sequel &quot;Os Normais 2 - A Noite Mais Maluca de Todas&quot; in 2009.

== Plot ==
Rui (Luiz Fernando Guimarães) is engaged to Vani (Fernanda Torres). Although they spend most of their time together in the same apartment, they live in separate ones in Rio de Janeiro where strange situations take place with different guests in each episode.

In 2003, during the third and last season, the series introduced two new characters, Bernardo (Selton Mello) and Maristela (Graziella Moretto).

<text>USS &quot;Accentor&quot; (LCI(L)-652/LSIL-652/AMCU-15) was an in the service of the United States Navy, named after the accentor bird.

She was laid down as the unnamed &quot;LCI(L)-652&quot; on 10 June 1944 at Barber, New Jersey by New Jersey Shipbuilding, launched on 13 July 1944, and commissioned on 19 July 1944.

After shakedown training during the summer of 1944, the large infantry landing craft joined the Pacific Fleet. She operated in various rear areas of the Pacific Ocean through the end of World War II and, after Japan capitulated in mid-August 1945, continued similar activity into the summer of 1946. On 19 July of that year, &quot;LCI(L)-652&quot; was placed out of commission and was berthed with the Columbia River Group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. While inactive during the remainder of her Navy career, she was redesignated &quot;LSIL-652&quot; on 28 February 1949. Late in October 1950, the ship was nominated for conversion to an underwater mine locator ship. Accordingly, she was named &quot;Accentor&quot; and redesignated AMCU-15 on 7 March 1952. In May 1952, she was reassigned from the Columbia River Group to the Bremerton Group in preparation for her reconditioning.

However, &quot;Accentor&quot; never returned to active service. Her conversion was cancelled on 22 January 1954, and she remained inactive at Bremerton, Washington. On 1 July 1954, her name and new classification were also cancelled, and she reverted to &quot;LSIL-652&quot;. She was struck from the Navy list on 18 September 1956 and was sunk as a target on 13 August 1958 about off the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

<text>The Capital Centre (later USAir Arena and US Airways Arena) was an indoor arena in the eastern United States, located in Landover, Maryland, a suburb east of Washington, D.C. The seating capacity was 18,756 for basketball and 18,130 for hockey.

Opened in late 1973, it closed in March 2002, and was demolished that December.

==History==
In 1964, Abe Pollin became the owner of the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Baltimore Bullets and wanted to reconnect the sport to the DC region. Pollin announced plans to build a $18 million multi-purpose sports arena in the Maryland beltway in 1972. Ground-breaking of the arena took place on August 24 of that year. The construction lasted for 15 months before the arena opened on December 2, 1973.

It was located just outside (east) of the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495) at exit 16, less than a mile (1.6 km) southeast of FedExField, the home of the Washington Commanders of the National Football League, which opened in 1997. The elevation at street level was approximately above sea level.

The U.S. Census Bureau defined the land later occupied by The Boulevard at the Capital Centre as being in the Mitchellville census-designated place as of the 1990 U.S. Census, while in the 2000 U.S. Census the area was placed in the Lake Arbor CDP.

In 1993, the air carrier USAir purchased the naming rights for the building and the arena became known as USAir Arena. The rename was initially not popular with Washington-area residents. When the airline went through its 1996 rebranding and became US Airways, the name of the arena accordingly changed to US Airways Arena which remained in use until its demolition in December 2002.

==Sports==
Capital Centre was the primary home of the Washington Bullets of the NBA, the Washington Capitals of the NHL, and Georgetown University men&#x27;s basketball. All three teams departed for the MCI Center (now Capital One Arena), just north of the National Mall in D.C., when it opened in December 1997.

===Basketball===
Capital Centre hosted its first NBA game on December 2, 1973, as the Capital Bullets defeated the Seattle SuperSonics, 98–96 in front of a sellout crowd. During October and November 1973, the Bullets held their home games at nearby Cole Field House on the campus of the University of Maryland in College Park.

The arena hosted games of three NBA Finals; the first was in 1975, when the favored Bullets were swept by the Golden State Warriors. The Bullets returned to the Finals in 1978 and 1979, in tilts against the Seattle SuperSonics. In 1978, the Bullets won Games 2 and 6 at the Capital Centre on their way to claiming the championship, taking Games 4 and 7 in Seattle. The Bullets won the Finals&#x27; opener at home in 1979, but then dropped four straight to the Sonics, who celebrated their only NBA title after the Game 5 victory at Capital Centre. Footage of past Washington Bullets games held at the Capital Centre was used in the 1979 comedy film &quot;The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh&quot;. The arena was also the host of the 1980 NBA All-Star Game. The Washington Wizards were known as the Bullets until 1997 and played the first five home games of the 1997–98 season at the old arena under their new name.

====College basketball====
The ACC men&#x27;s basketball tournament was held at Capital Centre in 1976, 1981, and 1987. On December 5, 1981, the Georgetown Hoyas men&#x27;s basketball team played against San Diego State with a 71–53 win in their first game at the arena after moving from the McDonough Gymnasium. They played at the arena as their primary home until their last game at the venue on November 25, 1997, against Cleveland State.

===Ice hockey===
The arena also hosted the NHL&#x27;s Washington Capitals. The Capitals joined the league alongside the Kansas City Scouts as an expansion team for the 1974-75 season, making this arena their first to play their home games in. The Capitals hosted the 1982 NHL All-Star Game. The arena also was home to a few noteworthy NHL playoff games, including the Easter Epic in 1987. The Capitals played their final game at the venue in a 6–5 loss against the Montreal Canadiens on November 26, 1997.

===Other tenants===
The Washington/Maryland Commandos of the Arena Football League also called the arena home in 1987 and 1989. The Maryland Arrows, Washington Wave, and Washington Power lacrosse teams used the arena, as did the Washington Warthogs CISL professional indoor soccer team.

===Fighting===
A boxing World Heavyweight Championship bout took place at the venue in 1976 with Jimmy Young challenging the champion Muhammad Ali. The Friday night fight on April 30 went the full fifteen rounds and was awarded unanimously to a 35-year-old Ali defeated Alfredo Evangelista in another unanimous decision to retain the title on 

WWF wrestling matches were held at the arena throughout the 1980s and early 90s. The arena hosted WWF&#x27;s Survivor Series in 1995. Two WCW events were also held at the arena in 1989.

==Concerts==
The first concert ever held at the Capital Centre was the Allman Brothers Band on December 4, 1973, two nights after the first Bullets game. They were backed up by the James Montgomery Blues Band, who played from 9 P.M. until midnight. The Allman Brothers played until 3:30 A.M.

The Who played there two nights later on December 6, 1973, as part of the debut of their rock opera &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;. It was festival seating at the concert and there were no seats on the floor as the venue was newly opened and not finished. Lynyrd Skynyrd was the opening act that evening and throughout the tour, performing their landmark debut album. After drummer Keith Moon died in September 1978, The Who returned to the stage in May 1979 and later that year they performed at the Capital Centre on December 13 and 17. During a farewell tour they returned to the Capital Centre for two performances on September 22–23, 1982, the latter date opened by David Johanson.

The Jacksons held 5 concerts at the Capital Centre between 1974 &amp; 1981:

* January 4, 1974 w/ New York City (The Jackson 5 World Tour)
* September 24, 1976 w/ Johnny Taylor, B.T. Express, &amp; Bill Withers (Congressional Black Caucus Benefit Concert)
* June 9, 1979 w/ Sister Sledge (Destiny World Tour)
* July 31 &amp; August 1, 1981 w/ Stacey Lattisaw (Triumph Tour)

Michael Jackson held four sold-out concerts at the Capital Centre in 1988 during the Bad tour. The dates were October 13, 17, 18 and 19, 1988.

Frank Sinatra performed for four shows: April 24, 1974 (aud. 16,500), June 20, 1978 (17,000), May 8, 1987 (13,048), and March 31, 1988 (18,146), with Sammy Davis Jr. on the &quot;Together Again&quot; tour (Dean Martin left the tour shortly before the concert).

==Other events==
Other events there included monster truck shows, Arenacross shows, and tractor pulling shows.

The arena also hosted family-friendly events, such as the Harlem Globetrotters and Ice Capades. In the late 1970s, the arena hosted a circus named Circus America, which was created by Abe Pollin to compete with Feld Entertainment&#x27;s Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus.

Numerous graduation ceremonies for high schools in Prince George&#x27;s County were also hosted here.

On January 21, 1985, the arena hosted inaugural festivities celebrating President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s second inauguration. Reagan, Vice President George H. W. Bush, and their wives attended. Bitterly cold weather had forced the cancellation of the day&#x27;s inaugural parade in Washington, D.C. As a result, the alternative indoor event at the Capital Centre afforded the parade&#x27;s expected participants—including an estimated 9,000 students—an opportunity to perform for the president.

On January 19, 1993, a cast including Michael Jackson, Barbra Streisand, Elton John, the Alvin Ailey Dance Troupe, comedians Chevy Chase and Bill Cosby, and actors Jack Lemmon and James Earl Jones, performed at the 42nd Presidential Inaugural Gala in Bill Clinton&#x27;s honor. A specially re-formed Fleetwood Mac performed &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;, Clinton&#x27;s campaign song.

==Demolition==

The Capital Centre arena was imploded on December 15, 2002, by Controlled Demolition, Inc. It was replaced by The Boulevard at the Capital Centre, a town center-style shopping mall that opened in Landover in 2003, which was also demolished July 2019 to make way for Carillon, a new lifestyle-oriented mixed-use development on the same site.

==Legacy==

Opened in late 1973, the Capital Centre was the first indoor arena to have a video replay screen on its center-hung scoreboard. The four-sided projection video screen was known as the &quot;Telscreen&quot; (or &quot;Telescreen&quot;) and predated the Diamond Vision video screen at Dodger Stadium by seven years. It was also the first indoor arena to be built with luxury boxes, and a computerized turnstile system.

<text>Frederick Vincent &quot;Fritz&quot; Arbanas (January 14, 1939 – April 16, 2021) was an American football tight end. He played college football for the Michigan State Spartans. Arbanas was drafted in the second round (22nd overall) in the 1961 NFL draft by the St. Louis Cardinals and in the seventh round (53rd overall) of the 1961 AFL Draft by the Dallas Texans. He would spend his entire career with the Texans/Chiefs. Following his retirement he served as a legislator in Jackson County, Missouri.

==Early life==
Arbanas was born and raised in Detroit. He attended St. Mary&#x27;s of Redford High School. He was a two-way player and played college football at Michigan State University. As a sophomore in 1958, he scored his first touchdown reception against California. His biggest offensive game came during his junior season in a win over Notre Dame, when he caught four passes for 67 yards, including a 59-yard touchdown. As a senior, he was primarily known for his play on defense. He only caught three passes that year, but two were for touchdowns. Just as his first reception was for a touchdown, so was his last in 1960, in the season finale against the University of Detroit Titans.

Arbanas earned a Bachelor of Science degree in education from Michigan State.

==Professional career==
Arbanas was drafted by the American Football League&#x27;s Dallas Texans (later the Kansas City Chiefs) in the seventh round (54th overall) of the 1961 AFL Draft and by the National Football League&#x27;s St. Louis Cardinals in the second round (22nd) overall in the 1961 NFL draft.

He signed with the Texans for the 1961 season, but he missed that season due to ruptured disks in his back. However, beginning the following year he would not miss a game for eight consecutive seasons.

Arbanas was selected by his peers as &quot;The Sporting News&#x27;&quot; All-AFL tight end in 1963, 1964, and 1966. He was an American Football League Western Division All-Star in 1962, 1963, and 1964.

His fourth season, 1964, was his most productive with 34 receptions for 686 yards (a 20.2 average) and eight touchdowns — all career bests — as he was an AFL All-Star for the third time.

However, 1964 also marked a turning point in his life when, in December, he was brutally attacked by two men on a Kansas City sidewalk. He lost sight in one eye in January 1965, causing him to miss the AFL All-Star game. He was again a Western All-Star in 1965, 1966 (when he did not play due to injury), and 1967.

Because of his perseverance, he was a driving force behind one of the greatest teams in the history of the AFL.

Arbanas starred for two Chiefs Super Bowl teams and one World Championship team. He earned a Super Bowl ring when the Chiefs defeated the Minnesota Vikings 23–7, in Super Bowl IV, the last meeting between AFL-NFL rivals before the two leagues merged.

Arbanas used the playing field to write a legacy for the AFL. &quot;I remember when the Chiefs played the Chicago Bears the summer after the loss to Green Bay in the first Super Bowl&quot;, team owner Lamar Hunt said. &quot;We won the pre-season game 66–24, but there was a lot at stake in that game. I heard Fred say that was his most memorable game, and I feel the same way.&quot;

Arbanas retired from pro football after the 1970 season in which he appeared in six games for the Chiefs.

Arbanas was the AFL&#x27;s prototype tight end. His 198 receptions and 3,101 receiving yards were Chiefs records for a tight end until they were broken by Tony Gonzalez.

His talents would eventually earn a spot on the All-time All-AFL Team. He was inducted into the Kansas City Chiefs Hall of Honor in 1973. He was named to the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame in 1997. He was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 2012.

==Personal life==
During his career with the Chiefs, Arbanas held a full-time position with Fordyce Material and later with Kansas City Coca-Cola Bottling Company as Promotion Director.

He was a member of the board of directors for North American Savings Bank. He retired from Fred Arbanas, Inc. which was founded in 1970.

He was a longtime Jackson County, Missouri legislator beginning in 1973 and four-time Chairman of the Legislature (1974, 1975, 1988, and 1989). In recognition of his many years of service to Jackson County, in 1999 the Longview Lake Golf Course was renamed Fred Arbanas Golf Course at Longview Lake. On January 22, 2013, Arbanas&#x27; legislative colleagues presented him with a 40-year service pin.

In 1992, he ran in the Democratic primary against incumbent U.S. Congressman Alan Wheat, but Wheat won with 58.2 percent of the vote to Arbanas&#x27; 37.5 percent.

Arbanas lived with his wife Sharon Arbanas in Lee&#x27;s Summit, Missouri. He had four children and eight grandchildren. Fred served on the Jackson County Legislature in Kansas City, Missouri, and began serving as Temporary County Executive on January 4, 2016. He has also had a golf course named after him.

Arbanas died on April 16, 2021.

<doc id="771023" wikidata="Q1142808" url="?curid=771023" title="UW–Milwaukee Panther Arena">
<text>The UW–Milwaukee Panther Arena (originally the Milwaukee Arena and formerly MECCA Arena and U.S. Cellular Arena) is an indoor arena located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The arena, which seats as many as 12,700 people and offers of floor space, is part of a larger downtown campus, that includes the Milwaukee Theatre and Wisconsin Center.

It currently serves as the home to the American Hockey League&#x27;s Milwaukee Admirals, NCAA Division I Milwaukee Panthers men&#x27;s basketball team, and Major Arena Soccer League&#x27;s Milwaukee Wave. It was formerly home to the Milwaukee Hawks (1951–55) and Milwaukee Bucks of the NBA (1968–1988), and hosted the 1977 NBA All-Star Game. The venue was also home to Marquette University&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball team from 1974 to 1988.

==History==
The arena opened in 1950 and was one of the first to accommodate the needs of broadcast television. It was folded into MECCA (The Milwaukee Exposition, Convention Center and Arena) when the complex opened in 1974. It is also known for its former, uniquely painted basketball court by Robert Indiana in 1978, with large orange &#x27;M&#x27;s taking up both half-courts representing Milwaukee. The Indiana floor was purchased by a fan in the early 2010s and is currently in storage at a storage facility in Milwaukee.

In 1994, the Wisconsin Center District (WCD), a state organization, was created in order to fund the Midwest Express Center, and, in 1995 the MECCA complex was folded into this, including the Arena

The WCD added the Wisconsin Athletic Walk of Fame alongside the U.S. Cellular Arena in 2001. At the end of this public promenade is a Wisconsin Historical Marker noting the location where Christopher Sholes invented the first practical typewriter, featuring the QWERTY keyboard layout.

In 2008 and 2009, it was home to the Milwaukee Bonecrushers of the Continental Indoor Football League.

On August 7, 2010, the arena hosted an Arena Football League playoff game between the Milwaukee Iron and the Chicago Rush. The Iron played their 2010 regular season home games at the BMO Harris Bradley Center, but the ongoing installation of the new center court scoreboard in that venue forced the home playoff games to be played at the U.S. Cellular Arena, where the Iron would go on to win.

The arena has been the home of the Milwaukee Panthers men&#x27;s basketball team at three different times—first from 1993 to 1998, then from 2003 to 2012, and since 2013. The Panthers played their 2012–2013 home games at the 3,500-seat Klotsche Center on UWM&#x27;s east side campus. The move generated complaints from some Panthers fans and attendance lagged as the team had its worst record since the 1990s. After Amanda Braun was named UWM&#x27;s athletic director in March 2013, she said she would re-examine the decision to move games from the U.S. Cellular Arena. In July 2013, UWM officials reached a 5-year contract with the Wisconsin Center District that was set to run through 2018 before the 2014 naming rights deal extended the partnership through at least 2024.

In 2014, the arena was renovated to install new seats in the lower bowl, a new scoreboard, and updated signage to reflect the name change.

On March 16, 2016, it was announced the Admirals signed a 10-year lease with a five-year mutual extension. Also included on the deal was $6.3 million for upgrades to the arena, including new concession areas and a team store.

On October 26, 2017, the Bucks returned to the arena for a regular season game against the Boston Celtics in honor of their 50th anniversary in the NBA. For this event, the Bucks, by agreement with Robert Indiana, installed a newly built floor featuring a duplicate of his original MECCA court for that game only. After the game, the floor was temporarily moved to Menominee Nation Arena in Oshkosh, home to the Bucks&#x27; NBA G League affiliate, the Wisconsin Herd.

===Seating capacity===
The seating capacity for basketball has changed as follows:
==Other uses==

=== Basketball tournaments ===
As the MECCA, the building hosted first- and second-round games in the Mideast Regional of the 1984 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament.

The arena also hosted all or part of every Horizon League men&#x27;s basketball conference tournament from 2003 to 2011, including a sold-out crowd of 10,783 for the 2005 championship game, where Milwaukee defeated Detroit 59–58.

===Concerts===
Since the 1960s, the Arena has held a number of concerts by high-profile performers. The Beatles headlined a performance on September 4th in the Arena as part of their historic 1964 U.S. tour, and Elvis Presley performed 2 back-to-back shows at the Arena in 1972. He would return again in 1974 and 1977, with the latter occurring 4 months before his death later that year.

In 1980, Queen performed at the Arena. Bob Dylan played a two-night stand there as part of his Fall 1981 tour, and returned in both 1999 and 2001 for one-night appearances. The Grateful Dead performed there during their spring 1989 tour.

===Professional wrestling===
The arena has also hosted professional wrestling events, including WCW&#x27;s &quot;SuperBrawl&quot; (1992), &quot;Clash of the Champions XXXIV&quot; (1997) and &quot;Mayhem&quot; (2000). It also hosted the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s &quot;King of the Ring&quot; (1996), and &quot;Over the Edge&quot; (1998). It was at the aforementioned King of the Ring card where Stone Cold Steve Austin first uttered his now-famous &quot;Austin 3:16&quot; catchphrase. It was scheduled to host the April 1, 2020 edition of All Elite Wrestling &quot;Dynamite&quot; before coronavirus-related public assembly concerns postponed the circuit&#x27;s Milwaukee show to August 25, 2021.

== Naming rights ==
The arena opened as Milwaukee Arena in 1950 before changing its name to MECCA Arena once the Milwaukee Exposition, Convention Center and Arena (MECCA) complex formally opened in 1974. In 1994, when the Wisconsin Center District was created, the MECCA name was retired and the arena became Wisconsin Center Arena.

Telecommunications company U.S. Cellular became the naming rights holder in 2000. They renewed their deal in 2007, worth $2.4 million over 7 years.

U.S. Cellular&#x27;s naming rights expired on May 31, 2014, and they did not renew their contract. On June 26, 2014, it was announced that the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee (UWM) purchased the naming rights, renaming the arena to UW–Milwaukee Panther Arena, as part of a 10-year, $3.4 million deal that would run through 2024, with UWM having an option to extend it through 2029. The deal made the arena the official site for major UWM events such as graduation ceremonies and university-hosted speakers. In 2021, UWM received a 25% reduction in their 2020 payment, equivalent to $87,500, after the COVID-19 pandemic left the arena nearly empty for the year.

<text>Clemon Daniels Jr. (July 9, 1937 – March 23, 2019) was an American professional football halfback who played in the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL).

==College career==
Daniels attended Doty High School, an all-black school in McKinney, Texas. His mother worked as a housekeeper to a bank chairman but one moment that stuck with Daniels was after a celebration of his scholarship offer to Prairie View A&amp;M University. She told him that the next time he came by the chairman&#x27;s house, he was to come through the back door.

At Prairie View A&amp;M University, he was voted to All-Conference honors during his sophomore and junior years, and he captained the NAIA National Football Championship team in his senior year.

He also completed the Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) Program at Prairie View A&amp;M, later being a commissioned officer in the United States Army Reserve.

==Professional career==
Daniels was signed as a free agent in 1960 by the AFL&#x27;s Dallas Texans, who, like other AFL teams recruited players from small and predominantly black colleges, following the lead of the NFL which had been drafting HBCU schools since 1950. He was on the Texans&#x27; roster for 14 games in 1960, but saw little playing time behind Abner Haynes. He saw a handful of returns while also playing the defensive side of the ball. In his first game against the Oakland Raiders on September 16, he recorded an interception for his very first statistic. He recorded two more interceptions on the year while returning nine kicks for 162 yards.

In 1961, he was traded to the AFL&#x27;s Oakland Raiders, and spent seven years there. He was given a varying level of touches that year. He scored his first touchdown against Buffalo on December 3. In total, he ran for 154 yards on 31 carries for two touchdowns. On opening day against the New York Titans on September 9, 1962, Daniels had his first 100-yard game in a 28–17 loss, doing so on 10 carries. He got his first multi-touchdown game on November 4 with two rushing touchdowns against the Titans. He topped that performance on December 9 with a 187-yard performance for 20 carries and a touchdown in a 32–17 loss. He ran for 766 yards on the season on 161 carries with eight touchdowns (seven rushing). Daniels and the Raiders improved greatly in 1963, the first of four straight American Football League All-Star seasons for him. During the year, he made his opposition known to playing a preseason game in Mobile, Alabama. The result was that the game was played in Oakland instead. Daniels had rushed for less than 200 yards combined in his first five games, but he went off against the New York Jets with a 200-yard performance that saw him score twice on 27 carries while also catching a pass for 56 yards for another touchdown in a 49–26 win. He had three more 100-yard rushing games to finish the year with 1,098 yards while scoring three rushing touchdowns and five touchdown receptions. He led the league in rushing yards along with yards per game (78.5), scrimmage yards (1,785), and with his 685 yards receiving on 30 catches also led in yards per reception (22.8). Daniels was one of three players named MVP of the AFL, as Associated Press, UPI, and The Sporting News each selected a different player: Lance Alworth was named the UPI MVP while AP named Tobin Rote and Daniels was named the &quot;Sporting News&quot; American Football League Player of the Year.

Daniels regressed the following year, which notably saw him rush for -1 yard on opening day against Boston. However, he ran for 824 yards on 173 carries with two touchdowns while catching 42 passes for 696 yards with six touchdowns. The following year, he ran for 884 yards on 219 carries for five touchdowns while also catching 36 passes for 568 yards with seven touchdowns. In the All-Star Game that year that was targeted for play in January 1965, Daniels served as a key voice in a boycott called by him and other fellow black players from playing the game in New Orleans due to discrimination, such as being refused service by a number of New Orleans hotels and businesses. The game was successfully moved to Houston. Daniels ran for 801 yards on 204 carries in 1966 while scoring ten total touchdowns in his final All-Star selected year; in back-to-back weeks (October 30, November 6), he scored three touchdowns each. Daniels ran for 575 yards on 130 carries with four touchdowns before he broke his leg in the November 23 game against the Kansas City Chiefs. He missed the rest of the season, which saw the Raiders go all the way to Super Bowl II. Daniels played sparingly in the 1968 season with the San Francisco 49ers, running for just 37 yards on 12 carries. He caught two passes for 23 yards in what became his final season.

==Post playing career==
Daniels had spent his off-seasons teaching high school students in Dallas and Oakland. Daniels bought his first tavern in 1967. He soon became a member of the California State Packing Store and Tavern Owners Association (CAL-PAC). He later became president of the organization during a conflict with Huey Newton and the Black Panthers. Conversations with Newton eventually led to a CAL-PAC scholarship program for high school students in the Bay Area.

==Legacy==
Daniels retired as the all-time leading rusher in the American Football League with 5,138 yards. He was selected to the All-Time All-AFL Team. He was the all-time leading rusher for the Raiders until he was passed by Mark van Eeghen over a decade after his retirement. Only two players have passed Daniels since then in Marcus Allen and Josh Jacobs.

Daniels was voted into the Prairie View A&amp;M University Sports Hall of Fame in 1989 and the California Black Athletic Hall of Fame in 1993. He was inducted into the Texas Football Hall of Fame in 1999. Ron Wolf called Daniels “without doubt, the best halfback in the American Football League during his time...The thing that made Clem so good was his overall athletic ability. He ran a 4.6-40 in full gear, which was amazing for a guy his size.

<text>Abraham (Abram) Leon (born Abraham Wejnstok; October 22, 1918 - September 1944) was a Belgian Jewish Trotskyist party leader and theorist, who was murdered in 1944 by the Nazis at the Auschwitz death camp.

==Biography==

Leon was born in Warsaw on October 22, 1918. His parents, adherents of &quot;official petit-bourgeois Zionism&quot;, left Poland to pursue the Zionist dream in Palestine; the family quickly re-emigrated in 1926 to Belgium. Leon became a member and then leader of the Belgian branch of &quot;Hashomer Hatzair&quot;, a left-wing Zionist youth movement. In 1936, after hearing speeches of the Trotskyist leader of the to militant Belgian coal miners, Leon was won over politically from Stalinism to Trotskyism. Between 1936 and 1940 Leon slowly and methodically made his political transition from the &quot;Hashomer Hatzair&quot; to revolutionary Trotskyism. 

When the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of 1939 threw Dauge&#x27;s Belgian Trotskyists (and Dauge himself) and the Belgian Communist Party into deep demoralization, it was Leon who was instrumental in keeping the flame of revolutionary Marxism alive in Belgium. According to Ernest Mandel, &quot;[c]orrectly establishing the reasons which we had for hope, Leon noted that the workers’ movement in Europe had already reached the lowest point of its ebb. It was now necessary to count upon a new rise. It was necessary not to await it passively but to prepare for it, preparing for it the cadres and insofar as possible the masses. [...] When, on August 20, 1940 we were overwhelmed by the tragic news of the assassination of L.D. Trotsky, Leon immediately wrote the first illegal pamphlet of the Belgian Trotskyist movement. He established contact with several former regional leaders of the party in Brussels. The first leadership began to take form. The illegal Trotskyist organization was born on the day following the death of its spiritual father. [...] From this moment on, the story of Leon was linked with the history of the Trotskyist movement in Belgium.&quot; At some point, Leon shared an apartment with fellow Trotskyist and resistance leader, the German Martin Monath, to whom he tasked on making work within the Wehrmacht in occupied France.

Mandel credits Leon with being &quot;the principal inspirer of the [Belgian Trotskyist] party&quot;. He states that Leon &quot;served as political secretary from the time the first executive committee was set up&quot; and that Leon served as the editor-in-chief of the illegal Belgian Trotskyist newspaper La Voie de Lénine (The Road of Lenin); he also wrote many of the most important articles for this paper.

Leon was also instrumental in making contact with other sections of the Fourth International in wartime Europe – a most difficult and hazardous task; in August 1942, Leon co-organized the first meeting between the Belgian and French Trotskyist parties; he also led the illegal &quot;party work among the proletarian soldiers of the Wehrmacht&quot; and &quot;attended meetings of the underground factory committees&quot; at tremendous risk to himself.

Leon exhorted Belgian workers to fight both Hitler and Churchill in the classical Leninist fashion of turning imperialist World War II into a civil war.

==Arrest, imprisonment, torture, and murder==

In 1943–1944, as the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini collapsed in Italy, the revolutionary socialist workers of Europe began to sense that the end of the war was near and that with it would come opportunities for revolutionary struggle – as had happened at the end of WWI. Leon, preparing for that eventuality, played a leading role &quot;in the work of the European Conference of the Fourth International&quot; held in February 1944. When news of the Allied landings in Europe reached him, Leon decided that the time had come, finally, when it would once again be safe for him to return to his home in Charleroi; but on the very night of his arrival his home was raided by the police and he was arrested. He was taken to prison and tortured by the Gestapo; yet even under these conditions Leon was able to smuggle letters from prison and establish a tenuous link with his Belgian party comrades. The Nazis wasted no time in deporting Leon to Auschwitz where he was brutalized until he became sick and was then selected by the SS to be sent to the gas chamber. He was thus murdered by the Nazis in September 1944 at the age of 26.

==Theoretical works==

Leon&#x27;s most famous work in print is &quot;The Jewish Question: A Marxist Interpretation&quot;, a work which remains a widely used Marxist analysis of Jewish socio-economic history, antisemitism, and Zionism. Posthumously published in French in 1946, it did not receive much attention on publication, but gained renewed interest in the late 1960s, and early 1970s as the aftermath of the Six Day War revived the relevance of Zionism and anti-Zionism on the political left, becoming the most influential text among critics of Zionism in the New Left. Whilst containing a clear ideological bias and minor historical errors, the text is a thoughtful analysis of the Jewish question from a historical materialist perspective.

<doc id="771026" wikidata="Q2562949" url="?curid=771026" title="G4501 Beijing 6th Ring Expressway">
<text>The 6th Ring Road () is an expressway ring road in Beijing, China, which runs around the city approximately from the center of the city. The 6th Ring Road is approximately long.

The road is numbered G45 and is considered a peripheral segment of the G45 Daqing-Guangzhou Expressway. The Sixth Ring Road was opened for regular traffic on 12 September 2009.

==Route==
The 6th Ring Road runs within the confines of the municipality of Beijing. 

Basic Route: Liuyuan Bridge - Liqiaozhen - Sanhui Bridge - Zhangjiawan - Majuqiao - Huangcun - Liangxiang - Mentougou - Zhaikou/Wenquan - Xishatun - Gaoliying - Huosiying - Liuyuan Bridge

It is on the outer fringes of Beijing, and even beyond Beijing Capital International Airport. The expressway ring road is the only one to link with the equally remote Tongyan Expressway.

==History==
As early as 2000 or 2001, the southeastern stretch from Sanhui Bridge (interchange with the Jingha Expressway) through to Majuqiao (interchange with the Jingjintang Expressway) was put into operation. The route was first referred to as the projected 2nd Expressway Ring Road, much like the 5th Ring Road was once referred to as the 1st Expressway Ring Road; however, that name was abandoned in favour of the present-day 6th Ring Road.

By 2002, a road section starting in Xishatun (interchange with the Badaling Expressway) through to Sanhui Bridge, as well as a stretch from Majuqiao through to Huangcun/Shuangyuan Bridge (interchange with the Jingkai Expressway), were complete and opened to the general public.

Another 43 km of the expressway ring road opened behind schedule (the portion linking it up with the Jingshi Expressway and ultimately ending in Liangxiang in December 2004 and the section from the Badaling Expressway to Wenquan/Zhaikou in Mentougou in early January 2005). They were slated for a November 2004 opening. In the first case, the expressway was opened on December 20, 2004, at 14:00 local time, with over a month&#x27;s delay. The entire road was opened in 2010.

To re-connect several break-of-roads in MC region, Beijing Municipality government decided in 2019 that part of eastern 6th Ring, approximately 16 km, will be widen from 4-lane bidirectional to 6-lane, of which the middle 9.2km section will renovate as an underground section. After renovation, the on-ground sections will re-construct as a high line park. In September 2020, the biggest tunnel boring machine in China has built in Changsha to join the renovation works.

==Road conditions==

===Speed limit===
The speed limit is set between a minimum of 50 kilometers per hour (km/h) and a maximum of 100 km/h. Potential speed checks at Zhangjiawan and 500 metres to the east of Yongdingmen/Langfang exit; otherwise, none. Some drivers may exceed the speed limit, while others may travel below it.

Southwestern 6th Ring Road: carriageway-separated; note: there are no &quot;overtaking lanes&quot; on this part of the ring road; left lane, maximum speed limit 100 km/h, minimum 80 km/h, designated &quot;car only&quot;; right lane, maximum speed limit 100 km/h, minimum 60 km/h, designated &quot;carriageway&quot;.

===Tolls===
CNY 0.5/km, minimum charge of CNY 5, based on price for a small passenger vehicle. There have been (a few) calls to eradicate &quot;all&quot; toll gates within the confines of, and including, the 6th Ring Road. However, little to no action has been taken on this matter.
The 6th Ring Road is linked with Jingshi, Jingcheng, and Jingkai Expressways toll systems.

===Lanes===
Most sections are having 4 lanes (2 in each direction). There are some sections that were later widened to be 6 lanes (3 in each direction).

===Traffic &amp; Surface Conditions===
The traffic is usually very smooth; however, on weekends, tourists flock to suburban districts causing occasional traffic jams. The exit at Baige Bridge is also usually jammed due to heavy police presence at the exit. Car crashes also cause rare traffic jams. Surface conditions are generally excellent.

==Major exits==
Xishatun, Gaoliying, Sanhui Bridge, Zhangjiawan, Majuqiao, Huangcun/Shuanghui Bridge, Liuyuan Bridge

==Service areas==
None; Beihuofa Service Area is projected (E. 6th Ring Road), as a gas station on the Southwestern 6th Ring Road.

==Connections==
* S32 Jingping Expressway: Liqiaozhen.
* China National Highway 102 (Tongyan Expressway): Sanhui Bridge.
* G1 Beijing–Harbin Expressway: Zhangjiawan.
* Jingjintang Expressway: Majuqiao.
* G45 Daqing–Guangzhou Expressway: Huangcun, Shuangyuan Bridge, Gaoliying.
* G4 Beijing–Hong Kong and Macau Expressway: Liyuan Bridge.
* Badaling Expressway: Xishatun.

== Vast distances ==
At a distance of 20 kilometres from the centre of town, the expressway covers a much larger distance than the inner ring roads. Equally large is the distance between two points.

For example, the distance between Jingtong Expressway to Jingshen Expressway is approximately 2 kilometres on the 4th Ring Road. It expands to nearly 4 kilometres on the 5th Ring Road. On the 6th Ring Road, 10 kilometres elapse from one expressway to the other—and the Jingtong to Jingshen Expressway (on the 6th Ring Road, the Jingha to Jingshen Expressway) is one of the shortest distances between expressways in Beijing.

Anything up to 30 - 35 kilometres can lapse between the Jingcheng Expressway and the Jingha Expressway.

For most people, travel on the 6th Ring Road is extremely rare. Although, strictly speaking, it is still on the perimeters of city limits, this is one massive ring road for a motorist to travel around.

<text>The Multnomah are a tribe of Chinookan people who live in the area of Portland, Oregon, in the United States. Multnomah villages were located throughout the Portland basin and on both sides of the Columbia River. The Multnomah speak a dialect of the Upper Chinookan language in the Oregon Penutian family.

==History==

The Multnomah people are a band of the Chinookan peoples who originally resided on and near Sauvie Island in Oregon. The Multnomah and the related Clackamas tribes lived in a series of villages along the river near the mouth of the Willamette River on the Columbia River (the Willamette was also called the &quot;Multnomah&quot; in the early 19th century). According to archaeologists, the villages in the area were home to approximately 3,400 people year-round, and as many as 8,000 during fishing and wappato-harvesting seasons (wappato is a marsh-grown plant like a potato or onion and a staple food).

In 1830, a disease generally thought to have been malaria devastated the Multnomah villages. Within five years, the village of Cathlapotle was abandoned and was briefly inhabited by the Cowlitz tribe. The Multnomah people had nearly been wiped out by the year 1834 due to malaria and smallpox outbreaks. With only a few Multnomah left by the year 1910, the remaining people were transferred to the Grand Ronde Community which is also located in the Northwest of Oregon.

=== Location ===
In 1854 Multnomah County became an official part of Oregon. The Multnomah people were located in today&#x27;s Multnomah County, but more specifically, they inhabited Sauvie Island on the Columbia River. The Native American term for Sauvie Island was Wappatoo Island. The Multnomah people shared Sauvie Island with other Chinook tribes under the collective name The Cathlascans. Furthermore, the Multnomah people were considered “upper Chinook” and spoke the Wasco-wishram language. 
One of the larger villages, Cathlapotle, was located in present-day Clark County, Washington at the confluence of the Lewis River with the Columbia River and was visited by the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1805. According to their journals, Lewis and Clark found 14 houses in the village, most of them ranging from 14-by-20 ft (4.3 m by 6.0 m) to about 40-by-100 ft (12 m by 30 m). They reported that approximately 900 people lived in the villages. The Cathlacomatup were a group of Multnomah that resided along the Multnomah Channel at the Wappatoo Inlet. Lewis and Clark came into contact with the Cathalacomatup in 1805.

=== Chief Multnomah ===
The Multnomah people received their name from their chief. Yet, the existence of their great chief named Multnomah has been up for debate. Other Native American tribes in the Columbia River Valley area spoke of him in their oral history, while Oregon historians dismissed him as just a myth. Therefore, there is conflicting evidence of whether or not he was real. The Oregon Historical Society had multiple presidents throughout the 1900s who dismissed him as only an imagined chief. However, on top of the oral descriptions of him there were writings including newspapers and journals, which indicate he was indeed real.

Multnomah was the chief of tribes ranging across much of the Pacific Northwest from Oregon to Canada, and, during his 40 years of power, he was chief of the Willamettes, as well as war chief of the tribes and communities of Wauna, Oregon, ruling from his station on what is known today as Sauvie Island.

Ann Fulton, a history professor at Portland State University, found and collected much of what is known of Chief Multnomah from many written stories. She documented this in her paper &quot;The Restoration of an Iłkák&#x27;mana: A Chief Called Multnomah&quot;. She hoped to bring more awareness to his existence. Particular accounts came from people such as William Tappan and Dr. Elijah White, both agents of Indian tribes. The many verbal and written accounts of Chief Multnomah were similar. He was regarded highly, and many stated that while he was a warrior chief, he was very respected among his people.

It is believed that the end of Chief Multnomah&#x27;s reign occurred with the eruption of Mount Hood during the 1780s. In 1792, Captain George Vancouver and his crew did not encounter Chief Multnomah along their expedition, according to their records, however, later in 1805 when Lewis and Clark reached Sauvie Island they wrote of the “mulknomah” people. This referenced Chief Multnomah, as well as the group of tribes that made up his people.

==Culture==
The houses of the Multnomah, like the other Chinookan peoples, were largely longhouses made of Western Redcedar planks. The size of a home depended on the wealth of the owner, with the larger houses furnishing living quarters for up to 100 people. Within each house, a particular family had a separate cubicle separated by woven mats. Each family had its own fire, with the families also sharing a communal central fire in the household.

The Multnomah diet included salmon, eels, sturgeon, elk, water birds and especially wapato.

== Legends ==

=== Land and name claim ===
In one legend described in Jeanne Eder&#x27;s &quot;The Bridge of Gods&quot;, the name for the Multnomah people came from a dispute between two brothers.

According to Eder&#x27;s version of the story, the Great Spirit, who maintained no physical form, took care of the world&#x27;s people. Although everyone was content, the two brothers were not satisfied. The Great Spirit brought the siblings to the top of a mountain that overlooked their land. He told the brothers to shoot an arrow in opposite directions, and the Great Spirit allowed each brother to claim their land and chief hood based on where their arrows landed.

What is now called the Columbia River became the dividing border between the two brothers’ land claims. The first brother&#x27;s arrow landed in the Willamette Valley where he became Chief Multnomah of the Multnomah people. The second arrow landed north of the river in what is now modern day Klickitat County where he became chief of the Klickitat people.

=== Legend of Multnomah Falls ===

According to Wasco legend, the daughter of Chief Multnomah sacrificed herself to the Great Spirit from the top of Multnomah Falls. Tribes along the Columbia River celebrated the marriage of the Chief&#x27;s daughter to a neighboring tribe. The happiness didn&#x27;t last long, however, before the area experienced an illness that affected all of the tribes along the river. The medicine man claimed the Great Spirit told him all of the tribe would die unless the Spirit received a sacrifice; the Chief&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s life. The Chief wouldn&#x27;t allow it, but when the daughter saw the sickness affect her loved ones, she willingly left in the middle of the night to go to the top of the cliff overlooking the Columbia River. She threw herself off the cliff. When the Chief found his daughter&#x27;s body, he prayed to the Great Spirit for a sign that her spirit was well. Water began pouring from the cliff and became known as Multnomah Falls.

== The Multnomah today ==

Most of the Multnomah people who are still alive today reside in the Grand Ronde Federation and Warm Springs Indian Reservation, but the Multnomah no longer exist as a distinct tribe or people.

=== The name &quot;Multnomah&quot; ===
Many locations in the Pacific Northwest can accredit their names to the Multnomah people. Multnomah County takes its designation from this Native American word. It can also be found in the titles of the Multnomah Athletic Club, Multnomah Falls, Multnomah Village, and the statue of Chief Multnomah in a Portland park.

=== Artwork ===
Located in Portland, Oregon, Washington Park features a statue of Chief Multnomah called &quot;Coming of the White Man&quot;. The bronze statue was erected in 1904 by the sculptor Hermon Atkins MacNeil. He drew inspiration from the popularity of Frederic Balch&#x27;s book &quot;Bridge of the Gods: A Romance of Indian Oregon&quot;, which took the stories Balch had heard from Native Americans while growing up and embellished them. The statue features two Native Americans looking eastward along the Oregon Trail. The two men look down upon the route that ox teams trudged bringing settlers to the western United States. The older of the two men is said to be Chief Multnomah of the Multnomah people. The statue was donated to the city of Portland from the descendants of David P. Thompson. MacNeil went on the make other statuettes of Chief Multnomah.

The inspiration and the name of this sculpture comes from Meriwether Lewis and William Clark’s expedition across the United States. In 1805, upon arriving in Oregon, Lewis and Clark encountered a village. The men described the village of Native Americans who were known as “mulknomahs” encamped on Sauvie Island, and they originally referred to the now Willamette River as the Mulknoma.

Chief Multnomah was also depicted on linen postcards during the 1900s around 1930 and 1945. He is shown in colorful, traditional clothing. A print is currently part of The Tichnor Brothers Collection from the Boston Public Library. It is part of a series of Oregon related postcards and published by Angelus Commercial Studio of Portland, Oregon.

<text>USS &quot;Accohanoc&quot; (YTB/YTM-545/TD-25) was a in the service of the United States Navy, named after a tribe of the Powhatan confederacy.

==Construction==
&quot;Accohanoc&quot; was laid down on 12 April 1945, at Morris Heights, New York, by Consolidated Shipbuilding Corp.; launched on 9 July 1945; and delivered to the Navy on 28 December 1945.

==Service history==
By that time, however, World War II had ended and the Navy&#x27;s need for all types of ships had greatly diminished. Consequently, instead of joining the Fleet, the large harbor tug was placed in reserve at Green Cove Springs, Florida, and remained inactive for 16 months.

She was finally placed in service in May 1947, for duty in the 7th Naval District, plying the waters of Florida. When the 7th Naval District was dissolved on 1 September 1948, &quot;Accohanoc&quot; reported to the commandant of its successor, the enlarged 6th Naval District. That assignment endured for almost 40 years. In February 1962, the tug was reclassified a medium harbor tug and redesignated YTM-545. Her last years as a naval vessel were spent handling the in and out of berth at Pensacola Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Florida.

In February 1987, &quot;Accohanoc&quot; was placed out of service and her name was struck from the Navy List. She was transferred to the Maritime Administration (MARAD) on 10 June 1987.

&quot;Accohanoc&quot; was used in the James River Reserve Fleet, redesignated TD-25, until she was swamped 16 September 1999, by Hurricane Floyd. Her final disposition is unknown, but possibly scrapped.

<text>The Lordship of Transjordan () was one of the principal lordships of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. It encompassed an extensive and partly undefined region to the east of the Jordan River, and was centered on the castles of Montreal and Kerak.

==Geography and demography==
Transjordan extended southwards through the Negev to the Gulf of Aqaba (&quot;Ile de Graye, now Pharaoh&#x27;s Island&quot;). To the north and east (the ancient Gilead) there were no real borders — to the north was the Dead Sea and to the east were caravan and pilgrimage routes, part of the Muslim Hejaz. These areas were also under the control of the sultan of Damascus, and by custom the two opponents rarely met there, for battle or for other purposes.

==History==
===First Crusader kingdom (1099-1187)===
Before the First Crusade, Transjordan was controlled by the Fatimids of Egypt, whose representatives (originally very few, if any at all) withdrew when the Crusaders arrived. The various tribes there quickly made peace with the Crusaders. The first expedition to the area was under Baldwin I of Jerusalem in 1100. Baldwin also invaded again in 1107 and 1112, and built Montreal in 1115 to control the Muslim caravan routes, which provided enormous revenue to the kingdom. The crusaders also controlled the area around Petra, where they set up an archbishopric under the authority of the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem.

There were very few Christians in Transjordan, most of the inhabitants being Shia Bedouin nomads. Many of the Syriac Orthodox Christians who lived there were transplanted to Jerusalem in 1115 to fill up the former Jewish quarter (the Jews had been either killed or expelled). The other Christians who lived in Transjordan were nomadic or semi-nomadic and were often distrusted by the Crusaders.

According to John of Ibelin, the Lordship of Transjordan was one of the four major Vassals of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. John, writing in the 13th century, called it a lordship, but it may have been treated as a principality in the 12th century. It was established after the expedition of Baldwin I, but due to the relative size and inaccessibility of the area, the lords of Transjordan tended to claim some independence from the kingdom. With its mostly undefined borders, it was one of the largest seigneuries. Baldwin I may have given it away to Roman of Le Puy in 1118, but it probably remained under royal control until 1126 when Pagan the Butler was created lord (1126–1147). There was also a tradition that the ruler of Transjordan could not hold any other positions in the kingdom at the same time, so they were somewhat cut off from political life. Around 1134 a revolt occurred against King Fulk under Hugh II of Jaffa (Hugh II of Le Puiset), count of Jaffa, and Roman of Le Puy (who was possibly lord of Transjordan). They were defeated and exiled. In 1142, Fulk built the castle of Kerak (Crac des Moabites), replacing Montreal as the Crusader stronghold in the area. Other castles in Transjordan included Safed and Subeibe. Toron, near Tyre, and Nablus, in Judea, were not located in Transjordan, though they were sometimes ruled by the same people, usually through marriage.

In 1148, the lord of Transjordan was involved in the decision to attack Damascus during the Second Crusade, despite the truce between Jerusalem and Damascus that was vital to the survival of the kingdom and especially the lordship. The crusade ended in defeat and the security of the lordship diminished as a result.

Philip of Milly who was compelled to resign his lands in Nablus in order to be recognized as ruler of Transjordan in 1161. Philip joined the Knights Templar in 1165, leaving the lordship to his daughter Helena and son-in-law Walter III Brisebarre. Walter ruled the lordship in the name of his and Helena&#x27;s minor daughter, Beatrice, until Beatrice died. The lordship then passed to Philip&#x27;s younger daughter, Stephanie of Milly. Stephanie&#x27;s husbands, Miles of Plancy and Raynald of Châtillon, became lords of Transjordan in turn.

Raynald of Châtillon used his position to attack pilgrims and caravans, and threatened to attack Mecca, which resulted in an invasion of the kingdom by Saladin in 1187. Raynald was executed after the Battle of Hattin on July 4 of that year. By 1189 Saladin had taken all of Transjordan and destroyed its castles.

====Territory and economy====
Transjordan was also known in Latin as &quot;Transjordan&quot;, and covered territory that would later become part of the Emirate of Transjordan and the modern country of Jordan.

While under Crusader control, the Bedouin nomads were generally left to themselves, although the king collected taxes on caravans passing through. The land was relatively good for agriculture, and wheat, pomegranates and olives were grown there. Salt was also collected from the Dead Sea.

===Second Crusader kingdom (1191-1291)===
In 1229 Jerusalem was briefly recovered by treaty by Emperor Frederick II, but the remnant of the kingdom never again controlled territory to the east of the Jordan. The principality was of course claimed by crusader nobles for a long time, the title passing to the line of Isabella of Toron, daughter of Stephanie, and for several generations belonged to Montfort family, who were lords of Tyre. After the 1350s, when the Montfort line became extinct without close heirs, the hereditary rights presumably passed to the kings of Cyprus who also were descendants of lords of Toron and Tyre.

<text>Brian Christopher Rafalski (born September 28, 1973) is an American former professional ice hockey defenseman. He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the New Jersey Devils and Detroit Red Wings, in the SM-liiga for HPK and HIFK, in the Elitserien for Brynäs IF, and in the ECHL for the Florida Everblades.

After going undrafted, Rafalski spent four seasons in Europe - winning the Pekka Rautakallio trophy as best Liiga Defenseman in 1997, and 1999, the Finnish SM-liiga championship with HIFK in 1998, and the Kultainen kypärä (&quot;the Golden Helmet&quot;) in 1999. After entering the NHL in 1999 as a free agent with the Devils, Rafalski played in five Stanley Cup Finals during the 2000s, his first three with the Devils and his last two with the Red Wings. Of the five Finals he played in, he won three Stanley Cups, his first two with the Devils in 2000 and 2003, and his last with the Red Wings in 2008. Rafalski also played for the United States national team in three Olympic ice hockey tournaments (2002, 2006, and 2010), winning silver in 2002 and 2010 after losing to Canada in the gold medal games in both years.

==Playing career==

===Amateur===
As a youth, Rafalski played in the 1987 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Detroit.

Rafalski played for the Madison Capitols of the United States Hockey League (USHL). In 47 games during the 1990–91 season he scored 23 points with 12 goals and 11 assists.

===College and European play===
Rafalski played for four years at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and was a proficient player, scoring 45 points in 43 games in his senior year with the Badgers. He won several awards that season — he was named to the WCHA First All-Star Team, the NCAA West All-Star Team and the WCHA Defenseman of the Year. With no immediate NHL prospects, however, Rafalski travelled overseas, spending the 1995–96 season with Brynäs IF of the Swedish Elitserien.

After scoring only nine points in 22 games in Sweden, he then moved to Finland to play a season for HPK of the SM-liiga, scoring 35 points. He then moved to HIFK in 1997, where he spent two successful years. In his final year in Finland, he scored 19 goals and 53 points in 53 games, and won the Kultainen kypärä, awarded to the top SM-liiga player of the season, as voted by fellow players. Notably, he also became the first non-Finnish player to win the award.

===NHL career===

====New Jersey Devils====

Rafalski was named by &quot;Sporting News&quot; in 1999 as the best hockey player in the world not playing in the NHL. On May 7, 1999, Rafalski was signed by the New Jersey Devils as a free agent at the age of 25 to start the 1999–2000 season.

Immediately after arriving in New Jersey, Rafalski was partnered on defense with Devils captain Scott Stevens. The two remained as mainstay defensive partners for five years, until Stevens&#x27; retirement in 2004. Rafalski finished his rookie season with 32 points and led all rookie defensemen in plus-minus with a +21 rating, second among Devils defensemen and tied for first amongst all rookie players. Rafalski helped the Devils advance to the 2000 Stanley Cup Finals against the defending champion Dallas Stars, helping defeat them in six games. Along with Calder Memorial Trophy-winning teammate Scott Gomez, he was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team.

Rafalski improved his production in his sophomore season, scoring 52 points. His 18 points during the 2001 playoffs set a team record for defensemen, and the Devils made the Stanley Cup Finals for the second year in a row, although the Devils lost to the Colorado Avalanche in Game Seven, after leading the series and having two chances to defend their title after their Game Five win in Denver.

In the 2001–02 season, Rafalski continued his scoring pace, registering 47 points. He was selected to participate in the National Hockey League All-Star Game, but was forced to sit out due to injury. The next season, he once again led all Devils defensemen in scoring, with 40 points. He was a vital part of a Devils defense that helped the team win the Stanley Cup in Game Seven of the 2003 Stanley Cup Finals against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in June 2003.

====Detroit Red Wings====

On July 1, 2007, the Detroit Red Wings signed Rafalski to a $30 million, five-year contract as an unrestricted free agent. Rafalski had grown up in nearby Dearborn, Michigan, and had been a Red Wings fan growing up. He was teamed with another legendary defenseman, Nicklas Lidström.

Rafalski set a career high in goals (11) after scoring against the St. Louis Blues on March 5, 2008. He went on to score 13 goals for the season, amassing that amount in 73 games. On June 4, 2008, Rafalski helped lead the Red Wings to win the Stanley Cup in six games over the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals. He helped the cause by scoring the first Red Wings goal on the power play in the first period of Game Six to help Detroit win the series.

On January 1, 2009, Rafalski scored the game-winning goal for the Red Wings in the 2009 Winter Classic, the first NHL game played outdoors in Red Wings history. The Red Wings defeated the Chicago Blackhawks, 6–4.

On May 5, 2009, Red Wings Head Coach Mike Babcock announced that Rafalski would miss Game 3 of the Western Conference Semi-Finals. It was the first time Rafalski missed the first three games of a series. The Red Wings made the Stanley Cup Finals for the second year in a row, and met the Penguins again in a rematch of the previous years Stanley Cup Final, this time with the Penguins winning the Stanley Cup in Game Seven, after leading the series and having two chances to defend their title after their Game 5 win in Detroit.

On May 25, 2011, Rafalski announced his retirement from the NHL, walking away from the final year of his contract, citing knee and back injuries. Because Rafalski retired on an under-35 contract without being bought out, the move removed his cap hit for the season.

In the 11 NHL seasons that Rafalski played, his team qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs every year. Consequently, Rafalski led all NHL players in playoff games played during the 2000s decade, with 142.

On January 3, 2014, the Florida Everblades of the ECHL signed Rafalski to a contract, his first return to professional hockey since his initial retirement. He expressed a desire to return to the NHL, but was released 18 days after he signed, once again citing back issues.

==International play==




Rafalski represented Team USA at the 2002 Winter Olympics, winning a silver medal as the U.S. lost to Canada in the finals.

Rafalski continued to represent the U.S. in international play, playing in both the 2004 World Cup of Hockey and the 2006 Winter Olympics.

Rafalski also played in the 2010 Winter Olympics, serving as alternate captain. He scored two goals and assisted on another in Team USA&#x27;s 5–3 win over Canada in group-stage play, which ensured the United States would win their group and earn a bye to the quarter-finals. He finished third in the tournament in scoring (first among defensemen) with four goals and four assists. He was also named as the best defenseman of the tournament, as well as being named to the tournament all-star team. Unfortunately, his defensive mistake led to Canada&#x27;s tournament-winning goal in overtime of the gold medal game.

==Awards and honors==
* Best Defenseman of the 2010 Winter Olympics hockey tournament
* All-star selection, 2010 Olympic hockey tournament
* Inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame (2014)

==Personal life==
Rafalski and his wife Felicity have three sons — Danny, born in June 1997; Evan, born in October 2000; and Matthew, born in June 2004.

Rafalski has a degree from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in Economics. He has stated that he frequently listens to Glenn Beck.

Speaking about his retirement, Rafalski said, &quot;This was probably the most challenging season of my career, both physically, mentally and spiritually, but it was also the most rewarding and most blessed...The decision was made between myself and my wife approximately two months ago. We went through a long process of weighing different factors in our lives. At the end of the day it came down to priorities, with the top three priorities being serving God, serving my family and serving others.&quot;

Rafalski currently resides in Waupaca, Wisconsin with his family.

<text>FirstBank Stadium (formerly Dudley Field and Vanderbilt Stadium) is a football stadium located in Nashville, Tennessee. Completed in 1922 as the first stadium in the South to be used exclusively for college football, it is the home of the Vanderbilt University football team. When the venue was known as Vanderbilt Stadium, it hosted the Tennessee Oilers (now Titans) during the 1998 NFL season and the first Music City Bowl in 1998 and also hosted the Tennessee state high school football championships for many years.

FirstBank Stadium is the smallest football stadium in the Southeastern Conference, and was the largest stadium in Nashville until the completion of the Titans&#x27; Nissan Stadium in 1999.

The capacity of the stadium was 40,350 before its revamp in 2024.

==History==

===Old Dudley Field===
Vanderbilt football began in 1892, and for 30 years, Commodore football teams played on the northeast corner of campus where Wilson Hall, Kissam Quadrangle, and a portion of the Vanderbilt University Law School now stand, adjacent to today&#x27;s 21st Avenue South.

The first facility was named for William Dudley, Dean of the Vanderbilt University Medical School from 1885 until his death in 1914. Dudley was responsible for the formation of the SIAA, the predecessor of the Southern Conference and Southeastern Conference, in 1895, and was also instrumental in the formation of the NCAA in 1906.

In 1922, after a 74.2 winning percentage during the 18-year tenure of Coach McGugin, the Commodores had outgrown old Dudley Field. The old field was re-christened Curry Field, in honor of Irby &quot;Rabbit&quot; Curry, a standout football player from 1914 to 1916, who left Vanderbilt to serve in the American Expeditionary Force to Europe in World War I and was killed while flying a combat mission over France in 1918. The football team played two games on the renamed Curry Field before moving to New Dudley Field in 1922.

===New Dudley Field===
There was not enough room to expand old Dudley Field at its site near Kirkland Hall, so Vanderbilt administrators purchased land adjacent to what is today 25th Avenue South, on the west side of campus, for the new facility. The new stadium, the first in the South built solely for football, was christened &quot;Dudley Field&quot;, and its capacity was 20,000. As evidence of Vanderbilt&#x27;s stature in the sport at the time, it dwarfed rival Tennessee&#x27;s Shields-Watkins Field (now Neyland Stadium), which had opened a year earlier and seated only 3,200.
The first game played at Dudley Field was between the Commodores and the powerful Michigan Wolverines. A goal line stand by the Commodores preserved a 0–0 tie. The following Friday, nearby Hume-Fogg High School played a game at Dudley. Senior Jimmy Armistead returned the opening kickoff for a touchdown, the first touchdown ever recorded at the stadium. Armistead went on to a successful career at Vanderbilt. He was the captain and starting quarterback for the 1928 team.

In 1949, Vanderbilt officials built a modern press box at Dudley Field, replacing a platform that had been used prior to that. Additional seating was also added to the west side of stadium, boosting capacity to 27,901.

On September 25, 1954, Vanderbilt hosted the No. 10-ranked Baylor Bears in the first night game ever played on the Dudley Field surface. Lights were installed so that Dudley Field could host a Billy Graham Crusade on campus.

In 1960, nearly 7,000 more seats were added to the stadium, with an expansion on the east side of the stadium near Memorial Gym. Capacity jumped to 34,000.

At a price of $250,000 (equal to $ today), officials installed what was then a state-of-the-art AstroTurf synthetic surface in 1970.

===Vanderbilt Stadium===

====Battleship gray====
Over the winter and spring of 1980–81, most of the Dudley Field grandstand was demolished. The 12,088 seats on each sideline—the only vestige of the old stadium—were raised ten feet through the use of 22 hydraulic jacks on each side of the stadium. The &quot;new&quot; venue was rechristened Vanderbilt Stadium. However, the playing surface itself is still called Dudley Field.

The rebuilt stadium and its Fred Russell Press Box (named for Vanderbilt alumnus, former football player, and sports journalist Fred Russell) were designed to resemble a United States naval vessel slicing through the water—a nod to Vanderbilt&#x27;s naval themed-mascot, the Commodore. Accordingly, the color scheme picked for the exterior of the stadium was battleship gray.

The stadium&#x27;s maximum capacity after the 1980–81 renovation was 41,000, consisting of a single-decked horseshoe grandstand filled in with wooden bleachers from the 1960 expansion. The project cost $10.1 million, and the Commodores celebrated a sold-out dedication by taking a 23–17 comeback win over Maryland on September 12, 1981.

To enhance the gameday experience, officials increased capacity to 41,448 and added a Jumbotron video screen in the north end zone, adjacent to Kensington Place, in advance of the Tennessee Oilers playing their 1998 home games in the facility.

After the Oilers—now the Titans—left in 1999, the playing surface was returned to grass. In 2002 and 2003, the school removed the aging bleachers from the 1960 renovation from the north end zone, lowering capacity to 41,221 in 2002 and to 39,773 in 2003. The bleachers from the north end zone were replaced with a visitors&#x27; concourse that affords any fan in the stadium a field-level, up-close experience with the playing surface. The metal frames for the bleachers were relocated to Mt. Juliet Christian School&#x27;s football facility in suburban Nashville.

====Brick-and-iron====
After nearby Hawkins Field, Vanderbilt&#x27;s baseball stadium, was constructed in a classic brick-and-iron style in 2002, Vanderbilt administrators began to look at giving Vanderbilt Stadium a similar flavor. They also began to consider the construction of a football facility in place of the present concourse and JumboTron in the north end zone.

On July 24, 2007, Vanderbilt officials announced they were in the preliminary stages of a stadium renovation plan, with financing, design concept, and date of completion yet to be determined.

Nine months later, on May 20, 2008, Vice Chancellor David Williams II announced, in a McGugin Center press conference, that the university was beginning a five-phased, multimillion-dollar program of renovations to Vanderbilt athletics facilities, including extensive renovations and additions to Vanderbilt Stadium.

Under the plan announced by Williams, Vanderbilt Stadium was modified (in the first four phases) as follows:

On February 6, 2012, Williams announced Vanderbilt would be adding new FieldTurf and a new JumboTron. A large berm was constructed in the open end of FirstBank Stadium as a place for fans to watch games starting fall 2012. The project, in addition to other renovations, began after the Black &amp; Gold scrimmage on April 14, 2012.

With only 500 seats available, the hillside was a first-come, first-served area in terms of picking a spot to sit. The berm did not reach the permanent seating on the sidelines to leave space in the corners of the end zone for fans to enter.

The fourth major project set for the stadium was improved lighting. Renovations were also completed at McGugin Center, with new meeting rooms and Olympic sport locker rooms built. The work was completed in the summer of 2014.

Since the 2007 season, midshipmen of the Vanderbilt Naval ROTC sound a foghorn, nicknamed &quot;The Admiral&quot;, whenever the Commodores take the field, as well as after every score and win. It is also sounded at intervals prior to the scheduled kickoff to encourage fans to go ahead and enter the stadium. After wins the Commodores raise a victory flag sporting the &quot;Star V&quot; emblem.

===Naming rights===

On August 29, 2022, Vanderbilt announced a ten-year naming rights deal with Nashville-based FirstBank for the football team&#x27;s stadium.

===Historic upset win vs Alabama===

On October 5, 2024, FirstBank Stadium was the site of unranked Vanderbilt&#x27;s upset defeat of the then top ranked University of Alabama Crimson Tide 40-35. Overall, it was Vanderbilt&#x27;s first victory against the college football powerhouse since 1984, and in Nashville specifically since 1969. It was also Vanderbilt&#x27;s first win vs a Top 5 ranked opponent ever.

Vanderbilt students in celebration tore down the South end zone goalpost, and carried it approximately 2.5 miles through Nashville before throwing it into the Cumberland River.

== Other NCAA use ==
Tennessee State utilized FirstBank Stadium as a prominent venue for major games, hosting at least one game annually in 1971, from 1973 to 1994, and again in 1996. On September 15, 2018, while Vanderbilt was away playing Notre Dame, the Virginia Cavaliers played the Ohio Bobcats in FirstBank Stadium. The game was relocated from Charlottesville, Virginia due to the threat of Hurricane Florence.

For at least 2026 and 2027, the NCAA Division I Football Championship game will be played at FirstBank Stadium due to renovations at Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas.

==NFL use==
Upon moving to Nashville, the Oilers/Titans franchise initially played at the larger Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis while Nissan Stadium (then called Adelphia Coliseum) was under construction in Nashville. Initially, the Oilers were unwilling to play at Vanderbilt Stadium while Nissan Stadium was being built. Not only was it thought to be too small even for temporary use, but university officials were unwilling to allow the sale of alcohol.

However, dismal attendance during the 1997 season, due in part to both the unwillingness of many Nashville fans to make the trip to Memphis and Memphis fans&#x27; indifference to a temporary team after years of failing to secure their own NFL franchise, led the Oilers to play their last season under that name in Nashville at Vanderbilt Stadium, although the university forbade the franchise from selling alcohol at home games.

Vanderbilt Stadium thus became the smallest home venue in the NFL since several similar-size stadiums were used in 1970. (The merger agreement with the American Football League led the NFL to declare stadiums seating fewer than 50,000, such as Fenway Park, to be inadequate for league play and after the 1970 NFL season none were used for NFL games on a long-term basis.) The Los Angeles Chargers used a smaller venue, the 27,000-seat Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California, as their home for the 2017–18, 2018–19 and 2019–20 NFL seasons while SoFi Stadium was being built for the Chargers and the Los Angeles Rams, who were playing in the far larger Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in South Los Angeles.

==Non-sporting events==
Over its history, Vanderbilt Stadium has occasionally been used for concerts and major speakers.

<doc id="771066" wikidata="Q11295205" url="?curid=771066" title="Carlos Pulido">
<text>Juan Carlos Pulido Valera (August 5, 1971 – December 28, 2023) was a Venezuelan Major League Baseball relief pitcher who played for the Minnesota Twins in 1994 and between 2003 and 2004. He batted and threw left-handed.

==Career==
Signed at 18 in 1989 by Minnesota, the hard-throwing Pulido was a bright prospect in the Twins&#x27; system, but a 1995 arm injury ruined his chances as a starter. After spending one season with the Twins in 1994, he spent the next decade in the minor leagues, as well as with the Orix BlueWave, before spending two more seasons with the Twins in 2003 and 2004.

In a three-season career, Pulido posted a 3–8 record with 47 strikeouts and a 5.98 ERA in innings. Most notably, he was a part of baseball history on June 12, 1994, when he started a game in the Metrodome against the Chicago White Sox, who had fellow countryman Wilson Álvarez on the mound, marking the first time in major league history game that two Venezuelan starters faced each other. Pulido would earn the win in that encounter, tossing six innings of two-run ball as Hall of Famer Kirby Puckett belted a home run in the 6–2 victory.

Pulido had a successful career in Venezuelan Professional Baseball League (Liga Venezolana de Beisbol Profesional), playing for Navegantes del Magallanes, Tigres de Aragua and Cardenales de Lara. Lifetime, he had a 68–51 record, with a 3.08 ERA, in 234 appearances. In 2007, he did not play in any Summer League, instead coaching for the Texas Rangers Single-A team in the minor leagues. He was released by Cardenales in Venezuela, and rehired by his original team, Magallanes, before retiring in 2008 with Tiburones de la Guaira. In Venezuela, he was known as &quot;El Domador de Leones&quot; (The Lion Tamer).

Pulido was inducted into the Magallanes Hall of Fame on November 19, 2016.

On November 1, 2024, Pulido was posthumously elected to the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame, receiving 76% of the votes from the Contemporary Committee.

==Death==
After weeks of battling chronic health problems, and despite an initial health improvement, Pulido died on December 28, 2023, at a Caracas hospital. He was 52.

<text>A tee is a stand used in sport to support and elevate a stationary ball prior to striking with a foot, club, or bat. Tees are used extensively in golf, tee-ball, baseball, American football, and rugby.

==Etymology==
The word tee is derived from the Old Scots &quot;teaz&quot;, of unknown origin, possibly Scandinavian; apparently a plural form, or one incorrectly assumed to be so.

==Golf tee==
In golf, a tee is normally used for the first stroke of each hole. The area from which this first stroke is hit is in the rules known as the teeing ground. Normally, teeing the ball is allowed only on the first shot of a hole, called the tee shot, and is illegal for any other shot; however, local or seasonal rules may allow or require teeing for other shots as well, &quot;e.g.&quot;, under &quot;winter rules&quot; to protect the turf when it is unusually vulnerable. Teeing gives a considerable advantage for drive shots, so it is normally done whenever allowed. However, players may elect to play their tee shots without a tee. This typically gives the shot a lower trajectory.

A standard golf tee is 2.125&quot; (two and one eighth inches = 5.4 cm) long, but both longer and shorter tees are permitted. Ordinary tees can be made from wood or from durable plastic. There are also many biodegradable and recyclable golf tees that diminish the number of trees cut down to manufacture the tees and allow golf courses to lower costs by not having to deal with the broken wooden tees on their courses. 

According to the R&amp;A and USGA rules of golf, for a tee to be legal, &quot;It must not be longer than 4 inches (101.6 mm) and it must not be designed or manufactured in such a way that it could indicate the line of play or influence the movement of the ball.&quot;

===History===
The development of the tee was the last major change to the rules of golf. Before this, golf balls were teed up on little heaps of sand that were provided in boxes. This explains the historical name &quot;tee boxes&quot; for what is today known as &quot;teeing ground&quot;. 

The earliest golf tees rested flat on the ground and had a raised portion to prop up the ball. The first patent for this kind of tee is dated 1889, and was issued to Scotsmen William Bloxsom and Arthur Douglas. The first known tee to pierce the ground was a rubber-topped peg sold commercially as the &quot;Perfectum.&quot; This was patented in 1892 by Percy Ellis of England. In 1899, an African-American dentist, Dr. George Franklin Grant, obtained a patent for an &quot;improved golf tee&quot;. This tee consisted of a wood cone with a rubber sleeve to support the ball, but it is not known to have ever been marketed. 

These and other variations failed to catch on, as most golfers—whether because of tradition, habit, or concerns about the rules—continued using heaps of sand. It took a strong marketing effort by Dr. William Lowell, Sr. in the 1920s to bring manufactured tees into widespread use. Sales of his &quot;Reddy Tee,&quot; a simple wooden peg with a flared top, took off after Lowell hired professional golfers Walter Hagen and Joe Kirkwood, Sr. to promote the product during exhibition matches. It was copied around the world, and remains the most common type of golf tee.

==Tee-ball tee==
Tee-ball is based on baseball, with the main difference being the use of a tee in the place of a pitcher. Much larger than a golf tee, the tee-ball tee is a durable rubber stand attached to the home plate which supports the baseball at a suitable height for the batter to hit. It is adjustable to allow for variations in batter height. 

== Baseball tee ==

While a tee for baseball is very similar to a tee in tee-ball, the uses for the tee may differ. In baseball, a tee is used as a training device. This allows the hitter to simulate a pitch that will be thrown in many different locations. Using a tee, the hitter can set up a pitch that may be thrown inside, down the middle, and outside as well as high and low. Unlike tee-ball, where the ball is sitting on the tee, in baseball the pitch is being thrown by another player, resulting in the ball crossing the plate in several different areas. As a batter, using a tee as a training aid will help the hitter perfect his swing no matter where the pitch is thrown. A tee may also be used for batting drills. Drills are used to strengthen the players hitting motion and to get them used to hitting baseballs in different locations. 

These tees may also be used in softball as a training device.

==Kicking tee==

A kicking tee is a rubber or plastic platform, often with prongs and/or a brim around an inner depression.

In American football and Canadian football, a tee may be used on kickoffs to raise the ball slightly above the playing surface (up to one inch, by NFL and NCAA rules). The first use of the tee is attributed to Arda Bowser, a member of the Canton Bulldogs NFL championship team of 1922. The CFL and some high school leagues also allow the use of another sort of tee on field goal and extra point kicks, where another player (the holder) places one end of the ball on this &quot;tee&quot; (which is not a tee in the strictest sense of the term, but instead a rubber block; such &quot;tees&quot; come in 1&quot; and 2&quot; types) and holds the opposite end; in college and the NFL, all extra point/field goal attempts can only be made off the ground.

Tees may also be used for place kicks in rugby league football and rugby union football.

Tees are used for kick-outs in Gaelic football. In 2006, Shane Curran devised an adjustable tee on which the ball rested on brush hairs to replicate kicking from grass; the design went on to be used by most goalkeepers.

<doc id="771070" wikidata="Q7866995" url="?curid=771070" title="USS Accokeek">
<text>USS &quot;Accokeek&quot; (ATA-181) was an ATA-174 class auxiliary ocean tug in the service of the United States Navy, named after the Accokeek tribe of Native Americans.

She was laid down as the unnamed &quot;ATA-181&quot; on 15 June 1944 at Orange, Texas by Levingston Shipbuilding, launched on 27 July 1944, and commissioned on 7 October 1944.

==Service history==
===World War II, 1944–1946===
After shakedown, she sailed for the Pacific Ocean, transiting the Panama Canal early in January 1945 and stopping in Hawaii in March. Resuming her voyage west, the tug arrived at Guam on 25 March, a week before the assault on Okinawa. For the rest of the war, &quot;ATA-181&quot; aided warships damaged in that campaign, towing them from combat into Kerama Retto and thence to bases in the Marianas and in the Western Carolines.

She stayed in the Far East after the war providing towing and salvage support for the American occupation forces. On 15 October, a severe typhoon struck the anchorage at Okinawa and drove &quot;ATA-181&quot; aground, but the tug escaped heavy damage and soon returned to duty. Her Far Eastern assignment ended early in the summer of 1946, and she began the long voyage to the east coast of the United States. Steaming via Pearl Harbor, San Francisco, and the Panama Canal, &quot;ATA-181&quot; reached Philadelphia on 20 November.

===Atlantic Fleet, 1946–1972===
Over the next 26 years, she carried out a variety of missions for the United States Atlantic Fleet. On 16 July 1948, she became &quot;Accokeek&quot;. While she operated most often along the eastern seaboard and in the West Indies, her work also took her to such widely separated locations as Labrador, Ascension Island, and even inland to Lake Michigan. Philadelphia served as her home port through most of her postwar career, but that changed on 30 June 1969 when &quot;Accokeek&quot; was reassigned to Little Creek, Virginia. The tug operated from that base for the remaining three years of her Navy service.

===Decommissioning and disposal===
Decommissioned at Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 29 June 1972, &quot;Accokeek&quot; was transferred to the Maritime Administration on 19 September 1972 for layup in its National Defense Reserve Fleet. On 31 March 1986, &quot;Accokeek&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register. She was sunk as an artificial reef in the Gulf of Mexico on 20 February 1987 and is a recreational dive site of the Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail

<doc id="771072" wikidata="Q7972104" url="?curid=771072" title="Washington Park (baseball)">
<text>Washington Park was the name given to four Major League Baseball parks on two different sites in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, located at the intersection of Third Street and Fourth Avenue. The two sites were diagonally opposite each other, on the southeast and northwest corners.
The land on which the ballparks were built was itself known as &quot;Washington Park&quot; and originally consisted largely of an open green space which was flooded in the wintertime as a skating rink. It featured an old building then called the Gowanus House, which stands today, albeit largely reconstructed. Known today as the Old Stone House, it was used in Revolutionary times as an impromptu headquarters by General George Washington during the Battle of Long Island, during a delaying action by 400 Maryland troops against approximately 2000 British and Hessian troops that allowed a good portion of the Continental Army to retreat to fortified positions on Brooklyn Heights. Those events inspired the park&#x27;s name, as well as that of the three major league ballparks that were to be built there.

Baseball first came to Washington Park in 1861, in the form of a winter baseball game played on skates. The Brooklyn Atlantics professionals took on the Charter Oak Base Ball Club, another Brooklyn-based team, before 15,000 spectators. The &quot;New York Times&quot; marveled at the skating skills of the players, insisting that the players &quot;seemed to be quite as much at home (on the ice), and played as well on runners (skates) as when on &quot;terra firma&quot;.&quot; The Atlantics took the contest, 36–27.

==First park==
The first ballpark was built in 1883, bounded by Third and Fifth Streets to the north and south, and Fourth and Fifth Avenues to the west and east. The Old Stone House was incorporated into the ballpark as a &quot;Ladies&#x27; House&quot; and storage. The wooden ballpark was the home of the Brooklyn baseball club during 1883–1891, with a slight interruption by a destructive fire in mid-May of the 1889 season. (Some sources, such as Retrosheet, number the pre- and post-fire ballparks as separate entities.) The team&#x27;s uniforms and equipment had been stored in the Old Stone House at the time and were spared.

The team, originally known as the Brooklyn Grays for the color of their uniforms, started in a minor league in 1883. The following season they joined the then-major American Association. With the new league came a new name, the Atlantics in reference to the old Atlantics of Brooklyn, and they were known as the Bridegrooms by the time they switched to the National League in 1890. Streetcar (trolley) tracks ran near the ballpark, inspiring the team nickname that ultimately stuck: Trolley Dodgers.

The ice baseball fad resurfaced in the mid-1880s, leading writer Henry Chadwick to organize a series of games at Washington Park. Teams of professional ballplayers faced off against amateurs in January of 1884, ten to a side (the tenth player covering the park&#x27;s short right field).

In 1891, the Trolley Dodgers moved into the Players&#x27; League one-year-old ballpark, Eastern Park in Brownsville. The first Washington Park was demolished and its wooden grandstand transported to Eastern Park. The move itself proved to be ill-advised, and the Dodgers struggled to draw fans in their new neighborhood. They abandoned Eastern Park after six poorly attended seasons, moving back to Park Slope and building a new ballpark across the street from the site of their first.
==Second park==
The second Washington Park was bounded by First and Third Streets, and Third and Fourth Avenues. It was located at . The park seated 18,800. It consisted of a covered grandstand behind the infield and uncovered stand down the right field line. The Brooklyn National Leaguers, by then often called the &quot;Superbas&quot; as well as the &quot;Dodgers&quot;, moved into this new ballpark in 1898, where they would play for the next 15 seasons. On April 30, 1898, the Dodgers played their first game at new Washington Park and 15,000 fans attended. One of the more unusual features of the Park was the aroma from nearby factories and Gowanus Canal, which was a block away and curled around two sides of the ballpark.

Meanwhile, owner Charlie Ebbets slowly invested in the individual lots on a larger piece of property in Flatbush, which would become the site of Ebbets Field once he had the entire block. So in 1913, the Dodgers abandoned Washington Park. The Brooklyn &quot;Daily Eagle&quot; waxed nostalgic about the old ballpark, and speculated on what might happen to the property. It would turn out to have a brief reincarnation as the home of the Federal League club in 1914 and 1915.
===Seating capacity===

==Third park==
The Brooklyn Tip-Tops or &quot;BrookFeds&quot; of the Federal League, the only major league team ever named for a loaf of bread, acquired the ballpark property in 1914, then rebuilt the second Washington Park in steel and concrete. The old park took on a modern appearance; in fact, it was nearly a duplicate of the initial version of another Federal League park in Chicago that would become Wrigley Field. However, with the Dodgers in a new and somewhat more spacious steel-and-concrete home already, Ebbets Field, there was no long-term need for Washington Park, so it was abandoned for the final time after the Federal League ended its two-year run.

Part of the left center field wall of this final Washington Park still stands on the east side of 3rd Avenue, south of 1st Street, as part of a Con Edison yard.

<text>The Neponset River is a river in eastern Massachusetts in the United States. Its headwaters are at the Neponset Reservoir in Foxborough, near Gillette Stadium. From there, the Neponset meanders generally northeast for about to its mouth at Dorchester Bay between Quincy and the Dorchester section of Boston, near the painted gas tank.

The Neponset River forms the southern boundary of the city of Boston, passing through the neighborhoods of Readville, Hyde Park, Mattapan and Dorchester, and forms the northern border of the city of Quincy. In addition, the Neponset touches the towns of Foxborough, Walpole, Sharon, Norwood, Canton, Stoughton, Westwood, Dedham, and Milton.

The Neponset River is fed by a drainage basin of approximately 130 square miles, a watershed that includes numerous aquifers, wetlands, streams, and surrounding upland areas. Some 250,000 people live in the Neponset River watershed, which in addition to the towns listed above, includes portions of Stoughton, Medfield, Dover, and Randolph.

The Canton River, a tributary of the Neponset River, is located in Canton, Massachusetts. It flows under the Canton Viaduct.

== History ==

Before Europeans arrived, the area was inhabited by Algonquian-speaking Native American tribes. The &quot;Wamsutta site&quot; (19-NF-70) is a paleoindian site, which was dated to 10210 ± 60 BP). Evidence of habitation along the Neponset River also includes the Middle Archaic (ca. 5000 BC) at sites such as Green Hill near the Blue Hills.

The river&#x27;s recorded history begins in 1619 when Native Americans traveled down the Neponset River to Thompson&#x27;s Island, where they traded furs with English settlers.

The falling waters of the Neponset provided the energy for the country&#x27;s first water-powered grist mill, gunpowder mill, paper mill and the Revere Copper Company, among others.

The upper stretch of the Neponset River, in Foxborough, Walpole and Norwood, is steeply sloped, dropping about 228 feet (69 m) over its first 12 miles, (19 km) and so the earliest years of the Industrial Revolution brought the Neponset to prominence. In 1635, Israel Stoughton built the first dam on the Neponset (only the second dam in the entire New World) for his grist mill. It was the first of three mills for flour, gunpowder and paper making.

In 1639, English settlers in Dedham began digging a canal connecting the Charles River with Mother Brook, a tributary of the Neponset, in order to provide their town with water power for mills; it was the first man-made canal in North America and increased the water flow in the lower sections of the Neponset. In 1640, shipbuilding began at Gulliver&#x27;s Creek Wharf, and in 1673 John Trescott built a lumber mill on the river.

In 1765, a chocolate mill was established by Dr. James Baker and Irish immigrant John Hannon (later known as Walter Baker &amp; Company producing Baker&#x27;s Chocolate) in the Lower Mills section of Dorchester, and in 1770 Daniel Vose&#x27;s Wholesale Shipping Warehouses at the second Milton Town Landing at Lower Mills were at the peak of their operation. Ship building and commercial shipping were the major river industries at the estuary. In 1773, George Clark built a paper mill on remnants of Trescott&#x27;s Lumber Mill, which became the Tileston and Hollingsworth Paper Mill in 1836. In 1826, the river became the terminus of the Granite Railway, the first commercial railway in the United States. This river was central to the establishment of the town of Walpole. The river now flows through the Dorchester-Milton Lower Mills Industrial District.

The stretch of the Neponset from Milton to Dorchester Bay was referred to as Milton River on some early maps.

About of the river was placed in conduits during construction of the Foxboro Raceway and later Foxboro Stadium. During the construction of Gillette Stadium, the river was relocated to the edge of the property (adjacent to the Framingham Secondary) and daylit.

In 2021, the United States Environmental Protection Agency recommended 3.7 miles of the Lower Neponset River be added to the National Priorities List of the Superfund program, due to industrial pollution with PCBs. In March 2022, the EPA placed the segment between Mother Brook in Hyde Park to the Lower Mills on the National Priorities List.

==Neponset River Reservation==

Today the Neponset River and its watershed are increasingly being protected and opened up as a recreational destination for the benefit of local residents. Several recommendations of the 1966 Lower Neponset River Reservation Master Plan have been implemented, including the reclamation of the former Hallet Street landfill and the old Neponset Drive-In to provide the Pope John Paul II Park, which opened to the public in 2001. At Squantum Point in Quincy, phase one of Squantum Point Park, of a former U.S. Navy Airfield, was developed as waterfront parkland with assistance from National Grid plc and dedicated in the spring of 2001.

==In popular culture==
The Neponset River figures in the movie Black Mass, referencing an area south and east of the Keystone Shoreline in Dorchester, Massachusetts on the north bank, underneath the area where the Interstate 93 / Southeast Expressway / Route 1 bridge spans the river. A character in the movie makes reference to the area as &quot;Bulger&#x27;s Burial Ground&quot;, where crime boss James &quot;Whitey&quot; Bulger had the bodies of several of his murder victims buried. That unmarked burial ground really did exist, but in actuality was approximately one mile north of the area referenced in the film, near Tenean Beach in the Dorchester Shores Reservation.

 of the Lower Neponset River Trail opened in 2003. The trail follows the former right-of-way of the Dorchester and Milton Branch Railroad, the western part of which is also used by the MBTA Mattapan Line.

The Gillette Stadium Lighthouse is the largest lighthouse type structure in America. While the structure is located next to the Neponset River, the Gillette Stadium Lighthouse is not a real lighthouse because the Neponset River is not a federally controlled water way in Foxborough, as it is less than 2 miles wide. Gillette Stadium Lighthouse stands at 218 feet tall and 22 stories high.

<text>Robert Wartenberg (June 19, 1887 – November 16, 1956) was a clinical neurologist and professor.

Born in the then-Russian Empire, he attended university and established his career in Germany. As a Jew, he was fired from his position as the University of Freiburg&#x27;s Clinical Department of Neurology during the Nazi regime. He immigrated to the US, settling in San Francisco and teaching at the University of California in San Francisco.

He authored more than 150 papers and four books and made many significant discoveries in the area of clinical signs of neurological conditions. He continues to be commemorated by the American Academy of Neurology&#x27;s annual Robert Wartenberg Lecture and by many eponyms in the field of neurology.

== Early life and education ==
Wartenberg was born in 1887 in Grodno, Belarus, then in the Russian Empire.

He studied at the Universities of Kiel, Munich, and Freiburg eventually graduating magna cum laude from the University of Rostock, Germany in 1919. He worked with Max Nonne in Hamburg and Otfrid Foerster in Breslau.

Wartenberg became a Travelling Fellow of the Rockefeller Foundation from 1925 to 1926, visiting the U.S., U.K., and France. During this time, he worked for Harvey Cushing in Boston.

== Career ==

Following his graduation, Wartenberg worked for a series of German universities. In the early 1930s, he became head of the neurological clinic and professor in neurology and psychiatry at the University of Freiburg. As a Jew, Wartenberg was persecuted by the Nazi regime. He was removed from the position at the University of Freiburg&#x27;s Clinical Department of Neurology due to the Nazi Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service. Wartenberg left Nazi Germany as a refugee in 1935 or 1936.

He settled in San Francisco and began working for the University of California in 1936. He was made clinical professor of neurology in 1952 and eventually became head of the Neurology Department.

Over his career, Wartenberg authored more than 150 papers and four books. His first book, &quot;Examination of Reflexes,&quot; was translated into at least six languages. He submitted his final book to his publisher two hours before his death.

Wartenberg helped found the American Academy of Neurology, and served on the editorial boards of Confina Neurologica and The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease.

Among his colleagues, he was considered to be a harsh, detail-oriented reviewer of his peers&#x27; writing. One of his colleagues stated of him that &quot;The perfectionist drive led him at times into trouble, for he became notorious as a trenchant and hypercritical reviewer whose strictures often caused serious offence. This was quite an unfortunate trait, for his verbal violence was really quite at variance with his warm and generous personality.&quot; The same colleague described him as an excellent teacher, an opinion shared by Wartenberg&#x27;s students.

Wartenberg was an honorary member of neurological societies in Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, Brazil, and Argentina. He also helped found the American Academy of Neurology. During his career, he served on dozens of medical school academic search committees. He also sat of the editorial boards of Confina Neurologica and The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease.

The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease published a festschrift in honor of his 65th birthday titled &quot;Neurological Problems in the World of 1953,&quot; and the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) awards an annual Robert Wartenberg Lecture in Wartenberg&#x27;s honor. According to the According to the AAN&#x27;s website, &quot;The Robert Wartenberg Lecture Award is awarded to a neurologist for excellence in clinically relevant research.&quot;

==Discoveries==

Although Wartenberg participated in the early development of encephalography and myelography, he tended to favor clinical examinations and most of his accomplishments involved the identification new reflexes and signs that could be used to diagnose neurological problems from clinical examination of a patient. These included such signs as:

* A way to diagnose neurological diseases, including Parkinson&#x27;s disease, by observing how a patient swings their legs when seated on the examining table;
* The tendon palpation test, in which a lesion in a patient&#x27;s lower motor neurons can be detected from the softness of their Achilles tendon when standing;
* The lid vibration test, in which detects early signs of facial palsy (or the final signs near the end of recover from it) from eyelid movement; and
* The accessory nerve test in which damage to a nerve along the trapezius is revealed by examining whether the patient&#x27;s fingers hang lower on one side than the other when the patient is standing.

He was also the first person to identify Cheiralgia paresthetica, also known as handcuff neuropathy or as Wartenberg’s syndrome.

==Eponyms==

During his career, Wartenberg worked to replace eponymous neurological terms with more descriptive names. However, he is now commemorated with several eponyms. These include Wartenberg&#x27;s migratory sensory neuropathy, Wartenberg&#x27;s sign, Wartenberg’s syndrome, and the Wartenberg wheel. Wartenberg is sometimes incorrectly credited as the inventor of the Wartenberg wheel.. According to Wartenberg, this device, used to test skin sensitivity, was in widespread use in Europe when he lived in Germany. While he did not invent it, he found it &quot;an indispensable part of the outfit for everyday neurologic practice,&quot; and recommended its use to his colleagues in the US.

==Personal life==

Wartenberg was born June 19, 1887.

In 1929, he married Baroness Isabelle von Sazenhofen. After establishing his career in Germany, he left due to persecution by the Nazi regime and reestablished his career in San Francisco, California, USA.

He eventually retired in 1954, to the status of emeritus professor of neurology.

Following a period of poor health in his final years, Wartenberg died of a &quot;heart ailment&quot; at Herbert C. Moffitt Hospital on Nov. 16, 1956 at age 69. He was survived by his wife and his father-in-law, Baron Karl von Sazenhofen, with whom he lived.

<doc id="771083" wikidata="Q338133" url="?curid=771083" title="Siege (band)">
<text>Siege was an American hardcore punk band from Weymouth, Massachusetts. Formed in 1981, they were active in the Boston hardcore scene from 1984 to 1985, and reunited briefly in 1991. Drummer Rob Williams and guitarist Kurt Habelt led a live ensemble of reunion performances between 2016 and 2023.

In its original incarnation, Siege paired extremely fast tempos with vocalist Kevin Mahoney&#x27;s screeches and growls in their intense style of hardcore. Though little known at the time, the band has posthumously become revered by punk and heavy metal fans worldwide and is now regarded as one of the pioneers of the grindcore and powerviolence subgenres.

==History==
===Formation, early years (1981–1984)===
Then teenagers, the members of what would become Siege began playing together in 1981 in Weymouth. Guitarist Kurt Habelt, bassist Hank McNamee, and drummer Rob Williams rehearsed together informally during this time. They completed Siege&#x27;s classic lineup in 1983, recruiting vocalist and occasional saxophonist Kevin Mahoney from nearby Braintree.

Self-described as a &quot;second wave&quot; punk band, they cited hardcore punk and new wave of British heavy metal bands, as well as the desire to play faster than their predecessors, as formative influences on their sound. Siege&#x27;s first official show was at a Battle of the Bands in early 1984 at Weymouth North High School. They were disqualified for obscenities and McNamee&#x27;s smashing of his bass onstage.

===Radiobeat sessions, breakup (1984–1985)===
Siege recorded a six-song demo tape at Radiobeat Records in Kenmore Square on February 6, 1984. The demo was produced by Lou Giordano, the producer of records by Hüsker Dü, Negative FX, SS Decontrol, Goo Goo Dolls, and many others. It would later be extensively bootlegged. In October 1984 the band recorded three more songs at Radiobeat with Giordano for Pushead&#x27;s classic 1985 hardcore compilation &quot;Cleanse the Bacteria&quot;. Those 3 songs were Siege&#x27;s only official original release.

Giordano later recalled those sessions:

&lt;poem&gt;The way our studio operated was that anything that comes in – there&#x27;s no value judgments made about the music. We just record it. Still, one of the things that I guess was cool about being a staff engineer is that I wouldn&#x27;t have sought out a band like that. I wasn&#x27;t philosophically into anything that they were doing, but they were all good musicians – you would have to be to stay together at the speeds they were playing at. So there was that aspect of it, and just the whole pushing the envelope thing. It sounds like it&#x27;s just gonna completely break apart going 700 miles through the sky and then all of a sudden everything just comes right together again.

And they were some of the most unassuming, laid-back people to ever work with. I mean, they had no attitude at all. They just came in and they were just really polite and very thankful, and then when they turned on the amps and made that noise, it was just unbelievable that it was coming from them.&lt;/poem&gt;

Despite their proximity to Boston, Siege did not fit into Boston&#x27;s crew-dominated straight edge hardcore scene, and performed most of their gigs farther away in Western Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. They played in Greenfield with local hardcore bands DYS, Cancerous Growth, The Freeze, B.I.U, Outpatients, and Deep Wound, out of state at the Living Room in Providence, and at Anthrax in Stamford.

In 1985, Siege was scheduled to play their first show in New York City at CBGB with The Necros. Mahoney did not show up for the gig, and Siege disbanded shortly thereafter.

===Reunion (1991–1992)===

Siege reformed briefly in 1991 with Anal Cunt vocalist Seth Putnam replacing Mahoney. They recorded a four-song demo that was believed to be lost due to the master reel being damaged. McNamee left the band after their first show in April of 1992 and was replaced by Alex Smith, and they played one show with the bands Sloppy Seconds and Toe Tag before disbanding in August 1992. Williams later called the 1990s lineup a &quot;false-start&quot; reunion.

===Post-breakup and legacy===
Despite writing a mere 20 minutes of music and never playing outside of New England, Siege became highly influential. Their tracks on &quot;Cleanse the Bacteria&quot; exposed them to wide audiences, including Lars Ulrich of Metallica, who described them as the fastest band he had ever heard. Numerous pioneering bands establishing the death metal and grindcore subgenres in the 1980s cited Siege as a formative influence, including British groups Carcass and Napalm Death. Their demo became a highly sought-after bootleg in collector circuits.
Relapse Records officially released Siege&#x27;s demo and compilation tracks in 1994 as the &quot;Drop Dead&quot; CD. The same material was released on 12-inch vinyl in 2004 by Deep Six Records. Two separate additional reissues of the original Siege material issued on LP in 2006 and 2009 by the Deep Six label contained an additional three tracks, &quot;Two-Faced&quot;, &quot;Trained To Kill&quot;, and &quot;Questions Behind The Wall&quot;, recorded during Radiobeat sessions.

The 1991 recording was unreleased for many years. The track &quot;Cameras&quot; was eventually issued on the &quot;13 Bands Who Think You&#x27;re Gay&quot; compilation LP released by Putnam in 2004. The additional three tracks—&quot;Death &amp; Taxes&quot;, &quot;New World Order&quot; and &quot;Disregard&quot;—were thought to be lost before being rediscovered on cassette in 2014. The four songs were released on PATAC Records as the &quot;Lost Session &#x27;91&quot; 7-inch later that year.

Williams remained musically active and formed the band Nightstick, which additionally featured Putnam and Habelt at times. Williams and Mahoney also played together in The Spoils, who released the &quot;...To the Victor&quot; LP in 2007. Putnam died of a suspected heart attack on July 11, 2011, while Mahoney died on October 14 that year after an extended battle with diabetes.

Williams occasionally performed Siege material live with the Providence band Dropdead, including at Mayland Death Fest in 2014. A performance in Cambridge, Massachusetts in February 2015 was billed as their final live collaboration.

===Live performances (2016–2023)===
In 2016, Williams and Habelt gathered an ensemble of musicians to play Siege&#x27;s classic material live. This live group was completed by vocalist Mark Fields, second guitarist/bassist Chris Leamy (bandleader of Brian Famine, and a member of Japanese Torture Comedy Hour with Pig Destroyer guitarist Scott Hull), and Ben Barnett from Dropdead. They played their first show in Providence with headliners Infest. Further performances included guest saxophone players, including John Zorn, Ernie Kim, &quot;Party&quot; Marty Phillips and John “Westy” Weston. The band played a show at the Midway Cafe in Boston mid-September 2022, prior to playing the London hardcore festival Chimpyfest. They gave their final performances in New York and Los Angeles in 2023.

<doc id="771084" wikidata="Q1778502" url="?curid=771084" title="USS Nebraska (SSBN-739)">
<text>USS &quot;Nebraska&quot; (SSBN-739) is the 14th ballistic missile submarine, and the second United States Navy vessel to be named in honor of Nebraska, the 37th state. She carries Trident ballistic missiles.

&quot;Nebraska&quot; shares her nickname, &quot;Big Red&quot;, with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln&#x27;s athletic teams.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Nebraska&quot; was awarded on 26 May 1987 to the Electric Boat Division of the General Dynamics Corporation at Groton, Connecticut. Her keel was laid there on 6 July 1987 and she was launched on 15 August 1992, sponsored by Patricia Exon, the wife of United States Senator J. James Exon (1921–2005) of Nebraska. &quot;Nebraska&quot; was delivered to the U.S. Navy on 18 June 1993 and commissioned on 10 July 1993.

==Service history==
&quot;Nebraska&quot; was originally assigned to Submarine Group 10 at Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Georgia. On 1 October 2004, &quot;Nebraska&quot; was transferred to Submarine Squadron 17 in Submarine Group 9 at Naval Base Kitsap, Bangor, Washington. In 2013 Nebraska transferred to Submarine Squadron 19 to conduct an Engineering Refueling Overhaul.

The sub has successfully launched Trident missiles for testing six times, once in 1993, in 2004, in 2008, in 2011 in 2018, and in 2019.

As of November 2013, the submarine had completed 62 deterrent patrols during her 20 years of service. Each patrol is usually 77 days in duration followed by 35 days in port for maintenance.

Following Patrol 54, &quot;Nebraska&quot; was awarded the &quot;Battle E&quot; for Submarine Squadron 17. Additionally, following Patrol 56, the submarine was awarded the &quot;Battle E&quot; for Submarine Squadron 17 for its second consecutive year. After completing an unprecedented 116-day patrol in late 2013, &quot;Nebraska&quot; was again awarded the &quot;Battle E,&quot; her third in four years.

==In popular culture==
In the military hard science fiction &quot;Looking Glass&quot; series by John Ringo and Travis S. Taylor, &quot;Nebraska&quot; is converted into the first human interstellar spaceship and renamed &quot;Vorpal Blade&quot;. The boat is the main setting for the majority of the second, third, and fourth books in the series, &quot;Vorpal Blade,&quot; &quot;Manxome Foe,&quot; and &quot;Claws That Catch&quot;.

<text>The 4th Ring Road () is a controlled-access expressway ring road in Beijing, China which runs around the city, with a radius of approximately from city centre. The total length of the road is . There are 147 bridges and viaducts that run the length of the Ring Road.

The first section, the northern corridor, was completed in preparation for the 1990 Asian Games. The Ring Road was &#x27;enclosed&#x27; in a full circle in June 2001, with standard controlled-access expressway throughout.

== Route ==
The 4th Ring Road is entirely within the city limit of Beijing, and while it is called a ring, the road is shaped rectangularly.

The route travels past: Siyuan Bridge - Chaoyang Park Area - Sihui - Sifang Bridge - Shibalidian - Dahongmen - Majialou - Yuegezhuang Bridge - Fengtai Area - Sijiqing Area - Zhongguancun Area - Jianxiang - Asian Games Village Area - Wanghe Bridge - Siyuan Bridge

== History ==
In the early 1990s, the northern stretch of the 4th Ring Road from Zhongguancun to Siyuan Bridge existed as a ring road, albeit with far narrower road conditions and with traffic lights. Only three flyover viaducts—those at Jianxiang Bridge, Anhui Bridge and Siyuan Bridge—existed.

To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the eastern stretch of the 4th Ring Road was opened from Siyuan Bridge to Shibalidian around October 1, 1999. This was the first part of the ring road to be opened as an 8-lane expressway (4 lanes per direction, not including an emergency belt).

The northern part of the 4th Ring Road from Jianxiang Bridge to Siyuan Bridge was converted to an 8-lane expressway in late September 2000. Later that year, the southern part from Shibalidian through to Fengtai opened to traffic, as was the case with the northwestern part.

By June 2001, the entire 4th Ring Road had been converted into an expressway-standard thoroughfare.

In early 2004, the speed limit was reduced to a unified 80 km/h (minimum speed limit: 50 km/h).

In September 2004, the 4th Ring Road underwent a massive sign change. Exit numberings were unified at last—bidirectionally (this was previously not the case).

A new overpass in the northern stretch was put into operation in October 2004, near the Beichen area.

== Road conditions ==

=== Speed limit ===
Previously: first lane, min. 80 km/h, max. 100 km/h; second lane, min. 70 km/h, max. 90 km/h; third lane, min. 60 km/h, max. 80 km/h; fourth lane, min. 50 km/h, max. 80 km/h; auxiliary road, uniform max. speed limit of 70 km/h. Readjusted in 2004 so that all lanes have a uniform min. speed limit of 50 km/h and a max. speed limit of 80 km/h; aux. road max. speed limit of 70 km/h remains unchanged.

=== Tolls ===
This express road does not charge tolls.

=== Lanes ===
8 lanes (4 in each direction) throughout.

=== Traffic conditions ===

The portion from Jianxiang to Siyuan Bridge, in both directions, is especially vulnerable to horrible traffic jams. The remainder of the northern and eastern portions are also vulnerable. Apart from the Fengtai area, the remainder of the 4th Ring Road has a lesser risk of being clogged up by traffic jams.

== Major exits ==
Siyuan Bridge, Sihui, Sifang Bridge, Shibalidian, Majialou, Fengtai, Yuegezhuang, Zhongguancun, Jianxiang Bridge, Wanghe Bridge.

== Service areas ==
No full-scale service areas exist; however, filling stations (gas stations) are plentiful in number.

== Connections ==
Badaling Expressway: Connects to the Badaling Expressway at Jianxiang Bridge.

Jingcheng Expressway: Connects to the Jingcheng Expressway at Wanghe Bridge (for the time being, only heading for Laiguangying and Chengde).

Airport Expressway: Connects to the Airport Expressway at Siyuan Bridge (only heading for the airport).

Projected Jingping Expressway: Would most likely connect at Dongfeng North Bridge.

Jingtong Expressway: Connects to the Jingtong Expressway at Sihui.

Jingshen Expressway: Connects to the Jingshen Expressway at Sifang Bridge (only heading for Shenyang).

Jingjintang Expressway: Connects to the Jingjintang Expressway at Shibalidian.

Jingkai Expressway: Connects to the Jingkai Expressway at Majialou.

Jingshi Expressway: Connects to the Jingshi Expressway at Yuegezhuang.

== Signs ==
When it was opened by 2001, the 4th Ring Road&#x27;s signs were plagued by inconsistency. Mixing of Hanyu Pinyin and English on the signs confused drivers, but what was most confusing was the exit numbering. It so happened that the &quot;same exit&quot; had &quot;two different exit numbers&quot;—one for each direction of the ring road.

Beijing authorities had three years&#x27; lapse before they dealt with the problem. Old signs were progressively replaced by newer signs which had standardised English and, finally, a new exit numbering system was in place. A sketch map of each exit, formerly only for expressways and isolated spots, was also introduced along with the new sign numbering.

Another change was the use of traffic sign language to signal traffic regulations instead of relying completely on Chinese Hanzi. Some bridge names (e.g. Sihe Bridge) are also getting a name change at the same time.

The project was somewhat Herculean since 441 signs were to be replaced. Of those, exit and entrance signs formed 202 signs; other, mainly larger-sized signs, formed the remaining 239 signs. Earlier in the summer of 2004, similar measures for the 5th Ring Road (which had an absent-to-chaotic exit numbering system) were announced.

In a show of speed, within the first 100 hours, new exit numberings were put up for almost all of the western stretch of the 4th Ring Road (despite new/old signs being alternated on a different stretch of the ring road).

Reaction to the new signs are mixed. There is a definitive plus side: the exits are now matched with their equivalent exit/bridge names on the 3rd and 5th ring roads. Unfortunately, many complain of an information overkill. Signs are now complex enough to hold five &quot;different&quot; directions (on some bridges). Meanwhile, the mixing of lowercase and uppercase English in small font sizes is another concern.

On both the 4th Ring Road and the 5th Ring Road, some speed cameras were put into place, along with the general sign changes.
