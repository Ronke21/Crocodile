<text>São José dos Campos (, meaning Saint Joseph of the Fields) is a major city and the seat of the municipality of the same name in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. One of the leading industrial and research centers with emphasis in aerospace sciences in Latin America, the city is located in the Paraíba Valley, between the two most active production and consumption regions in the country; São Paulo ( from the city) and Rio de Janeiro (). It is the main city of the Metropolitan Region of Vale do Paraíba e Litoral Norte. A native of São José dos Campos is called a &quot;joseense&quot; (). Being the second most populous non-capital city in Brazil – behind Campinas – São José dos Campos lies in the middle of the Expanded Metropolitan Complex (&quot;Complexo Metropolitano Expandido&quot;), the first megalopolis in the Southern Hemisphere, with over thirty million inhabitants. The city&#x27;s metro area also includes Greater São Paulo, Campinas, Santos and Sorocaba.
The municipality concentrates many major companies and industries, such as Embraer, Panasonic, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Ericsson, Philips, General Motors, Petrobras, Monsanto among others. São José dos Campos also holds relevant education and research institutions, as ITA, INPE, CEMADEN, IEAv, , , UNESP, UNIFESP, DCTA, FATEC, UNIVAP and IP%D, holding a position the puts the city as the main and largest Aerospacial Complex in Latin America. Thus, it is also considered the warlike producer centre. The Technological Park (&quot;Parque Tecnológico de São José dos Campos&quot;), the largest one in the country, is the only research institute in the world that converges all the three top global plane production companies, Embraer, Boeing and Airbus.

=== Metropolitan Area ===
The intense conurbation process has been creating a metropolis whose center city is São José dos Campos, reaching many other municipalities like Jacareí, Taubaté, Aparecida, Caçapava, Guaratinguetá, Campos do Jordão, Caraguatatuba, Pindamonhangaba and Lorena. The Paraíba Valley metropolitan area is currently made up of 39 cities, comprehending 2 453 387 inhabitants. 
The metro area is part of the Expanded Metropolitan Complex, being a megalopolis that connects São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, encompassing São José dos Campos and Campinas with over 30 million inhabitants as a total number.

=== Cityscape ===

The municipality comprises three districts: São José dos Campos — the city itself, (also the seat), Eugênio de Melo and São Francisco Xavier. The last one is known for its natural sites and ecotourism.

The district of São José dos Campos is also subdivided into 2 subdistricts (São José dos Campos and Santana do Paraíba).

However, for administrative purposes, the city is composed of 7 urban regions: Center, North, South, West, East, Southeast and São Francisco Xavier.

=== Topography ===
Highlands predominate in the northern region of the municipality with altitudes ranging from . The northern border of the municipality lies over the Serra da Mantiqueira Mountains (&quot;Mantiqueira Range&quot;), with some peaks reaching over 2000 meters (6500 ft.). The highest point in the municipality is known as &#x27;Pico do Selado&#x27; at an altitude of 2082 meters.

In the urban area, there are rolling plateaus and hills.
The lowest elevation in the city (and also in the municipality) is found in the &quot;Paraíba do Sul&quot; River, at a mean elevation of 550 m.

The municipality is bounded at the south by the &#x27;Serra do Jambeiro&#x27; mountains, with an elevation of about 900m. Due to the high topographic differences among neighborhoods and the urbanization, the city now experiences micro-climates present in distant areas. The downtown tends to concentrate frequent urban heat islands, while the suburb areas get noticeably colder main temperatures. As the northern part of the city, mainly the district of Sao Francisco Xavier, mescles high attitudes and ecologically preserved areas the climate is better classified as Humid Subtropical Climate (&quot;Cwb&quot;).

The municipality holds the São Francisco Xavier Environmental Protection Area, established in 2002.
It contains part of the Mananciais do Rio Paraíba do Sul Environmental Protection Area, created in 1982 to protect the sources of the Paraiba do Sul River.

=== Climate ===

The climate of the city can be, perhaps, best described as a mix between the subtropical climate of southern parts of the country, the tropical climate of most of the country and the subtropical highland climate (in Portuguese: clima tropical de altitude) of neighbouring mountainous regions.

Technically, the city has a humid subtropical climate with significant less precipitation during winters (transitioning between &quot;Cfa&quot; and &quot;Cwa&quot; climatic types in the Köppen classification). Winters are very mild, with average temperature in the coldest month near 17 °C. Summers are not excessively hot, with average temperature of the hottest month of 24 °C.
Frosts are very rare, happening on average once per decade. However, fogs are pretty usual, occurring mostly during the winters. 
The peaks at the northern border of the municipality (some over 2000 m high) due to altitude have colder Cwb/Cfb climates, with very occasional snowfalls.

With global warming it is very likely that the city&#x27;s climate will transition in the near future (or has already transitioned) to a true tropical climate (type &#x27;Aw&#x27; in the Köppen climate classification).

== History ==
The origins of São José dos Campos lie at the end of the 16th Century when Jesuits founded a cattle farm, &quot;Aldeia do Rio Comprido&quot;. The farm was created through a concession of settlements around 1590 to the Society of Jesus. The farm was located on the banks of the Rio Comprido, natural division between São José and the city of Jacareí today.

The farm status was an artifice to hide a religious outpost, one of the several Jesuit Reductions in Brazil, known for their resistance to enslavement, from the Portuguese expedition leaders and indigenous people hunters, known as the Bandeirantes.

On September 10, 1611, the local was officially recognized and the farmers precluded from utilizing the Natives as slaves. However, a turmeric conflict between farmers and the religious led to the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1640 from the region and the consequent dispersion of the mission.

Nevertheless, the Jesuits returned and reestablished a new settlement, where the current city center is spotted. It was about northeast of the previous mission, on a higher plain with a privileged view above a geological depression, which guaranteed security against invasions and floods. Again, despite being a new mission, it was officially treated as a cattle farm.

The initial urbanization plan is attributed to the Jesuit priest Manoel de Leão, whose main occupation was really to be an administrator of the community.

In 1692, documents named the village as &quot;Residência do Paraíba do Sul&quot;; in 1696 as &quot;Residência de São José&quot;.

At the beginning of the gold mining economic cycle in Brazil, the settlement goes through serious difficulties due to the exit of labor to the mines.

After the definitive expulsion of Jesuits from the Portuguese Empire in 1759, all the religious order&#x27;s assets, such as farms, colleges and villages were taken under the Portuguese Crown&#x27;s custody. The governor, D. Luis Antonio Botelho Mourão, had as a priority to turn these new assets into productive units and increase tax collection. For that, Boutelho Mourão successfully requested authorization from the Viceroy to create civil parishes, known as &quot;freguesias&quot;, and to change the fiscal status of villages to the category of Vila (town).

Then, on July 27, 1767, São José reached the official status of town, with a hall and a pillory, passing over the status of civil parish; and the name Vila de São José do Paraíba was formalized. But for many years it maintained the same rural characteristics. The main difficulty was the fact that the &quot;Estrada Real&quot; (Royal Road) passed by its limits, far from the village.

=== Cotton and coffee ===
In the middle of the 19th century, the village of São José do Paraíba had demonstrated some signs of economic growth through the development of agriculture. Cotton production evolved rapidly in the region, exported to the English textile industry. The production reached a peak in 1864.

In the same year, on April 22, the town became the seat of a municipality, acquiring finally, in 1871, the current name of São José dos Campos, followed by the creation of a judiciary district in 1872. Almost simultaneously, there was development of coffee crops in Paraíba Valley, which started to take off in 1870.

In 1886, after the opening of the Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil railway (1877), the coffee production peaked. Then started to decay, running steady until the 1930s.

=== Hydro-mineral retreat and industrialization ===
The call for the municipality of São José dos Campos for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis by sanatoriums became noticed at the beginning of last century, due to its supposedly favorable climate conditions. The city became known as &quot;the Sanatorium City&quot;. The country&#x27;s then-largest hospital, the Vicentina Aranha Sanitarium, was opened in town in 1924, and in 1935 the municipality was officially recognized as a health retreat.

With the advent of antibiotics in the 1940s, tuberculosis begins to be treated anywhere, thus ending the healthcare advantage carried out by São José, whereas the establishment of industries was about just to start.

The industrialization process of the municipality takes hold from the installation of the &quot;Technological Institute of Aeronautics &quot; in 1950 and also with the opening of the Dutra Highway (BR-116), thus making possible a faster connection between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo and cutting into the urban area of São José dos Campos. Altogether, these factors allowed the municipality to make strides towards fulfilling its scientific and technological potential.

== Government ==
São José dos Campos has a &quot;strong mayoral&quot; system in which the mayor is vested with extensive executive powers, as it is in all municipalities in Brazil. The mayor is elected to a four-year term by universal voting. The City Council is elected every four years with the mayor.

=== Transportation ===

The city has two bus stations, having lines to cities in all regions of the country and international routes to Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Chile.

São José dos Campos boasts an extensive bus system. Operated by three companies (Expresso Maringa, Julio Simões and Viação Capital do Vale), these lines serve nearly all areas in the city with 319 buses. São José dos Campos also has an alternative system with minivans to supplement the regular buses.

The city uses a ring road system, that interconnects it to important national and state highways:

*BR-116 (federal highway), which crosses the urban area of São José. It runs in a north–south direction in the country, near but not on Brazil&#x27;s coastline. The section that connects Rio de Janeiro to São Paulo is known as Presidente Dutra. It is widely used inside the urban area of São José dos Campos for commuting purposes;
*SP-070 (state highway) also known as Rodovia Carvalho Pinto which connects São Paulo to Taubaté;
*SP-065 Connects São Jose dos Campos to Campinas
*SP-099 (state highway) also known as Rodovia dos Tamoios which connects São José to the coastal lowlands of the city of Caraguatatuba;

*SP-050 (state highway) – the old road which connects São José dos Campos to Campos do Jordão and the southern region of Minas Gerais.

The city is also served by a railway (the former Central do Brasil), administered by MRS Logística, which today only carries freight.

The ports of São Sebastião and Santos can be reached by the highways SP-099, SP-155, and BR-101. The transportation of cargo to the domestic and foreign markets is made through both ports.

The São José dos Campos Airport (IATA: SJK, ICAO: SBSJ) has a heavy passenger flow, mainly business trips during weekdays, and it is an important connection between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. With a runway, the airport also serves people who come to visit the tourist city of Campos de Jordão. The airlines Azul Brazilian Airlines and TRIP Linhas Aéreas fly from São José dos Campos to several destinations and presently are the only commercial airlines operating on São José dos Campos.

It is also used for the transportation of cargo from the several industries located in the so-called Cone Leste Paulista (&quot;São Paulo&#x27;s East Cone&quot;). Infraero and the Federal Revenue Agency are also introducing a new concept called airport-industry, that will offer fiscal incentives and fast importation and exportation procedures. The municipality has also a Customs Station for the Hinterland (dry port), controlled by the Federal Revenue Agency.

São José dos Campos receives natural gas from two gas pipelines, and large companies such as General Motors, Kodak, Monsanto and Embraer are among the main users. The city is the third largest in the country referring to the distribution net of natural gas for residential use. 

=== Communication ===
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica Brasileira until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

It has also a large network of fiber optics, with broadband services covering 75% of the city. There is 1 telephone for each 3 inhabitants and a vast service network of cellular telephones. 

== Economy ==
=== Agriculture ===
The municipality cultivates different crops: rice, tomato, potatoes, orange and many vegetables; cattle are raised for beef and milk supply. There are also farms for production of eggs and chicken. 

=== Industry ===
In contrast to the rural town in 1950s, today São José is an important manufacturing center and holds a large array of industries. Over 1,251 industries are in the municipality and nearby 49,000 inhabitants work for industries. The three main industries are automotive, oil/petrochemical and aerospace. There are significant pharmaceutical, consumer durables, chemical, and telecommunication companies in the city.

It is also known as the &quot;Brazilian aeronautics capital&quot; because it is home of CTA and one of the biggest aircraft manufacturers in the world, Embraer.

===International trade===
In 2014 São José dos Campos ranked as the 5th largest exporter, by value, of all Brazilian municipalities exporting $4.6B (USD) worth of materials. In that year, between aircraft and aircraft parts categories, São José Dos Campos exported $3.57B (USD) or 81.9% of the total exports of the municipality.

=== Service industry ===

Since the 1990s, the local economy has been evolving in a different direction. The manufacturing economy has been downsized or replaced by tertiary and quaternary sectors of industries.

For instance, the Entrepreneurial District of Chacaras Reunidas concentrates companies of micro, small and medium size, which are mainly the result of downsizing from old large local industries. Although most of these are industries, these companies provide service as well.

Two technological parks and five (one in project) business incubators have been created within universities or with industrial facilities.

There are incubators with technological start-up companies installed at Univap and at Henrique Lage Refinery of Petrobrás. The CTA houses other incubator, Incubaero, specialized in the aeronautical field.

Univap features a technological park with capacity for around 40 small to medium-sized innovating companies in the areas of materials, electronics and telecommunications, information technology, aerospace, energy, environment control, biotechnology, bioinformatics, chemical engineering, and software among others. A new technological park, managed by the municipality and the state government of São Paulo, will house two new think tanks: the Institute for Technological Research (IPT) and the ItecBio (Instituto de Tecnologias Biomédicas).

As a result of its geographical location, the city became an important distribution center, having several logistics providers. Activities like purchasing, transport, planning and warehousing have employed many people recently.

Commerce and real estate ventures have developed in the last years, reflecting the changes in the economy. For instance, the largest shopping mall in the region was an old manufacturing facility. Serving the region&#x27;s population of approximately one million, the city is the regional hub for shopping and services for the Vale do Paraíba, the northern coast of São Paulo and southern Minas Gerais.

<text>Pekanbaru is the capital city of the Indonesian province of Riau, and a major economic center on the eastern side of Sumatra Island with its name derived from the Malay (Indonesian) word for &#x27;new market&#x27; (&#x27;pekan&#x27; is market and &#x27;baru&#x27; is new).
It has an area of , with a population of 897,767 at the 2010 Census, and 983,356 at the 2020 Census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 1,123,348 (comprising 564,628 males and 558,720 females). It is located on the banks of the Siak River, which flows into the Strait of Malacca, Pekanbaru has direct access to the busy strait and has long been known as a trading port.

A settlement has existed on the site since the 17th century. In the late 19th century, the city was developed to serve the coffee and coal industries, and the Dutch built roads to help ship goods to Singapore and Malacca. This city has an airport called Sultan Syarif Kasim II International Airport, and a port called Sungai Duku that is located by the Siak River.

==Etymology==
The words &quot;pekan&quot; (market) and &quot;baru&quot; (new) in the Malay for &quot;new market&quot; are the source of the names Pekanbaru and Pekan Baru. Pekanbaru is used to be known as &quot;new market&quot; because back then Pekanbaru was a huge market which is known among the surrounding areas. It was formerly known as &quot;Senapelan&quot;, which comes from the word &quot;Sena&quot;, a tree that symbolises the region. Batin was the tribe chief at the time. In which around this time, this area transforms into Dusun Payung Sekaki, which is situated near the mouth of the Siak River, as it continues to grow into a new urban residential area.

According to the records kept by Imam Suhil Siak, Sultan Muhammad Ali Abdul Jalil Muazamsyah under the rule of Sultan Yahya officially established Senapelan on the 21st of Rajab, Tuesday, in the year 1204 H, corresponding to the 23rd of June 1784 AD, which was later set as the day of Pekanbaru City. Senapelan was later more commonly known as Pekanbaru.

==History==
On 14 December 1745, the Siak region was ceded by the Sultan of Johor Sulaiman Badrul Alam Shah from the Johor Sultanate to the Dutch East India Company (VOC) under the terms of a treaty in return for Dutch help against the enemies of Johor. Siak was put under Dutch administration. The Sultan moved residence to a palace in Senapelan built in 1760.

The origin of Pekanbaru was inseparable from the existence of the Siak River as a distributing route for commodities from the Minangkabau Highlands to the Strait of Malacca. During the 18th century, the Senapelan region on the banks of the Siak River became a market for the Minangkabau merchants. Over time, the area evolved into a crowded residential area. On June 23, 1784, based on the consultative meeting of the Council of Ministers from Sultanate of Siak Sri Indrapura, consisting of four tribal leaders (&quot;datuk&quot;) of Minangkabau tribes (Pesisir, Lima Puluah, Tanah Datar and Kampar), the area was named Pekanbaru. This date was later celebrated as the anniversary of this city.

At Senapelan Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah Alamudin unsuccessfully tried to organize a major regional fair but in the early 1780s his son Sultan Muhammad Ali managed to establish the grand fair.

===Dutch East Indies===
Following the collapse of the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC), all company ownership of Pekanbaru was transferred to the Dutch crown. During the colonial Dutch East Indies era in the 19th and early 20th century the city remained important, especially as a major trading point: Siak river navigation conditions provide a stable relationship with shipping from the Malacca Strait. Additionally the city became a major center of the coffee industry and coal industry. The urban influence of the sultans gradually became increasingly nominal, especially after the capital of the Sultanate moved to Sri Indrapura in 1830. Actual management functions were carried out by representatives of the Dutch colonial administration, i.e., by the post of assistant-resident and controller.

===Second World War===
During the Second World War from February 1942 to August 1945 the city was occupied by the armed forces of Japan. In an effort to strengthen the military and logistical infrastructure in this part of Sumatra, the Japanese started the construction of a 220-kilometer-long railway, connecting Pekanbaru to the coast of Malacca Straits.

The Pekanbaru Railway was constructed under harsh conditions using forced labour. 6,500 Dutch, mostly Indo-Europeans, and British prisoners of war and over 100,000 Indonesian, mostly Javanese, forced workers called &quot;Romusha&quot; were put to work by the Japanese army. By the time the work was completed in August 1945 almost a third of the European POWs and over half of the Indonesian coolies had died.

George Duffy, one of the 15 Americans there and survivor of the sinking of the , noted that malaria, dysentery, pellagra, and malnutrition/beri-beri were the principal maladies compounded by overwork and mistreatment. The average age at death of the 700 prisoners of war who perished on that railway was 37 years and 3 months.

The railway was never fully utilised. Today it remains unused and in an advanced state of decay.

===Indonesian era===
After Indonesian independence, Pekanbaru was organized as an administrative city in 1956, and was selected to be the capital of the newly formed Riau province in 1959.

==Politics==
Since 1946, Pekanbaru has been governed by at least 15 mayors. The first mayor to rule this city was Datuk Wan Abdul Rahman who was elected on 17 May 1946. Currently, the Mayor of Pekanbaru is Zulham Hakim.

==Reputation==
Pekanbaru is one of the cleanest big cities in Indonesia. In 2011, Pekanbaru received the &quot;Adipura&quot; (&#x27;cleanest city&#x27;) award in the category of large city for the seventh consecutive time.

==Demographics==

===Ethnicities===

Pekanbaru is the third most populous city on Sumatra Island after Medan and Palembang, with a population of 983,356 according to the official Census for 2020; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 1,123,348. The city is highly urbanised, drawing many of its people from the neighbouring province of West Sumatra. Since many centuries ago, Pekanbaru is one of the Minangkabau migration areas outside of their home province of West Sumatra and also within Sumatra island as a whole. After World War II, the number of Minangkabau people migrating to Pekanbaru surged, nearly doubling between the years 1943 and 1961. Many Minangkabau in Pekanbaru have lived there for generations and has since assimilated into the Malay community. In addition to the Minangkabau, the Riau Malays are the second largest ethnic group in Pekanbaru, making up 30% of the population. The Javanese, Batak and Tionghoa (mostly from the Hainanese dialect group, with minorities coming from the Hokkien and the Cantonese dialect group) are the other main ethnic groups inhabiting Pekanbaru city.

===Religions===

The pluralism surrounding the city can be reflected by the variety of religions and freedom of belief among the people in Pekanbaru. Islam is the majority religion in this city, followed by Christianity (Protestantism and Catholic) as well as Buddhism and small percentage of Hinduism and Confucianism. Each religion in this city is represented by the presence of the religion&#x27;s respective worship places, such as An-Nur Great Mosque and Pekanbaru Central Mosque (&quot;Masjid Raya Pekanbaru&quot;) for the Muslim community, St. Maria A Fatima Church and St. Paulus Church for the Catholic community, Huria Kristen Batak Protestan Church for the Protestant community as well as Vihara Dhamma Metta Arama, Vihara Dharma Loka and Vihara Vimala Virya for the Buddhist community and Kwan Tee Kong Bio (Vihara Satya Dharma) and Vihara Sasana Loka for Confucianist community and Pura Agung Jagatnatha for the Hindu community in Pekanbaru.

===Languages===
Indonesian is the official language that is spoken by the citizens of Pekanbaru. For informal use, Pekanbaru people regardless of their ethnicity also generally use Minangkabau language in their economic and daily activities, especially in the market area. In addition the local Riau Malay language and Javanese are also widely spoken because of the large population of Malays and Javanese in Pekanbaru. Hainanese as well as Riau Hokkien and Cantonese is mainly spoken by the Tionghoa community as most of the Chinese Indonesians in Pekanbaru belong to the Hainanese and Hoklo dialect groups. In fact, a minority of Chinese Indonesians in Pekanbaru also come from other regions in (mainland) Riau such as Selat Panjang, Bengkalis and Siak, along with the Chinese Indonesians who are natives of Pekanbaru itself, are also mostly from the Hainanese dialect group. Moreover, many Chinese Indonesians especially from North Sumatra, particularly from Medan as well as West Sumatra region and to a lesser extent the Riau Islands have internally migrated to Pekanbaru due to opportunities and rapid economical growth in the area since the 1990s and 2000s, in which the dialect groups of these internal migrants are from the Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese and Hakka subgroups.

==Administrative districts==

The city is divided into fifteen administrative districts, formerly twelve (Indonesian: &quot;kecamatan&quot;), tabulated below with their areas since the 2021 re-organisation, and their populations at the 2020 Census and according to the official estimates for mid 2023. The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centres, the number of administrative villages in each district (all classed as urban &quot;kelurahan&quot;), and its post codes.

The precipitation accumulation also remains constant throughout the year with no real dry season. The month with most precipitation is November with precipitation total , while the least precipitation is July with precipitation total .
==Economy==
After oil was discovered in the region in the 1930s, Pekanbaru&#x27;s economy has depended heavily on oil revenues which caused the city to have the highest per capita income in Indonesia. Most of Indonesia&#x27;s petroleum is produced in Riau, and much of Pekanbaru&#x27;s economy is based on the petroleum industry. International oil companies, prominently Chevron from the US, as well as other Indonesian companies, have established their offices in the region. The city is connected by road to an oil refining and exporting port in Dumai. Many facilities and infrastructures such as an airport, stadiums, housing areas, schools, bridges that cross the Siak River in Pekanbaru, the roads in Rumbai and the roads to Dumai, were partially or fully financed by oil companies in the area.

Pekanbaru is really close with some of the home of mega-companies, such as PT Riau Andalan Pulp Paper, PT. Indah Kiat, PT. Chevron Pacific Indonesia, and PT Perkebunan Nusantara V and some wood-sawmill, CPOs, and rubber-processing companies, and Pekanbaru is often said to be one of the cities with the highest money and banking rotation in Indonesia.

As Pekanbaru is prominently known as a major gateway for tourists from Singapore and Malaysia, the city has become a favourite stop-over for travellers before they go further inland to other regions of Sumatra Island such as Padang and Jambi. The Pasar Pusat (Central Market) is a food-trip destination and considered a household-goods trove. Pasar Bawah and Pasar Tengah, located near to the port and Siak riverbank, are especially known for the marketplace for buying and selling of Chinese goods like ceramics and carpets.

Around 127,000 foreign tourists arrived in Pekanbaru through its airport during 2018.

On the other hand, there are many developments of shopping malls. Additionally, there are a lot of housing areas have been developed since the 2000s surrounding the city, particularly in &quot;Panam&quot; area whereby the housing project along the road has been tremendously established and now becoming one of the most populous area in Pekanbaru even though it is located far from downtown.

Favorably, there are several landmarks that have been built in this city. For example, The Great Mosque of An-nur, Mesjid Raya Pekanbaru, Pasar Bawah or &quot;Tourist Market&quot;, Riau Bank Tower, Riau Government Office Tower, Siak IV Bridge, Zapin Dance Monument and there are many more to come.

==Transportation==

There are several modes of transportation in Pekanbaru such as taxi, bus, oplet (share taxi), bajaj (auto rickshaw), ojek (motorcycle taxi) and Trans Metro Pekanbaru (bus rapid transit). However, due to the rapidly increasing number of motorised vehicles, the traffic congestion that occurs on some roads such as &quot;Jalan Sudirman&quot;, &quot;Jalan Riau&quot; and &quot;Jalan HR. Subrantas&quot; that mainly connect populous sub-districts in the city cannot be avoided any more particularly during weekends and holidays. These problems initiated the government of Pekanbaru to come up with plans to solve these matters, especially within 10 to 15 years ahead.

===Land===

For land transport, Pekanbaru is connected to Padang, Medan, Jambi, Palembang, and other cities or regions in Riau Province and Sumatra Island by the existence of Bandar Raya Payung Sekaki Bus Terminal. The terminal was officially open for public in 2007, replacing Pekanbaru&#x27;s former &quot;Mayang Terurai Terminal Bus&quot; due to heavy congestion. However, the Bandar Raya Payung Sekaki Bus Terminal is not fully utilised by several prominent bus companies such as &quot;Pelangi&quot;, &quot;Makmur&quot;, &quot;Riau Mandiri&quot; and &quot;Sidomulyo&quot; as well as other bus operators because its location which is deemed by some parties to be not as strategic as Mayang Terurai Bus Terminal. These matters surely make some bus companies have no choice but to drop off the passengers outside the designated zone. This informal drop-off zone is usually called by local people as &quot;terminal bayangan&quot; (&quot;shadow terminals&quot;).

===Rivers===
Port of Sungai Duku is located by the Siak River, connecting Pekanbaru with some regions in Riau Province and Riau Islands such as Siak, Tanjung Buton, Selat Panjang, Bengkalis and Batam. In the past, there were ferry services travelling from this port directly to Malacca in Malaysia, but the service was discontinued as several ferry companies decided to move their operations to Tanjung Buton.

===Air===

In 2012, the new terminal was opened, replacing the old terminal that had been used since the 1980s. The old terminal is planned to be demolished to build more spaces for the apron and more aircraft capacity. Even though the new terminal has been fully used, the aerobridges that were constructed have never been utilized as the apron expansion has not been completed yet after two years since the opening of the new terminal to the public in 2012. Thus, the airport company &quot;PT Angkasa Pura II&quot; is currently ferrying passengers to and from the terminal using shuttle buses until the aerobridge can be used.
Pekanbaru&#x27;s airport is also utilized separately as the airbase of the TNI-AU (Indonesian Air Force) and home base of the 12th Squadron, a shelter to some Hawk Mk.109s and Mk.209s. The airbase is named after the former head of Indonesian Air Force, &quot;Roesmin Nurjadin&quot; and formally called as &quot;Pangkalan Udara Roesmin Nurjadin&quot; or &quot;Roesmin Nurjadin Airbase&quot;.

Since then, many sport facilities have been built in Pekanbaru because this city was the home for many sports venues used these multi-national events, such as the prominent Riau Main Stadium. Unfortunately, many sports facilities that have been developed before the 2012 Pekan Olahraga Nasional are not being managed and taken care of properly.

<text>Sirmium was a city in the Roman province of Pannonia, located on the Sava river, on the site of modern Sremska Mitrovica in the Vojvodina autonomous province of Serbia. First mentioned in the 4th century BC and originally inhabited by Illyrians and Celts, it was conquered by the Romans in the 1st century BC and subsequently became the capital of the Roman province of Pannonia Inferior. In 293 AD, Sirmium was proclaimed one of the four capitals of the Roman Empire. It was also the capital of the Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum and of Pannonia Secunda. The site is protected as an archaeological Site of Exceptional Importance. The modern region of Syrmia (Srem or Srijem) was named after the city.

Sirmium purportedly had 100,000 inhabitants and was one of the largest cities of its time. Colin McEvedy, whose estimates for ancient cities are much lower than the general consensus, put the population at only 7,000, based on the size of the archaeological site. The amount of grain imported between 1 AD and 400 AD was enough to feed 700,000 to 1 million people.

==History==

Remains of Sirmium stand on the site of the modern-day Sremska Mitrovica, west of Belgrade (Roman Singidunum). It was located west of Bassianae and of Viminacium, southwest of Cusum, southeast of Cuccium and southwest of Cibalae. Archaeologists have found traces of organized human life on the site of Sirmium dating from 5,000;BC. The city was first mentioned in the 4th century BC and was originally inhabited by the Illyrians and Celts (by the Pannonian-Illyrian Amantini and the Celtic Scordisci). The Triballi king Syrmus was later considered the eponymous founder of Sirmium, but the roots are different, and the two words only became conflated later. The name Sirmium by itself means &quot;flow, flowing water, wetland&quot;, referring to its close river position on the nearby Sava.

With the Celtic tribe of Scordisci as allies, the Roman proconsul Marcus Vinicius took Sirmium in around 14 BC. In the 1st century AD, Sirmium gained the status of a Roman colony, and became an important military and strategic center of the Pannonia province. The Roman emperors Trajan, Marcus Aurelius, and Claudius II prepared war expeditions in Sirmium.

In 103, Pannonia was split into two provinces: Pannonia Superior and Pannonia Inferior; Sirmium became the capital city of the latter.

In 296, Diocletian reorganized Pannonia into four provinces: Pannonia Prima, Pannonia Valeria, Pannonia Savia and Pannonia Secunda, with Sirmium becoming the capital of Pannonia Secunda. He joined them with Noricum and Dalmatia to establish the Diocese of Pannonia, with Sirmium as its capital also.

In 293, with the establishment of the Tetrarchy, the Roman Empire was split into four parts; Sirmium emerged as one of the four capital cities (along with Trier, Mediolanum, and Nicomedia), and was the capital of emperor Galerius. With the establishment of Praetorian prefectures in 318, the capital of the prefecture of Illyricum was Sirmium, remaining so until 379, when the westernmost Diocese of Illyricum, Pannonia (including Sirmium), was detached and joined to the prefecture of Italia assuming the name of Diocese of Illyricum. The eastern part of Illyricum remained a separate prefecture under the East Roman (Byzantine) Empire with its new capital in Thessalonica.

The city also had an imperial palace, a horse-racing arena, a mint, an arena theatre, and a theatre, as well as many workshops, public baths, temples, public palaces, and luxury villas. Ancient historian Ammianus Marcellinus called it &quot;the glorious mother of cities&quot;. The mint in Sirmium was connected with the mint in Salona and silver mines in the Dinaric Alps through the Via Argentaria.

At the end of the 4th century, Sirmium came under the sway of the Goths, and later, was again annexed to the East Roman Empire. In 441 the Huns conquered Sirmium; for more than a century it was held by various other tribes, such as the Ostrogoths and Gepids. In 504, Ostrogothic Count Pitzas under Theoderic the Great took Sirmium. For a short time, Sirmium was the center of the Kingdom of the Gepids, and king Cunimund () minted gold coins there. After 567, Sirmium was returned to the East Roman Empire. The Pannonian Avars conquered and destroyed the city in 582.

The city was also the location of the Battle of Sirmium that took place in 1167, where a Roman army dispatched by Manuel I Komnenos decisively defeated the forces of Hungary, turning the latter into a satellite state.

==Roman emperors==
Ten Roman emperors were born in this city or in its surroundings: Herennius Etruscus (251), Hostilian (251), Decius (249–251), Claudius II (268–270), Quintillus (270), Aurelian (270–275), Probus (276–282), Maximian (285–310), Constantius II (337–361), and Gratian (367–383).

The last emperor of the united Roman Empire, Theodosius I (378–395), became emperor in Sirmium. The usurpers Ingenuus and Regalianus also declared themselves emperors in this city (in 260) and many other Roman emperors spent some time in Sirmium, including Marcus Aurelius, who might have written parts of his famous work &quot;Meditations&quot; in the city. According to Tertullian Sirmium was also the site of the death of Marcus Aurelius, of smallpox, in March of 180 CE, although the historian Aurelius Victor recounts that Marcus Aurelius died in Vindobona (province of Pannonia Superior, modern Vienna in Austria).

==Christian bishopric==
The city had a Christian community by the third century. By the end of the century, it had a bishop, who was probably the metropolitan of all the Pannonian bishops. The first known bishop was Irenaeus, who was martyred during the Diocletianic Persecution in 304. For the next century, the sequence of bishops is known, but in the fifth and sixth centuries, the see falls into obscurity. An unnamed bishop is mentioned in 448. The last known bishop is mentioned in a papal letter of 594, after which the city itself is rarely mentioned and the see probably went into abeyance.

From the time of the first synod of Tyre in 335, Sirmium became a stronghold of the Arian movement and a site of much controversy. Between 347 and 358 there were four synods held in Sirmium. A fifth took place in 375 or 378. All dealt with the Arian controversy.

==Archeological findings==

At Glac near Sirmium a palace is being excavated, indicated by the luxurious construction materials coming from all over the Mediterranean, such as red and green porphyry from Egypt and the Peloponnese, and marble from Tunisia, Greece and Italy. Some say it is that of Emperor Maximian and according to Aurelius Victor built on the place where his parents worked as laborers on the estate.

During the construction of the hospital in 1971, more than eighty altars were found in a monumental sanctuary to Jupiter, which is the second largest in Europe. Sirmium had two bridges that bridged the river Sava, Ad Basanti, and Artemida&#x27;s bridges according to historical sources. After 313 Sirmium became an important Christian center. So far revealed are eight early Christian churches dedicated to St. Irenaeus, St. Demetrius, and Sv. Sinenot.

During work on the new Sremska Mitrovica trade center in 1972, a worker accidentally broke into an old Roman pot, about 2m deep, over the site of an old Sirmium settlement. 33 gold Roman coins enclosed in a leather pouch were found inside a Roman house wall, probably the hidden savings of a wealthy Roman family stashed centuries ago. Of this extraordinary rare find of Sirmium minted coins were 4 Constantius II era coins, considered the most valuable examples from the late Roman Empire of the fourth century AD. Ironically, the worker&#x27;s name was Zlatenko (meaning &quot;Golden&quot;, or &quot;Golden Man&quot; in Serbian, &quot;Aurelius&quot; in Latin).

Sirmium also had a Roman Hippodrome. A colossal building about 150m wide and 450m long lies directly under the Sremska Mitrovica town center and just beside the old Sirmium &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Palace&quot; (one of just a few Sirmium publicly accessible archeological sites). The presence of the arena has clearly affected the layout of the present town (Sremska Mitrovica is today about 2–4m above the ground line of the former Sirmium settlement). Recently announced cultural and archeological projects for preserving and popularising Sirmium sites haven&#x27;t included any activity dealing with the arena, probably due to the extent of the large arena — the entire present town center might have to be excavated.

<text>Eshmun (or Eshmoun, less accurately Esmun or Esmoun; &quot;&quot;; &quot;Yasumunu&quot;) was a Phoenician god of healing and the tutelary god of Sidon.

==History==
Eshmun was known at least from the Iron Age period at Sidon and was worshipped also in Tyre, Beirut, Cyprus, Sardinia, and in Carthage where the site of Eshmun&#x27;s temple is now occupied by the acropolium of Carthage.

According to Eusebius of Caesarea, Phoenician author Sanchuniathon wrote that Sydyk, &#x27;The Righteous&#x27;, first fathered seven sons equated with the Greek Cabeiri or Dioscuri, no mother named, and then afterwards fathered an eighth son by one of the seven Titanides or Artemides. (See Kotharat). The name &quot;Eshmun&quot; appears to mean &#x27;the Eighth&#x27;.

The Neo-Platonist Damascius also stated
Photius (&quot;Bibliotheca&quot; Codex 242) summarizes Damascius as saying further that Asclepius of Beirut was a youth who was fond of hunting. He was seen by the goddess Astronoë (thought by many scholars to be a version of Astarte) who so harassed him with amorous pursuit that in desperation he castrated himself and died. Astronoë then named the youth &quot;Paeon&quot; &#x27;Healer&#x27;, restored him to life from the warmth of her body, and changed him into a god.

A trilingual inscription of the 2nd century BCE from Sardinia also identifies Eshmun with the Greek Asclepius and the Latin Aesculapius. Pausanias quotes a Sidonian as saying that the Phoenicians claim Apollo as the father of Asclepius, as do the Greeks, but unlike them do not make his mother a mortal woman. The Sidonian then continued with an allegory which explained that Apollo represented the sun, whose changing path imparts to the air its healthiness which is to be understood as Asclepius. This allegory seems likely a late invention. Also, Apollo is usually equated with the Phoenician plague god Resheph. This might be a variant version of Eshmun&#x27;s parentage, or Apollo might also be equated with Sadyk, and Sadyk might be equated with Resheph.

In Cyprus, Eshmun was syncretized with Melqart, and also in Ibiza, as given by a dedication reciting: &quot;to his lord, Eshmun-Melqart&quot;.

The name &quot;Astresmunim&quot; (&quot;herb of Eshmun&quot;) was applied by Dioscorides to the &quot;solanum&quot;, which was regarded as having medicinal qualities.

==Worship==
The Temple of Eshmun is found 1 km from Sidon on the Bostrenus (now called the Awali in southwestern Lebanon). Building was begun at the end of the sixth century BCE during the reign of Eshmunazar II, King of Sidon, and later additions were made up into the Roman period. It was excavated by Maurice Dunand in 1963–1978. Many votive offerings were found in the form of statues of persons healed by the god, especially babies and young children.

Also found near the temple was a gold plaque of Eshmun and the goddess Hygieia (meaning &quot;Health&quot;) showing Eshmun holding a staff in his right hand around which a serpent is entwined. A coin of the 3rd century CE from Beirut shows Eshmun standing between two serpents.

== Place names ==
A village near Beirut named Qabr Shmoun, &quot;Eshmoun&#x27;s grave,&quot; still exists.

<text>Marco Cavagna (1958 – August 9, 2005) was an Italian amateur astronomer.

== Biography ==
During his career, Cavagna discovered numerous asteroids, operating from the Sormano Astronomical Observatory in Sormano, northern Italy. The Minor Planet Center credits him with the discovery of 19 minor planets he made between 1994 and 1998. In the 1970s and 1980s, he was one of Italy&#x27;s leading observers of comets and national coordinator during the International Halley Watch in 1986. Cavagna was also a lecturer at the planetarium of Milan, co-founder of the Sormano Observatory, and a consultant for IAU&#x27;s commission XX (Positions &amp; motions of minor planets, comets and satellites).

Cavagna died of a stroke on 9 August 2005. The 0.5-meter Ritchey–Chrétien telescope at Sormano Observatory is now named in his memory. The inner main-belt asteroid 10149 Cavagna, discovered by astronomers Maura Tombelli and Andrea Boattini at San Marcello Pistoiese Observatory, was named after him in 1999 ().

== Personal life ==
Cavagna was married to amateur astronomer Emanuela Galliani and they are jointly credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of asteroid (23571) Zuaboni on 1 January 1995.

<doc id="773758" wikidata="Q6119570" url="?curid=773758" title="Jacob the Heretic">
<text>Jacob the heretic is the name given to a 2nd-century heretic (Hebrew &quot;min&quot;) whose doings were used as examples in a few passages of the Tosefta and Talmud to illustrate laws relating to dealing with heresy (&quot;minut&quot;).
==Accounts==
===Jacob comes to heal a snake bite===
Tosefta &quot;Chullin&quot; 2:22-23 tells how Rabbi Eleazar ben Damma was bitten by a snake. Jacob came to heal him in the name of Yeshu ben Pandera. Rabbi Ishmael tells Rabbi Eleazar that Jacob is not allowed to heal; Rabbi Eleazar insists that it is allowed, but dies before he is able to provide proof. Rabbi Ishmael comments that Rabbi Eleazar is fortunate to have died before breaking the law, and quotes Ecclesiastes 10:8, &quot;He who breaks a fence will be bitten by a snake.&quot; (&quot;Fence&quot; is used to refer to decrees of the sages meant to protect Jews from situations where they may unwittingly break a commandment. Typically, Jews are allowed to break the law in order to save a life; here Rabbi Ishmael teaches that one should rather die than traffic with &quot;minim&quot;.) 

The Jerusalem Talmud &quot;Avodah Zarah&quot; 2:2 IV.I and Babylonian Talmud &quot;Avodah Zarah&quot; 27b provide a similar account to &quot;Chullin 2:22-23&quot;.

===Jacob prepares medicine for a leg===
&quot;Avodah Zarah&quot; 28a in the Babylonian Talmud continues the discussion which included the above example and again mentions Jacob. This time noting that he prepared medicine for the leg of Rabbi Abbahu, a distinguished man. The name &quot;Jacob the Min&quot; for him comes from this passage.

===The arrest of Eliezer ben Hyrcanus===
Tosefta &quot;Chullin&quot; 2:24 tells how Rabbi Eliezer was once arrested and charged with &quot;minuth&quot;. When the chief judge (&quot;hegemon&quot;) interrogated him, the rabbi answered that he &quot;trusted the judge.&quot; Although Rabbi Eliezer was referring to God, the judge interpreted him to be referring to the judge himself, and freed the Rabbi. The remainder of the account concerns why Rabbi Eliezer was arrested in the first place. Rabbi Akiva suggests that perhaps one of the &quot;minim&quot; had spoken a word of &quot;minuth&quot; to him and that it had pleased him. Rabbi Eliezer recalls that this was indeed the case, he had met Jacob of the town of Sakhnin in the streets of Sepphoris who spoke to him a word of &quot;minuth&quot; in the name of Yeshu ben Pandera, which had pleased him.

&quot;Avodah Zarah&quot;, 16b-17a in the Babylonian Talmud essentially repeats the account of &quot;Chullin&quot; 2:24 about Rabbi Eliezer and adds additional material. It tells that Jacob quoted Deuteronomy 23:19: &quot;You shall not bring the fee of a whore or the price of a dog into the house of the Lord your God in fulfillment of any vow.&quot; Jacob says that he was taught this by Yeshu. Jacob then asked Eliezer whether it was permissible to use a whore&#x27;s money to build a toilet for the high priest. When Rabbi Eliezer did not reply, Jacob quoted Micah 1:7, &quot;For they were amassed from whores&#x27; fees and they shall become whores&#x27; fees again.&quot; This was the teaching that had pleased Rabbi Eliezer.

==Interpretation of Jacob being a Christian healer==

Modern scholars are divided on whether the earliest forms of the Talmud contains direct references to Christianity. On the one hand stand scholars such as Peter Schäfer who sees the Gemara as containing developed reaction to Christianity, on the other scholars such as Daniel J. Lasker who see references to Christianity in the Talmud as &quot;embryonic&quot;. Likewise a similar spectrum exists regarding the references to Jesus in the Talmud from, on the one hand, scholars like Maier (1978) who sees insertions of the name &quot;Yeshu&quot; into the Talmud as later interpolations in &quot;&quot;Reaktion&quot; to Christian &quot;Provokation&quot;,&quot; and on the other those such as Joseph Klausner (1925) who argued that there were traces of the historical Jesus visible in Talmudic traditions. Related to these stories in the Talmud are those recounted by the pagan Celsus. 

During the Disputation of Paris, 1240, and Disputation of Barcelona 1263, references to Jesus in the Talmud became a pretext for Christian persecution and Jehiel ben Joseph in Paris, Nahmanides in Barcelona, defended the Jewish community from Christian inquisitors by denying that the &quot;Yeshu&quot; passages had anything to do with Christianity. Jacob ben Meir (1100-1171) and Jacob Emden (1697-1776) also took this position. In the censorship and self-censorship of the Talmud which followed Adin Steinsaltz notes that references to Christianity were censored out of the Talmud, even where the reference was not negative. 

Today scholars generally recognise some reference to Jesus in the Talmud but differ as to which texts are original. Recently, some scholars have argued that the references to Jesus in the Talmud provide a more complex view of early Rabbinic-Christian interactions. Whereas the Pharisees were one sect among several others in the Second Temple era, the Amoraim and Tannaim sought to establish Rabbinic Judaism as the normative form of Judaism. Like the Rabbis, early Christians claimed to be working within Biblical traditions to provide new interpretations of Jewish laws and values. The sometimes blurry boundary between the Rabbis and early Christians provided an important site for distinguishing between legitimate debate and heresy. Scholars like Rabbi Jeffrey Rubenstein (PhD. in Religion from Columbia University; professor of Hebrew and Judaic Studies at New York University) and Dr. Daniel Boyarin, a professor of Talmud at the University of California, Berkeley, argue that it was through the Yeshu narratives that Rabbis confronted this blurry boundary.

Jeffrey Rubenstein has argued that the accounts in &quot;Chullin&quot; and &quot;Avodah Zarah&quot; reveal an ambivalent relationship between rabbis and Christianity. In his view the tosefta account reveals that at least some Jews believed Christians were true healers, but that the rabbis saw this belief as a major threat. Concerning the Babylonian Talmud account in &quot;Avoda Zarah&quot;, Dr. Boyarin views Jacob of Sechania as a Christian preacher and understands Rabbi Eliezer&#x27;s arrest for minuth as an arrest by the Romans for practising Christianity (the text uses the word for heretic). When the Governor (the text uses the word for chief judge) interrogated him, the Rabbi answered that he &quot;trusted the judge.&quot; Boyarin has suggested that this was the Jewish version of the Br&#x27;er Rabbit approach to domination, which he contrasts to the strategy of many early Christians, who proclaim their beliefs in spite of the consequences (i.e. martyrdom). Although Rabbi Eliezer was referring to God, the Governor interpreted him to be referring to the Governor himself, and freed the Rabbi. According to them the account also reveals that there was greater contact between Christians and Jews in the 2nd century than commonly believed. They view the account of the teaching of Yeshu as a parody of Christianity. According to Dr. Rubenstein, the structure of this teaching, in which a biblical prooftext is used to answer a question about Biblical law, is common to both the Rabbis and early Christians. The vulgar content, however, may have been used to parody Christian values. Dr. Boyarin considers the text to be an acknowledgment that Rabbis often interacted with Christians, despite their doctrinal antipathy.

==Jacob&#x27;s home town==
R. Travers Herford used a translation of the passages which named Jacob&#x27;s hometown as Sama in the first account strictly speaking the name of a town nine miles away from Sakhnin (the account is mentioned in corresponding passages of the Jerusalem Talmud (&quot;Avodah Zarah&quot; 2:2 IV.I), and Babylonian Talmud (&quot;Avodah Zarah&quot; 27b) where his home town is Sama in the former but Sakhnin (Aramaic &quot;Shekhania&quot;) in the latter). As a result of the variant reading Herford considered the question of whether the account is about the same Jacob or not, but concluded that it is. Saul Lieberman who compared early manuscripts to identify copying errors found Sakhnin to be the correct reading.

<text>The Luzon bleeding-heart, bleeding-heart dove, bleeding-heart pigeon or punay (Gallicolumba luzonica) is a species of ground dove in the genus &quot;Gallicolumba,&quot; known as &quot;bleeding-hearts&quot; due to their distinctive red patch on its chest. It was also known as &quot;paloma de punalada&quot; &#x27;stabbed pigeon&#x27; but is nowadays more commonly referred to as just punalada. The Luzon bleeding-heart is the species in which the &quot;blood&quot; feature is most pronounced, while the Mindanao bleeding-heart does have a larger red patch, the Luzon bleeding-heart has a reddish hue extending down the belly, furthering the illusion of a blood stain. It is threatened by habitat loss and hunting for the pet trade and for meat. 

It is illegal to hunt, capture or possess Luzon bleeding-hearts under Philippine Law RA 9147. 

==Description and taxonomy==

It is a medium sized ground dove. On its upper surfaces, the Luzon bleeding-heart is slate grey in color, but because of its iridescence, it can appear to be purple, royal blue, or bottle-green with varying lighting conditions. On their wings are black bands, while their belly and under wing areas are buff or chestnut. It has a white throat, chest and belly but its most distinctive part is its bright red &quot;bleeding heart&quot; at the center of its chest that has a surrounding faint pink that gives off the appearance of fading blood stains. 

There is some slight sexual dimorphism; males tend to be larger and have a more pronounced red patch, while in the females it is slightly duller. The body shape is typical of the genus, with a round body, short tail, and long legs.

Its call is described as a repeated single mournful coo lasting 1 to 2 seconds that rises and falls. It also has a 5 and 3 note display call that is gruffly delivered.

=== Subspecies ===
Three subspecies are recognized:

* &quot;G. l.&quot; &quot;luzonica&quot; &quot;–&quot; Found on Central and South Luzon and Polillo Islands
* &quot;G. l.&quot; &quot;rubiventris&quot; &quot;–&quot; Found on North Luzon; darker and more extensive &quot;heart&quot;, pale pink brown belly, paler undertail and smaller
* &quot;G. l. griseolateralis –&quot; Found on Catanduanes; darker forehead, crown, shoulder, females has darker flanks, undertail but the breast and abdomen is whiter

==Behaviour and ecology==
They eat seeds, berries and grubs. They are shy and secretive, and very quiet, and rarely leave the ground except when nesting. Unlike the other bleeding-hearts, they usually lay two eggs in each clutch. It has been recorded nesting in May and June.

==Conservation status==
It lives in primary or secondary forests, and can be found at altitudes varying from up to 1,400 meters above sea level.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as near-threatened species with the population on the decline. It is threatened by the destruction of its habitat through Illegal logging, conversion into farmlands through Slash-and-burn and mining. Its attractive plummage makes it heavily trapped for the illegal wildlife trade. It is also often bycatch and caught in snares by hunters targetting Red junglefowl and rails. 

It occurs in a few protected areas such as the Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park, Kalbario–Patapat Natural Park, Angat Watershed Forest Reserve, Bulusan Volcano Natural Park, Mount Makiling, Mounts Palay-Palay–Mataas-na-Gulod Protected Landscape and Quezon Protected Landscape however actual protection from habitat destruction and hunters is still lax and these threats persist even in protected areas. 

This species is widely kept and bred in captivity but the genetic purity of captive populations is unknown and it is possible the multiple subspecies have interbred. In 2020, Singapore Zoo sent back 10 individuals to be eventually released back into the wild in an unknown location. As of 2024, there haven&#x27;t been any updates on this project if it pushed through.

<doc id="773778" wikidata="Q4218946" url="?curid=773778" title="Hugh B. Cave">
<text>Hugh Barnett Cave (11 July 1910 – 27 June 2004) was an American writer of various genres, perhaps best remembered for his works of horror, weird menace and science fiction. Cave was one of the most prolific contributors to pulp magazines of the 1920s and &#x27;30s, selling an estimated 800 stories not only in the aforementioned genres but also in western, fantasy, adventure, crime, romance and non-fiction. He used a variety of pen names, notably Justin Case under which name he created the antihero The Eel. A war correspondent during World War II, Cave afterwards settled in Jamaica where he owned and managed a coffee plantation and continued his writing career, now specializing in novels as well as fiction and non-fiction sales to mainstream magazines.

Starting in the 1970s Cave enjoyed a resurgence in popularity when Karl Edward Wagner&#x27;s Carcosa Press published &quot;Murgunstrumm and Others&quot;, the first hardcover collection of Cave&#x27;s pulp stories. Cave relocated to Florida and regularly published original material until about the year 2000, and won a World Fantasy Award for lifetime achievement in 1999.

==Life==
Born in Chester, England, Hugh B. Cave relocated during his childhood with his family to Boston, Massachusetts, soon after the beginning of World War I. His first name was in honor of Hugh Walpole, a favorite author of his mother, a nurse, who had once known Rudyard Kipling.

Cave attended Brookline High School. After graduating, Cave attended Boston University on a scholarship but had to leave when his father was severely injured. He worked initially for a self-publishing press, the only regular job he would ever have. He quit this position at age 20 to write for a living.

From 1932 until his death in 1997, Cave corresponded extensively with fellow pulp writer Carl Richard Jacobi. Selections of this correspondence can be found in Cave&#x27;s memoir &quot;Magazines I Remember&quot;. During the 1930s, Cave lived in Pawtuxet, Rhode Island, but he never met H.P. Lovecraft, who lived in nearby Providence. The two engaged in a debate by correspondence (non-extant) regarding the ethics and aesthetics of writing for the pulp magazines. At least two of Cave&#x27;s stories are associated with Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos – &quot;The Isle of Dark Magic&quot; and &quot;The Death Watch&quot;.

During World War II Cave travelled as a reporter around the Pacific Ocean area and in Southeast Asia. Soon after the war he relocated to the Caribbean area, spending five years in Haiti, after which he rebuilt and managed a successful coffee plantation in Jamaica. He returned to the United States during the early 1970s after the Jamaican government confiscated his plantation.

Hugh Cave was married twice, first to Margaret Long in a union that produced two sons before the couple began living apart, and to Peggy (or Peggie) Thompson, who died during 2001.

Cave was 93 when he died in Vero Beach, Florida, on 27 June 2004. His remains were cremated.

==Legacy==
A biography of Cave entitled &quot;Pulp Man&#x27;s Odyssey: The Hugh B. Cave Story&quot; by Audrey Parente was published by Starmont House (Mercer Island, WA) in 1987.

==Writing career==
Sources differ as to when Cave sold his first story: some say it was &quot;I Name Thee, Cave&quot; while he still attended Brookline High School, others cite &quot;Island Ordeal&quot;, written at age 19 during 1929 while still working for the self-publishing press.

During his early career he contributed to such pulp magazines as &quot;Astounding&quot;, &quot;Black Mask&quot;, and &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. By his own estimate, during the 1930s alone, he published approximately 800 short stories in nearly 100 periodicals using various pseudonyms, such as James Pitt and Margaret Hullinwall. Cave was noted especially for his horror fiction: Stefan Dziemianowicz wrote in the &quot;St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost and Gothic Writers,&quot; that Cave &quot;transformed rural American towns into Gothic landscapes, local powerbrokers into megalomaniacal fiends.&quot; Of particular interest during this time was his series featuring an independent gentleman of courageous action and questionable morals known simply as The Eel. These adventures were published during the late 1930s and early 40s with the pseudonym Justin Case. Cave was also one of the most successful contributors to the weird menace or &quot;shudder pulps&quot; of the 1930s.

During 1943, drawing on his experience as a war reporter, he authored one of his best-regarded works, &quot;Long Were The Nights&quot;, telling of the first PT boats at Guadalcanal. He also wrote a number of other books about the war in the Pacific area during this period.

During his post-war sojourn in Haiti, he became so familiar with the religion of Voodoo that he published &quot;Haiti: High Road to Adventure&quot;, a nonfiction work acclaimed critically as the &quot;best report on voodoo in English.&quot; His Caribbean experiences resulted in his best-selling Voodoo-themed novel, &quot;The Cross on the Drum&quot; (1959), an interracial story in which a white Christian missionary becomes enamored of a black Voodoo priest&#x27;s sister. Reviewing &quot;The Cross on the Drum&quot;,
for &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, Seldon Rodman noted, it &quot;treats both the country and its African religious cult with profound sympathy.&quot;

During this midpoint in his career Cave advanced his writing to the &quot;slick&quot; magazines, including &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Family Circle&quot;, &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, &quot;Redbook&quot;, and the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;. It was in this latter publication, during 1959, that &quot;The Mission,&quot; his most popular short story, was published—- issued subsequently in hardcover format by Doubleday company, reprinted in textbooks, and translated into a number of languages.

According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, during the 1970s, with the golden era of pulp fiction now in the past, Cave&#x27;s &quot;only regular market was writing romance for women&#x27;s magazines.&quot; He was rediscovered, however, by Karl Edward Wagner, who published &quot;Murgunstrumm and Others&quot;, a horror story collection that won Cave the 1978 World Fantasy Award. Other collections followed and Cave also published new horror fiction.

His later career included the publication during the late 1970s and early 1980s of four successful fantasy novels: &quot;Legion of the Dead&quot; (1979), &quot;The Nebulon Horror&quot; (1980), &quot;The Evil&quot; (1981), and &quot;Shades of Evil&quot; (1982). Two other notable late works are &quot;Lucifer&#x27;s Eye&quot; (1991) and &quot;The Mountains of Madness&quot; (2004). Moreover, Cave adapted to the internet, championing the e-book to such an extent that electronic versions of his stories can be purchased readily online.

During his entire career he composed more than 1,000 short stories in nearly all genres (though he is remembered best for his horror and crime pieces), approximately forty novels, and a notable body of nonfiction. He received the Phoenix Award as well as lifetime achievement awards from the International Horror Guild, the Horror Writers Association, and the World Fantasy Convention.

<text>Horace Ashenfelter III (January 23, 1923 – January 6, 2018) was an American athlete. He competed in international athletics from 1947 to 1956. During his career he won fifteen national AAU titles and three collegiate national titles.

==Biography==
Ashenfelter was born in Collegeville, Pennsylvania, where he attended Collegeville High School. He completed his degree at Penn State, where he was a member of Delta Upsilon fraternity, and served in the United States Army Air Forces as a pilot and gunnery instructor during World War II.

Although he was considered a long shot, Ashenfelter was the surprise winner of the steeplechase at the 1952 Summer Olympics at Helsinki with a dramatic surge on the last lap following the final water jump after trailing substantially early in the race. In what was considered an early athletic Cold War battle, he finished ahead of Vladimir Kazantsev of the USSR and John Disley of Great Britain, and broke Kazantsev&#x27;s unofficial world record (the IAAF did not accept official records in the steeplechase until 1954) in the process. Since Ashenfelter worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, it led to humorous comments about him being the first American spy who allowed himself to be chased by a Russian KGB agent (Kazantsev was a KGB officer). In addition, Ashenfelter won the Sullivan Award as outstanding amateur athlete for the year 1952.

Ashenfelter won the Millrose Games two-mile run from 1952 to 1955 and again in 1957. His best winning time was in 1954 at 8:53.3. He won the USA Cross Country Championships back-to-back in 1954–1955, three years after his Olympian younger brother Bill Ashenfelter had won the same championship, the only set of brothers to both win the event.

He was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1975, the Millrose Games Hall of Fame in 2001 as a five-time champion and the National Distance Running Hall of Fame in 2012. He was inducted into the Sports Hall of Fame of New Jersey in 1998.

==Personal life==
Ashenfelter lived in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, where the Ashenfelter 8k Classic is held annually in his honor. The indoor track facility at his alma mater, Penn State, is named in his honor.

Ashenfelter died at a nursing home in West Orange, New Jersey, on January 6, 2018, 17 days before his 95th birthday.

<doc id="773792" wikidata="Q354197" url="?curid=773792" title="Jisaburō Ozawa">
<text>was an admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. Ozawa held several important commands at sea throughout the duration of the conflict (Southern Expeditionary Fleet, 3rd Fleet, 1st Mobile Fleet, and the Combined Fleet).

Ozawa was noted for his innovative ideas in the employment of aircraft carriers. However, he could not, in his most important commands from 1943 onward, succeed in overcoming the superiority of American carrier aviation. In terms of quantity and quality of aircraft, as well as pilot training and experience, the Americans outmatched the Japanese carrier forces under Ozawa&#x27;s command. Ozawa commanded Japanese carrier forces during some of the most significant naval battles that took place in the Pacific Theatre: the Battle of the Philippine Sea and the Battle of Leyte Gulf. He was the last Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet.

Ozawa has been noted for his unusual height for a Japanese man of his time period, measuring in at over tall, although his exact height has not been reliably reported.

==Biography==
===Career prior to World War II===
Jisaburō Ozawa was born in 1886 in Miyazaki District, a rural area of Koyu County, Kyūshū Island, Japan.

Ozawa graduated in 1909 from the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in the 37th class, he was ranked 45th out of 179 students. He served as a midshipman on the ex-Russian protected cruiser &quot;Soya Varyag&quot;, on the pre-dreadnought battleship and on the cruiser . He was appointed Ensign 2nd class in late 1910, and promoted to Ensign 1st class in late 1912. He served on the destroyer &quot;Arare&quot;, the battlecruiser , and the cruiser . Promoted to lieutenant in late 1915, he served on the dreadnought battleship . He specialized in torpedo tactics and served on the destroyer . He graduated from the Naval War College (19th class) in 1921. Promoted to lieutenant commander on December 1, 1921, he embarked on the destroyer , then joined the staff of the Mako Guard District in the Pengu Islands. He then served on the destroyers  and . He served as a torpedo officer on the battleship in 1925, then joined the staff of the 1st Fleet. He was promoted to commander on December 1, 1926. He joined the Naval District of Yokosuka in 1927, then served as an instructor at the Torpedo Naval Service School and the Naval Gunnery School. He later served on the armored cruiser &quot;Kasuga&quot; in 1928–1929, which had been converted into a training ship. In 1930, he visited the United States and Europe and was promoted to captain on December 1, 1930. 

He commanded the 1st, 4th and 11th Destroyer Groups. From 1932 to 1934 he served as an instructor at the Naval War College and at the Army War College. At the end of 1934 he was given command of the heavy cruiser , and the following year of the battleship . 

On December 1, 1936, he was promoted to rear admiral. He taught at the Naval War College in 1936, then held various staff positions, including Chief of Staff of the Combined Fleet in 1937. At the end of 1937, he took command of the 8th Cruiser Division (the cruisers , and ), then, at the end of 1939, the 1st Carrier Division (aircraft carriers and ). He was one of the main designers of Japanese naval aviation tactics.

He was the first high-ranking officer to recommend that carrier forces be brought together in an Air Fleet so that they could train and fight together. This would eventually lead to the creation of 1st Air Fleet, also known as the &quot;Kidō Butai&quot;, a combined carrier battle group comprising most of Japan&#x27;s carriers. On 10 April 1941, Vice-Admiral Chūichi Nagumo was appointed commander-in-chief of the First Air Fleet. Many contemporaries and historians have doubted his suitability for this command, given his lack of familiarity with naval aviation. Admiral Nishizō Tsukahara would say that: &quot;He (Nagumo) was wholly unfitted by background, training, experience, and interest for a major role in Japan’s naval air arm.&quot; Nagumo was appointed by the Navy General Staff, rather than the Combined Fleet. Ozawa was Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto&#x27;s choice for the command of First Air Fleet, but Yamamoto did not have a strong enough case to remove Nagumo. 

On 1 November 1940, he took command of the 3rd Battleship Division (the &quot;Kongō&quot; and , &quot;Hiei&quot; and ).

He was promoted to vice admiral on November 15, 1940, his final rank. In June 1941, he became the director of the Naval War College.

==World War II==
===1st Southern Expeditionary Fleet===
Vice-Admiral Ozawa was appointed as Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Expeditionary Fleet on October 18, 1941, giving him responsibility for naval operations in the South China Sea. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, he oversaw naval operations relating to the invasion of Malaya and the invasion of Thailand. Ozawa planned and successfully completed simultaneous landing operations at both Kota Bahru and Songkhla on December 8 without being intercepted by the British Eastern Fleet. On December 9, Ozawa learned of Force Z&#x27;s location through Japanese submarines. Ozawa&#x27;s fleet of cruisers and destroyers sortied to intercept Force Z, hoping to engage it in a night battle which never occurred. On the morning of December 10, while Force Z tried to intercept Ozawa&#x27;s fleet it was attacked by land-based aircraft of the Japanese navy, resulting in the sinking of battleship and battlecruiser . The loss of two major capital ships severely weakened the British Eastern Fleet, which contributed greatly to British defeat in Malaya and the fall of Singapore.

From January to March 1942, his fleet supported the invasions of Java and Sumatra, the main islands of the Dutch East Indies. On March 1, 1942, the Southern Expeditionary Fleet was re-designated as the 1st Southern Expeditionary Fleet.

In April 1942, Vice-Admiral Nagumo of the Combined Fleet launched a raid on Ceylon (Sri Lanka) against the British Eastern Fleet, code-named Operation C. At the same time, Vice-Admiral Ozawa, commanding the Malay Force, launched a separate operation against Allied merchant ships in the Bay of Bengal. In this operation, Ozawa commanded a fleet of four heavy cruisers of the 7th Cruiser Division under Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita, his flagship the heavy cruiser , the aircraft carrier , a light cruiser and four destroyers.

In 3 days, Ozawa&#x27;s force managed to sink 23 merchant ships (20 in a single day), totaling over 130,000 gross registered tons. In addition, April saw 32,000 tons of shipping sunk by Japanese submarines off India&#x27;s west coast. &quot;Ryūjō&quot;″s aircraft also bombed the ports of Cocanada and Vizagapatam, causing relatively minor damage. The tonnage and number of ships sunk by Ozawa&#x27;s force, are comparable to that of the 3-month long Operation Berlin raid conducted by two battleships of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; from January to March 1941. In both raids against merchant shipping, Allied merchant ships were not sailing in convoys escorted by large vessels.

===Command of the 3rd Fleet (November 1942–March 1944)===

Four months later, on November 11, 1942, Vice-Admiral Ozawa was given command of the 3rd Fleet, replacing Vice-Admiral Nagumo who was reassigned to a shore command in Sasebo after his forces were defeated at the Battle of Midway.

The 3rd Fleet was set up as an aircraft carrier task force. In July 1942 it comprised
*The large, fast carriers and , which made up the 1st Carrier Division. Both took part in the attack on Pearl Harbor, but neither were present at the Battle of Midway.
*The light aircraft carrier , which was present at the Battle of Midway, but did not participate in the engagement of June 4, 1942, which had ended disastrously for the Japanese.
*The two s, which were converted from ocean liners. The &quot;Hiyō&quot;-class carriers joined the fleet in mid-1942.
*The light aircraft carrier . The &quot;Ryūhō&quot; together with the two &quot;Hiyō&quot;-class carriers constituted the 2nd Carrier Division.

The priority for the Imperial Japanese Navy was the construction of new aircraft carriers and the training of new pilots. This task was the responsibility of Admiral Mineichi Koga, then commander-in-chief of the Yokosuka Naval District. The IJN desperately needed to replace the heavy losses suffered by their carrier forces at Midway and the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. The 3rd Fleet was therefore conserved and not fully committed during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. Meanwhile, the , which had been damaged in the Santa Cruz Islands, was quickly repaired and sent into action. At Guadalcanal the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was able to contribute to the destruction of the fast battleship &quot;Hiei&quot; and heavy cruiser in November 1942.

The 3rd Fleet took part in covering the largely successful evacuation of Japanese forces from Guadalcanal on 26 January 1943.

In April 1943, under the orders of Admiral Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, many aircraft of the 3rd Fleet were momentarily transferred ashore, to take part in Operation I-Go. Launched from Rabaul, Bougainville and the Shortland Islands, I-Go was an aerial counter-offensive consisting of the bombardments of Guadalcanal, Port Moresby, Oro Bay and Milne Bay in New Guinea. The results of I-Go were inconclusive, but the losses suffered by Japanese carrier aircraft (including that of the 3rd Fleet) against American fighter aircraft were severe. Of the 350 aircraft that took part in I-Go, 55 were destroyed.

From September to October 1943, the 3rd Fleet unsuccessfully attempted to intercept American carrier forces which had carried out air raids on Tarawa, Makin, Wake Island and the Marshall Islands. After the massive American air attacks on Rabaul in November 1943 and on Truk in February 1944, the 3rd Fleet withdrew to safer anchorage of the Lingga Islands in Sumatran waters, near Singapore. During this period the light aircraft carriers of the , which were converted from two seaplane tenders, joined the 3rd Fleet. joined at the end of 1943, and joined at the beginning of 1944. The two &quot;Chitose&quot;-class carriers along with &quot;Zuihō&quot; formed the 3rd Carrier Division.

A reorganization of the Japanese naval forces took place at the beginning of 1944. The Combined Fleet was replaced as an operational unit by the 1st Mobile Fleet, which Vice-Admiral Ozawa was given command of on 1 March 1944. The large new aircraft carrier was put into action and joined the 1st Carrier Division on April 5. On April 15, &quot;Taihō&quot; became Vice-Admiral Ozawa&#x27;s flagship.

===Command of the 1st Mobile Fleet and the Battle of the Philippine Sea===
In June 1944 the Imperial Japanese Navy was able to field nine aircraft carriers (3 fleet carriers and 6 light carriers) in a single operational formation, more than it had ever fielded before. Together they were equipped with nearly 500 aircraft. Some carried Japan&#x27;s newest aircraft models, most notably the &quot;Zero&quot; model A6M5, the dive bomber Yokosuka D4Y &quot;Judy&quot; and the torpedo bomber B6N &quot;Jill&quot;. Some ships, in particular the light aircraft carriers, did not carry the &quot;Judy&quot;.

However, the industrial power of the United States was such that the American Third Fleet of the Central Pacific (nicknamed the &quot;Big Blue Fleet&quot;) was able to operate more carriers than the Japanese. The main striking force of the US Navy, Vice Admiral Mitscher&#x27;s Fast Carrier Task Force alone consisted of seven carriers, eight light aircraft carriers, seven modern battleships and sixteen large cruisers. In addition, American carrier aircraft at that point, including the Grumman F6F &quot;Hellcat&quot; fighter, were as capable, if not even more so, than the newest Japanese aircraft models.

Above all, the superiority of American carriers at this point of the war was due to better training of carrier pilots and crewmen. American pilots and deck teams greatly benefited from the training provided by two &quot;training aircraft carriers&quot; and , converted from side-wheel steamer cruise ships. These two training carriers operated in the safe waters of the American Great Lakes. Meanwhile, Japanese training sorties on the high seas were constantly under threat from US submarines. While &quot;Chitose&quot; was at sea off Tawi-Tawi, conducting air training on 22 May 1944, the American submarine fired a spread of torpedoes at her, but they exploded in her wake and she escaped damage. At the end of May 1944, as the 1st Mobile Fleet anchored at Twai-Twai, Vice-Admiral Ozawa was forced to prohibit training sorties on the open ocean.

In the Battle of the Philippine Sea, the 1st Mobile Fleet was organized into three forces, similar to American task forces, bringing together aircraft carriers and surface combatants:
*&quot;A&quot; Force, commanded by Vice-Admiral Ozawa personally, consisted of the 1st Aircraft Carrier Division, two heavy cruisers of the 5th Cruiser Division ( and ), a light cruiser and six destroyers.
*&quot;B&quot; Force, commanded by Rear Admiral Jōjima, consisted of the 2nd Aircraft Carrier Division, the battleship , the heavy cruiser and ten destroyers.
*&quot;C&quot; Force, commanded by Vice Admiral Kurita, consisted of the 3rd Aircraft Carrier Division, the 1st and 3rd Battleship Divisions ( and , &quot;Kongō&quot; and &quot;Haruna&quot;), eight heavy cruisers (all four of the , two of the &quot;Mogami&quot; class and both of the ), one light cruiser and seven destroyers.

On June 10, the 1st Battleship Division, under Vice-Admiral Matome Ugaki, set sail from Tawi-Tawi to reinforce the defense of the island of Biak northwest of New Guinea, which was under attack by Allied amphibious forces. Arriving at Batjan on June 12, the division was joined by the two cruisers of the 5th Cruiser Division. By then American bombardments had begun on the Mariana Islands, triggering Plan A-Go, and Vice Admiral Ugaki was ordered to sail the 1st Mobile Fleet, which was on its way west from Saipan, to the Philippine Sea on June 17.

The idea of the Japanese maneuver (A-Go) was to seek a &quot;decisive battle&quot; with American naval forces providing aerial cover for landings on the Mariana Islands, particularly on Saipan, after Japanese land-based aircraft had weakened them. However, it was American carrier aircraft that struck first. On June 11, the Japanese-held airfields of Rota, Saipan, Tinian and Guam were attacked, resulting in 60% of the 250 aircraft based there being destroyed. Then on June 14, the airfields of Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima were also attacked. Trusting overly optimistic reports received from Vice-Admiral Kakuta, commanding the 1st Air Fleet (which consisted of land-based naval aircraft), Vice-Admiral Ozawa planned to take advantage of the greater range of his aircraft, and of westerly trade winds. On June 18, Ozawa sent Vice-Admiral Kurita&#x27;s &quot;C&quot; Force 150 km to the east as a vanguard. On the evening of June 18, the 1st Mobile Fleet was detected by American submarines, and Admiral Nimitz was able to locate it 560 km west-southwest of Saipan. Admiral Spruance chose to wait for the impending Japanese attack. He deployed his fast battleships to form a long-range anti-aircraft screen but did not authorize Vice Admiral Mitscher to intercept the 1st Mobile Fleet, so as not risk being forced to retreat, a maneuver that would have put the amphibious forces landing at Saipan at greater risk.

On the morning of June 19, the first wave of attack was launched by the 3rd Aircraft Carrier Division of Force &quot;C&quot;, without coordination with the other forces, inflicting only minimal damage to the battleship at a heavy cost. Of the about 70 planes that took part in the raid, 40 were shot down. A second wave was launched shortly after by the bulk of the Japanese forces. It had almost twice as many aircraft but did not achieve any significant results. Out of almost 130 aircraft engaged, nearly 100 were shot down by anti-aircraft fire and carrier aircraft.

Later that morning, two critical blows were dealt to the 1st Mobile Fleet by two s, and . &quot;Albacore&quot; torpedoed the flagship &quot;Taihō&quot;, forcing Vice-Admiral Ozawa to transfer to the cruiser &quot;Haguro&quot;, and &quot;Cavalla&quot; torpedoed the aircraft carrier &quot;Shokaku&quot;. The two aircraft carriers sank on the afternoon of June 19 due to aviation gas fires and explosions. Despite the efforts of the damage control teams, the carriers sank in part due to the volatility of the poor-quality aviation fuel that the Japanese were forced to use. The Japanese suffered serious losses: in addition to the two fleet carriers sunk, 90% of the approximately 80 planes of the fourth wave were shot down. By late afternoon, the Mobile Fleet retreated northwest to rejoin their tankers, and the American fleet did not pursue them. The aerial part of the battle was nicknamed the &quot;Great Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot; by American aviators for the severely disproportional loss ratio inflicted upon Japanese aircraft by American pilots and anti-aircraft gunners.

On June 20, although only a third of the 326 aircraft launched returned to his carriers, Vice-Admiral Ozawa aboard his last major carrier, &quot;Zuikaku&quot;, believed the excessively optimistic reports of his surviving airmen about the damage inflicted on the American aircraft carriers. In addition, he had a number of planes on Guam and Rota. When he learned of an intercepted message indicating that the American fleet did not know where the Japanese fleet was, he began planning for a new raid. However, by around 3:40 p.m., the Japanese fleet was spotted by American reconnaissance aircraft 220 nautical miles northwest of the American fleet. At 4 p.m., Vice Admiral Mitscher decided, despite the far distance of the Japanese fleet and the advanced hour of the afternoon, to launch an attack of around 180 planes, which took off a quarter of an hour later. By 6:15 p.m. the carrier &quot;Hiyō&quot; and two tankers were sunk. &quot;Hiyō&quot; was struck by two bombs, one of which detonated above the bridge and killed or wounded virtually everyone there, and sank two hours later. The carriers &quot;Zuikaku&quot; and &quot;Chiyoda&quot; were also damaged, and 40 aircraft were shot down. Ozawa then decided to retreat to Okinawa and Japan. As night fell, the return of American planes to their aircraft carriers took place in great confusion, resulting in significant losses.

Following the disastrous defeat of Ozawa&#x27;s forces in the Philippines Sea, he submitted his resignation, which was refused.

===Operation Shō-Gō and the defense of the Philippines===

The Japanese defeat in the Philippine Sea made the loss of the Mariana Islands inevitable, which brought the heart of the Empire of Japan within range of the United States Army Air Forces&#x27; long-range B-29 Superfortress bombers. The loss of the Marianas precipitated the departure of General Tōjō as Prime Minister. He was replaced by General Koiso at the end of the Battle of Saipan. The Japanese military&#x27;s main strategic concern was the defense of the territory which could be the next main American target. There were four likely targets: the Ryūkyū Islands, Formosa, the Kuril Islands and the Philippines. In the Shō-Gō Plan, the goal was to attack the surface forces tasked with the protection of Allied landings, to destroy them, then to attack the transport ships. The Palau Islands and the Western Carolinas were excluded from the defense perimeter and deemed inevitable losses.

As for the organization of Ozawa&#x27;s forces, the loss of &quot;Hiyō&quot; and the poor performance of &quot;Ryūhō&quot; led to the withdrawal of the 2nd Carrier Division from front-line forces and the return of &quot;Zuikaku&quot; to the 3rd Carrier Division under the command of Vice-Admiral Ozawa.

Forces involved in the Shō-Gō Plan were divided into several parts. Vice-Admiral Kurita&#x27;s &quot;First Striking Force&quot; returned to anchorage in the Lingga Islands in July, closer to Japan and fuel supplies. But Vice-Admiral Ozawa&#x27;s &quot;Main Body&quot; force and Vice-Admiral Shima&#x27;s &quot;Second Striking Force&quot; remained based in Japan to replenish carrier squadrons and train new pilots. The next major American offensive was presumed to begin in November 1943 at the earliest. However, things accelerated in mid-September and in early October, as the American bombardments left little doubt about the imminent American invasion of the Philippines. Vice-Admiral Ozawa then reported to Admiral Toyoda, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, of the impossibility for the crews of his aircraft carriers being ready in time to provide air cover for Kurita&#x27;s force. Ozawa proposed to have his and Kurita&#x27;s forces operate autonomously. This was accepted by Toyoda. Vice-Admiral Ozawa was also ordered to transfer more than half of his pilots to Formosa; these pilots had not been trained to operate from aircraft carriers but could operate from land bases. Ozawa&#x27;s aircraft carriers, with greatly depleted squadrons, were then assigned the role of decoy; they were to lure the fast American aircraft carriers away and allow Kurita&#x27;s force of seven battleships and eleven heavy cruisers to reach the landing beaches more easily. Final adjustments were made to the plan after both Shima&#x27;s and Ozawa&#x27;s squadrons left their respective bases: the two hybrid carrier-battleships and (with no aircraft on board), were attached to Vice-Admiral Ozawa&#x27;s squadron. Vice-Admiral Shima was ordered to operate in coordination with Vice-Admiral Kurita.

===The Battle off Cape Engaño===

Vice Admiral Ozawa&#x27;s decoy &quot;Northern Force&quot;, comprising one large aircraft carrier, his flagship the &quot;Zuikaku&quot;, three light aircraft carriers, two hybrid battleships, three light cruisers and ten destroyers, left the Japanese Inland Sea on October 20, 1944, around noon. By then the American landings had already begun on the island of Leyte (one of the main islands of the Philippines), and Vice-Admiral Kurita had already left the Lingga anchorage two days ago and reached Brunei in Borneo.

Vice-Admiral Ozawa was perfectly aware that his forces, with a total of a hundred aircraft (barely more aircraft than one American fleet carrier), was not in a position to confront Admiral Halsey&#x27;s forces. However, he decided to do his best to draw them as far as possible from the San Bernardino Strait, where Vice-Admiral Kurita&#x27;s &quot;Center Force&quot; was going to strike. He decided to break out into the Philippine Sea even if it meant the &quot;complete destruction&quot; of his fleet.

Vice-Admiral Ozawa led his ships to the north of Luzon, the northeastern point of which is Cape Engaño. At first, his force was not spotted by the American forces, although it had voluntarily broken off radio silence on October 23. On the morning of October 24, Ozawa found himself about a hundred nautical miles from Rear Admiral Sherman&#x27;s Task Group 38.3 when the light aircraft carrier was crippled by an air attack by Japanese land-based aircraft. That morning he launched 76 planes to attack Task Group 38.3 without results. These pilots were ordered to then go and land on the airfields of Luzon, as the Japanese command was convinced that Ozawa&#x27;s carriers would all be sunk.

Ozawa only learned of the result of the Battle of Sibuyan Sea through a message from Kurita at around 4.30 p.m., notifying Ozawa of his retreat. He concluded that he had failed in his mission and considered withdrawing. However, complying with Admiral Toyoda&#x27;s order to have all forces attack &quot;counting on divine assistance&quot;, he sailed south with the aircraft carriers in search of American forces, trying to draw the 3rd Fleet&#x27;s attention to his decoy force. Ozawa dispatched the two hybrid battleships forward under the command of Rear Admiral Matsuda. It was then that American reconnaissance finally spotted his force, Admiral Halsey then decided to face what seemed to him as a new and powerful threat with the entire Task Force 38. He ordered his three Task Groups in the area to concentrate on attacking the Japanese aircraft carriers, and headed north.

During the night, warned that Vice-Admiral Kurita&#x27;s Force had been spotted entering the San Bernardino Strait, Admiral Halsey did not worry. He was convinced that it was only a new manifestation of the Japanese obstinacy in carrying out orders &quot;à la Guadalcanal&quot;. He was convinced that this force had been reduced and no longer represented a real threat, he concentrated his six fast battleships, three heavy cruisers and five large light cruisers on his front to attack the aircraft carriers of Ozawa. At daybreak on October 25, Vice-Admiral Ozawa headed north to attract the American forces further away from San Bernardino Strait.

Taking off at 6:30 a.m., 180 aircraft of the first American wave had to wait in the air for an hour and a half for Ozawa&#x27;s fleet to be precisely located. American intelligence officers estimated that they were north of the carriers of Task Force 38, between 45 and 85 nautical miles, but in reality they were northeast at 140 nautical miles. The attack did not take place until around 8:40 a.m. To the surprise of American airmen, the Japanese carriers had no aircraft on the flight decks, and virtually no fighter cover. However, the anti-aircraft fire was precise and intense, notably using &quot;Sanshikidan&quot; beehive rounds fired by the 14-inch main guns of battleships &quot;Ise&quot; and &quot;Hyūga&quot;. As a result of this air attack, the two &quot;Chitose&quot;-class aircraft carriers were disabled, and &quot;Chitose&quot; sank at about 09:30, &quot;Chiyoda&quot; was rendered immobile. &quot;Zuikaku&quot;, meanwhile, received damage that was not irreparable, but the damage inflicted on the flagship&#x27;s transmission system did not allow Vice Admiral Ozawa to let either Vice Admiral Kurita or Admiral Toyoda know that the diversion was a success.

Task Force 38 had taken the bait and was in contact with the Japanese aircraft carriers, TF38 was north of Luzon, 200 nautical miles away from the San Bernardino Strait. At about 9:30 a.m., because of the damaged transmission systems on &quot;Zuikaku&quot;, Ozawa transferred his flag to the cruiser &quot;Ōyodo&quot; which had powerful radio systems designed to meet the needs of an admiral&#x27;s staff commanding a fleet.

At about 08:30, when he had learned of the results of this first attack, Admiral Halsey ordered Vice Admiral &quot;Ching&quot; Lee, commanding the fast battleships, to proceed at 25 knots towards the damaged Japanese ships and finish them off with cannon fire. However, the commander of the 3rd Fleet began to receive very alarming messages from Vice-Admiral Kinkaid, commander of the 7th Fleet, about the combat off Samar between Vice-Admiral Kurita&#x27;s large force of battleships, cruisers and destroyers and the heavily outgunned Task Unit of Taffy 3, which only consisted of escort carriers and destroyers. However, Halsey continued to advance north, with his flagship, , the modern battleships under Vice Admiral Lee and the large cruisers.

At about 10 a.m., shortly before Vice Admiral Mitscher launched a second attack, Admiral Halsey, who had already received five desperate calls from Vice Admiral Kinkaid, this time received an infamous message from Admiral Nimitz asking, from Pearl Harbor, &quot;Where is Task Force 34? The world wonders&quot; which he interpreted as a harsh and sarcastic rebuke. At 11:15 a.m., when the immobilized Japanese ships were only 40 nautical miles away, he ordered the fast battleships to turn south, in an attempt to intercept Kurita&#x27;s force. Meanwhile, Vice-Admiral Ozawa continued heading north, with his less damaged ships.

Admiral Halsey headed south with the fast battleships, three large light cruisers and Task Group 38.2. The mission to finish off Vice Admiral Ozawa fell to Vice Admiral Mitscher with the two Task Groups he had left behind. Mitscher launched two new attacks in the afternoon. The first, at around 1:30 p.m., fatally damaged &quot;Zuikaku&quot;, which was hit by half-ton armor-piercing bombs from twelve bombers from and nine &quot;Helldivers&quot; from . The last Japanese aircraft carrier present at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Zuikaku&quot;, sank at around 14:30. Around 3 p.m., the previously damaged but maneuverable &quot;Zuihō&quot; was also sunk.

&quot;Chiyoda&quot; was the only carrier remaining, immobilized since the morning but still afloat. Halsey detached a task group of four cruisers and nine destroyers under Rear Admiral DuBose, these ships were a part of TG 38.3 and TG 38.4. Its mission was to pursue the remnants of Ozawa&#x27;s force. However, Ozawa still had two battleships each armed with eight 14-inch (356 mm) guns, while Vice-Admiral Mitscher no longer had any battleships. Informed that there were no battleships around the &quot;Chiyoda&quot;, DuBose&#x27;s detachment went to her. &quot;Chiyoda&quot;″s crew had not abandoned ship and fought back with ineffective fire. The Japanese light aircraft carrier, in flames, sank around 4:30 p.m. A final air attack after 5 p.m. against &quot;Ise&quot; and &quot;Hyuga,&quot; inflicted only light damage. The American cruisers then attacked several small damaged Japanese ships. Around 7:30 p.m., learning of DuBose&#x27;s relatively weak task group, Vice-Admiral Ozawa decided to turn around with his two battleships and meet the outgunned American forces. But as night fell, with his destroyers beginning to run low on fuel oil, Rear Admiral DuBose turned back at about 9:50 p.m. Meeting no one, Ozawa turned back north, towards Japan. The Battle of Leyte Gulf had ended.

It was reported that Ozawa contemplated suicide after the defeat, but was dissuaded by a fellow officer, who argued that Ozawa was the only one of the Japanese admirals at the Battle of Leyte Gulf who successfully carried out an assigned mission.

=== Operation Cherry Blossoms at Night ===
On November 15, 1944, the Mobile Fleet and the 3rd Fleet were disbanded. Vice Admiral Ozawa was appointed vice chief of the General Staff of the Navy and director of the Naval War College. Ozawa led the planning of Operation PX, also known as Operation Cherry Blossoms at Night, a planned Japanese military attack on American civilians using biological weapons.

Operation PX was proposed in December 1944. The name for the operation came from the Japanese use of the code name PX for Pestis bacillus (bubonic plague) infected fleas. In planning the operation, the navy partnered with Lieutenant-General Shirō Ishii of Unit 731, who had extensive experience on weaponizing pathogenic bacteria and human vulnerability to biological and chemical warfare.

The plan for the attack involved &quot;Seiran&quot; aircraft launched by submarine aircraft carriers upon the West Coast of the United States—specifically, the cities of San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. The planes would spread weaponized bubonic plague, cholera, typhus, dengue fever, and other pathogens in a biological terror attack upon the population. The submarine crews would infect themselves and run ashore in a suicide mission. Planning for Operation PX was finalized on March 26, 1945, but shelved shortly thereafter due to strong opposition from Army Chief of General Staff Yoshijirō Umezu.

=== Okinawa and the end of the war===

In February 1945, with the formation of the 5th Air Fleet, under Vice Admiral Matome Ugaki, navy high command began to supervise &quot;kamikaze&quot; operations. Until then, &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks were mostly organized by local commanders.

In March, when briefing Emperor Hirohito on Japan&#x27;s response to the expected invasion of Okinawa, Japanese military leaders explained that the Imperial Japanese Army was planning extensive air attacks, including the use of &quot;kamikaze&quot; tactics. The emperor then reportedly asked, &quot;But what about the Navy? What are they doing to assist in defending Okinawa? Have we no more ships?&quot; Feeling pressured by the emperor to mount some kind of attack, Japanese Navy high command conceived a &quot;kamikaze&quot;-type mission for their remaining operational large ships. Ozawa was involved in the planning of Operation Ten-Go, code name of the suicide attack of battleship &quot;Yamato&quot;, cruiser and eight other warships against Allied forces engaged at Okinawa.

On May 29, 1945, when Admiral Toyoda succeeded Admiral Oikawa as Chief of the General Staff of the Imperial Japanese Navy, Vice Admiral Ozawa succeeded him as the last Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet. Upon his appointment, he refused a promotion to admiral and remained as a vice admiral until the final disbandment of the Imperial Japanese Navy. He was the only wartime commander of the Combined Fleet who did not become an admiral.

As commander of the Combined Fleet, he continued Operation Kikusui, a series of &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks launched against Allied naval forces around Okinawa. Kikusui managed to inflict serious damage to the Allies but it ended following the defeat of Japanese land forces on Okinawa, as Ozawa&#x27;s remaining forces prepared for the final showdown on the Japanese home islands. In the face of devastating B-29 air raids on Japan, on June 24 Ozawa ordered Vice Admiral Kinpei Teraoka, commander of the 3rd Air Fleet, to begin preparations for Operation Tsurugi. The operation was a suicide attack in which Yokosuka P1Ys would strafe and bomb American airfields in the Mariana Islands, afterwards, Mitsubishi G4Ms carrying &quot;Giretsu Kuteitai&quot; commandos would crash land on them. The commandos would then destroy as many B-29 bombers as possible before fighting to the death. This attack was scheduled to take place between August 19 and 23. However, Japan surrendered on August 15. 

On 25 June 1945, Ozawa issued orders for an attack on American ships anchored at Ulithi, dubbed Operation Arashi. The orders called for submarines and to transport Nakajima C6N1 &quot;Saiun&quot; reconnaissance aircraft to Truk in the Caroline Islands in late July 1945. In Operation Hikari, the C6N aircraft were to conduct a reconnaissance of Ulithi, noting the presence and location of Allied aircraft carriers and troop transports. Submarine carriers and then were to launch a combined total of six M6A1 floatplanes — which were to use the reconnaissance information to assist them in targeting Allied ships — on 17 August 1945 for a nighttime strike under a full moon against the Ulithi anchorage, each plane armed with an 800-kilogram (1,764 lb) bomb. Ozawa also authorized Operation Tan No. 4, a surprise &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack on Ulithi, following Operation Tan No. 2 on March 11 (No. 3 was cancelled due to weather). None of these attacks on Ulithi materialized because of Japan&#x27;s surrender.

Just before the surrender of Japan, Vice Admiral Ōnishi, who is known as the father of the &quot;kamikaze&quot;, vocally advocated for continuing the war. Ōnishi claimed that the sacrifice of 20 million more Japanese lives would make Japan victorious, Ozawa reportedly rebuked Ōnishi by asking him who would rebuild Japan if 20 million more men had died. 

On 15 August, Hirohito announced the surrender of Japan, hours later Vice Admiral Ugaki personally joined a &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack. Ozawa criticized Ugaki&#x27;s suicide, claiming that this was a violation of orders. He then forbade his staff from committing suicide. That same day, the commander of Atsugi Air Base Yasuna Kozono publicly announced that his unit would not surrender. Ozawa perceived this as a mutiny and prepared to suppress it. However, the situation came to an end when Kozono fell ill with malaria.

According to American officers who interviewed him after the war, Ozawa made a favorable impression. Although he was elderly and infirm by then, he was composed, had a sharp mind and was well informed. It was from post-war interrogations with Ozawa that historians learned of important changes to the Shō-Gō Plan that took place at the eve of the Battle for Leyte Gulf. He also had the reputation of being both courageous and compassionate towards his men.

Ozawa avoided prosecution by SCAP authorities and served as an advisor for the Japanese Defense Agency. He died in 1966 at the age of 80.

<text>John &quot;Handsome Johnny&quot; Roselli (born Filippo Sacco; July 4, 1905 – August 7, 1976), sometimes spelled Rosselli, was a mobster for the Chicago Outfit who helped that organization exert influence over Hollywood and the Las Vegas Strip. Roselli was recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in a plot to assassinate Cuban leader Fidel Castro.

== Early years ==
Roselli was born Filippo Sacco on July 4, 1905, in Esperia, Lazio, Italy. His father, Vincenzo Sacco, had moved to the United States first, followed by Filippo at the age of six, who had immigrated with his mother, Mariantonia Pascale Sacco, to Boston, Massachusetts. His father died in 1918.

== 1920s ==
In September 14, 1922, Sacco was arrested on narcotics charges in Massachusetts. He first fled to New York for three months, before moving on to Chicago, where he changed his name from Filippo Sacco to John Roselli.

Roselli moved to Los Angeles in 1924, pleading guilty to bootlegging that same year. Roselli began his California criminal career working for small-time bootleggers, becoming the top truck driver for Tony Cornero. Eventually, Roselli was promoted to working closely with the Cornero brothers to secure liquor imports into Southern California. He was especially important in bribing and securing the loyalty of Orange County officials, opening up their ports for the gang&#x27;s use. In 1926, Tony Cornero fled to Canada, escaping a two-year bootlegging sentence. As a result of the gang&#x27;s dissolution, Roselli went independent. He became further involved in several LA area vice rackets, especially prostitution and gambling.

Roselli first met Al Capone in 1927, on a trip to Chicago to attend the Jack Dempsey-Gene Tunney Boxing match. Capone was holding a party that night at his headquarters, Metropole Hotel, where Johnny could briefly meet him and the Chicago Outfit&#x27;s inner circle. Roselli next met with Capone at the Biltmore Hotel in Downtown Los Angeles. In 1928, Capone invited Roselli to Chicago, offering him a role in his organization. Roselli was tasked with working with the Los Angeles crime family, to monitor Capone&#x27;s investments and facilitate cooperation between the LA and Chicago organizations. The LA branch of the mafia was at the time under the leadership of Joseph Ardizzone, and Roselli worked closely with Ardizonne&#x27;s underboss Jack Dragna.

During this time, Roselli was involved with Los Angeles&#x27; offshore gambling racket. He led the mob&#x27;s hostile takeover of the gambling ship &quot;Monfalcone&quot;. Roselli&#x27;s underworld activities sometimes had to be put on hold while he dealt with long bouts of tuberculosis.

Roselli became close friends with film producer Bryan Foy, who brought Roselli into the movie business as a producer with Foy&#x27;s small production company, Eagle Lion Studios, where Roselli is credited on several early gangster movies as a producer. Roselli was also close friends with Columbia Pictures co-founder Harry Cohn.

== 1930s ==
In 1931, LA Mafia boss Joseph Ardizzone survived two assassination attempts and declared he would retire. Instead, he disappeared in October 1931 and Jack Dragna took his place as Don.

In July 1933, Frank L. Shaw began his term as the Los Angeles mayor. He established a corrupt administration where the city&#x27;s underworld paid regular bribes directly to city hall. Roselli used his position in LA&#x27;s mafia and deep knowledge of the city&#x27;s underworld to make himself the liaison between the mayor&#x27;s office and the various gangs and individuals who sent regular payoffs to city hall. This favored position with the city government helped to position Jack Dragna&#x27;s organization as the preeminent criminal organization in Los Angeles under the Shaw administration.

== 1940s–1950s ==
 During this period, Roselli&#x27;s lawyer was Frank DeSimone; secretly a mob member, DeSimone became the L.A. mob boss when Jack Dragna died in 1956.

In 1942, Roselli was indicted on federal labor racketeering charges, along with George Brown, former president of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees union, and Willie Bioff, labor racketeer and former pimp. Later in 1942, Roselli enlisted in the United States Army, where he served for three years before receiving an undesirable discharge. It was while in the service that Roselli was convicted of the extortion scheme to extort money from Hollywood figures, in 1943, serving a prison sentence until his release in 1947.

In the mid-1950s, Roselli shifted his focus away from Hollywood and toward the fast-growing and highly profitable gambling mecca, Las Vegas, Nevada. By 1956, Roselli had become the Chicago and Los Angeles mob&#x27;s chief representative in Las Vegas. His job was to ensure that the Chicago mob bosses received their share of the burgeoning casino revenues through &quot;skimming&quot;. However, according to the Los Angeles office of the FBI, Roselli was employed as a movie producer at Monogram Studios.

== 1960s ==

After the Cuban Revolution in January 1959, Fidel Castro closed down the casinos that the Mob operated in Cuba, and attempted to drive the mobsters out of the country. This made Roselli, Chicago Outfit boss Sam Giancana and Tampa boss Santo Trafficante amenable to the idea of killing Castro.

According to the Family Jewels documents released in 2007, members of the American mafia were involved in CIA&#x27;s attempts to assassinate Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Roselli had a particular contempt for Castro and felt in some way responsible for the Bay of Pigs invasion failure as he had encouraged individuals to take part. The documents showed that, in September 1960, the CIA recruited Robert Maheu, an ex-FBI agent and aide to Howard Hughes in Las Vegas, to approach Roselli under the pretense of representing international corporations that wanted Castro dead due to lost gambling interests. Roselli introduced Maheu to mobster leaders Sam Giancana and Santo Trafficante Jr. Supplied with six poison pills from the CIA, Giancana and Trafficante tried unsuccessfully to have people place the poison in Castro&#x27;s food. Further attempts were canceled soon thereafter due to the Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961.

In 1963, singer Frank Sinatra sponsored Roselli for membership in the exclusive Los Angeles Friar&#x27;s Club. Soon after his acceptance, Roselli discovered an elaborate card-cheating operation run by one of his Las Vegas friends, Maurice Friedman, and asked for his cut. The card cheating was finally discovered in July 1967 by FBI agents tailing Roselli. Scores of wealthy men, including millionaire Harry Karl, the husband of actress Debbie Reynolds, and actor Zeppo Marx, were bilked out of millions of dollars. Grant B. Cooper represented some of the defendants in the case, including Roselli. Roselli was eventually convicted and fined $55,000. During the trial, secret grand jury transcripts were discovered on the defense attorney&#x27;s table. Cooper eventually pleaded guilty to contempt for possessing the documents.

In the 1960s, Immigration and Naturalization Service had also tried to deport Roselli, although were unsuccessful.

== 1970s ==
On June 24 and September 22, 1975, Roselli testified before the 1975 U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCIA) led by Idaho Senator Frank Church about the CIA plan to kill Castro, Operation Mongoose. Shortly before Roselli testified, an unknown person shot and killed Giancana in the basement of his Illinois home. This happened just days before Giancana was to testify before the committee. Giancana&#x27;s murder supposedly prompted Roselli to permanently leave Los Angeles and Las Vegas for Miami, Florida.

On April 23, 1976, Roselli was called before the committee to testify about a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy. Three months after his first round of testimony on the Kennedy assassination, the Committee wanted to recall Roselli. However, at this point, he had been missing since July 28. On August 3, Senator Howard Baker, a member of the new SSCIA, requested that the FBI investigate Roselli&#x27;s disappearance.

== Death ==
On August 7, 1976, ten days after his disappearance, Roselli&#x27;s decomposing body was found by a fisherman in a 55-gallon steel fuel drum floating in Dumfoundling Bay near Miami, Florida.
 He died of asphyxiation. Federal investigators suggested he may have been killed by Chicago mobsters for keeping an unfair share of the mob&#x27;s gambling interests in Las Vegas. At the behest of some members of the United States Senate, United States Attorney General Edward H. Levi instructed the FBI to find out if Roselli&#x27;s earlier testimony regarding the CIA plot to assassinate Castro may have led to his murder.
The FBI investigation summarized that Roselli was killed by Frank &quot;The German&quot; Schweihs, Vincent Incerro and two other suspects. The contract was sanctioned by the Chicago Outfit&#x27;s &quot;consigliere&quot; Anthony Accardo, because &quot;Roselli was becoming a public source of embarrassment to La Cosa Nostra&quot;.

==JFK conspiracy allegations==
After Roselli&#x27;s death, journalists Jack Anderson and Les Whitten published an editorial stating that Roselli had told associates that individuals he had been recruited to kill Castro but had been turned by the Cuban leader to assassinate President John F. Kennedy instead.

Bill Bonanno, the son of Cosa Nostra mafia boss Joseph Bonanno, claimed in his 1999 memoir, &quot;Bound by Honor: A Mafioso&#x27;s Story&quot;, that he had discussed the assassination of Kennedy with Roselli and implicated him as the primary hitman in a conspiracy instigated by the mob. According to Bonanno, Roselli fired at Kennedy from a storm drain on Elm Street. In 2006, the Discovery Channel aired an hour-long television documentary entitled &quot;Conspiracy Files:JFK&quot;. Based on information in the book &quot;Ultimate Sacrifice&quot; by Lamar Waldron, the program asserted that Roselli was responsible for framing Abraham Bolden who was arrested the day before he was to appear before the Warren Commission. In 2010, &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine published an article by Hillel Levin in which Roselli was also implicated in the assassination by Robert &quot;Tosh&quot; Plumlee and James Files, an inmate within the Illinois Department of Corrections.

== Popular culture ==
In the CBS television drama &quot;Vegas&quot;, the character from the Chicago Mob Johnny Rizzo, portrayed by Michael Wiseman, is loosely based on Johnny Roselli, as when Rizzo is introduced. Rizzo is in the Vegas black book and is not allowed to be in any casino. When Sheriff Ralph Lamb catches Rizzo in one, he demands that Rizzo leave. Rizzo, known for his temper, gets into a fight, and is easily subdued by Lamb. This is based on an actual event involving the real Sheriff Lamb and Roselli.

Roselli was portrayed by Chuck Shamata in the 2007 TNT miniseries &quot;The Company&quot;, which portrayed Roselli&#x27;s role in the CIA&#x27;s unsuccessful attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro. Tony Lo Bianco played Roselli in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Nixon&quot;.

Roselli and gangster Sam Giancana and their involvement with the CIA are the focus of a 2024 Paramount+ docuseries &quot;Mafia Spies&quot; based on the book by Thomas Maier.

<text>A chorus line is a large group of dancers who together perform synchronized routines, usually in musical theatre. Sometimes, singing is also performed. While synchronized dancing indicative of a chorus line was vogue during the first half of the 20th century, modern theatre uses the terms &quot;ensemble&quot; and &quot;chorus&quot; to indicate all supporting players in a stage production. 

== History ==
In the mid-1800s, chorus lines of cartwheeling, synchronized dancing can-can &quot;girls&quot; began sprouting up throughout Paris with even edgier, more erotic cabarets found in venues like the Moulin Rouge, Le Lido, and the Folies Bergẻre. By the late 1860s, the scandalous trend found its way to the United States with a more conservative trend of chorus lines hitting England, including Tiller Girls and Gaiety Girls. Chorus lines throughout Western Europe and the United States largely owned the stages of the early twentieth century. Chorus line dancers in early Broadway musicals and revues were referred to by slang terms such as &quot;ponies&quot;, &quot;gypsies&quot; and &quot;twirlies&quot;. 

Chorus lines hit vogue in the 1920s and 30s, as the life and possibilities of a &quot;chorus girl&quot; became sensationalized in fiction, newspapers, and film, capturing the imaginations of young women seeking independence, adventure, and a happily ever after. Real-life examples of the Cinderella narrative included Lilian Russel and Billie Dove, both of whom began their careers as chorus girls and married into wealth.

For women hoping to make a career out of performing, the chorus line was a common place of entry. Big names of the day like Paulette Goddard, Barbara Stanwyck, and Betty Grable are just some of the stars who began successful performing careers by joining a chorus line.

One of the most popular productions of the time was the Ziegfeld Follies, operating out of New York City, which was well-known for hiring only the most striking women for the chorus line. Florenz Ziegfeld Jr received the reputation of being able to objectively define and select exceptionally beautiful women. Ziegfeld&#x27;s standards, then, soon became the ideal, and publications and news articles circulated with headlines like, &quot;How I pick my Beauties&quot; and &quot;Picking out pretty girls for the stage&quot;.

Decades later, chorus lines of a more erotic flavor found huge success on America&#x27;s west coast in Las Vegas, before declining again in the face of competition from burlesque and strip clubs.

Some popular chorus lines found their way onto the golden screen. One group in particular was Samuel Goldwyn&#x27;s dancers, the Goldwyn Girls. Popping up in numerous MGM productions, the famous Goldwyn Girls included stars who went on to find great success on-screen like Lucille Ball, Virginia Mayo, and Jane Wyman.

To this day, some live performance venues keep the traditional chorus line alive with groups like The Rockettes, but more frequently the term &quot;chorus line&quot; in modern terms is used to differentiate supporting singers and dancers of any gender in a musical or musical revue from the lead actors or performers.

<doc id="773800" wikidata="Q2838183" url="?curid=773800" title="International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees">
<text>The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts of the United States, Its Territories and Canada, known as simply the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE or IA for short), is a North American labor union representing over 168,000 technicians, artisans, and craftspersons in the entertainment industry, including live theatre, motion picture and television production, broadcast and trade shows in the United States, its territories, and Canada. It was awarded the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre in 1993.

==Overview==
IATSE was founded in 1893 when representatives of stagehands working in eleven cities met in New York and pledged to support each other&#x27;s efforts to establish fair wages and working conditions for their members. IATSE has since evolved to embrace the development of new entertainment media, craft expansion, technological innovation and geographic growth.

Today, IATSE members work in all forms of live theater, motion picture and television production, trade shows and exhibitions, television broadcasting, and concerts as well as the equipment and construction shops that support all these areas of the entertainment industry. IATSE represents virtually all the behind-the-scenes workers in crafts ranging from motion picture animator to theater usher.

During a period when private sector union membership has been in sharp decline, IATSE has continued to grow. Since 1993, IATSE&#x27;s membership has increased from 74,344 to 160,000 which it attributes to its willingness to adapt its structure to protect traditional jurisdiction and accommodate new crafts.

==History==

===1886–1987===
In 1886, members of the Theatrical Protective Union of New York went on strike in New York City. After producers filled the positions of strikers with less skilled strikebreakers, actors refused to work due to sets falling apart. With the support of the actors behind the strikers, they succeeded in most of their requests.

In 1893, representatives of stagehands from eleven cities met in New York to discuss working conditions for their peers. They vowed to support each other in the effort to create an industry that would allow for fair wages and better working conditions. On June 17, 1893, the representatives officially formed the National Alliance of Theatrical Stage . In 1895, &quot;home rule&quot; was established. The alliance defined home rule as &quot;22 New York theatres for New York local members, Chicago theatres for Chicago (and so forth)... and no other members of locals allowed to work within the jurisdiction of other locals without (their) consent.&quot;

The Los Angeles Theatrical workers union (which had independently formed in 1891) joined NATSE in 1896. By 1898, the NATSE had welcomed two Canadian locals into the alliance: Montreal Local 56 and Toronto Local 58. In 1902, the alliance adopted &quot;International&quot; into its title.

In 1912, the union began a system that allowed individuals traveling with attractions to send basic information such as the size and length of time the local crews would be needed ahead to the next destination. This assured that there would be enough people to staff each theatre, and helped ensure these were union crews. The system is still in process today, and is referred to as the &quot;yellow card system&quot;.

IATSE was quickly becoming the preeminent theatrical union in North America after the Canadian Department of Labour listed theatrical locals in New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Calgary, Saskatchewan and Vancouver in 1928.

In June 1933, President Roosevelt signed legislation into law affecting all US workers: the National Recovery Act, creating the National Recovery Administration (NRA). The NRA&#x27;s first mission was to create a uniform system of codes to cover all of industry in the United States.
For months, the alliance participated in hearings to create an industrial code for the entertainment industry. Eventually, four different codes were established: Code of Fair Competition for the Motion Picture Industry; Code of Fair Competition for the Legitimate Full Length Dramatic and Musical Theatrical Industry; Code of Fair Competition for the Burlesque Theatrical Industry; and the Code of Fair Competition for the Motion Picture Laboratory Industry. The NRA shortened working hours to spread the work around, and set the first minimum wage level for stagehands. In 1938 the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed, including a provision that required studios to rearrange production schedules to fit the agreed-upon 44-hour work week (to be reduced to 40 over the following three years).

In 1940 the Canadian Picture Pioneers organization was formed, &quot;dedicated to the support and well-being of all members of the motion picture industry in Canada&quot;.

====Corruption in the early 20th century====
During the early 20th century, organized crime gained influence over parts of IATSE in collusion with employers. In June 1934, IATSE held an election with only one person running. The election was rigged by the soon-to-be elected President George Browne. The other two opponents in the running suddenly dropped from the race after death threats were received. Willie Bioff, another Chicago gangster, was instantly elected Browne&#x27;s &quot;personal representative&quot;.

Later that year Bioff went to Hollywood on behalf of IATSE. He used violent threats to discuss a private and limited contract with studios. These contracts included weak contracts and high dues. The studios liked the protection against the union. In 1941, Bioff and other mobsters were charged with corruption leading to union members attempting to remove them from power in IATSE. However, The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees remained corrupt and reverted to fraudulent negotiating practices. Some sources suggest that, in the later years, IATSE was &quot;more interested in breaking strikes than winning them&quot;.

===1988–current===

On November 6, 1996, the AICP (Association of Independent Commercial Producers, Inc.) and the IATSE signed the first-ever agreement between the two organizations. The agreement established the wages and working conditions applicable to motion picture and television production technicians and artisans employed in the production of television commercials, and was intended to recognize and address the special needs of the television commercial production process.

In 1998, the union&#x27;s name was lengthened to the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage , Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts of the United States, Its Territories and Canada, while maintaining the existing acronym. In the same year, the five departments were established: Stagecraft, Motion Picture and Television Production, Organizing, Trade Show and Display Work, and Canadian Affairs. In 2011 the Communications Department was established, and in 2012, the Organizing Department was folded into the Stagecraft Department, and two new departments were established: Education and Training, and Broadcast.

In 1999, IATSE established the IATSE Political Action Committee, a federal political action committee designed to support candidates for federal office who promote the interests of the members of the IATSE and its locals and to support a federal legislative and administrative agenda to benefit those members.

In 2001, IATSE changed the word &quot;&quot; in their name to &quot;Employees&quot; to reflect modern spelling.

The Labor Education Assistance Program (LEAP) was launched in 2009, which would pay tuition for labor studies courses taken by its local union officers. Following LEAP, the IA established the Training Trust to provide training opportunities in the areas of safety and skills development for IATSE members.

====Averted 2021 strike====
After passing an original July 31 deadline, as well as multiple extensions, negotiations between the IATSE and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) over the Hollywood Basic Agreement (covering the Los Angeles area) and the Area Standards Agreement (covering the rest of the country) broke down in September 2021. The IATSE demands include higher minimum wages, a minimum time period between the end of one day and the start of another, an end to the current classification of streaming as &quot;New Media&quot; with lower minimum wages, and measures to dissuade studios from skipping breaks for meals. Meanwhile, a trend towards production of both shorter seasons and fewer seasons overall has resulted in shorter production schedules and fewer chances for promotions. The hashtag #IALivingWage has gained traction with a public call for a US$25.08–$25.95 minimum wage. On September 21, the IATSE announced a &quot;nationwide strike authorization vote&quot;; each local needs to reach a vote threshold of 75 percent yes for approval. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on film and TV production, the unions were in a strong position; Paul Krugman of the &quot;New York Times&quot; opined that &quot;[t]he sellers&#x27; market in labor has also emboldened union members, who have been much more willing than usual to go on strike&quot;. The board of directors of the Editors Guild, IATSE Local 700, &quot;voted unanimously to recommend that Guild members vote yes in favor of a strike authorization vote&quot;. Similarly, the national executive board of the International Cinematographers Guild, IATSE Local 600, voted unanimously in favor of authorizing a strike.

Nationwide strike authorization votes were held from October 1 to 3. IATSE members voted 98.68 percent in favor of authorizing a strike, with ballots cast by 89.66 percent of eligible voters. Afterwards, on October 4, IATSE president Matthew Loeb said &quot;I hope that the studios will see and understand the resolve of our members... The ball is in their court.&quot; The AMPTP said in a statement that it &quot;remains committed to reaching an agreement that will keep the industry working&quot;.

Talks between the AMPTP and IATSE resumed on October 5 and continued through October 13. On October 9, Loeb informed IATSE members that either a deal or a strike would happen in &quot;a matter of days, not weeks&quot;. The national executive director of the Editors Guild, Cathy Repola, said on October 12 that &quot;the pace of negotiations does not reflect the urgency of the situation... the employers repeatedly refuse to do what it will take to achieve a fair deal&quot;. Barring a last-minute deal, the IATSE is set to begin its strike on October 18; a spokesman for the AMPTP said that with &quot;five days left to reach a deal... the studios will continue to negotiate in good faith in an effort to reach an agreement for a new contract that will keep the industry working.&quot;

Well-known media personalities in support of the IATSE include Jaimie Alexander, Stephanie Beatriz, Chloe Bennet, C. Robert Cargill, Ever Carradine, Matthew Cherry, Auliʻi Cravalho, Ava DuVernay, Frances Fisher, Jane Fonda, Courtney Ford, Karen Gillan, Lucy Hale, Jeremy O. Harris, Ron Howard, Joshua Jackson, Jameela Jamil, Barry Jenkins, Mindy Kaling, Alyssa Milano, Mandy Moore, Cynthia Nixon, Christopher Nolan, Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, Edward James Olmos, Anna Paquin, Sarah Paulson, Francia Raisa, Anthony Rapp, Ryan Reynolds, Seth Rogen, Susan Sarandon, Octavia Spencer, Steven Spielberg, Ben Stiller, Lily Tomlin, Kerry Washington, Bradley Whitford, Mae Whitman, Jeffrey Wright, and Rachel Zegler, as well as current and former SAG-AFTRA leaders including Fran Drescher, Rebecca Damon, Gabrielle Carteris, and Joely Fisher. WGA East said in a statement that &quot;[w]e work side by side with IATSE&#x27;s members and we stand shoulder to shoulder with them in their contract fight&quot;. After the strike authorization vote, the national board of directors of the Directors Guild of America said it &quot;stands in solidarity with our IATSE brothers, sisters and kin... We urge the producers and studios of the AMPTP to return to the bargaining table and make a fair deal addressing... critical issues.&quot; Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins supported the IATSE and planned to strike over dangerous working conditions days before her death in the 2021 &quot;Rust&quot; shooting incident.

Philippa Childs, head of the British entertainment union section BECTU, said the group was &quot;fully behind the strike&quot; and urged members in the event of a strike not to replace any striking IATSE members in the UK. In Australia, the MEAA said that the &quot;unity and determination to achieve change shown by IATSE members sets a benchmark for all of us&quot;.

Congressional Democrats, comprising 31 Senators and 87 Representatives, wrote to AMPTP president Carol Lombardini on September 30 to express support for &quot;the principles of adequate sleep, meal breaks[,] and living wages for all workers&quot;. Following the strike authorization vote, Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called the results &quot;an incredible accomplishment&quot; and &quot;exactly the kind of mass-movement organizing we need right now&quot;. Senator Raphael Warnock (D-GA) tweeted that IATSE workers &quot;are integral to Georgia&#x27;s economy and I support their fight to push for fair wages and benefits, which they deserve&quot;.

A strike would have affected productions everywhere in the United States, as Locals 600, 700, and 800, representing camera crews, editors, and art directors, respectively, are national organizations. However, not all production work would be affected by a strike: IATSE has a separate &quot;pay TV&quot; agreement in place with various production companies including BET, Cinemax, HBO, Showtime, and Starz, and similar agreements exist for other types of productions, including music videos, sports productions, one-off single productions, low-budget theatrical productions, animated works, and AICP-produced commercials. Broadway shows would also not be affected, and neither would post-production work for certain companies including Skywalker Sound, Tyler Perry Studios, and Vice Media.

The strike was temporarily averted on October 16, when a &quot;tentative agreement&quot; was reached between AMPTP and IATSE. The new three-year Hollywood Basic Agreement included 10-hour turnaround time between shifts, 54 and 32 hour weekend turnaround times, and 3% wage increases for each of the next three years. The deal also includes a &quot;living wage&quot; for the lowest-paid workers, improved wages and working conditions for streaming productions, and increased meal penalties. Negotiations continue for the Area Standards Agreement, and both contracts must be ratified by the union membership. On October 17, it was reported that many IATSE members would vote against the proposed agreement as it did not address their work conditions adequately.

The three-year contract was ratified by IATSE members on November 15, 2021, ending all prospects of a strike. A reported 72% of the 63,000 eligible members cast ballots. The vote was close, with a 256-188 delegate tally supporting the Basic Agreement and a 103-94 delegate tally in support for the Area Standards Agreement. However, more members actually voted against the deal with 50.4% of the voters against the Basic Agreement and 49.6% voting yes. For the Area Standards Agreement, 52% of members voted yes and 48% voted no.

==Membership==
The membership process of the IATSE varies widely depending on each local. In order to become a member, interested applicants must contact the appropriate local union in their jurisdiction that covers their particular craft. Once accepted, members work under union contracts that guarantee certain wages, hours, benefits, safety guidelines, and other agreements, and gain opportunities to upgrade skills and master new technologies relating to their craft. Additionally, IATSE members enjoy benefits from Union Plus, a program created by the AFL-CIO to provide savings and discounts to union members.

==Organization and structure==
Within the US and Canada, there are more than 375 IATSE local unions among 13 geographical districts, whose members make up the rank and file of the IATSE. The IATSE local unions are organized to represent workers by geographic and craft jurisdiction. Each craft falls under one of four departments: Stagecraft, Motion Picture and TV, Broadcast, and Tradeshow. The Canadian Department and Communications Department are two additional departments within the IA.

===International===
The IATSE International Union supports all individual local unions and members in numerous ways, including by:
* Coordinating the negotiation of nationwide agreements within the US and Canada,
* Planning for the future by setting policies to improve the effectiveness of the locals and the International,
* Providing support for local unions and members as needed, including everything from craft training and leadership education to local administration, organizing, and collective bargaining assistance.

The International&#x27;s General Executive Board is led by the International President. It consists of the General Secretary-Treasurer, and 13 International Vice-presidents. Of the Vice Presidents, two are designated to come from Canadian locals; one is designated to come from the West Coast Studio production locals; another, the Special Department locals; and the remainder are undesignated. Three International Trustees review the financial activities of the IATSE through semi-annual audits of the International&#x27;s books and records. Also on the Board is the Canadian Labour Congress Delegate, who serves as a liaison between the IA and the CLC, Canada&#x27;s umbrella organization for dozens of Canadian and international unions.

===Canada===
The Canadian Department oversees all IATSE Canadian affairs and supports the 16,000 Canadian members in 40 Locals through negotiations, training, and organizing.

The Canadian Department works with stage locals to organize more theaters, venues, and shows. Also involved in motion picture and tradeshow, the Canadian Department works closely with all other IATSE departments on international agreements with employers and provides education and training opportunities tailored for Canadian members. The department also provides support for Canadian members and locals, coordinates efforts on national initiatives with regards to benefits, legislation, political activism, lobbying, and more.

===Districts===
===US national charters===
* International Cinematographers Guild, Local 600
* Motion Picture Editors Guild, Local 700
* United Scenic Artists, Local USA829
* Art Directors Guild, Local 800

===Local unions===
Each local functions autonomously, maintaining their own Constitution and By-Laws, elections, dues structure, membership meetings, and more. Locals negotiate labor contracts regarding wages, work rules, and grievance procedures. They also provide services to their members by administering health and retirement funds and providing training and education. The IATSE local unions work for the interest of their membership, while also representing the overarching goals of the IATSE International.

====Stagecraft====
Stagecraft members work in venues that include Broadway theaters, opera houses, dance centers, regional theaters, seasonal outdoor amphitheaters, arenas, concert halls, parks, television awards venues, and stadiums. Additionally, the front-of-house workers, press agents, house managers, and other employees working in the business side of the venue (not the creative/technical side) may also be represented by IATSE However, this is not a set rule, and the employees covered by IATSE depends on the agreement made between IATSE and the venue.

====Motion picture and TV====
Members of the IATSE Motion Picture Division help create all elements of movies and television. Motion Picture and TV members build the sets, design the clothing, frame the image, record the dialogue, edit the scenes, and animate the characters to help bring a story to life. The IATSE also covers transportation in Canada excluding two provinces. Their work covers movies large and small, television shows, animated films and series, internet content, television shows across the dial – including children&#x27;s programming, reality, game, awards, and talk shows.

====Tradeshow====
As one of the newcomers to the entertainment world, the Convention and Tradeshow Industry has been enlarging its footprint over the last four decades. In that time, IATSE Stage and Exhibition Locals have been engaged in the installation and dismantling of local, national, and international Conventions and Tradeshows. More recently, the International&#x27;s Tradeshow Department has formalized its relationship with multi-national employers by initiating national agreements and standardizing conditions for workers in the industry.

====Broadcast====
The IATSE has represented workers in television broadcasting for over sixty years. Initially, IA members in the broadcast were employed primarily at local television stations. Beginning in 1998 the IATSE began to organize technicians engaged in telecasting live sports events over regional cable sports networks.
Today the Broadcast Department consists of numerous local unions that represent television station employees, locals that specialize in live sports broadcasting, and thousands of members working in broadcast from stage, studio mechanics, wardrobe and make-up artists, and hairstylist local unions. Broadcast technicians include technical directors, audio technicians, camera operators, video technicians, capture playback operators, editors, graphics artists, and utility technicians.

===Communications===
The Communications Department enhances and supports the IATSE by maintaining the IATSE&#x27;s website, social media channels, email program, and coordinating with other departments and Locals to disseminate information. Established in 2011, the Communications Department has set up an informal network of communication amongst Locals, and between Locals and the International. The Communications Department also creates educational materials to assist local unions and IATSE staff with modern communications methods and platforms.

===Education and training===
The Education &amp; Training Department facilitates and supports a culture of ongoing learning within the IATSE. Equally dedicated to leadership skills for union officers and craft skills and safety training for workers, the department sponsors and promotes union skills courses and workshops. It also works closely with the IATSE Training Trust Fund, ETCP, InfoComm, USITT, and others in order to help workers keep abreast of new technologies, equipment, and styles of work.

Additionally, the department operates outreach programs to high school and college students. The department was officially established in 2012, following the founding of the Labor Education Assistance Program (LEAP) in 2009. LEAP provides reimbursement money to officers of local unions who enroll in qualifying Labor Studies Programs.

==Historical office holders==
===Military Governments (1911)===


Beginning with the Wuchang Uprising on 11 October 1911 and in the following two months, provincial military governments declared their independence from the Qing Empire under the name &quot;Republic of China.&quot; On 30 November 1911, the &quot;Central Military Government of the Republic of China&quot; was established under the leadership of Li Yuanhong.

===Provisional Government of the Republic of China (Nanjing, 1912; Beijing, 1912–1913)===
Provisional President of the Republic of China (臨時大總統):
*Sun Yat-sen (1 January 1912 - 10 March 1912)
*Yuan Shikai (10 March 1912 - 10 October 1913)

The &quot;Republic of China&quot; was formally proclaimed on 1 January 1912 and Sun Yat-sen took office in Nanking (now Nanjing) as the first provisional president. Sun resigned on March 10 and was succeeded by Qing Empire Prime Minister Yuan Shikai. This moved the government to Beijing.

===Government of the Republic of China (Beijing, 1913–1928)===
Yuan Shikai enacted a new Constitution to greatly expand his powers as president and abolish the National Assembly. Sun Yat-sen and his supporters responded with the failed Second Revolution and were subsequently exiled. The later ROC governments under the KMT (and the current People&#x27;s Republic of China government) considers the Beiyang Government after this point to be illegitimate.
*Yuan Shikai (10 October 1913 - 22 December 1915)
Yuan Shikai declared himself Emperor on 22 December 1915. Popular opposition led Yuan to retract his declaration on 22 March 1916.
*Yuan Shikai (22 March 1916 - 6 June 1916)
*Li Yuanhong (7 June 1916 - 1 July 1917)
Yuan died in 1916 and was succeeded by Vice President Li Yuan-hung. Warlord Zhang Xun restored Puyi to the throne for twelve days from July 1 to 12 July 1917. The Republican government was soon restored, but local warlords forced Li from office.
*Li Yuanhong (12 July 1917 - 17 July 1917)
*Feng Guozhang (17 July 1917 - 10 October 1918)

*&quot;Hu Weide (20 Apr 1926 - 13 May 1926) (acting)&quot;
*&quot;Yan Huiqing (13 May 1926 - 22 Jun 1926) (acting)&quot;

*&quot;Wellington Koo (1 Oct 1926 - 18 Jun 1927) (acting)&quot;

The Beiyang Government was extinguished by the Northern Expedition led by the Kuomintang.

===Military Government (Guangzhou, 1917–1925)===
The Chinese Revolutionary Party established a rival government in Guangzhou and declared legitimacy over the &quot;warlord&quot; government in Beijing (which they renamed Beiping since &quot;jing&quot; means &quot;capital&quot;).

Generalissimo of the Military Government (海陸軍大元帥):
*Sun Yat-sen (10 September 1917 - 5 July 1918)

The Military Government was headed collectively by the Governing Committee of the Military Government (5 July 1918 - 21 August 1918), viz., 
*Sun Yat-sen
*Tang Shaoyi
*Wu Tingfang
*Cen Chunxuan
*Lu Rongting
*Tang Jiyao

In 1918, Sun Yat-sen and his government was forced out of Guangdong by warlords. The Military Government was consolidated by Chairman of the Governing Committee (主席總裁):
*Cen Chunxuan (21 August 1918 - 24 October 1920)

Sun Yat-sen and his supporters were restored in Guangzhou with the help of local warlord Chen Jiongming in 1920. On 24 October 1920 to 4 May 1921, figurehead duties were again given collectively to the Governing Committee of the Military Government, viz., 
*Sun Yat-sen
*Tang Shaoyi
*Wu Tingfang
*Tang Jiyao.

Sun Yat-sen was elected &quot;President&quot; by remnants of the 1912 National Assembly, but since this parliament lacked the quorum established by the 1912 Constitution, he took the title of Extraordinary President (非常大總統):
*Sun Yat-sen (5 May 1921 - 29 June 1922)
In 1922, Sun was expelled from Guangdong by Chen Jiongming.

Sun Yat-sen was restored in Guangdong in 1923 and established the National Government with the help of the Comintern.

Generalissimo of the Military Government (海陸軍大元帥):

===Reformed National Government (Nanjing, 1938–1940)===
The Reformed National Government was established as a Japanese collaborationist government established under occupation.
Acting Chairman of the Reformed National Government:
*Liang Hongzhi (28 March 1938 - 30 March 1940)

===National Government (Nanjing, 1940–1945)===
A National Government, as a challenge to the legitimacy of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s National Government in Chongqing, was established as a Japanese collaborationist government established under occupation. As evidence of its claims to legitimacy, the government in Nanjing established the same set of institutions as the one in Chongqing and flew an almost-identical flag. This replaced the Provisional and Reformed National Governments.
Chairmen of the National Government (國民政府主席):
*Wang Jingwei (30 March 1940 - 10 November 1944)

Li Zongren had left for the United States in November 1949 and Chiang officially resumed his powers in March 1950. This regime remained the internationally recognized true government of China with sovereignty throughout mainland China, Taiwan, Tibet Area, Sinkiang and Outer Mongolia until recognition shifted to the People&#x27;s Republic of China by the United Nations in 1971 and the United States in 1979.

<doc id="773812" wikidata="Q1886157" url="?curid=773812" title="Yabusame">
<text>is a type of mounted archery in traditional Japanese archery. An archer on a running horse shoots three special &quot;turnip-headed&quot; arrows successively at three wooden targets.

This style of archery has its origins at the beginning of the Kamakura period. Minamoto no Yoritomo became alarmed at the lack of archery skills his samurai possessed. He organized yabusame as a form of practice.

Nowadays, the best places to see yabusame performed are at the Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū in Kamakura and Shimogamo Shrine in Kyoto (during Aoi Matsuri in early May). It is also performed in Samukawa and on the beach at Zushi, as well as other locations.

== History ==
Japanese bows date back to prehistoric times – the Jōmon period. The long, unique asymmetrical bow style with the grip below the center emerged under the Yayoi culture (300 BC – 300 AD). Bows became the symbol of authority and power. The legendary first emperor of Japan, Emperor Jimmu, is always depicted carrying a bow.

Some Emishi tribes, notably the Hitakami tribe, practice horse archery and were noticed and feared by the Yamato court.

The use of the bow had been on foot until around the 4th century when elite soldiers took to fighting on horseback with bows and swords. In the 10th century, samurai would have archery duels on horseback. They would ride at each other and try to shoot at least three arrows. These duels did not necessarily have to end in death, as long as honor was satisfied.

One of the most celebrated incidents of Japanese mounted archery occurred during the Genpei War (1180–1185), an epic struggle for power between the Minamoto and Taira clans that was to have a major impact on Japanese culture, society, and politics.

At the Battle of Yashima, the Heike (Taira), having been defeated in battle, fled to Yashima and took to their boats. They were fiercely pursued by the Genji (Minamoto) on horseback, but the Genji were halted by the sea.

As the Heike waited for the winds to be right, they presented a fan hung from a mast as a target for any Genji archer to shoot at in a gesture of chivalrous rivalry between enemies.

One of the Genji samurai, Nasu no Yoichi, accepted the challenge. He rode his horse into the sea and shot the fan cleanly through. This feat is still celebrated to this day.

During the Kamakura period (1192–1334), mounted archery was used as a military training exercise to keep samurai prepared for war. Those archers who did poorly might find themselves commanded to commit seppuku, or ritual suicide.

One style of mounted archery was inuoumono – shooting at dogs. Buddhist priests were able to prevail upon the samurai to have the arrows padded so that the dogs were only annoyed and bruised rather than killed. This sport is no longer practised.

==Ritual==
Yabusame was designed as a way to please and entertain the myriad of gods that watch over Japan, thus encouraging their blessings for the prosperity of the land, the people, and the harvest.

A yabusame archer gallops down a track at high speed. The archer mainly controls his horse with his knees, as he needs both hands to draw and shoot his bow. As he approaches a target, he brings his bow up and draws the arrow past his ear before letting the arrow fly with a deep shout of In-Yo-In-Yo (darkness and light). The arrow is blunt and round-shaped in order to make a louder sound when it strikes the board.

Experienced archers are allowed to use arrows with a V-shaped prong. If the board is struck, it will splinter with a confetti-like material and fall to the ground. To hit all three targets is considered an admirable accomplishment. Yabusame targets and their placement are designed to ritually replicate the optimum target for a lethal blow on an opponent wearing full traditional samurai armor (O-Yoroi) which left the space just beneath the helmet visor bare.

Yabusame is characterized as a ritual rather than a sport because of its solemn style and religious aspects, and is often performed for special ceremonies or official events, such as entertaining foreign dignitaries and heads of state. Yabusame demonstrations have been given for the formal visits of US Presidents Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. A yabusame demonstration was given in the United Kingdom for Prince Charles, who reportedly was fascinated and pleased with the performance.

To be selected as a yabusame archer is a great honor. In the past, they were chosen from only the best warriors. The archer who performs the best is awarded a white cloth, signifying divine favor.

==Schools==
There are two schools of mounted archery that perform yabusame. One is the Ogasawara school. The founder, Ogasawara Nagakiyo, was instructed by the &quot;shōgun&quot; Minamoto no Yoritomo (1147–1199) to start a school for archery. Yoritomo wanted his warriors to be highly skilled and disciplined. Archery was seen as a good way for instilling the necessary principles for a samurai warrior.

Zen became a major element in both foot and mounted archery as it also became popular among the samurai in every aspect of their life during the Kamakura period.

Yabusame as a martial art helped a samurai learn concentration, discipline, and refinement. Zen taught breathing techniques to stabilize the mind and body, giving clarity and focus. To be able to calmly draw one&#x27;s bow, aim, and shoot in the heat of battle, and then repeat, was the mark of a true samurai who had mastered his training and his fear.

The other archery school was begun earlier by Minamoto no Yoshiari in the 9th century at the command of Emperor Uda. This school became known as the Takeda school of archery. The Takeda style has been featured in classic samurai films such as Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (1954) and &quot;Kagemusha&quot; (1980). Toshiro Mifune, was a noted student of the Takeda school.

==Decline and revival==
With the arrival of the Portuguese and their guns in the mid-16th century, the bow began to lose its importance on the battlefield. At the Battle of Nagashino in 1575, well-placed groups of musketeers serving Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa fired in volleys and practically annihilated the cavalry charges of the Takeda clan.

Mounted archery was revived in the Edo period (1600–1867) by Ogasawara Heibei Tsuneharu (1666–1747) under the command of the shogun Tokugawa Yoshimune (1684–1751). Given that the nation was at peace, archery as well as other military martial arts became more of a method of personal development rather than military training.

== Contemporary practice ==

Yabusame is held at various times of the year, generally near Shinto shrines. On the 2nd Sunday of April every year, there is a Yabusame ceremony held at the Washibara Hachiman-gū shrine in Tsuwano, Shimane. At this ceremony, the Ogasawara school performs Yabusame at the oldest Yabusame Horse Archery range in Japan. 
In May, the Aoi Matsuri (Hollyhock festival) in Kyoto includes yabusame. Other locations include Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū in Kamakura, together with Samukawa and on the beach at Zushi.

<text>Carroll College is a private Catholic college in Helena, Montana. The college has 21 buildings on a 63-acre campus, has over 35 academic majors, participates in 15 NAIA athletic sports, and is home to All Saints Chapel. The college motto, in Latin, is &quot;“Non scholae, sed vitae.”&quot; The college translates this into English as “Not for school, but for life.” Carroll&#x27;s colors are purple and gold and the school&#x27;s athletics teams are known as the Fighting Saints.

==History==
In 1883, the first bishop of Helena, John Baptist Brondel, proposed a Catholic college in Montana to help produce future priests for the soon-to-be diocese of Helena. He died before his plans could be realized. Pope Pius X selected John Patrick Carroll, a young priest from Dubuque, Iowa, as Brondel&#x27;s successor.

Bishop John Patrick Carroll, second Bishop of the Diocese of Helena, was able to carve out the funding needed to launch the college while at the same time raising money to construct the Cathedral of St. Helena. In 1909, William Howard Taft, 27th President of the United States, helped lay the cornerstone of St. Charles Hall at the college.

The college was founded on September 27, 1909, by John Patrick Carroll, second Bishop of the Diocese of Helena, Montana. It was originally called Mount St. Charles College to honor St. Charles Borromeo. The intent was for it to be an all-men&#x27;s liberal arts college, with an emphasis on preparing men for careers in the priesthood, law, medicine, teaching, and engineering. In his speech after the laying the cornerstone of St. Charles Hall, President William Howard Taft said, &quot;The college you are building here will be a blessing to Helena and to the whole state of Montana. The only trouble is we have not institutions enough of this kind in the United States.&quot;

In September 1910, Mount Saint Charles College opened its doors for classes. The first college student graduated in 1916. In 1932, the school&#x27;s name was changed to Carroll College in honor of its founder.

During the 1935 Helena earthquake, Carroll College suffered only minor damage, while many other buildings and schools in the city were greatly affected. Property damage was estimated at half a million dollars. The top of the gable wall on the southern portion of St. Charles Hall was damaged and many of the structure&#x27;s large stones had fallen off. The college decided to replace the roof with a slightly shorter and flatter roof.

The fallen stones were repurposed and used to build an observatory on campus. Carroll College&#x27;s Neuman Observatory, named after former chemistry professor Edward Neuman, is the oldest astronomical observatory in the state of Montana.

During World War II, Carroll College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program; it offered students a path to a Navy commission. After the war, the college began a period of expansion that included enrolling many military veterans under the GI Bill. It later admitted the first female students, and was transformed by changes resulting from the Second Vatican Council.

The 1989 Helena train wreck caused significant damage to Carroll, notably to Guadalupe Hall, the women&#x27;s dormitory at the time.

==Student life==
Carroll College has a female-to-male student ratio of nearly 3:2 (60%/40%). Montana residents comprise just under half of the total student body (Montana/Out-of-State: 45%/55%). Of students reporting a religious preference, 44% are Catholic. From an admissions standpoint, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; indicates Carroll as being &quot;more selective&quot; with an average incoming GPA of 3.46, an ACT of 25, an average SAT (before March 1, 2016) of 1645, and an average SAT (after March 1, 2016) of 1145. Tuition and fees for the 2023 academic year are $37,828. Out-of-state tuition is the same as the original tuition. Total estimated attendance (with room and board) is approximately $40,220.

Carroll has over 35 active student clubs or student groups that host nearly 350 events annually. Groups include CAMP, or Carroll Adventuring and Mountaineers Program, Carroll Crazies, Up &#x27;Til Dawn, Saints&#x27; Swing Dance Society, Engineers Without Borders, Carroll Student Activities (CSA), and Carroll Outreach Team. 

CAMP offers mountain biking, kayaking, trail running, hiking, backpacking, cross country skiing, downhill skiing, and more. CAMP provides trips for students to explore the outdoors during academic breaks, such as a spring break to Moab, Utah. The Carroll College newspaper, &quot;The Prospector&quot;&quot;,&quot; is student-run and student-written.

==Academics==
Carroll College offers numerous academic majors in the major liberal arts and life sciences, as well as engineering, education, computer science, nursing, physics, ROTC, and theology. The school offers as well as several medical pre-professional programs including pre-seminary, pre-med, pre-dental, pre-pharmacy and pre-veterinary. The school is known for a higher than average rate of acceptance of its students into medical school. The national average medical school acceptance rate is approximately 44%. Carroll College students have an 85% average acceptance into med school and dental school. Unique to the college is a Human-Animal Bond Program, now anthrozoology. It offered the first such undergraduate degree in the US.

The college is ranked by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; as the #1 Regional College in the West in the 2021 edition of America&#x27;s Best Colleges. Carroll College has held the #1 ranking for 10 consecutive years.

==Campus==
Carroll College has four residence halls on campus. These are Trinity Hall, Borromeo Hall, Guadalupe Hall, and St. Charles Hall. Additionally, Carroll has on-campus apartments open to 3rd year students and above. Carroll has community advisors on every floor of every residence hall. Among their duties are creating events for members of his or her floor.

The football stadium is known as Nelson Stadium. In 2017, the Hunthausen Activity Center (HAC) will house student recreation and fitness. The Student Center is informally known as &quot;The Cube,&quot; derived from &quot;Carroll Campus Center,&quot; or C-cubed.

Simperman Hall houses classrooms, science labs, and offices for professors. Wiegand Amphitheater, located in Simperman Hall, seats approximately 140 students, and student groups sometimes show movies for the student body. Built in 1979, the Corette Library houses classrooms, computer labs, study rooms, conference rooms, and a small auditorium. It is open to the general public for use. St. Charles has classrooms, professors&#x27; offices, a small chapel, and the president&#x27;s office and staff. In addition, the Artaza center—the center for global education—is located in St. Charles. On the fourth floor of St. Charles is the bouldering wall, open to students to climb.

Old North, the north wing of St. Charles, was a gymnasium for Mount St. Charles College. Old North was deconstructed and rebuilt as All Saints Chapel, finished in 2017. St. Albert&#x27;s Hall holds the alumni and development office. The Civil Engineering building has a fully equipped lab, and the engineering department hosts occasional barbecues.

==Athletics==
The Carroll athletic teams are called the Fighting Saints. The college is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Frontier Conference since the 1935–36 academic year.

Carroll competes in 15 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer and track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor); while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball.

===Football===
The Carroll Fighting Saints football team began playing in 1920 and is one of the most successful programs in the NAIA division of college football. The team has won 11 straight Frontier Conference Championships (2000–2011), ten national final appearances, including six straight (2000–2005, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011), and six NAIA National Football Championships in ten years (2002–2005, 2007, 2010). The 1931 football team was undefeated, untied, and unscored upon and finished the season as state champions. The Fighting Saints were also the first collegiate coaching home for John Gagliardi, known as the winningest coach in all of college football (regardless of division). Gagliardi coached at Carroll for four years before moving to St. John&#x27;s University in Minnesota, where he coached them for 60 seasons.

===Facilities===
Nelson Stadium is home to the football and soccer teams; the PE Center hosts basketball and volleyball games along with several other community events; the Green Meadow Country Club is home to the golf teams; Helena&#x27;s Centennial Park hosts the softball team&#x27;s home games; and the track &amp; field teams host events at Helena&#x27;s Vigilante Stadium.

<text>Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War (SUVCW) is an American congressionally chartered fraternal organization that carries out activities to preserve the history and legacy of the United States Armed Forces veterans who fought during the Civil War. It is the legal successor to the Grand Army of the Republic, the large and influential grouping of Union Army veterans that existed in the decades following the Civil War. Most SUVCW activities occur at the &quot;Camp&quot; or local community level. Camps are grouped into state or regional structures called &quot;Departments&quot;. The National organization, with headquarters at the National Civil War Museum in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, meets annually in a National Encampment that is attended by SUVCW members, known as &quot;Brothers&quot;, from all Camps and Departments.

SUVCW and its subordinate structures are charitable 501(c)(3) organizations.

==History==

=== Late 19th century ===

SUVCW, named initially the &quot;Sons of Veterans of the United States of America&quot;, was founded by Major Augustus P. Davis in November 1881 to ensure the preservation of principles of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) and to provide assistance to veterans. It is based on the principles of Fraternity, Charity, and Loyalty.

In July 1877, Davis made his first proposal to create an organization of sons of GAR members to General Alexander Hayes GAR Post 3 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The members rejected his idea, but Davis was persistent. Finally, in September 1881, Post 3 members took a neutral position on Davis&#x27; proposal, removing any formal obstacle to pursuing his vision. Davis wanted to organize the sons of GAR members into a military-style organization whose objectives were similar to those of the GAR and whose members would assist those in the GAR. He proposed that membership be limited to a GAR member&#x27;s eldest living son. He envisioned a fraternal, patriotic, and charitable organization and an organized military reserve to be called upon in times of war. SV Members wore military-style uniforms and practiced tactics and drills.

Major Davis stated his vision for the SV as follows:

&quot;The Sons of Veterans is destined to become the great military organization of the country, that glory of its supremacy, that healing of the sense when its National hymn are sung that none other not thus reared can know or feel. Through this organization the declining days of the Union Veteran will be made pleasant, his record of service to his country preserved, his memory honored, patriotism promoted. While if the dire necessity of the Nation should dictate, the Sons of Veterans, uniformed, drilled and equipped would come at once to her defense with the glory of their fathers surrounding them, each heart pulsating in unison with the rising and falling of the Nation&#x27;s emblem. And who would be powerful enough to prevail against such a host?&quot;
He held the organization&#x27;s first meeting on November 12, 1881, in GAR Post 3 meeting room at Pittsburgh&#x27;s Old City Hall, which was destroyed by fire six months later. He assembled a group of 11 boys who adopted his proposed constitution, rules, regulations, and ritual to form the Sons of Veterans of Pennsylvania (SVPA). They elected officers, and Davis filed the Articles of Incorporation for SVPA on December 28, 1881. The articles were approved the same day by the Court of Common Pleas, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania approved the charter on January 12, 1882.

Meanwhile, a competing organization was forming in eastern Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia Sons of Veterans (PSV). The PSV was started on September 29, 1878, when Anna M. Ross Camp Number 1 was founded in Philadelphia by James P. Holt of Anna Ross GAR Post 94. On October 15, 1878, a planning committee from the new Camp presented a proposed constitution and rules to Post 94, which approved the PSV proposals. Other posts in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York likewise established cadet corps.

In 1879 the Earp family formed Sons of Veterans Camps in Massachusetts, Missouri, and New Jersey. In July 1880, these Camps disbanded, and their members joined PSV Camps. PSV soon formed a Divisional (state-level) organization.

On February 22, 1882, PSV established a national organization, following the request of the Camps started by the Earp family that had not been accounted for in the Division formations of PSV in 1880. A month later, the SVPA changed its name to Sons of Veterans of the United States of America (SV) to better reflect its nationwide status and growth. Major Davis devoted considerable time, energy, and money to expanding the organization. SV Camps were formed throughout Pennsylvania, Eastern Ohio, Northern West Virginia, and Southern New York. By mid-year, the need for a formal organization within Pennsylvania became clear. On July 4, 1882, the Division of Pennsylvania was created, and the first SV Encampment was held in Pittsburgh.

Throughout the summer of 1882, SV continued to grow. By the fall, there was a pressing need for a national organization. On October 18, 1882, the first SV National Encampment was held in Pittsburgh. The constitution, rules, and regulations proposed by Davis were adopted. As of July 1, 1884, the organization had grown to a membership of more than 20,000. In July 1883, a special meeting of PSV was held in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Because of disagreement among the camps arising from failure to issue charters and incorrect record keeping, 33 PSV camps withdrew from that organization and joined SV.

In August 1886, the two remaining Camps faithful to PSV joined SV, ending PSV. Membership in the SV grew rapidly, and at the 1890 national encampment, it was reported that the organization boasted more than 145,000 members. GAR membership at the time numbered about 400,000. 

The SV maintained a somewhat complex relationship with the GAR. While GAR members generally believed there should be a worthy organization for their sons to join, they thought GAR membership should be limited to veterans. The GAR approved the SV, but it would not make the SV part of the GAR. On July 25, 1883, the GAR National Encampment recognized SV as &quot;entitled to the confidence and support of all comrades of the Grand Army of the Republic.&quot; The final and complete acceptance by the GAR came in 1888.

In his report to the National Encampment of the GAR, then-Commander-in-Chief John P. Rea stated:

&quot;It will be but a short period until our ranks are so meager and the surviving Comrades so weighed down with the burden of years that our organization will have ceased to be an active force in the work of loyal love and charity which it has ordained. The tender ceremonies of Memorial Day will then be performed by others or not at all. It seems to me that it would be the part of wisdom for us while yet in our vigor to establish such relationship between our Order and the Sons of Veterans as to properly recognize the organization.&quot;

As a result of Rea&#x27;s presentation, the GAR adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED: &quot;That this encampment endorse the objects and purposes of the Order of Sons of Veterans of the United States of America and hereby give the Order the official recognition of the Grand Army of the Republic and recommend that Comrades aid and encourage the institution of Camps of the Sons of Veterans of the USA.&quot;

=== 20th century ===

In 1903, the Sons of Veterans&#x27; civil and military functions were divided. A new organization called the Sons of Veterans Reserve (SVR) was formed, which conducted military training. SVR was not a state militia organization, so it was not integrated into the National Guard in the early 20th century. Today SVR serves as the uniformed ceremonial component of SUVCW, and only SUVCW members in good standing can become members of SVR.

Membership in SV peaked in 1904 when it was reported at more than 200,000. This occurred during many reconciliation celebrations involving white veterans of the Civil War.

In 1925 members adopted the organization&#x27;s current name, Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War. Sons of veterans of the Spanish-American and First World wars attempted to join, but members decided that SUVCW would be exclusively for descendants of United States Armed Forces veterans of the Civil War.
On February 13, 1954, Albert Woolson, the last surviving member of the GAR, deeded all remaining property to SUVCW. He wrote:

&quot;The meaning and intent of this conveyance is to convey to said Commander-in-Chief, Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War, all post and department records of the Grand Army of the Republic and it is my express wish and desire that said Grantee shall use its best endeavors to return said records to the Communities where Grand Army posts were located, so far as possible, for the use and benefit of the Communities where such posts were located.&quot;

On August 20, 1954, Congress enacted Public Law 605, which incorporated SUVCW with a congressional charter. Among the incorporators were General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, son of Arthur MacArthur Jr., who received the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of Missionary Ridge, and Major General Ulysses S. Grant III, grandson of Ulysses S. Grant, commanding general of the United States Army during the Civil War and 18th president of the United States.

=== 21st century ===
As of early 2021, SUVCW has 31 Departments and more than 240 community-based Camps. Membership stands at approximately 6,400 men. The organization is headed by a Commander-in-Chief, elected annually during the National Encampment for a one-year term. In collaboration with members of the SUVCW Council of Administration, the Commander-in-Chief is responsible for the organization&#x27;s overall operations.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to protect the health and well-being of its members, SUVCW held its first-ever virtual Annual National Encampment on October 24, 2020.

In 2017, the Internal Revenue Service of the United States Government granted SUVCW and all of its subordinate structures (Camps, Departments, SVR Military Districts, and SVR Units) tax-exempt status under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3), meaning that donors can deduct from their federal tax returns contributions made to SUVCW or its subordinate structures and that SUVCW and its subordinate structures are qualified to receive tax-deductible bequests, legacies, devises, transfers, and gifts.

SUVCW played an active and high-profile role during many events organized nationwide and worldwide between 2011 and 2015 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Civil War.

== Membership ==
Full membership in the SUVCW is open to any man, 14 years of age and older (6 to 14 for Junior members), who:

Associate membership is available to men who do not have the ancestry to qualify for hereditary membership but who demonstrate a genuine interest in the Civil War and agree to support the purpose and objectives of the SUVCW and is still subject to the second and third provisions of hereditary eligibility.

== Auxiliary organizations ==
The &quot;Auxiliary to the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War (ASUVCW)&quot; was first organized in 1883 and by 1894 had adopted its current name. Membership is open to women who are lineal or collateral descendants of soldiers, sailors, or marines regularly mustered and honorably discharged from the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, or Revenue Cutter Service/Coast Guard during the Civil War. Additionally, membership is open to mothers, wives, widows, daughters, and legally adopted daughters of SUVCW members. Associate memberships are available to women who do not qualify through their lineal or collateral heritage but who demonstrate a genuine interest in the Civil War and can subscribe to the purpose and objects of the Auxiliary. Junior Membership is open to young ladies at least eight years of age.

In addition to SUVCW and ASUVCW, three other organizations comprise the Allied Orders of the Grand Army of the Republic. These organizations are: 1) the &quot;Daughters of Union Veterans of the Civil War&quot; (DUVCW), 2) the &quot;Ladies of the Grand Army of the Republic&quot; (LGAR), and 3) the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Relief Corps&quot; (WRC).

<doc id="773821" wikidata="Q1459010" url="?curid=773821" title="Northwest Airlines Flight 255">
<text>On August 16, 1987, a McDonnell Douglas MD-82, operating as Northwest Airlines Flight 255, crashed shortly after takeoff from Detroit Metropolitan Airport, about 8:46 pm EDT (00:46 UTC August 17), resulting in the deaths of all six crew members and 148 of the 149 passengers, along with two people on the ground. The sole survivor was a 4-year-old girl who sustained serious injuries. It was the second-deadliest aviation accident at the time in the United States. It is also the deadliest aviation accident to have a sole survivor, the deadliest aircraft accident in the history of the state of Michigan, and the worst crash in the history of Northwest Airlines.

==Background==
=== Aircraft ===
The aircraft involved was a twin-engined McDonnell Douglas MD-82 (registration number N312RC), a derivative of the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 and part of the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 series of aircraft. The jet was manufactured in 1981, entered service with Republic Airlines, and was acquired by Northwest Airlines in its merger with Republic in 1986. The aircraft was powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-217 turbofan engines.

=== Crew ===
Flight 255&#x27;s captain was 57-year-old John R. Maus, from Las Vegas, Nevada. Maus was an experienced pilot who had worked for the airline for 31 years, flying Fairchild F-27, Boeing 727, Boeing 757, McDonnell Douglas DC-9, and McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft. Maus had logged 20,859 flight hours during his career, including 1,359 hours on the MD-82. Other pilots who had flown with Maus described him as a &quot;competent and capable pilot&quot; who had a reputation for operating &quot;by the book&quot;.

The flight&#x27;s first officer was 35-year-old David J. Dodds, from Galena, Illinois. Dodds had logged 8,044 flight hours during his career (including 1,604 hours on the MD-82), and had worked for the airline for more than eight years. Other than one training report during his probationary period, all of the airline&#x27;s captains with whom Dodds had flown graded him as average or above average. Other pilots who had recently flown with Dodds later described his performance 
in favorable terms. 

Four flight attendants were also on board.

==Accident==

The flight crew began August 16, 1987, by operating the incident aircraft as Northwest Flight 750 from Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport, flying to MBS International Airport in Saginaw, Michigan. Departing Saginaw, the flight crew operated the same aircraft as Flight 255, flying to John Wayne Airport in Santa Ana, California, with intermediate stops scheduled at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport in Romulus, Michigan (near Detroit), and Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in Arizona. Other than a minor problem taxiing to the arrival gate, the flight from Saginaw to Detroit was uneventful. During the stopover in Detroit, a Northwest Airlines mechanic inspected the aircraft and the logbook. Around 20:29, the flight crew took their seats. At roughly 20:32 EDT, Flight 255 departed the gate in Detroit with 149 passengers (including 21 children) and six crew members. The crew read out the before-start checklist, and started the engines at 20:33:04. The total weight of the airliner was with a maximum allowable weight of .

At 20:34:40, the pushback tug was disconnected from the aircraft and at 20:34:50, the controller cleared Flight 255 to taxi to runway number 3C (center). The crew was also informed about the update of the automatic terminal information service information, to which Dodds reported on weather data update. At 20:35:43, the ground controller instructed to use taxiway C and switch to frequency 119.45 MHz to communicate with another controller. Dodds acknowledged the instructions to follow the taxiways, but did not repeat the new frequency and did not tune the radio to it. The dispatch packet provided by the airline included takeoff performance data based on using runways 21L or 21R, but the flight was cleared for takeoff on Detroit&#x27;s runway 3C, the shortest available runway. The flight crew had to reconfigure the on-board computer for taking off on runway 3C. Dodds also recalculated the allowable takeoff weight for the flight, and concluded that it was within normal limits. In the process of taxiing, Flight 255 missed the required turn, so Dodds contacted the ground controller and received instructions on how to proceed to runway 3C, and also to switch to 119.45 MHz. Dodds again acknowledged the instructions and this time acknowledged the new frequency and switched to it. The second ground controller specified the route to runway 3C. The crew also received a brief weather report.

At 20:42:11, Flight 255 was instructed to position and hold at the beginning of runway 3C. The controller advised that a 3-minute delay was needed to allow the wake turbulence from the previous aircraft that had taken off to dissipate. At 20:44:04, Flight 255 was cleared for takeoff.

Flight 255 made its takeoff roll on Detroit&#x27;s runway 3C at 20:44:21, with Maus at the controls, as recorded on the aircraft&#x27;s cockpit voice recorder (CVR):

The plane lifted off the runway at , and began to roll from side to side just under above the ground. The MD-82&#x27;s rate of climb was greatly reduced as a result of the flaps not being extended, and about past the end of runway 3C, the plane&#x27;s left wing struck a light pole in an airport rental car lot. The impact caused the left wing to start disintegrating and catch fire. The plane rolled 90° to the left, striking the roof of an Avis Car Rental building. The now uncontrolled plane crashed inverted onto Middlebelt Road and struck vehicles just north of its intersection with Wick Road, killing two people on the ground in a car. It then broke apart, with the fuselage skidding across the road, disintegrating and bursting into flames as it hit a Norfolk Southern railroad overpass and the overpass of eastbound Interstate 94.

==Victims==
All of the 6 crew and 148 of the 149 passengers were killed in the accident. Many of the passengers were from the Phoenix metropolitan area; one of them was Nick Vanos, an NBA center for the Phoenix Suns. Among the deceased were five foreigners: three Britons, one Bahamian and one Guyanese. Two motorists on nearby Middlebelt Road also perished and five people on the ground were injured, one seriously. The bodies were moved to the Northwest hangar at the airport, which served as a temporary morgue.

==Passengers==
Of the 149 passengers aboard, 21 were children, the youngest being six months old. The sole survivor of the crash was Cecelia Cichan, a four-year-old girl from Tempe, Arizona, who was returning home alongside her mother, Paula, father, Michael, and a six-year-old brother, David, after visiting relatives in Pennsylvania. Romulus firemen found Cichan still belted in her seat, which was faced down. She was found several feet from the bodies of her family. Believing that no one on the aircraft could have survived, officials at first announced that Cichan was an automobile passenger. She sustained third-degree burns and fractures to her skull, collarbone, and left leg. After the accident, Cichan moved to live with her maternal aunt and uncle in Birmingham, Alabama. She spoke to the media about her experience for the first time in 2011. In a 2022 interview for WDIV-TV marking 35 years since the crash, John Thiede, now a captain at the Romulus Fire Department, noted his friendship with Cichan since the mid-2000s when they made contact, and attended Cichan&#x27;s 2006 wedding.

==Investigation==
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated the accident.

Eyewitnesses stated that Flight 255&#x27;s takeoff roll was longer than usual and that the aircraft took off at a steeper angle. Their statements on whether or not the flaps and slats were extended varied, but most responded that they were extended, although they could not tell how far.

The CVR provided evidence of the flight crew&#x27;s omission of the taxi checklist. Although the stall warning was annunciated, investigators determined from the CVR that the aural takeoff warning was not annunciated by that warning system. The NTSB was unable to determine a cause for the electrical-power failure in the central aural warning system (CAWS):

The investigators spoke with other MD-80 pilots and learned that many of them found it a nuisance to hear a take-off configuration warning (&quot;Slats ... Slats... Slats...&quot;) while they were simply taxiing. It was so common for pilots to pull the P-40 circuit breaker that the area around the circuit breaker was smudged from routinely being manipulated. This circuit breaker also controls some of the stall warning sounds. This coincided with the missing sounds from the CVR of the incident flight.

While the investigators felt that the P-40 circuit breaker probably had been pulled by the pilot on the incident flight, they could not definitely confirm if the circuit breaker had been tripped, intentionally opened, or if electric current failed to flow through the breaker to the CAWS while the breaker was closed:

===NTSB conclusions===
The NTSB published its final report on May 10, 1988, in which it concluded that the accident was caused by pilot error:

==Aftermath==
After the accident, Northwest retired the flight number 255 along with its counterpart flight number 254, which was the outbound flight from Phoenix to Detroit. They were changed to Flights 260 and 261 beginning in September 1987 until the company merged with Delta Air Lines in early 2010. It was still operated by the MD-82 alongside DC-9s and Boeing 727s but were replaced by Boeing 757s and Airbus A320s in the 1990s. Delta continues the retirement of 255 by Northwest; , Delta has no flight 255.

==Memorials==

In memory of the victims, a black granite memorial was erected in 1994; it stands (surrounded by blue spruce trees) at the top of the hill at Middlebelt Road and I-94, the site of the accident. The memorial has a dove with a ribbon in its beak reading, &quot;Their spirit still lives on ...&quot;; below it are the names of those who perished in the accident. Another monument to the victims (many of whom were from the Phoenix area) stands next to Phoenix City Hall.
Also, a marker stone is located at the General Motors Proving Ground in Milford, MI, in memory of the 14 GM employees and seven family members who were killed in the accident. Most were traveling to the GM Desert Proving Ground in Mesa, Arizona.

On August 16, 2007, the 20th anniversary of the accident, a memorial service was held at the site. For some people affected by the incident, this was their first return to the site since the accident.

On August 16, 2012, the 25th anniversary of the accident, another memorial service was held at the accident site. Family and friends of the victims and others from across the Metro Detroit area (including local media) attended, and a local priest read each victim&#x27;s name aloud. Two more memorial services were held there on August 16, 2017, the 30th anniversary, and on August 16, 2022, the 35th anniversary. Annual meet-ups had become a tradition.

==In popular culture==

The accident of Northwest Airlines Flight 255 was covered in 2010 in &quot;Alarming Silence&quot;, a season-9 episode of the internationally syndicated Canadian TV documentary series &quot;Mayday&quot;.

The sole survivor of the accident was a four-year old child who appeared in the 2013 documentary &quot;Sole Survivor&quot;. She did not speak publicly about the crash until 2013, when the documentary was released.

In 2016, motorsport journalist Tom Higgins posted his recollections of Northwest 255. Higgins, then of &quot;The Charlotte Observer,&quot; and fellow NASCAR beat reporters Steve Waid and Gary McCredie (of &quot;Grand National Scene&quot;) arrived at a hotel near the Detroit Metropolitan Airport awaiting a Monday morning flight to Charlotte, North Carolina, after finishing coverage of the Champion Spark Plug 400 that afternoon at Michigan International Speedway, and were witnesses to the plane crash. For years, Higgins feared the August NASCAR weekend after this crash, noting how he was a witness on Middlebelt Road.

In her 2018 memoir &quot;This Will Only Hurt a Little&quot;, Busy Philipps mentioned that her friend Megan Briggs died the summer going into 5th grade on this plane crash. Briggs was eight years old and died alongside her parents and older brother.

<text>Valeriana locusta, commonly called mâche, cornsalad, or lamb&#x27;s lettuce, a small, herbaceous, annual flowering plant in the honeysuckle family Caprifoliaceae. It is native to Europe, western Asia and north Africa, where it is eaten as a leaf vegetable. 

==Description==
Cornsalad grows in a low rosette with spatulate leaves up to 15.2 cm long. It is a hardy plant that grows to zone 5, and in mild climates it is grown as a winter green.

In warm conditions it tends to bolt to seed, producing much-branched stems with clusters (cymes) of flowers. The flowers have a bluish-white corolla of five fused petals, long and wide, and three stamens. At the base of the corolla is a whorl of bracts. Fertilized flowers produce achenes with two sterile chambers and one fertile chamber.

==Distribution and habitat==
Cornsalad grows wild in parts of Europe, northern Africa and western Asia. In Europe and Asia it is a common weed in cultivated land and waste spaces. In North America it has escaped cultivation and become naturalized on both the eastern and western seaboards.

As a cultivated crop, it is a specialty of the region around Nantes, France, which is the primary producer of mâche in Europe.

==History==
Cornsalad was originally foraged by European peasants. Jean-Baptiste de La Quintinie, royal gardener of King Louis XIV, introduced it to kitchen gardening. It has been eaten in Britain for centuries and appears in John Gerard&#x27;s &quot;Herbal&quot; of 1597. It was grown commercially in London from the late 18th or early 19th century and appeared on markets as a winter vegetable, but it only became available in modern supermarkets there in the 1980s. American president Thomas Jefferson cultivated mâche at his home, Monticello, in Virginia in the early 1800s.

==Common names==
Common names include lamb&#x27;s lettuce, common cornsalad, or simply cornsalad, mâche (), fetticus, feldsalat, nut lettuce, field salad and valerian salad. The common name &#x27;cornsalad&#x27; refers to the fact that it often grows as a weed in cornfields (&#x27;corn&#x27; is used in the sense of &#x27;cereal&#x27;, not the US meaning of maize).

In German-speaking Switzerland it is known as Nüsslisalat or Nüssler, terms that have been borrowed by the area&#x27;s many English speakers. In some areas of Germany it is known as rapunzel, and is the origin of the long-haired maiden&#x27;s name in the eponymous fairy tale. In restaurants that feature French cuisine, it may be called doucette or raiponce, as an alternative to mâche, by which it is best known. In Croatia and Serbia it is known as matovilac. In Slovenia it is known as motovilec.

==Nutrition==
Cornsalad has a characteristic nutty flavour, dark green colour, and soft texture, and is popularly served as salad greens.

Like other formerly foraged greens, cornsalad has many nutrients, including three times as much vitamin C as lettuce, &quot;beta&quot;-carotene, B6, iron, and potassium. It is best if gathered before flowers appear.

<text>Baron Zsigmond Kemény (June 12, 1814December 22, 1875) was a writer from the Austrian Empire.

==Life and work==
Kemény was born in Alvincz, Principality of Transylvania, Austrian Empire (today Vințu de Jos, Romania) to a distinguished noble family, but family feuds left him with little personal wealth. His early schooling in Nagyenyed (today Aiud, Romania) gave him knowledge of English law, French law and German law, politics and culture. In 1837 he studied jurisprudence at Marosvásárhely (today Târgu-Mureş, Romania), but soon devoted himself entirely to journalism and literature. His first unfinished work, &quot;On the Causes of the Disaster of Mohács&quot; (1840), attracted much attention. In the same year he studied natural history and anatomy at Vienna University. In 1841, along with Lajos Kovács, he edited the Transylvanian newspaper &quot;Erdélyi Híradó&quot;. He also took an active part in provincial politics and warmly supported the principles of Count István Széchenyi. In 1846 he moved to Pest, where his pamphlet, &quot;Korteskedés és ellenszerei&quot; (&quot;Partisanship and its Antidote&quot;), had already made him famous. In Pest he discovered others who shared his liberalism and desire for reformation, and for a time was on the staff of the &quot;Pesti Hirlap&quot;. The same year he brought out his first great novel, &quot;Gyulai Pál&quot;. His lifelong interest in politics led to him becoming an outspoken public speaker, and in 1848 Kemény was elected a member of the revolutionary diet, promoting the idea of an independent Hungary. After a brief exile he accepted the amnesty and returned to Hungary. In 1857 he wrote his most famous novel: &quot;Özvegy és leánya&quot; (&quot;The widow and her daughter&quot;).

Kemény&#x27;s enthusiasm for Hungarian independence had waned, believing that the European balance of power would never accept an independent Hungary, and advocated a policy of reconciliation with Austria. After the failure of Lajos Kossuth&#x27;s radical nationalist policies, Kemény claimed that these ideas did not best serve the Hungarian people. He proposed compromise with Austria and moderation in politics, in his two pamphlets, &quot;Forradalom után&quot; (&quot;After the Revolution&quot;) and &quot;Még egy szó a forradalom után&quot; (&quot;One word more after the Revolution&quot;). This tactic only succeeded in making him unpopular.

He subsequently edited the newspaper &quot;Pesti Napló&quot;. In this paper Kemény promoted the Hungarian Passive Resistance movement. He also published several political essays (e.g. &quot;The Two Wesselényis&quot;, and &quot;István Széchenyi&quot;). During the 1860s Kemény took an active part in the political movement led by statesman Ferenc Deák, whose right hand he continued to be, and popularized the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 that Deák helped bring about; however, later he denounced it. Kemény was elected to the diet of 1867 for one of the divisions of Pest, but took no part in the debates. The last years of his life were passed in seclusion in Transylvania.

==Literary style==
Kemény&#x27;s political work should not overshadow his novels, which were remarkable for their lively dialogue, as well as their pessimistic outlook. His writing differed from his contemporaries in that his protagonists&#x27; fate was not directly linked to their moral standards. That is, the virtuous weren&#x27;t unconditionally rewarded, and sometimes the wicked went unpunished. His characters were thwarted by everyday frustrations and minor carelessness; they are not struck by lightning, they are more likely to be consumed by a fire caused by a carelessly dropped match. The fine historical novel &quot;A rajongók&quot; (&quot;The Fanatics&quot;) (Pest, 1858–1859) is generally regarded as his best.

<text>US Highway 16 (US 16), also called Grand River Avenue for much of its length in the state, was one of the principal roads prior to the post-World War II construction of freeways in the state of Michigan. Before the creation of the United States Numbered Highway System in 1926, the highway had been designated as a state highway numbered M-16. The modern route of Grand River Avenue cuts across the Lower Peninsula in a northwest–southeast fashion from near Grand Rapids to Detroit. Before the late 1950s and early 1960s, US 16 followed other roads between Muskegon and Grand Rapids, and then Grand River Avenue through Lansing to Detroit. In the years immediately preceding the creation of the Interstate Highway System, US 16 was shifted from older roads to newer freeways. Later, it was co-designated as an Interstate. When the gap in the freeway was filled in around Lansing, the US 16 designation was decommissioned in the state. The freeway was solely designated Interstate 96 (I-96) east of Grand Rapids and I-196 west of that city.

The original pathway along the Grand River Avenue corridor was an Indian trail, a footpath used by the native population. The first European settlers to the area now known as Michigan also used this trail and in some areas enlarged it for the passage of wagons. In Detroit, Grand River is one of five major avenues (along with Woodward, Michigan, Gratiot, and Jefferson) planned by Judge Augustus Woodward in 1805 that extended from Downtown Detroit in differing radial directions; Grand River Avenue extends northwesterly from the city&#x27;s downtown. In the middle of the 19th century, the trail was expanded into a plank road that formed the basis for one of the first state trunkline highways as M-16 in the early 20th century. Later, the highway was rerouted to replace M-126 and create M-104. Current segments of the roadway are still part of the state highway system as sections of M-5, M-11, M-43 or business loops off I-96. The portion of Grand River Avenue in Detroit between I-96 and the intersection with Cass Avenue and Middle Street in Downtown Detroit is an unsigned state trunkline, sometimes referred to as Old Business Spur I-96 (Old BS I-96).

==Route description==

At the time of its decommissioning, US 16 started its run through Michigan at the Grand Trunk Western Railroad docks in Muskegon. The SS &quot;Milwaukee Clipper&quot; operated as a car ferry across Lake Michigan, connecting Muskegon to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where US 16 continued to the west. From the docks, US 16 and M-46 traveled concurrently south and then east through downtown Muskegon. At Peck Street, US 16 turned south along Business US 31 (Bus. US 31). These two highways ran concurrently out of town to the south through Muskegon Heights to Norton Shores. There, the business loop ended at US 31, and US 16 joined the I-196 freeway headed east. (Later, the I-96 and I-196 designations west of Grand Rapids would be flipped, but at the time leading up to US 16&#x27;s decommissioning in the state of Michigan, this had not yet been approved.) The I-196/US 16 freeway traveled southeast of Norton Shores through woodlands in rural Muskegon County parallel to the former US 16 routing through Fruitport to Nunica in Ottawa County. The freeway turned more directly east in Nunica past the eastern terminus of M-104, and continued through more mixed forest and grassland terrain to serve the communities of Coopersville and Marne.

As the freeway approached Kent County, it met the western terminus of M-11 which was the former routing of US 16 through the Grand Rapids metropolitan area. I-196/US 16 continued eastward around the north side of the metropolitan area through the suburbs of Walker and Comstock Park. The freeway intersected the contemporaneous routing of US 131 along the East Beltline and curved south through the eastern edge of Grand Rapids to meet the end of I-96 east of downtown. There I-196 ended and US 16 was transferred to the I-96 freeway. I-96/US 16 continued southward intersecting Cascade Road, which was previously US 16. Cascade Road east of this interchange meets the westernmost part of Grand River Avenue, which carried US 16 east continuously to Downtown Detroit.
M-50 also joined the freeway at Cascade Road headed east, and together I-96/US 16/M-50 continued through eastern Kent County. M-50 departed to the south near Lowell, and the freeway crossed into southern Ionia County. Passing south of Portland, the freeway crossed east into Clinton County. North of Grand Ledge, I-96 ended and US 16 followed Wright Road off the freeway to Grand River Avenue. From there east, US 16 resumed its historic routing into the city of Lansing. Grand River Avenue carried the highway past the Capital City Airport and east to Larch Street, where US 16 turned south along US 27 north of downtown Lansing. At Saginaw Street, eastbound US 16 turned east on the one-way street, while westbound traffic ran a block north on Grand River Avenue. The two directions of travel merge at the east end of Saginaw Street in East Lansing. Grand River Avenue through East Lansing follows a tree-lined boulevard that forms the division between the campus of Michigan State University to the south and the rest of the city to the north. US 16 continued east in Ingham County through Okemos and rural parts of the county through Williamston and Webberville.
Grand River Avenue crosses to the east into Livingston County through Fowlerville to Howell. In Howell, Grand River Avenue meets Hartland Road which carries M-59; the highway also met M-155 in downtown, which at the time provided access to the Howell State Hospital. In the approach to Brighton, Grand River Avenue passes through rural southeast Michigan lake country. In Brighton, Grand River Avenue crossed the western end of the I-96 freeway. US 16 merged onto the freeway, and I-96/US 16 met the northern end of the US 23 freeway. I-96/US 16 continued east into Oakland County through Wixom and Novi.

Near Farmington, I-96/US 16 continued to the southeast of the present-day I-96/I-275/I-696/M-5 interchange along the current M-5 freeway. Grand River Avenue through there was Business Loop I-96 (BL I-96). The freeway ends at a junction with Grand River Avenue that also marked the end of the business loop and the eastern end of I-96 at the time. From there, US 16 continued along Grand River Avenue the rest of way into Downtown Detroit. Along that routing, it intersected US 24 at Telegraph Road and M-39 at Southfield Road. US 16 continued past the eastern terminus of M-14 at Plymouth Road, which until 1956 had carried US 12, which had then been concurrent with US 16 to Cadillac Square. There US 16 terminated at a common point with US 10 (Woodward Avenue) and US 12 (Michigan Avenue), which had replaced US 112 less than a year earlier. US 25 ran through the square on Fort Street and Gratiot Avenue.

==History==
The history of Grand River Avenue, and US 16 in Michigan, dates back to before the earliest settlement of Michigan by Europeans. The route has been the basis for an Indian trail, a pathway for European settlers, a state highway, a part of the US Highway System, and a section of the Interstate Highway System.

===Indian trail to state highway===

The chief transportation routes in 1701 were the Indian footpaths that crossed the future state of Michigan; the Grand River Trail was one of these thirteen trails at the time. In 1805, Detroit created rights-of-way for the principal streets of the city, Grand River Avenue included. This street plan was devised by Augustus Woodward and others following a devastating fire in Detroit. A ten-year project to construct a plank road between Detroit and Howell was authorized in 1820 along the Grand River Trail. Grand River Avenue was included as one of Five Great Military Roads by Governor Lewis Cass in 1825, along with the River Road, Michigan Avenue, Woodward Avenue and Gratiot Avenue. The Grand River Road, precursor to the modern Grand River Avenue was named by Benjamin Williams, cofounder of Owosso. The original Native American name for the river was meaning &quot;the river that extends far off&quot;, or &quot;far into the interior&quot;, which was translated as , the French name for the river; this name was then applied to the name of the trail that paralleled at least half of the river&#x27;s length.

The opening of the Erie Canal in New York in 1826 brought new settlers to the Great Lakes region, and to the future state of Michigan. Many of these settlers began their inland journeys in Detroit. At first the Grand River Road was a &quot;deep rutted, ditch bordered road&quot;. The road branched into two at Rouge (now Redford); the southern branch roughly followed the modern route of Grand River Avenue and the northern route ran by way of Pontiac along Woodward Avenue and the modern M-21 to the north of the Lansing area. From Bancroft, several trails branched off, including the northern branch of the Grand River Road and the Saginaw Trail. The two branches merged back together near Dewitt and continued west toward Ionia and on to Grand Rapids and Newton (now Grand Haven). The early travelers plied the road in wagons pulled by oxen or horses, and drivers charged between four and seven cents a mile (equivalent to $–/mi in ). The horses were exchanged every with the speed averaging around with few obstacles.

Congress further aided the road in 1835 with an appropriation of $25,000 (equivalent to $ in ) for a road on of right-of-way. These improvements included removing brush and debris and the construction of bridges across the Rouge, Shiawassee, Red Cedar and Grand rivers. The Grand River Road was a major route for settlers headed inland to Grand Rapids in 1836, as the shortest route for travelers coming from Detroit. An economic panic in 1837 drove settlers from New York to Michigan; these were the travelers who followed the Grand River Road. New settlements were created along the route, every or so, that distance being a good day&#x27;s travel by horse. Approximately 120 wagons left Detroit each day between August and November 1843.

After statehood in 1837, Michigan assumed the costs for construction work to the Grand River Trail. At that time, about had been surveyed from Detroit westward. The new state lacked the money to continue improvements to the road, and Michigan petitioned Congress for the better part of the next decade for money to complete the work. When the state capital was moved to Lansing in 1847, an improved road was needed to the capital city. The first segments of roadway were privatized starting in 1844. In 1850, the Michigan State Legislature established the Lansing and Howell Plank Road Company, which set about converting various Indian trails into the Lansing–Howell Plank Road, a task the company completed by 1853. At Howell the road connected with the Detroit–Howell Plank Road, establishing the first improved connection direct from the state capital to Michigan&#x27;s largest metropolis. The Lansing–Detroit Plank Road was a toll road until the 1880s, and it eventually evolved into the eastern part of the modern Grand River Avenue.
By 1900, only a short stretch of the Detroit–Howell Plank Road was still made of planks; most of the other plank roads had been converted to gravel by this time. On May 13, 1913, the Michigan Legislature passed the &quot;State Reward Trunk Line Highway Act&quot; (Public Act 334 of 1913) that created the original state highway system. In that act, Grand River Avenue between Detroit and Grand Rapids was included as Division 9 of the system. The state highways were signposted starting in 1919, and on the first maps published on July 1 of that year, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) had applied the M-16 number to Grand River Avenue across the state between Grand Haven and Detroit. M-16 was rerouted in the Lansing area in 1925, running along Grand River Avenue from Grand Ledge to East Lansing. The former routing through Downtown Lansing on Michigan Avenue became part of M-39 and the section north of Grand Ledge was eventually redesignated M-100. A second realignment moved M-16 to follow Grand River Avenue from Ionia through Ada. The former alignment became a part of M-21. On August 7, 1926, the state completed paving on M-16, opening it to traffic as &quot;the first paved highway across the state&quot;.

The M-16 designation lasted for seven years. As the states were meeting with the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO, now AASHTO) to plan the United States Numbered Highway System, the route of M-16 was originally planned for inclusion in US 18. When the system was created on November 11, 1926, Grand River Avenue and M-16 became part of US 16.

===US Highway to Interstate===

In 1929, Allan Williams placed a picnic table on the side of the road along US 16 south of Saranac. Williams was the Ionia County engineer in charge of the various roads in the county, and that location is &quot;what many consider to be the nation&#x27;s first roadside table&quot;. The first change to the US 16 routing was made in 1933 when the highway was moved to bypass Farmington, with the old routing retained as a state highway. The next year, in 1934, M-126 was created between Nunica and Muskegon. In 1940, US 16 was rerouted to replace M-126, and the former route of US 16 between Nunica and Grand Haven was redesignated M-104. Two further changes during 1941–42 rerouted the western end in Muskegon to end at the car ferry docks. Previously, motorists had to navigate from the western end along other roads to the ferry connection to the rest of US 16 in Wisconsin. The second change routed Bypass US 16 (Byp. US 16) along 28th Street and Wilson (previously the South Beltline and West Beltline sections of M-114) in the Grand Rapids area. The US 16 designation was moved in 1953 to replace Byp. US 16 while the former routing through downtown Grand Rapids was redesignated Business US 16 (Bus. US 16).
MSHD had plans to upgrade the US 16 corridor to freeway standards in the middle of the 20th century. The first planning map in 1947 for what later became the Interstate Highway System showed a highway in the corridor. The &quot;General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955&quot;, showed generalized plans for the locations of Interstate Highways as designated in 1955. This also included a highway in the US 16 corridor. The 1957 approval for the Interstate Highway System replaced the Grand Rapids–Detroit section of US 16 with a portion of Interstate 94 (I-94), with the remainder to be I-94N. MSHD submitted a recommended numbering plan for the Interstates in 1958 that showed I-96 following the US 16 corridor. When initially approved, the Muskegon–Grand Rapids segment of US 16 was to be numbered as I-196 while the remainder was part of I-96.

Segments of the road were upgraded in 1956 between Coopersville and Marne, Portland and Eagle, and Brighton and Farmington. By 1962, freeway construction allowed motorists to travel between Muskegon and the Lansing area on a freeway, bypassing the old Grand River Avenue route. The final connection between Lansing and Brighton was completed in late 1962. At that time, the US 16 designation, which had been applied alongside the I-96 and I-196 designations, was decommissioned. Segments of the old highway were retained in the state highway system under different numbers. Sections through Portland, Lansing, Howell, Farmington and Detroit were given Business Loop (BL) or Business Spur (BS) I-96 designations. The section between Lansing and Webberville became part of an extended M-43. Other sections in the Detroit area became parts of M-102, M-5, or unsigned state highway.

===Post-Interstate era===

After US 16 was transferred to the new freeway, Grand River Avenue lost its state highway status along most of its length. Today the roadway remains the &quot;Main Street&quot; of over a dozen Michigan cities and a scenic route through one of the state&#x27;s most populated corridors. In 1995, major reconstruction work along Grand River Avenue in East Lansing uncovered rotting logs, buried about below the present grade, that had been used as underlayment for the plank road surface in a low, swampy area. The logs had been in place for nearly 150 years. In 2004, the state transferred several blocks at the eastern end of Grand River Avenue to the City of Detroit. State trunkline control now ends at the corner of Grand River Avenue, Middle Street, and Cass Avenue.

Community leaders in Lansing have proposed renaming a section of Grand River Avenue in Old Town Lansing for César Chávez, the Mexican American civil rights activist. The group &quot;Lansing for Cesar E. Chavez&quot; was raising funds to rename the section between Oakland and Pine streets in Old Town. Previously, a section of Grand Avenue was renamed for Chávez in 1994, but the voters overturned the decision. The renaming proposal was even mentioned as a way to untangle a maze of different branches of Grand River Avenue running through Old Town. Currently, East Grand River Avenue and North Grand River Avenue bridge between sections of Grand River Avenue, in addition to Grand Avenue which runs along the Grand River near downtown. While Lansing&#x27;s Latino community supported the proposal, the business community opposed it. One shop owner said she would have $10,000 in costs associated with a name change, adding, &quot;I think there&#x27;s many beautiful ways to honor such an incredible man. Changing five blocks of a street doesn&#x27;t seem to do justice.&quot; Another business owner cited the work the Old Town Commercial Association has done to market the area using the Grand River Avenue name, marketing that would be useless after a name change. The compromise solution reached in August 2010 was to rename lot 56, where Old Town holds festivals, to Cesar Chavez Plaza. Street signs would be installed marking parts of Grand River Avenue as Cesar E. Chavez Avenue, but only in a memorial capacity; the street would still be officially named Grand River Avenue.

==Memorial highway designations==

Born in Grand Rapids in 1884, Arthur H. Vandenberg was appointed to the United States Senate upon the death in office of Woodbridge N. Ferris in 1928. Vandenberg, a Republican, served as a member of the &quot;isolationist bloc&quot;, and was an active opponent of the New Deal policies of Franklin D. Roosevelt. The senator declined a nomination for Vice President in 1936. In the aftermath of World War II, Vandenberg&#x27;s world view changed significantly. He helped to draft the United Nations Charter and worked to secure its unanimous ratification in the Senate. He also worked to secure passage of the Marshall Plan and helped to establish the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. After his death in 1951, Michigan residents wanted to memorialize Vandenberg. The following year, the Michigan Legislature dedicated the length of US 16 from Muskegon to Detroit as the Arthur Vandenberg Memorial Highway by enacting Public Act 70 of 1952.
Vandenberg was not the only national figure honored with a memorial designation along the route of US 16 in Michigan. For a period from the 1930s through the 1950s, the highway used a few blocks of Washington Boulevard to connect between Grand River and Michigan avenues on its route through Detroit to its terminus at Cadillac Square. This street was named in honor of George Washington for his service as the &quot;father of his country&quot;. The street was named by Judge Woodward as a part of his general street plan for the city of Detroit in 1807.

==Related trunklines==

===Grand Rapids bypass===

Bypass US Highway 16 (Byp. US 16) was a bypass route of US 16 in the Grand Rapids area. The highway became a part of the state highway system as a part of M-114, which was a beltline around the Grand Rapids area. By 1942, the trunkline was completed and reassigned a Byp. US 16 designation along the southern and western legs. The designation connected to US 16 in Walker Township (now the city of Walker) and ran south along what is now Wilson Avenue over the Grand River into Grandville. From there it turned easterly along what is now 28th Street through Wyoming and Paris townships (now the cities of Wyoming and Kentwood) before terminating at US 16 in Cascade Township. The designation was used until the mainline US 16 was rerouted over the bypass in 1953.
===Grand Rapids business loop===

Business US Highway 16 (Bus. US 16) was a business route in the Grand Rapids area in the 1950s and 1960s. When US 16 was rerouted to replace Byp. US 16 around the southern and western sides of the city in 1953, the former route of the mainline through downtown was redesignated as the business loop. That loop followed Remembrance Avenue southeasterly to Leonard Avenue in Walker Township. From there, the loop turned easterly on Leonard over the Grand River to Monroe Avenue before turning south parallel to the river along Monroe into downtown. In downtown Grand Rapids, Bus. US 16 turned eastward on Fulton Avenue into East Grand Rapids. There the loop followed Cascade Road into Cascade Township where it reconnected to US 16 at the intersection with 28th Street. Bus. US 16 lasted until 1962 when US 16 was decommissioned in Michigan.
===Farmington alternate route===

US Highway 16A (US 16A) was an alternate route for US 16 that bypassed Farmington. It was designated in 1933 for a new highway that bypassed downtown along what is now Freedom Road. In 1956, the designation was decommissioned when mainline US 16 was rerouted out of downtown Farmington, replacing US 16A. At the same time, the former route of the mainline through downtown was redesignated Bus. US 16.
===Farmington business loop===

Business US Highway 16 (Bus. US 16) was a business loop through downtown Farmington along Grand River Avenue. Its western terminus was at the junction of US 16 and Grand River Avenue west of the city, and the eastern terminus was at the intersection between US 16 and Grand River Avenue southeast of Farmington. This highway was the original route of US 16 through downtown Farmington. In 1933, US 16 was routed onto a bypass route which had been constructed south of the city (the present-day Freedom Road) and the route through Farmington was retained as state trunkline. In 1956, a new bypass freeway was built just to the south of the old bypass as part of the &quot;Brighton–Farmington Expressway&quot; and the route through downtown was designated Bus. US 16. The original plans for I-96 called for it to replace US 16 and to run parallel to Grand River Avenue all the way from Farmington into downtown Detroit. In 1959, the Farmington bypass freeway was given the I-96 designation in addition to the US 16 moniker, and the business route was redesignated as Business Loop I-96 two years later.

<text>Nicolaas Peter Vanos (April 13, 1963 – August 16, 1987) was an American professional basketball player for the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The San Mateo, California, native was selected 32nd by the Suns in the 1985 NBA draft, after playing for Hillsdale High School and collegiately at Santa Clara University. He played for the Suns as a center on the team.

His career with the Suns lasted only two years before his death. On August 16, 1987, Vanos and his fiancée, Carolyn Cohen, boarded Northwest Airlines Flight 255, after visiting his fiancée&#x27;s parents, for a trip to Phoenix, Arizona. The plane crashed after takeoff from the Detroit Metropolitan Airport in Romulus, Michigan, killing 154 passengers and crew, including Vanos and his fiancée, as well as two motorists.

<doc id="773841" wikidata="Q7269289" url="?curid=773841" title="Quarterdeck Office Systems">
<text>Quarterdeck Office Systems, later Quarterdeck Corporation (NASDAQ: QDEK), was an American computer software company. It was founded by Therese Myers and Gary Pope in 1981
and incorporated in 1982. Their offices were initially located at 150 Pico Boulevard in Santa Monica, California and later at 13160 Mindanao Way in Marina del Rey, California, as well as a sales and technical support unit located in Clearwater, Florida. In the 1990s, they had a European office in Dublin, Ireland. Their most famous products were the Quarterdeck Expanded Memory Manager, DESQview, CleanSweep, DESQview/X, Quarterdeck Mosaic, Manifest and Partition-It.

On April 18, 1989, Quarterdeck was awarded a US software patent that allowed multiple windowed PC applications under MS-DOS.

After sales and its stock plummeted in 1995, interim CEO King R. Lee hired Gaston Bastiaens as CEO. In order to diversify the company&#x27;s product offerings, Bastiaens began an ultimately unsuccessful acquisition spree.

In 1995, the company acquired Landmark Research International Corp. for 3.5 million shares of Quarterdeck (acquiring MagnaRAM and WinProbe) and then Inset Systems, Inc. of Brookfield, Connecticut in September of that year for 933,000 shares of Quarterdeck (acquiring HiJaak graphics software in the deal).

In March 1996, Quarterdeck acquired Datastorm Technologies, Inc., publishers of PROCOMM and PROCOMM PLUS, and relocated its technical support and development operations from California and Florida, to Datastorm&#x27;s Columbia, Missouri headquarters.

In July 1996, Quarterdeck acquired Vertisoft Systems, publishers of the DoubleDisk and Fix-It utilities, also for 3.5 million shares of Quarterdeck. Both Landmark and Vertisoft had extensive revenues from direct-marketing of third party products through telemarketing and direct mail.

Bastiaens resigned in August 1996, and Quarterdeck continued under acting Co-CEOs King R. Lee, and Anatoly Tikhman, the former CEO of Vertisoft. The company announced a restructuring and a loss, and in January 1997, Quarterdeck hired Curtis Hessler to run the company.

In 1998, with its DOS utilities market all but collapsed, Quarterdeck was acquired for $0.52 per share by Symantec (the Norton Utilities company), which discontinued support of some Quarterdeck products, &quot;e.g.&quot;, Mosaic, and integrated others into larger offerings, &quot;e.g.&quot;, CleanSweep, which became part of Norton SystemWorks.

<text>Luisa Fernanda is a former television entertainment news anchor, radio broadcaster, theatre and soap actress, singer and model. She was born on December 17th, 1970 in Mexico City. She worked for HSE in 2001 then Telemundo until the end of 2007. She co-animated two talk shows for Univision Radio, and hosted exclusive interviews for Terra.com. At the beginning of 2012, she signed with Azteca Networks to work in Mexico City, but shortly after decided to go back to the US and rejoin Univision.

==Biography==
Luisa Fernanda has been working on television since 1987, when she began her career as a host in Mexico, as well as a member of Garibaldi the music group, where she sang together with Patty Manterola, Pilar Montenegro, Katia Llanos, Sergio Mayer, Javier Ortiz, Victor Noriega and Charly López.

Her looks garnered the attention of some model agencies, and soon, she was named one of the top fifty most beautiful women of México. In 1994, she left Garibaldi.

From 1990 to 1998, she worked in many telenovelas for Televisa, including &quot;Alcanzar una estrella&quot; and &quot;Agujetas de Color de Rosa&quot;, &quot;El premio mayor&quot;, soap operas which were mainly geared towards Latin American teenagers. She was also a cast member of one of the most successful theatre comedy plays in Mexico for over five years. &quot;Deceive me if you can&quot; and participated in several other different plays through the years and has participated as a director assistant in some others.

In 2000, she went to the United States to work at the Home Shopping Network&#x27;s Spanish channel.

Less than a year in the US, she was hired by Telemundo/NBC to host the network morning show &quot;De mañanita&quot;. Soon after she was cast to co-host the network entertainment news show &quot;Cotorreando&quot;, alongside Mauricio Zeilic.

Apart from covering daily show business news, she has also covered live special events from Los Angeles, California, Mexico, New York, Texas and Puerto Rico, among many other places.

In June 2007, after making homophobic remarks, she was fired from the NBC Universal owned network. The following September, she signed a contract with Univision Network Group to co-anchor 2 radio talk shows for Univision Radio titled &quot;El Arañazo&quot; and &quot;El Colmillo&quot;. That same year, she was signed by Spanish internet portal Terra.com as a celebrity correspondent.

As of February 2012, she went back to Mexico City to co-host &quot;Buenas Noches America&quot;, a nightly variety show on Azteca América a TV Azteca owned Network where she also was a guest co-host several times on the TV Azteca network morning show &quot;Venga la Alegria&quot; but decided to go back to US to join Enrique Santos during his time on Univision Radio on the &quot;Enrique Santos Morning Show&quot; which was broadcast nationwide in 11 cities and became the Number one Morning Show in English and Spanish markets.

She left Univision Radio in 2017 to briefly work at Radio Caracol in Miami, a subsidiary of the Spanish media conglomerate PRISA.

In February 2018 she started traveling all over promoting the reunion of Garibaldi, the music group that propelled her to fame to celebrate the group&#x27;s 30th anniversary which will be celebrated with a TV special hosting many star guests, a new record and a world tour.

<doc id="773845" wikidata="Q1280621" url="?curid=773845" title="Shuttle America">
<text>Shuttle America Corporation was a regional airline in the United States based in Indianapolis, Indiana. It fed United Airlines flights at Chicago O&#x27;Hare International Airport (ORD) and Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) under the United Express brand, as well as Delta Air Lines flights at Atlanta (ATL), New York-LaGuardia (LGA), and New York-JFK under the Delta Connection brand. Shuttle America also operated two of three Delta Shuttle East Coast routes, serving Washington, D.C., and Chicago from New York-LaGuardia.

Shuttle America merged into Republic Airways on January 31, 2017.

==History==

Shuttle America was established in 1995 by former CEO David Hackett, and began operations on November 12, 1998, as a low-fare commuter airline, headquartered in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, the location of Hartford&#x27;s Bradley International Airport. Shuttle America&#x27;s first route was Hartford, Connecticut, to Buffalo, New York. Shuttle America got much publicity for their launch because of their &quot;super-low $29 fares&quot;. Shuttle America&#x27;s first aircraft; registered N801SA, was a 50-seat Bombardier Dash 8-300 with leather seats and a very creative and patriotic paint scheme. Shuttle America had rapid growth in its first year, adding more aircraft and destinations.

In 1999, Shuttle America made a controversial move to reach the Boston market. Instead of choosing the busy Logan Airport in East Boston, Shuttle America chose a nearby regional airport, Hanscom Field. Located in Bedford, Massachusetts, just west of Boston, it had amenities not found at the larger Logan Airport. With free parking, rental cars, and convenience to the I-95 highway, it was promoted as &quot;Hassle-free Hanscom Field&quot;. From Hanscom, Shuttle America served Buffalo, LaGuardia Airport in New York, Trenton, New Jersey, and Greensboro, North Carolina, via Trenton. At that time Trenton, New Jersey, was acting as a hub because of its central location in their route network.

At the peak time of their operation without codeshares, the airline was flying six Dash 8-300 aircraft and transported over 3000 passengers per day. Additional destinations in their route network during this time period include Albany, New York, Islip, New York, Norfolk, Virginia, and Wilmington, Delaware. Despite the success in quickly expanding throughout the region, the airline attained financial trouble with its growth.

In 2001, Shuttle America was purchased by Wexford Holdings LLC., who at the time also owned Chautauqua Airlines. Shuttle America then started flying as US Airways Express in a codeshare agreement, adding service to US Airways&#x27; Philadelphia and Pittsburgh hubs as well as seasonal service to Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, MA. At the same time, Shuttle America was transitioning to the smaller Dash 8-100 and started taking deliveries of former Chautauqua Saab 340 aircraft. The Dash 8-100&#x27;s had been leased from Allegheny Airlines and were a temporary stop gap measure to allow for the spool up of the Saab 340 fleet. Eventually, the Dash 8-300&#x27;s were sold to various airlines including Caribbean Star and Piedmont Airlines while the independent branding of Shuttle America was phased out in lieu of a full network of codeshares with US Airways and United Airlines with subsequent route changes to feed those carriers. In 2002, Shuttle America moved its headquarters to Fort Wayne, Indiana. In spring 2005, it was purchased by Republic Airways Holdings for $1 million. Headquarters were moved from Fort Wayne to Republic&#x27;s Indianapolis base shortly afterwards, and the Saab 340 fleet was replaced by Embraer 170 aircraft operating for Delta Connection and United Express.
In October 2008, a short-lived operating partnership was established with Mokulele Airlines to feed their hub in Honolulu with three aircraft. These Embraer 170 aircraft operated in the livery of Mokulele Airlines until October 2009, when Republic entered into a new joint venture agreement with Mesa Air Group, with the latter airline&#x27;s Canadair Regional Jet aircraft operating jet flights within Hawaii.

In an effort to reduce costs, parent company Republic Airways Holdings announced in 2014 that it would begin the process of merging subsidiaries Republic Airlines, Shuttle America and Chautauqua Airlines. Republic Airways Holdings merged Shuttle America and Chautauqua Airlines by the end of 2014 to reduce costs. As Republic Airways Holdings entered bankruptcy protection in February 2016, they announced that they would be merging the Shuttle America certificate into Republic Airlines operations.

Shuttle America operated its last Embraer ERJ-145 service on September 30, 2016.

On the evening of January 30, 2017, Shuttle America ceased operations and all remaining aircraft and crew were transferred to the Republic Airways Inc. certificate. This was intended to allow reduced costs as Republic Airways Holdings operates a single airline, with a single aircraft type, for the 3 major codeshares, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, and United Airlines.

==Operations==
Shuttle America had five crew member bases at the time of its merger into Republic: Columbus, Chicago O&#x27;Hare, Indianapolis, Newark, and New York-LaGuardia. Its fleet was made up solely of Embraer E170 jetliners with a two-cabin seating configuration. For United Airlines, Shuttle America operated the E170 in a two-class configuration of 6 First Class seats, and 64 economy. For Delta Air Lines, Shuttle America operated the E170 and the larger E-175 aircraft. Both of these aircraft consisted of a two-class configuration, with the E170 consisting of 9 first class seats, and 60 economy seats, while the larger E175 aircraft consists of 12 first class seats and 64 economy. These aircraft were initially operated by sister company Chautauqua Airlines, but Chautauqua was forced to transfer their 170s to Shuttle America after the pilots&#x27; union at American Airlines claimed the aircraft violated a &quot;scope clause&quot; regulating the size of regional aircraft operated by airlines that also operate under the American Airlines IATA airline designator code. Beginning in July, 2008, slightly larger Embraer E175 aircraft began to replace the Embraer E170 fleet in service with Delta. Towards the end of 2008, the airline achieved a major feat by being chosen to replace Delta Shuttle&#x27;s MD-88 operations between New York&#x27;s LaGuardia Airport and Washington Reagan National Airport on the same hourly schedule that Delta has operated with larger aircraft for decades. Beginning June, 2010, new flights by Shuttle America on behalf of Delta Shuttle served Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare International Airport from New York-LaGuardia with 11 round trips per day.

==Callsign==
On July 3, 2007, Shuttle America received approval from the ICAO to change its ATC callsign from Shuttlecraft to Mercury. However, prior to the changing of the callsign to Mercury it was changed to Crossroads, but the word &quot;cross&quot; caused confusion between aircraft and air traffic control (&quot;cross&quot; being a common phrase when taxiing aircraft, i.e. &quot;Cross runway 25L&quot;). This change was necessary due to the similar-sounding Air Shuttle callsign used by Mesa Airlines. The IDENT code remained the same as TCF. The IATA code of the airline has remained S5 through this time.

==Crew bases==

==Incidents==
Although Shuttle America was never involved in a fatal accident, it has been involved in several mishaps, notably:
*On June 8, 2005: Shuttle America flight 7534, a United Express Saab 340A reported undercarriage problems on approach to Washington Dulles International Airport. Undercarriage collapsed on landing, aircraft skidded off the runway, and onto grass. No fatalities were reported but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
*On February 18, 2007, Shuttle America flight 6448, a Delta Connection Embraer E-170 aircraft skidded off the snow covered 6,017 foot runway due to pilot error/fatigue and crashed through a fence while landing on runway 28 at 3:14pm at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. The flight was arriving from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. None of the 70 passengers and four crew on board the flight were reported injured.
*On February 27, 2012, Shuttle America flight 5124, a United Express Embraer E-170 aircraft operating a flight from Atlanta made an emergency landing at Newark Liberty International Airport after the pilots received an unsafe nose gear indication on approach; a fly-by of the tower confirmed the nose gear was retracted. The aircraft subsequently came to rest on runway 22L supported only by its main landing gear. The 66 passengers and 4 crew escaped uninjured.
*On June 13, 2013, a Shuttle America Embraer E-170 aircraft departing LaGuardia Airport was involved in a near-miss with a Delta Air Lines Boeing 747 arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Both aircraft were turning away from each other when they lost the required separation distance.

<doc id="773853" wikidata="Q1753830" url="?curid=773853" title="Video game programming">
<text>Game programming, a subset of game development, is the software development of video games. Game programming requires substantial skill in software engineering and computer programming in a given language, as well as specialization in one or more of the following areas: simulation, computer graphics, artificial intelligence, physics, audio programming, and input. For multiplayer games, knowledge of network programming is required (the resultant code, in addition to its performance characteristics, is commonly referred to as the game&#x27;s netcode by players and programmers alike). In some genres, e.g. fighting games, advanced network programming is often demanded, as the netcode and its properties (e.g. latency) are considered by players and critics to be some of the most important metrics of the game&#x27;s quality. For massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs), even further knowledge of database programming and advanced networking programming are required. Though often engaged in by professional game programmers, there is a thriving scene of independent developers who lack a relationship with a publishing company.

==Development process==
Professional game development usually begins with a game design, which itself has several possible origins. Occasionally the game development process starts with no clear design in mind, but as a series of experiments. For example, game designer Will Wright began development of &quot;The Sims&quot; by getting programmers to experiment with several ideas.

===Prototyping===
Programmers are often required to produce prototypes of gameplay ideas and features. A great deal of prototyping may take place during pre-production, before the design document is complete, and may help determine what features the design specifies.

Prototypes are developed quickly with very little time for up-front design and mostly act as a proof of concept or to test ideas. They are not expected to work flawlessly, but are developed to try out new, sometimes exotic, ideas.

===Game design===

Though the programmer&#x27;s main job is not to develop the game design, the programmers often contribute to the design, as do game artists. The game designer will solicit input from both the producer and the art and programming lead for ideas and strategies for the game design. Often individuals in non-lead positions also contribute, such as copywriters and other programmers and artists.

Programmers often closely follow the game design document. As the game development progresses, the design document changes as programming limitations and new capabilities are discovered and exploited.

===Production===
During production, programmers may create a great deal of source code to create the game described in the game&#x27;s design document. Along the way, the design document is modified to meet limitations or expanded to exploit new features. The design document is very much a &quot;living document&quot;, much of whose life is dictated by programmer&#x27;s schedules, talent and resourcefulness.

While many programmers have some say in a game&#x27;s content, most game producers solicit input from the lead programmer as to the status of a game programming development. The lead is responsible for knowing the status of all facets of the game&#x27;s programming and for pointing out limitations. The lead programmer may also pass on suggestions from the programmers as to possible features they&#x27;d like to implement.

With today&#x27;s visually rich content, the programmer must often interact with the art staff. This very much depends on the programmer&#x27;s role, of course. For example, a 3D graphics programmer may need to work side by side with the game&#x27;s 3D modelers discussing strategies and design considerations, while an AI programmer may need to interact very little, if at all, with the art staff. To help artists and level designers with their tasks, programmers may volunteer or be called upon to develop tools and utilities. Many of these may be for a specific purpose and can be buggy due to time constraints (time for development of such tools is often not included in a game&#x27;s schedule) as well as because they are only for in-house use anyway. Many game tools are developed in RAD languages for quicker development and may be discarded after the completion of the game.

===Testing===

The formal quality assurance testing process, performed by professional game testers, begins well into game development. High-budget titles may begin testing with the first playable alpha, while low-budget and casual games might not enter testing until a release candidate is ready. The programmers&#x27; task is to fix errors and bugs as such are discovered by the QA teams.

===Nearing completion===
Final tasks include &quot;polishing&quot; the game, such as programmers fixing occasional bugs—from minor to catastrophic—that may arise during the last phases of testing.

Game developers may have a beta testing period, but the definition of such varies from developer to developer. Often a beta contains all of the game&#x27;s features, but may have a few bugs or incomplete content. Few games are given a public beta period, for example, to measure stress tolerance for game servers.

When the game is deemed complete, it is said to have &quot;gone gold&quot; and is shipped off to the publisher. Depending on circumstances, the publisher may then subject it to its own quality assurance or may begin pressing the game from the gold master.

===Maintenance===
Once a game ships, the maintenance phase for the video game begins. Programmers wait for a period to get as many bug reports as possible. Once the developer thinks they&#x27;ve obtained enough feedback, the programmers start working on a patch. The patch may take weeks or months to develop, but it&#x27;s intended to fix most bugs and problems with the game. Occasionally a patch may include extra features or content or may even alter gameplay.

===Duration===
Most modern games take from one to three years to complete. The length of development depends on a number of factors, but programming is required throughout all phases of development except the very early stages of game design.

==Tools==
Like other software, game development programs are generated from source code to the actual program (called the &quot;executable&quot;) by a compiler. Source code can be developed with almost any text editor, but many professional game programmers use a full integrated development environment. Once again, which IDE one uses depends on the target platform.

In addition to IDEs, many game development companies create custom tools developed to be used in-house. Some of these include prototypes and asset conversion tools (programs that change artwork, for example, into the game&#x27;s custom format). Some custom tools may even be delivered with the game, such as a level editor.

Game development companies are often very willing to spend thousands of dollars to make sure their programmers are well equipped with the best tools. A well outfitted programmer may have two to three development systems and multiple monitors dominating their office or cubicle.

===Programming languages===

Once the game&#x27;s initial design has been agreed upon, the development language must be decided upon. The choice depends upon many factors, such as language familiarity of the programming staff, target platforms, the execution speed requirements and the language of any game engines, APIs or libraries being used.

For personal computers, the language selected may be little more than a matter of preference. Language bindings for popular libraries such as SDL and Allegro are widespread, and the performance gap between idiomatic code written in modern compiled languages is negligible. The most popular languages are usually procedural or object-oriented and implemented via compilers; for example, C, C++, and Java. However, developers may take into account domain-specific features, such as interfacing with the operating system, and resilience to reverse engineering for online video games. Many games are not written in one language exclusively, and may combine two or more languages; For example, Unity, a popular game engine, has different pieces written in C, C++, and C#.

For consoles, the support of the target platform is usually the most considered factor. In the past, video games for consoles were written almost exclusively in assembly due to limited resources in terms of both storage and processing speed. However, as technology has advanced, so have the options for game development on consoles. Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony all have differing SDKs for their Wii U, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 consoles, respectively.

High-level scripting languages are increasingly being used as embedded extensions to the underlying game written in a compiled programming language, for the convenience of both the original developer and anyone who would wish to mod the game. Lua is a very popular choice, as its API is written in ANSI C and the language is designed to be embedded into other applications. Many developers have created custom languages altogether for their games, such as id Software&#x27;s QuakeC and Epic Games&#x27; UnrealScript.

===APIs and libraries===
A key decision in game programming is which, if any, APIs and libraries to use. Today, there are numerous libraries available which take care of key tasks of game programming. Some libraries can handle sound processing, input, and graphics rendering. Some can even handle some AI tasks such as pathfinding. There are even entire game engines that handle most of the tasks of game programming and only require coding game logic.

Which APIs and libraries one chooses depends largely on the target platform. For example, libraries for PlayStation 2 development may not be available for Microsoft Windows and vice versa. However, there are game frameworks available that allow or ease cross-platform development, so programmers can program a game in a single language and have the game run on several platforms, such as the Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PSP and Microsoft Windows.

====Graphic APIs====

Today, graphics are a key defining feature of most games. While 2D graphics used to be the norm for games released through the mid-1990s, most AAA games now boast full 3D graphics, even for games which are largely 2D in nature, such as &quot;Civilization III&quot;. However, purely 2D graphics have experienced a Renaissance with indie games.

A well established personal computer platform is Microsoft Windows. Since it came pre-installed on almost ninety percent of PCs sold, it now has the largest user base. The two most popular 3D graphics APIs for Microsoft Windows are Direct3D and OpenGL. The benefits and weaknesses of each API are hotly debated among Windows game programmers.

Currently, the most popular Computing platform is Google Android. Since it comes pre-installed on almost eighty percent of Smartphones sold, Android has the second largest user base, and increasing. Android uses OpenGL ES &amp; Vulkan (API).

DirectX is a collection of game APIs. Direct3D is DirectX&#x27;s 3D API. Direct3D is freely available from Microsoft, as are the rest of the DirectX APIs. Microsoft developed DirectX for game programmers and continues to add features to the API. The DirectX specification is not controlled by an open arbitration committee and Microsoft is free to add, remove or change features. Direct3D is not portable; it is designed specifically for Microsoft Windows and no other platform (though a form of Direct3D is used on Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox, Windows Phone 7.5 smartphones and mobile devices which run the Pocket PC operating system).

OpenGL is a portable API specification. Code written with OpenGL is easily ported between platforms with a compatible implementation. For example, &quot;Quake II&quot;, which uses OpenGL, was ported from Windows to Linux by a fan of the game. OpenGL is a standard maintained by the OpenGL Architecture Review Board (ARB). The ARB meets periodically to update the standard by adding emerging support for features of the latest 3D hardware. In addition, the development tools provided by the manufacturers of some video game consoles (such as the Nintendo GameCube, the Nintendo DS, and the PSP) use graphic APIs that resemble OpenGL. OpenGL often lags behind on feature updates due to the lack of a permanent development team and the requirement that implementations begin development after the standard has been published. Programmers who choose to use it can access some hardware&#x27;s latest 3D features, but only through non-standardized extensions. The situation may change in the future as the OpenGL architecture review board (ARB) has passed control of the specification to the Khronos Group in an attempt to counter the problem.

====Other APIs====
For development on Microsoft Windows, the various APIs of DirectX may be used for input, sound effects, music, networking and the playback of videos. Many commercial libraries are available to accomplish these tasks, but since DirectX is available for free, it is the most widely used.

For console programming, the console manufacturers provide facilities for rendering graphics and the other tasks of game development. The console manufacturers also provide complete development systems, without which one cannot legally market nor develop games for their system. Third-party developers also sell toolkits or libraries that ease the development on one or more of these tasks or provide special benefits, such as cross-platform development capabilities.

==Game structure==

The central component of any game, from a programming standpoint, is the &quot;game loop&quot;. The game loop allows the game to run smoothly regardless of a user&#x27;s input or lack thereof.

Most traditional software programs respond to user input and do nothing without it. For example, a word processor formats words and text as a user types. If the user doesn&#x27;t type anything, the word processor does nothing. Some functions may take a long time to complete, but all are initiated by a user telling the program to do something.

Games, on the other hand, must continue to operate &quot;regardless&quot; of a user&#x27;s input. The game loop allows this. A highly simplified game loop, in pseudocode, might look something like this :
 while (user does not exit)
 check for user input
 run AI
 move enemies
 resolve collisions
 draw graphics
 play sounds
 end while

The loop may be refined and modified as game development progresses, but most games are based on this basic idea.

Game loops differ depending on the platform they are developed for. For example, games written for DOS and many consoles can dominate and exploit available processing resources without restraint. However, games for a modern PC operating system such as Microsoft Windows must operate within the constraints of the process scheduler. Some modern games run multiple threads so that, for example, the computation of character AI can be decoupled from the generation of smooth motion within the game. This has the disadvantage of (slightly) increased overhead, but the game may run more smoothly and efficiently on hyper-threading or multicore processors and on multiprocessor platforms. With the computer industry&#x27;s focus on CPUs with more cores that can execute more threads, this is becoming increasingly important. Consoles like the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 already have more than one core per processor, and execute more than one thread per core.

==Hobbyists==
The only platforms widely available for hobbyists to program are consumer operating systems, such as Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Linux, etc. This is because development on game consoles requires special development systems that cost thousands of dollars. Often these must be obtained from the console manufacturer and are only sold or leased to professional game development studios. However, Microsoft used to distribute a game development framework, XNA, which runs on both Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360. XNA was discontinued, but other projects like MonoGame and SharpDX are trying to allow the same access for game coding. Lately, Android is the most popular hobbyist platform of choice for mobile developers. Some hobbyists also develop homebrew games, especially for handheld systems or modded consoles.

Some software engineering students program games as exercises for learning a programming language or operating system.

Some hobbyists may use software packages that help with game development, such as Adobe Animate, Unity, Android Studio, pygame, Adventure Game Studio, Roblox Studio, GameMaker Studio, Godot, Unreal Engine, Pixel Game Maker MV, or Construct.

<text>South African Airways Flight 295 (SA295/SAA295) was a scheduled international passenger flight from Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, Taipei, Taiwan, to Jan Smuts International Airport, Johannesburg, South Africa, with a stopover in Plaisance Airport, Plaine Magnien, Mauritius. On 28 November 1987, the aircraft serving the flight, a Boeing 747-200 Combi named Helderberg, experienced a catastrophic in-flight fire in the cargo area, broke up in mid-air, and crashed into the Indian Ocean east of Mauritius, killing all 159 people on board. An extensive salvage operation was mounted to try to recover the aircraft&#x27;s flight recorders, one of which was recovered from a depth of .

The official inquiry, headed by Judge Cecil Margo, was unable to determine the cause of the fire. This lack of a conclusion led to conspiracy theories, debates and speculation about the nature of Flight 295&#x27;s cargo, as well as a subsequent post-apartheid investigation and calls from relatives of those on the flight to re-open the investigation in the years following the accident. Since the accident, SAA stopped using the combi version of the Boeing 747 due to safety concerns about the security of the cargo compartment.

==Aircraft and crew==
The aircraft involved was a Boeing 747-244BM Combi registered ZS-SAS and named &quot;Helderberg&quot;. This was the 488th 747 built, made its first flight on 12 November 1980 and was delivered to South African Airways (SAA) on 24 November 1980.

The Boeing 747-200B Combi model permits the mixing of passengers and cargo on the main deck according to load factors on any given route and Class B cargo compartment regulations.

Flight 295 had 140 passengers and six pallets of cargo on the main deck. The master waybills stated that of baggage and cargo were loaded on the aircraft. A Taiwanese customs official performed a surprise inspection of some of the cargo; he did not find anything that could be characterised as suspicious. According to Tinus Jacobs who was SAA&#x27;s manager in Taiwan at the time of Flight 295, the flight crew appeared relaxed and &quot;happy to fly&quot; before takeoff and did not display any concerns about the cargo.

The captain of Flight 295 was 49-year-old Dawid Jacobus Uys, a former South African Air Force pilot with 13,843 hours&#x27; experience of which 3,884 hours was on the Boeing 747 series airplanes. Uys was described by colleagues as professional and skilled and at the time of the accident was considering retiring to take up a role with the South African Pilots&#x27; Association. The flight crew also consisted of 36-year-old first officer David Attwell and 37-year-old relief first officer Geoffrey Birchall, with 7,362 and 8,749 hours&#x27; experience (including 4,096 and 4,555 hours on the Boeing 747) respectively; and 45-year-old flight engineer, Giuseppe &quot;Joe&quot; Bellagarda and 34-year-old relief flight engineer, Alan Daniel, with 7,804 hours and 1,595 hours (4,254 and 227 of them on the Boeing 747) of experience respectively.

==Accident==

Flight 295 took off at 14:23 UTC (22:23 local time) on 27 November 1987 from Taipei Chiang Kai Shek International Airport on a flight to Johannesburg via Mauritius. 

Thirty-four minutes after departure, the crew contacted Hong Kong air traffic control to obtain clearance from waypoint ELATO () to ISBAN. A position report was made over ELATO at 15:03:25, followed by waypoints SUNEK at 15:53:52, ADMARK at 16:09:54 and SUKAR () at 16:34:47. The aircraft made a routine report to the SAA base at Johannesburg at 15:55:18.

At some point during the flight, believed to be during the beginning of its landing approach to Mauritius, a fire started in the cargo section on the main deck which was probably not extinguished before impact. The &#x27;smoke evacuation&#x27; checklist calls for the aircraft to be depressurised, and for two of the cabin doors to be opened. No evidence exists that the checklist was followed or that the doors were opened. A crew member might have gone into the cargo hold to try to fight the fire. A charred fire extinguisher was later recovered from the wreckage on which investigators found molten metal.

The following communication was recorded with Mauritius air traffic control, located at Plaisance Airport near Port Louis:

The fire began to destroy the aircraft&#x27;s important electrical systems, resulting in loss of communication and control of the aircraft. At exactly 00:07 UTC (4:07 local time), the aircraft broke apart mid-air, the tail section breaking off first, due to the fire beginning to burn the structure of the aircraft, and crashed into the Indian Ocean, about from the airport. Other theories given for the ultimate demise of the aircraft were that the flight crew eventually became incapacitated by the smoke and fire or extensive damage to the 747&#x27;s control systems rendered the plane uncontrollable before it hit the ocean.

After communication with Flight 295 was lost for thirty-six minutes, at 00:44 (04:44 local time), air traffic control at Plaisance Airport formally declared an emergency.

==Search and salvage==

When Flight 295 last informed Plaisance air traffic control of its position, its report was incorrectly understood to be relative to the airport rather than its next waypoint, which caused the subsequent search to be concentrated too close to Mauritius. The United States Navy sent aircraft from Diego Garcia, which were used to conduct immediate search and rescue operations in conjunction with the French Navy. By the time the first surface debris was located twelve hours after impact, it had drifted considerably from the impact location. Oil slicks and eight bodies showing signs of extreme trauma appeared in the water. There were no survivors.
After recovery of the wreckage from below the surface of the ocean, the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage and cabin interior were partly reassembled in one of SAA&#x27;s hangars at Jan Smuts Airport, where it was examined and finally opened for viewing to the airline&#x27;s staff and selected members of the public.

==Investigation==

Rennie Van Zyl, South Africa&#x27;s head crash investigator, examined three wristwatches from baggage recovered from the surface; two of the watches were still running according to Taiwan time. Van Zyl deduced the approximate time of impact at 00:07:00, around three minutes after the last communication with air traffic control.

Immediately after the crash, the press and public opinion suspected that terrorism brought down Flight 295. South Africa, then under the control of the apartheid government, was the target of terrorism both domestically and internationally, and offices for SAA, the country&#x27;s flag carrier, had previously been attacked. Experts searched for indicators of an explosion on the initial pieces of wreckage discovered, such as surface pitting, impact cavities and spatter cavities caused by white-hot fragments from explosive devices that strike and melt metal alloys found in aircraft structures. Experts found none of this evidence. The investigators drew blood samples from two of the recovered bodies and found that the bodies had soot in their tracheae, indicating that at least two had died from smoke inhalation before the aircraft had crashed, and concluded that some of the passengers would have already lost their lives even if the pilots had successfully reached the airport.

South Africa mounted an underwater search, named &#x27;Operation Resolve&#x27;, to try to locate the wreckage. The underwater locator beacons (ULBs) attached to the flight recorders were not designed for deep ocean use; nevertheless, a two-month-long sonar search for them was carried out before the effort was abandoned on 8 January 1988 when the ULBs were known to have stopped transmitting (at the time a ULB had to generate sonic pulses for thirty days). Steadfast Oceaneering, a specialist deep-ocean recovery company in the US, was contracted at great expense to find the site and recover the flight recorders. The search area is described as being comparable in size to that of the wreck of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, with the water at being considerably deeper than any previously successful salvage operation. The wreckage was found within two days of Steadfast Oceaneering commencing its search.

Three debris fields were found: , and . These locations were spread , and apart, indicating that the aircraft broke apart in mid-air (it was suggested that the tail separated first). On 6 January 1989, the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) was salvaged successfully from a record depth of by the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) &quot;Gemini&quot;, but the flight data recorder was never found.

Van Zyl took the voice recorder to the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in Washington, DC, both to show his goodwill and to ensure neutral observers. Van Zyl believes that if he had kept the CVR in South Africa he could have been accused of covering up the truth. At the NTSB, Van Zyl felt frustration that the degraded (but still functional) CVR, which had been in the deep ocean for fourteen months, did not initially yield any useful information. Around twenty-eight minutes into the recording the CVR indicated that the fire alarm sounded. Fourteen seconds after the fire alarm, the circuit breakers began to pop. Investigators believe that around eighty circuit breakers failed. The CVR cable failed eighty-one seconds after the alarm. The recording revealed the extent of the fire.

Van Zyl discovered that the front-right pallet located in the main deck&#x27;s cargo hold was the seat of the fire. The flight manifest said that pallet mostly comprised computers in polystyrene packaging. The investigators said that the localised fire likely came in contact with the packaging and produced gases that accumulated near the ceiling. They also said that gases ignited into a flash fire that affected the entire cargo hold. The fire did not burn lower than one metre above the cargo floor. The walls and ceiling of the cargo hold received severe fire damage. Van Zyl ended his investigation without discovering why the fire started.

The official report noted the presence of the computer equipment, and suggested that a possible cause could have been the batteries contained in the computers exploding or spontaneously combusting, although this was not given as a conclusive cause of the fire.

===Margo commission===

An official commission of inquiry was chaired by South African Judge Cecil Margo, with co-operation from the NTSB and the aircraft&#x27;s manufacturer, Boeing. The board of the &quot;Margo Commission&quot; consisted of Judge Cecil S. Margo, Judge Hurrylall Goburdhun (Mauritius), George N. Tompkins Jr (USA), G.C. Wilkinson (UK), Dr Y. Funatsu (Japan), J.J.S. Germisuys (South Africa), Dr J. Gilliland (South Africa) and Colonel Liang Lung (Taiwan).

The official report determined that while Flight 295 was over the Indian Ocean, a fire had occurred in the cargo hold of the main deck, originating in the front right-hand cargo pallet. Aircraft parts recovered from the ocean floor showed fire damage sustained in temperatures over ; tests showed that temperatures of would have been required to melt a carbon-fibre tennis racket recovered from the crash site. The fire also damaged and destroyed the aircraft&#x27;s electrical systems resulting in the loss of many of the instruments on the flight deck and rendering the crew unable to determine their position. The reason for the aircraft&#x27;s loss was not identified beyond doubt, but there were two possibilities detailed in the official report: firstly, that the crew became incapacitated due to smoke penetrating into the cockpit; and secondly, that the fire weakened the structure so that the tail separated, leading to impact with the ocean. The commission concluded that it was not possible to apportion blame to any one individual for the fire, removing any terrorism concerns. Boeing is quoted in the report as having &quot;contested&quot; any scenario that involved a break-up of the aircraft, hence the commission went no further than simply mentioning the two possible scenarios in its final report, as incidental to the primary cause of the accident.

The commission determined that inadequate fire detection and suppression facilities in the class B cargo bays (the type used aboard the 747-200 Combi) were the primary cause of the aircraft&#x27;s loss. The accident alerted aviation authorities worldwide that the regulations regarding class B cargo bays had lagged far behind the growth in their capacity. The exact source of ignition was never determined, but the report concluded that there was sufficient evidence to confirm that the fire had burned for some considerable time and that it might have caused structural damage.

===Combi design===

The crash was the first fire incident on the 747 Combi and one of few fires on widebody aircraft. Fred Bereswill, the investigator from Boeing, characterised the Flight 295 fire as significant for this reason. Barry Strauch of the NTSB visited Boeing&#x27;s headquarters to inquire about the Combi&#x27;s design. Boeing&#x27;s fire test in the Combi models did not accurately match the conditions of Flight 295&#x27;s cargo hold; in accordance with federal US rules, the Boeing test involved setting a bale of tobacco leaves ablaze. The fire stayed within the cargo hold. The air in the passenger cabin was designed to have a marginally higher pressure than cargo area hold, so if a crew member opened the door to the cargo hold, the air from the passenger cabin would flow into the cargo hold, stopping any smoke or gases from exiting through the door.

Investigators devised a new test involving a cargo hold with conditions similar to the conditions of Flight 295; the plastic covers and extra pallets provided fuel for the fire, which would spread quickly before generating enough smoke to activate smoke alarms. The hotter flame achieved in the new test heated the air in the cargo hold. This heated air had a higher pressure than normal, and overcame the pressure differential between the cargo hold and the passenger cabin. When the door between the passenger and cargo holds was open, smoke and gases therefore flowed into the passenger cabin.

The test, as well as evidence from the accident site, proved to the investigators that the 747 Combi&#x27;s use of a class B cargo hold did not provide enough fire protection to the passengers. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed this finding in 1993 with its own series of tests.

After the accident, SAA discontinued use of the Combi and the FAA introduced new regulations in 1993 specifying that manual firefighting must not be the primary means of fire suppression in the cargo compartment of the main deck. The new regulations banned larger cargo hold variants of the 747 Combi; the smaller variants also needed to comply with these new standards, which required weight increases that made the 747 Combi less efficient. Nevertheless, the Combi variants remained in the 747 product line up until 2002, when the last 747-400 Combi was delivered to KLM.

==Fire origin theories==

In January 1992, the journal of the Royal Aeronautical Society (RAeS) reported that the inquiry into the in-flight fire that destroyed Flight 295 might be reopened because SAA had allegedly confirmed that its passenger jets had carried cargo for Armscor, a South African arms manufacturer. The RAeS journal, &quot;Aerospace&quot;, asserted: &quot;It is known that the crew and passengers were overcome by a main deck cargo fire, and the ignition of missile rocket fuel is one cause now under suspicion.&quot; A complaint against the newspaper that first published the allegations, &quot;Weekend Star&quot;, was lodged by Armscor.

The inquiry was not reopened, which likely led to the proliferation of a number of conspiracy theories concerning the nature of the cargo that caused the fire, which subsequently increased public doubts about the outcome of the initial inquiry. Examples of such theories include:

* The South African Defence Force was smuggling the hoax substance red mercury on Flight 295 for its atomic bomb project.

* Reports from the Project Coast investigation suggested there was a waybill showing that 300 grams of activated carbon had been placed on board Flight 295, leading to speculation that this substance had caused the fire.

In 2000, the South African television program &quot;Carte Blanche&quot; dedicated an investigation to a number of these allegations.

A South African government chemist examined a microscopic particle on the nylon netting next to the front-right pallet on Flight 295. The chemist found that the airflow patterns on the iron suggested that it travelled at a high velocity while in a molten state; therefore the fire on Flight 295 may have not been a flash fire triggered by packaging. Fred Bereswill, the investigator from Boeing, said that this would suggest that the source of the fire would have had properties like a sparkler, with the source including its own oxidising agent. A British fire and explosion analyst examined the exterior skin of the aircraft which had been located above the pallet; the analyst found that the skin became as hot as 300 degrees Celsius. Bereswill said that it would be difficult for a fire to burn through the skin of an aircraft in-flight because of the cool airflow outside the aircraft.

===David Klatzow&#x27;s theory===

David Klatzow was one of the forensic scientists who was retained to work on the case by Boeing&#x27;s counsel around the time of the official enquiry. He subsequently criticised the Margo commission for spending an inordinate amount of time looking into &quot;relatively irrelevant issues&quot; and that the commission ignored the most important question, what was the source of the fire and who had been responsible for loading it onto the aircraft? Klatzow believes that there are certain irregularities in parts of the commission transcript that indicate that something on the CVR transcript had to be concealed.

Klatzow put forward a theory that the fire likely involved substances that would not normally be carried on a passenger aircraft and that the fire was not likely a wood, cardboard, or plastic fire. South Africa was under an arms embargo at the time; the South African government therefore had to buy arms clandestinely. Klatzow&#x27;s theory postulates that the government placed a rocket system in the cargo hold, and that vibration caused the ignition of unstable ammonium perchlorate, which is a chemical compound used as a missile propellant.

Klatzow contends that conversation of the crew with the mention of dinner suggests that the fire started above the South China Sea, shortly after takeoff. The captain did not land the aircraft directly after the fire, Klatzow argues, because if he had he would have been arrested for endangering the lives of his passengers and it would have caused a major problem for South Africa, costing the country and SAA R400 million (approx. $200 million in 1987). Klatzow argues that the captain, who was also a reservist in the South African Air Force, would therefore have been ordered to carry on to South Africa in hopes of making it there before the aircraft&#x27;s structural integrity gave in. These points have been refuted because the severity of the fire as recorded on the CVR was enough to destroy the wiring to many electrical systems including the recorder and also would have certainly damaged the windows in the cargo hold to the point where pressurization could not be maintained, precluding continuous flight at high altitude.

On 20 July 2011, retired SAA captain Clair Fichardt announced that he had made a statement in connection with the missing Johannesburg air traffic control tapes, after he was persuaded to do so by Klatzow. Fichardt claimed that Captain James Deale admitted to handing the tapes to Captain Mickey Mitchell, who was chief pilot at the Johannesburg control centre on the night of the crash. Deale would further have stated that Gert van der Veer, head of SAA, and lawyer Ardie Malherbe were present during the transfer of the tapes. Earlier, during the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) hearings, Klatzow had cross-examined Van der Veer, Mitchell, and Vernon Nadel, the operations officer who was on duty.

==Post-apartheid investigation==

In 1996, the TRC, established by the post-apartheid South African government, investigated apartheid-era atrocities. In particular, Flight 295 was investigated to determine if there was any truth behind conspiracy theories that asserted that the Margo Commission had covered up or missed any evidence that might implicate the previous government. Klatzow was invited by the TRC to explain his theories and cross-examine witnesses. Unlike most other hearings of the TRC, the hearing into Flight 295 was conducted &quot;in camera&quot;, and without any representation from the South African Civil Aviation Authority (CAA); Klatzow considered the CAA untrustworthy because it had participated in the official enquiry, which he considered flawed. A number of key aspects of Klatzow&#x27;s theory hinged on his criticism of the actions of Judge Margo during the official enquiry, yet Judge Margo was not summoned to answer any of the allegations made against him.

The TRC concluded that nothing listed in the flight manifest could have caused the fire, a conclusion that was met with controversy within the public. Following public pressure, the TRC records were released into the public domain in May 2000. Upon receiving the documents, Transport Minister Dullah Omar stated that the inquiry would be reopened if any fresh evidence was discovered. The South African Police Service were tasked to investigate whether there was any new evidence, and to make a recommendation to the minister. In October 2002, the minister announced that no new evidence had been found to justify re-opening the enquiry.

On the 25th anniversary of the crash, Peter Otzen Jnr, the son of one of the victims, announced that he was approaching the Constitutional Court of South Africa in an attempt to have the commission of inquiry into the disaster reopened. In pursuit of this, he had obtained affidavits from former SAA employees who had never given any evidence before. An Australian national named Allan Dexter who had worked in public relations for SAA gave a sworn statement to Mr. Otzen claiming that he had been informed by the SAA manager at Taipei airport that Flight 295 was carrying rocket fuel which caused it to crash, and that the Captain had expressed concerns about the safety of the cargo but had been ordered from Johannesburg to fly the plane. In a 2014 interview, some of the accusations were disputed by Tinus Jacobs, SAA&#x27;s manager in Taiwan who saw Flight 295 off. Jacobs claimed that due to Taiwan&#x27;s status under martial law at the time, only one telephone at the airport (located in the office of China Airlines) could be used to make international calls and that none of Flight 295&#x27;s crew had access to it. Jacobs furthermore claimed that Captain Uys and the other crew members appeared relaxed and routine both the previous day and on the evening of the flight&#x27;s departure.

==Newer theories==

In 2014, South African investigative journalist Mark D. Young presented a theory that a short circuit in the onboard electronics may have started the fire. The so-called wet arc tracking arises from the action of moisture when the insulation of live wires is damaged. A leakage current to another damaged wire with the respective potential difference may form. The resulting flashover may reach temperatures of up to . This temperature is sufficient to ignite the thermal-acoustic insulation blankets that were in use at the time until the late 1990s. Such a short circuit may have caused the fire on board Swissair Flight 111, resulting in the crash of the aircraft in 1998. According to the Austrian journalist and aviation expert Patrick Huber, however, a short circuit is unlikely to be the cause of the fire. According to experts consulted by the author, this problem only existed in the Boeing 747 with older cables. However, the &quot;Helderberg&quot; was only seven years old.

==Passengers and crew==

Passengers and crew nationalities on board SAA Flight 295:
Taiwanese authorities stated that 58 passengers began flying in Taipei, including 30 Taiwanese citizens, 19 South Africans, 47 Japanese, two Mauritians, one Dane, one Dutch, one Briton, and one West German. The other passengers transferred from other flights arriving in Taipei, and as such their nationalities were not known to Taiwanese authorities.

At least two passengers died of smoke inhalation. The rest died from the extreme trauma sustained in the crash.

Among the passengers was Kazuharu Sonoda, a Japanese professional wrestler also known as Haru Sonoda and Magic Dragon, and his wife, who were travelling as part of their honeymoon. They were offered and sent on the flight by All Japan Pro-Wrestling president Giant Baba to appear on a wrestling show in South Africa, promoted by fellow wrestler Tiger Jeet Singh.

==Dramatisation==

The crash was featured in Season 5 of the Canadian-made, internationally distributed documentary series &quot;Mayday&quot;, in the episode &quot;Fanning the Flames.&quot;

<text>Anthony Joseph Bevilacqua (June 17, 1923 – January 31, 2012) was an American cardinal of the Catholic Church. He served as archbishop of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia from 1988 to 2003. Bevilacqua previously served as bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh from 1983 to 1987 and as an auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Brooklyn from 1980 to 1983. He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1991.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Anthony Bevilacqua was born on June 17, 1923, in Brooklyn, New York, to Luigi (1884–1961) and Maria (née Codella, 1893–1968) Bevilacqua. Luigi was born in Spinazzola, Italy and worked as a bricklayer. and Maria was born in Calitri, Italy. Anthony Bevilacqua had four brothers: Michael, Angelo, Rocco, and Frank; and six sisters, Josephine (died of meningitis at age two), Isabella, Virginia, Mary Jo, Gloria, and Madeline. Luigi immigrated to the United States in 1910, followed by Maria and their oldest son, Michael. The family lived in New Rochelle, New York; Hartford, Connecticut; and Brooklyn before settling in Woodhaven, Queens. Luigi operated a hair dying shop and shoe shine shop in Queens.

Anthony Bevilacqua attended Public School No. 60, St. Thomas the Apostle School, and Richmond Hill High School, all in the Borough of Queens. He then studied at Cathedral College in Queens, where he won prizes in mathematics and science. He earned a trip to Washington, D.C. for an essay on the Immaculate Conception. Bevilacqua graduated from Cathedral College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1943, and then entered the Seminary of the Immaculate Conception in Huntington, New York.

===Ordination and ministry===

Bevilacqua was ordained to the priesthood for the Diocese of Brooklyn by Bishop Thomas Malloy on June 11, 1949, at St. James Cathedral in Brooklyn. He then served as an associate pastor at Sacred Heart of Jesus and St. Mary Parish in Brooklyn and St. Mary Parish on Long Island until 1950. Bevilacqua taught at Cathedral College from 1950 to 1954, and then entered the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. He obtained a Doctor of Canon Law degree &quot;summa cum laude&quot; from the Gregorian in 1956.

After returning to Brooklyn, Bevilacqua served on the diocesan tribunal and as a chaplain to the Sisters of St. Joseph congregation in Brentwood, New York. He earned a Master of Arts in political science from Columbia University in 1962, and was named vice-chancellor of the diocese in 1965. From 1968 to 1980, Bevilacqua was a visiting professor of canon law at Seminary of the Immaculate Conception. During this time, he also founded the Diocesan Office for Migration and Refugees in 1971. Bevilacqua earned a J.D. from St. John&#x27;s University in 1975. He was admitted to practice law in the courts of New York and Pennsylvania and before the U.S. Supreme Court.

Bevilacqua was named by the Holy See as honorary prelate of his holiness on January 23, 1976; he became chancellor of the diocese that year also. He remained chancellor of the diocese and director of its Migration and Refugee Office until 1983. From 1977 to 1980, Bevilacqua taught immigration law as an adjunct professor at St. John&#x27;s University School of Law.

===Auxiliary Bishop of Brooklyn===
On October 7, 1980, Bevilacqua was appointed as an auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Brooklyn, and titular bishop of Aquae Albae in Byzacena by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on November 24, 1980, from Bishop Francis Mugavero, with Bishops John J. Snyder and Charles Mulrooney serving as co-consecrators, at the Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Brooklyn. Bevilacqua selected as his episcopal motto: &quot;Ecclesia Mater Nostra&quot;, meaning &quot;The Church, our Mother.&quot;

==== Mansour controversy ====
In 1983, Bevilacqua became involved in the case of Agnes Mary Mansour. A member of the Sisters of Mercy religious order in Detroit, Mansour administered the State of Michigan&#x27;s Medicaid program as the director of the Michigan Department of Social Services. In 1983, Detroit Archbishop Edmund Szoka asked Mansour to declare her opposition to public financing of abortion procedures, which she refused to do. The Vatican then sent Bevilacqua to meet with her. He told Mansour that if she did not resign as director, she would have to leave the Sisters of Mercy. Mansour chose to keep her job and leave the religious order.

In the early 1980s, as chair of the Committee on Canonical Affairs, Bevilacqua led the US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) through the first phases of implementing the new 1983 Code of Canon Law, making appropriate adaptations for the United States.

===Bishop of Pittsburgh===
Bevilacqua was named by Pope John Paul II as the tenth bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh on October 7, 1983. Succeeding Bishop Vincent Leonard, Bevilacqua was consecrated by Bishop Mugavero on December 12, 1983. He was a member of the 1987 World Synod of Bishops on the role of laity in the church and the world.

==== O&#x27;Connor abuse case ====
In 1985, John O&#x27;Connor, a priest of the Diocese of Camden in New Jersey, was charged with inappropriately touching a 14-year-old boy in that diocese during a sleepover. O&#x27;Connor was arrested, then released to a pretrial intervention program in Toronto, followed by a period of court supervision. After O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s completion of the program, Camden Bishop George Guilfoyle asked Bevilacqua to accept O&#x27;Connor in the Diocese of Pittsburgh. Bevilacqua agreed and assigned O&#x27;Connor as a hospital chaplain. O&#x27;Connor was moved back to the Diocese of Camden in 1993 because his 1984 Cape May County victim had sued and received a settlement.

==== Karabin abuse case ====
On August 14, 2018, Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro released a grand jury report detailing alleged sex abuse in six Pennsylvania dioceses, including the Diocese of Pittsburgh. The report showed a 1985 memo written by Bevilacqua in which he rejected a request to reassign Joseph Karabin, a diocese priest, after two children told the diocese he had sexually molested them. Bevilacqua did not report Karabin to the police, but sent him instead to a treatment center for alcohol abuse in Maryland. Karabin was kept on restricted assignments until 2002, when he was appointed as chaplain at a retirement home. Donald Wuerl, Bevilacqua&#x27;s successor as bishop, withdrew Karabin&#x27;s appointment and suspended his priestly faculties.

In 1986, Bevilacqua banned women from participating in the Holy Thursday foot-washing service. He said that the service was a re-enactment of the Last Supper, in which Jesus only washed men&#x27;s feet. After pushback from Catholic women and from the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, Bevilacqua relented, allowing individual pastors to decide. However, he refused to attend services that washed women&#x27;s feet.

===Archbishop of Philadelphia===
Pope John Paul II appointed Bevilacqua as archbishop of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia on December 8, 1987. Succeeding Cardinal John Krol, Bevilacqua was installed on February 11, 1988, and named cardinal-priest of Ss. Redentore e S. Alfonso in Via Merulana in the consistory of June 28, 1991.

In 1998, Bevilacqua asked Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge to fund food stamp assistance for immigrants and instituted service centers for Latino and African American Catholics.

Bevilacqua is remembered for his frequent visits to churches in the diocese, his knowledge of fiscal matters, his conservatism, and his closing of schools. Organizationally, he divided the archdiocese into six vicariates, each with a general vicariate, and subdivided the central administration into six secretariats. He hosted a weekly radio call-in program, &quot;Live with Cardinal Bevilacqua&quot;, which aired on WZZD-AM in Philadelphia. In 2002, he was named to the PoliticsPA &quot;Power 50&quot; list of politically influential personalities.

Within the USCCB, Bevilacqua served as chair of the Committee on Migration from 1983 to 1984, during which time he visited the refugee camps of Southeast Asia and Africa. He also chaired the Committee for Canonical Affairs (1981–1984) and the Committee on Pro-Life Activities. In 2005, the Philadelphia District Attorney&#x27;s office issued a report that criticized Bevilacqua and his predecessor, Cardinal Krol, for failing to protect children in the archdiocese from sexual abuse by priests.

===Retirement and death===
Upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75 in June 1998, Bevilacqua submitted his letter of resignation to Pope John Paul II, who allowed him to continue in his post. Bevilacqua lost the right to participate in a papal conclave when he reached the age of 80 in June 2003. His resignation was finally accepted by the Pope on July 15, 2003, Bevilacqua served as apostolic administrator of the archdiocese until the installation of his successor, Cardinal Justin Rigali, on October 7, 2003. In retirement, Bevilacqua lived at his home on the grounds of St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania.

In February 2011 it was reported that Bevilacqua was suffering from cancer and dementia. In November 2011, Bevilacqua gave a seven-hour deposition in a sealed hearing on the handling of sexual abuse cases in the archdiocese. Due to his declining health, his testimony was videotaped. Defense lawyers said the cardinal could no longer recognize the priest who had been his longtime aide.

Bevilacqua died suddenly on January 31, 2012, at age 88 in his home in Wynnewood.

==== Lynn negligence case ====
In 2012, Monsignor William Lynn, former secretary for clergy in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, was convicted of one count of child endangerment. This conviction resulted from his negligent oversight of Edward Avery, a priest in the archdiocese, who sexually fondled a 12-year-old boy. Lynn was acquitted of conspiracy and a second child endangerment count. Lynn&#x27;s lawyers had argued that the case should be thrown out. They presented a 1994 memo that showed that Lynn had prepared a list of 35 abuse allegations against priests in the archdiocese. Bevilacqua had ordered Monsignor James Molloy to destroy the list.

==== Picard retaliation ====
During Lynn&#x27;s trial, it was revealed that in 1996, Monsignor Michael Picard, the pastor of St. Andrew Parish in Newtown, Pennsylvania, had expressed concerns to Bevilacqua regarding a priest assigned to his parish. That unnamed priest had been accused of sexually assaulting a minor in 1982. In response, Bevilacqua ordered Picard to apologize to the priest and spend two weeks on a contemplative retreat. The other priest was transferred to another parish. In response to Picard&#x27;s allegation, the archdiocese said it had received no complaints about the accused priest&#x27;s work in 15 years of service to three parishes. That priest died in 2006.

==== Bevilacqua abuse allegation ====
In September 2018, the Diocese of Pittsburgh was sued by Heather Taylor, a former student at St. Gabriel of the Sorrowful Virgin School near Pittsburgh. Taylor claimed that Bevilacqua, then bishop of Pittsburgh, had groped her while visiting St. Gabriel. She also accused two other priests on the school faculty of molesting her, both of whom were found to have sexually abused minors.

== Viewpoints ==
In 2000, Bevilacqua testified before the Pennsylvania General Assembly in support of a bill that would enact a moratorium on capital punishment in that state.

Bevilacqua was a frequent critic of LGBT rights, calling it an &quot;...aberration, moral evil...&quot;. He also believed that gay men should not be accepted as Catholic priests.

In 2004, Bevilacqua praised the banning of abortion services for women in US military hospitals by Congress. In 2009, Bevilacqua joined other American bishops in condemning the University of Notre Dame for inviting President Barack Obama to be its commencement speaker. This was due to Obama&#x27;s support for abortion rights. Bevilacqua commented:It is my hope and prayer that the University of Notre Dame will rescind the invitation to President Obama to speak at the commencement and withhold the conferral of an honorary degree to him or to anyone who so blatantly disregards the basic moral principles upon which the United States of America was founded.

<text>National Taipei University of Technology (Taipei Tech; ) is a public university in Taipei, Taiwan. It is a member of the Global Research &amp; Industry Alliance (Gloria) of the Ministry of Science and Technology and accredited by AACSB. Located in the Daan district of Taipei, the school was established in 1912 as the School of Industrial Instruction, one of the earliest intermediate-higher educational institutions in Taiwan.

The current president of the university is Sea-Fue Wang. The university is part of the University System of Taipei, along with National Taipei University and Taipei Medical University. Its comprehensive undergraduate and graduate programs offer degrees in the STEM fields as well as design, architecture, management, humanities, and social sciences. It is also a part of the University Academic Alliance in Taiwan or UAAT, composed of the Top 12 academic institutions in Taiwan chosen by the Ministry of Education (Taiwan) in 2023.

The 495-acre campus in downtown Taipei was divided into three sections during the city&#x27;s development. The main campus (West, East, and South) in Taipei now only spans 22 acres, next to the affluent Huashan 1914 Creative Park and the Guang Hua neighborhood, an area known as the Electric Town of Taipei due to the computer goods and electronics stores.

==History==
The university was established as the &quot;School of Industrial Instruction&quot; (工業講習所; ) in 1912. The institution underwent several name changes and reorganizations during the Japanese colonial period in Taiwan. After the (Nationalist) Republic of China central government settled in Taiwan as an outcome of the war against the Communist regime, the institution was renamed &quot;Provincial Taipei Institute of Technology&quot; (臺灣省立臺北工業專科學校) in 1948 and served as a vocational technical college. In 1981, it was renamed &quot;National Taipei Institute of Technology&quot; (國立臺北工業專科學校). In the 1990s its status was upgraded to that of a university, resulting in its name change to &quot;National Taipei University of Technology&quot; (國立臺北科技大學) in 1997.

==Rankings==
Taipei Tech ranks 425th globally in QS 2025, making it the 6th best university in Taiwan. It is also ranked 801-1000th globally in Times Higher Education 2024, and 1223rd in U.S. News &amp; World Report 2024. Taipei Tech is also reputable among employers in Taiwan—according to CHEERS Magazine in 2021, it is the 6th most preferred university overall for Taiwanese companies and the 1st among technical universities.

<text>The trocaz pigeon, Madeira laurel pigeon or long-toed pigeon (Columba trocaz) is a pigeon which is endemic to the island of Madeira, Portugal. It is a mainly grey bird with a pinkish breast; its silvery neck patch and lack of white wing markings distinguish it from its close relative and probable ancestor, the common wood pigeon. Its call is a characteristic six-note cooing, weaker and lower-pitched than that of the wood pigeon. Despite its bulky, long-tailed appearance, this pigeon has a fast, direct flight.

A scarce resident breeder in laurisilva forests, the trocaz pigeon lays one white egg in a flimsy twig nest. Its numbers fell sharply after human colonisation of the Madeira archipelago, and it vanished altogether from Porto Santo Island. The major cause of its population decline was habitat loss from forest clearance, but hunting and nest predation by introduced rats were also contributory factors. Protection of the laurel forests and a ban on hunting have enabled numbers to increase, so that the species is no longer endangered.
==Description==

The trocaz pigeon is a rather plain, dark grey bird long with a wingspan. The upper back has a violet sheen, becoming green on the back of the neck, and the neck sides are patterned with silver-white. The tail is blackish with a wide, pale grey band, and the flight feathers are mainly black. The upper breast is pinkish, the eye is yellow, the bill has a yellow tip and a reddish-purple base, and the legs are red. The sexes are similar in appearance, but the juvenile has generally browner plumage, with limited or no development of the silvery neck patch. Its closed wings have a scaly appearance due to pale buff feather edges.
The trocaz pigeon&#x27;s voice is weaker and deeper than that of common wood pigeon, typically consisting of six syllables with the middle pair of notes extended and stressed: &quot;&quot;. When flying, it appears heavy and large-tailed, although its flight is rapid and direct.

The common wood pigeon had a poorly defined Madeiran subspecies, &quot;Columba palumbus maderensis&quot;. This was paler than the trocaz pigeon and had white wing patches and a more extensive green iridescence on the nape, but it became extinct before 1924. Bolle&#x27;s pigeon is more similar in appearance to the trocaz pigeon, although it lacks the whitish neck patch and has a more extensively pink breast. However, that species is endemic to the Canary Islands, so there is no range overlap. The only other pigeon currently present on Madeira is the feral pigeon; this is slimmer, has more pointed wings and a much smaller tail. It often has dark wing markings, and a lighter flight.

==Taxonomy==

The genus &quot;Columba&quot; is the largest within the pigeon family, and has the widest distribution. Its members are typically pale grey or brown, often with white head or neck markings or iridescent green or purple patches on the neck and breast. The neck feathers may be stiffened and aligned to form grooves. One of several subgroups within &quot;Columba&quot; consists of the widespread Eurasian common wood pigeon, Bolle&#x27;s pigeon, the trocaz pigeon, and the African Afep pigeon. The two Macaronesian endemic pigeons, Bolle&#x27;s and trocaz, are thought to be derived from isolated island populations of &quot;C. palumbus&quot;.

The Atlantic archipelagos of the Canaries, Azores, and Madeira have a volcanic origin and they have never been part of a continent. The formation of Madeira started in the Miocene and the island was substantially complete by 700,000 years ago. At various times in the past, the major islands of these archipelagos were all colonised by ancestral wood pigeons, which evolved on their respective islands in isolation from the mainland populations. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences suggest that the ancestor of Bolle&#x27;s pigeon may have arrived in the Canaries about 5 mya, but an older lineage that gave rise to another Canarian endemic, the laurel pigeon, &quot;C. junoniae&quot;, may date from 20 mya. The most recent wood pigeon arrival on Madeira was that which gave rise to the subspecies &quot;C. palumbus maderensis&quot;.

The trocaz pigeon was formally described in 1829 by Karl Heineken, a German medical doctor and ornithologist who was living on Madeira at the time. He recognised it as different from the now-extinct local form of the common wood pigeon, which he called the &quot;Palumbus&quot;, and noted that the two pigeons never interbred or habitually associated together. He suggested designating the new species by its local name, &quot;trocaz&quot;. &quot;Trocaz&quot; is a variant of Portuguese &quot;torcaz&quot;, the common wood pigeon; both words are ultimately derived from the Latin &quot;torquis&quot;, a collar, and refer to the bird&#x27;s coloured neck patches. This is a monotypic species, although in the past Bolle&#x27;s pigeon was sometimes regarded as a subspecies of the trocaz pigeon.

==Distribution and habitat==
The trocaz pigeon is endemic to the mountainous subtropical Atlantic main island of Madeira, although it formerly also bred on the neighbouring Porto Santo Island. It mainly occurs on the northern slopes of the mountains, but smaller numbers are found in the south where suitable patches of laurel forest remain.

The natural habitat is tall laurisilva forest or dense tree heaths which are cloud-covered for much of the year. The forests consist mainly of laurel, &quot;Ocotea foetens&quot;, Madeira mahogany, Canary laurel, faya, lily-of-the-valley-tree and &quot;Picconia excelsa&quot;. The trocaz pigeon prefers primary forests, but secondary growth is used for feeding, and agricultural land is also visited, especially at times of fruit shortage. Most of the pigeons are found below , and their prime environment appears to be steep ravine-indented slopes along artificial watercourses, with the occasional large dead laurel tree and much tree heath. This species is highly mobile between different areas at different times of year.

==Behaviour==

===Breeding===

Pigeons can breed from their first year, and nesting occurs throughout the year, although mainly from February to June. The displays are similar to those of the common wood pigeon; the male climbs quickly in flight, gives a loud wing-clap, and then glides down with his wings and tail spread. The display may be repeated two or three times before the bird returns to a perch. On the ground the male performs a bowing display with his neck inflated to show off the iridescent neck patches; meanwhile, the tail is raised, fanned, then closed again. This display is usually accompanied by calling. The nest is a typical pigeon construction, a flimsy structure of twigs and grasses usually placed high in a tree in thick forest. One, rarely two, smooth white eggs are laid, although no nest with two chicks has ever been found. The eggs, in size, are incubated for 19–20 days; the young are able to fly in 28 days, and are independent within eight weeks.
===Feeding===
The trocaz pigeon is exclusively herbivorous. Nearly 60% of its diet is fruit, with most of the rest being leaves, and just 1% is flowers. The fruits of Til, Azores Laurel and &quot;Persea indica&quot;, and the fruits and leaves of small-leaved holly are the most frequently detected food items. Most seeds pass through the digestive system intact, apart from those of Azores Laurel, which are usually damaged. Fruit is the main component of the diet when it is readily available in autumn and winter, and leaves are consumed in spring and summer when fruits are scarce. In one study, 27% of the leaves consumed came from native trees, especially Small-leaved Holly, 61% from herbs and shrubs, and nearly 10% from introduced trees, mainly apples and peaches. This pigeon will feed in agricultural areas, where cabbage is the most commonly taken crop plant. Pigeon faeces from agricultural areas contain few native plants, and samples from forests have few crop species, so some individual birds may concentrate on crops. Feeding in cultivated land is commonest in winter, when fruit is readily available, so it appears not to be a shortage of natural foods that causes them to leave the forest, but is mostly opportunistic, resulting from the birds&#x27; movements through nearby forest. However, when the fruit crop of Til and Azores Laurel is poor, large numbers of pigeons may leave the forest to feed on cabbage, flowering cherries and vine shoots. Competition for food with rats can be significant in parts of the island.

==Status==
The trocaz pigeon formerly bred on both the main island of Madeira and nearby Porto Santo Island. It was very abundant when the islands were first colonised by humans, but was extirpated on Porto Santo, and by 1986 had declined to about 2,700 birds. Hunting was banned in that year, and there are now between 7,500 and 10,000 individuals in approximately of suitable habitat. The losses on the two islands, the only inhabited ones in the archipelago, were largely the result of deforestation for wood and to create agricultural and grazing land.

The exclusion of livestock from the native forest allows the forest to regenerate and create more suitable habitat. Some illegal hunting and poisoning continues because of the damage this pigeon can do to crops, and the government allowed a cull in 2004. Perhaps the main limiting factor on the rate at which the pigeon increases its numbers is predation by introduced black rats on its eggs and young. The Madeira Nature Park has a management plan for the trocaz pigeon, and it is hoped that an education campaign and the promotion of bird scarers may reduce persecution. Its increasing population means that it is now classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, an improvement on its Threatened status in 1988. This species is protected under the European Union Birds Directive, and the laurel forests under the Habitats Directive.

<text>John Joseph Krol (October 26, 1910 – March 3, 1996) was an American prelate of the Catholic Church. He was Archbishop of Philadelphia from 1961 to 1988, having previously served as an auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Cleveland (1953–1961), and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1967 by Pope Paul VI.

==Early life and education==
Krol was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the fourth of eight children of John and Anna (née Pietruszka) Krol. His parents were Polish immigrants who were originally from the Tatra Mountains. Krol&#x27;s father held various occupations, working as a machinist, barber, carpenter, plumber and electrician; his mother worked as a maid at a hotel in Cleveland. At age 2, he and his family returned to Poland, but returned to Cleveland within a year. Krol received his early education at the parochial school of St. Hyacinth Church. At age 9, he went to work part-time as a butcher&#x27;s helper. He later worked as a maker of wooden boxes.

Krol attended Cathedral Latin High School, graduating at age 16 in 1927. He then took a job as a butcher at a Kroger grocery store in Cleveland, where he became manager of the meat department at age 18. Religious questions from a Lutheran co-worker prompted Krol to more deeply study Catholic theology and eventually decide to enter the priesthood. He began his studies at St. Mary&#x27;s College in Orchard Lake, Michigan. He later enrolled at St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary in his native Cleveland. At St. Mary&#x27;s, he also operated a small tobacco business, receiving shipments of defective cigars and then selling them to his fellow seminarians.

==Priesthood==
On February 20, 1937, Krol was ordained a priest by Bishop Joseph Schrembs at the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist. His first assignment was as a curate at Immaculate Heart of Mary Church in Cleveland, where he remained for one year. In 1938, he was sent to continue his studies at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, where he earned a Licentiate of Canon Law in 1940. He received a Doctor of Canon Law degree from the Catholic University of America School of Canon Law in Washington, D.C., in 1942.

Following his return to Cleveland, Krol served as professor of canon law at St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary from 1942 to 1943. He served as vice-chancellor (1943–51) and chancellor (1951–54) of the Diocese of Cleveland. He was named a papal chamberlain in 1945, and was raised to the rank of domestic prelate in 1951. In 1950, he became president of the Canon Law Society of America.

==Episcopacy==
===Cleveland===
On July 11, 1953, Krol was appointed auxiliary bishop of Cleveland and titular bishop of &quot;Cardi&quot; by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following September 2 from Archbishop Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, with Archbishop Edward Francis Hoban and Bishop Floyd Lawrence Begin serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist. In addition to his episcopal duties, he was named vicar general of the Diocese of Cleveland in 1954.

===Philadelphia===
Following the death of Cardinal John Francis O&#x27;Hara, Krol was appointed the sixth Archbishop of Philadelphia by Pope John XXIII on February 11, 1961. His installation took place at the Cathedral of SS. Peter and Paul on March 22 of that year. He was the first Polish American to become an archbishop, and, at age 50, was the youngest Catholic archbishop in the country at the time. In his first sermon as archbishop, Krol spoke of the need for civic dedication and virtue, saying, &quot;I am conscious, too, of our beloved country, the bold idealism that inspired it, the courage that gave it birth. May God grant that our prayers, the moral integrity of our lives, the clarity of our teaching, and the sincerity of our patriotism help increase the spiritual resources without which no nation can survive.&quot;

Krol attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council between 1962 and 1965. During the Council, he served as one of six permanent undersecretaries, with responsibility for keeping a record of votes and distributing, collecting and tabulating ballots. He also served as a member of the central coordinating committee. Like Pope Paul VI, he was more liberal in social principles but sternly conservative in those of doctrine and church government. He condemned arms races and abortion, but supported clerical celibacy and disarmament.

He was created Cardinal-Priest of &quot;S. Maria della Mercede e Sant&#x27;Adriano a Villa Albani&quot; by Paul VI on June 26, 1967, during the same consistory that elevated Archbishop Karol Wojtyła of Kraków, Poland. Both were cardinal electors in the conclaves of August and October 1978. Wojtyła became Pope John Paul II in the latter conclave, and Krol served as one of his closest advisors.

After the first meeting between Church and Freemasonry which had been held on 11 April 1969 at the convent of the Divine Master in Ariccia, he was the protagonist of a series of public handshakes between high prelates of the Roman Catholic Church and the heads of Freemasonry.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Krol governed the Archdiocese of Philadelphia through an era where the population shifted to the suburbs. Krol campaigned for the canonization of Katharine Drexel, and was present at the canonization of his Czech-born predecessor in Philadelphia, Bishop John Neumann. He made a celebrated pilgrimage to Poland in 1972, and served as President of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops from 1971 to 1974. On April 5, 1970, he led prayer services at the White House for President Richard Nixon and the Johnson and Bush families; in addition to Nixon the former President Lyndon B. Johnson and the future Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush were in attendance. In 1985, Krol baptized Polish United Workers&#x27; Party defector Romuald Spasowski.

==Later life and legacy==
Krol was hospitalized in 1987 for treatment of diverticulosis. Due to his ill health, he resigned as Archbishop of Philadelphia on February 11, 1988, exactly 27 years after he was appointed to the post. He was succeeded by Anthony Bevilacqua.

Krol died at age 85 in Philadelphia, where he is buried in the crypt beneath the Cathedral-Basilica of Sts. Peter and Paul.

Cardinal Krol was criticized for his role in the archidocese&#x27;s sex abuse scandal some 10 years after his death. The Grand Jury stated that Krol knew that some priests under his command were molesting and raping young boys and girls but did nothing to prevent future crimes. A 2005 grand jury report cited evidence that both Cardinal Krol (Archbishop of Philadelphia 1961–1988) and his successor Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua (Archbishop of Philadelphia 1988–2003) had allowed dozens of sexually abusive priests to stay in holy orders by transferring them from parish to parish to avoid a scandal.

E. Michael Jones published a biography of Krol in 1995 titled &quot;John Cardinal Krol and the Cultural Revolution&quot;. The book covers Krol&#x27;s early life and his time as President of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops during the turbulent times of the 1970s. In order to give Jones sources for the book, Krol allowed Jones access to the Archdiocese of Philadelphia archives.

==Views==
Krol was widely considered to be a staunch conservative, even a &quot;traditionalist&quot;. As described by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he was &quot;an outspoken defender of traditional theology, hierarchical authority and strict church discipline.&quot; &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; recalled how Krol was &quot;[ha]iled by conservatives as a defender of the church&#x27;s heritage and criticized by liberals as an opponent of change.&quot; However, despite his conservative views on doctrine and church government, he was more liberal on social principles, such as nuclear disarmament and humanitarian programs.

===Abortion===
In 1973, he called the Supreme Court&#x27;s decisions overturning state laws banning abortion &quot;an unspeakable tragedy for this nation&quot; that &quot;sets in motion developments which are terrifying to contemplate.&quot; In 1974, Krol testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the Human Life Amendment proposed by New York Senator James L. Buckley. While mostly in favor, Krol argued that the amendment should drop the exception for when the mother&#x27;s life was in danger, so that should abortion be banned under all circumstances. Krol in his statement said of Roe v. Wade: 

===Marriages===
He opposed looser regulations governing marriages between Catholics and non-Catholics.

===Contraception===
He referred to the Catholic Church&#x27;s condemnation of contraception, reaffirmed by Pope Paul VI in 1968, as &quot;divine law.&quot;

===Nuclear disarmament===
In 1979, his Congressional testimony backing talks on limiting strategic arms foreshadowed an appeal in a pastoral letter by American bishops for nuclear disarmament in 1983. At the high tide of the nuclear freeze movement in 1982, Cardinal Krol told 15,000 demonstrators at a Philadelphia rally that it was time for governments &quot;to dismantle existing nuclear weapons.&quot; He later acknowledged that his belief in gradual and reciprocal disarmament, with strong safeguards against cheating, was probably not shared by all the demonstrators.

===Second Vatican Council===
After the close of the Second Vatican Council in 1965, he soon joined those alarmed by the pressures for change that the Council produced. He opposed many of the small accommodations or options in church discipline that gained favor after Vatican II, including looser regulations governing marriages between Catholics and non-Catholics, the reception of Communion in the hand, and attending Mass on Saturday evening instead of Sunday.

===Tax credits for Catholic schools===
In 1984, Cardinal Krol appeared with President Ronald Reagan at a campaign rally at the National Shrine of Our Lady of Czestochowa shrine in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, praising Reagan for trying to win tax credits for parents of children in religious schools. In the same year, the Cardinal delivered an invocation at the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas.

<doc id="773879" wikidata="Q241652" url="?curid=773879" title="Om mani padme hum">
<text>(, ) is the six-syllabled Sanskrit mantra particularly associated with the four-armed Shadakshari form of Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva of compassion. It first appeared in the Mahayana &quot;Kāraṇḍavyūhasūtra&quot;, where it is also referred to as the &quot;sadaksara&quot; (, six syllabled) and the &quot;paramahrdaya&quot;, or &quot;innermost heart&quot; of Avalokiteshvara. In this text, the mantra is seen as the condensed form of all Buddhist teachings.

The precise meaning and significance of the words remain much discussed by Buddhist scholars. The literal meaning in English has been expressed as &quot;praise to the jewel in the lotus&quot;, or as a declarative aspiration, possibly meaning &quot;I in the jewel-lotus&quot;. &quot;Padma&quot; is the Sanskrit for the Indian lotus (&quot;Nelumbo nucifera&quot;) and &quot;mani&quot; for &quot;jewel&quot;, as in a type of spiritual &quot;jewel&quot; widely referred to in Buddhism. The first word, &quot;aum/om&quot;, is a sacred syllable in various Indian religions, and &quot;hum&quot; represents the spirit of enlightenment. 

In Tibetan Buddhism, this is the most ubiquitous mantra and its recitation is a popular form of religious practice, performed by laypersons and monastics alike. It is also an ever-present feature of the landscape, commonly carved onto rocks, known as mani stones, painted into the sides of hills, or else it is written on prayer flags and prayer wheels.

Due to the increased interactions between Chinese Buddhists and Tibetans and Mongolians during the 11th century, the mantra also entered Chinese Buddhism. The mantra has also been adapted into Chinese Taoism.

== Meaning and effects ==
=== Semantic ===
Mantras may be interpreted by practitioners in many ways, or even as mere sequences of sound whose effects lie beyond strict semantic meaning.

The middle part of the mantra, &#x27;, is often interpreted as being in the locative case, &quot;wish-fulfilling jewel in the lotus&quot;, Sanskrit &#x27; &quot;wish-fulfilling/priceless gem, jewel, cintamani&quot; and the locative of &#x27; &quot;lotus&quot;. The lotus is a symbol present throughout Indian religion, signifying purity (due to its ability to emerge unstained from the mud) and spiritual fruition (and thus, awakening). &quot;Maṇipadme&quot; is preceded by the &#x27; syllable and followed by the &quot;&quot; syllable, both interjections without linguistic meaning, but widely known as divine sounds.

However, according to Donald Lopez (citing Tibetan grammatical sources) it is much more likely that &#x27; is in fact a vocative, addressing a bodhisattva called &#x27;, &quot;Jewel-Lotus&quot; – an alternative epithet of the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara.

Damien Keown also notes that another theory about the meaning of the mantra is that it actually invokes a female deity named Manipadmi. This is due to evidence from texts such as the &quot;Kāraṇḍavyūhasūtra&quot; which depict the mantra as a female deity. Also, as noted by Studholme, if the word is read as a vocative, it is most likely in the feminine grammatical gender, because if masculine, it would be a highly irregular form. Thus as Lopez notes, the original meaning of the mantra could in fact be an invocation of &quot;she of the lotus jewel&quot;, who is the &quot;vidya&quot; (wisdom) and consort of Avalokiteshvara and is equivalent to Shakti&#x27;s role &quot;vis a vis&quot; Shiva.

Regarding the relationship between the jewel and the lotus, Sten Konow argued that it could either refer to &quot;a lotus that is a jewel&quot; or to &quot;a jewel in the lotus&quot;. He argues that the second explanation makes more sense, indicating Shaivite influence through the imagery of the lingam and the yoni, both also terms associated with &quot;mani&quot; and &quot;padma&quot; respectively. Thus the mantra could in fact mean &quot;O, she with the jewel in her lotus&quot;.

According to Alexander Studholme however, the meaning of &quot;manipadme&quot; &quot;should be parsed as a tatpurusa, or &#x27;determinative&#x27;, compound in the (masculine or neuter) locative case&quot;, meaning &quot;in the jewel-lotus&quot;, or &quot;in the lotus made of jewels&quot;, which refers to:the manner in which buddhas and bodhisattvas are said to be seated in these marvelous blooms and, in particular, to the manner in which more mundane beings are believed to appear in the pure land of the buddhas. Given the predominance, in the &quot;Kāraṇḍavyūha&quot; and in the Mahayana in general, of the religious goal of the pure land of Amitabha, it may be safely assumed that &quot;&quot; would have been quite naturally associated with the mode of the rebirth of human beings there. The recitation of , then, the bringing to mind of the name of the Buddhist isvara, includes a declaration of the manner in which a person is reborn in Sukhavati: &quot;in the jewel lotus.&quot;

=== According to the &quot;Kāraṇḍavyūhasūtra&quot; ===

The first known description of the mantra appears in the &quot;Kāraṇḍavyūhasūtra&quot; (&quot;The Basket’s Display&quot;, c. 4–5th centuries), which is part of certain Mahayana canons such as the Tibetan. In this sutra, Shakyamuni Buddha states, &quot;This is the most beneficial mantra. Even I made this aspiration to all the million Buddhas and subsequently received this teaching from Buddha Amitabha.&quot; 

The sutra promotes the recitation of this mantra as a means to liberation. It states that whoever knows (&quot;janati&quot;) the mantra will know liberation as a fully enlightened Buddha. It also states that initiation into the mantra by a qualified preceptor (which is said to be a lay &quot;dharmabhāṇaka&quot;, &quot;vidyadhara&quot; or &quot;mahasiddha&quot;) is an important requirement for practicing this mantra. In the sutra, Avalokitesvara says that the mantra should not be given to one who has not seen the mandala. This initiation is said to be open to all Buddhists regardless of class and gender, whether they be of the Mahayana or Hinayana, but not to &quot;tirthikas&quot;.

The &quot;Kāraṇḍavyūhasūtra&quot; also sees the mantra as the pith or condensed expression of all &quot;eighty four thousand Dharmas&quot;. Because of this it is called &quot;the grain of rice of the Mahayana&quot;, and reciting it is equivalent to reciting numerous sutras. 

Thus, according to Studholme, the significance of the mantra in the &quot;Kāraṇḍavyūha&quot; is mainly that it is the &quot;innermost heart&quot; of Avalokitesvara, and therefore is &quot;a means both of entering into the presence of Avalokitesvara and of appropriating some of the bodhisattva&#x27;s power&quot;. Its practice is said to lead numerous positive qualities including:

* The seeing (&quot;darsana&quot;) the bodhisattva&#x27;s &quot;thousand-fold&quot; form, 
* Rebirth into the myriad worlds contained in the pores of the bodhisattva&#x27;s body 
* Innumerable samadhis (meditative absorptions), including the samadhi of &quot;rejoicing in loving kindness and compassion&quot; (&quot;maitri-karuna-mudito&quot;). 
* The development of &quot;great compassion&quot; (&quot;maha karuna&quot;)
* Accumulation of immeasurable merit
* Accomplishment of the six perfections
* Awakening (&quot;bodhi&quot;)

In this sutra, the &quot;sadaksari mahavidya&quot; (six syllabled great &quot;vidya&quot;) also appears as a goddess, &quot;autumn yellow&quot; in color, with four arms, with two arms holding a lotus and prayer beads, and the other two in anjali mudra. According to Studholme, these features are similar to the way the mantra &quot;Om nama shivaya&quot; is depicted in Shaiva texts, since &quot;both are concise &quot;vidyas&quot;, the &quot;hrdayas&quot; [heart] of their respective &quot;isvaras&quot;, sui generis means of attaining liberation, universally available, though of rare value and somewhat secret. Both are also, it has been argued, conceived of as forms of &quot;pranava&quot; [divine sound].&quot;

The &quot;Kāraṇḍavyūhasūtra&quot; was translated into Chinese in the 11th or 12th century and is part of the Chinese Buddhist canon.

=== In Tibetan Buddhism ===

The 11th-century Bengali master Atiśa Dīpaṃkara Śrījñāna, who was influential in bringing Buddhism to Tibet, also wrote a short treatise on the mantra called the &quot;Arya-sad-aksari-sadhana&quot;. Some Buddhist scholars argue that the mantra as practiced in Tibetan Buddhism was based on the &quot;Sadhanamala&quot;, a collection of &quot;sadhana&quot; or spiritual practices published in the 12th century. However, according to Peter Alan Roberts, &quot;the primary source for Tibetan Avalokitesvara practices and teachings&quot; is the 11th-century &quot;Maṇi Kambum&quot;.

Donald Lopez writes that according to a 17th-century work by the prime minister of the fifth Dalai Lama, the meaning of the mantra is said to be &quot;O, you who have the jewel and the lotus.&quot; That &quot;manipadme&quot; is in the vocative case is also supported by a 9th-century Tibetan grammatical treatise.

Lopez also notes that the majority of Tibetan Buddhist texts have regarded the translation of the mantra as secondary, focusing instead on the correspondence of the six syllables of the mantra to various other groupings of six in the Buddhist tradition.

For example, in the &quot;Chenrezig Sadhana&quot;, Tsangsar Tulku Rinpoche expands upon the mantra&#x27;s meaning, taking its six syllables to represent the purification of the six realms of existence:

==== According to Trijang Rinpoche ====
The tutor to the present Dalai Lama, Trijang Rinpoche (1901–1981) wrote a commentary on the mantra which states: Regarding mani padme, &quot;Jewel Lotus&quot; or &quot;Lotus Jewel&quot; is one of the names of the noble Avalokitesvara. The reason that he is called by that is that, just as a lotus is not soiled by mud, so the noble Avalokitesvara himself has, through his great wisdom, abandoned the root of samsara, all the stains of the conception of true existence together with its latencies. Therefore, to symbolize that he does not abide in the extreme of mundane existence, he holds a white lotus in his hand...He joins the palms of his two upper hands, making the gesture of holding a jewel to symbolize that, like a wish-granting jewel, he eliminates all the oppression of suffering for all sentient beings and bestows upon them all temporary and ultimate benefit and bliss.

==== According to the 14th Dalai Lama ====
The 14th Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso states:
:&quot;It is very good to recite the mantra Om mani padme hung, but while you are doing it, you should be thinking on its meaning, for the meaning of the six syllables is great and vast... The first, Om [...] symbolizes the practitioner&#x27;s impure body, speech, and mind; it also symbolizes the pure exalted body, speech, and mind of a Buddha[...]&quot;

:&quot;The path of the middle way is indicated by the next four syllables. Mani, meaning jewel, symbolizes the factors of method: (the) altruistic intention to become enlightened, compassion, and love.[...]&quot;

:&quot;The two syllables, padme, meaning lotus, symbolize wisdom[...]&quot;

:&quot;Purity must be achieved by an indivisible unity of method and wisdom, symbolized by the final syllable hung, which indicates indivisibility[...]&quot;

:&quot;Thus the six syllables, om mani padme hung, mean that in dependence on the practice of a path which is an indivisible union of method and wisdom, you can transform your impure body, speech, and mind into the pure exalted body, speech, and mind of a Buddha[...]&quot;

—Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama, &quot;On the meaning of: OM MANI PADME HUNG&quot;

==== Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche ====

: &quot;The mantra Om Mani Pädme Hum is easy to say yet quite powerful, because it contains the essence of the entire teaching. When you say the first syllable Om it is blessed to help you achieve perfection in the practice of generosity, Ma helps perfect the practice of pure ethics, and Ni helps achieve perfection in the practice of tolerance and patience. Pä, the fourth syllable, helps to achieve perfection of perseverance, Me helps achieve perfection in the practice of concentration, and the final sixth syllable Hum helps achieve perfection in the practice of wisdom.

: &quot;So in this way recitation of the mantra helps achieve perfection in the six practices from generosity to wisdom. The path of these six perfections is the path walked by all the Buddhas of the three times. What could then be more meaningful than to say the mantra and accomplish the six perfections?&quot;
—Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, &quot;Heart Treasure of the Enlightened Ones&quot;

== Transliterations ==
In English, the mantra is variously transliterated, depending on the schools of Buddhism as well as individual teachers.

Most authorities consider &quot;maṇipadme&quot; to be one compound word rather than two simple words. Sanskrit writing does not have capital letters and this means that capitalisation of transliterated mantras varies from all caps, to initial caps, to no caps. The all-caps rendering is typical of older scholarly works, and Tibetan Sadhana texts.

=== Variations ===
As Bucknell &quot;et al.&quot; (1986, p. 15) say, the complete Avalokiteshvara Mantra includes a final &quot;hrīḥ&quot; (, ), which is iconographically depicted in the central space of the syllabic mandala as seen in the ceiling decoration of the Potala Palace. The full mantra in Tibetan is thus: ཨོཾ་མ་ཎི་པདྨེ་ཧཱུྃ་ཧྲཱིཿ The &quot;hrīḥ&quot; is not always vocalized audibly and may be resonated &quot;internally&quot; or &quot;secretly&quot; through intentionality.

According to Sam Van Schaik, Tibetan works from Dunhuang which was a major cult center of Avalokitesvara, contain numerous mantras associated with this figure, the six syllable mantra only being one of many. Some of these are lesser known variations on the six syllable mantra such as: &quot;Om vajra yaksa mani padme hum.&quot;

Another variation, noted by Peter Alan Roberts, is &quot;Om manipadme hum mitra svaha&quot;.

<text>Bolle&#x27;s pigeon, Bolle&#x27;s laurel pigeon or dark-tailed laurel pigeon (Columba bollii) is a species of the genus Columba of family Columbidae, doves and pigeons, endemic to the Canary Islands, Spain. This bird is named after the German naturalist Carl Bolle, who was the first to distinguish it from the laurel pigeon. This wood pigeon is endemic to the laurel forest habitat.

==Description==
Larger than the common pigeon, a length of 36 cm to 38 cm. It is a large dark grey pigeon. At 37–40 cm, it looks like a very dark wood pigeon. Its dark grey, rather than brown, plumage and the dark bands on the grey tail distinguish it from the other pigeon endemic to the Canary Islands, the laurel pigeon. It is a basically dark grey bird, with a pinkish breast. It lacks any white markings, which together with its darker plumage distinguishes it from the other species.

With red beak, most intense at the tip. Head relatively large, slate gray, in males, with bluish or greenish metallic side of the neck and back of neck. Eyes rounded, yellow to orange with black pupil and lightly framed by a thin, flesh-colored eye ring. Back, rump and wings brownish gray, which in adult males with metallic blue shoulders. The primary and secondary remiges are blackish brown. The chest, blue-dark gray, stained purple in males. Belly is pale gray pastel. Females, less conspicuous, do not hold the highlights, reflections and metallic hues, and even the colors are more &#x27;gray&#x27; and off.

Mainly dark grey with blacker flight feathers and paler grey tail with dark terminal band, hindneck with green and pink gloss and reddish tinge to breast. Only likely to be confused with white-tailed laurel pigeon &quot;Columba junoniae&quot; or dark feral pigeon. The voice is a guttural mournful cooing. Hints: Look for birds flying low and fast over laurel forest. Its flight is quick, performed by regular beats, with an occasional sharp flick of the wings, characteristic of pigeons in general. It takes off with a loud clattering.

== Ecology==
Breeding occurs in trees especially in February–June. The nest, somewhat more elaborate than those of other pigeons, is built on the upper branches of a tree, with pieces of sticks and twigs, forming the classic platform, which is usually lined with mosses and lichens briefly. It lays one or two eggs. The egg hatch after a shared incubation of eighteen days.
Frugivore which eat drupes or fruits of canary bay (&quot;Laurus azorica&quot;), Madeira mahogany (&quot;Persea indica&quot;), (&quot;Ocotea foetens&quot;) and fayanuts of Myrica faya but can consume alternately diverse continental cultives, sweet acorns, hazelnuts, other nuts, berries...

==Distribution and population==

It is a resident breeder in the mountain laurisilva forest zone. Bolle&#x27;s pigeon builds a stick nest in a tree, laying one white egg. &quot;Columba bollii&quot; occurs on Tenerife particularly at Anaga and Teno, La Palma in a restricted area of the north-east), La Gomera in Garajonay National Park with some birds outside the park, and El Hierro where it occurs in Golfo and Sabinosa in the Canary Islands, Spain. It may formerly have occurred on Gran Canaria, as bones similar to those of a laurel pigeon have been found and there is a possible sight record from the late 19th century. It was common in the past, but disappeared from many areas owing to clearance of laurel forest in the islands. 
More recently the rate of laurel forest clearance has been slowed or stopped. Population estimates for the species are 1,160-1,315 birds in 1980, 6,000 individuals in 2001, and 5,000-20,000 most recently. Whether these figures reveal genuine population increases is unclear, but the area of occupied territory appears to be expanding and despite several potential threats the population is at least stable, probably increasing.

In 2007, the species was estimated by SEO Sociedad Española de Ornitología, BirdLife in Spain to number 5,000-20,000 individuals.

It occurs in dense laurel forest in mountainous areas, especially in ravines; also in heath of Myrica faya and Erica arborea, and sometimes in rather open areas, e.g. cultivation. It spends the hottest part of the day in deep shade. It feeds mainly on fruit but also takes grain and occasionally buds, leaves and shoots. It will gather in large concentrations on fruiting trees, plucking berries from the tree but also feeding on the ground. It makes some altitudinal movements to take advantage of ripe cereals and fruit at lower elevations in late summer.

Threats Historical declines resulted from intensive exploitation of laurel forests. The extent of forest loss has slowed, although fragmentation has continued in some areas as forests are exploited for poles and tool handles. A small amount of illegal hunting occurs at drinking sites. As it is a tree-nesting species, predation by introduced mammals including rats is of less significance than for C. junoniae but it remains a potential threat, the impact of which has not been fully assessed1. Grazing pressure from sheep is leading to habitat degradation on La Gomera and at El Hierro. Forest fires also pose a moderate threat to its habitat. Recreational activities cause some disturbance in the breeding season. The species is potentially threatened by outbreaks of Newcastle Disease and Tuberculosis.

The natural habitat is tall laurisilva forest or dense tree heaths which are cloud-covered for much of the year. The forests consist mainly of Azores Laurel, &quot;Oreodaphne foetens&quot;, Til, Madeira Mahogany, Canary Laurel, Faya, Lily of the Valley Tree and the Picconia. This species is highly mobile between different areas at different times of year.

It was very abundant when the islands were first colonised by humans, but was extirpated. The losses on the islands were largely due to deforestation for wood and to create agricultural and grazing land.

The exclusion of livestock from the native forest allows it to regenerate and create more suitable habitat. Some illegal hunting and poisoning continues because of the damage this pigeon can do to crops. Perhaps the main limiting factor on the rate at which the pigeon increases its numbers is eggs and young being taken by introduced black rats. It is now classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, an improvement on its Threatened status in 1988. This species is protected under the European Union Birds Directive, and the laurel forests under the Habitats Directive.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Columba&quot; is the largest within the pigeon family, and has the widest distribution. Its members are typically pale grey or brown, often with white head or neck markings or iridescent green or purple patches on the neck and breast. The neck feathers may be stiffened and aligned to form grooves. One of several subgroups within &quot;Columba&quot; consists of the widespread Eurasian common wood pigeon, Bolle&#x27;s pigeon, the Trocaz pigeon, and the African Afep pigeon. The two Macaronesian endemic pigeons, Bolle&#x27;s and Trocaz, are thought to be derived from isolated island populations of &quot;C. palumbus&quot;.

The Atlantic archipelagos of the Canaries, Azores, and Madeira have a volcanic origin and they have never been part of a continent. The formation of Madeira started in the Miocene and the island was substantially complete by 700,000 years ago. At various times in the past, the major islands of these archipelagos were all colonised by ancestral wood pigeons, which evolved on their respective islands in isolation from the mainland populations. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences suggest that the ancestor of Bolle&#x27;s pigeon may have arrived in the Canaries about 5 mya, but an older lineage that gave rise to another Canarian endemic, the laurel pigeon, &quot;C. junoniae&quot;, may date from 20 mya. The most recent wood pigeon arrival on Macaronesia was that which gave rise to the subspecies &quot;C. palumbus maderensis&quot;.

The Trocaz pigeon was formally described in 1829 by Karl Heineken. He recognised it as different from the now-extinct local form of the Madeiran wood pigeon a sub-species of the common wood pigeon. This is a monotypic species, although in the past the canarian Bolle&#x27;s pigeon was sometimes regarded as a subspecies of the Trocaz pigeon.

<doc id="773889" wikidata="Q7360108" url="?curid=773889" title="Rokusaburo Michiba">
<text>is a Japanese cuisine chef best known as the first Japanese &quot;Iron Chef&quot; on the television series &quot;Iron Chef&quot;. He was on the show from its inception in 1993 until his retirement on his 65th birthday, January 3, 1996.

==Career as Iron Chef==
Although Michiba is a Japanese chef, he is known for incorporating non-Japanese elements into his dishes. In his first battle against Yousei Kobayakawa (French cuisine trained), Michiba was given foie gras as a theme ingredient, which he subsequently won.

Michiba was also known for &quot;Inochi no Dashi&quot; (命の出汁, いのちのだし or &quot;Broth of Vigor&quot;), a combination of katsuobushi, skipjack tuna shavings and edible kelp (konbu), which he used in almost every battle.

===Awards and records===
Despite being the most senior of the Iron Chefs, he holds the Kitchen Stadium record for the most dishes prepared in a single battle: eight.

===Hobbies===
Michiba was also interested in calligraphy, often using the beginning of a battle to write a menu. On occasion, he forgot to write the menu, or wrote it at the last moment, which led to him losing multiple battles. In an episode where his sous-chef challenged Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto, Michiba explained that he wrote his menus to clarify what he wanted to present and to inform his assistants which ingredients to gather and prepare.

===Illness and retirement===
Michiba&#x27;s tenure was interrupted by an illness in mid-1995 that briefly hospitalized him. Afterwards, he began getting tired from the stress of appearing on the show and running his three restaurants: Poisson Rokusaburo in Akasaka, Ginza Rokusan-tei, and Kaishoku-Michiba in Ginza. The addition of a 4th Judge only worsened the Overtime Battles.

According to Takeshi Kaga, after deciding to retire, Rokusaburo Michiba vowed to recruit his successor himself. The show continued with just French Iron Chef Hiroyuki Sakai and Chinese Iron Chef Chen Kenichi for two months. Koumei Nakamura was appointed as his successor, initially refusing, but later accepting. Nakamura&#x27;s first battle was on March 1, 1996, against French chef Kiyoshi Suzuki. During the introduction of the theme ingredient of the day, Chairman Kaga stated that he wanted to choose foie gras because he wanted to partially re-create Michiba&#x27;s first victory by using the same ingredient.

Michiba was also supportive of Nakamura&#x27;s successor, Masaharu Morimoto, who also frequently used non-Japanese ingredients. The show often referred to the relationship between Michiba and Morimoto as that between master and student, especially after an episode where Michiba flew to New York to visit Morimoto&#x27;s restaurant, Nobu. Before Morimoto&#x27;s New York battle with chef Bobby Flay, Michiba gave Morimoto a large box of Katsuobushi flakes with a message: &quot;respect the old but seek out the new.&quot;

===Subsequent appearances===
Michiba made appearances throughout the 2012 revival (&quot;Ryouri no Tetsujin Dream Match! World Iron Chef Live Battle Special&quot;) of &quot;Iron Chef&quot; through interviews with former assistant Kenichi Miyanaga, a seat on the tasting panel, and as a competitor against new Iron Chef Jun Kurogi.

=== Iron Chef tie-in events ===
In 2017, Michiba participated in an Iron Chefs All Star Dinner event at Australia’s Sydney Opera House.

== Career outside Iron Chef ==
Michiba has operated several restaurants across Japan. The most notable of these is Kaishoku Machiba in the Ginza district of Tokyo. As of 2022, Michiba was still running these restaurants at the age of 91.

==Manga==
The manga series &quot;Kandō Ō Retsuden&quot; featured a story about Michiba in volume 2, named &quot;Michiba Rokusaburō Monogatari&quot;. It was compiled by Yasuo Negishi, as illustrated by Yoshihiro Takahashi.

<text>was the first French chef in the Japanese cooking show &quot;Iron Chef&quot;. He appeared from the first episode in 1993, sporting a green outfit while holding a bell pepper. Over the years, he has earned the nickname of &quot;The Artist&quot; for being creative with all his approaches to food. He has the highest winning percentage of any of the Iron Chefs due mainly to the fact that he fought only 8 battles: he won 7 and lost 1. He is the only Iron Chef never to tie. Ishinabe&#x27;s single loss was to Jacques Borie, a French chef who worked in L&#x27;osler in Tokyo. This was also the only of Ishinabe&#x27;s battles that was shown in America when Food Network aired the original series.

Ishinabe ended his Iron Chef career at the end of 1993 due to the stressful nature of the show, the one-hour time limit, and the judgement of his last battle, which he lost to Jacques Borie. However, he remained involved with the series, competing in one battle as an Iron Chef during the convalescence of Iron Chef Japanese Rokusaburo Michiba and assisting Iron Chef French Hiroyuki Sakai as part of the French team in the &quot;2000th Dish&quot; Special. He also was a guest commentator and judge on several occasions, most notably when regular commentator Dr. Yukio Hattori competed in a battle.

After appearing on &quot;Iron Chef&quot;, Ishinabe opened a chain of restaurants called &quot;Queen Alice&quot;. He lives in Paris, France.

<doc id="773923" wikidata="Q3304324" url="?curid=773923" title="1970 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1970 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1 and lasted until November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The season was fairly average, with 14 named storms forming, of which seven were hurricanes. Two of those seven became major hurricanes, which are Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson scale. Also, this was the first season in which reconnaissance aircraft flew into all four quadrants of a tropical cyclone.

The first system, Hurricane Alma, developed on May 17. The storm killed eight people, seven from flooding in Cuba and one from a lightning strike in Florida. In July, Tropical Storm Becky brought minor flooding to Florida and other parts of the Southern United States, leaving one death and about $500,000 (1970 USD) in damage. The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Celia, a Category 4 hurricane that slammed South Texas in early August. Celia resulted in about $930 million in damage and was the costliest hurricane in Texas until Alicia in 1983. There were 28 fatalities, with four in Cuba, eight in Florida, and sixteen in Texas. Later that month, Tropical Storm Dorothy caused severe flooding in Martinique, which left up to 51 deaths and $34 million in damage. One death occurred in Mexico as a result of Hurricane Ella after a house collapsed. In October, Tropical Depression Fifteen brought a devastating flood to Puerto Rico. At least 22 fatalities and $65.5 million in damage occurred. Collectively, the storms of this season left at least $1.03 billion in damage and 115 deaths.


== Season summary ==

The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, though activity began slightly earlier with Hurricane Alma forming on May 17. Although 21 tropical depressions developed, only fourteen of them reached tropical storm intensity. However, this was well-above the 1950–2000 average of 9.6 named storms per season. Seven of these reached hurricane status, slightly above the 1950–2000 average of 5.9. Furthermore, two storms reached major hurricane status, near the average 1950–2000 average of 2.3. Collectively, the cyclones of this season caused at least 115 deaths and over $1.03 billion in damage. The Atlantic hurricane season officially ended on November 30, though the final tropical cyclone became extratropical on December 1.

Tropical cyclogenesis began in May, with Alma developing on May 17. No tropical cyclone activity occurred in June. Three systems originated in July, including Tropical Storm Becky and the depression that would eventually intensify into Hurricane Celia, as well as another tropical depression that remained below tropical storm intensity. Celia became the most intense tropical cyclone of the season on August 3, peaking as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . In August, four tropical systems developed, including two tropical depressions, an unnamed hurricane, and Dorothy. September eight featured tropical depressions, though only three became named storms – Ella, Felice, and Greta. October featured two unnamed hurricanes. Two more systems, a tropical depression and an unnamed tropical storm, developed in November, the latter of which transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on December 1, ending the season&#x27;s activity.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 67. ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39 mph (63 km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity.

== Systems ==

=== Hurricane Alma ===
An area of disturbed weather persisted over the southwestern Caribbean in the middle of May. It gradually organized, and a tropical depression formed on May 17. In response to low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, the depression rapidly strengthened to a tropical storm early on May 20 and to a hurricane that night. However, increasing upper-level wind shear caused Alma to deteriorate back into a tropical depression on May 22. The depression continued its general northward movement, with a brief jog to the west, and struck Cuba on May 24 with maximum winds of . As Alma crossed the eastern Gulf of Mexico, it retained a well-defined circulation with an eye feature evident on weather radar, but the persistent shear limited the system&#x27;s intensity. Tropical Depression Alma made landfall near Cedar Key, Florida, on May 25 and became extratropical two days later over North Carolina.

Although Alma passed just offshore, impact in Central America, if any, is unknown. In the Cayman Islands, winds of 65 mph (105 km/h) were reported. Impact was most severe in Cuba, where flash flooding caused seven fatalities, destroyed several homes, forced the evacuation of 3,000 people in Oriente Province, and forced 16 sugar mills to suspend operations. The storm brought light rainfall to Florida, though precipitation peaked at near Miami. Thunderstorms caused one death in Miami and damaged some buildings in Fort Myers. In other states, impact came mostly in the form of rain, though a tornado near Columbia, South Carolina, unroofed one building.
=== Tropical Storm Becky ===
A large disturbance began to detach from the Intertropical Convergence Zone near Panama on July 16. By July 19, the disturbance developed into a tropical depression. After tracking through the Yucatán Channel, the depression became Tropical Storm Becky on July 20. Becky tracked northward to north-northeastward across the Gulf of Mexico and eventually strengthened to reach peak winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) late on July 20. Thereafter, upper-level winds began weakening the storm. By July 22, Becky made landfall near Port St. Joe, Florida, as a tropical depression. The storm weakened further over land, eventually dissipating over western Kentucky on the July 23.

Throughout Florida, Becky produced mostly light rainfall and gale-force winds. However, in Tallahassee, the storm dropped more than of rain, which caused flooding in and around the city. According to the Red Cross, 104 families in the Tallahassee region suffered flood-related losses. Additionally, two injuries were reported. Some houses near Tallahassee were flooded with of water, resulting in the evacuation of 15 households by rowboat. More than 100 cars in the area were also submerged. In nearby Wakulla County, knee-deep waters were reported at the county courthouse in Crawfordville. A tornado spawned near Panacea, destroyed a house and damaged two others. Light to moderate rain fell in neighboring states, and a tornado in Georgia caused one fatality and destroyed two homes.
=== Hurricane Celia ===
A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on July 23. It moved rapidly westward and reached the western Caribbean Sea by July 30. On the following day, the system developed into a tropical depression near Grand Cayman. The depression tracked north-northwestward and intensified into a tropical storm just prior to crossing far western Cuba on August 1. Due to warm sea surface temperatures, Celia soon intensified into a hurricane late on August 1 over the Gulf of Mexico. However, the storm failed to strengthen beyond Category 1 status until reaching the northwest Gulf of Mexico on August 3. Celia then underwent rapid intensification and at 21:00 UTC, the storm peaked as a Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a minimum pressure of as it made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas. Celia weakened while moving inland and dissipated over New Mexico late on August 5.

In Cuba, heavy rains on the island caused severe flooding, leading to five fatalities. Storm surge and swells lashed the west coast of Florida, especially the Panhandle. Several life guard rescues occurred, while eight people drowned. In Louisiana, abnormally tides caused minor coastal flooding. The strongest sustained wind speeds in Texas were around , while winds gusts were estimated to have reached as high as in Nueces County. Much of the damage was caused by a series of microbursts and downbursts, most of which occurred in a 15-minute span. Severe damage was reported in Nueces County, with 85% of Celia&#x27;s total property losses caused in Corpus Christi alone. Approximately 90% of downtown buildings were damaged or destroyed, while about one-third of homes in the city suffered severe impact or were demolished. Throughout the state, 8,950 homes were destroyed and about 55,650 others were damaged. About 252 small businesses, 331 boats, and 310 farm buildings were either damaged or destroyed. In Texas, Celia caused 15 deaths and $930 million in damage.
=== August hurricane ===

A tropical depression developed off the west coast of Africa on August 7, with organized convection and banding features. A day later, the depression passed south of Cabo Verde as it moved across the tropical Atlantic. On August 10, it intensified into a tropical storm, after the thunderstorms became more concentrated. However, a Hurricane Hunters flight two days later observed a weak system, suggesting the storm weakened back to a tropical depression. While approaching the Lesser Antilles, the depression turned to the northwest and re-intensified back into a tropical storm, with hurricane-force wind gusts north of the center. Late on August 14, the circulation opened into a trough. On August 15, a circulation reformed, and the system became a tropical depression again as it bypassed the eastern Bahamas. A day later, the system re-intensified into a compact tropical storm while turning northward. On August 17, the storm made landfalls along the Outer Banks of North Carolina, first on Atlantic Beach and later at Rodanthe. As the storm accelerated northeastward, it intensified into a hurricane, with peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h), based on the well-defined eye and a report from a nearby ship. On August 18, the system became extratropical south of Newfoundland, and subsequently it slowed and shifted its track back to the south, only to resume an easterly track on August 21. Late on August 24, the former hurricane dissipated north of the Azores.

Along the coast of North Carolina, higher than normal tides capsized about 20 boats, including a yacht. At Salvo, where the tide may have reached above normal, boardwalks and camping equipment were damaged at the campgrounds. Heavy squalls produced winds as strong as 75 mph (120 km/h) in Atlantic Beach. Minor wind damage was reported in Atlantic Beach and Morehead City, primarily limited to some trees, power lines, roof shingles, television antennas, and signs. From North Carolina to Maryland, lifeguards made dozens of rescues. Four drowning deaths occurred, with two in North Carolina and two in Virginia.
=== Tropical Storm Dorothy ===
A tropical wave moved off the western coast of Africa on August 13. Moving westward, a tropical disturbance spawned by the wave led to the formation of a tropical depression beginning east of the Lesser Antilles on August 18. As it moved west-northwestward, it slowly intensified, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dorothy several hours later. Around 06:00 UTC on August 20, Dorothy attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of , several hours before striking Martinique. After passing through the Lesser Antilles, Dorothy moved under an upper-level cold-core trough, which generated stronger wind shear and caused the storm to weaken. Early on August 22, Dorothy degenerated into a trough south of Puerto Rico.

Throughout the Lesser Antilles, Dorothy produced high winds and heavy rainfall. On Martinique, large amounts of precipitation resulted in flooding and mudslides, which in turn, caused bridge collapses and damage to homes. In addition, strong tropical storm force winds were also reported on the island. The storm destroyed 186 homes and left 700 people homeless. Banana, sugar cane, and other crops sustained heavy losses. Flooding rains also overspread Dominica and Guadeloupe, but with less severe effects. While the exact death toll of Dorothy is unknown, some sources claim that as many as 51 fatalities occurred. Storm damage amounted to $34 million.
=== Early September tropical storm ===

A tropical wave exited the coast of Africa on August 29 and progressed westward, with associated thunderstorms evident on satellite imagery. The system&#x27;s structure organized, evolving into a tropical depression by September 3. A trough to its north steered the nascent depression northward. Despite the presence of wind shear, the depression intensified as its area of thunderstorms expanded. On September 5, the Hurricane Hunters flew into the system and estimated sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h), making it a tropical storm. The continued shear displaced the thunderstorms to the east of the center, as the circulation began moving to the west-southwest. On September 7, the storm weakened back to a tropical depression. On September 11, it passed north of the Lesser Antilles, still as a weak depression. After passing north of Puerto Rico, the depression dissipated on September 13 north of Hispaniola. The remnants continued westward without developing. 
=== Hurricane Ella ===
A well-defined trough spawned a tropical depression near Cabo Gracias a Dios, Honduras, on September 8. The depression moved northwestward without intensifying before striking Tulum, Quintana Roo, on September 10. Hours later, the system emerged into the Gulf of Mexico and soon strengthened into Tropical Storm Ella. A ridge to the north caused it to curve in a general westward direction. Just six hours after becoming a tropical storm, Ella intensified into a hurricane early on September 11. While approaching the Gulf Coast of Mexico, the cyclone deepened significantly, peaking as a Category 3 hurricane on September 12 with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) and a minimum pressure of . Shortly thereafter, Ella made landfall near La Pesca, Tamaulipas, at the same intensity. The hurricane rapidly weakened inland, falling to tropical storm intensity on September 13 and dissipating several hours later.

In the Yucatán Peninsula, wind gusts of 55 mph (90 km/h) were observed. Ella brought heavy rainfall to portions of northeastern Mexico. Several homes were destroyed and villages along the San Marcos River were inundated by water. One girl died after her house collapsed. Flooding and continuous precipitation prevented the transportation of relief items, including food and medicine, by helicopters. In Texas, tides peaked at above normal, but no coastal flooding damage was reported.
=== Tropical Storm Felice ===
On September 12, a tropical depression developed from an upper-level trough just south of Abaco Islands. Without significant intensification, the system crossed the Florida Keys and entered the Gulf of Mexico. Felice remained a disorganized storm for its entire duration, plagued by dry air, a lack of deep thunderstorm activity, and an ill-defined center of circulation. However, early on September 16, the cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Felice tracked northwestward and brushed southern Louisiana on September 15, before making landfall near Galveston, Texas, later that day. Once ashore, Felice quickly deteriorated as it recurved into the central United States, dissipating on September 18. While over southeastern Oklahoma, however, its remnants still closely resembled a formidable tropical cyclone.

In advance of the cyclone, officials advised residents in vulnerable communities to evacuate their homes, and temporary storm shelters were established. However, the effects from Felice were generally light. Beneficial rains fell over parts of southern Florida, while sections of coastal Louisiana experienced minimal gale-force winds and above-normal tides. In Texas, winds gusting to 55 mph (89 km/h) at Galveston—and estimated near 70 mph (110 km/h) elsewhere—caused scattered power outages and minor tree damage, while heavy rainfall totaling over 6 in (150 mm) triggered some street flooding. Felice delayed the local rice harvest and ruined some hay that had been cut before the storm. Significant precipitation and gusty winds accompanied the system into northern Texas and Oklahoma.
=== Late September tropical storm ===

The interaction of a tropical wave and a weakening front spawned an area of disturbed weather northeast of the Leeward Islands on September 18. It organized into a tropical depression by 18:00 UTC on September 19 and further strengthened into a tropical storm 24 hours later. Shortly thereafter, the system reached peak winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) as it maintained compact convection and attendant spiral bands into its center. By September 22, however, the storm became disheveled as its center became exposed west of the thunderstorms; at 00:00 UTC the next day, the storm opened up into a trough.
=== Early October hurricane ===
A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa September 24, and for several days maintained a general westward track. On September 30, a flight from the Hurricane Hunters observed a well-defined circulation, while ships in the area reported gale-force winds; these observations indicated that a tropical storm had developed. The storm moved west-southwestward, passing St. Lucia and St. Vincent into the Caribbean Sea on October 2. It weakened thereafter, briefly degenerating into a trough before redeveloping into a tropical depression on October 5. It re-intensified into a tropical storm as it meandered south of Hispaniola, eventually hitting the Dominican Republic on October 8 as a tropical depression. It crossed the island into the Atlantic and moved northeastward ahead of an approaching cold front, briefly becoming a tropical storm again on October 10. The storm became extratropical as it integrated with the trough on October 11, moving quickly to the east and east-northeast. Thunderstorms increased on October 14, and a day later, the stalled about halfway between the Azores and Madeira due to a ridge over northern Europe. By that time, the system became integrated with an upper-level low while no longer associated with the front; as a result, it became a subtropical storm. Turning back to the west, the storm re-intensified, becoming a fully tropical hurricane on October 17. A day later, it attained peak winds of 85 mph (135 km/h). The hurricane turned to the north, weakening back to a tropical storm on October 20. A day later, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, which was absorbed by another cyclone southeast of Greenland on October 22.

The system produced heavy rainfall in the Lesser Antilles, reaching on Barbados; it left three deaths and moderate damage on the island. Another death was reported in the United States Virgin Islands. Torrential rainfall in Puerto Rico inflicted heavy damage, with precipitation peaking at in Jayuya, of which fell in a 24‑hour period, far exceeding the peak rainfall amounts during the 1928 and 1899 hurricanes. Most of the damage was inflicted to sugar cane and coffee crops. Additionally, at least 600 houses were destroyed and another 1,000 sustained damage, while about 10,000 people were left homeless. The storm affected at least 40 state roads, including 15 blocked by landslides, and 11 bridges destroyed. Overall, damage in Puerto Rico totaled $65 million. At least 18 people were killed on the island, and the system was considered one of the worst disasters in Puerto Rican history.
=== Tropical Storm Greta ===

A tropical wave exited western Africa and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean on September 15. It moved slowly westward until September 22, when a high-pressure area caused it to accelerate west-northwestward towards the Leeward Islands. By the next day, the wave interacted with a cold-core low, producing an area of convection. As the system moved over warmer waters, a surface low formed on September 26. As a result of gale-force winds being observed, the system was then designated as Tropical Storm Greta. However, the storm did not strengthen, despite favorable conditions, and as a result, it was described by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) as a &quot;bomb that did not explode&quot;.

While approaching the Florida Keys, Greta abruptly weakened to a tropical depression, coinciding with deterioration of the cloud pattern. In addition, Hurricane Hunters reported rising pressures and lower winds. On the evening of September 27, Greta made landfall in Key West, Florida, with sustained winds of . Once in the Gulf of Mexico, Greta did not re-intensify, though it retained a closed circulation while moving around a high-pressure area. It moved across the northern Yucatán Peninsula, though it quickly re-emerged into the Gulf of Mexico. Eventually, Greta made landfall near Tampico, Mexico, on October 5, and dissipated shortly thereafter. Due to the weak nature of the storm, minimal impact was reported. In Florida, tides were generally minor, and were no more than above normal, as reported in the Florida Keys. Rainfall was mostly light, though of precipitation was observed in Fort Pierce.
=== Mid-October hurricane ===
On October 12, a subtropical depression developed while located northeast of the Bahamas. It steadily intensified and became a subtropical storm by the following day. After tracking east-northeastward, the storm made a sharp westward turned, followed by a curve to the north-northeast. After fully acquiring tropical characteristics, the subtropical storm transitioned into a tropical cyclone early on October 16. Twelve hours later, the storm strengthened into a hurricane, shortly before passing near Bermuda. It continued to intensify and briefly became a Category 2 hurricane on October 17. The hurricane then accelerated rapidly northeastward, and made landfall on the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland as a Category 1 hurricane. Shortly thereafter, the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October 17.

The hurricane produced high winds on Bermuda, canceling classes, interrupting transportation, and closing businesses, though damage was minimal. In addition, light rain fell on the island. Throughout Newfoundland, hurricane-force winds caused damage to structures, mostly in the form of broken windows. Rough seas along the Atlantic coast of the island damaged fishing dories and a fishing ramp. Heavy rainfall was also reported in some areas of the region, reaching nearly 5 in (130 mm) in Quebec. Damage on the Burin Peninsula was in the thousands of Canadian dollars, although the specific figure is unknown. On the French territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, several buildings lost their roof due to high winds.
=== Late October hurricane ===

A subtropical depression developed about east-northeast of Bermuda at 12:00 UTC on October 20. After intensifying into a subtropical storm early the following day, further strengthening was slow. Initially, the system northeastward, but curved southeastward on October 24. During that time, it began acquiring characteristics of a tropical cyclone, transitioning into a tropical storm at 12:00 UTC. The storm resumed its northeastward motion and continued to intensify. Early on October 27, the storm strengthened into a hurricane. based on a report of winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) from the &quot;Pretoria&quot; several hours later. At the time of hurricane intensity, it is likely that the hurricane-force wind field was only in radius and its tropical storm force wind field was only in diameter. By 12:00 UTC on October 27, the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm and began accelerating. About 24 hours later, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while situated approximately north-northeast of Graciosa in the Azores.
=== November tropical storm ===
Toward the end of November, a cold front moved across the Atlantic Ocean, generating an extratropical storm near Bermuda on November 25. Thunderstorms developed near the center as the system&#x27;s wind field contracted. On November 27, the storm turned southward toward warmer waters and gradually dissociated itself from the cold front. On November 28, it transitioned into a subtropical storm, as its convection evolved into a comma-like structure. At that time, the system had peak winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). On November 29, the storm turned to the northeast ahead of an approaching cold front. A day later, the system transitioned into a tropical storm, by which time it was a small, well-organized cyclone with convection over the center. Late on December 1, the storm became extratropical again as it became embedded within the cold front. It intensified while accelerating over the north-Atlantic, attaining winds of near hurricane-force. After turning eastward, the powerful extratropical storm passed south of Iceland on December 4, and north of the United Kingdom a day later. The circulation dissipated on December 6 while near Scandinavia. 
=== Tropical depressions ===
There were several minor systems that were also classified as depressions by the NHC. A tropical depression developed offshore of North Carolina on July 28. Initially, the depression tracked toward the Outer Banks, but veered east-southeastward and avoided landfall. While nearing Bermuda on July 30, the depression slowly curved north-northeastward. By late on August 1, the depression dissipated while located east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. The system might have briefly become a tropical storm, based on a ship reporting gale-force winds.

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on July 31. It developed into a tropical depression developed on August 2 near Cape Verde. It moved west-northwestward across the eastern-North Atlantic Ocean and eventually curved nearly due eastward. The depression dissipated about halfway between Puerto Rico and the west coast of Africa on August 6. Another tropical depression developed near the African coast on August 11. A day later, it degenerated into a tropical wave, which continued westward across the Atlantic. On August 17, the remnants redeveloped into a tropical depression to the north of the Lesser Antilles. It turned northeastward and encountered wind shear, dissipating again on August 18.

On August 29, convection increased over the western Caribbean as a tropical wave approached the area, which subsequently moved into the Gulf of Mexico. On September 1, a tropical depression developed near the coast of Texas, and at 22:00 UTC, the system moved ashore near Corpus Christi. The depression moved northward, dissipating on September 2.

Another tropical wave exited the coast of Africa on September 4, developing into a tropical depression the next day. The system moved west-southwestward for much of its duration and dissipated by September 7. Later that month, the next system formed just east of Cape Verde on September 22. The depression dissipated on September 25, after moving northwestward across the far eastern Atlantic.

The tail-end of a front dropped into the southern Caribbean during the first week of November. An area of low pressure formed amid widespread thunderstorm activity on November 8, but the system fluctuated in organization over later days as it moved slowly offshore Nicaragua. By 00:00 UTC on November 13, a tropical depression finally formed near San Andrés. The system recurved northeast and reached winds of 35 mph (55 km/h) as it developed some spiral banding features. However, an approaching front moving into the northwestern Caribbean soon imparted shear on the system, causing it to dissipate between Grand Cayman and the Swan Islands early on November 15.

== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named tropical storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 1970. This is the same list used in the 1966 season, with the exceptions of &quot;Felice&quot; and &quot;Isabel&quot;, which replaced &quot;Faith&quot; and &quot;Inez&quot;, respectively. A storm was named &quot;Felice&quot; for the first time in 1970.

=== Retirement ===

The name &quot;Celia&quot; was later retired.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1970 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1970 USD.

<text>Frederick Woolnough Paterson (13 June 1897 – 7 October 1977) was an Australian politician, activist, unionist and lawyer. He is the only representative of the Communist Party of Australia to be elected to an Australian parliament.

==Early history==
Paterson was born and raised on a pig farm in Gladstone, Queensland. He was educated at Brisbane Grammar School and then studied classics at the University of Queensland, before joining the military when the First World War broke out. He subsequently saw action on the battlefields of France. While in France, he was involved in two food-related strikes, which were both successful.

In January 1920, Paterson moved to Merton College, Oxford to study theology, after becoming a Rhodes Scholar. However, by the time he sat for his honours degree in 1922, his belief in Christianity had changed. He had witnessed extreme poverty in Ireland and parts of London, and this concerned him. Not long after returning to Queensland, Paterson joined the Communist Party of Australia.

Paterson began studying law in 1923. By 1924, he was giving lectures on Marxism. Then, in 1925, he began working for the Workers&#x27; Educational Association. This saw him addressing unions, giving lectures on the history of the working-class, and trying to increase the association&#x27;s membership.

==Politics and the Communist Party==
In 1931, Paterson was admitted to the New South Wales Bar. He based himself in Brisbane, but later that year went to Townsville to defend two Italian workers, who had been charged with assaulting the Italian consul.

As the Great Depression set in, Paterson became involved in fighting racist employment policies in the sugar industry. At the time, the unions and employer associations had a policy of refusing employment to Italian workers to combat unemployment in the industry. Paterson led a campaign by both the Communist Party and the Italian community and was successful in ending the practice. In 1933, Paterson left Brisbane completely, and set up in Townsville. He spent his time juggling both a part-time legal career and his burgeoning role as a travelling activist for the Communist Party. By this time, he had gained a reputation as a fine public speaker.

In April 1934, Paterson was nominated by the Communist Party as their candidate for mayor of Brisbane but he was easily defeated by Alfred James Jones, the Labor candidate.

During the late 1930s, the Communist Party continued to grow rapidly in North Queensland, with Paterson at the forefront. He played a significant role in the union movement in the sugar industry during a key strike over workplace conditions, and became involved in the anti-fascist movement.

In 1939, Paterson stood successfully as an alderman for the Townsville City Council, becoming the first member of the Communist Party to win such an office in Australia. He was then re-elected in 1943. The same year, he stood for the federal seat of Herbert, but was defeated.

===Member for Bowen (1944–1950)===
The next year, he again made history, when at his third attempt, he won the State electoral seat of Bowen at the 1944 Queensland state election. While Paterson had polled slightly behind his rival in Bowen itself, he was far in front in the mining and sugar-farming areas, which resulted in a significant victory. He retained the seat at the following election.

During his time in parliament, Paterson advocated for a &quot;socialist post-war reconstruction&quot; aimed at achieving full employment. These policies included increasing nurse salaries, the implementation of the 40 hour work week into law, equal pay for women, capping rents in relation to the average income, and abolishing child labor on farms. Paterson also advocated for free publicly owned and managed housing, child care, nurseries, playgrounds, pharmaceuticals and hospitals, and the introduction of free education from kindergarten to &quot;the highest level at university&quot;. These public institutions would have been established through widespread nationalisation. He also advocated for the nationalisation of most key industries in Australia.

==Demonstrations==
After being elected to Parliament, Paterson largely gave up the law, to concentrate on his political career. He continued being actively involved in public issues, particularly through the union movement, and was a vocal critic of the government of the time. He often made speeches at the Domain in central Brisbane. Paterson was rewarded, retaining his seat at the 1947 state election. During the 1948 railway strike, he regularly joined the picket line in the mornings before going to sit in Parliament. He also gave the picketers legal advice. Paterson knew that the police had the power to order the picketers to move, but that they did not have the power to order them where exactly to move. He then devised a strategy where, as they were moved on by the police, the picketers simply moved around the block.

During a demonstration in Brisbane, on 17 March 1948, Paterson intervened when a police officer began to assault a demonstrator near Central station. Paterson was himself then struck from behind by another officer, and was rushed to hospital in an ambulance, unconscious. Paterson was unable to do any political activity for some months afterwards. An inquiry into the incident found that no wrongdoing had occurred and no police officer was ever arrested or charged with the assault. The ex-Queensland police officer and former Labor leader Bill Hayden later named the officer as sergeant Jack Mahony, who had boasted about using a pick handle on &quot;the &#x27;Commie&#x27; Fred Paterson&quot; during Hayden&#x27;s time as an officer.

While Paterson was recovering, the Queensland branch of the veterans organisation Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL) expelled him for being a Communist. However, his return to Townsville, once he had sufficiently recovered from his injuries to travel, was widely celebrated.

==End of political career==
In a 1949 redistribution, Paterson&#x27;s electorate of Bowen was abolished, and split between two new electorates: Burdekin and Whitsunday. Historian Ross Fitzgerald suggests that the redistribution was done deliberately to split Paterson&#x27;s electoral support and prevent him from being returned to parliament in the 1950 election. Paterson contested the election in Whitsunday, but lost to Country Party candidate Lloyd Roberts.

Paterson&#x27;s defeat at the 1950 election largely ended his political career. At the time, Prime Minister Robert Menzies was launching his anti-Communist campaign, and introducing legislation to prevent Communists from holding public office. Paterson was involved in the successful campaign against Menzies&#x27; anti-Communist measures together with Max Julius, and he continued to be involved in the union movement and Communist Party right up until his death in 1977.

Paterson and fellow communist Gilbert Burns were constantly the subject of surveillance by the federal security service more correctly known as the Commonwealth Security Service (CSS). The Brisbane office of the CSS was run by Bob Wake.

<text>William Lawrence Boyd (June 5, 1895 – September 12, 1972) was an American film actor who is known for portraying the cowboy hero Hopalong Cassidy.

==Biography==

Boyd was born in Hendrysburg, Ohio and reared in Cambridge, Ohio and Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he lived from 1909 to 1913. He was the son of day laborer Charles William Boyd and his wife Lida (née Wilkens). Following his father&#x27;s death, Boyd moved to California and worked as an orange picker, surveyor, tool dresser and auto salesman.

In Hollywood, Boyd found work as an extra in &quot;Why Change Your Wife?&quot; and other films. During World War I, he enlisted in the army but was exempt from military service because of a heart condition. More prominent film roles followed, including his breakout role as Jack Moreland in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Road to Yesterday&quot; (1925), which earned critical praise. DeMille soon cast him as the leading man in the highly acclaimed silent drama film &quot;The Volga Boatman&quot;. another critical success, and with Boyd now firmly established as a matinee idol and romantic leading man, he began earning an annual salary of $100,000. He acted in DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The King of Kings&quot; (1927) and &quot;Skyscraper&quot; (1928), as well as D.W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Lady of the Pavements&quot; (1929).

Radio Pictures ended Boyd&#x27;s contract in 1931 when his photo was mistakenly run in a newspaper story about the arrest of another actor, William &quot;Stage&quot; Boyd, on gambling and liquor charges. Although the newspaper apologized, explaining the mistake in the following day&#x27;s newspaper, Boyd said, &quot;The damage was already done.&quot; Boyd was virtually destitute and without a job, and for several years, he was credited in films as Bill Boyd to prevent being mistaken for the other William Boyd.

===Hopalong Cassidy===
In 1935, Boyd was offered the supporting role of Red Connors in the movie &quot;Hop-Along Cassidy&quot;, but he asked to be considered for the title role and won it. The original character of Hopalong Cassidy, written by Clarence E. Mulford for pulp magazines, was changed from a hard-drinking, rough-living, redheaded wrangler to a cowboy hero who did not smoke, swear or drink alcohol (he drank sarsaparilla) and who would allow the villain to start fights. Although Boyd &quot;never branded a cow or mended a fence, cannot bulldog a steer&quot; and disliked Western music, he became indelibly associated with the Hopalong character and, as with the cowboy stars Roy Rogers and Gene Autry, gained lasting fame in the Western film genre.

The films were typically more polished and impressive than were the usual low-budget programmed Westerns, with superior outdoor photography and recognizable supporting players familiar from major Hollywood films. Big-city theaters, many of which usually would not normally rent Westerns, noticed the high quality of the productions and permitted the series more exposure than they did for other Westerns. Paramount Pictures released the films through 1941 and United Artists produced them from 1943.

Producer Harry &quot;Pop&quot; Sherman wanted to create more ambitious epics and abandoned the Hopalong Cassidy franchise. Boyd, determined to keep the series alive, produced the last 12 Cassidy features himself on noticeably lower budgets. By this time, interest in the character had waned, and with far fewer theaters still showing the films, the series ended in 1948.

Boyd insisted on purchasing the rights to all of the Hopalong Cassidy films. Sherman no longer cared about the property, as he believed that Boyd&#x27;s appeal, as well as that of his films, had waned. Boyd sold or mortgaged almost all of his possessions to meet Sherman&#x27;s price of $350,000 for the rights and the film catalog.

===Hoppy rides again===
In 1948 Boyd, then regarded as a cowboy star of the past with his fortunes at their lowest, brought a print of one of his older films to the local NBC television station and offered it at a nominal rental, hoping for new exposure. The film was received so well that NBC asked for more, and within months Boyd released the entire library. The films became very popular and began the long-running genre of Westerns on television. Boyd&#x27;s desperate gamble made him one of the first national television stars and restored his fortune. As did Rogers and Autry, Boyd licensed merchandise, including products such as Hopalong Cassidy watches, trash cans, cups, dishes, Topps trading cards, a comic strip, comic books, cowboy outfits, home-movie digests of his Paramount releases via Castle Films and a new &quot;Hopalong Cassidy&quot; radio show that ran from 1948 to 1952.

Boyd identified with his character, often dressing as a cowboy in public. He was concerned about children and refused to license his name for products that he considered unsuitable or dangerous, and he declined personal appearances at which children would be charged admission.

Boyd appeared as Hopalong Cassidy on the cover of numerous national magazines, including &quot;Look&quot; (August 29, 1950) and &quot;Time&quot; (November 27, 1950). For Thanksgiving in 1950, he led the Carolinas&#x27; Carrousel Parade in Charlotte, North Carolina, with attracted an estimated crowd of 500,000, the largest in the parade&#x27;s history.

Boyd had a cameo role as himself in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s 1952 circus epic &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;. DeMille reportedly asked Boyd to take the role of Moses in his remake of &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;, but Boyd felt that his identification with the Cassidy character would make it impossible for audiences to accept him as Moses.

===Personal life===
Boyd was married five times, first to wealthy Massachusetts heiress Laura Maynes, then to the actresses Ruth Miller, Elinor Fair, Dorothy Sebastian and Grace Bradley. His only son, William Wallace Boyd, whose mother was Miller, died of pertussis at the age of nine months. After his retirement from the screen, Boyd invested time and money in real estate and moved to Palm Desert, California. He refused interviews and photographs in later years in order to not taint his memory as a screen idol. 

Boyd was a lifelong Republican and supported the campaign of Dwight Eisenhower during the 1952 presidential election.

For his contributions to the film industry, Boyd has a motion-picture star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1734 Vine Street. In 1995, he was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City. 

In 1972, Boyd died from complications related to Parkinson&#x27;s disease and congestive heart failure. He was survived by his fifth wife, Grace Bradley Boyd, who died in 2010. He is buried at the Sanctuary of Guiding Love alcove in the Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale).

<text>David Hurd (born 1950) is a composer, concert organist, choral director and educator.

Dr. Hurd was Professor of Sacred Music and Director of Chapel Music at the General Theological Seminary, Chelsea, New York City, for 39 years. He was also the Music Director at the Church of the Holy Apostles, also in Chelsea, until May 2013. He is presently the Director of Music at the Church of St. Mary the Virgin (Manhattan) in Times Square, New York City.

Hurd attended the High School of Music &amp; Art, the Juilliard School, and Oberlin College. He holds honorary doctorates from Berkeley Divinity School at Yale, Seabury-Western Theological Seminary, and Church Divinity School of the Pacific, given in recognition of his contributions to sacred music. In 1977 he received first prizes in both Organ Performance and in Organ Improvisation from the International Congress of Organists, being the only person to ever win both prizes in the same year.

Hurd has held several church staff positions, including Assistant Organist, Trinity Church, and Director of Music at the Church of the Intercession and All Saints&#x27; Church, both in Manhattan. His &quot;Intercession Mass&quot; setting is used by many congregations across the United States. With over 100 choral and organ works in print, his compositions have appeared in numerous recordings in both the United States and England. Hurd is regularly sought out by congregations and organizations seeking to commission new anthems and organ works. Significant premieres have included &quot;Gloria, gloria&quot;, for four-part choir and instrumental accompaniment, commissioned by the Boys Choir of Harlem, and premiered at Avery Fisher Hall; &quot;O the Depth of Love Divine,&quot; for four-part choir, brass and organ, commissioned by J. Neil Alexander, Bishop of Atlanta, and premiered at his consecration; and &quot;Arioso &amp; Final&quot; for organ, commissioned by the Queens Chapter of the American Guild of Organists. The most recent major work is &quot;Sonata for Saxophone and Organ&quot;, commissioned by the Hall-Powers Duo, and premiered in Ljubljana, Slovenia, at the International Saxophone Congress in 2006. In 2014, Hurd completed a commissioned anthem for St. Dunstan&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Atlanta, based on Psalm 100 in a modern, gender-neutral translation.

Hurd&#x27;s sacred compositions can be found in many hymnals, including the Episcopal Hymnal, 1982. Hurd is one of the world&#x27;s most visible and successful classical organists who is African-American.

<doc id="773936" wikidata="Q64737192" url="?curid=773936" title="Hopalong Cassidy">
<text>Hopalong Cassidy is a fictional cowboy hero created in 1904 by the author Clarence E. Mulford, who wrote a series of short stories and novels based on the character. Mulford portrayed the character as rude, dangerous, and rough-talking. He was shot in the leg during a gun fight, causing him to walk with a little &quot;hop&quot;, hence the nickname.

From the 1930s to the 1950s, the character became indelibly associated with actor William Boyd, who portrayed Cassidy first in a series of sixty-six films from 1935 to 1948, then in children-oriented radio and TV series, both of which lasted until 1952. Boyd&#x27;s portrayal of Cassidy had little in common with the literary character, being instead a clean-cut, sarsaparilla-drinking hero who never shot first. The plots of the film, radio and TV series were generally not taken from Mulford&#x27;s writings.

At the peak of the character&#x27;s popularity in the early 1950s, he spawned enormous amounts of merchandise, as well as a comic strip, additional novels by Louis L&#x27;Amour (writing as Tex Burns), and even a short-lived amusement park, &quot;Hoppyland&quot;, in Venice, Los Angeles.

==In literature==
Clarence E. Mulford wrote the first Hopalong Cassidy short story in 1904 while living in Fryeburg, Maine. He wrote the first novel, &quot;Bar-20&quot; (named after Cassidy&#x27;s ranch) in 1906. He wrote 28 Hopalong Cassidy novels in all, with the last one, &quot;Hopalong Cassidy Serves a Writ&quot;, being published in 1941. Not all of these novels focused on the Cassidy character; some focused on other characters in and around Bar-20.

In 1950, while the character was undergoing a surge in popularity, then-aspiring author Louis L&#x27;Amour was commissioned to write four additional Hopalong Cassidy novels, this time with a characterization matching William Boyd&#x27;s portrayal, rather than Mulford&#x27;s writings. L&#x27;Amour wrote the novels under the pseudonym Tex Burns. Although they were his first published novels, he was unhappy with the assignment, since he preferred the original character, and publicly denied authorship of the novels for the rest of his life.

In 2005, author Susie Coffman published &quot;Follow Your Stars&quot;, new stories starring the character. In three of these stories, Coffman wrote the wife of actor William Boyd into the stories.

==Film history==
As portrayed on the screen, white-haired Bill &quot;Hopalong&quot; Cassidy was usually clad strikingly in black (including his hat, an exception to the Western film stereotype that only villains wore black hats). He was reserved and well spoken, with a sense of fair play. He was often called upon to intercede when dishonest characters took advantage of honest citizens. &quot;Hoppy&quot; and his white horse, Topper, usually traveled through the West with two companions: one young and trouble-prone with a weakness for damsels in distress, the other older, comically awkward and outspoken.

The juvenile lead was successively played by James Ellison, Russell Hayden, George Reeves, Rand Brooks, and Jimmy Rogers. George Hayes (later to become known as &quot;Gabby&quot; Hayes) originally played Cassidy&#x27;s grizzled sidekick, Windy Halliday. After Hayes left the series because of a salary dispute with producer Harry Sherman, he was replaced by the comedian Britt Wood as Speedy McGinnis and finally by the veteran movie comedian Andy Clyde as California Carlson. Clyde, the most durable of the sidekicks, remained with the series until it ended. A few actors of future prominence appeared in Cassidy films, notably Robert Mitchum, who appeared in seven films at the beginning of his career.

The 66 Hopalong Cassidy pictures were filmed by independent producers who released the films through the studios. The first &quot;Hoppies&quot;, as the films were known, were distributed by Paramount Pictures to favorable returns, and United Artists was the distributor after Paramount. They were noted for fast action and outdoor photography (usually by Russell Harlan). Harry Sherman wanted to make more ambitious films and tried to cancel the Cassidy series, but popular demand forced Sherman back into production, this time for United Artists. Sherman gave up the series in 1944, but Boyd wanted to keep it going, and ended up co-producing 12 more films himself, from 1946 to 1948, now with lower budgets. The film series finally ended as &quot;B&quot; westerns were being phased out.

In the first film, Hopalong Cassidy (then spelled &quot;Hop-along&quot;) got his name after being shot in the leg. Hopalong&#x27;s &quot;drink of choice&quot; was the nonalcoholic sarsaparilla.

==Television==
Boyd thought Hopalong Cassidy might have a future in television, so he sold or mortgaged most of what he owned to buy the character rights from Mulford and the backlog of movies from Sherman, spending $350,000 to obtain the rights to his old films. He then approached the fledgling NBC network to air the films. The initial broadcasts were so successful that NBC could not wait for a television series to be produced and edited the feature films to broadcast length. On June 24, 1949, &quot;Hopalong Cassidy&quot; became the first network Western television series.

The series and character were so popular that Hopalong Cassidy was featured on the cover of national magazines such as &quot;Look, Life&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot;. Boyd earned millions as Hopalong ($800,000 in 1950 alone), mostly from merchandise licensing and endorsement deals. In 1950, Hopalong Cassidy was featured on the first lunchbox to bear an image, causing sales of Aladdin Industries lunch boxes to jump from 50,000 units to 600,000 units per year. In 1950, more than 100 companies manufactured $70 million of Hopalong Cassidy products, including children&#x27;s dinnerware, pillows, roller skates, soap, wristwatches (made by Timex), and jackknives.

There was a new demand for Hopalong Cassidy features in movie theaters, and Boyd licensed reissue distributor Film Classics to make new film prints and advertising accessories. Another 1950 enterprise saw the home-movie company Castle Films manufacturing condensed versions of the Paramount films for 16 mm and 8 mm film projectors; they were sold through 1966.

Thanks to the earlier series which showed edited versions of his films, Boyd began work on a separate series of half-hour westerns made especially for television; Edgar Buchanan was his new sidekick, Red Connors (a character from the original stories and a few of the early films). The theme music for the television show was written by Nacio Herb Brown (music) and L. Wolfe Gilbert (lyrics). The show ranked number 7 in the 1949 Nielsen ratings, number 9 in the 1950–1951 season and number 28 in 1951–1952. The success of the show and tie-ins inspired juvenile television westerns such as &quot;The Range Rider&quot;, &quot;Tales of the Texas Rangers&quot;, &quot;Annie Oakley&quot;, &quot;The Gene Autry Show&quot;, and &quot;The Roy Rogers Show&quot;.

==Radio==

The success of the television series made Boyd a star. The Mutual Broadcasting System began broadcasting a radio version, with Andy Clyde as the sidekick (except for episodes 28 to 53 of the 105 episode series, when, for reasons unknown, he was replaced by several different radio actors). The show was syndicated from 1948 to 1950, then began broadcast on Mutual on January 1, 1950. At the end of September, the show moved to CBS Radio, where it ran until 1952.

== In other media ==

=== Comic books/comic strips ===
Fawcett Comics published a Hopalong Cassidy comic book one-shot in 1943, followed by an ongoing series from 1946 to 1953 (numbered #1 through 85), when the company ceased publishing. DC Comics took over the title in 1954 with issue #86, publishing it until issue #135, in 1959.

Mirror Enterprises Syndicate distributed a Hopalong Cassidy comic strip starting in 1949; it was bought out by King Features in 1951, running until 1955. The strip was drawn by Dan Spiegle, with scripts by Royal King Cole.

=== Record readers ===
Beginning in 1950, Capitol Records released a series of Hopalong Cassidy &quot;record readers&quot; featuring William Boyd and music by Billy May, produced by Alan W. Livingston.

==Hoppyland==
On May 26, 1951, an amusement park named Hoppyland opened in the Venice section of Los Angeles. This was an expansion and retheming of Venice Lake Park (opened the previous year) as Boyd became an investor. Standing on it included a roller coaster, miniature railroads, pony rides, boat ride, Ferris wheel, carousel, and other thrill rides along with picnic grounds and recreational facilities. Despite Boyd&#x27;s regular appearances as Hoppy at the park, it was not a success and shut down in 1954.

== Museums ==
There have been museum displays of Hopalong Cassidy. The major display is at the Autry National Center at Griffith Park in Los Angeles, California. Fifteen miles east of Wichita, Kansas, at the Prairie Rose Chuckwagon Supper was the Hopalong Cassidy Museum. The museum and its contents were auctioned on August 24, 2007, owing to the failure of its parent company, Wild West World.

A &quot;Hoppy Museum&quot; consisting of a collection of products endorsed by William Boyd is located at Scott&#x27;s 10th Street Antique Mall in Cambridge, Ohio.

Topper&#x27;s saddle is on display at Twin Cities South Trailers, a horse trailer dealership in Pilot Point Texas.

William Boyd&#x27;s collection, including Hopalong&#x27;s TV production materials, is archived at the American Heritage Center at the University of Wyoming.

==Cultural references==
In the closing chapter of F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s 1925 novel &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, the title character&#x27;s father, Henry C. Gatz, explaining his son&#x27;s early character, is described &quot;...pull[ing] from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called &quot;Hopalong Cassidy&quot;. &#x27;Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows you.&#x27;&quot;

The 1951 song &quot;It&#x27;s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas&quot; includes a reference to &quot;Hopalong boots&quot; as a holiday gift desired by children. Hopalong Cassidy is also referenced in Buddy Alan and Don Rich&#x27;s 1970 top-twenty hit, &quot;Cowboy Convention&quot;. In 1973, fellow film cowboy Roy Rogers released a nostalgic ballad called &quot;Hoppy, Gene and Me&quot;.

The 1951 comedy film &quot;Callaway Went Thataway&quot; is a spoof of the then-ongoing Hopalong Cassidy craze.

Heisman Trophy winner and NFL halfback Howard Cassady was known as Hopalong Cassady throughout his career. 

In the 1985 film &quot;Fletch&quot;, the eponymous character, played by Chevy Chase, jokes that he was close to buying a house until he learned that Hopalong Cassidy had killed himself there. 

In 2009, the United States Postal Service featured Cassidy as part of a series of stamps depicting early TV characters.

<doc id="773937" wikidata="Q338861" url="?curid=773937" title="Kanda, Tokyo">
<text>is an area in northeastern Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan. It encompasses about thirty neighborhoods. Kanda was a ward prior to 1947. When the 35 wards of Tokyo were reorganized into 23, it was merged with Kojimachi to form the modern Chiyoda.

Kanda, together with Nihonbashi and Kyobashi, is the core of Shitamachi, the original downtown center of Edo-Tokyo, before the rise of newer secondary centers such as Shinjuku and Shibuya.

It is home to the Kanda Myojin (Shinto) shrine, devoted to the ancient rebel Taira no Masakado, who led an uprising against the central government during the Heian period with the aim of establishing himself as &quot;Shinnō&quot; (New Emperor) of an eastern Court. In the Edo period, the shrine&#x27;s festival was one of the three most noted in the city. It is also home to the &quot;Mausoleum of Confucius at Yushima&quot;, a temple dedicated to Confucianism.

Kanda is the home of the Tokyo Resurrection Cathedral which was built by Nicholas of Japan and is the main Cathedral of the Japanese Orthodox Church.

A popular Japanese franchise, &quot;Zenigata Heiji&quot;, from the literary series by Kodô Nomura, features a fictitious police patrolman (the title character) whose beat is Kanda. Near the end of every show, Heiji fells the dastardly villain by throwing a coin at him.

<doc id="773946" wikidata="Q254368" url="?curid=773946" title="Megumi Ogata">
<text>is a Japanese actress and singer from the Greater Tokyo Area. As a singer, she goes by the name em:óu. She attended Tokai University, but left because of her lack of interest. She is best known for voicing Shinji Ikari in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, Yugi Mutou and Dark Yugi in the Toei version of &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;, Makoto Naegi and Nagito Komaeda in the &quot;Danganronpa series&quot;, Kurama in &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot;, Sailor Uranus in the &quot;Sailor Moon series&quot;, Hanako and Tsukasa in &quot;Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun&quot; and Yukito Tsukishiro/Yue in &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot;.

==Biography==
Ogata began working as a musical actress, attending the same classes alongside Rumi Kasahara and Shiho Niiyama. She used to be affiliated with Aoni Production. Because of her husky voice, she is often typecast as either young men and boys or tomboyish women (a famous example of this being Sailor Uranus, a popular character from &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, known for being a charming tomboy in her civilian form). It is also because of this that she is sometimes referred as &quot;Aniki&quot; (&quot;Big Brother&quot; in Japanese, usually used in gangs) by fans. She married for the second time on April 1, 2004, and appeared with Ichirou Mizuki on NHK&#x27;s second anime song marathon on April 30.

<doc id="773955" wikidata="Q7249950" url="?curid=773955" title="Pronoun game">
<text>&quot;Playing the pronoun game&quot; is the act of concealing sexual orientation in conversation by not using a gender-specific pronoun for a partner or a lover, which would reveal the sexual orientation of the person speaking. Someone may employ the pronoun game when conversing with people to whom they have not &quot;come out&quot;. In a situation in which revealing one&#x27;s sexual orientation would have adverse consequences (such as the loss of a job), playing the pronoun game is seen to be a necessary act of concealment.

The pronoun game involves avoiding reference to one&#x27;s sexual orientation and allowing the listener&#x27;s assumptions on the matter to prevail. It also involves not drawing the listener&#x27;s attention to the fact that the sex of a pronoun&#x27;s antecedent is not being specified. As such, playing the pronoun game involves
*re-phrasing sentences such that they avoid the need for third-person singular sex-specific pronouns (e.g. &quot;We decided to eat out,&quot; rather than &quot;She and I decided to eat out.&quot;), often using amphilogism, a form of circumlocution (e.g. &quot;The person I was with and I decided to go to the play&quot;); 
*using gender-neutral language such as &quot;firefighter&quot; rather than &quot;fireman&quot;, phrases such as &quot;my partner&quot;, &quot;the better half&quot; or &quot;my significant other&quot;, or the person&#x27;s name where it isn&#x27;t gender-specific; and
*using gender-neutral pronouns that have long-since entered common usage, such as singular &quot;they&quot;, without employing uncommonly used (and thus attention-calling) neopronouns such as &quot;thon&quot;, &quot;hu&quot;, &quot;xe&quot;, &quot;sie&quot; and &quot;hir&quot; or the Spivak pronoun construction.

<text>Diatomaceous earth ( ), also known as diatomite ( ), celite, or kieselguhr, is a naturally occurring, soft, siliceous sedimentary rock that can be crumbled into a fine white to off-white powder. It has a particle size ranging from more than 3 mm to less than 1 μm, but typically 10 to 200 μm. Depending on the granularity, this powder can have an abrasive feel, similar to pumice powder, and has a low density as a result of its high porosity. The typical chemical composition of oven-dried diatomaceous earth is 80–90% silica, with 2–4% alumina (attributed mostly to clay minerals), and 0.5–2% iron oxide.

Diatomaceous earth consists of the fossilized remains of diatoms, a type of hard-shelled microalgae, that have accumulated over millions of years. It is used as a filtration aid, mild abrasive in products including metal polishes and toothpaste, mechanical insecticide, absorbent for liquids, matting agent for coatings, reinforcing filler in plastics and rubber, anti-block in plastic films, porous support for chemical catalysts, cat litter, activator in coagulation studies, a stabilizing component of dynamite, a thermal insulator, and a soil for potted plants and trees as in the art of bonsai. It is also used in gas chromatography packed columns made with glass or metal as stationary phase.

== Composition ==
Diatomaceous earth consists of the fossilized remains of diatoms that accumulated over millions of years. It is usually composed of 80% to 90% silica, 2% to 4% alumina minerals, and 0.5% to 2% iron oxide, although the precise composition of every deposit is different. Deposits may contain different amounts of silica depending on the sedimentation conditions, the presence of other sediments (clay, sand, volcanic ashes), and the age of the deposit (diagenesis, silica (SiO2) dissolution/precipitation, diatoms tests ageing). The species of diatom may also differ among deposits. The species of diatom is dependent upon the age and paleoecology of the deposit. In turn, the shape of a diatom is determined by its species.

Many deposits throughout British Columbia, such as Red Lake Earth, are from the Miocene epoch and contain a species of diatom known as &quot;Melosira granulata&quot;. These diatoms have a small globular shape. A deposit containing diatoms from this epoch can provide certain benefits over others. For example, diatoms from the Eocene epoch are not as effective in their ability to absorb fluids because as older diatoms recrystallize, their small pores become filled with silica.

== Formation ==
Diatomite forms by the accumulation of the amorphous silica (opal, ) remains of dead diatoms (microscopic single-celled algae) in lake sediment or marine sediments. The fossil remains consist of a pair of symmetrical shells or frustules. Marine diatomites are found in association with a wide variety of other rock types but lacustrine diatomites are almost always associated with volcanic rock. Diatomaceous chert consists of diatomite that has been cemented with silica.

Diatoms are able to extract silica from water that is less than 1% saturated in amorphous silica (saturation index (SI): -2). Their frustules remain undissolved because they are surrounded by an organic matrix. Clay minerals may also precipitate on the frustules and protect them from dissolution in sea water. When the diatom dies, the frustule is stripped of its organic layer and exposed to sea water. As a result, only 1% to 10% of frustules survive long enough to be buried under sediments and some of this is dissolved within the sediments. Only an estimated 0.05% to 0.15% of the original amount of silica produced by diatoms is preserved in the sedimentary record.

== Discovery ==
In 1836 or 1837, German peasant Peter Kasten discovered diatomaceous earth (German: &quot;Kieselgur&quot; when sinking a well on the northern slopes of the Haußelberg hill, on Lüneburg Heath in North Germany.

The extraction site on Lüneburg Heath was 1863–1994 Neuohe, while the storage sites were:
The deposits are up to thick and are all of freshwater diatomaceous earth.

Until World War I, almost the entire worldwide production of diatomaceous earth was from this region.

== Other deposits ==
In Poland diatomaceous earth deposits are found in Jawornik, and are composed mostly of diatomaceous skeletons (frustules).

In Germany, diatomaceous earth was also extracted at Altenschlirf on the Vogelsberg (Upper Hesse) and at Klieken (Saxony-Anhalt).

There is a layer of diatomaceous earth more than thick in the nature reserve of Soos in the Czech Republic.

Deposits on the Isle of Skye, off the west coast of Scotland, were mined until 1960.

In Colorado and in Clark County, Nevada, United States, there are deposits that are up to several hundred meters thick in places. Marine deposits have been worked in the Sisquoc Formation in Santa Barbara County, California near Lompoc and along the Southern California coast. This is the world&#x27;s largest deposit of diatomite. Additional marine deposits have been worked in Maryland, Virginia, Algeria and the MoClay of Denmark. Freshwater lake deposits occur in Nevada, Oregon, Washington and California. Lake deposits also occur in interglacial lakes in the eastern United States, in Canada and in Europe in Germany, France, Denmark and the Czech Republic. The worldwide association of diatomite deposits and volcanic deposits suggests that the availability of silica from volcanic ash may be necessary for thick diatomite deposits.

Diatomaceous earth is sometimes found on desert surfaces. Research has shown that the erosion of diatomaceous earth in such areas (such as the Bodélé Depression in the Sahara) is one of the most important sources of climate-affecting dust in the atmosphere.

The siliceous frustules of diatoms accumulate in fresh and brackish wetlands and lakes. Some peats and mucks contain a sufficient abundance of frustules such that they can be mined. Most of Florida&#x27;s diatomaceous earths have been found in the muck of wetlands or lakes. The American Diatomite Corporation, from 1935 to 1946, refined a maximum of 145 tons per year from their processing plant near Clermont, Florida. Muck from several locations in Lake County, Florida was dried and burned (calcined) to produce the diatomaceous earth.

It was formerly extracted from Lake Mývatn in Iceland.

The commercial deposits of diatomite are restricted to Tertiary or Quaternary periods. Older deposits from as early as the Cretaceous Period are known, but are of low quality.

Diatomite deposits rich in fossils have been located in New Zealand, but mining of the Foulden Maar deposits on an industrial scale, for conversion to animal feed, has drawn strong opposition.

== Commercial form ==
Diatomaceous earth is available commercially in several formats:
* granulated diatomaceous earth is a raw material simply crushed for convenient packaging
* milled or micronized diatomaceous earth is especially fine (10 μm to 50 μm) and used for insecticides
* calcined diatomaceous earth is heat-treated and activated for filters


== Usage ==
=== Explosives ===
In 1866, Alfred Nobel discovered that nitroglycerin could be made more stable if absorbed in diatomite (&quot;kieselguhr&quot; in German). This allowed safer transport and handling than pure nitroglycerin in liquid form. Nobel patented this mixture as dynamite in 1867; the mixture is also called guhr dynamite in reference to the kieselguhr.

=== Filtration ===
The Celle engineer, Wilhelm Berkefeld, recognized the ability of the diatomaceous earth to filter and developed tubular filters (known as filter candles) fired from diatomaceous earth. During the cholera epidemic in Hamburg in 1892, these Berkefeld filters were used successfully.

One form of diatomaceous earth is used as a filter medium, especially for swimming pools. It has a high porosity because it is composed of microscopically small, hollow particles. Diatomaceous earth (sometimes referred to by trademarked brand names such as Celite) is used in chemistry as a filtration aid, to increase flow rate, and filter very fine particles that would otherwise pass through or clog filter paper. It is also used to filter water, particularly in the drinking water treatment process and in fish tanks, and other liquids, such as beer and wine. It can also filter syrups, sugar, and honey without removing or altering their color, taste, or nutritional properties.

=== Abrasive ===
The oldest use of diatomite is as a very mild abrasive and has been used in toothpaste, metal polishes, and some facial scrubs.

=== Pest control ===
Diatomite is of value as an insecticide because of its abrasive and physico-sorptive properties. The fine powder adsorbs lipids from the waxy outer layer of the exoskeletons of many species of insects; this layer acts as a barrier that resists the loss of water vapour from the insect&#x27;s body. Damaging the layer increases the evaporation of water from their bodies, so that they dehydrate, often fatally.

This also works against gastropods and is commonly employed in gardening to defeat slugs. However, since slugs inhabit humid environments, efficacy is low. Diatomaceous earth is sometimes mixed with an attractant or other additives to increase its effectiveness.

The shape of the diatoms contained in a deposit has not been proven to affect their functionality when it comes to the adsorption of lipids; however, certain applications, such as that for slugs and snails, work best when a particularly shaped diatom is used, suggesting that lipid adsorption is not the only factor involved. For example, in the case of slugs and snails, large, spiny diatoms work best to lacerate the epithelium of the mollusk. Diatom shells will work to some degree on the vast majority of animals that undergo ecdysis in shedding cuticle, such as arthropods or nematodes. It also may have other effects on lophotrochozoans, such as mollusks or annelids.

Medical-grade diatomite has been studied for its efficacy as a deworming agent in cattle; in both studies cited the groups being treated with diatomaceous earth did not fare any better than control groups. It is commonly used in lieu of boric acid and can be used to help control and possibly eliminate bed bugs, house dust mite, cockroach, ant, and flea infestations.

Diatomaceous earth is widely applied for insect control in grain storage. It is used to control cannibalistic behaviors in confused flour beetles, which infest flour storages.

In order to be effective as an insecticide, diatomaceous earth must be uncalcinated (i.e., it must not be heat-treated prior to application) and have a mean particle size below about 12 μm (i.e., food grade—see below).

Although considered to be relatively low-risk, pesticides containing diatomaceous earth are not exempt from regulation in the United States under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and must be registered with the Environmental Protection Agency.

=== Thermal ===
Its thermal properties enable it to be used as the barrier material in some fire-resistant safes. It is also used in evacuated powder insulation for use with cryogenics. Diatomaceous earth powder is inserted into the vacuum space to aid in the effectiveness of vacuum insulation. It was used in the classical AGA cookers as a thermal heat barrier.

=== Catalyst support ===
Diatomaceous earth also finds some use as a support for catalysts, generally serving to maximize a catalyst&#x27;s surface area and activity. For example, nickel can be supported on the material—the combination is called Ni–Kieselguhr—to improve its activity as a hydrogenation catalyst.

=== Agriculture ===
Natural freshwater diatomaceous earth is used in agriculture for grain storage as an anticaking agent, as well as an insecticide. It is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a feed additive to prevent caking.

Some believe it may be used as a natural anthelmintic (dewormer), although studies have not shown it to be effective. Some farmers add it to their livestock and poultry feed to prevent the caking of feed. &quot;Food-Grade Diatomaceous Earth&quot; is widely available in agricultural feed supply stores.

Freshwater diatomite can be used as a growing medium in hydroponic gardens.

It is also used as a growing medium in potted plants, particularly as bonsai soil. Bonsai enthusiasts use it as a soil additive, or pot a bonsai tree in 100% diatomaceous earth. In vegetable gardening it is sometimes used as a soil conditioner, because like perlite, vermiculite, and expanded clay, it retains water and nutrients, while draining fast and freely, allowing high oxygen circulation within the growing medium.

=== Marker in livestock nutrition experiments ===

Natural dried, not calcinated diatomaceous earth is regularly used in livestock nutrition research as a source of acid-insoluble ash (AIA), which is used as an indigestible marker. By measuring the content of AIA relative to nutrients in test diets and feces or digesta sampled from the terminal ileum (last third of the small intestine) the percentage of that nutrient digested can be calculated using the following equation:

where:


Natural freshwater diatomaceous earth is preferred by many researchers over chromic oxide, which has been widely used for the same purpose, the latter being a known carcinogen and, therefore, a potential hazard to research personnel.

=== Construction ===
Spent diatomaceous earth from the brewing process can be added to ceramic mass for the production of red bricks with higher open porosity.

Diatomaceous earth is considered a prominent inorganic non-metallic material that can be used for the production of various ceramics, including production of porous ceramics under low temperature hydrothermal technology.

=== Home goods ===

Diatomaceous earth (DE) is used in some home products where dryness or the ability to wick away moisture is needed. In particular there are bath mats made of DE which absorb water from the bather and allow it to spread the material and rapidly evaporate. There are also spoons made of DE for scooping sugar and other hydroscopic kitchen ingredients.

== Specific varieties ==
* Tripolite is the variety found in Tripoli, Libya.
* Bann clay is the variety found in the Lower Bann valley in Northern Ireland.
* &quot;Moler&quot; (mo-clay) is the variety found in northwestern Denmark, especially on the islands of Fur and Mors.
* &quot;Freshwater-derived food grade&quot; diatomaceous earth is the type used in United States agriculture for grain storage, as feed supplement, and as an insecticide. It is produced uncalcinated, has a very fine particle size, and is very low in crystal silica (&lt;2%).
* &quot;Salt-water-derived pool / beer / wine filter grade&quot; is not suitable for human consumption or effective as an insecticide. Usually calcinated before being sold to remove impurities and undesirable volatile contents, it is composed of larger particles than the freshwater version and has a high crystalline silica content (&gt;60%).

== Microbial degradation ==
Certain species of bacteria in oceans and lakes can accelerate the rate of dissolution of silica in dead and living diatoms by using hydrolytic enzymes to break down the organic algal material.

== Climatologic importance ==
The Earth&#x27;s climate is affected by dust in the atmosphere, so locating major sources of atmospheric dust is important for climatology. Research indicates that surface deposits of diatomaceous earth play an important role. Research shows that significant dust comes from the Bodélé Depression in Chad, where storms push diatomite gravel over dunes, generating dust by abrasion.

== Safety considerations ==
Inhalation of &quot;crystalline&quot; silica harms the lungs, causing silicosis. &quot;Amorphous&quot; silica is considered to have low toxicity, but prolonged inhalation causes lung changes. Diatomaceous earth is mainly amorphous silica but contains some crystalline silica, especially in the saltwater forms. In a 1978 study of workers, those exposed to natural diatomaceous earth for over five years had no significant lung changes while 40% of those exposed to the calcined form had developed pneumoconiosis. Today&#x27;s standard diatomaceous earth formulations are safer to use, as they are predominantly made of amorphous silica and contain little or no crystalline silica.

The crystalline silica content of diatomaceous earth is regulated in the United States by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). There are guidelines from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health that set maximum amounts allowable in the product (1%) and in the air near the breathing zone of workers, with a recommended exposure limit at 6 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. OSHA has set a permissible exposure limit for diatomaceous earth as 20 mppcf (80 mg/m3/%SiO2). At levels of 3,000 mg/m3, diatomaceous earth is immediately dangerous to life and health.

In the 1930s, workers with long-term occupational exposure in the cristobalite diatomaceous earth industry who were exposed to high levels of airborne crystalline silica over decades were found to have an increased risk of silicosis.

Diatomite produced for pool filters is treated with high heat (calcination) and a fluxing agent (soda ash), causing the formerly harmless amorphous silicon dioxide to assume its crystalline form.

<text>Red Earth is the name of an international chain of stores selling cosmetics and body care products.

It was founded in Australia in 1989 as an environmentally aware alternative to mainstream companies, taking a similar line to the UK company The Body Shop. Since then it has become a fashion-following colour cosmetics brand.

The first shop was in the Melbourne Central complex in Melbourne, Australia. Red Earth now operates a number of stores across major cities in Australia and New Zealand. In 1993, it moved into the Asian market, opening stores in Hong Kong and Singapore. Since then, Red Earth has expanded into Canada, Thailand, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, China, the United States, Pakistan, and Japan.

In 2001, the company was purchased by Esprit. As a result, Red Earth products are also widely available in Esprit stores. In 2003, it also moved into the department store market, starting in New Zealand.

During the financial year ended on 30 June 2009, Esprit disposed the non-core, loss-making Red Earth brand and related operations.

Red Earth is present in over 20 countries with more than 1,000 stores.

<text>is a Japanese voice actress affiliated by 81 Produce. Some of her starring roles are Yao Sakurakouji in &quot;Miami Guns&quot;, Ran Kotobuki in &quot;Super Gals!&quot;, Winry Rockbell in &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot; (first anime), Sei Sato in &quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot;, Hikari (Dawn) in &quot;Pokémon&quot;, Revy in &quot;Black Lagoon&quot;, Seiren/Ellen Kurokawa/Cure Beat in &quot;Suite Precure&quot; and Miriallia Haw in Mobile Suit Gundam SEED &amp; Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny. In video games, she voiced Paine in &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;, Junko Enoshima in &quot;Danganronpa&quot;, Rosie in &quot;Valkyria Chronicles&quot;, Yukari Takeba in &quot;Persona 3&quot; (which was adapted into a film series) and Aqua in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;.

==Biography==

When she was in the upper grades of elementary school, she became addicted to anime when she watched &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and became a fan of Tōru Furuya who played the role of Yamcha in the anime series. While she was in her second year of high school, she watched Furuya&#x27;s role in &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, and while imitating the characters, she became interested in working as a voice actress.

After graduating from high school, her parents requested a vocational school of voice actors, but were told to go to high school. After graduating from high school, she had the goal of becoming a voice actor in Nihon Kogakuin, but opposed her family. She wanted to get a job related to voice actors and switch to the Department of Acoustics and Arts to become a radio personality. In radio program production training, she mainly practiced personality by taking charge of personality, and was used in subsequent radio conversations.

Though she was a student at the same school, she requested the Mars Girl Audition for the radio program &quot;Hiroi Oji no Multi Heaven&quot;. From high school until now, she had failed several auditions, so finished the test. However, she won the Grand Prix and made a regular appearance on the radio. Later, Shigeru Chiba, who co-starred on the radio, became a member of 81 Produce, in that same period as Chie Chiba and Ryoka Kashiwagi.

In 2007, she expanded the scope of her work, including the dubbing roles of the main character Kanna in &quot;The great success of Kanna!&quot;. The following year, she made her first appearance as a voice actress in &quot;Drama Battle Royale Gun Mage&quot; and &quot;The First Stage&quot;.

==Personal life==
She reported in the end of 2016 that she was married and pregnant. In 2017, she gave birth to a baby boy. She is very interested in theater.

<text>Delve Special was a UK BBC Radio 4 comedy starring Stephen Fry as investigative reporter David Lander. It ran for four series from 1984 to 1987, each series being four 30-minute episodes long. It was written by Tony Sarchet and produced by Paul Mayhew-Archer. The first series was wiped by the BBC but has since been found and consisted of a four-part investigation into the proposed building of London&#x27;s third airport in &quot;Shifton&quot;, a small village situated &#x27;just to the north east of Birmingham&#x27;, and the alleged bribery and corruption that accompanied the choice of location and building contractor.

David Lander&#x27;s investigative technique was usually somewhere between the questionable and the illegal - during each episode he also displayed some degree of ineptitude or lack of understanding in the subject matter he was reporting on. As a result, he occasionally found himself being set upon physically by those concerned. The programme heavily spoofed the style of topical radio reporters such as John Waite of &quot;Face the Facts&quot; and Roger Cook, a Radio 4 presenter who went on to television work such as &quot;The Cook Report&quot;.

Actors appearing in &quot;Delve Special&quot; included: Tony Robinson, Felicity Montagu, Stephen Frost, Mark Arden, Jack Klaff, Harry Enfield, Dawn French, Brenda Blethyn, Arthur Smith, Janine Duvitski, Philip Pope, Robert Bathurst and Andrew Sachs.

The theme music to the programme was &quot;Crunch&quot; by Soft Machine.

A follow-up television version ran for two series: &quot;This is David Lander&quot; (starring Stephen Fry) in 1988, and &quot;This is David Harper&quot; (starring Tony Slattery) in 1990 - Fry being unavailable for the second series due to other commitments.

<text>The Saab 29 &quot;Tunnan (&quot;The [[Barrel]]&quot;), colloquially also Flygande Tunnan&quot; (&quot;The Flying Barrel&quot;), is an early jet-powered fighter aircraft designed and produced by the Swedish aircraft manufacturer Saab. It was the second turbojet-powered combat aircraft to be developed in Sweden, the first being the Saab 21R, and it was the first Western European fighter to be produced with a swept wing after the Second World War, only being preceded in Western Europe as a whole by the Messerschmitt Me 262 built during the conflict.

Work on what would become the Tunnan commenced in late 1945. The design, internally designated &quot;R 1001&quot;, had a barrel-like fuselage due to being powered by the recently-developed de Havilland Ghost turbojet engine, giving it the distinctive rotund appearance from which its name is derived. A relatively thin swept wing configuration was adopted after wartime aerodynamic research from Germany indicated its favourable high speed qualities. The Swedish Air Force placed an initial order for three prototypes under the service designation &quot;J 29&quot; during Autumn 1946. On 1 September 1948, the first prototype performed its maiden flight; flight testing proved the aircraft to exceed performance estimates in several aspects.

During May 1951, Bråvalla Wing (F 13) received the first production aircraft. Five principal variants of the Tunnan were produced; the first model to enter service being the J 29A fighter, the more capable J 29B and J 29E fighters, and finally the afterburner-equipped J 29F fighter. A dedicated aerial reconnaissance model, the S 29C, was also produced. During the 1960s, several J 29Bs saw combat while stationed in the Republic of Congo as Sweden&#x27;s contribution to a UN peacekeeping mission (ONUC). The Austrian Air Force also operated the type. In service, the J 29 proved to be relatively fast and agile. The Swedish Air Force operated the type in both fighter and fighter-bomber roles into the 1970s.

== Development ==
Sweden had fallen behind the rapid technical progress being made elsewhere, and Saab needed to catch up in terms of aerodynamics and jet propulsion. Accordingly, project &quot;JxR&quot; was initiated in late 1945 and requirements were drawn up in October 1945. A pair of proposals were presented by the Saab design team, led by Lars Brising. The first of these, codenamed R 101, nicknamed &quot;cigarren&quot; (the cigar) due to its shape, bore a strong resemblance to the American Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star. The second design, which was chosen, was the barrel-shaped design, codenamed R 1001, which proved to be both faster and more agile.

The R 1001 concept had a straight wing, but after the engineers obtained German swept wing research data, it was given a 25 degree sweep. Information on swept wings came through Switzerland and included drawings for the Messerschmitt P.1101, P.1110, P.1111 and P.1112. SAAB&#x27;s project manager, Frid Wänström, collected these documents in 1945 from Messerschmitt engineers who escaped to Switzerland at the end of the War. Among them were engineer and aerodynamicist Hermann Behrbohm, who joined Saab&#x27;s J 29 team. These documents clearly indicated delta and swept-wing designs &quot;reduc[e] drag dramatically as the aircraft approached the sound barrier.&quot;

To make the wing as thin as possible, the undercarriage retracted into the fuselage, rather than the wings. Wind tunnel testing at the Swedish Royal University of Technology and by the National Aeronautical Research Institute also influenced its aerodynamics. These tests determined the required fuselage form to ensure it could attain the targeted critical Mach number, as well as supporting the use of a straight-through airflow to maximize thrust. Automatically locking leading edge slots, interconnected with the flaps, were also deemed necessary for lateral stability during take-off and landing. To further verify the swept wing, a Saab Safir was modified with a full-scale wing as the Saab 201. The finalized design, incorporating the new information was drawn up in January 1946.


The original powerplant was to have been the de Havilland Goblin turbojet, however, in December 1945, the more powerful de Havilland Ghost became available. This was ideal as not only was the Ghost set up for a circular air intake, its diameter would fit within the planned fuselage. Following negotiations between de Havilland and Saab, the Ghost engine was selected to power the type.

Despite early doubts for the supply of an equivalent to the American 75S aluminium alloy, Svenska Metallverken was able to manufacture it, although significantly larger sections were used than typical for aircraft construction. The structure employed heavy frames and stressed skin to meet conflicting requirements on space, strength, rigidity and accessibility.

The Swedish Air Force requested verification of the performance and a production plan for the project in February 1946. In Autumn 1946, the Swedish Air Force formally ordered three prototypes, with the type designation &quot;J 29&quot;. Static testing of the full-scale mock-up revealed problems with pressure cabin leaks, and concerning aileron behavior. A hydraulic system was installed to solve the latter issue. However, these modifications delayed the first flight until after the hoped for date of 1 August 1948.

The first flight by a &quot;Saab 29&quot; prototype was on 1 September 1948, was made by S/L &#x27;Bob&#x27; Moore, who was later the first managing director of Saab GB, UK. A problem with the landing gear affected the expected top speed of the aircraft. Following the flight, Moore described the aircraft as &quot;on the ground an ugly duckling – in the air, a swift.&quot; Because of the shape of its fuselage, the Saab J 29 quickly received the nickname &quot;Flygande Tunnan&quot; (&quot;The Flying Barrel&quot;), or &quot;Tunnan&quot; (&quot;The Barrel&quot;) for short. While not appreciated by SAAB, its short form was eventually adopted officially.

Four prototypes were built for the test program. The first two lacked armament, carrying heavy test equipment in their place instead. The third was armed with four cannons. Air brakes on the fuselage and on the wings behind the rear spar and both conventional and combined aileron/flap arrangements were tested. Flight tests revealed that the J 29 prototypes could exceed the maximum Mach number for which they had been designed and flight performance figures were typically in excess of predicted values.

Quantity production commenced in 1948; during May 1951, Bråvalla Wing (F 13) received the first production aircraft.

The Tunnan was produced in five main variants.

The J 29A fighter was the first model to enter service, and was followed by the J 29B and J 29E fighters, and finally the afterburner-equipped J 29F fighter, which was the final variant built. There was also a dedicated reconnaissance variant, the S 29C. Between 1950 and 1956, 661 Tunnans were completed, the largest production run for any Saab aircraft.

== Design ==

The Saab 29 Tunnan was the first Swedish aircraft to be specifically designed to use jet propulsion. Sweden&#x27;s first jet fighter, the Saab 21R, had been modified from the piston-engined Saab 21. It is a small, chubby aircraft with a single round air intake in the nose, with the pilot under a bubble canopy directly above the air intake duct on the upper-forward section of the fuselage. It has a very thin mid-mounted moderately swept two-spar wing which is a single structure attached to the fuselage by four bolts. The undercarriage is hydraulically operated, and was designed to be suitable for use from rough airstrips. To improve pilot survivability, the Tunnan used an ejection seat Saab developed in 1943, with an explosive jettisoning system for the canopy.

The Tunnan is powered with a single de Havilland Ghost turbojet which have a top speed in excess of , better performance than Sweden&#x27;s de Havilland Vampires. The engine was bolted to the fuselage at three points and a special trolley was used to remove the engine for maintenance. The final version had an afterburner, the first successful one used with a British jet engine.

Improvements were made to the wing to incorporate a dog-tooth leading edge, raising the critical Mach number. From 1963 onwards, all frontline J 29Fs were equipped with AIM-9 Sidewinder infrared-seeking air-to-air missiles.

== Operational history ==
=== Sweden ===

The J 29 was fast and agile, and set the world speed record on a closed circuit in 1954 at 977 km/h (607.05 mph). Two S 29C (reconnaissance variant) additionally set an international speed record of 900.6 km/h (559.4 mph) over a closed-circuit course in 1955.
The crash record in early service was poor, mainly due to the inexperience with swept-winged aircraft and the lack of a two-seat, dual control Tunnan trainer variant: this meant that Swedish fighter pilots could only be trained using two seat variants of the de Havilland Vampire (a straight-winged jet), before going solo in a Tunnan. 99 pilots were killed during military practice flights in Sweden.

In May 1967, the fighter versions of the Tunnan was retired from combat service; however, a number of aircraft were retained and reconfigured for use as countermeasures trainers and for target towing duties into the 1970s. In August 1976, the last official military flight was performed at the Swedish Air Force&#x27;s 50th anniversary air show.

=== Austria ===

On 27 January 1961, the Swedish Government authorized the Air Board to sell 15 J 29F Tunnans to Saab for restoration and resale to the Austrian Air Force. Like the Swedish counterpart, the Saab 29 came to be colloquially called “flying barrel” (&quot;Fliegende Tonne&quot;) or just “barrel” (&quot;Tonne&quot;) in Austria.&lt;ref name=&quot;F18 kamraten 58/18&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the sale of a further 15 J 29F aircraft to Austria was authorized. This second batch was modified so a camera pod could be installed in the port side of the nose of each aircraft, which required the removal of two cannons. The interchangeable camera pod could be exchanged in roughly 30 minutes, and the cameras could be redirected in flight from the cockpit. Due to the limitations of the 1955 Austrian State Treaty, these were never armed with air-to-air missiles. The Tunnan remained in Austrian Air Force service until 1972.

On 20 October 1964 at 9:48 a.m., two Austrian J 29Fs, of the second fighter bomber wing (&quot;2. Staffel/JaBo-Geschwader&quot;), took off from the base in Linz; the first, Bu. No. 29559 &quot;E&quot;, was piloted by Sergeant Johan Kemetinger, the second, Bu. No. 29627 &quot;L&quot;, was piloted by Staff Sergeant Alfred Erdler. In bad weather and a radio beacon mix-up, the pilots &quot;smoked&quot; and crossed the airspace of the then Czechoslovakia. Due to the bad weather, they could not even be intercepted by the emergency pair, who had to stay at the airport. The Austrian pilots thus got deep into the interior of the country and after finding that they had fuel for about the last 2 minutes of the flight, the pilots, believing that the field on which they landed was solid enough, landed in a field in the area of the village of Ořech in the Prague-West district. Coincidentally, just a few kilometres from the civilian Prague-Ruzyně airport. One machine lost its landing gear on landing, the other overturned on a ditch, the pilot was trapped and had to be rescued by people working in the field. Both pilots were returned to their homeland after two days. The planes followed them later by rail.

=== UN operations in the Congo ===

The Tunnan was the first Swedish jet aircraft to see combat. In response to an appeal by the United Nations (UN) for military support in September 1961, an initial force of five J 29Bs organized as the F 22 Wing of the Swedish Air Force, were stationed in the Republic of Congo as Sweden&#x27;s contribution to a UN peacekeeping mission (ONUC). They were subsequently reinforced by four more J 29Bs and two S 29C photo reconnaissance Tunnans in 1962. The Tunnans received &quot;UN&quot; identifying markings on their fuselages.

Most missions involved attacking ground targets with cannons and unguided rockets but no aircraft were lost in action despite heavy ground fire. The consensus of the crews and foreign observers was that the Tunnan&#x27;s capabilities were exceptional. Their secessionist adversaries used a few Fouga Magisters and other aircraft with no air combat capabilities.

Swedish pilots refused some requests for close air support to ground troops, reasoning that the risk of civilian casualties was too high. In November 1962, the Swedish air commander refused a direct order to destroy the secessionist&#x27;s Fouga Magisters since they were unarmed.

The only aircraft lost was by a high-ranking officer who crashed during an aborted takeoff for a test flight. When ONUC ended in 1964, some of the Swedish aircraft were deliberately destroyed at their base, as they were no longer needed in Sweden, having been superseded by later variants, and the cost of returning them wasn&#x27;t justified.

<doc id="773973" wikidata="Q606928" url="?curid=773973" title="Wilson (1944 film)">
<text>Wilson is a 1944 biographical film about Woodrow Wilson, the 28th president of the United States. Shot in Technicolor and directed by Henry King, the film stars Alexander Knox, Charles Coburn, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Thomas Mitchell, Ruth Nelson, Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Vincent Price, William Eythe and Mary Anderson.

Darryl F. Zanuck, head of 20th Century-Fox was an ardent admirer of Wilson and personally oversaw production. Character actor Alexander Knox was cast in a rare leading role as Wilson.

&quot;Wilson&quot; received critical acclaim, earning ten nominations at the 17th Academy Awards and winning five, including Best Writing, Original Screenplay. However, it was a notorious box office bomb due to its unusually high $5,200,000 budget (about $90,000,000 in 2025 dollars) and the unusually high admission price that theaters were forced to charge because of the exorbitant rental price. In a day when it cost 20 to 25 cents to see a movie, &quot;Wilson&quot; cost a dollar, keeping the general public away. A small-town exhibitor wrote, &quot;&quot;Wilson&quot; should rank as one of the greatest motion pictures ever made. Many small town exhibitors would not play it due to the price policy, but there is, I believe, in every hamlet a sufficient number of people who would be willing to part with a buck to see it.&quot; Darryl Zanuck was so disappointed over the failure of the film that for years he forbade Fox employees from mentioning the film in his presence.

== Plot ==
In 1909, Woodrow Wilson is the president of Princeton University and the author of several books on the democratic process. The local Democratic Party political machine convinces him to run for governor of New Jersey. After he wins the election in 1910, Wilson proves himself independent of the machine and its interests, fighting for progressive causes.

The U.S. is going through a progressive change in national politics and a split is developing in the Republican Party, providing a chance for Wilson to win on the Democratic ticket. He receives the party&#x27;s nomination and wins the presidency in 1912. He pushes through a series of programs, called &#x27;The New Freedom&#x27;. When World War I breaks out in Europe in 1914, Wilson tries to keep the U.S. neutral. At the same time, his wife Ellen dies of Bright&#x27;s disease.

Early in 1915, at around the same time of the sinking of the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot;, he meets Edith Bolling Galt, a Washington D.C. widow, whom he marries in December 1915. He wins reelection in 1916, and as he starts his second term, the war finally comes to America. In 1918, the Allies defeat the Central Powers, and Wilson travels to France to have a hand in the Paris Peace Conference. He intends to establish his long-promised League of Nations, but many Republican senators, including Henry Cabot Lodge, feel the president is leaving the United States vulnerable to future wars, and decide to block whatever treaty he brings back.

President Wilson takes the issue to the people in a multi-state tour, but his health fails and days after returning to Washington, he suffers a stroke. Edith shields the president and screens visitors, leading some to question how powerful she is and how much Wilson is truly acting as president. In the end, Wilson recovers enough to see the election of Republican Warren G. Harding, who has promised to keep the country out of the League of Nations. As Wilson&#x27;s administration ends, he laments his failure but remains hopeful that the League will, in some form or another, be successful in the future.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
&quot;Wilson&quot; was initially intended as a historical drama about a fictional American family living during the Progressive Era before being rewritten by Lamar Trotti into a biopic about Woodrow Wilson. Wilson&#x27;s daughter, Eleanor Wilson McAdoo, served as an informal counselor. Journalist Ray Stannard Baker, an authority on Wilson, served as an adviser.

===Casting===
Before Knox was cast as Wilson, Ronald Colman and Frank Conroy were considered. Claudette Colbert was also considered for one of Wilson&#x27;s wives. Dwight Frye was cast as Secretary of War Newton D. Baker but died of a heart attack on November 7, 1943, a few days prior to his filming start. Ernest Palmer was hired as cinematographer but had to be replaced by Leon Shamroy after falling ill, while James Basevi quit as art director due to disagreements with the rest of the crew.

===Filming===
With a budget of $5.2 million, &quot;Wilson&quot; was the most expensive film produced by Fox at that time. Much of the budget went to constructing accurate and detailed sets for White House locations such as the East Room, the Blue Room, the Oval Office and the Lincoln Bedroom. Scenes of the Democratic National Convention were shot at Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles while scenes set at Princeton were shot on-location in Trenton, New Jersey. Other scenes were shot at the Biltmore Theater in Los Angeles; Pueblo, Colorado; and Midwick Country Club in Alhambra, California.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Wilson&quot; was promoted by the NBC Blue Network radio show &quot;Hall of Fame Broadcast&quot; with a radio adaptation of sections of the script.

&quot;Wilson&quot; reportedly lost $2 million for Fox. Ticket sales were damaged due to the United States Department of War prohibiting the film&#x27;s exhibition on Armed Forces bases during World War II under provisions of the Soldier Voting Act against the screening of political material that could influence elections such as the ones about to be held on November 7, 1944.

===Reception===
The film received generally positive reviews but was not without its detractors. &quot;The New Republic&quot; film critic Manny Farber was particularly unenthusiastic, calling the production &quot;costly, tedious and impotent&quot; while writing: &quot;The effect of the movie is similar to the one produced by the sterile post-card albums you buy in railroad stations, which unfold like accordions and show you the points of interest in the city ... The producers must have known far more about the World War, the peace-making at Versailles, and Wilson himself, but that is kept out of the movie in the same way that slum sections are kept out of post-card albums ... About three-quarters of the way through, a large amount of actual newsreel from the first World War is run off and the strength of it makes the film that comes before and after seem comical.&quot;

President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a protege of Wilson&#x27;s, screened the film for guests at the Second Quebec Conference in 1944. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, however, was no fan. He excused himself in the middle of the film and went to bed.

===Awards===
Despite the negative press and lackluster commercial performance, the film received ten nominations at the 17th Academy Awards, winning five:
* Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, Color (Wiard Ihnen and Thomas Little)
* Best Cinematography, Color (Leon Shamroy)
* Best Film Editing (Barbara McLean)
* Best Sound, Recording (E. H. Hansen)
* Best Writing, Original Screenplay (Lamar Trotti)

&quot;Wilson&quot; was also nominated for:
* Best Picture (Darryl F. Zanuck)
* Best Director (Henry King)
* Best Actor in a Leading Role (Alexander Knox)
* Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture (Alfred Newman)
* Best Effects, Special Effects (Fred Sersen and Roger Heman Sr.)

==Preservation==
The Academy Film Archive preserved &quot;Wilson&quot; in 2006.

<text>George E. Browne was an American labor union leader.

Browne was active in the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), becoming business agent of its Stagehands Local No. 2, based in Chicago. In the 1920s, he won election as vice-president of the international union. In 1932, he stood unsuccessfully for the post of president, afterwards standing down as vice-president. He stood for the presidency again in 1934, winning the post without facing a contest. He was also elected as a vice-president of the American Federation of Labor.

In 1943, Browne was tried and convicted with co-conspirator Willie Bioff, of extortion of $1.2 million from Hollywood film studio producers after threatening them with labor strikes on behalf of the Chicago Outfit. Browne was sentenced to eight years in prison. However, both he and Bioff assisted the government in a trial of other members of the Outfit, and as a result, they were granted parole in 1944. That year, he was expelled from the IATSE.

In 1947, Paramount Pictures entered a motion to recover $100,000 from Browne, but dropped the case after its attorneys were unable to locate Browne.

<text>is a Japanese amateur astronomer.

He co-discovered several comets, including C/1968 H1 (Tago-Honda-Yamamoto), C/1969 T1 (Tago-Sato-Kosaka), C/1987 B1 (Nishikawa-Takamizawa-Tago). At the Satsuki Observatory established in 1996, Tago has supported and encouraged amateur astronomers in Yanahara, Okayama. Asteroid 7830 Akihikotago was named to honor his dedication.

He also discovered several novas, including V1493 Aql (Nova Aquilae 1999), V2275 Cyg (Nova Cygni 2001 no. 2), V574 Pup (Nova Puppis 2004), V2467 Cyg (Nova Cygni 2007) and V459 Vul (Nova Vulpeculae 2007 no.2).

In 2006 he was the first astronomer to discover a micro-lensing system outside the Magellanic Clouds and the bulge of our Milky Way. The star GSC 3656-1328 suddenly brightened by four magnitudes in two weeks time and returned to its normal brightness two weeks later. A red or a brown dwarf star passed exactly in front of GSC 3656-1328 and the gravity of the dwarf star directed more light to the observers on Earth.

He lives in Tsuyama, Okayama.

<doc id="773994" wikidata="Q2335330" url="?curid=773994" title="Steam (band)">
<text>Steam was an American pop rock music group, best known for their 1969 number one hit single, &quot;Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye&quot;. The song was written and recorded by studio musicians Gary DeCarlo (aka Garrett Scott), Dale Frashuer, and producer/writer Paul Leka at Mercury Records studios in New York City. The single was attributed to the band Steam, although at the time there was actually no band with that name. Leka and the studio group also recorded the first album of the band from which four other songs were released as singles in 1970.

==History==
===Background===
In the early 1960s, Frashuer and DeCarlo (born Gary Richard DeCarlo in Bridgeport, Connecticut on June 5, 1942) were members of a doo-wop group from Bridgeport, Connecticut variously known as the Glenwoods, the Citations, and the Chateaus, for which Leka played piano. The group separated but kept in contact. Leka became a songwriter with Circle Five Productions and in 1967, he wrote and produced the Lemon Pipers&#x27; &quot;Green Tambourine&quot; and other Pipers songs with Shelley Pinz.

===Steam===
In 1969, Leka was working at Mercury Records and convinced the label&#x27;s A&amp;R to record DeCarlo. With Leka producing, DeCarlo (under the professional name Garrett Scott) recorded four singles, all of which Bob Reno, the label&#x27;s head, thought would do well issued as an A-side. DeCarlo&#x27;s first single was to be &quot;Workin&#x27; On a Groovy Thing&quot;, but it was beaten by the 5th Dimension version released a week earlier. Then the company and Leka decided on &quot;Sweet Laura Lee&quot; as the next single and a B-side was needed. DeCarlo and Leka were asked to cut a B-side along with Frashuer. The trio chose to use a previously unrecorded song from their Chateaus days, which became &quot;Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye&quot;.

To the musicians&#x27; surprise, Reno decided that &quot;Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye&quot; should be an A-side. Leka thought the song was &quot;an embarrassing record... Not that Gary sang it badly. But compared to his four songs, it was an insult.&quot; To avoid a clash with DeCarlo&#x27;s planned solo career, Mercury issued the single on its Fontana subsidiary under the name &quot;Steam&quot;. Leka said the name was conceived after he saw steam rising from a manhole cover in the street outside the recording studio.

Released late in 1969, &quot;Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye&quot; reached number one in the United States for two weeks in December 1969. The song was also a Top 10 hit in the UK and Canada.

Leka hastily put together a touring group to support the hit single, none of whose members had actually played on the recording. The touring group consisted of: Bill Steer (vocals), Jay Babina and Tom Zuke (guitars), Mike Daniels (bass), Hank Schorz (keyboard), and Ray Corriea (drums). Leka, DeCarlo, and Frashuer did not take part in the touring group, although the three were credited as songwriters for Steam&#x27;s self-titled album. The second single from the album, &quot;I&#x27;ve Gotta Make You Love Me&quot;, reached number 46 in the U.S. on Billboard and 44 in Canada in February 1970.

Steam has also been a live touring band for 3 decades and under several reincarnations dating back to 1970 until its demise in 2006. Some of the touring members were, Tommy Scott Freda on vocals (1970 – 1996) and bass, Paul Freda on guitar (1970 – 1996), Alan Tebaldi on drums (1997 to 2006), Bruce Herring on percussion (1978), Howie Rose on bass (1997), Greg Bravo on vocals (1997 - 2006, and Bill Pascali on vocals and keyboards (1970s, 1980s, and 1990s).

===Later years===
Frashuer stepped out of the public eye. He died in 1998 at age 59. Leka became a successful songwriter and producer before his death in 2011. DeCarlo, whose solo career as Garrett Scott did not achieve chart success, left the music industry until making a comeback in 2014, performing at oldies shows.

By the beginning of the 21st century, sales of &quot;Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye&quot; had exceeded 6.5 million records. In 1977, Nancy Faust, the organist for the Chicago White Sox began playing the song to taunt the visiting team. Since then it has been used across the worlds of sport (particularly in relation to player ejections and strutting post-victory celebrations) and politics (at rallies to mock political opponents).

In 2014, DeCarlo released the album &quot;Long Time Comin&quot;&#x27;, which included a new version of his hit, 23 days after his 75th birthday. He died on June 28, 2017, after a battle with lung cancer,

Bill Pascali was a mainstay with the live touring band Steam. He is currently the last surviving member of Steam.

<text>Lipman Emanuel &quot;Lip&quot; Pike (May 25, 1845 – October 10, 1893) the &quot;Iron Batter&quot;, was an American star of 19th-century baseball in the United States. His brother, Israel Pike, played briefly for the Hartford Dark Blues during the season.

Pike was one of professional baseball&#x27;s first great sluggers, leading early professional leagues in home runs four times. Pike possessed &quot;great speed, a powerful, if erratic, throwing arm, and enormous power.&quot;

Pike was also the first Jewish baseball star and manager in America.

==Early and personal life==
Pike was Jewish and was born in New York into a Jewish Dutch family, and grew up in Brooklyn. His father Emanuel was a haberdasher. His mother was Jane, his brothers were Boaz, Israel, and Jacob, and he had a sister Julia. His family moved to Brooklyn when he was very young. Several of Pike&#x27;s ancestors were Jewish rabbis who emigrated from Portugal to the Netherlands.

==Baseball career==
Pike began in baseball when he was 13. Pike first rose to prominence playing for the Philadelphia Athletics (1860–1876), whom he joined in 1866. He brought an impressive blend of power and speed to the team, hitting many home runs as well as being one of the fastest players around. On one occasion he hit five home runs in one game.

However, it was soon brought to light that he and two other Philadelphia players were being given $20 ($ in current dollar terms) a week to play. Since all baseball players were ostensibly amateurs (though many were, like Pike, accepting money under the table), a hearing was set up by the sport&#x27;s governing body, the National Association of Base Ball Players. In the end, no one showed up to the hearing, and the matter was dropped. By , the Cincinnati Red Stockings became the first openly professional team, and Pike&#x27;s hearing, farcical as it seems to have been, paved the way for Harry Wright&#x27;s professionalization of baseball. The Athletics were very successful, but Pike was dropped from the team in 1867, because he was from New York, and thus a &#x27;foreigner,&#x27; calling his loyalty into question.

He moved on to the Irvington, New Jersey club and later in 1867 to the New York Mutuals, always a leading team, where he returned for 1868, having caught the eye of Boss Tweed. In 1869 he moved to the Brooklyn Atlantics, another perennial leader, where he hit .610. In , the Atlantics, with Pike manning second base, finally ended Cincinnati&#x27;s 93-game winning streak.

===National Association===
In , the National Association was formed as the first professional baseball league, and Pike joined the Troy Haymakers for its inaugural season. He was their star and for 4 games was the captain and manager, batting .377 (6th best in the league) and hitting a league-leading 4 home runs. He also led the league in extra base hits (21), and was 2nd in slugging percentage (.654) and doubles (10), 4th in RBIs (39), 5th in triples (7), 6th in on-base percentage (.400), 9th in hits (49), and 10th in runs (43). The Haymakers only finished 6th, though, and the team&#x27;s captaincy switched to Bill Craver.

The Haymakers revamped their roster for the season, and Pike headed for Baltimore, where he played for the Baltimore Canaries. Pike had another excellent season, leading the league in home runs again (with 6), RBIs (60), and games (56), and coming in 2nd in total bases (127) and extra base hits (26), 3rd in at bats (288), 5th in doubles (15) and triples (5), 9th in slugging percentage (.441) and stolen bases (8), and 10th in hits (84).

In , Pike led the league in home runs for the 3rd consecutive season, hitting 4, and was 2nd in triples (8), 4th in total bases (132), stolen bases (8), and extra base hits (26), 7th in slugging percentage (.462), 8th in doubles (14), RBIs (50), and at bats (286), 9th in hits (90), and 10th in games (56).

Pike was also one of the fastest players in the league. He would occasionally race any challenger for a cash prize, routinely coming out the winner. On August 16, 1873, he raced a fast trotting horse named &quot;Clarence&quot; in a 100-yard sprint at Baltimore&#x27;s Newington Park, and won by four yards with a time of 10 seconds flat, earning $250 ($ today).

Baltimore went bankrupt after the season, so Pike headed off to captain the Hartford Dark Blues for the 1874 season. The Dark Blues were a poor team, but Pike had another fine season, slugging .574 to lead the league, and coming in 2nd with an on-base percentage of .368.

Pike abandoned the weak Hartford team after a single season, switching to the St. Louis Brown Stockings. For the first time in his professional career, Pike failed to hit a home run, although he stole 25 bases. He also hit 12 triples and 22 doubles (leading the league) in what was probably his finest offensive season.

In all, Lip Pike has the National Association career home run (15) and extra base hits (135) records.

===National League===

In , when the National League replaced the National Association, Pike stuck with St. Louis. The Brown Stockings turned in a very good season, finishing a solid 2nd to the Chicago White Stockings. Pike continued to produce offensively, notching totals of 133 total bases (5th in the league) and 34 extra-base hits (2nd).

Seemingly never content to stay with a team very long, Pike headed to the Cincinnati Reds for the season. The Reds finished last. Pike was still a top-quality player, leading the league in home runs for the 4th time in the 1870s. However, age was starting to catch up with the 32-year-old Pike. He began the season as the 8th-oldest player in the league, and was the 4th-oldest player of the 1878 season. The 1878 Reds played very well, though. They finished 2nd, but Pike was replaced by Buttercup Dickerson halfway through the season and forced to look elsewhere for a team. He ended up playing a few games for the Providence Grays, and spent the next two years playing for minor league teams.

&quot;Sporting Life&quot; subsequently named him an outfielder on its 1870–1880 All-Star team.

Pike got a brief call-up in 1881 to play for the Worcester Ruby Legs, but the 36-year-old Pike could no longer play effectively, hitting .111 and not managing a single extra base hit in 18 at-bats over 5 games. His play was so poor as to arouse suspicions, and Pike found himself banned from the National League that September. He was added to the National League blacklist in 1881. He turned to haberdashery, the vocation of his father, and spent another 6 years playing only amateur baseball. He was reinstated in 1883.

===American Association===
In 1887, the New York Metropolitans of the American Association gave Pike another chance. At 42, he was the oldest player in baseball. The only game he played was more of a sending off than a new start, though, and Pike headed back to his haberdashery once more.

==Death==
Pike died suddenly of heart disease at the age of 48 in 1893. &quot;The Brooklyn Eagle&quot; reported that &quot;Many wealthy Hebrews and men high in political and old time baseball circles attended the funeral service.&quot; He was interred in the Salem Fields Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

==Legacy==
In 1936, decades after he died, Pike received one vote in the veterans election for the 1936 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting. He was not included on any further ballots.

Pike was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1985.

Pike was inducted into the New York State Baseball Hall of Fame in the Class of 2016.

Pike was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2024.

Pike was the first Jewish manager in major league history and one of only seven all-time.
