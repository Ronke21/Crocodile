<text>Saddleback Church is an evangelical, non-denominational Christian multi-site megachurch based in Lake Forest, California. It is the largest church in California, and one of the largest in the United States of America. The church has several campuses in California and around the world, as well as a number of extensions. Weekly church attendance was 30,000 people in 2023. Its senior pastor is Andy Wood, and his wife, Stacie Wood, is a teaching pastor. Saddleback was formerly associated with the Southern Baptist Convention, until 2023.

==History==

In 1979, Rick Warren, recently graduated in theology, settled with his wife Kay in the Saddleback Valley area of Orange County, California. He began to probe the people in his neighborhood to find out what prevented them from coming to church. The answers that emerged were boredom, distance from everyday life, lack of welcome for visitors, insistence on money and inadequate programs for children. It is with these concerns that the church began in 1980, with a Bible study group, with six people, the pastor Rick Warren and his wife, in their condo. The first worship service took place in the &quot;Little Theatre&quot; of Laguna Hills High School on Palm Sunday, in 1980. In 1995, it dedicated a new building in Lake Forest including a 3,500-seat auditorium.

In 2003, Saddleback Church, Kay and Rick Warren founded the P.E.A.C.E. Plan, a humanitarian development program for churches.

In November and December 2006, Saddleback Church played host to the second annual Global Summit on AIDS and the Church. The summit featured 60 speakers, including Senators Barack Obama and Sam Brownback.

On August 16, 2008, Rick Warren arranged a meeting between Senators John McCain and Barack Obama at Saddleback called the Civil Forum on the Presidency. The format of the forum was structured such that Warren first asked Obama a series of questions; he then asked McCain very similar ones subsequently. It was broadcast live on national news networks and streamed online. Tickets were distributed to the public through a raffle with seats listing as high as $1,000, and the event was sold out.

In 2018, the church said it had baptized 50,000 people since its founding. In November 2018, CBS News listed Saddleback Church as the eleventh largest megachurch in the United States with about 22,055 weekly visitors.

In 2022, Andy Wood became lead pastor.

===Expulsion from Southern Baptist Convention===
In 2021, the church was audited for compliance by the Southern Baptist Convention, after ordaining three women pastors that year and thus acting contrary to the Convention&#x27;s confession of faith (Baptist Faith and Message) which believes that the pastoral ministry is reserved for men. As of February 21, 2023, the church was removed from the SBC membership list due to the hiring of a female pastor in 2022, Stacie Wood, the wife of new senior pastor Andy Wood. On May 16, the Southern Baptist Convention announced that Saddleback was seeking an appeal to be reinstated in fellowship. In June 2023, when it requested a review of the decision, church representatives present at the annual convention voted 88% to uphold this decision. The church wanted to maintain its affiliation with the California Southern Baptist Convention, but in October 2023, it decided to leave the state convention as well, in a desire to avoid divisions.

According to a church census released in 2023, it claimed a weekly attendance of 30,000 people and 15 campuses in different cities. 

== Beliefs ==
The church has a Baptist confession of faith.

==Programs==
The church offers various programs, such as &quot;The Purpose Driven Church&quot; (PDC) curriculum and &quot;Celebrate Recovery&quot;, an addiction recovery support group program.

<doc id="766021" wikidata="Q350963" url="?curid=766021" title="Adam Stefan Sapieha">
<text>Prince Adam Stefan Stanisław Bonifacy Józef Sapieha (; 14 May 1867 – 23 July 1951) was a Polish Catholic prelate who served as Archbishop of Kraków from 1911 to 1951. A member of the Polish nobility, between 1922 and 1923 he was a senator of the Second Polish Republic. In 1946, Pope Pius XII made him a cardinal.

==Early life==
Sapieha was born in 1867 in the castle of Krasiczyn, then part of the Austrian Empire. His family, originally from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, were members of the Polish nobility. He was the youngest of the seven children of Prince Adam Stanisław Sapieha-Kodenski and Princess Jadwiga Klementyna Sanguszko-Lubartowicza, daughter of Prince Władysław Hieronim Sanguszko. His elder brother, Prince Władysław Leon Sapieha, is the great-grandfather of Queen Mathilde of the Belgians.

==Education and early vocation==
After graduating from gymnasium in Lwów in 1886, he enrolled in the Law Department at the University of Vienna, starting simultaneously law studies at Institut Catholique in Lille. In 1887 on the basis of his certificate from the University of Vienna Sapieha continued studies at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków. After two years he passed the examination and returned to Vienna for further studies, where he remained until 1890, obtaining the certificate of completion.

In the same year he began theological studies at the University of Innsbruck, and in 1892 signed up for the third year of the Major Roman Catholic Theological Seminary in Lviv. He was then educated at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, where he was also ordained as priest of Lviv (Lwów, Lemberg) on 1 October 1893 by Bishop Jan Puzyna de Kosielsko (later Bishop of Kraków and Cardinal). Father Sapieha was despatched first to Jazłowiec (college) to act as chaplain to the school and to the attached convent in Yazlovets in the Archdiocese of Lwów, before, in October 1895, he started further studies in Rome. There he obtained a doctorate of civil and canon law at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy. At the same time he studied diplomacy at the Pontifical Academy of Ecclesiastical Nobles.

After returning to the home country in 1897, he was designated vice-rector of the diocesan seminary in Lviv and eventually became its rector. He resigned because he was discouraged by the imposed rules of education of young priests. After a half-year trip across the United States of America, he was designated a vicar of the St. Nicholas congregation in Lviv in October 1902. In 1905 Sapieha was appointed a papal chamberlain, and sent to Rome where he was a consultant on matters concerning the Roman Catholic Church in Poland, in the annexed territories, the realization of an idea by Lviv Armenian Catholic Archbishop Józef Teodorowicz (who was the Sapieha&#x27;s long-term friend) to have a representative of the Roman Catholic Church in Poland at the Roman Curia.

==Bishop==
Sapieha was appointed Bishop of Kraków on 24 November 1911 and was consecrated by Pope Pius X in the Sistine Chapel on 7 December of the same year. In 1915, he established a relief committee for victims of World War I.

After World War I, Sapieha became a vocal opponent of the new concordat negotiated between the Holy See and the newly resurrected Polish state. He argued that the Polish Church should be completely independent of the state and that its primate should be the Archbishop of Warsaw. This attitude led to a conflict with Archbishop Achille Ratti, Pope Benedict XV&#x27;s nuncio who later became pope, during the first post-war congress of Polish bishops in Gniezno held 26–30 August 1919. Sapieha thought that the Poles themselves should decide their affairs without outside influence and asked Ratti to leave the conference room. After Ratti became Pope Pius XI in 1922, he did not make Sapieha a cardinal even though his two predecessors as bishop of Krakow had been honored with that title, and not even after Krakow became an archdiocese.

In 1922, Sapieha was elected senator from the Christian Union of National Unity party. He ordered a memorial service and issued a proclamation on the assassination of Gabriel Narutowicz. It was the only speech he delivered as a senator because papal mandate at the time prohibited clergy from holding public office. He resigned on 9 March 1923.

Sapieha was appointed Metropolitan Archbishop in 1925 when the Diocese of Kraków was elevated to the rank of Archdiocese. He received a degree honoris causa from the Jagiellonian University in 1926. In September 1930, after opposition leaders were arrested and placed in confinement at Brest Fortress, Archbishops Sapieha and Teodorowicz strongly criticized the government. Despite this, and other occasional disagreements with the government, Sapieha was awarded the Order of the White Eagle in 1936.

In 1937, Sapieha, who had opposed the Pilsudski regime (sanacja), made the controversial decision to move Piłsudski&#x27;s body, within Wawel&#x27;s Cathedral, from St. Leonard&#x27;s Crypt to the crypt under the Silver Bells.

In 1939 he asked Pope Pius XI to accept his resignation due to age and failing health, but the pope refused. After the death of Pius XI, he repeated his request to the new pope, Pius XII on 19 June 1939. In anticipation of the upcoming war and at Józef Beck&#x27;s instigation he withdrew his resignation.

===Activities during the Second World War===
During World War II, while Primate August Hlond was in France, Sapieha was the de facto head of the Polish church in jurisdictions directly annexed by the Third Reich (primate Hlond was represented by Walenty Dymek, auxiliary bishop of Poznań) and was one of the main leaders of the nation. One of the most important organisations to which he belonged was the National Council of Welfare, created on the model of Caritas. From the war&#x27;s start of the Nazi occupation, he was an independence activist, working with the Polish government-in-exile.

Before the war, Sapieha referred to Jews as a &quot;depraved race&quot; and blamed them for both capitalist exploitation and Communism. He made no condemnation of the Holocaust while it was occurring either publicly or in private communications with the German authorities.

In August 1944, Sapieha was forced to operate the Polish seminary in secret because the Germans began killing seminarians whenever they found them. He moved his students (including the future Pope John Paul II, Karol Wojtyła) into the Bishop&#x27;s Palace in Kraków to finish their training during the Nazi Occupation of Poland.

Sapieha&#x27;s biographer, Jacek Czajkowski describes the circumstances of the archbishop being invited by Governor Hans Frank to Hitler&#x27;s birthday party in April 1942. He told the German official: &quot;No! They are not going to change anything, but they will take a photograph of me and write that a Polish bishop arrived at Hitler&#x27;s birthday party with best wishes. Tell him I will not come.&quot; Another such anecdote recalls when governor Hans Frank ordered the archbishop to hand him the keys to the Wawel Castle. Sapieha replied: &quot;But don&#x27;t forget to give them back to me when you will be leaving Wawel.&quot;

==Cardinal==
In March 1945, he initiated the publication of Tygodnik Powszechny. He was created Cardinal-Priest, of the title of &quot;Santa Maria Nuova&quot;, on 18 February 1946. On 1 November 1946 he conferred priestly ordination on Karol Wojtyła in the chapel of his episcopal residence. After the Kielce pogrom he demonstrated his anti-Semitic attitudes when he reportedly stated that the Jews had brought it upon themselves but then provided aid for the affected Jews. According to witness, he and the church complained there were too many Jews in the government.

Sapieha knew Karol Wojtyła (later John Paul II) was destined to become a priest when a young Wojtyła delivered a welcoming speech during the archbishop&#x27;s visit to his school. Some people consider him a mentor of Pope John Paul II. In 1949, he proposed that Stefan Wyszyński, Metropolitan Archbishop of Gniezno and Warsaw since 12 November 1948, should be termed Primate of Poland.

The following year (1950), he wrote letters to the then Polish president, Boleslaw Bierut, protesting against Bierut&#x27;s repression of the church. Sapieha died on 23 July 1951, and his funeral on 28 July turned into a political demonstration. He was buried in Wawel Cathedral, in the crypt under the confessional of St. Stanislas.

==Portrayal==

In the 2005 CBS miniseries &quot;Pope John Paul II&quot;, Archbishop Sapieha was portrayed by American actor James Cromwell.

<text>John French Sloan (August 2, 1871 – September 7, 1951) was an American painter and etcher. He is considered to be one of the founders of the Ashcan school of American art. He was also a member of the group known as The Eight. He is best known for his urban genre scenes and ability to capture the essence of neighborhood life in New York City, often observed through his Chelsea studio window. Sloan has been called the premier artist of the Ashcan School, and also a realist painter who embraced the principles of Socialism, though he himself disassociated his art from his politics.

==Biography==
John Sloan was born in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, on August 2, 1871, to James Dixon Sloan, a man with artistic leanings who made an unsteady income in a succession of jobs, and Henrietta Ireland Sloan, a schoolteacher from an affluent family. Sloan grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he lived and worked until 1904, when he moved to New York City. He and his two sisters (Elizabeth and Marianna) were encouraged to draw and paint from an early age. In the fall of 1884 he enrolled at the prestigious Central High School in Philadelphia, where his classmates included William Glackens and Albert C. Barnes.

In the spring of 1888, his father experienced a mental breakdown that left him unable to work, and Sloan became responsible, at the age of sixteen, for the support of his parents and sisters. He dropped out of school in order to work full-time as an assistant cashier at Porter and Coates, a bookstore and seller of fine prints. His duties were light, allowing him many hours to read the books and examine the works in the store&#x27;s print department. It was there that Sloan created his earliest surviving works, among which are pen-and-ink copies after Dürer and Rembrandt. He also began making etchings, which were sold in the store for a modest sum. In 1890, the offer of a higher salary persuaded Sloan to leave his position to work for A. Edward Newton, a former clerk for Porter and Coates who had opened his own stationery store. At Newton&#x27;s, Sloan designed greeting cards and calendars and continued to work on his etchings. In that same year he also attended a night drawing class at the Spring Garden Institute, which provided him his first formal art training.

He soon left Newton&#x27;s business in quest of greater freedom as a freelance commercial artist in 1891, but this venture produced little income. In 1892, he began working as an illustrator in the art department of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;. Later that same year, Sloan began taking evening classes at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts under the guidance of the realist Thomas Anshutz. Among his fellow students was his old schoolmate William Glackens.

In 1892, Sloan met Robert Henri, a talented painter and charismatic advocate of artistic independence who became his mentor and closest friend. Henri encouraged Sloan in his graphic work and eventually convinced him to turn to painting. They shared a common artistic outlook and in the coming years promoted a new form of realism, known as the &quot;Ashcan school&quot; of American art. In 1893, Sloan and Henri founded the short-lived Charcoal Club together, whose members would also include Glackens, George Luks, and Everett Shinn.

Towards the end of 1895, Sloan decided to leave &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; to work in the art department of &quot;The Philadelphia Press&quot;. His schedule was now less rigid, allowing him more time to paint. Henri offered encouragement and often sent Sloan reproductions of European artists, such as Manet, Hals, Goya and Velázquez.

In 1898, the socially awkward Sloan was introduced to Anna Maria (Dolly) Wall (born July 28, 1876), and the two fell immediately in love. In entering into a relationship with her, Sloan accepted the challenges posed by her alcoholism and her sexual history, which included prostitution; although Dolly worked in a department store by day, Sloan had, in fact, met her in a brothel. They were married on August 5, 1901, providing Sloan with an affectionate partner who believed in him absolutely, but whose lapses and mental instability led to frequent crises. A particularly close friend in their New York years, who helped the couple to weather many of these crises, was the artist John Butler Yeats, the elderly father of poet William Butler Yeats.
By 1903, Sloan had produced almost sixty oil paintings but had yet to establish a name for himself in the art world. In April 1904, he and Dolly moved to New York City and found quarters in Greenwich Village where he painted some of his best-known works, including &quot;McSorley&#x27;s Bar&quot;, &quot;Sixth Avenue Elevated at Third Street&quot;, and &quot;Wake of the Ferry&quot;. He became increasingly prolific, but he sold little, and he continued to rely on his earnings as a freelancer for &quot;The Philadelphia Press&quot;, for which he continued to draw weekly puzzles until 1910. By 1905, he was supplementing this income by drawing illustrations for books (including Wilkie Collins&#x27; &quot;The Moonstone&quot;) and for such journals as &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, and &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot;. Sloan participated in the landmark 1908 exhibition at the Macbeth Galleries of a group that included four other artists from the Philadelphia Charcoal Club (Henri, Glackens, Luks and Shinn) as well as three artists who worked in a less realistic, more impressionistic style, Maurice Prendergast, Ernest Lawson, and Arthur B. Davies. The group was afterward collectively known as &quot;The Eight.&quot; The Macbeth Galleries exhibition was intended as a rebuke to the restrictive exhibition practices of the powerful, conservative National Academy of Design. Sloan organized a touring exhibition of the paintings from that show that traveled to several cities from Newark to Chicago and elicited considerable discussion in the press about less academic approaches to art and new definitions of acceptable subject matter.

A doctor who was consulted in an effort to help Dolly overcome her drinking problem suggested a scheme to Sloan: he was to start a diary in which he would include his fondest thoughts of her, with the expectation that she would surreptitiously read it and be freed of her disabling fear that Sloan would leave her. Spanning the period from 1906 to early 1913, the diary soon grew beyond its initial purpose, and its publication in 1965 supplied researchers with a detailed chronicle of Sloan&#x27;s activities and interests and a portrait of the pre-war art world.
Sloan&#x27;s growing discontent with what he called &quot;the Plutocracy&#x27;s government&quot; led him to join the Socialist Party in 1910. Dolly Sloan also became active in Socialist projects at this time. John Sloan became the art editor of &quot;The Masses&quot; with the December 1912 issue and contributed powerful anti-war and anti-capitalist drawings to other socialist publications as well, such as the &quot;Call&quot; and &quot;Coming Nation&quot;. As Sloan was never entirely comfortable with propaganda, his work for these magazines did not always contain overt political content. His belief that &quot;The Masses&quot; was becoming too doctrinaire led to a dispute with fellow editors Max Eastman and Floyd Dell, causing him to resign his position with that journal in 1916. He was never an ally of the Communist Party in the United States, although he remained hopeful that the Soviet Union would succeed in creating an egalitarian society. Throughout his life, he identified with left-wing political causes and expressed vehement disapproval of the inequities of the American economic system. A pacifist, he also opposed the American entry into World War I.

In 1913, Sloan painted a two-hundred-foot backdrop for the &quot;Paterson Strike Pageant&quot;, a controversial work of performance art and radical politics organized by activist John Reed and philanthropist Mabel Dodge. The play, a benefit staged for the striking silk mill workers of Paterson, New Jersey, took place in Madison Square Garden and incorporated over 1,000 participants. Sloan has been called &quot;the premier artist of the Ashcan School who painted the inexhaustible energy and life of New York City during the first decades of the twentieth century&quot;.

Also in 1913, Sloan participated in the legendary Armory Show. He served as a member of the organizing committee and also exhibited two paintings and five etchings. In that same year, the important collector Albert C. Barnes purchased one of Sloan&#x27;s paintings; this was only the fourth sale of a painting for Sloan (although it has often erroneously been counted as his first). For Sloan, exposure to the European modernist works on view in the Armory Show initiated a gradual move away from the realist urban themes he had been painting for the previous ten years. In 1914–15, during summers spent in Gloucester, Massachusetts, he painted landscapes en plein air in a new, more fluid and colorful style influenced by Van Gogh and the Fauves.
Beginning in 1914, Sloan taught at the Art Students League, where for the next eighteen years he became a charismatic if eccentric teacher. Sloan also taught briefly at the George Luks Art School. His students respected him for his practical knowledge and integrity, but feared his caustic tongue; as a well-known painter who had nonetheless sold very few paintings, he advised his students, &quot;I have nothing to teach you that will help you to make a living.&quot; He disdained careerism among artists and urged his pupils to find joy in the creative process alone.

The summer of 1918 was the last he spent in Gloucester. For the next thirty years, he spent four months each summer in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where the desert landscape inspired a new concentration on the rendering of form. Still, the majority of his works were completed in New York. As a result of his time in the Southwest, he and Dolly developed a strong interest in Native American arts and ceremonies and, back in New York, became advocates of Indian artists. In 1922 he organized an exhibition of work by Native American artists at the Society of Independent Artists in New York. He also championed the work of Diego Rivera, whom he called &quot;the one artist on this continent who is in the class of the old masters.&quot; The Society of Independent Artists, which Sloan had co-founded in 1916, gave Rivera and José Clemente Orozco their first showing in the United States in 1920.

In 1943, Dolly Sloan died of coronary heart disease. The next year, Sloan married Helen Farr, a former student forty years his junior with whom he had been romantically involved for a time in the 1930s. On September 7, 1951, Sloan died of cancer while vacationing in Hanover, New Hampshire. The following January the Whitney Museum of American Art presented a well-received retrospective of his career. Helen Farr Sloan, who became a noted philanthropist in her later years, oversaw the distribution of his unsold works to major museums throughout the country.

==Career==
===Training===
Sloan&#x27;s training consisted of his study and reproduction of works by painters such as Rembrandt, a few classes at various institutions, mentorship by Robert Henri, and his work experience as an etcher and draughtsman. The high school that Sloan attended had a good art department, but it is not known whether he gained any training there. Sloan worked several jobs in draughtsmanship, etching, and commercial artwork before he attended the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where he studied briefly under Thomas Anshutz. The experience Sloan gathered from his various press jobs provided him with a certain amount of knowledge and allowed room for him to explore and expand in his free time. Henri&#x27;s mentorship was significant in Sloan&#x27;s training because he encouraged him to paint more, and introduced him to the work of various artists, whose techniques, composition, and style Sloan studied. He sought additional guidance from Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;The Elements of Drawing&quot; and John Collier&#x27;s &quot;A Manual of Oil Painting&quot;. Sloan believed his study and mentorship at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, as well as his early Philadelphia experiences, to be his &quot;college education.&quot;

===Early influences===
At a young age, Sloan had been exposed to numerous books and reproductions through his uncle, Alexander Priestley, who held an extensive collection in his library. One major influence that he discovered was John Leech, an English caricaturist. When Sloan entered his position at &quot;The Philadelphia Press&quot; his newspaper drawings reflected the style of Leech, Charles Keene and George du Maurier. But by 1894 he had begun attracting attention with decorative illustrations in a new style related to the poster movement; these works combine the influences of European artists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, including Walter Crane, and reveal Sloan&#x27;s study of Botticelli and Japanese prints.

Sloan&#x27;s early paintings may have been influenced by Thomas Eakins as a result of his time studying under Anshutz. In 1893, Sloan and Glackens became regulars at a weekly &quot;open house&quot; at Henri&#x27;s studio, where he encouraged the young men to read Whitman and Emerson and led discussions of such books as George Moore&#x27;s &quot;Modern Painting&quot; and William Morris Hunt&#x27;s &quot;Talks on Art&quot;. Henri believed in the need to create a new, less genteel American art that spoke more immediately to the spirit of the age, an outlook that found ready adherents in Sloan and Glackens.

==Style and the Ashcan School==

As someone who painted city crowds and tenement rooms, shop girls and streetwalkers, charwomen and hairdressers, Sloan is one of the artists most closely identified with the Ashcan School. Yet it was a term Sloan despised. He came to feel that it homogenized too many different painters, concentrated viewers&#x27; attention on content rather than style, and presupposed a muckraking intent. His wariness was not misplaced: exhibitions of Ashcan art in recent decades often stress its documentary quality and importance as part of an historical record, whereas Sloan felt that any artist worth anything had to be appreciated for his skilled brushwork, color, and composition.

Unlike Henri, Sloan was not a facile painter and labored over his work, leading Henri to remark that &quot;Sloan&quot; was &quot;the past participle of &#x27;slow.&#x27;&quot; (When Glackens and Sloan were at &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, Glackens usually got the reportorial assignments because he was more adept than Sloan in making quick sketches.) His methodical approach towards sketching carried over to his painting. &quot;Sloan&#x27;s approach to making urban realist art was based on images seen and remembered (and sometimes written down) rather than sketched in the street, even though his autographic handling of paint and print media conveys the look of a rapid drawing. The effect is conceptual rather than perceptual, which Sloan denigrated as &quot;eyesight painting.&quot; This was a major characteristic of his style, consistent with the Ashcan School&#x27;s goal of presenting a subject to the viewer with all the immediacy of a snapshot.

Sloan tended to observe city dwellers interacting in an intimate setting. A student of his wrote, he &quot;concerned himself with what we call genre: street scenes, restaurant life, paintings of saloons, ferry boats, roof tops, back yards, and so on through a whole catalogue of commonplace subjects.&quot; Like Edward Hopper, Sloan often used the perspective of the window in his painting, in order to gain a tight focus, but also to observe his subject undetected. He wrote in his diary, in 1911; &quot;I am in the habit of &quot;watching every bit&quot; of human life I can see about my windows, but I do it so that I am not observed at it ... No insult to the people you are watching to do so unseen.&quot; Sloan&#x27;s attention to isolated incidents within the urban environment recalls the narrative techniques used in the realist fiction and Hollywood films he enjoyed.

Sloan was described as an &quot;early twentieth-century realist painter who embraced the principles of Socialism and placed his artistic talents at the service of those beliefs.&quot; Yet whenever Sloan was asked about the social context of his paintings or about his fervent Socialism, he said that his paintings were made with &quot;sympathy, but no social consciousness ... I was never interested in putting propaganda into my paintings, so it annoys me when art historians try to interpret my city life pictures as &#x27;socially conscious.&#x27; I saw the everyday life of the people, and on the whole I picked out bits of joy in human life for my subject matter.&quot;

In the late 1920s, just as the market for his city pictures was finally reaching a point at which he might have made a comfortable living, Sloan changed his technique and abandoned his characteristic urban subject matter in favor of nudes and portraits. This independence was entirely typical of him, to the dismay of his dealer, Charles Kraushaar. Rejecting as superficial the spontaneous painterly technique of Manet and Hals—and also of Robert Henri and George Luks—he turned instead to the underpainting and glazing method used by old masters such as Andrea Mantegna. It was an eccentric choice. The resulting paintings, which often made unconventional use of superimposed hatchings to define the forms, have never attained the popularity of his early Ashcan works.

==Legacy==

Sloan&#x27;s paintings are represented in almost all major American museums. Among his best-known works are &quot;Hairdresser&#x27;s Window&quot; (1907) in the collection of the Wadsworth Atheneum, &quot;The Picnic Ground&quot; (1907) in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art, &quot;The Haymarket&quot; (1907) in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum, &quot;Yeats at Petitpas&quot; in the collection of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, &quot;McSorley&#x27;s Bar&quot; (1912) in the collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts, &quot;The &#x27;City&#x27; from Greenwich Village&quot; (1922) in the collection of the National Gallery of Art, and &quot;The White Way&quot; (1927) in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. In 1971, his painting &quot;Wake of the Ferry&quot; (1907) was reproduced on a U.S. postage stamp honoring Sloan.

His students included Peggy Bacon, Aaron Bohrod, Alexander Calder, Reginald Marsh, Xavier J. Barile, Barnett Newman, Minna Citron, and Norman Raeben. In 1939, he published a book of his teachings and aphorisms, &quot;Gist of Art&quot;, which remained in print for over sixty years.

In &quot;American Visions&quot;, the critic Robert Hughes praised Sloan&#x27;s art for &quot;an honest humaneness, a frank sympathy, a refusal to flatten its figures into stereotypes of class misery ... He saw his people as part of larger totality, the carnal and cozy body of the city itself.&quot; In &quot;American Painting from the Armory Show to the Depression&quot;, art historian Milton Brown called Sloan &quot;the outstanding figure of the Ash Can School.&quot; To his friend, the painter John Butler Yeats, and to art critic Henry McBride, he was &quot;an American Hogarth.&quot;

The lobby of the United States Post Office in Bronxville, New York, features a mural by Sloan painted in 1939 and titled &quot;The Arrival of the First Mail in Bronxville in 1846&quot; commissioned by the Treasury Section of Fine Arts. The post office and mural were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

<text>Colonel Jesus Villamor Air Base, known simply as Villamor Air Base , is the headquarters of the Philippine Air Force (PAF) and shares runways with Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA). It was formerly known as [[Nichols Field]] or Nichols Air Base. Chiefly used as a PAF transport/helicopter airbase, the Maharlika Hall located at the base is used by the president of the Philippines when departing for foreign or domestic trips. Also, foreign dignitaries visiting Manila would usually arrive at the air base.

The base is named after Filipino World War II pilot Jesús A. Villamor.

==History==
The air base was built as Nichols Field in 1919 by the United States during the insular government era and in 1941, was used as an airfield by the United States Army Air Forces in the South West Pacific Theatre. The field was the location of the U.S. Far East Air Force&#x27;s U.S. 20th Air Base Group. Also, based at the field was Troop F of the U.S. 26th Cavalry Regiment.

A Fifth Air Force base, Nichols Field was within the territory of Imperial Japan during their occupation of the Philippines from December 1941 to January 1945.

===Nichols Air Base===
Designated Nichols Air Base after Philippine independence, in 1997, the base was reduced to make way for construction of Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 3 and Newport City.

In 2010, the AVSECOM van (called by some as &quot;Ninoy Aquino&#x27;s death van&quot;) which had carried the body of Ninoy Aquino to the hospital after his assassination in 1983 was found rotting inside Nichols Air Base (now called Villamor Airbase). This was reported only two years later by ABS-CBN News. Photos of this &quot;death van&quot; were subsequently posted on the blog site of the Filipino investigative journalist, Raissa Robles, who reported the discovery.

<doc id="766037" wikidata="Q1369267" url="?curid=766037" title="Hiram Bithorn Stadium">
<text>Hiram Bithorn Stadium (Spanish: Estadio Hiram Bithorn) is a baseball park in San Juan, Puerto Rico, built in 1962 and designed by Puerto Rican architect Pedro Miranda. The stadium is home to the Cangrejeros de Santurce of the Puerto Rican Baseball League (LBPRC), and briefly was home to Major League Baseball&#x27;s Montreal Expos during their final years.

It is operated by the municipal government of the city of San Juan. Its name honors the first Puerto Rican to play in the major leagues, Hiram Bithorn, who first played with the Chicago Cubs in 1942. Built in 1962, under the mayoral administration of Felisa Rincón de Gautier as a replacement for Estadio Sixto Escobar, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.

== Dimensions ==
The stadium has approximately 18,000 seats. The stadium is 325 feet (99 m) down the left-field line, 325 feet (99 m) down the right-field line and 404 feet (123 m) to center field. The fences are 8 feet (2.5 m) high. When the Expos played home games at Hiram Bithorn, the field dimensions were set to match Olympic Stadium in Montreal.

== History ==
The Hiram Bithorn Stadium was opened in 1962.

The first outdoor National Basketball Association game was played between the Phoenix Suns and the Milwaukee Bucks on September 24, 1972, during that year&#x27;s preseason. The Suns defeated the Bucks, 116–103.

In the mid-1990s Hiram Bithorn Stadium was planned to be the home of the yet-to-be-named Puerto Rico team, a charter franchise of the United League (UL) which was a planned third league of Major League Baseball (MLB).

The stadium hosted Major League Baseball&#x27;s Opening Day Game in 2001, in which the Toronto Blue Jays faced the Texas Rangers in an American League match-up. However, 4,000 who bought tickets were turned away when the police determined the safe capacity of the park had been vastly exceeded.

It was the object of a major overhaul under the mayoral administration of Jorge Santini, before becoming the part-time home of the Montreal Expos of the National League in 2003 and 2004 before their move to Washington, D.C. as the Washington Nationals. The Expos played 20 &quot;home&quot; games across the two seasons as a result of poor attendance at their home Olympic Stadium in Montreal. Before Major League Baseball&#x27;s announcement of the Montreal Expos&#x27; move to Washington, Puerto Rico and San Juan made an effort to lure the Expos franchise to the island territory permanently.

Hiram Bithorn Stadium hosted parts of the first two rounds of the 2006 World Baseball Classic. Pool C, which included the teams of Puerto Rico, Cuba, Panama, and the Netherlands, was played there. It also hosted Pool 2 of the second round of the Classic which featured Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela, the top two finishers from Pool C and Pool D. Pool D games of the 2009 World Baseball Classic were played there between March 7 and March 11, 2009. The Hiram Bithorn Stadium hosted the 2013 World Baseball Classic with Puerto Rico, Venezuela, the Dominican Republic and newcomers Spain in Pool C.

In 2008, it served as the stadium for Atléticos de San Juan and Academia Quintana, two soccer teams in the Puerto Rico Soccer League, Puerto Rico&#x27;s first-ever professional soccer league.

In 2010, Major League Baseball returned to the stadium, as the Florida Marlins faced the New York Mets in a three-game series during the regular season.

The Marlins were to play the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 30 and 31, 2016 in honor of Roberto Clemente Day. However, on May 6, 2016, it was announced that the Puerto Rico games would be postponed due to the Zika virus outbreak, and moved to Marlins Park.

The Cleveland Indians and Minnesota Twins played a two-game series at Hiram Bithorn Stadium on April 17 and 18, 2018. It is the first time since 2010 that a Major League Baseball regular-season game was played in Puerto Rico. Furthermore, the league announced in August 2019 that they would be returning for a three-game series in April 2020 between the Miami Marlins and New York Mets. This series was later cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

There have been, as of June 2020, 71 professional boxing events that have been held at the stadium, including many world championship fights. Two-time World Lightweight Champion Carlos Ortíz won four Lightweight title bouts in the stadium, regaining his championship from Ismael Laguna in 1965 and retaining it against Doug Valiant in 1963, Kenny Lane in 1964, and Sugar Ramos in 1967. Also, former world heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson fought there late in his career.

== Other uses ==
Along with sporting events, the stadium has hosted concerts by many famous artists.

Metallica were scheduled to perform during their Nowhere Else to Roam Tour on April 28, 1993, but it was rained out and never rescheduled.

Shakira has performed twice, during her Tour Anfibio, on April 9, 2000, and during the Tour of the Mongoose, on March 22, 2003.

On March 10, 11, and 12 of 2023, the Colombian singer Karol G performed three special shows at the stadium, in support of her 2023 album &quot;Mañana Será Bonito&quot;. Special guests included Bad Gyal, Feid, Maldy, Romeo Santos, and Sean Paul.

<text>Ashton P. Stevens (August 11, 1872 – July 12, 1951) was an American journalist regarded as the dean of American drama critics. His newspaper column appeared in &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; and later in the &quot;Chicago Herald-American&quot;. He was a theater critic for the Hearst Newspapers for 50 years, 40 of them in Chicago.

==Life and career==

Ashton Stevens was born in San Francisco, California, the son of Hannah L. and James W. Stevens. He was the brother of actor John Landers Stevens and uncle of Jack Landers Stevens and George Stevens, director of such films as &quot;Shane&quot;, &quot;Giant&quot; and &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;. He was the great-granduncle of producer-director Michael Stevens and granduncle of producer George Stevens, Jr.

Stevens began his journalism career in 1894 in San Francisco, as theatre reporter for the &quot;San Francisco News Letter&quot;. He started working for William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; in 1897, and went to work at the &quot;New York Evening Journal&quot; in 1907. In 1910 he moved to Chicago as drama critic for &quot;The Chicago Examiner&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Herald-American&quot;.

Stevens was regarded the dean of American play reviewers and drama critics, and was friend and confidante of many prominent playwrights and stage performers. Known for his sharp wit and fair criticism, he once wrote that &quot;critics should write about plays and playwrights as they would about the weather, with hardly any regard for the weather&#x27;s feelings.&quot;

An expert banjo player, Stevens defended its integrity as an instrument and wrote the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; article on the subject. In 1923 his book &quot;Actorviews: Intimate Portraits&quot;, a collection of his feature interviews illustrated by Gene Markey, was published by Covici-McGee. Stevens wrote a number of plays, including &quot;Prospect Avenue&quot; and, with Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s ghostwriter Charles Michaelson, a comedy titled &quot;Mary&#x27;s Way Out&quot;.

One of Stevens&#x27;s close friends in Chicago was Dr. Maurice Bernstein, guardian of Orson Welles. Welles told filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich that the character of Jedediah Leland, played by Joseph Cotten in his 1941 film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, was modeled on Ashton Stevens:

Jed was really based on a close childhood friend of mine — George Stevens&#x27; uncle Ashton Stevens. He was practically my uncle, too. … I sent him the script before we began, of course, and while he was visiting me on the Coast, I brought him to the set during shooting. Later he saw the movie and thought the old man would be thrilled by it. As it turned out, after &quot;Kane&quot; was released, Ashton was forbidden by his Hearst editors to even mention my name. … Ashton was really one of the great ones. The last of the dandies — he worked for Hearst for some 50 years or so, and adored him. A gentleman … very much like Jed.

Stevens&#x27;s first wife, Aleece Uhlorn, was a daughter of a San Francisco banker and the sister of novelist Gertrude Atherton. They were married in 1900; she died in 1926. The following year Stevens married actress Florence Katherine Krug, known thereafter as Kay Ashton-Stevens.

Stevens was in poor health in his later years, but continued to write regularly for &quot;The Herald-American&quot;. He died of a heart attack at his home in Chicago July 11, 1951. His papers were bequeathed to the Newberry Library in Chicago.

<text>Ernest Milmore Stires (May 20, 1866 - February 12, 1951) was the third Bishop of Long Island in the Episcopal Church from 1925 to 1942.

==Early life and education==
Stires was born in Norfolk, Virginia on May 20, 1866, son of Van Rensselaer West Stires and Lettie M. Milmore. He was a graduate of the Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia, Virginia Theological Seminary, and the University of Virginia where he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi and the Virginia Glee Club. Stires later served as Phi Kappa Psi&#x27;s seventh national President. He graduated with a Bachelor of Letters from the University of Virginia in 1888. He was awarded a Doctor of Divinity from Virginia Theological Seminary in 1901, Doctor of Humane Letters from Kenyon College in 1903, Doctor of Laws from New York University, Doctor of Civil Law from University of King&#x27;s College and Doctor of Sacred Theology from Columbia University, all in 1926.

==Ordained ministry==
He was ordained deacon on June 26, 1891 by the Bishop of Virginia Francis McNeece Whittle, and then served as rector of St John&#x27;s Church in West Point, Virginia. He was ordained priest on June 24, 1892 by the Bishop of Southern Virginia Alfred Magill Randolph, and briefly served in the Church of the Good Shepherd in Augusta, Georgia before moving to Chicago to serve as curate and then rector of Grace Church in 1893. On November 1, 1901, he became rector of St Thomas&#x27;s Church in New York City where he served until 1925 with a brief absence for when he served in France in the First World War. He served as deputy to the General Convention from 1910 to 1925 and was a member of National Council.

==Episcopacy==
Stires was elected Coadjutor Bishop of Long Island in May 1925. However, by the time of his consecration, the incumbent diocesan bishop, Frederick Burgess, had died, and hence Stires was consecrated as the third Bishop of Long Island on November 24, 1925 by Presiding Bishop Ethelbert Talbot.

<doc id="766048" wikidata="Q233832" url="?curid=766048" title="Jo Van Fleet">
<text>Jo Van Fleet (December 29, 1915 – June 10, 1996) was an American stage, film, and television actress. During her long career, which spanned over four decades, she often played characters much older than her actual age. Van Fleet won a Tony Award in 1954 for her performance in the Broadway production &quot;The Trip to Bountiful&quot;, and the next year she won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in &quot;East of Eden&quot;.

==Early life and training==
Josephine Kay Van Fleet/Catherin J VanFleet was born in 1915 in Oakland, California, the younger of two daughters of Michigan native Roy H. Van Fleet and Indiana native Elizabeth &quot;Bessie&quot; Catherine (née Gardner). Her father Roy worked for the railroads, but died in 1919 of a streptococcus throat infection which was lanced, inadvertently spreading the disease throughout his body. Federal census records show that by age five Josephine, her 18-year-old sister Corinne, and their widowed mother were living in Oakland with Bessie&#x27;s parents, Ralph and Mary Gardner. To help support herself and her two daughters at her parents&#x27; home, Bessie worked as a &quot;sales lady&quot; in an Oakland dry goods store. 

While she had an early interest in stage productions, &quot;Jo&quot; graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1936, focusing on a variety of subjects, and then spent several years as a high school teacher in Morro Bay, California. She continued her theatrical training in a graduate program at the College of the Pacific in Stockton, California. She moved after her graduation from her masters program to New York City, where she continued her training with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse.

==Career==
In 1944, Van Fleet began her professional stage career and immediately distinguished herself in the role of Miss Phipps in the production of &quot;Uncle Harry&quot; at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C. Two years later, in New York, she distinguished herself as well on Broadway by her performances as Dorcas in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;; and yet again, in 1950, as Regan opposite Louis Calhern in &quot;King Lear&quot;. She won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play in 1954 for her portrayal of Jessie Mae Watts in Horton Foote&#x27;s &quot;The Trip to Bountiful&quot;, costarring Lillian Gish and Eva Marie Saint.
Despite her early successes on the stage, Van Fleet continued to refine her skills in the late 1940s and early 1950s by studying with Elia Kazan and Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio in New York. Kazan in 1952 directed her in the play &quot;Flight to Egypt&quot; and the following year in &quot;Camino Real&quot;. In 1954 he encouraged her to work in films in Hollywood. There Kazan cast her in his screen adaptation of John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;East of Eden&quot; (1955) for Warner Bros. In that production—her film debut—Van Fleet portrays Cathy Ames, the mother of James Dean&#x27;s character. Her performance, which was widely praised by critics, won her an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her subsequent film work was steady through 1960 and included films such as &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; (1955), &quot;I&#x27;ll Cry Tomorrow&quot; (1955), &quot;The King and Four Queens&quot; (1956), and &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral&quot; (1957). Her career, however, did not progress as she had hoped. Her friend and mentor, Kazan, personally experienced her frustrations: &quot;&#x27;Jo stagnated, and, since she knew it, was bitter. And as she became bitter, she became more difficult.&#x27;&quot; In an interview for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; after her Oscar-winning performance in &quot;East of Eden&quot;, Van Fleet openly expressed her concerns &quot;about being typecast in tragic roles&quot;.
In 1958, Van Fleet was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for her performance in &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot;, in which she played the acquisitive mother of Anthony Perkins&#x27; character. Her later films included &quot;Wild River&quot; (1960), one of the productions in which she played a character far older than her actual age. Only age 44 at the time of &quot;Wild River&quot;, Van Fleet spent five hours every morning getting into make-up for her role as Ella, the 89-year-old matriarch of the Garth family. Some of her other notable roles include the Wicked Stepmother in &quot;Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s Cinderella&quot; (1965), Paul Newman&#x27;s mother in &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; (1967), and Peter Sellers&#x27;s mother in &quot;I Love You, Alice B. Toklas&quot; (1968).

Van Fleet&#x27;s work on television included such series as &quot;Naked City&quot;, &quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, and &quot;Police Woman&quot;. Among her most emotionally charged dramatic performances on television is her portrayal of the bitter, explosive Mrs. Shrike in the 1956 episode &quot;Shopping for Death&quot; on &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;.

Van Fleet&#x27;s final performance, a brief but &quot;delicious&quot; supporting turn in the 1986 TV adaptation of Saul Bellow&#x27;s &quot;Seize the Day&quot;, elicited this comment from &quot;Washington Post&quot; critic Tom Shales:
Jo Van Fleet, who seems even to walk and blink legendarily, has a tiny part and only two small scenes as Mrs. Einhorn, an old woman with two incontinent dachshunds, but what a piquant impression she makes.

==Personal life and death==
In 1946, Van Fleet married William G. Bales, whose career in modern dance included work as a performer, choreographer, professor at Bennington College, and the founding Dean of Dance at the State University of New York at Purchase, N. Y. They remained together until his death in 1990. The couple had one child, Michael Bales. 

In February 1960, in recognition of her career in the motion-picture industry, as well as her work on stage and in television, Van Fleet was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It is located at 7010 Hollywood Boulevard. Politically, she was a Democrat, and in the 1952 United States presidential election she supported Adlai Stevenson.

Van Fleet died at age 80 from undisclosed causes in New York City at Jamaica Hospital in Queens. Her body was cremated and her ashes were returned to her family.

<text>A [[story structure]], narrative structure, or dramatic structure (also known as a dramaturgical structure) is the structure of a dramatic work such as a book, play, or film. There are different kinds of narrative structures worldwide, which have been hypothesized by critics, writers, and scholars over time. This article covers the range of dramatic structures from around the world: how the acts are structured and what the center of the story is supposed to be about widely varies by region and time period.

== Africa and African diaspora ==
=== Caribbean ===
==== Kwik Kwak ====
The Kwik Kwak (also called as crick crack) structure involves three elements: the narrator, the protagonist, and the audience. The story itself is considered a performance so there is a synergy among the aforementioned elements. In the story, the narrator may draw attention to the narrative or to himself as storyteller. The structure often includes the following:
#Tell riddles to test the audience.
#Audience becomes a chorus and comments on the story.

Usually there is a ritual ending.

=== West Africa ===
==== Griot ====
A story structure commonly found in West Africa told by Griot storytellers, who tell their stories orally. Famous stories from this tradition include Anansi folktales. This storytelling type had influence on later African American, Creole, and Caribbean African diaspora stories.

The story structure is as follows:

# Opening formula-includes jokes and riddles to engage audience participation. Then a solemn beginning.
# The body/expository section - narration of the tale, setting up the characters and the events, defining the conflict, with storyteller singing, dancing, shouting and inviting the audience to join. The storyteller uses a language full of images and symbolism.
# The conclusive formula - closure of the story and the moral.

The central driver of the story is memory. The griot or the storyteller relies on collective knowledge and can perform several functions such as educator, counselor, negotiator, entertainer and custodian of the collective memory.

== Indigenous peoples of North America and Latin America ==
=== Central America ===
==== Robleto ====
Robleto is a story form that originates from Nicaragua. It’s named after Robert Robleto, though the structure is much older than him and discovered by Cheryl Diermyer, an outsider, in 2010.
It is made of: 
#Line of Repetition
#Introduction
#Climax
#Journeys
#Close

=== South America ===
==== Harawi ====
Harawi is an ancient traditional genre of Andean music and also indigenous lyric poetry. Harawi was widespread in the Inca Empire and now is especially common in countries that were part of it, mainly: Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. Typically, harawi is a moody, soulful, slow and melodic song or tune played on the quena (flute). The words of harawi speak of love (often unrequited), the plight of ordinary peasants, privations of orphans, etc. Melodies are mainly in minor pentatonic scale.

== Asia ==
=== East Asia ===

==== Dream diary (Japan) ====
Dream diaries (夢記 ゆめのき) is separate from the Dream record and was started by Buddhist monks in 13th-century Japan, who recorded their dreams in diaries. These dreams were often recorded, shared and viewed.

==== Dream record ====
This is a story type that starts with a dream. It was invented in the Ming Dynasty and exported to Korea. The structure deals mainly with a character either reflecting on their life or telling another dead character about their life. It often reflects regret from the characters about their life choices and helps them to either move on or accept their reality. It was never imported into Japan because Japan had an anti-Chinese sentiment in the Tokugawa era starting in the 1600s and the collapse of the Ming empire was in 1618.

==== East Asian 4-act ====
This dramatic structure started out as a Chinese poetry style called qǐ chéng zhuǎn hé (起承转合) and then was exported to Korea as gi seung jeon gyeol (Hangul: 기승전결; Hanja: 起承轉結) and Japan as kishōtenketsu (起承転結). Each country has adapted their own take on the original structure.

==== Eight-legged essay ====

The eight-legged essay () was a style of essay in imperial examinations during the Ming and Qing dynasties in China. The eight-legged essay was needed for those test takers in these civil service tests to show their merits for government service, often focusing on Confucian thought and knowledge of the Four Books and Five Classics, in relation to governmental ideals. Test takers could not write in innovative or creative ways, but needed to conform to the standards of the eight-legged essay. Various skills were examined, including the ability to write coherently and to display basic logic. In certain times, the candidates were expected to spontaneously compose poetry upon a set theme, whose value was also sometimes questioned, or eliminated as part of the test material. This was a major argument in favor of the eight-legged essay, arguing that it were better to eliminate creative art in favor of prosaic literacy. In the history of Chinese literature, the eight-legged essay is often said to have caused China&#x27;s &quot;cultural stagnation and economic backwardness&quot; in the 19th century.

==== Jo-ha-kyū ====
 is a concept of modulation and movement applied in a wide variety of traditional Japanese arts. Roughly translated to &quot;beginning, break, rapid&quot;, it essentially means that all actions or efforts should begin slowly, speed up, and then end swiftly. This concept is applied to elements of the Japanese tea ceremony, to kendō and other martial arts, to dramatic structure in the traditional theatre, and to the traditional collaborative linked verse forms renga and renku (haikai no renga).

The concept originated in &quot;gagaku&quot; court music, specifically in the ways in which elements of the music could be distinguished and described. Though eventually incorporated into a number of disciplines, it was most famously adapted, and thoroughly analysed and discussed by the great Noh playwright Zeami, who viewed it as a universal concept applying to the patterns of movement of all things.

=== West Asia ===
==== Chiastic structure ====

A kind of structure found in the Torah, Bible and Quran using a form of repetition.

==== Hakawati ====
A Palestinian form of literature which includes 1001 Arabian Nights. This structure also includes are many religious works, including the Torah, Bible, and Quran.

==== Karagöz ====
Karagöz (literally &quot;Blackeye&quot; in Turkish) and Hacivat (shortened in time from &quot;Hacı İvaz&quot; meaning &quot;İvaz the Pilgrim&quot;, and also sometimes written as Hacivad) are the lead characters of the traditional Turkish shadow play, popularized during the Ottoman period and then spread to most nation states of the Ottoman Empire. It is most prominent in Turkey, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Adjara (autonomous republic of Georgia). In Greece, Karagöz is known by his local name Karagiozis; in Bosnia and Herzegovina, he is known by his local name Karađoz.

Karagöz plays are structured in four parts:
* &quot;Mukaddime&quot;: Introduction. Hacivat sings a &quot;semai&quot; (different at each performance), recites a prayer, and indicates that he is looking for his friend Karagöz, whom he beckons to the scene with a speech that always ends &quot;Yar bana bir eğlence&quot; (&quot;Oh, for some amusement&quot;). Karagöz enters from the opposite side.
* &quot;Muhavere:&quot; dialogue between Karagöz and Hacivat
* &quot;Fasil:&quot; main plot
* &quot;Bitiş:&quot; Conclusion, always a short argument between Karagöz and Hacivat, always ending with Hacivat yelling at Karagöz that he has &quot;ruined&quot; whatever matter was at hand and has &quot;brought the curtain down,&quot; and Karagöz replying &quot;May my transgressions be forgiven.&quot;
==== Ta&#x27;zieh ====

Ta&#x27;zieh or Ta&#x27;zïye or Ta&#x27;zīya or Tazīa or Ta&#x27;ziyeh (, , ) means comfort, condolence or expression of grief. It comes from roots &quot;aza&quot; (عزو and عزى) which means mourning.

Depending on the region, time, occasion, religion, etc. the word can signify different cultural meanings and practices:
*In Persian cultural reference it is categorized as Condolence Theatre or Passion Play inspired by a historical and religious event, the tragic death of Hussein, symbolizing epic spirit and resistance.
*In South Asia and in the Caribbean it refers specifically to the Miniature Mausoleums (imitations of the mausolems of Karbala, generally made of coloured paper and bamboo) used in ritual processions held in the month of Muharram.
Ta&#x27;zieh, primarily known from the Persian tradition, is a shi&#x27;ite Muslim ritual that reenacts the death of Hussein (the Islamic prophet Muhammad&#x27;s grandson) and his male children and companions in a brutal massacre on the plains of Karbala, Iraq in the year 680 AD. His death was the result of a power struggle in the decision of control of the Muslim community (called the caliph) after the death of Muhammad.

== Europe and the European diaspora ==
=== Aristotle&#x27;s analysis ===
Many scholars have analyzed dramatic structure, beginning with Aristotle in his &quot;Poetics&quot; (c. 335 BCE).

In his &quot;Poetics&quot;, a theory about tragedies, the Greek philosopher Aristotle put forth the idea the play should imitate a single whole action and does not skip around (such as flashbacks). &quot;A whole is what has a beginning and middle and end. A beginning is that which is not a necessary consequent of anything else but after which something else exists or happens as a natural result. An end on the contrary is that which is inevitably or, as a rule, the natural result of something else but from which nothing else follows; a middle follows something else and something follows from it. Well constructed plots must not therefore begin and end at random, but must embody the formulae we have stated.&quot; (1450b27). He split the play into two acts: δέσις (desis) and λύσις (lysis) which roughly translates to binding and unbinding, though contemporary translation is &quot;complication&quot; and &quot;dénouement&quot;. He mainly used Sophocles to make his argument about the proper dramatic structure of a play.

He argues that for a proper tragedy the plot should be simple: a man moving from prosperity to tragedy and not the reverse. It should excite pity or fear, to shock the viewer. He also states that the man needs to be well-known to the audience. The tragedy should come about because of a flaw in the character.

Aristotle ranks the elements of a tragedy, in order of importance, as follows: Plot, Character, Events (or &quot;Reason&quot;: the rationale for the actions that occur), Diction, Music, and Spectacle. And that all plays should be able to be performed from memory, long and easy to understand. He was against character-centric plots stating “The Unity of a Plot does not consist, as some suppose, in its having one man as its subject.” He was against episodic plots. He held that discovery should be the high point of the play and that the action should teach a moral that is reinforced by pity, fear and suffering. The spectacle, not the characters themselves would give rise to the emotions. The stage should also be split into “Prologue, Episode, Exode, and a choral portion, distinguished into Parode and Stasimon...“

Unlike later, he held that the morality was the center of the play and what made it great. Unlike popular belief, he did not come up with the three act structure popularly known.

=== One-Act Play ===

Said to be innovated by Euripides for his play Cyclops, it wasn&#x27;t wildly popular until the late 19th century with the rise of film. Alice Guy-Blaché made a comment about it in the documentary &quot;Be Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blaché&quot;, where she commented that many of the films of the time required a quick punchline at the end.

It is still used today, but fell out of popular favor for films around the late 1930s to 1940s, when the runtime for an average film became longer. (See Kenneth Rowe and Lajos Egri.)

=== Horace&#x27;s analysis ===
The Roman drama critic Horace advocated a 5-act structure in his &quot;Ars Poetica&quot;: &quot;Neue minor neu sit quinto productior actu fabula&quot; (lines 189–190) (&quot;A play should not be shorter or longer than five acts&quot;). He also argued for a Chorus, &quot;The Chorus should play an actor’s part, energetically,&quot; and the center of the play should be morality as Aristotle did.

 &quot;It should favour the good, and give friendly advice,
 Guide those who are angered, encourage those fearful
 Of sinning: praise the humble table&#x27;s food, sound laws
 And justice, and peace with her wide-open gates:
 It should hide secrets, and pray and entreat the gods
 That the proud lose their luck, and the wretched regain it.&quot;

He did not specify the contents of the acts.

=== Aelius Donatus ===
The fourth-century Roman grammarian Aelius Donatus in his criticism of Terence&#x27;s plays Adelphoe and Hecyra in the book Aeli Donati qvod fertvr Commentvm Terenti: Accendvnt Evgravphi Volume 2 and in his review of Terence&#x27;s Play Andria in P. Terentii Afri comoediae sex used the terms prologue (prologus), protasis, epitasis and catastropha. He often uses the original Greek letters, but does not define these as specific acts, but as parts of the play as having different emotional qualities.

For example for Terence&#x27;s play Adelphoe he comments, &quot;in hac prologus aliquanto lenior inducitur; magis etiam in se purgando quam in aduersariis laedendis est occupatus. πρότασις turbulenta est, ἐπίτασις clamosa, καταστροφή lenior. quarum partium rationem diligentius in principio proposuimus, cum de comoedia quaedam diceremus.&quot; which roughly translates to, &quot;In this the prologue is somewhat milder; he is more engaged in clearing himself than in injuring his opponents. Protasis is turbulent. The epitasis is loud and gentler catastropha.&quot;

He further adds that Hecyra, &quot;in hac prologus est et multiplex et rhectoricus nimis, propterea quod saepe exclusa haec comoedia diligentissima defensione indigebat. atque in hac πρότασις turbulenta est, ἐπίτασις mollior, lenis καταστροφή.&quot; which roughly translate to, &quot;In this the prologue is both multiple and overly rhetorical, because oftentimes this comedy is excluded because it needs a very careful defense. And in this the protasis is turbulent, the milder the epithasis, the softer the catastropha.&quot;

However, he also argues that Latins have a five act chorus, which distinguishes Latins from Greeks, &quot;hoc etiam ut cetera huiusmodi poemata quinque actus habaeat necesse est choris diusos a Graecis poetis.&quot; which roughly translates to, &quot;In order to have other poems of this kind, it is necessary to have five acts of choruses, distinguished from the Greek poets.&quot; making it fairly clear that though he used the Greek for these divisions of play, he did not think of them as part of the overall act structure.

No definitive translation of this work has been made into English.

=== Picaresque novel ===

Born in Spain in the 16th century, the picaresque novel is a type of narrative told in the first person by a lowborn protagonist (&quot;pícaro&quot;) in a realistic setting, often with a satiric tone. Plot and character development is limited. Famous examples are &quot;Lazarillo de Tormes&quot; and Mateo Alemán&#x27;s &quot;Guzmán de Alfarache&quot;.

=== Shakespeare and the Renaissance ===
William Shakespeare did not invent the five-act structure. The five-act structure was made by Gustav Freytag, in which he used Shakespeare as an example. There are no writings from Shakespeare on how he intended his plays to be. There is some thought that people imposed the act structure after his death. During his lifetime, the four-act structure was also popular and used in plays such as Fortunae Ludibrium sive Bellisarius. Freytag made claims in his book that Shakespeare should have used his 5 act structure, but it did not exist at the time period of Shakespeare.

It is argued by Richard Levin that during the Renaissance, multiple plots became far more popular, deviating from Aristotle&#x27;s singular linear plot model.
 Robert Coltrane further argues that the plot structure of the time period was done in foils, with often comedies with a serious plot and then several comedic and outlandish plots around it.

=== Bildungsroman ===
The term was coined in the 1819 by Karl Morgenstern, but the birth of the Bildungsroman is normally dated to the publication of &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Apprenticeship&quot; by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in 1795–96, or, sometimes, to Christoph Martin Wieland&#x27;s &quot;Geschichte des Agathon&quot; of 1767.

The plot requires a young or innocent protagonist who goes on to learn about the world, and learns how to enter it. The central goal is maturity of the protagonist which may be done through discovery, conflict or other means.

=== Freytag&#x27;s pyramid ===

The German playwright and novelist Gustav Freytag wrote &quot;Die Technik des Dramas&quot;, a definitive study of the five-act dramatic structure, in which he laid out what has come to be known as Freytag&#x27;s pyramid. Under Freytag&#x27;s pyramid, the plot of a story consists of five parts:
# Exposition (originally called introduction)
# Rise
# Climax
# Return or Fall
# Catastrophe Freytag is indifferent as to which of the contending parties justice favors; in both groups, good and evil, power and weakness, are mingled.

A drama is then divided into five parts, or acts, which some refer to as a : introduction, rise, climax, return or fall, and catastrophe. Freytag extends the five parts with three moments or crises: the exciting force, the tragic force, and the force of the final suspense. The exciting force leads to the rise, the tragic force leads to the return or fall, and the force of the final suspense leads to the catastrophe. Freytag considers the exciting force to be necessary but the tragic force and the force of the final suspense are optional. Together, they make the eight component parts of the drama.

He argued for tension created through contrasting emotions, but didn&#x27;t actively argue for conflict. He argued that character comes first in plays. He also sets up the groundwork for what would later in history be called the inciting incident.

Overall, Freytag argued the center of a play is emotionality and the best way to get that emotionality is to put contrasting emotions back to back. He laid some of the foundations for centering the hero, unlike Aristotle. He is popularly attributed to have stated conflict at the center of his plays, but he argues actively against continuing conflict.

==== Introduction ====

The setting is fixed in a particular place and time, the mood is set, and characters are introduced. A backstory may be alluded to. Introduction can be conveyed through dialogues, flashbacks, characters&#x27; asides, background details, in-universe media, or the narrator telling a back-story.

==== Rise ====
An exciting force begins immediately after the exposition (introduction), building the rise in one or several stages toward the point of greatest interest. These events are generally the most important parts of the story since the entire plot depends on them to set up the climax and ultimately the satisfactory resolution of the story itself.

==== Climax ====

The climax is the turning point, which changes the protagonist&#x27;s fate. If things were going well for the protagonist, the plot will turn against them, often revealing the protagonist&#x27;s hidden weaknesses. If the story is a comedy, the opposite state of affairs will ensue, with things going from bad to good for the protagonist, often requiring the protagonist to draw on hidden inner strengths.

==== Return or Fall ====
During the Return, the hostility of the counter-party beats upon the soul of the hero. Freytag lays out two rules for this stage: the number of characters be limited as much as possible, and the number of scenes through which the hero falls should be fewer than in the rise. The return or fall may contain a moment of final suspense: Although the catastrophe must be foreshadowed so as not to appear as a non sequitur, there could be for the doomed hero a prospect of relief, where the final outcome is in doubt.

==== Catastrophe ====

The catastrophe (&quot;Katastrophe&quot; in the original) is when the hero meets his logical destruction. Freytag warns the writer not to spare the life of the hero. Despite the term &quot;dénouement&quot; being attested as first appearing in 1752, it was not used to refer to dramatic structure until the 19th century and not specifically used by Freytag for this section of the act structure.

=== Selden Lincoln Whitcomb ===
In 1905, Selden Lincoln Whitcomb published &quot;The Study of a Novel&quot;, and suggested that graphical representation of a novel was possible. &quot;The general epistolary structure may be partially represented by a graphic design.&quot; For which he posts a proposed design for Miss. Burney Evelina on page 21.

He expounds this idea on Page 39 with &quot;The Line of Emotion&quot; where he proposes how one feels about emotion can be drawn graphically. However, he makes a careful distinction between author, character and reader. &quot;The fact that the author presents a character moved by fear does not necessarily mean that the author or the reader experiences that emotion. Nor does a mere discussion of emotion, whether by the author or a character such as one should notice in the study of subject-matter, belong to the line of emotion.&quot; He argued that this line of emotion should be calculated for the reader. He draws a diagram for Silas Marner Chapter XIII to illustrate his point.

He does not prescribe a certain formula for the structure, but instead introduces various kinds of vocabulary for various points along the emotional line.

His work was then used in Joseph Berg Esenwein to describe short stories for the line of emotion, though his name is misspelled in Esenwein&#x27;s work. His diagram specifically for Silas Marner was plagiarized later by Kenneth Rowe, though he drew other diagrams for other novels and forms, such as Pride and Prejudice on page 58, the Epistolary Form p 21, Simple narratives p 56, and so on.

=== Joseph Berg Esenwein ===
Joseph Berg Esenwein in 1909 published, &quot;Writing the short-story; a practical handbook on the rise, structure, writing, and sale of the modern short-story.&quot; In it he outlines the following plot elements and ties it to a drawing, following Whitcomb&#x27;s prescriptions: Incident, emotion, crisis, suspense, climax, dénouement, conclusion. He does not make an accompanying diagram with any of these elements, but does argue that the line of emotion is important to stories on page 198. He also lists types of plots on page 76 as: Surprise, Problem, Mystery, Mood or Emotion or Sentiment, Contrast and Symbolism. He does not argue one to be superior to the other. He cautions multiple times in his text that his prescriptions are only for short stories such as pages 30–32.

Chapter X, Part 5. Climax he defines here as, &quot;the apex of interest and emotion; it is the point of the story.&quot; when quoting &quot;Short Story Writing 1898, Charles Raymond Barrett, p 171&quot; but further expounds here as, &quot;rise of interest and in power to its highest point.&quot; He argues the highest point is always along emotional lines on page 187 stating, &quot;The big thing--at once the basic and the climacteric thing--in the short story is human interest, and there can be no sustained human interest without emotion. The whole creation is a field for its display, and since fiction assumes to be a microcosm, fiction, short and long must deal intimately with emotion, from its gentler to its extreme manifestations.&quot;

The definitions he used would later influence the vocabulary for the Hollywood Formula. Early Hollywood films were short. For example &quot;In Old California&quot; published in 1910 is 17 minutes long.

===Rev. Jesse Ketchum Brennan===

Rev. J.K. Brennan wrote his essay &quot;The General Design of Plays for the book &#x27;The Delphian Course&#x27;&quot; (1912) for the Delphian Society. For the essay, he describes what the diagram and the play of Antigone look like. He outlines eight parts of a play which are:

#The Exposition: This part tells what has happened before the stage action begins. The audience is made acquainted with the setting of the play, its atmosphere, the characters, and their social positions.
#The Turn of the Play: The action of one or more of the characters which sets the course of events moving towards the crisis or climax.
#The Steps of Action, leading to climax (sometimes called Rising Action): A. B. C. etc.
#The Decisive Point of Action. Something takes place which makes it impossible for the &quot;rising action&quot; to go further. Affairs must take a new direction.
#The Falling Action, leading from the climax.
#The Final Lift, something which checks the downward action; a new problem arises.
#The Catastrophe, or Dénouement.
#The End, or the result of the catastrophe

This is the first time that Catastrophe and Dénouement are called the same thing. No references to other works are given in the essay.

=== Clayton Hamilton ===
Clayton Hamilton, in &quot;A Manual of The Art of Fiction&quot; (1918), stated that a proper plot outline is, &quot;A plot, therefore, in its general aspects, may be figured as a complication followed by an explication, a tying followed by an untying, or (to say the same thing in French words which are perhaps more connotative) a nouement followed by a dénouement.&quot;

He does not state the center of stories is conflict, but rather on page 3 that, &quot;The purpose of fiction is to embody certain truths of human life in a series of imagined facts.&quot; and centers on the debate of the time between romanticism and realism.

The complication is what Lajos Egri later called the premise and it was later pushed to be part of the inciting incident. The explication was put first and then explained to be the introduction in the contemporary vocabulary. The dénouement would be split later into falling action and conclusion.

=== Confessional writing ===
Sprung originally from Christianity, it is often an account of a person&#x27;s life that was first secularized by Jean Jacques Rousseau and then popularized in 1919 with the magazine &quot;True Story&quot;. The confessions don&#x27;t really have to be valid, though an account of someone&#x27;s life needs to be included. Such confessions magazines were chiefly aimed at an audience of working-class women. Their formula has been characterized as &quot;sin-suffer-repent&quot;: The heroine violates standards of behavior, suffers as a consequence, learns her lesson, and resolves to live in light of it, not embittered by her pain.

=== Percy Lubbock ===
Percy Lubbock wrote &quot;The Craft of Fiction&quot;, which was published in 1921.

The aim of Lubbock is to give a shape or a formula to books, because he states: &quot;We hear the phrase on all sides, an unending argument is waged over it. One critic condemns a novel as &#x27;shapeless,&#x27; meaning that its shape is objectionable; another retorts that if the novel has other fine qualities, its shape is unimportant; and the two will continue their controversy till an onlooker, pardonably bewildered, may begin to suppose that &quot;form&quot; in fiction is something to be put in or left out of a novel according to the taste of the author. But though the discussion is indeed confusingly worded at times, it is clear that there is agreement on this article at least—that a book is a thing to which a shape is ascribable, good or bad.&quot;

He also argued for &quot;Death of the Author&quot; somewhat in his work, &quot;The reader of a novel—by which I mean the critical reader—is himself a novelist; he is the maker of a book which may or may not please his taste when it is finished, but of a book for which he must take his own share of the responsibility. The author does his part, but he cannot transfer his book like a bubble into the brain of the critic; he cannot make sure that the critic will possess his work. The reader must therefore become, for his part, a novelist, never permitting himself to suppose that the creation of the book is solely the affair of the author.&quot;

He is the first to make a concentrated effort at looking at conflict as the center of &quot;drama&quot; and therefore stories, &quot;What is the story? There is first of all a succession of phases in the lives of certain generations; youth that passes out into maturity, fortunes that meet and clash and re-form, hopes that flourish and wane and reappear in other lives, age that sinks and hands on the torch to youth again—such is the substance of the drama. The book, I take it, begins to grow out of the thought of the processional march of the generations, always changing, always renewed; its figures are sought and chosen for the clarity with which the drama is embodied in them.&quot; He directly mentions conflict when referring to the plot of &quot;War and Peace&quot; with analyzing &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; and so on.

The book was wildly, popular, but Virginia Woolf privately wrote of the work that, &quot;This is my prime discovery so far; &amp; the fact that I&#x27;ve been so long finding it, proves, I think, how false Percy Lubbock&#x27;s doctrine is--that you can do this sort of thing consciously.&quot; in November 1923. She went back and forth on the work throughout her life.

=== Kenneth Thorpe Rowe ===
In 1939, Kenneth Thorpe Rowe published &quot;Write That Play&quot; in which he outlined what he thought of his ideal play structure. He did not cite any sources, though there looks to be some influence from Freytag&#x27;s Pyramid.

The parts are: introduction, attack, rising action, crisis, falling action, resolution, conclusion. The attack would be relabeled the &quot;inciting incident&quot; later and the crisis would be relabeled &quot;climax&quot; and the conclusion as the &quot;dénouement&quot; by Syd Field. The resolution as a turning point was also taken out. The center of the play should be, according to him, conflict as this will excite the most emotion.

He acknowledges other people have used climax, but does not cite who, but objects to the term &quot;climax&quot; because, &quot;Climax is misleading because it might with equal fitness be applied to the resolution. Climax applied to the turning point suggests increasing tension up to that point, and relaxation following it. What actually happens is that the tension continues to increase in a well con-structured play from the turning point to the resolution, but is given a new direction and impetus at the turning point.&quot;

Despite this being his ideal shape for a play, he suggests that this can be modified to include more complications on the Rising action or the Falling action. He further suggests that the play structure doesn&#x27;t need a conclusion. However, if there is a conclusion, he suggests making it shorter than the Introduction and it can either be flat or acute in angle.

This story structure, as suggested, had a strong influence on Arthur Miller (&quot;All My Sons&quot;, &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;).

=== Lajos Egri ===
In his book &quot;The Art of Dramatic Writing&quot;, published 1946, Lajos Egri argued for more look inside of character&#x27;s minds and that character generates conflict, which generates events. He cites Moses Louis Malevinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Science of Playwriting&quot; and &quot;The Theory of Theater&quot; by Clayton Hamilton. Unlike previous works he cites from, he emphasized the importance of premise to a play.

He is also far more interested in looking at character creating conflict and events, than events shaping characters. He states this by arguing for different kinds of conflict: Static, jump and rise. These in turn can also be an attack or counterattack. He argues that Rising conflict is the best at revealing character.

He also examines character through the lens of physiology, sociology and psychology.

His work influenced Syd Field, who went on to make the 3-act Hollywood formula.

=== Syd Field ===

Syd Field in 1979 published Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting. He outlined that the structure of the play should be:

Act I contains the setup. It is approximately the first quarter of a screenplay, and reveals the main character, premise, and situation of the story.

Act II contains the confrontation. It lasts for the next two quarters of the screenplay, and clearly defines the main goal of the protagonist.

Act III contains the resolution. This is the final quarter of the screenplay. This answers the question as to whether or not the main character succeeded in his or her goal.

He outlined in the 2005 edition of his book Foundations of a Screenplay, that he wanted to give a more set structure to the work that Lajos Egri had laid out.

He was the first to really coin the Three Act model as a formal model for screenplays.

=== Theatre of the Absurd ===

Critic Martin Esslin coined the term in his 1960 essay &quot;The Theatre of the Absurd&quot;, which begins by focusing on the playwrights Samuel Beckett, Arthur Adamov, and Eugène Ionesco. Esslin says that their plays have a common denominator — the &quot;absurd&quot;, a word that Esslin defines with a quotation from Ionesco: &quot;absurd is that which has not purpose, or goal, or objective.&quot; The French philosopher Albert Camus, in his 1942 essay &quot;Myth of Sisyphus&quot;, describes the human situation as meaningless and absurd.

Plot-wise it often undercuts the conflict in the story and mocks the human condition. It often lacks any formal plot structure. Often nothing really gets resolved.

=== Television Story Arcs ===
Although soap operas had been telling serialized stories since the 1950s, television multiple-episode story arcs in prime time were not popular in the U.S. until 1981, with the introduction of &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;. Prior to that, episodes could be shifted in order without audience confusion. Multiple-episode story arcs took off in the 1990s, with many of the popular television shows employing them. &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, and &quot;&quot; all had story arcs.

=== Northrop Frye&#x27;s dramatic structure ===
The Canadian literary critic and theorist Northrop Frye analyzes the narratives of the Bible in terms of two dramatic structures: (1) a U-shaped pattern, which is the shape of a comedy, and (2) an inverted U-shaped pattern, which is the shape of a tragedy.

==== A U-shaped pattern ====
&quot;This U-shaped pattern . . . recurs in literature as the standard shape of comedy, where a series of misfortunes and misunderstandings brings the action to a threateningly low point, after which some fortunate twist in the plot sends the conclusion up to a happy ending.&quot; A U-shaped plot begins at the top of the U with a state of equilibrium, a state of prosperity or happiness, which is disrupted by disequilibrium or disaster. At the bottom of the U, the direction is reversed by a fortunate twist, divine deliverance, an awakening of the protagonist to his or her tragic circumstances, or some other action or event that results in an upward turn of the plot. Aristotle referred to the reversal of direction as peripeteia or peripety, which depends frequently on a recognition or discovery by the protagonist. Aristotle called this discovery an anagnorisis—a change from &quot;ignorance to knowledge&quot; involving &quot;matters which bear on prosperity or adversity&quot;. The protagonist recognizes something of great importance that was previously hidden or unrecognized. The reversal occurs at the bottom of the U and moves the plot upward to a new stable condition marked by prosperity, success, or happiness. At the top of the U, equilibrium is restored.

A classic example of a U-shaped plot in the Bible is the Parable of the Prodigal Son in Luke 15:11–24. The parable opens at the top of the U with a stable condition but turns downward after the son asks the father for his inheritance and sets out for a &quot;distant country&quot; (Luke 15:13). Disaster strikes: the son squanders his inheritance and famine in the land increases his dissolution (Luke 15:13–16). This is the bottom of the U. A recognition scene (Luke 15:17) and a peripety move the plot upward to its dénouement, a new stable condition at the top of the U.

==== An inverted U-shaped structure ====
The inverted U begins with the protagonist&#x27;s rise to a position of prominence and well-being. At the top of the inverted U, the character enjoys good fortune and well-being. But a crisis or a turning point occurs, which marks the reversal of the protagonist&#x27;s fortunes and begins the descent to disaster. Sometimes a recognition scene occurs where the protagonist sees something of great importance that was previously unrecognized. The final state is disaster and adversity, the bottom of the inverted U.

=== Contemporary ===
Contemporary dramas increasingly use the fall to increase the relative height of the climax and dramatic impact (melodrama). The protagonist reaches up but falls and succumbs to doubts, fears, and limitations. The negative climax occurs when the protagonist has an epiphany and encounters the greatest fear possible or loses something important, giving the protagonist the courage to take on another obstacle. This confrontation becomes the classic climax.

In her 2019 book &quot;Meander, Spiral, Explode: Design and Pattern in Narrative&quot; novelist and writing teacher Jane Alison criticized the conflict-climax-resolution structure of narrative as &quot;masculo-sexual,&quot; and instead argues that narratives should form around various types patterns, for example found in nature.

<doc id="766050" wikidata="Q77615" url="?curid=766050" title="Jan Valtin">
<text>Richard Julius Hermann Krebs (December 17, 1905 - January 1, 1951), better known by his alias Jan Valtin, was a German writer during the interwar period. He settled in the United States in 1938, and in 1940 (as Valtin) wrote his bestselling book &quot;Out of the Night&quot;.

==Background==

Krebs became active in the Communist movement as a boy, when his father was involved in the naval mutiny that heralded the German Revolution of 1918–19.

==Career==

In the second week of May 1923, Valtin joined the German Communist Party, and participated in the Hamburg Uprising. Valtin stated, &quot;I learned well the Party principle that the heart of the Comintern...must consist of an inner organization of men and women whose one and only aim in life is to work for the revolution; who are ready for any personal sacrifice the Party should demand, who are pledged to unreserved obedience to their Central Committee and utmost unity of aims.&quot; 

Valtin was selected to attend the Leningrad Communist University. Subjects ranged according to Valtin, &quot;from &quot;Marx&#x27;s &#x27; theory of surplus value&#x27; to the &#x27;application of Clausewitz&#x27;s Rules of Warfare in the conduct of strikes,&#x27; from &#x27;revolutionary defeatism and the transformation of an imperialist war into a civil war&#x27; to &#x27;mass psychology and propaganda&#x27;.&quot;

===Arrest===

In 1926, working as a courier, he stowawayed to Victoria, British Columbia and then hitch hiked to San Francisco and made contact with the Comintern. Valtin was assigned to execute someone in Los Angeles, but failed in the attempt, was caught, and sentenced to San Quentin State Prison. During the 1000 days he spent there, he studied Bowditch&#x27;s American Practical Navigator, astronomy, journalism, map making, English, French, and Spanish. After being released in December 1929, he returned to Europe.

In January 1931, while in Germany, he participated in the &quot;United action of the Communist Party and the Hitler movement to accelerate the disintegration of the crumbling democratic bloc which governs Germany.&quot; After graduating with a navigator&#x27;s certificate, he was assigned as the Soviet skipper transporting the &quot;Pioner&quot; from the Bremer Vulkan shipyard to Murmansk.

===&quot;Out of the Night&quot;===
In February 1933, Valtin states, &quot;We in the upper ranks of the Party had no illusions as to the terror that would soon be unleashed against us by the Hitler movement. Our wild general strike call was a God-send to Hitler. It enabled him to proceed to the crushing even of liberal anti-Nazi forces under the cry, &#x27;Save Germany from Bolshevism and Civil War!&#x27;.&quot;

On 30 November 1933, Valtin was arrested by the Gestapo. Held at Concentration Camp Fuhlsbuettel, Valtin states, &quot;I had thought much about the black, humiliating defeat of the Communist Party of Germany, and I could not find a satisfying answer. The Geastapo broke me on March 11, 1934.&quot;

On 29 September 1936, still a prisoner of the Gestapo, Valtin was told by the Comintern to seek undercover work within the Gestapo organization. On 17 February 1937, he pledged &quot;...my willingness to accept and execute to the best of my abilities all and any orders issued to me by the Secret State Police of Germany (Gestapo).&quot; By May 1937, he departed Germany as ordered to establish contact with the Comintern in Copenhagen. By September, Valtin states, &quot;I accused myself of allowing my love for my wife and child to make me waver in my life-long commitment to Stalin&#x27;s cause...I began to hate the movement I served, hate its hypocrisy, hate the brigands who led it.&quot;

Severing ties with the Gestapo, Valtin was arrested by the G.P.U. in Copenhagen. However, in January 1938, Valtin was able to escape. In December, he received word that his wife Firelei had perished in Fuhlsbuettel.

In 1938, he returned to the United States to settle, this time under his most famous alias, Jan Valtin - where he published the highly publicized autobiography &quot;Out of the Night&quot;. In the book he described in detail the actions he supposedly had carried on as a secret agent of the Soviet State Political Directorate, or GPU. The 1926 attempted murder was described by Krebs/Valtin as a GPU operation. The book received great critical acclaim. A 1940 review for the &quot;Saturday Review of Literature&quot; reads: &quot;No other books more clearly reveals the aid which Stalin gave to Hitler before he won power&quot;.

===Congressional testimony===

Valtin/Krebs was invited to testify before the Dies Committee as regards Soviet secret activities in Europe.

On May 26, 1941, Richard Julius Krebs testified before the House of Representatives&#x27; Subcommittee of the Special Committee to Investigate Un-American Activities (the &quot;Dies Committee&quot;) that he had worked for the Gestapo for the Comintern. Research director J.B. Matthews had Sender Garlin had reviewed &quot;Out of the Night&quot; unfavorably in the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; newspaper of January 21, 1941. Garlin claimed no &quot;Jan Valtin&quot; existed and that the book&#x27;s authors were Isaac Don Levine, Walter Krivitsky, and Freda Utley (known ex- or anti-communists). Krebs said he had defected in December 1937 - January 1938.

===Arrest===

In November 1942, Krebs was also indicted as a Gestapo agent. He was arrested in December 1942 and found innocent in May 1943. The Los Angeles court record revealed that the 1926 crime had no political purpose. This event marked the end of Krebs/Valtin&#x27;s career as a &quot;Soviet expert&quot;. The &quot;New York Mirror&quot; said about his book &quot;Out of the Night&quot;: &quot;In effect, the decision means he perpetrated a huge literary hoax.&quot;

===US war service===

In August 1943, Krebs was drafted as an infantryman and deployed in February 1944 to the Philippines in fighting the Japanese in the Pacific War. In 1946, his book &quot;Children of Yesterday&quot;, an anecdotal history of the 24th Infantry Division was published, describing in graphic detail the horrors of the fighting and everyday life of the division&#x27;s troops.

He was granted citizenship in 1947.

==Personal life and death==
On 27 September 1932, Jan&#x27;s first wife Firelei, gave birth to their son Jan. According to elder Jan, &quot;On the wall above the bed was a picture showing Lenin in a pensive pose. A Party physician and a nurse from the corps of communist Samaritans attended.&quot;

Valtin/Krebs married again, before 1941, to Abigail Harris, an American. At the time of his death The Evening Star newspaper reported that he had been married three times, his third wife being Clara Medders of Chestertown, Md., and that he had three sons from his previous marriages. 

Richard Krebs died at the Kent-Queen Anne&#x27;s Hospital on the evening of January 1, 1951 from lobar pneumonia. Prior to his death he had resided in Betterton, Md. for about six years.

The Board of Immigration Appeals declared: His life has been so marked with violence, intrigue and treachery that it would be difficult, if not wholly unwarranted, to conclude that his present reliability and good character have been established. [...] Within the past five years the subject has been considered an agent of Nazi Germany. On the record before us it appears he has been completely untrustworthy and amoral.&quot;

The truth, however, is more complex. After he served his time in custody as ordered by US immigration authorities, he led a useful life putting the allegations of amorality and untrustworthiness to the lie. Then, late in life, Richard Krebs came to the service of his country in the clandestine anti-communist efforts launched by the US intelligence agencies still operating in Europe in the early years of the Cold War. To understand this view see SPYWRITER: Richard Krebs’ Astonishing Journey from German Communist Conspirator to American Combat Hero.

<text>Egbert Anson Van Alstyne (March 4, 1878 – July 9, 1951) was an American songwriter and pianist. Van Alstyne was the composer of a number of popular and ragtime tunes of the early 20th century.

==Biography==

Van Alstyne was born in Marengo, Illinois. After some time touring in Vaudeville he moved to New York City, initially working as a Tin Pan Alley song-plugger until he was able to make his living as a songwriter. He teamed with lyricist Harry H. Williams. Their first success was &quot;Navajo&quot; which was introduced in the Broadway musical &quot;Nancy Brown&quot; in 1903 and became one of the first records by Billy Murray early in 1904. Their best remembered song is &quot;In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree&quot; from 1905.

Other Van Alstyne hits included &quot;Won&#x27;t You Come Over to My House?&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid to Come Home in the Dark&quot;, and &quot;Memories&quot;.

Van Alstyne shares credit with Tony Jackson on the hit &quot;Pretty Baby&quot;. It was common for Tin Pan Alley publishers to add the name of one of their famous hit makers to tunes, and many have speculated this as being the main reason for Van Alstyne&#x27;s name appearing on the piece, but Van Alstyne may have had a hand in writing or modifying the verse to Jackson&#x27;s famous chorus.

He recorded a number of piano rolls.
Van Alstyne lived for many years in Chicago. He died there on July 9, 1951, and was buried in Memorial Park Cemetery in Evanston, Illinois.

==Works, 1900–1920==
==Awards and honors==
He was inducted into Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.

<text>Braemar is a village in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, around west of Aberdeen in the Highlands. It is the closest significantly-sized settlement to the upper course of the River Dee, sitting at an elevation of .

The Gaelic &quot;Bràigh Mhàrr&quot; properly refers to the area of upper Marr (as it literally means), i.e. the area of Marr to the west of Aboyne, the village itself being Castleton of Braemar (&quot;Baile a&#x27; Chaisteil&quot; in Scottish Gaelic). The village used to be known as &quot;Cinn Drochaid&quot; (&#x27;bridge end&#x27;); &quot;Baile a&#x27; Chaisteil&quot; referred to only the part of the village on the east bank of the river, the part on the west bank being known as &quot;Ach an Droighinn&quot; (&#x27;thorn field&#x27;).

==Geography==
Braemar is approached from the south on the A93 from Glen Clunie and the Cairnwell Pass and from the East also on the A93 from Deeside. Braemar can be approached on foot from the west through Glen Tilt, Glen Feshie, Glen Dee (by the Lairig Ghru), and Glen Derry (by the Lairig an Laoigh). Braemar is within a one-and-a-half-hour drive of Aberdeen, Dundee, and Perth.

The village is overlooked from roughly northwest by Carn na Drochaide (818 m), from roughly northeast by Creag Choinneach (538 m), from roughly southwest by Carn na Sgliat (690 m), and from roughly southwest by Morrone (859 m).

===Climate===

Like most of the United Kingdom, Braemar experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;) though somewhat cooler than lowland areas, verging on a subpolar oceanic climate.

Braemar is the third-coldest low-lying place in the UK after the villages of Dalwhinnie and Leadhills with an annual mean temperature of . Braemar has twice entered the UK weather records with a low temperature of , recorded on 11 February 1895 and again on 10 January 1982. This record is shared with Altnaharra in the Scottish Highlands.

Braemar has an annual average of 102 days of air frost and 153 days with 1 mm or more of rainfall. Snowfall can be heavy in winter and early spring, and often accumulates to depths of or more. was recorded by weather watcher Chris Booth on 9 February 2021.

It was the lowest February temperature since 1955 and the UK&#x27;s coldest night since 30 December 1995.
==History==
The modern village sits over the Clunie Water, a strategically important crossing on the Elsick Mounth, an ancient trackway used by Picts and Romans. It is located in the upper end of the historical Earldom of Mar, literally the &quot;Braes o&#x27; Mar&quot;. The Scottish Gaelic name &quot;Bràigh Mhàrr&quot; (&#x27;Upland of Mar&#x27;) was originally applied to the general area; using &quot;Braemar&quot; for the village dates to around 1870.

Before the 11th century, there were separate hamlets on each bank of the Clunie, &quot;Auchendryne&quot; on the west and &quot;Castleton&quot; on the east, or &quot;Bail Chasteil&quot;. The names are clearly marked on the current Ordnance Survey maps, below &#x27;Braemar&#x27;. &#x27;Castleton&#x27; refers to Kindrochit Castle, located within the modern village, rather than Braemar Castle to the south, while &quot;Kindrochit&quot; means &#x27;bridge end&#x27;. Kindrochit (or Kindrochit-Alian) was known as &quot;Doldauha&quot; before the mid-9th century.
According to legend, Malcolm III came to the area in around 1059, and built a timber bridge connecting the east and west banks. &#x27;Kindrochit&#x27; means &quot;bridge end&quot; and the castle is assumed to have been built to protect the crossing. The ruins are considered to be largely of 14th-century origin, replacing the presumed timber-construction of the original castle.

Following the accession of George I in 1714, the Earl of Mar launched the 1715 Jacobite Rising on 6 September at Braemar. In 1795, a Roman Catholic Mass house was built on the high-ground to the west of Auchendryne, giving the name to Chapel Brae, which was used as a school.

Until the 20th century, Braemar was largely owned by one of the adjoining Mar Estates, with Auchendryne and Invercauld on one side, Castleton on the other. Allegedly, inter-estate rivalry was a factor in each having its own pub, the Fife Arms Hotel in Auchendryne, and the Invercauld Arms Hotel in Castleton, built over the mound where the Earl of Mar raised the Jacobite standard in 1715.

Auchindryne (to use the spelling by Wyness) from &quot;Ach&#x27; an Droighinn&quot; (&#x27;field of the thorn&#x27;) belonged to a branch of the Farquharsons until it was forfeited in the aftermath of the Jacobite rising of 1745. Later that century it was acquired by William Duff, 1st Earl Fife.

The Catholic Church in Braemar is dedicated to Saint Andrew and, following Catholic Emancipation, it was built in 1839. Catholicism has traditionally been strong in the Braemar area, and the bones of Saint Andrew rested in Braemar before being taken to the place now known as St Andrews. St Ninian&#x27;s Chapel, Braemar, completed in 1898, is the Scottish Episcopal Church place of worship.

Johann von Lamont (1805–1879), the Scottish-German astronomer and astrophysicist who pioneered the study of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field was born in nearby Corriemulzie.

On 16 March 2022, the 19th-century Braemar Lodge Hotel was engulfed in a fire and explosion.

==Language==
In the 1891 census, 59.2% of the population of Braemar spoke the Gaelic language &quot;habitually&quot;; the percentage of those actually able to speak the language (despite not having much opportunity to) would have been somewhat higher. The small crofting township of Inverey (&quot;Inbhir Èidh&quot;) was 86.3% Gaelic-speaking, most non-speakers being originally from Lower Deeside. The Gaelic spoken in the Aberdeenshire Highlands shared most features in common with the Gaelic of Strathspey and East Perthshire. The last native-speaker of the local Gaelic dialect died in 1984, though there are still surviving native-speakers of the similar Strathspey dialect.
At the 2001 census, out of a total population of 839 in Crathie and Braemar Civil Parish, only 5 (0.6%) claimed to be Gaelic-speakers.

==Braemar Gathering==
Known colloquially as &quot;The Games&quot; and originating from those believed to have been held by Malcolm III, an annual Highland games gathering is held at Braemar on the first Saturday in September and is traditionally attended by the British royal family.

In 1746, the Act of Proscription stopped all clan gatherings, but following its repeal in 1782, the old enthusiasms for such events returned. In 1815, the Braemar Highland Society was created and officially constituted in 1817; the first modern-day games taking place in 1832 with cash prizes being awarded to the competitors, using the funds of the Braemar Highland Society. On 14 September 1848, Queen Victoria attended the Gathering at Invercauld. In 1866, &quot;Royal&quot; was added to &quot;Braemar Highland Society&quot; and in 1906, the Duke of Fife presented of Mar Estate to the society, and the Princess Royal and Duke of Fife Memorial Park, the current home of the Braemar Gathering, was created.

Since Queen Victoria&#x27;s time, the reigning monarch has been the patron of the Braemar Royal Highland Society, and is styled Chieftain at the games. The current Chieftain of the Braemar Gathering is King Charles III.

Lots of events are held, including:

* hill running;
* heavy events;
* light events; and

* Highland dancing. The Highland dancing is high quality owing to careful selection by the organisers. As the dancing boards are located right in front of the patrons&#x27; pavilions, some of the dancers have been watched by members of the royal family, including Queen Elizabeth II and King Charles III.
Another event that happens at Braemar is the presentation of the Aberdeenshire League/Walker&#x27;s Shortbread League winners. The overall top six dancers from across certain Highland games held over the summer are presented with their awards. Each dancer receives a tin of Walker&#x27;s shortbread (hence the nickname &#x27;Shortbread League&#x27;) and a commemorative vase, picture or something similar. 
==Amenities==

Braemar has a golf course, two large hotels (Fife Arms and Invercauld Arms) as well as many smaller hotels and private homes offering bed and breakfast-style accommodation and a large SYHA hostel. On the southern edge of the village there is also a caravan site. Braemar also has a small post office/village shop and mountain bike hire.

The Morrone Birkwood Nature Reserve is a nature reserve on the edge of the village reached from the car park at the top of Chapel Brae.

There are three churches in Braemar. St Andrew&#x27;s Catholic Church, St Ninian&#x27;s Chapel (Scottish Episcopal Church) which is located in the grounds of the Mar Lodge Estate (sharing a Priest with Aboyne &amp; Ballater), and Braemar Church of Scotland (sharing a minister with Crathie Kirk).

== Transportation ==
There is a regular bus service between Braemar and Aberdeen.

==Local residents==
* John Farquharson, S.J. (1699-1782), son of Lewis Farquharson the Elder, Laird of Inverey and Auchindryne, who became an outlawed Roman Catholic priest of the Society of Jesus assigned to Clan Chisholm and Clan Fraser of Lovat in The Aird, Strathglass, and Strathfarrar between 1729 and 1753. His lost manuscript collection of local Scottish Gaelic literature and lays from the Fenian Cycle of Celtic Mythology later played an important role in the Ossianic controversy.

<text>Sergey Ivanovich Vavilov ( ; – January 25, 1951) was a Soviet physicist, the President of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union from July 1945 until his death. His elder brother Nikolai Vavilov was a famous Russian geneticist.

==Biography==
Vavilov founded the Soviet school of physical optics, known by his works in luminescence. In 1934 he co-discovered the Vavilov-Cherenkov effect, a discovery for which Pavel Cherenkov was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1958. The Kasha–Vavilov rule of luminescence quantum yields is also named for him.

He was a member of the USSR Academy of Sciences from 1932, Head of the Lebedev Institute of Physics (since 1934), a chief editor of the &quot;Great Soviet Encyclopedia&quot;, a member of the Supreme Soviet from 1946 and a recipient of four Stalin Prizes (1943, 1946, 1951, 1952).

He wrote on the lives and works of great thinkers, such as Lucretius, Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, Mikhail Lomonosov, Michael Faraday, and Pyotr Lebedev, among others.

At the end of 1950, Vavilov&#x27;s health who was suffering from heart and lung diseases deteriorated significantly. In December-January he was treated at the Barvikha Sanatorium. Returning from the sanatorium on January 12, 1951, he chaired an expanded meeting of the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences. On January 25, 1951, at 4:45 a.m., he died of a myocardial infarction.

==Legacy==
A meteorological station (as well as a glacier and an ice cap) in October Revolution Island, in the Severnaya Zemlya group have been named after Vavilov. A minor planet 2862 Vavilov discovered in 1977 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Chernykh is named after him and his brother Nikolai Vavilov. The crater &quot;Vavilov&quot; on the far side of the Moon is also named after him and his brother. 

There is a ship named after him, the Akademik Sergey Vavilov. She is a research vessel that can carry approximately 150 crew and passengers, and is a Class-1A icebreaker which regularly makes trips to Antarctica and the Arctic. In the summer of 2010 she was working in and around the coast of Svalbard. Also, an Aeroflot plane, with VO-BHL identification number is named after him.

<text>Walter Germanovich Krivitsky (Ва́льтер Ге́рманович Криви́цкий; birth name &quot;Samuel Gershevich Ginsberg,&quot; Самуил Гершевич Гинзберг, June 28, 1899 – February 10, 1941) was a Soviet military intelligence spymaster who defected to the West and revealed plans for the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.

==Early life==
Walter Krivitsky was born on June 28, 1899, to Jewish parents as Samuel Ginsberg in Podwołoczyska, Galicia, Austria-Hungary (now Pidvolochysk, Ukraine). He adopted the name &quot;Krivitsky,&quot; which was based on the Slavic root for &quot;crooked, twisted&quot;. It was a revolutionary &quot;nom de guerre&quot; when he entered the Cheka, the Bolshevik security and intelligence service.

==Espionage==

Krivitsky operated as an illegal resident spy, with false name and papers, in Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Italy, and Hungary. He rose to the rank of control officer. He is credited with having organised industrial sabotage, stealing plans for submarines and planes, intercepting correspondence between Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, and recruiting many agents, including Magda Lupescu (&quot;Madame Lepescu&quot;) and Noel Field.

Following the decision to create the International Brigade in September 1936, Krivitsky organised in The Hague the recruitment of volunteers for the Spanish Civil War.

In May 1937, Krivitsky was sent to The Hague, Netherlands, to operate as the &quot;rezident&quot; (regional control officer), operating under the cover of an antiquarian. There he co-ordinated intelligence operations throughout Western Europe.

==Defection==

While he was in the Hague, the General Staff of the Red Army was subjected to the Great Purge in Moscow, which Krivitsky and his close friend, Ignace Reiss, also then stationed abroad, found deeply disturbing. Reiss wanted to defect, but Krivitsky repeatedly held back. Finally, Reiss defected, as he announced in a defiant letter to Moscow. His assassination, in Switzerland, in September 1937 prompted Krivitsky to defect the following month.

In Paris, Krivitsky began to write articles and made contact with Lev Sedov, Trotsky&#x27;s son, and the Trotskyists. There, he also met undercover Soviet spy Mark Zborowski, known as &quot;Etienne,&quot; whom Sedov had sent to protect him. Sedov died mysteriously in February 1938, but Krivitsky eluded attempts to kill or kidnap him in France, partly by fleeing to Hyères.

As a result of Krivitsky&#x27;s debriefing, the British were able to arrest John Herbert King, a cypher clerk in the Foreign Office. He also gave a vague description of two other Soviet spies, Donald Maclean and John Cairncross but without enough detail to enable their arrest. The Soviet intelligence operation in the United Kingdom was thrown into disarray for a time.

==Anti-Stalinist activism==
At the end of 1938, anticipating the Nazi conquest of Europe, Krivitsky sailed from France to the United States. Krivitsky did not stop with defection; he went on to become a vocal member of the anti-Stalinist Left.

===&quot;In Stalin&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;===
With the help of journalist Isaac Don Levine and literary agent Paul Wohl, Krivitsky produced an inside account of Stalin&#x27;s underhanded methods. It appeared in book form as &quot;In Stalin&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (UK title: &quot;I Was Stalin&#x27;s Agent&quot;, published by the Right Book Club), published on November 15, 1939, after appearing first in sensational serial form in April 1939 in the top magazine of the time, the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;. (The title had appeared as a phrase in an article written by Reiss&#x27;s wife on the first anniversary of her husband&#x27;s assassination: &quot;Reiss... had been in Stalin&#x27;s secret service for many years and knew what fate to expect.&quot;) The book received a tepid review by the very influential &quot;New York Times&quot;. Attacked by the American left, Krivitsky was vindicated when the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact, which he had predicted, was signed in August 1939.

===Testimony===
Torn between a lingering dedication to Marxist-Leninist ideology and his growing detestation of Stalinism, Krivitsky came to believe that it was his duty to cooperate with the U.S. intelligence community. That decision caused him much mental anguish, as he impressed on his former agent and fellow defector Whittaker Chambers, but to whom Krivitsky ultimately stated, &quot;In our time, informing is a duty&quot; (recounted by Chambers in his autobiography, &quot;Witness&quot;).

Krivitsky testified before the Dies Committee (later to become the House Un-American Activities Committee) in October 1939, and sailed as &quot;Walter Thomas&quot; to London in January 1940 to be debriefed by Jane Archer (Jane Sissmore) of British domestic counterintelligence, MI5. In doing so, he revealed much about Soviet espionage. It is a matter of controversy whether he gave MI5 clues to the identity of Soviet agents Donald Maclean and Kim Philby. It is certain, however, that Lavrenty Beria, the head of the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), learned of Krivitsky&#x27;s testimony and ordered operations to assassinate him.

==Death==

Krivitsky soon returned to North America, landing in Canada. Always in trouble with the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, Krivitsky was not able to return there until November 1940. Krivitsky retained Louis Waldman to represent him on legal matters. (Waldman was a long-time friend of Isaac Don Levine.) Meanwhile, the assassination of Trotsky in Mexico on August 21, 1940, convinced him that he was now at the top of the NKVD hit list. His last two months in New York were filled with plans to settle in Virginia and to write but also with doubts and dread.

On February 10, 1941, at 9:30 a.m., Krivitsky was found dead in the Bellevue Hotel (now Kimpton George Hotel) in Washington, DC, by a chambermaid, with three suicide notes by the bed. His body was lying in a pool of blood, caused by a single bullet wound to the right temple from a .38 caliber revolver found grasped in Krivitsky&#x27;s right hand. A report dated June 10, 1941, indicates he had been dead for approximately six hours.

According to many sources (including Krivitsky himself), he was murdered by Soviet intelligence, but the official investigation, unaware of the NKVD manhunt, concluded that Krivitsky committed suicide. People with close ties to Krivitsky later recounted opposite interpretations of his death:

* Suicide, Reiss&#x27; wife wrote in 1969: 
* Assassination, Chambers wrote in 1952: 
* Assassination, Victor Serge wrote in 1944:
* Assassination, William J. Hood, former CIA head of counterintelligence, wrote in 1984:

Speculation persists into the 21st century. For example, in 2017, Anthony Percy&#x27;s book &quot;Misdefending the Realm&quot; (Buckingham: University of Buckingham Press, 2017) argued that Krivitsky was the UK&#x27;s most important source on Soviet plan, did not receive action from MI5 on the intelligence that he supplied, and was assassinated by Soviet intelligence after Guy Burgess informed Soviet superiors about him. The assassination, Percy argues, cleared the threat of exposure of the Cambridge Five and other moles.

===Survivors===
At the first news of his death, Whittaker Chambers found Krivitsky&#x27;s wife, Antonina (&quot;Tonia&quot; according to Kern, &quot;Tonya&quot; according to Chambers) and son Alek in New York City. He took them by train to Florida, where they stayed with Chambers&#x27;s family, which had already fled New Smyrna. Both families hid there several months, fearing further Soviet reprisals. The families then returned to Chambers&#x27;s farm in Westminster, Maryland. Within a short time, however, Tonia and Alek returned to New York.

His wife and son lived in poverty for the rest of their lives. Alek died of a brain tumor in his early 30s after he had served in the United States Navy and studied at Columbia University. Tonia, who changed her surname legally to &quot;Thomas&quot;, continued to live and work in New York City until she retired to Ossining, where she died at 94 in 1996 in a nursing home.

<text>Serge Abrahamovitch Voronoff (; c. July 10, 1866September 3, 1951) was a French surgeon of Russian origin who gained fame for his practice of xenotransplantation of monkey testicle tissues onto the testicles of men, purportedly as an anti-aging therapy while working in France in the 1920s and 1930s.

His practices made him significantly wealthier. However, his theories remained controversial throughout his life, and he was often ridiculed by medical professionals over his claims. According to one contemporary newspaper, he was famously known as the &quot;monkey gland man.&quot; Ultimately almost all his works were later proven false.

==Personal life==
Serge (Samuel) Voronoff was born to a Jewish family in the village Shekhman, Tambov Governorate in Russia (now Tambov Oblast) shortly before July 10, 1866, the date of his circumcision in a synagogue. His father Abram Veniaminovich Voronov was a former cantonist and a distiller; his mother was Rachel-Esther Lipsky. At the age of 18, after graduating from the Voronezh Realschule, he emigrated to France, where he studied medicine. In 1895 at the age of 29, Voronoff became a naturalized French citizen. Voronoff was a student of French surgeon, biologist, eugenicist, and Nobel Prize recipient Alexis Carrel, from whom he learnt surgical techniques of transplantation. Between 1896 and 1910, he worked in Egypt, studying the retarding effects that castration had on eunuchs, observations that would lead to his later work on rejuvenation.

Voronoff married his first wife, Marguerite Barbe, in 1897. She died in 1910. He married his second wife, Evelyn Bostwick, in 1920 (Bostwick&#x27;s daughter from a previous marriage was Marion &quot;Joe&quot; Carstairs). Bostwick translated Voronoff&#x27;s book, &quot;Life: a means of restoring vital energy and prolonging life&quot;, into English. She died on March 3, 1921, at the age of 48. Her legacy gave Voronoff a large income for the rest of his life.

Ten years later, Voronoff married Gerti Schwartz, believed by some to be the illegitimate daughter of King Carol of Romania. She outlived him and became the Condesa da Foz upon Voronoff&#x27;s death.

===Death and burial===
Voronoff died on September 3, 1951, in Lausanne, Switzerland, from complications following a fall. While recovering from a broken leg, Voronoff suffered chest difficulties, thought either to be pneumonia or possibly a blood clot from his leg that moved to his lungs.

Few newspapers ran obituaries, and some of those that did acted as if Voronoff had always been ridiculed for his beliefs. For example, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, once one of his supporters, spelt his name incorrectly and stated that &quot;few took his claims seriously&quot;. On the other hand, &quot;TimesDaily&quot; was more positive, calling him a &quot;famed prononent proponent of rejuvenation for humans through monkey glands&quot; and claiming that he actually became more popular later in life: &quot;Medical authorities at first rejected his theories, but later developments confirmed some of his ideas.&quot;

Voronoff is buried in the Russian section of the Caucade Cemetery in Nice.

==Monkey-gland transplant work==

In the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, trends in xenotransplantation included the work of Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard. In 1889, Brown-Séquard injected himself under the skin with extracts from ground-up dog and guinea pig testicles. These experiments failed to produce the desired results of increased hormonal effects to retard aging.

Voronoff&#x27;s experiments launched from this starting point. He believed glandular transplants would produce more sustained effects than mere injections. Voronoff&#x27;s early experiments in this field included transplanting thyroid glands from chimpanzees to humans with thyroid deficiencies. He moved on to transplanting the testicles of executed criminals into millionaires, but, when demand outstripped supply, he turned to using monkey testicle tissue instead.

In 1917, Voronoff began being funded by Evelyn Bostwick, a wealthy American socialite and the daughter of Jabez Bostwick. The money allowed him to begin transplantation experiments on animals. Bostwick also acted as his laboratory assistant at the Collège de France in Paris, and consequently became the first woman admitted to that institution. They married in 1920.

Between 1917 and 1926, Voronoff carried out over five hundred transplantations on sheep and goats, and also on a bull, grafting testicles from younger animals to older ones. Voronoff&#x27;s observations indicated that the transplantations caused the older animals to regain the vigor of younger animals. He also considered monkey-gland transplantation an effective treatment to counter senility.

His first official transplantation of a monkey gland into a human took place on June 12, 1920. Thin slices (a few millimetres wide) of testicles from chimpanzees and baboons were implanted inside the patient&#x27;s scrotum, the thinness of the tissue samples allowing the foreign tissue to fuse with the human tissue eventually. By 1923, 700 of the world&#x27;s leading surgeons at the International Congress of Surgeons in London, England, applauded the success of Voronoff&#x27;s work in the &quot;rejuvenation&quot; of old men.

In his book &quot;Rejuvenation by Grafting&quot; (1925), Voronoff describes what he believes are some of the potential effects of his surgery. While &quot;not an aphrodisiac&quot;, he admits the sex drive may be improved. Other possible effects include better memory, the ability to work longer hours, the potential for no longer needing glasses (due to improvement of muscles around the eye), and the prolonging of life. Voronoff also speculates that the grafting surgery might be beneficial to people with &quot;dementia praecox&quot;, the mental illness known today as schizophrenia.

Voronoff&#x27;s monkey-gland treatment was in vogue in the 1920s. The poet E. E. Cummings sang of a &quot;famous doctor who inserts monkeyglands in millionaires&quot;, and Chicago surgeon Max Thorek, for whom the Thorek Hospital and Medical Center is named, recalled that soon, &quot;fashionable dinner parties and cracker barrel confabs, as well as sedate gatherings of the medical élite, were alive with the whisper - &#x27;Monkey Glands&#x27;.&quot;

By the early 1930s, over 500 men had been treated in France by his rejuvenation technique (including Voronoff&#x27;s younger brother Georges), and thousands more around the world, such as in a special clinic set up in Algiers. Noteworthy people who had the surgery included Harold McCormick, chairman of the board of International Harvester Company. To cope with the demand for the operation, Voronoff set up his own monkey farm in Ventimiglia, on the Italian Riviera, employing a former circus-animal keeper to run it. French-born U.S. coloratura soprano Lily Pons was a frequent visitor to the farm. With his growing wealth, Voronoff occupied the whole of the first floor of one of Paris&#x27;s most expensive hotels, surrounded by a retinue of chauffeurs, valets, personal secretaries and two mistresses.

Voronoff&#x27;s later work included transplants of monkey ovaries into women. He also tried the reverse experiment, transplanting a human ovary into a female monkey, and then tried to inseminate the monkey with human sperm. The notoriety of this experiment resulted in the novel &quot;Nora, la guenon devenue femme&quot; (&quot;Nora, the Monkey Turned Woman&quot;) by Félicien Champsaur. In 1934, he was the first to officially recognise scientific work done by Greek Professor Skevos Zervos.

===Falling out of favour===
Voronoff&#x27;s experiments ended following pressure from a sceptical scientific community and a change in public opinion. It became clear that Voronoff&#x27;s operations did not produce any of the results he claimed.

In his book &quot;The Monkey Gland Affair&quot;, David Hamilton, an experienced transplant surgeon, discusses how animal tissue inserted into a human would not be absorbed, but instantly rejected. At best, it would result in scar tissue, which might fool a person into believing the graft is still in place. This means the many patients who received the surgery and praised Voronoff were &quot;improved&quot; solely by the placebo effect.

Part of the basis of Voronoff&#x27;s work was that testicles are glands, much like the thyroid and adrenal glands. Voronoff believed that at some point, scientists would discover what substance the testicular glands secrete, making grafting surgery unnecessary.

Eventually, it was determined that the substance emitted by the testicles is testosterone. Voronoff expected that this new discovery would prove his theories. Testosterone would be injected into animals and they would grow young, strong, and virile. Experiments were performed, and this was not the case. Besides an increase in some secondary sexual characteristics, testosterone injections did little. Testosterone did not prolong life, as Voronoff expected. In the 1940s, Kenneth Walker, an eminent British surgeon, dismissed Voronoff&#x27;s treatment as &quot;no better than the methods of witches and magicians.&quot;

In the 1940s, his treatment was widely used by football players at Wolverhampton Wanderers and Portsmouth, although it eventually fell out of favour.

===Reputation and legacy===
By 1935, rejuvenation operations on testes were obsolete. Kozminski and Bloom (2012) wrote that Voronoff&#x27;s experiments were &quot;plagued by secrecy, subjectivity and sensationalism&quot;, adding that the era of testosterone surgery was ended by a &quot;lack of verifiable data&quot;. They write that Voronoff and others can be faulted for &quot;paternalistic use of patients and misogynistic message of testicular power&quot;, but that efforts such as these in the history of urology may have helped fuel medical progress. They conclude that &quot;the boundary between legitimate practice … and the self-interest of chicanery must be abrogated&quot; with medical and regulatory vigilance.

Haber (2004) stated that &quot;Despite increasing doubts about the efficacy of his operation, he continued to perform both human and animal operations to popular acclaim.&quot; In 2005, Kahn stated that the work by Voronoff and others in the 1920s and 1930s therapies that &quot;received widespread [...] ridicule in the popular press, were spread rapidly by practitioners of questionable training and ethical motivation, and finally and relatively quickly disappeared from common use&quot;.

==Popular culture==
As Voronoff&#x27;s work became famous in the 1920s, it began to be featured in popular culture. By 1994, there were calls for a qualified apology from the orthodox medical establishment for dismissing Voronoff&#x27;s work. In 1998, the sweeping popularity of Viagra brought forth references to Voronoff in the popular press. By 2003, Voronoff&#x27;s efforts in the 1920s reached trivia factoid status for newspapers.

&quot;The Adventure of the Creeping Man&quot; is a Sherlock Holmes short story by Arthur Conan Doyle, first published in March 1923 but set in 1903. In the story, an elderly professor is found to be regularity injecting himself with a substance called &quot;extract of langur&quot; for the purpose of rejuvenation. This has unexpected consequences for him.

The song &quot;Monkey-Doodle-Doo&quot;, written by Irving Berlin and featured in the Marx Brothers film &quot;The Coconuts&quot;, contains the line: &quot;If you&#x27;re too old for dancing/Get yourself a monkey gland&quot;. Strange-looking ashtrays depicting monkeys protecting their private parts, with the phrase (translated from French) &quot;No, Voronoff, you won&#x27;t get me!&quot; painted on them began showing up in Parisian homes. At about this same time, a new cocktail containing gin, orange juice, grenadine and absinthe was named The Monkey Gland.

Voronoff was the prototype for Professor Preobrazhensky in Mikhail Bulgakov&#x27;s novel &quot;Heart of a Dog&quot;, published in 1925. In the novel, Preobrazhensky implants human testicles and pituitary gland into a stray dog named Sharik. Sharik then proceeds to become more and more human as time passes, picks himself the name Polygraph Polygraphovich Sharikov, makes himself a career with the &quot;department of the clearing of the city from cats and other vile animals&quot;, and turns the life in the professor&#x27;s house into a nightmare until the professor reverses the procedure.

In his autobiography &quot;A Chef&#x27;s Tale,&quot; Pierre Franey relates how when Voronoff dined at Le Pavillon in the 1940s, waiters would remark how &quot;he looked like a monkey himself, with his exceptionally long fingers and slouching walk. They would laugh at him in the kitchen and imitate his walk for those of us (in the kitchen) who couldn&#x27;t witness it ourselves.&quot;

<text>Albert Herman Woods (born Aladore Herman; January 3, 1870 – April 24, 1951) was an American theatrical producer. He produced over 140 plays on Broadway, including some of the most successful shows of the period, sometimes under the name of the production company Al Woods Ltd. Woods built the Eltinge Theatre on Broadway, named for one of his most successful and profitable stars, the female impersonator Julian Eltinge.

==Early life==
Woods was born in Budapest, Hungary to a Jewish family, but his family brought him to the United States as an infant. He grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. As a child he would skip school to go to theatrical shows, where he developed the goal of becoming a producer himself.

==Career==
Woods formed an early partnership with Sam H. Harris and Paddy Sullivan, running tour companies of popular melodramas, starting with &quot;The Bowery After Dark&quot;. His first Broadway production was &quot;The Evil That Men Do&quot; in 1903. His work on Broadway escalated after the popularity of the touring melodramas declined. Woods had a stable of favorite playwrights, most notably Owen Davis, who he worked with for several years on melodramas such as &quot;Nellie, the Beautiful Cloak Model&quot;. When Woods turned to producing regular Broadway shows, he focused on bedroom farces, starting with &quot;The Girl from Rector&#x27;s&quot; in 1909.

During a trip to Europe in 1911 he bought the US rights to the world&#x27;s first full-color feature film, &quot;The Miracle&quot;. which eventually premiered in New York 1913. Also in 1911 he starting building the Eltinge Theatre on 42nd Street, named after his star, Julian Eltinge. By May 1911 a run of &quot;The Fascinating Widow&quot; starring Eltinge at the Boston Theatre was expected to have receipts of $500,000 by the time it finished.

From c1912 he took over the leases of a large number of Berlin theatres including what became the Ufa-Palast am Zoo, to put on &#x27;Kino-Vaudeville&#x27; shows (a mix of variety acts imported from the US interspersed with silent films). He was also involved with the American millionaire Joe Goldsoll in the building of the German capital&#x27;s first free-standing purpose-built cinema, the Ufa-Pavillon am Nollendorfplatz.&quot;

When he became successful, Woods continued to emphasize his humble roots and was known for his folksy manner with everyone. He greeted patrons at the Eltinge as &quot;sweetheart&quot;. Upon being introduced to King George V, Woods addressed the monarch (who was older than him) as &quot;kid&quot; and took the opportunity to promote one of his productions, declaring it to be &quot;a regular show&quot;.

Woods was at his peak in the 1920s, producing such hits as &quot;Ladies&#x27; Night&quot; (1920), &quot;The Demi-Virgin&quot; (1921), &quot;The Green Hat&quot; (1925), &quot;The Shanghai Gesture&quot; (1926) (filmed in 1941), and &quot;The Trial of Mary Dugan&quot; (1927). However, he lost most of his fortune in the early 1930s and never fully recovered. In the 1930s his only major hits were &quot;Five Star Final&quot; (1930) and &quot;Night of January 16th&quot; (1935). When Woods staged the Sheldon Davis comedy &quot;Try and Get It&quot; in August 1943, critics expressed hope that it would revive his flagging career, but it closed in less than a week. It was his final production.

==Later life==
Although Woods continued to read scripts and attempt to generate interest, he was unable to stage any productions after 1943. He died on April 24, 1951, in his residence at the Hotel Beacon in New York. The once wealthy former producer ended his life bankrupt. After a memorial service attended by many prominent theater personalities, his remains were cremated.

==Censorship battles==
Woods produced a number of bedroom farces, which critics and local authorities often saw as pushing the boundaries of propriety. In several instances Woods encountered legal troubles as a result.

===&quot;The Girl from Rector&#x27;s&quot;===
In 1909, Woods staged &quot;The Girl from Rector&#x27;s&quot;, Paul M. Potter&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Loute&quot;, a French farce by Pierre Veber. The plot portrays several couples in a tangle of adulterous affairs, and the play was considered indecent by many critics. Prior to opening on Broadway, preview performances were scheduled in Trenton, New Jersey. After the first matinee, a group of 25 local clergy complained to Trenton police the play was immoral. The police shut the play down and did not permit any further performances.

===&quot;The Girl with the Whooping Cough&quot;===

In April 1910, Woods began a production of &quot;The Girl with the Whooping Cough&quot;, an adaptation of a French farce that features a woman who spreads whooping cough by kissing numerous men. At the urging New York Mayor William Jay Gaynor, the New York City Police Commissioner attempted to suppress the play due to its risqué content. The commissioner contacted the theater&#x27;s management company and threatened that if the play was not stopped, he would refuse to renew the theater&#x27;s operating license. Woods got an injunction from the New York Supreme Court that prevented the authorities from interfering with the show directly, but it did not compel them to renew the license for the theater. Left with no home for his production, Woods was forced to shut it down.

===&quot;The Demi-Virgin&quot;===
In 1921, Woods again encountered problems with New York City censors when he produced &quot;The Demi-Virgin&quot;, a sex comedy written by Avery Hopwood that featured risque dialog and a strip poker scene. On November 3, 1921, Woods and Hopwood were called to the chambers of William McAdoo, the Chief Magistrate of the New York City&#x27;s magistrates&#x27; court, to respond to complaints about the play. Woods would not make any changes to address the complaints, so McAdoo held a formal hearing and ruled that the play was obscene, describing it as &quot;coarsely indecent, flagrantly and suggestively immoral, impure in word and action.&quot; Woods was placed on bail, and the case was sent to the grand jury for an indictment on a misdemeanor charge of staging an obscene exhibition. The grand jury heard the case on December 23, 1921, but dismissed it that same day, even though it had heard only witnesses favoring the prosecution. As the obscenity case proceeded, the city&#x27;s Commissioner of Licenses threatened to revoke the theater&#x27;s operating license if the production continued, but a New York state appeals court ruled that he did not have the legal authority to revoke a theater license once it had been granted.

Although Woods won the legal proceedings and the play was a hit, it was considered immoral by many critics. Woods was personally condemned by prominent rabbi Stephen S. Wise, who said the involvement of a Jewish producer with &quot;theatrical filth&quot; hurt the reputation of Jews generally.

==Broadway productions==
Woods produced over 140 plays on Broadway.

<text>WLW (700 AM) is a commercial news/talk radio station licensed to Cincinnati, Ohio. Owned by iHeartMedia, WLW is a clear-channel station, often identifying itself as &quot;The Big One&quot;. Its studios are located in Sycamore Township (with a Cincinnati address).

WLW operates with around the clock. The transmitter site features a distinctive diamond-shaped Blaw-Knox tower in nearby Mason. Its daytime signal is heard at city-grade strength as far as Indianapolis, Indiana; Lexington, Kentucky; and Columbus, Ohio, with secondary coverage as far as Louisville and the outer suburbs of Cleveland and Detroit. At night, with a good radio, it can be heard in much of North America.

WLW is a primary entry point station in the Emergency Alert System for Southwest Ohio, Kentucky and Eastern Indiana. Besides its main analog transmission, its programming is simulcast on 99-watt FM translator W233BG on and on an HD digital subchannel of co-owned WKFS.

Launched by industrialist Powel Crosley Jr., WLW became the flagship station of the Crosley Broadcasting Corporation, later a part of Avco. One of four charter affiliates of the Mutual Broadcasting System, WLW holds the distinction of being the only AM radio station authorized by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast with a power of , which happened in the 1930s.

==Programming==
WLW serves as the Cincinnati network affiliate for ABC News Radio; the AM flagship station for the Cincinnati Reds Radio Network; a co-flagship station for the Cincinnati Bengals Radio Network; and the home of radio personalities Mike McConnell, Rocky Boiman and Bill Cunningham.

WLW has a 24-hour local news department and is affiliated with ABC News Radio. The station airs a nearly entirely locally produced talk format. Bill Cunningham hosts a weekday program, and WLW is the flagship station for his &quot;Live on Sunday Night&quot;, which is syndicated by Premiere Networks. Other notable personalities on the station include morning host Mike McConnell, afternoon hosts Eddie Fingers and Rocky Boiman, and evening host Gary Jeff Walker. A one-hour version of &quot;America&#x27;s Trucking Network&quot;, hosted by Eric Boulanger (under the alias of &quot;Bubba Bo&quot;), aired at midnight until Boulanger&#x27;s death in February 2023, followed by &quot;Red Eye Radio&quot;, the station&#x27;s only weekday long-form syndicated offering.

WLW is the flagship radio station for the Cincinnati Reds Radio Network, and also airs Cincinnati Bearcats and Xavier Musketeers college games. WLW also serves as a co-flagship station for the Cincinnati Bengals Radio Network alongside sister stations WCKY and WEBN, airing any games that do not conflict with Reds games. This is primarily to improve coverage of Bengals games at night when WCKY must readjust its signal to protect KFBK in Sacramento. The combined footprints of the two stations allow Bengals night games to be heard across almost all of North America. WLW also will air an FC Cincinnati game, specifically their 2023 MLS Eastern Conference Final game against in-state rivals the Columbus Crew, on December 2, 2023.

==History==
===Origin===
WLW was the outgrowth of an interest in radio by Powel Crosley Jr., although information about his earliest activities is limited. Crosley recounted that his introduction to radio occurred on February 22, 1921, when he took his son to the local Precision Equipment Company store to investigate purchasing a receiver. He was shocked to find that a high-end receiver would cost (equivalent to $ in ), and after assembling his own receiver from parts, he realized that commercial mass production could be done at much lower prices. Starting with individual parts, then moving on to complete receivers, in the 1920s the Crosley Radio Corporation was a leading manufacturer of inexpensive sets, and Powel Crosley became known as &quot;the Henry Ford of radio&quot;.

Crosley was also an early experimenter with making radio transmissions. Most accounts say he began in July 1921, using a 20-watt set located in an upstairs billiard table room, repeatedly playing a phonograph record of &quot;Song of India&quot;, while asking local amateur radio enthusiasts to call if they heard his signals. In 1921 the Crosley Manufacturing Company was issued two radio station licenses: one for a standard amateur station, 8CR, located at 5723 Davey Avenue, which was Crosley&#x27;s College Hill home, and the other for an Experimental station, 8XAA, located at the company&#x27;s Blue Rock Street factory building in Northside.

===WLW===
Initially there were no formal standards for radio stations making broadcasts for the general public, and a variety of stations, most operating under Experimental or Amateur station licenses, conducted broadcasts on a regular schedule. On December 1, 1921, the U.S. Department of Commerce, which regulated radio at this time, adopted the first regulation formally establishing a broadcasting station category, which set aside the wavelength of 360 meters (833 kHz) for entertainment broadcasts, and 485 meters (619 kHz) for market and weather reports.

The Precision Equipment Company was the first in Cincinnati to receive one of the new broadcasting station licenses, when its experimental station, 8XB, was relicensed as WMH on December 30, 1921. The Crosley Manufacturing Company also applied for one of the new licenses, which was granted on March 2, 1922, for operation on the 360-meter &quot;entertainment&quot; wavelength, and issued the randomly assigned call letters of WLW.
WLW made its debut broadcast on March 23, 1922, beginning at 7:15 pm. Station studios and transmitter were located at the Blue Rock Street building. Although the transmitter power was a fairly modest , station publicity boldly predicted that although previously &lt;q&gt;only the smaller type of sending apparatus has been employed in Cincinnati&lt;/q&gt;, &lt;q&gt;The equipment of the Crosley Manufacturing Company is of such great power that the concert emanating from Cincinnati will be heard as far as a distant point in Canada; as far east as the Atlantic Ocean; west as far as the Rocky Mountains, and south to the southernmost tip of the Florida Keys, and possibly to ships in the Gulf of Mexico?&lt;/q&gt; and that &lt;q&gt;This inaugural concert will put Cincinnati &#x27;on the map&#x27; of the radio world.&lt;/q&gt;

The single shared entertainment wavelength of 360 meters meant that stations within a given region had to make timesharing agreements to assign operating timeslots. On August 7, 1922, WLW&#x27;s programs were scheduled from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 pm, while WMH&#x27;s ran from 8:15 p.m. to 10:00 pm. Crosley was a fanatic about the new broadcasting technology, and continually increased his station&#x27;s capability. The power increased to 500 watts in September 1922, and to 1,000 watts in May 1924.

In 1923 Crosley bought the Precision Equipment Company, and in January shut down WMH&#x27;s operations. Precision held the rights to use the valuable Armstrong regeneration patent, and was technically the surviving company in the merger, and was subsequently renamed the Crosley Radio Company.

In May 1923 the Department of Commerce set aside a band of &quot;Class B&quot; frequencies reserved for stations that had quality equipment and programming, and the Cincinnati region was assigned exclusive use of 970 kHz. In the summer WLW began operating on this new frequency, sharing time with another Cincinnati station, WSAI. In May 1924 a third Class B station was established in Cincinnati, WFBW (now WKRC), which the next month revived the WMH call letters. WLW was unhappy with having to split time with two other stations, so in June 1924 government regulators moved WLW to 710 kHz, sharing time with WBAV (now WTVN) in Columbus.

At the Third National Radio Conference, held in October 1924, the Radio Corporation of America&#x27;s (RCA) vice president and general manager, David Sarnoff, announced that his company planned to embark on the construction of a 50,000-watt station for New York City. At this time 1,000 watts was the maximum permitted, so this brought up fears by smaller stations that a group of powerful stations would monopolize the airwaves. However, Powel Crosley fully endorsed the idea, stating: &quot;Our idea of the solution to the static problem is increase in power. We talk today of 5,000 watts being superpower, when we all know that five years from now certain broadcasting stations will be using from 50 to 200 kilowatts. When that day comes, there will be no more static.&quot;

In late 1924 Western Electric began selling radio transmitters capable of operating at 5,000 watts, but the Commerce Department, wary of the high-powered sets overwhelming local receivers, did not immediately allow stations to use the full power. Instead stations could start operating with up to 1,500 watts, then, only if approved by the region&#x27;s Radio Supervisor, increase powers in successive 500-watt steps, while ensuring that it was not causing excessive interference. WLW ordered one of the 5,000-watt-capable Western Electric transmitters, originally hoping to have it in operation by the end of December. In addition, a new remote transmitter site was constructed at Harrison, Ohio, located away from the city to limit the possibility of the station&#x27;s signals overwhelming local receivers. On January 27, 1925, WLW began using its 5,000-watt-capable transmitter, although not yet at full power.

The Commerce Department&#x27;s cautious approach toward power increases was based on the assumption that station transmitters were located in heavily populated areas. However, in May 1925 it recognized that WLW&#x27;s Harrison and WSAI&#x27;s Mason, Ohio transmitter sites were both far enough from population centers that they could immediately begin operating as the first two stations in the nation transmitting with the full 5,000 watts. A &quot;Cincinnati Post&quot; writer investigated the effect of WSAI and WLW&#x27;s May 11 introduction of the use of 5,000 watts, and found that despite claims that their &quot;superpower broadcasting&quot; would eliminate static within 500 miles, it was only &quot;a start in the right direction&quot;. Listeners reported that the stations now sounded about twice as strong, and also noted that KDKA in Pittsburgh&#x27;s 10,000 watts was even better.

Shortly after WLW began operating with 5,000 watts, the major radio manufacturers began work on producing more powerful transmitters. Development was led by General Electric, and in July 1925 that company&#x27;s WGY in Schenectady, New York began conducting tests of a 50,000-watt transmitter, which began regular usage later that year.

===&quot;The Nation&#x27;s Station&quot;===

By the summer of 1928, in addition to WGY, WEAF (now WFAN) in New York City and KDKA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania were also broadcasting with 50,000 watts, and WLW was making plans to join them.

In May Crosley purchased WSAI, and began to consolidate the two station&#x27;s operations. This included WLW moving its transmitter site from Harrison to sharing WSAI&#x27;s facility at Mason. There is where WLW&#x27;s 50,000-watt Western Electric transmitter would be installed, with its completion initially hoped to be by September. It was actually October 29, 1928, when WLW became the fourth member of the select group of U.S. stations operating with 50,000 watts. However, at the dedication ceremonies the station proclaimed that, because WLW was more centrally located than the other 50,000 watt stations, it was &quot;America&#x27;s &quot;first&quot; really national Broadcasting station&quot;, with a signal that &quot;cut through static like a knife&quot;. In early 1929 Crosley company advertising began referring to WLW using the slogan &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Station&quot;. The station even branched out into international service, including a weekly program in Spanish which was intended for listeners in Cuba.

In 1926, there had been a temporary suspension of government regulation of radio due to a court ruling that the Commerce Department had overstepped its legal authority. This eventually resulted in the formation of the Federal Radio Commission (FRC), which as part of its re-establishment of control moved WLW to 700 kHz in June 1927, the frequency on which it has operated ever since. In November 1928, under the provisions of the FRC&#x27;s General Order 40, 700 kHz was one of 40 frequencies designated as &quot;clear channels&quot;, and WLW was assigned exclusive use of this frequency within the United States and Canada.

At 50 kilowatts, WLW was heard easily over a wide area from New York to Florida, but Crosley still was not satisfied. In early 1933, it was announced that RCA had been awarded a contract to oversee the construction of a 500,000-watt transmitter, &quot;the largest broadcasting transmitter in the world&quot;, although initially it would only be operated during the hours of 1 to 6 am.

===500,000-watt &quot;superpower&quot; operation===
Crosley obtained a construction permit from the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) for the addition of a 500-kilowatt transmitter amplifier at the Mason complex, and spent some $500,000 ($ in 2025) constructing the equipment and facilities for the new amplifier and installation of an tall antenna.

In January 1934, WLW began broadcasting with 500,000 watts after midnight under the experimental call sign W8XO. In April 1934 the station was authorized to operate at 500,000 watts during regular hours using the WLW call letters. On May 2, 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ceremonially pressed the same golden telegraph key that Wilson had used to open the Panama Canal, officially launching WLW&#x27;s 500-kilowatt signal.

As the first station in the world to broadcast at this strength, WLW received numerous complaints from around the United States and Canada that it was interfering with other stations, most notably from CFRB, then on 690 kHz, in Toronto, Ontario. In December 1934, WLW was instructed to cut back to 50 kilowatts at night until it had eliminated the interference. The station began construction of two shorter towers southwest from the main tower to create a directional antenna, which successfully reduced the signal broadcast towards Canada. With these antenna towers in place, full-time broadcasting at 500 kilowatts resumed in early 1935. However, WLW was continuing to operate under special temporary authority that had to be renewed every six months; each renewal brought complaints about interference, and undue domination of the market by the high-powered station.

In September 1934, WLW was one of the founding members of the Mutual Broadcasting System, although it withdrew as a primary participant and became a regular affiliate two years later. The station found that with its tremendous signal it could independently compete with the national radio networks, with a rate card comparable to what the major networks charged. One result was that by 1936 there was increasing pressure on the FCC to start allowing additional clear channel stations to operate with 500,000 watts, and in October there were a reported 14 outstanding applicants to join the &quot;superpower&quot; ranks.

In 1928 the FRC&#x27;s General Order 40 had established the basic structure of the AM broadcast band in the United States, grouping transmitting frequencies into three major categories: &quot;local&quot;, limited to 100 watts, &quot;regional&quot;, with up to 1,000 watts, and &quot;clear&quot;, with an unspecified limit that was generally capped at 50,000 watts the next month by General Order 42. Over time the maximum daytime powers were increased to 250 watts for local stations, and 5,000 watts for regional ones.

In June 1938 the FCC held a series of hearings on the future of the AM band, including power levels. An important factor in their deliberations was the &quot;Wheeler resolution&quot;. On June 13, 1938, the U.S. Senate adopted resolution 294, sponsored by Burton K. Wheeler (D-Montana), which stated that it was the &quot;sense of the Senate... that the Federal Communications Commission should not adopt or promulgate rules to permit or otherwise allow any station operating on a frequency in the standard broadcast band (550 to 1600 kilocycles) to operate on a regular or other basis with power in excess of 50 kilowatts&quot;. Wheeler, an avid anti-monopolist who wanted to protect the smaller stations, was also concerned that domination of the airwaves by high-powered stations could lead to a dictator like Mussolini, Hitler or Stalin, who had each used control of radio to support their rise to power.

This resolution, unlike a law, was not binding on the FCC; however it was seen as having an important influence on the outcome of its hearings. In early 1939 the FCC announced its new regulations, which narrowed the differences between low and high-powered stations. Local stations could now use up to 250 watts at night, and regional 5,000 watts. On the other hand, in language that largely echoed the financial arguments of the Wheeler resolution, clear channel stations were still limited to 50,000 watts, and WLW&#x27;s temporary authorization to use 500,000 watts, except experimentally during early morning hours, was terminated.

===Return to 50,000 watts===

Beginning in 1939, WLW used the overnight hours to transmit READO radiofax newspapers. However, the system was unable to compete with standard newspaper delivery, and was shut down a few years later.
On March 1, 1939, WLW resumed operations at 50,000 watts. The station had unsuccessfully attempted to reverse the decision in the courts, and now had to shut down the huge amplifiers, except for brief, experimental night periods as W8XO. Because of the impending war, and the possible need for national broadcasting in an emergency, the W8XO experimental license for 500 kilowatts remained in effect until December 29, 1942.

In the 1930s, WLW occupied the entire 48th floor of Carew Tower. In 1942, the station moved its studios into the Crosley Square building, a converted Elks Lodge No. 5 in downtown Cincinnati. WLW&#x27;s sister television station, WLWT (then branded WLW-T), was founded in the same building. In 1955, WLW and WLWT became the first radio and television station to own a weather radar.

A major promotion of the station in the 1940s was the Boone County Jamboree. A 1942 advertisement in the trade publication &quot;Billboard&quot; noted: &quot;WLW Boone County Jamboree acts played to 169,406 persons, July 4 to October 4. An all time record of 63 bookings in seven States. New attendance records established at 14 events.&quot;. The Jamboree featured a number of country music performers who later became iconic and a few who entered the Country Music Hall of Fame. Among these were Grandpa Jones, Merle Travis and The Delmore Brothers. Other significant artists who worked there were Joe Maphis, Hank Penny, Smiley Burnette, Lazy Jim Day and Shug Fisher.

The August 1941 adoption of the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s &quot;duopoly&quot; rule restricted licensees from operating more than one radio station in a given market. At this time the Crosley Corporation owned both WLW and WSAI, so to conform with the new regulation in 1944 WSAI was sold to Marshall Field. The next year Crosley sold WLW to the Aviation Corporation of the Americas (Avco), earning a handsome return on his original investment of a quarter-century earlier. The Crosley name was so well respected that Avco retained it as the name of its broadcast division until 1968.

From the 1950s until the 1970s, broadcasts for WLW were moved across Elm street to the COMEX building, where people could watch radio broadcasts from the sidewalk through plate glass windows.

By 1962 there were only 13 unduplicated clear channel frequencies left in the United States, and the FCC was investigating whether to &quot;break up&quot; these remaining frequencies by adding secondary stations. In response the U.S. House of Representatives passed House Resolution 714, which gave support to having the frequencies remain assigned exclusively to a single station, and a number of the stations, calling themselves the &quot;Clear Channel Broadcasting Service&quot;, applied for higher powers. This included WLW, which submitted an application to operate with 750 kilowatts. However, the FCC denied these applications and went ahead with the additional stations, located mostly in under-served western states. Despite no longer being the sole occupant of 700 kHz, WLW&#x27;s signal still sometimes spanned impressive distances, and in 1985 overnight host Dale Sommers received a call from a listener in Hawaii. Reception at the United States Air Force&#x27;s Thule Air Base in Greenland (4,235 km) has been reported as sufficiently good for routine listening with an ordinary commercial AM-FM radio receiver at night during the Arctic winter.

Avco began exiting broadcasting in 1975. WLW was one of the last properties to be sold in 1976. From that point until the 1990s, WLW had different owners, including Queen City Communications, Mariner Communications, Seven Hills Broadcasting and Jacor Communications, before Jacor merged with Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia). The Clear Channel merger made WLW a sister station to Cincinnati&#x27;s other 50,000-watt &quot;flamethrower&quot;, WCKY. The latter station had been licensed to Covington, Kentucky (hence its callsign), for much of the early part of its history, a quirk that allowed it to get a clear-channel designation despite WLW&#x27;s presence.

From the late 1970s to 1989, WLW&#x27;s studios were located downtown at 3 East 4th Street, now the site of the National City Bank (now PNC) Tower in downtown Cincinnati. From 1989 to 2005, WLW was located in Mt. Adams, a trendy neighborhood overlooking downtown. The address remained 1111 St. Gregory Street. WLW was originally on the fourth floor, where it shared studios with sister station WEBN. In 1990, the station began broadcasting in AM stereo using the C-QUAM system. In 1992, as Jacor started to consolidate stations, the fifth floor was taken over by the human resources and traffic departments, along with new studios for 550 WLWA, formerly WKRC. In 1995, Jacor moved all of its stations into the Mt. Adams facility, leasing the entire building. In February 1999, the station turned off the AM stereo system.

A Bell 47G traffic helicopter leased by the station was severely damaged in an emergency landing at Maketewah Country Club on May 20, 1982, that injured the pilot and reporter Bill Beahr.

Along with other Clear Channel talk stations, WLW switched from ABC News Radio to Fox News Radio. However, on June 26, 2006, a realignment of network affiliations by Clear Channel&#x27;s Cincinnati AM stations reunited WLW with ABC News Radio. (WKRC picked up Fox News Radio, while WCKY took CBS Radio). Not included in the rearrangement was ABC Radio commentator Paul Harvey. WLW continued to carry Harvey&#x27;s commentaries through all the changes, although after extended absences, Harvey was dropped by WLW in April 2008.

WLW eventually stopped calling itself &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Station&quot; and adopted the slogan &quot;The Big One&quot;. For a time in the early 1960s, it also called itself the &quot;World&#x27;s Highest Fidelity Radio Station&quot;.

Although Crosley also owned the Cincinnati Reds along with WLW from 1934 to 1945, WLW did not become the Reds&#x27; flagship station until 1969, a status it has retained ever since. Over the years, WLW has also been the flagship for Cincinnati Bengals football, University of Cincinnati football and basketball, Xavier University basketball, and the games of the Cincinnati Royals (now the Sacramento Kings) of the National Basketball Association.

In 2013, WLW purchased an FM translator from Northern Kentucky University to be used for simulcasting, and moved it to Port Union, Ohio. The station is W233BG on 94.5, operating at 120 watts. This would later be moved to Cincinnati, drop power to 99 watts, and switch to repeating WKFS-HD2.

Until 2015, WLW was also associated with Raycom Media&#x27;s WXIX-TV.

===XM Radio simulcast===
From March 1, 2006, to March 6, 2009, WLW was simulcast on XM Satellite Radio channel 173, expanding the station coverage to the entire continental United States. Excluded from the simulcast was Cincinnati Bengals play-by-play coverage, as the station did not own the national rights. However, college sport play-by-play from the Xavier Musketeers and the Cincinnati Bearcats was carried, as were Cincinnati Reds games (XM had purchased the rights to Major League Baseball separately). The station was placed on the satellites by then Clear Channel programming executive Sean Compton (brother of WLW overnight personality Steve Sommers, whose program continues to be broadcast on the platform), who claimed WLW was his favorite radio station. Compton left the company in 2008 for the Tribune Company, and shortly thereafter WLW was dropped from XM.

==Shortwave operations==
In 1925 Crosley received a license for an experimental shortwave station, 8XAL (W8XAL after 1928). In August 1926 the company announced that it was planning to establish a shortwave link to relay programs from Cincinnati for retransmission by a newly acquired station, WARC, located near Boston, Massachusetts, however this link was never implemented.

In 1926 8XAL was on air with 100 watts, which increased to 10,000 watts in 1931. In 1940 the station was relicensed as a commercial station, with the callsign WLWO. In early 1941 it was operating with 75 kilowatts, with a program service particularly aimed at South America, and was known as &quot;The Inter-Nation Station&quot;.

The station transmitted on 5.69 MHz from 1924 to 1929 and 6.06 MHz (June 1929 November 1, 1942). In 1941, operations were described as &quot;the only international station in the United States authorized to operate on each of the six short-wave bands with unlimited frequencies and unlimited time. WLWO&#x27;s assigned frequencies are: 6.08, 9.59, 11.71, 15.25, 17.80 and 21.65 megs&quot;, with programs in English, Spanish and Portuguese. In 1943, Crosley engineers built the U.S. government&#x27;s Bethany shortwave transmitter site, which was later taken over by the Voice of America.

==Mason, Ohio transmitter site==

WLW&#x27;s distinctive diamond-shaped antenna is featured on the official seal of the city of Mason. Designed and erected by Blaw-Knox Tower company in 1934, it was the second of its type to be built, after WSM&#x27;s in Nashville, Tennessee, and is one of eight still operational in the United States.

WLW&#x27;s 500,000-watt &quot;RCA 1&quot; transmitter was in operation between 1934 and 1939, and was the highest power ever used in the United States for public, domestic radio broadcasting. It was designed as an amplifier of the regular 50 kW transmitter. It operated in class C with high-level plate modulation, and required two dedicated 33 kilovolt electrical substation lines and a large cooling pond complete with spray fountains. It operated with a power input of about 750 kW (plus another 400 kW of audio for the modulator) to produce 500 kW. Even after 1939, when regular WLW programming was prohibited from operating with more than 50,000 watts, the station continued post-midnight high-powered operation as experimental station W8XO, which helped to greatly improve the RCA 1 transmitter&#x27;s power and reliability. By the end of World War II, it was capable of producing one million watts, and it &quot;loafed along&quot; at 600 kW.

WLW&#x27;s 500,000-watt authorization included the requirement that the station limit its nighttime skywave signal toward Canada to the equivalent of 50,000 watts, which led to the construction of two shorter towers, electrically a quarter wavelength in height and separated by a half wavelength, that were located southwest of the main tower. The two shorter towers were fed using trolley car wire to produce an 85 kW signal at 96 degrees out-of-phase with the principal signal, which produced a null in the opposite direction from the main tower.

Many reports have surfaced over the years, from those who lived near the 500-kilowatt transmitter, of power fluctuations. Residents would see their lights flicker in time to the modulation peaks of the transmitter. It was widely reported that the signal was so overpowering that some people picked up WLW radio on the metal coils of mattresses and boxed bedsprings, but those reports have been assessed as possible urban legends. Arcing often occurred near the transmission site.

Even though WLW was now using ten times the power, listeners subjectively said it only sounded two or three times louder than before. One important factor affecting long-distance nighttime coverage was that the power upgrade included a switch from a horizontal &quot;flattop&quot; antenna to a vertical tower, which significantly helped the local &quot;groundwave&quot; coverage, at the expense of reducing the increase in distant &quot;skywave&quot; signals. Even so, one listener remembered being able to easily pick up WLW&#x27;s nighttime signal away in Denver, Colorado. Another issue was that some of the earliest towers like WLW&#x27;s were being built too tall, which at night caused cancellation issues where the groundwave and skywave signals interfered with each other causing excessive fading. Because of this, WLW&#x27;s tower, originally at , was reduced to .

In October 1940 a suspicious fire broke out in the WLWO tuning house, which led to an increase in security, and in early 1941 it was reported that &quot;Today you would have little chance of getting close enough to the equipment to do any damage, for out at Mason, Ohio, where the transmitters of WLW and WLWO are located, a special guardhouse high has been built, a high metal fence encloses the grounds which are patrolled by a staff of twelve guards twenty-four hours out of each day, and a battery of floodlights illuminates every foot of the grounds day and night.&quot;

The station&#x27;s original 50 kW 1927 Western Electric 7a transmitter was reactivated on the night of December 31, 1999, when it was powered up and used from 10:45 p.m. until 12:15 a.m. at the start of the next year. Chief Engineer Paul Jellison replaced a bad vacuum tube, and successfully operated the water-cooled equipment, which he noted was quieter than the newer transmitters cooled by air blowers. The transmitter output was fed through a modern Orban 9100 audio processor, and Jellison reported that it &quot;sounded fine and the news department mentioned the fact that we were operating on it in their news casts&quot;.

==Former on-air staff==
The station claims many well-known alumni, including: Jack Berch, Mary Jane Croft, Merle Travis, Doris Day, Rosemary Clooney, Ruth Lyons, Bob Braun, Wally Phillips, Jean Shepherd, Frazier Thomas, NBC sportscasters Cris Collinsworth and Al Michaels, &quot;Sportstalk&quot; host Bob Trumpy, Dale Sommers (better known as the &quot;Truckin&#x27; Bozo&quot; and whose son Steve Sommers continued to hold the overnight slot until he was fired in late 2020), J. R. Gach, Gary Burbank (comedy talk host, impressionist, and creator of the nationally syndicated Earl Pitts monologues), former program director and personality Darryl Parks and former Clear Channel radio CEO Randy Michaels. Rod Serling, the creator of the classic TV series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, worked for WLW from 1947 to 1948 producing historical documentaries, community profiles and commercials, before leaving to pursue other opportunities in the broadcasting industry. Bill Nimmo, who later served as Johnny Carson&#x27;s sidekick on the show &quot;Who Do You Trust?&quot; and its predecessor &quot;Do You Trust Your Wife?&quot;, also worked at WLW beginning in 1947.

<text>William Henry Wright (21 April 1876 – 20 September 1951) was a Canadian prospector.

In 1911, he discovered the Kirkland Lake Break, which hosted seven gold-producing mines. He used the proceeds from his gold finds to launch a national newspaper in Canada, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;.

==Early life==
Wright was born in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, England. As a teenager, he worked as a butcher&#x27;s apprentice. In 1897, he joined the British army and served both at home and in the colonies. He served through the Second Boer War and survived the siege of Ladysmith.

After the war he came into the possession of a Veteran&#x27;s Lot in the Porcupine area of Ontario. As Pain points out, &quot;The proverbial luck of the British Army was with him.&quot; This lot was later sold by Wright to the Buffalo-Ankerite Mine for reaping him a hefty profit. This in addition to his later discovery of free gold along the Main Break quartz vein in 1911, though &quot;he knew nothing of mining or geology.&quot;

In 1907, Wright moved to Canada joining his sister, Frances Wright, and her husband, Edward Hargreaves, a master butcher in northern Ontario. The three of them went to Cobalt, Ontario in search of work. Wright and Hargreaves worked at a variety of odd jobs before attempting prospecting. They started in Cobalt, then went on to Porcupine, and finally to Kirkland Lake.

==The discovery==
One evening in July 1911, Hargreaves became lost while hunting for rabbits. He fired a shot to attract the Wrights&#x27; attention. Wright walked towards Hargreaves and stumbled across a quartz outcrop. It was almost dusk, but he could see free gold in reddish feldspar porphyry. The next day, they staked three claims, two of which turned out to be directly on the fault line of the area. The partners staked more claims over the following weeks. This initial discovery was the first rich find that established the Kirkland Lake camp.

Soon after the claims were made, the partnership ended. Hargreaves needed to support his wife, so he sold his interest in the claims. Wright was single. He held onto his interest, despite a lack of funds and harsh conditions. He was determined to hold and work the claims.

The ground staked by Wright and Hargreaves eventually became three mines: Sylvanite, Lakeshore and Wright-Hargreaves. The gold extracted from these three mines totaled 13.5 million ounces. Wright had sold the claims that became Sylvanite to Harry Oakes in exchange for Lakeshore property, shares in the mine and a vice-presidency. The mine for which Wright is best known is the one that bears his name, the Wright Hargreaves.

==World War I==
In 1916, Wright felt the need to support the Allies in World War I. Though he was a millionaire and almost forty years old, he joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force as a private. According to Pain, Wright &quot;must have been the wealthiest private in the Army.&quot; He remained a private throughout the war, though he had to turn down the opportunity of promotion several times.

==Post-war career==
After the war, he focused on the Wright-Hargreaves mine. He became vice-president of the Lake Shore and Wright-Hargreaves companies. It operated from 1921 to 1965 and was one of Canada&#x27;s premier gold mines. The profits from this mine were used to build a major mining company with interests across Canada.

In 1936, Wright was approached by George McCullagh with the idea of acquiring two Toronto newspapers, &quot;The Globe&quot; and &quot;The Mail and Empire&quot;, and merging them. Wright went along with the plan and founded &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, which became Canada&#x27;s national newspaper. Until it moved to its current location in the early 1970s, The Globe and Mail was published in the art deco William H. Wright Building at 140 King St. W. in Toronto&#x27;s financial district, since demolished.

In his later years, Wright lived in Barrie, Ontario, performed community work and raised horses. He was the breeder of Archworth, winner of the 1939 King&#x27;s Plate. McCullagh, who had purchased the horse from Wright as a yearling, said, &quot;It&#x27;s a great day for me, but I am only the stuffed shirt who bought him for $500. My thrill is nothing at all compared to the joy in Bill Wright&#x27;s heart. It&#x27;s been a lifelong dream. When he came to this country from England he used to watch the races at Woodbine from a knothole in the fence. Standing there, he vowed that if he ever struck it rich, he would try to breed a winner of the Plate. The dream came true today.&quot;

<doc id="766070" wikidata="Q232588" url="?curid=766070" title="Miyoshi Umeki">
<text>was a Japanese American singer and actress. Umeki was nominated for the Tony Award and Golden Globe Award and was the first East Asia-born woman to win an Academy Award for acting.

==Life==
Born in Otaru, Hokkaido, she was the youngest of nine children. Her father owned an iron factory. After World War II, Umeki began her career as a nightclub singer in Japan, using the name Nancy Umeki. Her early influences were traditional kabuki theater and American pop music. Later in one of her appearances on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, she treated viewers to her impression of singer Billy Eckstine, one of her American favorites growing up.

==Career==

She was best known for her Oscar-winning role as Katsumi in &quot;Sayonara&quot; (1957), as Mei Li in both the Broadway musical and 1961 film &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;, and as Mrs. Livingston in the television series &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot;. She was a shin Issei, or post-1945 immigrant from Japan.

She recorded for RCA Victor Japan from 1950 to 1954 and appeared in the film &quot;Seishun Jazu Musume&quot;. She recorded mostly American jazz standards, which she sang partially in Japanese and partially in English, or solely in either language. Some of the songs she sang during this period were &quot;It Isn&#x27;t Fair&quot;, &quot;Sentimental Me&quot;, &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot;, &quot;With A Song In My Heart&quot;, &quot;Again&quot;, &quot;Vaya con Dios&quot;, &quot;(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Walk Alone&quot;. She moved to the United States in 1955. After appearing on the &quot;Arthur Godfrey Talent Scouts&quot; (she was a series regular for one season), she signed with the Mercury Records label and released several singles and two albums. Her appearances on Godfrey&#x27;s program brought her to the attention of director Joshua Logan, who cast her in &quot;Sayonara&quot;, for which she won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She was the first Asian to win an Academy Award for acting.

In 1958, she appeared twice on the variety show &quot;The Gisele MacKenzie Show&quot; in which she performed &quot;How Deep Is the Ocean&quot;. That same year, she was also nominated for a Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical for her performance in the Broadway premiere production of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;, where she played Mei Li. The show was directed by Gene Kelly and ran for two years. A cover story in &quot;Time&quot; stated &quot;the warmth of her art works a kind of tranquil magic&quot;. Umeki appeared in Universal Studios&#x27; film adaptation of the musical in 1961. She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;. Although a guest on many television variety shows, she appeared in only three more movies through 1962, including &quot;Cry for Happy&quot; (also 1961), &quot;The Horizontal Lieutenant&quot; (1962), and &quot;A Girl Named Tamiko&quot; (1963). From 1969 to 1972, she appeared in &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot; as Mrs. Livingston the housekeeper, for which she was nominated for another Golden Globe Award. She retired from acting following the end of the series.

==Personal life and death==
Her first marriage, to television director Frederick Winfield &quot;Wynn&quot; Opie in 1958, ended in divorce in 1967. The couple had one son, Michael H. Opie, born in 1964. She married Randall Firevod Hood in 1968, and he adopted her son, changing the boy’s name to Michael Randall Hood (February 11, 1964 – August 27, 2018). The couple operated a Los Angeles–based business renting editing equipment to film studios and university film programs. Randall Hood died in 1976. Her son, Michael Hood, was a police sergeant. 

According to Umeki&#x27;s son (who died 11 years after his mother), Umeki lived in Sherman Oaks, California for a number of years, then moved to Licking, Missouri to be near her son and his family, which included three grandchildren. Known as Miyoshi Hood, she died there on August 28, 2007, aged 78, from cancer.

<doc id="766071" wikidata="Q419379" url="?curid=766071" title="Magnesium peroxide">
<text>Magnesium peroxide (MgO2) is an odorless fine powder peroxide with a white to off-white color. It is similar to calcium peroxide because magnesium peroxide also releases oxygen by breaking down at a controlled rate with water. Commercially, magnesium peroxide often exists as a compound of magnesium peroxide and magnesium hydroxide.

==Structure==

O2, similarly to N2, has the ability to bind either side-on or end-on. The structure of MgO2 has been calculated as a triangular shape with the O2 molecule binding side-on to the magnesium. This arrangement is a result of the Mg+ donating charge to the oxygen and creating a Mg2+O22−. The bond between to O2 and the magnesium atom has an approximate dissociation energy of 90 kJ mol−1.

In the solid state, MgO2 has a cubic pyrite-type crystal structure with 6-coordinate Mg2+ ions and O22− peroxide-groups, according to experimental data and evolutionary crystal structure prediction, the latter predicting a phase transition at the pressure of 53 GPa to a tetragonal structure with 8-coordinate Mg2+ ions. While at normal conditions MgO2 is a metastable compound (less stable than ), at pressures above 116 GPa it is predicted to become thermodynamically stable in the tetragonal phase. This theoretical prediction has been experimentally confirmed via synthesis in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell.

==Synthesis==

MgO2 can be produced by mixing MgO with hydrogen peroxide to create magnesium peroxide and water. This being an exothermic reaction should be cooled and kept around 30–40 degrees Celsius. It is also important to remove as much iron from the reaction environment as possible due to iron&#x27;s ability to catalyze the degradation of the peroxide. The addition of oxygen stabilizers such as sodium silicate can also be used to help prevent the premature degradation of the peroxide. Regardless, a good yield from this reaction is only about 35%.

High yields are further complicated by the fact that MgO2 reacts with water to degrade the peroxide into magnesium hydroxide, also known as milk of magnesia.

==Applications==

Magnesium peroxide is a stable oxygen releasing compound, which is used in agricultural and environmental industries. It is used to reduce contaminant levels in groundwater. Magnesium peroxide is used in the bioremediation of contaminated soil and can improve the soil quality for plant growth and metabolism. It is also used in the aquaculture industry for bioremediation.

For sanitation purposes magnesium peroxide is often used as a source of oxygen for aerobic organisms in the treatment and disposal of biological waste. Since the breakdown of hydrocarbons in soil is usually quicker in aerobic conditions, MgO2 can also be added to compost piles or in soil to speed up the microbe activities and to reduce the odors produced in the process.

In certain circumstances MgO2 has also been shown to inhibit growth of bacteria. In particular, the growth of sulfate-reducing bacteria can be inhibited in an environment containing magnesium peroxide. While the oxygen slowly dissociates, it is theorized that it may then act to displace the sulfate that normally acts as the terminal electron acceptor in their electron transport chain.

==Toxicity==

Magnesium peroxide is an irritant that can cause redness, itching, swelling, and may burn the skin and eyes on contact. Inhalation can also cause irritation to the lungs, nose, and throat, as well as causing coughing. Long term exposure may lead to lung damage, shortness of breath, and tightening of the chest. Ingestion of MgO2 can cause numerous adverse effects including: bloating, belching, abdominal pain, irritation of the mouth and throat, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

Environmentally, magnesium peroxide is not a naturally occurring compound and is not known to persist in the environment for prolonged times, in its complete state, or to bio-accumulate. The natural degradation of MgO2 leads to magnesium hydroxide, O2, and H2O. If spilled, MgO2 should be contained and isolated from any waterways, sewer drains, and it should be isolated from combustible materials or chemicals including paper, cloth, and wood.

==Common Environmental Reactions==

Magnesium exists in the upper atmosphere in a variety of different molecular forms. Due to its ability to react with common oxygen and simple carbon-oxygen compounds the magnesium may exist in oxidized compounds including MgO2, OMgO2, MgO, and O2MgO2.

: MgCO3 + O → MgO2 + CO2
: OMgO2 + O → MgO2 + O2
: MgO + O3 → MgO2 + O2
: MgO2 + O2 → O2MgO2
: MgO2 + O → MgO + O2

In contact with water it decomposes by the reactions:

: MgO2 + 2 H2O → Mg(OH)2 + H2O2

: 2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2

<text>John William Wright Patman (August 6, 1893 – March 7, 1976) was an American politician. First elected in 1928, Patman served 24 consecutive terms in the United States House of Representatives for Texas&#x27;s 1st congressional district from 1929 to 1976. He was a member of the Democratic Party. From 1973 to 1976, he was Dean of the United States House of Representatives.

Patman grew up in Hughes Springs, Texas. After graduating from Cumberland University, Patman returned to Hughes Springs to be a lawyer. From 1916 to 1917, Patman held his first political office as assistant county attorney for Cass County, Texas. He then served in the United States Army during World War I from 1917 to 1919. After the war, Patman was elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1920. Patman served two terms in the Texas House before serving as a district attorney in Texas from 1924 to 1929.

In Congress, Patman was a fiscal watchdog who challenged practices of major banks and the Federal Reserve. He co-sponsored the Robinson-Patman Act of 1935, which was designed to protect small retail shops against competition from chain stores by fixing a minimum price for retail products. From 1963 to 1975, Patman chaired the United States House Committee on Banking and Currency. Patman served in Congress until his death in 1976. His son Bill Patman later served in a different U.S. House seat in Texas from 1981 to 1985.

Patman was the son of John N. and Emma (Spurlin) Patman, born near Hughes Springs in Cass County, Texas, on August 6, 1893. After graduating from Hughes Springs High School in 1912, he enrolled in Cumberland University Law School in Lebanon, Tennessee. Receiving his law degree in 1916 he was admitted to the Texas bar the same year. During World War I Patman enlisted in the United States Army as a private. He later received a commission as a first lieutenant and machine gun officer in the Texas Army National Guard&#x27;s 144th Infantry Regiment, a unit of the 36th Division. He remained in the National Guard for several years after the war.

==Political career==
===Early political career===
Patman was elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1920. He left the House in 1924 when he was appointed district attorney of the fifth judicial district of Texas.

===Early Congressional career===

In 1928, Patman was elected to the House of Representatives from Texas&#x27;s 1st congressional district. In 1932, Patman introduced a bill that would have mandated the immediate payment of the bonus to World War I veterans. It was during the consideration of this bill that the Bonus Army came to Washington. Patman was a supporter of the New Deal.

In January 1932, Patman spearheaded a movement to impeach Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, which forced the latter&#x27;s resignation the following month.

In 1935, Patman took on the cause of independent retailers, who were engaged in a nationwide battle to stop the growth of chain retailing by taxing chains and restricting their business practices. Patman in the House and Joseph Taylor Robinson in the United States Senate were the sponsors of the 1936 Robinson-Patman Act, an effort to preserve independent wholesalers and retail outlets (&quot;Mom and Pop stores&quot;) by preventing manufacturers or large retailers from becoming involved in wholesaling.

Patman was one of four members of the Texas congressional delegation to originally sign the &quot;Southern Manifesto,&quot; a resolution in protest of the United States Supreme Court decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. Pathman voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968 as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

===Watergate inquiry===

Wright Patman&#x27;s namesake committee played an important role in the early days of the Watergate scandal that eventually brought down the Nixon Administration.

The Patman Committee investigated the hundred dollar bills found on the Watergate &quot;plumbers&quot; upon their arrest, suspecting they could directly link them to CREEP, the president&#x27;s re-election committee. The Patman Committee&#x27;s 1972 investigation was stymied by pressure from the White House, in part aided by Congressman Gerald R. Ford. Despite these efforts to stop Patman, his investigative course ultimately proved to be Nixon&#x27;s undoing in the sense that the money trail, as reported on in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, helped lead to the establishment of the Ervin Senate Select Committee on Watergate in April 1973.

===Loss of chairmanship===
In 1975, Patman was voted out of his position as Chairman of the Banking committee by younger Congressmen, in a revolt against the &#x27;Seniority system&#x27; which also removed Felix Edward Hébert and William R. Poage from their positions as chairmen. Patman was replaced by Henry S. Reuss by a caucus vote of 152–117. The main reason given for the caucus removing Patman was concern about his age and effectiveness.

==Personal life==
In 1919, Patman married Merle Connor, who died in 1967. They had four children, including Bill Patman, who served in the U.S. House from 1981 to 1985. Wright Patman remarried in 1968 to Pauline Tucker.

Patman died of pneumonia in Bethesda, Maryland on March 7, 1976. He was buried at Hillcrest Cemetery in Texarkana. &quot;His funeral in Texarkana was one of the largest, most important occurrences in the town&#x27;s history,&quot; wrote Mark Stanley in a 2004 essay for the &quot;East Texas Historical Journal&quot;.

==Legacy==
Patman is regarded as a liberal and populist who brought federal jobs and works projects to his district, where agriculture previously was the dominant economic sector. However, the left wing Americans for Democratic Action scored Patman low in its 100-point &quot;liberal quotient&quot; (LQ) scale, at 13 in 1972 and 24 in 1973. In contrast, the American Conservative Union rated Patman a more favorable 47 out of 100 in 1973.

In the U.S. House of Representatives in Washington, the Wright Patman Congressional Federal Credit Union is named after him. This credit union serves the banking needs of elected and former members of the House and their staff. In addition, Wright Patman Lake and Wright Patman Dam in Northeast Texas are also named for him.

==In fiction==
In the alternate history novel &quot;Settling Accounts: In at the Death&quot; by Harry Turtledove, part of the &quot;Southern Victory&quot; series, Wright Patman was a member of the Freedom Party and served as the Governor of Texas during the Second Great War. Towards the end of the conflict, he declares Texas&#x27;s secession from the Confederacy as an independent nation with himself as President to secure an armistice with the United States, agreeing to the re-establishment of the state of Houston and the arrest of Confederate war criminals as conditions.

<text>Street newspapers (or street papers) are newspapers or magazines sold by homeless or poor individuals and produced mainly to support these populations. Most such newspapers primarily provide coverage about homelessness and poverty-related issues, and seek to strengthen social networks within homeless communities. Street papers aim to give these individuals both employment opportunities and a voice in their community. In addition to being sold by homeless individuals, many of these papers are partially produced and written by them.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries several publications by charity, religious, and labor organizations tried to draw attention to the homeless, but street newspapers only became common after the founding of New York City&#x27;s &quot;Street News&quot; in 1989. Similar papers are now published in over 30 countries, with most located in the United States and Western Europe. They are supported by governments, charities, and coalitions such as the International Network of Street Papers and the North American Street Newspaper Association. Although street newspapers have multiplied, many still face challenges, including funding shortages, unreliable staff and difficulty in generating interest and maintaining an audience.

Street newspapers are sold mainly by homeless individuals, but the newspapers vary in how much content is submitted by them and how much of the coverage pertains to them: while some papers are written and published mainly by homeless contributors, others have a professional staff and attempt to emulate mainstream publications. These differences have caused controversy among street newspaper publishers over what type of material should be covered and to what extent the homeless should participate in writing and production. One popular street newspaper, &quot;The Big Issue&quot;, has been a focus of this controversy because it concentrates on attracting a large readership through coverage of mainstream issues and popular culture, whereas other newspapers emphasize homeless advocacy and social issues and earn less of a profit.

== History ==

=== Historical foundations ===

Although the modern street newspaper began with the 1989 publication of &quot;Street News&quot; in New York City, and the Street Sheet in San Francisco, 1989, newspapers sold by the poor and homeless to generate income and to bring attention to social problems date back to the late 19th century; journalism scholar Norma Fay Green has cited &quot;The War Cry&quot;, created by the Salvation Army in London in 1879, as an early form of &quot;dissident, underground, alternative publication&quot;. &quot;The War Cry&quot; was sold by Salvation Army officers and the working poor to draw people&#x27;s attention to the poor living conditions of these individuals. Another precursor to the modern street newspaper was Cincinnati&#x27;s &quot;Hobo News&quot;, which ran from 1915 to 1930 and featured writing from prominent labor and social activists as well as Industrial Workers of the World members, alongside contributions of oral history, creative writing, and artwork from hoboes, or itinerant beggars. Most street papers published before 1970, such as &quot;The Catholic Worker&quot; (founded in 1933), were affiliated with religious organizations. Like workers&#x27; papers and other forms of alternative media in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, early street newspapers were often created because the founders believed mainstream news did not cover issues that were relevant to ordinary people.

=== Modern street newspapers ===
Modern street newspapers began to emerge in the United States in the late 1980s in response to increasing levels of homelessness and homeless advocates&#x27; dissatisfaction with the mainstream media&#x27;s portrayals of the homeless. At the time, many media outlets portrayed homeless people as being all criminals and drug addicts, and suggested that homelessness was a result of laziness rather than societal or political factors. Thus, one motivation for the creation of the first street newspapers was to counter the negative coverage of homeless people that was coming from existing media.

&quot;Street News,&quot; founded in late 1989 in New York City, is frequently cited as the first modern street newspaper. While some small papers were already being published when it was founded, &quot;Street News&quot; attracted the most attention and became the &quot;catalyst&quot; for many other papers. Many more street papers were launched in the early 1990s, crediting the high-profile New York paper as their inspiration, such as &quot;Spare Change News&quot; in Boston founded in 1992. During this period, an average of five new papers were created every year. This growth has been attributed both to changing attitudes and policies towards homeless individuals and to the ease of publishing provided by desktop computers; After 1989, at least 100 papers sprung up in over 30 countries. By 2008, an estimated 32 million people worldwide read street newspapers, and 250,000 poor, disadvantaged, or homeless individuals sold or contributed to them.
Street papers have been started in many major cities worldwide, mainly in the United States and Western Europe. They have especially proliferated in Germany, which in 1999 had more street newspapers than the rest of Europe combined, and in Sweden, where the street papers &quot;Aluma&quot;, &quot;Situation Sthlm&quot; and &quot;Faktum&quot; won the 2006 grand prize award for journalism of the Swedish Publicists&#x27; Association. Street papers have been established in some cities in Canada, Africa, South America, and Asia. Even within the United States, some street newspapers (such as Chicago&#x27;s bilingual &quot;Hasta Cuando&quot;) are published in languages other than English.

In the mid-1990s, coalitions were established to strengthen the street newspaper movement. The International Network of Street Papers (INSP) (founded in 1994) and the North American Street Newspaper Association (NASNA) (founded in 1997) aim to provide support for street papers and to &quot;uphold ethical standards&quot;. In particular, the INSP was established to help groups that were starting new street newspapers, to bring more mainstream media attention to the street newspaper movement during the 1990s, and to support interaction and cross-talk between street paper publishers and staff from different countries. The INSP and the NASNA voted to combine their resources in 2006; they have collaborated to found the Street News Service, a project which collects articles from member papers and archives them on the internet. National street paper coalitions have also been formed in Europe (there is a national coalition in Italy, and the Netherlands has the &quot;Straatmedia Groep Nederland&quot;).

== Description ==
Most street newspapers have three main purposes:
* To provide income and job skills to the homeless and other marginalized individuals, who act as vendors of and often contributors to the newspapers
* To provide coverage of, and to educate the general public about, issues pertaining to homelessness and poverty
* To establish social networks within homeless communities and between homeless individuals and service providers

The defining characteristic of a street newspaper is that it is sold by homeless or marginalized vendors. While many street newspapers aim to provide coverage of social issues and educate the public about homelessness, this goal is often secondary: many people who buy street newspapers do so to support and express solidarity with the homeless vendor, rather than to read the paper.

The precise demographics of the readership of street newspapers is unclear. A pair of 1993 surveys conducted by Chicago&#x27;s &quot;StreetWise&quot; suggested that the paper&#x27;s readers at the time tended to be college-educated, with slightly over half being female, and slightly over half unmarried.

=== Operations and business ===
Most street newspapers operate by selling the papers to homeless vendors for a fraction of the retail price (usually between 10% and 50%), after which the vendors sell the papers for the retail price and retain all the proceeds from street sales. The income vendors earn from sales is intended to help them &quot;get back on their feet&quot;. The purpose of requiring vendors to purchase papers up front and earn back the money by selling them is to help them develop skills in financial management. Vendors for most newspapers are identifiable by badges or messenger bags. Many newspapers require that vendors sign a code of conduct or otherwise &quot;clean up their act&quot;.

Most street newspaper vendors in the United States and United Kingdom are homeless individuals, although in several other countries (especially in Europe) papers are mainly sold by refugees. Nevertheless, not all vendors are homeless; some have stable housing situations but are unable to hold other jobs, while others started out homeless but were eventually able to use their income from sales to find housing. In general, the major American street newspapers do not require prospective vendors to show proof of homelessness or poverty, and they do not require vendors to retire once they find stable housing. In the United States, during and after the Great Recession, there were many vendors who became &quot;newly needy&quot;—only recently homeless, or with only temporary financial difficulty—as opposed to the &quot;chronically homeless&quot; who have traditionally made up the majority of the vendor force. These vendors are often well-educated and have extensive work experience, but lost their jobs.

Street papers start in a variety of ways. Some, such as &quot;Street Sense&quot;, are begun by homeless or formerly homeless individuals, whereas others are more professional ventures. Many, particularly in the United States, receive aid from local government and charities, and coalitions such as the International Network of Street Papers and the North American Street Newspaper Association provide workshops and support for new street papers. Many develop in a bottom-up fashion, starting up through volunteer work and &quot;newcomers to the media business&quot; and gradually expanding to include professionals. For most papers, the majority of revenue comes from sales, donations, and government grants, while some receive advertising revenue from local businesses. There has been some disagreement among street newspaper publishers and supporters over whether papers should accept advertising, with some arguing that advertising is practical and helps support the paper, and others claiming that many kinds of advertisements are inappropriate in a paper that is mainly geared towards the poor.

Specific business models for street newspapers vary widely, ranging from vendor-managed papers that place the highest value upon homeless empowerment and involvement to highly professionalized and commercialized weeklies. Some papers (especially in Europe) operate as autonomous businesses, while others operate as parts of existing organizations or projects. There are papers that are very successful, such as the UK-based &quot;The Big Issue&quot;, which in 2001 sold nearly 300,000 copies a week and earned the equivalent of 1 millionUSD in profits, but many papers sell as few as 3,000 copies a month and barely generate a profit at all for the publishers.

=== Coverage ===
Most street newspapers report on issues regarding homelessness and poverty, sometimes functioning as a main source of information on policy changes and other practical issues that are relevant to the homeless but may go unreported in mainstream media. Many feature contributions from the homeless and the poor in addition to articles by activists and community organizers, including profiles of individual street newspaper vendors. For example, the first edition of Washington, D.C.&#x27;s &quot;Street Sense&quot; included a description of a prominent homeless community, an interview with a congresswoman, an editorial about the costs and benefits of taking a job, several poems about homelessness, a how-to column, and a section for recipes. A 2009 issue of the Lawrence, Kansas-based &quot;Change of Heart&quot; included a story on the recent bulldozing of a homeless camp, a review of a book on homelessness, a description of the Family Promise organization for homeless support, and a list of community resources; much of this content was submitted by the homeless. The writing style is often simple and clear; social scientist Kevin Howley describes street newspapers as having a &quot;native eloquence&quot;.

According to Howley, street newspapers are similar to citizen journalism in that both are a response to the perceived shortcomings of the mainstream media and both encourage involvement by non-professionals. A major difference between the two, however, is that the citizen journalism movement does not necessarily advocate a particular position, whereas street newspapers openly advocate for the homeless and poor.

Unlike most street newspapers, the UK-based &quot;The Big Issue&quot; focuses mostly on celebrity news and interviews, rather than coverage of homelessness and poverty. It is still sold by homeless vendors and uses the bulk of its proceeds to support homeless individuals and advocacy organizations for the homeless, but the paper&#x27;s content is mostly written by professional staff and geared towards a broad audience. Because of its professional nature and high production values, it has been a frequent target of criticism in an ongoing debate between adherents of professional and grassroots ideals of how street newspapers should work.

=== Social benefits ===
In addition to providing some individuals with income and employment, street newspapers are intended to give homeless participants responsibility and independence, and to create a tight-knit homeless community. Many offer additional programs to vendors, such as job training, housing placement assistance, and referral to other direct services. Others operate as a program of a larger social services organization—for instance, Chicago&#x27;s &quot;StreetWise&quot; can refer vendors to providers of &quot;drug and alcohol treatment, high school equivalency classes, career counseling, and permanent housing&quot;. Most are engaged in some form of organizing and advocacy regarding homelessness and poverty, and many function as &quot;watchdogs&quot; for the local homeless communities. Howley has described street newspapers as a means of mobilizing the networks of &quot;formal and informal relationships that exist between the homeless, the unemployed, and the working poor, and shelter managers, healthcare workers, community organizers, and others who work on their behalf&quot;.

=== Challenges and criticisms ===

In the early days of street newspapers, people were often reluctant to buy from homeless vendors for fear that they were being scammed. Furthermore, many of the more activist papers fail to sell well because their writing and production are perceived to be unprofessional and lackluster. Topics covered are sometimes seen as lacking newsworthy content, and of little relevance or interest to the general public or the homeless community. Organizations in Montreal and San Francisco have responded to these criticisms by offering workshops in writing and journalism for homeless contributors. Papers such as &quot;StreetWise&quot; have in the past been criticized as &quot;grim&quot; and for having vendors that are too loud and intrusive. Some newspapers sell well but may not be widely read, as many people will donate to vendors without buying, or buy the newspaper and then throw it away. Howley has described readers&#x27; hesitance or unwillingness to read the papers as &quot;compassion fatigue&quot;. On the other hand, those papers that do sell well and are widely read, such as &quot;The Big Issue&quot;, are often targets of criticism for being too &quot;mainstream&quot; or commercial.

Other difficulties street newspapers face include high turnover of &quot;transient&quot; or unreliable staff, lack of adequate funding, lack of journalistic freedom for papers that are funded by local government, and, among some demographics, lack of interest in homeless issues. For example, journalism professor Jim Cunningham has attributed the difficulties in selling Calgary&#x27;s &quot;Calgary Street Talk&quot; to the fact that the mostly middle-class, conservative population has &quot;not enough sensitivity to the causes of homelessness&quot;. Finally, anti-homeless legislation often targets street newspapers and vendors; for example, in New York City and Cleveland, laws have prevented vendors from selling papers on public transit or other high-traffic areas, making it difficult for the papers &quot;Street News&quot; and &quot;Homeless Grapevine&quot; to earn revenue.

=== Differing approaches ===

Among proponents and publishers of street newspapers there is disagreement over how street newspapers should be run and what their goals should be, reflecting a &quot;clash between two philosophies for advocating social change&quot;. On one side of the debate are papers that seek to function like a business and generate a profit and a wide readership in order to benefit the homeless in a practical way; on the other are papers that seek to provide a &quot;voice&quot; to the homeless and poor without watering down their message for a broad readership. Timothy Harris, the director of &quot;Real Change&quot;, has described the two camps as &quot;liberal entrepreneurial&quot; and &quot;radical, grassroots activist&quot;.

Controversy surrounding &quot;The Big Issue&quot;, the world&#x27;s most widely circulated street newspaper, is a good example of these two schools of thought. &quot;The Big Issue&quot; is mostly a tabloid covering celebrity news; while it is sold by the homeless and generates a profit that is used to benefit the homeless, the content is not written by them and there is little coverage of social issues that are relevant to them. In the late 1990s when the London-based paper began making plans to enter markets in the United States, many American street newspaper publishers reacted defensively, saying they could not compete with the production values and mainstream appeal of the professionally produced &quot;The Big Issue&quot; or that &quot;The Big Issue&quot; did not do enough to provide a voice to the homeless. The reaction to &quot;The Big Issue&quot; raised what is now an ongoing conflict between commercialized, professional papers and more grassroots-style ones, with papers such as &quot;The Big Issue&quot; emulating mainstream papers and magazines in order to generate a large profit to invest in homeless issues and others focusing on political and social issues rather than on content that will generate money. Some street newspaper proponents believe that the primary aim of the papers should be to give homeless individuals a voice and to &quot;fill the void&quot; in mainstream media coverage, whereas others believe it should be to provide homeless individuals with jobs and an income.

Other frequent areas of disagreement include the extent that the homeless should participate in the writing and printing of street newspapers, and whether street newspapers should accept advertising to generate revenue. Kevin Howley sums up the division between different street newspaper models when he questions if it is &quot;possible (or desirable for that matter) to publish a dissident newspaper—that is, a publication committed to progressive social change—and still attract a wide audience&quot;.

<text>The Achievement Medal is a military decoration of the United States Armed Forces. The Achievement Medal was first proposed as a means to recognize outstanding achievement or meritorious service of military personnel who were not eligible to receive the higher Commendation Medal or the Meritorious Service Medal.

Each military service issues its own version of the Achievement Medal, with a fifth version authorized by the U.S. Department of Defense for joint military activity. The Achievement Medal is awarded for outstanding achievement or meritorious service not of a nature that would otherwise warrant awarding the Commendation Medal. Award authority rests with local commanders, granting a broad discretion of when and for what action the Achievement Medal may be awarded.

==History==

===Navy and Marine Corps===
The Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal (NAM), is the United States Navy and U.S. Marine Corps&#x27; version of the Achievement Medal. The U.S. Navy was the first branch of the U.S. Armed Forces to award such a medal, doing so in 1961, when it was dubbed the &quot;Secretary of the Navy Commendation for Achievement Medal.&quot; This title was shortened in 1967 to simply, the &quot;Navy Achievement Medal.&quot; On August 19, 1994, to recognize those of the United States Marine Corps who had received the Navy Achievement Medal, the name of the decoration was officially changed to the &quot;Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal&quot;. The award is still often referred to in shorthand speech as the &quot;Navy Achievement Medal&quot; or &quot;NAM&quot; for short.

====Chain of Command approval====
From its inception in the early 1960s to 2002, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal could not be approved by the commanding officers of ships, submarines, aviation squadron, or shore activities who held the rank of Commander (O-5). Awards for crewmembers had to be submitted to the Commodore or Air Wing Commander or the first appropriate O-6 in the chain of command for approval, who then signed the award and returned it. This led to a dramatically lower awarding rate when compared to similar size units in the Army or Air Force awarding their own achievement medals, especially considering that those services did not establish their respective achievement medals until the 1980s. Since 2002 the commanding officers of aviation squadrons and ships have had the authority to award NAMs without submission to higher authority. This is in contrast to the Army, where battalion commanders or the first O-5 in a soldier&#x27;s chain of command are the authorizing official.

===Army, Air Force, Space Force, and Coast Guard===
The United States Coast Guard created its own Coast Guard Achievement Medal in 1967; the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force issued their own versions of the award with the Army Achievement Medal (AAM) in 1981 and Air Force Achievement Medal (AFAM) in 1980. Effective 11 September 2001, the Army Achievement Medal may be awarded in a combat area. Since this change over sixty thousand Army Achievement Medals have been awarded in theaters of operations such as Iraq and Afghanistan. On 16 November 2020, the Air Force Achievement Medal was renamed to the Air and Space Achievement Medal (ASAM) by the Secretary of the Air Force.

===Joint Service Achievement Medal===
The Joint Service Achievement Medal (JSAM) was created in 1983. This award was considered a Department of Defense decoration senior to the service department Achievement Medals.

==Ribbon devices==
The following devices may be authorized to be worn on the following achievement medals suspension ribbon and service ribbon:
* All Achievement Medals &quot;C&quot; device, which signifies meritorious performance &quot;under combat conditions&quot; after January 2016

<text>Dyce () is a suburb of Aberdeen, Scotland, situated on the River Don about northwest of the city centre. It is best known as the location of Aberdeen Airport.

== History ==

Dyce is the site of an early medieval church dedicated to the 8th century missionary and bishop Saint Fergus, otherwise associated with Glamis, Angus. Today the cemetery, north of the airport, and overlooking the River Don, hosts the roofless but otherwise virtually complete former St Fergus Chapel. Within the chapel, Pictish and early Christian stones from the 7th–9th centuries, found in or around the churchyard, are displayed (Historic Scotland; open at all times without entrance charge).

The chapel is a unicameral late medieval building with alterations perhaps of the 17th or 18th century. Two further carved stones, of uncertain (though probably early) origin, were discovered re-used as building rubble in the inner east gable and outer south wall during the chapel&#x27;s restoration. They were left &quot;in situ&quot; and are readily visible. A broken font, somewhat resembling a round-backed chair in its present condition, lies outside the site of the church, and may also be of early medieval date.

The graveyard surrounding the old church was used into the 20th century, and retains almost no old gravestones. There is a small morthouse in one corner of the enclosure, which is adjoined by a modern extension, still in use for burials. During World War I conscientious objectors laboured at Dyce Work Camp at Dyce Quarries. One of these is believed to be the Tyrebagger Quarry just north of Aberdeen to the east of the A96.

A major employer in the village was the firm Lawsons which was a meat producer, mainly of pork and ham. In the 1920s a small local farmers&#x27; cooperative, which had been mothballed, was taken over by the Lawson family, originally from Dunfermline. The site was developed and eventually employed around 1,800 people at its peak. They supplied products throughout Scotland and had a major contract to supply Marks &amp; Spencer under licence.

== Climate ==


== Economy ==

Dyce has one main shopping centre which includes an Asda store, with a Boots chemist, a hairdresser, an optometrist and several empty units.

===Oil===
Aker Solutions, the Norway-based oilfield services giant, runs its UK operations from Dyce, at the Aberdeen International Business Park. The North Sea headquarters of BP are located at the Farburn Industrial Estate.
All of BP&#x27;s UK fields are operated from the office building pictured. The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Harold Wilson (Prime Minister) and Prince Andrew came to the BP offices on 3 November 1975 to switch on the supply of oil from the BP Forties Oil Field. The oil came inland at Cruden Bay, and ended up 130 miles away at Grangemouth Refinery. Development of the field had cost around £750m. Britain became self-sufficient in oil by 1980. The Auk oilfield was the next main field to bring oil ashore.

Charles III, then Prince Charles, visited Dyce on 3 September 1992 to BP to officially inaugurate the Miller oilfield; he later met people with the Prince&#x27;s Scottish Youth Business Trust (now called Youth Business Scotland).

==Transport==
Aberdeen Airport is located in Dyce.

Dyce railway station is served by ScotRail trains on the Aberdeen to Inverness Line.

The Formartine and Buchan Way, a pedestrian and cycle path, starts at Dyce railway station and continues to Newmachar, Ellon, and onward to Peterhead and Fraserburgh. It follows the trackbed of the former Formartine and Buchan Railway.

The Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route circles west and north of the suburb.

==Education==
The local secondary school, Dyce Academy, has about 500 pupils. Dyce Academy is home to the Aberdeen City Music School. There is also a primary school, Dyce Primary School. Dyce is also the location for the Cordyce School, a secondary school serving pupils who require additional support. In November 2017, Cordyce School suffered extensive damage following a fire that engulfed most of the building. following the fire, four young boys, three aged fifteen and one aged fourteen, were charged.

==Parks and recreation==

The area of Aberdeen has sports facilities including the local junior football team Dyce F.C who currently play in the Scottish Junior Football Association North Region and the cricket team.

Dyce (Aberdeen) Amateur Swimming Club (established 1977) runs its own Swim School. It is based at the Dyce Academy swimming pool. The club and swim school are both affiliated to the Scottish Amateur Swimming Association to help swimmers compete up to North District and Scottish National Level.

==People from Dyce==

*Alexander Chalmers (1645–1703), Mayor of Warsaw, Poland
*Rev William Robinson Pirie (1804–1885) Minister of Dyce 1830 to 1846, Principal of Aberdeen University and Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1864.
*Dr James Edward Crombie FRSE (1862–1932), philanthropist and seismologist, of the Crombie clothing empire, lived at Parkhill House just outside Dyce.

<text>The River Quoich is a tributary of the River Dee in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It flows in a generally southerly direction and is about 15 km long (including its upper reaches, known as Quoich Water, above the confluence with the Allt an dubh-ghlinne). The clachan of Allanaquoich is situated just above the river&#x27;s confluence with the Dee. Near Allanaquoich is the Linn of Quoich, a waterfall through a narrow ravine, over which there is a bridge at the narrowest part. Near the bridge is the Earl of Mar&#x27;s Punch Bowl: a natural hole in a rock midstream that was literally used as a punchbowl after hunting deer in the neighbouring forest. The river joins the Dee about 1 miles or 2 km west of Braemar.

The Linn of Quoich has been the site of several deaths in recent years, including those of an overworked, suicidal male doctor and a ten-year-old girl who fell into the river and drowned.

<doc id="766118" wikidata="Q2244850" url="?curid=766118" title="The Courtship of Eddie's Father (TV series)">
<text>The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father is an American sitcom based on the 1963 film of the same name, which was based on a novel by Mark Toby (edited by Dorothy Wilson).

The series is about a widower, Tom Corbett (played by Bill Bixby), who is a magazine publisher, and his young son, Eddie (played by Brandon Cruz). Eddie believes his father should marry, and manipulates situations surrounding the women his father is interested in. (Eddie&#x27;s matchmaking efforts were the theme of the film, but gradually became less central to the storylines in the series.)

The series debuted on September 17, 1969, and was last broadcast on March 1, 1972.

Bixby received an Emmy nomination for the show.

==Plot==
The show centered on Tom Corbett (Bill Bixby), a handsome, thirty-something magazine publisher and widower from Los Angeles. Following the death of his wife Helen, Tom is left to raise his mischievous, freckle-faced son, six-year-old Eddie (Brandon Cruz). Eddie wants a new mother, so to that end, he cleverly manipulates his father&#x27;s relationships with women, sometimes even trying to set his father up to fall for women Eddie knows and likes first.

The father-son duo&#x27;s domestic arrangements are managed, with great discretion, by their Japanese housekeeper, Mrs. Livingston (Miyoshi Umeki). Her sage advice adds to the comedic mix in situations where she looks after Eddie, and sometimes helps him further his schemes to marry off his father and find a new mother. Mrs. Livingston addresses her employer, Tom, as &quot;Mr. Eddie&#x27;s Father.&quot; Characters from Tom Corbett&#x27;s office included Tina Rickles (Kristina Holland) as his secretary and Norman Tinker (James Komack) as the magazine&#x27;s photographer and token radical. Norman served as Eddie&#x27;s honorary uncle.

==Cast==
===Main cast===
Bill Bixby and Brandon Cruz are the only two actors to appear in every episode of the series.
* Bill Bixby as Tom Corbett – A widower and a magazine editor
* Brandon Cruz as Eddie Corbett – Tom&#x27;s son
* Miyoshi Umeki as Mrs. Livingston – Tom&#x27;s and Eddie&#x27;s housekeeper
* Kristina Holland as Tina Rickles – Tom&#x27;s secretary
* James Komack as Norman Tinker – Tom&#x27;s partner at a magazine company

===Guest cast===
During its three-season run, many familiar or up-and-coming actors who guest-starred on the show went on to become successful stars, including: Jodie Foster, Sally Struthers, Bruce Kirby, Pat Harrington Jr., Diana Muldaur, Willie Aames, Warren Berlinger, Suzanne Pleshette, Yvonne Craig, Cicely Tyson, Richard X. Slattery, Tippi Hedren, Trisha Noble, John Fiedler, Alan Oppenheimer, Lou Jacobi, Will Geer, Bill Dana, Jerry Stiller, Anne Meara, Ronny Graham, Lori Saunders, Ann Prentiss, Ron Ely, Carol Lawrence, and George Takei. Future &quot;Happy Days&quot; stars Pat Morita and Erin Moran also made guest appearances. Established stars also made cameo appearances, such as Eve McVeagh as a grumpy neighbor named Lorraine Karn, Sammy Davis Jr. as an insurance man, and Bixby&#x27;s then-wife Brenda Benet as Tom&#x27;s girlfriend.

==Production==
===Crew===
Comedy producer James Komack served as the show&#x27;s creator and executive producer. In 1970, Bill Bixby made his debut as a director, going on to direct eight of the show&#x27;s episodes.

===Theme song===
The theme song, &quot;Best Friend&quot;, was written and performed by Harry Nilsson; it was an adaptation of his song &quot;Girlfriend&quot; with new lyrics written for the show. The theme was played over opening credits showing Bixby and Cruz in various happy moments.

An edited version of &quot;Best Friend&quot; was used as the theme song for the 2006 MTV series &quot;Rob &amp; Big&quot;.

===Cancellation===
The show was cancelled in 1972, when Bixby and Komack had a falling out over the show&#x27;s direction. Many of the later episodes focused on Norman, Tom, and Eddie rather than on the relationship between Tom and Eddie. Years after the show was cancelled, it became quietly popular as reruns in syndication.

==Home media==
Warner Bros. has released all three seasons of &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot; on DVD in Region 1 via their Warner Archive Collection. These are Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) releases, available via WBShop.com and Amazon.

==Failed re-makes==
There have been three attempts at re-making the show, none of which resulted in a new series.

As early as 1999, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reported plans for Nicolas Cage to star in and produce a feature film remake of the series. In a 2011 interview, Brandon Cruz believed Cage was likely no longer interested in the project because Cage&#x27;s son Weston, who would have played Eddie, had grown too old for the part.

In 2003, filming began on a new television pilot which starred Ken Marino and Josh Hutcherson, but it was not picked up by a network. The child star of the previous series, Brandon Cruz, played a supporting role.

In 2014, Willie Garson was developing a version in which he would star as Norman Tinker. Garson was going to write and produce alongside feature filmmakers Mark Levin, Jennifer Flackett and Conan O&#x27;Brien. The series never eventuated.

<doc id="766123" wikidata="Q1797465" url="?curid=766123" title="Janet Cooke">
<text>Janet Leslie Cooke (born July 23, 1954) is an American former journalist. She received a Pulitzer Prize in 1981 for an article written for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. The story was later discovered to have been fabricated and Cooke returned the prize, the only person to date to do so, after admitting she had fabricated stories. The prize was awarded instead to Teresa Carpenter, a nominee who had lost to Cooke.

==Early life==
Cooke grew up in an upper-middle-class, African-American family in Toledo, Ohio. She said her upbringing was stressful and strict, with constant demands on her by both the predominantly white preparatory schools she attended and by her father, whom she described as domineering; as a result, she claimed that habitual lying became a &quot;survival mechanism&quot; for her as a child. She enrolled at Vassar College before transferring to the University of Toledo, where she earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree. However, Cooke would claim later that she received her bachelor&#x27;s degree from Vassar and a master&#x27;s degree from Toledo.

In 1977, Cooke began writing for &quot;The Toledo Blade&quot;. Two years later, she interviewed for a job with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and was hired. She was assigned to the &quot;Weeklies&quot; section staff of the &quot;Post&quot; managed by editor Vivian Aplin-Brownlee in January 1980. There, she quickly gained a reputation as a prolific journalist and a strong writer, filing 52 articles in her first eight months. Aplin-Brownlee later remarked that Cooke was also &quot;consumed by blind and raw ambition&quot;.

==Fabricated story scandal==
In a September 28, 1980 article in the &quot;Post&quot;, titled &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s World&quot;, Cooke profiled the supposed life of an eight-year-old heroin addict named Jimmy, said to be a pseudonym. She wrote of the &quot;needle marks freckling the baby-smooth skin of his thin, brown arms&quot;, and claimed to have witnessed episodes of heroin injection, describing them in graphic detail. The article engendered much empathy among readers, including Marion Barry, then-mayor of Washington, D.C.

The mayor and other city officials organized an all-out police search for the boy, which was unsuccessful and resulted in speculation that the story was fraudulent. Barry, with considerable public demand for a resolution to be announced, said variously that Jimmy had been entered into treatment or had died. Barry then admitted that the city still had no information on Jimmy&#x27;s whereabouts, and suggested that the story was fictionalized partially, saying it was unlikely that Jimmy&#x27;s mother or dealer would &quot;allow a reporter to see them shoot up&quot;, as Cooke claimed she saw.

Although some within the &quot;Post&quot; doubted the story&#x27;s veracity, the paper defended it and assistant managing editor Bob Woodward submitted the story for the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing, which Cooke was awarded on April 13, 1981. An Associated Press (AP) article about the Pulitzer winners featured biographical profiles, including Cooke&#x27;s fabricated educational background. When the article was seen by editors at &quot;The Toledo Blade&quot;, they noticed the discrepancies and alerted the AP, which in turn contacted the &quot;Post&quot;. A further review of Cooke&#x27;s self-reported biography revealed additional fabrications that she had added since being hired by the &quot;Post&quot;. Her initial résumé claimed that she was fluent in French and Spanish, but she later added Portuguese and Italian; executive editor Ben Bradlee later tested her language abilities, and found that she spoke no Portuguese or Italian and only rudimentary French. In addition, she also added a claim that she attended the University of Paris and won seven awards for her journalism in Ohio, as opposed to the one she had listed previously.

On April 14, Cooke was confronted about these discrepancies by &quot;Post&quot; editors and admitted to fabricating her background. Editors then reviewed her notes and recorded interviews for the story, and found no evidence that she had ever interviewed a child who was using heroin. While Cooke initially stood by her reporting, she began to equivocate over the following hours, before finally admitting that &quot;Jimmy&quot; was fabricated. On the morning of April 15, 1981, Cooke issued a statement in which she publicly confessed this and announced her resignation from the &quot;Post&quot;. The Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing was instead given to Teresa Carpenter, for her article in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; about the murder of Dorothy Stratten.

Of &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s World&quot;, Woodward said:
Gabriel García Márquez said about Cooke, &quot;It was unfair that she won the Pulitzer prize, but also unfair that she didn&#x27;t win the Nobel Prize in Literature.&quot; Cooke appeared on &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot; in January 1982 and said that the high-pressure environment of the &quot;Post&quot; had corrupted her judgment. She said that her sources had hinted to her about the existence of a boy such as Jimmy but, unable to find him, she eventually created a story about him to satisfy her editors.

==Later life==
Cooke later married a lawyer who subsequently became a diplomat. The couple relocated to Paris in 1985, living there for the next decade. However, their marriage eventually ended, and Cooke said that the divorce left her impoverished. She returned to the United States, supporting herself with low-wage service jobs and financial help from her mother. 

In 1996, she gave an interview about the &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s World&quot; episode to &quot;GQ&quot; reporter Mike Sager, a former &quot;Washington Post&quot; colleague whom she had dated briefly during her time there. Cooke and Sager sold the movie rights to the story to Tri-Star Pictures for $1.6 million, but the project never advanced past the script stage. 

In 2016, Sager wrote in the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; that Cooke &quot;is living within the borders of the continental United States, within a family setting, and pursuing a career that does not primarily involve writing&quot;.

<text>The shortfin mako shark (; ; Isurus oxyrinchus), also known as the shortfin mako, blue pointer, or bonito shark, is a large mackerel shark. It is commonly referred to as the mako shark, as is the longfin mako shark (&quot;Isurus paucus&quot;). The fastest known shark species, able to reach speeds of in bursts, the shortfin mako can attain a size of in length and weigh . The species is classified as Endangered by the IUCN.

==Etymology==
&quot;Mako&quot; comes from the Māori language, meaning either the shark or a shark tooth. Following the Māori language, &quot;mako&quot; in English is both singular and plural. The word may have originated in a dialectal variation, as it is similar to the common words for shark in a number of Polynesian languages—&quot;makō&quot; in the Kāi Tahu Māori dialect, &quot;mangō&quot; in other Māori dialects, &quot;mago&quot; in Samoan, &quot;ma&#x27;o&quot; in Tahitian, and &quot;mano&quot; in Hawaiian. The first written usage is in Lee and Kendall&#x27;s &quot;Grammar and vocabulary of the language of New Zealand&quot; (1820), which simply states, &quot;Máko; A certain fish&quot;. Richard Taylor&#x27;s &quot;A leaf from the natural history of New Zealand&quot; (1848) is more elaborate: &quot;Mako, the shark which has the tooth so highly prized by the Maoris&quot;.
In 1809, Constantine Rafinesque gave the short-fin mako the scientific name &quot;Isurus oxyrinchus&quot; (&quot;isurus&quot; means &quot;the same tail&quot;, &quot;oxyrinchus&quot; means &quot;pointy snout&quot;).

==Description==
The shortfin mako shark is a fairly large species of shark. Growth rates appear to be somewhat accelerated in comparison to other species in the lamnid family. An average adult specimen measures around in length and weighs from . The species is sexually dimorphic, with females typically larger than males. Large specimens are known, with a few large, mature females exceeding a length of and a weight of . The largest taken on hook-and-line was , caught off the coast of California on June 3, 2013, and the longest verified length was caught off the Mediterranean coast of France in September 1973. A specimen caught off the coast of Italy and examined in an Italian fish market in 1881 was reported to weigh an extraordinary at a length of . Yet another fish was caught off Marmaris, Turkey in the late 1950s at an estimated size of between making it the largest known specimen of the species. However, this estimate was created using photos of the shark and not at the time of capture so this estimate must be taken with reasonable caution. The authors did not estimate a weight for this specimen.

The shortfin mako shark is cylindrical in shape, with a vertically elongated tail. This species exhibits countershading, with brilliant metallic blue coloration dorsally and white ventrally. The line of demarcation between blue and white on the body is distinct. The underside of the snout and the area around the mouth are white. Larger specimens tend to possess darker coloration that extends onto parts of the body that would be white in smaller individuals. The juvenile mako differs in that it has a clear blackish stain on the tip of the snout. The longfin mako shark very much resembles the shortfin mako shark, but has larger pectoral fins, dark rather than pale coloration around the mouth and larger eyes. The presence of only one lateral keel on the tail and the lack of lateral cusps on the teeth distinguish the mako from the closely related porbeagle sharks of the genus &quot;Lamna&quot;. The shortfin mako shark is also credited as being the fastest shark in the ocean, reaching moving speeds of with bursts up to . Due to this, it is often known as the &quot;&quot;cheetah&quot; or &quot;peregrine falcon of sharks.&quot;&quot;

==Ecology==
===Range and habitat===

The shortfin mako inhabits offshore temperate and tropical seas worldwide. The closely related longfin mako shark is found in the Gulf Stream or warmer offshore waters (e.g. New Zealand and Maine).

It is a pelagic species that can be found from the surface to depths of , normally far from land, though occasionally closer to shore, around islands or inlets. One of the very few known endothermic sharks, it is seldom found in waters colder than .

In the western Atlantic, it can be found from Argentina and the Gulf of Mexico to Browns Bank off of Nova Scotia. In Canadian waters, these sharks are neither abundant nor rare. Swordfish are good indicators of shortfin mako populations, as the former are a source of food and prefer similar environmental conditions. The shark is one of the most commonly found in the waters of New Zealand.

Shortfin mako sharks travel long distances to seek prey or mates. In December 1998, a female tagged off California was captured in the central Pacific by a Japanese research vessel, meaning this fish traveled over . Another specimen swam in 37 days, averaging a day.

===Feeding===

The shortfin mako shark feeds mainly upon cephalopods and bony fish including mackerel, tuna, bonito, and swordfish, but it may also eat other sharks, porpoises, sea turtles, and seabirds. They hunt by lunging vertically up and tearing off chunks of their preys&#x27; flanks and fins. Mako swim below their prey, so they can see what is above and have a high probability of reaching prey before it notices them. In Ganzirri and Isola Lipari, Sicily, shortfin mako have been found with amputated swordfish bills impaled into their head and gills, suggesting swordfish seriously injure and likely kill them. In addition, this location, and the late spring and early summer timing, corresponding to the swordfish&#x27;s spawning cycle, suggests they hunt while the swordfish are most vulnerable, typical of many predators.

Shortfin mako sharks consume 3% of their weight each day and take about 1.5–2.0 days to digest an average-sized meal. By comparison, the sandbar shark, an inactive species, consumes 0.6% of its weight a day and takes 3 to 4 days to digest it. An analysis of the stomach contents of 399 male and female mako sharks ranging from suggests mako from Cape Hatteras to the Grand Banks prefer bluefish, constituting 77.5% of their diet by volume. The average capacity of the stomach was 10% of the total weight. Shortfin mako sharks consumed 4.3% to 14.5% of the available bluefish between Cape Hatteras and Georges Bank.

Shortfin mako sharks over have interior teeth considerably wider and flatter than smaller mako, which enables them to prey effectively upon dolphins, swordfish, and other sharks. An amateur videotape, taken in Pacific waters, shows a moribund pantropical spotted dolphin whose tail was almost completely severed being circled by a shortfin mako. Mako also tend to scavenge long-lined and netted fish.

The bite of a shortfin mako shark is exceptionally strong; the current record for the strongest bite measured for any shark belongs to a shortfin mako that was recorded at Mayor Island in New Zealand in 2020. The shark had been coaxed into biting a custom-made &quot;bite meter&quot; as part of an experiment to measure mako bite force. The strongest bite recorded during the experiment was roughly 3,000 lbs. of force, or roughly 13,000 newtons.

Its endothermic constitution partly accounts for its relatively great speed.

Like other lamnid sharks, the shortfin mako shark has a heat-exchange circulatory system that allows the shark to be warmer than the surrounding water. This system enables them to maintain a stable, very high level of activity, giving it an advantage over its cold-blooded prey.

==Behavior==
The shortfin mako is a fast species that can leap into the air when hooked, making it a highly sought-after game fish worldwide. Some cases of shortfin mako jumping into a boat after having been hooked have been reported.

===Reproduction===
The shortfin mako shark is a yolk-sac ovoviviparous shark giving birth to live young. Developing embryos feed on unfertilized eggs (oophagy) within the uterus during the 15- to 18-month gestation period. They do not engage in sibling cannibalism unlike the sand tiger shark (&quot;Carcharias taurus&quot;). The four to 18 surviving young are born live in the late winter and early spring at a length of about . Females may rest for 18 months after birth before mating again. Shortfin mako sharks bear young on average every three years.
A common mating strategy of shortfin mako sharks has been documented as using multiple paternity as a mating strategy, known as polyandry. Polyandry is where the females mate with more than one male. This strategy is used to have a single brood sired by multiple males (multiple paternity) and is a common strategy in diverse taxa, including invertebrates and vertebrates.

===Lifespan===
Shortfin mako sharks, as with most other sharks, are aged by sectioning vertebrae – one of the few bony structures in sharks – and counting growth bands. The age of shortfin mako, and therefore important parameters, such as age at sexual maturity and longevity, were severely underestimated until 2006 (e.g. claims of sexual maturity at 4–6 years, claims of longevity as low as 11 years), because of a poorly supported belief that shortfin mako sharks deposited two growth bands per year in their vertebrae. This belief was overturned by a landmark study which proved that shortfin mako sharks only deposit one band in their vertebrae per year, as well as providing validated ages for numerous specimens. Natanson et al. (2006) aged 258 shortfin mako specimens and recorded:
* Maximum age of 29 years in males ( fork length (FL))
* Maximum age of 32 years in females ( FL)
* 50% sexual maturity at 8 years in males ( FL)
* 50% sexual maturity at 18 years in females ( FL)

Similar, validated age findings were made (median age at maturity in males 7–9 years, median age at maturity in females 19–21 years, longevity estimates 29 years and 28 years respectively) in New Zealand waters.

Due to this error, fishery management models and ecological risk assessment models in use around the world were underestimating both the longevity and the age at sexual maturity in shortfin mako sharks, particularly in females, by two-thirds or more (i.e. 6 years versus 18+ years), and some of these inaccurate models remain in use.

===Intelligence===
Of all studied sharks, the shortfin mako has one of the largest brain-to-body ratios. This large brain size prompted New Zealand Sealife Australia and New Zealand senior curator Craig Thorburn of Auckland, New Zealand, and film-maker Mike Bhana to investigate the intelligence of the shortfin mako. From tests involving shape differentiation to electroreception tests and individual recognition, Isuru Somawardana and his team of shark experts discovered shortfin mako are fast-learning sharks, able to determine whether or not the researchers were threatening. The sharks involved in the study (while never the same individuals) after initial caution showed unique and novel behaviors, such as refusing to roll back their eyes during feeding and allowing themselves to be briefly restrained and touched while being offered bait. Shortfin mako also do not rely on electroreception when hunting, unlike the great white shark, based on tests involving wired fiberglass fish designed to emit weak electrical signals resembling real fish of similar size. Instead, they rely on smell, hearing, and most prominently, vision. The results of this research were featured on a documentary presented by Shark Week in 1999 called &quot;Mako: Swift, Smart &amp; Deadly&quot;.

==Relationship with humans==
===Fishing for sport===
Mako fishing is a prominent activity around the world. As one of the fastest species in the ocean, they offer acrobatic flips, fast runs, and strong fights, which all greatly entertains anglers. Traditionally, the sharks are hooked through the use of chum and baitcasters; however, fly fishing for them has become more popular, particularly in San Diego, California, where one of the three known worldwide mako rookeries is located. A cottage industry of fishing in this rookery has emerged, specifically catch-and-release, with charter operations out of Mission Bay. For many years, many commercial boats hunted them for restaurant catch, but through the efforts of many local fishing companies and national organizations (such as Orvis), this has been curbed.

===Captivity===

Of all recorded attempts to keep pelagic shark species in captivity, the shortfin mako shark has fared the poorest, even more so than the blue shark and the great white shark. At SeaWorld San Diego, a shortfin mako shark ability test failed in the early 1970s. In the summer of 1978, two mako sharks caught off the coast of San Diego failed to evade the wall and both died within three days. The current record is held by a specimen kept at the New Jersey Aquarium for only five days in 2001. Like past attempts at keeping &quot;Isurus&quot; in captivity, the animal appeared strong on arrival, but had trouble negotiating the walls of the aquarium, refused to feed, quickly weakened, and died.

===Attacks on humans===
ISAF statistics records 10 shortfin attacks on humans between 1980 and 2024, three of which were fatal, along with 20 boat attacks. Many attacks involving shortfin mako sharks are considered to have been provoked due to harassment or the shark being caught on a fishing line. Divers who have encountered shortfin mako note, prior to an attack, they swim in a figure-eight pattern and approach with mouths open. The most recent attack occurred on March 30, 2024 in Cabo San Lucas not ending in a fatality. The shark attacked a group of snorkelers and one man in particular had to wrestle with the shark before it was able to harm anyone else.

==Conservation==
The shortfin mako is currently classified as Endangered by the IUCN, having been uplisted from Vulnerable in 2019 and Near-Threatened in 2007. The species is included on Appendix II of CITES which regulates international trade. The species is being targeted by both sport and commercial fisheries, and there is a substantial proportion of bycatch in driftnet fisheries for other species. In June 2018, the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the shortfin mako shark as &quot;Not Threatened&quot; with the qualifier &quot;Uncertain whether Secure Overseas&quot; under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. In 2019, the shortfin mako was reclassified by the IUCN from being listed as &quot;Vulnerable&quot; to &quot;Endangered&quot; after a review of 58 elasmobranch species.

<text>Christian August Friedrich Peters (7 September 1806 – 8 May 1880) was a German astronomer. He was the father of astronomer Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Peters. He was born in Hamburg and died in Kiel.

Peters was the son of a merchant and, although he did not attend secondary school regularly, he obtained a good knowledge of mathematics and astronomy. In 1826 he became assistant to Heinrich Christian Schumacher at Altona Observatory. Schumacher encouraged him to study astronomy and Peters did a PhD under Friedrich Bessel at the University of Königsberg. In 1834 he became an assistant at Hamburg Observatory and in 1839 joined the staff of Pulkovo Observatory. In 1849 he became professor of astronomy at Königsberg and soon after succeeded Bessel as director of the observatory there. In 1854 he became director of the Altona Observatory and editor of the &quot;Astronomische Nachrichten&quot;. Peters edited the journal for the rest of his life, being responsible for 58 volumes of the journal. In 1872 the observatory moved to Kiel and he moved there and continued in his post. In 1866, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Peters became a name in the literature on the theory of errors for his 1856 note on the estimation of precision using absolute deviations from the mean.

Peters won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1852.

<doc id="766141" wikidata="Q177035" url="?curid=766141" title="Boeing XB-15">
<text>The Boeing XB-15 (Boeing 294) was a United States bomber aircraft designed in 1934 as a test for the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) to see if it would be possible to build a heavy bomber with a range. For a year beginning in mid-1935 it was designated the XBLR-1. When it first flew in 1937, it was the most massive and voluminous airplane ever built in the US. It set a number of load-to-altitude records for land-based aircraft, including carrying a payload to on 30 July 1939.

The aircraft&#x27;s immense size allowed flight engineers to enter the wing through a crawlway and make minor repairs in flight. A flight took 33 hours at its cruising speed; the crew was made up of several shifts, and bunks allowed them to sleep when off duty.

==Design and development==

The specification that produced the XB-15 began in mid-1933 as &quot;Project A&quot;, USAAC discussions regarding the possibility of flying a very large bomber with a range of . In April 1934, the USAAC contracted with Boeing and Martin to design a bomber capable of carrying at over a distance of 5,000 miles. Boeing gave the project the internal name of Model 294, while the USAAC called it the XB-15. Martin&#x27;s design, the XB-16, was judged inferior by the USAAC before a prototype was built, and was canceled.

The Boeing design team, headed by Jack Kylstra, initially intended the aircraft to use Allison V-3420 liquid-cooled W engines; since these were not ready, Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp air-cooled radial engines were used instead.

Starting in August 1934, Boeing began designing the Model 299 in answer to a proposal by the USAAC to replace the Martin B-10 bomber. The Model 299 design team incorporated elements of the Boeing 247 and the Model 294, especially its use of four engines. The Model 299 design team worked alongside Klystra&#x27;s team, but difficulties in fabricating such a large aircraft slowed progress on the 294. The Model 299 flew first, on 28 July 1935.

In mid-1935, the USAAC combined Project A with Project D; a proposal asking for &quot;the maximum feasible range into the future.&quot; The combined program was designated BLR for &quot;Bomber, Long Range&quot;. The XB-15 was renamed the XBLR-1; it was joined under the BLR program by two other projects: one from Douglas Aircraft, the XBLR-2 which later became the XB-19; and one from Sikorsky Aircraft called the XBLR-3, later canceled. The next year, the XBLR designation was dropped and the Boeing prototype was once again the XB-15.

Unusual features that the XB-15 pioneered included an autopilot, deicing equipment, and two gasoline generators used as auxiliary power units (independent of the main engines) to power the 110-volt electrical system. The main engines were serviceable in flight using an access tunnel inside the wing. The aircraft contained a sizable crew compartment with bunkbeds, a galley and a lavatory. Finally, in September 1937, construction was finished, and it first flew on 15 October. Its double-wheel main landing gear remained down from takeoff to landing. On 2 December 1937, the XB-15 flew from Seattle to Wright Field in Ohio to be accepted by the USAAC for testing.

With the Twin Wasp radial engines installed — the same number and type of engines fitted to the later Consolidated B-24 Liberator, with individual turbochargers added on the Liberators&#x27; Twin Wasp powerplants — the specified speed of for the Twin Wasp-powered XB-15 was not quite reached even when the aircraft was empty; the best speed attained in level flight was . Loaded with the specified , the maximum speed was a disappointing . This was considered too slow for a combat aircraft, and the project was abandoned. However, Boeing engineers projected that the prototype would be capable of carrying the heaviest air cargo to date: a load of .

The design challenges stemming from the great size of the XB-15 were difficult to master, but the lessons learned by Boeing were later applied to the Model 314 flying boat, which essentially used the XB-15&#x27;s wing design with four of the more powerful Wright Twin Cyclone fourteen-cylinder radials for power. In 1938, the USAAC proposed to update the XB-15 to make the slightly larger Y1B-20, again using four Wright Twin Cyclones as with the Boeing 314, but the Secretary of War, Harry Hines Woodring, canceled the project before construction began, in favor of the expensive Douglas XB-19. Boeing went ahead with an internal redesign of the XB-15 called Model 316, a very heavy bomber with a high wing, a pressurized cabin and tricycle gear. The Model 316 was not built. The progression of design work starting with the XB-15 finally bore fruit with the Model 345 presented to the USAAC in May 1940, the very heavy bomber which resulted in the USAAF&#x27;s Boeing B-29 Superfortress.

==Operational history==

The single prototype was assigned to the 2nd Bombardment Group at Langley Field, Virginia. Following the 24 January 1939 Chillán earthquake in Chile, the prototype flew a relief mission, carrying medical supplies. Commanded by Major Caleb V. Haynes, the aircraft carried of American Red Cross emergency supplies to Santiago, making only two stops along the way, at France Field in the Panama Canal Zone, and at Lima, Peru. Haynes was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Order of the Merit of Chile, and the whole crew earned the MacKay Trophy.

Haynes piloted the XB-15 again on 10 June 1939 to return home the body of Mexican flier Francisco Sarabia who had died in a crash in the Potomac River. After flying back from Mexico City, Haynes and his copilot William D. Old undertook flight tests at Wright Field with heavy loads. The XB-15 lifted a payload to a height of , and to , setting two world records for landplanes. Haynes was awarded certificates issued by the National Aeronautics Association (NAA) for an international record for &quot;the greatest payload carried to an altitude of 2,000 meters&quot;. The XB-15 was not fast for a bomber but it was the fastest aircraft that could carry so much weight, and for such distances. In July 1939, Haynes received certificates from the NAA for an international speed record with a payload. The latter performance also established a national closed circuit distance record of .

Flying from Langley, the XB-15 arrived at Albrook Field in Panama on 10 April 1940 and immediately began classified bombing tests of canal lock protections, commanded by Haynes and including Captain Curtis LeMay as navigator and Lieutenant John B. Montgomery as bombardier. Of 150 bombs dropped, only three hit the target: a specially made bunker simulating a reinforced machine room. The few hits nevertheless led to improvements in bunker design. In early May, Haynes and LeMay made a survey flight from Panama over the Galapagos islands, the inspection including Baltra Island. Haynes piloted the XB-15 back to the United States, leaving Panama on 11 May 1940.

In late 1940, the XB-15&#x27;s defensive guns were removed at Duncan Field in Texas. Seats were attached so that Lend Lease aircraft ferry crews could be returned after delivery.


===Cargo aircraft===
On 6 May 1943, the Army Air Forces converted the only prototype into a transport, the aircraft being redesignated XC-105. A cargo hoist was mounted, and cargo doors fitted. Its maximum gross weight was increased to . By this time, the aircraft was nicknamed &quot;Grandpappy&quot; by 20th Troop Carrier Squadron airmen. It displayed nose art depicting an elephant carrying a large crate on its back labeled &quot;supplies&quot;. During World War II, the XC-105 carried freight and personnel to and from Florida, and throughout the Caribbean, based out of Albrook Field beginning in June 1943. Hundreds of young women were flown in &quot;Grandpappy&quot; from Miami to the Canal Zone to engage in US government work; these trips were dubbed the &quot;Georgia Peach Run&quot;. &quot;Grandpappy&quot; traveled to the Galapagos, landing on Baltra Island at the same airfield built following the XB-15 aerial survey of May 1940.

&quot;Grandpappy′s&quot; flight crew, reduced to six men, described the aircraft as difficult to fly and service. Two fires and a complete failure of the electrical system occurred in the air. The aircraft was retired on 18 December 1944, assigned to Panama Air Depot. In June 1945, it was ordered to be scrapped at Albrook Field in Panama, its engines and internal parts removed along with its vertical stabilizer and rudder. The remaining airframe was deposited at Diablo dump, a swampy landfill southwest of the runway, where it slowly sank from sight. Squatters built shacks on stilts in the swamp, covering the remains. The former dump is now an industrial area, with &quot;Grandpappy&quot; underneath.

During its 18 months of transport service, the XC-105 carried more than 5,200 passengers, of cargo and of mail. It flew 70 cargo trips and 60 missions including anti-submarine patrol. Unusually, the aircraft was consistently referred to as &quot;he&quot; by its crew.

<text>Juan Morel Campos (16 May 1857 – 12 May 1896), sometimes erroneously spelled &quot;Juan Morell Campos&quot;, was a Puerto Rican composer, considered by many to be responsible for taking the genre of danza to its highest level. He composed over 550 musical works before he died unexpectedly at age 38.

==Early years==
Morel Campos (full name: Juan Nepomuceno Morel Campos) was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, to Manuel Morel Araujo, from the Dominican Republic, and Juana de Dios Campos Collazo, from Venezuela. He began to study music at the young age of eight in his hometown under the guidance of Antonio Egipciaco. Morel Campos was a student of Puerto Rican composer and pianist Gonzalo de J. Núñez (1850 - 1915), whose students also included the internationally known musicians and composers Manuel Gregorio Tavárez and Arístides Chavier Arévalo. Morel Campos learned to play practically every brass instrument and eventually became one of the founders and directors of the &quot;Ponce Firemen&#x27;s Band&quot; (La Banda de Bomberos del Parque de Bombas de Ponce). The legendary band was later renamed the Ponce Municipal Band.

==First composition==
Later, Morel Campos became a student of the composer Manuel Gregorio Tavárez, &quot;The Father of the Danza&quot;. Campos&#x27; first danza composition was called &quot;Sopapos&quot;. The influence of Tavárez, plus the particular style developed by Morel Campos can be listened to in his music today.

Morel Campos had his own dance orchestra, &quot;La Lira Ponceña.&quot; Most of his danzas were written for dancing. He modified his compositions so that they may also be played on piano. Morel Campos is best known for his danza compositions, but he also composed waltzes, operas, symphonies, marches and overtures.

Women and the theme of love inspired most of his musical compositions. His great love was a lady named Mercedes Arias, but her family did not approve of their relationship. It was from that frustrated &quot;love&quot; that many of Morel Campos&#x27;s beautiful &quot;danzas&quot; were born, with &quot;Maldito amor&quot; (Damned Love) as an example. Among his other best-known compositions were &quot;Felices días&quot; (Happy Days), &quot;No me toques&quot; (Do Not Touch Me), and &quot;Idilio&quot; (Idyll).

==Selection of Danzas by Morel Campos==

The following is a list of some of Morel Campos&#x27;s Danzas:
*Conversación (Conversation)
*Felices días (Happy Days)
*Idilio (Idyll)
*Maldito amor (Damned Love)
*No me toques (Do Not Touch Me)
*Sin tí jamás (Never without you)
*Sí, te toco (Yes, I will touch you)
*Sueño de amor (Dream of love)
*Ten piedad (Have pity)
*Tormento (Torment)
*Un conflicto (A conflict)
*Vano empeño (Trying in vain)

Domingo Cruz &quot;Cocolía&quot; became director of the Firefighters&#x27; Band upon the untimely death of Morel Campos.

==Later years==

Juan Morel Campos suffered a stroke on 26 April 1896 during a concert in Ponce. He died of the stroke soon thereafter on 16 May, in Ponce. In December 1926, his remains were buried on the pedestal of his statue in Plaza Las Delicias. His wife was Secundina Beltrán Collazo. Their children were Olimpia, Eugenia, Belén, Plácido, and Manuel.

<doc id="766159" wikidata="Q2611552" url="?curid=766159" title="National Defense Service Medal">
<text>The National Defense Service Medal (NDSM) is a service award of the United States Armed Forces established by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953. It was awarded to every member of the U.S. Armed Forces who served during any one of four specified periods of armed conflict or national emergency from June 27, 1950 through December 31, 2022. Combat or &quot;in theater&quot; service is not a requirement for the award.

==History==
The National Defense Service Medal (NDSM) was first intended to be a &quot;blanket campaign medal&quot; awarded to service members who served honorably during a designated time period of when a &quot;national emergency&quot; had been declared during a time of war or conflict. It may also be issued to active military members for any other period that the Secretary of Defense designates.

To date, the NDSM has been awarded for four specific time periods, which roughly correspond to the Korean War (1950–1954), Vietnam War (1961–1974), Gulf War (1990–1995), and the Global War on Terrorism (2001–2022).

===Establishment===
The NDSM was established by , issued by President Dwight Eisenhower, on April 22, 1953. While no document is known which explains the rationale for the award, it was apparently established to recognize all service members who served during the Korean War, to include those who did not serve in the war zone. (Service members who served in the war zone received the Korean Service Medal, established by President Harry S Truman in 1950.) Originally, awards of the NDSM were restricted to personnel serving on active duty and were retroactive to June 27, 1950 - the date the Korean War began.

===Design===
The Heraldic Division, Quartermaster General’s Office, of the U.S. Army was requested to provide designs for the NDSM. A design developed by T. H. Jones was submitted to the U.S. Army Assistant Chief of Staff for Personnel (G1) on 26 May 1953. A committee appointed by the Department of Defense, which included representatives of all services, met on 27 May 1953 and 3 June 1953 and selected Jones&#x27; design for final approval. An eagle holding a sword and an olive branch (on the obverse), together with the shield of the Coat of Arms of the United States (on the reverse), was used to symbolize the defense of the United States. The combination of oak and palm leaves around the shield signify strength and preparedness.

===Eligibility changes===
Eligibility for the NDSM was expanded by executive orders issued in 1966 (), 1991 () and 2003 ().

Executive Order 11265, dated January 11, 1966, extended eligibility for the NDSM to service members &quot;who served during any period after December 31, 1960, which the Secretary of Defense designates as being a period for which active military service merits special recognition.&quot; The closing date of this period of eligibility was later set at August 14, 1974 by a letter from the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, subject: Termination of Eligibility for the National Defense Service Medal, dated June 30, 1974.

The NDSM was again authorized by a memorandum, dated 20 February 1991, from Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney for active service on or after 2 August 1990 with no termination date established. Executive Order 12776 of October 8, 1991 extended eligibility for the NDSM to members of the Reserve Components during the period of the Gulf War. This eligibility period was later defined as from August 2, 1990 to November 30, 1995.

A memorandum from the Office of the Deputy Secretary of Defense, dated April 26, 2002, authorized the reinstatement of the NDSM for all active duty personnel retroactive to September 11, 2001. Executive Order 13293, dated March 28, 2003, amended EO 10448 to extend eligibility to all Selected Reserve personnel (i.e. actively drilling members of the reserve components to include the National Guard). As EO 13293 amended the EO which established the NDSM, this made Selected Reserve personnel from all previous eligibility periods eligible for the NDSM, to include those who served during the Korean and Vietnam eras.

On August 30, 2022, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin issued a memorandum stating that issue of the NDSM would be suspended after December 31, 2022.

===Status===
The National Defense Service Medal is the oldest service medal (as opposed to decorations for particular achievements such as valor or meritorious service and Good Conduct Medals) awarded by all branches of the United States Armed Forces. The only two older awarded service medals are the Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal, established in 1919, and the Navy Expeditionary Medal, established in 1936. The oldest awarded combat decoration is the Medal of Honor, which was established in 1862, and the oldest awarded non-combat decoration is the Army&#x27;s Distinguished Service Medal, established in 1918. The Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard and Army Good Conduct Medals were established in 1869, 1896, 1923 and 1941 respectively. The Selected Marine Corps Reserve Medal was established in 1925.

As the NDSM has been awarded to all military personnel during four wartime periods spanning 43 years, it has millions of recipients and is the most widely awarded medal in the history of the United States Armed Forces.

==Periods of eligibility==
The National Defense Service Medal is authorized for all active duty and Selected Reserve United States military personnel, regardless of length of service, with no requirement for overseas or combat service, for the following time periods:
==Award criteria==
The National Defense Service Medal (NDSM) is awarded to anyone who has served on active duty, or as an active reservist, in the United States Armed Forces during any of four specified time periods. Originally, reserve component service during the Korean and Vietnam periods of eligibility, other than those Reserve Component personnel in a full-time status or on active duty greater than 89 days, did not qualify for award of the NDSM. This was changed by Executive Order 13293, signed on 28 March 2003, to include Selected Reserve personnel (i.e. drilling reservists) during all periods of eligibility.

For service in the Persian Gulf War, members of the Reserve Components, to include the National Guard, were initially awarded the NDSM when called to active duty service, but this was later expanded to include all members of the Reserve or National Guard in good standing in the Selected Reserve during the eligibility period.

For service in the Global War on Terrorism, Selected Reserve and National Guard members need only to have been in good standing to receive the NDSM and no active duty service is required. Inactive Ready Reserve and Retired Reserve are not eligible to be awarded the NDSM unless called to active duty.

The medal is authorized to cadets and midshipmen at the military service academies after they are sworn into service, as well as pre-commission officer candidates/trainees at the Officer Candidate Schools or Officer Training Schools of the various U.S. Armed Forces; but is not granted to discharged or retired military personnel who did not serve in one of the above time periods; nor is it authorized for Reserve Officer Training Corps cadets and midshipmen at colleges and universities who enlisted in the inactive reserve (i.e., Obligated Reserve Section or ORS) during qualifying periods.

The NDSM ranks fourth out of twenty-nine in the order of precedence of service medals. There is no time requirement for the medal&#x27;s issuance, meaning that someone who joins the United States Armed Forces for simply a few days, and then receives an entry-level discharge, would technically be entitled to the NDSM; in practice, however, military clerks will not add the NDSM on a DD Form 214 if the service member performed duty for less than 90 days from the completion of their initial entry training. This accounts for the medal&#x27;s omission from many &quot;uncharacterized&quot; and &quot;entry level&quot; separation documents. Veterans who have this medal so omitted may apply to the military service departments to have the NDSM added to records via a DD Form 215.

==Additional awards==
Additional awards of the National Defense Service Medal are authorized for members of the military who served in more than one of the eligible time periods. Each additional award is denoted by a -inch bronze service star attached to the ribbon. A second award of the medal is not granted for reenlisting during the same time period or transferring between branches of service. 

Starting in 1966, when the NDSM was authorized for service in the Vietnam era, members of the U.S. Army who had received two NDSMs (i.e. for both the Korean and Vietnam eras), wore an oak leaf cluster on the ribbon, rather than a star (as was done by the other branches of service). 

Recipients of three NDSMs are uncommon, having served for at least 27 years (1974 to 2001) or 36 years (1954 to 1990) to qualify for a third medal. A recipient of the maximum of four NDSMs would have a career exceeding 47 years, inclusive of the years 1954 to 2001 (broken service would qualify).

<text>The North Umpqua River is a tributary of the Umpqua River, about long, in southwestern Oregon in the United States. It drains a scenic and rugged area of the Cascade Range southeast of Eugene, flowing through steep canyons and surrounded by large Douglas-fir forests. Renowned for its emerald green waters, it is considered one of the best fly fishing streams in the Pacific Northwest for anadromous fish.

==Description==
It rises in the high Cascades, issuing from Maidu Lake at elevation of in the Mount Thielsen Wilderness, along the Douglas-Klamath county line approximately east of Roseburg. It follows a serpentine course down from the Cascades, westward along the southern side of the Calapooya Mountains. Its upper course passes through the Umpqua National Forest, past Toketee Falls and Steamboat, where it receives Steamboat Creek from the north. It receives the Little River from the south at Glide (the confluence is known as the Colliding Rivers) and joins the South Umpqua from the east approximately northwest of Roseburg to form the Umpqua.

Facilities of the North Umpqua Hydroelectric Project are located along the river. It is impounded in its upper reaches in the Cascades to form Lemolo Lake for hydroelectricity. It is also impounded for hydroelectricity at Soda Springs Dam, forming a small reservoir on the upper river.

The river&#x27;s reputation as a world-class steelhead stream and its famous emerald waters are a result of the fact the river source is high enough in the Cascades to derive from snowmelt during the entire year. The melting snow is trapped in volcanic soil and pumice and released during the summer months, providing an even cool-temperature flow. During the summer the flow of the river is approximately 20 times that of the nearby South Umpqua. In its lower reaches, the river&#x27;s flow becomes increasingly erratic, in a manner typical of mountain streams of the region.

The region around the river has long been a timber-producing area. Starting in 1955, the watershed of the river was extensively clear cut, a practice which continued until 1969 when forestry management practices were changed. During this period many tributary streambeds were used as impromptu logging roads. The recovery of the river from these practices has been closely monitored by state and federal agencies.

==Recreation==
In 1988, the United States Congress designated of the river between the Soda Springs Powerhouse and Rock Creek as wild and scenic under the National Wild and Scenic River program. Angling on this part of the river, frequented by salmon and steelhead, is limited to fly fishing.

On the North Umpqua, rafters and kayakers find whitewater challenges from Class I (easy) through IV (advanced) on the International Scale of River Difficulty from May through the summer months. The North Umpqua Trail, which runs parallel to the river, supports hiking and biking.

==Tributaries==
Named tributaries of the North Umpqua River from source to mouth are Tolo and Bradley creeks and Spring River, then Lake, Poole, White Mule, Warm Spring, Nancy, Beverly, Helen, Norma, Dorothy, and Sally creeks. Then Potter, Nurse, Barkenburger, Patricia, Alvin, Charlia, Loafer, and Deer creeks, followed by the Clearwater River and Fish, Medicine, Boulder, Eagle, and Copeland creeks.

Below that come Dark Canyon, Wilson and Deception creeks, Dry Gulch, and Dry, Happy, Calf, Dog, Limpy, Apple, Jack, Redman, Steamboat, Alder, Fisher, Williams, and Timber creeks. Further downstream are Archie, Cougar, Bogus, John, Wright, Raspberry, Fairview, Fall, and Thunder creeks. Then Burnt, Swamp, Fox, Cole, Susan, Hogback, Bob, Honey, Clay, Hill, Rock, Britt, Old Hatchery, and French creeks. Little River is next, followed by Fordice, Huntley, Cooper, Oak, Clover, Dixon, and Sutherlin creeks.

<doc id="766186" wikidata="Q102379" url="?curid=766186" title="Paul Berg">
<text>Paul Berg (June 30, 1926 – February 15, 2023) was an American biochemist and professor at Stanford University.

He was the recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1980, along with Walter Gilbert and Frederick Sanger. The award recognized their contributions to basic research involving nucleic acids, especially recombinant DNA.

Berg received his undergraduate education at Penn State University, where he majored in biochemistry. He received his PhD in biochemistry from Case Western Reserve University in 1952. Berg worked as a professor at Washington University School of Medicine and Stanford University School of Medicine, in addition to serving as the director of the Beckman Center for Molecular and Genetic Medicine. 

In addition to the Nobel Prize, Berg was presented with the National Medal of Science in 1983 and the National Library of Medicine Medal in 1986. Berg was a member of the Board of Sponsors for the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Berg was born in Brooklyn, New York City. He was the son of a Russian Jewish immigrant couple, Sarah Brodsky, a homemaker, and Harry Berg, a clothing manufacturer. Berg graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School in 1943, received his Bachelor of Science degree in biochemistry from Penn State University in 1948 and PhD in biochemistry from Case Western Reserve University in 1952. He was a member of the Jewish fraternity, ΒΣΡ.

==Research and career==

===Academic posts===
After completing his graduate studies, Berg spent two years (1952–1954) as a postdoctoral fellow with the American Cancer Society, working at the Institute of Cytophysiology in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the Washington University School of Medicine, and spent additional time in 1954 as a scholar in cancer research with the department of microbiology at the Washington University School of Medicine. He worked with Arthur Kornberg, while at Washington University. Berg was also tenured as a research fellow at Clare Hall, Cambridge. He was a professor at Washington University School of Medicine from 1955 until 1959. After 1959, Berg moved to Stanford University, where he taught biochemistry from 1959 until 2000 and served as director of the Beckman Center for Molecular and Genetic Medicine from 1985 until 2000. In 2000 he retired from his administrative and teaching posts, continuing to be active in research.

===Research interests===
Berg&#x27;s postgraduate studies involved the use of radioisotope tracers to study intermediary metabolism. This resulted in the understanding of how foodstuffs are converted to cellular materials, through the use of isotopic carbons or heavy nitrogen atoms. Paul Berg&#x27;s doctorate paper is now known as the conversion of formic acid, formaldehyde and methanol to fully reduced states of methyl groups in methionine. He was also one of the first to demonstrate that folic acid and B12 cofactors had roles in the processes mentioned.

Berg is arguably most famous for his pioneering work involving gene splicing of recombinant DNA. Berg was the first scientist to create a molecule containing DNA from two different species by inserting DNA from another species into a molecule. This gene-splicing technique was a fundamental step in the development of modern genetic engineering. After developing the technique, Berg used it for his studies of viral chromosomes.

Berg was a professor emeritus at Stanford. As of 2000, he stopped doing active research, to focus on other interests, including involvement in public policy for biomedical issues involving recombinant DNA and embryonic stem cells and publishing a book about geneticist George Beadle.

Berg was a member of the Board of Sponsors of the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot;. He was also an organizer of the Asilomar conference on recombinant DNA in 1975. The previous year, Berg and other scientists had called for a voluntary moratorium on certain recombinant DNA research until they could evaluate the risks. That influential conference did evaluate the potential hazards and set guidelines for biotechnology research. It can be seen as an early application of the precautionary principle.

===Awards and honors===
====Nobel Prize====
Berg was awarded one-half of the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, with the other half being shared by Walter Gilbert and Frederick Sanger. Berg was recognized for &quot;his fundamental studies of the biochemistry of nucleic acids, with particular regard to recombinant DNA&quot;, while Sanger and Gilbert were honored for &quot;their contributions concerning the determination of base sequences in nucleic acids.&quot;

====Other awards and honors====
He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1966. In 1983, Ronald Reagan presented Berg with the National Medal of Science. That same year, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. In 1989, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1992. In 2005 he was awarded the Biotechnology Heritage Award by the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) and the Chemical Heritage Foundation. In 2006 he received Wonderfest&#x27;s Carl Sagan Prize for Science Popularization.

==Death==
Berg died on February 15, 2023, at the age of 96.

<text>Maidu Lake is a small natural freshwater lake in the Cascade Range in eastern Douglas County in the U.S. state of Oregon. It is in the Mount Thielsen Wilderness of the Umpqua National Forest, about west of the community of Chemult.

The lake, at above sea level, is the source of the North Umpqua River. The eastern terminus of the North Umpqua Trail, which follows the river, is at Maidu Lake. A connecting trail continues east, intersecting the Pacific Crest Trail between Maidu Lake and Miller Lake.

Maidu Lake supports brook trout ranging in size to upwards of . The lake is periodically re-stocked by volunteers, who bring in hatchery fingerlings by horseback.

<text>Under the French Ancien Régime, a parlement () was a provincial appellate court of the Kingdom of France. In 1789, France had 13 &quot;parlements&quot;, the original and most important of which was the &quot;Parlement&quot; of Paris. Though both the modern French term &quot;parlement&quot; (for the legislature) and the English word &quot;parliament&quot; derive from this French term, the Ancien Régime parlements were not legislative bodies and the modern and ancient terminology are not interchangeable.

==History==
Parlements were judicial organizations consisting of a dozen or more appellate judges, or about 1,100 judges nationwide. They were the courts of final appeal of the judicial system, and typically wielded power over a wide range of subjects, particularly taxation. Laws and edicts issued by the Crown were not official in their respective jurisdictions until the parlements gave their assent by publishing them.

The members of the parlements were aristocrats, called nobles of the robe, who had bought or inherited their offices, and were independent of the King.

Sovereign councils () with analogous attributes, more rarely called high councils () or in one instance sovereign court (), were created in new territories (notably in New France). Some of these were eventually replaced by parlements (e.g. the Sovereign Council of Navarre and Béarn and the Sovereign Court of Lorraine and Barrois). As noted by James Stephen:

From 1770 to 1774 the Chancellor of France, Maupeou, tried to abolish the Parlement of Paris in order to strengthen the Crown. However, when King Louis XV died in 1774, the parlements were reinstated. The parlements spearheaded the aristocracy&#x27;s resistance to the absolutism and centralization of the Crown, but they worked primarily for the benefit of their own class, the French nobility. Alfred Cobban argues that the parlements were the chief obstacles to any reform before the Revolution, as well as the most formidable enemies of the French Crown. He concludes that the

In November 1789, early in the French Revolution, all the parlements were suspended.

==Name==

The Old French word &quot;parlement&quot; is derived from the verb &quot;parler&quot; (&#x27;to speak&#x27;) + suffix &quot;-(e)ment&quot;, and originally meant a &quot;speaking&quot;. It is attested with the meaning of &quot;deliberating assembly&quot; as early as , and passed into English with this meaning. The meaning then became more specialized in French during the 13th century, to refer to the &quot;&quot;curia regis&quot; in judicial session; sovereign court of justice&quot; until the end of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;. (The sense of &quot;legislative assembly&quot; or &quot;legislative body&quot; was used in English, &quot;parliament,&quot; in the 14th century.)

==Origin==
The first parlement in Ancien Régime France developed in the 13th century out of the King&#x27;s Council (, ), and consequently enjoyed ancient, customary consultative and deliberative prerogatives.
Philippe le Bel was the first to fix this court to Paris, in 1302, officially severing it from the King&#x27;s Council in 1307. The Parlement of Paris would hold sessions inside the medieval royal palace on the Île de la Cité, nowadays still the site in Paris of the Hall of Justice. The parlement also had the duty to record all royal edicts and laws. By the 15th century the Parlement of Paris had a right of &quot;remonstrance to the king&quot; (a formal statement of grievances), which was at first simply of an advisory nature.

In the meantime, the jurisdiction of the Parlement of Paris had been covering the entire kingdom as it was in the 14th century, but did not automatically advance in step with the Crown&#x27;s ever expanding realm. In 1443, following the turmoil of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, King Charles VII of France granted Languedoc its own parlement by establishing the Parlement of Toulouse, the first parlement outside Paris; its jurisdiction extended over most of southern France. From 1443 until the French Revolution, several other parlements would be steadily created all over France ; these locations were provincial capitals of those provinces with strong historical traditions of independence before they were annexed to France (in some of these regions, provincial States-General also continued to meet and legislate with a measure of self-governance and control over taxation within their jurisdiction).

===16th and 17th centuries===
Over time, some parlements, especially the one in Paris, gradually acquired the habit of using their right of remonstrance to refuse to register legislation, which they adjudged as either untimely or contrary to the local customary law (and there were 300 customary law jurisdictions), until the king held a &quot;lit de justice&quot; or sent a &quot;lettre de jussion&quot; to force them to act. By the 16th century, the parlement judges were of the opinion that their role included active participation in the legislative process, which brought them into increasing conflict with the ever increasing monarchical absolutism of the Ancien Régime, as the &quot;lit de justice&quot; evolved during the 16th century from a constitutional forum to a royal weapon, used to force registration of edicts. The transmission of judicial offices had also been a common practice in France since the late Middle Ages; tenure on the court was generally bought from the royal authority; and such official positions could be made hereditary by paying a tax to the King called &quot;la paulette&quot;. Assembled in the parlements, the largely hereditary members, the provincial nobles of the robe were the strongest decentralizing force in a France that was more multifarious in its legal systems, taxation, and custom than it might have seemed under the apparent unifying rule of its kings. Nevertheless, the Parlement of Paris had the largest jurisdiction of all the parlements, covering the major part of northern and central France, and was simply known as &quot;the parlement&quot;.

====The Fronde====
The Parlement of Paris played a major role in stimulating the nobility to resist the expansion of royal power by military force during the Fronde, 1648–1649. In the end, King Louis XIV won out and the nobility was humiliated.
The parlements&#x27; ability to withhold their assent by formulating remonstrances against the king&#x27;s edicts forced the king to react, sometimes resulting in repeated resistance by the parlements, which the king could only terminate in his favour by issuing a &quot;lettre de jussion&quot;, and, in case of continued resistance, appearing in person in the parlement: the &quot;lit de justice&quot;. In such a case, the parlement&#x27;s powers were suspended for the duration of this royal session. King Louis XIV moved to centralize authority into his own hands, imposing certain restrictions on the parlements: in 1665, he ordained that a &quot;lit de justice&quot; could be held without the king having to appear in person; in 1667, he limited the number of remonstrances to only one. In 1671–1673, however, the parlements resisted the taxes needed to fund the Franco-Dutch War. In 1673, the king imposed additional restrictions that stripped the parlements of any influence upon new laws by ordaining that remonstrances could only be issued after registration of the edicts. After Louis&#x27; death in 1715, all the restrictions were discontinued by the regent, although some of the judges of the Parlement of Paris accepted royal bribes to restrain that body until the 1750s.

===Role leading to the French Revolution===

After 1715, during the reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI, the parlements repeatedly challenged the crown for control over policy, especially regarding taxes and religion. Furthermore, the parlements had taken the habit of passing &quot;arrêts de règlement&quot;, which were laws or regulatory decrees that applied within their jurisdiction for the application of royal edicts or of customary practices. At a session of the Parlement of Paris in 1766 known as the Flagellation Session, Louis XV asserted that sovereign power resided in his person only.

In the years immediately before the start of the French Revolution in 1789, their extreme concern to preserve Ancien Régime institutions of noble privilege prevented France from carrying out many simple reforms, especially in the area of taxation, even when those reforms had the support of the king.

Chancellor René Nicolas de Maupeou sought to reassert royal power by suppressing the parlements in 1770. His famous attempts, known as Maupeou&#x27;s Reform, resulted in a furious battle and failure. Parlements were disbanded and their members arrested. After Louis XV died, the parlements were restored.

The beginning of the proposed radical changes began with the protests of the Parlement of Paris addressed to Louis XVI in March 1776, in which the Second Estate, the nobility, resisted the beginning of certain reforms that would remove their privileges, notably their exemption from taxes. The objections were made in reaction to the essay, &quot;Réflexions sur la formation et la distribution des richesses&quot; (&quot;Reflections on the Formation and Distribution of Wealth&quot;) by Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot. The Second Estate reacted to the essay with anger to convince the king that the nobility still served a very important role and still deserved the same privileges of tax exemption as well as for the preservation of the guilds and corporations put in place to restrict trade, both of which were eliminated in the reforms proposed by Turgot.

In their remonstrance against the edict suppressing the corvée (March 1776), the Parlement of Paris – afraid that a new tax would replace the corvée, and that this tax would apply to all, introducing equality as a principle – dared to remind the king:

The Second Estate (the nobility) consisted of approximately 1.5% of France&#x27;s population, and was exempt from almost all taxes, including the Corvée Royale, which was a recent mandatory service in which the roads would be repaired and built by those subject to the corvée. In practice, anyone who paid a small fee could escape the corvée, so this burden of labor fell only to the poorest in France. The Second Estate was also exempt from the &quot;gabelle&quot;, which was the unpopular tax on salt, and also the &quot;taille&quot;, a land tax paid by peasants, and the oldest form of taxation in France.

The Second Estate feared that it would have to pay the tax replacing the suppressed corvée. The nobles saw this tax as especially humiliating and below them, as they took great pride in their titles and their lineage, which often included those who had died in the defense of France. They saw this elimination of tax privilege as the gateway for more attacks on their rights and urged Louis XVI throughout the protests of the Parlement of Paris not to enact the proposed reforms.

These exemptions, as well as the right to wear a sword and their coat of arms, encouraged the idea of a natural superiority over the commoners that was common through the Second Estate, and as long as any noble was in possession of a fiefdom, he could collect a tax on the Third Estate called feudal dues, which would allegedly be for the Third Estate&#x27;s protection (though this only applied to serfs and tenants of farmland owned by the nobility). Overall, the Second Estate had vast privileges that the Third Estate did not possess, which in effect protected the Second Estate&#x27;s wealth and property, while hindering the Third Estate&#x27;s ability to advance. The reforms proposed by Turgot and argued against in the protests of the Parlement of Paris conflicted with the Second Estates&#x27; interests to keep their hereditary privileges, and was the first step toward reform that seeped into the political arena. Turgot&#x27;s reforms were unpopular among the commoners as well, who saw the parlements as their best defense against the power of the monarchy.

==Judicial proceedings==
In civil trials, judges had to be paid &quot;épices&quot; (literally &quot;spices&quot; – fees) by the parties, to pay for legal advice taken by the judges, and the costs of their staff. Judges were not allowed to ask for, or receive, épices from the poor.

Regarding criminal justice, the proceedings were markedly archaic. Judges could order suspects to be tortured in order to extract confessions or induce them to reveal the names of their accomplices: there were the &quot;question ordinaire&quot; (&quot;ordinary questioning&quot;), the ordinary form of torture, and the &quot;question extraordinaire&quot; (&quot;extraordinary questioning&quot;), with increased brutality. There was little presumption of innocence if the suspect was a mere poor commoner. The death sentence could be pronounced for a variety of crimes including mere theft; depending on the crime and the social class of the victim, death could be by decapitation with a sword (for nobles), hanging (for most of the secondary crimes by commoners), the breaking wheel (for some heinous crimes by commoners). Some crimes, such as regicide, exacted even more horrific punishment, as drawing and quartering. With the spread of enlightenment ideas throughout France, most forms of judicial torture had fallen out of favor, and while they remained on the books, were rarely applied after 1750.

Ultimately, judicial torture and cruel methods of executions were abolished in 1788 by King Louis XVI.

==Abolition==

The parlements were abolished by the National Constituent Assembly on 6 September 1790. The behavior of the parlements is one of the reasons that since the French Revolution, French courts have been forbidden by Article 5 of the French civil code to create law and act as legislative bodies, their only mandate being to interpret the law. France, through the Napoleonic Code, was at the origin of the modern system of civil law, in which precedents are not as powerful as in countries of common law. The origin of the separation of powers in the French court system, with no rule of precedent outside the interpretation of the law, no single supreme court and no constitutional review of statutes by courts until 1971 (by action, before the Constitutional Council of France created in 1958) and 2010 (by exception, before any court) is usually traced to that hostility towards &quot;government by judges&quot;.

<doc id="766192" wikidata="Q202375" url="?curid=766192" title="PC Engine SuperGrafx">
<text>The , also known as simply the SuperGrafx, is a fourth-generation home video game console manufactured by NEC Home Electronics and released in Japan in 1989. It is the successor system to the PC Engine, released two years prior. Originally known as the PC Engine 2 during production stages, it was purported as a true 16-bit home console, featuring improved graphics and audio capabilities over its predecessor.

The console was rushed to market, released several months before its initial intended release date in 1990, only having modest updates to the hardware. With only six retail games released that took advantage of the console&#x27;s hardware updates, the SuperGrafx was a commercial failure, selling only 75,000 units total. None of the hardware advancements it possessed were carried over to later PC Engine models, such as the Duo &amp; the LD-ROM² PAC for the LaserActive.

==Hardware==
Compared to the PC Engine, the SuperGrafx has four times the amount of working RAM for the main CPU. Its main upgrade is an additional video chip with its own video RAM, with a priority controller chip, which allows the output of both video chips to be combined in various ways. This gives the SuperGrafx twice as many on-screen sprites as the original PC Engine and support for two independently scrolling background layers opposed to the PC Engine&#x27;s single layer.

Since the SuperGrafx was produced and marketed as an upgraded PC Engine model rather than as a new platform, it was backwards compatible with standard PC Engine HuCards in addition to its own. However, SuperGrafx-specific HuCards were expensive compared to standard HuCards, in some cases approaching as much as $110 USD at retail.

The SuperGrafx is also compatible with the CD-ROM² System add-on (via the ROM² Adaptor), as well as the Super CD-ROM² add-on. No CD-ROM² format games were produced that took advantage of the SuperGrafx&#x27;s added capabilities.

==Technical specifications==

===CPU===

The CPU was an 8-bit HuC6280A, a modified 65SC02, running at 1.79, or 7.16 MHz (switchable by software). Features included integrated bankswitching hardware (driving a 21-bit external address bus from a 6502-compatible 16-bit address bus), an integrated general-purpose I/O port, a timer, block transfer instructions, and dedicated move instructions for communicating with the HuC6270A VDC.

===Memory===
There was 32 KB of work RAM and 128 KB (64 KB per HuC6270A VDC) Video RAM.

===Display subsystem===

The display subsystem was composed of two 16-bit HuC6270A Video Display Controllers (VDCs), one HuC6202 Video Priority Controller, and one HuC6260 Video Color Encoder (VCE). The HuC6270A featured Port-based I/O similar to the TMS99xx VDP family.

The X (Horizontal) Resolution was variable, maximum of 565 pixels (programmable to 282, 377 or 565 pixels, or as 5.37mhz, 7.159mhz, and 10.76mhz pixel dot clock). Taking into consideration overscan limitations of CRT televisions at the time, the horizontal resolutions were realistically limited to something a bit less than what the system was actually capable of. Consequently, most game developers limited their games to either 256, 336, or 512 pixels in display width for each of the three modes.
The Y (Vertical) Resolution was also variable, maximum of 242 (programmable in increments of 1 scanline).

Color had a depth of 9 bits with 512 colors available with up to 512 colors on screen (241 background and 240 sprite colors from each of the two VDCs). There were 32 palettes in total: 16 for background tiles and 16 for sprites. Each sprite palette could have 15 colors defined, and had one transparent color index; and each background tile palette could have 15 colors defined, plus one color index whose color was a color that was shared across all background tile palettes.

128 sprites were simultaneously displayable with sizes of: 16×16, 16×32, 16×64, 32×16, 32×32, 32×64. Each sprite can use up to 15 unique colors (one color must be reserved as transparent) via one of the 16 available sprite palettes. The dual HuC6270A VDCs are capable of displaying 2 sprite layers (1 each). Sprites could be placed either in front of or behind background tiles. Each layer can display 16 sprites or 256 sprite pixels per scanline, giving the combined sprite per scanline limit of 32 sprites or 512 sprite pixels.

Tiles were 8x8 with each background tile able to use up to 16 unique colors via one of the 16 available background palettes. The first color entry of each background palette must be the same across all background palettes.

===Audio capacity===
Six Wavetable Synthesis audio channels, programmable through the HuC6280A CPU.
Each channel had a frequency of 111.87 kHz for single cycle of 32 samples (while not in D/A mode) with a bit depth of 5 bits. Each channel also was allotted 20 bytes (32×5 bits) of RAM for sample data.
The waveforms were programmable so the composers were not limited to the standard selection of waveforms (square, sine, sawtooth, triangle, etc.). But the use of standard waveforms, and semi-standard forms, such as a 25% pulse wave were used fairly often.
The first two audio channels (1 and 2) were capable of LFO when channel #2 was used to modulate channel #1.

Optional software enabled Direct D/A which allows for sampled sound to be streamed into any of the six PSG audio channels. When a channel is in D/A mode the frequency is as fast as the CPU can stream bytes to the port, though in practicality it is limited to 6.99 kHz when using the TIMER interrupt with its smallest loop setting (1023 cpu cycles) or 15.7 kHz using the scanline interrupt.
There is a method that combines two channels in DDA mode to play back 8-bit, 9-bit, or 10-bit samples.
The addition of the CD-ROM peripheral adds CD-DA sound, and a single ADPCM channel to the existing sound capabilities of the PC Engine.

===Software media===
The SuperGrafx is backwards compatible with all standard PC Engine HuCard-format games in addition to its own. The labels on SuperGrafx HuCards were upside-down relative to standard HuCards; A standard HuCard will read upside down on a SuperGrafx, while its own are right-side-up. The SuperGrafx is also compatible with the CD-ROM² and Super CD-ROM² System add-ons, allowing it to play any CD-ROM² format game with the required System Card. No SuperGrafx-specific CD-ROM² titles were produced.

==Peripherals==
The SuperGrafx is compatible with all standard PC Engine input devices, such as the TurboPad and the Multitap.

The ROM² Adaptor (RAU-30) was an adapter released in Japan on 20 April 1990 that allows the SuperGrafx unit to be connected into the CD-ROM² System Interface Unit. This was not required for the later Super CD-ROM² System add-on.

Power Console (PI-PD7) was an unreleased cockpit-sized controller that attaches onto the SuperGrafx unit itself, connecting via the expansion port on the front side. The peripheral would have added numerous control options such as an eight-way joystick, four action buttons, a flight yoke with two triggers (one on each handle), a throttle lever, a jog dial, three mode switches, an LCD panel, an LED indicator, four additional controller ports and a numerical keypad. The Power Console was scheduled to be released in Spring 1990 with a suggested retail price of 59,800 yen, but was never released due to its high production cost and the poor sales of the SuperGrafx itself.

==Software==

There were only five SuperGrafx-specific HuCards produced.
*&quot;1941: Counter Attack&quot;
*&quot;Aldynes&quot;
*&quot;Battle Ace&quot;
*&quot;Daimakaimura&quot;
*&quot;Madö King Granzört&quot;

In addition to these fives games, NEC Avenue also released &quot;Darius Plus&quot; as a standard PC Engine HuCard that offered slight enhancements when played on a SuperGrafx console. As such, it was the only commercially-released HuCard game to carry the PC-SG mark. A special version of &quot;Darius Plus&quot;, titled &quot;Darius Alpha&quot;, was also released as a sweepstakes giveaway, which was limited to 800 copies that were distributed on a weekly basis from 21 September through 16 November 1990.

Many of the games that were announced for the PC Engine SuperGrafx were either canceled or repurposed into other formats. One notable example was the PC Engine port of &quot;Strider Hiryu&quot;, which was initially announced as a SuperGrafx title, but was ultimately released as an Arcade CD-ROM² disc.

<doc id="766195" wikidata="Q770625" url="?curid=766195" title="Augustus Saint-Gaudens">
<text>Augustus Saint-Gaudens (; March 1, 1848 – August 3, 1907) was an Irish and American sculptor of the Beaux-Arts generation who embodied the ideals of the American Renaissance. Saint-Gaudens was born in Dublin to an Irish-French family, and raised in New York City. He traveled to Europe for further training and artistic study. After he returned to New York City, he achieved major critical success for his monuments commemorating heroes of the American Civil War, many of which still stand. Saint-Gaudens created works such as the &quot;Robert Gould Shaw Memorial&quot; on Boston Common, &quot;Abraham Lincoln: The Man&quot;, and grand equestrian monuments to Civil War generals: &quot;General John Logan Memorial&quot; in Chicago&#x27;s Grant Park and &quot;William Tecumseh Sherman&quot; at the corner of New York&#x27;s Central Park. In addition, he created the popular historicist representation of &quot;The Puritan&quot;.

Saint-Gaudens also created Classical works such as the &quot;Diana&quot;, and employed his design skills in numismatics. He designed the $20 Saint Gaudens Double Eagle gold piece (1905–1907) for the US Mint, considered one of the most beautiful American coins ever issued, and the $10 &quot;Indian Head&quot; gold eagle; both of these were minted from 1907 until 1933. In his later years he founded the &quot;Cornish Colony&quot;, an artist&#x27;s colony in New Hampshire that included notable painters, sculptors, writers, and architects. His brother Louis Saint-Gaudens, with whom he occasionally collaborated, was also a well-known sculptor.

==Early life and career==
Saint-Gaudens was born in Dublin, Ireland, to an Irish mother and French father, Bernard Paul Ernest Saint-Gaudens, a shoemaker by trade from a village in the French Pyrenees, Aspet, 15 kilometers from Saint-Gaudens. His parents emigrated to America when he was six months of age, and he was reared in New York City.

In 1861, he became an apprentice to a cameo-cutter, Louis Avet, and took evening art classes at the Cooper Union in New York City. Two years later, he was hired as an apprentice of Jules Le Brethon, another cameo cutter, and enrolled at the National Academy of Design. His apprenticeship was completed by the age of 19 and he traveled to Paris in 1867, where he studied in the atelier of François Jouffroy at the École des Beaux-Arts.

In 1870, he left Paris for Rome to study art and architecture, and worked on his first commissions. There he met a deaf American art student, Augusta Fisher Homer. They married on June 1, 1877. The couple had one child, a son named Homer Saint-Gaudens.

In 1874, Edwards Pierrepont, a prominent New York reformer, hired Saint-Gaudens to create a marble bust of himself. Pierrepont, a phrenologist, proved to be a demanding client, insisting that Saint-Gaudens make his head larger. Saint-Gaudens said that Pierrepont&#x27;s bust &quot;seemed to be affected with some dreadful swelling disease&quot; and he later told a friend that he would &quot;give anything to get hold of that bust and smash it to atoms&quot;.

In 1876, he won a commission for a bronze David Farragut Memorial. He rented a studio at 49 rue Notre Dame des Champs. Stanford White designed the pedestal. It was unveiled on May 25, 1881, in Madison Square Park. He collaborated with Stanford White again in 1892–94 when he created &quot;Diana&quot; as a weather vane for the second Madison Square Garden building in New York City; a second version used is now in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, with several reduced versions in museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The statue stood on a 300-foot-high tower, making &quot;Diana&quot; the highest point in the city. It was also the first statue in that part of Manhattan to be lit at night by electricity. The statue and its tower was a landmark until 1925 when the building was demolished.

In New York, he was a member of the Tile Club, a group of prominent artists and writers, including Winslow Homer (his wife&#x27;s fourth cousin), William Merritt Chase and Arthur Quartley. He was also a member of The Lambs, Salmagundi Club and the National Arts Club in New York City.

==Civil War commemorative commissions==

In 1876, Saint-Gaudens received his first major commission: a monument to Civil War Admiral David Farragut, in New York&#x27;s Madison Square; his friend Stanford White designed an architectural setting for it, and when it was unveiled in 1881, its naturalism, its lack of bombast and its siting combined to make it a tremendous success, and Saint-Gaudens&#x27; reputation was established.

The commissions followed fast, including the colossal &quot;Abraham Lincoln: The Man&quot; in Lincoln Park, Chicago in a setting by architect White, 1884–1887, considered the finest portrait statue in the United States (a replica was placed at Lincoln&#x27;s tomb in Springfield, Illinois, and another stands in Parliament Square, London). The statue was highly influential for American artists and received widespread praise by critics.

A long series of memorials, funerary monuments and busts, including the Adams Memorial, the Peter Cooper Monument at Cooper Square, and the John A. Logan Monument. Arguably the greatest of these monuments is the bronze bas-relief that forms the &quot;Robert Gould Shaw Memorial&quot; on Boston Common, 1884–1897, which Saint-Gaudens labored on for 14 years; even after the public version had been unveiled, he continued with further versions. Two grand equestrian monuments to Civil War generals are outstanding: to General John A. Logan, atop a tumulus in Chicago, 1894–1897, and to &quot;William Tecumseh Sherman&quot; at the corner of Central Park in New York (with the African-American model Hettie Anderson posing as an allegorical Victory), 1892–1903, the first use of Robert Treat Paine&#x27;s pointing device for the accurate mechanical enlargement of sculpture models. The depictions of the African-American soldiers on the Shaw memorial is noted as a rare example of true-to-life, non-derogatory, depictions of African physical characteristics in 19th-century American art.

For the Lincoln Centennial of 1909, Saint-Gaudens produced another statue of the president. A seated figure, &quot;Abraham Lincoln: The Head of State,&quot; is in Chicago&#x27;s Grant Park. Saint-Gaudens completed the design work and had begun casting the statue at the time of his death—his workshop completed it. The statue&#x27;s head was used as the model for the commemorative postage stamp issued on the 100th anniversary of Lincoln&#x27;s birth.

==Other works==

Saint-Gaudens also created the statue for the monument of Charles Stewart Parnell, which was installed at the north end of Dublin&#x27;s O&#x27;Connell Street, backing on to Parnell Square in 1911.

In 1887, when Robert Louis Stevenson made his second trip to the United States, Saint-Gaudens had the opportunity to make the preliminary sketches for a five-year project of a medallion depicting Stevenson, in very poor health at the time, propped in bed writing. With minor modifications, this medallion was reproduced for the Stevenson memorial in St. Giles&#x27; Cathedral, Edinburgh. Stevenson&#x27;s cousin and biographer, Graham Balfour, deemed the work &quot;the most satisfactory of all the portraits of Stevenson&quot;. Balfour also noted that Saint-Gaudens greatly admired Stevenson and had once said he would &quot;gladly go a thousand miles for the sake of a sitting&quot; with him.[2]

Saint-Gaudens was also commissioned by a variety of groups to create medals including varied commemorative themes like The Women&quot;s Auxiliary of the Massachusetts Civil Service Reform Association Presentation Medal and the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition Medal. Such pieces stand testament to both his broad appeal and the respect that was given to him by his contemporaries.

A statue of philanthropist Robert Randall stands in the gardens of Sailors&#x27; Snug Harbor in New York. A statue of copper king Marcus Daly is at the entrance of the Montana School of Mines on the west end of Park St. in Butte, Montana. A statue of former United States Congressman and New York Governor Roswell Pettibone Flower was dedicated in 1902 in Watertown, New York.

==Teacher and advisor==

Saint-Gaudens&#x27; prominence brought him students, and he was an able and sensitive teacher. He tutored young artists privately, taught at the Art Students League of New York, and took on a large number of assistants. He was an artistic advisor to the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893, an avid supporter of the American Academy in Rome, and part of the McMillan Commission, which brought into being L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s long-ignored master plan for the nation&#x27;s capital.

Through his career Augustus Saint-Gaudens made a specialty of intimate private portrait panels in sensitive, very low relief, which owed something to the Florentine Renaissance. It was felt he heavily influenced another Irish American sculptor, Jerome Connor.

Over the course of his long career Saint-Gaudens employed, and by doing so, trained, some of the next generation&#x27;s finest sculptors. These included James Earle Fraser, Frances Grimes, Henry Hering, Charles Keck, Mary Lawrence, Frederick MacMonnies, Philip Martiny, Helen Mears, Robert Paine, Alexander Phimister Proctor, Louis Saint-Gaudens, Elsie Ward and Adolph Alexander Weinman.

New York City&#x27;s PS40 is named after Saint-Gaudens.

==Coinage==

Saint-Gaudens referred to his early relief portraits as &quot;medallions&quot; and took a great interest in the art of the coin: his $20 gold piece, the double eagle coin he designed for the US Mint, 1905–1907, though it was adapted for minting, is still considered one of the most beautiful American coins ever issued.

Chosen by Theodore Roosevelt to redesign the coinage of the nation at the beginning of the 20th century, Saint-Gaudens produced an ultra high-relief $20 gold piece that was adapted into a flattened-down version by the United States Mint. The ultra high-relief coin took up to 11 strikes to bring up the details, and only 20 or so of these coins were minted in 1907. The Ultra High Reliefs did not stack properly and were deemed unfit for commerce. They are highly sought-after today; one sold in a 2005 auction for $2,990,000. The coin was then adapted into the High relief version, which, although requiring eight fewer strikes than the Ultra High Relief coins, was still deemed impractical for commerce. 12,317 of these were minted, and are currently among the most in-demand U.S. coins. The coin was finally modified to a normal-relief version, which was minted from 1907 to 1933. This design (an &quot;ultra-high relief&quot; $20) was successfully minted in 24 karat gold; 115,178 coins were produced. This coin was issued by the U.S. Mint in 2009.

==Later life and the Cornish Colony==


Diagnosed with cancer in 1900, Saint-Gaudens decided to live at his Federal house with barn-studio set in the handsome gardens he had made, where he and his family had been spending summers since 1885, in Cornish, New Hampshire – though not in retirement. Despite waning energy, he continued to work, producing a steady stream of reliefs and public sculpture. In 1901, he was appointed a member of the Senate Park, or McMillan, Commission for the redesign of Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Mall and its larger park system, along with architects Daniel Burnham and Charles Follen McKim, and landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.; in 1902, the Commission published their report, popularly known as the McMillan Plan. In 1904, he was one of the first seven chosen for membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters. That same year the large studio burned, with the irreplaceable loss of the sculptor&#x27;s correspondence, his sketchbooks, and many works in progress.

The Cornish Art Colony Saint-Gaudens and his brother Louis attracted made for a dynamic social and creative environment. The most famous included painters Maxfield Parrish and Kenyon Cox, architect and garden designer Charles A. Platt, and sculptor Paul Manship. Included were painters Thomas Dewing, George de Forest Brush, dramatist Percy MacKaye, the American novelist Winston Churchill, and the sculptor Louis St. Gaudens, Augustus&#x27;s brother. After his death in 1907, it slowly dissipated. His house and gardens are now preserved as the Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site.

Saint-Gaudens was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1896. In 1901, the French government made him an Officier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur. In 1920, Saint-Gaudens was posthumously elected to the Hall of Fame for Great Americans. In 1940, his image appeared on a U.S. postage stamp in the &quot;Famous Americans&quot; series.

Saint-Gaudens and his wife figure prominently in the 2011 book &quot;The Greater Journey: Americans in Paris&quot; by historian David McCullough. In interviews upon the book&#x27;s release, McCullough said the letters of Augusta Saint-Gaudens to her friends and family in the United States were among the richest primary sources he discovered in years of research into the lives of the American community in Paris in the late 19th century.

==Legacy and honors==
During World War II the Liberty ship was built in Panama City, Florida, and named in his honor.

In 1940, the U.S. Post Office issued a series of 35 postage stamps, &#x27;The Famous American Series&#x27; honoring America&#x27;s famous artists, poets, educators, authors, scientists, composers and inventors. The renowned sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens was among those chosen for the &#x27;Artists&#x27; category of this series and appears on this stamp, which was first issued in New York City on September 16, 1940.

New York City&#x27;s PS40 is named after Saint-Gaudens.

<doc id="766202" wikidata="Q247978" url="?curid=766202" title="Anisometropia">
<text>Anisometropia is a condition in which a person&#x27;s eyes have substantially differing refractive power. Generally, a difference in power of one diopter (1D) is the threshold for diagnosis of the condition. Patients may have up to 3 diopters of anisometropia before the condition becomes clinically significant due to headache, eye strain, double vision or photophobia.

In certain types of anisometropia, the visual cortex of the brain cannot process images from both eyes simultaneously (binocular summation), but will instead suppress the central vision of one of the eyes. If this occurs too often during the first 10 years of life, while the visual cortex is developing, it can result in amblyopia, a condition where, even when correcting the refractive error properly, the person&#x27;s vision in the affected eye may still not be fully correctable to 20/20.

The name of the condition comes from its four Greek components: &quot;an-&quot; &quot;not&quot;, &quot;iso-&quot; &quot;same&quot;, &quot;metr-&quot; &quot;measure&quot;, &quot;ops&quot; &quot;eye&quot;.

Antimetropia is a rare sub-type of anisometropia in which one eye is myopic (nearsighted) and the other eye is hyperopic (farsighted). This condition occurs in about 0.1% of the population.

==Causes==

Anisometropia is caused by common refractive errors, such as astigmatism, far-sightedness, and myopia, in one eye.

Anisometropia is likely the result of both genetic and environmental influences.

Some studies suggest, in older adults, developing asymmetric cataracts may cause worsen anisometropia. However, anisometropia is associated with age regardless of cataract development: a rapid decrease in anisometropia during the first years of life, an increase during the transition to adulthood, relatively unchanging levels during adulthood but significant increases in older age.

==Diagnosis==
Anisometropia causes some people to have mild vision problems, or occasionally more serious symptoms like alternating vision or frequent squinting. However, since most people do not show any clear symptoms, the condition usually is found during a routine eye exam.

For early detection in preverbal children, photoscreening can be used. In this brief vision test specialized cameras detect each eye&#x27;s light reflexes, which the equipment&#x27;s software or a test administrator then interprets. If photoscreening indicates the presence of risk factors, an ophthalmologist can then diagnose the condition after a complete eye exam, including dilating the pupils and measuring the focusing power of each eye.

== Treatment ==

=== Spectacle correction ===
For those with large degrees of anisometropia, the wearing of standard spectacles may cause the person to experience a difference in image magnification between the two eyes (aniseikonia) which could also prevent the development of good binocular vision. This can make it very difficult to wear glasses without symptoms such as headaches and eyestrain. However, the earlier the condition is treated, the easier it is to adjust to glasses.

It is possible for spectacle lenses to be made which can adjust the image sizes presented to the eye to be approximately equal. These are called iseikonic lenses. In practice though, this is rarely ever done.

The formula for iseikonic lenses (without cylinder) is:

: formula_1

where: &lt;br&gt;
&quot;t&quot; = center thickness (in metres);&lt;br&gt;
&quot;n&quot; = refractive index;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;P&quot; = front base curve (in 1/metres);&lt;br&gt;
&quot;h&quot; = vertex distance (in metres);&lt;br&gt;
&quot;F&quot; = back vertex power (in 1/metres), (essentially, the prescription for the lens, quoted in diopters).

If the difference between the eyes is up to 3 diopters, iseikonic lenses can compensate. At a difference of 3 diopters the lenses would however be very visibly different—one lens would need to be at least 3 mm thicker and have a base curve increased by 7.5 spheres.

==== Example ====
Consider a pair of spectacles to correct for myopia with a prescription of −1.00 m−1 in one eye and −4.00 m−1 in the other. Suppose that for both eyes the other parameters are identical, namely &quot;t&quot; = 1 mm = 0.001 m, &quot;n&quot; = 1.6, &quot;P&quot; = 5 m−1, and &quot;h&quot; = 15 mm = 0.015 m. &lt;br&gt;
Then for the first eye formula_2, &lt;br&gt;
while for the second eye formula_3.

Thus, in the first eye the size of the image formed on the retina will be 1.17% smaller than without spectacles (although it will be sharp, rather than blurry), whilst in the second eye the image formed on the retina will be 5.36% smaller.

As alluded to above, one method of producing more iseikonic lenses would be to adjust the thickness and base curve of the second lens. For instance, theoretically it could be set to &quot;t&quot; = 5 mm = 0.005 m and &quot;P&quot; = 14.5 m−1, with all other parameters unchanged. Then for the second eye the magnification would become formula_4,&lt;br&gt;
which is much closer to that of the first eye.

In this example the first eye, with a −1.00 diopter prescription, is the stronger eye, needing only slight correction to sharpen the image formed, and hence a thin spectacle lens. The second eye, with a −4.00 diopter prescription, is the weaker eye, needing moderate correction to sharpen the image formed, and hence a moderately thick spectacle lens—if the aniseikonia is ignored. In order to avoid the aniseikonia (so that both magnifications will be practically the same, while retaining image sharpness in both eyes), the spectacle lens used for the second eye will have to be made even thicker.

=== Contact lenses ===
The usual recommendation for those needing iseikonic correction is to wear contact lenses. The effect of vertex distance is removed and the effect of center thickness is also almost removed, meaning there is minimal and likely unnoticeable image size difference. This is a good solution for those who can tolerate contact lenses.

=== Refractive surgery ===
Refractive surgery causes only minimal size differences, similar to contact lenses. In a study performed on 53 children who had amblyopia due to anisometropia, surgical correction of the anisometropia followed by strabismus surgery if required led to improved visual acuity and even to stereopsis in many of the children (&quot;see:&quot; Refractive surgery).

== Epidemiology ==
A determination of the prevalence of anisometropia has several difficulties. First of all, the measurement of refractive error may vary from one measurement to the next. Secondly, different criteria have been employed to define anisometropia, and the boundary between anisometropia and isometropia depend on their definition.

Several studies have found that anisometropia occurs more frequently and tends to be more severe for persons with high ametropia, and that this is particularly true for myopes. Anisometropia follows a U-shape distribution according to age: it is frequent in infants aged only a few weeks, is more rare in young children, comparatively more frequent in teenagers and young adults, and more prevalent after presbyopia sets in, progressively increasing into old age.

One study estimated that 6% of those between the ages of 6 and 18 have anisometropia.

Notwithstanding research performed on the biomechanical, structural and optical characteristics of anisometropic eyes, the underlying reasons for anisometropia are still poorly understood.

Anisometropic persons who have strabismus are mostly far-sighted, and almost all of these have (or have had) esotropia. However, there are indications that anisometropia influences the long-term outcome of a surgical correction of an inward squint, and vice versa. More specifically, for patients with esotropia who undergo strabismus surgery, anisometropia may be one of the risk factors for developing consecutive exotropia and poor binocular function may be a risk factor for anisometropia to develop or increase.

<text>The Council of Ancients or Council of Elders () was the upper house of the French legislature under the Constitution of the Year III, during the period commonly known as the Directory (French: &quot;Directoire&quot;), from 22 August 1795 until 9 November 1799, roughly the second half of the period generally referred to as the French Revolution.

==Role and function==

The Council of Ancients was the senior of the two-halves of the republican legislative system. The Ancients were 250 members who could accept or reject laws put forward by the lower house of the Directory, the Council of Five Hundred (&quot;Conseil des Cinq-Cents&quot;). Each member had to be at least forty years of age, and a third of them would be replaced annually. They had no authority to draft laws, but any bills that they renounced could not be reintroduced for at least a year.

Besides functioning as a legislative body, the Ancients chose five Directors, who jointly held executive power, from the list of names put forward by the Council of Five Hundred. The Council of Ancients had their own distinctive official uniform, with robes, cape and hat, just as did the Council of Five Hundred and the Directors. Under the Thermidorean constitution, as Boissy d&#x27;Anglas put it, the Council of Five Hundred was to be the imagination of the Republic, and the Council of Ancients its reason.

The name adopted for the body was based on the French translation/adaptation of the term Senate.

<text>Norran (previously named Norra Västerbotten) is a Swedish language liberal newspaper published in Skellefteå, Sweden.

==History and profile==
&quot;Norran&quot; was founded by a group of liberal newspaper enthusiasts led by Anton Wikström from Jörn in 1910. The first official edition was published 1 January 1911. The paper is owned by the foundation Skelleftepress. It is published in Berliner format in Skellefteå, and chiefly distributed in the northern parts of Västerbotten. The stated position of the editorial is liberal.

Most of the newspaper&#x27;s local articles are written in Skellefteå, but it also has local editors in Arjeplog, Arvidsjaur, Malå and Norsjö.

It has been published on the Internet since February 1996 and the main news service is freely available.

In correlation with the newspaper&#x27;s 100-year-anniversary, the staff announced on 4 January 2010 that its name would be changed into &quot;Norran&quot;, a name which has been used by its readers for decades. The official web site&#x27;s URL was already norran.se.

In February 2023, as the new electric battery factory Northvolt started to recruit English-speaking staff from all over the world, Norran launched an English-language news service, Norran English, edited by former UK national newspaper journalist, Paul Connolly. Norran was the first newspaper in Sweden to launch an English-language service.

==Circulation==
In 1959 the circulation of the paper was 24,000 copies. The paper had a circulation of 23,200 copies in 2012 and 22,700 copies in 2013.

<text>William Alvin Moody (April 10, 1954 – March 5, 2013) was an American professional wrestling manager and licensed funeral director. He is best known for his tenure with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later WWE) where he performed under the ring name and gimmick of Paul Bearer, manager and guiding light of The Undertaker. As Paul Bearer, he hosted his own talk show segment entitled &quot;The Funeral Parlor&quot;.

As Paul Bearer, Moody is also known for managing his storyline son/Undertaker&#x27;s storyline half-brother, Kane, as well as archnemesis of The Undertaker, Mankind. Vader also served as Bearer&#x27;s 
protégé for a short period while feuding with The Undertaker. Outside WWE, Moody was known by the name Percival &quot;Percy&quot; Pringle III and performed in various regional territories and promotions, as well as World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW).

== Early life ==

Moody was born in Mobile, Alabama, on April 10, 1954, and attended San Antonio College and the University of South Alabama.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1974–1990)===

Moody entered professional wrestling in his teenage years as a ringside photographer. After high school, he enlisted in the United States Air Force, serving four years on duty; during this time, he often wrestled for independent promotions during off-duty hours.

In 1979, Moody began managing as Percival &quot;Percy&quot; Pringle III in southeastern independent promotions; a few years earlier, in June 1974, he wrestled as Mr. X. There had been previous Percy Pringles in wrestling who were not William Moody. He was given the name by booker Frankie Cain. Immediately after his first son&#x27;s birth, he cut back his involvement in the wrestling business in order to obtain a degree in mortuary science and earn certification as an embalmer and mortician.

In 1984, he resumed full-time involvement in the wrestling business, using his Pringle character in Championship Wrestling from Florida and World Class Championship Wrestling in Texas. During this time, he was WCCW&#x27;s answer to Bobby Heenan by doing &quot;Heenan&quot; like promos, even looking like Heenan as well with the blonde hair and attire. He served as manager for numerous wrestlers; he notably managed Rick Rude, &quot;Stunning&quot; Steve Austin, and Mark Calaway in their early careers. As Percy Pringle, he was also associated with the careers of Lex Luger, Eric Embry, and Dingo Warrior. Warrior turned babyface after falling out with fellow Pringle proteges Buzz Sawyer and Matt Borne following a six-man tag defeat in 1986.

===World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment (1990–2002)===
==== Managing The Undertaker (1990–1996) ====
Moody joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) on December 22, 1990, after being mentioned by Rick Rude to WWF owner Vince McMahon. McMahon used Moody&#x27;s real-life involvement in the funeral industry to create the character of Paul Bearer, a name given to him by Road Warrior Hawk and a play on the term &quot;pallbearer&quot;. In his portrayal of a very , ghostly manager, Bearer regularly communicated in his shaky, high-pitched, wailing voice and was almost always seen bearing an urn, which led to his mantra, &quot;the power of the urn,&quot; allowing his main protégé The Undertaker to revive strength. His keeper-of-the-urn gimmick led to several storylines in which The Undertaker&#x27;s antagonists stole his urn, causing The Undertaker to lose much of his supernatural strength. Bearer&#x27;s leading catch phrase was &quot;Ohhhh, yes!&quot;

Moody made his first appearance in February 1991, as a heel, when Brother Love, who originally managed The Undertaker, delegated Bearer to take on the role of The Undertaker&#x27;s manager. Complementing The Undertaker&#x27;s Deadman gimmick, Bearer took on a spooky, ghastly character. Bearer hosted his own WWF talk show segment entitled &quot;The Funeral Parlor&quot;, which included memorable moments such as the Ultimate Warrior being locked inside a casket, among others. In late 1991, Bearer managed The Undertaker to the WWF Championship when The Undertaker defeated Hulk Hogan at that year&#x27;s &quot;Survivor Series&quot;, though The Undertaker would lose the title back to Hogan six days later at &quot;This Tuesday in Texas&quot;. In early 1992, The Undertaker and Bearer turned face when The Undertaker stopped former ally Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts from ambushing Randy Savage and Miss Elizabeth with a chair backstage; The Undertaker and Roberts had a match at WrestleMania VIII, which saw The Undertaker win.

====Managing Mankind and Kane (1996–1998)====

Eventually Bearer turned heel again by betraying his long-time protege at SummerSlam 1996 to align himself with The Undertaker&#x27;s arch-enemies, Mankind and Goldust, According to Moody, the WWF wanted Bearer to turn on The Undertaker for him to get ready for the storyline with Kane the following year. At In Your House 11: Buried Alive, Bearer brought The Executioner to help Mankind and other wrestlers bury The Undertaker and Bearer managed The Executioner for two months until Bearer fired him and at Royal Rumble, Bearer became the new manager of Big Van Vader. In April 1997 at In Your House 14: Revenge of the &#x27;Taker, The Undertaker set Bearer&#x27;s face ablaze using a fireball, which was done in retaliation for Bearer having Mankind set a fireball to The Undertaker&#x27;s face several weeks prior. Resulting from The Undertaker&#x27;s actions, Bearer suffered (kayfabe) burns to his face and was bandaged for a time. Once healed from the burns, Bearer changed his looks, shedding the makeup of ghostly pallor and jet-black color to his natural strawberry blond hair and less make-up. No longer using his ghostly appearance and mannerisms, he became loudmouthed and shrill and often delivered ranting, raving promos.

Around mid-1997, Paul Bearer coerced The Undertaker (WWF Champion at the time) into being his protégé again with the ultimatum of revealing a deep, dark secret from their past. During this time, Bearer made references to the &quot;fires of hell,&quot; likening The Undertaker&#x27;s dark secret to The Undertaker&#x27;s act of setting fire to his face. Under duress, The Undertaker accepted after several weeks of resistance. While &quot;managing&quot; The Undertaker this time around, Bearer engaged in tyrannical behaviors towards him, harassing him constantly. Eventually, The Undertaker lost his patience and refused to allow Bearer to continue being his manager, leading Bearer to reveal the secret.

The dark secret suggested that Bearer had a disturbingly traumatic past with The Undertaker which long preceded Brother Love&#x27;s joining the two in January 1991. The dark secret dates back to The Undertaker&#x27;s youth and involves domestic matters: Paul Bearer, while working for The Undertaker&#x27;s parents as an apprentice mortician in their family funeral home business, witnessed a felony act during The Undertaker&#x27;s adolescence. Bearer claimed that The Undertaker had committed an arson murder, burning down his parents&#x27; family funeral home, in the process, killing them. This act also killed The Undertaker&#x27;s younger &quot;brother&quot;—or so The Undertaker long thought. Bearer, who claimed to be attending a mortuary science college course at the time of the fire, hid Kane in a mental asylum during the rest of Kane&#x27;s youth into adulthood. At the time throughout mid to late 1997, The Undertaker denied all this, claiming it was his younger brother&#x27;s fault. Bearer, blaming The Undertaker, accused him of being an &quot;arsonist&quot;, &quot;murderer&quot;, and &quot;liar.&quot; (Connected to these accounts, it was later revealed approximately six months after Kane&#x27;s WWF debut that he was actually the half-brother of The Undertaker. The Undertaker&#x27;s mother had an affair with Bearer and, as a result, gave birth to Kane. Bearer unintentionally (kayfabe) revealed to a &quot;Raw&quot; audience that he was actually Kane&#x27;s father. This came to light when Bearer informed Jerry Lawler on &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, at a point in which he thought cameras had stopped rolling for a commercial break but were still on. Up until that point, The Undertaker was under the impression that Kane was fully related to him and his family. Presumably, The Undertaker&#x27;s deceased father lived his entire life under the same impression). Because of the fire, The Undertaker thought Kane had been dead for all those years, claiming he was a &quot;pyromaniac&quot;, obsessed with starting fires and, due to the incident, couldn&#x27;t possibly be alive. However, Bearer introduced the vengeful, fire-personified Kane in October 1997 at Badd Blood: In Your House. In this first appearance for the character, Kane cost The Undertaker a Hell in a Cell match to determine the #1 contendership for the WWF title against Shawn Michaels. This led to a bitter rivalry between The Undertaker and Kane and Bearer. Kane was not revealed as Bearer&#x27;s son until April 27, 1998, on &quot;Raw is War&quot;, a day after the first Inferno Match, at , where Kane was set on fire. The Undertaker was shown to have also been unaware of this at that time, and helped to build the feud up further, as Undertaker initially refused to believe the story until an in-story DNA test proved it to be true. The feud lasted into summer of 1998, when Kane seemingly abandoned Bearer to side with The Undertaker, beginning a face turn.

====The Ministry of Darkness (1998–1999)====

Bearer and The Undertaker became a heel team again toward the end of 1998 when Bearer betrayed his own son, Kane, in favor of managing The Undertaker once again. Once becoming a heel with Bearer, The Undertaker shamelessly admitted to setting the funeral home ablaze for which he had initially claimed was an accident or blamed Kane. Shortly thereafter, Bearer (returning in early 1999 to his signature black hair and mustache, but wearing a buttoned sweater and black overcoat, without the pasty white makeup and speaking in the same voice as his 1997 predecessor) and The Undertaker formed the Ministry of Darkness. Both he and The Undertaker took a hiatus from the WWF unceremoniously in September 1999 as a result of The Undertaker suffering an injury.

====Final appearances (2000)====
In February 2000, Bearer, who turned face once more briefly, returned to WWF television as Kane&#x27;s manager (now wearing a red overcoat), aiding and assisting his son in his war against D-Generation X, but retired from on-screen performing shortly after WrestleMania 2000. Later that year, he went backstage to serve as a WWF road agent, stage manager, and talent scout. His contract with WWE ended on October 14, 2002.

===NWA Total Nonstop Action (2002–2003)===
Moody spent the next year working with NWA Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (NWA-TNA) under the ring name Percy Pringle III.

=== Return to WWE (2003–2005, 2007)===
In October 2003, he signed a new three-year contract with WWE. When Jim Ross contacted him about rejoining the company, Bearer at first refused the offer, but Ross then called again with an offer. At that time, he was suffering from health problems and depression related to his obesity and underwent gastric bypass surgery in November 2003. As a signing bonus, WWE agreed to pay for the surgery, as Ross promised.

After recovering, he reappeared as Paul Bearer in March 2004 at WrestleMania XX, alongside Undertaker in a match against Kane.

In spring of 2004, Paul Bearer was kidnapped by The Dudley Boyz under the direction of Paul Heyman; this was set up in order to temporarily write Bearer out of WWE story lines because he had to undergo emergency gallbladder surgery after suddenly developing gallstones, a common side effect of gastric bypass surgery.

For the June 27, 2004, pay-per-view The Great American Bash, a match pitting The Undertaker against both of The Dudley Boyz was booked. Paul Bearer was encased in a glass &quot;crypt&quot; at ringside, covered up to his chest in cement. Heyman demanded The Undertaker throw the match or Bearer would be suffocated in cement.

The Undertaker won the match but proceeded afterwards to pull the lever that sent cement into the crypt, completely burying Paul Bearer, suffocating him. On the following week&#x27;s &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Bearer was acknowledged to be alive, although gravely injured, for storyline purposes; the rehearsal taping earlier in the day of The Great American Bash – with The Undertaker ad-libbing and only half of the stunt complete, in an empty arena – was leaked onto the internet dirt sheets and actually broadcast live by accident in many of the television markets. As he had two years remaining on his contract, however, Bearer was used as a booker for the company up until WWE decided to terminate his contract on April 11, 2005.

On June 10, 2005, Bearer announced that he had signed a new deal with WWE, allowing it to market his personality and requiring he attend autograph sessions, make promotional appearances and occasionally work television and house shows. In late January 2007, at a SmackDown!/ECW house show in Mobile, Alabama, Bearer joined The Brothers of Destruction at ringside, carrying the original urn.

===Independent circuit (2010–2012)===

Bearer returned to the Boston-based Millennium Wrestling Federation as top heel manager along with John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield after four years, leading &quot;Stalker&quot; Dylan Kage at Soul Survivor VI against The Iron Sheik and &quot;Black Machismo&quot; Jay Lethal in the Sheik&#x27;s retirement match on April 24, 2010. On October 12, 2012, Bearer managed Vader against Rikishi at Pro Wrestling Syndicate in Rahway, New Jersey.

The final wrestler managed by Bearer on the independent circuit was Shaun Ricker, who would later become widely known in WWE under the ring name LA Knight.

===Second return to WWE (2010, 2012)===
On the September 24, 2010, episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Bearer made his first on-screen appearance in six years after being brought out in a casket. He helped The Undertaker, who was feuding with Kane over the World Heavyweight Championship, by restoring The Undertaker&#x27;s powers with the urn. Bearer officially became The Undertaker&#x27;s manager again by accompanying him to the ring for his match against Kane for the title at the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view. During the match, Bearer once again turned on The Undertaker, after shining a light in his eyes when he was about to Tombstone Kane. He then let Kane hit The Undertaker with the urn to help him win. On the October 15 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Bearer challenged The Undertaker to face Kane in a Buried Alive Match for the World Heavyweight Championship at Bragging Rights, to which The Undertaker accepted by attacking Kane. At Bragging Rights, Kane once again defeated The Undertaker after interference by Bearer, who was almost thrown in the grave by The Undertaker, and The Nexus, who helped Bearer and Kane bury The Undertaker.

Kane then entered a feud with Edge, after he was named the new challenger to Kane&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship at Survivor Series. On the November 12 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Kane cost Edge his match against Nexus member David Otunga. After the match, Edge kidnapped Bearer by strapping him in a wheelchair. Later that night, Edge used Bearer to cost Kane his match against Big Show. The following week, Edge tormented Bearer throughout the night by throwing a dodgeball at him and force feeding and throwing pizza all over him. Edge then used Bearer to call for Kane in the parking lot, but Kane wasn&#x27;t able to get Bearer in time as Edge attacked him and drove off with Bearer. At Survivor Series, Edge brought an empty wheelchair causing Kane to go mad frantically trying to interrogate him on where Bearer was held. Even though the match ended in a draw, Kane was unable to find Bearer as Edge wheeled his enemy into a barricade. On the November 26 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Kane demanded that Edge to let Bearer go, but Edge refused. Kane attempted to track down Bearer, but was unable to find him. Kane offered a second title shot to Edge, which he accepted, but continued to keep Bearer with him. At the end of the night, Edge lured Kane to the parking lot, where Edge drove over a dummy version of Paul Bearer, with the actual Paul Bearer in the backseat of the car. On the December 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Edge continued his mind games with Kane by pushing a dummy version of Paul Bearer down some stairs. Then, after Edge defeated Kane in a non-title match, he brought out a Paul Bearer lookalike. Kane then went to search for Bearer again, but Edge drove away in a truck with Bearer tied up on the back. The following week, Kane begged Edge to return Bearer, but Edge once again refused. Kane then refused to participate in the main event that night and once again searched for Bearer. After seeing what he thought was a dummy version of Paul Bearer on top of two ladders, Kane pushed them over. Afterward, Kane saw that he pushed the actual Paul Bearer off the ladders onto the concrete floor, thus, injuring him and writing him out of the storyline.

In April 2012, Bearer returned for a brief stint as a part of Kane&#x27;s ongoing feud with Randy Orton. He was kidnapped by Orton and then stuck in a storage freezer while strapped to a wheelchair. Kane later came for Bearer, only to roll him back into the freezer and saying, &quot;I&#x27;m saving you... from me&quot;. This would mark Bearer&#x27;s final appearance in WWE. Bearer was planned to reunite with The Undertaker and Kane on WWE Raw 1000 in July 2012 but could not make the event due to scheduling and travel conflicts.

==Other media==
Paul Bearer has been a playable character in at least five WWE-licensed video games: &quot;WWF Attitude&quot;, &quot;WWF WrestleMania 2000&quot;, &quot;WWF SmackDown!&quot;, &quot;WWF No Mercy&quot;, and &quot;WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role&quot;. Bearer was also featured as a manager in the THQ video game &quot;WWE Legends of WrestleMania&quot; in 2009 (depending on whether or not he&#x27;s paired with The Undertaker, he enters with or without his signature urn). In 2010, Moody did voice over work as Paul Bearer for the game, &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011&quot;, where he was featured in one of the &quot;Road To WrestleMania&quot; storylines for the game, as well as a selectable manager. He was also in &quot;WWE All Stars&quot; (during The Undertaker&#x27;s &quot;Path of Champions&quot;, voiced again by Moody), &quot;WWE &#x27;13&quot;, and &quot;WWE 2K14&quot; as a selectable manager and part of the Attitude Era single-player mode, and 30 Years of WrestleMania mode respectively representing The Brothers of Destruction. Bearer further appeared as a manager in &quot;WWE 2K15&quot; (from the &quot;Path of the Warrior&quot; Showcase DLC), &quot;WWE 2K16&quot; (as part of the &quot;Austin 3:16&quot; Showcase), and &quot;WWE 2K24&quot; (unlocked via VC).

==Personal life==
Moody married Dianna McDole in December 1978 and had two sons, Michael and Daniel. Daniel wrestled on the independent circuit as DJ Pringle. Dianna died due to complications resulting from breast cancer on January 31, 2009. On September 21, 2014, his son Michael died.

In November 2003, WWE assisted Moody with $35,000 for gastric bypass surgery as a signing bonus. Moody&#x27;s health improved with him eventually dropping around 240 pounds. He admitted that prior to the operation, he had weighed 525 pounds (238 kg) and had difficulty walking.

In 2005, Moody, with three business partners started his own independent promotion known as &quot;Gulf South Wrestling&quot;. He dissolved the company in May 2007 after learning that his partners wanted to force him out of the promotion and operate it without him. He returned full-time to his funeral business in 2006.

==Death==
On March 2, 2013, Moody attended the annual Gulf Coast Wrestlers Reunion in Mobile, Alabama, riding a wheelchair. According to club board member &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bob Kelly, Moody was having breathing difficulties at the event. He was coughing, and told friends he was going to seek treatment for respiratory problems as he had trouble standing at the time. Kelly said that Moody was treated for a blood clot after the reunion. On March 5, 2013, Moody died in Mobile, Alabama, at the age of 58 due to a heart attack. The cause of the heart attack was supraventricular tachycardia, which causes a dangerously high heart rate. He is interred beside his wife at Serenity Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Theodore, Alabama.

===Hall of Fame and legacy===

Following his death, Moody became a driving point in WWE storylines; the March 11 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; was held as a tribute to Bearer. The Undertaker paid tribute but was interrupted by CM Punk, his WrestleMania 29 opponent. Punk then mocked Bearer over the next few weeks against both The Undertaker and Kane, including stealing his urn and attacking Kane with it. On the April 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Paul Heyman dressed up as Paul Bearer and Punk poured the ashes of the urn onto The Undertaker after attacking him. At WrestleMania 29, The Undertaker defeated Punk and took back the urn, dedicating his victory to Paul Bearer.

On the March 3, 2014, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; it was announced that Paul Bearer would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. At the ceremony itself, Kane inducted Bearer, and his sons Michael and Daniel Moody accepted the induction; afterwards, The Undertaker came out in character and paid tribute. Bearer&#x27;s family was also presented a Hall of Fame ring, which was later featured in a 2016 episode of &quot;Pawn Stars&quot;; the seller stated his ring was given to him by his family, but he declined show host Rick Harrison&#x27;s $4,000 offer. Bearer&#x27;s son Daniel later stated that the ring was a fake.

On November 22, 2020, a transparent image of Paul Bearer appeared for The Undertaker&#x27;s final farewell at Survivor Series while The Undertaker performed his trademark kneeling pose.

<text>Polyomaviridae is a family of viruses whose natural hosts are primarily mammals and birds. As of 2024, there are eight recognized genera. Fourteen species are known to infect humans, while others, such as Simian Virus 40, have been identified in humans to a lesser extent. Most of these viruses are very common and typically asymptomatic in most human populations studied. BK virus is associated with nephropathy in renal transplant and non-renal solid organ transplant patients, JC virus with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and Merkel cell virus with Merkel cell cancer.

==Structure and genome==

Polyomaviruses are non-enveloped double-stranded DNA viruses with circular genomes of around 5000 base pairs. With such a small size, they are ranked among the smallest known double stranded DNA viruses.
The genome is packaged in a viral capsid of about 40-50 nanometers in diameter, which is icosahedral in shape (T=7 symmetry). The capsid is composed of 72 pentameric capsomeres of a protein called VP1, which is capable of self-assembly into a closed icosahedron; each pentamer of VP1 is associated with one molecule of one of the other two capsid proteins, VP2 or VP3.

The genome of a typical polyomavirus codes for between five and nine proteins, divided into two transcriptional regions called the early and late regions due to the time during infection in which they are transcribed. Each region is transcribed by the host cell&#x27;s RNA polymerase II as a single pre-messenger RNA containing multiple genes. The early region usually codes for two proteins, the small and large tumor antigens, produced by alternative splicing. The late region contains the three capsid structural proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3, produced by alternative translational start sites. Additional genes and other variations on this theme are present in some viruses: for example, rodent polyomaviruses have a third protein called middle tumor antigen in the early region, which is extremely efficient at inducing cellular transformation; SV40 has an additional capsid protein VP4; some examples have an additional regulatory protein called agnoprotein expressed from the late region. The genome also contains a non-coding control or regulatory region containing the early and late regions&#x27; promoters, transcriptional start sites, and the origin of replication.

== Replication and life cycle ==
The polyomavirus life cycle begins with entry into a host cell. Cellular receptors for polyomaviruses are sialic acid residues of glycans, commonly gangliosides. The attachment of polyomaviruses to host cells is mediated by the binding of VP1 to sialylated glycans on the cell surface. In some particular viruses, additional cell-surface interactions occur; for example, the JC virus is believed to require interaction with the 5HT2A receptor and the Merkel cell virus with heparan sulfate. However, in general virus-cell interactions are mediated by commonly occurring molecules on the cell surface, and therefore are likely not a major contributor to individual viruses&#x27; observed cell-type tropism. After binding to molecules on the cell surface, the virion is endocytosed and enters the endoplasmic reticulum - a behavior unique among known non-enveloped viruses - where the viral capsid structure is likely to be disrupted by action of host cell disulfide isomerase enzymes.

The details of transit to the nucleus are not clear and may vary among individual polyomaviruses. It has been frequently reported that an intact, albeit distorted, virion particle is released from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cell cytoplasm, where the genome is released from the capsid, possibly due to the low calcium concentration in the cytoplasm. Both expression of viral genes and replication of the viral genome occur in the nucleus using host cell machinery. The early genes - comprising at minimum the small tumor antigen (ST) and large tumor antigen (LT) - are expressed first, from a single alternatively spliced messenger RNA strand. These proteins serve to manipulate the host&#x27;s cell cycle - dysregulating the transition from G1 phase to S phase, when the host cell&#x27;s genome is replicated - because host cell DNA replication machinery is needed for viral genome replication. The precise mechanism of this dysregulation depends on the virus; for example, SV40 LT can directly bind host cell p53, but murine polyomavirus LT does not. LT induces DNA replication from the viral genome&#x27;s non-coding control region (NCCR), after which expression of the early mRNA is reduced and expression of the late mRNA, which encodes the viral capsid proteins, begins. As these interactions begin, the LTs belonging to several polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, present oncogenic potential.
Several mechanisms have been described for regulating the transition from early to late gene expression, including the involvement of the LT protein in repressing the early promoter, the expression of un-terminated late mRNAs with extensions complementary to early mRNA, and the expression of regulatory microRNA.
Expression of the late genes results in accumulation of the viral capsid proteins in the host cell cytoplasm. Capsid components enter the nucleus in order to encapsidate new viral genomic DNA. New virions may be assembled in viral factories. The mechanism of viral release from the host cell varies among polyomaviruses; some express proteins that facilitate cell exit, such as the agnoprotein or VP4. In some cases high levels of encapsidated virus result in cell lysis, releasing the virions.

== Viral proteins ==
=== Tumor antigens ===
The large tumor antigen plays a key role in regulating the viral life cycle by binding to the viral origin of DNA replication where it promotes DNA synthesis. Also as the polyomavirus relies on the host cell machinery to replicate the host cell needs to be in s-phase for this to begin. Due to this, large T-antigen also modulates cellular signaling pathways to stimulate progression of the cell cycle by binding to a number of cellular control proteins. This is achieved by a two prong attack of inhibiting tumor suppressing genes p53 and members of the retinoblastoma (pRB) family, and stimulating cell growth pathways by binding cellular DNA, ATPase-helicase, DNA polymerase α association, and binding of transcription preinitiation complex factors. This abnormal stimulation of the cell cycle is a powerful force for oncogenic transformation.

The small tumor antigen protein is also able to activate several cellular pathways that stimulate cell proliferation. Polyomavirus small T antigens commonly target protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a key multisubunit regulator of multiple pathways including Akt, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) pathway. Merkel cell polyomavirus small T antigen encodes a unique domain, called the LT-stabilization domain (LSD), that binds to and inhibits the FBXW7 E3 ligase regulating both cellular and viral oncoproteins. Unlike for SV40, the MCV small T antigen directly transforms rodent cells in vitro.

The middle tumor antigen is used in model organisms developed to study cancer, such as the MMTV-PyMT system where middle T is coupled to the MMTV promoter. There it functions as an oncogene, while the tissue where the tumor develops is determined by the MMTV promoter.

=== Capsid proteins ===
The polyomavirus capsid consists of one major component, major capsid protein VP1, and one or two minor components, minor capsid proteins VP2 and VP3. VP1 pentamers form the closed icosahedral viral capsid, and in the interior of the capsid each pentamer is associated with one molecule of either VP2 or VP3. Some polyomaviruses, such as Merkel cell polyomavirus, do not encode or express VP3. The capsid proteins are expressed from the late region of the genome.

=== Agnoprotein ===
The agnoprotein is a small multifunctional phospho-protein found in the late coding part of the genome of some polyomaviruses, most notably BK virus, JC virus, and SV40. It is essential for proliferation in the viruses that express it and is thought to be involved in regulating the viral life cycle, particularly replication and viral exit from the host cell, but the exact mechanisms are unclear.

==Taxonomy==
The polyomaviruses are members of group I (dsDNA viruses). The classification of polyomaviruses has been the subject of several proposed revisions as new members of the group are discovered. Formerly, polyomaviruses and papillomaviruses, which share many structural features but have very different genomic organizations, were classified together in the now-obsolete family &quot;Papovaviridae&quot;. (The name &quot;Papovaviridae&quot; derived from three abbreviations: Pa for &quot;Papillomavirus&quot;, Po for &quot;Polyomavirus&quot;, and Va for &quot;vacuolating.&quot;) The polyomaviruses were divided into three major clades (that is, genetically related groups): the SV40 clade, the avian clade, and the murine polyomavirus clade. A subsequent proposed reclassification by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) recommended dividing the family of &quot;Polyomaviridae&quot; into three genera:
* Genus &quot;Orthopolyomavirus&quot; (type species SV40)
* Genus &quot;Wukipolyomavirus&quot; (type species KI polyomavirus)
* Genus &quot;Avipolyomavirus&quot; (type species Avian polyomavirus)

The current ICTV classification system recognises six genera and 117 species, of which five could not be assigned a genus. This system retains the distinction between avian and mammalian viruses, grouping the avian subset into the genus &quot;Gammapolyomavirus&quot;. The six genera are:
* &quot;Alphapolyomavirus&quot;
* &quot;Betapolyomavirus&quot;
* &quot;Deltapolyomavirus&quot;
* &quot;Epsilonpolyomavirus&quot;
* &quot;Gammapolyomavirus&quot;
* &quot;Zetapolyomavirus&quot;

The following species are unassigned to a genus:
* &quot;Centropristis striata polyomavirus 1&quot;
* &quot;Rhynchobatus djiddensis polyomavirus 1&quot;
* &quot;Sparus aurata polyomavirus 1&quot;
* &quot;Trematomus bernacchii polyomavirus 1&quot;
* &quot;Trematomus pennellii polyomavirus 1&quot;

Description of additional viruses is ongoing. These include the sea otter polyomavirus 1 and Alpaca polyomavirus Another virus is the giant panda polyomavirus 1. Another virus has been described from sigmodontine rodents. Another - tree shrew polyomavirus 1 - has been described in the tree shrew.

== Human polyomaviruses ==
Most polyomaviruses do not infect humans. Of the polyomaviruses cataloged as of 2017, a total of 14 were known with human hosts. However, some polyomaviruses are associated with human disease, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. MCV is highly divergent from the other human polyomaviruses and is most closely related to murine polyomavirus. Trichodysplasia spinulosa-associated polyomavirus (TSV) is distantly related to MCV. Two viruses—HPyV6 and HPyV7—are most closely related to KI and WU viruses, while HPyV9 is most closely related to the African green monkey-derived lymphotropic polyomavirus (LPV).

A fourteenth virus has been described. Lyon IARC polyomavirus is related to raccoon polyomavirus.

===List of human polyomaviruses===
The following 14 polyomaviruses with human hosts had been identified and had their genomes sequenced as of 2017:

&quot;Deltapolyomavirus&quot; contains only the four human viruses shown in the above table. The Alpha and Beta groups contain viruses that infect a variety of mammals. The Gamma group contains the avian viruses. Clinically significant disease associations are shown only where causality is expected.

Antibodies to the monkey lymphotropic polyomavirus have been detected in humans suggesting that this virus - or a closely related virus - can infect humans.

===Clinical relevance===
All the polyomaviruses are highly common childhood and young adult infections. Most of these infections appear to cause little or no symptoms. These viruses are probably lifelong persistent among almost all adults. Diseases caused by human polyomavirus infections are most common among immunocompromised people; disease associations include BK virus with nephropathy in renal transplant and non-renal solid organ transplant patients, JC virus with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and Merkel cell virus (MCV) with Merkel cell cancer.

====SV40====

SV40 replicates in the kidneys of monkeys without causing disease, but can cause cancer in rodents under laboratory conditions. In the 1950s and early 1960s, well over 100 million people may have been exposed to SV40 due to previously undetected SV40 contamination of polio vaccine, prompting concern about the possibility that the virus might cause disease in humans. Although it has been reported as present in some human cancers, including brain tumors, bone tumors, mesotheliomas, and non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphomas, accurate detection is often confounded by high levels of cross-reactivity for SV40 with widespread human polyomaviruses. Most virologists dismiss SV40 as a cause for human cancers.

=== Diagnosis ===
The diagnosis of polyomavirus almost always occurs after the primary infection as it is either asymptomatic or sub-clinical. Antibody assays are commonly used to detect presence of antibodies against individual viruses. Competition assays are frequently needed to distinguish among highly similar polyomaviruses.

In cases of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML), a cross-reactive antibody to SV40 T antigen (commonly Pab419) is used to stain tissues directly for the presence of JC virus T antigen. PCR can be used on a biopsy of the tissue or cerebrospinal fluid to amplify the polyomavirus DNA. This allows not only the detection of polyomavirus but also which sub type it is.

There are three main diagnostic techniques used for the diagnosis of the reactivation of polyomavirus in polyomavirus nephropathy (PVN): urine cytology, quantification of the viral load in both urine and blood, and a renal biopsy.
The reactivation of polyomavirus in the kidneys and urinary tract causes the shedding of infected cells, virions, and/or viral proteins in the urine. This allows urine cytology to examine these cells, which if there is polyomavirus inclusion of the nucleus, is diagnostic of infection. Also as the urine of an infected individual will contain virions and/or viral DNA, quantitation of the viral load can be done through PCR. This is also true for the blood.

Renal biopsy can also be used if the two methods just described are inconclusive or if the specific viral load for the renal tissue is desired. Similarly to the urine cytology, the renal cells are examined under light microscopy for polyomavirus inclusion of the nucleus, as well as cell lysis and viral partials in the extra cellular fluid. The viral load as before is also measure by PCR.

Tissue staining using a monoclonal antibody against MCV T antigen shows utility in differentiating Merkel cell carcinoma from other small, round cell tumors. Blood tests to detect MCV antibodies have been developed and show that infection with the virus is widespread although Merkel cell carcinoma patients have exceptionally higher antibody responses than asymptomatically infected persons.

=== Use in tracing human migration ===
The JC virus offers a promising genetic marker for human evolution and migration. It is carried by 70–90 percent of humans and is usually transmitted from parents to offspring. This method does not appear to be reliable for tracing the recent African origin of modern humans.

== History ==
Murine polyomavirus was the first polyomavirus discovered, having been reported by Ludwik Gross in 1953 as an extract of mouse leukemias capable of inducing parotid gland tumors. The causative agent was identified as a virus by Sarah Stewart and Bernice Eddy, after whom it was once called &quot;SE polyoma&quot;. The term &quot;polyoma&quot; refers to the viruses&#x27; ability to produce multiple (poly-) tumors (-oma) under certain conditions. The name has been criticized as a &quot;meatless linguistic sandwich&quot; (&quot;meatless&quot; because both morphemes in &quot;polyoma&quot; are affixes) giving little insight into the viruses&#x27; biology; in fact, subsequent research has found that most polyomaviruses rarely cause clinically significant disease in their host organisms under natural conditions.

Dozens of polyomaviruses have been identified and sequenced as of 2017, infecting mainly birds and mammals. Two polyomaviruses are known to infect fish, the black sea bass and gilthead seabream. A total of fourteen polyomaviruses are known to infect humans.

<text>The red-knobbed coot or crested coot, (Fulica cristata), is a member of the rail and crake bird family, the Rallidae.

It is a resident breeder across much of Africa and in southernmost Spain on freshwater lakes and ponds. It builds a nest of dead reeds near the water&#x27;s edge or more commonly afloat, laying about 7 eggs (or more in good conditions).

==Taxonomy==
The red-knobbed coot was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the other coots in the genus &quot;Fulica&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Fulica cristata&quot;. Gmelin based his account on the earlier descriptions by the French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon and the English ornithologist John Latham, neither of whom had included a binomial name. They gave the type locality as Madagascar. The genus &quot;Fulica&quot; had been introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The genus name is the Latin word for a Eurasian coot. The specific epithet &quot;cristata&quot; is from Latin &quot;cristatus&quot; meaning &quot;crested&quot; or &quot;plumed&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The red-knobbed coot is largely black except for the white frontal shield. It is long, spans across the wings. Males weigh , females are slightly smaller and weigh . The sexes are alike. As a swimming species, it has partial webbing on its long strong toes. The juvenile is paler than the adult, has a whitish breast, and lacks the facial shield; the adult&#x27;s black plumage develops when about 3–4 months old, but the white shield is only fully developed at about one year old, some time later.

A good view is necessary to separate this species from the Eurasian coot, with which its range overlaps in northwestern
Africa and southern Iberia. There are two tiny red knobs at the top of the facial shield, which are not visible at any great distance and are only present in the breeding season; the black feathering between the shield and the bill is rounded, whereas in Eurasian it comes to a point; and the bill has a bluish grey tinge. In flight, the red-knobbed coot lacks the white trailing edge to the secondaries of the Eurasian coot.

==Behaviour==

The habits of the red-knobbed coot are practically identical to those of the Eurasian coot. It is much less secretive than most of the rail family. Where it is undisturbed it is likely to bully any intruder, even large birds such as Egyptian geese, if they do not defy its challenges. It can be seen swimming on open water or walking across waterside grasslands. It is an aggressive species, and strongly territorial during the breeding season.

The red-knobbed coot is reluctant to fly and when taking off runs across the water surface with much splashing. It does the same, but without actually flying, when travelling a short distance at speed (to escape a rival, for example, or to dispute possession of a choice morsel). It bobs its head as it swims, and makes short dives from a little jump.

===Breeding===
The nest is a bulky platform of reeds and plant stems placed in shallow water. It is built by both sexes. The clutch of 5–7 eggs are laid at daily intervals. The eggs are incubated by both sexes for 18–25 days and hatch asynchronously. The downy precocial chicks leave the nest after one day and are then fed and cared for by both parents for 55–60 days.

===Food and feeding===
The red-knobbed coot is an omnivore, and will take a variety of small live prey including the eggs of other water birds. Its main food in most waters however comprises various waterweeds such as species of Potamogeton for which it commonly dives.

This is a noisy bird during mating, but its vocalisations are quite different from the Eurasian coot. It gives a fast &quot;kerrre&quot; like the little crake, a harsh &quot;ka-haa&quot; and a grunting hoot &quot;oot oot&quot; that suggests that the name &quot;coot&quot; might be onomatopoeia, but inspection of the etymology of &quot;coot&quot; fairly decisively negates any such suggestion.

<text>Lead(II) iodide (or lead iodide) is a chemical compound with the formula . At room temperature, it is a bright yellow odorless crystalline solid, that becomes orange and red when heated. It was formerly called plumbous iodide.

The compound currently has a few specialized applications, such as the manufacture of solar cells, X-rays and gamma-ray detectors. Its preparation is an entertaining and popular demonstration in chemistry education, to teach topics such as precipitation reactions and stoichiometry. It is decomposed by light at temperatures above , and this effect has been used in a patented photographic process.

Lead iodide was formerly employed as a yellow pigment in some paints, with the name iodide yellow. However, that use has been largely discontinued due to its toxicity and poor stability.

== Preparation ==

 is commonly synthesized via a precipitation reaction between potassium iodide and lead(II) nitrate ()2 in water solution:

While the potassium nitrate is soluble, the lead iodide is nearly insoluble at room temperature, and thus precipitates out.

Other soluble compounds containing lead(II) and iodide can be used instead, for example lead(II) acetate and sodium iodide.

The compound can also be synthesized by reacting iodine vapor with molten lead between 500 and 700 °C.

A thin film of can also be prepared by depositing a film of lead sulfide and exposing it to iodine vapor, by the reaction

The sulfur is then washed with dimethyl sulfoxide.

== Crystallization ==

Lead iodide prepared from cold solutions usually consists of many small hexagonal platelets, giving the yellow precipitate a silky appearance. Larger crystals can be obtained by exploiting the fact that solubility of lead iodide in water (like those of lead chloride and lead bromide) increases dramatically with temperature. The compound is colorless when dissolved in hot water, but crystallizes on cooling as thin but visibly larger bright yellow flakes, that settle slowly through the liquid — a visual effect often described as &quot;golden rain&quot;. Larger crystals can be obtained by autoclaving the with water under pressure at 200 °C.

Even larger crystals can be obtained by slowing down the common reaction. A simple setup is to submerge two beakers containing the concentrated reactants in a larger container of water, taking care to avoid currents. As the two substances diffuse through the water and meet, they slowly react and deposit the iodide in the space between the beakers.

Another similar method is to react the two substances in a gel medium, that slows down the diffusion and supports the growing crystal away from the container&#x27;s walls. Patel and Rao have used this method to grow crystals up to 30 mm in diameter and 2 mm thick.

The reaction can be slowed also by separating the two reagents with a permeable membrane. This approach, with a cellulose membrane, was used in September 1988 to study the growth of crystals in zero gravity, in an experiment flown on the Space Shuttle Discovery.

 can also be crystallized from powder by sublimation at 390 °C, in near vacuum or in a current of argon with some hydrogen.

Large high-purity crystals can be obtained by zone melting or by the Bridgman–Stockbarger technique. These processes can remove various impurities from commercial .

== Applications ==

Lead iodide is a precursor material in the fabrication of highly efficient Perovskite solar cell. Typically, a solution of in an organic solvent, such as dimethylformamide or dimethylsulfoxide, is applied over a titanium dioxide layer by spin coating. The layer is then treated with a solution of methylammonium iodide and annealed, turning it into the double salt methylammonium lead iodide , with a perovskite structure. The reaction changes the film&#x27;s color from yellow to light brown.

 is also used as a high-energy photon detector for gamma-rays and X-rays, due to its wide band gap which ensures low noise operation.

Lead iodide was formerly used as a paint pigment under the name &quot;iodine yellow&quot;. It was described by Prosper Mérimée (1830) as &quot;not yet much known in commerce, is as bright as orpiment or chromate of lead. It is thought to be more permanent; but time only can prove its pretension to so essential a quality. It is prepared by precipitating a solution of acetate or nitrate of lead, with potassium iodide: the nitrate produces a more brilliant yellow color.&quot; However, due to the toxicity and instability of the compound it is no longer used as such. It may still be used in art for bronzing and in gold-like mosaic tiles.

== Stability ==
Common material characterization techniques such as electron microscopy can damage samples of lead(II) iodide. Thin films of lead(II) iodide are unstable in ambient air. Ambient air oxygen oxidizes iodide into elemental iodine:

== Toxicity ==

Lead iodide is very toxic to human health. Ingestion will cause many acute and chronic consequences characteristic of lead poisoning. Lead iodide has been found to be a carcinogen in animals suggesting the same may hold true in humans. Lead iodide is an inhalation hazard, and appropriate respirators should be used when handling powders of lead iodide.

== Structure ==

The structure of , as determined by X-ray powder diffraction, is primarily hexagonal close-packed system with alternating between layers of lead atoms and iodide atoms, with largely ionic bonding. Weak van der Waals interactions have been observed between lead–iodide layers. The most common stacking forms are 2H and 4H. The 4H polymorph is most common in samples grown from the melt, by precipitation, or by sublimation, whereas the 2H polymorph is usually formed by sol-gel synthesis. The solid can also take an R6 rhombohedral structure.

<text>Roger John Tayler (25 October 1929 – 23 January 1997) was a British astronomer. Tayler made important contributions to stellar structure and evolution, plasma stability, nucleogenesis and cosmology. He wrote a number of textbooks. He collaborated with Fred Hoyle and Stephen Hawking at the University of Cambridge on problems of helium production in cosmology.

==Education==
He was educated at Solihull School (1940–1947) and worked first at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell and Culham, and then at Cambridge University where he was a lecturer in mathematics and a Fellow of Corpus Christi College before moving to the University of Sussex in 1966. In 1969 he was appointed professor of astronomy at Gresham College, London.

==Career==
He was Secretary (1971–79), Treasurer (1979–87) and finally President (1989–90) of the Royal Astronomical Society. In March 1995 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. His candidacy citation read &quot;Roger Tayler&#x27;s versatile career in Astronomy started with pioneering studies in stellar evolution, including his discovery of semi-convection. At Harwell, his work on plasma stability included a discussion of the stabilised pinch and the prediction of instabilities produced by finite resistivity. He subsequently applied this expertise to a study of the stability of stellar magnetic fields and to the interaction of rotation and magnetic fields with convection. In cosmology, he calculated (with Hoyle) the cosmic helium abundance, stressing the importance of the number of neutrino types, and he pointed out the significance of the neutron half-life. In nucleosynthesis he calculated the abundances of iron peak elements produced at high temperatures, and recently he has been deeply involved with the chemical evolution of galaxies. He has written substantial and penetrating review articles, and text-books used the world over. In addition he has given outstanding public service, especially through the Royal Astronomical Society.&quot;

He was appointed OBE in the 1990 New Year Honours.

<text>The Mazda-Go (Japanese: マツダ号) is a three-wheeled truck that was first produced in 1931 and resembled a motorcycle with an open wagon or truck bed. It entered the market on 3 October 1931. It was the first vehicle manufactured by Mazda and has been considered to be the first auto rickshaw built, although Daihatsu&#x27;s HB appeared in the same year. The original model&#x27;s type name was DA, with the &quot;Mazda-Go&quot; brand name being used to sell it and subsequent generations. After a July 1931 agreement, the Mazda-Go was sold by the Mitsubishi Zaibatsu in Japan and later on in export markets as well. Mitsubishi retained the distribution rights in Japan until August 1936, and for export sales until December 1937. Development had begun in 1929, a year after Mazda&#x27;s first trial production of motorcycles.

The Mazda-Go was steered with handlebars and powered with an air-cooled one-cylinder engine/transmission combination unit. Notable refinements included a rear differential and the addition of a reverse gear. The in-house developed engine displaced 482 cc and produced , powering the rear wheels through a three-speed transmission. Over the years, it would be produced in different variants and spawned other similar designs such as the Hopestar and Daihatsu Midget. A more powerful version called the DB soon appeared, and a number of other Mazda-Go iterations like the DC and the heavier KC types. The last version to appear before World War II was the 1938 GA-type, which re-entered production in December 1945 as Mazda&#x27;s first post-war product. The GA has a 669 cc sidevalve single-cylinder engine producing and a cargo load of while it itself weighed in at .

The Mazda-Go range was replaced in the post-war era by an entire range of three-wheeled Mazda trucks, including the K360 and the Mazda T-2000 (ja).

<doc id="766282" wikidata="Q463242" url="?curid=766282" title="Bumthang District">
<text>Bumthang District (Dzongkha: བུམ་ཐང་རྫོང་ཁག་; Wylie: &quot;Bum-thang rzong-khag&quot;) is one of the 20 dzongkhag (districts) comprising Bhutan. It contains numerous temples and Buddhist sacred sites. The district is divided into four &quot;gewogs&quot; (village blocks), each corresponding to a major glacial valley: Choekor, Tang, Ura, and Chhume. The latter valley is also called Bumthang, lending its name to the whole district.

&quot;Bumthang&quot; directly translates as &quot;beautiful field&quot; – &quot;thang&quot; means field or flat place, and &quot;bum&quot; is said be an abbreviation of either &quot;bumpa&quot; (a vessel for holy water, thus describing the shape and nature of the valley), or simply &quot;bum&quot; (&quot;girl&quot;, indicating this is the valley of beautiful girls). The name is said to have arisen after the construction of Jambay Lhakhang.

==Economy==

Bumthang&#x27;s primary agricultural products are wheat, buckwheat, dairy, honey, apples, potatoes, rice, and wool. Bumthang is also nationally famous for its textiles, such as yathra and mathra weaving. 

==Languages==
East Bodish languages are primarily spoken in Bumthang District.

The language spoken in the Bumthang district is known as Bumthangkha. It is a Tibeto-Burman language mutually intelligible with Khengkha and closely related to Dzongkha, the national language of Bhutan. Bumthangkha is partially comprehensible to speakers of Dzongkha, which originated in valleys to the west of Bumthang. Each of the four valleys of Bumthang has its own dialect, and the remnants of the Kheng kingdom, near and in Zhemgang District to the south, speak Khengkha. Historically, Bhumthangkha and its speakers have had close contact with speakers of Kurtöpkha to the east, Nupbikha to the west, and Khengkha to the south, to the extent that they may be considered part of a wider collection of &quot;Bumthang languages&quot;.

Brokkat, an endangered Southern Bodish language, is spoken by about 300 people in the village of Dhur in Bumthang Valley. The language is a remnant of pastoral yakherd communities.

==Environment==
Most of Bumthang District is part of Bhutan&#x27;s extensive protected areas network. The northern two-thirds of the district (the &quot;gewogs&quot; of Chhoekhor and Tang) belong to Wangchuck Centennial Park, buffered by pockets of biological corridors. Southern Bumthang (the &quot;gewogs&quot; of Chhumig and Ura) is part of another protected area, Thrumshingla National Park.
Bumthang has a large migratory population of black-necked cranes, which hold cultural significance.

<text>Barroso or Terras de Barroso (&quot;Lands of Barroso&quot;) is the traditional name of the region formed by the Portuguese municipalities of Montalegre and Boticas.

The Terras de Barroso existed as an administrative division of Portugal from 1273 to 1876, and the term &quot;Barroso&quot; and &quot;Barrosã/Barrosão&quot; (adjective) continue to be widely used to refer to the distinctive and isolated heritage, culture and landscape of this area. The region was one of the first in Europe, in 2018, to be recognised by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation as a &#x27;Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System.&#x27; The stocky Barrosã cattle with long curved horns are farmed across the North of Portugal and have been extensively studied because of their ancient genetic heritage.
==History==
The area is notable for the discovery of Gallaecian warrior statues - powerful, slightly larger than life size, stone images of iron age warrior heroes, dating to the immediate pre-Roman era.

&quot;Terras de Barroso&quot; refers to one of the ancient &quot;terras&quot;, administrative and judicial structures, in which Portugal was divided from the 11th century. The term is first found in the will of Saint Rosende from 942 includes among his possessions a herd of cows &quot;in Barosa.&quot; The first incontrovertible use of the term &quot;Barroso&quot; is in a Galician document from 1100 which indicates that the term Barroso refers to the &quot;villa&quot; of Tourém. Possibly, the original administrative centre of this region was the castle of São Romão, which occupies a now uninhabited site on the southern bank of the Alto-Rabagão dam.

<text>Chukha District (Dzongkha: ཆུ་ཁ་རྫོང་ཁག་; Wylie: &quot;Chu-kha rdzong-khag&quot;; officially spelled &quot;Chhukha&quot; ) is one of the 20 dzongkhag (districts) comprising Bhutan. The major town is Phuentsholing.

==Languages==
In Chukha, the main native languages are Dzongkha, the national language, and Nepali, spoken by the Lhotshampa in the south. The Bhutanese Lhokpu language, spoken by the Lhop minority, is also present in the southwest along the border with Samtse District.

==Administrative divisions==
Chukha District is divided into eleven village blocks (or &quot;gewogs&quot;):

*Bjacho Gewog
*Bongo Gewog
*Chapcha Gewog
*Dala Gewog
*Dungna Gewog
*Geling Gewog
*Getena Gewog
*Logchina Gewog
*Metakha Gewog
*Phuentsholing Gewog
*Sampheling Gewog
==Environment==
Chukha Dzongkhag covers 1,880 sq. km, but unlike most other districts, Chukha, along with Samtse, contain no protected areas of Bhutan. Although much of southern Bhutan contained protected areas in the 1960s, park-level environmental protection became untenable.

==Infrastructure==
Chukha contains Bhutan&#x27;s oldest hydropower plant, Chukha hydel (completed in 1986–88), and Tala Hydroelectricity Project, the country&#x27;s largest power plant.

== Tourism ==

<doc id="766286" wikidata="Q665286" url="?curid=766286" title="Luk thung">
<text>Luk thung (, , ) is a genre of Thai music that emerged after World War II in the central region of Thailand. The genre was derived from phleng Thai sakon, and developed in the early-20th century. Suphan Buri in particular became the center of &quot;luk thung&quot; music, producing many major artists, including Suraphol Sombatcharoen, and Pumpuang Duangjan. The genre has been prominently popularized in the northeastern region, having from its beginnings drawn upon northeastern &quot;mor lam&quot; musical traditions and the northeastern Isan language.

&quot;Luk thung&quot; songs consist of poetic lyrics that often reflect the rural lifestyle, cultural traits and social patterns in Thailand. The songs
are typically sung with a distinctive country accent and common use of vibrato, and are harmonized with Western instruments, mostly brass and electronic instruments, alongside Thai traditional instruments such as the khaen and phin. Lyrically, the songs dealt with a range of themes, often based on Thai rural life: rural poverty, romantic love, the beauty of rural scenery, religious beliefs, traditional culture, and political crisis.

The first recording of what was considered &quot;luk thung&quot; was, &quot;Mae Saao Chaao Rai&quot; (&quot;Lady Farmer&quot;), written by Hem Vejakorn for Suraphol Sombatcharoen in 1938, a released soundtrack for the radio drama, &quot;Saao Chaao Rai&quot; (&quot;Lady Farmer&quot;). The term &quot;luk thung&quot; was first coined on 1 May 1964 by Chamnong Rangsikul who started a TV show for Channel 4 titled &quot;Phleng Luk Thung&quot;.

==History==
===Origin===
&quot;Luk thung&quot; traces its roots from &quot;phleng Thai sakon&quot;, which adopted Western instrumental characteristics like the orchestra and electronic instruments in the time of King Rama IV. &quot;Phleng Thai sakon&quot; continuously evolved throughout the time of King Rama V, and was showcased in numerous films and stage performances. Atiphob Pataradetpisan&#x27;s, &quot;Waltz Pleumchit&quot; (&quot;Delighted Mind Waltz&quot;) in 1903 was recorded to be the first Thai &quot;sakon&quot; song.

During Plaek Phibunsongkhram&#x27;s government (1938-1944), &quot;phleng Thai sakon&quot; became a form of propaganda for the government to broadcast its political ideology of modernization in Thailand. In 1939, Eua Sunthornsanan formed the first Thai &quot;sakon&quot; band, called &quot;Suntharaporn&quot;, using a number of classically trained musicians who had lost their royal appointments following the 1932 coup. Eua Sunthornsanan served the Prime Minister, Plaek Phibunsongkhram, as the head of Thailand&#x27;s main orchestra, and the music section for Thailand&#x27;s Public Relations Department. He dominated the music industry by composing over 2,000 songs, leading him to become one of the most influential pioneers of &quot;phleng Thai sakon&quot;. Some of his notable records were, &quot;Phleng Wattanatum&quot; (&quot;Culture song&quot;), &quot;Phleng Faai&quot; (&quot;Cotton song&quot;), and &quot;Phleng Saang Thai&quot; (&quot;Building Thailand song&quot;).

In 1944 the &quot;Romvong&quot; dance was introduced by the Phibun government&#x27;s Fine Arts Department when it issued ten &quot;Ramvong Matrathan&quot; (&quot;standard circle dances&quot;) to compete against Western dance music. It is suggested that Phibun and his wife, La-iat, had observed rural &quot;Ramthon&quot; (&quot;Drum Dance&quot;) performances while visiting Phetchabun province and surrounding areas. La-iat noted some of the texts and melodies and these notes formed the basis of the Fine Arts Department&#x27;s &quot;Ramvong Matrathan&quot;. This was a critical step in the future formulation of &quot;luk thung&quot;. &quot;Ramvong&quot; went on to become a highly successful musical genre in Thailand for a decade after the mid-1940s. It was &quot;Ramvong&quot; that bought northeastern performers such as Tumthong Chokchana (a.k.a. Benjamin), born in Ubon, and Chaloemchai Sriruecha, born in Roi Et, into the Thai music industry and so paved the way for the heavy northeastern influence on &quot;luk thung&quot; music when it emerged.

===First generation===
After World War II, Thailand experienced economic growth, which led to inflation within the country, including a severe shortage of supplies of rice. The entertainment and commercial industries quickly recovered, and artists were able to resume their recording careers. The aftermath of the war influenced new music trends, in particular, lyrics that highlighted the social crisis and government pressure after the war, as well as political and economic concerns.

The first generation emerged from 1945 to 1957. The new style of Thai Sakon evolved into two directions of cultural traits: rural &quot;Luk Thung&quot;, and urban &quot;Luk Krung&quot; (&quot;Child of the City&quot;). The original form of &quot;luk thung&quot; was called &quot;phleng talat&quot; (&quot;market music&quot;), or also referred to as &quot;phleng chiwit&quot; (&quot;life music&quot;). The term &quot;phleng talat&quot; was initially used to refer to &quot;luk thung&quot; songs that were popular in temple markets and festivities, and &quot;phleng chiwit&quot; was used to refer to songs that lyrically reflected people&#x27;s way of life and social concerns. Early &quot;phleng chiwit&quot; artists include Saeng Napha Boonra-Sri, Saneh Komanchun, and Suraphol Sombatcharoen.

The term &quot;luk thung&quot; gained popularity in 1964. According to Prakob Chaipipat, Manager of Thai Television Channel 4, &quot;on 11th May, 1964, Jumnong Rangsikul established a TV show, called &quot;Phleng Chao Baan&quot; (&quot;folk song&quot;) and showcased three &quot;phleng talat&quot; artists: Porm Pirom, Pongsri Woranuch, and Toon Tongjai. However, the show was soon taken off the air by Ajin Panjapan, due to its negative reception. In December 1964, Jumnong Rangsikul revived the show, and renamed it &quot;Phleng Luk Thung&quot; (&quot;child of the field music&quot;). After six months the show gained prominent acceptance from society. Moreover, it initiated a trend of &quot;luk thung&quot; TV shows. &quot;Luk Thung Krung Thai&quot; (&quot;Thai capital luk thung&quot;) was later aired by TV Channel 4. &quot;Luk thung&quot; music gained massive national television exposure, leading to a rapid increase in the number of new artists and songs.&quot;
===Golden age of &quot;luk thung&quot;===
Suraphol Sombatcharoen played a major role in launching &quot;luk thung&#x27;s&quot; earliest records in the late-1950s to 1960s, leading &quot;luk thung&quot; to reach its peak of popularity; this earned him the title &quot;king of &quot;luk thung&quot;&quot;. He composed over 100 songs, includes his first hit, &quot;Nam Da Sow Vienne&quot; (&quot;Tears of a Lao Girl&quot;) and many well-known records such as &quot;Sieow Sai&quot; (&quot;Stomachache Nervous&quot;), &quot;Kong Bplom&quot; (&quot;Fake Stuff&quot;) and &quot;Sao Suan Taeng&quot; (&quot;The Girl of the Cucumber Farm&quot;).

In February 1966, Somyot Thassanaphan became the first &quot;luk thung&quot; artist to win the Thai Royal Golden Disk Award, with &quot;Chor Tip Ruang Tong&quot; (&quot;Divine Bouquet of Gold&quot;), composed by Payong Mookda.

===Age of musical film===
In 1970, the release of &quot;Monrak Luk Thung&quot; (&quot;Luk Thung Love Spell&quot;), directed by Rangsi Thatnopyak and starring Mitr Chaibancha and Petchara Chaowarat, popularized &quot;luk thung&quot; throughout Thailand. This led to a rapid increase of musical films showcasing &quot;luk thung&quot; music, and provided an opportunity for many new artists later in the period. Some of the notable films include &quot;Mae Sri Phai&quot; (&quot;Mother Sri Phai&quot;) and &quot;Thung Setti&quot; (&quot;Country Millionaire&quot;). These were followed by &quot;Tone&quot;, which starred the rising artist of the period, Sangthong Sisai. Sangthong&#x27;s records incorporate energetic tempo and rhythm, demonstrated in his famous hit, &quot;Lung Sang Thong&quot; (&quot;Uncle Sang Thong&quot;).

During Thanom Kittikachorn&#x27;s government, most records emphasized resistance to the corrupt government. &quot;Yom Mabarn Jao Ka&quot; (&quot;King of Hell&quot;) gained Buppha Saichol attention due to her depiction of opposing views towards the government, leading her to become one of the most successful artists of the period.

===&quot;Haang kreuang&quot; and concerts===

In more recent times, groups of backup dancers dressed in Western-influenced fancy costumes (known as &quot;haang kreung&quot;) have become an essential component in &quot;luk thung&quot; concerts. Pumpuang Duangjan was the most successful &quot;luk thung&quot; female artist of the period; she pioneered a new style by incorporating string music into &quot;luk thung&quot;, resulting in a genre called electronic &quot;luk thung&quot;. Her first record was &quot;Phleng Kaew Raw Pi&quot; (&quot;Kaew, Wait for Me&quot;), followed by many other hits, earning her the title &quot;queen of &quot;luk thung&quot;&quot;.

<doc id="766291" wikidata="Q578294" url="?curid=766291" title="Gasa District">
<text>Gasa District (; , also ) is one of the 20 dzongkhags (districts) comprising Bhutan. The capital of Gasa District is Gasa Dzong near Gasa. It is located in the far north of the county and spans the Middle and High regions of the Tibetan Himalayas. The dominant language of the district is Dzongkha, which is the national language. Related languages, Layakha and Lunanakha, are spoken by semi-nomadic communities in the north of the district. The People&#x27;s Republic of China claims the northern part of Gasa District.

Gasa has an area of ,
formerly . It had a population of 3,116 as of the 2005 census, making it the largest, least populated, and thus least densely populated of all the dzongkhags; it is also the least developed district of Bhutan.

==History==
Gasa was formerly a &quot;drungkhag&quot; (sub-district) of the Punakha &quot;dzongkhag&quot; (district). It became a separate &quot;dzongkhag&quot; in 1992, the start of 7th Five Year Plan.

==Administrative divisions==

Gasa District is divided into four village blocks (or &quot;gewogs&quot;):

* Khamaed Gewog, formerly known as ⋅Goenkhamae
* Khatoed Gewog, formerly known as Goenkaatoe
* Laya Gewog
* Lunana Gewog

==Geography==
Gasa is bordered to the north by Tibet Autonomous Region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and by Thimphu, Punakha, and Wangdue Phodrang dzongkhags to the south.

==Economy==
Gasa has become a tourist destination because of its pristine forests and the exceptionally scenic location of its Dzong. In 2008 a massive flood on the Mo Chhu (Female River) destroyed a popular hot spring complex, which is under restoration and was to re-open in late 2011. The high altitude makes farming difficult, although government programs seek to establish mustard and summer vegetable planting programs. Residents herd yaks and dzos, and a small number benefit from the nascent tourism industry. A narrow road from Punakha, which is mostly unpaved, reaches up to the Dzong and is now being extended up to Laya. The majority of the known herds of wild Takin occur in Gasa. Electricity is also being supplied to some of the gewogs and all electrification programs are expected to be completed by 2012.

Gasa is most famous for its Layap people and the Snowman Trek, one of the most challenging treks in the Himalayas.

==Environment==
All of Gasa is an environmentally protected area of Bhutan. Most parts of the dzongkhag lie within Jigme Dorji National Park (Khamaed, Khatoed, Laya, Lunana Gewogs), although the northeast reaches of Gasa are part of Wangchuck Centennial Park (Lunana Gewog). Several of Bhutan&#x27;s glaciers are located in Gasa, namely in Lunana Gewog, which borders Tibet.

<text>Lhuentse District (Dzongkha: ལྷུན་རྩེ་རྫོང་ཁག་; Wylie: &quot;Lhun-rtse rdzong-khag&quot;; previously &quot;Lhuntshi&quot;, and officially spelled &quot;Lhuentse&quot; ) is one of the 20 dzongkhag (districts) comprising Bhutan. It consists of 2506 households. Located in the northeast, Lhuentse is one of the least developed dzhongkhags of Bhutan. There are few roads, the first gas station was opened in September 2005, electricity is not well distributed, and the difficult terrain makes distribution of social welfare problematic. Despite its favorable climate, farming is hindered by the lack of infrastructure.

==Culture==
Lhuentse is culturally part of eastern Bhutan. The languages and lifestyle of its inhabitants may be contrasted against the dominant western Ngalop culture.

This region is renowned as a textiles producing region and as the ancestral homeland of the Bhutanese royal family. It is also well known for the domestic tourism spots such as Singye Dzong, Sangwai Draduk, Rinchen Bumpa, Takila, Yamalung, Rawabee Lhakhang, Khampalung Ney Tshachu and Phuningla. 

=== Alcohol ===
Eastern Bhutanese culture is distinctive in its high alcohol consumption in relation to other parts of Bhutan. Ara, the traditional alcohol of Bhutan, is most often home made from rice or maize, either fermented or distilled. It may only be legally produced and consumed privately. Ara production is unregulated in method and quality. Its sale has been prohibited in Bhutan and enforced since a severe crackdown. However, because ara returns far more profit than other forms of maize, many Bhutanese farmers have pressed for legal reform.

The Bhutanese government, meanwhile, is intent on discouraging excessive alcohol consumption, abuse, and associated diseases through taxation and regulation.

Through government efforts to reduce ara production and consumption in Lhuentse District, locals conceded in 2011 that something should be done to curb the distinctly eastern Bhutanese tradition of heavy drinking. The government&#x27;s strategy is to reduce ara production and consumption gradually until it is eliminated. Alcoholism and ara production have been notable topics of political discussion Bhutan, especially at the local level. Ara, however, is culturally relevant for its religious and medicinal uses. In 2011, the government passed its Alcohol Control Regulation, which imposed up to three times the previous taxes on alcohol. As a result, alcohol sales have dropped and prices have risen.

===Languages===
Lhuentse is home to a variety of language groups. In the east, Dzala an East Bodish language, is spoken. In southern Lhuentse, Chocangacakha, a sister language to Dzongkha, is spoken. The northern and western parts of the district are known as the Kurtö region, where inhabitants speak the East Bodish Kurtöp language.

==Administrative divisions==
Lhuntse District is divided into eight village blocks (or &quot;gewogs&quot;):

*Gangzur Gewog
*Jaray Gewog
*Khoma Gewog
*Kurtoe Gewog
*Menbi Gewog
*Metsho Gewog
*Minjay Gewog
*Tsenkhar Gewog
Within these divisions are individual villages with small populations such as Autsho.

===Geography===
Most of Lhuentse District is part of the environmentally protected areas of Bhutan. The district contains parts of Wangchuck Centennial Park in the north (the &quot;gewogs&quot; of Gangzur, Khoma and Kurtoed), Thrumshingla National Park in the south (the &quot;gewogs&quot; of Gangzur, Jarey and Metsho), and Bumdeling Wildlife Sanctuary in the east (the &quot;gewogs&quot; of Khoma and Minjay). These three parks are connected by biological corridors that crisscross the central and southern regions of the district.

<doc id="766298" wikidata="Q389734" url="?curid=766298" title="Mongar District">
<text>Mongar District (Dzongkha: མོང་སྒར་རྫོང་ཁག་; Wylie: &quot;Mong-sgar rdzong-khag&quot;) is one of the 20 dzongkhags (districts) comprising Bhutan. Mongar is the fastest-developing dzongkhag in eastern Bhutan. A regional hospital has been constructed and the region is bustling with many economic activities. Mongar is noted for its lemon grass, a plant that can be used to produce an essential oil. It also has a hydroelectric power-plant on the Kuri Chhu river. Mongar is notable for having the longest work time in all the dzongkhags of Bhutan.

==Languages==

Mongar is home to a variety of Bhutanese languages and dialects. In the east, the East Bodish Tshangla (Sharchopkha) is the dominant language, also used as a regional &quot;lingua franca&quot;.

Central Mongar is the only region where the East Bodish Chali language is spoken, by about at total of 8,200 people in Wangmakhar, Gorsum and Tormazhong villages, mainly in and around Chhali Gewog on the east bank of the Kuri Chhu River. Some people from Tormazhong speaks kurteop too. 

Southern Mongar is likewise unique for its 1,000 Gongduk speakers living in a few inaccessible villages of Gongdue Gewog near the Kuri Chhu river. The language appears to be the sole representative of a unique branch of the Tibeto-Burman language family and retains the complex verbal agreement system of Proto-Tibeto-Burman.

In southwestern Mongar, residents speak Khengkha, an East Bodish language closely related to Bumthangkha languages including Kurtöp. Bumthangkha itself is also spoken by the natives of extreme northwest Mongar. Residents of the Kuri Chhu valley of northern Mongar speak Chochangachakha language, a Central Bodish language very closely related to Dzongkha, the national language.

==Administrative divisions==
Mongar is divided into seventeen village blocks (or &quot;gewogs&quot;):

*Balam Gewog
*Chaskhar Gewog
*Chhali Gewog
*Drametse Gewog
*Drepung Gewog
*Gongdue Gewog
*Jurmey Gewog
*Kengkhar Gewog
*Mongar Gewog
*Narang Gewog
*Ngatshang Gewog
*Saleng Gewog
*Sherimung Gewog
*Silambi Gewog
*Thangrong Gewog
*Tsakaling Gewog
*Tsamang Gewog
==Geography==
The Western Mongar District contains part of the Thrumshingla National Park (the &quot;gewogs&quot; of Saling and the Tsamang) and the northeastern Mongar District contains part of the Bumdeling Wildlife Sanctuary (the &quot;gewog&quot; of Sharmung).

The Kuri Chhu river flows through the Mongar District valley. The Kuri Chhu, a major river of eastern Bhutan, is a tributary of the Manas River system, which is the largest river in Bhutan and a major tributary of the Brahmaputra River, the waterway that drains most of the eastern region.

<doc id="766300" wikidata="Q7407350" url="?curid=766300" title="Sam Coslow">
<text>Sam Coslow (December 27, 1902 – April 2, 1982) was an American songwriter, singer, film producer, publisher and market analyst. Coslow was born in New York City. He began writing songs as a teenager. He contributed songs to Broadway revues, formed the music publishing company Spier and Coslow with Larry Spier and made a number of recordings as a performer.

With the explosion of film musicals in the late 1920s, Hollywood attracted a number of ambitious young songwriters, and Coslow joined them in 1929. Coslow and his partner Larry Spier sold their publishing business to Paramount Pictures and Coslow became a Paramount songwriter. One of his first assignments for the studio was the score for the 1930 film &quot;The Virtuous Sin&quot;. He formed a successful partnership with composer Arthur Johnston and together they provided the scores for a number of films including Bing Crosby vehicles.

Coslow became a film producer in the 1940s and won the Academy Award for Best Short Film for his production &quot;Heavenly Music&quot; in 1943. He was married to actress Esther Muir from 1934 to 1948, and they had a daughter, Jacqueline Coslow, who also worked as an actress. In 1953 he married cabaret singer, Frances King, of Cafe Societie duo Noble &amp; King. Sam and Frances remained married until his death in 1982. Together they had a daughter, Cara Coslow, who gained notoriety as Head of Casting for Carsey Werner Productions and the Producer of the television series &quot;Dante&#x27;s Cove&quot;. Cara Coslow is also an author of two books.

During the 1960s Coslow&#x27;s work shifted from music and film to market analysis. During this time Coslow founded the publishing company Investor&#x27;s Press, which published investing books and the newsletter &quot;Indicator Digest.&quot; During the 1970s Coslow wrote two books, &quot;Cocktails for Two&quot; which focused on his musical career and &quot;Super Yields&quot; which focused on investing. He died in Bronxville in 1982, aged 79.

<doc id="766301" wikidata="Q167279" url="?curid=766301" title="Pemagatshel District">
<text>Pemagatshel District (Dzongkha: པདྨ་དགའ་ཚལ་་རྫོང་ཁག་; Wylie: &quot;Pema-gatshel rdzong-khag&quot;) is one of the 20 Dzongkhags (districts) in Bhutan.

Until 1970, the name of the district was known as Khoi Dung. His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche named the district &quot;Pemagatshel&quot; which translates to “Blissful Land of the Lotus”- &quot;Pema&quot; means the Lotus and &quot;gatshel&quot; is blissful land. It is said that if one stands at the location of old Pemagatshel dzong and look around, the place resemble a full bloomed lotus. 

== Dzongkhag Profile ==
Pemagatshel is located in the south east of Bhutan with an area of 517.8 km2 and has a total of 2,547 households. The dzongkhag is characterized by highly dissected mountain ranges, steep slopes and narrow valleys with little flat land. The elevation in the dzongkhag ranges from 1,000 meters to 3,500 meters above the sea level. The dzongkhag experiences an average annual rainfall of 1500 mm to 3000 mm.

The dzongkhag is administratively divided into eleven gewogs. Rugged terrain and scattered settlements make the delivery of services in the dzongkhag both difficult as well as expensive.

About 53% of the total area is under forest cover, mainly coniferous and broadleaf species. With about 45% of the total land area under cultivation, the dzongkhag has a good percentage of arable land. Land holdings are, however, dominated by Tseri cultivation with only negligible wetland farming activities. Dry land cultivation is also a dominant agricultural practice with maize
grown as the main cereal crop.

The potential for the development of horticulture crops like cardamom, ginger and oranges exist in some gewogs like Khar, Dungme and Chongshing Borang but is constrained by the lack of access to roads and markets. Other problems faced by most farmers include the lack of water sources for irrigation and extensive wildlife crop depredation.

In 2001, education was provided to 3740 students by a total of 16 schools ranging from primary to middle secondary schools while health services were delivered by a dzongkhag general hospital, four basic health units and 22 outreach clinics. A total of 88 rural water supply schemes provide piped drinking water facility. Agriculture and livestock extension services are provided by six RNR extension centers, two agriculture extension centers, two Livestock Extension center and a one fodder seed production center.

Inadequate power supply, limited road accessibility and market outlets constitute major challenges to development in the dzongkhag. Off-farm employment in gypsum mines; roads and other construction works constitute an important source of income for the people. The production of cultural and religious items such as , , , tea leaves, and Yurung bura (textile) also generate cash income. The commissioning of Kurichu Power Project and the provision of adequate electricity supply can go a long way in accelerating economic and social development activities in the dzongkhag.

== Language ==
Native speak Tshangla (Sharchopkha), an East Bodish language that is the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of eastern Bhutan. 

==Population==
The Pemagatshel district, as of 2005, had a population of 13,864. In February 2011, some 42 households in remote areas of Pemagatshel were slated for relocation closer to population centers in order to provide better access to resources, both natural and governmental. Proponents for this move cited Gross National Happiness as a reason to improve living standards through relocation. This model, if successful, would be replicated in Haa and Lhuentse Districts.

== Vision ==
&quot;A progressive Dzongkhag built on the foundation of economic prosperity, social cohesion and efficient services.&quot;

== Mission ==
“Economic Prosperity, Social Cohesion and Efficient Services”

<text>Charles Joseph Angus (born November 14, 1962) is a Canadian author, journalist, broadcaster, musician and politician. A member of the New Democratic Party (NDP), Angus has been the federal Member of Parliament for the riding of Timmins—James Bay since winning the 2004 election. He is the NDP critic for Ethics, Federal Economic Development, Initiative for Northern Ontario, Indigenous Youth, Income Inequality and Affordability, and Deputy Critic for Labour.

Angus was a candidate for leadership of the federal NDP in the 2017 election, where he received 19.4% of the vote.

He is the author of &quot;.&quot;

==Early life, music, writing, and activism==
Angus was born in Timmins, Ontario, and moved to Toronto in 1973, where in 1980 he co-founded the punk rock band L&#x27;Étranger with childhood friend Andrew Cash. Angus performed bass and co-wrote many of the group&#x27;s songs, which were influenced by the Clash and the group&#x27;s Catholic social justice roots. L&#x27;Étranger is best known for their anti-apartheid single &quot;One People&quot;, played frequently on the then-new MuchMusic. Angus later co-founded the alternative folk group Grievous Angels. After his election to Parliament, Angus continued to perform with the group on occasion and released a new album in 2021.

Angus was a community activist in Toronto in the 1980s where, along with his wife Brit Griffin, he established a Catholic Worker house and a homeless shelter for men, especially those who were minority refugees and former prisoners. He moved to Cobalt, Ontario, with his young family in 1990; further, in 1995, Brit and Charlie launched &quot;HighGrader&quot;, a magazine devoted to Northern Ontario life and culture. In 1999, he received an award from the Northern Lights Festival Boréal in Sudbury for his outstanding contributions to Northern Ontario culture.

He is the author of eight published books, including an admiring biography of Les Costello, the celebrated Toronto Maple Leafs player who left professional hockey to become a Catholic priest in Timmins. Angus&#x27;s fifth book, &quot;Cage Call&quot;, a photo documentary with photographer Louie Palu, was released in 2007.

From 2000 to 2004, Angus served as a trustee on the Northeastern Catholic District School Board.

==Federal politics==
Angus entered federal politics in the 2004 election as the successful New Democratic Party candidate in the Ontario riding of Timmins—James Bay, winning election to the House of Commons of Canada by fewer than 600 votes. He was re-elected in the 2006 federal election with an outright majority, over six thousand votes ahead of Liberal challenger Robert Riopelle. Angus was the NDP critic for Canadian heritage from 2004 to 2007, and was additionally critic for agriculture from 2004 to 2006.

In 2005, Angus&#x27;s parish priest, Father John Lemire, confronted him and threatened to deny him Holy Communion if he voted with the government and his party to legalize same-sex marriage. Angus stood his ground and was denied communion. Angus&#x27;s treatment provoked widespread public reaction both from those who supported the church&#x27;s stance, and those who supported Angus. Some Catholic MPs were in the latter group, arguing that the Church was selective in its exclusion of practising Catholic MPs from its activities: Angus and fellow NDP MP [[Joe Comartin] were the only two Catholic MPs who supported same-sex marriage but were excluded.

In 2007, he became the [[New Democratic Party Shadow Cabinet of the 39th Parliament of Canada|NDP critic]] for [[Public Services and Procurement Canada|Public Works]] and [[Treasury Board]], as well as the NDP spokesman for digital issues such as [[copyright]] and [[internet neutrality]].

In 2006, after he had served just two years as a Member of Parliament, the &quot;[[Toronto Star]]&quot; selected Angus as one of the ten most effective opposition MPs. He also won &quot;Best Constituent Representative&quot; at the 2007 &quot;[[Maclean&#x27;s]]&quot; Parliamentarian of the Year Awards. Angus was re-elected in the federal elections of both [[2008 Canadian federal election|2008]] and [[2011 Canadian federal election|2011]]. Angus also served as the party&#x27;s spokesperson on privacy, ethics, and government accountability. Angus voted against a bill to abolish the [[Canadian Firearms Registry]] in September 2010. Although the registry is unpopular with many of his constituents, Angus voted against its abolition based on supportive studies provided by police. He subsequently introduced a [[private member&#x27;s bill]] to reform the registry.

He was named to &quot;[[Maclean&#x27;s]]&quot; magazine&#x27;s Power List in 2012 as one of the 25 most influential Canadians. The same year, &quot;Zoomer Magazine&quot; chose him as the third most influential Canadian over the age of 45; he was one of only two MPs on the list, alongside NDP leader [[Tom Mulcair]]. In 2011, [[CTV News Channel (Canada)|CTV News Channel]]&#x27;s &quot;[[Power Play (Canadian political affairs series)|Power Play]]&quot; placed him among the top three MPs of the year, along with the then [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]], [[Stephen Harper]], and NDP leader [[Jack Layton]], who had died that August. In 2012, Angus backed [[Paul Dewar]] to become [[2012 New Democratic Party leadership election|leader of the NDP]].

Angus has been an advocate for the rights of First Nations children and was the co-founder of the [[Shannen&#x27;s Dream]] campaign, named in honour of the late Cree youth leader Shannen Koostachin, whom Angus fought with to build a new elementary school for her community. In early 2012, Angus&#x27; parliamentary motion &quot;Shannen&#x27;s Dream&quot; calling for an end to the systemic underfunding of First Nations education passed unanimously through the House of Commons.

After the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 federal election]], he was appointed NDP critic for [[Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs|Indigenous and Northern Affairs]] in the [[42nd Canadian Parliament]] and elected Caucus Chair in January 2016. He was also a member of the Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development committee. He resigned from both roles on November 23, 2016, in to prepare for the 2017 [[2017 New Democratic Party leadership election|New Democratic Party leadership race]]. On February 20, 2017, Angus officially registered to run in the NDP leadership race to succeed [[Tom Mulcair]]. He placed second with 19.4% of the vote, losing to then Ontario provincial politician [[Jagmeet Singh]]. MPs [[Niki Ashton]] and [[Guy Caron]] respectively came in third and fourth.

Angus was re-elected in the [[2019 Canadian federal election|2019]] and [[2021 Canadian federal election|2021 federal elections]].

On April 4, 2024, Angus announced that he would not be running for re-election in the [[2025 Canadian federal election]].

Located about sixty kilometers away from the main town, the area near the famous mirror cliff (melong brak) is a sub-tropical forest with a warm climate and a variety of broadleaf trees. This makes it a popular place for birdwatching, as it&#x27;s home to approximately 360 different bird species found in Bhutan, such as the Beautiful Nuthatch, Crimson Sunbird, Asian Emerald Cuckoo, Greater Goldenback, Ruby-cheeked Sunbird, and White-browed Scimitar Babbler. Birdwatching is best enjoyed during the spring, fall, and winter seasons.

==== The Dungsam Seeds Bank ====

The seed bank includes sixty-seven different kinds of seeds for cereals and vegetables that are native to the area. This place is like a library for seeds, especially the important ones known as Dru-na-gu.

=== Samdrup Jongkhar Tsechu ===

The Samdrup Jongkhar Dzongkhag Tshechu is held annually from the 13th to the 15th of the eleventh month of the Bhutanese calendar. This three-day event features performances by Rabdey monks and dzongkhag dancers, presenting a variety of mask dances and cultural showcases. The Tshechu reaches its climax with the unveiling of the Guru Tshengey Thongdrel.

== Industry ==
Motanga Industrial Park, situated in Samdrup Jongkhar, is a pivotal initiative by the Bhutanese government to cultivate small to medium-sized industries. Its strategic location, a mere 12 km from SJ Town and near the Indian border, positions it as an ideal manufacturing and export-focused enclave. Encompassing a substantial 156 acres, the park is a nucleus for key sectors, including mineral and chemical-based, forest and wood-based, as well as food and agro-based industries. This dynamic endeavor exemplifies Bhutan&#x27;s dedication to economic diversification, fostering growth, and strengthening cross-border trade relationships.
== Protected areas ==
Jomotsangkha Wildlife Sanctuary (formerly Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary) is the smallest protected area in Bhutan, covering 334.73 square kilometers (129.24 sq mi) in Samdrup Jongkhar District along the southern border with Assam. Its elevations range between . Despite its small size, Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary is an important habitat for elephants, gaur (Bos gaurus), and other tropical wildlife. It may also contain the rare pygmy hog (Porcula salvania) and hispid hare (Caprolagus hispidus), known to inhabit the adjacent Khaling Reserve in Assam, with which Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary forms a trans-border reserve.

<text>Samtse District (Dzongkha: བསམ་རྩེ་རྫོང་ཁག་; Wylie: &quot;Bsam-rtse rdzong-khag&quot;; older spelling &quot;Samchi&quot;) is one of the 20 dzongkhags (districts) comprising Bhutan. It comprises two subdistricts (&quot;dungkhags&quot;): Tashicholing and Dophuchen. They are further subdivided into 15 gewogs (village blocks). The Samtse district covers a total area of 1304 km2.

==History and culture==
Historically, Samtse was sparsely populated as the mountain-dwelling Bhutanese considered the low-lying district to be prone to tropical disease. During the early 20th century, the district experienced a large influx of Nepali people who were invited to the area to assist in forest-clearing. Overall, the district population has been increasing, and there have been housing shortages in Samtse as reported by Kuensel.

Samtse is also home to the Lhop (Doya) people, a little-studied ethnic group of approximately 2,500 persons. The Bhutanese believe them to be the aboriginals who predated the Tibetan migration from the north. The Lhop are noted for their animistic religious beliefs, their practice of marrying cross-cousins, and their unique burial customs.

Samtse is also well known historically for being the home of the Gurung Kazi Family who governed the region in the early 1900s till the 1960s.

==Languages==
The dominant language in Samtse District is Nepali,spoken by the heterogeneous Lhotshampa community, though speakers of Dzongkha, the national language, inhabit the district&#x27;s eastern reaches. Samtse is also home to some of the autochthonous communities of Bhutan, pre-dating the arrival of Nepali and Dzongkha speakers. Lepcha is spoken by some 2,000 people in northeastern Samtse, and Lhokpu is spoken by some 2,500 people along the border with Chukha District.

==Economy and education==
Samtse has an abundance of natural deposits of talc, dolomite and other resources which are exported on a regular basis. It also houses a number of industrial and manufacturing units. Cardamom, ginger, areca nut, and oranges are the predominant cash crops, although most farmers practice subsistence farming.
Out of the many gewogs of Bhutan, Bara gewog has the largest cardamom growing areas. In 2010 the production is very high. 2010 prices were very high compared to past years.

Samtse is the site of one of the two campuses of the National Institute of Education, now known as Samtse College of Education, a college for teachers part of the Royal University of Bhutan system. This training Institute offers B.Ed. (for secondary as well as primary), PgDE courses, and M.Ed. in Science and Counselling.

==Geography==
With an area of approximately 1500 sq. kilometers, Samtse District is a little more than twice the size of Singapore. It shares an international border with the Indian states of Sikkim to the west and West Bengal to the south, and internal borders with Haa and Chukha Districts.

==Administrative divisions==
Samtse District is divided into fifteen village blocks (or &quot;gewogs&quot;):

*Dungtoe Gewog
*Dophoogchen Gewog
*Duenchukha Gewog
*Namgaychhoeling Gewog
*Norbugang Gewog
*Norgaygang Gewog
*Pemaling Gewog
*Phuentshogpelri Gewog
*Samtse Gewog
*Sangngagchhoeling Gewog
*Tading Gewog
*Tashicholing Gewog
*Tendu Gewog
*Ugentse Gewog
*Yoeseltse Gewog
Unlike most other districts, Samtse, along with Chukha, contain no protected areas of Bhutan. Although much of southern Bhutan contained protected areas in the 1960s, park-level environmental protection became untenable.

<doc id="766326" wikidata="Q6586652" url="?curid=766326" title="Luk khrueng">
<text>Luk khrueng (, literally &quot;half-child&quot;) is a colloquial Thai term referring to a person whose parents are of different nationalities. In a narrow sense, luk khrueng means people of mixed Thai and foreign origin; a person of mixed Thai and Chinese origin is called &quot;tai chuea sai jin&quot;, rather than &quot;luk khrueng&quot;.

In the mid-20th century the number of &quot;luk khrueng&quot; increased dramatically following World War II, with the increasing number of Western residents and visitors to the country. Many were the children of American servicemen who moved to the country in the 1960s and the 1970s, when there were several large U.S. military bases in the country because of the Vietnam War. While some of the servicemen formed lasting relationships with Thai women, some &quot;luk khrueng&quot; were the product of temporary relationships with &quot;rented wives&quot; or sex workers, a fact that led to some discrimination in that era. Some Thais were also hostile because of the perceived lack of racial purity but most were quite accepting.

In the modern era, many &quot;luk khrueng&quot; are born of relationships and marriages when Westerners come to live and to work in Thailand or when Thai people go to study in Western or foreign countries.

In more recent generations, &quot;luk khrueng&quot; have become accepted and even embraced by society and many &quot;luk khrueng&quot; have carved out a prominent role in the entertainment industry in which their often-fluent English and their Caucasian features (such as fair skin, larger or colored eyes and allegedly tall physique), which are deemed attractive in Thai culture, have proved to be advantageous. Within teenage culture these features are also extremely popular.

<text>Dead Bang is a 1989 American action thriller film directed by John Frankenheimer and starring Don Johnson, Penelope Ann Miller, William Forsythe, Bob Balaban, and Tim Reid. Johnson&#x27;s character, based on real-life LASD Detective Jerry Beck, tracks the killer of a Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Deputy and uncovers a plot involving hate literature, white supremacist militias and arms trafficking.

==Plot==
On Christmas Eve in Los Angeles, a dispatched LASD Sheriff is shot dead by an armed robber, who early on robbed a convenience store and also killed its African-American owner. The alcoholic, hard-driven LASD Detective Jerry Beck is tasked with the investigation. While examining police records he comes across a person of interest named Bobby Burns, who has recently been paroled from a four-year robbery sentence. He and a parole officer go to Burns&#x27; home only to find his college student brother, John, who claims he has not seen Burns and is only staying for the holidays. A man suddenly flees the house and Beck captures him after a chase on foot; he turns out to be one of Burns&#x27; friend who is also on parole from committing armed robbery. The man tells Beck he last saw Burns driving a maroon Ford Ranch Wagon en route to Bakersfield.

In Cottonwood, Arizona, Burns and his cohort rob a Mexican bar and kill its patrons. A local police chief informs Beck of the crime and he immediately leaves for Arizona. Beck and the chief head to a ranch alleged to be Burns&#x27; hideout, where Burns and his men attack the officers by firing automatic weapons; they escape driving the Ford. Beck retrieves a cache of documents Burns dropped, which contains white supremacy propaganda, maps, and an address book. Beck leaves for Bogan, Oklahoma to track down one of the people listed in the book, Reverend Gebhardt, who is the leader of the religious white supremacist organization Aryan Nations. Beck is joined by FBI Agent Kressler and they head to Gebhardt&#x27;s church, where Gebhardt reveals the entity&#x27;s aim of cleansing America of its &quot;racial impurities&quot;, and denies ever seeing Burns. Burns, though, has been hiding near the church casing the place.

That night, Burns springs on Beck while driving his car, holding him at gunpoint. As Burns prepares to shoot him, Beck crashes his car into an oncoming police vehicle to escape. During a gunfight, Beck lights a matchbook and sets a car leaking gas on fire, causing Burns to escape with his men after an explosion. Back in Los Angeles, Beck&#x27;s superiors have become frustrated over his performance on the force due in part to his alcoholism and uncouth behavior. They recommend he undergo a psychiatric analysis; after the session, though, Beck threatens the psychiatrist into letting him pass the evaluation. A phone call later that day informs him that he is now fit for duty.

In Boulder, Colorado, he meets Police Captain Dixon, who entrusts his team of black men on the force to track Burns. Along with Kressler, he and Dixon head to a paramilitary training camp owned by the Aryan Nations and ambush Gebhardt and the other members. His search for Burns yields no results, which causes hostility between him and Kressler. Beck, though, discovers a concealed door that leads to a bunker. A gunfight ensues between him and Burns; Beck shoots and fatally wounds him. As he lay dying, Burns denies killing the Los Angeles cop. John suddenly emerges from behind them and, as he holds Beck and Kressler at gunpoint, confesses it was he who shot the cop to show his brother that he shared his contempt against the police and fidelity to white supremacy. Beck hurls John insults about his brother, and John reciprocates by open firing at him. When John runs out of bullets and springs from cover, Beck shoots him dead.

At a press conference, Dixon informs that the FBI will be revising its position on white supremacy groups, and he credits Kressler with the success of the investigation due to the evidence the agent gathered. Outside, Dixon and Beck befriend one another and go their separate ways.

==Production==
&quot;Jerome Beck&quot; is listed in the film&#x27;s closing credits as walk-on character Detective John, and also as the film&#x27;s technical police advisor. Beck was a Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department detective who sold the film rights to his life to Frankenheimer after meeting him. Don Johnson later recalled:
That was amazing, because it was a real-life character. It was an actual cop, and he wrote the script. John Frankenheimer was the director... and I was excited to work with him. Jerry was a homicide cop in L.A., and he had curly hair, so I permed my hair, which was a, uh, very interesting choice. Because I kind of looked like a… It&#x27;s kind of odd. I don&#x27;t really know how to describe it. I don&#x27;t know if you know a lot about perms, but if you do them, they relax after about two or three weeks. So my hair goes through these amazing transitions of being really tight and really wavy and sort of goofy-looking. [Laughs.]
According to director Frankenheimer, Connie Sellecca was originally chosen for the part that went to Penelope Ann Miller. Johnson refused to work with Sellecca, so she was fired and paid off.

Production was designed by Ken Adam. Director of Photography was Gerry Fisher. Music was by Gary Chang.

Principal photography began on April 14, 1988, in Alberta. Shooting locations included Calgary, Drumheller, and High River. The final three weeks of filming took place in Los Angeles.

<text>Gualberto Villarroel López (15 December 1908 – 21 July 1946) was a Bolivian military officer who served as the 39th president of Bolivia from 1943 to 1946. A reformist, sometimes compared with Argentina&#x27;s Juan Perón, he is nonetheless remembered for his alleged fascist sympathies and his violent demise.

==Early life==
Gualberto Villarroel was born on 15 December 1908 in Villa Rivero, Cochabamba Department. He was the son of Enrique Casto Villarroel and María López. At age 11, Villarroel&#x27;s parents decided that provincial education was insufficient and enrolled him fiscal school and later into the Sucre National School in Cochabamba. He graduated in 1924, going on to enroll in the Military College of the Army in 1925, graduating with the rank of second lieutenant as part of the Pérez Tercero Infantry Regiment in 1928. A distinguished cadet, he was awarded the Order of Abdon Calderón for best student by the Ecuadorian government. In 1931, he rose to the rank of lieutenant.

=== Chaco War ===
Villarroel saw action in the Chaco War (1932–35) against Paraguay. He caught the attention of Hans Kundt, commander-in-chief of the army, who highlighted the young man&#x27;s creativity in combat. As part of the 8th Ayacucho Infantry Regiment, he participated in the battles of Cañada Strongest and Ybybobó being promoted to captain in 1935. He also participated in the final defense of Villamontes in 1935.

After Bolivia&#x27;s disastrous defeat in the conflict, he became convinced that the country needed profound structural changes and supported the progressive Military Socialist regimes of David Toro and Germán Busch. Following Busch&#x27;s suicide in August 1939, conservative forces reasserted themselves, took power, and won the 1940 elections in which the traditional parties linked to the country&#x27;s big mining interests triumphed at the polls with General Enrique Peñaranda.

== 1943 coup d&#x27;état ==
While the Peñaranda administration had managed to wrest control of government from the previous progressive political forces, it was unable to stop their spread. Villarroel became a member of RADEPA (&quot;Razón de Patria&quot;, or Fatherland&#x27;s Cause), an open-military faction of young officers founded in 1934 by Bolivian prisoners of war in Paraguay. It sought mass support, backed military intervention in politics, and hoped to prevent excessive foreign control over Bolivia&#x27;s natural resources.

Between September and December 1943, RADEPA secretly conspired with the newly formed Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) to overthrow Peñaranda. The consequences of the Catavi massacre on 21 December 1942 which caused the deaths of 19 striking miners would ultimately bring down the government. Before the coup, opposition leaders requested that the president resign. Peñaranda, in turn, evaded a response and ordered the immediate change of military assignments for the RADEPA leaders, thus removing them from the center of conflict. In response, the date of the coup was brought forward.

On 20 December 1943, the RADEPA-MNR alliance overthrew the government. Former economy minister Víctor Paz Estenssoro announced in a broadcast, &quot;Bolivian people, the work of iniquity has ended. The nation has ceased to be the property of the Peñaranda Rivera Castillo family.&quot; Villarroel was allowed to take residence in the Palacio Quemado as de facto president while members of the MNR, including Paz Estenssoro, took various positions in his cabinet. At age 35, he was one of the youngest presidents in Bolivian history.

== President (1943–1946) ==

=== Fight for U.S. recognition ===
According to Bolivian journalist Augusto Céspedes, &quot;The coup surprised no one more in Bolivia than the United States Ambassador.&quot; The U.S. government had enjoyed good relations with the Peñaranda administration which had brought Bolivia into World War II as an Allied Power and pledged the country&#x27;s tin resources to the war effort. The fall of Peñaranda alarmed the State Department which immediately suspended diplomatic relations with Bolivia and refused to recognize the Villarroel government. In 1941, Peñaranda had used the fabricated story of a &quot;Nazi Putsch&quot; in Bolivia to suppress the MNR, causing the U.S. to suspect them of having pro-Nazi affiliations. Villarroel, in turn, was seen as &quot;a Mussolini of the Andes&quot; and a puppet of Buenos Aires. The government of Argentina under the fascist-leaning President Pedro Pablo Ramírez was the only government in Latin America to recognize Villarroel.

The newly installed Villarroel government within hours of its assumption to power sought to reassure the U.S. of its desire for good relations and support of the war effort. In an interview, Paz Estenssoro assured that &quot;the new Government does not alter Bolivia&#x27;s international position at the side of the United Nations.&quot; Negotiations over tin sales, vital to the Bolivian economy, rested on recognition by the United States. Hence, Villarroel&#x27;s government committed to negotiations over the exclusive sale of quinine, the nationalization of German and Japanese companies, and a new tin contract at hopefully higher prices.

Despite their efforts, the view by the U.S. that Villarroel and the MNR were, in fact, a pro-fascist regime resulted in Secretary of State Cordell Hull issuing a memorandum on 10 January describing their pro-Axis sympathies. By 28 January, all 19 American governments (except Argentina) had publicly refused recognition of the Villarroel regime. While on 11 February Villarroel removed three cabinet members including two top MNR leaders, Carlos Montenegro and Augusto Céspedes, the U.S. maintained that the composition of the revolutionary junta precluded recognition and that &quot;it is not felt that these shifts have materially altered the character of the Junta.&quot;

Under the mounting weight of U.S. pressure, the remaining MNR ministers, Víctor Paz Estenssoro, Rafael Otazo, and Wálter Guevara resigned on 5 April 1944. Gualberto Villarroel received full command from the junta as de facto provisional president. Later that month, Minister of Labor Víctor Andrade publicly denied the charges of Nazism and called on the U.S. to recognize the new government. These events led the U.S. to send Avra M. Warren, U.S. Ambassador to Panama, to La Paz to give advice on recognition. On 23 May, Warren recommended the immediate recognition of the Villarroel government due to the fact that &quot;there is now no MNR official in any position of prominence in Bolivia.&quot;

Víctor Paz Estenssoro would later claim that the main obstacle to U.S. recognition of the regime was the MNR&#x27;s call for a ban on Jewish immigration to the country. While the U.S. saw it as a sign of antisemitism, Paz Estenssoro maintained his party&#x27;s opposition was due to the &quot;serious problems relating to subsistence and housing&quot; it created. The MNR would return to Villarroel&#x27;s cabinet, with Víctor Paz Estenssoro as Finance Minister, in late December 1944.

=== 1945 Indigenous Congress ===
Faced with enemies on both the left and right, Villarroel strove to build a base of support among the long marginalized indigenous populace of Bolivia. In November 1944, Villarroel repealed the law prohibiting indigenous people from entering the main squares of La Paz. Not long after, on the initiative of peasant leaders such as Francisco Chipana Ramos, the president agreed to sponsor a fully indigenous congress to be held in early 1945. The government gave credentials to some 1200 community delegates and settlers to attend the congress. Between 10 and 15 May 1945, a combined group of 1500 delegates and their families would hold the First Indigenous Congress in Luna Park in La Paz.

The congress, led by its Aymara president Francisco Chipana and Quechua vice president Dionsio Miranda, would result in important legal reforms among the indigenous community. Namely, the congress brought forth the abolition of the &quot;pongueaje&quot;, an obligatory form of unpaid servitude by indigenous peasants in haciendas. Also abolished were &quot;personal services&quot; such as domestic service and transporting and selling a landlord&#x27;s produce which came in addition to cultivating fields. The abolition of &quot;pongueaje&quot; also saw the end of state authorities illegally including jobs such as mail delivery within the domestic servant system.

The emphasis by the press on the &quot;authentic native&quot; dress, language and rural labor, marked the indigenous peoples as a distinct group within the Bolivian nation. Though he worked closely with Villarroel&#x27;s government during the congress, Chipana presented the event as controlled by the delegates themselves while sidelining more radical demands for redistribution of the land. Despite this, the conservative landlords refused to accept even Villarroel&#x27;s moderate changes to the labor regime, but ongoing indigenous peasant mobilization would enforce the new laws.
=== National Convention of 1944–1945 ===

Villarroel called legislative elections to be held on 2 July 1944 which resulted in a clear victory for the MNR in the Constituent Assembly. In turn, the assembly proclaimed Gualberto Villarroel the constitutional President of the Republic on 5 August 1944. He formally accepted the title the following day. Villarroel enacted a number of far-reaching reforms, including official recognition of worker unions with the establishment of the Federation of Miners, the beginning of construction of the nation&#x27;s first oil refinery and the establishment of a retirement pension. Villarroel is quoted as once saying &quot;I am not an enemy of the rich but I am more a friend of the poor.&quot;

In his push for further reforms, he called a National Convention to rewrite the constitution in 1944. As part of this process, the convention proclaimed Julián Montellano, an MNR member of the Chamber of Deputies from Oruro, vice president on 3 November 1945. Montellano took office three days later. That same month, the new constitution was sanctioned by the National Convention on 23 November and promulgated by Villarroel on 24 November. The Political Constitution of 1945 maintained the same formal structure and even number of sections, denominations, and articles as the 1938 Constitution promulgated during the presidency of Germán Busch, although with the introduction of further reforms.

=== Attacks on the opposition ===
The conservative backlash against Villarroel did not take long to appear, fed by the considerable resources of the private mining interests. Moreover, the workers themselves decided to exercise their new rights to protest to demand further concessions causing the government to adopt repressive measures to maintain control.

==== Shooting of José Antonio Arze ====
Allegedly among these repressions was the attempted assassination of José Antonio Arze, a prominent Bolivian sociologist and Marxist and head of the Revolutionary Left Party (PIR). While Arze had initially presented his sympathy for the 1943 coup, he refused to supply the Villarroel regime with civil support from the PIR unless the new government got rid of &quot;fascist&quot; elements. The result of this was his arrest and confinement for a few months after which he was released. 

In La Paz in the early morning of 9 July 1944, an unknown assailant shot Arze twice outside his house. While one bullet missed his head by millimeters, the other lodged itself in his thorax, leaving him incapacitated and in hospital for several months. The attempt on the life of the influential leftist politician was a cause of grave concern among academics which, given the previous animosity between the two, suspected government involvement in the incident. In an attempt to push against this notion, a government delegation including Villarroel himself, accompanied by Foreign Minister Enrique Baldivieso, visited Arze at his hospital, showing concern for his health. A subsequent liability trial against the Villarroel regime failed to reach a concrete conclusion as to whether Villarroel or RADEPA had instigated the assassination attempt.

==== Kidnapping of Moritz Hochschild ====
In the same month as the shooting of José Antonio Arze, was the kidnapping of the prominent tin baron Moritz Hochschild. The mining businessman had been arrested in La Paz after being linked to a series of actions threatening the stability of the government months prior. However, on 30 July 1944, he had been cleared of all charges and released. The same day, he was intercepted by RADEPA agents while attempting to leave the country through the Chilean consulate. Hochschild&#x27;s whereabouts were unknown for 17 days. The initial decision to eliminate him was reversed due to international pressure and the intervention of diplomatic representatives of Argentina, Chile, and the United States which ultimately secured Hochschild&#x27;s release on 15 August.

==== Executions of Chuspipata and Challacollo ====
The harsh repressions on the opposition inevitably resulted in the development of a conspiracy to overthrow the government. The attempted coup in Oruro, headed by Colonel David Ovidio, resulted in failure and its perpetrators were arrested. Following this, the decision was made to impose the maximum penalty of death, without trial and without discretion on the conspirators. On the night of 19 November, four of the conspirators, Miguel Brito, Eduardo Paccieri, Fernando Garrón, and Humberto Loaiza were shot near Challacollo. The rest, two senators: Luis Calvo and Félix Capriles; two former ministers of state: Carlos Salinas Aramayo and Rubén Terrazas; and a military man: General Demetrio Ramos were executed near Chuspipata. The latter executions were particularly brutal as the condemned were shot and their bodies thrown into a ravine. The government announced the executions through a note signed by Major Jorge Eguino on 21 November 1944.

Once the facts were discovered, Villarroel maintained that he had not ordered the executions. However, as head of government, he took responsibility for what happened. Some versions indicate that several crimes carried out during the Villarroel government were carried out by RADEPA, without the knowledge of the president. Whatever the case, the executions shocked the population. In 1977, writer Roberto Querejazu would claim that &quot;if the Catavi massacre was the flag raised by the MNR and the RADEPA in their revolt against Peñaranda, the &#x27;crimes of Challacollo and Chuspipata&#x27; became those of the PIR and the traditional parties to drag public opinion against Villarroel.&quot;

== Overthrow and death ==
The atrocities of Chuspipata and Challacollo contributed to a gradual process of deterioration in the popularity of the government of Gualberto Villarroel, a process accelerated by the violent repression that the regime promoted against members of the opposition and citizens critical of its actions. Dissatisfaction came to a head in July 1946 as a tripartite group of workers, students, and teachers threatened to strike. Their main demand was the adjustment of teachers&#x27; wages which at the time sat at a meager $12.50 to $20 a month. Also among their demands was the removal of the MNR from government, and the resignation of the MNR and its head Víctor Paz Estenssoro, who was held responsible for the executions of Chuspipata and Challacollo, from Villarroel&#x27;s cabinet. The government refused, stating that an increase in wages would cause inflation, this despite the fact that an estimated 56% of the national budget was being spent on the army alone.

On 8 July, teachers and professors of the Higher University of San Andrés (UMSA), joined two days later by university students, went on strike demanding increased wages. The police dispersed the demonstration concentrated in the Plaza Murillo with rifle and machine gun fire, leaving 3 dead and 11 wounded. On 17 July, the windows of the UMSA were found destroyed, having been stoned the night before by drunk MNR members including the minister of agriculture, Julio Zuazo Cuenca. The gesture galvanized university students who organized in La Paz, rallying the city&#x27;s population to their side. During one of these rallies, Bergel Camberos, a student from the Pedro Domingo Murillo Industrial School, was shot by police, heightening the crowd&#x27;s animosity against the government. In a bid to disperse the growing crowds, President Villarroel brought the Loa 4th Infantry Regiment and the Bolívar 2nd Artillery Regiment into the city. The situation quickly devolved with the army clashing with the student protesters, causing 10 casualties. On 19 July, an infantry column descended on La Paz with orders to occupy some parts of the city.

In an attempt to deescalate the situation, Villarroel met with Héctor Ormachea, the rector of the UMSA, and ordered that the students arrested in the clashes be released. That same day, Villarroel requested the resignation of Minister of Agriculture Zuazo and met with Minister of Finance Paz Estenssoro to request the removal of the MNR party from government, facilitating their asylum in foreign embassies. On 20 July, a new all-military cabinet was announced and the commitment of Defense Minister Ángel Rodríguez not to fire on the people was heard on the radio. At 7 p.m., MNR ministers presented their resignation at the government palace.At 11 p.m., military commanders led by Minister General Rodríguez entered the Palace of Government (the so-called Palacio Quemado) and requested the resignation of President Gualberto Villarroel to avoid a massacre. While some officers loyal to Villarroel implored against such a decision, it was concluded that it would be difficult to maintain the president&#x27;s situation without the full support of the army, taking into account that many of the troops who were quartered had relatives who had died in previous clashes. Rodríguez would later say that &quot;The president did not expect this coup. His bewilderment was distressing.&quot; Finally, President Villarroel agreed to resign with Vice President Montellano as his successor. However, all those present rejected this because Montellano belonged to the MNR, and the people at that time did not want any hint of that party in government. At 1:30 p.m. on 21 July, Villarroel drew up his resignation and presented it to General Damaso Arenas, commander-in-chief of the army. By that point, however, an easy end to the protests and riots through the president&#x27;s resignation was no longer possible. Unaware of the president&#x27;s resignation, anti-government crowds took control of the Plaza Murillo, the site of the Palacio Quemado, laying siege to it. The enraged crowds of teachers, students, and marketplace women seized arms from the arsenal. The revolt spread throughout the city. The jail was attacked and political prisoners released, while Max Toledo, Director General of Transit and member of RADEPA, was surprised and killed in the vicinity of Plaza San Pedro. His body was one of many to be hung in the square, inspired by the hanging and desecration of the corpse of Benito Mussolini the year prior. As suspected, military units eventually stopped defending the regime. Rather, soldiers of the Loa 4th Infantry Regiment joined the insurrection.

The rioters eventually stormed the Palacio Quemado itself in search of Villarroel. He was discovered in a cupboard in the Office of Administrative Reorganization and Efficiency. There are several accounts of what happened next: One claims that one of the revolutionaries fired his submachine gun through the closed cupboard door upon hearing a noise and discovered the mortally wounded body of Villarroel when he opened it. Another alleges that Villarroel opened the cupboard himself and fired his revolver at his attackers before falling riddled with gunshots. A third version says that when discovered he exclaimed: &quot;I am not Villarroel, I am Alfredo Mendizábal, head of the PIR (one of the leaders of the revolution).&quot;

Whatever the case, Villarroel died within the Palacio Quemado and his body was thrown through a window onto Ayacucho Street in the Plaza Murillo. Villarroel was then lynched in the street, his clothes torn and his mutilated, almost naked corpse hung on a lamp post. The same fates were found within the vicinity of the surrounding streets by Captain Waldo Ballivián, the president&#x27;s secretary Luis Uría de la Oliva, and the journalist Roberto Hinojosa. Following the bloody events of 21 July, Tomás Monje, the President of the Superior District Court of the judicial district of La Paz, was appointed by the opposition to temporarily take command as part of an interim junta. As Monje was ill, Néstor Guillén, Dean of the District Court, took provisional command.

<text>Manuel Mariano Melgarejo Valencia (13 April 1820 – 23 November 1871) was a Bolivian military officer and politician who served as the fifteenth president of Bolivia from December 28, 1864, until his fall on January 15, 1871.

He assumed power in 1864 after staging a coup d&#x27;état against president José María de Achá, thus beginning six-year dictatorship, popularly known as the &quot;Sexenio&quot;. He would cement his power after personally killing former president Manuel Isidoro Belzu in 1865. He was of controversial personality and his dictatorship is remembered in Bolivia mainly for its poor government administration and its abuses against the indigenous population, in addition to having signed unfavorable border treaties with Chile and Brazil in 1866 and 1867, which proved to be devastating in coming years.

On January 15, 1871, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army at the time, General Agustín Morales, along with the support of the people of La Paz, tired of the president&#x27;s despotic actions for almost seven years, rose up against Melgarejo and deposed him. With the people having risen against Melgarejo, a bloody battle ensued in the city of La Paz which has been considered one of the fiercest and most terrible battles in Bolivian history. At the end of that day, the uprising triumphed over government troops, thus managing ending the Melgarejo regime.

Once ousted from power, Melgarejo fled Bolivia for Chile, where he stayed for a few months. While in Santiago de Chile, he learned that Juana Sánchez, his lover, was living in the city of Lima, Peru. Consequently, Melgarejo decided to leave for that country, but, once he arrived in Lima, he was shot to death on November 23, 1871, by Juana&#x27;s brother, José Aurelio Sánchez.

==Early life==
He was born on April 13, 1820, in the town of Tarata, current department of Cochabamba, Bolivia; then belonging to the territory of the Viceroyalty of Peru. He was the son of mestiza Ignacia Melgarejo and the Spaniard José Linares. When he was born, his father did not recognize him as his legitimate son and abandoned him. For this reason, Melgarejo had to take the surname of his mother, who raised him during his childhood. Melgarejo grew up with his mother and spent his childhood in a humble home in the small town of Tarata; his house still remains today.

== Personal life ==
Melgarejo was married to Rosa Rojas, the member of a middle-class family. Together, they two sons: Federico (1840-1872) and Severo (1842-1905). His younger son was married to Rosaura Sánchez, the sister of Juana and Aurelio Sánchez. Melgarejo was constantly disloyal to his wife, who is often excluded from history and rarely mentioned.

==Military career==

Melgarejo began his military career in the city of Cochabamba at a very young age. He entered the army at the age of 16, joining in 1836 with the rank of private. Melgarejo was present in many different battles during the War of the Confederation, during which the government of Andrés de Santa Cruz. At the end of the war in 1839, he was promoted to the rank of sergeant.

In 1841, at the age of 21, Melgarejo participated in the battle of Ingavi, a clash between Bolivia and Peru while he was a sergeant under the command of José Ballivián Segurola. During the battle, Melgarejo managed to demonstrate his heroism and bravery on the battlefield, for which the Bolivian government promoted him to the rank of second lieutenant.

After Ingavi, Ballivián kept the young soldier Melgarejo by his side, with the aim of protecting his government against future military uprisings by the opposition. It is worth mentioning that President Ballivián saw defects in the young soldier, which is why he kept him assigned to the borders, due to Melgarejo&#x27;s conduct and dangerous behavior caused by his fondness and abuse of alcohol.

During his military career, Melgarejo managed to rise in the military hierarchy through the adulation of his superiors, his willingness to participate in rebellions and in some isolated acts of courage. Unlike other soldiers of his time, Melgarejo was characterized for being poorly educated, but always willful.

=== Promotions ===
* In 1836, he entered the Bolivian army with the rank of soldier (at the age of 16). 
* In 1839, he was promoted to the rank of sergeant (aged 19).
* In 1841, he was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant by José Ballivián himself after his heroic displays during the Battle of Ingavi (21 years old).
* In 1846, he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant (26 years old).
* In 1850, he rose to the rank of captain (at the age of 30).
* In 1855, he was promoted to the rank of major (at the age of 35).
* In 1857, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel (at the age of 37).
* In 1859, the president of Bolivia, José María Linares, personally promoted Melgarejo to the rank of colonel, in gratitude for having helped him overthrow former president Jorge Córdova (at the age of 39).
* In 1862, the president of Bolivia, José María de Achá, personally promoted Melgarejo to the rank of army general (at the age of 42), in gratitude for having helped him overthrow former president José María Linares. This is the maximum degree that can be reached within the Bolivian army. In just 26 years, Mariano Melgarejo went from being a simple soldier (in 1836) to being the general of the entire Bolivian Army (in 1862).

== Political career ==

=== Death sentence and presidential pardon ===

In 1854, Melgarejo appears for the first time on the public and political scene of Bolivia. At the beginning of that year, he mutinied with his troops after carrying out a military uprising in the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, pronouncing himself against the government of President Manuel Isidoro Belzu, but his revolt was quickly crushed by government troops, being captured and immediately taken to the city of Cochabamba to stand trial. During his trial, Melgarejo was tried and charged with high treason and armed uprising against the Bolivian state and was sentenced to death.

When Melgarejo was awaiting his execution by firing squad (as befitted the military officers of that time), some ladies from the high society of Cochabamba (very close friends of his) met in person with President Belzu at the Palacio Quemado to plead for the life of the prisoner. They justified his actions of revolt and military uprising to his alcoholism.

President Manuel Isidoro Belzu, agreeing to the request, spared the life of Melgarejo, but later, in a prophetic way, told the women of Cochabamba that &quot;one day they would regret&quot; asking for mercy for the life of a womanizing and drunk military officer. After the presidential pardon, Melgarejo was released and continued his military career in the Bolivian Army.

Paradoxically, among the various ladies who asked for Melgarejo&#x27;s life was the mother of the prestigious Bolivian poet and politician Néstor Galindo, who eleven years later in 1865, would be cruelly shot fighting in the Battle of the Cantería de Potosí against the Melgarejo government.

=== Political conspiracies ===

After his military revolt in 1854, Melgarejo acquired a certain notoriety and a moderate leadership among the army troops. The governments of presidents Jorge Córdova (1855-1857) and José María Linares (1857-1861), considered him dangerous and kept him stationed at distant locations in the borderlands, far from the main cities. Doing so, Córdova and Linares reigmes hoped to isolate Melgarejo and prevent him from influencing soldiers and officers with his alcoholism and immorality and, at the same time, also avoid future military uprisings.

During the government of President Córdova (1855-1857), Melgarejo already held the rank of lieutenant colonel. During that time he openly supported the conspiracies of politician José María Linares had and aided the civilian cause to overthrow Córdova. In September 1857, together with Colonel Plácido Yáñez, he rose up in favor of Linares during the coup d&#x27;état that ousted Córdova. Organizing and commanding the barricades in the city of Cochabamba, Melgarejo played a crucial role in the defeat of President Jorge Córdova who was overthrown after the Battle of Cochabamba. Linares rose to the presidency of Bolivia and, thankful for Melgarejo&#x27;s support, promoted Melgarejo to the rank of colonel in 1859.

During the first months of the Linares regime, Melgarejo supported him openly. However, years later he rose up against himin rebellion and was crucial yet again in the overthrow of a president. Once Linares was overthrown in 1861, the former Minister of War, José María de Achá, rose to the presidency. During the coup, Melgarejo changed sides and, with Achá&#x27;s victory, openly supported the new regime.

=== Rise to power ===
He crushed countless uprisings and rebellions on behalf of President Achá, who in return gave him his friendship and total trust, promoting Melgarejo to the rank of army general in 1862. At the beginning of the year 1864, a rumor spread in Bolivian society about the infidelity of President Achá&#x27;s wife with General Melgarejo.

Upon discovering they were indeed lovers, the morale and health of President Achá seriously declined, as well losing respect from the army, being discredited by the opposition as a cuckold. His wife would die suddenly weeks later, also afflicted by a serious illness in August 1864.

==Presidency (1864-1871)==

In December 1864, taking advantage of the delicate health of President Achá, Melgarejo revolted against him, and, together with his troops, carried out a coup against the government. By this point, the unpopular government was ruling over a chaotic and anarchic land, making Melgarejo&#x27;s task far simpler. Melgarejo rose to the Presidency of Bolivia on December 28, 1864, at the age of forty-four.

=== The Constitutionalist Uprising of 1865-1865 ===

==== The early rebellion ====
Even after Belzu had been eliminated, Melgarejo still faced widespread discontent from several sector of society and would face nearly a year of rebellions by a collective group called &quot;Constitutionalists&quot;. Having seized power only in December 1864, less than a month later Melgarejo clashed with rebel forces in Tacaquira, located in the southern area of the Chuquisaca Department, on January 24, 1865. The rebels would win this encounter, facing government troops again in a bigger battle on the banks of the Oscara River on February 3 and ultimately retreating.

==== The assassination of Manuel Isidoro Belzu ====
To Melgarejo&#x27;s dismay, former President Manuel Isidoro Belzu, who was exiled in Europe, returned to Bolivia to dispute the rise of General Melgarejo, finally sparking a full civil war. On March 22, 1865, Belzu&#x27;s army defeated the government forces in La Paz with the help of the popular masses. On March 27, Melgarejo attacked La Paz with his army but was defeated, with several of his men choosing to side with Belzu.

However, as soon as Belzu entered the Palacio Quemado for the meeting, Melgarejo and his men murdered him. New investigations have come up with the theory that since Melgarejo&#x27;s revolver failed (the seller found out that only 1 bullet came out of 5 shots), then the bullet that killed Belzu came from the revolver of some soldier who was behind him. Regardless of what happened that fateful day, Belzu was killed and Melgarejo had eliminated a huge threat to his government.

According to legend, when Melgarejo&#x27;s presence was known, a crowd gathered in the Plaza Murillo, located in front of the Bolivian Government Palace, cheering Belzu&#x27;s name. However, Melgarejo appeared on a balcony instead and announced, &quot;Belzu is dead. Who lives now?&quot; and the crowd gave a bestial cry: &quot;Long live Melgarejo!&quot;

==== The May uprising ====
Only two months after Belzu had been defeated and killed, on May 25 another Constitutionalist revolt broke out in La Paz. A week later, on June 1, a committee was established in Oruro and proclaimed a revolution. The rebels managed to capture the government palace and, two days later, the garrison of Chayanta also rose up against Melgarejo. On June 8, the Constitutionalists sent an army toward Oruro in the south, being defeated on July 1 by Melgarejo&#x27;s troops. With Oruro now occupied by the government forces, Melgarejo still was unable to end the anarchy, facing rebellion in many more areas of the country. La Paz, Oruro, and Chayanta joined to create a board to lead the revolution and foment the spread of it to other cities and towns. Very quickly, Potosí, Sucre, Cobija, Tarija, and Cochabamba would join. Although all seemed lost for Melgarejo, by August 8, he was able to recapture Sucre, Cochabamba, and Potosí. Generals Ildefonso Sanjinés and Nicanor Flores had been competing for leadership, resulting in the forestalling of rebel operations and allowing Melgarejo to exploit this weakness. On Septiember 5, Flores decided to lead an attack against the government forces, however, was defeated and was forced to flee to Argentina. On October 25 Santa Cruz declared itself in support of the revolution. However, on November 22 the government had retaken the city after a brief skirmish. The northern rebels, under the command of General Casto Arguedas, decided to launch an offensive which was ultimately defeated and hastily retreated to Viacha. On January 24, 1866, Melgarejo and his trusted second in command, Quintín Quevedo, met the remainder of the rebels in the hill of Letanias, scoring a major victory and achieving the unconditional surrender of the Constitutionalist rebels.

=== Administration ===

After proclaiming himself president of Bolivia, Melgarejo proceeded to govern without rivals but with great incompetence. One of his first measures was to violently suppress the opposition and annul the traditional rights of the indigenous population, declaring that the communal lands of the native communities would be property of the State. He then ordered the violent eviction of the communities to grant the lands to allied landowners, an aggression that had not even been carried out during Spanish rule. He also abolished municipalities and local governments, refusing to appoint mayors.

Melgarejo entrusted the public administration to his chancellor, a young lawyer named Mariano Donato Muñoz, especially in foreign policy. Shortly after assuming power, he was visited by a young woman who belonged to a wealthy family from La Paz named Juana Sánchez. She had come to Melgarejo to ask for clemency for the life of her brother Aurelio Sánchez, who had been sentenced to death. Melgarejo not only spare his life, but also took Juana Sánchez as his concubine after holding her hostage in the Palacio Quemado for three consecutive days. Madly in love with the young woman (who succumbed to the personality of the general), Melgarejo gave her and her family great influence in the government, which the Sánchez family took advantage of, enriching themselves at the expense of the treasury.

Melgarejo&#x27;s government turned out to be increasingly erratic and unstable. While the dictator spent much of his time in orgies with Juana Sánchez, who was as lustful as the general himself and also addicted to alcohol, her family dominated politics and the governing of the nation. In 1866, Melgarejo signed a border treaty with Chile, establishing the common border but recognizing all Chilean commercial interests in the exploitation of saltpeter on the Bolivian coast of Antofagasta. This practically left Bolivia without any compensation other than the right to collect taxes in their own territory. Later, in 1867, he negotiated with the Empire of Brazil the sale of 102,400 km2 of Bolivian territory (from the Acre region) through the Treaty of Ayacucho. This in exchange for the payment of two million pounds sterling and the Brazilian commitment to build the Madeira railway in the Mamoré region. In 1868, Melgarejo promulgated a new constitution, granting himself omnimodal powers over public administration and attributing to his position the power to &quot;persecute and kill opponents&quot;. The promulgation ceremony ended with a banquet and consequent orgy where he made Juana Sánchez participate totally naked.

==== War of the Triple Alliance (1864-1870) ====

In 1864, Paraguay had been invaded by Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay in what is known as the War of the Triple Alliance. Melgarejo expressed solidarity with Paraguay, giving his full support to this nation. But his supposed support remained only in words, since Melgarejo in fact maintained a neutral stance and never mobilized troops to help Paraguay.

==== Franco-Prussian War (1870) ====
In July 1870, when Prussia invaded France, starting the Franco-Prussian War, Melgarejo asked one of his high-ranking generals to immediately send Bolivian troops to help the French army defend Paris. This was city that Melgarejo was fascinated by with its stories of sophistication and elegance but which he did not even know how to locate on a map. The Bolivian general replied that the plan was impossible, since it would take a long time to cross the Atlantic Ocean. Enraged, Melgarejo replied, &quot;Don&#x27;t be silly! We&#x27;ll take a shortcut!&quot;

Blinded by anger, Melgarejo arranged to gather a troop of 3,000 men to embark for Europe and help France. Attending a horse race in Oruro, he suffered a broken foot that stopped him for a month, and planned to cross the Amazon jungles of Brazil to reach the Atlantic Ocean and reach Europe. Resuming his march, Melgarejo received news that France had already capitulated to Prussia but he refused to believe such events. In mid-November, he was informed that Great Britain was expelling Bolivian residents from British soil and refusing to recognize the existence of Bolivia in retaliation for the British ambassador to Bolivia having been expelled by Melgarejo from the country, giving him a beating shortly before doing so. While this occurred, the city of Potosí revolted against the government.

=== Downfall ===
Alarmed, Melgarejo attacked Potosí and crushed the revolt through a series of massacres and cruelties, but soon he learned that, taking advantage of his absence, La Paz, Cochabamba, and other major cities had also joined in a general uprising. Melgarejo gathered his troops and marched on La Paz, but soon his men began to desert en masse. Finally, on January 15, 1871, his battered army, under the command of José María Calderón, was completely defeated by the Commander of the Army, General Agustín Morales.

Author Moisés Alcázar describes the jubilant sentiment of the Bolivian people after Melgarejo&#x27;s overthrow: Melgarejo&#x27;s star had definitively died out. Bolivia jubilantly celebrated its liberation, taking in happily the awakening from a terrible nightmare, determined to return to normality, and to reverse the values invested in the dark and mournful times [of Melgarejo&#x27;s regime] because the world has to regain its balance. In the history of humanity, power is nothing more than frequent alternative. Life is stronger than despotism and errors, and sometimes, gently or painfully, order and progress are restored, without which the existence of peoples would be impossible. Because good is imperative for superior souls, dignifying the human species. The malignant ends by being irretrievably defeated and devastated, although the brutality is supported by force, which is also transitory and variable. And there will be jubilant mornings like that of January 15, 1871, as there will be Melgarejos and crime and barbarism blocks, although only for a short time, the sun of Liberty. Melgarejo was abandoned to his fate and, lacking troops and allies, had to flee to Chile. Almost in misery, Melgarejo learned in Chile that Juana Sánchez and her family had fled to Lima with part of their wealth. The ousted dictator managed to borrow money and went to Lima in search of his former partner. However, Juana Sánchez refused to receive the bankrupt Melgarejo at her residence, who spent days in front of the building crying out to be admitted by his former concubine. Finally, Melgarejo was shot dead on November 23 of the same year in front of Juana&#x27;s house, at the hands of the man he had pardoned, Juana&#x27;s brother, Aurelio Sánchez.

As president, Melgarejo quickly notorious for his erratic behavior. He ruthlessly suppressed the opposition, violently crushing protests and dispossessing the country&#x27;s indigenous population of their land. Melgarejo worked on behalf of a new mining elite in Bolivia, during a period of resurgent silver production and investment from Chile, Peru, North America, England and European capitalists. Despite the rising prices of guano and nitrates on the international market, the government of Bolivia faced recurring financial problems throughout Melgarejo&#x27;s tenure.

Melgarejo&#x27;s almost reckless courage and brutal stubbornness are the materials on which legends feed. In the popular anecdotes still in circulation today, 150 years after his death, his deeds, or rather misdeeds, are widely discussed.

Melgarejo was said to have given an immense amount of land to Brazil in exchange for what he described as a &quot;magnificent white horse&quot;. The stories say that a Brazilian minister appeared before Melgarejo with a white horse and other gifts. To show his appreciation, Melgarejo took a map of Bolivia, marked it with the horse&#x27;s hoof, and gave that land, hotly contested by indigenous Bolivians, as a gift to the Brazilian government. This and other incidents, such as the possession and sale of land in the altiplano (high plateau) to the highest bidder which deprived virtually all indigenous people of their land within a few decades, are among the most famous.

His literacy and intelligence is also constantly questioned and analyzed. It is said that Melgarejo, who did not know how to read, took a newspaper, but in reverse. When the guard informed him about his mistake, Melgarejo replied: &quot;Damn! He who knows how to read, just reads.&quot;

The loyalty that his subordinates had for him was mixed with fear: on one occasion, while at a social gathering on the second floor of the Palacio Quemado, he called his presidential guard and ordered them to march straight ahead. When the soldiers reached the balcony of the palace, they had to continue marching until they fell to the ground in the Plaza Murillo. It is said that there were some fractures, but no deaths. If they had disobeyed Melgarejo&#x27;s direct order, another fate would have awaited them.

However, there is more to Melgarejo than simply a mad despot who ruled with terror. Tomas O&#x27;Connor D&#x27;Arlach describes Melgarejo as follows:Many have compared him with the tyrants of Paraguay and the Argentine Republic, even with those of ancient Rome. We who judge him calmly - &quot;sine amore nec odio&quot; - and with the severe impartiality of history, do not see in Melgarejo a scheming and gloomy tyrant like Tiberius, nor the forlorn, suspecting and neurotic Dr. Francia, nor the madly bloodthirsty Rosas. All we see in him is... an ingenuously good man in whom passion, sensual instincts and organic compulsion had driven out the seeds of virtue that a careful education might have salvaged. As a man, as a president, he exercised absolutely no influence on the political life of Bolivia because he represented no idea or party... He was a true soldier, ignorant of civil law and appreciative only of physical force.But this noble man for some, and despotic tyrant for others, had great signs of compassion and coldness: in the morning he could execute a simple soldier and in the afternoon he could spare the life of a traitor. He was a man with a single indisputable virtue, his courage; Passionate about the arts and the beautiful facts of life, a devout Catholic, he could both laugh out loud when he saw the fire of a town, and cry when a child cries. The closest people knew how unstable Melgarejo&#x27;s personality was.

Currently, in the Church of Tarata, there is a skull embedded in one of its walls that is attributed to be that of Melgarejo. A popular belief is that this skull can grant wishes to whoever asks for them.

<doc id="766362" wikidata="Q1415817" url="?curid=766362" title="Sensible Soccer">
<text>Sensible Soccer, often called Sensi, is an association football video game series which was popular in the early 1990s and which still retains a following. It was developed by Sensible Software and first released for Amiga and Atari ST computers in 1992 as well as for the IBM PC compatibles. The series was created by Jon Hare and Chris Yates, as a successor to their previous football game &quot;MicroProse Soccer&quot; (1988), which in turn was inspired by the arcade video game &quot;Tehkan World Cup&quot; (1985).

It uses a zoomed-out bird&#x27;s-eye view (the majority of games until then such as &quot;Kick Off&quot; and &quot;Match Day&quot; used a closer top-down or side view), editable national, club and custom teams and gameplay utilising a simple and user-friendly control scheme. One of the defining gameplay elements was the &quot;aftertouch&quot; feature, which enabled effective but unrealistic swerves. The game topped charts such as &quot;Amiga Power&quot;&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 100&quot;. The graphic style of the game was used in other Sensible Software games, such as &quot;Mega-Lo-Mania&quot;, &quot;Cannon Fodder&quot; and &quot;Sensible Golf&quot;. For its innovation and influence on the franchises that would dominate football games, such as FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer, the original title has been cited as one of the greatest video games by various publications.

A &quot;spiritual successor&quot; to &quot;Sensible Soccer&quot;, &quot;Sociable Soccer&quot;, was announced by Jon Hare in November 2015, and early versions for Microsoft Windows, mobile, and virtual reality were shown at nine different public venues across Europe, including Gamescom in Cologne and the London Science Museum in 2016, with development continuing despite an initially unsuccessful crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. &quot;Sociable Soccer&quot; was released on Steam Early Access on 12 October 2017, with PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android versions to follow in 2024.

== History ==
The basis for &quot;Sensible Soccer&quot; was &quot;MicroProse Soccer&quot;, released for home computers in 1988. It was designed by Jon Hare and programmed by Chris Yates, who adapted the gameplay format of arcade video game &quot;Tehkan World Cup&quot; (1985) while adding their own elements to create &quot;MicroProse Soccer&quot;. Hare and Yates went on to use &quot;MicroProse Soccer&quot; as the basis for &quot;Sensible Soccer&quot; in 1992, making further improvements to the gameplay.

&quot;Sensible World of Soccer&quot;, commonly referred to as &quot;SWOS&quot;, was released in 1994. The game was almost published by Virgin Games, but they insisted on it being called Virgin Soccer. It became a first in video games when it attempted to encompass the entire professional footballing world into one game. Featuring many divisions in many countries around the globe, it featured a twenty season career mode which allowed players to manage and play as thousands of different clubs from across the globe, many of which were very obscure.

===Next generation===
The series would make a return in the summer of 2006, with a full 3D title released for Windows, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Codemasters, the holders of the licence, released the game across all PAL territories, with the design capabilities overseen by Jon Hare, the original designer of the game. &quot;Sensible Soccer 2006&quot; was released on 9 June 2006.

===Xbox Live Arcade===
In 2006, Codemasters announced a new version of &quot;Sensible World of Soccer&quot;, developed by Kuju Sheffield, for the Xbox 360 to be released in summer 2007 on Xbox Live Arcade. It features both the classic &quot;retro&quot; visuals of the original SWOS, as well as new improved high definition graphics, and retains the exact gameplay of the &quot;96/97&quot; version of &quot;Sensible World of Soccer&quot; for the Amiga, along with the music from &quot;Sensible Soccer 2006&quot;. Due to problems with the game&#x27;s network performance, the release was delayed in order for &quot;significant proportions&quot; of the network code to be rewritten. After missing several previous release dates, the game appeared on Xbox Live Arcade on 19 December 2007 but was quickly pulled. A statement from Microsoft confirmed that an incorrect version of the game had been made available, in which online play was not possible. The fixed version of the game was released two days later on 21 December. The Windows version was never released.

== Development ==
Reflecting Sensible Software&#x27;s devil-may-care approach to game design, the developers decided to make &quot;Sensible Soccer&quot; after playing around with sprites from &quot;Mega-Lo-Mania&quot; and deciding to use them in a football game.

==Games in the series==
All versions developed by Sensible Software except as stated.
==Coverdisk games==
* At Christmas 1993, a free Sensible Software minigame was included on an &quot;Amiga Format&quot; cover disk. Called &quot;Cannon Soccer&quot;, it was essentially two bonus levels of &quot;Cannon Fodder&quot; (one of Sensible Software&#x27;s other titles) in which the soldiers fought hordes of &quot;Sensible Soccer&quot; players in a snowy landscape.
* On the &quot;Amiga Power&quot; Coverdisk 21 one of the demos was &quot;Sensible Soccer: England vs Germany&quot;, also known as &quot;Sensible Soccer Meets Bulldog Blighty&quot;. This featured a mode of play that involved replacing players with soldiers from &quot;Cannon Fodder&quot;, and the ball with a hand grenade. The grenade would randomly begin to flash eventually exploding, killing any nearby players.
* &quot;Sensible World of Moon Soccer&quot; a free covermount disk included with an issue of Amiga Action magazine in the UK. Play as Moon United, featured low gravity, a cratered pitch and hordes of alien players to trade.
* The developers released a humorous spin-off called &quot;unSensible Soccer&quot; which consisted of apples vs. oranges instead of men. It was released as a free covermount disk with Amiga Action in March 1993.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in June 1994 wrote that &quot;in the debate over the best football action/tactical game, there is no doubt that Sensible is in everyone&#x27;s top three, no matter what format ... The game is fast and responsive ... a class act&quot;. The magazine added that the &quot;Gameboy version is one of the best games&quot; on the handheld.

The original Amiga version sold 175,000 copies by the end of 1993. &quot;Sensible Soccer&quot;″s first release sold roughly 200,000 copies, according to company founder Jon Hare. He estimated that the series overall had sold 2 million copies by 2002.

===Awards===
From the time of its release, &quot;Mega&quot; placed the game at #1 in their Top 50 Mega Drive Games of All Time. The Mega CD version of the game was #2 in their Top 10 Mega CD Games of All Time in the same issue.
&quot;Sensible World of Soccer 1995/96&quot; received review scores of 96% from both &quot;Amiga Power&quot; and &quot;Amiga Format&quot;, the joint highest mark given for any game by either magazine. In 2017, Gamesradar ranked the game 50th on their &quot;Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time&quot; In 1996, Gamesmaster rated the Mega Drive version 7th in their &quot;The Gamesmaster Mega Drive Top 10&quot;. In 1995, &quot;Total!&quot; listed &quot;Sensible Soccer 7&quot; on their &quot;Top 100 SNES Games&quot;. They praised the gameplay writing: &quot;&quot;Sensible Soccer&quot; has the speed and fluidity to perfectly replicate all the speed, excitement and strategic complexity of the real game&quot;.

In March 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;Sensible World of Soccer&quot; (1994) was named to a list of the ten most important video games of all time by Stanford Professor Henry Lowood and the four members of his committee – the game designers Warren Spector and Steve Meretzky; Matteo Bittanti, an academic researcher; and Christopher Grant, a game journalist. This list was also announced at the 2007 Game Developers Conference.

&quot;Sensible World of Soccer&quot; (1994) received recognition as one of the Ten Most Important Video Games of All Time, the so-called game canon, by the History of Science and Technology Collections at Stanford University.

==Legacy==
* &quot;Sensible Soccers&quot;, a Portuguese chillwave band named themselves after the game.

<text>The Tivoli, colloquially known as the old Tivoli, was a football stadium in Aachen, Germany. Opened in 1928, it was used by the city&#x27;s largest football team, Alemannia Aachen, until the opening of the new Tivoli in 2009.

== Overview ==
In 1908, the city of Aachen leased the area of the old manor Tivoli to the club, named after the inn &quot;Gut Tivoli&quot; which was located there since the 19th century, in turn taking its name from the town of Tivoli in central Italy. The club later built a football ground there. In 1925 more land was added to the lease, and the construction of the stadium was started. Inaugurated on 3 June 1928 it had a capacity of 11,000.

After World War II Alemannia Aachen played in the &quot;Oberliga West&quot;, and the stadium became too small. In September 1953 a standing tribune was built (the &quot;Würselener Wall.&quot;) It wasn&#x27;t until 1957 that seats were added to the tribune and Floodlights for nighttime events. The new stadium was inaugurated on 28 August 1957 with a game against RCD Espanyol. Additional seating areas were also later constructed.

On 17 May 2008, Alemannia Aachen began building a new stadium also named Tivoli nearby, which replaced the old stadium on 17 August 2009. The demolition of the old Tivoli, which should have begun in June 2011, was postponed, but started with a press conference on 26 September 2011. The 10,300-square metre large plot of land was later sold by the city to build single-family houses, a supermarket and office spaces.

<doc id="766367" wikidata="Q223741" url="?curid=766367" title="Brian Molko">
<text>Brian Molko (born 10 December 1972) is a Scottish-American musician who is the lead vocalist, guitarist, and lyricist of the band Placebo. He is known for his nasal high registered vocals, feminine/androgynous appearance and aggressive guitar style and tunings.

==Early life==
Molko was born in Brussels, Belgium, to an American father of French and Italian heritage and a Scottish mother. He had an older brother named Stuart who died in August 2022 after a short illness. Molko&#x27;s family moved frequently during his childhood due to his father&#x27;s career as a banker; the family lived in Dundee in Scotland, Liberia, Lebanon, the village of Longeau in Belgium, before eventually settling in the town of Sandweiler, in Luxembourg.

Although Molko was brought up in a strict household that disapproved of artistic expression (his father wanted him to become a banker), he rebelled by assuming an androgynous image, wearing nail polish, lipstick, and eyeliner, and listening to punk music.
He initially attended the European School of Luxembourg (ESL), but left because he was bullied. He completed his secondary education at the American International School of Luxembourg (AISL), before studying drama at Goldsmiths College in London.

==Career==

Although Molko and Placebo co-founder Stefan Olsdal had both attended the American International School of Luxembourg (AISL), they had not been friends. When Molko was living in London, he ran into Olsdal at South Kensington tube station and invited him to one of his gigs he played with Steve Hewitt in a group called Ashtray Heart.

Along with Hewitt and Olsdal, Molko had a role in the 1998 film &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;, for which Placebo performed the T. Rex song &quot;20th Century Boy&quot;. He played Malcolm, a singer of the fictional glam rock band, &quot;The Flaming Creatures&quot;, who resembled the early Alice Cooper band.

During Placebo&#x27;s live performances Molko has played a number of instruments, including guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, harmonica and saxophone.

==Personal life==

Molko is bisexual, a theme that is reflected in some of his earlier lyrics with Placebo. Molko was previously in a relationship with Helena Berg, with whom he has a son, Cody Molko, who was born in 2005. Cody is now an actor, and appeared in the television series &quot;The Drowning&quot;.

Molko has been open about his use of recreational drugs: in a 1997 interview with &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine he admitted that heroin was &quot;probably the only drug on this planet I haven&#x27;t tried&quot;. However, he later admitted to using heroin as well. Pharmaceutical drugs are also referenced, as evidenced by the band&#x27;s name as well as the album &quot;Meds&quot; and its title track. Molko admitted in 2003 that many of his initial excesses were due to his mental health issues; he was officially diagnosed with major depressive disorder in his late twenties. He claimed in 2016 that he gave up drugs completely after the recording and release of &quot;Meds&quot;.

Molko is bilingual in French and English.

In December 2012 Molko received an Honorary Fellowship from Goldsmiths College, University of London.

In March 2021, Molko was featured in the Marc Jacobs &quot;Heaven&quot; collection with a campaign shot taken by Harley Weir.

In August 2023, Prime Minister of Italy Giorgia Meloni sued Molko for defamation after he called her a &quot;fascist racist&quot; while performing at the Sonic Park Festival in Stupinigi in July. In February 2025, Molko was charged with defamation by prosecutors, following attempts by the Turin prosecutor to determine his domicile for administrative in March 2024.
