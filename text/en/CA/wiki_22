<text>Varvara (, ) is a village in southeastern Bulgaria, located in the Tsarevo Municipality of the Burgas Province. 

== Geography ==
This seaside resort is situated on the Black Sea coast within Strandzha Nature Park, between the towns of Tsarevo and Ahtopol, near the border with Turkey.

== History ==
In the middle of the 19th century, the site of the modern village was uninhabited, except for the small monastery or chapel of Saint Barbara with holy springs, after which the village was named. An older settlement may well have existed, as indicated by the marking of the name &quot;Vardarah&quot; on Max Šimek&#x27;s 1748 and Christian Ludwig&#x27;s 1788 map in that area. Until the Balkan Wars, Varvara was a small Ottoman village of ethnic Turkish refugees from northern Bulgaria who settled there following the Liberation of Bulgaria in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78. After 1913, the Turks moved out and were replaced by Bulgarian refugees from Eastern Thrace

The village is best known for its intellectual community of artists and writers. Many young artists came to Varvara in the 1970s and 1980s and populated a small camp called &quot;The Sea Club&quot; which the Academy of Arts in Sofia had purchased for them. Over the years a larger group of artists established themselves in Varvara and started to buy real estate and build a small community.
 Recently neo-pagan community set foot in the village and occasionally baptizing events in the pagan rites have been reported. This July (2023) Eduard - youngster from famous lawyer&#x27;s family descent is being initiated in the new religion.

== Demographics ==
Many fishermen also live in the village. The population is from many backgrounds with an increasing number of Western Europeans taking up residence both seasonally and full-time. There is also a Romani community. The size of the village and its intellectual values have helped in the creation of a diverse yet close community who undertake many projects together such as the recent building of a new small church that was constructed in a combined effort of locals and some of the Bulgarians who form part of this community.

== Economy ==
The newly renovated road to Burgas puts the International Airport within an hour&#x27;s drive. Besides fishing, the major source of income today is tourism. There is a secluded sandy beach, and one of the most famous diving areas on the Black Sea known as the Dardaneli lies next to the village. This is a series of underwater caves and canyons offering snorkeling and diving on the coast. There are also several family hotels, bars and restaurants.

==Places to visit==
Varvara is known primarily for its beautiful sea. Although the sandy beach is quite small, it is among the most beautiful on the Black Sea coast. Due to its remoteness, the village has managed to preserve its pure nature and crystal clear sea waters. The village is surrounded by rocky bays suitable for spearfishing and diving.

There are traces of a late antique and medieval fortress on the nearby Papia peak.

Near Varvara is the Iron Tree, made especially for the filming of &quot;The Great Night Bath&quot;. This is the place where hippies have been welcoming July morning for years.

==Annual events==
In the first week of September, the Barbara Fair takes place for 2 days. In the evening of the first fire-dancing dances are organized, and at noon of the second - folk fights.

== Honour ==
Varvara Cove in Nelson Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Varvara.

<doc id="763061" wikidata="Q2436036" url="?curid=763061" title="Tioga Pass">
<text>Tioga Pass is a mountain pass in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California. State Route 120 runs through it, and serves as the eastern entry point for Yosemite National Park, at the Tioga Pass Entrance Station. It is the highest elevation highway pass in California and in the Sierra Nevada at an elevation of . Mount Dana is to the east of the pass, and Gaylor Peak to the west.

==Etymology==
Tioga Pass is named after Tioga Mine, whose name came from the Tioga River in New York: &quot;Tioga&quot; is an Iroquois and Mohawk term meaning &quot;where it forks&quot;.

==Description==
This pass, like many other passes in the Sierra Nevada, has a gradual approach from the west and drops off to the east dramatically, losing more than by the time the road reaches U.S. Route 395.

The pass is subject to winter closure due to high snowfall, normally from around the end of October until the end of May the following year, though these dates are subject to considerable variation. In heavy snow years, the road has closed in early October, and has remained closed as late as late July. In light snow years, the road may remain open until December and open as early as April.

Tioga Pass is the most direct route from Bishop or Mammoth Lakes, California to Fresno, Merced, and Stockton. There are four highway passes to the north, between Yosemite and Lake Tahoe, but none to the south for about , until Sherman Pass in southern Tulare County.

The pass is on the Great Basin Divide, which demarcates the Great Basin, which is the largest contiguous area of endorheic basins in North America.

==Recreation== 
There are several trailheads into the Yosemite backcountry which begin at Tioga Pass, including the trail to the Gaylor Lakes to the west/northwest, and the trail to the summit of Mount Dana. Dana Meadows is immediately south of the pass alongside the highway, as the pass itself is roughly angled north–south as opposed to east–west. Dana Meadows contains several small lakes.

A popular recreation and camping area exists just north of the summit of the pass at Tioga Lake. It is in the Inyo National Forest.

Less than 7 miles to the southwest of the pass, inside Yosemite National Park, is Tuolumne Meadows. The Pacific Crest Trail passes through, and it crosses the highway here.

==Wildlife==
Some of the wildlife in the area include birds of prey, marmots, bobcats, and occasionally bighorn sheep can be seen.

<text>Calcium peroxide or calcium dioxide is the inorganic compound with the formula CaO2. It is the peroxide (O22−) salt of Ca2+. Commercial samples can be yellowish, but the pure compound is white. It is almost insoluble in water. 

==Structure and stability==
As a solid, it is relatively stable against decomposition. In contact with water however it hydrolyzes with release of oxygen. Upon treatment with an acid, it forms hydrogen peroxide.

==Preparation==
Calcium peroxide is produced by combining calcium salts and hydrogen peroxide:
:Ca(OH)2 + H2O2 → CaO2 + 2 H2O
The octahydrate precipitates upon the reaction of calcium hydroxide with dilute hydrogen peroxide. Upon heating it dehydrates.

==Applications==
It is mainly used as an oxidant to enhance the extraction of precious metals from their ores. In its second main application, it is used as a food additive under the E number E930 it is used as flour bleaching agent and improving agent.

In agriculture it is used in the presowing treatments of rice seed. Also, calcium peroxide has found use in aquaculture to oxygenate and disinfect water. In the ecological restoration industry it is used in the treatment of soils. Calcium peroxide is used in a similar manner to magnesium peroxide for environmental restoration programs. It is used to restore soil and groundwater contaminated with petroleum by the process of enhanced in-situ bioremediation. It is a minor component of some dentifrices. 

It is also used for curing polymers by oxidising terminal thiol groups to disulphide bridges.

<doc id="763122" wikidata="Q235597" url="?curid=763122" title="Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha">
<text>Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Beatrice Leopoldine Victoria; 20 April 1884 – 13 July 1966) was a member of the British royal family, a male-line granddaughter of Queen Victoria. She later married into the Spanish royal family, and was the wife of Prince Alfonso de Orleans y Borbón, Infante of Spain, a first cousin of Alfonso XIII of Spain.

==Early life==
Princess Beatrice was born on 20 April 1884 at Eastwell Park, Kent. Her father was Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, the second son of Queen Victoria and Albert, Prince Consort. Her mother was Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, the only surviving daughter of Alexander II of Russia and Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine. She was called &quot;Baby Bee&quot; by her family.

She was baptised at Eastwell House on 17 May 1884 by the Revd William Lloyd (her father&#x27;s chaplain); her godparents were Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom (her paternal aunt), the Duchess of Albany (her paternal uncle&#x27;s wife, represented by her mother), and William I, German Emperor (represented by her father).

Beatrice spent much of her childhood in Malta, where her father was serving in the Royal Navy. On 22 August 1893, following the death of Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Beatrice&#x27;s father&#x27;s uncle, the vacant duchy fell to her father, as Albert Edward, then Prince of Wales and future King Edward VII of the United Kingdom, had renounced his rights to the duchy in favor of succession to the British crown. The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh therefore travelled shortly afterwards to Coburg with their five children, where they took up residence. At the end of July 1899, she received the sacrament of confirmation at the Church of St. John in Oeslau, a village near Coburg. 

She was a bridesmaid at the wedding of their paternal cousins the Duke and Duchess of York (the future King George V and Queen Mary) on 6 July 1893.

Bee&#x27;s eldest sister, Queen Marie of Romania, described her in her memoirs:&quot;Baby Bee had always been a child of exceptional intelligence. Being the youngest, Mamma guarded and adored her with special fervour, but for all that Baby Bee was a forerunner of the youth today. In spite of all Mamma&#x27;s love and care, Baby Bee generally outwitted her anxious parent and had most things her own way.&quot;

==Marriage prospects==
In 1902, Princess Beatrice had a romance with Russian Grand Duke Michael, the younger brother of Tsar Nicholas II, and at that time the heir presumptive to the Imperial Throne. She began receiving letters from him in September 1902 and, although he was a Russian Grand Duke and she now a German Princess, they corresponded in English, and he nicknamed her &quot;Sima&quot;. However she was prevented from marrying the Grand Duke as the Russian Orthodox Church forbade the marriage of first cousins. Although such marriages had been allowed previously in the House of Romanov (Grand Duchess Catherine Pavlovna, whose hand was denied to Napoleon I, was twice allowed to wed first cousins; her descendants became the Russian branch of the Dukes of Oldenburg), the devout Nicholas II, official head of Russia&#x27;s church, refused to relax the rules for the sake of his brother.

In November 1903, Michael wrote to Beatrice telling her that he could not marry her. The situation was aggravated by a letter Beatrice then received from her elder sister Victoria Melita (&quot;Ducky&quot;), in which Michael was blamed for having callously initiated the doomed romance (when, a couple of years later Ducky, having divorced her first cousin Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, was told that remarriage to another first cousin, Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, would likewise be forbidden by the Tsar, she refused to take no for an answer; the couple eloped into exile). The humiliated Beatrice was sent to Egypt to recover from heartbreak, but pined and wrote reproachful letters to Michael until 1905.

Beatrice was then rumoured to be intending to marry Alfonso XIII of Spain, but this proved to be a false rumour also as he married her cousin Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg in 1906. It was at their wedding that Beatrice met a cousin of King Alfonso, Alfonso de Orleans y Borbón (12 November 1886 Madrid, Spain – 10 August 1975), Infante of Spain, 5th Duke of Galliera. The Spanish government objected to an &quot;infante&quot;″s proposed match with a British Princess who, unlike Queen Victoria Eugenie, had not agreed to convert to Roman Catholicism: the King was obliged to make clear that, should the wedding take place, the couple would have to live in exile.

Nonetheless, Beatrice and Alfonso married in a Roman Catholic and Lutheran ceremony at Coburg on 15 July 1909. The couple settled in Coburg until, in 1912, Alfonso and Beatrice were allowed to return to Spain and his rank of &quot;Infante&quot; was restored.

In August 1913, Beatrice was received into the Roman Catholic Church.

===Scandal and exile===
During King Alfonso XIII&#x27;s unhappy marriage, he had numerous affairs and dalliances, some of which produced illegitimate children. He allegedly also made advances toward Princess Beatrice, which she rebuffed. The King expelled her and her husband from Spain in 1916 under the pretext of sending Infante Alfonso on a mission to Switzerland. At the same time, the King&#x27;s circle of friends, who despised both Beatrice and Queen Ena, started to spread claims that Beatrice had been expelled because of her bad behaviour. Beatrice and her spouse were allowed to return to Spain in 1924.

The couple had three sons:

* Alvaro Antonio Fernando Carlos Felipe (20 April 1910 Coburg, Germany–22 August 1997)
* Alonso María Cristino Justo (28 May 1912 Madrid, Spain–18 November 1936 Spain); Killed in action during the Spanish Civil War
* Ataúlfo Carlos Alejandro Isabelo (20 October 1913 Madrid, Spain–4 October 1974 Málaga, Spain)

==Civil War==
The family moved to England, where their three sons were educated at Winchester College. The Spanish royal family eventually relented, and Beatrice and her family were allowed to return to Spain where they established their home at an estate in Sanlúcar de Barrameda.

The 1930s were an unhappy time for the family, as the collapse of the Spanish monarchy and the subsequent civil war led to the loss of much of the family&#x27;s wealth. After the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931, King Alfonso and his family fled into exile in Italy. In the years that followed, the political situation in Spain worsened as various groups wrestled for power. By the late-1930s, the conflicts had erupted into all-out civil war. Beatrice and Alfonso lost their estate during the war and the couple&#x27;s middle son, Alonso, was killed fighting for the fascist forces. 

The emblem of the Spanish Air Force was designed by him based on the ceiling of the Egyptian library of the Sanlúcar Palace, copied by the Royal Air Force of the United Kingdom and by other countries.

==Later life==
Beatrice died at her estate of El Botánico in Sanlúcar de Barrameda on 13 July 1966. Her husband survived her by nine years. Their son Ataulfo died, unmarried, in 1974. Their only grandchildren are the children of Prince Alvaro.

At the time of her death, Beatrice was the last surviving child of Prince Alfred and Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna.

<text>Kronstadt (, ) is a Russian port city in Kronshtadtsky District of the federal city of Saint Petersburg, located on Kotlin Island, west of Saint Petersburg, near the head of the Gulf of Finland. It is linked to the former Russian capital by a combination levee-causeway-seagate, the St Petersburg Dam, part of the city&#x27;s flood defences, which also acts as road access to Kotlin island from the mainland.

Founded in the early 18th century by Peter the Great, it became an important international centre of commerce whose trade role was later eclipsed by its strategic significance as the primary maritime defence outpost of the former Russian capital. The main base of the Russian Baltic Fleet was located in Kronstadt, guarding the approaches to Saint Petersburg. In March 1921, the island city was the site of the Kronstadt rebellion.

The historic centre of the city and its fortifications are part of the World Heritage Site that is &quot;Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments&quot;.

Kronstadt has been a place of pilgrimage for Orthodox Christians for many years due to the memory of Saint John of Kronstadt.

==Name==
The name of the city is alternatively spelled as &quot;Kronshtadt&quot;, &quot;Cronstadt&quot; or &quot;Kronštadt&quot;. It is derived from German &quot;Kronstadt&quot; (). The district is referred to as Kronshtadtsky District.

==History==
===Foundation===

Kronstadt was founded by Peter the Great, whose Imperial Russian forces took the island of Kotlin from the Swedes during the Great Northern War in 1703. The first fortifications were inaugurated on . These fortifications, known as (Кроншлот), were constructed very quickly. During the winter, the Gulf of Finland freezes over completely. Under the command of Governor-general Alexander Danilovich Menshikov, workers used thousands of frames (caissons) made of logs from evergreen trees filled with stones which were moved by horses across the frozen sea, and placed in cuttings made in the ice. Thus, several new small islands were created, and forts were erected on them, virtually closing access to Saint-Petersburg by sea. Only two narrow navigable channels remained, with forts guarding them.

One of the first governors of Kronstadt was a veteran of the Royal Scots Navy, Admiral Thomas Gordon who was a refugee in Russia from the Scottish union with England and became chief commander of the port of Kronstadt from 1727 to 1741.

Just as Kronstadt became populated and fortified, it attracted merchants from maritime powers most notably, the Dutch, the British and the Germans through the old &quot;Hanse&quot; connections. The community of British merchants or &quot;factors&quot; came to be known as the &quot;English Factory&quot;, despite the fact that many of them were Scots. They settled both in Kronstadt and in St Petersburg itself and for a time dominated both inward and outward trade, especially in the reign of Catherine the Great. They became an integral part of British trade and foreign policy through the Board of Trade in London. A number of the British settlers became naturalised Russians. Trading alliances were sharply interrupted by the outbreak of the Crimean War (1854).

Kronstadt was thoroughly refortified in the 19th century. The old three-decker forts, five in number, which formerly constituted the principal defences and had resisted the Anglo-French fleets during the Crimean War, became of secondary importance. From the plans of Eduard Totleben a new fort, Fort Constantine, and four batteries were constructed (1856–1871) to defend the principal approach, and seven batteries to cover the shallower northern channel. All these fortifications were low and thickly armoured earthworks with heavy Krupp guns on their ramparts. The city is surrounded by an enceinte.

In summer 1891, the French fleet was officially received in Kronstadt. It was a first step towards the forthcoming Franco-Russian Alliance.

===Russian Civil War===
During the Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg) riots of the February Revolution, the sailors of Petrograd joined the revolution and executed their officers, thus gaining a reputation as dedicated revolutionaries. During the civil war, the sailors participated on the &quot;red side&quot;, until 1921, when they rebelled against Bolshevik rule in the Kronstadt rebellion.

Kronstadt with its supporting forts and minefields was key in protecting Petrograd from foreign forces. Despite this, the cruiser &quot;Oleg&quot; was torpedoed and sunk by a small motor boat after participating in the bombardment of Krasnaya Gorka fort that had revolted against the Bolsheviks. This was followed on August 18, 1919, by a raid of seven Royal Navy Coastal Motor Boats inside the harbour of Kronstadt itself, damaging the Soviet battleships and &quot;Andrei Pervozvanny&quot;, and sinking a submarine supply ship, the .
===Kronstadt Rebellion===
In 1921, a group of naval officers and men, together with soldiers and civilian supporters, rebelled against the Bolshevik government in Soviet Kronstadt. The garrison had previously been a centre of major support for the Bolsheviks, and throughout the Civil War of 1917–1921, the naval forces at Kronstadt had been at the vanguard of the main Bolshevik attacks. Their demands included freedom of speech, the end of deportation to work camps, a change in Soviet war politics, and liberation of the soviets (workers&#x27; councils) from &quot;party control&quot;. After brief negotiations, Leon Trotsky (then the Minister of War in the Soviet Government, and the leader of the Red Army) responded by sending the army to Kronstadt, along with the Cheka. The uprising was thus suppressed following a massacre.

===Interwar and World War II===
In the late 1930s, the fortified city became the base of the Soviet Baltic Fleet. During that time it was an important training centre for the Soviet navy. The Kronstadt naval dockyard overhauled and repaired surface ships and submarines for the Baltic Fleet. All forts and batteries of the city were reconstructed.

At 23:37 on June 21, 1941, fleet operational readiness Number 1 was announced by Baltic Fleet Commander Vice Admiral V. Tributs on the order of the People&#x27;s Commissar of the Navy Admiral N.G. Kuznetsov. Several hours later the first German aircraft began dropping mines into the canal outside Kronstadt. The duty officer, first lieutenant S. Kushnerev, ordered anti-aircraft batteries to open fire on enemy planes. Several aircraft were shot down or damaged. Twenty-seven German planes took part in the first attack, and three were destroyed by the anti-aircraft guns of the 1st Air Defence Regiment of the Baltic Fleet. This regiment was situated in the southern forts.


During World War II, Kronstadt was subject to several bombing raids by the Luftwaffe. In August 1941 the Luftwaffe began bombing Kronstadt repeatedly. The most notable bombing was Stuka ace Hans-Ulrich Rudel&#x27;s sinking of the battleship &quot;Marat&quot;.

To prevent an enemy landing, 13 artillery batteries were established in Kronstadt with nine more batteries outside the city, on the island of Kotlin. The main lookout was located in the &quot;Naval Cathedral&quot;. Visual range reached . The coastal defence forces of Kronstadt included two infantry regiments.

In late August, the Red Army in the Baltic States was in a critical situation. Tallinn, the main base of the fleet, was in danger and an order to relocate the fleet from Tallinn to Kronstadt was given. By the time the Soviets had decided on a maritime evacuation of Tallinn, over 200 Soviet civilian and military vessels had been assembled in Tallinn harbour.

After the evacuation of Tallinn, a submarine subdivision had been organized in Kronstadt. By the end of 1941, 82 naval operations had taken place. Hitler was enraged, because Soviet submarines frequently disrupted military supplies of strategic materials from Sweden to Germany. The Germans tried to block the exit completely from the Gulf of Finland with anti-submarine nets and mines. Despite these efforts, the Soviet submariners continued to attack German ships. In 1942, 29 German vessels were sunk. Submarines cooperated with reconnaissance aircraft in searching for military targets.

Soviet submarines had broken through the mine barrages in the Gulf of Finland in 1942. To keep the Soviet submarine force away from Baltic shipping stronger efforts were planned. The minefields would be larger and in addition a double submarine net would be laid from Porkkala to Naissaar in &quot;Operation Walross&quot;. The blockade of the Gulf of Finland turned out to be 100% effective. But in 1944, when Finland signed a peace treaty with the Soviet Union, one of the conditions was that the Soviets could locate one naval base in Finland at Porkkala. Submarine warfare in the Baltic Sea reached its final stage after peace was reached with Finland.

The Baltic Fleet sent more than 125,000 people to serve on shore at the front. Eighty-three thousand people fought directly on the Leningrad Front. For the protection of Leningrad 10 brigades of naval infantry, four regiments, and more than 40 separate battalions and companies were formed in Kronstadt.

The Luftwaffe and German artillery sent thousands of bombs and shells onto the naval dockyard and the Arsenal factory. The German air raids in September 1941, damaged ships of the Baltic Fleet and the infrastructure of the naval dockyard. Several sections of the yard were destroyed, the docks were heavily bombed causing the death of dozens of workers and engineers. Nevertheless, the naval yard continued its work. Despite the siege, the workers persevered with their work, often working 18–20 hours a day.

Thanks to the power of the Kronstadt Fortress the destruction of Leningrad, then the main industrial and cultural centre of the Soviet Union, was successfully prevented. The honorary status of &quot;City of Military Glory&quot; was conferred on it by the President of the Russian Federation Dmitriy Medvedev on April 27, 2009, citing the &quot;courage, endurance and mass heroism, exhibited by defenders of the city in the struggle for the freedom and independence of the Motherland&quot;.

==Population==
With changing historical trends, the population saw peaks and troughs partly determined by the expansion and then decline of the naval base and dockyard.

Recent population data indicate it has stabilised as follows: 

==Places of interest==

The city of Kronstadt is built on level ground on the island and is thus exposed to flooding, most notably in 1824. The port is icebound for 140–160 days in the year, from the beginning of December to April. A very large proportion of the inhabitants are sailors. On the south side of the city there are three harbours: the large western or merchant harbour, the western flank of which is formed by a great pier joining the fortifications which traverse the breadth of the island on one side. The middle harbour was used chiefly for fitting out and repairing vessels. The eastern or military harbour was used for docking vessels of the Russian Navy. The Peter and Catherine Canals connected with the merchant and middle harbours across the city. Between them stood the old &quot;Italian Palace&quot; of Prince Menshikov, whose site was later occupied by a school for pilots. In the second half of the 18th century the building of the former Italian palace was used by various military training institutions. In 1771–1798 the Sea Cadet Corps was housed there before being transferred to St Petersburg. From 1798 to 1872 the Navigation School was situated in the former palace.
The Kronstadt tide gauge is situated near the former Italian palace. Sea level observations in Saint Petersburg began already in 1703. On Kotlin Island, the main naval fortress of the Russian Empire began observations in 1707. This monitoring was necessary because the water level of the Finnish Gulf could change considerably in a short time, creating problems for shipping. The annual flood also required close monitoring of the water level. The Kronstadt sea-gauge with the tide gauge pavilion is the zero level of the Baltic system of highs and lows. All depths and altitudes (even the heights of spacecraft) in Russia and some other countries of the former Russian Empire are measured according to the Kronstadt sea-gauge. Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, said in 1967 that it was &quot;the Hub of the Universe&quot;.

The modern city&#x27;s most striking landmark is considered to be the enormous Naval Cathedral, dedicated to St Nicholas and built between 1908 and 1913 in Anchor Square which also contains many military memorials. The cathedral is regarded as the culmination of Russian Neo-Byzantine architecture.
The Pyotrovsky Gardens is a park that surrounds the monument to Peter the Great who founded the city.
There are a number of historic buildings, such as the &quot;Dutch Kitchen&quot; and the former &quot;Italian Palace&quot;, that recall the city&#x27;s mercantile and military past.
Among other public buildings are the Naval Hospital, the British Seamen&#x27;s Hospital (established in 1867), the Civic Hospital, the Admiralty (founded in 1785), the arsenal, dockyards and foundries, the School of Marine Engineering, and the English Church.

The Kronstadt port was once considered the most fortified port in the world. It still retains some of its old &quot;forts&quot; on small fortified artificial islands. Originally, there were 22 such forts, situated in line with the southern and northern shores of the Gulf of Finland. Some fortifications were located inside the city itself and one was on the western shore of Kronslot Island, on the other side of the main navigational channel.

The construction of the Saint Petersburg Dam led to some of the forts being demolished. The dam, a &quot;levee-causeway-Seagate combination&quot; also enabled Kronstadt and some of the forts being reached by land. Among the most important surviving forts are:

*&quot;Fort Konstantin&quot;, the biggest in the Gulf of Finland
*&quot;Fort Rif&quot; on the western shore of the island; and the particularly well-preserved Fort Alexander I, &quot;the Plague Fort&quot;
*&quot;Fort Totleben&quot;, named after Eduard Totleben, the largest and the newest of the forts, built at the beginning of the 20th century.

There are daily bus and water tours to Kronstadt from Saint Petersburg.

===Devotion to St. John of Kronstadt===
The now demolished older St Andrew Cathedral (1817), once a prominent Kronstadt landmark, was destroyed on Communist orders in 1932. St John of Kronstadt, one of the most venerated Russian saints, served there as priest from 1855 to 1908.

===Saint Petersburg Dam===

The controversial dam that took 30 years to build (1980–2011) now links Kotlin island to the mainland from north and south, not only acts as part of the flood defences, but lets through shipping and completes the St Petersburg ring-road system, across the island. It is a feat of marine engineering consisting of a combination of levee-causeway and seagate. Its construction on the shoals of the Gulf of Finland involved the removal of some of the historic fortifications.

<text>KQED (channel 9) is a PBS member television station licensed to San Francisco, California, United States, serving the San Francisco Bay Area. The station is owned by KQED Inc., alongside fellow PBS station KQEH (channel 54) and NPR member KQED-FM (88.5). The three stations share studios on Mariposa Street in San Francisco&#x27;s Mission District and transmitter facilities at Sutro Tower.

KQET (channel 25) in Watsonville operates as a full-time satellite of KQED, serving the Santa Cruz–Salinas–Monterey market. This station&#x27;s transmitter is located at Fremont Peak, near San Juan Bautista.

==History==
KQED was organized and founded by veteran broadcast journalists James Day and Jonathan Rice on June 1, 1953, and first signed on the air on April 5, 1954, as the fourth television station in the San Francisco Bay Area and the sixth public television station in the United States, debuting shortly after the launch of WQED in Pittsburgh. The station&#x27;s call letters, &quot;Q.E.D.&quot;, are taken from the Latin phrase, &quot;quod erat demonstrandum&quot;, commonly used in mathematics. The station was originally licensed to Berkeley, but changed its city of license to San Francisco on July 24, 1956.

In its early days following the station&#x27;s sign-on, KQED broadcast only twice a week for one hour each day. Despite the very limited schedule, the station was still losing money, leading to a decision in early 1955 from its board of trustees to close down the station. Its staff got the board to keep the station on the air and tried to get needed funds from the public in a form of a televised auction, in which celebrities would appear to auction off goods and services donated to the station. While the station still came a little short, it did show that the general public cared to keep KQED on the air. Since then, the auction became a fund-raising tool for many public television stations, though its usage waned in recent years in favor of increased usage of special pledge drives throughout the year.

In 1970, KQED inherited KNEW-TV (channel 32) from Metromedia and changed the station&#x27;s call letters to KQEC, but found they could not operate it without losing money. Various PBS and locally produced programs from KQED would air erratically and at different times of the day on KQEC. In 1988, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) revoked KQED&#x27;s license to operate KQEC, citing excessive off-air time, further charging dishonesty in previous filings with regard to the specific reasons. The alleged dishonesty was in reference to KQED&#x27;s claim of financial woes for keeping KQEC off the air for most of 1972 through 1977, and again for several months in 1979 and 1980. After being revoked from KQED&#x27;s hands, the reassigned license was granted to the Minority Television Project (MTP), one of the challengers of the KQED/KQEC filing. The KQEC call letters were changed to KMTP-TV under the new license.

During the early 1990s, when the state of California reintroduced the death penalty, the KQED organization waged a legal battle for the right to televise the forthcoming execution of Robert Alton Harris at San Quentin State Prison. The decision to pursue the videotaping of executions was controversial among those on both sides of the capital punishment debate.

KQED was co-producer of the television adaptation of Armistead Maupin&#x27;s novel &quot;Tales of the City&quot;, which aired on PBS stations nationwide in January 1994. The original six-part series was produced by Britain&#x27;s public-service Channel 4 Corporation with KQED and PBS&#x27; &quot;American Playhouse&quot;. The series featured gay themes, nudity, and illicit drug use in this fictional portrayal of life in 1970s San Francisco. Although the program gave PBS its highest ratings ever for a dramatic program, PBS bowed to threats of federal funding cuts and announced it would not participate in the television production of an adaptation of the second book in the series, &quot;More Tales of the City&quot;. The film division of KQED was founded by Irving Saraf.

With financial constraints looming, KQED announced in June 1995 that it would begin showing 30-second advertisements from corporate sponsors the following month.

The station started a school-age channel using some PBS Kids shows and syndicated shows such as &quot;The Zula Patrol&quot; and &quot;Wunderkind Little Amadeus&quot; in 2005. KQED also became a PBS Kids Sprout partner, which gave the station goodwill to get carriage on Comcast&#x27;s systems.

On May 1, 2006, KQED and the KTEH Foundation agreed to merge to form Northern California Public Broadcasting. While broadcasting its own kids channel, the station intended to pick up the planned PBS Kids Go! channel when launched in April 2006. However, the PBS Kids Go! channel was canceled in July 2006 before broadcasting. Since the two stations shared a market and public TV&#x27;s digital carriage agreement with top cable operators required differentiation of the stations&#x27; services, PBS Kids Go! was a way to do so.

On November 11, 2010, KQED and NBR Worldwide, LLC, the owners of PBS business news program, the &quot;Nightly Business Report&quot;, reached into an agreement to open a bureau in the Silicon Valley to enhance coverage of &quot;NBR&quot;.

On January 1, 2011, KQED became a default PBS member station for San Luis Obispo, Santa Maria, and Santa Barbara (becoming available on cable providers in those markets), following Los Angeles public television station KCET&#x27;s defection from PBS, until KCET rejoined PBS in October 2019.

===KQET===
KQED&#x27;s Watsonville satellite station KQET first signed on the air on May 17, 1989, as KCAH, originally operating as a locally owned PBS member station serving the Monterey area. In the late 1990s, San Jose PBS member station KTEH acquired KCAH, converting channel 25 into a satellite of KTEH. The station changed its call letters to KQET on August 12, 2007, a year after the merger of KQED and KTEH. On October 1, 2007, KQET converted from a satellite of KTEH to a satellite of KQED.

==Programming==
Typical weekday programming on KQED is dominated by children&#x27;s programming from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m., with news and other programs running during the remainder of the day. The station&#x27;s prime time schedule features mainly programs provided by PBS. On Saturdays, children&#x27;s programming airs during the early morning hours, several cooking shows and other home programming airs during the late morning and afternoon hours, with movies or special programming during the evening and night hours. On Sundays, children&#x27;s programming airs during the early morning hours, with reruns of popular shows during the daytime and prime time. It is one of the most-watched PBS stations in the country during prime time.

KQED has carried the news program &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; ever since its debut as a national program in 1975. The program would eventually open a West Coast bureau at KQED&#x27;s studios in 1997 to extend coverage throughout the United States. Unlike most PBS member stations in the west, KQED airs the Eastern Edition of the &quot;NewsHour&quot; live at 3 p.m. PT/6 p.m. ET, followed by the Western Edition at 6 p.m. PT.

Noteworthy KQED television productions include the first installment of Armistead Maupin&#x27;s miniseries &quot;Tales of the City&quot;, &quot;Tongues Untied by Marlon Riggs&quot;, &quot;Film School Shorts&quot;, &quot;International Animation Festival&quot; hosted by Jean Marsh, and a series of programs focusing on the historic neighborhoods in San Francisco, such as The Castro and the Fillmore District. Most KQED San Francisco national presentations are distributed by American Public Television. Ongoing productions include &quot;Check, Please! Bay Area&quot;, &quot;Spark&quot;, &quot;Truly CA&quot;, and &quot;QUEST&quot;.

===News operation===
KQED-TV produced regularly scheduled news programming from 1963 to 2023 on television.

One of KQED&#x27;s early local programs was &quot;World Press&quot;, an hour-long weekly roundup of international news stories analyzed by a panel of political analysts, which debuted in 1963. Panel members, who were political science analysts specializing in each specific global area, each brought a newspaper for round table discussion. It was developed by San Francisco Supervisor Roger Boas, who brought his long-term interest in government, politics, television, and business to the show. The program &quot;summed up the foreign reaction to such events as the Kennedy assassinations, the Vietnam War, along with thousands of other events that have shaped the decade of the sixties.&quot; What started as a local public access program with no financial support became the longest continuously running discussion program televised on approximately 185 stations.

KQED was best known from the late 1960s through the 1970s for the first nightly news program on public television in the country. During a nine-week-long newspaper strike in 1968, KQED launched &quot;Newspaper of the Air&quot;, paying striking reporters $100 per week to report on a major story for the show. After the strike ended, the show was relaunched as &quot;Newsroom&quot; with the help of Fred W. Friendly and a $750,000 grant from the Ford Foundation. For many years, &quot;Newsroom&quot; show was anchored by Belva Davis, a pioneering African-American broadcaster. In 1980, the nightly news broadcast was canceled, citing rising costs. It was replaced by a documentary production unit, which thrived for over a decade, producing a series of local documentaries and some major national productions, including two Peabody Award winners, &quot;Broken Arrow: Can a Nuclear Weapons Accident Happen Here?&quot; (1980–81) and &quot;The Case of Dashiell Hammett&quot; (1982). The staff also regularly produced feature news stories for the &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour&quot;, which was influenced by &quot;Newsroom&quot;.

Davis continued to host a weekly news program, &quot;This Week in Northern California&quot;, until her retirement on November 9, 2012. The following year, the program was relaunched as &quot;KQED Newsroom&quot;, named after the pioneering 1960s show, with Thuy Vu as host on October 18, 2013 (two months after Vu became the host of &quot;This Week in Northern California&quot;). After Vu left on June 21, 2019, Priya David Clemens became host on February 28, 2020, until the series finale of the program. &quot;KQED Newsroom&quot; aired its last episode, the second of a two-part retrospective on the station&#x27;s news operation, on June 23, 2023. KQED Inc. continues to air news and public affairs programming on KQED 88.5 FM, online, and social media platforms.

===Children&#x27;s programming===

&quot;Raggs&quot; was a children&#x27;s program produced by KQED for American Public Television and PBS Kids, for syndication to public television stations. &quot;Raggs&quot; and would first be test-marketed on ten public television stations, including KQED and its partners, before launching nationwide in 2008. On May 11, 2009, PBS announced that the station would co-produce another show, &quot;The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!&quot;, for broadcast on PBS Kids.

==Publishing==
In 1955, KQED began publishing a programming guide called &quot;KQED in Focus&quot;, which eventually began to add more articles and took on the character of a regular magazine. The title of the publication was later changed to &quot;Focus Magazine&quot; and then to &quot;San Francisco Focus&quot;. In 1984, a new programming guide, &quot;Fine Tuning&quot; was separated from &quot;Focus&quot;, with &quot;Focus&quot; carrying on as a self-contained magazine. In the early 1990s, &quot;San Francisco Focus&quot; was the recipient of number of journalism and publishing awards, including a National Headliner Award for feature writing in 1993. In 1997, KQED sold &quot;San Francisco Focus&quot; to Diablo Publications to pay off outstanding debt. In 2005, &quot;San Francisco Focus&quot; was resold to Modern Luxury Media, who rebranded the magazine as &quot;San Francisco&quot;.

The program guide was published on kqed.org as &quot;the Guide&quot;. It has been renamed &quot;On KQED&quot;.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KQED began broadcasting and transmitting a digital television signal on UHF channel 30 on May 15, 2000. KQED shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 9, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 30, using virtual channel 9.

KQET shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 25, on May 9, 2009. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 58, which was among the high band UHF channels (52–69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era UHF channel 25.

<text>Alex García is a Cuban American chef who helped popularize a version of Cuban food at several New York City restaurants and on the Food Network. Born in Havana, García attended Northeastern University in Massachusetts where he earned a degree in hotel and restaurant management. García later attended the Culinary Institute of America, and Florida International University. He worked alongside chef Douglas Rodriguez for four years at Yuca restaurant in Miami. García&#x27;s work in New York has included stints on the Food Network in Soho, &quot;Babalu&quot;, &quot;Patria&quot;, and &quot;Calle Ocho&quot;.

García&#x27;s first cookbook, &quot;In a Cuban Kitchen&quot; ( ), was published in September 2004 in the United States and in England. His career suffered a setback in 2003 when he was indicted in federal district court in Brooklyn and charged with conspiracy and money laundering. García was found guilty of money laundering, but served no time. In 2007 García was the consulting chef at a new restaurant called &quot;Carniceria&quot; on Smith Street, Brooklyn, as well as the Gaucho Steak Company, a themed South American fast food outlet in Hells Kitchen.

Currently Chef Alex Garcia is the Director of Culinary Operations for Barrio Foods and leads the Barrio Foods catering business, MAMBO catering. Chef Garcia not only created the culinary programs but also oversees the kitchens at a number of his properties throughout New York City including Calle Ocho, the Copacabana Supper Club, the VIP food service at the Copacabana Nightclub, Barrio, Havana Café, Havana Room, Open Book Café at the Brooklyn Public Library, Cabana Bar and Rooftop 760. In 2011, became the executive chef of Babalu Restaurant and Lounge in the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx.

Chef Garcia recently launched a range of authentic Spanish cookware products called Culinary Habana, and as founder of The Spice Company, he develops spice blends available for wholesale and retail purchase throughout New York City and the Caribbean.

<doc id="763138" wikidata="Q3234202" url="?curid=763138" title="Sonic weapon">
<text>Sonic and ultrasonic weapons (USW) are weapons of various types that use sound to injure or incapacitate an opponent. Some sonic weapons make a focused beam of sound or of ultrasound; others produce an area field of sound. military and police forces make some limited use of sonic weapons.

== Use and deployment ==
Extremely high-power sound waves can disrupt or destroy the eardrums of a target and cause severe pain or disorientation. This is usually sufficient to incapacitate a person. Less powerful sound waves can cause humans to experience nausea or discomfort.

The possibility of a device that produces frequency that causes vibration of the eyeballs—and therefore distortion of vision—was suggested by paranormal researcher Vic Tandy in the 1990s while attempting to demystify a &quot;haunting&quot; in his laboratory in Coventry. This &quot;spook&quot; was characterised by a feeling of unease and vague glimpses of a grey apparition. Some detective work implicated a newly-installed extractor fan, found by Tandy, that was generating infrasound of 18.9 Hz, 0.3 Hz, and 9 Hz.

A long-range acoustic device (LRAD) produces a 30 degree cone of audible sound in frequencies within the human hearing spectrum (20 - 20000 Hz). An LRAD was used by the crew of the cruise ship &quot;Seabourn Spirit&quot; in 2005 to deter pirates who chased and attacked the ship. More commonly this device and others of similar design have been used to disperse protesters and rioters in crowd control efforts. A similar system is called a &quot;magnetic acoustic device&quot;. The Mosquito sonic devices have been used in the United Kingdom to deter teenagers from lingering around shops in target areas. The device works by emitting an ultra-high frequency blast (around 19–20 kHz) that teenagers or people under approximately 20 are susceptible to and find uncomfortable. Age-related hearing loss apparently prevents the ultra-high pitch sound from causing a nuisance to those in their late twenties and above, though this is wholly dependent on a young person&#x27;s past exposure to high sound pressure levels. In 2020 and 2021, Greek authorities used long-range sound cannons to deter migrants on the Turkish border.

High-amplitude sound of a specific pattern at a frequency close to the sensitivity peak of human hearing (2–3 kHz) is used as a burglar deterrent.

Some police forces have used sound cannons against protesters, for example during the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit, the 2014 Ferguson unrest, and the 2016 Dakota Access Pipeline protest in North Dakota, among others.

It has been reported that &quot;sonic attacks&quot; may have taken place in the American embassy in Cuba in 2016 and 2017 (&quot;Havana syndrome&quot;), leading to health problems, including hearing loss, in US and Canadian government employees at the US and Canadian embassies in Havana. However, more recent reports hypothesize microwave energy as the cause or their bodies tricking themselves via a mass psychogenic condition caused by extended periods of stress, such as working in an embassy of a nation considered hostile to your own.

==Research==
Studies have found that exposure to high intensity ultrasound at frequencies from 700 kHz to 3.6 MHz can cause lung and intestinal damage in mice. Heart rate patterns following vibroacoustic stimulation has resulted in serious negative consequences such as atrial flutter and bradycardia.

&quot;See: Microwave auditory effect&quot;

===Effects other than to the ears===
The extra-aural (unrelated to hearing) bioeffects on various internal organs and the central nervous system included auditory shifts, vibrotactile sensitivity change, muscle contraction, cardiovascular function change, central nervous system effects, vestibular (inner ear) effects, and chest wall/lung tissue effects. Researchers found that low-frequency sonar exposure could result in significant cavitations, hypothermia, and tissue shearing. No follow up experiments were recommended. Tests performed on mice show the threshold for both lung and liver damage occurs at about 184 dB. Damage increases rapidly as intensity is increased. The American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) has stated that there have been no proven biological effects associated with an unfocused sound beam with intensities below 100 mW/cm² SPTA or focused sound beams below an intensity level of 1 mW/cm² SPTA.

Noise-induced neurologic disturbances in scuba divers exposed to continuous low-frequency tones for durations longer than 15 minutes has involved in some cases the development of immediate and long-term problems affecting brain tissue. The symptoms resembled those of individuals who had suffered minor head injuries. One theory for a causal mechanism is that the prolonged sound exposure resulted in enough mechanical strain to brain tissue to induce an encephalopathy. Divers and aquatic mammals may also suffer lung and sinus injuries from high intensity, low-frequency sound. This is due to the ease with which low-frequency sound passes from water into a body, but not into any pockets of gas in the body, which reflect the sound due to mismatched acoustic impedance.

<text>Kotlin (; ) is a Russian island, located near the head of the Gulf of Finland, west of Saint Petersburg in the Baltic Sea. Kotlin separates the Neva Bay from the rest of the gulf. The fortified city of Kronstadt is located on the island and forms part of a World Heritage Site that is &quot;Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments&quot;. The island serves as a gateway to Saint Petersburg and as such has been the site of several military engagements.

==History==
The island is mentioned in the 13th century treaty of Novgorod with Hanseatic League and Gotland, once as &quot;Kotlign&quot; and twice as &quot;Kotling&quot;.
The city of Kronstadt was founded on Kotlin island by Peter the Great, who took it from the Swedes in 1703. In March 1921, Kotlin was the site of the Kronstadt rebellion, which resulted in over 11,000 casualties.

Off Kronstadt is Fort Alexander, an artificial island that housed a research laboratory on plague and other bacterial diseases, from 1898 to 1917.

==Geography==
In general outline, the island forms an elongated triangle; long by about broad, with its base towards St Petersburg. The eastern or broad end is occupied by the city of Kronstadt, and shoals extend for from the western point of the island to the rock on which the Tolbaaken lighthouse is built.

The island thus divides the seaward approach to St Petersburg into two channels; that on the northern side is obstructed by shoals which extend across it from Kotlin to Lisiy Nos; the southern channel, the highway to the former capital, is narrowed by a spit which projects from opposite Lomonosov on the Russian mainland, and, lying close to Kronstadt, has been historically strongly guarded by batteries.

The naval approach to Saint Petersburg was greatly facilitated by the construction in 1875–85 of a canal, deep, through the shallows, whereas cars can travel overland to the island by using the Saint Petersburg Dam from the north and south shores of the Gulf of Finland. Started in 1980, but delayed by political upheaval in the 1990s, the dam project was completed in 2010 and officially commissioned in 2011.

==Transportation==
The low water depth in Neva Bay was an incentive to build a Sea Canal to accommodate large vessels, this canal allows the movement of vessels with a draft of 11 metres (to fresh water), a length of 320 metres and a width of 42 metres.

<text>Sir John Reginald Hornby Nott-Bower (16 March 1892 – 3 October 1972) was Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, the head of the London Metropolitan Police, from 1953 to 1958. He was the first career police officer to hold this post.

Nott-Bower was a skilled horseman and polo player. He played rugby union for Tonbridge School and golf for the Metropolitan Police and Mid-Surrey. He was also very fond of bridge and fly fishing.

==Early life and career in India==
Nott-Bower was the son of William Nott-Bower, then chief constable of Liverpool City Police and later Commissioner of the City of London Police, and the great-grandson of Major-General Sir William Nott. He was educated at Tonbridge School and joined the Indian Police Service by competitive examination in 1911. He was posted to the United Provinces and served there until 1921, when he returned to England to work at the India Office in London. On 21 June 1918 he was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Indian Army Reserve of Officers, he resigned the commission in 1922.

In 1923 he returned to the United Provinces as a Superintendent. He commanded successively Allahabad, Lucknow and Bareilly districts, and also served in the Criminal Investigation Department. Nott-Bower married Kathleen Buck in 1928. They had two sons and a daughter. His son, Timothy Elwyn, married Anne Cameron, the eldest daughter of Sir Donald Cameron of Lochiel. In the 1931 Birthday Honours, he was awarded the King&#x27;s Police Medal (KPM) for bravery after he confronted Indian independence activist Chandrashekhar Azad on 27 February 1931.

==Metropolitan Police==
On 29 June 1933, Nott-Bower joined the Metropolitan Police as Chief Constable (second in command) of No.1 District, consisting of A (Whitehall), B (Westminster), C (St James&#x27;s), T (Hammersmith) and V (Wandsworth) Divisions. On 1 December 1933 he was promoted to Deputy Assistant Commissioner in command of the district. On 23 July 1937, he was appointed Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO).

On 1 September 1940, he was appointed Assistant Commissioner &quot;A&quot;, in charge of administration and uniformed policing. From 1945 to 1946 he was seconded to Austria as Inspector-General of the Public Safety Branch of the Allied Control Commission, and later as Director of the Internal Affairs Division of the commission. On his return he was promoted to Deputy Commissioner. He was appointed Officer of the Order of St John (OStJ) on 24 June 1949 and was knighted in the 1950 Birthday Honours. In the 1953 Coronation Honours, he was appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO).

==Commissioner==
On 13 August 1953, Nott-Bower was appointed Commissioner. Although he had been a popular and energetic Assistant and Deputy Commissioner, he was regarded as a somewhat lacklustre Commissioner.

In his 1955 book &quot;Against the Law&quot;, Peter Wildeblood quotes an article written by Donald Horne for the &quot;Sydney Morning Telegraph&quot; printed on 25 October 1953 referring to Nott-Bower&#x27;s role in the &#x27;Great Purge&#x27; .

&quot;The plan originated under strong United States advice to Britain to weed out homosexuals – as hopeless security risks – from important Government jobs.
One of the Yard&#x27;s top-rankers, Commander E. A. Cole, recently spent three months in America consulting with FBI officials in putting finishing touches to the plan. But the plan was extended as a war on all vice when Sir John Nott-Bower took over as the new Commissioner at Scotland Yard in August. Sir John swore he would rip the cover off all London&#x27;s filth spots...
Under laxer police methods before the US-inspired plan began, and before Sir John moved into the top job at the Yard as a man with a mission, Montagu and his film-director friend Kenneth Hume might never have been charged with grave offences against Boy Scouts...
Sir John swung into action on a nationwide scale. He enlisted the support of local police throughout England to step up the number of arrests for homosexual offences.
For many years past the police had turned a blind eye to male vice. They made arrests only when definite complaints were made from innocent people, or where homosexuality had encourages other crimes.
They knew the names of thousands of perverts – many of high social position and some world famous – but they took no action. Now, meeting Sir John&#x27;s demands, they are making it a priority job to increase the number of arrests...
The Special Branch began compiling a &quot;Black Book&quot; of known perverts in influential Government jobs after the disappearance of the diplomats Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess, who were known to have pervert associates. Now comes the difficult task of side-tracking these men into less important jobs – or putting them behind bars.&quot;

He introduced few reforms or innovations. He did set up the Research and Planning Branch and the Metropolitan and Provincial Regional Crime Squad and centralised traffic control in response to rising private car ownership. He did little to combat the rising crime rate, however; he refused to address the outdated hardline attitudes of many senior detectives, which were becoming increasingly out of step with postwar society; and he did not support his men in their claims for better pay and conditions. Police pay fell rapidly below inflation and rates of pay in the private sector. This caused recruiting problems and the force became seriously under strength. Nott-Bower was regarded by many of his officers as a pleasant but ineffectual man. He retired in August 1958 and Chairman of the fire alarm manufacturer Auto Call Company in April 1960.

<doc id="763160" wikidata="Q2862702" url="?curid=763160" title="The Elements (song)">
<text>&quot;The Elements&quot; is a 1959 song with lyrics by musical humorist, mathematician and lecturer Tom Lehrer, which recites the names of all the chemical elements known at the time of writing, up to number 102, nobelium. Lehrer arranged the music of the song from the tune of the &quot;Major-General&#x27;s Song&quot; from &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; by Gilbert and Sullivan. The song can be found on Lehrer&#x27;s albums &quot;Tom Lehrer in Concert&quot;, &quot;More of Tom Lehrer&quot; and &quot;An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer&quot;. 

The song is also included in the musical revue &quot;Tom Foolery&quot;, along with many of Lehrer&#x27;s other songs.

== Description of the song ==
The ordering of elements in the lyrics fits the meter of the song, and includes much alliteration, and thus has little or no relation to the ordering in the periodic table. This can be seen for example in the opening and closing lines:
 
Lehrer had been a mathematics student and lecturer at Harvard; in the closing lines of the song, he pronounced &quot;Harvard&quot; and &quot;discovered&quot; in a parody of the non-rhotic Boston accent to make the two words rhyme, even though he did not normally speak with that accent. He accompanied himself on the piano while singing the song.

== Background ==
The music of &quot;The Elements&quot; is arranged from the tune of the &quot;Major-General&#x27;s Song&quot; from &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; by Gilbert and Sullivan. Lehrer also drew inspiration from the song &quot;Tschaikowsky (and Other Russians)&quot;, written by Ira Gershwin, which listed fifty Russian composers in a similar manner.

&quot;The Elements&quot; differs musically from the &quot;Major-General&#x27;s Song&quot; in that:
* It omits the third verse of the original as well as all of the choral &quot;responses&quot;, and it adds an extra two lines at the end of the last verse.
* Lehrer simplifies the melody by primarily singing each phrase on a single note, instead of rapidly moving back and forth between two different notes as in Sullivan&#x27;s original melody.
* It is in the key of C, while the &quot;Major-General&#x27;s Song&quot; is in E-flat.
* On some of the live recordings, Lehrer pauses in the middle for spoken interludes, in which he talks to the audience (e.g., &quot;I hope you&#x27;re all taking notes, because there&#x27;s going to be a short quiz next period!&quot;) while vamping on the piano. 
* The song ends with a piano coda: &quot;Shave and a Haircut&quot;.

In some live performances, after the song was finished, Lehrer joked that an earlier version, from Aristotle&#x27;s time, lists only the classical elements: Earth, Air, Fire and Water, explaining that &quot;life was much simpler in those days&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;The Elements&quot; has been featured in popular culture many times. In the episode &quot;Ex-File&quot; of &quot;NCIS&quot;, Timothy McGee and Abby Sciuto hum the song, which forms a key clue in their case. In &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; episode &quot;The Pants Alternative&quot;, a drunk Sheldon Cooper starts to sing the song during his acceptance of an award from his university. In the 2006 episode of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; called &quot;The Real Paul Anka&quot;, Luke Danes&#x27;s daughter April and her classmates sing the song on the bus. Daniel Radcliffe sang &quot;The Elements&quot; on &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot; in 2010. David Costabile, as Gale Boetticher, sang along to the song in &quot;Something Beautiful&quot;, a 2018 episode of &quot;Better Call Saul&quot;.

Cover recordings include Jesse Dangerously on his album &quot;How to Express Your Dissenting Political Viewpoint Through Origami&quot;, where the song is titled &quot;Tom Lehrer&#x27;s The Elements&quot;.

<text>Mark 12 is the twelfth chapter of the Gospel of Mark in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It continues Jesus&#x27; teaching in the Temple in Jerusalem, and contains the parable of the Wicked Husbandmen, Jesus&#x27; argument with the Pharisees and Herodians over paying taxes to Caesar, and the debate with the Sadducees about the nature of people who will be resurrected at the end of time. It also contains Jesus&#x27; Greatest Commandment, his discussion of the messiah&#x27;s relationship to King David, condemnation of the teachers of the law, and his praise of a poor widow&#x27;s offering.

In the context of Mark&#x27;s chronology, these events, continuing from the challenge to Jesus&#x27; authority in Mark 11:27–33, take place during his third visit to the temple, traditionally identified with Holy Tuesday.

==Text==
The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 44 verses.

===Textual witnesses===
Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are:
*Codex Vaticanus (325–350; complete)
*Codex Sinaiticus (330–360; complete)
*Codex Bezae (~400; complete)
*Codex Alexandrinus (400–440; complete)
*Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450; extant verses 1–29)

===Old Testament references===
* Mark 12:36: Psalm 110:1

==Parable of the wicked husbandmen==
Jesus, after his argument with the chief priests of the Sanhedrin over his authority in Mark 11:27–33, speaks to &quot;them&quot; (&quot;the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders&quot;) in parables (εν παραβολαις, &quot;en parabolais&quot;, plural). While Matthew&#x27;s Gospel records several parables here, including the parable of the two sons and the parable of the wedding feast, Mark relates only one:

:&quot;A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country. And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard. And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty&quot;.

:&quot;And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled. And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some&quot;.

:&quot;Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son. But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours. And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.&quot;

:&quot;What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others. And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner: This was the Lord&#x27;s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?&quot; (1–11 KJV)

The scripture mentioned is a quotation from Psalm 118:22–23, the processional psalm for the three pilgrim festivals which also provided the source for the crowd&#x27;s acclamation as Jesus entered Jerusalem, &quot;Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord&quot;. The quote about the stone is from the Septuagint version of the Psalms, a version Jesus and Jews in Israel would probably not have used. Mark however, who clearly has the Septuagint as his Old Testament reference, may have simply used it for his audience, as they spoke Greek, or to clarify his sources, oral and/or written. For those who treat Mark as historically reliable, these predictions serve to demonstrate the power of Jesus&#x27; knowledge. Paul also refers to Jesus as a &quot;stone&quot; in Romans 9:33, but references this with quotes from Isaiah 8:14 and 28:16. Acts of the Apostles 4:11 records Peter as using the same Psalm to describe Jesus. 1 Peter references both Isaiah and the Psalm in 2:6-8, although most scholars, though not all, do not accept this letter as actually written by the Apostle Peter.

Anglican Bishop Tom Wright contrasts this parable with Jesus&#x27; first parable recorded in Mark, the parable of the sower. In that parable, &quot;one lot of seed failed, then another, and another but at last there was a harvest&quot;, whereas in this parable, one slave is sent, then another, but when the final messenger comes, the vineyard owner&#x27;s son, &quot;he is ignominiously killed&quot;.

Mark says that they (&quot;the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders&quot;) &quot;realized&quot; that Jesus was speaking about them and wanted to arrest him, but they would not do so for fear of the crowd. The passage invites interpretation as an allegory: the husbandmen are the priests and teachers, and perhaps the Judean authorities in general. The word could also be a metaphor for all of humanity. Many modern translations use the terms &quot;tenants&quot; or &quot;tenant farmers&quot; instead of &quot;husbandmen&quot;. The vineyard&#x27;s owner is God. A common interpretation of the servants is that of the prophets or all of God&#x27;s proceeding messengers, while the gentiles, or Christians, are the &quot;others&quot; who will be given the vineyard. The vineyard is Israel or more abstractly the promise made to Abraham by God. The owner&#x27;s son is Jesus. &quot;Beloved&quot; is what God has called Jesus in Mark 1 and 9 during his baptism and the Transfiguration.

Isaiah 5 uses similar language regarding God&#x27;s vineyard. Workers working the estates of absentee landlords happened frequently in the Roman Empire, making the story relevant to the listeners of the time. Vineyards were the source of grapes and wine, a common symbol of good in the Gospels. There is Jesus turning water into wine in John 2 and the saying about new wineskins in Mark 2:22. Natural growth, like Jesus&#x27; parables of the Mustard Seed and the Seed Growing Secretly in Mark 4, was probably a naturally understood metaphor for Mark&#x27;s audience, as the ancient world was largely an agricultural world.

This parable is also found in saying 65 of the Gospel of Thomas.

== Paying taxes to Caesar ==

&quot;They&quot; (the chief priests, scribes, and elders, or &quot;the Jewish leaders&quot;) sent some Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus. They offer false praise and hope to entrap him by asking him whether one should pay the taxes to the Romans. These two groups were antagonists, and by showing them working together against Jesus, Mark shows the severity of the opposition to him. Mark has mentioned them working together before in Mark 3:6. The Herodians, supporters of Herod Antipas, would have been in Jerusalem with Herod during his trip there for the Passover. Protestant theologian Heinrich Meyer notes that the (&quot;argeuō&quot;, &quot;entrap&quot;) is a hunting term. Jesus asked them to show him a &quot;denarius&quot;, a Roman coin, and asks whose image and inscription are on it. The coin was marked with Caesar&#x27;s image. Jesus then says &quot;Give to Caesar what is Caesar&#x27;s and to God what is God&#x27;s&quot; (17). Jesus thus avoids the trap, neither endorsing the Herodians and the Romans they supported, nor the Pharisees.

This same incident, with small differences, is also recorded in the Gospels of Matthew (22:15–22) and Luke (20:20–26). Mark&#x27;s account has been described as &quot;more concise and vivid&quot; than Matthew&#x27;s. Luke&#x27;s Gospel makes clear that &quot;They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said, so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor.&quot; Apparently, his interrogators anticipated that Jesus would denounce the tax. The charge of advocating non-payment of taxes was later leveled against Jesus before Pilate.

Giving God what is God&#x27;s might be an admonishment to meet one&#x27;s obligation to God as one must meet an obligation to the state. It could also be Jesus&#x27; way of saying that God, not Rome, controlled Israel, indeed the whole world, and thereby also satisfy the Pharisees. This passage is often used in arguments on the nature of the separation of church and state.

The same saying is found in the Gospel of Thomas as saying 100, with reference to &quot;a gold coin&quot; and the additional words &quot;...and give me what is mine&quot;.

Some writers cite this phrase in support of tax resistance: see, for example, Ned Netterville, Darrell Anderson, and Timmothy Patton.

== The resurrection and marriage ==

The opposition to Jesus now moves to the Sadducees, who deny the idea of the resurrection of the dead. The Sadducees only accepted the five books of the Torah as divinely inspired. The Jewish Levirate law, or Yibbum, states that if a man dies and his wife has not had a son, his brother must marry her. The Sadducees quote an example of a woman who has had seven husbands in this manner: [if there were a resurrection], who would she be married to when they all are resurrected from the dead?

Jesus says that the Sadducees are &quot;in error&quot; on two grounds, because they do not understand &quot;either the scriptures or God’s power&quot;. George Maclear notes that Jesus deals with the latter point first, stating that after the resurrection of the dead, no one will be married, &quot;...they will be like the angels in heaven&quot;. The Sadducees also denied the existence of angels and spirits. Turning then to scriptural content about the dead rising, Jesus continues: have you not read in the book of Moses, in the account of the bush, how God said to him, &#x27;I &quot;am&quot; (emphasis added) the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&#x27;? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly (or greatly) mistaken!&quot; (verses 25–27) The story of the burning bush is found in Exodus 3, i.e. within the biblical texts acknowledged by the Sadducees. Maclear adds that Jesus&#x27; reply &quot;embraces the whole area of their unbelief&quot;.

The belief in the resurrection of the dead was largely a fairly recent innovation in ancient Jewish thought, and Jesus defends the belief against the Sadducees, who consider it to be a false innovation. He quotes God&#x27;s statement to Moses on Mount Sinai made in the present tense about the patriarchs to show that God states them to be still in existence after their death, and thus that the doctrine of resurrection is present in the scripture from the beginning. Jesus concludes that the Sadducees &quot;greatly err&quot;. Meyer notes that the &quot;short pithy words&quot; of this assertion, (&quot;polu planasthe&quot;), do not need the additional words in the Textus Receptus, , &quot;humeis oun&quot;, &quot;you therefore&quot;).

So far in Mark&#x27;s gospel, Jesus has raised a dead girl and has predicted his own death and resurrection, in 8:31 for instance, but has not discussed the nature of resurrection in depth. Jesus largely defends the belief here, perhaps indicating Mark&#x27;s intended audience already knows it. Paul also describes bodily resurrection in 1 Corinthians 15, that it will be of a fundamentally different nature than people&#x27;s current physical nature. Jesus in the Gospel of Thomas uses an argument for eternal life based on the fact that the non-living matter of dead food becomes the living matter of the body after a person has eaten it. Philosophically the validity of Jesus&#x27; argument for the resurrection of the dead depends on the accuracy of the story of the burning bush, that is if God really did say that and meant it in that way existence is possible after death as God would never be wrong. The Pharisees also believed in the resurrection of the dead.

== The Greatest Commandment ==

A nearby scribe who hears Jesus&#x27; answer to their question comes over and asks Jesus what God&#x27;s greatest commandment is. Jesus replies &quot;The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel (the Shema, a centerpiece of all morning and evening Jewish prayer services); The Lord our God is one Lord: And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment. And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.&quot;

Jesus here quotes Deuteronomy 6:4–5 and Leviticus 19:18. Putting these two commandments together linked by love, putting loving others on the same level as loving God, was one of Jesus&#x27; theological innovations. See also Christianity and Judaism, Didache 1.2. The &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; article on Jesus argues this shows Jesus knew and approved of the Didache, in its Jewish form. Mark wrote this probably four decades after Jesus&#x27; death showing Christians still used Jewish prayer formats, this being in the form of daily prayers, at this period. Most Early Christians saw Jesus&#x27; teachings as summing up the essence of Jewish theology as opposed to the religion&#x27;s ritualistic components. Paul uses the same quotation from Leviticus in Galatians 5:14 and Romans 13:9 as summing up the law. See also Hillel the Elder.

The man agrees and says keeping these commandments is better than making sacrifices, to which Jesus replies that the man is &quot;not far from the kingdom of God&quot; (34). This seems to be Jesus&#x27; triumph over his opponents (or agreement with the Pharisees) as Mark states that this was the last question they asked him. Being &quot;not far&quot; from God can be seen in the sense of close to knowledge of God. Others have seen &quot;far&quot; as actually referring to a spatial distance from God, maybe from Jesus himself.

== Teaching the crowd ==
Jesus continues to teaches in the Temple. This probably took place along the Temple&#x27;s eastern wall.

After overcoming his opponents&#x27; traps, Jesus poses a question of his own. He asks the crowd &quot;How is it that the teachers of the law say that the Christ is the son of David? David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: &#x27;The Lord [יְהֹוָה Yĕhovah] said to my Lord [אָדוֹן &#x27;adon]: Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.&#x27; David himself calls him &#x27;Lord.&#x27; How then can he be his son?&quot; This is a quote from Psalm 110:1, which was traditionally believed to have been written by David himself. This Psalm was used during the coronation of the ancient Kings of Israel and Judea.

This passage has caused much debate. It is a promise made to David by God. The first Lord mentioned is God and the second Lord was believed by Jews and then later Christians to refer to the messiah. Since David is here calling the messiah Lord the messiah must be superior to David. &quot;Son&quot; was a term of submission as &quot;father&quot; was a term of authority, so one can not say that the messiah will be inferior to David by using the term son.

Is Jesus saying that the messiah is not David&#x27;s biological heir, or that he is greater than only David&#x27;s heir, that the Messiah&#x27;s kingdom is far greater than merely an earthly successor to David&#x27;s political kingdom? The messiah was to be from the house of David, as both Matthew and Luke use their genealogies of Jesus to show. Mark has no genealogy or virgin birth. Some have argued that this is Mark&#x27;s way of explaining why Jesus, from such a poor family, could possibly be the messiah. Since most modern critical scholars reject the genealogies in Luke and Matthew, some have argued that Jesus did not claim descent from David, and this is thus Jesus&#x27; explanation of this. Mark however seems to state Jesus to be David&#x27;s heir. Jesus was acclaimed as bringing the kingdom of David in Mark 11:10. Mark had the demons call him the Son of God in 3:11 and 5:7. Peter called him the Christ in Mark 8:29. Bartimaeus, the blind beggar whom Jesus healed, called him the Son of David in 10:47, although Jesus has not referred to himself in this manner directly, an interesting choice for Mark to make, fitting with his theme of the Messianic Secret. Jesus usually refers to himself as the Son of man. Jesus explicitly says he is the messiah and the &quot;Son of the Blessed One&quot; in Mark 14:61–62 and perhaps tells Pilate he is the King of the Jews in Mark 15:2: &quot;He answered him, &#x27;You say so.&#x27;&quot;(NRSV). Mark clearly wrote to show Jesus is the Jewish messiah prophesied to be David&#x27;s heir and successor, so why this speech and no explicit statement by Jesus of Davidic descent? Is he simply saying that the messiah is superior to David, whether from his house or not? If the messiah is indeed God, as the Psalm was interpreted by some Early Christians, then his glory is greater than the glory of any one house.

Both Matthew and Luke use the same story, showing they did not think it contradicted their claim of descent from King David in Matthew 1 and Luke 3. Acts of the Apostles 2:34–35 has Peter use the same quote in reference to Jesus. Paul alludes to it in 1 Corinthians 15:25. Paul might also reference it as well in Colossians 3:1 and Romans 8:34 where he mentions &quot;Christ&quot; at the right hand of God. It is also found in Hebrews 1:13.

Jesus condemns the teachers of the law because of their wealth, fancy clothes, and self-importance. &quot;They devour widows&#x27; houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Such men will be punished most severely&quot;. Mark 12:39 refers to &quot;the important seats in the synagogue&quot;, although the setting for Jesus&#x27; teaching is in the temple. Some writers have used this passage to justify antisemitism over the ages but Jesus is obviously criticizing their actions, not religion. The teachers would be analogous to lawyers today, as the Jewish religious code largely was the Jewish law. The scribes interpreted, as judges do today, the meaning of the laws. Often they might feign piety to gain access to trusteeship of a widow&#x27;s estate and therefore its assets, like law firms today seek good reputations for the sole purpose of obtaining rich clients. The fact that Jesus states that they will be &quot;punished&quot;, something which they have done to others, could show how the judges will be judged.

== Widow&#x27;s mite ==

Jesus goes to where people make offerings, throwing donations of money into the Temple treasury, and praises a widow&#x27;s donation, &quot;two very small copper coins, worth only a fraction of a penny&quot;, in preference to the larger donations made by the rich. &quot;I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything—all she had to live on.&quot; She gives two &quot;lepta&quot; or mites, copper coins, the smallest denomination around. Jesus contrasts her offering as the greater sacrifice because it is all she had, as opposed to the offerings of the rich, who only gave what was convenient. Brown &quot;et al.&quot; suggest that her total sacrifice might foreshadow Jesus&#x27; total sacrifice of his life, while Tom Wright reflects that &quot;in the Messiah, Israel&#x27;s God has given himself totally, given all that he had and was&quot;.

Mark uses the term &quot;kodrantēs&quot;, a Greek form of the Latin word &quot;quadrans&quot;, for penny, one of Mark&#x27;s Latinisms which many take as evidence for composition in or near Rome.

==Comparison with other canonical gospels==
Matthew&#x27;s gospel records most of the same content in 21:28–22:46 but with important differences: he adds the parables of the Two Sons and the Marriage of the King&#x27;s Son into Jesus&#x27; discussion with the priests, but does not have Jesus telling the teacher he is not far from God, leaving the man in Matthew looking more hostile to Jesus than he is in Mark. Matthew has Jesus with a much more elaborate discourse condemning his opponents in 23 but no widow&#x27;s offering and Jesus discusses David with the Pharisees, not the crowd.

Luke keeps the same sequence as Mark in 20:9–21:4 but also has slight differences. Jesus tells the parable of the husbandmen to all the people, not just the priests. Unnamed spies from the priests challenge Jesus about the taxes and there is a longer discourse on marriage. Luke does not have Jesus telling the teacher the greatest commandment. John&#x27;s narrative moves from Jesus&#x27; teaching after his arrival in Jerusalem in John 12 to the Last Supper in chapter 13.

==Service history==
&quot;Abner Read&quot; held shakedown along the California coast into April 1943 then got underway with Task Group (TG) 51.2 for the Aleutian Islands. She assumed patrol duties on 4 May 1943 and on 11 May 1943, shelled targets on Japanese-occupied Attu Island, supporting the United States Army&#x27;s 7th Division during the Battle of Attu. &quot;Abner Read&quot; again bombarded Attu on 16 May 1943 before returning to San Diego, California, arriving 31 May 1943.
After two weeks in drydock at San Francisco, &quot;Abner Read&quot; got underway on 14 June 1943 for Adak, Territory of Alaska. Upon her arrival, she joined Task Force (TF) 16 and began patrolling the waters around Japanese-occupied Kiska Island in the Aleutians. On 22 July 1943, as part of Task Group 16.22, she took part in a bombardment of Kiska. Between 12 and 15 August 1943, &quot;Abner Read&quot; shelled Kiska in support of Operation Cottage, in which Allied forces landed on Kiska. On 17 August 1943, the American and Canadian forces discovered that Japan had left the island prior to the Allied invasion.

&quot;Abner Read&quot; had been conducting an antisubmarine patrol off Kiska for two days without any sign of the enemy, steaming in a figure-eight pattern, when, 
while making 5 knots, she was shaken by an explosion aft at 0150 on 18 August. The nearest Japanese minefield was thought to be away, and her crew initially thought a torpedo had struck her; the U.S. Navy later concluded that the destroyer had struck a mine. The concussion tore a huge hole in her stern and set off the ship&#x27;s smoke screen generator, which began to pour toxic smoke over the stern. Men sleeping in aft compartments suffered from smoke inhalation. In the darkness, a few men fell through holes in the deck into fuel oil tanks below.

After remaining attached to the ship by the starboard screw shaft for a few minutes, the stern broke away and sank, taking the ship&#x27;s aft 5&quot;/38 caliber gun with it. About 90 men either went down with the stern or ended up in the water, which was covered with fuel oil. &quot;Abner Read&quot;&#x27;s crew threw flotation devices to the men in the water and launched a rescue boat but the fuel oil created slippery conditions that made rescue difficult, and the cold water killed many men before they could be brought back aboard. About 20 men were pulled from the water, as was the body of a dead crewman. The destroyer lost 70 men killed, one missing and 47 wounded

Disabled and adrift, &quot;Abner Read&quot; was in danger of drifting ashore on Kiska or onto more Japanese mines, but the destroyer arrived on the scene and towed her out of danger. At 0355, &quot;Abner Read&quot; was taken under tow by the tug , which pulled her to Adak for temporary repairs. After a month of repair work in various Alaskan ports, the tug towed her to the Puget Sound Navy Yard at Bremerton, Washington, where she was laid up on keel blocks on 7 October 1943 to receive extensive repair work. The yard work was finished on 21 December 1943 and &quot;Abner Read&quot; commenced training exercises and trials. She moved to Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, in February 1944. While she was underway for Hollandia, New Guinea, her starboard propeller was damaged. This accident required her to put into Milne Bay, New Guinea, on 1 March 1944 for repairs. The ship was then attached to Task Force 75 and participated in the bombardment of Hollandia on 22 April 1944. She took part in naval gunfire support for the landing at Humboldt Bay during Operation Reckless. Her next targets were the Japanese airstrips on Wakde Islands off the coast of Dutch New Guinea, conducted on 30 April 1944. &quot;Abner Read&quot; then moved on to Wewak, New Guinea and on 12 May 1944 to shell Japanese shore batteries which had been hindering the efforts of motor torpedo boats to attack Japanese barge traffic.

&quot;Abner Read&quot; gave fire support for the landings at Arara, New Guinea and shelled the Wakde-Toem area on 17 May 1944. As part of Task Group 77.3, she shelled Biak in the Schouten Islands. On the night of 8–9 June 1944, she was involved in an engagement with an Imperial Japanese Navy task force off the north coast of Biak. &quot;Abner Read&quot; took part in a night bombardment of Wewak on 18 and 19 June 1944. and Noemfoor Island, on 2 July 1944 to cover the allied landings on the island. Following this extended period of action, she retired to Seeadler Harbor for repairs by a destroyer tender.

Getting underway on 8 August 1944, &quot;Abner Read&quot; made a trip to Sydney, Australia, before returning to the Pacific. The destroyer supported the US Army landing on 15 September 1944 at Morotai Island in the Halmahera group. Her next action was a shore bombardment of Ponam Island in the Admiralty Islands on 7 October 1944. On 17 October 1944, she began steaming toward Leyte Gulf entering San Pedro Bay on 20 October 1944, for invasion of Leyte and patrolled off the beachheads in ensuing days.

==Fate==

On 1 November 1944, the Japanese launched air attacks against TG 77.1 who were patrolling lower Leyte Gulf. At around 13:41, an Aichi D3A (reporting name &quot;Val&quot;) dive bomber approached &quot;Abner Read&quot;. Antiaircraft guns blew a wing off the aircraft but its bomb dropped down one of the destroyer&#x27;s stacks and exploded in her aft engine room. The aircraft crashed across the main deck, hitting the 40mm fire director, the aft torpedo tubes, sweeping the port 20mm Oerlikons over the side and setting fire to the aft section. The ship lost water pressure making firefighting impossible and at 13:52, a large internal explosion caused her to list about 10° to starboard and to sink by the stern. At 14:15, &quot;Abner Read&quot; rolled over on her starboard side and sank. Destroyers came to her aid and rescued survivors but 24 members of her crew were lost.

==Discovery of original stern section==
&quot;Abner Read&#x27;s&quot; original stern section lost in the 18 August 1943 mine detonation and aft 5&quot;/38 caliber gun, were discovered on 17 July 2018 by an expedition funded by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and run by Project Recover, a partnership of the University of Delaware, the University of California San Diego&#x27;s Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the BentProp Project. Originally intending to find the wreckage of a B-24 Liberator bomber near Kiska, Project Recover personnel during a two-week expedition to the Kiska area in July 2018 aboard the research ship &quot;Norseman II&quot; decided to look also for &quot;Abner Read&quot;&#x27;s original stern. Using multibeam sonar, they found the stern section – long and high – near where it sank off Kiska, lying on its side on the ocean floor about down. They sent down a camera-equipped remotely operated underwater vehicle, which sent images of the gun, stern section and rudder control to the surface and photographed the wreckage. All of the wreckage was encrusted with corals and other sea life. Project Recover announced the discovery on 15 August 2018. The U.S. Navy&#x27;s Naval History and Heritage Command announced at the time that the Navy regarded the site as a war grave and had no plans to conduct or expectation of conducting recovery operations.

==Honors==
&quot;Abner Read&quot; received four battle stars for her World War II service.

<doc id="763173" wikidata="Q2915591" url="?curid=763173" title="Commonwealth Star">
<text>The Commonwealth Star (also known as the Federation Star, the Seven Point Star, or the Star of Federation) is a seven-pointed star symbolising the Federation of Australia which came into force on 1 January 1901.

Six points of the Star represent the six original states of the Commonwealth of Australia, while the seventh point represents the territories and any other future states of Australia. The original star had only six points; however, the proclamation in 1905 of the Territory of Papua led to the addition of the seventh point in 1909 to represent it and future territories.

The Commonwealth Star is one of the elements of the Australian flag and also features on the Australian coat of arms.

==Usage==
The Commonwealth Star is found on both the flag of Australia and the coat of arms of Australia. On the Australian flag the Star appears in the lower hoist quarter, beneath the Union flag. In the coat of arms, the Star forms the crest, atop a blue and gold wreath. The Star also appears on the badges of the Australian Defence Force and Australian Federal Police. 

The Star is also used on numerous Australian medals, including the National Police Service Medal, the Defence Force Service Medal, the civilian Star of Courage, the Public Service Medal, the Ambulance Service Medal and the Australian Police Medal.

The coat of arms of Queen Mary Donaldson, spouse of King Frederik X of Denmark, includes two Commonwealth Stars, to symbolise the Queen&#x27;s Australian heritage.

<doc id="763178" wikidata="Q21283070" url="?curid=763178" title="Tiberian vocalization">
<text>The Tiberian vocalization, Tiberian pointing, or Tiberian niqqud () is a system of diacritics (&quot;niqqud&quot;) devised by the Masoretes of Tiberias to add to the consonantal text of the Hebrew Bible to produce the Masoretic Text. The system soon became used to vocalize other Hebrew texts as well.

Tiberian vocalization marks vowels and stress, distinguishes consonant quality and length, and serves as punctuation. While the Tiberian system was devised for Tiberian Hebrew, it has become the dominant system for vocalizing all forms of Hebrew. It has long since eclipsed the comparatively rudimentary Babylonian and Palestinian vocalization systems for writing Biblical Hebrew.

==Consonant diacritics==
The sin dot distinguishes between the two values of . A &quot;dagesh&quot; indicates a consonant is geminate or unspirantized, and a &quot;raphe&quot; indicates spirantization. The &quot;mappiq&quot; indicates that is consonantal, not silent, in syllable-coda position.

==Vowel diacritics==
The seven vowel qualities of Tiberian Hebrew are indicated straightforwardly by distinct diacritics:

The diacritics qubutz and shuruq both represent , but shuruq is used when the text uses full spelling (with waw as a mater lectionis). Each of the vowel phonemes could be allophonically lengthened; occasionally, the length is marked with metheg. Metheg also indirectly indicates when a following shva is vocal.

The ultrashort vowels are slightly more complicated. There were two graphemes corresponding to the vowel , attested by alternations in manuscripts like .‎. In addition, one of the graphemes could also be silent:


Shva was used both to indicate lack of a vowel (&quot;quiescent šwa&quot;, &quot;shva naḥ&quot;) and as another symbol to represent the phoneme (&quot;mobile šwa&quot;, &quot;shva naʻ&quot;), the latter also represented by hataf patah. The phoneme had a number of allophones; had to be written with shva rather than hataf patah when it was not pronounced as . Before a laryngeal-pharyngeal, mobile šwa was pronounced as an ultrashort copy of the following vowel ( ) and as preceding , ( ). Using ḥataf vowels was mandatory under gutturals but optional under other letters, and there was considerable variation among manuscripts.

That is referenced specifically by medieval grammarians:
The names of the vowel diacritics are iconic and show some variation:
==Cantillation==
Cantillation signs mark stress and punctuation. Metheg may mark secondary stress, and maqqaf (hyphen) conjoins words into one stress unit, which normally takes only one cantillation mark on the final word in the unit.

<doc id="763186" wikidata="Q1141295" url="?curid=763186" title="Thespiae">
<text>Thespiae ( ; ) was an ancient Greek city (&quot;polis&quot;) in Boeotia. It stood on level ground commanded by the low range of hills which run eastward from the foot of Mount Helicon to Thebes, near modern Thespies.

During the Second Persian invasion of Greece, Thespiae&#x27;s 700 hoplites remained with the Spartans in the Battle of Thermopylae, fighting the Persians and allowing the Greek forces to retreat. It was one of the few Boeotian cities to stay loyal to Greece after the battle. Although Thespian hoplites are popularly depicted with dark cloaks and crescent shields, no evidence supports the historical accuracy of these items. In Ancient Greece, Thespiae rivaled Thebes and survived through the Roman Empire.

==History==
In the history of ancient Greece, Thespiae was one of the cities of the federal league known as the Boeotian League. Several traditions agree that the Boeotians were a people expelled from Thessaly some time after the mythical Trojan War, and who colonised the Boeotian plain over a series of generations, of which the occupation of Thespiae formed a later stage. Other traditions suggest that they were of Mycenean origin. 

===Archaic period===
In the Archaic period, the Thespian nobility was heavily dependent on Thebes. This possibly reflected that land ownership was concentrated in the hands of a small number of nobles, creating difficulty in equipping an effective force of hoplites. Thespiae therefore decided to become a close ally of Thebes. The Thespians destroyed Ascra at some point between 700–650 BCE, and later settled Eutresis between 600–550 BCE. Thespiae also took control over Creusis, Siphae, Thisbe and Chorisae, probably some time in the late sixth century.

The Thessalians invaded Boeotia as far as Thespiae, more than 200 years before Leuctra (according to Plutarch), , which might have given Thespiae the impetus to join the Boeotian League. But elsewhere Plutarch gives a date for the Thessalian invasion as shortly preceding the Second Persian War. Herodotus suggests that Thespiae had been a member of the league as long as Thebes had been. Following the Persian Wars, Thespiae provided two Boeotarchs to the league, rather than one; perhaps one for the city and one for the districts under its control.

=== Persian, Peloponnesian, and Corinthian wars ===
By the time of the Persian invasion of 480 BCE Thespiae&#x27;s ability to field a substantial force of hoplites had changed. Thespiae and Thebes were the only Boeotian cities to send a contingent to fight at Thermopylae, Thespiae sending a force of 700 hoplites who remained to fight beside the Spartans on the final day of the battle. In 1997, the Greek government dedicated a monument to the Thespians who fell alongside that of the Spartans. After the battle, Thebes was the final Boeotian state to side with the Persians, and in doing so they denounced both Plataea and Thespiae to Xerxes I as the only Boeotian states to side with the Greeks. After the city was burned down by Xerxes, the remaining inhabitants furnished a force of 1,800 men for the confederate Greek army that fought at Plataea.

During the Athenian invasion of Boeotia in 424 BCE, the Thespian contingent of the Boeotian army sustained heavy losses at the Battle of Delium. In the next year, the Thebans dismantled the walls of Thespiae on the charge that the Thespians were pro-Athenian, perhaps as a measure to prevent a democratic revolution. In 414 the Thebans aided the Thespians in suppressing a democratic revolution.

In the Corinthian War, Thespiae was initially part of the anti-Spartan alliance. At the Battle of Nemea in 394 BCE, the Thespian contingent fought the Pellenes to a standstill while the rest of the Spartan allies were defeated by the Boeotians. After Nemea, Thespiae became an ally to Sparta and served as staging point for Spartan campaigns in Boeotia throughout the Corinthian War. The city became autonomous as stipulated in the King&#x27;s Peace of 386 BCE which resolved the Corinthian War, and maintained autonomy until 373 BCE. In 373 BCE Thespiae was subdued by the Thebans, the Thespians were exiled from Boeotia and they arrived in Athens along with the Plataeans seeking aid. But they still sent a contingent to fight against the Spartans at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BCE. The Boeotarch Epameinondas allowed the Thespians to withdraw before the battle, along with other Boeotians who nursed a grudge against Thebes. Not long after the battle Thespiae was razed by Thebes and its inhabitants expelled. At some point later the city was restored.

=== Hellenistic period ===
In 335 BCE, the Thespians joined in an alliance with Alexander the Great in destroying Thebes. The famous &quot;hetaera&quot; () Phryne was born at Thespiae in the 4th century BCE, though she seems to have lived at Athens. One of the anecdotes told of her is that she offered to finance the rebuilding of the Theban walls on the condition that the words &quot;Destroyed by Alexander, Restored by Phryne the courtesan&quot; were inscribed upon them.

In the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot;, it is written that on an altar in Thespiae there was a tripod dedicated to the &quot;Zeus the Thunderer&quot; (). The tripod was set up for the Thespiae soldiers who went and fought in Asia, with Alexander the Great, to take revenge for their ancestors.

During the Hellenistic period, Thespiae sought the friendship of the Roman Republic in the war against Mithridates VI. It is subsequently mentioned by Strabo as a place of some size, and by Pliny as a free city, within the Roman Empire, a reward for its support against Mithridates. Thespiae hosted an important group of Roman negotiatores until the refoundation of Corinth in 44 BCE.

Pausanias wrote that Thespians dedicated at Olympia a statue of Pleistaenus (), son of the Eurydamus (), who was the general against the Gauls.

== Mythology ==
Thespiae bore importance in numerous myths, despite not being a major Greek city. Notably, Narcissus was a Thespian youth who, after gazing upon his reflection in a pool, fell in love with himself, leading to his demise. It also appeared in the myth of Heracles, where he helped free it from the Lion of Cithaeron. As a reward, he was granted a night with each of the fifty daughters of king Thespius. 

The town was similarly plagued by a serpent, the Thespian Dragon, to which it sacrificed a youth every year. The Dragon was eventually slain by a man named Menestratus, who, wanting to save his lover Cleostratus, let himself be swallowed while wearing a spiked breastplate.

Mount Helicon, believed to have been created by Pegasus, is found near the city. The Muses often dwelled on the mountain&#x27;s sacred spring Hippocrene.

The name &quot;Thespiae&quot; has contesting mythological origins between King Thespius, the city&#x27;s legendary founder, and Thespia, a Naiad-nymph, abducted by Apollo. She was a daughter of the river god Asopus.

==Ancient religion==
According to Pausanias, the deity most worshipped at Thespiae was Eros, whose primitive image was an unwrought stone. The city contained many works of art, among them the &quot;Eros&quot; of Praxiteles, one of the most famous statues in the ancient world; it drew crowds of people to Thespiae. It was carried off to Rome by Caligula, restored by Claudius, and again carried off by Nero. Another work by Praxiteles associated with Thespiae was an &quot;Aphrodite&quot;, after which the Venus of Arles is thought to have been modeled. There was also a bronze statue of Eros by Lysippos.

The Thespians celebrated the Erotidia () meaning festivals of Eros.

The Thespians also worshipped the Muses, honored by a shrine in the Valley of the Muses and celebrated in a festival in the sacred grove on Mount Helicon.

Clement of Alexandria writes that at Thespiae there was a statue of the Cithaeronian Hera.

==Thespians==
Citizens of Thespiae are called Thespians. The common noun thespian meaning &quot;actor&quot; comes from the legendary first actor named Thespis, and not the city. Both &quot;Thespis&quot; and &quot;Thespiae&quot;, however, are derived from the noun (, meaning &#x27;divine inspiration&#x27;).

* Demophilus of Thespiae – Commander of the Thespian force at the Battle of Thermopylae.
* Phryne – a hetaira. She is best known for her trial for impiety, where she was defended by the orator Hypereides.
* Amphion () – An ancient writer.

==Archaeology==
Remains of what was probably the ancient acropolis consists of an oval line of fortification, while the ground to the east and south are covered with foundations. In 1882, the remains of a communal tomb &quot;(polyandrion)&quot;, including a colossal stone lion, were discovered on the road to Leuctra. The tomb contains both cremated remains, associated with an in-situ pyre, and seven inhumations. The tomb dates from the second half of the 5th century BC, and is usually identified as that of the Thespians who fell at the Battle of Delium in 424 BC. It was excavated by the Greek archaeologist Panagiotis Stamatakis in 1882.

<doc id="763199" wikidata="Q3493080" url="?curid=763199" title="Josiah Whitney">
<text>Josiah Dwight Whitney (November 23, 1819 – August 18, 1896) was an American geologist, professor of geology at Harvard University (from 1865), and chief of the California Geological Survey (1860–1874). Through his travels and studies in the principal mining regions of the United States, Whitney became the foremost authority of his day on the economic geology of the U.S. Mount Whitney, the highest point in the contiguous 48 United States, and the Whitney Glacier, the first confirmed glacier in the United States, on Mount Shasta, were both named after him by members of the Survey.

==Early years==
Whitney was born November 23, 1819, in Northampton, Massachusetts, the oldest of 12 children.
His father was Josiah Dwight Whitney (1786–1869) of the New England Dwight family. His mother was Sarah Williston (1800–1833).
He was the brother of grammarian and lexicographer William Dwight Whitney (1827–1894).
He was educated at a series of schools in Northampton, Plainfield, Round Hill, New Haven and Andover. In 1836, he entered Yale University where he studied chemistry, mineralogy and astronomy.
After graduation in 1839, he continued to study chemistry in Philadelphia, and in 1840 he joined a geologic survey of New Hampshire as an unpaid assistant to Charles T. Jackson.

In 1841, he was preparing to enter Harvard Law School, when he happened to hear a lecture on geology by Charles Lyell.
He decided to change career plans and sailed to Europe in 1842 to continue his studies in science.
For the next five years he traveled through Europe and studied chemistry and geology in France and Germany.

When Whitney returned home in 1847, he and John Wells Foster were hired to assist Charles T. Jackson in making a federal survey of the Lake Superior land district of northern Michigan which was about to become a major copper and iron mining region. When Jackson was dismissed from the survey, Foster and Whitney completed it in 1850 and the final report was published under their names. Building on this experience, Whitney became a mining consultant, and eventually wrote the book, &quot;Metallic Wealth of the United States&quot; (1854). It was considered to be the standard reference for the next 15 years.

During the 1850s, Whitney participated in geological surveys of Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin. He was appointed state chemist and professor in the Iowa State University in 1855, and together with James Hall, he issued reports on Iowa&#x27;s geological survey (1858–1859). In 1858–1860, he took part in the survey of the lead region of the Upper Missouri River, publishing, again with Hall, a report in 1862. The American Philosophical Society elected him to membership in 1863.

==California Geological Survey==
In 1860, he was appointed the state geologist for California and was instructed by the legislature to undertake a comprehensive geologic survey of the state. To carry out the California Geological Survey, he organized an eminent, multi-disciplinary team, including William H. Brewer, James Graham Cooper, William More Gabb, Charles F. Hoffmann, Watson Andrews Goodyear, and Clarence King.
They began a survey that covered not only geology and geography, but also botany, zoology, and paleontology.
Although significant progress was made, Whitney made a tactical error by first publishing two volumes on paleontology when the legislators were clamoring for information about gold. 
Whitney argued that the survey should do more than simply serve as a prospecting party. 
The legislature grew impatient with the scope and pace of the survey work and slowly cut the budget. Whitney tactlessly complained, telling legislators:

In 1867, the survey was eliminated from the budget, and work was suspended in 1868.

Although the California Geological Survey ceased work when funds were eliminated, Whitney managed to retain the title of state geologist until 1874. The survey&#x27;s field work never resumed. In fact, California was left without a geological agency until 1880, when the legislature created the State Mining Bureau, which was empowered—after the legislators&#x27; experience with Whitney—only to address mining issues, and set up with a board of trustees to keep the new agency focused on that narrow purpose. One or two bureau chiefs tried to broaden the scope to include geology, but the bureau was not allowed to hire a geologist until 1928, six decades after the old survey&#x27;s demise.

The state funded the publication and printing of the first three volumes of the survey&#x27;s results, and Whitney published the remaining reports using his own money. In spite of financial difficulties and political problems, the survey was significant not only for its published results, but also because of the men involved, and the survey methods developed – in particular, topographical mapping by triangulation.

Whitney also wrote &quot;The Yosemite Book&quot; (1869), which was essentially a travel guide to Yosemite Valley and the surrounding area. In this work he advocated the protection of Yosemite, and was one of the first to propose creation of a national park.

==Controversies==
While in California, Whitney became embroiled in three notable controversies:

===Yosemite Valley origins===
First, Whitney maintained that Yosemite Valley was created by a cataclysmic sinking of the valley floor. However, John Muir, who was exploring the Yosemite area during the same time, argued that the valley was carved by glacial action. Whitney derided Muir as an &quot;ignoramus&quot; and a &quot;mere sheepherder.&quot; Whitney&#x27;s survey reports suppressed evidence of glaciers, and he never abandoned his viewpoint. Most scientists eventually dismissed Whitney&#x27;s hypothesis and accepted Muir&#x27;s.

===Calaveras Skull===
The second controversy involved the discovery of the Calaveras Skull, allegedly uncovered by a miner beneath the surface of the earth. Eventually the skull made its way into the possession of Whitney, who quickly pronounced it genuine and concluded that it came from the Pliocene era (5.3 mya – 1.8 mya). However, others assert that the skull is much younger, as little as 1,000 years.

===Dispute with Benjamin Silliman Jr.===
The third controversy involved the dispute over California&#x27;s potential oil wealth with Yale Professor Benjamin Silliman Jr. After conducting a small-scale survey of surface seeps of petroleum in Ventura County, Silliman claimed that California possessed &quot;fabulous wealth in the best of oil&quot;. Whitney vehemently contested this claim, and accused Silliman of self-interested speculation aimed at prospective investors. Whitney devoted much of his time and energy to personally attacking and discrediting Silliman, whose reputation was severely tarnished over the course of the public debate between the two. But Silliman was ultimately vindicated – first in 1874 when the first major California oil strike occurred, and then in subsequent decades when California went on to produce 80 million barrels per year by 1910 – forty percent of total U.S. domestic oil production.

==Later life==
In 1865, Whitney was appointed to the Harvard faculty in order to found a school of mines. He was allowed an indefinite leave of absence to complete his work in California. When the survey work was definitively ended in 1874, Whitney returned to Harvard and opened the school of mines, which was quickly merged a year later into the Lawrence Scientific School. He held his position as professor of geology for the rest of his life.

Whitney married Louisa Goddard (born in Manchester, England, December 17, 1819; died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, May 13, 1882) on July 5, 1854. She wrote &quot;The Burning of the Convent: a Narrative of the Destruction of the Ursuline School on Mount Benedict, Charlestown, by One of the Pupils&quot; (Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1877), and &quot;Peasy&#x27;s Childhood: an Autobiography&quot; (1878). Their daughter Eleanor Goddard Whitney was born on November 29, 1856.
Whitney named Lake Eleanor in Yosemite National Park for his daughter, who died in 1882.
Josiah Whitney died at Lake Sunapee, New Hampshire, on August 18, 1896.

<text>Type X (XB) U-boats were a special type of German submarine (U-boat). Although intended as long-range mine-layers, they were later used as long-range merchant submarines, a task they shared with the Type IXD and Italian &quot;Romolo&quot;-class submarines.

==History==
The Type X was originally designed specifically to accommodate the newly developed &quot;Schachtmine A&quot; (SMA) moored mine. The initial design provided dry storage for the mines, which needed their detonators to be individually adjusted before launch; this submarine was projected to have displaced up to 2,500 tonnes. A further variant, the Type XA was projected, which would have supplemented the main mine chamber with extra mine shafts in the saddle tanks. Neither type entered production.

A total of eight Type XB boats were produced, which replaced the mine chamber of the projected Type XA with six vertical wet storage shafts in the forward section of the hull. Up to 18 mines could be carried in these shafts, with an additional 48 mines in a series of 12 shafts set into the saddle tanks on each side. They only had two torpedo tubes, both at the stern. When used as cargo-carrying submarines they carried freight containers in the mine shafts (or had the freight containers welded on top of the lateral shafts, preventing their use for mines).

The first Type XB was launched in May 1941. At 2,710 tonnes submerged and fully loaded, they were the largest German U-boats ever built, and they had to sacrifice diving speed and agility.

==Service history==
Six of the eight boats built were sunk during the war (four with all hands) but two survived World War II. One survivor was , which surrendered to US Navy ships on 14 May 1945 while en route for Japan with a cargo that included 560 kg uranium oxide, two Me 262 jet fighters, and 10 jet engines.

The other type XB to survive was which reached Batavia (present-day Jakarta) in December 1944 with a cargo including dismantled V-2 rockets for Japan. Following Germany&#x27;s surrender, &quot;U-219&quot; was seized by the Japanese at Batavia on 8 May 1945 and on 15 July 1945 was placed into service with the Imperial Japanese Navy as &quot;I-505&quot;.

<text>Jacques Claude, comte Beugnot (; 25 July 1761 – 24 June 1835) was a French politician before, during, and after the French Revolution. His son Auguste Arthur Beugnot was an historian and scholar.

==Biography==

===Revolution===
Born at Bar-sur-Aube (Aube), he served as a magistrate under the &quot;ancien régime&quot;, and was elected deputy to the Legislative Assembly (1791). A Feuillant and later a Girondist, he was proscribed along with the Girondists after François Hanriot&#x27;s intervention and the trial of October 1793, and was imprisoned in the Conciergerie until the Thermidorian Reaction.

===Napoleon===
He next entered into relations with the family of Napoleon Bonaparte, and in 1799, after the coup of 18 Brumaire, again entered politics, becoming successively &quot;préfet&quot; of the Seine-Inférieure &quot;département&quot;, member of the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;État&quot;, and finance minister to Jérôme Bonaparte, King of Westphalia, during the First French Empire. 

In 1808 Beugnot, who had meanwhile been appointed administrator of the Grand Duchy of Berg-Cleves, received the cross of an &quot;Officier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; with the title of count. He returned to France in 1813, after the battle of Leipzig, and was made prefect of the &quot;département&quot; of Nord.

===Bourbons===
In 1814, he was a member of the provisional government as Minister of the Interior, and rallied to the House of Bourbon. King Louis XVIII named him director-general of police and afterwards Naval Minister. He followed Louis to Ghent during the Hundred Days, became one of his confidants, and contributed to draw up Louis&#x27;s Charter. He claimed (in his &quot;Mémoires&quot;) to have also furnished the text of the proclamation addressed by the king to the French people before his return to France - but it is known now that it was another text that was adopted.

After the full Bourbon Restoration, lacking the support of the Ultra-royalists, he was given the title of Minister of State without portfolio, which was equivalent to a retirement. Elected deputy, he attached himself to the moderate party, and defended the liberty of the press. In 1830, he was made a Peer of France by Charles X, and confirmed by Louis-Philippe after the July Revolution, becoming and director-general of manufactures and commerce.

<doc id="763205" wikidata="Q747547" url="?curid=763205" title="Canaanite languages">
<text>The Canaanite languages, sometimes referred to as Canaanite dialects, are one of four subgroups of the Northwest Semitic languages. The others are Aramaic and the now-extinct Ugaritic and Amorite language. These closely related languages originated in the Levant and Upper Mesopotamia. Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples spoke them in an area encompassing what is today Israel, Palestine, Jordan, the Sinai Peninsula, Lebanon, Syria, as well as some areas of southwestern Turkey, Iraq, and the northwestern corner of Saudi Arabia. From the 9th century BCE, they also spread to the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa in the form of Phoenician.

The Canaanites are broadly defined to include the Hebrews (including Israelites, Judeans, and Samaritans), Ammonites, Edomites, Ekronites, Hyksos, Phoenicians (including the Punics/Carthaginians), Moabites, Suteans and sometimes the Ugarites and Amorites.

The Canaanite languages continued to be spoken languages until at least the 5th century but were gradually supplanted by Aramaic. Modern Hebrew is the only living Canaanite language today and was revived in the 19th century by political and cultural activists as an everyday spoken language in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This was achieved mainly through the revitalization and cultivation efforts of Zionists throughout Europe and in Palestine. By the mid-20th century, Modern Hebrew had become the primary language of Palestinian Jews and was later made the official language of the State of Israel.

Many Jews used Mishnaic Hebrew well into the Middle Ages and up to the present day as both a liturgical and literary language, and they also employed it as for commerce between disparate diasporic communities. Samaritan Hebrew remained a liturgical language among Samaritans.

== Classification ==

Analogous to the Romance languages, the Canaanite languages operate on a spectrum of mutual intelligibility with one another, with significant overlap occurring in syntax, morphology, phonology, and semantics. This family of languages also has the distinction of being the first historically attested group of languages to use an alphabet, derived from the Proto-Canaanite alphabet, to record their writings, as opposed to the far earlier Cuneiform logographic/syllabic writing of the region, which originated in Mesopotamia and was used to record Sumerian, Akkadian, Eblaite, Elamite, Hurrian and Hittite.

They are heavily attested in Canaanite inscriptions throughout the Levant, Mesopotamia, Anatolia and the Eastern Mediterranean, and after the founding of Carthage by Phoenician colonists, in coastal regions of North Africa and Iberian Peninsula also. Dialects have been labelled primarily with reference to Biblical geography: Hebrew (Israelian, Judean/Biblical, Samaritan), Phoenician/Punic, Amorite, Ammonite, Moabite, Sutean and Edomite; the dialects were all mutually intelligible, being no more differentiated than geographical varieties of Modern English.

The Canaanite languages or dialects can be split into the following:

===North Canaan===
* Philistine – attested by several dozen inscriptions in Phoenician script scattered along Israel&#x27;s southwest coast, in particular the Ekron Royal Dedicatory Inscription. It is noted as being similar to Phoenician, in particular the Byblian dialect.
* Phoenician – The main sources are the Ahiram sarcophagus inscription, the sarcophagus of Eshmunazar II, the Tabnit sarcophagus, the Kilamuwa Stela, the Cippi of Melqart, and the other Byblian royal inscriptions. There were two main dialects of Phoenician, with Byblian being confined to Byblos, and Tyro-Sidonian being spread as Phoenician settlements were founded along the Mediterranean. Tyro-Sidonian is further split into eastern and western dialects, the latter being that from which the Punic language would emerge. For later Punic: in Plautus&#x27; play &quot;Poenulus&quot; at the beginning of the fifth act.

===South Canaan===
* Ammonite – an extinct Canaanite dialect of the Ammonite people mentioned in the Bible. The main sources are the Amman Citadel Inscription and Tel Siran inscription.
* Edomite – an extinct Canaanite dialect of the Edomite people mentioned in the Bible and Egyptian texts.
* Hebrew – the only Canaanite language that is a living language, and the most successful example of a revived dead language.
* Moabite – an extinct Canaanite dialect of the Moabite people mentioned in the Bible. The main sources are the Mesha Stele and El-Kerak Stela.

===Other===
Other possible Canaanite languages:
* Ugaritic is possibly also a Northwest Semitic language, but likely not Canaanitic.
* The Deir Alla inscription, written in a dialect with Aramaic and South Canaanitic characteristics, which is classified as Canaanite in Hetzron.
* Sutean, a Semitic language, possibly of the Canaanite branch.
* Amarna Canaanite – attested only through the Canaano-Akkadian language of the Amarna letters. Hetzron notes that it has distinctive features that mark it as a separate language from the other Canaanite dialects rather than a direct ancestor to any of them.
* In 2022, two large, 3,800-year-old, Amorite-Akkadian bilingual tablets were published, yielding a large corpus of Northwest Semitic. The Amorite text is notably very similar to other Canaanite languages. Until then, Amorite was only known from personal names attested in Akkadian texts and its position within Northern Semitic languages was vague.

==Comparison to Aramaic==

Some distinctive typological features of Canaanite in relation to the still spoken Aramaic are:
*The prefix &quot;h-&quot; is the definite article (Aramaic has a postfixed &quot;-a&quot;), which seems to be an innovation of Canaanite.
*The first person pronoun is &quot;ʼnk&quot; ( &quot;anok(i)&quot;, which is similar to Akkadian, Ancient Egyptian and Berber, versus Aramaic &quot;ʾnʾ/ʾny&quot;.
*The change of *&quot;ā&quot; &gt; &quot;ō&quot;, called the Canaanite shift.

==Descendants==

Modern Hebrew, revived in the modern era from an extinct dialect of the ancient Israelites preserved in literature, poetry, liturgy; also known as Classical Hebrew, the oldest form of the language attested in writing. The original pronunciation of Biblical Hebrew is accessible only through reconstruction. It may also include Samaritan Hebrew, a variety formerly spoken by the Samaritans. The main sources of Classical Hebrew are the Hebrew Bible and inscriptions such as the Gezer calendar and Khirbet Qeiyafa pottery shard. All of the other Canaanite languages seem to have become extinct by the early first millennium AD except Punic, which survived into late antiquity (or possibly even longer).

Slightly varying forms of Hebrew preserved from the first millennium BC until modern times include:
*Tiberian Hebrew – Masoretic scholars living in the Jewish community of Tiberias in Palestine c. 750–950.
*Mizrahi Hebrew – Mizrahi Jews, liturgical
*Yemenite Hebrew – Yemenite Jews, liturgical
*Sephardi Hebrew – Sephardi Jews, liturgical
*Ashkenazi Hebrew – Ashkenazi Jews, liturgical
*Mishnaic Hebrew – Jews, liturgical, rabbinical, any of the Hebrew dialects found in the Talmud.
*Medieval Hebrew – Jews, liturgical, poetical, rabbinical, scientific, literary; lingua franca based on the Bible, Mishnah, and neologisms created by translators and commentators
*Haskalah Hebrew – Jews, scientific, literary and journalistic language based on Biblical but enriched with neologisms created by writers and journalists, a transition to the later
*Modern Hebrew used in Israel today
*Samaritan Hebrew – Samaritans, liturgical

The Phoenician and Punic expansion spread the Phoenician language and the Punic variety spoken in the antique-era colonies in Western Mediterranean for a time, but there too it died out, although it seems to have survived longer than in Phoenicia itself.

==Sources==
The primary modern reference book for the many extra-biblical Canaanite inscriptions, together with Aramaic inscriptions, is the German-language book &quot;Kanaanäische und Aramäische Inschriften&quot;, from which inscriptions are often referenced as KAI &quot;n&quot; (for a number &quot;n&quot;).

<doc id="763211" wikidata="Q4571853" url="?curid=763211" title="1965 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1965 Atlantic hurricane season was the first to use the modern-day bounds for an Atlantic hurricane season, which are June 1 to November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. It was a slightly below average season, with 10 tropical cyclones developing and reaching tropical storm intensity. Four of the storms strengthened into hurricanes. One system reached major hurricane intensity – Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. The first system, an unnamed tropical storm, developed during the month of June in the southern Gulf of Mexico. The storm moved northward across Central America, but caused no known impact in the region. It struck the Florida Panhandle and caused minor impact across much of the Southern United States. Tropical cyclogenesis halted for over two months, until Anna formed on August 21. The storm remained well away from land in the far North Atlantic Ocean and caused no impact.

Hurricane Betsy was the strongest and most devastating storm of the season. Extensive damage from Betsy was reported in the Bahamas, Florida, and Louisiana, particularly the New Orleans area. It was the first hurricane in the history of the United States to result in at least $1 billion (1965 USD) in losses. Hurricane Carol meandered in the eastern Atlantic for over two weeks from mid-September to very early October. Impact on land from Carol was minimal. In late September, Tropical Storm Debbie developed in the northwestern Caribbean and moved slowly across the region, before later reaching the Gulf of Mexico. The storm dissipated just offshore of Louisiana, which resulted in only minor impact along the Gulf Coast of the United States. The final tropical cyclone, Hurricane Elena, formed on October 12. Elena remained at sea for nearly a week and caused no damage on land. Collectively, the storms of the 1965 Atlantic hurricane season caused 76 fatalities and $1.68 billion in damage, almost entirely due to Hurricane Betsy.

== Season summary ==
This was the first Atlantic hurricane season to start on June 1 and end on November 30, which is the modern-day season bounds. A total of 13 tropical depressions formed. Ten of those tropical depression intensified into a tropical storm, which was just slightly below the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s 1950–2005 average of 11. Four of those tropical storms attained hurricane status, slightly below the average of six. One hurricane intensified into a major hurricane, which is Category 3 or greater on the Saffir–Simpson scale. This was slightly below the average of two per season. Overall, the tropical cyclones of this season collectively caused about $1.68 billion in damage and 76 deaths.

Season activity began with the formation of an unnamed tropical storm over the southern Gulf of Mexico on June 13. There were no other tropical storms in the Atlantic basin until the latter part of August, when hurricanes Anna and Betsy formed. The latter developed on August 27 and eventually became the most intense tropical cyclone of the 1965 season, peaking as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of on September 2.

While Betsy would mostly exist in September, the month also featured four additional tropical cyclones – an unnamed tropical storm, Hurricane Carol, a tropical depression, and then Debbie. In October, three tropical systems formed, including two unnamed tropical storms and Hurricane Elena. The final tropical cyclone of the 1965 season, an unnamed tropical storm, developed from a previously non-tropical cyclone northeast of the Lesser Antilles on November 29. The storm persisted into the month of December, before dissipating on December 2.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 88, which was below the 1950–2005 average of 93.2. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical cyclones with winds exceeding , which is tropical storm strength.

== Systems ==

=== June tropical storm ===

A cut-off low-pressure area developed from a shear trough in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico on June 9. The low caused the detachment of a disturbance from the Intertropical Convergence Zone, which was located near the south coast of Guatemala. After moving across Guatemala and Mexico, the low emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on June 13. The low intensified on the following day, reaching tropical storm status at 0600 UTC. It likely was a subtropical storm, however, the lack of consistent satellite data precludes such a classification. Operationally, the system was considered a tropical depression for its entire duration, thus, this went unnamed. The storm began curving northeastward, and by early on June 15, it peaked with winds of .

At 1100 UTC on June 15, the storm made landfall near Santa Rosa Beach, Florida, at the same intensity. Inland, the storm continued northeastward and became extratropical over South Carolina at 0000 UTC on June 16. Tides along the coast of the Florida Panhandle were above normal. The storm brought sustained winds of 50 to 60 mph (85 to 105 km/h) with gusts up to at Alligator Point. Winds blew the roof off of two beach cottages on St. George Island, while tides sank or washed ashore several small boats. The storm also produced rainfall up to in Wewahitchka. Slick roads in Tallahassee resulted in several car accidents, but no injuries occurred. The rains also left street flooding in the Inglewood neighborhood of Tallahassee, forcing the evacuation of two families. Two tornadoes were spawned in Florida, with one damaging houses and a mobile home in Live Oak. The storm also brought rainfall to several other states.
=== Hurricane Anna ===

A weak circulation was noted by Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) near Cape Verde on August 16. During the next five days, the system tracked west-northwestward or northwestward, while conditions gradually became favorable for tropical cyclogenesis. At 0600 UTC on August 21, it is estimated that the system became Tropical Storm Anna. While Anna was tracking north-northeastward on August 23, an eye feature appeared on TIROS. After another aircraft reported an eye on its radar, Anna was upgraded to a hurricane later that day. Early on August 24, Anna reached maximum sustained winds of while accelerating northeastward. Anna began losing tropical characteristics, and early on the following day, it transitioned into an extratropical storm while about halfway between the Azores and Greenland.
=== Hurricane Betsy ===
A tropical disturbance developed into a tropical depression on August 27, while well east of the Windward Islands. It tracked generally west-northward until crossing the Leeward Islands on August 28. Early the next day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Betsy, shortly before striking Saint Martin and Anguilla. Betsy continued to intensify after re-emerging into the western Atlantic, becoming a hurricane on September 1. After executing a brief cyclonic loop, the storm then turned to the west. Later on September 1 and into September 2, Betsy rapidly intensified and peaked as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of on September 2. However, the storm fell back to Category 3 intensity early the next day. By September 5, Betsy executed another cyclonic loop northeast of the Bahamas and fell to as low as Category 1 intensity around 0000 UTC on September 6. The storm fluctuated between Category 2 and 3 as it headed southwestward and then westward over the next day, passing over or close to several Bahamian islands, including Great Abaco and Andros. The storm produced very strong winds and rough seas in the Bahamas, with a peak wind gust of at Hope Town. Betsy caused one fatality and approximately $14 million in damage in the island chain, mostly to agriculture and crops.

By early on September 8, Betsy made landfall near Tavernier, Florida, as a Category 3 hurricane. In South Florida, the storm brought strong winds and significant storm surge. Water reached several feet in height in upper Florida Keys, inundating highways and the first floor of buildings. Nearly all of the land south of Homestead Air Force Base and east of U.S. Route 1 was covered by water. There were 8 deaths and $120 million in losses, which included both property and agriculture. Betsy entered into the Gulf of Mexico later on September 8 and re-strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane on September 10, reaching a secondary peak with winds of . However, further intensification was halted after Betsy made landfall in Grand Isle, Louisiana, around 0400 UTC. In Louisiana, strong winds and rough seas caused extensive damage. Storm surge inundated the levees in New Orleans, flooding much of the city. Throughout the state, more than 22,000 homes were either damaged or destroyed, and 168,000 people were left without electricity. The storm caused more than 17,000 injuries and resulted in 58 deaths. Damage in the state of Louisiana reached $1.2 billion. Once inland, the storm turned northeastward and rapidly weakened, becoming extratropical over Tennessee on September 11. Impact in other states ranged from minor to moderate. Overall, Betsy caused about $1.43 billion in damage and 76 fatalities. Betsy was the first hurricane in the United States to cause at least $1 billion in damage.
=== Early September tropical storm ===

A cold front moved eastward from North America into the western Atlantic Ocean on August 28. An extratropical low developed on August 31 over the north Atlantic, which degenerated into a trough three days later. On September 4, another extratropical storm developed, located about 800 mi (1,285 km) south of Newfoundland. The system attained gale-force winds a day later, and turned westward on September 6, steered by a building ridge to the north. On September 7, the storm transitioned into a tropical storm, after its wind field became more symmetrical. Later that day, the storm attain winds of , recorded by nearby ships. The storm turned to the east and northeast, crossing over its former path. On September 10, the tropical storm again transitioned into an extratropical storm, which later passed southeast of Newfoundland. The storm moved across the northern Atlantic Ocean, dissipating on September 13 southwest of Ireland.
=== Hurricane Carol ===

A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on September 15, and developed into a tropical depression by early on the following day. It headed steadily westward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Carol late on September 17. The storm began curving northwestward by the following day. Operationally, advisories were not initiated until 1900 UTC on September 19, after winds had already reached . Carol then slowed and began turning north-northward. Later on September 20, a Navy reconnaissance flight confirmed a circulation and also measured hurricane-force winds. Thus, Carol was upgraded to a hurricane at 1800 UTC on September 20.

On September 21, another flight into the storm recorded a minimum pressure of , the lowest in relation to Carol. The hurricane accelerated, before slowing in forward motion on September 22. Between September 24 and September 28, the storm drifted and executed a small cyclonic loop and fluctuating from tropical storm status to Category 1 intensity and back to tropical storm strengthen during that time. After turning northeastward, Carol re-intensified into a hurricane on September 25. While passing northwest of the Azores, a weather station on Corvo Island reported a sustained wind speed of and a gust up to . The storm curved east-southeastward, weakened, and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while located north of the Azores on September 30. The remnants of Carol turned southeastward and then southward before dissipating near the Canary Islands on October 3.
=== Tropical Storm Debbie ===
A low-pressure area in the northwestern Caribbean Sea developed into a tropical depression on September 24. The depression brought locally heavy rainfall to areas of Honduras while tracking northwestward. Despite winds of only , the Miami Weather Bureau prematurely named the depression &quot;Debbie&quot; at 1600 UTC on September 25. Several hours later, Debbie struck the northeastern Yucatán Peninsula. After emerging into the Gulf of Mexico early on September 26, the storm was described as &quot;weaker than before&quot;, as the convective activity indicated no organization. However, Debbie began to strengthen, reaching tropical storm status late on September 27.

After peaked at winds of late on September 28, cooler and drier air caused the storm to weaken. Debbie was a minimal tropical storm by September 29 and made landfall in Port Fourchon, Louisiana, with winds of at 2000 UTC. The storm quickly weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated by early the next day. Despite weakening significantly before landfall, Debbie brought heavy precipitation, especially in Mobile, Alabama, where a 24-hour rainfall record was broken after fell. Within the city of Mobile, hundreds of cars were flooded, while more than 200 people fled their inundated homes. Many roads and businesses were also closed in the area. Damage in Mobile alone reached $25 million. Rainfall was reported in seven other states, though no significant impact occurred.
=== Late September tropical storm ===

On September 25, a cold front emerged into the western Atlantic Ocean and stalled. An extratropical storm developed along the front on September 29 to the southeast of the Carolinas. The storm moved quickly east-northeastward and quickly intensified to near hurricane intensity. On September 30, the storm passed north of Bermuda, producing winds of there. On October 1, the system reversed its track, weakened slightly, and became more symmetric. By October 2, the strongest winds were located near the circulation center, based on nearby ship reports. Based on the observations, the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project estimated that the system transitioned into a tropical storm on this day, although the storm could have been a subtropical cyclone. Around that time, maximum sustained winds were estimated at . The storm moved to the north and northeast ahead of a cold front. On October 3, the front absorbed the storm.
=== Hurricane Elena ===

TIROS imagery indicated a very weak circulation near 12°N, 40°W on October 11. Ship reports on the following day indicated a somewhat more organized circulation. As a result, it is estimated that the final tropical depression of the season at 1200 UTC on October 12, while located about midway between Cape Verde and the Leeward Islands. Initially, the depression remained disorganized while tracking northwestward. However, by early on October 14, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Elena. The storm continued to intensify as it headed northwestward, before turning to the northeast late on October 16. Elena became a Category 1 hurricane at 1200 UTC on October 17 and then reached Category 2 status early the next day. Around 1200 UTC, Elena attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . At 0600 UTC on October 19, the storm merged with an approaching cold front near the Azores. The remnants moved rapidly north-northeastward until dissipating near Iceland on October 20.
=== October tropical storm ===

A trough persisted along the southeastern United States on October 15. A day later, a tropical depression formed along the trough near the northwestern Bahamas. The system quickly intensified into a tropical storm; due to its large circulation, the storm was potentially a subtropical cyclone. The storm moved in a counterclockwise direction – southeast at first, and eventually curving to the west-southwest. On October 18, the hurricane hunters flight reported maximum sustained winds of . At 15:00 UTC that day, the storm made landfall at peak intensity near Flagler Beach, Florida. It quickly weakened while crossing the state, and dissipated the next day in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The storm, in conjunction with a high-pressure system over New England, produced gale-force winds in the Carolinas.

The precursor trough associated with this cyclone dropped heavy rainfall over the Miami metropolitan area. The Bahia Mar marina in Fort Lauderdale recorded of precipitation, while at least of rain fell in a roughly triangular-shaped area bounded by Loxahatchee, West Palm Beach, and Hollywood. Floodwaters inundated and damaged many roads throughout southeast Florida. An estimated 75% of crops in eastern Palm Beach County were lost, equivalent to approximately $4.5 million in damage. After the system became a tropical storm and approached the coast of Florida, storm gale warnings were issued from Cape Kennedy, Florida, to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Wind gusts close to were recorded near Jacksonville. The storm caused several power outages in the Jacksonville area but left little damage. 
=== November tropical storm ===

A cold front exited the east coast of the United States on November 22, and moved eastward. An extratropical storm developed along the front on November 26, located northeast of the Lesser Antilles. The storm moved northeastward, executed a small loop, and strengthened slightly. Gradually, the storm&#x27;s structure became more symmetrical, and by November 29, the system transitioned into a tropical storm. At that time, the storm had peak winds of , and was moving southward. On December 1, the storm weakened into a tropical depression, and on the same day, the track shifted to the west. On December 2, the depression dissipated.
==Other systems==
A trough of low pressure reached the central Gulf of Mexico by June 10. The trough spawned a low-pressure area, which became a tropical depression on June 11. The depression moved northwestward and struck Mississippi before dissipating on the following day.

A tropical wave approached the Leeward Islands on August 6. Two days later, a ship just east of the islands reported winds of about away from the center of the tropical wave, indicating the presence of a closed circulation, and thus, a tropical depression formed. The depression emerged into the eastern Caribbean and then quickly dissipated.

On September 21, an extratropical low-pressure area developed at the tail-end of a cold front over the west-central Atlantic. The low gradually lost frontal characteristics and acquired a more symmetrical structure, becoming a tropical depression just north of Bermuda on September 24. Curving northeastward, the depression transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 26 and a different cold front absorbed it by the next day.

== Storm names ==
The following list of names was used for named storms (tropical storms and hurricanes) that formed in the North Atlantic in 1965. This was the same list used for the 1961 season, except for &quot;Carol&quot;, &quot;Elena&quot;, and &quot;Holly&quot;, which replaced &quot;Carla&quot;, &quot;Esther&quot; and &quot;Hattie&quot;, respectively. A storm was named &quot;Elena&quot; for the first time in 1965.

=== Retirement ===

The name &quot;Betsy&quot; was retired following the season due to the storm&#x27;s extent and severity of impacts. Also, the name &quot;Carol&quot;, used after a 10-year hiatus from the naming list on account of Hurricane Carol in 1954, was permanently retired in the spring of 1969. They were replaced with &quot;Blanche&quot; and &quot;Camille&quot; for use in the 1969 season.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1965 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1965 USD.

<doc id="763213" wikidata="Q1982248" url="?curid=763213" title="Biblical Hebrew">
<text>Biblical Hebrew ( or ), also called Classical Hebrew, is an archaic form of the Hebrew language, a language in the Canaanitic branch of the Semitic languages spoken by the Israelites in the area known as the Land of Israel, roughly west of the Jordan River and east of the Mediterranean Sea. The term &#x27;Hebrew&#x27; was not used for the language in the Hebrew Bible, which was referred to as &#x27;language of Canaan&#x27; or &#x27;Judean&#x27;, but it was used in Koine Greek and Mishnaic Hebrew texts. The Hebrew language is attested in inscriptions from about the 10th century BCE, when it was almost identical to Phoenician and other Canaanite languages, and spoken Hebrew persisted through and beyond the Second Temple period, which ended in 70 CE with the siege of Jerusalem. It eventually developed into Mishnaic Hebrew, which was spoken until the 5th century.

The language of the Hebrew Bible reflects various stages of the Hebrew language in its consonantal skeleton, as well as a vocalization system which was added in the Middle Ages by the Masoretes. There is also some evidence of regional dialectal variation, including differences between Biblical Hebrew as spoken in the northern Kingdom of Israel and in the southern Kingdom of Judah. The consonantal text called the Masoretic Text was transmitted in manuscript form and underwent redaction in the Second Temple period, but its earliest portions (parts of Amos, Isaiah, Hosea and Micah) can be dated to the late 8th to early 7th centuries BCE.

Biblical Hebrew has several different writing systems. From around the 12th century BCE until the 6th century BCE, writers employed the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet. This was retained by the Samaritans, who use the descendent Samaritan script to this day. However, the Imperial Aramaic alphabet gradually displaced the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet after the Babylonian captivity, and it became the source for the current Hebrew alphabet. These scripts lack letters to represent all of the sounds of Biblical Hebrew, although these sounds are reflected in Greek and Latin transcriptions/translations of the time. They initially indicated only consonants, but certain letters, known by the Latin term , became increasingly used to mark vowels. In the Middle Ages, various systems of diacritics were developed to mark the vowels in Hebrew manuscripts; of these, only the Tiberian vocalization is still widely used.

Biblical Hebrew possessed a series of emphatic consonants whose precise articulation (pronunciation) is disputed, likely ejective or pharyngealized. Earlier Biblical Hebrew possessed three consonants not distinguished in writing and later merged with other consonants. The stop consonants developed fricative allophones under the influence of Aramaic, and these sounds eventually became marginally phonemic. The pharyngeal and glottal consonants underwent weakening in some regional dialects, as reflected in the modern Samaritan Hebrew reading tradition. The vowel system of Biblical Hebrew changed over time and is reflected differently in the ancient Greek and Latin transcriptions, medieval vocalization systems, and modern reading traditions. It had a typical Semitic morphology with nonconcatenative morphology, arranging Semitic roots into patterns to form words. Biblical Hebrew distinguished two genders (masculine, feminine), and three numbers (singular, plural, and uncommonly, dual). Verbs were marked for voice and mood, and had two conjugations which may have indicated aspect or tense. The tense or aspect of verbs was also influenced by the conjunction , in the waw-consecutive construction. Unlike modern Hebrew, the default word order for biblical Hebrew was verb–subject–object, and verbs were inflected for the number, gender, and person of their subject. Pronominal suffixes could be appended to verbs (to indicate object) or nouns (to indicate possession), and nouns had special construct states for use in possessive constructions.

== Nomenclature ==
The earliest written sources refer to Biblical Hebrew as &#x27;the language of Canaan&#x27;. The Hebrew Bible also calls the language &#x27;Judaean, Judahite&#x27; In the Hellenistic period, Greek writings use the names &quot;Hebraios&quot;, &quot;Hebraïsti&quot; and in Mishnaic Hebrew we find &#x27;Hebrew&#x27; and &#x27;Hebrew language&#x27;. The origin of this term is obscure; suggested origins include the biblical Eber, the ethnonyms ʿApiru, Ḫabiru, and Ḫapiru found in sources from Egypt and the Near East, and a derivation from the root &#x27;to pass&#x27;, alluding to crossing over the Jordan River. Jews also began referring to Hebrew as &#x27;the Holy Tongue&#x27; in Mishnaic Hebrew.

The term &quot;Classical Hebrew&quot; may include all pre-medieval dialects of Hebrew, including Mishnaic Hebrew, or it may be limited to Hebrew contemporaneous with the Hebrew Bible. The term &quot;Biblical Hebrew&quot; refers to pre-Mishnaic dialects (sometimes excluding Dead Sea Scroll Hebrew); it may or may not include extra-biblical texts, such as inscriptions (e.g. the Siloam inscription), and generally also includes later vocalization traditions for the Hebrew Bible&#x27;s consonantal text, most commonly the early medieval Tiberian vocalization.

== History ==

The archeological record for the prehistory of Biblical Hebrew is far more complete than the record of Biblical Hebrew itself. Early Northwest Semitic (ENWS) materials are attested from 2350 BCE to 1200 BCE, the end of the Bronze Age. The Northwest Semitic languages, including Hebrew, differentiated noticeably during the Iron Age (1200–540 BCE), although in its earliest stages Biblical Hebrew was not highly differentiated from Ugaritic and the Canaanite of the Amarna letters.

Hebrew developed during the latter half of the second millennium BCE between the Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea, an area known as Canaan. The Deuteronomic history says the Israelites established a unified kingdom in Canaan at the beginning of the first millennium BCE, which later split into the kingdom of Israel in the north and the kingdom of Judah in the south after a disputed succession.

In 722 BCE, the Neo-Assyrian Empire destroyed Israel and some members of the upper class escaped to Judah. In 586 BCE, the Neo-Babylonian Empire destroyed Judah. The Judahite upper classes were exiled and Solomon&#x27;s Temple was destroyed. Later, the Achaemenid Empire made Judah a province, Yehud Medinata, and permitted the Judahite exiles to return and rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. According to the &quot;Gemara&quot;, Hebrew of this period was similar to Imperial Aramaic; Hanina bar Hama said that God sent the exiled Jews to Babylon because &quot;[the Babylonian] language is akin to the &quot;Leshon Hakodesh&quot;&quot; in the Talmud (Pesahim 87b).

Aramaic became the common language in the north, in Galilee and Samaria. Hebrew remained in use in Judah, but the returning exiles brought back Aramaic influence, and Aramaic was used for communicating with other ethnic groups during the Persian period. Alexander the Great conquered the province in 332 BCE, beginning the period of Hellenistic (Greek) domination. During the Hellenistic period, Judea became independent under the Hasmonean dynasty. Later, the Romans ended their independence, making Herod the Great their governor. A revolt against the Romans led to the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, and the second Bar Kokhba revolt in 132–135 led to a purge and expulsion of the Jewish population of Judea, the establishment of a new province of Syria Palaestina, and the rebuilding of Jerusalem as the roman &quot;colonia&quot; of Aelia Capitolina.

Hebrew after the Second Temple period evolved into Mishnaic Hebrew, which ceased being spoken and developed into a literary language around 200 CE. Hebrew continued to be used as a literary and liturgical language in the form of Medieval Hebrew. The revival of the Hebrew language as a vernacular began in the 19th century, culminating in Modern Hebrew becoming the official language of Israel. Currently, Classical Hebrew is generally taught in public schools in Israel and Biblical Hebrew forms are sometimes used in Modern Hebrew literature, much as archaic and biblical constructions are used in Modern English literature. Since Modern Hebrew contains many biblical elements, Biblical Hebrew is fairly intelligible to Modern Hebrew speakers.

The primary source of Biblical Hebrew material is the Hebrew Bible. Epigraphic materials from the area of Israelite territory are written in a form of Hebrew called Inscriptional Hebrew, although this is meagerly attested. According to Waltke &amp; O&#x27;Connor, Inscriptional Hebrew &quot;is not strikingly different from the Hebrew preserved in the Masoretic text.&quot; The damp climate of Israel caused the rapid deterioration of papyrus and parchment documents, in contrast to the dry environment of Egypt, and the survival of the Hebrew Bible may be attributed to scribal determination in preserving the text through copying. No manuscript of the Hebrew Bible dates to before 400 BCE, although two silver rolls (the Ketef Hinnom scrolls) from the seventh or sixth century BCE show a version of the Priestly Blessing. Vowel and cantillation marks were added to the older consonantal layer of the Bible between 600 CE and the beginning of the 10th century. The scholars who preserved the pronunciation of the Bibles were known as the Masoretes. The most well-preserved system that was developed, and the only one still in religious use, is the Tiberian vocalization, but both Babylonian and Palestinian vocalizations are also attested. The Palestinian system was preserved mainly in piyyutim, which contain biblical quotations.

== Classification ==


Biblical Hebrew is a Northwest Semitic language from the Canaanite subgroup.

As Biblical Hebrew evolved from the Proto-Semitic language it underwent a number of consonantal mergers parallel with those in other Canaanite languages. There is no evidence that these mergers occurred after the adaptation of the Hebrew alphabet.

As a Northwest Semitic language, Hebrew shows the shift of initial to , a similar independent pronoun system to the other Northwest Semitic languages (with third person pronouns never containing ), some archaic forms, such as &#x27;we&#x27;, first person singular pronominal suffix -i or -ya, and commonly preceding pronominal suffixes. Case endings are found in Northwest Semitic languages in the second millennium BCE, but disappear almost totally afterwards. Mimation is absent in singular nouns, but is often retained in the plural, as in Hebrew.

The Northwest Semitic languages formed a dialect continuum in the Iron Age (1200–540 BCE), with Phoenician and Aramaic on each extreme. Hebrew is classed with Phoenician in the Canaanite subgroup, which also includes Ammonite, Edomite, and Moabite. Moabite might be considered a Hebrew dialect, though it possessed distinctive Aramaic features. Although Ugaritic shows a large degree of affinity to Hebrew in poetic structure, vocabulary, and some grammar, it lacks some Canaanite features (like the Canaanite shift and the shift &gt; ), and its similarities are more likely a result of either contact or preserved archaism.

Hebrew underwent the Canaanite shift, where Proto-Semitic tended to shift to , perhaps when stressed. Hebrew also shares with the Canaanite languages the shifts &gt; , and &gt; , widespread reduction of diphthongs, and full assimilation of non-final to the following consonant if word final, i.e. from *bant. There is also evidence of a rule of assimilation of to the following coronal consonant in pre-tonic position, shared by Hebrew, Phoenician and Aramaic.

Typical Canaanite words in Hebrew include: &quot;roof&quot; &quot;table&quot; &quot;window&quot; &quot;old (thing)&quot; &quot;old (person)&quot; and &quot;expel&quot;. Morphological Canaanite features in Hebrew include the masculine plural marker , first person singular pronoun , interrogative pronoun , definite article (appearing in the first millennium BCE), and third person plural feminine verbal marker .

== Eras ==
Biblical Hebrew as preserved in the Hebrew Bible is composed of multiple linguistic layers. The consonantal skeleton of the text is the most ancient, while the cantillation and modern vocalization are later additions reflecting a later stage of the language. These additions were added after 600 CE; Hebrew had already ceased being used as a spoken language around 200 CE. Biblical Hebrew as reflected in the consonantal text of the Bible and in extra-biblical inscriptions may be subdivided by era.

The oldest form of Biblical Hebrew, Archaic Hebrew, is found in poetic sections of the Bible and inscriptions dating to around 1000 BCE, the early Monarchic Period. This stage is also known as Old Hebrew or Paleo-Hebrew, and is the oldest stratum of Biblical Hebrew. The oldest known artifacts of Archaic Biblical Hebrew are various sections of the Tanakh, including the Song of Moses (Exodus 15) and the Song of Deborah (Judges 5). Biblical poetry uses a number of distinct lexical items, for example for prose &#x27;see&#x27;, for &#x27;great&#x27;. Some have cognates in other Northwest Semitic languages, for example &#x27;do&#x27; and &#x27;gold&#x27; which are common in Canaanite and Ugaritic. Grammatical differences include the use of , , and as relative particles, negative , and various differences in verbal and pronominal morphology and syntax.

Later pre-exilic Biblical Hebrew (such as is found in prose sections of the Pentateuch, Nevi&#x27;im, and some Ketuvim) is known as &#x27;Biblical Hebrew proper&#x27; or &#x27;Standard Biblical Hebrew&#x27;. This is dated to the period from the 8th to the 6th century BCE. In contrast to Archaic Hebrew, Standard Biblical Hebrew is more consistent in using the definite article , the accusative marker , distinguishing between simple and waw-consecutive verb forms, and in using particles like and rather than asyndeton.

Biblical Hebrew from after the Babylonian exile in 587 BCE is known as &#x27;Late Biblical Hebrew&#x27;. Late Biblical Hebrew shows Aramaic influence in phonology, morphology, and lexicon, and this trend is also evident in the later-developed Tiberian vocalization system.

Qumran Hebrew, attested in the Dead Sea Scrolls from ca. 200 BCE to 70 CE, is a continuation of Late Biblical Hebrew. Qumran Hebrew may be considered an intermediate stage between Biblical Hebrew and Mishnaic Hebrew, though Qumran Hebrew shows its own idiosyncratic dialectal features.

== Dialects ==
Dialect variation in Biblical Hebrew is attested to by the well-known shibboleth incident of Judges 12:6, where Jephthah&#x27;s forces from Gilead caught Ephraimites trying to cross the Jordan River by making them say šibboleṯ&quot; (&#x27;ear of corn&#x27;) The Ephraimites&#x27; identity was given away by their pronunciation: sibboleṯ&quot;. The apparent conclusion is that the Ephraimite dialect had for standard . As an alternative explanation, it has been suggested that the proto-Semitic phoneme , which shifted to in most dialects of Hebrew, may have been retained in the Hebrew of the Transjordan (however, there is evidence that &#x27;s Proto-Semitic ancestor had initial consonant š (whence Hebrew ), contradicting this theory; for example, &#x27;s proto-Semitic ancestor has been reconstructed as *&quot;šu(n)bul-at-&quot;.); or that the Proto-Semitic sibilant *s1, transcribed with šin and traditionally reconstructed as *, had been originally * while another sibilant *s3, transcribed with sameḵ and traditionally reconstructed as , had been initially ; later on, a push-type chain shift changed *s3 to and pushed s1 to in many dialects (e.g. Gileadite) but not others (e.g. Ephraimite), where *s1 and *s3 merged into .

Hebrew, as spoken in the northern Kingdom of Israel, known as Israelian Hebrew, shows phonological, lexical, and grammatical differences from southern dialects. The northern dialect spoken around Samaria shows a more frequent simplification of into as attested by the Samaria ostraca (8th century BCE), e.g. (= &lt; &#x27;wine&#x27;), while the southern or Judean dialect instead adds in an epenthetic vowel , added halfway through the first millennium BCE ( = ). The word play in Amos 8:1–2 may reflect this: given that Amos was addressing the population of the Northern Kingdom, the vocalization *קֵיץ would be more forceful. Other possible Northern features include use of &#x27;who, that&#x27;, forms like &#x27;to know&#x27; rather than and infinitives of certain verbs of the form &#x27;to do&#x27; rather than . The Samaria ostraca also show for standard &#x27;year&#x27;, as in Aramaic.

The guttural phonemes merged over time in some dialects. This was found in Dead Sea Scroll Hebrew, but Jerome (d. 420) attested to the existence of contemporaneous Hebrew speakers who still distinguished pharyngeals. Samaritan Hebrew also shows a general attrition of these phonemes, though are occasionally preserved as .

== Orthography ==

The earliest Hebrew writing yet discovered, found at Khirbet Qeiyafa, dates to the 10th century BCE. The 15 cm x 16.5 cm (5.9 in x 6.5 in) trapezoid pottery sherd (ostracon) has five lines of text written in ink in the Proto-Canaanite alphabet (the old form which predates both the Paleo-Hebrew and Phoenician alphabets). The tablet is written from left to right, suggesting that Hebrew writing was still in the formative stage.

The Israelite tribes who settled in the land of Israel used a late form of the Proto-Sinaitic Alphabet (known as Proto-Canaanite when found in Israel) around the 12th century BCE, which developed into Early Phoenician and Early Paleo-Hebrew as found in the Gezer calendar (). This script developed into the Paleo-Hebrew script in the 10th or 9th centuries BCE. The Paleo-Hebrew alphabet&#x27;s main differences from the Phoenician script were &quot;a curving to the left of the downstrokes in the &quot;long-legged&quot; letter-signs... the consistent use of a Waw with a concave top, [and an] x-shaped Taw.&quot; The oldest inscriptions in Paleo-Hebrew script are dated to around the middle of the 9th century BCE, the most famous being the Mesha Stele in the Moabite language (which might be considered a dialect of Hebrew). The ancient Hebrew script was in continuous use until the early 6th century BCE, the end of the First Temple period. In the Second Temple Period the Paleo-Hebrew script gradually fell into disuse, and was completely abandoned among the Jews after the failed Bar Kochba revolt. The Samaritans retained the ancient Hebrew alphabet, which evolved into the modern Samaritan alphabet.

By the end of the First Temple period the Aramaic script, a separate descendant of the Phoenician script, became widespread throughout the region, gradually displacing Paleo-Hebrew. The oldest documents that have been found in the Aramaic Script are fragments of the scrolls of Exodus, Samuel, and Jeremiah found among the Dead Sea scrolls, dating from the late 3rd and early 2nd centuries BCE. It seems that the earlier biblical books were originally written in the Paleo-Hebrew script, while the later books were written directly in the later Assyrian script. Some Qumran texts written in the Assyrian script write the tetragrammaton and some other divine names in Paleo-Hebrew, and this practice is also found in several Jewish-Greek biblical translations. While spoken Hebrew continued to evolve into Mishnaic Hebrew, A number of regional &quot;book-hand&quot; styles were put into use for the purpose of Torah manuscripts and occasionally other literary works, distinct from the calligraphic styles used mainly for private purposes. The Mizrahi and Ashkenazi book-hand styles were later adapted to printed fonts after the invention of the printing press. The modern Hebrew alphabet, also known as the Assyrian or Square script, appears a descendant of the Aramaic alphabet.

The Phoenician script had dropped five characters by the 12th century BCE, reflecting the language&#x27;s twenty-two consonantal phonemes. The 22 letters of the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet numbered less than the consonant phonemes of ancient Biblical Hebrew; in particular, the letters could each mark two different phonemes. After a sound shift the letters , could only mark one phoneme, but (except in Samaritan Hebrew) still marked two. The old Babylonian vocalization system wrote a superscript above the to indicate it took the value , while the Masoretes added the shin dot to distinguish between the two varieties of the letter.

The original Hebrew alphabet consisted only of consonants, but the letters , , , , also were used to indicate vowels, known as &quot;matres lectionis&quot; when used in this function. It is thought that this was a product of phonetic development: for instance, *bayt (&#x27;house&#x27;) shifted to in construct state but retained its spelling. While no examples of early Hebrew orthography have been found, older Phoenician and Moabite texts show how First Temple period Hebrew would have been written. Phoenician inscriptions from the 10th century BCE do not indicate matres lectiones in the middle or the end of a word, for example and for later and , similarly to the Hebrew Gezer Calendar, which has for instance for and possibly for . Matres lectionis were later added word-finally, for instance the Mesha inscription has for later ; however at this stage they were not yet used word-medially, compare Siloam inscription versus (for later ). The relative terms &quot;defective&quot; and &quot;full&quot;/&quot;plene&quot; are used to refer to alternative spellings of a word with less or more matres lectionis, respectively.

The Hebrew Bible was presumably originally written in a more defective orthography than found in any of the texts known today. Of the extant textual witnesses of the Hebrew Bible, the Masoretic text is generally the most conservative in its use of matres lectionis, with the Samaritan Pentateuch and its forebearers being more full and the Qumran tradition showing the most liberal use of vowel letters. The Masoretic text mostly uses vowel letters for long vowels, showing the tendency to mark all long vowels except for word-internal . In the Qumran tradition, back vowels are usually represented by whether short or long. is generally used for both long and (, ), and final is often written as in analogy to words like , , e.g. , sometimes . is found finally in forms like (Tiberian ), (Tiberian ) while may be used for an a-quality vowel in final position (e.g. ) and in medial position (e.g. ). Pre-Samaritan and Samaritan texts show full spellings in many categories (e.g. vs. Masoretic in Genesis 49:3) but only rarely show full spelling of the Qumran type.

Presumably, the vowels of Biblical Hebrew were not indicated in the original text, but various sources attest to them at various stages of development. Greek and Latin transcriptions of words from the biblical text provide early evidence of the nature of Biblical Hebrew vowels. In particular, there is evidence from the rendering of proper nouns in the Koine Greek Septuagint (3rd–2nd centuries BCE) and the Greek alphabet transcription of the Hebrew biblical text contained in the Secunda (3rd century CE, likely a copy of a preexisting text from before 100 BCE). In the 7th and 8th centuries CE various systems of vocalic notation were developed to indicate vowels in the biblical text. The most prominent, best preserved, and the only system still in use, is the Tiberian vocalization system, created by scholars known as Masoretes around 850 CE. There are also various extant manuscripts making use of less common vocalization systems (Babylonian and Palestinian), known as &quot;superlinear vocalizations&quot; because their vocalization marks are placed above the letters. In addition, the Samaritan reading tradition is independent of these systems and was occasionally notated with a separate vocalization system. These systems often record vowels at different stages of historical development; for example, the name of the Judge Samson is recorded in Greek as Σαμψών &quot;Sampsōn&quot; with the first vowel as , while Tiberian with shows the effect of the law of attenuation whereby in closed unstressed syllables became . All of these systems together are used to reconstruct the original vocalization of Biblical Hebrew.

At an early stage, in documents written in the paleo-Hebrew script, words were divided by short vertical lines and later by dots, as reflected by the Mesha Stone, the Siloam inscription, the Ophel inscription, and paleo-Hebrew script documents from Qumran. Word division was not used in Phoenician inscriptions; however, there is no direct evidence for biblical texts being written without word division, as suggested by Nahmanides in his introduction to the Torah. Word division using spaces was commonly used from the beginning of the 7th century BCE for documents in the Aramaic script. In addition to marking vowels, the Tiberian system also uses cantillation marks, which serve to mark word stress, semantic structure, and the musical motifs used in formal recitation of the text.

While the Babylonian and Palestinian reading traditions are extinct, various other systems of pronunciation have evolved over time, notably the Yemenite, Sephardi, Ashkenazi, and Samaritan traditions. Modern Hebrew pronunciation is also used by some to read biblical texts. The modern reading traditions do not stem solely from the Tiberian system; for instance, the Sephardic tradition&#x27;s distinction between qamatz gadol and qatan is likely pre-Tiberian. However, the only orthographic system used to mark vowels is the Tiberian vocalization.

== Phonology ==
The phonology as reconstructed for Biblical Hebrew is as follows:

=== Consonants ===

#Consonants lost during the lifetime of Biblical Hebrew.
#Consonants gained during the lifetime of Biblical Hebrew

The phonetic nature of some Biblical Hebrew consonants is disputed. The so-called &quot;emphatics&quot; were likely pharyngealized, but possibly velarized. The pharyngealization of emphatic consonants is viewed as a Central Semitic innovation.

Some argue that were affricated (), but Egyptian starts using &quot;s&quot; in place of earlier &quot;ṯ&quot; to represent Canaanite &quot;s&quot; around 1000 BC. It is likely that Canaanite was already dialectally split by that time, and the northern Early Phoenician dialect that the Greeks were in contact with could have preserved the affricate pronunciation until at least, unlike the more southern Canaanite dialects (like Hebrew) that the Egyptians were in contact with, so that there is no contradiction within this argument.

Originally, the Hebrew letters and each represented two possible phonemes, uvular and pharyngeal, with the distinction unmarked in Hebrew orthography. However the uvular phonemes and merged with their pharyngeal counterparts and respectively c. 200 BCE.
This is observed by noting the preservation of the double phonemes of each letter in one Sephardic reading tradition, and by noting that these phonemes are distinguished consistently in the Septuagint of the Pentateuch (e.g. Isaac = versus Rachel = ), but this becomes more sporadic in later books and is generally absent in translations of Ezra and Nehemiah.

The phoneme , is also not directly indicated by Hebrew orthography but is clearly attested by later developments: It is written with (also used for ) but later merged with (normally indicated with ). As a result, three etymologically distinct phonemes can be distinguished through a combination of spelling and pronunciation: written , written , and (pronounced but written ). The specific pronunciation of as is based on comparative evidence ( is the corresponding Proto-Semitic phoneme and still attested in Modern South Arabian languages as well as early borrowings (e.g. &quot;balsam&quot; &lt; Greek &quot;balsamon&quot; &lt; Hebrew &quot;baśam&quot;). began merging with in Late Biblical Hebrew, as indicated by interchange of orthographic and , possibly under the influence of Aramaic, and this became the rule in Mishnaic Hebrew. In all Jewish reading traditions and have merged completely; however in Samaritan Hebrew has instead merged with .

Allophonic spirantization of to (known as begadkefat spirantization) developed sometime during the lifetime of Biblical Hebrew under the influence of Aramaic. This probably happened after the original Old Aramaic phonemes disappeared in the 7th century BCE, and most likely occurred after the loss of Hebrew c. 200 BCE. It is known to have occurred in Hebrew by the 2nd century CE. After a certain point this alternation became contrastive in word-medial and final position (though bearing low functional load), but in word-initial position they remained allophonic. This is evidenced both by the Tiberian vocalization&#x27;s consistent use of word-initial spirants after a vowel in sandhi, as well as Rabbi Saadia Gaon&#x27;s attestation to the use of this alternation in Tiberian Aramaic at the beginning of the 10th century CE.

The Dead Sea scrolls show evidence of confusion of the phonemes , e.g. &quot;ħmr&quot; for Masoretic &#x27;he said&#x27;. However the testimony of Jerome indicates that this was a regionalism and not universal. Confusion of gutturals was also attested in later Mishnaic Hebrew and Aramaic (see Eruvin 53b). In Samaritan Hebrew, have generally all merged, either into , a glide or , or by vanishing completely (often creating a long vowel), except that original sometimes have reflex before .

Geminate consonants are phonemically contrastive in Biblical Hebrew. In the Secunda are never geminate. In the Tiberian tradition cannot be geminate; historically first degeminated, followed by , , and finally , as evidenced by changes in the quality of the preceding vowel.
=== Vowels ===
The vowel system of Hebrew has changed considerably over time. The following vowels are those reconstructed for the earliest stage of Hebrew, those attested by the Secunda, those of the various vocalization traditions (Tiberian and varieties of Babylonian and Palestinian), and those of the Samaritan tradition, with vowels absent in some traditions color-coded.
==== Sound changes ====

The following sections present the vowel changes that Biblical Hebrew underwent, in approximate chronological order.

===== Proto-Central-Semitic =====
Proto-Semitic is the ancestral language of all the Semitic languages, and in traditional reconstructions possessed 29 consonants; 6 monophthong vowels, consisting of three qualities and two lengths, , in which the long vowels occurred only in open syllables; and two diphthongs . The stress system of Proto-Semitic is unknown but it is commonly described as being much like the system of Classical Latin or the modern pronunciation of Classical Arabic: If the penultimate (second last) syllable is light (has a short vowel followed by a single consonant), stress goes on the antepenult (third to last); otherwise, it goes on the penult.

Various changes, mostly in morphology, took place between Proto-Semitic and Proto-Central-Semitic, the language at the root of the Central Semitic languages. The phonemic system was inherited essentially unchanged, but the emphatic consonants may have changed their realization in Central Semitic from ejectives to pharyngealized consonants.

The morphology of Proto-Central-Semitic shows significant changes compared with Proto-Semitic, especially in its verbs, and is much like in Classical Arabic. Nouns in the singular were usually declined in three cases: (nominative), (accusative) or (genitive). In some circumstances (but never in the construct state), nouns also took a final nasal after the case ending: &quot;nunation&quot; (final ) occurred in some languages, &quot;mimation&quot; (final ) in others. The original meaning of this marker is uncertain. In Classical Arabic, final on nouns indicates indefiniteness and disappears when the noun is preceded by a definite article or otherwise becomes definite in meaning. In other languages, final may be present whenever a noun is not in the construct state. Old Canaanite had mimation, of uncertain meaning, in an occurrence of the word &quot;urušalemim&quot; (Jerusalem) as given in an Egyptian transcription.

Broken plural forms in Arabic are declined like singulars, and often take singular agreement as well. Dual and &quot;strong plural&quot; forms use endings with a long vowel or diphthong, declined in only two cases: nominative and objective (combination accusative/genitive), with the objective form often becoming the default one after the loss of case endings. Both Hebrew and Arabic had a special form of nunation/mimation that co-occurred with the dual and masculine sound plural endings whenever the noun was not in the construct state. The endings were evidently felt as an inherent part of the ending and, as a result, are still used. Examples are Arabic strong masculine plural &quot;-ūna&quot; (nominative), &quot;-īna&quot; (objective), and dual endings &quot;-āni&quot; (nominative), &quot;-ayni&quot; (objective); corresponding construct-state endings are &quot;-ū, -ī&quot; (strong masculine plural), &quot;-ā, -ay&quot; (dual). (The strong feminine endings in Classical Arabic are &quot;-ātu&quot; nominative, &quot;-āti&quot; objective, marked with a singular-style &quot;-n&quot; nunation in the indefinite state only.)

If Hebrew had at some point had the broken plural, any vestigial forms that may remain have been extended with the strong plural endings. The dual and strong plural endings were likely much like the Arabic forms given above at one point, with only the objective-case forms ultimately surviving. For example, dual &quot;-ayim&quot; is probably from &quot;*-aymi&quot; with an extended mimation ending (cf. Arabic &quot;-ayni&quot; above), while dual construct &quot;-ē&quot; is from &quot;*-ay&quot; without mimation. Similarly, &quot;-īm&quot; &lt; &quot;*-īma&quot;, &quot;-ōt&quot; &lt; &quot;*-āti&quot;. (Expected plural construct state &quot;*-ī&quot; was replaced by dual &quot;-ē&quot;.)

Feminine nouns at this point ended in a suffix or in case endings. When the ending was final because of loss or non-presence of the case ending, it is replaced with and then in both Hebrew and Arabic. The final consonant therefore is silent in the absolute state, but becomes again in the construct state and when these words take suffixes, e.g. &quot;law&quot; becomes &quot;law of&quot;, and &quot;your law&quot;, etc. (This is equivalent to the Arabic letter Tāʼ Marbūṭah ة, a modified final form of the letter He ه which indicates this same phoneme shifting, and only its pronunciation varies between construct and absolute state.)

===== Potential Canaanite shift =====
Hebrew shows certain aspects of the Canaanite shift whereby often shifted to ; the conditions of this shift are disputed. This shift had occurred by the 14th century BCE, as demonstrated by its presence in the Amarna letters ().

===== Proto-Hebrew =====
As a result of the Canaanite shift, the Proto-Hebrew vowel system is reconstructed as (and possibly rare ). Furthermore, stress at this point appears to have shifted so that it was consistently on the penultimate (next to last) syllable, and was still non-phonemic. The predominant final stress of Biblical Hebrew was a result of loss of final unstressed vowels and a shift away from remaining open syllables (see below).

===== Loss of final unstressed vowels =====
Final unstressed short vowels dropped out in most words, making it possible for long vowels to occur in closed syllables.
This appears to have proceeded in two steps:
#Final short mood, etc. markers dropped in verbal forms.
#Final short case markers dropped in nominal forms.
Vowel lengthening in stressed, open syllables occurred &quot;between&quot; the two steps, with the result that short vowels at the beginning of an original -VCV ending lengthened in nouns but not verbs. This is most noticeable with short : e.g. &quot;*dabara&quot; (&#x27;word&#x27; acc.&#x27;) &gt; but &quot;*kataba&quot; (&#x27;he wrote&#x27;) &gt; .

The dropping of final short vowels in verb forms tended to erase mood distinctions, but also some gender distinctions; however, unexpected vowel lengthening occurred in many situations to preserve the distinctions. For example, in the suffix conjugation, first-singular *&quot;-tu&quot; appears to have been remade into *&quot;-tī&quot; already by Proto-Hebrew on the basis of possessive &quot;-ī&quot; (likewise first singular personal pronoun &quot;*ʔana&quot; became &quot;*ʔanī&quot;).

Similarly, in the second-singular, inherited &quot;*-ta -ti&quot; competed with lengthened &quot;*-tā -tī&quot; for masculine and feminine forms. The expected result would be &quot;-t&quot; or &quot;-tā&quot; for masculine, &quot;-t&quot; or &quot;-tī&quot; for feminine, and in fact both variants of both forms are found in the Bible (with &quot;-h&quot; marking the long &quot;-ā&quot; and &quot;-y&quot; marking the long &quot;-ī&quot;). The situation appears to have been quite fluid for several centuries, with &quot;-t&quot; and &quot;-tā/tī&quot; forms found in competition both in writing and in speech (cf. the Secunda (Hexapla) of Origen, which records both pronunciations, although quite often in disagreement with the written form as passed down to us). Ultimately, writing stabilized on the shorter &quot;-t&quot; for both genders, while speech chose feminine &quot;-t&quot; but masculine &quot;-tā&quot;. This is the reason for the unexpected qamatz vowel written under the final letter of such words.

The exact same process affected possessive &quot;*-ka&quot; (&#x27;your&#x27; masc. sing.) and &quot;*-ki&quot; (&#x27;your&#x27; fem. sing.), and personal pronouns &quot;*ʔanta, *ʔanti&quot;, with the same split into shorter and longer forms and the same ultimate resolution.

===== Short vowel lengthening (esp. pretonic), lowering =====
The short vowels tended to lengthen in various positions.
*First, short vowels lengthened in an open syllable in pretonic position (i.e. directly before the stressed syllable).
*Later, short vowels lengthened in stressed open syllables.
In the process of lengthening, the high vowels were lowered. In the Secunda, the lengthened reflexes of are ; when kept short they generally have reflexes .

===== Reduction of short open stressed syllables =====
Stressed open syllables with a short vowel (i.e. syllables consisting of a short vowel followed by a consonant and another vowel) had the vowel reduced to and the stressed moved one syllable later in the word (usually to the last syllable of the word). Presumably, stress was originally penultimate and loss of final short vowels made many words have final stress. However, in this case, words whose final syllable had a long vowel or ended with a consonant were unaffected and still had penultimate stress at this point except in pausal position, where the penultimate stress is preserved, and vowel lengthening rather than reduction occurs.

The previous three changes occurred in a complex, interlocking fashion:

# Shift of stress to be universally penultimate.
# Loss of final short vowels in verbs, pre-stress lengthening in open syllables. Pre-stress lengthening/lowering becomes a surface filter that remains as a rule in the language, automatically affected any new short vowels in open syllables as they appear (but ultra-short vowels are unaffected).
# Stress movement from light syllable to following heavy syllable when not in pausa, with newly unstressed light syllable reducing the schwa.
# Tonic lengthening/lowering in open syllables.
# Loss of final short vowels in nouns.

Examples:

Many, perhaps most, Hebrew words with a schwa directly before a final stress are due to this stress shift.

This sound change shifted many more originally penultimate-stressed words to have final stress. The above changes can be seen to divide words into a number of main classes based on stress and syllable properties:

# Proto-Hebrew words with an open penult and short-vowel ending: Become final-stressed (e.g. (&#x27;he killed&#x27;) &lt; PHeb. ).
# Proto-Hebrew words with a closed penult and short-vowel ending: Become penultimate due to segholate rule (e.g. (&#x27;king&#x27;) &lt; ).
# Proto-Hebrew words with an open short penult and longer ending: Become final-stressed due to stress shift (e.g. (&#x27;they killed&#x27;) &lt; PHeb. ).
# Proto-Hebrew words with a closed penult and longer ending: Remain penultimate (e.g. (&#x27;I killed&#x27;) &lt; PHeb. ).
# Proto-Hebrew words with an open long penult and longer ending: ???

===== Pre-stress reduction of short vowel =====
 were reduced to in the second syllable before the stress, and occasionally reduced rather than lengthened in pretonic position, especially when initial (e.g. σεμω = &#x27;his name&#x27;). Thus the vowel system of the Secunda was .

===== Later developments =====
The later Jewish traditions (Tiberian, Babylonian, Palestinian) show similar vowel developments. By the Tiberian time, all short vowels in stressed syllables and open pretonic lengthened, making vowel length allophonic. Vowels in open or stressed syllables had allophonic length (e.g. in (&#x27;he will have mercy&#x27;) &lt; previously short &lt; by Tiberian degemination of &lt; PSem ). The Babylonian and Palestinian vocalizations systems also do not mark vowel length. In the Tiberian and Babylonian systems, and lengthened become the back vowel . In unaccented closed syllables, become (Tiberian), (Babylonian), or (Palestinian) – generally becoming the second vowel before geminates (e.g. ) and the first otherwise. In the Tiberian tradition pretonic vowels are reduced more commonly than in the Secunda. It does not occur for , but is occasional for (e.g. &#x27;nails&#x27; &lt; ), and is common for (e.g. &#x27;open place&#x27; &lt; ). In Tiberian Hebrew pretonic is most commonly preserved by geminating the following consonant, e.g. (&#x27;red&#x27; pl.) (cf. &#x27;red&#x27; sg.); this pretonic gemination is also found in some forms with other vowels like ⁓ (&#x27;prisoner&#x27;).

The Babylonian and Palestinian systems have only one reduced vowel phoneme like the Secunda, though in Palestinian Hebrew it developed the pronunciation . However the Tiberian tradition possesses three reduced vowels of which has questionable phonemicity. under a non-guttural letter was pronounced as an ultrashort copy of the following vowel before a guttural, e.g. , and as preceding , e.g. , but was always pronounced as under gutturals, e.g. . When reduced, etymological become under gutturals (e.g. &#x27;you [mp.] said&#x27; cf. &#x27;he said&#x27;), and generally under non-gutturals, but &gt; (and rarely &gt; ) may still occur, especially after stops (or their spirantized counterparts) and (e.g. ). Samaritan and Qumran Hebrew have full vowels in place of the reduced vowels of Tiberian Hebrew.

Samaritan Hebrew also does not reflect etymological vowel length; however the elision of guttural consonants has created new phonemic vowel length, e.g. (&#x27;great&#x27;) vs. (&#x27;wide&#x27;). Samaritan Hebrew vowels are allophonically lengthened (to a lesser degree) in open syllables, e.g. , , though this is less strong in post-tonic vowels. Pretonic gemination is also found in Samaritan Hebrew, but not always in the same locations as in Tiberian Hebrew, e.g. TH SH ; TH SH . While Proto-Hebrew long vowels usually retain their vowel quality in the later traditions of Hebrew, in Samaritan Hebrew may have reflex in closed stressed syllables, e.g. , may become either or , and &gt; . The reduced vowels of the other traditions appear as full vowels, though there may be evidence that Samaritan Hebrew once had similar vowel reduction. Samaritan results from the neutralization of the distinction between and in closed post-tonic syllables, e.g. (&#x27;house&#x27;) (&#x27;the house&#x27;) .

Various more specific conditioned shifts of vowel quality have also occurred. Diphthongs were frequently monophthongized, but the scope and results of this shift varied among dialects. In particular, the Samaria ostraca show &lt; &lt; for Southern (&#x27;wine&#x27;), and Samaritan Hebrew shows instead the shift &gt; . Original tended to shift to (e.g. and &#x27;word&#x27;; &#x27;outside&#x27; and &#x27;outer&#x27;) beginning in the second half of the second millennium BCE. This was carried through completely in Samaritan Hebrew but met more resistance in other traditions such as the Babylonian and Qumran traditions. Philippi&#x27;s law is the process by which original in closed stressed syllables shifts to (e.g. &gt; &#x27;daughter&#x27;), or sometimes in the Tiberian tradition (e.g. &gt; &#x27;truth&#x27;). This is absent in the transcriptions of the Secunda, but there is evidence that the law&#x27;s onset predates the Secunda. In the Samaritan tradition Philippi&#x27;s law is applied consistently, e.g. &gt; (&#x27;heart&#x27;). In some traditions the short vowel tended to shift to in unstressed closed syllables: this is known as the law of attenuation. It is common in the Tiberian tradition, e.g. &gt; Tiberian (&#x27;seven&#x27;), but exceptions are frequent. It is less common in the Babylonian vocalization, e.g. (&#x27;seven&#x27;), and differences in Greek and Latin transcriptions demonstrate that it began quite late. Attenuation generally did not occur before , e.g. Tiberian (&#x27;key&#x27;) versus (&#x27;opening [construct]&#x27;), and often was blocked before a geminate, e.g. (&#x27;gift&#x27;). Attenuation is rarely present in Samaritan Hebrew, e.g. . In the Tiberian tradition take offglide before . This is absent in the Secunda and in Samaritan Hebrew but present in the transcriptions of Jerome. In the Tiberian tradition an ultrashort echo vowel is sometimes added to clusters where the first element is a guttural, e.g. (&#x27;he will listen&#x27;) (&#x27;his work&#x27;) but (&#x27;he will make glorious&#x27;) &#x27;its breadth&#x27;.

The following chart summarizes the most regular reflexes of the Proto-Semitic vowels in the various stages of Hebrew:

All Proto-Hebrew short vowels were deleted word-finally.

Notes:
# Samaritan Hebrew vowels may be lengthened in the presence of etymological guttural consonants. results from both and in closed post-tonic syllables.
# with the law of attenuation.
# with Philippi&#x27;s law.
# Samaritan are nearly in complementary distribution ( in open syllables, in closed syllables). /o/ contrasts only stressed final syllables.
# lengthening occurs in some open one syllable away from the stress and some stressed syllables; exact conditions depend on the vowel and reading tradition
# reduction occurs in the open syllables two syllables away from the stress and sometimes also in pretonic and stressed open syllables; exact conditions depend on the vowel and reading tradition.
# mainly in most closed syllables.
# more common before long consonants.
=== Stress ===
Proto-Hebrew generally had penultimate stress. The ultimate stress of later traditions of Hebrew usually resulted from the loss of final vowels in many words, preserving the location of proto-Semitic stress. Tiberian Hebrew has phonemic stress, e.g. (&#x27;they built&#x27;) vs. (&#x27;in us&#x27;); stress is most commonly ultimate, less commonly penultimate, and antipenultimate stress exists marginally, e.g. (&#x27;into the tent&#x27;). There does not seem to be evidence for stress in the Secunda varying from that of the Tiberian tradition. Despite sharing the loss of final vowels with Tiberian Hebrew, Samaritan Hebrew has generally not preserved Proto-Semitic stress, and has predominantly penultimate stress, with occasional ultimate stress. There is evidence that Qumran Hebrew had a similar stress pattern to Samaritan Hebrew.

== Grammar ==
Medieval grammarians of Arabic and Hebrew classified words as belonging to three parts of speech: Arabic &quot;ism&quot; (&#x27;noun&#x27;), &quot;fiʻl&quot; (&#x27;verb&#x27;), and &quot;ḥarf&quot; (&#x27;particle&#x27;); other grammarians have included more categories. In particular, adjectives and nouns show more affinity to each other than in most European languages. Biblical Hebrew has a typical Semitic morphology, characterized by the use of roots. Most words in Biblical Hebrew are formed from a &quot;root&quot;, a sequence of consonants with a general associated meaning. Roots are usually triconsonantal, with biconsonantal roots less common (depending on how some words are analyzed) and rare cases of quadri- and quinquiconsonantal roots. Roots are modified by affixation to form words. Verbal patterns are more productive and consistent, while noun patterns are less predictable.

=== Nouns and adjectives ===

The most common nominal prefix used is , used for substantives of location ( &#x27;assembly&#x27;), instruments ( &#x27;key&#x27;), and abstractions ( &#x27;judgement&#x27;). The vowel after is normally , but appears sometimes as , or in the case of as (contracted from ). The prefix is used to denote the action of the verb; it is derived from more common for initial- verbs, e.g. (&#x27;thanksgiving&#x27;; &lt; ydy). Prefixed is used in adjectives, e.g. (&#x27;deceptive&#x27;), and also occurs in nouns with initial sibilants, e.g. (&#x27;finger&#x27;). In the latter case this prefix was added for phonetic reasons, and the prefix is called either &quot;prothetic&quot; or &quot;prosthetic&quot;. Prefixed often occurs in quadriliteral animal names, perhaps as a prefix, e.g. (&#x27;bat&#x27;), (&#x27;mouse&#x27;), (&#x27;scorpion&#x27;).

In proto-Semitic nouns were marked for case: in the singular the markers were in the nominative, in the accusative (used also for adverbials), and in the genitive, as evidenced in Akkadian, Ugaritic, and Arabic. The Amarna letters show that this was probably still present in Hebrew In the development of Hebrew, final were dropped first, and later was elided as well. Mimation, a nominal suffix of unclear meaning, was found in early Canaanite, as shown by early Egyptian transcriptions () of Jerusalem as &quot;Urušalimim&quot;, but there is no indication of its presence after 1800 BCE. Final is preserved in , originally meaning &#x27;at night&#x27; but in prose replacing (&#x27;night&#x27;), and in the &quot;connective vowels&quot; of some prepositions (originally adverbials), e.g. (&#x27;with us&#x27;); nouns preserve in forms like . Construct state nouns lost case vowels at an early period (similar to Akkadian), as shown by the reflexes of ( in absolute but in construct) and the reflexes of ( and ) However forms like show that this was not yet a feature of Proto-Hebrew.

Biblical Hebrew has two genders, masculine and feminine, which are reflected in nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs. Hebrew distinguishes between singular and plural numbers, and plural forms may also be used for collectives and honorifics. Hebrew has a morphological dual form for nouns that naturally occur in pairs and for units of measurement and time which contrasts with the plural ( &#x27;day&#x27; &#x27;two days&#x27; &#x27;days&#x27;). A widespread misconception is that the Hebrew plural denotes three or more objects. In truth, it denotes two or more objects. However adjectives, pronouns, and verbs do not have dual forms, and most nominal dual forms can function as plurals ( &#x27;six wings&#x27; from Isaiah 6:2). Finite verbs are marked for subject person, number, and gender. Nouns also have a construct form which is used in genitive constructions.

Nouns are marked as definite with the prefix followed by gemination of the initial consonant of the noun. In Tiberian Hebrew the vowel of the article may become or in certain phonetic environments, for example (&#x27;the wise man&#x27;), (&#x27;the man&#x27;).

The traditions differ on the form of segolate nouns, nouns stemming from roots with two final consonants. The anaptyctic of the Tiberian tradition in segolates appears in the Septuagint (3rd century BCE) but not the Hexapla (2nd century CE), e.g. = Γαθερ versus = Χεσλ (Psalms 49:14). This may reflect dialectal variation or phonetic versus phonemic transcriptions. Both the Palestinian and Babylonian traditions have an anaptyctic vowel in segolates, in the Palestinian tradition (e.g. &#x27;land&#x27; = Tiberian Deuteronomy 26:15) and in Babylonian (e.g. &#x27;item&#x27; = Tiberian Jeremiah 22:28). The Qumran tradition sometimes shows some type of back epenthetic vowel when the first vowel is back, e.g. for Tiberian (&#x27;tent&#x27;).

Biblical Hebrew has two sets of personal pronouns: the free-standing independent pronouns have a nominative function, while the pronominal suffixes are genitive or accusative. Only the first person suffix has different possessive and objective forms ( and ).

=== Verbs ===
Verbal consonantal roots are placed into derived verbal stems, known as &quot;binyanim&quot; in Hebrew; the binyanim mainly serve to indicate grammatical voice. This includes various distinctions of reflexivity, passivity, and causativity. Verbs of all binyanim have three non-finite forms (one participle, two infinitives), three modal forms (cohortative, imperative, jussive), and two major conjugations (prefixing, suffixing). The meaning of the prefixing and suffixing conjugations are also affected by the conjugation , and their meaning with respect to tense and aspect is a matter of debate.

=== Word order ===
The default word order in Biblical Hebrew is commonly thought to be VSO, though one scholar has argued that this is due to the prevalence of clauses with a &quot;wayyiqtol&quot; verb form compared to other less marked forms that use SVO either more often or at least to a comparable degree. Attributive adjectives normally follow the noun they modify. In Biblical Hebrew, possession is normally expressed with status constructus, a construction in which the possessed noun occurs in a phonologically reduced, &quot;construct&quot; form and is followed by the possessor noun in its normal, &quot;absolute&quot; form. Pronominal direct objects are either suffixed to the verb or alternatively expressed on the object-marking pronoun .

=== Tense and aspect ===
Biblical Hebrew has two main conjugation types, the suffix conjugation, also called the Perfect, and the prefix conjugation, also called Imperfect. The Perfect verb form expressed the idea of the verb as a completed action, viewing it from start to finish as a whole, and not focusing on the process by which the verb came to be completed, stating it as a simple fact. This is often used in the past tense; however, there are some contexts in which a Perfect verb translates into the present and future tenses.

The Imperfect portrays the verb as an incomplete action along with the process by which it came about, either as an event that has not begun, an event that has begun but is still in the process, or a habitual or cyclic action that is on an ongoing repetition. The Imperfect can also express modal or conditional verbs, as well as commands in the Jussive and Cohortative moods. It is conjectured that the imperfect can express modal quality through the paragogic nun added to certain imperfect forms. While often future tense, it also has uses in the past and present under certain contexts. Biblical Hebrew tense is not necessarily reflected in the verb forms per se, but rather is determined primarily by context. The Participles also reflect ongoing or continuous actions, but are also subject to the context determining their tense.

The verbal forms can be Past Tense in these circumstances:
* &quot;Perfect, Simple Past&quot;: in narrative, reflects a simple completed action, perception, emotion or mental process, and can also be past tense from the perspective of a prior verb which is used in future tense
* &quot;Imperfect, Waw Consecutive Preterite&quot;: simple past tense which takes the וַ prefix as a conjunction, appears at the beginning of a clause when it is connected in a narrative sequence with previous clauses, where the conjunction can be translated as &#x27;and then&#x27;, &#x27;then&#x27;, &#x27;but&#x27;, &#x27;however&#x27;, sometimes is not translated at all, and can even have a parenthetical function as if suggesting the clause is like a side note to the main focus of the narrative
* &quot;Imperfect, Past&quot;: reflecting not just a past action but also suggesting the process with which it was being done, e.g.: &quot;I brought the horse to a halt&quot;, &quot;I began to hear&quot;
* &quot;Imperfect, Cyclic Past&quot;: reflecting a habitual or cyclic action over time, e.g. &quot;this is what Job would always do&quot;
* &quot;Participle in Past Tense&quot;: an active or passive Participle being used in its imperfect verbal sense in the past, e.g. &quot;and the Spirit of God was hovering&quot;
The verbal forms can be Present Tense in these circumstances:
* &quot;Perfect, Proverbial/General Present&quot;: a general truth in the present tense which is not referring to a specific event, e.g. &quot;the sun sets in the west&quot;
* &quot;Perfect, Stative Present&quot;: present tense with verbs that depict a state of being rather than an action, including verbs of perception, emotion or mental process, e.g. &quot;I love&quot;, &quot;I hate&quot;, &quot;I understand&quot;, &quot;I know&quot;
* &quot;Perfect, Present Perfect&quot;: a Present Perfect verb, e.g. &quot;I have walked&quot;
* &quot;Imperfect, Present Condition&quot;: an Imperfect verb in the present, one which implies that an action has been going on for some time and is still ongoing in the present, especially used of questions in the present, e.g. &quot;what are you seeking?&quot;
* &quot;Imperfect, Cyclic Present&quot;: an Imperfect verb in the present, reflecting a cyclic action in the present, e.g. &quot;it is being said in the city&quot;, &quot;a son makes his father glad&quot;
* &quot;Participle in Present Tense&quot;: an active or passive Participle being used in its imperfect verbal sense in the present, e.g. &quot;I am going&quot;
The verbal forms can be Future Tense in these circumstances:
* &quot;Perfect, Waw Consecutive Future&quot;: by analogy to the Preterite, a simple future tense verb which takes the וְ prefix as a conjunction, appears at the beginning of a clause when it is connected in a narrative sequence with previous clauses, where the conjunction can be translated as &#x27;and then&#x27;, &#x27;then&#x27;, &#x27;but&#x27;, &#x27;however&#x27;, sometimes is not translated at all, and can even have a parenthetical function as if suggesting the clause is like a side note to the main focus of the narrative
* &quot;Perfect, Waw Consecutive Subjunctive&quot;: takes the וְ prefix as a conjunction to continue the Subjunctive Mood in a narrative sequence
* &quot;Perfect, Waw Consecutive Jussive/Cohortative&quot;: takes the וְ prefix as a conjunction to continue the Jussive and Cohortative Moods in a narrative sequence
* &quot;Perfect, Promise Future&quot;: the completeness of the verb form here expresses an imminent action in the context of promises, threats and the language of contracts and covenants in general, e.g. &quot;I will give you this land&quot;, &quot;will I have this pleasure?&quot;
* &quot;Perfect, Prophetic Future&quot;: the completeness of the verb form here expresses an imminent action in the context of prophecy, e.g. &quot;you will go into exile&quot;
* &quot;Imperfect, Future&quot;: reflects a future event which has not yet come into completion, or one that has not yet begun, or future tense from the perspective of a prior verb which is used in past tense
* &quot;Imperfect, Subjunctive&quot;: reflects a potential, theoretical or modal verb, such as in conditional clauses, e.g. &quot;If you go...&quot;, &quot;she should stay&quot;
* &quot;Imperfect, Jussive/Cohortative&quot;: reflects a non-immediate command, invitation, permission or wishful request, e.g. &quot;let there be light&quot;, &quot;you may eat from the tree&quot;, &quot;let&#x27;s go&quot;, &quot;O that someone would get me a drink&quot;

<text>Turner is a neighborhood within Kansas City, Kansas, United States. It was formerly an unincorporated community of Wyandotte County, similar to Piper, Kansas. Turner has its own school district, Turner USD #202.

==History==
The Prophet (Tenskwatawa; literally, &quot;the door opener&quot;), brother of Tecumseh, created Shawneetown in the area (near what today is Woodend and Shawnee Drive at 35th street). He made his final home near Turner in Argentine, Kansas (the property is today owned by Jack Beemont). Blue Jacket (Weyapiersenwah), who was Tecumseh&#x27;s adoptive brother, was known to the early European settlers in this area. According to legend, one of the Shawnee chiefs, Fish, died and was buried in the Shawnee Township Cemetery (which is located in the heart of modern-day Turner).

===19th century===

In 1828, Cyprian Chouteau established the first trading post in this locale. It was the American Fur Company trading house (located near 55th and Speaker Road). The original Shawnee Methodist Mission was built in 1830 near Chouteau&#x27;s old trading post (near the heart of the Turner community). Reverend Thomas Johnson built the mission for the Shawnee. It was located at what would be 5100 block of Edgehill Drive. This mission was open until 1839, when the Mission School was built at the current location in Johnson County. Around 1837, Charles Lovelace established a saw mill (today it would be located at 55th and Speaker Road, but has been long ago torn down). There was also a grist mill in close proximity. In 1838, the mighty steamboat, &quot;The Antelope&quot; docked in the area. It had several scientists and pioneers heading west. They stayed over in the area on their journey to Fort Pierre in South Dakota.

The &quot;Delaware Crossing&quot; (or &quot;&quot;Military Crossing&quot;; sometimes &quot;the Secondine&quot;&quot;) was where the old Indian trail met the waters of the Kaw River. Around 1831, Moses Grinter (one of the earliest permanent white settler in the area) set up the Grinter Ferry on the Kansas River here. His house, the Grinter Place, still stands at 1420 South 78th Street. The ferry was used by individuals (such as traders, freighters, and soldiers) traveling between Fort Leavenworth and Fort Scott on the military road. Other would cross this area on their way to Santa Fe.

Various farmers took up residence around Turner by the fall of 1854. Turner as a community was known as early as 1856 (and no later than 1859). The community, then named &quot;Farmer, Kansas&quot;, tried to incorporate itself on October 8, 1859. The attempt failed because the community never had enough population to achieve the statute requirements.

Members of the old Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders sacked a few homes and killed some of the inhabitants of the area around July 1863. Various families (living in the area that today is between Swartz Road from 51st to 53rd Street) suffered in the attacks. They were fended off from but a few homes.

In 1859, the community had been referred to as the &quot;Farmer&quot; community (when the first post office was established). Twenty years later, the community took the name &quot;Turner&quot;. Farmer post office name was switched to the &quot;Turner&quot; post office on September 23, 1879; by Robert M. Hester.

===20th century===
The Flood of 1903 hit Turner. The 1910 population was around 200 people. In 1912, Turner had a few general stores, a school, money order post office, telegraph and express facilities.

Historically, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway went through Argentine, Turner, and Kaw Valley. From the railroad yard in the Argentine, the railroad cars would be turned around at the Farmer train platform. The Farmer train station&#x27;s circular platform stood at 55th street (which is Turner’s main downtown area).

Parts of Turner were hit in the Great Flood of 1951 and the flood resulted in the &quot;Highland&quot; community being built (for displaced individuals from Argentine and Armourdale). Between late 1965 and early 1966, Kansas City, Kansas, annexed the community of Turner. Although now a part of Kansas City, Kansas, the community still retains its own distinct flavor and personality.

The Turner post office was discontinued in 1958.

==Education==

===Primary and secondary education===
The community is served by Turner USD 202 public school district.

The Golden Bear mascot was adopted for the school and community in 1886. Two members of the community, Warren Hewitt and Jule Gaignet, submitted the icon and it won the majority of support in a contest. Reportedly, the two youths had heard of the bear from stories told by their grandparents. This icon is based on legends of a golden bear that live in the area.

According to John Gardiner in 1831, the great golden bear that lived in the area was feared and admired by the local native population. The bear lived south of the river in the hills west of the Methodist Mission. According to legend, it was the largest bear that any of the natives had ever seen. It would raid the settlements of the area folks and feasted on the animals owned by the local population (the Shawnee tribe). Many of the Indians wanted to kill the bear for the pride of such a feat and the capture of its hide (the fur was most sought after). The golden bear was seen several times by the ferry crew on the Old Grinter Ferry during the 1830s and 1840s. Both the Shawnee and the Wyandot gathered a hunting party, but were unsuccessful in tracking the bear down.

Turner USD 202 consolidated the five old school districts of Turner, Junction, Oak Grove, Morris, and Muncie in 1961 and currently consists of:

*Turner High School
*Turner Middle School
*Turner Primary
*Junction Primary
*Oak Grove Primary
*Midland Trail Primary
*Sixth Grade Academy
==Infrastructure==

===Roads===
* Interstate 435
* Turner Diagonal
* K-132

===Street names===
The road overseers were Peter Partonnar, John Gibbs, and H. L. Swinggley. Peter Partonnar (sometimes misspelled as Par&quot;turner&quot;) has been rumored to be the origin of the name for Turner (but this is doubtful as the Partonnar family lived in Shawnee for many years and did not come to live in Turner till the name was already acquired).

;New and old

* 55th Street (Portion) was known as &quot;Lovelace Mill Road&quot; and later it was named &quot;Ambrose Key Road&quot; after the saw mill was closed down. Still later it was renamed &quot;Turner Avenue&quot; until annexation. (55th leads Douglas and then into Key lane which goes to Gibbs Road)
* 56th Street was &quot;Central Avenue&quot;
* 57th Street was &quot;Ore Avenue&quot;
* Gibbs Road was named in honor of John Gibbs Jr.
* Metropolitan Avenue was &quot;Hester Road&quot;; Albert Hester had a farm, Hester Farm, on this route (it also crossed the road from Fort Scott and Fort Leavenworth).
* Swartz Road was &quot;Silver Avenue&quot;
* Miami was &quot;Smelter Avenue&quot;
* Osage was &quot;Cable Avenue&quot;
* Key Lane was for a time called &quot;Ridgeview Road&quot;

<doc id="763216" wikidata="Q4921453" url="?curid=763216" title="Black People's Convention">
<text>The Black People&#x27;s Convention (BPC) was a national coordinating body for the Black Consciousness movement of South Africa. Envisaged as a broad-based counterpart to the South African Students&#x27; Organisation, the BPC was active in organising resistance to apartheid from its establishment in 1972 until it was banned in late 1977.

== Formation ==
The BPC was an outgrowth of the Black Consciousness movement in South Africa, which gained traction in the early 1970s and increasingly became a major alternative source of ideological and organisational support for resistance to the system of apartheid. With the influence of the South African Students&#x27; Organisation (SASO) growing, Black Consciousness leaders called for the formation of a new Black Consciousness political organisation to engage and mobilise broader civil society, outside the universities. The shape of this national umbrella body, which became the BPC, was discussed at a series of conferences in 1971. The BPC was launched in July 1972 in Pietermaritzburg. At its first national congress in December 1972, held in Hammanskraal, Winnie Kgware was elected its first president.

== Activities and principles ==
The BPC subscribed to a Black Consciousness philosophy, as articulated by Steve Biko. Biko was closely associated with the BPC, although his political activity was seriously circumscribed following his banning in 1973. His brother-in-law, Mxolisi Mvovo, became national vice president of the BPC in 1976. The BPC collaborated with other Black Consciousness organisations, such as SASO, with whom its membership overlapped significantly. Membership was not open to whites.

According to its constitution, the BPC&#x27;s principal aim was to foster black political unity and solidarity, towards both psychological and material liberation for blacks in South Africa. The BPC opposed apartheid through non-violent means and through non-participation in the apartheid system. It also advocated for an equitable economic system based on socialism and what it called &quot;black communalism&quot;. As described in the BPC&#x27;s &quot;Mafikeng Manifesto&quot;, co-written by Biko and debated at a symposium in Mafikeng in 1976, black communalism was a variant of the traditional African economic system, modified for a modern and industrialised economy. It entailed communal ownership, and state custodianship, of all land.

== Government crackdown ==
On 25 September 1974, the day of an illegal pro-FRELIMO rally in Durban organised by the BPC and SASO, leaders in the BPC and other Black Consciousness organisations were arrested across the country. In the aftermath, nine BPC and SASO leaders were tried under the Terrorism Act. A second, more serious wave of government repression followed the 1976 Soweto Uprising. On 19 October 1977, sometimes known as &quot;Black Wednesday&quot;, 18 organisations, including the BPC and SASO, were banned by the apartheid government. As many as 70 Black Consciousness leaders were arrested on the same day. Among them were Kenny Rachidi and Drake Tshenkeng, the BPC&#x27;s president and vice president respectively. Biko himself had died in custody a month earlier.

== Aftermath ==
In the years after Black Wednesday, many BPC and Black Consciousness activists became active in the Azanian People&#x27;s Organisation (Azapo) and its subsidiary organisations. Azapo was founded in April 1978 in Roodepoort as an offshoot of the Soweto Action Council, which had been formed in Chiawelo, Soweto, shortly after the 1977 crackdown. Like the BPC, Azapo was closed to whites and strongly opposed participation in the apartheid system – it even inherited the BPC&#x27;s slogan, &quot;One Azania, one people&quot; – but it was more rigidly Marxist than the BPC. BPC and Black Consciousness activists in exile joined the Black Consciousness Movement of Azania (BCMA), established in London as Azapo&#x27;s external wing before BCMA and Azapo formally merged in 1994.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, however, the popularity of Congress-aligned organisations increased and Black Consciousness organisations (though not necessarily Black Consciousness ideologies) declined in influence. When Azapo was itself banned in 1988, many more Black Consciousness-aligned youths left South Africa and joined the Pan Africanist Congress and African National Congress, in order to receive military training in exile.

<doc id="763221" wikidata="Q571118" url="?curid=763221" title="European Agency for Safety and Health at Work">
<text>The European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) is a decentralised agency of the European Union with the task of collecting, analysing and disseminating relevant information that can serve the needs of businesses, governments and specialists involved in safety and health at work. Set up in 1994 by Council Regulation (EC) No 2062/94 of 18 July 1994, EU-OSHA is based in Bilbao, Spain, where it has a staff of occupational safety and health (OSH), communication and administrative specialists. William Cockburn Salazar is the current Executive Director of EU-OSHA. Council Regulation (EC) No 2062/94 was replaced by Regulation (EU) 2019/126 on 20 February 2019.

EU-OSHA contributes to an evidence base which policymakers can use to establish future policies regarding OSH. EU-OSHA publishes a monthly newsletter, OSHmail, which informs about current OSH topics, and offers publications, such as detailed reports and media content called Napo 

EU-OSHA works through diverse networks spanning the EU, with its main activities covering: analysis and research, risk prevention, partnerships, campaigning and awareness raising. EU-OSHA was given an important role in the 2021-27 EU Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work and this was reflected in the EU-OSHA Strategy and Annual Management Plan.

== Networks ==
EU-OSHA works in partnership with a wide range of organisations. The Directorate-General Employment, Social Affairs &amp; Inclusion is its reference at the European Commission. At the national level, EU-OSHA is represented by a network of &quot;focal points&quot; in over 30 countries across Europe. Focal points are usually the primary safety and health organisation of a particular country. Each focal point operates a tripartite national network to ensure that information on safety and health at work can be effectively collected and disseminated.

EU-OSHA emphasises the importance of a tripartite approach, whereby it works in partnership with governments, employers and workers&#x27; representatives. This tripartite structure (Management Board) is key to the way EU-OSHA implements its work programme and carries out its campaigns. Through its campaigns EU-OSHA also works with companies and associations in the public and private sector, and with the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN), a business support network that aims to help small businesses in the European marketplace.

== Main activities ==
=== Analysis and research ===
EU-OSHA is responsible for contributing to the evidence base through commissioning, collecting and publishing studies on OSH as well as monitoring, collecting and analysing statistical information on workplace risks across the EU. 

EU-OSHA’s website contains a OSH-themed section, including topics like ageing, COVID-19, dangerous substances, digitalisation, disability, health and social care, mental health, work-related diseases and more.

The online encyclopaedia provides up-to-date information on various OSH topics with a European perspective. The website features technical articles by EU-OSHA and independent authors. 

One of EU-OSHA’s key objectives is to provide data on new and emerging OSH risks to aid policy-makers and researchers in taking effective action. To achieve this, the Agency runs Foresight projects that anticipate future safety and health concerns. These projects explore potential scenarios arising from technological and societal changes, highlight implications for occupational safety and health, and suggest ways to avoid future risks.

=== Facts &amp; Figures ===
EU-OSHA carries out a series of EU-wide surveys to get an insight into occupational safety and health issues across European companies, their management at the workplace, as well as the identification of emerging risks and OSH trends in order to help policy-makers and researchers. 

The European Survey of Enterprises on New and Emerging Risks (ESENER) looks at how European workplaces manage OSH risks in practice. With the involvement of thousands of businesses and organisations across Europe, this survey focuses on psychosocial risks, drivers and barriers to OSH management and worker participation. 

The Exposure Survey on cancer risk factors in Europe (WES) aims to better identify the cancer risk factors responsible for most of the exposures, providing an accurate and comprehensive overview, and contributing to preventive measures, awareness-raising and policy-making, as well as helping in the fight against occupational cancer. 

The OSH Pulse survey offers valuable insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on workers’ health and wellbeing and related workplace measures, also in combination with the increasing use of digital technologies in the workplace.

=== Prevention ===
EU-OSHA aims to create a culture of risk prevention and is involved with designing practical instruments that can be used by companies of micro, small and medium sizes that will help them to assess workplace risks and implement a preventive action plan. As part of this aim EU-OSHA has created the Online interactive Risk Assessment web platform that enables the creation of sectoral risk assessment tools in a number of languages in an easy and standardised way. 

EU-OSHA also shares knowledge and good practice on safety and health through its Good Practice Awards scheme and its publications, ranging from in-depth research reports to topical info sheets, designed for use in the workplace. 

=== Campaigning and awareness-raising ===
EU-OSHA raises awareness about occupational safety and health through its Healthy Workplaces Campaigns, run with partners in over 30 European countries since 2000. Each 25-month campaign focuses on a specific theme, such as digitalisation (2023-25) or psychosocial risks and mental health at work (2026-28). As part of these campaigns, EU-OSHA produces freely available information, practical guides, tools, and communication materials, translated into over 20 European languages. These campaigns are conducted in partnership with more than 100 campaign and media partners, as well as through the agency&#x27;s network of national focal points and the Enterprise Europe Network.

Linked to and acting as an annual focus for campaigns, EU-OSHA is coordinating the European Week for Safety and Health at Work, held each year in October, when events such as training sessions, conferences and workshops are held. Such events are organised across Europe by the focal points in Member States.

EU-OSHA, together with national safety and health organisations, has produced animated films highlighting workplace health and safety. The main character, Napo, represents a typical employee who encounters various hazards but also suggests improvements.

<text>Miklós Németh (, born 24 January 1948) is a retired Hungarian economist and politician who served as Prime Minister of Hungary from 24 November 1988 to 23 May 1990. He was one of the leaders of the Socialist Workers&#x27; Party, Hungary&#x27;s Communist party, in the tumultuous years that led to the collapse of communism in Eastern and Central Europe. He was the last Communist Prime Minister of Hungary.

==Early life==
Németh was born into a poor Catholic peasant family on 24 January 1948 in Monok, the birthplace of the revolutionary Lajos Kossuth. He was of Swabian origin on his maternal side, the Stajzs had been resettled by the aristocrat Károlyi family in the 18th century. Németh&#x27;s grandfather was deported from Monok to the Soviet Union in Autumn, 1944, and only in 1951 was he able to return home. His father András Németh, a devout Catholic, fought in the Battle of Voronezh and survived the Soviet offensive by the Don River in early 1943. He returned to Hungary in 1946. That kind of dual identity was present in Németh&#x27;s political life, since he had a Christian family background behind his Communist party career. For instance, when he married Erzsébet Szilágyi in 1971, they also had a church wedding after their civil marriage. Németh was 8 years old during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. He had just isolated experiences about those events; his parents listened to Radio Free Europe, 1848 flags were erected in the main square of the village, and the local party secretary was arrested and revolutionaires forced him to recite Lord&#x27;s Prayer. Németh could not have known the whole truth of the events due to state propaganda and concealment until his studies in the United States.

After finishing elementary school in Szerencs, in 1962 Németh attended Berzeviczy Gergely School of Trade and Catering in Miskolc, where theologian and historian Gábor Deák was one of his teachers. He took his final exam in 1966, after that he was admitted to the Karl Marx University of Economics. Uniquely in the academic system of the communist era, the university had a certain degree of autonomy due to the powerful and influential rector Kálmán Szabó, who had participated in the preparation and production of a major economic reform, called the New Economic Mechanism in 1968, which introduced some market and capitalist elements to the Hungarian economic system. Under this reformist leadership, a new economist intelligentsia emerged, instead of Orthodox Marxist experts, which were already acquainted with the Western mainstream curriculum and they had the opportunity to study abroad.

Németh graduated in 1971, after that he became an assistant lecturer, later a full-time university professor. Németh won a scholarship of International Research &amp; Exchanges Board to the United States for the 1975/76 semesters, where he subsequently attended Harvard University. He learned decision theory, cost–benefit analysis and business law. Németh later was accused by hard-line communist leaders who said that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had recruited him during his Harvard year, however he called these charges &quot;nonsensical&quot;.

==Early career==
Returning home, Németh left the University of Economics and worked for the National Planning Office (OT) from 1977. He also joined the Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (MSZMP) during this time. He was a theoretical researcher until 1978, when he was transferred to the office&#x27;s Economics Department. There his role was preparation of shortened plan documents on industrial, agrarian, social etc. surveys, drafts which were dispatched to the Council of Ministers. According to Németh, he then became familiar with the economic reality and the true extent of the huge public debt. The Communist regime and the Hungarian National Bank led a double bookkeeping, even the majority of the party&#x27;s Political Committee had no information on the real data. Németh began working for the Socialist Workers&#x27; Party Economic Department in 1981. He and Ferenc Bartha negotiated with Alan Whittome and Jacques de Larosière, representatives of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 1982, but Németh also took part in a conference to resort to loans from China, bypassing the Soviets.

Németh was appointed Head of Economic Department in 1986, when Mikhail Gorbachev became leader of the Soviet Union. Németh, who knew the new Secretary-General earlier, anticipated that a new period would go with social, political, and economic reforms. Németh was promoted to the Central Committee as Secretary in charge of Economic Policy in June 1987. In May 1988, he was elevated to the Politburo. During that time, long-serving Secretary-General János Kádár was replaced by Prime Minister Károly Grósz, who tried to establish a &quot;technocratic&quot; government and commissioned Németh to negotiate with Deutsche Bank aimed at getting a one billion Mark loan.

==Prime Minister of Hungary==
In the summer of 1988, Secretary-General Grósz announced his intention to resign from his position as Prime Minister to focus entirely on the organization of the party. Unlike the previous practice, he nominated four candidates, Rezső Nyers, Imre Pozsgay, Ilona Tatai and Pál Iványi to the post to discuss with local party committees, trade unions and the Patriotic People’s Front. As Grósz was aware of the disastrous economic situation and impending insolvency, Németh was also nominated for the position because he had established a reputation of being an economics expert. Finally the elderly Nyers withdrew himself from candidature in favor of Németh. He took the oath on 24 November 1988, at the time he was the world&#x27;s youngest head of government until the election of Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in December 1988.

Németh became Prime Minister from a relatively low position as he had never held any ministerial or state secretary posts in the previous governments. He also &quot;inherited&quot; some influential ministers from the Grósz Cabinet (i.e. Frigyes Berecz and István Horváth), which led to the presumption within the party that Németh was Grósz&#x27;s sidekick in those months. As there had not yet been created a budget for the next year, the system was not sustainable without budget cuts, according to Németh, Grósz&#x27;s goal was to make his Prime Minister a scapegoat, protecting his power and the communist ideology. Conflicts between hard-line and reformist wings widened when Grósz gave a speech in the Budapest Sportcsarnok in which he made mention of the sharpening of the class struggle and hinted at the possibility of the looming threat of the White terror&#x27;s return to Hungary. Németh gradually decoupled himself from the party leadership. Grósz, who had no idea that his successor would be self-propelled, even bugged Németh&#x27;s telephone and the latter&#x27;s staff later found covert listening devices in the Prime Minister&#x27;s residence. Over the coming months the hard-line wing got permanently weakened; the Political Committee and the Patriotic People&#x27;s Front renounced their right to nominate candidates for ministerial positions; and by 10 May 1989, Németh managed to completely revamp the composition of his cabinet. He transformed the cabinet into a &quot;government of experts&quot; whose members were destined to make the transition from one-party dictatorship to democracy. Reformists Gyula Horn, László Békesi, Csaba Hütter, Ferenc Glatz and Ferenc Horváth became members of the cabinet then. After that the Németh government was placed under the authority of the National Assembly instead of the Socialist Workers&#x27; Party.

===Transition to democracy===

After being promoted to Prime Minister in November 1988, Németh made a controversial decision to allow East Germans, who had long been restricted from traveling, to pass through Hungary on their way to West Germany. This decision is widely regarded as a contributing factor to the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November, 1989. He became Hungary&#x27;s first post-Communist Prime Minister after the Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party was transformed into the Hungarian Socialist Party, on 7 October, 1989, a left of centre social democratic party - of which Németh was a founding member. Following the passing of constitutional amendments by parliament on 23 October 1989 that removed the Constitution&#x27;s communist character, Németh became the first (provisional) Prime Minister of the Third Hungarian Republic, and the new leader of Hungary as such.

==After premiership==
He left office on 23 May 1990, after suffering defeat by József Antall in Hungary&#x27;s first free elections following the fall of Communism. He was an independent MP for Szerencs until April 1991. Németh subsequently served as Vice President of the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the financial institution established by the international community to assist the countries of eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet Union in their transition to democratic market economies. In 2000, he left the EBRD to return to Hungary. He attempted to become the PM-designate of the opposition socialist party, but was unsuccessful, as Péter Medgyessy was appointed to that role. Medgyessy later became Prime Minister.

In 1993, Németh also received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University.

In 2007, Németh was commissioned by the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to investigate the illegal use of bounty by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to North Korea. Prior to this, the Central Intelligence Agency had informed Administrator Kemal Derviş that the North Korean regime counterfeited and reprinted sent banknotes, which was part of their food aid. Németh led the three-member inquiry committee which determined the existence of this unauthorized use of funds, and distribution branches in Cairo and Macau. In June 2008, the 380-page report was published.

For his role in the unification of Germany and Europe, in June 2014 Németh received the Point Alpha Prize. Németh also participated in the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, alongside Mikhail Gorbachev, Lech Wałęsa and German politicians. In an interview, Németh said that the demolition of the Berlin Wall happened all of a sudden, but momentum had been building for months that led up to the event, as in March 1989 Gorbachev had promised that the Soviets would not act violently after the opening of the Hungarian border with Austria.

<text>Qiqihar, (also spelled Tsitsihar,) is the second-largest city in the Heilongjiang province of China, in the west central part of the province. The built-up (or metro) area made up of Longsha, Tiefeng and Jianhua districts had 959,787 inhabitants, while the total population of the prefecture-level city was shrinking to 4,067,489 as of the 2020 census (5,367,003 as of 2010). These are mainly Han Chinese, though the city is also home to thirty-four minorities including Manchus, Daur, and Mongols.
Numerous wetlands are close to Qiqihar, including the Zhalong Nature Reserve, famous in China for being home to numerous red-crowned cranes.

==Etymology==
&quot;Qiqihar&quot; is a Dagur word meaning &quot;border&quot; or &quot;natural pasture&quot;. The name Qiqihar comes from , IPA: /t͡ɕʰi.t͡ɕʰi.χar/.

==History==
===Early history===

Qiqihar is one of the oldest cities in the northeast of China. The region was originally settled by nomadic Daur and Tungus herdsmen. The city&#x27;s original name was Bukui (), the Chinese transcription of a Dagur word meaning &quot;auspicious&quot;. The city&#x27;s oldest mosque, the Bukui Mosque, predates the foundation of the city by seven years. During the Imperial Russian eastward advance to the Pacific, Qiqihar became a major garrison center in 1674. In 1691, a stronghold was constructed in Qiqihar because the Qing government campaigned against the Mongols.

Around 1700 it was a centre for Russo-Chinese trade. A military depot with barracks and an arsenal was set up there, and many convicted criminals were exiled to the area. Heilongjiang Martial was domiciled in Qiqihar City in 1699. Qing China had initially intended to keep the far-northern Heilongjiang province as a semi-pastoral area, separate from the wider Chinese agricultural economy, so it did not allow seasonal urban migrants, such as those from Hebei and Shandong who wished to participate in the Qiqihar fur trade, to own farms or develop the land.

After the Russian Empire seized Outer Manchuria according to the Treaty of Aigun and the Convention of Peking, the Qing decided to lift the various restrictions on settlement that it placed on Northeast China and on Heilongjiang residency in particular, in 1868, 1878, and 1904. It enlisted Han Chinese to help to teach the local Solon people farming techniques, provide materials and tax exemptions to convert them from hunting. In 1903, the completion of the Chinese Eastern Railway made Qiqihar a centre for communications between China and Russia. A network of lines radiating from Qiqihar was extended into the northwestern part of Heilongjiang Province including Jiagedaqi and Manzhouli in the late 1920s.

===Second Sino-Japanese War===

In 1931, Japan used a false flag attack, known as the September 18 Incident, to justify moving its Guandong Army to capture major cities in Northeast China that month, starting with Shenyang, Changchun, then Jilin City. General Ma Zhanshan was ordered to act as Governor and Military Commander-in-chief of Heilongjiang Province on 10 October. General Ma declined a Japanese ultimatum to surrender Qiqihar on 15 November. However, after their success in the Jiangqiao campaign, the Japanese began their occupation of Qiqihar on 19 November. Liaoning fell in December, and Harbin in February; the puppet Manchukuo government of the Japanese-occupied territory under General Zhang Jinghui established Qiqihar as its administrative center and of Longjiang province. Qiqihar became a major military base for the Guandong Army and its economic importance also grew rapidly. During the occupation, the Imperial Japanese Army established Unit 516 in Qiqihar for research into chemical warfare. A major mustard gas tank left over from the Second Sino-Japanese War buried underground was accidentally damaged in August 2003, causing 43 injuries and one death.

===Modern era===

After the defeat of Japan, the Democratic Regime Qiqihar Municipal Government was established, under the administration of Nenjiang Province. Japanese forces in Northeast China surrendered to the Soviet Union while other Japanese forces in the rest of China surrendered to the Nationalist government. From March to May, Soviet troops progressively withdrew from their positions, giving the People&#x27;s Liberation Army more notice than the National Revolutionary Army so that the former could occupy more positions in the context of the Chinese Civil War. Qiqihar was controlled by the Communists on April 24, 1946, along with other important regional cities like Changchun, Jilin City, and Harbin. Qiqihar was established as the capital of Heilongjiang Province after the foundation of People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949. However, after Songjiang Province was merged into Heilongjiang Province, the provincial capital was transferred to Harbin in 1954. During the first five-year plan of China from 1951 to 1956, many factories including Beiman Special Steel Co. and China First Heavy Industries were aid-constructed by the Soviet Union in Fularji District, making Qiqihar an important centre of equipment manufacturing industry in Northeast China.

<text>The common whitetail or long-tailed skimmer (Plathemis lydia) is a common dragonfly across much of North America, with a striking and unusual appearance. The male&#x27;s chunky white body (about 5 cm or 2 inches long), combined with the brownish-black bands on its otherwise translucent wings, give it a checkered look. Females have a brown body and a different pattern of wing spots, closely resembling that of female &quot;Libellula pulchella&quot;, the twelve-spotted skimmer. Whitetail females can be distinguished by their smaller size, shorter bodies, and white zigzag abdominal stripes; the abdominal stripes of &quot;L. puchella&quot; are straight and yellow.
The common whitetail can be seen hawking for mosquitoes and other small flying insects over ponds, marshes, and slow-moving rivers in most regions except the higher mountain regions. Periods of activity vary between regions; for example in California, the adults are active from April to September.

Like all perchers, common whitetails often rest on objects near the water, and sometimes on the ground. Males are territorial, holding a of the water&#x27;s edge, and patrolling it to drive off other males. The white pruinescence on the abdomen, found only in mature males, is displayed to other males as a territorial threat.

The nymphs are dark green or brown, but are usually found covered in algae. They feed on aquatic invertebrates such as mayfly larvae and small crayfish, and also on small aquatic vertebrates such as tadpoles and minnows. Because of their abundance, whitetail naiads are in turn an important food source for various fish, frogs, and birds, and also for other aquatic insects.

Some authorities classify the whitetails, including the common whitetail, in genus &quot;Libellula&quot; rather than &quot;Plathemis&quot;. This matter has been debated at least since the end of the nineteenth century. Recent molecular systematic evidence suggests that separation of the whitetails from the rest of &quot;Libellula&quot; may be appropriate.

== Mating ==

Every few days, female &quot;Plathemis lydia&quot; dragonflies will go to ponds in order to oviposit (lay eggs). Male dragonflies that are defending mating territories at the ponds will then attempt to mate with the female dragonflies. While the females are at the pond to oviposit, they will actively discriminate against the males attempting to mate with them, rejecting up to 48.9% of all mating attempts. The females prefer to oviposit in the middle of the day, and will actively look for particular parts of the pond to find a more suitable place to lay their eggs. While male rejection is quite high, mate choice appears to be of little importance. It seems that phenotypic characteristics such as body mass, wing length, and first day of reproduction do not directly affect selection in either males or females. Male-male competition on the other hand is very important, as males fight for territories that offer a better place for females to lay their eggs. This competition for territory leads to a dominance hierarchy, where individual males recognize and maintain territorial boundaries. In this hierarchy, dominant males have an advantage of mating with females over their subordinate counterparts. However, there was no difference in reproductive success of disperser males and non-disperser males. Disperser males are those that leave a territory in search of a new one. The quality of the territory had a larger impact on reproductive success than the duration of time a male spent occupying a single territory. While it is clear that females generally fail to discriminate against males, it is not clear why they do not, given the opportunity. One such reason may be that rapid mating was selected for over evolutionary time. Predation on females during mating periods, as well as risks of males losing their territories during the process of mating also may be important factors as to why females fail to discriminate.

Due to the need to fight off other males in order to be more successful in breeding, male dragonflies have developed extensive flight muscles. The majority of male &quot;Plathemis lydia&quot; dragonflies&#x27; body mass is accounted for by flight muscle, and is one of the highest flight-muscle ratio (FMR, found by flight-muscle mass/body weight) of an animal. Males with smaller FMRs have a slight decrease in mating success when compared to their counterparts. This decrease in success found in males with a smaller FMR can be contributed to a decrease in the ability to compete in aerial contests. However, a tradeoff must be made in order to have a larger FMR. Males that were found to have the highest FMR had the least amount of gut contents, and in turn less fat reserves. This means that the male dragonflies are making a tradeoff between flight ability and longevity, which may affect long-term mating success.
The act of copulation begins with the male clasping the neck of the female. The female then bends her abdomen forward into the secondary genitalia of the male, which is located on the second abdominal segment. Once the female has moved into this position (known as the &quot;wheel position&quot;), the male is able to remove the sperm of any prior mates, and transfer his own sperm to the female. Due to the need for the female to enter the wheel position, males cannot force themselves onto females. Post mating, male &quot;P. lydia&quot; dragonflies will perform &quot;non-contact mate-guarding throughout oviposition&quot;. During this time, the male dragonflies will hover roughly 0.5-1m away from their mate, and chase off any rival males that may be attempting to mate with the female. The intensity at which males guard females is positively correlated with the frequency of male harassment that occurs during the oviposition. However, males tend to guard less intensely over the course of the oviposition process, and will stop guarding entirely once it has finished. This behavior of mate-guarding relates to the territoriality of dragonflies. Oviposit usually follows shortly after the male has transferred his sperm.

Females must find a suitable position to lay their eggs, as there are many factors that affect the success of the eggs. One such factor is temperature. A study found that temperature had incontestable effects on both embryogenic rate and hatching success in &quot;P. lydia&quot; eggs. Female &quot;P. lydia&quot; often deposit their eggs in water, mud, or even vegetation as these are often suitable locations that increase the success of the eggs. Female &quot;P. lydia&quot; employ many strategies when it comes to deciding on a suitable location to deposit their eggs. A female &quot;P. lydia&quot; may deposit her eggs in multiple locations, in order to avoid having all of her eggs eaten at once. Often this involves flipping her eggs with her abdomen so that the eggs are widely dispersed, as shown in the accompanying video. Females may also deposit their eggs in smaller bodies of water, where fish are less likely to occur. Once the eggs have been deposited, female &quot;P. lydia&quot; have limited influence on the survival of offspring because they do not provide parental care.

==Life cycle==
Dragonflies, including &quot;Plathemis lydia&quot;, spend most of their life cycle as aquatic larvae or nymphs, during which there is up to a 99.9% mortality rate. The two most common sources of mortality during the aquatic stage of life are predation and desiccation. &quot;P. lydia&quot; then enter the adult stage of life, which only lasts a few weeks. During the adult stage of life, &quot;P. lydia&quot; mate and select suitable sites to deposit their eggs.

==Anatomy==
&quot;Plathemis lydia&quot; are adapted to swift flight that is made possible by the presence of broad wings and powerful muscles that move them. This means that there is a need for a plentiful supply of oxygen in order to work the muscles. In order to meet this oxygen requirement, &quot;P. lydia&quot; are equipped with a complex tracheal system which belongs to the peripneustic type in which the prothoracic and abdominal stigmata are present but not functional through the larva stage of life. The &quot;P. lydia&quot; nymph is aquatic, and thus do not use their wings during this period of their life, which accounts for the lack of function of the prothoracic and abdominal stigmata.

<doc id="763245" wikidata="Q311798" url="?curid=763245" title="Gaafar Nimeiry">
<text>Gaafar Muhammad an-Nimeiry (otherwise spelled in English as Gaafar Nimeiry, Jaafar Nimeiry, or Ja&#x27;far Muhammad Numayri; ; 1 January 193030 May 2009) was a Sudanese military officer and politician who served as the fourth head of state of Sudan from 1969 to 1985, first as Chairman of the National Revolutionary Command Council and then as President.

A military officer, he came to power after a military coup in 1969. Establishing a one-party state, with his Sudanese Socialist Union as the sole legal political entity in the country, Nimeiry pursued socialist and Pan-Arabist policies and close collaboration with Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt and Muammar Gaddafi of Libya. In 1971 Nimeiry survived a pro-Soviet coup attempt, after which he forged an alliance with Mao Zedong of China, and, eventually, with the United States as well.

In 1972 he signed the Addis Ababa Agreement, ending the First Sudanese Civil War. In his last years in power he also adopted aspects of Islamism, and in 1983 he imposed Sharia law throughout the country, precipitating the Second Sudanese Civil War. He was ousted from power in 1985 and went into exile in Egypt. He returned in 1999 and unsuccessfully ran in the presidential elections in 2000.

==Early life and education==
Nimeiry was educated at the Omdurman primary and elementary school, then in Wad Madani secondary school, and finally in Hantub school that had a British colonial character. He then studied at Khartoum University College, but, as he desired a military career, he eventually graduated from the War College in Omdurman in 1952. He also earned a Master of Military Science from Army Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, United States in 1966.

Nimeiri moved on to different positions in the Sudanese Army. He was accused in 1957 of orchestrating a coup d&#x27;état against the Sudanese government, but there was not enough evidence to prove that he was involved. He was interrogated again about a failed coup attempt led by an officer named Khalid Yusuf, but the investigation did not find anything to criminalize Nimeiry in the attempted coup.

On 28 December 1966, Lieutenant Hussein Osman with other young Communist officers tried to seize the presidential palace and the central post office, but failed. Among the 400 people arrested after the coup attempt failed was Colonel Gaafar Nimeiry, then commanding the Eastern Command. He was released on 9 January 1967 and transferred to command the infantry school.

==1969–1980==

===Early years in power and socialist reforms===
On 25 May 1969, together with four other officers, Colonel Nimeiry, commanding the Khartoum Garrison, overthrew the civilian government of Ismail al-Azhari, his coup being termed the &quot;May Revolution&quot;. He created and chaired the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC). Edgar O&#x27;Ballance, writing in 1977, said that the 14 seniormost officers of the Sudanese Armed Forces were all out of the country at the time &quot;either on official or private visits,&quot; so the &quot;time chosen was opportune.&quot; On 26 May, he suspended the constitution, dissolved the Supreme Council, the National Assembly, and the Civil Service Commission, and ordered that all political parties disband. That day he also promoted himself to major-general, retired 22 serving officers, mostly senior to himself, dismissed over 30, and appointed 14 new officers to the most important posts.

Nimeiry became prime minister later, on 26 October 1969. He started a campaign aimed at reforming Sudan&#x27;s economy through nationalization of banks and industries as well as some land reforms. He used his position to enact a number of socialist and Pan-Arabist reforms.

In March–April 1970 Nimeiry ordered an aerial bombardment on Aba Island which killed several thousand Ansar, who were associated with the Umma Party which opposed him. O&#x27;Ballance writes that about 4,000 troops, plus tanks, stormed Aba Island on 30 March, supported by aircraft.

Later in 1971, he was elected President winning a referendum with 98.6 per cent of the votes. He then dissolved the RCC and founded the Sudanese Socialist Union which he declared to be the only legal political organization. In 1972 he signed the Addis Ababa Agreement whereby autonomy was granted to the non-Muslim southern region of Sudan, which ended the First Sudanese Civil War and ushered in an 11-year period of peace and stability to the region. In 1973 he drafted a new constitution which declared Sudan to be a democratic, socialist state and gave considerable power to the office of President.

===Coup attempts and alliance with China and the West===

In 1970 Nimeiry successfully weathered a coup attempt by former Prime Minister and Umma Party leader Sadiq al-Mahdi, and in 1971 was briefly removed from power by a Communist coup, before being restored. During the 1971 coup attempt, Nimeiry jumped out the window of the place where he was incarcerated when his supporters came to rescue him.

After this coup, he started to move away from Soviet influence and began to receive arms from the US and Maoist China. In April 1972, he signed an agreement with China, by which Chinese military advisers began training the Sudanese Army, and further providing for Chinese sale of J-6 fighter aircraft; Mao Zedong also provided Sudan with interest-free loans, and Chinese state companies began constructing a number of public works in Sudan, including factories, roads, bridges and conference centers. Sudanese collaboration with China continued even after Nimeiry was overthrown in 1985.

In late 1975, a military coup by Communist members of the armed forces, led by Brigadier Hassan Hussein Osman, failed to remove Nimeiry from power. General Elbagir, Nimeiry&#x27;s deputy, led a counter coup that brought Nimeiry back within few hours. Brigadier Osman was wounded and later court martialed and executed.

In the mid-1970s, he launched several initiatives to develop agriculture and industry in Sudan and he invited foreign Western and Chinese companies to explore for oil. Chevron would discover oil reserves in South-Central Sudan in 1979. In general he began a more moderate economic policy, where some banks and industries were returned to private ownership (although the state was still in control of much of the economy) and foreign investment was encouraged, as evidenced by a number of bilateral investment treaties: with the Netherlands 22 August 1970, Switzerland 17 February 1974, Egypt 28 May 1977, and France 31 July 1978. In July 1978 at the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) summit in Khartoum, Nimeiry was elected Chairman of the OAU until July 1979.

=== 1976 Sudanese coup d&#x27;état attempt ===

In 1976, a force of one thousand insurgents under Sadiq al Mahdi, armed and trained by Libya, crossed the border from Ma&#x27;tan as-Sarra. After passing through Darfur and Kordofan, the insurgents engaged in three days of house-to-house fighting in Khartoum and Omdurman that killed some 3,000 people and sparked national resentment against the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. Nimeiry and his government were narrowly saved after a column of army tanks entered the city. Ninety-eight people implicated in the plot were executed.

===National Reconciliation===

In 1977, a National Reconciliation took place between Sadiq al Mahdi, the leader of the opposition who was based abroad, and Nimeiry. A limited measure of pluralism was allowed and Sadiq al Mahdi and members of the Democratic Unionist Party joined the legislature under the umbrella of the Sudan Socialist Union. Hassan al-Turabi, an Islamist leader who had been imprisoned and then exiled after the May Revolution, was invited back and became Justice Minister and Attorney General in 1979. Relations between Khartoum and Southern Sudan leadership worsened after the National Reconciliation and the National Reconciliation itself came to a premature end in light of disagreements between the opposition and Nimeiry.

==1980–1985==

===Second term as president===

Nimeiry was one of only two Arab leaders (the other being Qaboos bin Said of Oman) who maintained close relations with Anwar Sadat after the Camp David Accords of 1978. He attended Sadat&#x27;s funeral in 1981.

In 1981, Nimeiry, pressured by his Islamic opponents, began a dramatic shift toward Islamist political governance and allied himself with the Muslim Brotherhood. In 1983, he declared an &quot;Islamic revolution&quot; and imposed Sharia law, throughout the country. Additionally, he attempted to have himself declared Imam of the Sudanese ummah, but failed. To show his dedication to Sharia, he poured $11 million worth of alcohol into the Nile. The state-wide declaration of Sharia law alienated the predominantly Christian and animist south. In violation of the Addis Ababa Agreement he dissolved the southern Sudanese government and reformed the administrative boundaries of the south into three smaller regions to correspond with the pre-1972 provinces that the south was governed under. This prompted the start of the Second Sudanese Civil War. In 1984 he declared a state of emergency, giving special powers to the military. In 1985 Nimeiry authorised the execution of the peaceful yet controversial political dissident and Islamic reformist Mahmoud Mohammed Taha after Taha — who was first accused of religious sedition in the 1960s when Sudan&#x27;s President was Ismail al-Azhari — had been declared an apostate by a Sudanese court.The alliance with the United States was strengthened under the administration of Ronald Reagan. American aid increased from $5 million in 1979 to $200 million in 1983 and then to $254 million in 1985, mainly for military programs. Sudan thus becomes the second largest recipient of US aid to Africa (after Egypt). The United states constructed four air bases to house Rapid Deployment Force units and a powerful listening station for the CIA near Port Sudan.

In 1984 and 1985, after a period of drought, several million people were threatened by famine, particularly in western Sudan. The government tried to hide the situation internationally.

===Inflation===
Between 1980 and 1985, the Sudanese pound lost 80 percent of its value due to inflation and renewed civil war.

===1985 Revolution===

Political and economic discontent against Nimeiry had been growing for several years prior to 1985. According to a Sudanese individual interviewed by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who said that Nimeiry had &quot;begun to alienate almost every sector of Sudanese society&quot;. Major complaints included the obligatory use of Islamic law throughout Sudan, which upset non-Muslims, especially in the southern part of Sudan, and price increases resulting from an economic austerity program implemented under pressure from the United States (US) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Price increases in late March 1985 were considered to be a major trigger factor for protests. Eight doctors&#x27;, lawyers&#x27; and university lecturers&#x27; associations called for a protest on 3 April and a &quot;general political strike until the abolition of the current regime&quot;. Massive demonstrations took place in Khartoum and around Sudan on 3 April. The general strike took place up to 6 April, when Nimeiry was deposed, with a high effectiveness in shutting down governance of Sudan. The use of massive civil disobedience that led to the coup d&#x27;état deposing Nimeiry from the presidency on 6 April is often referred to as the &quot;1985 Revolution&quot; that followed the Sudanese October 1964 Revolution.

===Exile and return===
On 6 April 1985, while Nimeiry was on an official visit to the United States of America in the hope of gaining more financial aid from Washington, a bloodless military coup led by his defence minister General Abdel Rahman Swar al-Dahab ousted him from power. During the subsequent elections the pro-Islamist leader, Sadiq al-Mahdi was elected Prime Minister.

Nimeiry lived in exile in Egypt from 1985 to 1999, in a villa situated in Heliopolis, Cairo. He returned to Sudan in May 1999 to a rapturous welcome that surprised many of his detractors. The next year, he ran in the presidential election against incumbent president Omar al-Bashir, but did poorly, obtaining only 9.6% of the votes in elections that were boycotted by the Sudanese opposition and alleged to be rigged. In 2005, Nimeiry&#x27;s party, the Alliance of the Peoples&#x27; Working Forces signed a merger agreement with the ruling National Congress of Sudan. The National Congress negotiated an end to the Second Sudanese civil war that was signed in a Comprehensive Peace Agreement on 9 January 2005.

Nimeiry died of natural causes in his home in Omdurman on 30 May 2009. Tens of thousands turned up to his official funeral including members of Sudan&#x27;s political forces that had opposed his rule. After Nimeiry&#x27;s death in May 2009, former Revolutionary Command Council member Khaled Hassan Abbass was elected head of the Alliance of Peoples&#x27; Working Forces. Splits occurred amongst the supporters of Nimeiry with some endorsing the partnership with the National Congress and others alleging that the National Congress reneged on the merger agreement and did not properly implement it. The splinter groups formed the May Socialist Union which took part in the parliamentary elections in Sudan in 2010. Another group led by Professor Dr. Fatima Abdel Mahmoud set up the Sudanese Socialist Democratic Union Party as the successor party of the Sudanese Socialist Union. Abdel Mahmoud was the first woman cabinet Minister in Sudan in the 1970s, and the first Sudanese woman to contest the presidency in the 2010 Sudanese election.

<text>Mishnaic Hebrew () is the Hebrew language used in Talmudic texts. Mishnaic Hebrew can be sub-divided into Mishnaic Hebrew proper (c. 1–200 CE, also called Tannaitic Hebrew, Early Rabbinic Hebrew, or Mishnaic Hebrew I), which was a spoken language, and Amoraic Hebrew (c. 200 to 500 CE, also called Late Rabbinic Hebrew or Mishnaic Hebrew II), which was a literary language only.

The Mishnaic Hebrew language, or Early Rabbinic Hebrew language, is one of the direct ancient descendants of Biblical Hebrew as preserved after the Babylonian captivity, and definitively recorded by Jewish sages in writing the Mishnah and other contemporary documents. 

A transitional form of the language occurs in the other works of Tannaitic literature dating from the century beginning with the completion of the Mishnah. These include the halakhic midrashim (&quot;Sifra&quot;, &quot;Sifre&quot;, &quot;Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael&quot;, etc.) and the expanded collection of Mishnah-related material known as the Tosefta. The Talmud contains excerpts from these works and further Tannaitic material not attested elsewhere; the generic term for these passages is baraitot. The language of all these works is very similar to Mishnaic Hebrew.

==Historical occurrence==
Mishnaic Hebrew is found primarily from the first to the fourth centuries, corresponding to the Roman period after the destruction of the Second Temple in the Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE). It developed under the profound influence of Middle Aramaic. Also called Tannaitic Hebrew or Early Rabbinic Hebrew, it is represented by the bulk of the Mishnah (, published around 200) and the Tosefta within the Talmud, and by some of the Dead Sea Scrolls, notably the Copper Scroll and the Bar Kokhba Letters.

Archaeologist Yigael Yadin mentions that three Bar Kokhba revolt documents he and his team found in the Cave of Letters are written in Mishnaic Hebrew and that it was Simon bar Kokhba who revived Hebrew and made it the official language of the state during the revolt (132–135). Yadin also notes a shift from Aramaic to Hebrew in Judea during the time of the Bar Kokhba revolt:
 Sigalit Ben-Zion remarks, &quot;[I]t seems that this change came as a result of the order that was given by Bar Kokhba, who wanted to revive the Hebrew language and make it the official language of the state.&quot;

However, less than a century after the publication of the Mishnah, Hebrew began to fall into disuse as a spoken language. The Gemara (, circa 500 in Lower Mesopotamia), as well as the earlier Jerusalem Talmud published between 350 and 400, generally comment on the Mishnah and Baraitot in Middle Aramaic. Nevertheless, Hebrew survived as a liturgical and literary language in the form of later Amoraic Hebrew, which sometimes occurs in the Gemara text. 
==Phonology==
Many of the characteristic features of Mishnaic Hebrew pronunciation may have already been found in the Late Biblical Hebrew period. A notable characteristic distinguishing it from Biblical Hebrew of the classical period is begadkefat, the spirantization of the post-vocalic stops b, g, d, p, t, and k, which it has in common with Aramaic.

While this process began in Aramaic as early as the 7th century BCE, spirantisation in Hebrew was a much later process. The spirantisation of p and b happened early in the Second Temple period, followed by t and d at some later point. The appearance of fricativised k and g only happened in Amoraic Hebrew. It did not appear before the merger of the consonants [ḫ] with [ḥ] and [ġ] with [ʿ] by the 1st century. Samaritan Hebrew, which split off from Judean and Galilean varieties in the Roman period, did not undergo fricativisation of k and g at all.

A new characteristic is that final /m/ is often replaced with final /n/ in the Mishna (see Bava Kamma 1:4, &quot;&quot;), but only in agreement morphemes. Perhaps the final nasal consonant in the morphemes was not pronounced, and the vowel previous to it was nasalized. Alternatively, the agreement morphemes may have changed under the influence of Aramaic.

Some surviving manuscripts of the &quot;Mishna&quot; confuse guttural consonants, especially aleph () (a glottal stop) and ʿayin () (a voiced pharyngeal fricative). That could signify that they were pronounced the same way in Amoraic Hebrew. Loss of a distinction in these two letters as well as between heth and he are also associated with Galilean Hebrew speakers in the Tannaitic period, a source of frequent criticism by Judean writers.

==Morphology==
Mishnaic Hebrew displays various changes from Biblical Hebrew, some appearing already in the Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Some, but not all, are retained in Modern Hebrew.

For the expression of possession, Mishnaic Hebrew mostly replaces the construct state with analytic constructions involving &#x27;of&#x27;.

Mishnaic Hebrew lacks the waw-consecutive.

The past is expressed by using the same form as in Modern Hebrew. For example, &quot;Pirqe Avoth&quot; 1:1: &quot;Moses received the Torah from Sinai&quot;.

Continuous past is expressed using the past tense of &quot;to be&quot; + participle, unlike Biblical Hebrew. For example, &quot;Pirqe Avoth&quot; 1:2: &quot;He often said&quot;.

Present is expressed using the same form as in Modern Hebrew, by using the participle (). For example, &quot;Pirqe Avoth&quot; 1:2 &quot;The world is sustained by three things&quot;, lit. &quot;On three things the world stands&quot;.

Future can be expressed using + infinitive. For example, &quot;Pirqe Avoth&quot; 3:1: . However, unlike Modern Hebrew but like contemporary Aramaic, the present active participle can also express the future. It mostly replaces the imperfect (prefixed) form in that function.

The imperfect (prefixed) form, which is used for the future in modern Hebrew, expresses an imperative (order), volition or similar meanings in Mishnaic Hebrew (the prefixed form is also used to express an imperative in Modern Hebrew). For example, &quot;Pirqe Avot&quot; 1:3: &quot;He would say, don&#x27;t be like slaves serving the master...&quot;, lit. &quot;...you will not be...&quot;. In a sense, one could say that the form pertains to the future in Mishnaic Hebrew as well, but it invariably has a modal (imperative, volitional, etc.) aspect in the main clause.

<doc id="763256" wikidata="Q313528" url="?curid=763256" title="Pier Luigi Nervi">
<text>Pier Luigi Nervi (21 June 1891 – 9 January 1979) was an Italian engineer and architect. He studied at the University of Bologna graduating in 1913. Nervi taught as a professor of engineering at Rome University from 1946 to 1961 and is known worldwide as a structural engineer and architect and for his innovative use of reinforced concrete, especially with numerous notable thin shell structures worldwide.

== Biography ==
Nervi was born in Sondrio and attended the Civil Engineering School of Bologna from which he graduated in 1913; his formal education was quite similar to that experienced today by Italian civil engineering students.
After graduating he joined the Society for Concrete Construction and, during World War I from 1915 to 1918, he served in the Corps of Engineering of the Italian Army. 
From 1961 to 1962 he was the Norton professor at Harvard University.

==Civil engineering works==

Nervi began practicing civil engineering after 1923. His projects in the 1930s included several airplane hangars that were important for his development as an engineer. A set of hangars in Orvieto (1935) were built entirely out of reinforced concrete, and a second set in Orbetello and Torre del Lago (1939) improved the design by using a lighter roof, precast ribs, and a modular construction method.

During the 1940s he developed ideas for reinforced concrete which helped in the rebuilding of many buildings and factories throughout Western Europe, and even designed and created a boat hull that was made of reinforced concrete as a promotion for the Italian government.

Nervi also stressed that intuition should be used as much as mathematics in design, especially with thin shell structures. He borrowed from both Roman and Renaissance architecture while applying ribbing and vaulting to improve strength and eliminate columns. He combined simple geometry and prefabrication to innovate design solutions.

==Engineer and architect==
Nervi was educated and practised as an &quot;ingegnere edile&quot; (translated as &quot;building engineer&quot;) – in Italy. At the time (and to a lesser degree also today), a building engineer might also be considered an architect. After 1932, his aesthetically pleasing designs were used for major projects. This was due to the booming number of construction projects at the time which used concrete and steel in Europe and the architecture aspect took a step back to the potential of engineering. Nervi successfully made reinforced concrete the main structural material of the day. Nervi expounded his ideas on building in four books (see below) and many learned papers.

Archeological excavations suggested that he may have some responsibilities for the Flaminio stadium foundations passing through ancient Roman tombs. His work was also part of the architecture event in the art competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics.

==International projects==
Most of his built structures are in his native Italy, but he also worked on projects abroad. Nervi&#x27;s first project in the United States was the George Washington Bridge Bus Station, for which he designed the roof, which consists of triangular pieces that were cast in place. This building is still used today by over 700 buses and their passengers.

<text>The Portage Lake Lift Bridge (officially the Houghton–Hancock Bridge) connects the cities of Hancock and Houghton, in the US state of Michigan. It crosses Portage Lake, a portion of the waterway which cuts across the Keweenaw Peninsula with a canal linking the final several miles to Lake Superior to the northwest. US Highway 41 (US 41) and M-26 are both routed across the bridge. It is the only land-based link between the north (so-called Copper Island) and south sections of the Keweenaw peninsula. In June 2022, it was dedicated as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.

This moveable bridge is a lift bridge with the middle section capable of being lifted from its low point of four feet clearance over the water to a clearance of to allow boats to pass underneath. The bridge is the world&#x27;s heaviest and widest double-decked vertical-lift bridge. More than 35,000 tons of concrete and 7,000 tons of steel went into the bridge, which replaced the narrow 54-year-old swing bridge, declared a menace to navigation on the busy Keweenaw Waterway.

Hancock and Houghton hold an annual celebration called Bridgefest to commemorate the opening of the bridge which united their two communities.

== History ==
The original bridge on the same site was a wooden swing bridge built in 1875. The bridge was built by James P. Edward of Fox and Howard Inc. of Chicago. Three local men raised $47,000 in stocks for the toll bridge. Construction began in the spring of 1875 and was finished in the spring of 1876. This was replaced by a steel swing bridge, the Portage Canal Swing Bridge, built by the King Bridge Company in 1895. The Portage Canal Swing Bridge was damaged when a ship, the Northern Wave, collided with it in 1905. The center swinging section of the bridge was replaced and a similar incident almost occurred again in 1920, but the ship was able to stop by dropping its anchor, which snagged on the bottom of the canal. In 1959, the Portage Canal Swing Bridge was replaced, at a cost of about $11-13 million (sources vary), by the current bridge. The Al Johnson Construction Company was the general contractor. The American Bridge Company built the superstructure and Bethlehem Steel provided the structural steel.
The original 1959 design by Hazelet and Erdal of Chicago of the bridge&#x27;s liftspan had roadways constructed on both levels with rails embedded in the road surface on the lower deck. This allowed the span to be partially raised to allow small and medium boat traffic to pass underneath without disrupting vehicular traffic. From this middle position, the span would then only need to be raised for large ships or lowered to allow trains to cross. With the end of rail service in 1982, the lowest position is no longer needed to allow trains to pass so the bridge is not lowered below the middle position during the summer boating season except for periods of maintenance or repair. In the winter after the lake freezes, the bridge is placed in the lowest position to allow the lower deck to be used by snowmobile traffic.

<doc id="763259" wikidata="Q1145479" url="?curid=763259" title="Dissection (band)">
<text>Dissection was a Swedish extreme metal band from Strömstad, formed in 1989 by guitarist, vocalist and main songwriter Jon Nödtveidt and bassist Peter Palmdahl. Despite a number of lineup changes, Dissection released &quot;The Somberlain&quot; in 1993 and &quot;Storm of the Light&#x27;s Bane&quot; in 1995, before splitting up in 1997 due to Nödtveidt&#x27;s imprisonment for complicity in the murder of Josef Meddour.

After his release, Nödtveidt reformed the band in 2004 with new members who he felt could &quot;stand behind and live up to the demands of Dissection&#x27;s Satanic concept.&quot; They released their third and final full-length album &quot;Reinkaos&quot; in April 2006, before disbanding that June. Nödtveidt said he had &quot;reached the limitations of music as a tool for expressing what I want to express, for myself and the handful of others that I care about.&quot; Two months later, Nödtveidt committed suicide with a gun inside a circle of lit candles in his apartment in Hässelby.

Dissection released a number of live albums and EPs before its final dissolution, and played a central role in the development of Sweden&#x27;s black metal and death metal scenes, particularly through the influence of the first two albums; it has sometimes been described as part of the Gothenburg scene.

== History ==

=== First era ===
In 1988, a thrash metal band by the name of Siren’s Yell was formed in the Swedish town of Strömstad. Its members were Jon Nödtveidt, Ole Öhman, Peter Palmdahl, and Mattias &quot;Mäbe&quot; Johansson. The group recorded a single demo before breaking up in 1989. Nödtveidt joined the band Rabbit’s Carrot, where Öhman played drums. Nödtveidt and Öhman &quot;were never very comfortable in Rabbit&#x27;s Carrot, which also explains their short time in that band, as they wanted the music and lyrics to evolve on the extreme dark side. Jon would write songs and arrange them together with Ole in the rehearsal place, but the other members didn&#x27;t feel that the material would fit the band.&quot; In autumn 1989, Jon Nödtveidt formed Dissection together with Palmdahl on bass. In the spring of 1990, they recruited drummer Öhman. In April 1990, the first official rehearsal tape &quot;Severed into Shreds&quot; was recorded and sent to underground fanzines worldwide &quot;to mark the birth of Dissection, a band that was about to make heavy impact on the scene&quot;. The band recruited former Siren’s Yell bassist Mattias &quot;Mäbe&quot; Johansson, who was now playing with the local death/thrash metal band Nosferatu, as a live session member playing rhythm guitar. Dissection’s first concert was held in October 1990 with death metal act Entombed.

In December 1990, the band recorded and released the demo &quot;The Grief Prophecy&quot;. It contained three songs and featured illustrations by the artist known as Necrolord, who later created most Dissection album artworks.

In January 1991, second guitarist John Zwetsloot joined the band, which now had a complete line-up &quot;and could further develop their characteristic dual-harmony guitar-sound that was to become an important part of the band&#x27;s sound&quot;. The first concert with Zwetsloot was held in February 1991 at a local death metal event in the band’s hometown Strömstad. As the demo was spreading in the underground scene, the French record label Corpsegrinder Records offered Dissection a deal to record an EP.

In April 1991, Dead, the notorious Norwegian black metal group Mayhem’s vocalist, committed suicide. A few days later, Dissection played the Mayhem song &quot;Freezing Moon&quot; in honor of Dead at a show in Falkenberg, Sweden, and made an unofficial special edition of &quot;The Grief Prophecy&quot; demo with a cover drawn by Dead. In September 1991, the band record three new tracks for the 7-inch EP &quot;Into Infinite Obscurity&quot;, released in December 1991 by Corpsegrinder Records in a limited edition of 1000 copies. In December 1991 Nödtveidt and Öhman also played live in Askim, Norway, at a black metal concert arranged by the Norwegian Black Circle Nödtveidt had joined, and Euronymous, who led the Circle and the band Mayhem. Nödtveidt, Öhman and Euronymous performed &quot;Freezing Moon&quot; live.

In 1992, Dissection recorded a four-track promo tape and signed a one-album deal with No Fashion Records. In March 1993, the band recorded the full-length album &quot;The Somberlain&quot;, recorded and mixed at Hellspawn/Unisound studios with Dan Swanö. During that time, the band’s members, who were temporarily living in different towns, all moved to Gothenburg after the summer of 1993, where they shared a steady rehearsal place with At the Gates. The album was released in December 1993 and dedicated to Euronymous, who had been murdered earlier the same year.

As the band members found themselves rehearsing more and more without Zwetsloot and had to cancel shows because he did not show up for the preparing rehearsals, the band were forced to kick the guitarist. The last concert with Zwetsloot was performed in Oslo, Norway, on 14 April 1994. The day Zwetsloot was fired, Dissection contacted Johan Norman from Satanized (a short-lived project Nödtveidt was involved with), who showed up a day later and was deemed a worthy and motivated successor by the band. Dissection continued playing live, wrote songs for a second album, and entered the studio twice to record demos of new songs and the contribution &quot;Anti-Christ&quot; for the Slayer tribute compilation album &quot;Slatanic Slaughter&quot; on Black Sun Records. In November 1994, Dissection signed a deal with Nuclear Blast and focused on the second album. In March 1995, the band returned to the Hellspawn/Unisound studios to record their second full-length, followed by a three date tour through the UK with Cradle of Filth and a few concerts in Sweden.

During the summer of 1995, Nödtveidt and Norman joined the newly formed Satanic organization Misanthropic Luciferian Order (MLO, now known as Temple of the Black Light). In September 1995 drummer Ole Öhman left Dissection and was replaced by Tobias Kellgren (ex-Satanized). He was introduced to the Swedish fans at a show with Morbid Angel at Kåren in Gothenburg, 10 October 1995.

In November 1995, Dissection&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Storm of the Light’s Bane&quot;, was released by Nuclear Blast, followed by a two-week European tour through Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Switzerland and Sweden in December 1995, and the World Tour of the Light’s Bane covering Europe and America, ending in 1997.

By the beginning of January 1996, Dissection was playing shows in Sweden before leaving for a UK tour with At the Gates in February, followed by a vast US tour with At the Gates and Morbid Angel in March. Back in Scandinavia, Dissection played at the Rockefeller in Oslo together with Darkthrone and Satyricon, marking the start of a co-headlining European tour. In April, in connection with the co-headlining European tour, Dissection released the &quot;Where Dead Angels Lie&quot; MCD, which contained the title track’s studio and demo version as well as other demo recordings and two cover songs.

In 1997, Dissection played the Gods of Darkness tour together with Cradle of Filth, In Flames and Dimmu Borgir. Dissection’s and Dimmu Borgir’s show at the Live Music Hall in Cologne, Germany, on 31 March 1997, was recorded and released by Nuclear Blast on the live split video cassette &quot;Live &amp; Plugged Vol. II&quot;. Dissection’s World Tour of the Light&#x27;s Bane ended with an appearance at the Wacken Open Air festival, which was recorded and released on the &quot;Live Legacy&quot; album, and the Nuclear Blast festivals.

Although &quot;[t]he first era of Dissection was now at its peak&quot; and &quot;the situation, at least on the surface, seemed to be stable and prosperous with the band&#x27;s success peaking, personal differences prevailed&quot;. This resulted in Palmdahl leaving the band and being replaced by Jon Nödtveidt&#x27;s brother Emil for the summer festivals. After the summer Norman &quot;suddenly &#x27;disappeared&#x27; for several months without notice, with Tobias covering up for him claiming to know nothing (however remaining in close contact with Johan throughout this period). The background of this &#x27;disappearance&#x27; being that Johan had turned his back on and betrayed the MLO, fearing their retribution.&quot; As Nödtveidt was a member of MLO, Norman had also left Dissection behind, Nödtveidt being the only member left in the band. He recruited a new line-up and booked Studio Fredman for the planned recording of their third studio album.

====Nödtveidt&#x27;s murder conviction====

On 18 December 1997, Nödtveidt and fellow MLO member Vlad (Victor Draconi, aka. Frater Nemidial, then known as Shahin Nemesis Khoshnood-Sharis) were arrested for the murder of a 37-year-old homosexual man, Josef ben Meddour, on 22 July 1997. Nödtveidt received a 10-year sentence, and Necropolis Records released the compilation album &quot;The Past Is Alive (The Early Mischief)&quot;. Vlad/Draconi is since 2005 owner of the Dissection trademark, registered with the Swedish Intellectual Property Office.

=== Rebirth ===
Upon his release in 2004, Nödtveidt restarted the band with a completely new line-up, including only members able to &quot;stand behind and live up to the demands of Dissection&#x27;s Satanic concept&quot;. Dissection recorded a two-track EP entitled &quot;Maha Kali&quot; and toured heavily with the &quot;Rebirth of Dissection&quot; tour.

In 2006, Dissection released their third full-length album &quot;Reinkaos&quot; through their own label, in association with The End Records. The band followed the teachings of the MLO, and the lyrics in the &quot;Reinkaos&quot; album contain magical formulae from the &quot;Liber Azerate&quot;, and are based on the organisation&#x27;s teachings.

=== Breakup ===
In May 2006, shortly after the release of &quot;Reinkaos&quot;, the band announced plans to split following a short tour. The tour was scheduled to include two appearances in the United States, but these were eventually canceled after Nödtveidt was denied an entry visa to the country, due to his previous incarceration. The band played its final European concert in Stockholm on Midsummer, 24 June 2006. Some former members of Dissection have gone on to form other bands, also influenced by their beliefs based on the MLO.

=== Nödtveidt’s suicide ===
On 13 August 2006, frontman Jon Nödtveidt committed suicide. According to the Swedish &quot;Expressen&quot;, the police said that Nödtveidt was found with a Satanic Bible in front of him, which Blabbermouth.net falsely reported to be a copy of &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;. It was later confirmed by band member Set Teitan to be a Satanic grimoire, which is believed to be a copy of the &quot;Liber Azerate&quot; written by Frater Nemidial, leader of the MLO. With Nödtveidt&#x27;s death, any possibility to realize a reunion was lost, as he had remained the only original member since Dissection&#x27;s foundation; in fact, second founding member Peter Palmdahl had left the band in 1997, when Nödtveidt was arrested.

== Musical style ==
Deathmetal.org notes how the band mixed the extreme style of death metal and black metal with &quot;the 1970s style of melodic rock that Iron Maiden popularized and developed&quot;, and according to Daniel Ekeroth the band &quot;developed their own melancholic and atmospheric death metal style&quot;, which &quot;combine[d] strong melodies with musical brutality&quot;.

Dissection considered the &quot;characteristic dual-harmony guitar-sound&quot; to be &quot;an important part of the band&#x27;s sound&quot; and therefore needed a second guitarist. Due to the band&#x27;s turn towards melodic death metal, Tomas &quot;Tompa&quot; Lindberg sees Dissection as a part of the Gothenburg scene.

Dissection were one of the first bands to cross black metal with melodic death metal; due to this, &quot;Metal Injection&quot; has described them as being one of the biggest bands in the melodic black-death genre.

== Involvement in MLO ==

The lead vocalist of Dissection, Jon Nödtveidt, was a member of the Misanthropic Luciferian Order founded in 1995. Nödtveidt was introduced to the organisation by close friends at a quite early stage.

When the police investigated the MLO after the murder of Josef ben Meddour, they interrogated its former members, who described the organisation and narrated the occult ceremonies they had attended. Rituals included meditation, invocations of demons and animal sacrifices – cats, which were bought through classified ads. During the weeks that preceded the murder of Josef ben Meddour, Vlad had been more and more extremist in his speech, and the idea of performing human sacrifices, followed by a mass suicide, was discussed at length. During a meeting at Nödtveidt&#x27;s place, a list of possible victims was made. It included a former follower who had defected, band members from Dissection, and even Nödtveidt&#x27;s girlfriend.

Nödtveidt said of the MLO in an interview: &quot;MLO is a Chaos-Gnostic order, which seek the true light of Lucifer through the study, development and practice of all dark, gnostic and Satanic magical systems. Our goal is to create a synthesis between the dark traditions of all aeons, this way creating the occult keys that shall open the gates to the forthcoming endless dark aeon. My status within the order is the one of a full member of the second grade and a Priest of Satan. To become a candidate one must first of all already be an Anti-cosmic Satanist and actively practicing black magician. He/She must wholeheartedly sympathize and share the misanthropic and anti-cosmic values of the order, and then be ready to dedicate his/her entire existence to following his/her true will in accordance to the dark gods. Becoming an initiate is a long and hard process and can take several years.&quot;

Some members of Dissection were very involved in the Misanthropic Luciferian Order. Former bassist, Haakon Forwald of Disiplin, pulled out of Dissection, saying it was partly in order to concentrate on his esoteric studies.

<doc id="763272" wikidata="Q2740724" url="?curid=763272" title="Ashkenazi Hebrew">
<text>Ashkenazi Hebrew (, ) is the pronunciation system for Biblical and Mishnaic Hebrew favored for Jewish liturgical use and Torah study by Ashkenazi Jewish practice.

==Features==
As it is used parallel with Modern Hebrew, its phonological differences are clearly recognized:
* &quot;aleph&quot; and &quot;ayin&quot; are completely silent at all times in most forms of Ashkenazi Hebrew. In other dialects of Hebrew, they can be pronounced as a glottal stop. Compare &quot;Yisroeil&quot; (Lithuanian) or &quot;Yisruayl&quot; (Polish-Galician) vs. &quot;Yisra&#x27;el&quot; (Israeli). An earlier pronunciation of &quot;ayin&quot; as a velar nasal () is attested most prominently in Dutch Hebrew (and historically also the Hebrew of Frankfurt am Main). Vestiges of this earlier pronunciation are still found throughout the Yiddish-speaking world in names like &quot;Yankev&quot; (יעקבֿ) and words like &quot;manse&quot; (מעשׂה, more commonly pronounced &quot;mayse&quot;), but are otherwise marginal.
* ungeminated &quot;&quot; is pronounced in Ashkenazi Hebrew. It is always pronounced in Modern and Sephardi Hebrew. Compare &quot;Shabbos&quot; vs. &quot;Shabbat&quot;.
* &quot;tzere&quot; is pronounced or in Ashkenazi Hebrew, where it would be pronounced in Sephardi Hebrew; Modern Hebrew varies between the two pronunciations. Compare &quot;Omein&quot; (Lithuanian) or &quot;Umayn&quot; (Polish-Galician) vs. &quot;Amen&quot; (Israeli Hebrew).
* &quot;kamatz gadol&quot; is generally pronounced , as in Yemenite and Tiberian Hebrew. In southern dialects it is in open syllables and in closed syllables, whilst in Lithuanian pronunciation it may be [ʌ].The Israeli Hebrew pronunciation is invariably . Compare &quot;Dovid&quot; (Lithuanian) or &quot;Duvid&quot; (Polish-Galician) vs. &quot;David&quot; (Israeli Hebrew)
* אָ‎ kamatz katan is pronounced the same as kamatz gadol in Ashkenazic pronunciation. 
* &quot;cholam&quot; is, depending on the subdialect, pronounced , , , , or in Ashkenazi Hebrew, as against in Sephardic and Modern Hebrew. However, in many regions in Germany it was pronounced ), and it is pronounced that way by many non-Hassidic Ashkenazim in America. Compare &quot;Moishe&quot; vs. &quot;Moshe&quot;.
* Unstressed &quot;kubutz&quot; or &quot;shuruk&quot; occasionally becomes in Ashkenazi Hebrew, when in all other forms they are pronounced . This is more prevalent in the South-Eastern dialects. In the Hungarian and Oberlander dialects, the pronunciation is invariably .

==Variants==

There are considerable differences between the Lithuanian, Polish (also known as Galician), Hungarian, and German pronunciations.
*These are most obvious in the treatment of &quot;cholam&quot;: the northern German pronunciation is , the southern German pronunciation is , the Galician/Polish pronunciation is , the Hungarian is , and the Lithuanian pronunciation is . Other variants exist: for example in the United Kingdom, the original tradition was to use the northern German pronunciation, but over the years the sound of &quot;ḥolam&quot; has tended to merge with the local pronunciation of long &quot;o&quot; as in &quot;toe&quot; (more similar to the southern German pronunciation), and some communities have abandoned Ashkenazi Hebrew altogether in favour of the Israeli pronunciation. (Many Haredi communities in England use the Galician/Polish , although some - such as Golders Green Beth Hamedrash - have preserved one of the German pronunciations.)
*&quot;Tzere&quot; is pronounced in the majority of Ashkenazic traditions. In Polish usage, however, it was not infrequently .
*&quot;Segol&quot; is pronounced in the majority of Ashkenazic traditions, but in Southeastern pronunciations in a stressed syllable (Polish, Galician, etc.).
*Another feature that distinguishes the Lithuanian pronunciation, traditionally used in an area encompassing modern day&#x27;s Baltic States, Belarus and parts of Ukraine and Russia, is an occasional merger of &quot;sin&quot; and &quot;shin&quot;, both of which are pronounced as . This is similar to the pronunciation of the Ephraimites recorded in Judges 12, which is the source of the term Shibboleth. This has been referred to as Sabesdiker losn or &#x27;Shabbos speech&#x27;.
*The pronunciation of &quot;resh&quot; varies between an alveolar flap or trill (as in Spanish) and a voiced uvular fricative or trill (as in French, see Guttural R), depending on variations in the local dialects of German and Yiddish.

In addition to geographical differences, there are differences in register between the &quot;natural&quot; pronunciation in general use and the more prescriptive rules advocated by some rabbis and grammarians, particularly for use in reading the Torah. For example:

* In earlier centuries the stress in Ashkenazi Hebrew usually fell on the penultimate, instead of the last syllable as in most other dialects. In the 17th and 18th centuries there was a campaign by Ashkenazi rabbis such as Jacob Emden and the Vilna Gaon to encourage final stress in accordance with the stress marks printed in the Bible. This was successful in concerned liturgical use such as reading from the Torah. However, the older stress pattern persists in the colloquial pronunciation of Hebrew words. It is also prevalent in early modern poetry by poets such as Hayim Nahman Bialik and Shaul Tchernichovsky. The use of penultimate stress has led to the weakening of the final syllables of many words, often to schwa, such as in the words &quot;shabbos&quot;, &quot;kiddush&quot; and &quot;sukkah&quot;.
* Many authorities, from the Talmudic period on (b. Megillah 24b, y. Berakhot 2:4, b. Berakhot 32a) and into the modern era (such as the Mishnah Berurah and Magen Avraham) advocate using the pharyngeal articulation of and when representing the community in religious service such as prayer and Torah reading though this is seldom observed in practice. Similarly, strict usage requires the articulation of initial as a glottal stop.
* In general use, the mobile &quot;sheva&quot; is often omitted (for example the word for &quot;time&quot; is pronounced &quot;zman&quot; rather than &quot;zĕman&quot;). However, in liturgical use strict conformity to the grammatical rules is encouraged.

==History==
In brief, Ashkenazi Hebrew appears to be a descendant of the Babylonian tradition, partially adapted to accommodate Tiberian notation, and further influenced by the pronunciation of Middle German and its sound changes as it evolved into Yiddish.

The origins of the different Hebrew reading traditions reflect older differences between the pronunciations of Hebrew and Middle Aramaic current in different parts of the Fertile Crescent: Judea, the Galilee, Greater Syria, Upper Mesopotamia, and Lower Mesopotamia (&quot;Babylonia&quot;). In the time of the Masoretes (8th-10th centuries), there were three distinct notations for denoting vowels and other details of pronunciation in biblical and liturgical texts. One was the Babylonian; another was the Palestinian Hebrew; still another was Tiberian Hebrew, which eventually superseded the other two and is still in use today. By the time of Saadia Gaon and Jacob Qirqisani, Palestinian Hebrew had come to be regarded as standard, even in Babylonia. That development roughly coincided with the popularisation of the Tiberian notation.

The 14th century work &quot;Sefer Asufot&quot; is one of the only non-liturgical and non-Biblical medieval Ashkenazi texts to use nequddot. Owing to its more day-to-day vocabulary, linguists have been able to conclude that medieval Ashkenazi Hebrew was akin to contemporary Sephardi Hebrew.

In other respects, Ashkenazi Hebrew resembles Yemenite Hebrew, which appears to be related to the Babylonian notation. Shared features include the pronunciation of &quot;qamaṣ gadol&quot; as and, in the case of Litvaks and some but not all Yemenites, of &quot;ḥolam&quot; as . These features are not found in the Hebrew pronunciation of North Mesopotamian Jews, which has been overlaid by Sephardi Hebrew practices, but are found in some of the Judeo-Aramaic languages of Upper Mesopotamia and in some dialects of Syriac.

Several pre-modern scholars among European Jewry, including Judah Loew ben Bezalel, Jacob Emden, and several others, argued that Ashkenazi Hebrew is the most accurate pronunciation of Hebrew preserved. The reason given is that it preserves distinctions, such as between &quot;pataḥ&quot; and &quot;qamaṣ&quot;, which are not reflected in the Sephardic and other dialects. Only in the Ashkenazi pronunciation are all seven &quot;nequdot&quot; (the Hebrew vowels of the ancient Tiberian tradition) distinguished: Yemenite, which comes close, does not distinguish &quot;pataḥ&quot; from &quot;segol&quot;.

==Influence on Modern Hebrew==

Although Modern Hebrew was intended to be based on Mishnaic spelling and Sephardi Hebrew pronunciation, the language as spoken in Israel has adapted to the popular (as opposed to the strict liturgical) Ashkenazi Hebrew phonology in the following respects:

*the pronunciation of &quot;tzere&quot; as [eɪ] in some contexts, (&quot;sifrey&quot; and &quot;teysha&quot; instead of Sephardic &quot;sifré&quot; and &quot;tésha&quot;&#x27; ) for some speakers.
*the elimination of vocal &quot;sheva&quot; (&quot;zman&quot; instead of Sephardic &quot;zĕman&quot;)
*some of the letter names (&quot;yud&quot; and &quot;kuf&quot; instead of Sephardic &quot;yod&quot; and &quot;qof/kof&quot;)
*in popular speech, penultimate stress in some proper names (&quot;Dvóra&quot; instead of &quot;Dĕvorá&quot;; &quot;Yehúda&quot; instead of &quot;Yehudá&quot;) for some speakers.
*similarly, penultimate stress in nouns or verbs with a second- or third-person plural suffix (&quot;katávtem&quot; [you wrote] instead of &quot;kĕtavtém&quot;; &quot;shalom aléykhem&quot; [greeting] instead of &quot;shalom alekhém&quot;).
*The use of Guttural R instead of the intended/biblical alveolar trill

<doc id="763275" wikidata="Q2071345" url="?curid=763275" title="Tiberian Hebrew">
<text>Tiberian Hebrew is the canonical pronunciation of the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) committed to writing by Masoretic scholars living in the Jewish community of Tiberias in ancient Galilee under the Abbasid Caliphate. They wrote in the form of Tiberian vocalization, which employed diacritics added to the Hebrew letters: vowel signs and consonant diacritics (nequdot) and the so-called accents (two related systems of cantillation signs or &quot;te&#x27;amim&quot;). These together with the marginal notes masora magna and masora parva make up the Tiberian apparatus.

Although the written vowels and accents came into use in around 750 CE, the oral tradition that they reflect is many centuries older, with ancient roots.

== Sources ==
Today&#x27;s Hebrew grammar books do not teach the Tiberian Hebrew that was described by the early grammarians. The prevailing view is that of David Qimḥi&#x27;s system of dividing the graphic signs into &quot;short&quot; and &quot;long&quot; vowels. The values assigned to the Tiberian vowel signs reveals a Sephardi tradition of pronunciation (the dual quality of qameṣ () as , ; the pronunciation of simple shva () as ).

The phonology of Tiberian Hebrew can be gleaned from the collation of various sources:
* The Aleppo Codex of the Hebrew Bible and ancient manuscripts of the Tanakh cited in the margins of early codices, all of which preserve direct evidence in a graphic manner of the application of vocalization rules such as the widespread use of reduced vowels where one would expect simple shva, thus clarifying the color of the vowel pronounced under certain circumstances. Most striking is the use of reduced ḥireq in five words under a consonant that follows a guttural vocalized with regular ḥireq (as described by Israel Yeivin) as well as the anomalous use of the rafe over letters that do not belong to or .
* The explicit statements found in grammars of the 10th and the 11th centuries, including the &quot;Sēfer haq-Qoloṯ&quot; of Moshe ben Asher (published by N. Allony); the &quot;Sēfer Diqduqē haṭ-Ṭe&#x27;amim&quot; ( Grammar or Analysis of the Accents) of Aaron ben Moses ben Asher; the anonymous works entitled &quot;Horayaṯ haq-Qorē&quot; (G. Khan and Ilan Eldar attribute it to the Karaite Jew Aaron of Jerusalem); the &quot;Treatise on the Schwa&quot; (published by Kurt Levy from a genizah fragment in 1936), and &quot;Ma&#x27;mar haš-Šəwā&quot; (published from Genizah material by Allony); the works of medieval Sephardi grammarians, including Abraham ibn Ezra and Judah ben David Hayyuj. In the case of the latter two, it is evident that the chain of transmission is breaking down or that their interpretations are influenced by local tradition.
* Ancient manuscripts that preserve similar dialects of Hebrew or Jewish Palestinian Aramaic vocalized with Tiberian niqqud that reveal a phonetic spelling rather than a phonemic spelling. They include the so-called &quot;pseudo-Ben Naphtali&quot; or &quot;Palestinian-Sephardi&quot; vocalized manuscripts, which generally conform to the rules enumerated below, such as pronouncing &quot;sheva&quot; as before consonantal yod, as in .
* Other traditions include Palestinian vocalization and (to a lesser extent) Babylonian (Mesopotamian) vocalization. Each community (Palestinian, Tiberian, Babylonian) developed systems of notation for pronunciation in each dialect, some of which are common among the traditions.
* Karaite transcriptions of Biblical text using the Arabic alphabet but vocalized with Tiberian signs, especially important for syllable structure and vowel length, which is marked in Arabic by matres lectionis and the sign sukun.
* Various oral traditions, especially Karaite and Yemenite Hebrew, have both preserved old features that correspond to Tiberian tradition, such as the pronunciation of schwa according to its proximity to gutturals or yod.

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
Tiberian Hebrew had at least 23 consonantal phonemes, represented by 22 letters. The sin dot distinguishes between the two values of , with a dot on the left () being pronounced the same as the letter Samekh. The letters (begadkefat) had two values each: plosive and fricative.

The following are the most salient characteristics of the Tiberian Hebrew consonantal pronunciation:
* Before the labial vowels () and shva (), the waw-conjunctive () was read as rather than (as is the case in some eastern reading traditions).

* The threefold pronunciation of resh . Even though there is no agreement as to how it was pronounced, the rules of distribution of such pronunciation is given in &quot;Horayaṯ haq-Qorē&quot;:
*# &quot;Normal&quot; Resh pronounced thus (according to Eldar, as a uvular sound ) in all other instances (except for the circumstances described below): 
*# The &quot;peculiar&quot; resh before or after Lamed or Nun, any of the three being vocalized with simple &quot;sheva&quot; and resh after zayin , daleth , samekh , sin , taw , ṣade , ṭeth , any of them punctuated with simple &quot;sheva&quot;: , . Because of the proximity of a dental consonant, resh was pronounced as an alveolar trill, as it still is in Sephardi Hebrew.
*# There is still another pronunciation, affected by the addition of a dagesh in the Resh in certain words in the Bible, which indicates it was doubled : . As can be seen, this pronunciation has to do with the progressive increase in length of this consonant (). It was preserved only by the population of Ma&#x27;azya (), which is in Tiberias.
* A possible threefold pronunciation of taw . There are three words in the Torah, Prophets, and Writings in which it is said that &quot;the Taw is pronounced harder than usual&quot;. It is said that this pronunciation was halfway between the soft () and the hard taw (): 

=== Vowels ===


The vowel qualities have phonemic status: (Lev. 5:19) and &#x27;guilty&#x27;, &#x27;when&#x27; and &#x27;mother&#x27;. has phonemic value in final stressed position , but in other positions, it may reflect loss of the opposition : . By the Tiberian period, all short vowels in ultimately-stressed syllables had lengthened, making vowel length allophonic. Vowels in open or stressed syllables had allophonic length (such as in , which was previously short).

The Tiberian tradition possesses three reduced (ultrashort, &quot;hatuf&quot;) vowels of which has questionable phonemicity. , under a non-guttural letter, was pronounced as an ultrashort copy of the following vowel before a guttural ( ) and as preceding , ( ). However, it was always pronounced as under gutturals: .

=== Stress ===
Tiberian Hebrew has phonemic stress ( &#x27;they built&#x27; vs. &#x27;in us&#x27;). Stress is most commonly ultimate, less commonly penultimate, and rarely antepenultimate stress: &#x27;into the tent&#x27;.

=== Phonotactics ===
As described above, vowel length is dependent on syllable structure. Open syllables must take long or ultrashort vowels; stressed closed syllables take long vowels; unstressed closed syllables take short vowels. Traditional Hebrew philology considers ultrashort vowels not to be syllable nuclei.

== Orthography ==



The simple &quot;sheva&quot; sign changes its pronunciation depending on its position in the word (mobile/vocal or quiescent/zero) and its proximity to certain consonants.

In these examples, it has been preferred to show one in the Bible and represents each phenomenon in a graphic manner (a chateph vowel), but the rules still apply when there is only a simple &quot;sheva&quot; (depending on the manuscript or edition used).

When the simple &quot;sheva&quot; appears in any of the following positions, it is regarded as mobile (na):

* At the beginning of a word, which includes the &quot;sheva&quot; (originally the first of the word) following the attached particles bi-,ki-,li- and u- and preceded by &quot;metheg&quot; (the vertical line placed to the left of the vowel sign, which stands for either secondary stress or its lengthening). Examples: Genesis 2:12; Psalms 74:5. But is not pronounced if there is no &quot;metheg&quot;; that is, they form a closed syllable.
* The &quot;sheva&quot; following these three vowels , except for known types of closed syllables (and preceded or not, by metheg). Examples: Exodus 3:18; Exodus 4:18.
* The second of two adjacent &quot;sheva&quot;s, when both appear under different consonants. Examples: Jeremiah 31:33; Jeremiah 32:9 (except for at the end of a word, ).
* The &quot;sheva&quot; under the first of two identical consonants, preceded by metheg. Examples: Gen. 14:7; Exodus: 15:10.
* The &quot;sheva&quot; under a consonant with dagesh forte or lene. Examples: Isaiah 9:3; Ezekiel 17:23.
* The &quot;sheva&quot; under a consonant that expects gemination but is not so marked, for example, the one found under . And sometimes even when preceded by the article. Examples: Genesis 12:3; 2 Chronicles 33:18.
* In case a quiescent &quot;sheva&quot; was followed either by a guttural or yodh, it would turn into mobile according to the rules given below, if preceded by a metheg. Ancient manuscripts support that view. Examples: Proverbs 28:22; Job 1:3.
* Any &quot;sheva&quot;, if the sign metheg is attached to it, would change an ultrashort vowel to a short, or normal length vowel. For this, only ancient, reliable manuscripts can give us a clear picture, since, with time, later vocalizers added to the number of methegs found in the Bible.

The gutturals (), and yodh (), affect the pronunciation of the &quot;sheva&quot; preceding them. The allophones of the phoneme follow these two rules:

* It would change its sound to imitate that of the following guttural. Numbers 3:17; Numbers 5:28.
* It would be pronounced as &quot;ḥireq&quot; before consonantal &quot;yodh&quot;. Examples: Jeremiah 21:1; in Maimonides&#x27; autograph in his commentary to the Mishnah.

It must be said that even though there are no special signs apart to denote the full range of furtive vowels, the remaining four () are represented by simple &quot;sheva&quot; (ḥaṭaf ḥiriq () in the Aleppo Codex is a scribal oddity and certainly not regular in Hebrew manuscripts with Tiberian vocalization).

All other cases should be treated as zero vowel (quiescent, nah), including the double final &quot;sheva&quot; (double initial &quot;sheva&quot; does not exist in this Hebrew dialect), and the &quot;sheva&quot; in the words and , read by the Tiberian Masoretes as and respectively. This last case has similarities with phenomena occurring in the Samaritan pronunciation and the Phoenician language.

Depending on the school of pronunciation (and relying on musical grounds, perhaps), the metheg sign served to change some closed syllables into open ones, and therefore, changing the vowel from short to long, and the quiescent &quot;sheva&quot;, into a mobile one.

That is referenced specifically by medieval grammarians:
The names of the vowel diacritics are iconic and show some variation:

<doc id="763280" wikidata="Q4791418" url="?curid=763280" title="Arizona State Prison Complex – Tucson">
<text>Arizona State Prison Complex – Tucson is one of 13 prison facilities operated by the Arizona Department of Corrections (ADC). ASPC–Tucson is located in Tucson, Pima County, Arizona, 127 miles south from the state capital of Phoenix, Arizona.

ASPC–Tucson prison had its beginnings as the Arizona Correctional Training Facility. Its first phase opened in January 1978 and it was fully open by August 1979, housing 384 non-violent male first offenders, aged 18–25. A separate unit held juvenile males convicted as adults, as it does today. The Santa Rita Unit was built in 1982, with the first inmates being received in July 1982.

The 1986–87 building program established the 744-bed Cimarron Unit, creating the Tucson Complex, and added 200 beds to Echo Unit. The Rincon/Santa Rita/Units form a hub, which has buildings for inmate records, health services, maintenance, and a 40-cell central detention unit.

ASPC–Tucson has an inmate capacity of approximately 4,358 in 7 housing units and 3 special housing units at security levels 2, 3, 4, and 5. The ADC uses a score classification system to assess inmates&#x27; appropriate custody and security level placement. The scores range from 1 to 5 with 5 being the highest risk or need. ASPC-Tucson is a minimum to high security prison.

In 2009, ASPC–Tucson Echo unit was demolished and a new unit is to be built for around 2,000 minimum custody 1–2 inmates.

==Unique programs==
Prison Inner Peace Program was started in 1989 in the Echo Unit by Michael Todd and Richard Wirta, overseen by Thomas L. Magnuson, Psych Associate II of the Echo Behavioral Health Unit. There was reportedly a profoundly lowered recidivism amongst those who completed the program.

<doc id="763285" wikidata="Q3087650" url="?curid=763285" title="Hurricane Betsy">
<text>Hurricane Betsy was an intense, deadly and destructive tropical cyclone that brought widespread damage to areas of Florida and the central United States Gulf Coast in September 1965. The storm&#x27;s erratic nature, coupled with its intensity and minimal preparation time contributed to making Betsy the first tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin to accrue at least $1 billion in damage. While the storm primarily affected areas of southern Florida and Louisiana, lesser effects were felt in the Bahamas and as far inland in the United States as the Ohio River Valley. Betsy began as a tropical depression north of French Guiana on August 27, and strengthened as it moved in a general northwesterly direction. After executing a slight anticyclonic loop north of the Bahamas, Betsy proceeded to move through areas of south Florida on September 8, causing extensive crop damage. After emerging into the Gulf of Mexico, the cyclone strengthened and reached its peak intensity equivalent to that of a Category 4 hurricane on September 10 before making its final landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana, shortly thereafter. Once inland, Betsy was slow to weaken, and persisted for two more days before degenerating into an extratropical storm; these remnants lasted until September 13.

As a developing tropical cyclone, Betsy tracked over the northern Leeward Islands, producing moderate gusts and slight rainfall, though only minimal damage was reported. After tracking over open waters for several days, Betsy had significantly strengthened upon moving through the Bahamas. There, considerable damage occurred, particularly to crops on the archipelago&#x27;s islands. For the island chain, Betsy was considered the worst hurricane since a tropical cyclone impacted the region in 1929. Widespread power outage and property damage ensued due to the storm&#x27;s strong winds. Overall, damage on the Bahamas amounted to at least $14 million, and one fatality occurred. From there Betsy tracked westward and made landfall on southern Florida, where it was considered the worst tropical cyclone since a hurricane in 1926. Betsy&#x27;s strong storm surge inundated large portions of the Florida Keys, flooding streets and causing widespread damage. The only route out of the Keys onto the mainland was cut off by the storm. In the state alone, Betsy caused $139 million in damage and five deaths.

Betsy&#x27;s most severe impacts were felt in Louisiana, where it made landfall as a powerful Category 4 hurricane. The cyclone propelled damaging storm surge into Lake Pontchartrain, breaching levees in New Orleans and inundating several neighborhoods, most notably the lower Ninth Ward. Strong winds caused widespread power and telecommunications outages across the region. Further inland, effects wrought by Betsy were considerably weaker, though precipitation caused by the storm extended as far northeast as Pennsylvania. Rainfall was primarily beneficial in Arkansas, though localized flooding impacted rice and cotton crops. In Kentucky and Illinois, strong winds caused moderate property damage. By the time the remnants of Betsy moved into the northeastern United States, the storm&#x27;s winds and rainfall had substantially lessened, and as such resulting wind damage was negligible while precipitation benefited crops. In total, the damage wrought by Betsy throughout its existence equated to roughly $1.42 billion, making it the costliest Atlantic hurricane at the time. In addition the hurricane caused 81 deaths, primarily in Louisiana. After the season, the United States Weather Bureau retired the name Betsy from their rotating lists of tropical cyclone names.

==Meteorological history==
Origins of Hurricane Betsy can be traced back to an area of disturbed weather southwest of Cape Verde that first identified via TIROS satellite imagery on August 23. Tracking westward, the tropical wave was intercepted by a United States Navy reconnaissance airplane early on August 27, which concluded that the disturbance had become a tropical cyclone of moderate intensity. Based on information from the flight, it was estimated that the system had organized into a tropical depression by 0000 UTC on August 27, east-southeast of Barbados. Although operationally the United States Weather Bureau office in San Juan, Puerto Rico upgraded the disturbance to tropical storm intensity three hours after their first tropical cyclone bulletin that same day, post-analysis indicated that the tropical depression had remained at the same intensity up until 1200 UTC on August 29. Nonetheless, the tropical cyclone was given the name Betsy for a period of time as a tropical depression, contrary to typical tropical cyclone naming procedure. As Betsy approached the Windward Islands, it began to move in a more northwesterly direction, and was briefly located in the Caribbean Sea during the overnight hours of August 28 before re-emerging into the Atlantic Ocean the following day, after which Betsy was upgraded to tropical storm classification in post-analysis.

Upon moving to the northwest of the Leeward Islands, Betsy entered conditions favorable for marked development. An upper-level trough centered a short distance north of the tropical storm enhanced outflow conditions and speed divergence. Under these conditions, Betsy proceeded to quickly intensify, and reconnaissance missions tasked by the United States Air Force and Weather Bureau indicated that the tropical storm had reached hurricane intensity by 0000 UTC on August 30, centered roughly north-northeast of Puerto Rico. By coincidence, forecast responsibilities were transferred to the Weather Bureau Office in Miami, Florida at the same time; however, the hurricane was still under the purview of the Weather Bureau per se. Due to increasing atmospheric pressure heights to the north, Betsy drastically slowed in forward speed and intensification, and remained stationary for a period of time on August 31 before it began to drift westward. On September 2, Betsy began to quickly intensify, and after strengthening to a Category 3 hurricane-equivalent – a major hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale – the small hurricane attained Category 4 intensity and reached an initial peak intensity with winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) at 0000 UTC on September 4, while situated well north of the Turks and Caicos.

However, on September 5, a blocking ridge of high pressure situated over the Eastern United States forced Betsy to make a tight, clockwise loop and track in an unusual southwesterly path, redirecting it towards Florida and The Bahamas. At roughly the same time, the hurricane weakened to Category 2 intensity, though it later restrengthened to Category 3 intensity on September 6. Betsy&#x27;s atypical southwesterly path brought it directly over several islands in the northern Bahamas, including Great Abaco Island. After stalling for a third time over portions of the central Bahamas, the major hurricane resumed its prior westward track towards South Florida. Early on September 8, Betsy made landfall on Key Largo in extreme southeastern Florida with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 953 mbar (hPa; 28.15 inHg). Without much change in strength, the intense hurricane quickly traversed the Upper Keys and Florida Bay before emerging midday on September 8 into the Gulf of Mexico.

Situated in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico on September 8, Betsy began to strengthen and accelerate towards the west and then northwest, under the influence of the same ridge of high pressure that had forced it southwestward three days prior. At roughly the same time, hurricane forecast operations were handed over the Weather Bureau Office in New Orleans, Louisiana. During its trek through the gulf, Betsy accelerated to a maximum forward speed of 22 mph (35 km/h), a speed anomalously high for a tropical cyclone traversing the Gulf of Mexico. At 0600 UTC on September 9, the hurricane was estimated to have regained Category 4 intensity, and continued to strengthen as it neared the Central United States Gulf Coast. At 0000 UTC the next day, Betsy reached its primary peak intensity with winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 942 mbar (hPa; 27.79 inHg) shortly before moving ashore a rural area of Louisiana coastline adjacent to Houma and Grand Isle early on September 10. Once inland, Betsy quickly weakened, and paralleled the Mississippi River before degenerating into a tropical depression by 0600 UTC the following day. Afterwards, it began to track northeastward along the Ohio River before it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 12. The remnant extratropical circulation of Betsy persisted into southern Ohio before dissipating entirely by 0000 UTC on September 13.

==Preparations==

===The Bahamas, Cuba, and Florida===

At Cape Kennedy, NASA delayed the erection of an Atlas-Centaur rocket which was to be used to launch a craft towards the Moon as part of the Surveyor Program on September 2. Several other prepared rockets on the site&#x27;s launch pads were readied for potential emergency scramble should the hurricane impact the area. Other American space personnel stationed in Grand Turk Island and Mayaguana began preparatory measures after the United States Air Force issued a No. 1 alert for the region. Personnel from a small outpost on Allan Cay were evacuated to Grand Bahama, despite indications at the time that Betsy would curve away from the Bahamas or the East Coast of the United States. At Brunswick, Georgia&#x27;s Naval Air Station Glynco, 21 jet fighter-bombers were evacuated inland. On September 4, helicopters arrived at the Frying Pan Shoals Light to evacuate the lighthouse&#x27;s operators due to the impending threat of a hurricane strike. In the Palm Beach area, a group composed of regional Red Cross disaster chairman Forest W. Dana and nearby town officials held a nearly nonstop radio vigil service. Red Cross volunteers in The Carolinas set up three district headquarters to prepare shelters, first aid programs, and communications. The relief agency also readied seven first aid and food vans in the cities of New Bern and Wilmington in North Carolina and Charleston, South Carolina. The United States Department of Agriculture prepared food supplies in the event of an emergency for the two states.

After Betsy stalled and assumed a southwesterly course towards southern Florida, precautionary measures ceased in the Carolinas but were initiated in Florida and The Bahamas. Mackey Airlines assisted in the evacuation of 227 residents of West End Island to Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach, Florida, over the course of three flights. Three additional Douglas DC-6 airliners from Mackey Airlines evacuated 240 people, primarily American tourists, from Nassau to Miami. Various commercial flights between the archipelago and Florida were cancelled due to the impending storm. In Florida, various relief agencies prepared 9,000 hot dogs, 8,000 hamburgers, and 6,000 servings of chicken, to be donated to local hospitals and charitable organizations. The United States Weather Bureau urged for the reopening of grocery stores and lumberyards which had been closed for Labor Day in order to increase availability of hurricane preparedness materials to potentially affected populations. In downtown Miami, a traffic coordination plan for the evacuation of vehicles and aquatic craft through the Brickell Avenue Bridge was set in place. Homestead Air Reserve Base went into Phase 2 of its hurricane preparedness plan, in which aircraft stationed at the base were serviced for potential evacuation to bases in Michigan and Indiana. Upon Betsy&#x27;s recurvature southwestward toward the peninsula on September 7, the Weather Bureau strongly advised evacuation procedures between Fort Lauderdale and Key Largo. Evacuation was strongly advised in the Florida Keys, where rising water as a result of the storm could potentially flood over portions of U.S. Route 1 – the only primary access route from the Keys to the mainland. Overall, an estimated 50,000 residents were within coastal regions where evacuations were advised. The U.S. Navy abandoned its housing project on Big Pine Key to avoid the hurricane, while sheriff deputies in Marathon, Tavernier, and Islamorada strongly advised evacuation in those respective cities. Various offices, businesses, and schools were closed in advance of the hurricane. Airlines cancelled service to Fort Lauderdale and Miami. In the latter, city crews dismantled traffic lights along Biscayne Boulevard; such procedure was influenced by the damage wrought by Hurricane Cleo a year prior.

On September 7, the United States Weather Bureau predicted that Betsy would make landfall in Matanzas Province in Cuba. The National Observatory of Cuba expressed concern for the island&#x27;s northern coast from the provinces of Havana to Camagüey, and in particular the provinces of Matanzas and Las Villas. Cuban radio alerted residents along the country&#x27;s northern coast, potentially threatened by the hurricane, to take the necessary precautions in the event of an emergency. Radio services in Havana alerted residents along the shores of Pinar del Río Province of potentially dangerous storm surge, and urged immediate precautionary measures.

===United States Gulf Coast===

===Watches and warnings===

Upon the operational development of Betsy into a tropical storm on August 27, the San Juan Weather Bureau Office issued gale warnings for Barbados, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Martinique. The weather office advised for small craft in the Windward and Leeward Islands to remain in port until the storm passed. These gale warnings were later expanded to include Dominica and Guadeloupe the next day. Midday on August 28, warnings were lowered for Barbados and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and raised for areas of the northern Leeward Islands and later Puerto Rico. Late that day, warnings in Dominica and Guadeloupe were discontinued. All warnings associated with the developing tropical cyclone were discontinued for a period of time on August 29, as Betsy was pulling away from any landmasses. After the hurricane temporarily stalled and began to track westward on September 1, the Weather Bureau began to warn interests in the Bahamas. Though no warnings were specified, the tropical cyclone tracking agency forecasted winds of potentially hurricane-force and strong surf to impact the Turks and Caicos Islands and Mayaguana; such forecasts were changed after Betsy began tracking northwest. Threatening the coasts of Georgia and The Carolinas on September 4, the Weather Bureau announced the possibility of a hurricane watch for those coastal areas, but decided to delay the issuance of such watches due to Betsy&#x27;s slow movement at the time. Nonetheless, the organization advised for small craft in coastal waters adjacent to the coast between Cape Kennedy to Sandy Hook, New Jersey to remain in port, and other small craft north of Miami, Florida and into Bahamian waters to exercise caution. As a result of Betsy executing a loop and beginning to tracking southwestward, these watches were never issued, however, the Weather Bureau advised extreme caution in several Bahamian islands, though once again no warnings were specified. However, general emergency hurricane warning was issued early on September 16 for islands in the northern Bahamas, as well as adjacent waters. Hurricane watches and gale warnings were also issued for surrounding islands at the same time. These warnings and watch products for the Bahamas held until late on September 7.

Early on September 6, as Betsy was tracking through the Bahamas, a hurricane watch and gale warning were issued for portions of the Southeastern Floridian coast from Cape Kennedy to Key West. Late that day, however, areas of the watch zone from Palm Beach to Key West and Everglades City were upgraded to hurricane emergency warning status. Additional hurricane watches were hoisted for areas of Florida&#x27;s western coast from Everglades City to Punta Gorda. The following evening, the hurricane emergency warning zone was expanded to include areas of the east coast northward to Fort Pierce and on the west coast northward to Venice. Gale warnings were also expanded to include coastal areas from Jacksonville to St. Marks. Hurricane watches were similarly extended to include coastal regions of Florida from the boundaries of the hurricane warnings to Daytona Beach and Cedar Keys on the peninsula&#x27;s eastern and western coasts, respectively. Once Betsy began moving through the peninsula, however, warning and watch products began to be discontinued by regions, with all products pertaining to Florida discontinued by midday on September 8. After leaving the Florida area, the first hurricane watch pertaining to the Central Gulf Coast of the United States occurred late on September 8, when the Weather Bureau office in New Orleans issued a hurricane watch for coastal areas from Matagorda Bay to the Mississippi River Delta. Early the following day, hurricane emergency warnings were issued for areas stretching from Galveston, Texas to the Mississippi River Delta and gale warnings elsewhere from Mobile Bay to Matagorda Bay. Upon completing its northwestward recurvature, hurricane emergency warnings were shifted eastward to include areas from the mouth of the Mississippi River Delta to Mobile, Alabama. Gale warnings were effected by this change, and as such were also extended to include areas west of Panama City, Florida. On September 9, hurricane warnings were once again extended eastward to Pensacola, Florida, while they were lowered for the Texas coast. These warnings remained in effect until September 10, by which time Betsy had weakened sufficiently enough not to warrant such warnings and watches.
==Impact==
The effects of Hurricane Betsy were of far-reaching and unprecedented severity. Though the extent of impacts were limited to the Bahamas and portions of the United States, the damage in these respective regions were considerable. According to the Hurricane Research Division of the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, Betsy produced Category 3 winds (111 mph (179 km/h) or greater) in Southeastern Florida and Southeastern Louisiana. However, winds of such intensity were also reported in the Bahamas. The final, enumerated damage figure of $1.42 billion in damage costs made Betsy the first tropical cyclone in the United States to accrue more than $1 billion in damage, unadjusted for inflation. For this reason, the tropical cyclone was nicknamed &quot;Billion Dollar Betsy.&quot;

===The Bahamas===
During Betsy&#x27;s initial approach of the Bahamian archipelago on September 2, strong surf and high swells were reported in the Southeastern islands, though no damage was reported. Much of the damage inflicted to the Bahamas by Betsy occurred between September 6–8, when the tropical cyclone moved across the northern Bahamas as a Category 3 hurricane. The preceding track was similar to that of another major hurricane in 1929, which had also drastically curved southwestward before causing significant damage to the island group. Likewise, Betsy was considered the worst hurricane to strike the region since then. Stalling over the Bahamas for a period of time as it moved through the islands, several locations sustained the Betsy&#x27;s effects for prolonged periods of time, despite the tropical cyclone&#x27;s relatively small size. Widespread power outage and communication blackouts ensued, preventing the flow of reports between the northern Bahamas and other outlets as the storm took place. This included NASA communication centers in Cape Kennedy, which had lost contact with downrange missile tracking stations in the archipelago. Over the duration of the hurricane, the lowest pressure measured was 961 mbar (hPa; 28.40 inHg) in Dunmore Town on Harbour Island. However, no wind measurement was recorded alongside the pressure reading due to a resulting power failure.

Offshore, the Dutch freighter Sarah Elizabeth was caught in rough seas and had lost control of its rudder while it was pulled by continuous wave action towards Egg Island. As a result, the ship&#x27;s operators relayed a SOS signal, to which the United States Coast Guard responded by dispatching a cutter and several merchant ships to assist in escorting the stricken freighter to safety. However, roughly five hours later the crew of the Sarah Elizabeth was able to navigate to safer waters within the Providence Channel. Two luxury yachts within the harbor were destroyed, with dozens of smaller craft damaged, as a result of the wind and waves.

Passing to the north of Nassau, Betsy caused considerable damage to the capital city and the rest of New Providence Island as the hurricane&#x27;s eyewall stalled over the area. The last message received by the Miami Weather Bureau office from communication operators in Nassau during the storm was a report of winds and rough seas late on September 6. The strong winds downed power lines, trees, and destroyed homes, while the heavy rainfall, having accumulated over several days, flooding city streets. Other streets were littered with coconuts, palm fronds, and other debris blown or felled by the strong winds. Heavy loss of shrubbery was also reported due to the storm&#x27;s effects. A strong storm surge estimated at swept into the Bay Street waterfront shopping district, inundating the renowned shopping area. The local police detachment, which had been holed up within a waterfront barracks, was forced to take refuge in a nearby high school due to the storm surge. Along the coast, 500 American tourists remained stranded in waterfront hotels. Despite the severe effects, only one person died in the Nassau area after his ship was destroyed and capsized in Nassau Harbor; this would be the only fatality associated with Betsy in the Bahamas.

On West End on Grand Bahama, a weather station reported maximum sustained winds of , with other locations elsewhere on the island experiencing gusts of at least . However, no damage was reported. Out of all the islands, the strongest winds were reported on Abaco Island, where areas were within Betsy&#x27;s swath of hurricane-force winds for over 20 hours. In Green Turtle Cay, a station clocked winds of , well into Category 4 intensity on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. Another station in Hope Town measured a peak wind gust of . The entirety of Hope Town was covered with sand to a depth of , and the local harbor club was extensively damaged. Other docks were either damaged or completely destroyed. Though there was relatively little rainfall, coastal flooding damaged many houses to a point beyond repair. In Marsh Harbour, a majority of homes were unroofed. Heavy crop and fruit tree losses were reported in Little and Northern Abaco, with damage enumerated at well over a million dollars. In the southern Berry Islands, which experienced hurricane-force winds for over 25 hours and the eye for 3 hours, all the islands suffered damage of some degree. Frazers Hog Cay had several houses badly damaged, one totally destroyed and the entire power distribution destroyed. Only Bird Cay, which had underground utilities, was able to restore electricity and water the next day. The harbor at Chub Cay was severely damaged. and would take months to repair.

Across the northern portion of Eleuthera Island, Betsy wrought considerable damage. Communications from the island&#x27;s missile tracking center were lost, with the last transmitted message indicating winds of which subsequently destroyed an anemometer. A submarine communications cable connecting the missile tracking center to Cape Kennedy was cut by the strong wave action. In Tarpum Baya police station sustained heavy damage after being hit by storm surge. Other coastal installments and property were severely damaged by the waves. The Glass Window Bridge was also damaged by the storm surge. Elsewhere, vehicles were damaged by fallen debris kicked up by the strong winds associated with Betsy. Overall, Hurricane Betsy caused an estimated $14 million in damage across the Bahamas, primarily to crops. Insurance claims were estimated at $4 million. The low death toll from the hurricane was accredited by the United States Weather Bureau to the relatively low storm tide, which, although rough, was negligible in areas including in Nassau, and the heeding of posted hurricane warnings by the affected populations.
===Florida===

Beginning on September 7, intermittent squalls associated with Betsy&#x27;s outer rainbands began affecting the coast, producing gusts in excess of . One of these squalls toppled trees and damaged awnings in Stuart. Early the following day, Betsy made landfall on the southeastern Florida coast near Key Largo with a strength equivalent to that of a Category 3 hurricane. Intense winds were felt across the region, with the highest officially wind speed clocked at in Big Pine Key; the same station also recorded the strongest gust documented while Betsy was over southern Florida at . The lowest barometric pressure recorded was 952 mbar (hPa; 28.12 inHg) at a station in Tavernier while it was within the eye of the storm.

The strong winds knocked down utility poles, causing widespread power outage and a telecommunications blackout. At one point, an estimated 25,000 telephones were knocked out of service, with half of the central telephone exchange operating on emergency backup power. Some transformers that were blown down sparked localized fires. One person was killed after being electrocuted by a fallen power line. The blackouts cut electric service to 80 percent of customers in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas. House trailers were smashed by flying debris in the same areas. Several roads were blocked by debris thrown by the wind. U.S. Highway 1 in Florida was cut off by fallen telephone poles, preventing land access from the mainland to the Florida Keys. Similarly, numerous portions of the Tamiami Trail were blocked by fallen trees. A person was killed after a prostrated tree fell, crushing the individual. At the Miami International Airport, two twin-engine cargo craft were blown off the airport&#x27;s perimeter. Heavy agricultural losses resulted from the strong winds as well. Approximately 25 to 50 percent of Florida&#x27;s citrus crop was damaged after being blown down by strong winds. In addition, 90 percent of Dade and Broward counties&#x27; avocado crop, valued at $2 million, was destroyed.

Much of the damage inflicted in the state was caused by an unusually strong storm surge, which inundated the coastal and low-lying areas of Florida. Although the strongest storm surge was positioned north of the eye, away from the more densely populated regions of Greater Miami, an abnormally high storm tide still prevailed and caused extensive damage along the southern coast of the peninsula. Northerly winds well in advance of Betsy&#x27;s landfall forced water from Florida Bay onto the Florida Keys, and the resulting damage was then further exacerbated when southerly winds during and after the hurricane&#x27;s approach forced water from the Atlantic onto the isolated Keys. Storm surge was further exacerbated by (this writer remembers) high tide (cannot substantiate) and near full moon at the peak of the storm in the Miami area. This resident living one block north of the Miami city line remembers the waters of Biscayne Bay came within mm of entering his family&#x27;s home on NE 88th Street perhaps 300 meters from the bay. Though storm surge was estimated to have peaked along the coast of North Key Largo at , a measurement of in Tavernier was the highest measured total. However, a high water mark of on a highway west of Sugarloaf Key indicated that such estimations in North Key Largo were valid. The strong storm surge caused severe beach erosion, mostly to areas south of Clearwater on the state&#x27;s western coast while Betsy was traversing the Gulf of Mexico. In Fort Pierce, the waves washed away up to of beach.
Coastal flooding in the Upper Keys was severe, with areas being inundated under several feet of seawater. Along the Miami Beach waterfront, a storm tide measuring caused extensive damage to shoreline property along Biscayne Bay. Eight people on the beach were injured, primarily due to flying glass shards. Roads were inundated, with water exceeding the first floor heights of some buildings. As a result of the waves and wind, three barges were torn out of their moorings, and later drifted downwind before severing a portion of the Rickenbacker Causeway, rendering it impassable and isolating Key Biscayne from the mainland. Along the waterfront, the waves blew into hotels and shoreline residences.

Offshore, the strong waves caused a freighter to run aground near Palm Beach, and nine people became stranded in houseboats near a mangrove island in Biscayne Bay. Another cargo ship, the &quot;Panamanian&quot;, ran aground within Lake Worth Inlet. At Key Largo, a sailboat was blown out of the water onto an adjacent neighborhood. Elsewhere in Key Largo, homes were unroofed by the strong winds, with other buildings damaged by flying debris. Water forced into the Miami River caused it to overflow its banks and spread inland for several city blocks in Miami. In the Miami area, Betsy caused the most severe seawater inundation since a major hurricane struck in 1926; this record was attributed to the highest storm surge reported in as many years. A section of State Road A1A, which runs adjacent to Miami and the nearby beach, was blocked by sand dunes piled inland by the strong winds. The high tide also washed out a some portions of the road between Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach.

Precipitation was localized, albeit heavy, in South Florida. Rainfall peaked at in Plantation Key on September 8. The weather station in Big Pine Key observed the second highest state rainfall total at . Elsewhere, rainfall spread as far northward as Tampa Bay. Although intense, the rains helped partially alleviate a concurrent drought in the Everglades. No damage was reported in association with the rainfall. A total of three tornadoes formed in association with Betsy, of which two occurred while the major hurricane was landfalling in South Florida. On September 8, a tornado developed and track near Marathon, while another occurred near Big Pine Key; both tornadoes caused no reported damage. However, a waterspout formed near Fort Walton Beach off the Florida Panhandle the following day and later destroyed a marina with twelve boats. The relatively low number of tornadoes that formed as a result of Betsy was due to the anomalously rapid forward motion that Betsy traveled at during its traverse of the Florida peninsula and the Gulf of Mexico. Overall, five people were killed in the state, and damage totaled $139 million, primarily due to the strong storm surge generated by Betsy.

===Gulf of Mexico===
Eight offshore oil platforms were destroyed during Betsy, with others experiencing damage. A Shell oil platform off the Mouth of the Mississippi River was not seen again. The oil rig Maverick, owned by future president George H. W. Bush&#x27;s Zapata corporation also disappeared during the cyclone. It was insured by Lloyd&#x27;s of London for US$5.7 million (1965 dollars).

===Louisiana===

Hurricane Betsy slammed into Grand Isle on the evening of September 9, 1965. winds and power failures were reported in New Orleans. The eye of the storm passed to the southwest of New Orleans on a northwesterly track. The northern and western eyewalls covered Southeast Louisiana and the New Orleans area from about 8 pm until 4 am the next morning. In Thibodaux winds of to were reported. The Baton Rouge weather bureau operated under auxiliary power, without telephone communication. Around 1 am, the worst of the wind and rain was over.

Betsy also drove a storm surge into Lake Pontchartrain, just north of New Orleans, and the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, a deep-water shipping channel to the east and south. Levees for the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet along Florida Avenue in the Lower Ninth Ward and on both sides of the Industrial Canal failed. The flood water reached the eaves of houses in some places and over some one story roofs in the Lower Ninth Ward. Some residents drowned in their attics trying to escape the rising waters.

These levee breaches flooded parts of Gentilly, the Upper Ninth Ward, and the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans as well as Arabi and Chalmette in neighboring St. Bernard Parish. President Lyndon Johnson visited the city, promising New Orleans Mayor Vic Schiro federal aid.

It was ten days or more before the water level in New Orleans went down enough for people to return to their homes. It took even longer than that to restore their flooded houses to a livable condition. Those who did not have family or friends with dry homes had to sleep in the shelters at night and forage for supplies during the day, while waiting for the federal government to provide emergency relief in the form of trailers. In all, 164,000 homes were flooded at the second landfall.

Evidence suggests that cheap construction and poor maintenance of the structures led to the failure of the levees. However, popular rumor persists that they were intentionally breached, possibly as a means of salvaging the French Quarter and central business district.
Many of the barges that had been traveling on the Mississippi River were engulfed by the hurricane. One of the barges, &quot;MTC-602&quot;, contained 600 tons of deadly chlorine gas contained in cylinders. Chlorine gas, which was used frequently as a chemical weapon in World War I, is a powerful irritant that can inflict damage to the eyes, nose, throat and lungs, and (at high concentrations and prolonged exposure) cause death by asphyxiation. It was estimated that the amount of chlorine loaded on the barge was enough to kill 40,000 people. The barge had sunk near Baton Rouge, where an estimated 300,000 people lived. The residents in the harbor area were evacuated until the barge was recovered. President Lyndon B. Johnson ordered the Navy and Army Engineers to find and raise the barge. While it took months to locate and make the appropriate plans for raising the barge, the actual process of raising it took around two hours. The barge was reportedly recovered, without any problems, on November 12, 1965.

===Mississippi===
The storm produced rainfall, high tides, and strong winds in Mississippi. Near the border with Alabama, tides of were reported, while ranging as high as near the state line with Louisiana. Wind speeds also varied greatly throughout the state. In Pascagoula, winds between were recorded. By contrast, winds were in excess of in Bay St. Louis. Despite the winds, much of the property damage in the state was caused by tides along the Gulf Coast. Strong winds and heavy rainfall caused significant crop damage in Harrison, Hancock County, Mississippi, and Jackson County, Mississippi. Throughout the state, 25,000 people lost electricity and more than 22,641 disruptions to telephone service occurred. Overall, damage in the state of Mississippi totaled to $80 million (1965 USD).

===Alabama===
Though Betsy remained well south and west of Alabama throughout its existence, its outer rainbands and strong storm surge caused damage in some areas of the state, particularly in the southern portions of the state. At the coast, the storm tide caused by Betsy were the highest since 1916. High tides peaking at in Mobile destroyed and damage some private piers and waterfront buildings. The Mobile Bay Causeway and adjacent infrastructure was flooded by the storm surge; as a result the causeway was closed between September 9–10. Strong winds were also reported in southern Alabama. Gusts of were reported on Dauphin Island just off the Alabama coast; these would be the strongest winds or gusts reported statewide. Similarly, gusts of were estimated at Alabama Port. In the former, minor damage was reported to residences and other buildings, and numerous homes sustained minor roof and carport damage. Mobile County reported similar damage. Extensive damage to utility lines in those same regions also occurred. The strong winds also resulted in the tearing of 20–25 percent of the state pecan crop from their trees. Damage to other crops was negligible.

Although rainfall occurred throughout Alabama, precipitation was more numerous in the northern part of the state after Betsy passed the region to the north as a weakening tropical cyclone. Rainfall peaked at in Guntersville. Betsy&#x27;s outer rainbands also produced two tornadoes in the state. The first occurred in a remote area near Theodore and as such did not cause any damage. However, the second tornado, which touched down near Cullman late on September 11, destroyed several acres of corn and uprooted over 300 fruit trees. The tornado, described as one of &quot;narrow&quot; length, also slightly damaged some buildings and uprooted a number of other trees. Though no exact damage total could be calculated, the tornado caused anywhere between $5,500–$55,000 in damage. Statewide, Hurricane Betsy caused $500,000 in damage.

===Elsewhere===

In its early formative stages, Betsy forced the shortening of NASA&#x27;s Gemini 5 mission by one orbit due to the tropical storm&#x27;s forecasted track over the initial target splashdown zone near Grand Turk Island. As a result, the spacecraft, which had been orbiting the Earth since August 1965, had its target splashdown zone shifted northward to an area of the Atlantic Ocean well east of Jacksonville, Florida, away from the storm&#x27;s projected path. In Martinique, the precursor tropical depression caused marginal rainfall and light gusts, and no damage was reported. In Sint Maarten, winds and their associated gusts peaked at for several hours on August 28. Throughout the rest of the Windward Islands, gusts peaked at 40 mph (65 km/h), though the resultant wind damage was marginal. As the hurricane was passing near the southeastern Bahamas, high swells were reported along the northern coast of Hispaniola, though no damage ensued.

Although the more significant effects of Hurricane Betsy in the United States were limited to coastal regions, areas further inland received rainfall and strong winds from the weakening tropical cyclone and its remnants, with precipitation extending inland as far northeast as Pennsylvania. Far offset from where Betsy made landfall, effects in Texas were minimal, despite the large scale evacuations in Sabine Pass prior to landfall. In Port Arthur a station received just of rain, coupled with storm tides above mean sea level. From September 10–11, Betsy passed through Arkansas, which experienced the worst effects in the United States outside of states adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico. The highest reported rainfall total from the hurricane in the state was in Wynne, where of rain was recorded. Surrounding regions in northeastern Arkansas reported at least of rain. The heavy precipitation and resulting flooding there damaged cotton and rice crops. Much of the rice crop in the eastern and southern portions of the state were flattened by the rains, and thus were highly susceptible to future rainfalls. A third of cotton, much of which defoliated, was lost to the rain. However, these losses were offset by the increased soybean yield resulting from the same rainfall. A number of pecan tree limbs were torn down, though relative to the overall pecan production for the state these losses were negligible. The rains also caused both the Black and White Rivers in the eastern part of the state to rise from to ; however, they did not exceed flood stage. Betsy&#x27;s remnants were estimated to have brought winds of throughout the state. Most of the stronger winds were in the northern quadrant of the weakening tropical cyclone as it progressed through Arkansas. However, the highest measured wind gusts were only clocked at in stations at Pine Bluff and Walnut. The strong winds tore down power lines, leaving hundreds of electricity customers without power for several days. However, regional electrical crews were able to restore most power by the night of September 11. Four people were killed by the weakening hurricane statewide.

In Illinois, the remnants of Hurricane Betsy brought heavy rainfall to the extreme southern portions of the state over a period of three days, ranging anywhere from ; the highest recorded total was in Cairo, Illinois. The same station recorded of rain in a 24-hour period. The resulting damage, if any, was minimal, though minor damage occurred to cotton and soy crops in the Cairo area. Hail and strong winds in Kentucky&#x27;s Bluegrass region damaged tobacco fields and caused damage to 35 mobile homes and a number of other roofs. Though no deaths were directly associated with Betsy&#x27;s effects, a car lost control during a rainstorm in Gallatin County and subsequently crashed; the two occupants later went missing and were presumed dead. Strong wind in Montgomery County downed trees. In western Tennessee, moderate to heavy rains in conjunction with gusts as strong as were reported. Precipitation peaked in the state at in Ripley. Though much of the rainfall was beneficial to the region&#x27;s agricultural sector, localized flooding was also reported. Winds estimated between blew down some cotton and corn crops. Other opened cotton bolls were damaged, while soybeans were blown down, making mechanical harvesting difficult.

Further north and east, the rains Betsy produced were mostly beneficial as the storm had substantially weakened by the time it had approached these regions. The outer fringes of Betsy caused moderate rainfall in the southeastern states of North Carolina, Georgia, and South Carolina, where state precipitation totals peaked at in Randleman, in Ailey, and in Laurens, respectively. Waves cresting as high as off of South Carolina caused minor beach damage during Betsy&#x27;s initial approach of the South Atlantic States on September 7. In West Virginia, the rains helped to saturate soils used for growing crops, benefiting crop production. From September 11–13, Betsy&#x27;s rains were felt throughout Pennsylvania. Rainfall peaked at in the central and northeastern regions of the state. Further south, in Maryland and Delaware, the rains were also beneficial to arable land. Precipitation in the former peaked at in Bittinger, while precipitation in the latter peaked at .
==Aftermath==

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers&#x27; Hurricane Protection Program came into existence as a result of Betsy. The Corps built new levees for New Orleans that were both taller and made of stronger material, designed specifically to resist a fast-moving Category 3 hurricane like Betsy (Betsy was retroactively upgraded to a Category 4 at the time of its Louisiana landfall in 2019). The resulting levee improvements failed when Hurricane Katrina, a large, slow-moving, intense hurricane made landfall near New Orleans on August 29, 2005.

Due to the storm&#x27;s extent and severity of impacts, the name &quot;Betsy&quot; was retired following the season by the National Hurricane Center, and it will not be used again to name a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin. Consequently, the name was replaced with &quot;Blanche&quot; for the 1969 season.

===Hurricane Betsy in popular culture===
*In April 1969, Texan blues artist Sam John &quot;Lightnin&#x27;&quot; Hopkins wrote the song &quot;Hurricane Betsy&quot; as the fourth track of the album &quot;The Texas Bluesman&quot;.
*The song &quot;Georgia... Bush&quot; was recorded by artists DJ Drama and Lil Wayne and released along with the mixtape Dedication 2 on September 4, 2006. Produced by Vudu Spellz, the song described a first-person account of Hurricane Katrina and emasculated U.S. president George W. Bush, while also indicting institutional racism. Part of the song&#x27;s lyrics – &quot;Same shit happened back in Hurricane Betsy/ 1965&quot; – makes direct reference to Hurricane Betsy, implying that the government intentionally destroyed levees such that the Lower Ninth Ward would be flooding and thus protecting more expensive lakefront property.
*Written by Rachelle Burk and illustrated by Rex Schneider, the children&#x27;s novel &quot;Tree House in a Storm&quot; is a fictional telling of two child siblings whose tree house, having long served as a safe haven, is destroyed by Hurricane Betsy.

<text>The Council of Five Hundred () was the lower house of the legislature of the French First Republic under the Constitution of the Year III. It operated from 31 October 1795 to 9 November 1799 during the Directory () period of the French Revolution.

==Role and function==

The Council of Five Hundred was established under the Constitution of Year III which was adopted by a referendum on 24 September 1795, and constituted after the first elections which were held from 12–21 October 1795. Voting rights were restricted to citizens owning property bringing in income equal to 150 days of work. Each member elected had to be at least 30 years old, meet residency qualifications and pay taxes. To prevent them coming under the pressure of the sans-culottes and the Paris mob, the constitution allowed the Council of the Five Hundred to meet in closed session. A third of them would be replaced annually.

Besides functioning as a legislative body, the Council of Five Hundred proposed the list out of which the Ancients chose five Directors, who jointly held executive power. The Council of Five Hundred had their own distinctive official uniform, with robes, cape and hat, just as did the Council of Ancients and the Directors. Under the Thermidorean constitution, as Boissy d&#x27;Anglas put it, the Council of Five Hundred was to be the imagination of the Republic, and the Council of Ancients its reason.

==Elections of 1795==

==Elections of 1797==
In the elections of April 1797, there were a number of voting irregularities and a very low turnout, resulting in a strong showing for Royalist tendencies. A number of the newly elected deputies formed the Club de Clichy in the council. Jean-Charles Pichegru, widely assumed to be a monarchist, was elected President of the Council of Five Hundred. After documentation of Pichegru&#x27;s activities was supplied by Napoleon Bonaparte, the Directors accused the entire body of plotting against the Revolution and moved quickly to annul the elections and arrest the royalists in what was known as the Coup of 18 Fructidor.

To support the coup, General Lazare Hoche, then commander of the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse, arrived in the capital with his troops, while Napoleon sent an army under Pierre Augereau. Deputies were arrested and 53 were exiled to Cayenne in French Guiana. Since death from tropical disease was likely, this punishment was nicknamed the &quot;dry guillotine&quot;. The 42 opposition newspapers were closed, the chambers were purged, and elections were partly cancelled.

==Elections of 1798==

The elections of April 1798 were heavily manipulated. The Council of the Five Hundred passed a law on 8 May barring 106 recently elected deputies from taking their seats, all of whom were of a left-wing persuasion. Elections in 48 departments were annulled. Nevertheless, left-wing opinion grew in strength in the council in 1799, and on 18 June 1799, the Council of Five Hundred and the Council of Ancients forced the resignations of the most anti-Jacobin Directors, Merlin de Douai, La Révellière-Lépeaux and Treilhard in the co-called &#x27;Coup of 30 Prairial VII&#x27;.

==Coup of 18th Brumaire Year VIII==
In October 1799 Napoleon&#x27;s brother Lucien Bonaparte was appointed President of the Council of Five Hundred. Soon afterwards, in the coup of 18 Brumaire, Napoleon led a group of grenadiers who drove the council from its chambers and installed him as leader of France as its First Consul. This ended the Council of Five Hundred, the Council of Ancients and the Directory.

<doc id="763289" wikidata="Q1323753" url="?curid=763289" title="28 Bolsheviks">
<text>The 28 (and a half) Bolsheviks (; ) were a faction in the early Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The faction was formed among Chinese Communists studying at the Sun Yat-sen University in Moscow during the late 1920s and early 1930s. They received their nickname because of their strong support for the orthodox political positions advocated by Joseph Stalin and Pavel Mif. The leaders of the faction included Wang Ming, Bo Gu, Luo Fu, He Zishu, Wang Jiaxiang, and Shen Zemin. Sun Yat-sen University closed in 1930 and the students made their way back to China.

In January 1931, several members of the 28 Bolsheviks were elevated to the Central Committee of the CCP at its Fourth Plenary session. Later that same year, Wang Ming and then Bo Gu became General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. Bo would go on to serve in this position for the next four years. They ended Li Lisan&#x27;s aggressive policy of assaulting the cities and attempted to bring the far-flung Chinese soviets under stricter central control. This latter policy brought them into conflict with Mao Zedong, especially once the CCP&#x27;s central leadership was forced to flee to Mao&#x27;s Jiangxi Soviet in late 1931. Mao eventually won over the majority of the party and removed the 28 Bolsheviks from power at the Zunyi Conference in January 1935.

==Background==
The Soviet Union devoted a significant amount of resources to encouraging revolution in China. It maintained a network of universities to train Chinese revolutionaries, the most important of which was the Sun Yat-sen University in Moscow. Sun Yat-sen University was founded in 1925 as part of the First United Front agreement that the Soviets had brokered between the CCP and the KMT. The university had an important influence on modern Chinese history by educating many prominent Chinese political figures. From the beginning, the university was riven by factional struggles between supporters of Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stalin, which eventually led to the university&#x27;s closure in 1930.

== Members ==
Although several allusions to the &quot;28 Bolsheviks&quot; can be found in Mao&#x27;s speeches and a few early works about CCP, a full list of the 28 did not appear until decades later. There are several rival lists of the 28. All agree on twenty-three of the members, while thirteen names appear on some but not all lists. The twenty-three agreed-upon members were Bo Gu, Wang Ming and his wife , Chen Changhao and his wife Du Zuoxiang (杜作祥), Shen Zemin and his wife Zhang Qinqiu, , , Zhang Wentian, Zhu Zishun (朱自舜, female), Zhu Agen, , Wang Jiaxiang, Yang Shangkun, Xia Xi, He Zishu, Sheng Zhongliang, Wang Yuncheng, Chen Yuandao, Li Zhusheng, Yin Jian, Yuan Jiayong.

The thirteen who are included on some but not all lists are Kai Feng, , Du Ting, Guo Miaogen, Li Yuanjie (李元杰), Wang Baoli (王宝礼), Song Panmin, Xiao Tefu (肖特甫), Xu Yixin, Yun Yurong, Wang Xiu, Shen Zhiyuan, and Liu Qunxian (female).

== Rise and fall ==

The Sun Yat-sen University closed in 1930. Although the members of the faction were thereafter scattered and never reunited as a group of twenty-eight, upon their return to China a significant minority would play a major role in the politics of the CCP. Those who reached Shanghai in 1930 joined the rising tide of criticism against Li Lisan, who at that time dominated party leadership. Li had been advocating immediate attacks on major cities, a policy that failed with disastrous consequences for the soviet bases. However, contrary to what many early western sources assumed, the 28 Bolsheviks did not play a significant role in ousting Li Lisan. Li was removed largely through the intervention of the Comintern, which sent Central Committee members Zhou Enlai and Qu Qiubai back from Moscow to moderate Li. When this plan failed, the Comintern summoned Li to Moscow in October 1930.

In January 1931 the Central Committee of CCP held its 4th Plenary Meeting, and with the presence and direct support of Pavel Mif, Wang Ming and his group won a landslide victory. Wang was elected to the Communist Party&#x27;s politburo, while Bo Gu and Zhang Wentian took up other equally important positions.

As a result, the conflict between the Central Committee and Mao Zedong&#x27;s fledgling Chinese Soviet Republic began once again. Although Wang Ming returned to Moscow after a short stay in Shanghai, Bo Gu and Zhang Wentian both took the position of General Secretary of Central Committee of the Party in turn, and led the Chinese revolution in a radical/pro-left manner.

Following Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Shanghai massacre of 1927, the CCP went deep underground in Shanghai and other cities. By the early 1930s, even that was unsafe and leaders began to converge at Mao Zedong&#x27;s Jiangxi Soviet. Among the first to arrive, and to begin dismantling Mao&#x27;s power, was Zhou Enlai. In 1933, when Bo Gu arrived, the job was mostly finished.

After a series of successful defenses against Nationalist Army attacks, Chiang&#x27;s German advisers switched tactics and began building concentric circles of fortified positions closer and closer to the communist base. This forced the party to embark in the famous Long March of October 1934 to October 1935. Shortly after the march began, party leaders held an enlarged congress to determine the direction and leadership of the revolution. At the Zunyi Conference in 1935, the 28 Bolsheviks were defeated by Mao Zedong and his allies, primarily due to the backing of Zhou Enlai, and Zhu De and defecting of Zhou Wentian and Wang Jiaxiang.

Bo Gu supported the Comintern military advisor Otto Braun, while Zhang and Wang Jiaxiang, General Commissar of the Red Army, and Yang Shangkun, Commissar of the Third Field Army of Red Army at that time, defected to Mao. This led to the disintegration of the 28 Bolsheviks. Wang Ming was exiled to Moscow where he later died. Zhang was demoted to the field of ideological research in Yan&#x27;an, and later appointed Deputy Foreign Minister after 1949. He died during the Cultural Revolution after forming a &quot;counterrevolutionary group&quot; with Peng Dehuai (aka Peng Dehuai anti-party group). Bo Gu died in an air crash in the 1946 when he returned to Yan&#x27;an from Chongqing, temporary capital of Kuomintang Government.

== Disputes ==

The standard Western interpretation is that the group neglected the contribution of peasants and land reform who contributed to the success of Mao&#x27;s Mobile Warfare. Also, as protégés of Pavel Mif, they thought they were destined to take charge of the Chinese revolution

Thomas Kampen&#x27;s &quot;Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and the Evolution of the Chinese Communist Leadership&quot; argues that they were only a coherent group in Moscow, opposed to both Kuomintang and Trotskyist influences among Chinese students. It is also claimed that they returned to China at various times but failed to form an effective faction. Additionally, there are questions as to whether the entire group gained notoriety only by association with the theories of the most prominent member, Wang Ming. Frederick Litten writes agreeing with Kampen that there was no such faction in the Jiangxi Soviet and goes further to question whether the group acted in any kind of coordinated way at all. Litten&#x27;s view is that the idea of a &#x27;Leftist&#x27; versus &#x27;Maoist&#x27; dichotomy at the time is a later invention that was retrospectively applied.

The 28 Bolsheviks became pawns in the power struggle between their mentor, Pavel Mif, and the Chinese Communist Party. The group&#x27;s members were relatively innocent in the ways of revolution despite their collective power. Its members had different fates, but as a group, the 28 Bolsheviks were destined to fail. Today in China, &quot;the 28 Bolsheviks&quot; is synonymous with dogmatism.

== Later history ==

* Wang Jiaxiang was eventually made Director of the CCP Central International Liaison Department after having also served for some time as the PRC&#x27;s Ambassador to the Soviet Union. He died in the Cultural Revolution.
* Chen Changhao worked with Zhang Guotao when he returned from Moscow and became Zhang&#x27;s Commissar, but lost power and influence in the struggle between Zhang and Mao. Chen Changhao went on to become a Communist Party historian, and committed suicide in the Cultural Revolution.
* He Kequan was General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Youth League, and later deputy director of the CCP Central Propaganda Department, and died in 1954.
* Xia Xi was sent to Hunan and carried out the purges which took the lives of more than forty thousand Red Army soldiers. He was later regarded as a public enemy. Perhaps because of this, no one came to his aid when he fell into a river and drowned during the Long March.
* Yang Shangkun survived the purges, including the Cultural Revolution. He later became the President of the PRC in the 1980s.
* Shen Zemin, the younger brother of writer Mao Dun, worked for Zhang Guotao and the 4th Red Army. After Zhang&#x27;s army was defeated, Shen remained at the Communist base in Anhui and died of tuberculosis in 1933.
* Zhang Qinqiu, Shen Zemin&#x27;s wife, married Chen Changhao after Shen&#x27;s death. She is often considered the only &quot;woman general&quot; of the Red Army (which never formally awarded military ranks). After 1949, she was appointed Deputy Minister of Textile Industry, but committed suicide in the Cultural Revolution.
* Yin Jian was arrested by Kuomintang when he mobilized workers in Northern China, and was subsequently executed.
* Li Zhusheng was promoted to the Politburo after Wang Ming&#x27;s return to Moscow in 1931, and put in charge of the daily affairs of the Communist Party in Shanghai. He was later arrested, but defected to the Kuomintang, and informed on many of his former compatriots. After the KMT&#x27;s defeat, Li was arrested by the Communists in Shanghai in 1951, and subsequently died in prison in 1973.
* Chen Yuandao was appointed as senior leader for the Jiangsu and Henan Division of the Communist Party, but was later arrested and executed by the Kuomintang in Nanjing.
* Xu Yixin worked for Zhang Guotao&#x27;s 4th Red Army and became his vice general commissar, surviving war and party purges. After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Xu held the position of ambassador in the Foreign Ministry. He died in the 1990s.
* Yuan Jiayong was appointed General Secretary of the Jiangsu Division in the Communist Party. Following his arrest in 1934, he defected to the Kuomintang and worked for the secret police.
* He Zishu worked for the Northern China Bureau of the Communist Party, and was executed by the Kuomintang in 1929.
* Wang Shengrong, a member of the first Central Military Commission of the Chinese Soviet Republic, survived both war and purges. He died on 1 September 2006 at the age of 99.
* Wang Yuncheng succeeded Wang Ming as General Secretary of the Jiangsu Division in the Communist Party. He was kidnapped by the Kuomintang and forced to work with Li Zhusheng in the secret police.
* Sheng Zhongliang was senior leader of the Shanghai Division in the Communist Party, and was sold out by Li Zhusheng. He was coerced into informing for the Kuomintang&#x27;s secret police. Sheng, after moving to the US, later wrote memoirs of his time at the Sun Yat-sen University and with the 28 Bolsheviks.
* Song Panmin also worked for Zhang Guotao, but was executed when he objected to the purges being carried out by Xia Xi.
* Sun Jiming, a senior Communist Party leader, was arrested and defected to the Kuomintang together with Wang Yuncheng.
* Wang Shengdi and Zhu Agen left the Communist Party, though both had held senior positions.
* Wang Baoli, Zhu Zisun, Li Yuanjue, and Du Zuoxian left public life and their fates are not known.

<doc id="763298" wikidata="Q2916285" url="?curid=763298" title="Sephardi Hebrew">
<text>Sephardi Hebrew (or Sepharadi Hebrew; , ) is the pronunciation system for Biblical Hebrew favored for liturgical use by Sephardi Jews. Its phonology was influenced by contact languages such as Spanish and Portuguese, Judaeo-Spanish (Ladino), Judeo-Arabic dialects, and Modern Greek.

== Phonology ==
There is some variation between the various forms of Sephardi Hebrew, but the following generalisations may be made:
*The stress tends to fall on the last syllable wherever that is the case in Biblical Hebrew.
*The letter ע (`ayin) is realized as a sound, but the specific sound varies between communities. One pronunciation associated with the Hebrew of Western Sephardim (Spanish and Portuguese Jews of Northern Europe and their descendants) is a velar nasal () sound, as in English &quot;singing&quot;, but other Sephardim of the Balkans, Anatolia, North Africa, and the Levant maintain the pharyngeal sound of Yemenite Hebrew or Arabic of their regional coreligionists. 
*/r/ is invariably alveolar trill or tap (like Spanish r), rather than uvular (the r common to several German and Yiddish dialects, or better known as the French r).
*/t/ and /d/ are more often realized as dental plosives, rather than alveolar.
*There is always a phonetic distinction between (tav) and (samekh).
*The Sephardi dialects observe the Kimhian five-vowel system (a e i o u), either with or without distinctions of vowel length:
**Tsere is pronounced , not as may be found in Ashkenazi Hebrew
**Holam is pronounced , not or as may be found in Ashkenazi Hebrew
**Kamats gadol is pronounced , not as in Ashkenazi, Yemenite, or Tiberian Hebrew

This last difference is the standard shibboleth for distinguishing Sephardi from Ashkenazi, Yemenite, and Tiberian Hebrew. The differentiation between kamatz gadol and kamatz katan is made according to purely phonetic rules, without regard to etymology, which occasionally leads to spelling pronunciations at variance with the rules laid down in Biblical Hebrew grammar books. For example, כָל (all), when unhyphenated, is pronounced &quot;kal&quot;, rather than &quot;kol&quot; (in &quot;kal &#x27;atsmotai&quot; and &quot;Kal Nidre&quot;), and צָהֳרַיִם (noon) is pronounced &quot;tsahorayim&quot;, rather than &quot;tsohorayim&quot;. This feature is also found in Mizrahi Hebrew, but is not found in Israeli Hebrew. It is represented in the transliteration of proper names in the Authorised Version, such as &quot;Naomi&quot;, &quot;Aholah&quot; and &quot;Aholibamah&quot;.

==Variants==

Sephardim differ on the pronunciation of &quot;bet raphe&quot; (, &quot;bet&quot; without &quot;dagesh&quot;). Persian, Moroccan, Greek, Turkish, Balkan and Jerusalem Sephardim usually pronounce it as , which is reflected in Modern Hebrew. Spanish and Portuguese Jews traditionally pronounced it as (as do most Mizrahi Jews), but that is declining under the influence of Israeli Hebrew.

That may reflect changes in the pronunciation of Spanish. In Medieval Spanish (and in Judaeo-Spanish), &quot;b&quot; and &quot;v&quot; were separate, with &quot;b&quot; representing a voiced bilabial stop and &quot;v&quot; realized as a bilabial fricative [β]. However, in Renaissance and modern Spanish, both are pronounced (bilabial v) after a vowel (or continuant) and otherwise (such as after a pause).

There is also a difference in the pronunciation of &quot;tau raphe&quot; (, &quot;tau&quot; without &quot;dagesh&quot;):
*The normal Sephardi pronunciation (reflected in Israeli Hebrew) is as an unvoiced dental plosive ();
*Greek Sephardim (like some Mizrahi Jews, such as Iraqis and Yemenites) pronounced it as a voiceless dental fricative ();
*Some Spanish and Portuguese Jews and Sephardim from the Spanish-Moroccan tradition pronounce it as a voiced dental plosive or fricative (see lenition).

Closely related to the Sephardi pronunciation is the Italian pronunciation of Hebrew, which may be regarded as a variant.

In communities from Italy, Greece and Turkey, &quot;he&quot; is not realized as but as a silent letter because of the influence of Italian, Judaeo-Spanish and (to a lesser extent) Modern Greek, all of which lack the sound. That was also the case in early transliterations of Spanish-Portuguese manuscripts (&quot;Ashkibenu&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Hashkibenu&quot;), but &quot;he&quot; is now consistently pronounced in those communities. Basilectal Modern Hebrew also shares that characteristic, but it is considered substandard.

In addition to ethnic and geographical distinctions, there are some distinctions of register. Popular Sephardic pronunciation, such as for Spanish and Portuguese Jews, makes no distinction between &quot;pataḥ&quot; and &quot;qameṣ gadol&quot; [a], or between &quot;segol&quot;, &quot;ṣere&quot; and &quot;shewa na&quot; [e]: that is inherited from the old Palestinian vowel notation. In formal liturgical use, however, many Sephardim are careful to make some distinction between these vowels to reflect the Tiberian notation. (That can be compared to the attempts of some Ashkenazim to use the pharyngeal sounds of &quot;ḥet&quot; and &quot;ayin&quot; in formal contexts, such as reading the Torah.)

==History==
In brief, Sephardi Hebrew appears to be a descendant of the Palestinian tradition, partially adapted to accommodate the Tiberian notation and further influenced by the pronunciation of Judeo-Arabic dialects and Judaeo-Spanish (Ladino).

The origins of the different Hebrew reading traditions reflect older differences between the pronunciations of Hebrew and Middle Aramaic current in different parts of the Fertile Crescent: Judea, the Galilee, Greater Syria, Upper Mesopotamia, and Lower Mesopotamia (&quot;Babylonia&quot;). In the time of the Masoretes (8th-10th centuries), there were three distinct notations for denoting vowels and other details of pronunciation in biblical and liturgical texts. One was the Babylonian; another was the Palestinian; still another was Tiberian Hebrew, which eventually superseded the other two and is still in use today. By the time of Saadia Gaon and Jacob Qirqisani, Palestinian Hebrew had come to be regarded as standard, even in Babylonia. That development roughly coincided with the popularisation of the Tiberian notation.
The accepted rules of Hebrew grammar were laid down in medieval Spain by grammarians such as Judah ben David Hayyuj and Jonah ibn Janah and later restated in a modified form by the Kimhi family; the current Sephardic pronunciation largely reflects the system that it laid down. By then, the Tiberian notation was universally used though it was not always reflected in pronunciation. The Spanish grammarians accepted the rules laid down by the Tiberian Masoretes, with the following variations:
#The traditional Sephardic pronunciation of the vowels (inherited, as it seems, from the old Palestinian system) was perpetuated. Their failure to fit the Tiberian notation was rationalised by the theory that the distinctions between Tiberian symbols represented differences of length rather than quality: &quot;pataẖ&quot; was short &quot;a&quot;, &quot;qamats&quot; was long &quot;a&quot;, &quot;segol&quot; was short &quot;e&quot; and &quot;tsere&quot; was long &quot;e&quot;.
#The theory of long and short vowels was also used to adapt Hebrew to the rules of Arabic poetic meter. For example, in Arabic (and Persian) poetry, when a long vowel occurs in a closed syllable an extra (short) syllable is treated as present for metrical purposes but is not represented in pronunciation. Similarly in Sephardic Hebrew a &quot;shewa&quot; after a syllable with a long vowel is invariably treated as vocal. (In Tiberian Hebrew, that is true only when the long vowel is marked with a &quot;meteg&quot;.)

There are further differences:
*Sephardim now pronounce &quot;shewa na&quot; as in all positions, but the older rules (as in the Tiberian system) were more complicated.
*&quot;Resh&quot; is invariably pronounced by Sephardim as a &quot;front&quot; alveolar trill; in the Tiberian system, the pronunciation appears to have varied with the context and so it was treated as a letter with a double (sometimes triple) pronunciation.

== Influence on Israeli Hebrew ==

When Eliezer ben Yehuda drafted his Standard Hebrew language, he based it on Sephardi Hebrew, both because this was the &quot;de facto&quot; spoken form as a lingua franca in the land of Israel and because he believed it to be the most beautiful of the Hebrew dialects. However, the phonology of Modern Hebrew is in some respects constrained to that of Ashkenazi Hebrew, including the elimination of pharyngeal articulation and the conversion of from an alveolar tap to a voiced uvular fricative, though this latter sound was rare in Ashkenazi Hebrew, in which uvular realizations were more commonly a trill or tap, and in which alveolar trills or taps were also common.

<doc id="763311" wikidata="Q34291" url="?curid=763311" title="Yemenite Hebrew">
<text>Yemenite Hebrew (), also referred to as Temani Hebrew, is the pronunciation system for Hebrew traditionally used by Yemenite Jews. Yemenite Hebrew has been studied by language scholars, many of whom believe it retains older phonetic and grammatical features lost elsewhere. Yemenite speakers of Hebrew have garnered considerable praise from language purists because of their use of grammatical features from classical Hebrew.

Some scholars believe that its phonology was heavily influenced by spoken Yemeni Arabic. Other scholars, including Yosef Qafih and Abraham Isaac Kook, hold the view that Yemenite Arabic did not influence Yemenite Hebrew, as this type of Arabic was also spoken by Yemenite Jews and is distinct from the liturgical and conversational Hebrew of the communities. Among other things, Qafih noted that the Yemenite Jews spoke Arabic with a distinct Jewish flavor, inclusive of pronouncing many Arabic words with vowels foreign to the Arabic language, e.g., the qamatz () and tzere (). He argues that the pronunciation of Yemenite Hebrew was not only uninfluenced by Arabic, but it influenced the pronunciation of Arabic by those Jews, despite the Jewish presence in Yemen for over a millennium.

==History==
Yemenite Hebrew may have been derived from, or influenced by, the Hebrew of the Talmudic academies in Babylonia: the oldest Yemenite manuscripts use the Babylonian vocalization, which is believed to antedate the Tiberian vocalization. As late as 937, Jacob Qirqisani wrote: &quot;The biblical readings which are wide-spread in Yemen are in the Babylonian tradition.&quot; Indeed, in many respects, such as the assimilation of &quot;paṯaḥ&quot; and &quot;səġūl&quot;, the current Yemenite pronunciation fits the Babylonian notation better than the Tiberian (though the Babylonian notation does not reflect the approximation between &quot;holam&quot; and &quot;sere&quot; in some Yemenite dialects). This is because in the Babylonian tradition of vocalization there is no distinct symbol for the &quot;səġūl&quot;. It does not follow, as claimed by some scholars, that the pronunciation of the two communities was identical, any more than the pronunciation of Sephardim and Ashkenazim is the same because both use the Tiberian symbols. 

The following chart shows the seven vowel paradigms found in the Babylonian supralinear punctuation, which are reflected to this day by the Yemenite pronunciation of Biblical lections and liturgies, though they now use the Tiberian symbols. For example, there is no separate symbol for the Tiberian &quot;səġūl&quot; and the &quot;pataḥ&quot; and amongst Yemenites they have the same phonetic sound. In this connection, the Babylonian vowel signs remained in use in Yemen long after the Babylonian Biblical tradition had been abandoned, almost until our own time.

==Distinguishing features==
The following chart shows the phonetic values of the Hebrew letters in the Yemenite Hebrew pronunciation tradition.
Yemenites have preserved the sounds for each of the six double-sounding consonants: &quot;bəged-kəfet&quot; (). The following are examples of their peculiar way of pronunciation of these and other letters:
*&quot;gímel/ǧimal&quot; () with the &quot;dāḡēš/dageš&quot; is pronounced . Thus, the verse is realized as, &quot;u&#x27;mi, ǧoi ǧaḏol&quot; () (as in Sanʽani Arabic ǧīm /d͡ʒ/ but unlike Taʽizzi-Adeni Arabic /g/).
*&quot;gímel/gimal&quot; () without &quot;dāḡēš/dageš&quot; is pronounced , like Arabic ġayn .
*&quot;dāleṯ/dal&quot; () without &quot;dāḡēš/dageš&quot; is pronounced , like Arabic ḏāl . Thus, the word in &quot;Shema Yisrael&quot; is always pronounced &quot;aḥoḏ&quot; ().
*The pronunciation of &quot;tāv/taw&quot; () without &quot;dāḡēš/dageš&quot; as (shared by other Mizrahi Hebrew dialects such as Iraqi). Thus, &quot;Sabbath day&quot; is pronounced in Yemenite Hebrew, &quot;Yom ha-Shabboth&quot; ().
*&quot;vāv/waw&quot; () is pronounced (as in Iraqi Hebrew and in Arabic).
*Emphatic and guttural letters have nearly the same sounds and are produced from deep in the throat, as in Arabic.
*&quot;ḥêṯ/ħet&quot; () is a voiceless pharyngeal fricative, equivalent to Arabic ح .
*&quot;ʻáyin/ʕajin&quot; () is identical to Arabic , and is a voiced pharyngeal fricative. (The Sephardic pronunciation of ע, however, is of a weaker nature.)
*&quot;tsadi&quot; () is not a voiceless alveolar sibilant affricate &quot;ts&quot; among the Yemenites, but rather a deep-sounding &quot;s&quot; (pharyngealized fricative). 
*&quot;qof&quot; () is pronounced by the Yemenites (other than the Jews from Shar&#x27;ab) as a voiced /g/, (as in Sanʽani Arabic gāf /g/ but unlike Taʽizzi-Adeni Arabic /q/) and is in keeping with their tradition that a different phonetic sound is given for &quot;gímel&quot;/&quot;gimal&quot; (see &quot;supra&quot;).
*&quot;resh&quot; () is pronounced as an alveolar trill /r/, rather than the uvular trill [ʀ], and is identical to Arabic &quot;&quot; and follows the conventions of old Hebrew.
*The &quot;kaf sofit&quot; with a dagesh () is pronounced as such, as in the rare example of the last word in Psalm 30.

===Vowels===
*&quot;Qāmaṣ gāḏôl/Qamac qadol&quot; is pronounced , as in Ashkenazi Hebrew and Tiberian Hebrew. The Yemenite pronunciation for &quot;Qamats gadol&quot; () and &quot;Qamats qatan&quot; () is identical (see &quot;infra&quot;.).
*There is no distinction between the vowels &quot;paṯaḥ/pataħ&quot; and &quot;səḡôl/segol&quot; all being pronounced , like the Arabic &quot;fatḥa&quot; (a feature also found in old Babylonian Hebrew, which used a single symbol for all three). A &quot;šəwâ nāʻ/šwa naʕ&quot;, however, is identical to a חטף פתח and חטף סגול.
*Final &quot;hê/hej&quot; with &quot;mappîq/mefiq&quot; has an aspirated sound, generally stronger sounding than the regular &quot;hê/hej&quot;. &quot;Aleph&quot; (אַלַף) with a &quot;dagesh&quot;, a rare occurrence, is pronounced with a glottal stop, e.g., the word וַיָּבִיאּוּ in Genesis 43:26. Conversely, some words in Hebrew which are written with the final &quot;hê&quot; ending (without the &quot;mappîq&quot;) are realized by a secondary glottal stop and so are abruptly cut short, as to hold one&#x27;s breath.
*A semivocalic sound is heard before &quot;paṯaḥ gānûḇ/pataħ ganuv&quot; (furtive &quot;paṯaḥ&quot; coming between a long vowel and a final guttural): thus &quot;ruaħ&quot; (spirit) sounds like &quot;rúwwaḥ&quot; and &quot;siaħ&quot; (speech) sounds like &quot;síyyaḥ&quot;. (That is shared with other Mizrahi pronunciations, such as the Syrian.)

Yemenite pronunciation is not uniform, and Morag has distinguished five sub-dialects, the best known being probably Sana&#x27;ani, originally spoken by Jews in and around Sana&#x27;a. Roughly, the points of difference are as follows:
*In some dialects, &quot;ḥōlem/ħolam&quot; (long &quot;o&quot; in modern Hebrew) is pronounced , but in others, it is pronounced like &quot;ṣêrệ/cerej&quot;. (The last pronunciation is shared with Lithuanian Jews.)
*Some dialects (e.g. Sharab) do not differentiate between &quot;bêṯ/bet&quot; with &quot;dāḡēš/dageš&quot; and without it. That occurs most of Mizrahi Hebrew.
*Sana&#x27;ani Hebrew primarily places stress on the penultimate syllable, as in Ashkenazi Hebrew.

====&quot;Qamats Gadol&quot; and &quot;Qamats Qatan&quot;====
Yemenite reading practices continue the orthographic conventions of the early grammarians, such as Abraham ibn Ezra and Aaron Ben-Asher. One basic rule of grammar states that every word with a long vowel sound, that is, one of either five vowel sounds whose mnemonics are &quot;pītūḥe ḥöthom&quot; (i.e. &quot;ḥiraq&quot;, &quot;šūraq&quot;, &quot;ṣeré&quot;, &quot;ḥölam&quot; and &quot;qamaṣ&quot;), whenever there is written beside one of these long vowel sounds a &quot;meteg&quot; (or what is also called a &quot;ga’ayah&quot;) and is denoted by a small vertical line below the word (e.g. under the ז in זָֽכְרוּ), it indicates that the vowel (in that case, &quot;qamaṣ&quot;) must be drawn out with a prolonged sound. For example, ōōōōōō, instead of ō, (e.g. &quot;zoː— khǝ ru&quot;). In the Sephardic tradition, however, the practice is different altogether, and they will also alter the phonetic sound of the short vowel &quot;qamaṣ qattön&quot; whenever the vowel appears alongside a &quot;meteg&quot; (a small vertical line), reading it as the long vowel &quot;qamaṣ gadöl&quot;, giving to it the sound of &quot;a&quot;, as in &quot;ca&quot;r, instead of &quot;ōōōōō.&quot; Thus, for the verse in , the Sephardic Jews will pronounce the word כָּל as &quot;kal&quot; (e.g. &quot;kal ʕaṣmotai&quot;, etc.), instead of &quot;kol ʕaṣmotai&quot; as pronounced by both Yemenite and Ashkenazi Jewish communities.

The &quot;meteg&quot;, or &quot;ga’ayah&quot;, has actually two functions: (1) It extends the sound of the vowel; (2) It makes any šewa that is written immediately after the vowel a mobile &quot;šewa&quot;, meaning, the &quot;šewa&quot; itself becomes . For example: = &quot;ʔö mǝ rim&quot;, = &quot;šö mǝ rim&quot;, = &quot;sī sǝ ra&quot;, = &quot;šū vǝ kha&quot;, and = &quot;tū vǝ kha&quot;. Examples with &quot;meteg/ga’ayah&quot;: = &quot;šoː mǝ ro&quot;, = &quot;ye rǝ du.&quot;

The &quot;Qamats qatan&quot; is realized as the non-extended &quot;o&quot;-sound in the first &quot;qamats&quot; (&quot;qamaṣ&quot;) in the word, חָכְמָה ⇒ &quot;ḥokhma&quot; (wisdom).

The Yemenite &quot;qamaṣ&quot; is represented in the transliterated texts by the diaphoneme . The vowel quality is the same, whether for a long or short vowel, but the long vowel sound is always prolonged.

====&quot;Holam&quot; and &quot;sere&quot;====
A distinct feature of Yemenite Hebrew is that there is some degree of approximation between the &quot;ḥōlam&quot; and the &quot;ṣêrệ&quot;. To the untrained ear, they may sound as the same phoneme, but Yemenite grammarians will point out the difference. The feature varies by dialect:

*In the standard, provincial pronunciation that is used by most Yemenite Jews, &quot;holam&quot; is pronounced as . For example, the word &quot;shalom&quot; (), is pronounced &quot;sholøm&quot;.
*In some provincial dialects, in particular that of Aden, &quot;holam&quot; becomes a long &quot;e&quot; and is indeed indistinguishable from &quot;sere&quot;, and some early manuscripts sometimes confuse or interchange the symbols for the two sounds.

Some see the assimilation of the two vowels as a local variant within the wider Babylonian family, which the Yemenites happened to follow.

==== Strict application of Mobile Shewā ====
Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook and Rabbi Jacob Saphir have praised the Yemenites in their correct pronunciation of Hebrew. They still read the biblical lections and liturgies according to what is prescribed for Hebrew grammar and are meticulous to pronounce the mobile &quot;šĕwā&quot; in each of its changing forms. While most other communities also adhere to the rule of mobile &quot;šĕwā&quot; whenever two &quot;šĕwā&quot;s are written one after the other, as in , most have forgotten its other usages.
Aharon Ben-Asher, in his treatise on the proper usage of Hebrew vowels and trope symbols, writes on the &quot;šĕwā&quot;: &quot;[It is] the servant of all the letters in the entire Scriptures, whether at the beginning of the word, or in the middle of the word, or at the end of the word; whether what is pronounced by the tongue or not pronounced, for it has many ways… However, if it is joined with one of four [guttural] letters, , its manner [of pronunciation] will be like the manner of the vowel of the second letter in that word, such as: = &quot;böhonoth&quot;; = &quot;te’ehavu&quot;; = &quot;leḥeləkhah&quot;; = &quot;reʻeloyoh&quot;.&quot; 
On the mobile &quot;šĕwā&quot; and its usage amongst Yemenite Jews, Israeli grammarian Shelomo Morag wrote: &quot;The pronunciation of the &quot;šĕwā&quot; mobile preceding in the Yemenite tradition is realized in accordance with the vowel following the guttural; quantitatively, however, this is an ultra-short vowel. For example, a word such as is pronounced &quot;wuḥuṭ&quot;. A &quot;šĕwā&quot; preceding a &quot;yōḏ&quot; is pronounced as an ultra-short &quot;ḥīreq&quot;: the word is pronounced &quot;biyōm&quot;. This is the way the &quot;šĕwā&quot; is known to have been pronounced in the Tiberian tradition.&quot;

Other examples of words of the mobile &quot;šĕwā&quot; in the same word taking the phonetic sound of the vowel assigned to the adjacent guttural letter or of a mobile &quot;šĕwā&quot; before the letter &quot;yod&quot; (י) taking the phonetic sound of the &quot;yod&quot;, can be seen in the following: 
*(Gen. 48:21) = &quot;weheshiv&quot;
*(Gen. 49:30) = &quot;bamoʻoroh&quot;
*(Gen. 50:10) = &quot;beʻevar&quot;
*(Exo. 7:27) = &quot;wi’im&quot;
*(Exo. 20:23) = &quot;mizbiḥī&quot;
*(Deut. 11:13) = &quot;wohoyoh&quot;
*(Psalm 92:1–3)
 &quot;liyöm&quot; – &quot;lohödöth&quot; – &quot;lahaǧīd&quot;

The above rule applies only to when one of the four guttural letters (אחהע), or a &quot;yod&quot; (י) or a resh (ר) follows the mobile &quot;šĕwā&quot;, but it does not apply to the other letters; then, the mobile &quot;šĕwā&quot; is always read as a short-sounding &quot;pataḥ&quot;.

== Distinctive pronunciations preserved ==
Geographically isolated for centuries, the Yemenite Jews constituted a peculiar phenomenon within Diaspora Jewry. In their isolation, they preserved specific traditions of both Hebrew and Aramaic. The traditions, transmitted from generation to generation through the teaching and reciting of the Bible, post-biblical Hebrew literature (primarily the Mishnah), the Aramaic Targums of the Bible, and the Babylonian Talmud, are still alive. They are manifest in the traditional manner of reading Hebrew that is practised by most members of the community. The Yemenite reading traditions of the Bible are now based on the Tiberian text and vocalization, as proofread by the masorete, Aaron ben Asher, with the one exception that the vowel &quot;sǝġūl&quot; is pronounced as a &quot;pataḥ&quot;, since the &quot;sǝġūl&quot; did not exist in the Babylonian orthographic tradition to which the Jews of Yemen had previously been accustomed. In what concerns Biblical orthography, with the one exception of the &quot;sǝgūl&quot;, the Yemenite Jewish community does not differ from any other Jewish community.

Although the vast majority of post-Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic words are pronounced the same way or nearly the same way by all of Israel&#x27;s diverse ethnic groups, including the Jews of Yemen, there are still other words whose phonemic system differs greatly from the way it is used in Modern Hebrew, the sense here being the tradition of vocalization or diction of selective Hebrew words found in the Mishnah and Midrashic literature, or of Aramaic words found in the Talmud, and which tradition has been meticulously preserved by the Jews of Yemen. Two of the more recognized Yemenite pronunciations are for the words and , the first pronounced as &quot;Ribbi&quot;, instead of Rabbi (as in Rabbi Meir), and the second pronounced &quot;guvra&quot;, instead of &quot;gavra&quot;. In the first case, archaeologist Benjamin Mazar was the first to discover its linguistic usage in the funerary epigrams of the 3rd and 4th-century CE, during excavations at the catacombs in Beit She&#x27;arim. Nahman Avigad, speaking of the same, wrote: &quot;Of special interest is the title Rabbi and its Greek transliteration (). In the inscriptions of Beth She&#x27;arim found in the former seasons and are usual, and only once do we find , which has been regarded as a defective form of , for in Greek we generally find the form (). The transliteration () found here shows that the title was pronounced in Palestine in different ways, sometimes &quot;Rabbi&quot; (ΡΑΒΒΙ, ΡΑΒΙ), sometimes &quot;Ribbi&quot; (ΡΙΒΒΙ, ΡΙΒΙ) and occasionally even &quot;Rebbi&quot; (ΒΗΡΕΒΙ).&quot; In the latter case, the Jerusalem Talmud occasionally brings down the word in &quot;plene scriptum&quot;, (pl. for ), showing that its pronunciation was the same as that in use by the Yemenites. Some have raised the proposition that the Yemenite linguistic tradition dates back to the Amoraim.

R. Yehudai Gaon, in his &quot;Halakhot Pesukot&quot; (Hil. &quot;Berakhot&quot;), uses &quot;yod&quot; as the &quot;mater lectionis&quot; to show the vowel &quot;hiriq&quot;, after the &quot;qoph&quot; () in &quot;Qiryat Shema&quot; (). The editor of the critical edition, A. Israel, who places its composition in Babylonia, notes that &quot;linguists would take an interest&quot; in Yehudai Gaon&#x27;s variant spellings of words, where especially the &quot;matres lectionis&quot; is used in place of vowels, &quot;represented either by a plene &quot;alef&quot; (), &quot;waw&quot; (), and &quot;yod&quot; ().&quot; The use of the &quot;matres lectionis&quot; in place of the vowel &quot;hiriq&quot; in the construct case of the words קִרְיַת שְׁמַע (&quot;recital of Shemaʻ&quot; = קירית שמע) reflects apparently the Babylonian tradition of pronunciation, and, today, the same tradition is mirrored in the Yemenite pronunciation of &quot;Qiryat shemaʻ&quot;.

The following diagrams show a few of the more conspicuous differences in the Yemenite tradition of vocalization and which Israeli linguist, Shelomo Morag, believes reflects an ancient form of vocalizing the texts and was once known and used by all Hebrew-speakers.

Notes on transliteration: In the Yemenite Jewish tradition, the vowel &quot;qamaṣ&quot; , represents . The Hebrew character &quot;Tau&quot; (), without a dot of accentuation, represents . The Hebrew character &quot;Gimal&quot; (), with a dot of accentuation, represents . The Hebrew word (in the above middle column, and meaning &#x27;a thing detestable&#x27;), is written in Yemenite Jewish tradition with a vowel &quot;qamaṣ&quot; beneath the , but since it is followed by the letters it represents . The vowel &quot;ḥolam&quot; in the Yemenite dialect is transcribed here with , and represents a front rounded vowel. Another peculiarity with the Yemenite dialect is that the vast majority of Yemenite Jews (excluding the Jews of Sharab in Yemen) will replace , used here in transliteration of texts, with the phonetic sound of .

In the Yemenite tradition, the plural endings on the words (&quot;merits&quot;), (&quot;kingdoms&quot;), (&quot;exiles&quot;), (&quot;errors&quot;), (&quot;defective animals&quot;) and (&quot;testimonies&quot;), all differ from the way they are vocalized in Modern Hebrew. In Modern Hebrew, these words are marked with a &quot;shuraq&quot;, as follows: – – – – – . Although the word (&quot;kingdoms&quot;) in Daniel 8:22 is vocalized &quot;malkhuyoth&quot;, as it is in Modern Hebrew, Shelomo Morag thinks that the Yemenite tradition reflects a phonological phenomenon known as dissimilation, whereby similar consonants or vowels in a word become less similar. Others explain the discrepancy as being in accordance with a general rule of practice, prevalent in the 2nd century CE, where the Hebrew in rabbinic literature was distinguished from that of Biblical Hebrew, and put into an entire class and category of its own, with its own rules of vocalization (see &quot;infra&quot;).

The Hebrew noun (&quot;ḥăṯīkkah&quot;), in the upper left column, is a word meaning &quot;slice/piece&quot; (in the absolute state), or (&quot;piece of meat&quot;) in the construct state. The noun is of the same metre as (&quot;qǝlipah&quot;), a word meaning &quot;peel,&quot; or the &quot;rind&quot; of a fruit. Both the &quot;kaph&quot; and &quot;pe&quot; in these nouns are with a &quot;dagesh&quot;. However, the same roots applied to different meters, serving as gerunds, as in &quot;slicing/cutting&quot; [meat] and &quot;peeling&quot; [an apple], the words would respectively be (&quot;ḥăṯīḫah&quot;) and (&quot;qǝlīfah&quot;), without a &quot;dagesh&quot; in the Hebrew characters &quot;Kaph&quot; and &quot;Pe&quot; (i.e. &quot;rafe&quot; letters), such as when the verb is used with the preposition &quot;after&quot;: e.g. &quot;after peeling the apple&quot; = , or &quot;after cutting the meat&quot; = .

In the Talmud , the Sages of Israel had a practice to read words derived from the Scriptures in their own given way, while the same words derived from the Talmud or in other exegetical literature (known as the Midrash) in a different way: &quot;When Isse the son of Hinei went up [there], he found Rabbi Yoḥanan teaching [a certain Mishnah] to the creations, saying, &quot;raḥelim&quot; (i.e. = the Hebrew word for &quot;ewes&quot;), etc. He said to him, &#x27;Teach it [by its Mishnaic name = ], &quot;raḥeloth&quot;!&#x27; He replied, &#x27;[What I say is] as it is written [in the Scriptures]: Ewes (&quot;raḥelim&quot;), two-hundred.&#x27; He answered him, &#x27;The language of the Torah is by itself, and the language employed by the Sages is by itself!&#x27;&quot; ().

This passage from the Talmud is often quoted by grammarians of Yemenite origin to explain certain &quot;discrepancies&quot; found in vocalization of words where a comparable source can be found in the Hebrew Bible, such as the Yemenite tradition in rabbinic literature to say (&quot;maʻbīr&quot;), rather than (&quot;maʻăvīr&quot;) – although the latter rendering appears in Scripture , or to say (&quot;zīʻah&quot;), with &quot;ḥīraq&quot;, rather than, (&quot;zeʻah&quot;), with &quot;ṣerê&quot;, although it too appears in Scripture , or to say (&quot;birkhath ha-mazon&quot;) (= &quot;kaph&quot; rafe), rather than as the word &quot;blessing&quot; in the construct state which appears in the Scriptures , e.g. &quot;birkath Avraham&quot; (), with &quot;kaph&quot; dagesh. Others, however, say that these anomalies reflect a tradition that antedates the Tiberian Masoretic texts.

Along these same lines, the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible renders the words (), in II Chronicles 26:6, and (), in Nehemiah 7:37; 11:35, as &quot;yävnɛ&quot; and &quot;lōð&quot;, respectively. However, in their demotic-forms, the Yemenites will pronounce these words as () and () = &quot;yovnei&quot; and &quot;lūd&quot;, respectively. The use of the phoneme &quot;ṣerê&quot;, represented by the two dots &quot;◌ֵ&quot;, instead of &quot;pataḥ-səġūl&quot; ( ) for the word &quot;Yavneh&quot; may have been influenced by the Palestinian dialect spoken in the Land of Israel in the 1st-century CE. 

In Yemenite tradition, many words in both Biblical and Mishnaic Hebrew which are written with the final &quot;hê&quot; ending (without the &quot;mappîq&quot;) are realized by a secondary glottal stop, meaning, they are abruptly cut short, as when one holds his breath. Shelomo Morag who treats upon this peculiarity in the Yemenite tradition of vocalization brings down two examples from the Book of Isaiah, although by no means exclusive, where he shows the transliteration for the words in Isaiah 1:27 and in Isaiah 2:5, and both of which represent , as in &quot;tippoːdä(ʔ)&quot; and &quot;wǝnelăχoː(ʔ)&quot; respectively. The word (Bible Codex) in the upper-middle column is pronounced in the same way, e.g. .

Excursus: The preposition () is unique in the Yemenite Jewish tradition. The Hebrew preposition is always written with the noun, joined as one word, and the &quot;lamed&quot; is always accentuated with a &quot;dagesh&quot;. For example, if the noun , would normally have been written with the definite article , as in , and the noun was to show possession, as in the sentence: &quot;the palace &quot;of&quot; the king,&quot; the definite article &quot;the&quot; (Hebrew: ) is dropped, but the same vowel &quot;pataḥ&quot; of the definite article is carried over to the &quot;lamed&quot;, as in , instead of של המלך. The vowel on the &quot;lamed&quot; will sometimes differ, depending on what noun comes after the preposition. For example, the definite article &quot;the&quot; in Hebrew nouns which begin with &quot;aleph&quot; or &quot;resh&quot; and sometimes &quot;ayin&quot;, such as in and in , or in , is written with the vowel &quot;qamaṣ&quot; – in which case, the vowel &quot;qamaṣ&quot; is carried over to the &quot;lamed&quot;, as in and in and in . Another general rule is that whenever a possessive noun is written without the definite article &quot;the&quot;, as in the words, &quot;a king&#x27;s sceptre,&quot; or &quot;the sceptre of a king&quot; (Heb. ), the &quot;lamed&quot; in the preposition is written with the vowel &quot;shǝwa&quot; (i.e. mobile &quot;shǝwa&quot;), as in , and as in, &quot;if it belongs to Israel&quot; ⇒ . Whenever the noun begins with a &quot;shǝwa&quot;, as in the proper noun &quot;Solomon&quot; (Heb. ) and one wanted to show possession, the &quot;lamed&quot; in the preposition is written with a &quot;ḥiraq&quot;, as in (&quot;Song of Solomon&quot; 3:7): ⇒ &quot;Solomon&#x27;s bed&quot;, or as in ⇒ &quot;the punishment the wicked&quot;, or in ⇒ &quot;a bundle heave-offering.&quot;

Another rule of practice in Hebrew grammar is that two &quot;shǝwa&quot;s are never written one after the other at the beginning of any word; neither can two &quot;ḥaṭaf pataḥ&quot;s or two &quot;ḥaṭaf sǝġūl&quot;s be written at the beginning of a word one after the other. The practical implication arising from this rule is that when there is a noun beginning with a &quot;ḥaṭaf pataḥ&quot;, as in the word, ⇒ &quot;her companion&quot;, and one wishes to add thereto the preposition &quot;to&quot; – as in, &quot;to her companion&quot; ⇒ , the &quot;lamed&quot; is written with the vowel &quot;pataḥ&quot;, instead of a &quot;shǝwa&quot; (i.e. a mobile &quot;shǝwa&quot;), seeing that the &quot;shǝwa&quot; at the beginning of a word and the &quot;ḥaṭaf pataḥ&quot;, as well as the &quot;ḥaṭaf sǝġūl&quot;, are all actually one and the same vowel (in the Babylonian tradition), and it is as though he had written two &quot;shǝwa&quot;s one after the other. Likewise, in the possessive case, &quot;belonging to her companion&quot; ⇒ , the &quot;lamed&quot; in the preposition is written with the vowel &quot;pataḥ&quot;.

== Hebrew vernacular ==
The Leiden MS. of the Jerusalem Talmud is important in that it preserves some earlier variants to textual readings of that Talmud, such as in Tractate &quot;Pesaḥim&quot; 10:3 (70a), which brings down the old Palestinian-Hebrew word for &quot;charoseth&quot; (the sweet relish eaten at Passover), viz. &quot;dūkeh&quot; (), instead of &quot;rūbeh/rabah&quot; (), saying with a play on words: &quot;The members of Isse&#x27;s household would say in the name of Isse: Why is it called &quot;dūkeh&quot;? It is because she pounds [the spiced ingredients] with him.&quot; The Hebrew word for &quot;pound&quot; is &quot;dakh&quot; (), which rules out the spelling of &quot; &quot;rabah&quot; &quot; (), as found in the printed editions. Today, the Jews of Yemen, in their vernacular of Hebrew, still call the &quot;charoseth&quot; by the name &quot;dūkeh&quot;.

Other quintessential Hebrew words which have been preserved by the Jews of Yemen is their manner of calling a receipt of purchase by the name, &quot;roʔoːyoː&quot; (), rather than the word &quot;qabbalah&quot; that is now used in Modern Hebrew. The weekly biblical lection read on Sabbath days is called by the name &quot;seder&quot; (), since the word &quot;parashah&quot; () has a completely different meaning, denoting a Bible Codex containing the first Five Books of Moses (plural: codices = ).

Charity; alms (, &quot;miṣwoː&quot;), so-called in Yemenite Jewish parlance, was usually in the form of bread, collected in baskets each Friday before the Sabbath by those appointed over this task for distribution among the needy, without them being brought to shame. The same word is often used throughout the Jerusalem Talmud, as well as in Midrashic literature, to signify what is given out to the poor and needy. Today, in Modern Hebrew, the word is seldom used to imply charity, replaced now by the word, &quot;ts’dakah&quot; (Heb. ). In contrast, the word amongst Jews in Sana’a was a tax levied upon Jewish householders, particularly those whose professions were butchers, and which tax consisted of hides and suet from butchered animals, and which things were sold on a daily basis by the Treasurer, and the money accruing from the sale committed to the public fund for the Jewish poor of the city, which money was distributed to the city&#x27;s poor twice a year; once on Passover, and once on Sukkot. The fund itself was known by the name &quot;toːḏer&quot; (), lit. &quot;the constant [revenues].&quot;

Although Jews in Yemen widely made-use of the South-Arabic word &quot;mukhwāṭ&quot; () for the &quot;metal pointer&quot; (stylus) used in pointing at the letters of sacred writ, they also knew the old Hebrew word for the same, which they called &quot;makhtev&quot; (). The following story is related about this instrument in Midrash Rabba: &quot;Rabban [Shimon] Gamliel says: ‘Five-hundred schools were in Beter, while the smallest of them wasn’t less than three-hundred children. They used to say, ‘If the enemy should ever come upon us, with these &quot;metal pointers&quot; () we’ll go out against them and stab them!’...&quot;

In other peculiar words of interest, they made use of the word, &quot;shilṭön&quot; (), for &quot;governor&quot; or &quot;king,&quot; instead of &quot;government,&quot; the latter word now being the more common usage in Modern Hebrew; &quot;kothev&quot; (), for &quot;scrivener&quot;, or copyist of religious texts, instead of the word &quot;sofer&quot; (scribe); &quot;ṣibbūr&quot; (), for &quot;a quorum of at least ten adult males,&quot; a word used in Yemen instead of the Modern Hebrew word, &quot;minyan&quot;; &quot;ḥefeṣ&quot; (), a noun meaning &quot;desirable thing,&quot; was used by them to describe any &quot;book&quot; (especially one of a prophylactic nature), although now in Modern Hebrew it means &quot;object&quot;; &quot;fiqfūq&quot; () had the connotation of &quot;shock,&quot; &quot;violent agitation,&quot; or &quot;shaking-up,&quot; although today, in Modern Hebrew, it has the meaning of &quot;doubt&quot; or &quot;skepticism&quot;; the word, &quot;harpathqe&quot; (), was used to describe &quot;great hardships,&quot; although in Modern Hebrew the word has come to mean &quot;adventures.&quot; The word &quot;fazmūn&quot; (), any happy liturgical poem, such as those sung on &quot;Simhat Torah&quot;, differs from today&#x27;s Modern Hebrew word, &quot;pizmon&quot; (), meaning, a &quot;chorus&quot; to a song. Another peculiar aspect of Yemenite Hebrew is what concerns denominative verbs. One of the nouns used for bread (made of wheat) is &quot;himmuṣ&quot; (), derived from the blessing that is said whenever breaking bread, = &quot;He that brings forth&quot; [bread from the earth]. Whenever they wanted to say its imperative form, &quot;break bread!&quot;, they made use of the denominative verb &quot;hammeṣ&quot;! (). Similarly, the noun for the Third Sabbath meal was &quot;qiyyūm&quot; (), literally meaning &quot;observance,&quot; in which they made use of the denominative verb, &quot;tǝqayyem&quot; () = &quot;Will you eat with us&quot; (the Third Sabbath meal)?, or, = &quot;Let us eat&quot; (the Third Sabbath meal), or, &quot;qiyam&quot; () = &quot;He ate&quot; (the Third Sabbath meal).

<doc id="763349" wikidata="Q33834791" url="?curid=763349" title="Siddhar">
<text>The Siddhar (Tamil &quot;cittar)&quot; in Tamil tradition is a perfected individual who has attained spiritual powers called &quot;siddhi&quot;.

Historically, Siddhar also refers to the people who were early-age wandering adepts that dominated ancient Tamil teaching and philosophy. They were knowledgeable in science, technology, astronomy, literature, fine arts, music, drama, and dance and provided solutions to common people&#x27;s illnesses and advice for their future. Some of their ideologies are considered to have originated during the First Sangam period.

==Practice==
Siddhars were typically scientists, saints, doctors, alchemists, and mystics all in one. They wrote their findings in the form of Tamil poems on palm leaf manuscripts. They typically believe in one god, but there are some Siddhars who believe in polytheism. These are still owned by some families in Tamil Nadu and handed down through the generations, as well as being kept in universities in India, Germany, Great Britain, and the United States.

In this way, Siddhars developed the native Siddha medicine system. A rustic form of healing that is similar to Siddha medicine has since been practiced by experienced elders in the villages of Tamil Nadu. This is referred to as &quot;pātti vaittiyam&quot; (grandmother&#x27;s medicine), &quot;nāttu maruntu&quot; (folk medicine), and &quot;mūlikai maruttuvam&quot; (herbal medicine).

Siddhars are also believed to be the founders of varma kalai - a martial art for self-defense and medical treatment at the same time with the application of pressure points.

Tamil Siddhars were the first to develop pulse-reading (&quot;naadi paarththal&quot; in Tamil) to identify the origin of diseases.

According to regional belief, the Siddhars are said to have resided for many ages upon a mountain called Sathuragiri, near the Thanipparai village in Tamil Nadu.

== Siddhars ==
The Abithana Chintamani encyclopedia states that the Siddhars are of the 18 persons listed below, but Agastya states that there are many who precede and follow these. 

===The 18 Siddhars===
There are 18 Siddhars in the Tamil Siddha tradition:
# Nandi
# Tirumular
# Agastya
# Kamalamuni (identified with Kalangi Nathar and/or Confucius)
# Patanjali
# Korakkar 
# 
# Vanmikar (Valmiki)
# Dhanvantari
# Idaikaadar
# Machamuni (identified with Matsyendranatha)
# Karuvurar
# Bogar (identified with Laozi)
# Pambatti

Apart from the 18 Siddhars listed above, there is another list of 18 Siddhars who represent the 9 Navagrahas (with two Siddhars representing each Navagraha). All navagraha doshas and pariharams are performed to the Siddhars as Siddhar Velvi (Siddhar havan). The details of the 18 Siddhars who represent the 9 Navagrahas are as follows:

# Sivavakkiyar - Moon
# Kambili - Moon
# Bhogar - Mars
# Kagabhujanga - Jupiter
# Sri Pullipani Siddhar - Mars
# Sattaimuni - Kethu
# Sri Agapai Siddhar - Jupiter
# Alugani - Rahu
# Kudambai - Kethu
# Vallalar - Mercury
# Edaikaddar - Mercury
# Pattinathar - Sun
# Kaduvelli - Sun
# Kanjamalai - Venus
# Sennimalai - Venus
# Kapilar - Saturn
# Karuvurar - Saturn
# Pampatti - Rahu

== Eight Perfections ==
Siddhars are believed to have had both major and minor powers that are described in detail in various yogic and religious texts. 

* &quot;Aṇimā&quot;: the ability to reduce one&#x27;s body to the size of an atom.
* &quot;Mahimā&quot;: the ability to expand one&#x27;s body to an infinitely large size.
* &quot;Laghimā&quot;: the ability to become weightless or lighter than air.
* &quot;Garimā&quot;: the ability to become heavy or dense.
* &quot;Prāpti&quot;: the ability to realize whatever one desires.
* &quot;Prākāmya&quot;: the ability to access any place in the world.
* &quot;Īśiṭva&quot;: the ability to control all material elements or natural forces.
* &quot;Vaśiṭva&quot;: the ability to force influence upon anyone.

These eight are the Great Siddhis (Ashtama siddhis), or Great Perfections.

<text>The northern Idaho ground squirrel (Urocitellus brunneus) is a species of the largest genus of ground squirrels. This species and the southern Idaho ground squirrel were previously considered conspecific, together called the Idaho ground squirrel.

The species is about 233mm in length and weighs 120 to 290 grams. The northern Idaho ground squirrel has sexual dimorphism and a dark-reddish gray coat.

The squirrel hibernates for 8 months and lives in dry meadows in Adams and Valley Counties in western-central Idaho. They eat forbs, grasses, shrubs, trees, rushes, and sedges. The mating season occurs within two weeks from the start of the active period and lasts about 12–13 days. Females only have one litter per year, and there are about five weaned babies per litter, which leave the burrow around late March-early April. 

In 2000, the species was classified as threatened under the Endangered Species Act mostly due to habitat loss. There are about 2000 individuals remaining, but the population is increasing resulting from conservation efforts. A recovery plan for the species was put in place by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2003 and forest restoration for the species is anticipated to be done by 2027.

==Description==
The species has sexual dimorphism, with males being normally larger than females. Their weight ranges from 120 to 290 grams, and they are, on average, 233mm in length, though their range is 209mm to 258mm. They have a dark-reddish grey coat with reddish-brown spots. Some of the northern Idaho ground squirrel&#x27;s qualities include tan feet and ears, a tail, a brownish-grey throat, and a white eye ring.

==Diet and life history==
The northern Idaho ground squirrel has an 8-month hibernation period from August to late April. Their diet consists of mostly forbs, grasses, shrubs, trees, rushes, and sedges. The squirrel&#x27;s active season is from April to July, and then the species spends the rest of the year hibernating.
Within the first two weeks of the active period, the NIDGS starts reproducing. Females reproduce only once per year. In the mating process, the males protect the sexually receptive females from other potential male rivals. Mating occurs over about 2 weeks. Copulations occur underground. Males depart from the female&#x27;s burrow after mating, and they do not provide paternal care to pups or protection to their mates. The gestation period of the species is 3.5 weeks. There are 4-6 weaned pups per litter. Juveniles leave their natal burrow at weaning (late-April to early-May), and begin dispersing soon thereafter. 

The species constructs three types of burrows: nest burrows, auxiliary burrows, and hibernation burrows. Nest burrows are for mating and raising young; they are usually 5–120cm deep, with 3-11 surface openings, 2-13 branching tunnels, and 1-7 chambers; in well-drained soil the nest is in the deepest part of the burrow. The auxiliary (&quot;escape&quot;) burrows do not contain nests; they are linear, less than 50 cm, built 100m from nest burrows, and are constructed in shallow soils. The third burrow type is the hibernation burrow, is a single tunnel that descends deeply 100-150cm. The squirrels disperse the soil around their burrows instead of leaving a pile of soil at the opening, which makes the entrance of the burrows less visible.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The habitat of the northern Idaho ground squirrel consists of dry rocky meadows. Ground with deep soil and scattered with ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir forests at the elevation between 915 and 1,650 meters is the preferred habitat of the squirrels. Original vegetation in the habitat of the NIDGS was big sage brush, bitterbrush, native bunch grasses, and forbs, but now the area is dominated by cheatgrass and medusahead.During the winter, the NIDGS hibernates in environments with larger coverage compared to the active season habitats. The NIDGS mainly hibernates at a completely different habitat than the active season habitat.

The northern Idaho ground squirrel lives in the Adams and Valley Counties in western-central Idaho. The species used to occupy 1,600 km2, but now the species only occupies less than 20 km2. The species is sub-divided into small, isolated populations that survive on isolated islands of suitable but unconnected habitat patches. These populations contain less than 100 individuals, and often less than 20. There are significant genetic differences among populations, due to genetic drift reinforced by lack of genetic interchange (inter-population dispersal) resulting from habitat fragmentation.

Predators of the northern Idaho ground squirrel include prairie falcons, Cooper&#x27;s hawks, goshawks, red-tailed hawks, northern harriers, badgers, coyotes, and long-tailed weasels. The species only has one alarm call for predators, which is given mostly by females when their young leave the natal burrow.

=== Threats ===
The main cause for the decreasing population of the species is habitat loss. In pre-settlement times, these ground squirrels lived in ponderosa pine forests containing meadow terrain. The Native Americans set fires to these forests, which introduced more open terrain in the forests for the squirrels to roam and allowed young trees to infill the meadows they inhabit. In 1910, a movement for fire suppression stopped these fires. Consistent logging efforts in the habitats of northern Idaho ground squirrels have caused the forests to grow back thicker, leaving no open space for the species. Habitat conversion into thicker and wetter environments has also made many original habitats unfit for the squirrels. Cattle and sheep grazing have mixed effects on populations. On the one hand, the diets of cattle and northern Idaho ground squirrel hardly overlap because cattle prefer grasses these ground squirrels prefer forbs. On the other hand, grazing reduces grass seed availability because cattle often consume grasses before they produce seeds and northern Idaho ground squirrels rely heavily on seeds late in the season to fuel their metabolism during hibernation, the time of major mortality. Another reason for the decreasing population of northern Idaho ground squirrels is purposeful killing. From 1933 to 1942, the Payette National Forest poisoned the squirrels because of an untrue assumption that they damaged trees. From 1930 to 1980, farmers poisoned many of squirrels in west-central Idaho for &quot;pest control.&quot;

=== Status ===
In 2000, the northern Idaho ground squirrel was classified as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The most recent numbers from the Idaho Department of Fish and Game suggest the total population of the species is about 2000 individuals. As the population continues to decline, the increased likelihood of inbreeding and decrease in genetic diversity continues to lead the northern Idaho ground squirrel into extinction.

=== Efforts ===
The most recommended option for conserving the northern Idaho ground squirrel is habitat restoration. Since the species utilize two different habitats (one for hibernating in the winter and one for summer), the most effective conservation would be to restore both types of habitats.

Many NIDGS populations have disappeared in recent years, due especially to loss of habitat and reductions in seed availability,
resulting in inadequate pre-hibernation nutrition and starvation overwinter. The U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service put a recovery plan for the northern Idaho ground squirrel in place in 2003. The plan seeks to increase population size and create more metapopulations and care for them until they are self sufficient. For the plan to end, the effective population must increase to over 5,000 individuals. The plan is also using a captive breeding program, in case the effort to increase the wild populations fails.

In August 2022, there was a 5-year review published by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to assess the recovery plan and the species. Research on forest restoration for the squirrel is expected to be done by 2027. Forest thinning followed by prescribed fire and prescribed fire are begin used to restore the NIDGS habitat. 32 acres of land in the Payette National Forest received prescribed fire for the NIDGS habitat. The OX Ranch, near Cuprum, Idaho, signed a Safe Harbor Agreement to support one of the largest populations of the NIDGS with 7,783 acres of land (the ranch has been a crucial part of conservation). The squirrel is still a threatened species.

<text>Procurement is the process of locating and agreeing to terms and purchasing goods, services, or other works from an external source, often with the use of a tendering or competitive bidding process. The term may also refer to a contractual obligation to &quot;procure&quot;, i.e. to &quot;ensure&quot; that something is done. When a government agency buys goods or services through this practice, it is referred to as &quot;government procurement&quot; or public procurement.

Procurement as an organizational process is intended to ensure that the buyer receives goods, services, or works at the best possible price when aspects such as quality, quantity, time, and location are compared. Corporations and public bodies often define processes intended to promote fair and open competition for their business while minimizing risks such as exposure to fraud and collusion.

Almost all purchasing decisions include factors such as delivery and handling, marginal benefit, and fluctuations in the prices of goods. Organisations which have adopted a corporate social responsibility perspective are also likely to require their purchasing activity to take wider societal and ethical considerations into account. On the other hand, the introduction of external regulations concerning accounting practices can affect ongoing buyer-supplier relations in unforeseen manners.

==Overview==
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) defines procurement as an organizational function that includes specification development, value analysis, supplier market research, negotiation, buying activities, contract administration, inventory control, traffic, receiving and stores. Federal US legislation defines procurement as including A company&#x27;s procurement function, specifically its spending on suppliers, typically accounts for more than half of the company&#x27;s total budget.

Purchasing is a subset of procurement that specifically deals with the ordering and payment of goods and services. Organizational procurement is also referred to as &quot;organizational buying&quot; or &quot;institutional buying&quot;, for example in studies of the buying behaviour of staff involved in purchasing decision-making.

Procurement activities are also often divided into two distinct categories, direct and indirect spend. Direct spend refers to the production-related procurement that encompasses all items that are part of finished products, such as raw materials, components and parts. Direct procurement, which is the focus in supply chain management, directly affects the production process of manufacturing firms. In contrast, indirect procurement concerns non-production-related acquisition: a wide variety of goods and services, from standardized items like office supplies and safety equipment to complex and costly products and services like heavy equipment, consulting services, and outsourcing services.

==History==
The first record of procurement activities dates back to 3,000 BC when the Egyptians managed materials and labor for the pyramids using scribes. The scribes recorded how much material and how many workers were needed for different tasks.

Formalized acquisition of goods and services has its roots in military logistics. The Romans developed a system of supply depots that were located throughout their empire. These depots were stocked with food, weapons, and other supplies that could be quickly distributed to troops in the field. This system helped to ensure that the Roman army was always well-supplied, even when it was fighting far from home. 

The first record of what would be recognized now as the purchasing department of an industrial operation relates to the railway companies of the 19th century:
==Sourcing and acquisition==
Procurement is one component of the broader concept of sourcing and acquisition. Typically procurement is viewed as more tactical in nature (the process of physically buying a product or service) and sourcing and acquisition are viewed as more strategic and encompassing. Multiple sourcing business models and acquisition models exist.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) defines strategic sourcing as the process of identifying sources that could provide needed products or services for the acquiring organization. The term procurement is used to reflect the entire purchasing process or cycle, and not just the tactical components. 

Procurement software (often labeled as e-procurement software) manages purchasing processes electronically or via cloud computing.

===Acquisition processes===
Some aspects of a procurement process may need to be initiated ahead of the majority of the project, for example where there are extensive lead times. Such cases may be referred to as &quot;advance procurement&quot;.

Many writers also refer to procurement as a cyclical process, which commences with a definition of business needs and develops a specification, undertakes search activities or places advertising aimed at identifying suppliers and adopts appropriate methods for consulting with them, inviting and evaluating proposals, secures on contract and takes delivery of a new asset or accepts performance of a service, manages the ownership of the asset or the delivery of the service and reaches an end-of-life point where the asset becomes due for replacement or the service contract terminates. At this point the cycle would recommence. Bunn notes that search activities are a central preliminary action to be undertaken before buying decisions can be made.

The Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply (CIPS) recommends involvement of procurement staff and skills from an early stage in the cycle, noting that such &quot;early procurement involvement&quot; can have a beneficial impact on the nature and timing of any approach to market, the specification and the sourcing strategy and supplier selection approach adopted. 

===Decision-making===
Procurement decisions fall along a continuum from simple buying transactions to more complex buyer-supplier collaborations, and the buying behaviour of staff involved in purchasing decision-making has been widely studied. There is a consensus among scholars and marketing managers that buyers utilise various decision processes as appropriate to each buying situation, and some purchasing decisions are especially complex. Some writers treat purchasing decisions as examples of rational behaviour made in the context of a business aim such as profit maximisation and make the assumption that decision-makers have access to the information they need for their decision. Feldman and Cordozo questioned this approach in a 1969 article, suggesting that industrial buyer decision-making had similarities with consumer buying behaviour. David T. Wilson suggested in a 1971 article that an individual buyer&#x27;s personality should be considered in understanding buyers&#x27; decision processes. Three distinct personality traits have been described in the literature on this subject:
*a trait displaying a high need for certainty
*a trait reflecting a high degree of generalised self-confidence
*a need to achieve trait.
Wilson found that there was some correlation between personality traits and decision-making styles among the Canadian buyers who participated in his research study. Jagdish Sheth published &quot;A Model of Industrial Buyer Behaviour&quot; in 1983, which drew from a large volume of empirical study of buyer behaviour and emphasised how the &quot;psychological world of the decision-makers&quot; impacted on the processes and outcomes of purchasing decision-making.

There are wide variations in the involvement of procurement staff in purchasing decisions across types of organisation and across varying purchasing situations. Some purchasing decisions are made by individuals or groups of individuals referred to as a &quot;buying center&quot; or &quot;decision-making unit&quot;, where procurement personnel may in some cases be central, in other cases peripheral, to the purchasing decision. From a marketing perspective, buying center research has looked at which individuals and organisational divisions become part of the decision-making group, how they interact, and the internal and external factors which influence purchasing outcomes. Wesley Johnson and Thomas Bonoma, in a 1981 research paper, found situations where &quot;the purchasing manager&#x27;s centrality is likely to be high&quot;, and equally situations where their centrality &quot;is likely to be low&quot;, recommending that &quot;purchasing managers desiring to increase their influence&quot; should aim to play a pivotal role in the internal communications linking the various individuals and organisational divisions involved.

===Sourcing business model===

There are a number of models along the sourcing continuum: basic provider, approved provider, preferred provider, performance-based contracting, managed services model, vested business model, shared services model and equity partnerships. 
* A basic provider model is transaction-based; it usually has a set price for individual products and services for which there are a wide range of standard market options. Typically these products or services are readily available, with little differentiation in what is offered.
* An approved provider model uses a transaction-based approach where goods and services are purchased from prequalified suppliers that meet certain performance or other selection criteria. 
* The preferred provider model also uses a transaction-based economic model, but a key difference between the preferred provider and the other transaction-based models is that the buyer has chosen to move to a supplier relationship where there is an opportunity for the supplier to add incremental value to the buyer&#x27;s business to meet strategic objectives.
* A performance-based (or managed services model) is generally a formal, longer-term supplier agreement that combines a relational contracting model with an output-based economic model. It seeks to drive supplier accountability for output-based service-level agreements (SLAs) and/or cost reduction targets.
* A vested sourcing business model is a hybrid relationship that combines an outcome-based economic model with a relational contracting model. Companies enter into highly collaborative arrangements designed to create and share value for buyers and suppliers above and beyond.
* A shared services model is typically an internal organization based on an arms-length outsourcing arrangement. Using this approach, processes are often centralized into an SSO that charges business units or users for the services they use. 
* An equity partnership creates a legally binding entity; it can take different legal forms, from buying a supplier (an acquisition), to creating a subsidiary, to equity-sharing joint ventures or entering into cooperative (co-op) arrangements.

== Specific types ==

=== Government procurement ===
=== Sustainable or green procurement ===
=== Electronic procurement ===

Electronic procurement is the purchasing of goods by businesses through the internet or other networked computer connection. Electronic data interchange (EDI) was a forerunner to electronic procurement, this consisted of standardized transmission of data such as inventories and good required electronically. Schoenherr argues that EDI developed from standardized manifests for deliveries to Berlin during the Berlin Airlift which were applied by DuPont in the 1960s and argues that Material requirements planning and Enterprise resource planning were both forerunners to electronic procurement.

=== Joint procurement ===

Joint procurement takes place when two or more organisations share purchasing activities, and therefore has a more specifically buyer-side focus than many examples of collaborative buyer-seller relationships. Companies may decide to work together for the following reasons:
*transaction cost economics approach, where the total transaction costs of the actors involved are lower when they work together
*resource dependence approach, and the resource based view, where the group of actors is able to &quot;create&quot; a resource, market power, which they would be unable to exercise independently
*neo-classical economics&#x27; case, arguing that certain functions become separate, specialised units in order to obtain scale effects
*neo-institutionalism - the argument that actors work together because it is &quot;the&quot; thing to do these days.
Joint or collaborative procurement is a common practice within public sector procurement. There are central purchasing bodies in many countries which coordinate joint purchasing activities for public sector organisations. A report commissioned by the European Parliament&#x27;s Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) has recommended that EU Member States &quot;should consider creating Central Purchasing Bodies (CPBs)&quot; in order to secure &quot;coherent and coordinated procurement&quot;. 

On a trans-national scale, Guyana, Barbados and Rwanda announced &quot;a programme of mutual support for the local manufacturing of vaccines and medicines&quot; in July 2023 for which a &quot;pooled procurement mechanism&quot; would be required.

==Measuring performance==
The Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply (CIPS) promotes a model of &quot;five rights&quot;, which it suggests are &quot;a traditional formula expressing the basic objectives of procurement and the general criteria by which procurement performance is measured&quot;, namely that goods and services purchased should be of the &#x27;right quality&#x27;, in the &#x27;right quantity&#x27;, delivered to the &#x27;right place&#x27; at the &#x27;right time&#x27; and obtained at the &#x27;right price&#x27;. CIPS has in the past also offered an alternative listing of the five rights as &quot;buy[ing] goods or services of the right quality, in the right quantity, from the right source, at the right time and at the right price. &#x27;Right source&#x27; is added as a sixth right in CIPS&#x27; 2018 publication, &quot;Contract Administration&quot;.

Delivery on savings goals is an important part of the procurement function, but this objective is generally seen as value generation rather than cost reduction. CIPS also notes that securing savings is &quot;one measure of purchasing performance&quot;, but argues that savings should only be used as a measure of performance where they are &quot;a reflection of the [organisation]&#x27;s ... expectations of the purchasing and supply management function&quot;. CIPS distinguishes between &quot;savings&quot;, which can reduce budgets, and &quot;cost avoidance&quot;, which &quot;attempts to thwart price increases and to keep within budget&quot;. Examples of savings as a beneficial outcome include:
*agreeing a reduction in price, obtaining the same item for less cost
*sourcing, or developing a supply of, a lower quality item at a reduced cost, where the item is still fit for purpose
*obtaining added value for the same cost, e.g. negotiating extended warranties, additional spare parts etc.

Ardent Partners published a report in 2011 which presented a comprehensive, industry-wide view into what was happening in the world of procurement at that time by drawing on the experience, performance, and perspective of nearly 250 chief procurement officers (CPOs) and other procurement executives. The report included the main procurement performance and operational benchmarks that procurement leaders use to gauge the success of their organizations. This report found that the average procurement department manages 60.6% of total enterprise spend. This measure, commonly called &quot;spend under management&quot; or &quot;managed spend&quot;, refers to the percentage of total enterprise spend (which includes all direct and indirect spend) that a procurement organization manages or influences. Alternatively, the term may refer to the percentage of addressable spend which is influenced by procurement, &quot;addressable spend&quot; being the expenditure which could potentially be influenced. The average procurement department also achieved an annual saving of 6.7% in the last reporting cycle, sourced 52.6% of its addressable spend, and has a contract compliance rate of 62.6%. A more restrictive definition of &quot;spend under management&quot; includes only expenditure which makes use of preferred supplier contracts and negotiated payment rates and terms.

Consultants A.T. Kearney have developed a model for assessing the performance of a procurement organisation or the procurement function within a wider organisation, known as ROSMASM (Return on Supply Management Assets). According to the 2016 ROSMA Performance Check Report, &quot;What Good Looks Like&quot;,

CIPS promotes organisational self-assessment using the ROSMA Performance Check, arguing that it enables a procurement department to &quot;measure and explain procurement and supply&#x27;s value in terms your CFO and CEO will understand, using a common financial standard&quot;. Findings in 2020 suggested that &quot;top quartile procurement performers have ROSMA scores two to three times higher than those in the middle two quartiles&quot;. A.T. Kearney&#x27;s report suggests a close match between the self-reported performance of CPOs in the best performing departments and the view of procurement held by the CFO and the organisation more widely, and also notes that weaker performers or &quot;inconsequentials&quot; share a distinct profile marked by lack of &quot;identifiable leadership accountable for procurement&#x27;s performance.

Spend under management also contributes to an additional measure of procurement performance or procurement efficiency: procurement operating expense as a percentage of managed spend.

==Personnel and roles==

Personnel who undertake procurement on behalf of an organization may be referred to as procurement officers, professionals or specialists, buyers or supply managers. The US Federal Acquisition Regulation refers to Contracting Officers. Staff in managerial positions may be referred to as Purchasing Managers or Procurement Managers. The ISM refers to &quot;the supply profession&quot;.

A Purchasing or Procurement Manager&#x27;s responsibilities may include:
*approving orders
*seeking reliable vendors or suppliers to provide quality goods at reasonable prices
*negotiating prices and contracts
*reviewing technical specifications for raw materials, components, equipment or buildings
*determining and monitoring quantity and timing of deliveries (more commonly in small companies)
*forecasting upcoming demand
*supervision of other procurement staff and agents.

Category management represents a system of organising the roles of staff within a procurement team &quot;in such a way as to focus ... on the [external] supply markets of an organisation&quot;, rather than being organised according to the organisation&#x27;s internal departmental structure.

Specialist procurement roles include construction buyers and travel buyers. Part of the work of a corporate travel buyer is the formulation and implementation of a corporate travel policy.

In many larger organizations the procurement and supply function is led by a board-level or other senior position such as a Director of Supply Chain or a chief procurement officer (CPO). In other cases, procurement is overseen by the chief financial officer (CFO) or Director of Finance, or the growing need for liaison between the CFO and the procurement function has been recognised. A 2006 report by the National Audit Office in the UK commented that in the further education sector, where procurement practice was not well developed and college organisations were relatively small, oversight of procurement by the Director of Finance was a typical arrangement.

Independent or third party personnel who undertake procurement or negotiate purchases on behalf of an organization may be called purchasing agents or buying agents, although the term &quot;purchasing agent&quot; has a longer and broader history: the Institute for Supply Management in the United States was originally called the National Association of Purchasing Agents from its formation in 1915. A commercial agent may both purchase and sell on behalf of a third party.

US Bureau of Labor Statistics research found that there were 526,200 purchasing manager, buyer and purchasing agent positions in the United States in 2019. Various writers have noted that businesses may reduce the numbers of purchasing staff during a recession along with staff in other business areas, despite a tendency to become more dependent on bought-in goods and services as operations contract. For example, US business executive Steve Collins observed that in one major company the purchasing staffbase &quot;was downsized some 30% during the [2010] recession, &#x27;but the expectations for the remaining employees remained unchanged ... The additional workload placed on the remaining employees following the downsizing created a much more challenging environment. In 2021 the Australasian Procurement and Construction Council (APCC) put forward an appeal asking everyone working in the procurement profession in Australia to include the term in their occupational title when completing their August 2021 census return.

The European Commission issued a recommendation in October 2017 directed towards the &quot;professionalisation of public procurement&quot; so that Member States could &quot;attract, develop and retain&quot; staff in public purchasing roles, focus on performance and &quot;make the most out of the available tools and techniques&quot;. Research undertaken in 2020 highlighted the importance of social or &quot;soft&quot; skills within the skill sets of professional procurement staff.

===Participation of women===
Some writers have observed that there is limited opportunity for women to enter procurement because of stereotypes viewing some roles as not appropriate for women.

Management consultant Oliver Wyman reported in 2019 that, based on a survey of over 300 CPOs in Europe, US, and Asia working across 14 industries, 38% of the staff in the procurement organizations surveyed were women: 60% of CPOs stated that there were more women in their organization than three years previously, while 6% said that the number of women had decreased. The effect of this growing involvement of women in procurement was recognised in the form of &quot;more creativity and innovation&quot;, acknowledged by 76% of the CPO&#x27;s surveyed.

==Legal aspects ==
A contractual obligation to procure refers to an absolute obligation to ensure that the action is done or the condition is met. For example, when a party to a construction contract is obligated to apply for the permits required to commence work, that party is obligated to apply for them. Where such a contract is silent as to which party is responsible to seek permits, but only one party is capable of doing so, it is implicit within the contract that the capable party will obtain permits within a reasonable time frame so as to allow the work to proceed.

The use of the word &quot;procure&quot; in a joint venture agreement between Nearfield Ltd., Lincoln Nominees Ltd., and other partners, in relation to the utilisation of a bank loan, gave rise to a dispute between the parties regarding the meaning of the word &quot;procure&quot;, which was resolved in 2006 by the judge, Peter Smith, confirming that the &quot;normal meaning of the word&quot; is clear and well understood: &quot;I do not see that procure means anything other than as Nearfield [the claimant] puts it &#x27;see to it&#x27;&quot;. In this case, the obligation to &quot;procure the payment&quot; of the loan amounted to a guarantee of that loan.

==Future scenarios==
Various commentators have made projections regarding the future of procurement. Charlotte Payne, general manager of CIPS in Australia and New Zealand, suggests that &quot;procurement&#x27;s role in sustainability is going to be massive&quot;, while a CIPS general overview anticipates that &quot;there is little chance that procurement and supply will enter a period of calm any time soon&quot;.

<doc id="763367" wikidata="Q7440593" url="?curid=763367" title="Symbols of the United States Senate">
<text>The United States Senate is represented by many symbols. Mainly a seal, the eagle and seal and the senate gravel. 

==Seal==
The Seal of the United States Senate is the seal officially adopted by the United States Senate to authenticate certain official documents. Its design also sometimes serves as a sign and symbol of the Senate, appearing on its official flag among other places. The current version dates from 1886, and is the third seal design used by the Senate since its inception in 1789. The use of the seal is restricted by federal law and other regulations, and so is used sparingly, to the point that there are alternate, non-official seal designs more commonly seen in public.

The seal has a shield with 13 stars on top and 13 vertical stripes on the bottom, with a scroll inscribed with &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; floating across the top. An olive branch, symbolizing peace, graces the left side of the shield, while an oak branch, symbolizing strength, is on the right. A red liberty cap above the shield and crossed fasces below the shield represent freedom and authority, respectively. Blue beams of light emanate from the shield. Surrounding the seal is the legend &quot;United States Senate&quot;. Several of the elements are derived from the Great Seal of the United States.

=== Usage ===
The seal is affixed to impeachment documents and resolutions of consent to international treaties. It also appears on presentation copies of Senate resolutions recognizing appointments, commendations, and notable achievements. Other uses include authentication of senator credentials, and also electoral votes for President and Vice President. The seal is kept in the custody of the Secretary of the Senate, who also can authorize other specific uses. In the twentieth century, the Secretary has authorized its official use by the majority and minority leaders.

It is illegal to use the Senate seal in any manner reasonably calculated to convey a false impression of sponsorship or approval by the Government of the United States.

=== Depictions ===

The seal is depicted in a stained glass window in the United States Capitol. There are four grand staircases in the building, and all four stairwells contain a large stained glass window, each with a different design. One of these windows, on the Senate side of the Capitol, originally depicted an eagle with a shield and flags of the United States but it was accidentally destroyed in the 1960s. The window was initially filled in with frosted glass, but was later replaced with a colorful design depicting the senate seal. The window is also visible from the office on the other side (room S-210, currently the majority whip&#x27;s office). An image of this window served as the theme of the Senate&#x27;s web page from about 2002 to 2006.

The Senate never had an official flag until the 1980s, even though by then most other government agencies, departments, and offices had one. In April 1984, Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii proposed that the Senate commission an official flag using the design of the Senate seal. After turning down several submitted designs, the committee turned to the Army Institute of Heraldry, which proposed a navy blue flag with the seal in the center. This was approved in 1987, and the flags were made available in March 1988. Each senator and committee were limited to two flags apiece, and in keeping with the usual limits on the seal, use of the flags is restricted to Senate offices only, and commercial use is prohibited. A Senate flag is also hung above the dais of the Hart Building’s central hearing room.

The Senate seal, along with the seal of the Department of Justice, was used on the reverse of the 1998 commemorative dollar coin honoring Robert F. Kennedy. The seals symbolized Kennedy&#x27;s career in the U.S. government, first as United States Attorney General and later as a senator from New York.

At least during the 1960s, a painted version of the seal was also on the ceiling of the office of the Secretary of the Senate.

=== History ===

==== 1790s seal ====

When first meeting in Philadelphia in the 1790s, members of the early Senate admired the visually appealing Great Seal enough that they had it reproduced on a carpet woven for their chamber. They also selected a similar design for the first official Senate seal.
This first design had an eagle with a shield on its breast, olive branches in its left talon, and arrows in its right. Above the eagle were rays of light emanating from clouds, representing the emergence of the new nation. Encircling the design was the legend . While the design was clearly based on the Great Seal of the United States, the engraving was distinctly different. It had a spade shield instead of the more familiar shape on the Great Seal, and the eagle had no scroll in its beak. The design of the clouds and light rays was also different, and the inscription showed it was a seal made specifically for the Senate (the Great Seal has no inscription at all). The design is actually closer to a rendition made by James Trenchard for the September 1786 &quot;Columbian Magazine&quot;, which was also later used on the reverse side of a few Indian Peace Medals given by President Washington in about the same time frame as the Senate seal was made.

Exactly when this first seal was made, or by whom, is not known.

The first known use of this seal was on the March 1798 impeachment summons of Tennessee Senator William Blount. Six years later, the seal appeared on another impeachment summons, this time for Federal Judge John Pickering, and other documents during his trial.

==== 1831 seal ====

By 1830, the first Senate seal was either unserviceable due to wear or simply lost after a period of not being used. A new seal was commissioned from Robert G. Lanphier Jr., a French artist, engraver and jeweler living in Washington D.C. at the time. The press and counterseal were made by Edward Stabler, the postmaster at Sandy Spring, Maryland from 1830 until his death in 1883. Stabler had engraved the seal for the House of Representatives in 1830, and also would later make the seals for most federal government departments of the time, some states, and several municipalities.

This second design was inspired by the then-popular Greek and Roman models, depicting three female figures which symbolized liberty, justice, and power. An eagle is above the figures, and twenty-four links of a chain bordering the seal represent the number of states then in the Union. The central Liberty figure is standing on a platform inscribed with , and is holding a pole with a Phrygian cap, a palm branch of victory and rejoicing, and a scroll inscribed with . She is depicted in the process of walking, with one toe leaving the ground and her weight on her left foot. The Justice figure is holding the scales of justice, and leaning on fasces, a symbol of authority. The Power figure holds a sword in her right hand, and a caduceus in her left, a symbol of commerce and peace.

The design has some similarities to &quot;Genius of America&quot;, the sculpture over the central east pediment of the Capitol building which had recently been completed. Made by Luigi Persico from 1825 to 1828, it also features three female figures, representing America, Justice, and Hope. Elements shared between the two designs include a July 4 pedestal, a scroll with a Constitution inscription, the scales of justice, and an eagle.

During the 1868 impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, the seal was affixed to both the articles of impeachment and copies of documents submitted in evidence. The second seal was used until 1880, when it was discovered &quot;tucked away among some rubbish in one of the subterranean rooms of the Capitol&quot; (apparently left there following heavy use during an 1876 impeachment trial). By this time, the seal was well worn. An engraving of the seal made for the March 26, 1885 edition of the &quot;Daily Graphic&quot; did not show either the 1776 or 1789 inscriptions, the scales of justice, nor a recognizable scroll, all presumably because these were no longer discernible on impressions made by the seal.

==== 1886 seal ====

The 1876 United States Centennial renewed interest in national symbols, which eventually prompted a redesign of the Great Seal in 1885. On March 31, 1885, the Senate ordered an updating of its own seal. During the discussions, many senators did not even know a Senate seal existed.

After considering several submitted designs, the Senate chose one by Louis Dreka, an engraver and stationer from Philadelphia. He was given $35 to make the press and seal, which measured one-and-a-half inches in diameter. This design is the one still in use today. The physical seal itself is stored in a mahogany cabinet.

There had never been any official declaration about who should use the seal, and under what circumstances. This was also remedied at the time, with the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;, vol. 17, p. 769 stating:
Resolved, That the Secretary shall have the custody of the seal, and shall use the same for the authentication of process transcripts, copies, and certificates whenever directed by the Senate; and may use the same to authenticate copies of such papers and documents in his offices as he may lawfully give copies of.

In the twentieth century, the Secretary of the Senate has authorized official use of the seal by the majority and minority leaders.

=== Unofficial seals ===
Because the official Senate seal is used only to authenticate official Senate documents, and not normally as a general visual symbol, the Secretary of the Senate has also authorized an alternative, non-official Senate seal. This alternative seal, which features an eagle clutching arrows and an olive branch in its talons, surrounded by the words &quot;United States Senate,&quot; is commonly used by Senate offices and is often displayed on items sold in the Senate gift shop. Even more commonly seen perhaps is a version of the Great Seal of the United States (which also depicts an eagle clutching arrows and an olive branch in its claws) surrounded by a similar inscription. These often appear on Senate web pages, on podiums when senators speak, and other situations. The House of Representatives also uses similar designs for their unofficial seals, and since the United States Congress as a whole does not have an official seal, similar designs are often used with a Congress inscription.
Both the Senate Seal and the Great Seal are protected by 18 U.S.C. § 713, a criminal statute which restricts the knowing display of the Senate Seal or the Great Seal or any facsimile thereof in any manner reasonably calculated to convey a false impression of sponsorship or approval by the Government of the United States. The Senate ethics manual states that in most cases use of the Senate Seal or the Great Seal for normal official Senate business would be appropriate; however, commercial use, personal use or campaign use by senators would be improper. Additionally, campaign use of any of the unofficial, alternate seals would also be improper. The manual suggests that senators who want to show a symbol of government on campaign material use a depiction of the United States Capitol dome. In 2005, Representative Duke Cunningham was found to be selling items on a personal web site which included the unofficial Congress seal, which were shortly thereafter discontinued. Similarly, Senator Richard Durbin was dinged by a few bloggers after his campaign site showed a video message where an unofficial Senate seal (the Great Seal variant) appeared in one corner; the video was quickly taken down.

=== &quot;Eagle and Shield&quot; ===

The &quot;Eagle and Shield&quot; is a gilded wood sculpture which is currently on the dais of the Old Senate Chamber, as it was when the Senate used that room in the 1800s. It dates from at least 1838, when it was referenced in a newspaper article and Daniel Webster speech, and may be from about 1834. The 1838 newspaper article includes a first-hand eyewitness account of its original installation in the Old Senate Chamber and attributes carving of the eagle and shield directly to Mr. Thomas C. Millard (1803–1870). Millard was a New York City woodcarver who was active from the 1830s to 1860s and well known for his life-sized animals and human figures. The eagle is life-sized at 53.5 inches (135.9 cm) high, 72 inches (182.9 cm) wide, and 23 inches (58.4 cm) deep, and the design is derived from the Great Seal of the United States. When the Senate moved to its new quarters in 1859 and the Supreme Court took over use of the room, the shield was placed over one of the outside doors, while the eagle was placed elsewhere in the room. In 1976, long after the Supreme Court moved to their own building, the two pieces were reunited and placed back on the dais when the chamber was restored. It has become an enduring symbol of the Senate.
A stylized version has been used as a logo for the Senate on its website since 2006, and also from 1999 to 2002. In the intervening period, the website used an image of the stained glass window of the official Senate seal. The logo is also used on several online Senate publications.

The Senate gavel is wielded by the presiding officer of the Senate, usually either the Vice President or President &quot;pro tempore&quot;, and is used to signify the commencement or adjournment of a Senate session. It is made of ivory, has no handle, and is 2 inches high by 1 inches in diameter. The original gavel was in use at least as far back as 1831, and according to one account was used by John Adams during the first Senate meetings on March 4, 1789.

The gavel deteriorated during the 1940s, and in 1952 silver pieces were attached to try to limit further damage. However, in 1954, Then-Vice President Richard Nixon pounded it during a heated debate over atomic energy, and it completely came apart. Officials wanted to recreate the gavel exactly, but not enough ivory was available commercially; Senate officials therefore contacted the government of India for help in sourcing the correct amount of ivory. On November 17, 1954, the Vice-President of India, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, presented the assembled Senate with a replacement gavel, which is still in use today. It was a duplicate of the original, with the addition of a decorative floral band around the center. Both the original and new gavels are stored in a mahogany box; each day a Senate page places the box on the presiding officer&#x27;s desk.

It has become customary to have new senators preside over the senate (and thus wield the gavel) in one-hour shifts so they can learn Senate procedures. Usually this is limited to members of the majority party, but in periods where the Senate is evenly divided, senators from each party will often alternate.

The seal of the President pro tempore of the United States Senate includes a representation of the original gavel, with several depictions even showing its cracks, along with two quill pens and elements from the official Senate seal.

<doc id="763372" wikidata="Q2668214" url="?curid=763372" title="Siddha">
<text>Siddha (Sanskrit: &quot;&quot;; &quot;perfected one&quot;) is a term that is used widely in Indian religions and culture. It means &quot;one who is accomplished.&quot; It refers to perfected masters who have achieved a high degree of perfection of the intellect as well as liberation or enlightenment. In Jainism, the term is used to refer to the liberated souls. &quot;Siddha&quot; may also refer to one who has attained a siddhi, paranormal capabilities.

Siddhas may broadly refer to siddhars, naths, ascetics, sadhus, or yogis because they all practice sādhanā.

==Jainism==

In Jainism, the term &quot;siddha&quot; is used to refer the liberated souls who have destroyed all karmas and have obtained moksha.They are free from the transmigratory cycle of birth and death (&quot;saṃsāra&quot;) and are above &quot;Arihantas&quot; (omniscient beings). Siddhas do not have a body; they are soul in its purest form. They reside in the &quot;Siddhashila&quot;, which is situated at the top of the Universe. They are formless and have no passions and therefore are free from all temptations. They do not have any karmas and they do not collect any new karmas.

The Śvetāmbara Ācārāṅga Sūtra 1.197 describes &quot;siddhas&quot; in this way:
According to Jains, siddhas have &quot;eight&quot; specific characteristics or qualities. The ancient Tamil Jain Classic &#x27;Choodamani Nigandu&#x27; describes the eight characteristics in a poem, which is given below.

The following table summarizes the eight supreme qualities of a liberated soul.

Because of the quality of &quot;Sūksmatva&quot;, the liberated soul is beyond sense-perception and its knowledge of the substances is direct, without the use of the senses and the mind. The quality of &quot;avagāhan&quot; means that the liberated soul does not hinder the existence of other such souls in the same space.

A soul after attaining siddhahood goes to the top of the loka (as per Jain cosmology) and stays there till infinity. Siddhas are formless and dwell in &quot;Siddhashila&quot; with the above-mentioned eight qualities.

==Hinduism==
In Hinduism, the first usage of the term siddha occurs in the &quot;Maitreya Upanishad&quot; in chapter Adhya III where the writer of the section declares &quot;I am Siddha.&quot;

===Siddhashrama===

In Hindu theology, Siddhashrama is a secret land deep in the Himalayas, where great yogis, sadhus and sages who are siddhas live. The concept is similar to Tibetan mystical land of Shambhala.

Siddhashrama is referred in many Indian epics and Puranas including Ramayana and Mahabharata. In Valmiki&#x27;s Ramayana it is said that Viswamitra had his hermitage in Siddhashrama, the erstwhile hermitage of Vishnu, when he appeared as the Vamana avatar. He takes Rama and Lakshmana to Siddhashrama to exterminate the rakshasas who are disturbing his religious sacrifices (i.28.1-20).

===Nath sampradaya===

Whenever siddha is mentioned, the 84 siddhas and 9 nathas are remembered, and it is this tradition of siddha which is known as the Nath tradition. Siddha is a term used for both mahasiddhas and Naths So a siddha may mean a siddha, a mahasiddha or a nath. The three words are used interchangeably.

====In the Varna(na)ratnakara====
A list of eighty-four siddhas is found in a manuscript (manuscript no 48/34 of the Asiatic Society of Bengal) dated Lakshmana Samvat 388 (1506) of a medieval Maithili work, the Varna Ratnakara (devnagari: वर्ण-रत्नाकर) written by Jyotirishwar Thakur, the court poet of King Harisimhadeva of Mithila (reigned 1300–1321). An interesting feature of this list is that the names of the most revered naths are incorporated in this list along with Buddhist siddhācāryas. The names of the siddhas found in this list are:

====In the &quot;Hatha Yoga Pradipika&quot;====
In the first &quot;upadeśa&quot; (chapter) of the &quot;Hatha Yoga Pradipika&quot;, a 15th-century text, a list of yogis is found, who are described as the Mahasiddhas. This list has a number of names common with those found in the list of the &quot;Varna(na)ratnākara&quot;:

===Tamil tradition===
In Tamil Nadu, South India, a siddha (see &quot;siddhar&quot;) refers to a being who has achieved a high degree of physical as well as spiritual perfection or enlightenment. The ultimate demonstration of this is that siddhas allegedly attained physical immortality. Thus siddha, like siddhar, refers to a person who has realised the goal of a type of sadhana and become a perfected being. In Tamil Nadu, South India, where the siddha tradition is still practiced, special individuals are recognized as and called siddhas (or siddhars or cittars) who are on the path to that assumed perfection after they have taken special secret rasayanas to perfect their bodies, in order to be able to sustain prolonged meditation along with a form of pranayama which considerably reduces the number of breaths they take. Siddha were said to have special powers including flight. These eight powers are collectively known as attamasiddhigal (ashtasiddhi). In Hindu cosmology, &quot;Siddhaloka&quot; is a subtle world (&quot;loka&quot;) where perfected beings (siddhas) take birth. They are endowed with the eight primary siddhis at birth.

==Buddhism==
The Svetasvatara (II.12) presupposes a siddha body.

<doc id="763376" wikidata="Q589750" url="?curid=763376" title="Chestnut teal">
<text>The chestnut teal (Anas castanea) is a dabbling duck found in Australia. It is protected under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974.

==Taxonomy==
The chestnut teal was described by the English naturalist Thomas Campbell Eyton in 1838 under the binomial name &quot;Mareca castanea&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;castanea&quot; is from the Latin &quot;castaneus&quot; for &quot;chestnut-coloured&quot; or &quot;chestnut-brown&quot;.

A large molecular phylogentic study that compared mitochondrial DNA sequences from ducks, geese and swans in the family Anatidae found that the chestnut teal is a sister species to the Sunda teal (&quot;Anas gibberifrons&quot;) that is endemic to Indonesia.

==Description==
The chestnut teal is darker and a slightly bigger bird than the grey teal.

The male has a distinctive green coloured head and mottled brown body. The female has a brown head and mottled brown body. The female is almost identical in appearance to the grey teal.

The female chestnut teal has a loud penetrating &quot;laughing&quot; quack repeated rapidly nine times or more.

==Distribution and habitat==
The chestnut teal is commonly distributed in south-eastern and south-western Australia, while vagrants may occur elsewhere. Tasmania and southern Victoria are the species&#x27; stronghold, while vagrants have been found as far north as New Guinea and Lord Howe Island, and as far south as New Zealand.

The chestnut teal prefers coastal estuaries and wetlands, and is indifferent to salinity. This bird is an omnivore.

==Breeding==
Chestnut teals form monogamous pairs that stay together outside the breeding season, defend the nest site and look after the young when hatched. Nests are usually located over water, in a down-lined tree hollow about 6–10 m high. Sometimes nests are placed on the ground, among clumps of grass near water. The young hatch and are ready to swim and walk within a day.

<doc id="763389" wikidata="Q5482392" url="?curid=763389" title="Francis Salvador">
<text>Francis Salvador (1747 – 1 August 1776) was an English-born American plantation owner in the colony of South Carolina from the Sephardic Jewish community of London; in 1774, he was the first professing Jew to be elected to public office in the colonies when chosen for the Provincial Congress. He had joined the independence cause and in 1776 was the first Jew killed in the American Revolutionary War, fighting with the militia on the South Carolina frontier against Loyalists and their Cherokee allies.

==Early life==

Francis Salvador was born to Jacob Salvador and his wife in London, where a Spanish and Portuguese Jewish (Sephardic) community had developed since the 17th century. His uncle, Joseph Salvador, was a prominent businessman, investing in the British East India Company. His grandfather Francis Salvador was the boy&#x27;s namesake. Francis&#x27; father died when he was two, and his younger brother Moses was born soon after.

The boys were tutored privately and raised in wealth. When the sons came of age, they each inherited £60,000. Salvador became active with his uncle Joseph and the wealthy DaCosta family of London in plans to settle poor Jews and their family members in the New World.

Francis Salvador married Sarah Salvador, his first cousin and Joseph&#x27;s second daughter. Her father gave her a £13,000 dowry. They had a son, John Lovel Salvador, and three daughters before the senior Salvador emigrated in late 1773 to South Carolina.

==Emigration to North America==
In 1733, the London Sephardic community sent 42 Jews to Savannah with the first English settlers in present-day Georgia. In the 1730s, Sephardic Jews from London began emigrating to Charleston as a preferred destination. They were later joined by Jews from Germany, the Netherlands and the West Indies. When Spain attacked Georgia in 1740, most of the Jewish families fled north to Charleston, fearing the Spanish Inquisition might be imposed in Georgia. 

The Salvador and DaCosta families in London bought in the new district of Ninety-Six (known as &quot;Jews Land&quot;) in the western frontier of the Carolina colony. They began to settle it. The Salvador family was financially ruined by the Lisbon earthquake of 1755, as they still held properties there, and subsequent failure of the East India Company, in which they had interests. They retained their land in South Carolina and little other wealth.

== Representative to the Provincial Congress ==
Francis Salvador acquired in Ninety Six District, Carolina Colony, and emigrated intending to send for his wife, Sarah, and their four children as soon as he was able. Arriving in Charleston in December 1773, Salvador quickly joined the American cause. He became close friends with the rising leaders of the Revolution in the South, including Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, John Rutledge, William Henry Drayton, Henry Laurens, and Samuel Hammond.

Buying African slaves to work his land, Salvador settled at Coroneka (commonly called Cornacre) in 1774, joined for a while by his friend Richard A. Rapley, as neither wanted to live alone. They were both elected as delegates to South Carolina&#x27;s Provincial Congress; Salvador was the first Jew elected to public office in the Thirteen Colonies in North America. He was re-elected to the second Provincial Congress in 1775, holding the post until his death. At the time, Jews legally could neither hold office nor vote, but no colonists objected when Salvador and his friend Richard A. Rapley were elected as two among the several frontier representatives from Ninety-Six District to the Provincial Congress. They were joined by Andrew Williamson, then a major in the militia.

When the Provincial Congress first met in Charleston in January 1775, Salvador was chosen for important committee assignments: drawing up the declaration of the purpose of the congress to the people; obtaining ammunition; assessing the safety of the frontier, and working on the new state constitution. The group also framed a bill of rights and composed an address to South Carolina&#x27;s royal governor, setting forth the colonists&#x27; complaints against the Crown. Salvador was appointed to a commission that tried to convince the Tories in the northern and western parts of the colony to join the American cause.

The second Provincial Congress assembled in November 1775. Salvador was one of the champions for independence; he urged his fellow delegates to instruct the colony&#x27;s delegation to the Continental Congress to cast their vote for independence. Salvador chaired the Ways and Means Committee of this second Provincial Congress, at the same time serving on a select committee authorised to issue bills of credit as payment to members of the militia. He was also selected for a commission to preserve the peace in the interior parts of South Carolina.

== Fighting in the American Revolution ==
Early in 1776, the British had induced native allies to attack the South Carolina frontier to create a diversion in favour of British operations on the sea-coast. On 1 July 1776, the natives began attacking frontier families in Ninety Six District. Salvador rode from his lands to the White Hall plantation of Major Andrew Williamson, away, to raise the alarm. Salvador took part in the engagements that followed. On 31 July, Major Williamson captured two white Loyalists. They led his 330-men militia into an ambush by their fellow Tories and Cherokee allies at the Keowee River. Alexander Cameron, deputy to Captain John Stuart, led the Tory forces. Salvador was shot and fell into the bushes, but was discovered and scalped by the Cherokee that night. He died from his wounds at age 29.

Concerning his death, Colonel William Thomson wrote to William Henry Drayton, in a letter dated &quot;Camp, two miles below Keowee[a Cherokee town], 4 August 1776, as follows:

Here, Mr. Salvador received three wounds; and, fell by my side. . . . I desired [Lieutenant Farar], to take care of Mr. Salvador; but, before he could find him in the dark, the enemy unfortunately got his scalp: which, was the only one taken. . . . He died, about half after two o&#x27;clock in the morning: forty-five minutes after he received the wounds, sensible to the last. When I came up to him, after dislodging the enemy, and speaking to him, he asked, whether I had beat the enemy? I told him yes. He said he was glad of it, and shook me by the hand – and bade me farewell – and said, he would die in a few minutes.

A patriot journal, &quot;The Rememerance&quot;, wrote of Salvador: &quot;he was universally loved and esteemed.&quot;

Salvador became caught up in the Revolution before he could bring his family to the colony. His wife and children stayed in London, aided by his estate and their families.

==Legacy and honours==
*His son John Lovel Salvador converted to the Anglican Church and became a minister.
*In 1950, to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Charleston&#x27;s Jewish congregation, the City of Charleston erected a memorial to Francis Salvador, the first Jew to die for the American Revolution.

Born an aristocrat, he became a democrat;

An Englishman, he cast his lot with the Americans;

True to his ancient faith, he gave his life;

For new hopes of human liberty and understanding.

*Ninety Six National Historic Site has been designated a National Historic Landmark to commemorate actions there and the history of the settlement; in addition to earlier Patriot engagements, Loyalists resisted an American siege in 1781.

<doc id="763392" wikidata="Q830059" url="?curid=763392" title="Battle of Red Cliffs">
<text>The Battle of Red Cliffs, also known as the Battle of Chibi, was a decisive naval battle in China that took place during the winter of AD 208–209. It was fought on the Yangtze River between the forces of warlords controlling different parts of the country during the end of the Han dynasty. The allied forces of Sun Quan, Liu Bei, and Liu Qi based south of the Yangtze defeated the numerically superior forces of the northern warlord Cao Cao. By doing so, Liu Bei and Sun Quan prevented Cao Cao from conquering any lands south of the Yangtze, frustrating Cao Cao&#x27;s efforts to reunify the territories formerly held by the Eastern Han dynasty.

The allied victory at Red Cliffs ensured the survival of Liu Bei and Sun Quan and left them in control of the Yangtze, establishing defensible frontiers that would later serve as the basis for the states of Shu Han and Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period (220–280). Historians have arrived at different conclusions in their attempts to reconstruct the timeline of events at Red Cliffs. The location of the battlefield itself remains a subject of debate: most scholars consider either a location southwest of present-day Wuhan, or a location northeast of Baqiu in present-day Yueyang, Hunan as plausible candidate sites for the battle. The battle has been the subject of or influenced numerous poems, dramas, movies and games.

== Background ==

By the early 3rd century AD, the Han dynasty, now nearly four centuries old, was crumbling. Emperor Xian, who acceded to the throne in 189 at age eight, was a political figurehead with no control over the regional warlords. Cao Cao was one of the most powerful warlords. He hosted the emperor in his capital at Ye, which gave him a measure of control over the emperor in addition to an air of legitimacy. In 200 he had defeated his main rival Yuan Shao at Guandu, reunifying northern China and giving him control of the North China Plain. In the winter of 207 he secured his northern flank by defeating the Wuhuan people at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain. Upon returning to Ye in 208, Cao Cao was appointed Chancellor upon his own recommendation, which effectively gave him control of the imperial government.
Cao Cao&#x27;s southern campaign started shortly after in the autumn of 208. The section of the Yangtze flowing through Jing Province was the first target; capturing the naval base at Jiangling and securing naval control of the province&#x27;s stretch of the Yangtze were necessary to secure access to the south. He was opposed by the warlords Liu Biao and Sun Quan. Liu Biao, the governor of Jing, controlled the Yangtze west of the Han River&#x27;s mouth, which roughly encompassed the territory around the city of Xiakou and to the south. Sun Quan controlled the Yangtze east of the Han and the southeastern territories abutting it. Liu Bei, another warlord, was in Fancheng, having fled to Liu Biao from the northeast after a failed plot to assassinate Cao Cao and restore imperial power.

Initially, Cao Cao achieved rapid success. Jing was in a poor state. Its armies were exhausted by conflict with Sun Quan to the south. Furthermore, there was political division as Liu Biao&#x27;s sons, the elder Liu Qi and the younger Liu Cong, sought to succeed their father. Liu Cong prevailed, and Liu Qi was relegated to the commandery of Jiangxia. Liu Biao died of illness only a few weeks later. Liu Cong surrendered to an advancing Cao Cao, giving him a sizeable fleet and Jiangling as a forward operating base.

Cao Cao&#x27;s advance forced Liu Bei into a disorganised southward retreat accompanied by refugees and pursued by Cao Cao&#x27;s elite cavalry. Liu Bei was surrounded and decisively defeated at the Battle of Changban but escaped eastward to Xiakou, where he liaised with Sun Quan&#x27;s emissary Lu Su. Historical accounts are inconsistent: Lu Su may have successfully encouraged Liu Bei to move further east to Fankou (, near present-day Ezhou, Hubei). In any case, Liu Bei was later joined by Liu Qi and levies from Jiangxia.

Liu Bei&#x27;s main advisor, Zhuge Liang, was sent to Chaisang , present-day Jiujiang, Jiangxi, to negotiate an alliance with Sun Quan against Cao Cao. Zhuge Liang told Sun Quan that Liu Bei and Liu Qi each had 10,000 men; these numbers may have been exaggerated, but however large a force the pair fielded was no match against Cao Cao&#x27;s in an open battle. Sun Quan received a letter from Cao Cao prior to Zhuge Liang&#x27;s arrival; in it, Cao Cao claimed to have an army of 800,000 and hinted that he wanted Sun Quan to surrender. Zhang Zhao, Sun Quan&#x27;s chief clerk, supported surrendering based on the disparity in forces. Zhuge Liang was supported by Lu Su and Zhou Yu, Sun Quan&#x27;s chief commander. Sun Quan agreed to the alliance; he chopped off a corner of his desk during an assembly and stated, &quot;Anyone who still dares argue for surrender will be [treated] the same as this desk.&quot; Zhou Yu, Cheng Pu, and Lu Su were assigned 30,000 men and sent to aid Liu Bei. With Liu Bei&#x27;s 20,000 soldiers, the alliance had approximately 50,000 marines who were trained and prepared for battle.

Zhou Yu estimated Cao Cao&#x27;s strength to be closer to 230,000. This included between 70 and 80 thousand men impressed from Ying, and whose morale and loyalty to Cao Cao were uncertain. Cao Cao&#x27;s invasion force also included non-combatants: not only those who worked in supplies and communication, but also the wives and children of some of the soldiers.

== Battle ==

The Battle of Red Cliffs opened with an attempt by Cao Cao&#x27;s forces to establish a bridgehead across the Yangtze, which failed. Both sides then retreated to their established positions on either bank of the Yangtze. Following this, a naval engagement began on the river itself, accompanied by an allied land offensive. This sequence proved to be decisive, and Cao Cao&#x27;s forces were routed. During the subsequent retreat, Cao Cao&#x27;s men were bogged down in mud and suffered greatly from disease. Cao Cao ultimately managed to escape after reaching Huarong Pass.

The combined Sun–Liu force sailed upstream from either Xiakou or Fankou to Red Cliffs, where they encountered Cao Cao&#x27;s vanguard force. Plagued by disease and low morale because of the series of forced marches that they had undertaken on the prolonged southern campaign, Cao Cao&#x27;s men could not gain an advantage in the small skirmish which ensued and so he retreated to Wulin, north of the river, and the allies pulled back to the south.

Cao Cao had chained his ships from stem to stern, possibly with the aim of reducing seasickness in his navy, which was composed mostly of northerners who were not used to living on ships. Observing that, the divisional commander Huang Gai sent Cao Cao a letter feigning surrender and prepared a squadron of capital ships described as &quot;mengchong doujian&quot; (). The ships had been converted into fire ships by filling them with bundles of kindling, dry reeds, and fatty oil. As Huang Gai&#x27;s &quot;defecting&quot; squadron approached the mid-point of the river, the sailors applied fire to the ships before they took to small boats. The unmanned fire ships, carried by the southeastern wind, sped towards Cao Cao&#x27;s fleet and set it ablaze. Many men and horses either burned to death or drowned.

Following the initial shock, Zhou Yu and the allies led a lightly armed force to capitalise on the assault. The northern army was thrown into confusion and utterly defeated. Seeing that the situation was hopeless, Cao Cao then issued a general order of retreat and destroyed a number of his remaining ships before he withdrew.

Cao Cao&#x27;s army attempted a retreat along Huarong Road, including a long stretch passing through marshlands north of Dongting Lake. Heavy rains had made the road so treacherous that many of the sick soldiers had to carry bundles of grass on their backs and use them to fill the road to allow the horsemen to cross. Many of these soldiers drowned in the mud or were trampled to death in the effort. The allies, led by Zhou Yu and Liu Bei, gave chase over land and water until they reached Nan Commandery; the chase combined with famine and disease ravaged Cao Cao&#x27;s remaining forces. Cao Cao then retreated north to his home base of Yecheng, leaving Cao Ren and Xu Huang to guard Jiangling, Yue Jin stationed in Xiangyang, and Man Chong in Dangyang.

The allied counterattack might have vanquished Cao Cao and his forces entirely. However, the crossing of the Yangtze River had dissolved into chaos as the allied armies converged on the riverbank and fought over the limited number of ferries. To restore order, a detachment led by Sun Quan&#x27;s general Gan Ning established a bridgehead in Yiling to the north, and only a staunch rearguard action by Cao Ren prevented a further catastrophe.

== Analysis ==
A combination of Cao Cao&#x27;s strategic errors and the effectiveness of Huang Gai&#x27;s ruse had resulted in the allied victory at the Battle of Red Cliffs. Zhou Yu had observed that Cao Cao&#x27;s generals and soldiers were mostly from the cavalry and infantry, and just a few had any experience in naval warfare. Cao Cao also had little support among the people of Jing Province and so lacked a secure forward base of operations. Despite the strategic acumen that Cao Cao had displayed in earlier campaigns and battles, he had simply assumed in this case that numerical superiority would eventually defeat the Sun and Liu navy. Cao&#x27;s first tactical mistake was converting his massive army of infantry and cavalry into a marine corps and navy. With only a few days of drills before the battle, Cao Cao&#x27;s troops were debilitated by sea-sickness and lack of experience on water. Tropical diseases to which the southerners were largely immune were also rampant in Cao Cao&#x27;s camps. Although numerous, Cao Cao&#x27;s men were already exhausted by the unfamiliar environment and the extended southern campaign, as Zhuge Liang observed: &quot;Even a powerful arrow at the end of its flight cannot penetrate a silk cloth.&quot;

Jia Xu, a key advisor to Cao Cao had recommended after the surrender of Liu Cong for the overtaxed armies to be given time to rest and replenish before they engaged the armies of Sun Quan and Liu Bei, but Cao Cao disregarded that advice. Cao Cao&#x27;s own thoughts regarding his failure at Red Cliffs suggest that he held his own actions and misfortunes responsible for the defeat, rather than the strategies used by his enemy during the battle: &quot;it was only because of the sickness that I burnt my ships and retreated. It is out of all reason for Zhou Yu to take the credit for himself.&quot;

== Aftermath ==
By the end of 209, the post that Cao Cao had established at Jiangling fell to Zhou Yu. The borders of the land under Cao Cao&#x27;s control contracted about , to the area around Xiangyang. For the victors of the battle, however, the question arose on how to share the spoils. Initially, Liu Bei and Liu Qi both expected rewards, having participated in the success at Red Cliffs, and both had also become entrenched in Jing Province. Liu Qi was appointed Inspector of Jing Province, but his rule in the region, centred at Jiangxia Commandery, was short-lived. A few months after the Battle of Red Cliffs, he died of sickness. His lands were mostly absorbed by Sun Quan. However, with Liu Qi dead, Liu Bei laid claim to the title of Inspector of Jing Province and began to occupy much of it. He gained control of four commanderies south of the Yangtze in Wuling, Changsha, Lingling, and Guiyang. Sun Quan&#x27;s troops had suffered far greater casualties than Liu Bei&#x27;s in the extended conflict against Cao Ren following the Battle of Red Cliffs, and the death of Zhou Yu in 210 resulted in a drastic weakening of Sun Quan&#x27;s strength in Jing Province.

As Liu Bei occupied Jing Province, which Cao Cao had recently lost, he gained a strategic and naturally-fortified area on the Yangtze River that Sun Quan still wanted for himself. The control of Jing Province provided Liu Bei with virtually-unlimited access to the passage into Yi Province and important waterways into Wu (southeastern China) as well as dominion of the southern Yangtze River. Never again would Cao Cao command so large a fleet as he did at Jiangling, and he never had another similar opportunity to destroy his southern rivals. The Battle of Red Cliffs and the capture of Jing Province by Liu Bei confirmed the separation of southern China from the northern heartland of the Yellow River valley and foreshadowed a north–south axis of hostility that would continue for centuries.

== Location ==

The precise location of the Red Cliffs battlefield has never been conclusively established, and has long been the subject of both popular and academic debate. Scholars have contested the subject for at least 1350 years, with numerous sites having arguments put forward in their favour. There are clear grounds for rejecting some of these proposals; broadly speaking, four locations are still advocated for. According to Zhang, many of the current debates stem from the fact that the course and length of the Yangtze between Wuli and Wuhan has changed since the Sui and Tang dynasties. The modern debate is also complicated by the fact that the names of some of the key locations have changed over the following centuries. For example, modern Huarong County is located in Hunan, south of the Yangtze, but in the 3rd century, the city of that name was due east of Jiangling, considerably north of the Yangtze. Puqi (), one of the candidate sites, was renamed &quot;Chibi City&quot; in 1998, in an attempt to spur local tourism.

Historical records state that Cao Cao&#x27;s forces retreated north across the Yangtze after the initial engagement at Red Cliffs, which unequivocally places the battle site on the southern bank of the Yangtze. For this reason, a number of sites on the northern bank have been discounted by historians and geographers. Historical accounts also establish eastern and western boundaries for a stretch of the Yangtze that encompasses all of the possible sites for the battlefield. The allied forces travelled upstream from either Fankou or Xiakou. Since the Yangtze flows roughly eastward towards the ocean with northeast and southeast meanders, Red Cliffs must at least be west of Fankou, which is farther downstream. The westernmost boundary is also clear since Cao Cao&#x27;s eastern advance from Jiangling included passing Baqiu, near present-day Yueyang, Hunan, on the shore of Dongting Lake. The battle must also have been downstream (that is, northeast) of that place.
One popular candidate for the battle site is Chibi Hill in Huangzhou, sometimes referred to as &quot;Su Dongpo&#x27;s Red Cliffs&quot; or the &quot;Literary Red Cliffs&quot; (). This conjecture arises largely from the famous 11th-century poem &quot;First Ode on the Red Cliffs&quot;, which presents the Huangzhou hill as the location where the battle took place. The cliff&#x27;s name is &quot;Chibi&quot;, though written with different second character (). The contemporaneous pronunciation of the two names were also different, which is reflected by their distinct pronunciations in many non-Mandarin dialects. Consequently, virtually all scholars have dismissed the connection. The site is also on the north bank of the Yangtze and is directly across from Fankou, rather than upstream from it. If the allied Sun-Liu forces left from Xiakou rather than Fankou, as the oldest historical sources suggest, the hill in Huangzhou would have been downstream from the point of departure, a possibility that cannot be reconciled with historical sources.

Chibi City, formerly named Puqi, is possibly the most widely accepted candidate. To differentiate from Su&#x27;s site, the site is also referred to as the &quot;Military Red Cliffs&quot; (). It is directly across the Yangtze from Wulin. This argument was first proposed in the early Tang dynasty. There are also characters engraved in the cliffs which suggested that was the site of the battle. The origin of the engraving can be dated to between the Tang and Song dynasties, which makes it at least 1,000 years old.

Some sources mention the southern banks of the Yangtze in Jiayu County () in the prefecture-level city of Xianning in Hubei as a possible location. This would place the battlefield downstream from Chibi City, a view that is supported by scholars of Chinese history who follow the &quot;Shui Jing Zhu&quot;, such as Rafe de Crespigny and .

Another candidate is Wuhan, which straddles the Yangtze at its confluence with the Han River. It is east of both Wulin and Jiayu, as well as Chibi City on the opposite bank. The metropolis was incorporated by joining the three cities of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang. There is a local belief in Wuhan that the battle was fought at the junction of the rivers, southwest of the former Wuchang city, now part of Wuhan. Zhang asserts that the Chibi battlefield was amongst a set of hills in Wuchang levelled in the 1930s so that their stone could be used as raw material. The local topography narrows the width of the Yangtze by a substantial margin, and the Wuhan area was strategically important. Citing several historical-geographical studies, Zhang shows that earlier accounts place the battlefield in Wuchang. In particular, the 5th-century provincial history &quot;Jingzhou ji&quot; () by places the battlefield ( ) downstream from Wulin, but since the Paizhou and Lukou meanders grew at some point during the Sui and Tang dynasties, the length of the Yangtze between Wuli and Wuchang increased by ( ); later works do not regard Wuchang as a plausible site.

== Cultural impact ==
Some of the most well-known works by the Song-era poet Su Dongpo depict the battle and its surrounding environment. While exiled to Huangzhou (; now Huanggang, Hubei), he composed three widely anthologised pieces on the Red Cliff motif: two &quot;fu&quot; rhapsodies and one &quot;ci&quot; lyric. In 2010, a memorial museum dedicated to Su was established in Huanggan.

Many video games set in the Three Kingdoms period — including Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; series, &quot;Sangokushi Koumeiden&quot;, the &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; series, &quot;Destiny of an Emperor&quot;, &quot;Kessen II&quot;, and &quot;Total War: Three Kingdoms&quot; — have playable scenarios featuring the battle. The 2008 film &quot;Red Cliff&quot;, directed by Hong Kong filmmaker John Woo, is an adaption of the folk history surrounding the battle. Upon its release in China, &quot;Red Cliff&quot; set a new box office record for a domestically produced film.

<doc id="763394" wikidata="Q715181" url="?curid=763394" title="Michael Franti">
<text>Michael Franti (born April 21, 1966) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, poet, activist, documentarian, and rapper. Known for his participation in many musical projects, most with a political and social emphasis, including the Beatnigs and the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy. He is the creator and lead vocalist of Michael Franti &amp; Spearhead, a band which blends hip hop with a variety of other styles including funk, reggae, jazz, folk, and rock. He is also an outspoken supporter for a wide spectrum of peace and social justice issues; he is especially an advocate for peace in the Middle East.

==Early life==
Michael Franti was born in Oakland, California. His mother, Mary Lofy, had Irish, German, and Belgian ancestry; his father, Thomas Hopkins, was of African American and Native American descent. He was adopted by Carole Wisti and Charles Franti, a Finnish American couple in Oakland, who at the time had three biological children and one adopted African American son. Charles Franti was a professor in the department of epidemiology and preventive medicine of the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine and died in 2003. Franti&#x27;s four adoptive siblings are Rebecca, Sara, Dan, and Matthew. Michael also has four half-siblings, Thea, Thomas, Charles, and Arthur Hopkins.

Franti went to grade 9 at Highland Junior High School in Edmonton, Alberta. Then he attended Davis Senior High School and University of San Francisco on a full basketball scholarship, where during the 1985–1986 season, he averaged 2.4 pts per game. During his time at school there he met a priest who taught him how to write stories, and soon he was writing poetry. He purchased a bass guitar at a pawn shop and started creating music inspired by hip hop, punk, and reggae which was being played on the campus radio station, KUSF.

==Career==
===The Beatnigs (1986–1990)===
Franti began his music career in 1986 as part of the industrial punk/spoken word band the Beatnigs. While attending the University of San Francisco and living above KUSF he developed a fascination with music and decided to start a band. The Beatnigs included dancer and percussionist Rono Tse; the band released a self-titled LP and an EP &quot;Television&quot; on Alternative Tentacles records. The records received some critical acclaim but little fame beyond the San Francisco Bay Area.

The 1988 LP release &quot;The Beatnigs&quot; was recorded at Dancin&#x27; Dog Studio in Emeryville and distributed by Alternative Tentacles. In addition to Michael Franti and Ron Tse, the band included Henry Flood on percussion, Andre Flores on keyboards, and Kevin Carnes on vocals. All of the band members made multiple instrumental contributions, including industrial percussion.

===Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy (1991–93)===
His next project, the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, found Franti continuing his collaboration with Tse, and working with jazz guitarist Charlie Hunter, as well as electronic musicians Mark Pistel (Consolidated) and Jack Dangers (Meat Beat Manifesto). The Disposable Heroes wrote politically charged lyrics that railed against the injustices of the world, set to a fusion of industrial music and hip hop. Their first album, &quot;Hypocrisy is the Greatest Luxury&quot; (on Island Records), won plaudits for its social commentary, and they were chosen by U2 to open for their Zoo TV Tour.

The album&#x27;s lyrics dealt with a range of issues, including the US involvement in the Gulf war, the oil industry, homophobic violence, immigration, Franti&#x27;s own cultural background and adoption, and more personal politics. The single &quot;Television, The Drug of The Nation&quot; (previously recorded by Franti&#x27;s former project, The Beatnigs) gained airplay on college and alternative radio stations for its critique of mainstream television, which as the title implies, blames the media for a political numbing of ordinary people, explicit in the lyrics: &quot;T.V., it satellite links, our United States of unconsciousness, apathetic therapeutic and extremely addictive&quot;.

The Disposable Heroes recorded music accompanying novelist William Burroughs&#x27; readings for an album entitled &quot;Spare Ass Annie and Other Tales&quot;. The distinctive work of the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy has been analyzed in various academic papers, including by author Leslie Haywood and editor Jeniffer Drake in the book &quot;Third Wave Agenda, Being Feminist and Doing Feminism&quot;. The analysis involved the role of masculinity in the misogynist point of view which dominates popular music e.g. in rap music. The authors assert that Franti&#x27;s lyrics in treating women fairly in relationships is an exception.

According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot;, Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy is an innovative contemporary hip hop crew; a mixture of articulate manifesto rap which broke down beyond the black and white rhetoric, especially in the song &quot;Language of Violence&quot;, one of the first raps to speak about homophobia.

===Michael Franti and Spearhead (1994–present)===
In 1994, Franti dissolved the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy and formed a new band called Spearhead with a few studio musicians, including mainstay Carl Young. Their first release, &quot;Home&quot;, in September 1994, was a departure from the politically charged rap of the Disposable Heroes and drew more from funk and soul music. The album was produced by Franti and Joe Nicolo. The song &quot;Positive&quot;, also from the album &quot;Home&quot;, appeared on the &quot;Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool&quot; compilation album by the Red Hot Organization. In 1998, Spearhead recorded &quot;I Got Plenty &#x27;o Nuthin&quot; with Ernest Ranglin for the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Red Hot + Rhapsody&quot;.

Their follow-up album, &quot;Chocolate Supa Highway&quot; was released in March 1997, with several changes in band members between releases. This album featured a return to hip hop elements and a pronounced reggae influence and included guest appearances by notables like Stephen Marley and Joan Osborne.

After releasing the two albums, the band split with Capitol Records (reportedly prompted by the label&#x27;s repeated urging to perform with other artists like Will Smith). The band instead decided to create its own record label, Boo Boo Wax. Since Capitol Records owned the rights to the name &quot;Spearhead&quot;, subsequent albums were all released as &quot;Michael Franti &amp; Spearhead.&quot; His song &quot;Sometimes&quot; was included on the soundtrack to the 1999 film &quot;Mystery Men&quot;, as well as the soundtrack to the 2006 film &quot;Last Holiday&quot;. Also, under the &quot;Spearhead&quot; name, their cover version of The Police&#x27;s 1979 No. 32 hit, &quot;Roxanne&quot;, was featured on the soundtrack to the 1997 film &quot;Good Burger&quot;.

Michael Franti &amp; Spearhead released &quot;Stay Human&quot; in 2000 under their own label Boo Boo Wax in alignment with indie music label Six Degrees Records. The album&#x27;s central theme was the unjust nature of the death penalty and other major themes included mass media monopolization, the prison-industrial complex and corporate globalization. In an interview, Franti talked about the message of &quot;Stay Human&quot;: &quot;Half the record is songs about what&#x27;s happening in the world right now, and the other half is about how we cope with it as people who are concerned about what&#x27;s going on&quot;, he said. &quot;This specter of war, intimidation, this nation vs. the rest of the world, it wears us out. Half the record is a healthy dose of venting anger about that, and the other half is about how do we hold on to our spirituality, our community and our connectedness to each other.&quot;

In 2001, Franti was featured on Lamb&#x27;s album What Sound, providing backing vocals on the track &quot;I Cry&quot;. Also in 2001, Michael Franti &amp; Spearhead released the song &quot;Oh My God&quot;, arguably one of Michael Franti &amp; Spearhead&#x27;s most precise resistance songs. It was analyzed in Catherine Chaput&#x27;s book Entertaining Fear: Rhetoric and the Political Economy of Social Control. Chaput uses the lyrics of &quot;Oh My God&quot; to show how it is counter-productive to understand politics as distinct from economics and culture. The lyrics make connections across science, popular culture and politics.

&quot;Everyone Deserves Music&quot; was released in 2003. Franti composed many of the songs from his guitar and, like fellow 21st-century cultural globalists Manu Chao and Ozomatli, continues to synthesize his eclectic influences. In a departure from the industrial sounds of the Beatnigs and Disposable Heroes, and the minimalism of early Spearhead, Franti&#x27;s affirming lyrics are now set to swelling rock chords, while keeping a world-wise groove nodding towards reggae, dancehall, bossa nova, Afrobeat, and funk. Anthems like the title track &quot;Everyone Deserves Music&quot;, &quot;Yes I Will&quot; and &quot;Bomb The World&quot; are constructed with a nod to the 1980s rock of The Clash and U2, as well as to classic soul from Stax and Motown. The song &quot;We Don&#x27;t Stop&quot; (featuring Gift of Gab from Blackalicious and Spearhead&#x27;s rapper/beatbox technician Radioactive) bridges the two sounds in a &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; style mash-up. And on &quot;Love Why Did You Go Away&quot; and &quot;What I Be&quot;, Franti reveals an alluring, sensual singing voice. &quot;Pray For Grace&quot; and &quot;Bomb The World (Armageddon Version)&quot; pair Franti with the reggae/funk giants Sly and Robbie (Grace Jones, Rolling Stones, Black Uhuru, No Doubt).

Also in 2003, Franti released a mostly acoustic album, &quot;Songs from the Front Porch&quot; containing rearranged versions of older songs from &quot;Chocolate Supa Highway&quot;, &quot;Stay Human&quot; and &quot;Everyone Deserves Music&quot; as well as a couple of new tracks.

On July 25, 2006, Michael Franti &amp; Spearhead released &quot;Yell Fire!&quot;, inspired by Franti&#x27;s trip to Israel, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Iraq. In an effort to share his experiences from his trip and to explore the human cost of war, Franti produced a movie entitled &quot;I Know I&#x27;m Not Alone&quot;, using the songs from his album &quot;Yell Fire!&quot; as a soundtrack. &quot;One Step Closer To You&quot; from &quot;Yell Fire!&quot; features Pink on backing vocals. The whole album is available for listening in his website.

Franti and Spearhead have gained a worldwide audience through touring and appearances in alternative media like &quot;Mother Jones&quot; magazine and &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;.
Franti continues to tour in addition to producing the annual Power to the Peaceful festival each year since 1998. The festival originated as a way of supporting Mumia Abu-Jamal, who has been convicted of murdering a policeman but is considered by some on the Left to be a political prisoner. Michael Franti continues to gain influence in both popular music and social movements largely through extensive touring and word of mouth fan support. Lyrics from his song &quot;Bomb The World&quot;, written in the dark aftermath of September 11 such as &quot;You can bomb the world to pieces, but you can&#x27;t bomb it into peace&quot; have found their way onto protest signs and t-shirts all over the world from Los Angeles to Berlin, San Francisco to CNN, at demonstrations for peace large and small.

The song &quot;Light Up Ya Lighter&quot; by Michael Franti &amp; Spearhead was included on the soundtrack to &quot;Body of War&quot;, an award-winning documentary about Tomas Young, a paralyzed Iraq War veteran. Songs from &quot;Yell Fire&quot; and &quot;All Rebel Rockers&quot; are on the soundtrack to &quot;The Edge of Never&quot;, a documentary about extreme skiers mentoring 15-year-old Kye Peterson in his quest to ski the route in Chamonix, France that killed his father, Trevor Peterson, nine years earlier.

The album &quot;All Rebel Rockers&quot; was released on September 9, 2008, and was largely recorded in Jamaica at the Anchor studio in St Andrew. The band worked with ubiquitous rhythm team Sly and Robbie and featured multi-talented vocalist Cherine Anderson on the set which entered the Billboard 200 pop chart in September at number 38. The single &#x27;Say Hey (I Love You)&#x27; also reached Number 18 on the US Hot 100, providing Franti with his first US Top 20 single. Michael Franti was featured on Aux.tv&#x27;s show Volume where he spoke about U.S. politics and his efforts to make the world a better place.

Franti played three different events to commemorate President Barack Obama&#x27;s inauguration: The Green Ball, The Peace Ball and the Rock the Vote Party. Franti announced in November 2009 that he would be joining musician John Mayer on the Battle Studies Tour in spring 2010. As part of the band&#x27;s commitment to environmentalism, Michael Franti and Spearhead avoid the use of water bottles on national tours and run their tour bus on biodiesel.

Franti announced the release of &quot;The Sound of Sunshine&quot; on his official website in July 2010. It features 12 tracks including two versions of the title track, the new hit single, &quot;Shake It&quot;, and staples of his recent live performances including &quot;Hey Hey Hey&quot;, &quot;Anytime You Need Me&quot;, &quot;The Thing That Helps Me Get Through&quot;, and the anthemic arena-rock ballad &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Waiting&quot;. The album was originally set to be released on August 24, but was pushed back to September 21 to give the album &quot;more runway.&quot;

Franti started the recording process for &quot;The Sound of Sunshine&quot; in Jamaica but then continued to mix tracks and record in Bali before choosing to bring a portable studio on the road. He continued to record on the road and then test his ideas in front of live audiences to see if they liked it before going back and revamping it the next day. He has since been quoted as saying 90% of the album ended up being recorded on his laptop. In 2012, he joined the 11th annual Independent Music Awards judging panel to assist independent musicians&#x27; careers.

In 2013, Franti released &quot;All People&quot;. The single, &quot;I&#x27;m Alive (Life Sounds Like)&quot;, was released on July 30, 2013, and was featured on &quot;The Sims 4&quot; and &quot;Rayman Legends&quot; game trailers. He released the album &quot;SoulRocker&quot; in 2016. All the songs began on the acoustic guitar. In March 2018, Franti announced a new album, &quot;Stay Human, Vol. II&quot;, would be released in June 2018 and also stands as the soundtrack to his new documentary. In July Franti, via Instagram, announced the album was delayed until Fall 2018. &quot;Stay Human, Vol. II&quot; was released on January 25, 2019, and on October 12 the first single was released, &quot;Just to Say I Love you&quot;.

In 2020, Franti released the album &quot;Work Hard and Be Nice.&quot; His single &quot;Good Day for a Good Day&quot; from his 2022 album &quot;Follow Your Heart&quot; was a top 25 AAA hit. He did the music for the Woody Harrelson film &quot;Champions&quot;.

==Politics==
Franti is also an advocate for peace in the Middle East. His 2005 film &quot;I Know I&#x27;m Not Alone&quot; features footage of Iraq, the Palestinian territories, and Israel. Franti decided to embark on a three-week journey with friends to view the human cost of war in the Middle East first-hand. Franti said, &quot;This film came out of my frustration with watching the nightly news and hearing generals, politicians, and pundits explaining the political and economic cost of the war in the Middle East, without ever mentioning the human cost. I wanted to hear about the war by the people affected by it most: doctors, nurses, poets, artists, soldiers, and my personal favorite, musicians.&quot;

The film aims to speak to multiple generations and to give a better understanding of the people who still live in war-torn countries. He did not embark on the trip for the film with any special government groups or organizations. &quot;When I first had the idea for this journey, I had no idea how to get to Iraq and almost no idea how to make a film. After discovering that all you need to get into Iraq is a plane ticket, I prayed that movie making would be that simple...&quot; he said. After his trip to the Middle East, Franti argued that it was poverty more than religion that created tensions in the Gaza region. &quot;The poverty was so severe,&quot; said Franti. &quot;This really helped me to understand the frustration the Palestinian youth have. Ultimately, my belief is that it is poverty more than religion that creates tensions and frustrations. If you are struggling to feed your family, living on less than US$2 (Dh7.34) a day, as most Gaza residents are, and can see that past the checkpoint in Israel people live like in Los Angeles, then that really is going to cause mounting tensions.&quot;

In 2001, Franti was awarded the Domestic Human Rights Award by Global Exchange, an international NGO based in San Francisco, for his work to end war. In 2006, he was invited by Australian Labour MP Jenny Macklin to show the film at Australia&#x27;s Parliament House in Canberra.

Music and politics have always been a part of Franti&#x27;s art, as seen early in his career with the song &quot;Music and Politics&quot;, released during the &quot;Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy&quot; phase. The song consists of Franti reciting spoken word with a soft electric guitar riffing in the background. Although Franti&#x27;s point of view about the role of music in politics and the style of music he uses to express himself have changed, he still writes about politics and continues to work as an activist towards social change. The album &quot;All Rebel Rockers&quot; from 2008 (US #39) already with Spearhead was also a vehicle to express Franti&#x27;s political views through music. According to Franti, the album was inspired by contemporary issues like climate change, the price of gas going up and down, the stock market and the auto industry, and the Obama presidency.

His trip to the Middle East and his other world travel have helped shape his global political perspective. Franti works with the charitable cause Ubuntu Education Fund, has promoted vegan diets, has promoted being barefoot, and followed the Occupy Wall Street movement during one of Michael Franti and Spearhead&#x27;s tours.

==Do It for the Love==
Franti&#x27;s wish-granting nonprofit organization, Do It for the Love, is a project he founded in 2013 with his wife Sara Agah Franti, with a mission to bring individuals with life-threatening illnesses and trauma, children with severe challenges, and wounded veterans to live concerts in the goal to inspire joy through the healing power of music.

His foundation has bridged connections between fans of all ages with their musical heroes, with the participation of notable artists such as Billie Eilish, JoJo Siwa, Pentatonix, and Franti himself.

==Soulshine Bali==
Franti owns a yoga resort hotel in the southern part of Ubud, Bali, called Soulshine. It is considered &quot;Michael Franti&#x27;s oasis of yoga, soul, and rock n&#x27; roll.&quot; His resort was originally named &quot;Stay Human Yoga Retreat Center&quot; when it first opened in 2011, a joint venture between Franti and Carla Swanson.

In a 2020 interview, Franti explained what drew him to Bali, Indonesia specifically sharing, &quot;the first time I came to Bali I fell in love with the Balinese culture. People here are &quot;so&quot; incredible. That was in 2007. Bali is an island of creative geniuses, and what I mean by that is everybody, whether you&#x27;re a banker, shop owner or something like that, everyone does some form of art...they all really work together and they&#x27;re all &quot;super-creative&quot; and just &quot;very&quot; kind people. I fell in love with the culture. It&#x27;s a beautiful tropical Island here, so that&#x27;s great.&quot; He explained the organic nature of this venture, &quot;I thought it would be a good place to buy a little piece of land and, hopefully, build a little vacation home. So, we built five rooms with a yoga studio on top and it was like, &#x27;If you build it, they will come.&#x27; Sure enough, we started getting teachers bringing in groups of students here. Over the years we kept putting the money back into building more rooms and we are up to 32 rooms now.&quot; Soulshine has hosted many retreats led by people such as Trevor Hall and FullyRaw Kristina, serving organically grown food from their own farms. In 2020, the yoga resort additionally expanded into a day club.

In June 2020, Franti began hosting his &quot;Stay at Home Concert World Tour&quot; within his own yoga resort, taking part of the &quot;virtual concert revolution&quot; as a response to the COVID-19 Health Pandemic.

==Personal life==
Franti has three children. He is married to emergency room nurse and jewelry designer Sara Agah. He was previously married to Tara Franti-Rye from 1998 until 2004; she is the mother of Ade.

Inspired by one of his children, Franti became a vegan.

In 2000, Michael decided not to wear any shoes, initially for three days. Since then, he has chosen to go barefoot except for occasionally wearing flip-flops as required to board an airplane or to be served in a restaurant. He prefers bare feet. In 2014, Michael&#x27;s second eldest, Ade, was diagnosed with a kidney disease called Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The disease has left Ade with just 50% function in his kidneys. Michael said, &quot;My son being diagnosed was the worst news I ever got in my whole life... we didn&#x27;t know if he could graduate from high school or what kind of life he was going to have. We don&#x27;t know where it&#x27;s going to go next, but he inspires me everyday.&quot;

In September 2018, Franti&#x27;s third child, was born. It is his first child with Agah. They now have baby number two on the way.

Boston Red Sox centerfielder Shane Victorino uses the song &quot;Light up Ya Lighter&quot; as his batter walk-up music. &quot;Say Hey (I Love You)&quot; was used on the third episode of NBC&#x27;s series &quot;Mercy&quot;, as well as in the opening scene of the 2010 film &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot;. The same song was also used in 2010 in a commercial for Corona Light beer. The song is also featured on the soundtrack of EA Sports game, &quot;2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa&quot;.

He appeared as himself in the 2010 music documentary &quot;Sounds Like a Revolution&quot;.

&quot;I&#x27;m Alive (Life Sounds Like)&quot; was featured on the &quot;Arrival&quot; official trailer for &quot;The Sims 4&quot; during Gamescom 2013 at the Cologne Trade Fair in Cologne, Germany on August 20, 2013. It was also featured in the launch trailer for &quot;Rayman Legends&quot; and the final trailer for &quot;Coco&quot;.

Franti has collaborated with Slacker Radio, picking the tunes and providing commentaries, to create a radio station playing his favorite artists.

Franti premiered his own documentary &quot;Stay Human&quot; on April 27, 2018, at the Asbury Park Music and Film Festival. Written on his website about the film, Franti states, &quot;my new film Stay Human takes us on a journey through music and stories of some of the most inspiring individuals on the planet. Amazing people that I&#x27;ve met on my travels around the globe, who have chosen to overcome cynicism with optimism, hope, tenacity, music, and love – and remind us all what it means to STAY HUMAN.&quot;

A2 Milk Co used an arrangement of &quot;Life is Better with You&quot; as the soundtrack to its US national TV ad campaign in October 2019. The advertisement was shown on ABC, NBC, Bravo, Food Network and HGTV networks during major shows.

<text>The double-barred finch (Stizoptera bichenovii) is an estrildid finch found in dry savannah, tropical (lowland) dry grassland and shrubland habitats in northern and eastern Australia. It is sometimes referred to as Bicheno&#x27;s finch or as the owl finch, the latter of which owing to the dark ring of feathers around the face. It is the only species placed in the genus Stizoptera .

== Taxonomy ==
The double-barred finch was formally described in 1827 by the naturalists Nicholas Vigors and Thomas Horsfield from specimens collected near Shoalwater Bay and Broad Sound in Queensland, Australia. They coined the binomial name &quot;Fringilla bichenovii&quot;. The species was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Taeniopygia&quot;. A molecular phylogenetic study of the Estrildidae published in 2020 found that the genus &quot;Taeniopygia&quot; was not monophyletic. In the reorganization to create monophyletic genera, the double-barred finch was moved to the resurrected genus &quot;Stizoptera&quot; that had been introduced in 1899 by the American ornithologist Harry C. Oberholser. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;stizō&quot; meaning &quot;to tattoo&quot; with &quot;pteron&quot; meaning &quot;wing&quot;. The specific epithet commemorates James Ebenezer Bicheno, a colonial secretary of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land appointed in September 1842.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;S. b. annulosa&quot; (Gould, 1840) – north Western Australia and Northern Territory (northwest, north Australia)
* &quot;S. b. bichenovii&quot; (Vigors &amp; Horsfield, 1827) – north Queensland to southeast New South Wales (east Australia)

== Description==
The double-barred finch is a 10–11 cm long munia-like bird. It has a white face bordered with black, brown upperparts and throat, and white underparts. The throat and underparts are separated by another black line. The wings are patterned in brown and white. The sexes are similar, but juveniles are duller and browner. The subspecies &quot;S. b. annulosa&quot; differs from the nominate in having a black rather than a white .

== Behaviour ==
The double-barred finch is granivorous and highly gregarious. Nests are built in grass, bushes or low trees, with four to six eggs laid per clutch. The call is a soft &quot;tet&quot; or a louder &quot;peew&quot;, and the song is a soft fluting, which is somewhat like the zebra finch.

<text>Joseph Salvador (1716–1786) was a British businessman in London. Descended from Portuguese Sephardic Jews, he is often mistakenly referred to as having been the first and only Jew to serve as a director of the British East India Company. While Salvador invested considerable sums in East India Company stock and was active in Company politics in the 1760s, there is no evidence of his serving as a director.

Salvador&#x27;s ancestors had escaped persecution during the Portuguese Inquisition and migrated to the Netherlands. From there they immigrated to London, England in the eighteenth century. Salvador belonged to the Portuguese Sephardic Jewish synagogue in London, and was a leader in the affairs of this Portuguese-speaking community. He was a prominent businessman and financier. He lobbied for the 1753 Jew Bill to extend full citizenship and civil rights to Jews.

In 1759, Salvador was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. When George III ascended the throne of England, Salvador headed the seven-man delegation that congratulated him on behalf of England&#x27;s Jewish community. Salvador was a pro-Hanovarian freemason belonging to the Premier Grand Lodge of England and was engaged in anti-Jacobite activities.

Salvador was also a great patron; together with the DaCosta family, he sponsored transportation for 42 poor Jews to Georgia in 1733. These colonists lay the groundwork for what was to become the Jewish communities of the city of Savannah and Charleston, South Carolina. Many migrated from Savannah to Charleston after the Spanish attacked Georgia, as they feared getting caught in another Inquisition. From the 1730s, Charleston became the preferred destination for Sephardic Jews in the South.

The Salvador and the DaCosta family bought hundreds of thousands of acres in Ninety-Six District in the colony of South Carolina in the 1730s. He was eventually financially ruined after the great earthquake that destroyed Lisbon in 1755, as he had invested considerably in property in that city.

Joseph&#x27;s nephew was Francis Salvador, who emigrated to South Carolina in 1773, buying 7,000 acres in Ninety-Six District. He joined the American Patriot cause and in 1774 was elected to the Provincial Congress, the first Jew to be elected to public office in the Thirteen Colonies (and future United States.) In August 1776, he was killed in a battle in South Carolina, the first Jew to be killed in the American Revolutionary War.

<text>The New International Reader&#x27;s Version (NIrV) is a translation of the Bible in contemporary English. Translated by the International Bible Society (now Biblica) following a similar philosophy as the New International Version (NIV), but written in a simpler form of English, this version seeks to make the Bible more accessible for children and people who have difficulty reading English, such as non-native English speakers. The authors describe it as a special edition of the NIV written at a third grade reading level.

Zondervan and HarperCollins published a children&#x27;s version of this text in 2011, targeted at four to seven year olds and featuring the characters of the Berenstain Bears.

According to the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association (ECPA), the NIrV is the eighth on the list of best-selling English Bible translations.

== Translation History ==
The NIrV is based on the text of the NIV. Wherever possible, the NIrV uses the text of the NIV but adapts it for reading at a third-grade level (roughly ages 8-9).

In August 1991, Zondervan Publishing House wrote guidelines for developing a simplified version of the Bible to be based on the NIV Bible. The work on what would become the NIrV began in March 1992 in Colorado Springs, with the work being co-sponsored by the International Bible Society and Zondervan Publishing House. Many of those who translated the NIV were also involved in the creation of the NIrV. In addition, there were many other literary experts and educators who specialized in education among children. This was to ensure the best possible product became available for the target audience. 

Throughout the process, the NIV guidelines were utilised to maintain accuracy, clarity and readability. Furthermore, the original Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic Biblical texts were consulted. The process was completed after a final review committee approved the work.

In total, almost 40 people from 14 denominations worked together to create the NIrV.

In March 1994, the New Testament was completed, with reviews and proofing beginning. The name, the New International Reader&#x27;s Version (NIrV) was announced by the International Bible Society in August of that year. By the end of 1995, the Old Testament was also completed, and the full Bible was first published in the autumn of 1996.

==Example text==
Here is a comparison of a passage from the First Letter to Timothy in the New King James Version, the New International Version, and the New International Reader&#x27;s Version:

;NKJV: &quot;And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, Justified in the Spirit, Seen by angels, Preached among the Gentiles, Believed on in the world, Received up in glory.&quot; (1 Timothy 3:16, NKJV)

;NIV: &quot;Beyond all question, the mystery from which true godliness springs is great: He appeared in the flesh, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.&quot; (1 Timothy 3:16, NIV)

;NIrV: &quot;There is no doubt that true godliness comes from this great mystery. Jesus came as a human being. The Holy Spirit proved that he was the Son of God. He was seen by angels. He was preached among the nations. People in the world believed in him. He was taken up to heaven in glory.&quot; (1 Timothy 3:16, NIrV)

<text>Penang Free School (PFS), located at Green Lane in George Town, Penang, Malaysia, is the oldest English-medium school in Southeast Asia. Founded in 1816, its academic achievements lead to its inclusion in the Malaysian Ministry of Education&#x27;s Cluster School and High Performance School systems.

This secondary school has been an all-boys school since its inception, although girls are now admitted for Form 6. In addition, the school has produced several notable Malaysian and Singaporean personalities, including Tunku Abdul Rahman, P. Ramlee, Wu Lien-teh, Lim Chong Eu, Tuanku Syed Putra, Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin and Wee Chong Jin; its alumni are known as the &#x27;Old Frees&#x27;.

Penang Free School maintains its historical rivalry with St. Xavier&#x27;s Institution, another school in George Town which also claims the honour of being Malaysia&#x27;s oldest school.

==History==

The establishment of a &quot;&#x27;free school&quot;&#x27; that was open to all ethnicities was first mooted by a committee led by Rev. Robert Sparke Hutchings in 1816. It was initially proposed that a boarding school would be built to provide education and daily care for orphans and the poor, and that the boarding school would consist of two blocks, one for male students and another for girls. Local Asian children would be taught in their mother tongues, while English would only be taught for those who desired it.

Penang Free School came into being on 21 October that year, with William Cox as its first principal, and was originally housed at Love Lane. This was a temporary arrangement, as the new school building at the adjoining Farquhar Street was still under construction. The building, situated next to St. George&#x27;s Church, was completed in 1821.
By the 1890s, as the school building became overcrowded, a tender was called for the construction of a new wing. The new wing, funded mainly by Chinese philanthropists such as Chung Keng Quee, was completed in 1896. Another wing was also built in 1906. In addition, English was made the standard medium of instruction within the school.

By the 1920s, the building was also reaching its maximum capacity. Therefore, plans were drawn up for the relocation of Penang Free School to a suburban site further inland, while the school premises at Farquhar Street was to be turned into a primary school. In 1928, Penang Free School was officially moved to a site at Green Lane, where it remains to this day. The old school building was turned into Hutchings School; today, this particular building houses the Penang State Museum.

In 1958, the then Prime Minister of Malaya and an alumnus of Penang Free School, Tunku Abdul Rahman, opened the school&#x27;s Form 6 block, making it the first school in northern Malaya to offer secondary education up to Form 6. More school blocks were added over the years, enabling it to switch to a single-session school system by 1992.
