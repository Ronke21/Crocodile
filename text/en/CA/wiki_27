<text>The Tungsten series was Palm, Inc.&#x27;s line of business-class Palm OS-based PDAs.

==Details==

The Tungsten series was introduced in October 2002, created as a &quot;prosumer&quot; line priced at $199 to $300 to compete with the popular Sony Clie and Windows Mobile PDAs. The first device in the line is the Tungsten T, making it the first Palm PDA to be labeled with a letter rather than a number and to run Palm OS 5.

All of the Tungsten PDAs have a few attributes in common:
* 65,536 color LCD touch screen with a minimum 320 x 320 pixel resolution
* metal or metal-toned enclosure
* available flip cover to protect the screen
* Secure Digital (SD) card slot with SDIO for memory cards and accessories
* no built-in camera

All models except the Tungsten C, W, and E have built-in Bluetooth wireless capabilities, while the Tungsten C and TX feature built-in Wi-Fi connectivity. Furthermore, by using the optional Palm Wi-Fi Secure_Digital#SDIO_cards Card accessory, the T3, T5, and E2 can also gain Wi-Fi connectivity.

With the exception of the Tungsten W, all Tungsten PDAs run Palm OS 5 &quot;Garnet&quot; on an ARM processor and have non-user-replaceable lithium-ion batteries. Some users replaced battery packs with third-party units. The T3, for example, shipped with a 900 mAh capacity battery but third-party 1100 mAh or 1150 mAh LI-poly batteries of the same physical dimensions were available. Tungsten models used a five-way navigator pad, in the shape of a rounded rectangle, circle, or oval and had four buttons for built-in applications.

The Palm Universal Connector is used by the Tungsten T, Tungsten T2, Tungsten T3, Tungsten C, Tungsten W, for cradles and accessories, while the Tungsten E uses a mini-USB connection; the Tungsten T5, Tungsten E2 and TX used an Athena Connector also known as the Palm Multi-Connector.

All Tungsten handhelds come bundled with Dataviz&#x27;s Documents To Go office suite and some version of Kinoma Player, with the exception of the Tungsten W.

==Models==
===Tungsten E===
Palm&#x27;s Tungsten E was the cheapest of the Tungsten series, and as such, has been one of the most successful. It has 32 megabytes of memory, a Texas Instruments OMAP (ARM) 126 MHz processor, a transreflective TFT screen, and ran Palm OS 5.2.1. It is , and weighs .

It had a standard 3.5 mm headphone jack and a speaker in back and used a mini USB connector not supported by most dock accessories. At introduction, it was US$199.

The Tungsten E, released in October 2003, was intended to replace the aging Palm m515, one of the last holdouts from Palm&#x27;s old product line. The Tungsten E, though, did not include a vibrating alarm and indicator light like the Palm m500 series had.

Since it was released at the same time as the Tungsten T3, the Tungsten E included the T3&#x27;s newer PIM apps and the enhanced &quot;agenda view&quot; for quick viewing of to-do items and upcoming calendar items. The Tungsten E&#x27;s design influenced the Tungsten T series&#x27; subsequent devices, the Tungsten T5 and the TX.

It was superseded in April 2005, when palmOne released the Tungsten E2.

===Tungsten E2===

The Tungsten E2, introduced on April 13, 2005, replaced the similarly named Tungsten E, had 32 MB of memory (29.7 available), a 200 MHz Intel XScale processor, 320x320 Transflective TFT color display, and ran Palm OS Garnet v5.4.7. It is and weighs . It had a standard 3.5 mm headphone jack, a longer-lasting battery than the Tungsten E, had Bluetooth capability, and a single speaker on the back.

Much like the Tungsten T5 and Treo 650, it used non-volatile flash memory, this time in the form of &quot;Non-Volatile File System&quot;, meaning that the data would be preserved even if the battery ran out. It used standard SD memory cards and was also compatible with the &quot;Palm Wi-Fi Card&quot; (sold separately). It used a standard Athena Connector port supported only by some then-newer accessories.

When it was released, its retail price was US$249. In October 2005, the price was reduced to US$199.

Unlike other models, the &quot;Find&quot; function was limited to only the first eight matches, and the calculator incorrectly found percentages at half their actual value, though this was fixed in units shipping after April 2006.

The Tungsten E2 had the ability to use WiFi, but only by using an add-on SDIO card released by PalmOne, manufactured by SyChip. Encryption was restricted to primitive WEP security, and did not offer WPA or WPA2.

The maximum size SD card supported on the Tungsten E2 was 1 GB due to a software limitation. In order to read larger SD and SDHC cards an upgraded driver is required. The previous model (Tungsten E) had been reported to be capable of using 2 GB SD cards.

===Tungsten T===

The first Tungsten, the Tungsten T, introduced in November 2002 and known during development as the M550, was the first model to use Palm OS 5. The Tungsten T was designed by Palm engineers based in Arlington Heights, Illinois.

It had: 
* 16 megabytes of memory, 
* Texas Instruments OMAP (ARM) 144 MHz processor, 
* built-in microphone for voice memos, 
* dedicated voice memo button,
* vibrating alarms,
* standard 3.5 mm headphone jack,
* one front-facing speaker,
* indicator light,
* Palm OS 5.0

It is tall, tall with the slider extended, by wide by thick, and weighs .

Its design set itself apart from other PDAs by having a sliding lower portion; the bottom third of the casing could be slid up and down to cover or reveal the touch-sensitive Graffiti writing area. At introduction, it was US$499.

Many of the features in the Tungsten T were Palm firsts. It was the first Palm PDA to use a version of Palm OS 5 and an ARM processor, which meant that it had the software and processing power for high-quality real-time video playback and MP3 playback.

It was also the first Palm PDA with a: 
* 320 × 320 resolution screen
* Bluetooth wireless communications radio built-in
* microphone with a dedicated voice memo button
* front-facing speaker instead of rear-facing
* telescoping stylus
* reset hole large enough to be pressed by the included stylus&#x27; tip instead of a pin as with previous Palm PDAs

The slider feature was unique. When open, the Tungsten T looked like a normal slate-shaped PDA, but the bottom portion, with the five-way controller and four buttons, could slide shut, covering up the Graffiti writing area. This made it the smallest Palm PDA in height. The Tungsten T was the last Palm PDA to use the original Graffiti Version 1 handwriting recognition software. Because of a lawsuit by Xerox Corporation Palm Inc. was forced to discontinue Graffiti 1 and later Palm PDAs used Graffiti Version 2. The revised software required two separate strokes for entry of some letters of the alphabet, such as the letters &quot;t&quot; and &quot;k&quot;. Most all of the other letters required strokes different from those used in Graffiti 1.

Palm&#x27;s reasoning behind the slider was that users spent more time viewing data rather than entering it. Thus, they chose to hide the data entry medium while not in use to make a more compact device.

The slider caused two problems with the Tungsten T. One drawback was that the Tungsten T was known for its digitizer becoming miscalibrated after about one year of use and requiring further recalibration. A software patch issued by Palm helped with this problem. Another problem was that the ribbon cable between the mainboard and the digitizer connectors that tended to become loose over time, requiring disassembly to reconnect the ribbon cable for further use.

The Tungsten T was succeeded by the Tungsten T2.

===Tungsten T2===
The Tungsten T2, introduced in July 2003 for US$399, was simply a minor update to the Tungsten T, and had exactly the same form factor. (Save for the label and the T|T2&#x27;s slightly lighter case color, they are superficially identical.) The memory was increased to 32 megabytes, the screen was replaced with a superior (backlight) TFT LCD of the same size and resolution, Palm OS upgraded to 5.2.1, Graffiti replaced with Graffiti2. Since it is much like the Tungsten T model, PalmOne did not sell this model in some markets, such as mainland China or Brazil.

The Tungsten T2 was discontinued in April 2004, having been succeeded by the Tungsten T3.

===Tungsten T3===

The Tungsten T3 was the third &quot;T-Class&quot; Tungsten device, released in October 2003. It had 64 MB of memory (with 52 MB usable), a 400 MHz Intel PXA261 processor, a new 3.7-inch 320×480 transflective TFT LCD touch-screen, and ran Palm OS version 5.2.1. It was the last product designed by the Palm engineers in Arlington Heights.

The T3 included Active Input Technology with Virtual Graffiti 2, a virtual keyboard, and the typical Tungsten line slider. Along with many other additional features, the T3 was released with the same $399 retail price tag as the Tungsten T2 until the release of the Tungsten T5, when it was reduced to $349.

Like the Tungsten T and T2, the T3 still had a front-facing speaker, a microphone, a vibrating alarm feature, an indicator light, and all of their other features.

Like the Tungsten E, the Tungsten T3 came with an enhanced PIM Suite which categorized all appointments and tasks on the Calendar (formerly Date Book) screen. The Enhanced PIM Software also featured an improved Task suite (formerly To Do List) which could categorize tasks by urgency, category, etc., and an improved Contacts (formerly Address) application with picture support and more fields.

Furthermore, a new status bar appeared at the bottom of screen, giving quick access to the time, system information, home, find, menu access, alerts, Bluetooth, full-screen writing, screen rotation, and what is shown in the input area.

The Tungsten T3 came with RealPlayer for Palm OS Handhelds (called &quot;RealOne Player for Palm OS Handhelds&quot; at the time of its release) in addition to a 3.5 mm Stereo Jack, making it a digital music player when used with a Secure Digital (SD) flash memory card.

The T3 had a bigger, non-round, 5-way navigation pad with the four application buttons placed around it in a circular fashion instead of in a row, breaking from Palm&#x27;s traditional application button layout. Palm would return to its more traditional layout in the following Tungsten T5 and Palm TX.

The T3 had a Green/Red LED indicator light, however Palm only used the green LED for most purposes, red only being used by certain third-party programs and libraries.

The T3 also had the Palm Universal Connector and an included USB cradle. The cradle was used for both charging and synchronizing the Palm&#x27;s data to a PC (With support included for Windows and Mac OS X, but with the pilot-link software, the unit synchronizes perfectly with a Unix operating system).

Early criticisms of the Tungsten T3 include it electronically damaging SD cards and its relatively low battery life (900 mA·h battery, larger display and processor clocked above most other Palm handhelds). Palm addressed the Secure Digital Card problem by releasing a Firmware Update. After the &quot;SD Card Patch&quot; was applied in early (by the user via a firmware patch) and later (at the manufacturing stage) releases of the Tungsten T3, no other criticisms were known to have risen from the Tungsten T3&#x27;s use.

Shortly after the early 2005 release of the Tungsten T5, the Tungsten T3 was discontinued. Since then, no other Palm handhelds included a vibrating alarm, a slider to make the device smaller, or the Palm Universal Connector.

===Tungsten T5===
The Tungsten T5, introduced in October 2004 and now discontinued, was aesthetically a combination of the Tungsten E and Tungsten T3. It was the first and only Tungsten to use a 416 MHz Intel XScale PXA270 processor. It had a 320×480 TFT 16-bit Color Screen with a virtual input area. It retained the shape of the Tungsten E, but was taller, instead of the sliding bodies of the previous Tungsten T-series handhelds.

The Tungsten T5 was the first Palm PDA to have a 320×480 pixel screen without a slider mechanism as used in the Tungsten T3, T2, and T, though other brands have had sliderless HVGA displays for years. It was also the first to have 256 MB of memory (versus 64 MB in the Tungsten T3), with 161.2 MB configured as a &quot;Flash Drive&quot; - accessible to computers via the device&#x27;s Drive Mode feature, 63.8 MB available for applications, and 31 MB reserved for the OS. This often resulted in some confusion as the memory was not equally usable as in previous Palm PDAs.

While the Tungsten T5 was meant to be a replacement for the Tungsten T3, it lacked several features from the Tungsten T3 such as a charge-indicator LED, a vibrating alarm, an included HotSync cradle, and built in microphone for voice memos. Furthermore, its speaker became rear-facing instead of front-facing and the PDA used the then-new Multi-Connector/Athena Connector instead of the Palm Universal Connector. The speed of the Bluetooth connection can only be set to a maximum of 128 kbit/s.

At the time of its release, the Tungsten T5 (along with the Treo 650) was plagued with memory inefficiency problems, third-party application issues, and device driver crashes, due to the new Non-Volatile File System. The addition of NVFS however, brought the benefit of no longer losing all stored data in the event of a complete battery drain.

Tungsten T5 owners were encouraged to install the Tungsten T5 1.1 Update, which addressed the memory inefficiency issues alongside other operating system-level problems.

The power button was prone to reliability issues causing it to become inoperative over time, requiring the user to either use a third-party app, rely on the PDA&#x27;s other physical buttons or insert a SD card which would then switch the PDA back on. 

In some countries, including Australia, the Tungsten T5 was withdrawn early since the Palm TX offered more advanced, built-in WiFi support, instead of requiring the optional &quot;Palm Wi-Fi Card&quot; in its one and only SD slot as many other non-Palm PDAs on the market at the time came standard with built-in WiFi.

===Tungsten W===
The Tungsten W (known as the i710 during its development period, and X420 at the prototype stage), was introduced in February 2003. The sole smartphone (PDA/cellphone hybrid) in the Tungsten series, instead of running Palm OS 5 on an ARM-compatible processor, it used last-generation Palm OS 4 paired with a Motorola DragonBall processor that was typical of Palm OS 4 devices.

It had a thumb-sized hard plastic keyboard, like the Treo 600 rather than the typical silkscreen Graffiti Writing Area found on most Palm handhelds. (This form factor would be reused in the Tungsten C, except lacking the W&#x27;s external antennae).

The Tungsten W focused more on its PDA half than its cellular telephony half, much like its predecessors, the Palm i705 and Palm VII. Unlike either the Palm i705 and the Palm VII (which both could only make data connections over the Mobitex pager network), downloads and uploads were done using comparatively-fast GPRS connections. It lacked a microphone and the speaker couldn&#x27;t be used for phone calls; instead, an included ear bud and microphone loopset was used for voice calls.

A flip cover was also released that allowed the user to hold the handheld like a normal phone and talk on it, although it did obscure the screen. (In the US, it was sold exclusively by AT&amp;T Wireless, and all Tungsten W handsets sold in the US were to AT&amp;T Wireless. Canadian W&#x27;s were not locked to any service provider and could operate with T-Mobile SIM cards).

It had 16 megabytes of memory, a Motorola DragonBall 33 MHz processor, vibrating alarms, indicator light, and ran Palm OS 4.1.1 (with an optional upgrade to 4.1.2) with special enhancements for its 320×320 display since most Palm OS 4 devices had 160×160 displays. It is tall by wide by thick, and weighs . It had a standard 2.5 mm headset jack, and a single rear speaker. At introduction, it retailed at US$419 before service provider subsidies.

The Tungsten W was succeeded by the Treo 600 after Palm purchased Handspring and became palmOne.

===Tungsten C===
The Tungsten C introduced in April 2003 was, at the time of its release, palmOne&#x27;s only handheld that allowed the user to access the internet wirelessly through 802.11b Wi-Fi without the use of a card or other external device. It lacked support for the WPA encryption standard but did however have built in PPTP VPN support for secure connections to VPN servers.

The web browser included was PalmSource&#x27;s Web Browser 2.0. Novarra Web Pro 3.0 could be purchased as an upgrade.

Other details were its 400 MHz Intel PXA255 processor, 64 MB of memory (51 MB available for programs + 12 MB heap), built-in thumb keyboard, a five-way navigator, a Secure Digital/SDIO/MultiMediaCard slot, vibrating alarms, indicator light, and a 2.5 mm headset jack, capable of voice recording and monaural sound output with a proprietary earbud headset (sold separately).

Third-party applications and hardware were available that worked around the Tungsten C&#x27;s monaural audio. For instance, a special adapter could be purchased to convert to a standard 3.5 mm jack that splits the mono output into left and right channels.

The Tungsten C was superseded by the LifeDrive Mobile Manager, the Palm TX, and the Treo series.

<text>USS &quot;Gettysburg&quot; (CG-64) is a &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class guided-missile cruiser in the United States Navy. She is named for the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War.

==Construction==
The third &quot;Gettysburg&quot; (CG-64) was laid down on 17 August 1988, at Bath, Maine, by Bath Iron Works; launched on 22 July 1989; sponsored by Julie Nixon Eisenhower, wife of Dwight D. Eisenhower II, grandson of former President Dwight D. Eisenhower and son-in-law of former President Richard M. Nixon; and commissioned on 22 June 1991, Captain John M. Langknecht in command.

==Operation history==
October 1992 - April 1993, maiden deployment to the Mediterranean Sea in support of the carrier battle group; along with sister ship .
On 30 November 1994, &quot;Gettysburg&quot; and guided missile frigate were dispatched to assist the cruise ship , which was on fire in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Somalia. &quot;Achille Lauro&quot; eventually sank but the passengers were rescued and transported to Djibouti, Djibouti.

On 13 October 1996, she bumped into Iranian corvette in the northern Persian Gulf, however neither of the ships suffered serious damage.

&quot;Gettysburg&quot; took part in Operation Desert Fox, 16–20 December 1998.

In March 2003, the ship was assigned to Cruiser-Destroyer Group Twelve.

&quot;Gettysburg&quot;, Captain Philip C. Davidson in command, and with a Sikorsky SH-60B Seahawk of Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron Light (HSL) 46 Detachment 5 and a Coast Guard law enforcement detachment (LEDET) embarked, sailed from Naval Station Mayport, on a two-part counter narcotics deployment to the Western Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, 11 October–23 December 2005 and 1 January–4 April 2006. She visited Curaçao, Netherlands Antilles, 21–25 October, passed through the Panama Canal, 3–4 November, and provided air surveillance and evacuation support for a visit by President George W. Bush to Panama. In addition, the ship visited Vasco Nunez de Balboa, Panama, 18–22 November and 5–6 and 16–18 December. &quot;Gettysburg&quot; intercepted three narcotics smuggling vessels, of cocaine, and 17 smugglers before the New Year. She came about on 17 December, and intercepted her third suspect, a vessel carrying more than of cocaine in the Eastern Pacific, on 22 December.

The ship, with HSL-46 Detachment 5 and Coast Guard LEDET 409 embarked, intercepted MV &quot;Perseus V&quot; on 12 January 2006. The boarding team discovered a hidden compartment containing of cocaine and detained 11 suspected smugglers. The boarders then placed a custody crew on board, which delivered the boat to host nation authorities more than away four days later.

On 7 February &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, with LEDET 404 embarked, carried out a covert, nighttime surveillance and pre-dawn interception of fishing boat &quot;Divi&quot;, which analysts suspected of smuggling up to of cocaine. The suspects sighted &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, set fire to their vessel, and abandoned ship in a skiff. The cruiser deployed two rigid hull inflatable boats (RHIBs) to battle the blaze, but the intense, fuel-fed flames overwhelmed &quot;Divi&quot; and she sank. The boarders observed more than 150 bales of cocaine on the smuggler’s deck, but only retrieved less than . The Americans took the eight crewmen into custody.

&quot;Gettysburg&quot; patrolled an area about west of the Galapagos Islands when a Lockheed P-3C Orion directed her to query fishing boat &quot;William&quot;, on 24 February 2006. The Orion aggressively monitored the suspected vessel, preventing her from rendezvousing with a go-fast. &quot;Gettysburg&quot; meanwhile launched &quot;Cutlass 467&quot;, her Seahawk, which guided the ship toward &quot;William&quot;, but the suspects attempted to scuttle their boat. &quot;Gettysburg&quot;″s rescue and assistance teams and LEDET 404 saved &quot;William&quot;, enabling her boarding team to recovery of cocaine and apprehend the eight smugglers.

An Orion located a stealthy go-fast steaming westerly courses through a known drug-trafficking area on 11 March. &quot;Gettysburg&quot; closed and under cover of darkness, deployed LEDET 404 and a security team on board a RHIB, which boarded the suspected vessel, seizing of cocaine, of heroin, and detaining five smugglers. In addition, she sailed through the Panama Canal twice, 30–31 January and 15–16 March, and visited Cartagena, Colombia, 20–21 January, Vasco Nunez de Balboa, 16–19 February and 4-5 and 15–16 March, Curaçao, 23–26 March, and Port Everglades, Florida, 29 March-1 April. During this second voyage she seized or interdicted four suspected smuggling vessels and more than of cocaine with a street value of $1.7 billion, detaining 34 suspected smugglers. Additionally, she issued return-to-port orders to two Colombian-flagged vessels capable of providing logistics support to narcotics traffickers. Working with other agencies and Orions during the two deployments, &quot;Gettysburg&quot; proved instrumental in the seizure of seven vessels, 45 smugglers, and 750 bales totaling more than of cocaine and heroin valued at $1.95 billion.

Amphibious assault ship , which operated as the afloat staging base for Combined Task Force (CTF) 151, coordinated the apprehension of six pirates in the Gulf of Aden on 20 March 2009. A skiff containing the suspects pursued Philippine-flagged MV &quot;Bison Express&quot;, which sent a distress call. &quot;Gettysburg&quot;″s embarked SH-60B from HSL-46 spotted the pirates throwing objects overboard, and a visit, board, search, and seizure team from the cruiser seized the suspects, who were then transferred to &quot;Boxer&quot; for questioning.

CTF-151, Turkish Rear Admiral Caner Bener, in command, defeated a pirate attack in the Gulf of Aden on 13 May 2009. &quot;Gettysburg&quot; and South Korean helicopter destroyer responded to a distress call from Egyptian-flagged MV &quot;Amira&quot; when pirates attacked her south of Al Mukalla, Yemen. A Seahawk from HSL-46 Detachment 9, embarked on board &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, located a dhow suspected of serving as a &quot;mother ship&quot; for pirates. A visit, board, search, and seizure team and Coast Guard LEDET 409 from the cruiser discovered a variety of weapons on board the dhow and detained her 17 crewmembers. &quot;Gettysburg&quot; rescued another ship during her busy deployment when a Seahawk from the cruiser responded to Yemeni MV &quot;Alaseb&quot; and her 11 passengers, adrift in the Gulf of Aden on 26 May. The helo guided &quot;Gettysburg&quot; to the area, which towed &quot;Alaseb&quot; to a rendezvous with the Yemen Coast Guard for repairs.

The 13 May 2009, incident with MV &quot;Amira&quot; was filmed and featured on the Spike TV network special &quot;U.S. Navy: Pirate Hunters&quot;.

&quot;Gettysburg&quot; completed her Composite Unit Training Exercise as part of Carrier Strike Group Two on 10 February 2011. &quot;Gettysburg&quot; deployed with an embarked Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 70 (HSM-70) detachment as part of Carrier Strike Group Two, departing Naval Station Mayport on 10 May 2011. &quot;Gettysburg&quot; subsequently participated in NATO naval exercise Exercise Saxon Warrior off the coast of England, under the operational control of Flag Officer Sea Training (FOST). During this exercise, &quot;Gettysburg&quot; operated with the new British guided-missile destroyer .

In May 2015, &quot;Gettysburg&quot;&#x27;s homeport was changed from NAVSTA Mayport to Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia. 

&quot;Gettysburg&quot; entered into the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) on 30 September 2015. She was drydocked and underwent extensive modernization and material repairs including an upgrade of her radar and AEGIS weapon system. She went underway again for the first time in nearly nine years on 28 February 2023. &quot;Gettysburg&quot; was the first &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruiser to successfully navigate the SLEP program at an estimated cost of over $200 million.

In September, 2024, &quot;Gettysburg&quot; departed Norfolk, VA in support of the deployment of Carrier Strike Group 8.

On 22 December 2024, &quot;Gettysburg&quot; shot down a F/A-18F Super Hornet belonging to Strike Fighter Squadron 11 (VFA-11) and flying off the . USCENTCOM stated that both the pilot and weapon systems officer ejected and were recovered safely shortly after, with only one receiving minor injuries after an initial assessment. The &quot;Gettysburg&quot; also fired on a second F/A-18 and missed by ~100 feet. The missile missed thanks to the pilot performing evasive maneuvers.

Chad Smith was born in Pontiac, Michigan, where his father had gone for work. His parents were Nelson Smith, a Cherokee, and Pauline Smith, (western European ancestry). He grew up in Nashville, Tennessee. As a boy, Smith achieved the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts in Nashville.

He grew up with stories of his Cherokee ancestors. He is the great-grandson of Redbird Smith, a Cherokee Nation Senator and a traditionalist who founded the Nighthawk Keetoowah Society, a religious, cultural, and political organization dedicated to reviving the Cherokee way of life. Redbird Smith fought the allotment policy, under which the United States government took more than 7,000,000 acres (28,000 km2) of land from the Cherokee. Rachel Quinton, Chad Smith&#x27;s grandmother, was a lifelong advocate for the Cherokee people and the treasurer for the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians.

Smith received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in education from the University of Georgia in 1973, a master&#x27;s degree in public administration from the University of Wisconsin in 1975, a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Tulsa in 1980, and an MBA in Hospitality Management from the University of Nevada-Las Vegas in 2008.

==Professional life==

From 1979 to 1980, Smith served a consultant in Indian Law and Tribal Management to the Cherokee Nation&#x27;s Tribal Operations. From 1982 to 1986, he served as Assistant District Attorney in Creek County, Oklahoma. On two separate occasions, Smith served as the Estate Tax Attorney of the United States Department of Treasury, from 1980 to 1982 and from 1987 to 1989. He was a prosecutor for the Cherokee Nation during 1985–1995 (during the Wilma Mankiller administration).

From 1989 to 1995 and from 1997 to 1999, he operated a private law practice out of Tulsa, Oklahoma, representing clients in civil rights litigation and appeals, criminal defense, and general civil litigation, with a focus on Indian law. Smith served as an Assistant Public Defender and served as counsel to economically deprived defendants in the District Court of Tulsa County.

Prior to his service as Principal Chief, Smith taught Indian law at Northeastern State University, Rogers State University, and for a semester at Dartmouth College while he was a visiting fellow.

From 1999 to 2011, Smith served as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, the second largest Indian tribe in the United States with more than 285,000 citizens.

Before becoming Principal Chief, Smith taught Indian law at Dartmouth College, Northeastern State University and Rogers State University. He served two previous Cherokee Nation chiefs as Director of Tribal Planning, Legal Historian, Cherokee Nation Prosecutor, Director of Justice and Advisor to the Tribal Tax Commission. He also successfully operated his own law practice, served Tulsa County as an assistant public defender and worked as an assistant district attorney in Creek County.

==Political career==

Smith completed his third 4-year term as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation in 2011. The Principal Chief is the head of the executive branch of the tribal government. The position is responsible for the execution of the laws of the Cherokee Nation, establishment of tribal policy, and delegation of authority for the day-to-day operations of the tribe. Before his election, Smith served under two Cherokee Nation chiefs as Director of Tribal Planning, Legal Historian, Attorney, Cherokee Nation Prosecutor, Director of Justice and adviser to the tribal tax commission.

Smith was elected Principal Chief on July 24, 1999, defeating the incumbent Principal Chief Joe Byrd in a runoff election. Byrd&#x27;s first term was marked with tension and constitutional crisis issues. Smith received 7,204 votes (56.48%) to Byrd&#x27;s 5,552 votes (43.52%). During his first term, Hastings Shade, a Cherokee traditionalist, language teacher, artist, and author, served as deputy chief.

Smith was re-elected to subsequent terms in 2003 and 2007, with Joe Grayson as deputy chief, who is a bilingual, full-blood community organizer and military veteran.

In 2006, Smith supported amending the constitution of the Cherokee Nation to restrict citizenship to those having &quot;Indian blood&quot;. This action expelled about 2,800 people from the tribe who were known as the Cherokee freedmen, as they were descended from people who had been enslaved by Cherokees rather than being Cherokee by blood. Smith argued that since the Cherokee were a sovereign nation, they could establish their own rules for qualification of citizenship. The action was contrary to a post–Civil War treaty that said the Nation had given full citizenship rights to the formerly enslaved people, and was disputed in both U.S. federal courts and Cherokee Nation courts.

Smith ran for a fourth term in 2011. His running mate was Chris Soap, son of Charlie Soap, husband of the late Principal Chief Wilma Mankiller. He was challenged by Bill John Baker, who supported inclusion of descendants of freedmen in the tribe. The election was held on June 25, 2011. Both candidates have twice been declared the winner, because voting was so close. Because the results could not be determined with mathematical certainty, the Cherokee Nation Supreme Court ordered a second vote for Sept. 24, 2011. As the Cherokee Nation constitution does not allow elected officials to remain in office past Inauguration Day, Smith left office on Aug. 14, 2011. S. Joe Crittenden was sworn in as deputy chief, and elevated to acting principal chief in accordance with the constitutional chain of succession.

During his tenure as principal chief, Smith focused on three initiatives: economic self-reliance for the tribe, Cherokee language and cultural revitalization, and community development in Northeastern Oklahoma. Language immersion programs for Cherokee children and youth have been established. Smith popularized the term &quot;gadugi&quot;, which in Cherokee refers to the spontaneous work crews communities formed as needs arose. It has come to mean coming together to work for the good of all Cherokee.

The modern Cherokee Nation has had steady economic growth. During Smith&#x27;s tenure, agricultural growth, and business, corporate, real estate expansion occurred. Some has been funded by revenues from numerous casino operations. The Cherokee Nation controls Cherokee Nation Entertainment, a gaming and hospitality company with several thousand employees in Eastern Oklahoma, as well as Cherokee Nation Industries, a defense contractor. .

Since 1992 the Cherokee Nation has served as the lead tribe for the Inter-Tribal Environmental Council (ITEC). The mission of ITEC is to protect the health of Native Americans, their natural resources, and their environment as it relates to air, land, and water. To accomplish this mission, ITEC provides technical support, training and environmental services in a variety of environmental disciplines. There are 39 ITEC member tribes in Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas.

In February 2021, the Supreme Court of the Cherokee Nation rejected the citizenship restriction that had been passed at the instigation of Smith, saying &quot;The &#x27;by blood&#x27; language found within the Cherokee Nation Constitution, and any laws which flow from that language, is illegal, obsolete, and repugnant to the ideal of liberty. These words insult and degrade the descendants of the Freedman much like the Jim Crow laws found lingering on the books in Southern states some fifty-seven years after the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.&quot; The restriction had also been rejected in a U.S. district court in 2017.

==Family==
Smith is married to Bobbie Gail Smith, a full-blooded Cherokee from the Rocky Mountain community of Adair County, Oklahoma.

<doc id="764446" wikidata="Q1339464" url="?curid=764446" title="Sacoglossa">
<text>Sacoglossa are a superorder of small sea slugs and sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks that belong to the clade Heterobranchia known as sacoglossans. There are 284 valid species recognized within this superorder. Sacoglossans live by ingesting the cellular contents of algae, hence they are sometimes called &quot;sap-sucking sea slugs&quot;. Some sacoglossans simply digest the fluid which they suck from the algae, but in some other species, the slugs sequester and use within their own tissues living chloroplasts from the algae they eat, a very unusual phenomenon known as kleptoplasty, for the &quot;stolen&quot; plastids. This earns them the title of the &quot;solar-powered sea slugs&quot;, and makes them unique among metazoan organisms, for otherwise kleptoplasty is known only among other euthyneurans and single-celled protists.

The Sacoglossa are divided into two clades - the shelled families (Oxynoacea) and the shell-less families (Plakobranchacea). 
The four families of shelled species are Cylindrobullidae, Volvatellidae, Oxynoidae, and Juliidae, the bivalved gastropods. The shell-less Plakobranchacea are grouped in six families, divided between two clades (&quot;superfamilies&quot;), the Plakobranchoidea and the Limapontioidea. All sacoglossans are distinguished from related groups by the presence of a single row of teeth on the radula. The teeth are adapted for the suctorial feeding habits of the group.

== Appearance ==
Many of these gastropods (e.g. &quot;Elysia&quot; spp.) resemble winged slugs with a pair of cephalic tentacles. In photosynthetic members of the group, the wings, or parapodia, can be unfurled to maximise the area of the organism that is struck by sunlight. In others (e.g. &quot;Placida&quot; spp.), cylindrical cerata extend from the dorsal surface. The majority of sacoglossans are 1–3 cm in length; they are typically uniform in color because the chloroplasts they ingest end up installed in their own cells.

== Distribution ==
Sacoglossa species are found worldwide in tropical and temperate oceans, but most live in the central Pacific Ocean, where they frequent the shorelines of tropical islands; diverse tracts of species are also known in the Caribbean and Indo-Pacific. These three areas have distinct ranges of species, indicating a high degree of biogeographic separation. Where sacoglossans are present further from the equator, in places such as Australia or Japan, diversity is lower, and the species present are typically tropical species that have a higher tolerance for temperature variation. Their temperate distribution closely corresponds to the distribution of their important food source, &quot;Caulerpa&quot; spp. They typically live at very low population densities, making scientific study of the group difficult.

== Use of ingested cellular material ==

The sacoglossans can use the chloroplasts of the algae on which they feed, which they keep alive for hours to months after their ingestion. They maintain the cells and metabolise the photosynthetic products; this process is termed kleptoplasty, and the sacoglossans are the only animals to employ it; some ciliates and foraminifera (protists) also employ the strategy. Sacoglossans have been known to survive for months living solely on the photosynthetic products of their acquired plastids. This process is somewhat mystifying, as the upkeep of chloroplasts usually requires interaction with genes encoded in the plant cell nucleus. This seems to suggest that the genes have been laterally transferred from algae to the animals. DNA amplification experiments on &quot;Elysia chlorotica&quot; adults and eggs using &quot;Vaucheria litorea&quot; derived primers revealed the presence of psbO, an algal nuclear gene. These results were likely an artefact, as most recent results based on transcriptomic analysis and sequencing of genomic DNA from the slug&#x27;s eggs reject the hypothesis that lateral gene transfer supports kleptoplast longevity. Sacoglossans are able to choose which method of feeding they use. The switch from active feeding to photosynthesis in sacoglossans is triggered by the shortage of food resources, and typically not preferred. If food is readily available, the animal will actively consume it. Starvation periods (with photosynthesis and no active feeding) vary between species of sacoglossans from less than a week to over four months, and photosynthesis is used as a last-resort mechanism to avoid mortality. Another unclear step in the process is how the chloroplasts are protected from digestion, and how they adapt to their new position in animal cells without the membranes that would control their environment in the algae.
However it is achieved, kleptoplasty is an important strategy for many genera of Placobranchacea. One species of &quot;Elysia&quot; feeds on a seasonally calcifying alga. Because it is unable to penetrate the calcified cell walls, the animal can only feed for part of the year, relying on the ingested chloroplasts to survive whilst the foodstuff is calcified, until later in the season when the calcification is lost and the grazing can continue.

Sacoglossans can also use antiherbivory compounds produced by their algal foodstuffs to deter their own would-be predators, in a process termed kleptochemistry. This may be achieved by converting algal metabolites to toxins, or by using algal pigments for camouflage in a process termed nutritional homochromy.

== Oxynoacea ==
Around 20% of sacoglossan species bear a shell. The Oxynoacea contains three shelled families, and all feed solely on algae of the genus &quot;Caulerpa&quot;. None of these organisms benefits from the photosynthesis of the ingested chloroplasts, but the chloroplasts may have been retained to perform a camouflaging function. The shells of the Volvatellidae and Oxynoidae somewhat resemble those of the cephalaspid bubble snails. The Juliidae are extraordinary in that they are shelled, bivalved gastropods. They have a shell in two pieces, which resemble the valves of a minute clam. Living members of this family have been known since 1959, and had previously only been known to science as fossils (which had been interpreted as bivalves).

== Plakobranchoidea ==
The majority of sacoglossans are shell-less, consequently, the Plakobranchoidea are commonly described using the vernacular term &quot;sea slugs&quot;, which can lead to their confusion with the only very distantly related nudibranchs. However, the plakobranchoid &quot;Elysia&quot; (and undoubtedly others) do develop a shell before hatching from their egg. Indeed, at least the Elysiidae, Limapontiidae, and Hermaeidae all bear larval shells, which are spiral, and possess between three-quarters and one complete whorl.

The plakobranchoids have a more diverse feeding range than the Oxynoacea, feeding on a wider range of green (and sometimes red) algae, and even, in three cases, being carnivorous.

== Evolution ==
The ancestor of the Sacoglossa is presumed to have fed on a now-extinct calcifying green alga in the Udoteaceae. The first fossil evidence of the group comes from bivalved shells dating to the Eocene, and further bivalved shells are known from later geological periods, although the thin nature of the shells and their high-erosion habitat usually make for poor preservation. The corresponding fossil record of algae points to an origin of the group deeper in time, perhaps as early as the Jurassic or Cretaceous.

The loss of the shell, which was apparently a single evolutionary event, opened up a new ecological avenue for the clade, as the chloroplasts of the green algae on which they fed could now be retained and used as functioning chloroplasts, which could generate energy by photosynthesis.

== Taxonomy ==
The suborder name comes from the Greek words &quot;sákos&quot; &quot;shield&quot; and &quot;glóssa&quot; &quot;tongue&quot; because the species have single toothed radulas.

=== 2005 taxonomy ===
In the taxonomy of Bouchet &amp; Rocroi (2005), the clade Sacoglossa is arranged as follows:
*Subclade Oxynoacea
**Superfamily Oxynooidea: family Oxynoidae, family Juliidae, family Volvatellidae
*Subclade Plakobranchacea
**Superfamily Plakobranchoidea: family Plakobranchidae, family Boselliidae, family Platyhedylidae,
**Superfamily Limapontioidea: family Limapontiidae, family Caliphyllidae, family Hermaeidae

In this taxonomy, the family Elysiidae is considered a synonym of the family Placobranchidae , and the families Oleidae and Stiligeridae are synonyms of the family Limapontiidae .

The family Cylindrobullidae belongs to the superfamily Cylindrobulloidea in the sister &quot;group&quot; Cylindrobullida.

=== 2010 taxonomy ===
Jörger et al. (2010) moved Sacoglossa into the Panpulmonata.

A molecular phylogeny analysis by Maeda et al. (2010) confirmed the placement of &quot;Cylindrobulla&quot; within the Sacoglossa.

=== 2017 taxonomy ===
Bouchet et al. (2017) moved Sacoglossa from Panpulmonata to the subterclass Tectipleura.

== Autotomy ==
Extreme autotomy has been observed on two species, &quot;Elysia marginata&quot; and &quot;E. atroviridis&quot;, studied &quot;in vitro&quot;. Over the course of the study, some individuals decapitated themselves, a behavior known as autotomy. The neck wound usually closed within one day, and the heads, especially in younger specimens, began to feed on algae within hours. Twenty days later, an entirely new body had regrown, while the discarded bodies never regrew heads.
In &quot;E. atroviridis&quot;, three of 82 studied individuals autotomized, and two of the three eventually grew new bodies. All of these animals were infected with small crustaceans known as copepods. In another group of 64 without parasites, none self-decapitated, leading the researchers to hypothesize that animals cast off their bodies as a means to get rid of parasites.
Another possibility is that the slugs autotomized to escape predators, but when the researchers tried to mimic an enemy&#x27;s attack by pinching and cutting the creatures, none cast off their bodies. The process itself takes several hours, which the scientists say would make it ineffective as means of escape.

How the slugs survive without a heart and other vital organs for nearly a month remains a mystery. Mitoh and her colleagues suspect it may be tied to their ability to survive using the photosynthetic algae in their diet while other energy sources are unavailable.

<text>Kilfenora ( , meaning &#x27;Church of the Fertile Hillside&#x27; or &#x27;Church of the White Brow&#x27;) is a village and a civil parish in County Clare, Ireland. It is situated south of the karst limestone region known as the Burren. Since medieval times when it was the episcopal see of the Bishop of Kilfenora, it has been known as the &quot;City of the Crosses&quot; for its seven (now five) high crosses. The village had around 220 inhabitants in 2011. Much of the TV show &quot;Father Ted&quot; (1995–98) was filmed there.

==Name==
&quot;Cill Fhionnúrach&quot; is generally translated as &quot;Church of the Fertile Hillside&quot;, &quot;Church of the White Brow&quot; or &quot;Church of the White Meadow&quot;. The village and diocese of Kilfenora have also been referred to as Fenebore, Kilfenoragh, Finneborensis or Collumabrach.

==Village==

According to the Census of 2011, 463 people lived in the Kilfenora area, up from 409 in 2006. However, most of them do not live inside the village. In 2011, there were just 220 inhabitants in the village proper, up from 169 in 2006 and only around 100 in 1980. In 1975 the &quot;Burren Display Centre&quot;, an interpretative centre displaying the botany and wildlife of The Burren, in the former National School building, was opened by president Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh. It was the first interpretative centre in Ireland and was built with funds from Fáilte Ireland and the Clare County Council.

The TV show &quot;Father Ted&quot; (1995–98) used Kilfenora as an important filming location. This later gave rise to a &quot;Father Ted Festival&quot;, first held in 2007. Kilfenora also gave its name to the Kilfenora Ceili Band.

===Kilfenora Cathedral===


Kilfenora Cathedral is dedicated to St. Fachtna (St. Fachanan) and the present structure dates to between 1189 and 1200. It was built in the so-called transitional style with a nave and a chancel. These were later separated and by 1839, &quot;thirty-six feet of the east end&quot; were roofless.

The nave is now used for worship by the Church of Ireland, for which it was reconstructed around 1850. It features a bishop&#x27;s throne, donated in 1981. There is also a large square stone baptismal font (possibly from around 1200). In addition, the church contains various tombs, but the interior is mostly devoid of ornamentation.

According to local tradition, the chancel was roofed with an oak ceiling (blue with a gold star) until the end of the 18th century. It is roofless today and features a 15th-century doorway, a 15th-century Gothic sedilia as well as a Romanesque three-light east window with its triangular pillars topped by carved capitals. On both sides of the window is a carved effigy: a bishop with his right hand raised in blessing (possibly early 14th century), to the north; and a tonsured, bareheaded cleric holding a book (possibly 13th century) to the south. The chancel also contains several tombs and the remains of high crosses.

The &quot;Lady Chapel&quot; (sacristy or chapter room) was in a rectangular wing leading to the north of the chancel. It likely shares the building date of the main building and may have served as a sort of transept in the past. Two lancet-type windows and a broken two-light one are left in the eastern wall. There are also fragments of a high cross.

Today, the cathedral remains in a partially ruined state, although restoration work was done by the National Monument Service in the early 2000s. The transept was fitted with a glass roof in 2005 to protect the remains of the three high crosses moved there.

Although tradition maintains that there were once seven crosses, only the remains of five of them were extant in modern times (plus one from post-reformation times). Three of those, including the one known as the &quot;Doorty Cross&quot;, were located within the graveyard of the cathedral. The Doorty Cross is so named because its shaft was used as the tombstone of the Doorty family grave until the 1950s when the two parts of this mid-12th century cross were reunited. A shaft of a 13th- or 14th-century cross stood near the doorway of the cathedral (the &quot;South Cross&quot;). Near the graveyard, gate was a simple cross (possibly dating from the 14th or 15th century). The third cross is located within the chancel. West of the graveyard and roughly halfway between the cathedral and the modern Catholic church is the fourth high cross (the &quot;High Cross&quot;), standing in a field. The fifth cross (&quot;Cross on the Hill&quot;) was removed in 1821, by Dr Richard Mant, Bishop of Kilfenora and Killaloe, to Killaloe, County Clare where it is still on display at St. Flannan&#x27;s Cathedral and known as the &quot;Kilfenora High Cross&quot;.

In 2003, three high crosses from the site were removed for conservation by the Office of Public Works and from 2005 have been on display in the transept of the cathedral; amongst them the &quot;Doorty Cross&quot;.

===Other antiquities===
The ruins of Ballyshanny Castle are located in the eponymous townland, around 600 meters from the village. It was built in a ringfort and was originally an O&#x27;Brien castle. In 1631 it was owned by Daniel O&#x27;Shanny, Dean of Kilfenora. Remains of two upper floors and a vaulted lower floor are still extant.

To the west of Ballyshanny, in Ballykeel South townland, lie the outhouses of the Ballykeel estate, one of the few &quot;big houses&quot; in northwestern Clare. It was originally built by George Lysaght of Woodmount, Ennistymon in the late 18th century. It was replaced in the early 19th century by the Blake Foster family with a classical house of cut stone with a central bow.

A large ring fort surrounded by &quot;chevaux de frise&quot; in Ballykinvarga townland is named after the townland. The fort itself has a diameter of over 50 meters but has not been conclusively dated. Due to its size it has been considered the likely seat of a regional &quot;cattle baron&quot;, and was described in detail by antiquarian Thomas Johnson Westropp in 1897.

===Burren Centre===
The former Burren Display Centre today provides an updated exhibition on the Burren, a film, tea rooms and a craft store.

==Civil parish==
Kilfenora civil parish is on the east side of barony of Corcomroe. The parish is and covers . In 1845, the &quot;Parliamentary Gazette&quot; reported that about one-half of the surface is prime fattening-ground; about one-fourth is excellent rearing and tillage-land; and the remainder is mountain and bog, but only to a small extent unprofitable. The land, while of good quality, is also better cultivated than that of the adjacent districts on the south.

===Townlands===
This is a list of townlands in the parish: Ballagh, Ballybaun, Ballybreen, Ballyclancahill, Ballygoonaun, Ballyhomulta, Ballykeel North, Ballykeel South, Ballykinvarga, Ballyshanny, Boghil, Caherminnaun East, Caherminnaun West, Clogher, Clooneen, Cloonomra, Cohy, Commonage, Coolpeekaun, Creggaun, Doon, Fanta Glebe, Kilcarragh, Kilfenora, Laraghakea, Lickeen East, Lickeen West, Lisdoony East, Lisdoony West, Lisket, Maryville, Roughan, Slievenagry, Tullagh Lower and Tullagh Upper.

===History===

Kilfenora is &quot;one of the oldest urban settlements&quot; in County Clare. According to tradition, the ecclesial presence at Kilfenora began with Saint Fachanan, who founded a church here in the 6th century. The first building was probably made of wood and followed by a stone construction. That church was burned down in 1055 by Murchad O&#x27;Brien. It was rebuilt between 1056 and 1058, only to be plundered in 1079 and then destroyed by an accidental fire in 1100. In 1152, the Synod of Kells changed the status of the ecclesial settlement here from monastic to diocesan. The diocese corresponded with the ancient territory of Corcomroe.

Part of the Archdiocese of Cashel, it only extended over 200 square miles of very thinly populated land. It was reckoned the poorest diocese, with only 13 parishes. Demand for the position of bishop thus was not great, but for 1189 a bishop is recorded. In 1660, Samuel Pullen was made Archbishop of Tuam and Kilfenora became part of his province.

Kilfenora was the site of the largest fair in north Clare, held here on 9 October from late mediaeval times until the early 19th century. Of this an old paying stand is still extant next to the field known as &quot;Fair Green&quot; east of the R476 road.

The last Bishop of Kilfenora in the succession of the Roman Catholic Church was James Augustine O&#x27;Daly (d. 1749). In 1750, the diocese was united with Kilmacduagh. In 1883 &quot;Kilfenora and Kilmacduagh&quot; was again merged with the diocese of Galway. Today, the bishops of Galway and Kilmacduagh are styled &quot;Bishop of Galway and Kilmacduagh and Apostolic Administrator of Kilfenora&quot;; while the bishop administers the diocese, in Canon Law, the ordinary of the diocese is the Pope.

In the Church of Ireland, Kilfenora was merged in turn with the dioceses of Limerick (1606–07), Tuam (1617-1742), Clonfert (1742-1752), Killaloe (1752-1976) and again Limerick (since 1976).

From the late 17th century Kilfenora went into decline and the Catholic population suffered under the Penal Laws. Attempts by the clergy to support their parishioners led to confrontations with the temporal authorities. In 1712, the High Sheriff of Clare ordered the arrest of the entire clergy at Kilfenora on the suspicion of turning a blind eye to the laming of landowner cattle by malcontents. After the 1798 uprising, a local priest, Father Charles Carrick was briefly jailed for supporting the rebels.

By 1837, Samuel Lewis described Kilfenora as &quot;a decayed market town&quot; of 558 people, linked by a new road to Lisdoonvarna and Ennistymon. After the West Clare Railway in 1887 connected Ennistymon, but not Kilfenora, to the rest of the country by rail, the latter&#x27;s decline into a backwater was hastened. As of 1841, the population of the parish was 3,266 in 522 houses.

In 1942, a survey by the Irish Tourist Association found that the town had 100 inhabitants and &quot;seven public houses, ten groceries, a Post Office, a Guard&#x27;s Barracks [and] a National School&quot;. It also noted that around 60 men were employed by a phosphate mine and that Kilfenora was &quot;a very important village for cattle and sheep fairs&quot;.

==Ecclesiastical parish==
===Protestant Parish===
In 1837, the nave portion of the cathedral was adopted for use as the Protestant parish church for Kilfenora. It is still used for occasional worship.

===Catholic Parish===

In the Roman Catholic Church, the ecclesiastical parish is merged with the civil parish of Kiltoraght. There are two churches in this parish: St. Fachtna&#x27;s (in Kilfenora) and St Attracta&#x27;s (Kiltoraght).

<text>USS &quot;Chosin&quot; (CG-65) is a guided-missile cruiser serving in the United States Navy. She is named in honor of the Battle of Chosin Reservoir of the Korean War. Commissioned in 1991, she is currently serving in the Pacific Fleet, based at Naval Base San Diego. The cruiser has participated in Operation Southern Watch, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. She is the first US Navy ship to bear this name.

== Operational history ==
In March 2003, &quot;Chosin&quot; was assigned to Cruiser-Destroyer Group One.

In April 2008, &quot;Chosin&quot; failed her Board of Inspection and Survey (InSurv) examination and was judged &quot;unfit for sustained combat operations.&quot; In spring of 2008, &quot;Chosin&quot; had received replacement gun barrels for both of her 5-inch guns.

On 6 November 2009, &quot;Chosin&quot; assumed the role as flagship for the counter-piracy task force Combined Task Force 151. On 17 November 2009, &quot;Chosin&quot; rescued three stranded Yemeni fishermen in the Gulf of Aden. According to the fishermen, they were left stranded in the water after 12 suspected Somali pirates hijacked their vessel. The fishermen also said that the pirates gave them an ultimatum to either jump overboard with only a wooden plank as a flotation device or be killed. &quot;Chosin&quot; medical personnel treated the fishermen and gave them food and water. Once the fishermen were deemed to be medically stable, &quot;Chosin&quot; transferred the fishermen to a Yemen Navy vessel.

In April 2013, &quot;Chosin&quot; passed its Board of Inspection and Survey (InSurv). On 30 April 2013, &quot;Chosin&quot; departed her home port of Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam (JBPHH) for a scheduled Western Pacific deployment. While deployed, &quot;Chosin&quot; was scheduled to conduct theater security operations with partner nations while providing deterrence, promoting peace and security, preserving freedom of the seas and providing humanitarian assistance/disaster response. In October 2013, the cruiser participated in the International Fleet Review 2013 in Sydney, Australia.

In February 2014, &quot;Chosin&quot; dispatched supplies via helicopter to Royal Canadian Navy ship after a severe engine room fire left her dead in the water about off the coast of Hawaii. For providing assistance to &quot;Protecteur&quot;, the Canadian government awarded &quot;Chosin&quot; a Canadian Forces&#x27; Unit Commendation.

In June 2016, &quot;Chosin&quot;″s homeport was changed to San Diego.

In October 2019 it was announced that &quot;Chosin&quot; would be shifting to Seattle, WA, to complete a depot-level modernization period at Vigor Marine&#x27;s Harbor Island facility starting in December 2019. &quot;Chosin&quot; arrived in Seattle in February, 2020.

In February 2023, Vigor completed modernization of &quot;Chosin&quot; and she returned to her homeport in San Diego. The Navy is seeking to decommission the ship in FY2027.

In October 2024 the Navy announced a successful test aboard &quot;Chosin&quot; of a Transferable Rearming Mechanism (TRAM) to reload a ship&#x27;s vertical launch system while at sea rather than in a port.

<doc id="764454" wikidata="Q3569403" url="?curid=764454" title="Winter Garden Theatre">
<text>The Winter Garden Theatre is a Broadway theatre at 1634 Broadway in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City, United States. Originally designed by architect William Albert Swasey, it opened in 1911. The Winter Garden&#x27;s current design dates to 1922, when it was completely remodeled by Herbert J. Krapp. Due to the size of its auditorium, stage, and backstage facilities, it is favored for large musical productions. It has 1,600 seats and is operated by The Shubert Organization. The auditorium interior is a New York City landmark.

The Winter Garden Theatre was adapted from the old building of the American Horse Exchange, completed in 1896. Its original façade consisted of several arches on Broadway, which were subsequently converted to a brick wall with a large sign. The interior is covered with detailing in the Adam style. Though the auditorium contains a single balcony above the orchestra level, the boxes are arranged in two levels above the orchestra. The auditorium contains a ribbed ceiling, which originally had exposed trusses prior to Krapp&#x27;s renovation. The proscenium and stage also date to Krapp&#x27;s renovation, when they were scaled down from their original size.

The Winter Garden was originally operated by brothers Lee and Jacob J. Shubert. In its early days, the theater frequently hosted series of revues presented under the umbrella titles &quot;The Passing Show&quot;, &quot;Artists and Models&quot;, and the &quot;Greenwich Village Follies&quot;. The Winter Garden served as a Warner Bros. movie house from 1928 to 1933 and a United Artists cinema from 1945 to 1948. Aside from these interruptions, it has largely operated as a legitimate theater. From 1982 to 2013, the Winter Garden hosted only two productions: the musicals &quot;Cats&quot; and &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;. The theater was renovated in 2000 and was known as the Cadillac Winter Garden Theatre from 2002 to 2007.

==Site==
The Winter Garden Theatre is on 1634 Broadway, near Times Square, in the Theater District of Midtown Manhattan in New York City, United States. The land lot takes up much of the city block bounded by Broadway to the west, 50th Street to the south, Seventh Avenue to the east, and 51st Street to the north. The lot covers , with a frontage of on Broadway, on 50th Street, and on Seventh Avenue. Nearby buildings include the Mark Hellinger Theatre (Times Square Church) to the northwest; Axa Equitable Center to the northeast; The Michelangelo to the east; The Theater Center, Brill Building, and Ambassador Theatre to the southwest; and Paramount Plaza to the west. An entrance to the New York City Subway&#x27;s 50th Street station, serving the , is just south of the theater&#x27;s Broadway entrance.

=== Previous building ===
In the late 19th century, what is now Times Square was known as Longacre Square and was heavily frequented by the horse and carriage industry. The site of the Winter Garden Theatre was originally occupied by the American Horse Exchange, which was built by William K. Vanderbilt. The Horse Exchange, on the east side of Broadway between 50th and 51st Streets, was designed by D. &amp; J. Jardine. The exchange sold thoroughbreds at a time when bad horses were commonly being offered. Though the first sale took place in 1880, the Horse Exchange was not completed until the next year.

The original exchange building was a two- and three-story structure covered three-quarters on the block, surrounding a covered horse ring measuring square. The Broadway wing had dealers&#x27; offices on the first floor and the exchange&#x27;s offices on the second floor, as well as space for carriages and valuable horses. The 50th Street and Seventh Avenue wings had horses on each floor, with 187 box stalls total. The exchange burned down in June 1896, killing close to a hundred horses. After the exchange was destroyed, Vanderbilt hired A. V. Porter to construct a new structure of two to four stories. The new building surrounded a covered ring measuring . The new structure reused some of the old exchange&#x27;s walls and had a brick facade with arched windows, as well as trusses over the ring.

==Design==
The Winter Garden Theatre&#x27;s building was adapted from the rebuilt American Horse Exchange. In 1911 the Shubert family leased the building and architect William Albert Swasey redesigned the building as a theater. The Winter Garden was completely remodeled in 1922 by Herbert J. Krapp. The theater is still operated by the Shubert Organization.

===Facade===

As designed, the main entrance was on Broadway and there were ten exits on Seventh Avenue. The Broadway facade was designed in a colonial style with plain gray stone. The original exterior used much of the existing facade of the Horse Exchange, though a cupola was added in the modification, as well as a heavy cornice. The facade had five Palladian-style arches and columns. The columns rose two stories, supporting a cornice and a pediment. Five mahogany doors led to the ticket lobby. The modern facade has large billboards, which have historically been used to advertise the shows at the Winter Garden. The billboards date to at least the 1930s.

The Seventh Avenue facade, originally unornamented, was decorated in the 1922 renovation because of the growing prominence of that avenue. Because of the number of exits to the surrounding streets, &quot;Architecture and Building&quot; magazine wrote in 1911 that the theater &quot;is said to have more exits than any other auditorium of its size in the United States&quot;. A portion of the old American Horse Exchange facade was visible on Seventh Avenue until the late 1990s, when it was refaced in brick.

The theater&#x27;s relatively small entrance on Broadway allowed the Shubert family to place storefronts along the rest of the Broadway frontage. The corner of Broadway and 50th Street was leased out as an eatery. It was originally designed as a restaurant space in the Flemish style. Over the years, it became a nightclub known as Palais de Danse, Montmartre, and Singapore.

=== Lobbies ===
The ticket office is just inside the Broadway entrance. It leads to a rectangular inner lobby . The inner lobby is a rectangular space, with doors on the west and east walls. The walls contain panels with foliate decorations in the Adam style. These are separated by Adam-style pilasters, topped by Corinthian-style capitals. The west doors lead to the ticket lobby and are made of bronze. The east doors lead to the auditorium and are made of bronze with glass frames; these doors are separated by pilasters that hold up an arched entablature. The walls also have lighting sconces. The lobby&#x27;s ceiling contains Adam-style bands that split the ceiling into Adam-style quadrilateral panels. Adjoining the inner lobby was a smoking room, measuring , with an attached men&#x27;s restroom. There was also a bar and a service room.

=== Auditorium ===

The auditorium has an orchestra level; two levels of boxes above the orchestra; one balcony; and a stage behind the proscenium arch. The auditorium&#x27;s width is greater than its depth, and the space is designed with plaster decorations in high relief. According to the Shubert Organization, the auditorium has 1,600 seats; however, &quot;Playbill&quot; gives a different figure of 1,493 seats and The Broadway League cites 1,526 seats. There are 1,045 seats in the orchestra, 486 on the balcony, 36 in the boxes, and 33 standing-only spots. In its original configuration, the Winter Garden had 1,200 seats at orchestra level and 400 at balcony level. In addition, the original theater had 150 box seats.

The original decorative elements were designed by John Wanamaker. The theater was initially designed with latticework rather than Adam-style detailing, since latticework was commonly used as a design motif in Broadway theaters of the 1910s. The theater&#x27;s name, as well as its original design, was meant to evoke an English garden.

==== Seating areas ====
The orchestra floor is raked. The rear (north) end of the orchestra contains a shallow promenade, which wraps around to the auditorium&#x27;s sides. Pilasters with Corinthian capitals divide the promenade&#x27;s rear wall into sections, and a cornice with dentils and modillions also runs along the wall, above the pilasters. The promenade is separated from the orchestra seating by a row of columns, also topped by Corinthian capitals. The orchestra promenade&#x27;s coved ceiling is divided by Adam-style bands with foliate decorations. Each cove has circular decorative elements at their centers, which contain coffers and swags. The promenade forms part of a &quot;grand promenade&quot; connecting Broadway and Seventh Avenue. A standing rail is placed behind the rearmost row of seats. The orchestra level previously had 12 boxes extending along the sides of the auditorium. The walls originally contained latticework, behind which were lights. One architectural critic said that the rake of the orchestra &quot;makes for poor visibility from most locations&quot; due to its shallowness.

The balcony level is also raked; the front section contains several curves, which resemble the curves of boxes. The rear of the balcony level contains a promenade, which starts behind the center of the balcony and extends around to either side. This promenade was originally designed as a foyer measuring , which had balconies overlooking Broadway. Columns separate the promenade from the balcony seating areas. The front railing of the balcony is decorated with molded bands, swags, and foliate ornament. There are lighting fixtures and other equipment in front of the railing. The underside of the balcony has Adam-style bands with foliate decorations, as well as air-conditioning vents.

On either side of the stage is an outwardly splayed wall section with boxes at the balcony level and directly above the balcony. Both levels have three boxes on either side, which are curved outward. The fronts of the boxes have similar molded bands, swags, and foliate ornament as the balcony&#x27;s front. In addition, the centers of the boxes have rosettes and oval panels. Pilasters with Adam-style decoration, running the full height of the auditorium, flank the boxes&#x27; wall sections. Each of the boxes&#x27; pilasters is topped by a Corinthian capital. There are griffin motifs and cartouches above the higher level of boxes. The present boxes and pilasters date from the 1923 renovation. The original design had only one level of boxes, which was at the balcony level. In the original design, the entire balcony front was occupied by a row of 21 boxes, and the wall sections on each side had two large party boxes, for a total of 25 boxes.

==== Other design features ====
The proscenium arch measures high and wide. It consists of a wide, molded band with foliated swags, rosettes, and molded figures. There are medallions within the spandrels at the corners of the arch. The present size and design of the proscenium arch dates to the 1922 renovation; an inner arch and drapes were installed to artificially reduce the original arch&#x27;s size. In the proscenium&#x27;s original configuration, it measured high and about wide. A sounding board curves onto the ceiling above the proscenium. It contains a panel that shows dancing and music-playing figures in a forest. These figures are surrounded by an Adam-style foliate band. The panel measures and is titled &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

The depth of the auditorium to the proscenium is , while the depth to the front of the stage is . When the theater originally opened, the stage had a semicircular apron with a radius, as well as a runway. The runway, added in 1912, was intended to bring the performers much closer to the audience. The apron and runway were removed in the 1922 renovation, and seats were added in their place. The dressing rooms were placed in a separate structure directly behind the stage, separated from the auditorium by brick walls. There is an orchestra pit in front of and below the stage.

The modern ceiling contains vaults, placed between ribs that are designed in the Adam style. The vaults themselves are divided into panels by Adam-style moldings and bands. The center of the ceiling contains a panel with a dome, surrounded by latticework and foliate decoration. At each of the dome&#x27;s four corners, there are medallions, which depict mythical fauns playing lyres and pipes. In the theater&#x27;s original design, the ceiling trusses remained exposed, a vestige of the old Horse Exchange. The ceiling was finished in wooden latticework, and the ceiling was painted blue, giving an impression of an open-air venue. The original ceiling had poor acoustics. During the 1922 renovation, Krapp had lowered the ceiling to below the trusses.

== History ==
Times Square became the epicenter for large-scale theater productions between 1900 and the Great Depression. Manhattan&#x27;s theater district had begun to shift from Union Square and Madison Square during the first decade of the 20th century. From 1901 to 1920, forty-three theaters were built around Broadway in Midtown Manhattan. The Winter Garden Theatre was predated by an earlier theater of the same name, which opened in 1850 and was further downtown, at Broadway and Bond Street. The current Winter Garden was developed by the Shubert brothers of Syracuse, New York, who expanded downstate into New York City in the first decade of the 20th century. After the death of Sam S. Shubert in 1905, his brothers Lee and Jacob J. Shubert expanded their theatrical operations significantly. The brothers controlled a quarter of all plays and three-quarters of theatrical ticket sales in the U.S. by 1925.

===Development and early years===

==== Conversion of Horse Exchange ====

Both Sam and Lee Shubert had prevented Jacob from taking a full role in the operation of the Shubert syndicate, and Lee had often sent Jacob to oversee productions outside New York City after Sam died. This prompted Jacob to develop his own theater; he subsequently recalled that, while walking up Broadway in early 1910, he looked at the Horse Exchange. Though the exchange was far north of the established Broadway theater district at the time, the raked balcony above the horse-auction ring appealed to Jacob, even after he learned that Vanderbilt was the landlord. With the horse transportation declining in favor of automobiles, Vanderbilt leased the Horse Exchange site to the Shuberts in 1910. While Vanderbilt did not want to sell, he was willing to lease the site for 40 years at an annual fee of $40,000.

The plans for the Winter Garden itself dated to December 1909, when producer Lew Fields, a close associate of Lee Shubert, was planning a music hall-style venue. Despite Fields&#x27;s greater expertise, Jacob Shubert had a greater advantage; because of large expenditures, Fields became indebted to Lee and ultimately became an employee of the Shuberts. In May 1910, the Shubert brother filed plans for a theater called Lew Fields&#x27; Winter Garden, which would be built on the Horse Exchange site at a cost of $500,000. William Albert Swasey would be the architect while John McKeefrey would be the builder. The Winter Garden was originally intended to host operas, ballets, dances, and other large performances, similar to variety and music halls.

During mid-1910, while Fields was on tour, Jacob changed many of Fields&#x27;s plans for the theater&#x27;s physical specifications. Jacob also sent harsh letters to Fields about the latter&#x27;s overspending, causing conflict between the two men. By the end of 1910, Fields had transferred his entire stake in the Winter Garden&#x27;s operation to the Shubert brothers. A factor in Fields&#x27;s withdrawal was Lee&#x27;s lack of intervention in the dispute, implicitly favoring his less experienced brother over his longtime partner. Although Lee controlled bookings and financing, Jacob was in charge of the Winter Garden&#x27;s operation. Jacob wanted the new theater to produce musical revues, in effect competing with the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; operated by Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. The Winter Garden was to be the flagship venue for the Shuberts&#x27; own productions.

==== 1910s and early 1920s ====
The Winter Garden was supposed to open at the beginning of March 1911, but ticket sales did not even begin until March 6 due to difficulties in scheduling productions. It opened on March 20, 1911, with the two-part musical &quot;La Belle Paree&quot;. The show featured the Broadway premiere of actor and singer Al Jolson. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the Winter Garden was &quot;New York&#x27;s latest plaything, a very flashy toy, full of life and go and color and with no end of jingle to it&quot;. Conversely, when flops were staged at the Winter Garden, critics said they could smell the horse stables. After &quot;La Belle Paree&quot; closed, the show &quot;Revue of Revues&quot;, featuring Gaby Deslys, opened in September 1911 and ran for two months. That November, the revue &quot;Vera Violetta&quot; opened, with numerous performers including Jolson, Deslys, and Mae West. In its early years, the Winter Garden hosted a successful series of concerts on Sunday nights, which featured performers such as Jolson. Jacob Shubert soon realized that Jolson was a major factor in the Winter Garden&#x27;s success.

While on a trip to Europe, Lee had met with German producer Max Reinhardt, who had pioneered the idea of a runway extending from a stage into the audience. Lee copied Reinhardt&#x27;s idea, adding a bridge above the orchestra seats. In early 1912, Jolson, Deslys, and Stella Mayhew starred in &quot;The Whirl of Society&quot;, the first show to use the Winter Garden&#x27;s runway. Jolson performed near the audience on the runway, as did 80 lightly clothed showgirls, leading the runway to be nicknamed the &quot;bridge of thighs&quot;. &quot;(From) Broadway to Paris&quot; premiered in November 1912, and Jolson, Deslys, and Fanny Brice appeared in &quot;The Honeymoon Express&quot; the next year. Jacob&#x27;s son, John Shubert, subsequently recalled that after &quot;The Honeymoon Express&quot;, Jolson returned to the Winter Garden once every 18 months on average. Jolson&#x27;s shows typically premiered early in the year, then went on tour after a summer break. These shows included &quot;Dancing Around&quot; (1914), &quot;Robinson Crusoe, Jr.&quot; (1916), &quot;Sinbad&quot; (1918), and &quot;Monte Cristo, Jr.&quot; (1919).

Though Jolson made the Winter Garden popular, the Shuberts had to fill the theater when Jolson was on tour. Jacob Shubert, who considered Florenz Ziegfeld as an adversary, rushed the production of his revue &quot;The Passing Show&quot; in mid-1912 after hearing that Ziegfeld was on vacation. The first edition of &quot;The Passing Show&quot; opened in July 1912. The series ran yearly through 1924, except for in 1920, when a specific edition for that year was not held. The series featured performers including Willie and Eugene Howard, Charlotte Greenwood, Marilyn Miller, Ed Wynn, Frank Fay, Fred and Adele Astaire, Marie Dressler, and Fred Allen. Jolson never appeared in any edition of &quot;The Passing Show&quot;, but the series nonetheless had notable acts such as Miller&#x27;s dancing debut in 1914. In addition to Jolson&#x27;s performances and &quot;The Passing Show&quot;, the Winter Garden hosted other musicals and revues. These included &quot;Cinderella on Broadway&quot; and the &quot;Broadway Brevities&quot; in 1920; &quot;The Whirl of New York&quot; in 1921; and &quot;Make It Snappy&quot; in 1922.

=== Renovation and intermittent theatrical use ===

==== 1920s ====
In November 1922, the Winter Garden was closed for a renovation. The work was intended to make the theater suitable &quot;more for revue than for extravaganza&quot;, as &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it. The proscenium arch was reduced in size and the ceiling was lowered under plans by Herbert Krapp. One hundred seats were installed in the former runway, and 50 boxes were added, 12 of them at orchestra level. Workers renovated the theater 24 hours a day, working in three shifts of eight hours. The theater&#x27;s decorative scheme was changed to gold and white, and mulberry-colored damask panels were installed to give a perception of intimacy. Smoking, which had been allowed in the theater&#x27;s early years, was banned after the 1922 renovation.

The theater reopened on January 24, 1923, with the revue &quot;The Dancing Girl&quot;, which was followed by that year&#x27;s edition of &quot;The Passing Show&quot;. The end of that year saw the first edition of another revue at the Winter Garden, the &quot;Greenwich Village Follies&quot;. The &quot;Greenwich Village Follies&quot; reappeared in 1924 and 1928, and the Winter Garden also hosted the &quot;Artists and Models&quot; revue in 1925 and 1927. In addition to these revues, the musical &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; was staged in 1924, followed by &quot;Big Boy&quot; in 1925, which was Al Jolson&#x27;s last live appearance at the Winter Garden. Also presented at the Winter Garden were &quot;Gay Paree&quot; (1925 and 1926), &quot;The Great Temptations&quot; (1926), and &quot;The Circus Princess&quot; (1927). Warner Bros. took over the Winter Garden Theatre in 1928 and used it as a cinema for the next five years. The first film shown was &quot;The Singing Fool&quot;, featuring Al Jolson, which was screened in September 1928.

==== 1930s and 1940s ====

Warner Bros. ended its lease in 1933. After the cinema lease was terminated, the first legitimate play to be presented was &quot;Hold Your Horses&quot;, which opened in September 1933. This was followed by the 1934 edition of the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;, to which the Shuberts had acquired the rights after Florenz Ziegfeld died. Another edition of the &quot;Follies&quot; was hosted in 1936. These two editions featured performers such as &quot;Passing Show&quot; stars Willie and Eugene Howard, as well as Eve Arden, Josephine Baker, Fanny Brice, Buddy Ebsen, Bob Hope, Gypsy Rose Lee, The Nicholas Brothers, Gertrude Niesen, and Jane Pickens. Between these performances, the Winter Garden staged &quot;Life Begins at 8:40&quot; in 1934, as well as &quot;Earl Carroll&#x27;s Sketch Book&quot; and &quot;At Home Abroad&quot; in 1935.

At the end of 1936, Vincente Minnelli staged &quot;The Show Is On&quot;, a popular revue with Bert Lahr and Beatrice Lillie. This was followed the next year by &quot;Hooray for What!&quot;, an antiwar musical. The late 1930s ended with a relatively short run of &quot;You Never Know&quot; in 1938. It was succeeded the same year by a much longer run of Olsen and Johnson&#x27;s revue &quot;Hellzapoppin&quot;, which had transferred from the 46th Street Theatre and ran until 1941. That year, the Shuberts staged &quot;Sons o&#x27; Fun&quot;, another Olsen and Johnson hit, which ran at the Winter Garden for over a year before transferring in 1943. The Winter Garden hosted the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; once again in 1943, with Milton Berle, Jack Cole, Ilona Massey, and Arthur Treacher. This edition of the &quot;Follies&quot; ran longer than any previous edition. This was followed in 1944 by Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Mexican Hayride&quot; and Olsen and Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Laffing Room Only&quot;.

After the operetta &quot;Marinka&quot; played in 1945, the Winter Garden again became a cinema for three years. United Artists started negotiating for the rights to use the Winter Garden for motion pictures in August 1945, but there were disputes over sound equipment. An agreement was reached later that month, with United Artists taking over that October. By the end of 1947, United Artists struggled to find films to screen, and it was paying $7,500 a week in rent. &quot;As the Girls Go&quot;, which opened in November 1948, was the first production to be staged after the Winter Garden again became a legitimate theater. The production, by Michael Todd, charged a top admission price of $7.20, which at the time was a record.

=== Dedicated theatrical use ===
==== 1950s to 1970s ====
Michael Todd staged &quot;Michael Todd&#x27;s Peep Show&quot;, a burlesque, in 1950. This was followed by the satire &quot;Top Banana&quot; in 1951, with Phil Silvers; the musical &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; in 1953, with Rosalind Russell; and a revival of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; in 1954. The 16th-century classic &quot;Tamburlaine The Great&quot; was staged at the Winter Garden in 1956. The Old Vic, a theater company from London, arrived the same year, presenting several Shakespeare plays. The last &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; at the Winter Garden was staged in 1957, featuring Beatrice Lillie and Billy De Wolfe, but it was not as successful as previous versions, closing after 123 performances. Later that year, the Winter Garden premiered the musical &quot;West Side Story&quot; featuring Carol Lawrence, with music by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim, the latter of whom was making his Broadway debut as a lyricist. The Winter Garden&#x27;s last productions of the 1950s were &quot;Juno&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot; in 1959.

&quot;West Side Story&quot; returned to the Winter Garden briefly in 1960, having transferred the previous year. This was followed later that year by &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot; with Tammy Grimes, which ran 732 performances. Eddie Fisher had a month-long engagement, &quot;Eddie Fisher at the Winter Garden&quot;, during late 1962. For much of the rest of the decade, the Winter Garden presented two hits. &quot;Funny Girl&quot;, with Barbra Streisand, opened in 1964 and ran for two years before transferring. It was followed by &quot;Mame&quot;, with Angela Lansbury and Bea Arthur, which opened in 1966 and ran for three years.

The first hit of the 1970s was Stephen Sondheim and James Goldman&#x27;s musical &quot;Follies&quot;, which opened in 1971. This was followed the next year by a revival of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, produced by the New York Shakespeare Festival and featuring Sam Waterston and Kathleen Widdoes. In addition, Neil Diamond performed a series of solo concerts in October 1972, and Liza Minnelli performed in a concert run in January 1974. A revival of the Sondheim musical &quot;Gypsy&quot;, featuring Lansbury, was staged later in 1974, and the Winter Garden hosted the 29th Tony Awards the following year. Yet another Sondheim musical, &quot;Pacific Overtures&quot;, was staged at the Winter Garden in 1976. It was followed the same year by a series of concerts by Natalie Cole, as well as a 167-performance run of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. The musical &quot;Beatlemania&quot; opened in 1977 and ran for two years, despite initial expectations of bad reviews.

==== 1980s and 1990s ====
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Winter Garden was used mostly for several minor shows and live appearances. This included &quot;Zoot Suit&quot; in early 1979, followed in June by Bruce Forsyth concerts and in August by Gilda Radner&#x27;s &quot;Live From New York&quot; appearances. Next to be staged, in 1980, was Twyla Tharp&#x27;s dance series. The musical &quot;42nd Street&quot; premiered later in 1980, though the opening of the musical coincided with the death of its director, Gower Champion. This was followed by &quot;Camelot&quot; in 1981 and a revival of &quot;Othello&quot; in 1982. During the 1980s, the Shuberts renovated the Winter Garden as part of a restoration program for their Broadway theaters.

Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s musical &quot;Cats&quot; had been booked for the Winter Garden in April 1982, with a premiere scheduled for that October. In mid-1982, the Shuberts closed the Winter Garden Theatre for a major renovation of both the exterior and the interior. The auditorium was gutted to accommodate the show&#x27;s junkyard setting, under the supervision of designer John Napier. In addition, the interior was painted black, as was the billboard outside. &quot;Cats&quot; opened on October 7, 1982, and quickly became successful, winning multiple Tony Awards. &quot;Cats&quot; became the longest-running Broadway show in history in June 1997, when it hit 6,138 performances. Ultimately, &quot;Cats&quot; ran 7,485 performances spanning nearly eighteen years.

The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) had started considering protecting the Winter Garden as an official city landmark in 1982, with discussions continuing over the next several years. Though both the exterior and interior were considered, the LPC designated only the interior as a landmark in January 1988. This was part of the LPC&#x27;s wide-ranging effort to grant landmark status to Broadway theaters, which had commenced in 1987. The New York City Board of Estimate ratified the designations in March 1988. The Shuberts, the Nederlanders, and Jujamcyn collectively sued the LPC in June 1988 to overturn the landmark designations of 22 theaters, including the Winter Garden, on the merit that the designations severely limited the extent to which the theaters could be modified. The lawsuit was escalated to the New York Supreme Court and the Supreme Court of the United States, but these designations were ultimately upheld in 1992.

==== 2000s to present ====

In 2000, the Shubert Organization and General Motors (GM) began discussions over a possible sponsorship, in which the Winter Garden could be rebranded for Cadillac, a division of GM. Early the same year, theatrical media announced that &quot;Cats&quot; would close that June, having played to more than 10 million guests and grossing over $380 million. &quot;Cats&quot; closed on September 10, 2000, and objects from the production were auctioned at the Winter Garden. Afterward, architect Francesca Russo restored the theater to its 1920s appearance. The $10 million project entailed restoring many of the architectural features that had been heavily modified for &quot;Cats&quot;, as well as restoring the lobby, lounges, seats, and ticket areas. Historical design features, such as light fixtures and plasterwork, were restored or replaced. The stage, which had been disassembled for the run of &quot;Cats&quot;, also had to be reconstructed.

&quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; was booked for the Winter Garden shortly after &quot;Cats&quot; closed, with a premiere in October 2001. Following the Shuberts&#x27; discussions with GM, the theater was renamed the Cadillac Winter Garden Theatre in May 2002. As part of a settlement with the United States Department of Justice in 2003, the Shuberts agreed to improve disabled access at their 16 landmarked Broadway theaters, including the Winter Garden. At the beginning of 2007, GM&#x27;s sponsorship ended and the venue returned to its original name. &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; was similarly long-running, transferring to the Broadhurst in 2013 to make way for &quot;Rocky the Musical&quot;. &quot;Rocky&quot; opened in 2014 and ran for 188 performances. This was followed in 2015 by a short run of &quot;Wolf Hall Parts One &amp; Two&quot;, as well as a much longer run of &quot;School of Rock&quot;, which closed in early 2019 after over 1,300 performances.
&quot;Beetlejuice&quot; opened in April 2019, but the Shuberts announced the same December that &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; would be relocated to make way for a revival of Meredith Willson&#x27;s &quot;The Music Man&quot;. All Broadway theaters temporarily closed on March 12, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; run, which had been scheduled to end that June, ended prematurely due to an extension of the COVID-19 closure. The musical eventually relocated to the Marquis Theatre in 2022. During its closure, a stagehand at the Winter Garden died after falling while taking down props for &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; in November 2020; the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the Shuberts as a result. The theater also hosted the 74th Tony Awards in September 2021. The Winter Garden reopened on December 20, 2021, with previews of &quot;The Music Man&quot;, which officially opened in February 2022. The production ran for 374 performances through January 2023. &quot;Back to the Future: The Musical&quot; opened at the theater in August 2023 and closed in January 2025 after 597 performances. This followed by the stage adaptation of the film &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot; in April 2025.

<doc id="764459" wikidata="Q2651046" url="?curid=764459" title="Tiger pistol shrimp">
<text>The tiger pistol shrimp (&quot;Alpheus bellulus&quot;) belongs to the Alpheidae family, known commonly as snapping shrimp.

The Alpheidae family is incredibly diverse with over 500 unique species across the world. &quot;Alpheus bellulus&quot; shares a translocation and inversion event of trnE in its mitogenome with several other Alpheus species but there is not enough evidence to say this is a shared commonality among the entire genus. Phylogeny suggests &quot;Alpheus randalli&quot; and &quot;Alpheus bellulus&quot; belong to the same taxon within a monophyletic group. Amino acid composition of the cytochrome b protein in &quot;A. bellulus&quot; was also similar to those of &quot;A.randali&quot; and &quot;A. lobidens&quot;, two other species of snapping shrimp.

==Description==
The tiger pistol shrimp can grow to a size up to 4 to 5 cm, not including antennae. The body is stout and opaque. The background color of the body is yellowish white or plain yellow. The patterns drawn on the cephalothorax, abdomen and tail are irregular but symmetric, their coloration varies from light brown, brownish purple to brownish orange. The legs are banded with the same colors as the body and are covered with short bristles. The antennae are red.
The chelipeds are also banded, with the right being bigger and modified into a powerful weapon. By closing at extreme speed, the cheliped expels an air bubble at more than towards the prey. This action is accompanied with a loud bang.

&quot;Alpheus bellulus&quot; use their oversized claws to produce powerful bubbles of air that stun its prey. Pressure builds up when the claw opens, and water enters a small chamber in the claw’s bend. The claw quickly clamps down and a small plunger pushes water out with high pressure, releasing a high-speed bubble. This powerful sonic weapon creates a violent shock wave which can kill or knock out prey, which could be another shrimp or a small fish passing close to the tiger pistol shrimp.
The sound emitted from the collapsing bubble can be up to 218 decibels, with a temperature of up to 4,800 degrees celsius, slightly cooler than the surface of the Sun.

==Distribution==
The tiger pistol shrimp can be found in tropical waters of the Indo-West Pacific area.

==Habitat==
The tiger pistol shrimp dwells in sandy, muddy and detrital substratum in shallow waters until 20 m.

The structure of the burrows made by &quot;A. bellulus&quot;, studied through resin casting, show the three-dimensional shape, and provide insight on the construction habits of the species.

&quot;A.bellulus&quot; rely on burrows for shelter and protection. In the beginning stage of construction, there is rapid growth in size and dimensions of the burrow. During this phase, &quot;A. bellulus&quot; shows no interest in feeding or resting, placing total priority in burrow formation. This characteristic is similar throughout many alpheid shrimp species. &quot;A. bellulus&quot; is highly vulnerable to predation without a burrow, especially during the initial stages of burrow development, due to their limited vision and dependence on tactile cues from partner gobiid fish.

Burrows are reinforced with small pieces of shell and coral along the sides, preventing collapse.  Sediment is constantly removed by &quot;A. bellulus&quot; to keep the internal burrow clean of settled deposits. Burrow production is also crucial to sediment cycling throughout the marine ecosystem, combining nutrients and debris along the seafloor.

==Feeding==
The tiger pistol shrimp is a carnivore, preying primarily on small invertebrates. It may also eat detritus and macroalgae, and will scavenge carcasses near its burrow. If it has formed a symbiotic relationship with a goby, the goby may bring it food. In aquaria, it is sometimes blamed for the death of fish, but it is very unlikely that it possesses the strength or willingness to attack fish for food. It can be fed many common foods given to aquarium shrimps, such as flakes, pellets, and most frozen foods, and will generally take prepared foods with no training required.

==Behaviour==
The tiger pistol shrimp lives in burrows in symbiosis with certain goby species such as &quot;Cryptocentrus cinctus&quot;, &quot;Amblyeleotris guttata&quot; or &quot;Stonogobiops yasha&quot;. The shrimp digs and maintains the burrows which are the dens for both animals, while the goby acts as a watchman, warning of danger the shrimp cannot see due to poor eyesight. Proven from a study, in an environment where goby fish and the tiger pistol shrimp are kept together, specifically in a tank, if there is no food source for the shrimp, the shrimp maintains its diet by consuming the feces of the goby fish from its burrow to survive. Hence, another example of their partnership.

The symbiotic relationship between snapping shrimp &quot;Alpheus bellulus&quot;, typically found off the coast of Japan, and the gobiid fish &quot;Amblyeleotris japonica&quot; begin from early stages of development, leading to the common existence of adult pairs. &quot;A. bellulus&quot; is not found in areas where this partner fish is absent and refrains from exiting the burrow while the partner fish is not near the entrance. &quot;A. bellulus&quot; stays in contact with the partner gobiid fish through its antennae and retreats into its burrow after noticeable movement from the fish. The gobiid fish, in return, use the burrows as a sheltering and nesting site. Given that both species are consistently found in tandem, neither species existing in high numbers without the other, it strongly suggests that their relationship is indispensable for the survival of both species.

Some burrows of &quot;A. bellulus&quot; were also found to be shared by a specific species of porcelain crab &quot;Enosteoides lobatus.&quot; In these observed burrows, &quot;E. lobatus&quot; stayed near the burrow&#x27;s entrance and followed warning signs from the gobiid fish, similar to the behaviour of &quot;A. bellulus. E. lobatus&quot; are filter feeders, benefiting from abundant food sources outside the burrows due to higher rates of detritus flow through water movement. However, seeking refuge within the burrows offers them greater protection from predators.

==In aquaria==
The tiger pistol shrimp is one of the most popular pistol shrimp in the marine aquarium hobby as it has a peaceful temperament, is inexpensive and does not require complicated care.

<text>The Defense Meritorious Service Medal (DMSM) is an award bestowed upon members of the United States military by the United States Department of Defense. In the order of precedence of the United States Armed Forces, it is worn between the Purple Heart and the Meritorious Service Medal. The medal is awarded in the name of the Secretary of Defense to members of the Armed Forces who, while serving in a joint activity, distinguish themselves by meritorious service, but not of a degree to warrant award of the Defense Superior Service Medal.

The medal is not the same as the Meritorious Service Medal, which is a separate federal military decoration. Both have virtually identical award criteria, but the DMSM is awarded to service members assigned to joint, multi-service organizations, while the MSM is awarded to service members in traditional military units within their respective individual services.

==Criteria==
The medal was first created on 3 November 1977 by President Jimmy Carter under to recognize non-combat meritorious achievement or service while serving in a joint assignment. The recognized service is typically for a period of time greater than 12 months, encompassing a recipient’s entire joint assignment, including extensions. The required achievement or service, is of a lesser degree than that required for award of the Defense Superior Service Medal, but must have been accomplished with distinction.

A joint assignment &quot;connotes activities, operations, or organizations in which elements of more than one Armed Forces of the United States, as reflected in joint manpower documents or the Joint Duty Assignment List, perform joint missions under the auspices of the Office of the Secretary of Defense; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; or the commander of a Combatant Command&quot;. Service members assigned to or attached to a Joint Task Force as individuals, not members of a specific military service&#x27;s unit, can be eligible for the DMSM. Members of service specific units are eligible for awards of personal decorations from their parent service. Personnel serving with jointly manned staffs within Allied Command Europe, Allied Command Atlantic, the NATO Military Committee, and military agencies associated with functions of the military or other joint activities as may be designated are also included.

In 2014, President Barack Obama with extended eligibility of the DMSM to include any member of the armed forces of a friendly foreign nation, thus authorizing recognition of those NATO, Allied and Coalition officers and senior enlisted personnel assigned to/embedded in the Joint Staff, the Unified Combatant Commands and associated Joint Task Forces.

==Appearance==
===Medal description===
The Defense Meritorious Service Medal is made of bronze and is in diameter. The obverse design consists of a circular wreath of laurel leaves tied with a ribbon at base. In the center is a pentagon shape which slightly overlaps the wreath. Superimposed over the pentagon is an eagle with wings upraised standing at the base of the pentagon. The eagle is symbolic of the United States while the pentagon shape alludes to the Department of Defense, and the laurel wreath represents achievement. The reverse of the medal bears the inscription, &quot;Defense Meritorious Service&quot; in three horizontal lines while around the bottom are the words, &quot;United States of America&quot;. In between the inscriptions is space for engraving the name of the recipient.

===Ribbon description===
The ribbon for the medal is in width composed of the following vertical stripes: White , Crimson , White , Bluebird , White , Bluebird , White , Bluebird , White , Crimson , White . The colors, crimson and white, are duplicates of the colors of the Legion of Merit ribbon. The stripes of blue (Bluebird) is the color associated with the Department of Defense.

Additional awards of the Defense Meritorious Service Medal are denoted by bronze oak leaf clusters, with a silver oak leaf cluster representing six awards. As a joint award, oak leaf clusters traditionally associated with Army, Air Force, and Space Force awards are also used for multiple awards of the DMSM to Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard personnel. These oak leaf clusters are attached to the suspension and service ribbons.

<doc id="764467" wikidata="Q846120" url="?curid=764467" title="USS Hué City">
<text>USS &quot;Hué City&quot; (CG-66) is a guided missile cruiser serving in the United States Navy. She was ordered 16 April 1987, and laid down 20 February 1989, at Ingalls Shipbuilding, Pascagoula, Mississippi. &quot;Hué City&quot; was in active service from 14 September 1991 to 23 September 2022. She is named for the Battle of Huế, fought in the city during the Tet Offensive of 1968 by the 1st Marine Regiment (composed of 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines and attached units) during the Vietnam War. The three battalion commanders were the honored guests at her 1991 commissioning.

&quot;Hué City&quot; is the only U.S. Navy ship named after a battle in the Vietnam War, although it had been planned to name LHA-5 as USS &quot;Khe Sanh&quot; after the Battle of Khe Sanh, but that ship was commissioned in 1976 as . As the only U.S. warship named for a battle that took place during the Vietnam War, &quot;Hué City&quot; had the opportunity to reach out to the veterans of the battle for which she is named. She frequently held memorials commemorating the Battle of Huế.

== Ship history ==
=== 1990s ===
&quot;Hué City&quot; sailed on 11 March 1993, for her maiden deployment to the Mediterranean Sea as Air Warfare Commander for the Carrier battle group (CVBG). Principally operating in the Adriatic Sea, &quot;Hué City&quot; developed the air picture and transmitted it to command centers afloat and shore. &quot;Hué City&quot; also monitored the safety of United Nations relief flights to Bosnia, ensuring Serbian aircraft did not violate no-fly zones.

While conducting training near Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in April 1994, &quot;Hué City&quot; was directed to serve as Destroyer Squadron 22 flagship in support of sanctions against Haiti. &quot;Hué City&quot; sailed for her second deployment 22 March 1995, with the &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; CVBG. &quot;Hué City&quot; took station in the Red Sea, where she provided air coverage to the Combat Air Patrol enforcing the no-fly zone in Southern Iraq.

&quot;Hué City&quot; sailed for the Baltic Sea on 24 May 1996, to participate in operations involving forty-eight ships from thirteen nations. The operations focused on tracking air, surface, and subsurface targets in a multinational task force. &quot;Hué City&quot; deployed on 29 April 1997, to the Mediterranean Sea as Air Warfare Commander for the CVBG. &quot;Hué City&quot; operated in the Adriatic Sea, overseeing all air activity in support of naval operations.

In 1999, &quot;Hué City&quot; sailed for counter-drug operations in the Caribbean Sea. Later that year, &quot;Hué City&quot; participated in Baltic Operations, a multinational exercise consisting of fifty-three vessels from twelve nations.

=== 2000s ===
&quot;Hué City&quot; conducted multinational exercises in South America while acting as flagship in UNITAS 2000 Caribbean phase. On 26 June 2000, &quot;Hué City&quot; sailed to New York City, as the reviewing ship for President Clinton and his family, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Navy, Chief of Naval Operations, Commandant of the Marine Corps, and COMCRUDESGRU 12 in the International Naval Review 2000.

As part of the CVBG, and in response to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, &quot;Hué City&quot; set sail in support of defense and humanitarian efforts off the coast of New York.

Ships and aircraft of the &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; CVBG commenced use of the Vieques Island inner range beginning 24 September 2001, in conjunction with their Composite Unit Training Exercises (COMPUTEX). The exercise, which began the week prior, also utilized the northern and southern Puerto Rico operating areas, and involved complex battle group training events, naval surface fire-support training and air-to-ground bombing.

&quot;Hué City&quot; then took part in Underway No. 10, one in a series of tests leading to the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) Operation Evaluation (OPEVAL) scheduled for Spring 2001. The CEC system provides the capability to cooperatively engage targets by a warship using data from other CEC-equipped ships, aircraft, and land-based sensors, even in an electronic-jamming environment. It also provides a common, consistent and highly accurate air picture, allowing battle group defenses to act as one seamless system. The test, off Wallops Island, Virginia, simulated missile firings from some of the Navy&#x27;s most technically advanced ships against unmanned drones.

As part of the &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; CVBG, &quot;Hué City&quot; took part Joint Task Force Exercise (JTFEX) 02-1, with Phase I of the exercise running from January 19 through 26, 2002 and Phase II running 7–14 February 2002.

In March 2002, &quot;Hué City&quot; was part of &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; CVBG at it relieved the &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; CVBG, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.

In May 2002, during a three-day Naval Gun Fire Support (NGFS) exercise off the coast of Djibouti, Africa, &quot;Hué City&quot; fired hundreds of 5-inch rounds in support of Marine Expeditionary Unit Exercise 2002 (MEUEX &#x27;02) more than 60 targets that included tanks, bunkers, and various military vehicles. &quot;Hué City&quot; joined the Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) and the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit to conduct this first of its kind exercise in this little-known region of northeast Africa.

=== 2010s ===
Prior to 2014, she successfully completed consecutive deployments to the Persian Gulf and North Arabian Sea.

On 14 April 2014, Monday evening, a fire broke out at just after 6:20 p.m. local time while &quot;Hué City&quot; was steaming about 200 nautical miles northeast of Bermuda. The crew fought and defeated a major fire in one of the main engineering spaces without suffering any injuries. The ship&#x27;s executive officer was relieved by the head of Carrier Strike Group 8 in June 2014 for &quot;failing to ensure his crew properly stowed hazardous materials&quot; which subsequently caught fire. According to the investigation report, bales of rags caught fire after they had been improperly stored in an exhaust uptake trunk. The fire caused over $23 million in damage and required over 9 months of repairs. It also caused &quot;Hué City&quot; to miss the planned deployment to Europe.

===2020s===
In December 2020 the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Report to Congress on the Annual Long-Range Plan for Construction of Naval Vessels stated that the ship was planned to be placed Out of Commission in Reserve in 2022.

On 23 September 2022, the Navy held a decommissioning ceremony for &quot;Hué City&quot; at Naval Station Norfolk.

== Awards ==
&quot;Hué City&quot; has received the following awards:

* Meritorious Unit Commendation, as part of TG 20.15 from 8 May 2000 to 14 May 2001
* Meritorious Unit Commendation, as part of TF 60 from 1 April 2002 to 30 September 2002
* Meritorious Unit Commendation, as part of COMCARSTRKGRU 8 from 1 October 2011 to 3 July 2013
* Armed Forces Service Medal for a number of periods relating to Bosnia from March to July 1993, June to September 1995 and June to August 1997.
* Navy E Ribbon, 13 awards. 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012.

<text>In computability theory Post&#x27;s theorem, named after Emil Post, describes the connection between the arithmetical hierarchy and the Turing degrees. 

== Background ==

The statement of Post&#x27;s theorem uses several concepts relating to definability and recursion theory. This section gives a brief overview of these concepts, which are covered in depth in their respective articles. 

The arithmetical hierarchy classifies certain sets of natural numbers that are definable in the language of Peano arithmetic. A formula is said to be formula_1 if it is an existential statement in prenex normal form (all quantifiers at the front) with formula_2 alternations between existential and universal quantifiers applied to a formula with bounded quantifiers only. Formally a formula formula_3 in the language of Peano arithmetic is a formula_1 formula if it is of the form
:formula_5
where formula_6 contains only bounded quantifiers and &quot;Q&quot; is formula_7 if &quot;m&quot; is even and formula_8 if &quot;m&quot; is odd.

A set of natural numbers formula_9 is said to be formula_10 if it is definable by a formula_10 formula, that is, if there is a formula_10 formula formula_3 such that each number formula_14 is in formula_9 if and only if formula_16 holds. It is known that if a set is formula_10 then it is formula_18 for any formula_19, but for each &quot;m&quot; there is a formula_20 set that is not formula_10. Thus the number of quantifier alternations required to define a set gives a measure of the complexity of the set.

Post&#x27;s theorem uses the relativized arithmetical hierarchy as well as the unrelativized hierarchy just defined. A set formula_9 of natural numbers is said to be formula_10 relative to a set formula_24, written formula_25, if formula_9 is definable by a formula_10 formula in an extended language that includes a predicate for membership in formula_24.

While the arithmetical hierarchy measures definability of sets of natural numbers, Turing degrees measure the level of uncomputability of sets of natural numbers. A set formula_9 is said to be Turing reducible to a set formula_24, written formula_31, if there is an oracle Turing machine that, given an oracle for formula_24, computes the characteristic function of formula_9.
The Turing jump of a set formula_9 is a form of the Halting problem relative to formula_9. Given a set formula_9, the Turing jump formula_37 is the set of indices of oracle Turing machines that halt on input formula_38 when run with oracle formula_9. It is known that every set formula_9 is Turing reducible to its Turing jump, but the Turing jump of a set is never Turing reducible to the original set. 

Post&#x27;s theorem uses finitely iterated Turing jumps. For any set formula_9 of natural numbers, the notation formula_42 indicates the formula_14–fold iterated Turing jump of formula_9. Thus formula_45 is just formula_9, and formula_47 is the Turing jump of formula_42.

== Post&#x27;s theorem and corollaries ==

Post&#x27;s theorem establishes a close connection between the arithmetical hierarchy and the Turing degrees of the form formula_49, that is, finitely iterated Turing jumps of the empty set. (The empty set could be replaced with any other computable set without changing the truth of the theorem.)

Post&#x27;s theorem states:
#A set formula_24 is formula_51 if and only if formula_24 is recursively enumerable by an oracle Turing machine with an oracle for formula_49, that is, if and only if formula_24 is formula_55.
#The set formula_49 is formula_18-complete for every formula_58. This means that every formula_18 set is many-one reducible to formula_49. 

Post&#x27;s theorem has many corollaries that expose additional relationships between the arithmetical
hierarchy and the Turing degrees. These include:
#Fix a set formula_61. A set formula_24 is formula_63 if and only if formula_24 is formula_65. This is the relativization of the first part of Post&#x27;s theorem to the oracle formula_61.
#A set formula_24 is formula_68 if and only if formula_69. More generally, formula_24 is formula_71 if and only if formula_72.
#A set is defined to be arithmetical if it is formula_18 for some formula_14. Post&#x27;s theorem shows that, equivalently, a set is arithmetical if and only if it is Turing reducible to formula_75 for some &quot;m&quot;.

== Proof of Post&#x27;s theorem ==
===Formalization of Turing machines in first-order arithmetic===
The operation of a Turing machine formula_76 on input formula_14 can be formalized logically in first-order arithmetic. For example, we may use symbols formula_78, formula_79, and formula_80 for the tape configuration, machine state and location along the tape after formula_81 steps, respectively. formula_76&#x27;s transition system determines the relation between formula_83 and formula_84; their initial values (for formula_85) are the input, the initial state and zero, respectively. The machine halts if and only if there is a number formula_81 such that formula_79 is the halting state.

The exact relation depends on the specific implementation of the notion of Turing machine (e.g. their alphabet, allowed mode of motion along the tape, etc.)

In case formula_76 halts at time formula_89, the relation between formula_83 and formula_84 must be satisfied only for k bounded from above by formula_89.

Thus there is a formula formula_93 in first-order arithmetic with no unbounded quantifiers, such that formula_76 halts on input formula_14 at time formula_89 at most if and only if formula_93 is satisfied.

===Implementation example===
For example, for a prefix-free Turing machine with binary alphabet and no blank symbol, we may use the following notations:
*formula_78 is the 1-ary symbol for the configuration of the whole tape after formula_81 steps (which we may write as a number with LSB first, the value of the m-th location on the tape being its m-th least significant bit). In particular formula_100 is the initial configuration of the tape, which corresponds the input to the machine.
*formula_79 is the 1-ary symbol for the Turing machine state after formula_81 steps. In particular, formula_103, the initial state of the Turing machine.
*formula_80 is the 1-ary symbol for the Turing machine location on the tape after formula_81 steps. In particular formula_106.
* formula_107 is the transition function of the Turing machine, written as a function from a doublet (machine state, bit read by the machine) to a triplet (new machine state, bit written by the machine, +1 or -1 machine movement along the tape).
*formula_108 is the j-th bit of a number formula_2. This can be written as a first-order arithmetic formula with no unbounded quantifiers.

For a prefix-free Turing machine we may use, for input n, the initial tape configuration formula_110 where cat stands for concatenation; thus formula_111 is a formula_112length string of formula_113 followed by formula_38 and then by formula_14. 

The operation of the Turing machine at the first formula_89 steps can thus be written as the conjunction of the initial conditions and the following formulas, quantified over formula_81 for all formula_118:
*formula_119. Since M has a finite domain, this can be replaced by a first-order quantifier-free arithmetic formula. The exact formula obviously depends on M.
*formula_120 
*formula_121. Note that at the first formula_89 steps, formula_76 never arrives at a location along the tape greater than formula_89. Thus the universal quantifier over j can be bounded by formula_89+1, as bits beyond this location have no relevance for the machine&#x27;s operation.

T halts on input formula_14 at time formula_89 at most if and only if formula_93 is satisfied, where:
:formula_129

This is a first-order arithmetic formula with no unbounded quantifiers, i.e. it is in formula_130.

===Recursively enumerable sets===
Let formula_131 be a set that can be recursively enumerated by a Turing machine. Then there is a Turing machine formula_76 that for every formula_14 in formula_131, formula_76 halts when given formula_14 as an input.

This can be formalized by the first-order arithmetical formula presented above. The members of formula_131 are the numbers formula_14 satisfying the following formula:

formula_139

This formula is in formula_140. Therefore, formula_131 is in formula_140.
Thus every recursively enumerable set is in formula_140. 

The converse is true as well: for every formula formula_144 in formula_140 with k existential quantifiers, we may enumerate the formula_81–tuples of natural numbers and run a Turing machine that goes through all of them until it finds the formula is satisfied. This Turing machine halts on precisely the set of natural numbers satisfying formula_144, and thus enumerates its corresponding set.

===Oracle machines===

Similarly, the operation of an oracle machine formula_76 with an oracle O that halts after at most formula_89 steps on input formula_14 can be described by a first-order formula formula_151, except that the formula formula_152 now includes:
* A new predicate, formula_153, giving the oracle answer. This predicate must satisfy some formula to be discussed below.
* An additional tape - the oracle tape - on which formula_76 has to write the number m for every call O(m) to the oracle; writing on this tape can be logically formalized in a similar manner to writing on the machine&#x27;s tape. Note that an oracle machine that halts after at most formula_89 steps has time to write at most formula_89 digits on the oracle tape. So the oracle can only be called with numbers m satisfying formula_157.

If the oracle is for a decision problem, formula_153 is always &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;, which we may formalize as 0 or 1. Suppose the decision problem itself can be formalized by a first-order arithmetic formula formula_159.
Then formula_76 halts on formula_14 after at most formula_89 steps if and only if the following formula is satisfied:
formula_163

where formula_164 is a first-order formula with no unbounded quantifiers.

===Turing jump===

If O is an oracle to the halting problem of a machine formula_165, then formula_159 is the same as &quot;there exists formula_167 such that formula_165 starting with input m is at the halting state after formula_167 steps&quot;. 
Thus:
formula_170
where formula_171 is a first-order formula that formalizes formula_165. If formula_165 is a Turing machine (with no oracle), formula_171 is in formula_175 (i.e. it has no unbounded quantifiers).

Since there is a finite number of numbers m satisfying formula_157, we may choose the same number of steps for all of them: there is a number formula_167, such that formula_165 halts after formula_167 steps precisely on those inputs formula_157 for which it halts at all.

Moving to prenex normal form, we get that the oracle machine halts on input formula_14 if and only if the following formula is satisfied:
formula_182

(informally, there is a &quot;maximal number of steps&quot;formula_167 such every oracle that does not halt within the first formula_167 steps does not stop at all; however, for everyformula_185, each oracle that halts after formula_185 steps does halt).

Note that we may replace both formula_89 and formula_167 by a single number - their maximum - without changing the truth value of formula_144. Thus we may write:
formula_190

For the oracle to the halting problem over Turing machines, formula_171 is in formula_192 and formula_144 is in formula_194. Thus every set that is recursively enumerable by an oracle machine with an oracle for formula_195, is in formula_194.

The converse is true as well: Suppose formula_144 is a formula in formula_194 with formula_199 existential quantifiers followed by formula_200 universal quantifiers. Equivalently, formula_144 has formula_199&gt; existential quantifiers followed by a negation of a formula in formula_140; the latter formula can be enumerated by a Turing machine and can thus be checked immediately by an oracle for formula_195.

We may thus enumerate the formula_199–tuples of natural numbers and run an oracle machine with an oracle for formula_195 that goes through all of them until it finds a satisfaction for the formula. This oracle machine halts on precisely the set of natural numbers satisfying formula_144, and thus enumerates its corresponding set.

===Higher Turing jumps===

More generally, suppose every set that is recursively enumerable by an oracle machine with an oracle for formula_208 is in formula_209. Then for an oracle machine with an oracle for formula_210, formula_170 is in formula_209.

Since formula_159 is the same as formula_144 for the previous Turing jump, it can be constructed (as we have just done with formula_144 above) so that formula_171 in formula_217. After moving to prenex formal form the new formula_144 is in formula_219.

By induction, every set that is recursively enumerable by an oracle machine with an oracle for formula_208, is in formula_209.

The other direction can be proven by induction as well: Suppose every formula in formula_209 can be enumerated by an oracle machine with an oracle for formula_208.

Now Suppose formula_144 is a formula in formula_219 with formula_199 existential quantifiers followed by formula_200 universal quantifiers etc. Equivalently, formula_144 has formula_199&gt; existential quantifiers followed by a negation of a formula in formula_209; the latter formula can be enumerated by an oracle machine with an oracle for formula_208 and can thus be checked immediately by an oracle for formula_210.

We may thus enumerate the formula_199–tuples of natural numbers and run an oracle machine with an oracle for formula_210 that goes through all of them until it finds a satisfaction for the formula. This oracle machine halts on precisely the set of natural numbers satisfying formula_144, and thus enumerates its corresponding set.

<text>USS &quot;Vicksburg&quot; (CG-69) was a guided missile cruiser that served in the United States Navy. She was named for the Siege of Vicksburg fought during the American Civil War.

&quot;Vicksburg&quot; was built by Ingalls Shipbuilding, at Pascagoula, Mississippi and commissioned on 14 November 1992. The ship first deployed in 1994 and last deployed in 2015. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; was decommissioned 28 June 2024 after spending 8 years in the Navy&#x27;s Cruiser Modernization program.

&quot;Vicksburg&quot; was equipped with the Aegis Combat System and was capable of facing threats in the air, on the sea, ashore, and underneath the sea. She was also capable of carrying two SH-60 Sea Hawk Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS III) helicopters.

The previous was a light cruiser during and after World War II. &quot;Vicksburg&quot;″s crest has two stars on the streamer in the eagle&#x27;s beak representing the two battle stars awarded to her predecessor.

== History ==

=== 1990s ===
&quot;Vicksburg&quot; was built by Ingalls Shipbuilding, at Pascagoula, Mississippi. Her keel was laid down on 30 May 1990, and she was launched on 7 September 1991. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; was sponsored by Tricia Lott, wife of United States Senator, Trent Lott. On 12 October 1991, Mrs. Lott christened CG-69 as &quot;Vicksburg&quot;. She was commissioned on 14 November 1992. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; was originally named &quot;Port Royal&quot;, but the name was changed before the keel was laid.

On her maiden cruise in 1994, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; was assigned to the battle group, which was stationed off the coast of Montenegro. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; participated in Operation Deny Flight and Operation Provide Promise, serving as an airspace command and control platform. In May 1994, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; participated in NATO&#x27;s &quot;Dynamic Impact 94&quot; exercise in the western Mediterranean, and in August 1994 &quot;Vicksburg&quot; joined Operation Able Vigil, helping to intercept Cuban migrants crossing the Florida Straits. In September 1994, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; escorted the aircraft carrier to Haiti as part of Operation Uphold Democracy.

&quot;Vicksburg&quot; returned from a 6 month deployment in March 1996. During the deployment, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; participated in Operation Southern Watch in the Persian Gulf. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; also performed Maritime Interception Operations to enforce UN sanctions that prohibited exports from Iraq. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; conducted over 85 boardings. At that time, the primary contraband was dates carried by dhows. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; visited Italy, Spain, and the United Arab Emirates during the deployment.

In 1997, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean Sea with the carrier battle group (CVBG).

In 1998, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; and had problems integrating AEGIS Baseline 6 and Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC), rendering the ships unavailable for service. The CVBG deployed in September 1999 without &quot;Vicksburg&quot; and &quot;Hué City&quot;.

In 1999, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; participated in BALTOPS &#x27;99 and UNITAS 40-99.

=== 2000s ===
In May 2000, Lockheed Martin announced that &quot;Vicksburg&quot; and &quot;Hué City&quot; completed a series of live missile firing exercises. The tests came after two years of integration and testing and paved the way for further test efforts with the entire battlegroup. Five test targets were engaged including low and high altitude threats and severe electronic countermeasures. The test also included a demonstration of engage on remote (EOR) which allowed one ship to complete an engagement against a target solely using data from a second ship. In 2001, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; and the rest of the CVBG extensively tested the CEC system. Following the September 11 attacks, the battle group supported Operation Noble Eagle.

In February 2002, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; deployed with the carrier battlegroup (CVBG), initially to the Mediterranean Sea. In March 2002, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; was part of the &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; CVBG as she relieved the CVBG, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. On 16 June 2002, off the coast of Oman, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; launched an SH-60B helicopter from HSL-42, Det 7, to assist &quot;Stolt Spray&quot;. The tanker was standing by to assist the foundering motor vessel &quot;al Murthada&quot;, but monsoon conditions prevented its assistance. &quot;Vicksburg’s&quot; helicopter transferred &quot;al Murthada’s&quot; distressed mariners, who had been adrift for eight days, to &quot;Stolt Spray&quot; for further transportation.

In March 2003, she was assigned to Naval Surface Group Two. In December 2004, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; and the battlegroup returned from a six month deployment to the Middle East.

&quot;Vicksburg&quot; departed on a surge deployment to the middle east on 26 January 2006. In February, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; became the first US Navy ship to refuel from a new Defense Fuel Supply Point in Djibouti. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; returned in June 2006. On 16 February 2007, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; was awarded the 2006 Battle &quot;E&quot; award. She was part of Carrier Strike Group Twelve, which was led by until December 2012.

25 January 2008, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; returned to Mayport following a six month deployment to the Persian Gulf. In February 2009, she deployed to the Persian Gulf as part of the carrier strike group.

=== 2010s ===
In 2010, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; deployed for a three month Theater Security Cooperation Surge deployment to Northern Europe. The ship conducted exercises with the Norwegian Navy and then participated in the Joint Warrior 10-1 multinational exercise.

&quot;Vicksburg&quot; deployed with the CVBG in March 2012 on the carrier&#x27;s final deployment. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; visited Piraeus, Greece, in late March 2012. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; conducted operations with the from 16–24 April 2012. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; visited Bahrain at the end of May and again in August. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; visited Lisbon, Portugal on October 17, 2012. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; returned to Mayport in November 2012.

The US Navy was planning to retire &quot;Vicksburg&quot; along with eight other &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruisers in fiscal year 2013 in line with US Defense Department budget reductions. The ship was scheduled to be decommissioned on 31 March 2013.
Language inserted into the FY13 House of Representatives Defense Bill retained &quot;Vicksburg&quot; and two other of her sister ships that were slated for decommissioning. Retaining the ships in the active fleet was not supported by the United States Secretary of Defense, but the outcome was determined by the final FY13 Defense Bill negotiated with the United States Senate. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; and two other &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruisers were retained under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013.

In 2014, the cruiser participated in Joint Warrior 14-2, a United Kingdom-led multinational exercise in British coastal waters. The training was designed to provide allied forces a multiwarfare environment to prepare for global operations. On 4 December 2014, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; departed Naval Station Mayport to relieve the cruiser as the Standing NATO Maritime Group 2 (SNMG2) flagship and to support theater security cooperation efforts in Europe. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; relieved &quot;Leyte Gulf&quot; as SNMG2 Flagship in Naples on 20 December 2014. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; and SNMG2 deployed to the Black Sea 4 March 2015. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; and SNMG2 visited Varna, Bulgaria 7–8 March and Constanta, Romania around 16 March 2015. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; and SNMG2 left the Black sea around 20 March. In April, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; and SNMG2 visited Faslane, Scotland along with Standing NATO Mine Counter-Measures Groups One and Two for Joint Warrior 15-1. In May, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; and SNMG2 participated in the anti-submarine exercise Dynamic Mongoose. The ship returned to Mayport on 11 July 2015.

On 1 July 2016, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; was transferred from Carrier Strike Group Twelve to the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) and entered the Navy&#x27;s Cruiser Modernization program. The ship&#x27;s homeport was changed to Norfolk and the crew was reduced from 350 to less than 50. In 2017, BAE Systems announced it was awarded a special selected restricted availability (SSRA) contract for up to $42.9 million. The work was planned for April to September 2017 at BAE Systems Norfolk Ship Repair and was part of &quot;Vicksburg&quot;″s modernization.

=== 2020s ===
In January 2020, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; was sent to BAE Systems for an $175 million, 18-month Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). In May 2022, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; was reported to be 85% completed with its modernization and was expected to be complete by summer 2023. According to Rep. Kay Granger (R-Texas), &quot;Since 2020, the Navy has awarded nearly $500 million in contracts to upgrade the cruiser.&quot;

The Navy requested to decommission &quot;Vicksburg&quot; in its FY23 and FY24 budgets. Navy Undersecretary Erik Raven stated that this was due to the ship&#x27;s &quot;material condition, life remaining, cost, ... time to upgrade ... and the warfighting value.&quot;

In March 2023, the Navy submitted to Congress a list of 11 ships it sought to retire, including &quot;Vicksburg&quot; which has been in the modernization program since 2016. According to Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro in April 2023, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; and &quot;Cowpens&quot; &quot;will never see another deployment, regardless of how much money we put into them.&quot; The Navy reported that costs of the modernization have increased to $500 million.

In March 2024, the Navy announced plans to inactivate &quot;Vicksburg&quot; on 29 June 2024. In early 2024, all modernization work had ceased on &quot;Vicksburg&quot;. By 11 April 2024, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; had been stripped of topside gear and antennas and towed from BAE Systems shipyard to NS Norfolk for decommissioning. The ship was decommissioned during a ceremony in Norfolk on 28 June 2024. According to the NVR, the ship was officially decommissioned and stricken on 26 July 2024. The ship was towed from Norfolk to Philadelphia Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility by starting on 4 September 2024.

<doc id="764470" wikidata="Q1688392" url="?curid=764470" title="USS Lake Erie (CG-70)">
<text>USS &quot;Lake Erie&quot; (CG-70) is a guided missile cruiser of the United States Navy, commissioned in 1993. She was named after the U.S. Navy&#x27;s decisive victory in the Battle of Lake Erie during the War of 1812. The cruiser was the first U.S. Navy ship to be commissioned in Hawaii.

== History ==
&quot;Lake Erie&quot; was built by Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine. Her keel was laid on 6 March 1990 and she was launched on 13 July 1991. Upon completion of her sea-trials after construction, &quot;Lake Erie&quot; transferred to the Pacific Fleet and was commissioned on 24 July 1993 as the twenty-fourth &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class guided missile cruiser in her homeport of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. &quot;Lake Erie&quot; is a baseline 4 &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class ship, with integrated AN/UYK-43/44 computers (in place of UYK-7 and UYK-20) and superset computer programs originally developed for the guided missile destroyers. &quot;Lake Erie&quot; also has an improved UYS-20 data display system and various decision aids, as well as the SQS-53C sonar and the SQR-19 sonar data processor.

=== Service with the &quot;Constellation&quot; battle group ===
As part of a seven ship battle group, led by the aircraft carrier , &quot;Lake Erie&quot; entered the Persian Gulf 11 January 1995. Along with the &quot;Constellation&quot; battle group, &quot;Lake Erie&quot; deployed 10 November 1994 and spent most of December in the western Pacific. The arrival of &quot;Constellation&quot; and her escorts strengthened the U.S. presence in the Persian Gulf and supported U.N. initiatives in the region, including Operation Southern Watch. In March &quot;Lake Erie&quot; took part in a two-week, anti-submarine warfare (ASW) exercise in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman 5 to 19 February to gather data and evaluate tactics to counter the growing threat of third-world diesel submarines. For purposes of the exercise the US submarine simulated a diesel submarine, while &quot;Lake Erie&quot; and rounded out the surface forces. The first week of the exercise took place in the southern Persian Gulf, while the second week was held outside the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf of Oman. &quot;Lake Erie&quot; and the other ships of the &quot;Constellation&quot; battle group returned home in May.

During a deployment with the &quot;Constellation&quot; battle group in July 1997, turned over the duties of being regional Air Defense Commander to &quot;Lake Erie&quot;. In early August 1997 &quot;Lake Erie&quot; was involved in two major Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (TBMD) exercises in the Persian Gulf named Arabian Skies. During the exercises &quot;Constellation&quot;″s battle group demonstrated a viable TBMD capability using the existing command and control architecture. &quot;Lake Erie&quot; then departed 5th Fleet&#x27;s Area of Responsibility (AOR) 17 August 1997 on schedule to continue her routine six-month deployment in the waters of the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean. On 16 May 1998 &quot;Lake Erie&quot; returned to the Persian Gulf with elements of the &quot;Constellation&quot; battle group before she concluded her tour in the 5th Fleet with a joint-combined exercise with military forces from Pakistan. Dubbed &quot;Inspired Siren 97-2&quot; and &quot;Inspired Alert 97-2,&quot; the exercises incorporated both surface combatants and air components, respectively. The purpose of this four-day training mission was to exercise the joint-combined naval and air capabilities of both countries, improve their respective levels of readiness and interoperability, and enhance military relations between the two nations.

=== Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System testbed ===
In August 1998, as part of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, modifications were made aboard &quot;Lake Erie&quot; and , which consisted of modifications to the Aegis weapons system on board &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruisers; a modification, known as Linebacker, and which uses specialized computing and radar software and hardware to provide improved tracking and reporting capabilities, and when coupled with the SM-2 Block IVA, intercept Tactical Ballistic Missiles (TBM). Ballistic missile testing afforded &quot;Port Royal&quot; and other participants an opportunity to flex the capabilities of the current Aegis weapon system against a live ballistic missile target and gave a representation of how the modified system tracks and destroys TBMs.


&quot;Lake Erie&quot; and &quot;Port Royal&quot; were then to conduct at sea testing, develop core doctrine and tactics, and serve as focal points for putting the TBMD technology in the hands of the warfighters in the rest of the fleet. Sailors on board both ships were also to provide early feedback to the technical community and influence the final design of the TBMD system. Successful Linebacker sea trials at the Pacific Missile Range, Kauai, Hawaii took place in the fall of 1998.

On 17 December 1999, &quot;Lake Erie&quot; returned to her homeport at Naval Station Pearl Harbor after completing a six-month deployment to the western Pacific and Persian Gulf. The guided missile cruiser had once more deployed with the &quot;Constellation&quot; battle group.

In March 2000, the US Navy began ALI live fire tests and had successfully conducted the first Controlled Test Vehicle. had conducted the first ALI live firing test in September 1999 and had successfully demonstrated the launch and flight sequence through third stage separation as well as verified flight stability at extreme altitude. Though the original plan had been to conduct all Flight Test Round shots from &quot;Shiloh&quot;, the need for further testing conflicted with her operational schedule. Therefore, it was decided by the Chief of Naval Operations to shift to &quot;Lake Erie&quot; to conduct the next firings in the ALI testing program. &quot;Lake Erie&quot;, already equipped with Area Linebacker modifications, was, as of 2 March 2000, receiving ALI equipment modifications in Pearl Harbor and was to conduct system checks and training to support the planned test firings.

In early July 2000, the US Navy announced that &quot;Lake Erie&quot; had been designated the Navy&#x27;s theater-wide test ship for the AEGIS Lightweight Exoatmospheric Projectile intercept flight-test series. For the next two years, &quot;Lake Erie&quot; would be dedicated to conducting these critical tests. &quot;Lake Erie&quot;&#x27;s home port in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, made the ship&#x27;s participation in tests at the Pacific Missile Range Facility off Kauai cost-effective with the Navy anticipating that the ship would not deploy operationally again for about two years.
In January 2001, &quot;Lake Erie&quot; conducted the Aegis Light Exo-Atmospheric Projectile (LEAP) Intercept Flight Test Round (FTR-1A) mission in the mid-Pacific using the Pacific Missile Range Facility, Kauai, Hawaii. Equipped with Aegis LEAP Intercept (ALI) computer programs and hardware, &quot;Lake Erie&quot; launched an SM-3 missile demonstrating third stage airframe stability and control through nominal kinetic warhead fourth stage separation. The SM-3 is the Navy&#x27;s new exo-atmospheric missile developed to counter theater ballistic missile (TBM) threats outside the atmosphere.

On 9 February 2001 &quot;Lake Erie&quot; sortied from Pearl Harbor to assist along with Coast Guard boats and cutters with rescue efforts after the attack submarine struck a Japanese fishing vessel while surfacing at approximately 1:45 pm (HST) about nine miles south of the Diamond Head crater off Honolulu, Hawaii. The fishing vessel, named &quot;Ehime Maru&quot;, rapidly flooded and sank within 10 minutes in of water. Twenty-six of 35 aboard were rescued. &quot;Ehime Maru&quot; had been on a fishing and research mission when &quot;Greeneville&quot; rapidly surfaced and collided with her stern. At the time of the accident, the was conducting an &quot;emergency ballast tank blow,&quot; a procedure used to bring subs to the surface in the event of an emergency. In this case it was used for training, on a one-day cruise with 16 military and civilian guests.

On 25 January 2002 the Missile Defense Agency and the Navy conducted a successful flight test in the continuing development of a Sea-Based Midcourse (SMD) Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). Flight Mission-2 (FM-2) involved the launch of a developmental Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) and kinetic warhead (KW) interceptor from &quot;Lake Erie&quot; and an Aries target missile launched from the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) on the island of Kauai, Hawaii. The target was launched at 18:00 (EST) 26 January. About eight minutes later, &quot;Lake Erie&quot;, equipped with Aegis Lightweight Exo-atmospheric Projectile (LEAP) computer programs and equipment, and having tracked the target with the Aegis SPY-1 radar and developed a fire-control solution, launched the newly developed SM-3. The SM-3 acquired, tracked and diverted toward the target, demonstrating SM-3 fourth-stage Kinetic Warhead (KW) guidance, navigation and control. Although not a primary objective, during this early developmental test, the KW was aimed at the target, resulting in a hit-to-kill intercept at approximately 18:18 (EST).

The primary objective of this test was to evaluate SM-3 fourth-stage Kinetic Warhead guidance, navigation and control, with extensive engineering evaluation data collected for analyses in preparation for future flight tests. It was the fourth in a planned series of nine developmental test flights for the SMD program. The mission also included the first fully operational SM-3 with a live Solid Divert and Attitude Control System to steer the KW into the target.

In March 2003 she was assigned to Cruiser-Destroyer Group One.

USS &quot;Lake Erie&quot; was featured in the 2011 naval thriller, &quot;Thunder in the Morning Calm&quot;, by Don Brown.

On 14 February 2008 the U.S. Department of Defense announced that as part of Operation Burnt Frost &quot;Lake Erie&quot; and two other ships would attempt to hit the failed satellite USA-193 in the north Pacific just prior to burn up during a period after 20 February using a modified SM-3 missile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters 2/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 February 2008, at approximately 3:30 UTC, the missile was fired and later confirmed to have struck the satellite. The military intended that the kinetic energy of the missile would rupture the hydrazine fuel tank allowing the toxic fuel to be consumed during re-entry.

In August 2014, &quot;Lake Erie&quot; went to San Diego for an extended maintenance period. &quot;Lake Erie&quot; was expected to replace as a rotational Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) deployer after the maintenance period.

On 30 November 2017, Lake Erie arrived in Pearl Harbor following a seven-month deployment to the Indo-Asia-Pacific region and the Persian Gulf.

<text>Samoa Airways, formerly Polynesian Airlines, is the flag carrier of Samoa.

The airline was founded in 1959 as &quot;Polynesian Airlines&quot;, providing domestic and international flights throughout the South Pacific. International operations were temporarily halted in 2005 and taken over by new airline Polynesian Blue (later Virgin Samoa), before resuming international flights under the new name of &quot;Samoa Airways&quot; in late 2017.

Samoa Airways is wholly owned by the government of Samoa and is based in the capital city of Apia, with its headquarters located in the Samoa Methodist Church Building on Beach Road and its primary hub at Faleolo International Airport. The airline presently operates short-haul flights within Samoa and American Samoa, however it no longer serves long-haul flights to Australia and New Zealand after the company ceased jet operations in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

== History ==

The airline was established in 1959 as &quot;Polynesian Airlines&quot;, and started operations in August that year. By 1969 it was running daily flights to Pago Pago using a Douglas DC-3, as well as services to Tonga and Fiji using a chartered Hawker Siddeley HS 748.

In 2005, the airline&#x27;s international jet flights were taken over by Polynesian Blue, a new airline established as a joint venture between the government of Samoa and Australian low-cost carrier Virgin Blue. Both the Samoan government and Virgin Blue each held 49% ownership of the new airline with the remaining 2% held by a Samoan investment group. The government of Samoa cited rising operating costs for Polynesian Airlines, which accounted for more than half of the government&#x27;s annual budget, as one of the main reasons for suspending its international operations. However, Polynesian Airlines continued to operate turboprop flights in Samoa and American Samoa. In 2011, Virgin Blue announced a rebranding of its airline group, with its Samoan subsidiary being renamed &quot;Virgin Samoa&quot;.

In 2017, the Samoan government announced that it was closing down Virgin Samoa, citing a lack of competitive fare pricing and disappointing performance. In its place, Polynesian Airlines would resume international flights with the new name of &quot;Samoa Airways&quot;. The state-owned Samoa Airways partnered with Fiji Airways to assist with international flight operations, and wet-leased a Boeing 737-800 from Italian airline Neos in a deal brokered by Icelandair. International flights recommenced on 14 November 2017, with Samoa Airways flying from Apia to Auckland.

==Destinations==
, Samoa Airways operates to the following destinations (including former destinations):

===Codeshare agreements===
Samoa Airways has codeshare agreements with the following airlines: 
Fiji Airways

==Fleet==
The Samoa Airways fleet comprises the following aircraft as of August 2021:

A Boeing 737 MAX 9 was ordered and was to be delivered in April 2019, however the order was cancelled in the wake of the March 2019 worldwide Boeing 737 MAX groundings.

===Previously operated===
As Polynesian Airlines, the airline previously operated the following aircraft:

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 11 May 1966 at around 18:10 local time, the three crew members operating a Polynesian Airlines Douglas DC-3 with the registration 5W-FAB on training flight lost control of the aircraft over the Apolima Strait after the cabin entry door detached and hit the tail. The aircraft was on a training flight, the three crew members were the only people on board; all three were killed in the subsequent crash.
*On 13 January 1970 at 02:54 local time, Polynesian Airlines Flight 208B, which was operated by a Douglas DC-3D (registered 5W-FAC), crashed into the sea shortly after take-off from Faleolo International Airport on an international non-scheduled passenger flight to Pago Pago International Airport, American Samoa, killing the 29 passengers and three crew on board.
*On 20 August 1988, a Polynesian Airlines Britten-Norman BN-2A Islander (registered 5W-FAF) was damaged beyond repair when it overshot the runway upon landing at Asau Airport; there were no fatalities.
*On 13 September 1994, a Polynesian Airlines Boeing 737-3Q8 operating Flight PH844 from Fuaʻamotu International Airport to Faleolo International Airport discovered the body of a deceased male stowaway was jamming the starboard carriageway. At 6:00, after 3.5 hours of maneuvers attempting to dislodge the body, the flight made an emergency landing at Faleolo using only the nosewheel and port undercarriage. All 72 occupants survived with minimal damage to the aircraft. Eyewitness and author Ruperake Petaia wrote &quot;The Miracle&quot; based on a number of passenger accounts of the event.
*On 7 January 1997 at around 11:00 local time, a Polynesian Airlines de Havilland Canada DHC-6-300 Twin Otter crashed into Mount Vaea in Samoa during bad weather conditions, a so-called controlled flight into terrain. The aircraft had been operating Flight 211 from Pago Pago to Apia, when the pilots decided to divert to Faleolo Airport. In the crash, two of three passengers and one of the two pilots lost their lives.

<doc id="764476" wikidata="Q2465247" url="?curid=764476" title="Jigging">
<text>Jigging is the practice of fishing with a jig, a type of weighted fishing lure. A jig consists of a heavy metal (typically lead) sinker with an attached fish hook that is usually obscured inside a soft lure or feather-like decorations. Jigs are intended to create a jerky, vertical &quot;jumping&quot; motion to attract fish, as opposed to other common lures like swimbaits, spoons and spinnerbaits, which move through the water more or less horizontally. The jig is very versatile and can be used in both salt and fresh water. Many deeper water fish species are attracted to the lure, which has made it popular among anglers for years.

The jigging technique mainly involves rapid lifting motions of a fishing rod, which jerk the line exert a temporarily upward pull upon the sinking lure. When the target fish is enticed to swallow the lure, the angler then sets the hook to pierce and tether the fish in the mouth. Because the jigs are weighted, a harder-than-usual hookset is often needed to overcome the added weight and provide sufficient momentum to pierce the hook point into the fish mouth. Jigging gears are often involved with the luring of slow moving fish, most commonly during spawning periods. For successful jigging, the jigger needs to use a sensitive rod that is good for feeling a strike, and needs to stay in contact with the lure and get it to where the fish are. Most fish caught by jigs are on or near the bottom. 

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Jigging is a low-cost, low-energy technique that does not necessarily require a bait and its catch can be captured live and hauled into the fishing vessel. This method of fishing can be applied locally as well as at commercial levels. 

However, this technique of fishing is labour intensive and time consuming. Jigging also requires technical knowledge of an area so as to determine when and where it can be used, and some jigging machines are relatively expensive for the average person to purchase.

== Jighead ==

The weighted &quot;head&quot; of a jig, or jighead, can consist of many different shapes and colors along with different features. The simplest and most common is a round head, but others include fish head-shaped, coned-shaped, cylinder-shaped and hybrid varieties that resemble spoons or spinnerbaits. Most jigheads are integral to a large fish hook, and are most commonly used with soft plastic baits.

The three most popular jighead shapes in bass fishing are the flipping jighead, the football jighead, and the grass jighead. These come in many different weights usually ranging from for small freshwater panfishes (e.g. aji) to nearly for large saltwater groundfishes, and can also be found in a wide array of colors and patterns. The jig hooks also vary, with variances on the hook type, color, angle or build material. Some jigheads even offer a spring latch known as a &quot;weed guard&quot; to prevent unwanted snagging on aquatic plants/weeds and underwater structures by the hook point.

== Jig body ==

There is a wide array of bodies for jigs. The most common is made out of rubber or silicone. These come in many shapes and can resemble a grub, frog, fish, paddle tail, lizard, or different insects. The colors of these can range from bright yellow to a transparent brown with silver and red flakes. Also, during summer months look at colors for the heat such as browns, or blue with black hair. Many others catch fish like smallmouth bass and largemouth bass. Bait such as minnows, leeches or night crawlers can also be used as jig bodies. 

Other, more traditional types use dyed or natural whitetail deer tail hair on the outside. Called a bucktail jig, they are widely used in the northern and midwestern United States, where many are still hand tied by anglers.

Other types of materials are also used in constructing jig bodies, such as a Chenille wrap on the hook shaft, various feather hackle, hairs or other fur, marabou, Flashabou, and other materials. Construction is often similar to the process of Fly tying. Some jigs are constructed identically to their artificial fly counterparts, one example a &quot;Wooly Bugger&quot; fly but tied on a jig head.

Bodies can be either brightly colored or subdued. They are often designed to mimic local prey fish or large local insects.

<doc id="764477" wikidata="Q5128588" url="?curid=764477" title="Clatskanie River">
<text>The Clatskanie River is a tributary of the Columbia River, approximately long, in northwestern Oregon in the United States. It drains a timber-producing area in the foothills of the Northern Oregon Coast Range north-northwest of Portland.

It rises in eastern Columbia County, approximately west of St. Helens on the northern slopes of Bunker Hill. Major tributaries include Carcus Creek and the North Fork of the Clatskanie, which converge at Swedetown. The North Fork rises at Apiary. It flows generally north-northwest through the Clatsop State Forest, past Clatskanie. The Clatskanie River converges with Conyers Creek and Beaver Creek near Clatskanie and then it enters a slough on the Columbia from the south approximately east of Westport.

The river is named for the Tlatskanai, an Athabascan tribe of Native Americans who lived in the valley of the nearby Nehalem River at the time of the arrival of Europeans in the early 19th century. There is also a Klaskanine River in Clatsop County which was really named for the same reason. The names as used by the natives did not apply to the respective rivers, but applied to the path, route or trail by which one could get to the customary tribal area of the Tlatskanai.

==Tributaries==

<text>Perdido Street Station is a novel by British writer China Miéville, published in 2000 by Macmillan. Often described as weird fiction, it is set in a world where both magic and steampunk technology exist. It won the Arthur C. Clarke Award and was ranked by &quot;Locus&quot; as the 6th all-time best fantasy novel published in the 20th century.
&quot;Perdido Street Station&quot; is the first of three independent works set in the fictional world of Bas-Lag, and is followed by &quot;The Scar&quot; and &quot;Iron Council&quot;.

==Background==
&quot;Perdido Street Station&quot; is set in the fictional world of Bas-Lag, in the large city-state of New Crobuzon; the title refers to a railway station at the heart of the city. Miéville described the book as &quot;basically a secondary world fantasy with Victorian era technology. So rather than being a feudal world, it&#x27;s an early industrial capitalist world of a fairly grubby, police statey kind!&quot;

The book was published simultaneously in the UK and Australia in March 2000 by Macmillan. The UK edition was a hardcover, while the Australian version was a trade paperback; it featured a cover by Edward Miller and was marketed as a dark fantasy novel. A US paperback followed in March 2001 from Ballantine Del Rey.

==Plot==
Isaac Dan der Grimnebulin is a scientist living in the city of New Crobuzon. He is approached by Yagharek, a member of a birdlike species known as garuda, who has had his wings removed as a punishment for an undisclosed crime in his native land. He asks Isaac to help him to fly again. Isaac agrees and starts collecting flying creatures for research purposes with the aid of Lemuel Pigeon, a fence with links to the criminal underworld. One creature is a large and unusual caterpillar, stolen from a government research lab. The caterpillar sickens until Isaac accidentally discovers it feeds on a popular hallucinogenic drug. It grows and starts to pupate. After reaching maturity, it emerges as a monstrous flying beast known as a slakemoth, able to paralyse its victims using hypnotic patterns on its wings. It escapes after eating the mind of one of Isaac&#x27;s colleagues, leaving him catatonic. Isaac, Yagharek and Lemuel resolve to re-capture or destroy it.

Isaac&#x27;s girlfriend Lin is a khepri, an insect-like humanoid and an artist. She is commissioned by Mr Motley, a mob boss, to make a sculpture of him. Mr. Motley has four more of the slakemoths in captivity and harvests their milk to sell as drugs. After Isaac&#x27;s slakemoth frees its siblings, Mr Motley discovers Isaac&#x27;s connection to the slakemoths. Assuming Isaac to be a potential rival in the drug trade, he imprisons Lin, demanding that Isaac return his creatures. The slakemoths start to terrorise New Crobuzon, feeding on its inhabitants.

With the aid of Derkhan, a journalist and friend of Lin, Isaac discovers that Mr. Motley purchased his slakemoths from the government. The government become aware of the activities of the slakemoths and begin to suppress the various rebellious elements within the city. To re-capture the slakemoths, they attempt to enlist the help of demons and the Weaver, a spider-like creature who moves through dimensions, obsessed with patterns and its own peculiar view of beauty. The demons refuse to assist and the Weaver soon ends up aiding Isaac.

Isaac and his friends kill one of the slakemoths with the aid of a sentient machine known as the Construct Council. They then destroy the eggs that the slakemoths have laid before laying a trap for the remainder of the creatures. The trap is mostly successful, but the last slakemoth escapes and returns &#x27;home&#x27; to Mr. Motley&#x27;s facility. The Weaver transports Isaac to the warehouse where they find Lin, who has been tortured but is still working on the sculpture. A confrontation occurs, during which Lin&#x27;s mind is half eaten and the last slakemoth is killed by Mr. Motley&#x27;s men. Isaac escapes with Lin and Yagharek and prepares to leave the city. Isaac learns of Yagharek&#x27;s crime, a rape of one of his own species, and declines to help him fly again. Lin never fully recovers and Yagharek is left alone in the city, pulling out his feathers and having to accept his new flightless identity.

==Characters==

*The Weaver, a multi-dimensional being in the form of a giant spider, who speaks in a never-ending torrent of free-verse poetry.

==Reception==
Michael Moorcock, reviewing the book for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, called it &quot;a massive and gorgeously detailed parallel-world fantasy&quot; with &quot;a range of rather more exotic creatures, all of whom are wonderfully drawn,&quot; and praised Mieville as &quot;a writer with a rare descriptive gift, an unusually observant eye for physical detail, for the sensuality and beauty of the ordinarily human as well as the thoroughly alien.&quot; However, he suggests &quot;Mieville&#x27;s determination to deliver value for money, a great page-turner, leads him to add genre borrowings which set up a misleading expectation of the kind of plot you&#x27;re going to get and make individuals start behaving out of character, forcing the author into rationalisations at odds with the creative, intellectual and imaginative substance of the book.&quot; The novel was listed as an Amazon.com Editors&#x27; Choice Book in fantasy in 2001. In May 2009, it was made available as an audiobook from Random House.

==Awards==
&quot;Perdido Street Station&quot; was nominated for numerous prizes spanning the genres of science fiction and fantasy for instance, both the British Fantasy Award and British Science Fiction Association Award and won several honours, as detailed in the following table. It was also featured in &quot;Locus&quot; poll of all-time best 20th century fantasy novels, where it ranked 6th place.

<text>Ben Travers (12 November 188618 December 1980) was an English writer. His output includes more than 20 plays, 30 screenplays, 5 novels, and 3 volumes of memoirs. He is most notable for his long-running series of farces first staged in the 1920s and 1930s at the Aldwych Theatre. Many of these were made into films and later television productions.

After working for some years in his family&#x27;s wholesale grocery business, which he detested, Travers was given a job by the publisher John Lane in 1911. After service as a pilot in the First World War, he began to write novels and plays. He turned his 1921 novel, &quot;The Dippers&quot;, into a play that was first produced in the West End in 1922. His big break came in 1925, when the actor-manager Tom Walls bought the performing rights to his play &quot;A Cuckoo in the Nest&quot;, which ran for more than a year at the Aldwych. He followed this success with eight more farces for Walls and his team; the last in the series closed in 1933. Most of the farces were adapted for film in the 1930s and 1940s, with Travers writing the screenplays for eight of them.

After the Aldwych series came to a close, in 1935 Travers wrote a serious play with a religious theme. It was unsuccessful, and he returned to comedy. Of his later farces only one, &quot;Banana Ridge&quot; (1938), rivalled the runs of his 1920s hits; it was filmed in 1942. During the Second World War Travers served in the Royal Air Force, working in intelligence, and later served at the Ministry of Information, while producing two well-received plays.

Due to the war and the death of his wife, Ben had a fallow period, although he collaborated on a few revivals and adaptations of his earlier work. He returned to playwriting in 1968. He was inspired to write a new comedy in the early 1970s after the abolition of theatre censorship in Britain permitted him to write without evasion about sexual activities, one of his favourite topics. The resulting play, &quot;The Bed Before Yesterday&quot; (1975), presented when he was 89, was the longest-running of all his stage works, easily outplaying any of his Aldwych farces.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Travers was born in the London borough of Hendon, the elder son and the second of the three children of Walter Francis Travers, a merchant, and his wife, Margaret Burges. He was educated at the Abbey School, Beckenham, and at Charterhouse. He did not greatly enjoy his schooldays and later declared that he had been &quot;a complete failure at school&quot;. The only thing he enjoyed there was cricket, for which he had a lifelong enthusiasm, later writing a memoir focusing on his passion for the game, &quot;Ninety-four Declared: Cricket Reminiscences&quot;. When he was nine, his father took him to the Ashes match at the Oval. Eighty years later he recalled watching W. G. Grace and F. S. Jackson opening the batting for England with Ranjitsinhji coming in first wicket down: &quot;I remember when Ranji came in to bat the crowd started singing; I think he only made 7; it was a very low scoring match.&quot;
Travers left Charterhouse in 1904 and was sent by his parents to live in Dresden, for a few months, to learn German. While he was there he saw performances by the leading French actors Sarah Bernhardt in &quot;La Tosca&quot;, and Lucien Guitry in &quot;Les affaires sont les affaires&quot;, which inspired him with a passion for the theatre. His parents were unimpressed by his ambition to become an actor; he was sent into the family business, the long-established wholesale grocery firm Joseph Travers &amp; Sons Ltd, of which his father was a director. He found commercial life tedious and incomprehensible: &quot;I had no more idea what it was all about then than I have now and vice versa.&quot; He served first at the firm&#x27;s head office in Cannon Street in the City of London, which was dominated by dauntingly-bearded Victorian patriarchs. From there, to his and the patriarchs&#x27; relief, he was soon transferred to the company&#x27;s offices in Singapore and then Malacca.

While at the Malacca outpost Travers had little work and much leisure; in the local library he found a complete set of the plays of Pinero. He later said he fell on them with rapturous excitement and found each volume &quot;a guidebook to the technique of stagecraft.&quot; They rekindled his interest in the theatre, his earlier wish to be an actor now overtaken by his determination to be a dramatist. He later told Pinero that he had learnt more from him than from all other playwrights put together. His greatest lesson from Pinero was that &quot;however absurd the incidents of a play they had to arise from a basis of reality. The people should never be mere grotesques. Ideally they should be as matter-of-fact – or apparently so – as the people across the road.&quot;

In 1908, after the death of his mother, Travers returned to London to keep his father company. He endured his work at the family firm for three more years until, in 1911, he met the publisher John Lane of the Bodley Head, who offered him a job as a publisher&#x27;s reader. Lane&#x27;s firm had been in existence for a little over twenty years and had an &quot;avant garde&quot; reputation; among Lane&#x27;s first publications were &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; and Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot;. Travers worked for Lane for three years, during which he accompanied his employer on business trips to the US and Canada.

On the outbreak of the First World War, Travers joined the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). His service was eventful. He crashed several times and narrowly failed to shoot down a Zeppelin. He became a squadron commander, and when the RNAS merged with the Royal Flying Corps he transferred to the new Royal Air Force with the rank of major in 1918. He served in south Russia during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, in 1919, and received the Air Force Cross in 1920.

In April 1916 Travers married Violet Mouncey (d. 1951), the only child of Captain D. W B. Mouncey, of the Leicestershire Regiment, and granddaughter of Sir James Longden.

===Novelist and playwright===

With the security of his wife&#x27;s income, Travers determined to earn his living as a writer when he was demobilised from the RAF. He and his wife settled in Somerset, and he started to write. His first attempt was a farce about a lawyer who finds himself mistaken at a country house full of strangers for half of a husband-and-wife jazz dance act. While writing it he decided to turn it into a novel, &quot;The Dippers&quot;, which was accepted by John Lane and published in 1921. The reviews were good. The &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; noted &quot;an amount of clever writing and character study that the humorous novel rarely gets … as clever a piece of comedy as we have read for some time&quot;. Travers then turned the novel back into a farce and sent it to the actor-manager Sir Charles Hawtrey. After a tour that included eight large towns and cities, Hawtrey brought the play into the West End in 1922. The reviews were mixed: &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; praised the piece, and its star Cyril Maude; &quot;The Observer&quot; was scathing about both. &quot;The Times&quot; considered the play &quot;neatly contrived and often brilliantly phrased&quot; and praised the cast and the author – &quot;such good company and in a play so amusing&quot;. The play had a moderately successful London run of 173 performances. Travers&#x27;s next stage work was less successful: he wrote an English adaptation of Franz Lehár&#x27;s 1923 operetta &quot;Der Libellentanz&quot;. The music received mild praise, but the libretto did not. The piece ran for just over three months.
Travers followed &quot;The Dippers&quot; with another farcical novel, &quot;A Cuckoo in the Nest&quot;, published in 1922. Again reviewers praised its humour, and again Travers turned it into a playscript. The actor Lawrence Grossmith spotted the dramatic possibilities of this story, and he acquired the performing rights to the play. Before Grossmith had time to produce the piece, he had an offer from the actor-manager Tom Walls to buy the rights. Walls was in need of a replacement for his current hit farce, &quot;It Pays to Advertise&quot;, which was nearing the end of a long run at the Aldwych Theatre.

===Aldwych farces===

With Travers&#x27;s agreement, Grossmith sold the rights to &quot;A Cuckoo in the Nest&quot; to Walls, and the play opened at the Aldwych in July 1925. The leading lady was Yvonne Arnaud, and the two leading men were Walls and Ralph Lynn. They were supported by a team of players who became part of a regular company at the Aldwych for the rest of the 1920s and into the 1930s: Robertson Hare, Mary Brough and Gordon James, joined in subsequent productions by Winifred Shotter (in place of Arnaud) and Ethel Coleridge. The play was an immediate success and ran for 376 performances.
During the next seven years there were ten more Aldwych farces; Travers wrote eight of them: &quot;Rookery Nook&quot; (1926), &quot;Thark&quot; (1927), &quot;Plunder&quot; (1928), &quot;A Cup of Kindness&quot; (1929), &quot;A Night Like This&quot; (1930), &quot;Turkey Time&quot; (1931), &quot;Dirty Work&quot; (1932), and &quot;A Bit of a Test&quot; (1933). It took Travers some time to establish a satisfactory working relationship with Walls, whom he found difficult as a manager and distressingly unprepared as an actor. In the early days he also had reservations about the other star of the company, Ralph Lynn, who initially ad-libbed too much for the author&#x27;s taste. Travers noted that the ad-libbing diminished as he came to anticipate and include in his scripts &quot;the sort of thing Ralph himself would have said in the circumstances&quot;. Though the main parts in the Aldwych plays were written to fit the members of the regular company, Travers varied their roles to avoid monotony. He also varied the themes of his plots. &quot;Thark&quot; was a spoof of haunted house melodramas; &quot;Plunder&quot; featured burglary and violent death (in a way that pre-echoed Joe Orton), &quot;A Cup of Kindness&quot; was what he called &quot;a Romeo and Juliet story of the suburbs&quot;; and &quot;A Bit of a Test&quot; had a cricketing theme at the time of the controversial &quot;Bodyline&quot; series.

Travers&#x27;s biographer H Montgomery Hyde records that between 1926 and 1932 the Aldwych box office grossed £1,500,000 in receipts, and the aggregate number of performances of the nine Travers farces totalled nearly 2,700. During the 1930s, film versions of ten of the twelve Aldwych farces were made, mostly directed by Walls. Travers wrote the screenplays for eight of them.

===Later 1930s===

After the Aldwych series finished Travers wrote his first serious play, &quot;Chastity, my Brother&quot; (1936), based on the life of St Paul. To his sadness, it ran for only two weeks. No author was named for the piece, but it was an open secret that Travers was the author. &quot;The Times&quot; dismissed it on those grounds; Ivor Brown in &quot;The Observer&quot; congratulated Travers and deplored the snobbish suggestion that a writer of successful farces could have nothing of value to say on religious matters. All his life Travers held strong religious views and was a regular communicant of the Church of England; his views on chastity, however, were unorthodox: &quot;sex is nature&#x27;s act – God&#x27;s will&quot;, and he admitted to wholesale promiscuity.

After the failure of &quot;Chastity, my Brother&quot;, Travers returned to comedy, though not immediately to farce. Later in 1936 his &quot;O Mistress Mine&quot; was a light Ruritanian vehicle for Yvonne Printemps. He returned to farce with &quot;Banana Ridge&quot; (1938) in which Robertson Hare starred with Alfred Drayton. It was set in Malaya, and turned on which of two middle-aged pillars of Empire was the father of the young hero. Travers himself played the part of Wun, a servant; his lines in colloquial Malay, remembered from his Malacca days, were improvised and sometimes took his colleagues by surprise. The play ran for 291 performances, bettering the runs of the last six Aldwych farces.

===Second World War and postwar===
During the Second World War Travers rejoined the RAF, working in intelligence. He was given the rank of Squadron leader and was later attached to the Ministry of Information as air adviser on censorship. He had two plays staged during the war. &quot;Spotted Dick&quot; (1939), again starring Hare and Drayton, was a farce about insurance fraud. &quot;She Follows Me About&quot; (1943) had Hare as a harried vicar coping with mischievous Waafs and a bogus bishop. &quot;The Observer&quot; commented, &quot;the third act is a tumultuous affair, with all four doors and a staircase in action at once.&quot;

In the postwar years Travers wrote a new farce for Lynn and Hare. &quot;Outrageous Fortune&quot; was described by &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; as &quot;an elaborate tangle about stolen ration cards and a Hertfordshire manor house and country police ... very laughable in its own way.&quot; In 1951 Travers wrote another farce for Lynn and Hare, &quot;Wild Horses&quot;, about the ownership of a valuable picture. It was his last new play for more than a decade. In 1951 Violet Travers died of cancer. Travers felt the bereavement deeply. In Hyde&#x27;s words, Travers lost most of his old zest for writing and spent more and more time in travelling and staying with friends in Malaya. &quot;She Follows Me About&quot; was revived at the Aldwych in 1952, and a revised version of &quot;O Mistress Mine&quot; was staged in the provinces in 1953 as &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Unveiling&quot;. Travers collaborated on the screenplay of &quot;Fast and Loose&quot; (1954), based on &quot;A Cuckoo in the Nest&quot;.

===Last years===
In 1968 Travers returned to playwriting with a new farce, &quot;Corker&#x27;s End&quot;, which was produced at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, Guildford. &quot;The Times&quot; commented, &quot;Some of his jokes, which always tended to be outrageous, are perhaps a little more outspoken than they used to be, but nothing essential has changed. Those who care for farce will enjoy themselves for exactly that reason.&quot; In 1970 BBC television broadcast seven Travers plays: &quot;Rookery Nook&quot;, &quot;A Cuckoo in the Nest&quot;, &quot;Turkey Time&quot;, &quot;A Cup of Kindness&quot;, &quot;Plunder&quot;, &quot;Dirty Work&quot; and &quot;She Follows Me About&quot;. At the age of 83 Travers rewrote the plays for the BBC to concentrate on plot twists and verbal misunderstandings, rather than the high-speed action and split-second timing that characterised the original stage versions.

After the abolition in 1968 of theatre censorship in Britain, Travers was for the first time able to write about sexual matters without discreet allusion or innuendo. &quot;The Bed Before Yesterday&quot; (1975) depicts a middle-aged woman discovering the pleasure of sex, to the consternation of some who know her and the delight of others. Joan Plowright played the central character with John Moffatt, Helen Mirren and Royce Mills in the main supporting roles. It received enthusiastic notices and ran for more than 500 performances, far outstripping the original runs of any of Travers&#x27;s Aldwych farces.

In his ninetieth year Travers had the uncommon distinction of having three of his plays running simultaneously in London; as well as &quot;The Bed Before Yesterday&quot; at the Lyric, there were revivals of &quot;Plunder&quot; at the National with Frank Finlay and Dinsdale Landen, and &quot;Banana Ridge&quot; at the Savoy with Robert Morley and George Cole. He wrote two further plays, &quot;After You with the Milk&quot; and &quot;Malacca Linda&quot;, in which he revisited the colonial Malaya of his youth. At 2013 neither has been staged in the West End.

Travers died in London at the age of 94.

Travers served as prime warden of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers (1946) and as vice-president of Somerset County Cricket Club. He received the CBE in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, 1976. In the same year he was presented with a Special Award at the Evening Standard Awards for his services to the theatre.

A theatre named in Travers&#x27;s honour has been built at his old school, Charterhouse. Travers laid the foundation stone in 1980, and the first production in the completed theatre was &quot;Thark&quot; in January 1984.

<doc id="764501" wikidata="Q1857559" url="?curid=764501" title="Modacrylic">
<text>A modacrylic is a synthetic copolymer. Modacrylics are soft, strong, resilient and dimensionally stable. They can be easily dyed, show good press and shape retention, and are quick to dry. They have outstanding resistance to chemicals and solvents, are not attacked by moths or mildew, and are nonallergenic. Among their uses are in apparel linings, furlike outerwear, paint-roller covers, scatter rugs, carpets, and work clothing and as hair in wigs.

Commercial production of modacrylic fiber began in 1949 by Union Carbide Corporation in the United States. Modacrylic and acrylic fibers are similar in composition and at one time were in the same category. In 1960 the Federal Trade Commission decided to separate the two fibers and establish a category for each.

The Federal Trade Commission defines modacrylic fibers as manufactured fibers in which the fiber-forming substance is any long-chain synthetic polymer composed of less than 85%, but at least 35% weight acrylonitrile units except when the polymer qualifies as rubber.

==Production==

Modacrylic fibers are modified acrylic fibers made from acrylonitriles, but larger amounts of other polymers are added to make the copolymers.

The modacrylic fibers are produced by polymerizing the components, dissolving the copolymer in acetone, pumping the solution into the column of warm air (dry-spun), and stretching while hot.

Modacrylics are creamy or white and are produced in tow and staple form. If looked at in cross section views they have an irregular shape. Modacrylic fibers are also produced in many different lengths, crimp levels, deniers and they can have various shrinkage potentials.

Current modacrylic fiber producers include Kaneka Corporation in Japan.

==Properties==

A modacrylic has properties that are similar to an acrylic. However, modacrylics are flame retardant and do not combust. The fibers are difficult to ignite and will self-extinguish. In addition to a modacrylic&#x27;s flame retardant properties it has a relatively high durability that is comparable to wool. Modacrylic fibers have a moderate resistance to abrasion and a very low tenacity.

One of the most interesting properties of Modacrylic fabrics is the arc flash protection, where it has very good values.

Modacrylics are poor conductors of heat. The fabrics are soft, warm and resilient but are prone to pilling and matting. Modacrylics display high performance when it comes to appearance retention. The fibers are quite resilient and will not wrinkle. They also have great dimensional stability and high elastic recovery, which gives them the ability to hold their shape.

==Care==

Modacrylics are sensitive to loss of appearance due to improper care; therefore, it is important to know how to care for modacrylics. Modacrylics are resistant to acids, weak alkalis, and organic solvents. These fibers are also resistant to moths, mildew and sunlight. Modacrylic fabrics can be machine washed using warm water and tumble dried on a low setting. Modacrylic pieces can also be dry-cleaned, however, they should not be steamed and should only be tumbled on cold. Some fabrics may also be cleaned using the furrier method (a special non immersion cleaning process). The fibers are heat sensitive and will shrink at and will stiffen at temperatures over .

==Uses==

Modacrylics are used by producers of technically advanced fabrics for comfortable and protective blends often used in personal protective equipment, primarily when environmental resistance or flame retardancy is necessary or required. Modacrylics can combine flame retardancy with a relatively low density, keeping protective gear from being uncomfortably heavy (i.e. shirts and trousers worn by electrical linemen). The combination of flame retardancy and low density is also useful in furnishings, draperies, and outdoor fabrics.

Modacrylics are also commonly used in fake fur fabrics, toupées, wigs and fleece-type fabric. By mixing the various forms of fibers one can easily create a realistic synthetic fur. The fabrics can then be sheared or embossed to resemble fur even more closely. The heat-sensitivity of modacrylic also allows wigs and hairpieces to be curled and heat styled without damage.

Modacrylics are also used in fleece, knit-pile fabric backings, and nonwoven fabrics. Other uses of modacrylics include paint rollers, industrial fabrics, stuffed toys and filters.

<text>Royal Tongan Airlines was the national airline of Tonga until liquidation in 2004. It was a government agency and operated interisland services and international routes.

==History==

===Formative years===
In 1983 a feasibility study was undertaken by All Nippon Airways to investigate the setting up of a Tongan airline. It was planned for Friendly Island Airways to begin operations in October 1984, with technical and managerial assistance provided by the Japanese airline, and for the airline to operate a surplus ANA Boeing 737-200. The plan was dropped in favour of Tongan participation in Air Nauru, which was expected to take delivery of a third Fokker F28 and was also expected to extend the Nauru-Apia route to Tonga. At the time, flights between Apia and Tonga were operated exclusively by Polynesian Airlines.

In 1985, King of Tonga Taufa&#x27;ahau Tupou IV visited the British Aerospace factory in Woodford, leading to hopes with the manufacturer that Tonga would purchase the British Aerospace ATP. However, the government of Tonga and the Tonga Commodities Board purchased a CASA 212 and Britten Norman Islander with which domestic flights could be started. Flights to Pago Pago (American Samoa) and Apia (Western Samoa) were begun with the CASA in 1986. As airfields in Vavaʻu, Haʻapai, ʻEua and the Niuas were upgraded, the airline upgraded the inter-island aircraft. In 1989 the airline leased two de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters to replace the CASA and Islander, and after the initial lease period, purchased the aircraft from the lessor, Guinness Peat Aviation. In June 1991, the name was changed from Friendly Island Airways to Royal Tongan Airlines, and international services were begun with a Boeing 737-200 which was leased from Solomon Airlines from Tongatapu to Auckland, New Zealand. The airline was considering acquiring a Douglas DC-8 in order to operate flights to Australia, New Zealand and Honolulu, however this didn&#x27;t eventuate and in 1994 the airline entered into a codeshare agreement with Polynesian Airlines on routes to Sydney, Honolulu and Los Angeles.

In June 1995, an agreement was signed with Air Pacific, which saw the lease-sharing of a Boeing 737-300 operated on Royal Tongan routes. The airline also gained approval from the Australian government to carry passengers on its Sydney-Auckland-Tonga route. In 1996 the airline opened an office in Honolulu, and began codesharing on Air New Zealand flights from Tongatapu to the Hawaiian capital. On 28 October 1997, a codeshare agreement with Polynesian Airlines was begun. The agreement signed in early October 1997, saw Polynesian Airlines extending its Apia-Wellington-Melbourne flights to operate Apia-Tonga-Wellington-Melbourne. The agreement was a continuation of efforts by airlines in the South Pacific to pool their limited resources to maximise their services. By 1998, at the age of 37, Silva McLeod,Tonga&#x27;s first woman pilot, was working full time as a captain for them.

Direct flights between Tongatapu and Sydney were announced in April 1999 as part of a Tongan initiative to increase tourist numbers from Australia. The once-weekly flights, the first by a Tongan airline to Australia, were operated by a chartered Air Pacific Boeing 737.

===International expansion===
A delegation from the government of Niue travelled to Tonga to try to persuade Royal Tongan to continue flying to Niue from Tonga past 28 October 2002; that date on which the flights were to cease, and Polynesian Airlines would begin jet service to Auckland. Royal Tongan told the Niuean government that it could no longer justify the service.

In 2002, the airline leased a Boeing 757 from Royal Brunei Airlines in order to restart international flights. The deal saw the aircraft being leased for a period of five years, initially as a wet lease later to be changed to a dry lease. Prince Tuʻipelehake, and a majority of Tongan MPs, opposed the government giving Royal Tongan financial support with public funds due to the high levels of debt the airline was already in.

Royal Tongan service of the 757, nicknamed &quot;&#x27;Ikale Tahi&quot;, was inaugurated at Fuaʻamotu International Airport on 23 November 2002, with thrice-weekly flights from Tongatapu to Auckland, with a once-a-week extension to Sydney.
In 2003 it obtained its own air operator&#x27;s certificate with a view to launching flights to Honolulu. On 19 December, the airline was due to launch a once-weekly direct flight from Tongatapu to Honolulu, marking the entry of the airline in the American market.

The Director of the Tongan Human Rights and Democracy Movement claimed the restructuring of the airline suffered from a lack of transparency. Lopeti Senituli noted that Tongan Prime Minister Prince ʻUlukālala Lavaka Ata wrote to the board of Royal Tongan Airline and instructed them to resign. At the same time, he noted that Shoreline, a company owned by the prince, had expressed an interest in taking over the airline.

The airline commissioned KPMG to review the airline&#x27;s financial position, and in November 2003 the report by the accounting firm concluded that the airline was nearly insolvent and that too few passengers were flying on the airline&#x27;s international routes. The review found that Royal Tongan had lost US$5.5 million in the first nine months of its international operations. It was also determined that whilst Royal Tongan expected a 65% load factor on these flights, the actual figure was closer to 34%. In dismissing KPMG&#x27;s review, CEO Logan Appu, stated that the airline would continue to operate internationally, and confirmed that the airline would begin flights to Honolulu in December 2003, in spite of the report recommending that Royal Tongan ditch the international flights and concentrate only on domestic services. People&#x27;s Representative Feleti Sevele noted that report suggested that the government would need to inject US$10 million into the airline, whilst the entire Tongan budget is only US$50 million.

The introduction of flights by Royal Tongan to Rarotonga sparked a price war with Air New Zealand. Five night packages to Rarotonga before Royal Tongan entered the scene cost approximately NZ$1299, and after the airline entered the market prices dropped to NZ$829–$899 for seven night packages.

===Towards liquidation===
The airline stopped selling international flights on 23 April 2004, and announced that the last international flight would leave Tongatapu for Auckland the following day, whereby the Boeing 757 was repossessed for non-payment and returned to Royal Brunei Airlines. Whilst airline management provided no reasons for the cessation of international flights, it was believed to be linked to the funding crisis which was being experienced by the state-owned airline. After the closure, Tonga was reliant on Air New Zealand, Air Pacific, Air Fiji and Polynesian Airlines for international air services. The cessation of international flights also had the side effect of stranding mail being sent to Tonga in Auckland, up to a month afterwards, due to limited cargo space being available on the Air New Zealand flights to the nation, and in late May it was reported that the nation had not received mail for a week.

Akilisi Pohiva, a pro-democracy member of Tonga&#x27;s parliament blamed King Taufa&#x27;ahau Tupou IV for the financial crisis of the airline, and called on the king to use his own funds to bail Royal Tongan out of its financial woes. He noted that the Tupou had issued a royal decree for the 757 project to proceed, despite opposition from the cabinet and parliament, and claimed that the monarchy is not accountable to the public.

On 18 May 2004, the airline ceased all operations with the remaining one hundred employees losing their jobs, and the islands of Tonga being left without domestic air service. The closure was forced as the airline&#x27;s only airworthy aircraft, the Shorts 360, broke down and the airline had no funds with which to repair it. Airline administration was hoping that the government would bail it out, but this did not eventuate.

In discussing the sending of Australian and New Zealand specialists to Tonga, to help the government wind up the airline, Phil Goff, the New Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs stated &quot;lessons can be learned from how and why the RTA collapsed.&quot; The Tongan government confirmed that it had a financial commitment in the airline to the value of 14 million Tongan paʻanga, and had pumped some 20 million paʻanga into the airline since its inception in 1985.

In July 2004 PricewaterhouseCoopers found that the only substantial remaining assets of the company were a hangar and the two aircraft. It recommended that the aircraft be repaired and sold. By December 2004, it was reported that creditors had lodged claims of US$8.5 million from the liquidators, but had recovered only US$1.13 million from the sale of assets. PricewaterCoopers also noted that only 106 of 206 former employees of the airline had thus far lodged claims. The Twin Otter was sold in January 2005 for US$850,000, and the sale of assets from the airline&#x27;s offices in Nukuʻalofa and abroad netted US$71,000 and US$8,000 respectively.

In the absence of domestic flights in Tonga, by June 2004 Air Waves of Vava&#x27;u and Fly Niu Airlines had begun operations on some of the former Royal Tongan routes.

== Destinations ==
Royal Tongan mainly operated domestic flights linking all the major islands the capital Nukuʻalofa. The airline also operated a number of international destinations, linking Nukuʻalofa to some 6 international points.

<text>Maria Augusta von Trapp DHS (; 26 January 1905 – 28 March 1987), often styled as &quot;Baroness&quot;, was the stepmother and matriarch of the Trapp Family Singers. She wrote &quot;The Story of the Trapp Family Singers&quot;, which was published in 1949 and was the inspiration for the 1956 West German film &quot;The Trapp Family&quot;, which in turn inspired the 1959 Broadway musical &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and its 1965 film version.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Maria was purportedly born on 26 January 1905 to Karl and Augusta (&quot;née&quot; Rainer) Kuczera. She says she was delivered on a train on the night of the 25th, during her mother&#x27;s return from her homeland of Tyrol to their family residence in Vienna, Austria. She was baptized into the Catholic Church on the 29th within the Alservorstadt parish and maternity hospital.

Her father was a hotel commissionaire, born in Vienna, the son of Josef Kučera from a Moravian village, Vídeň. Karl was first married in Graz to Klara Rainer in 1887. The couple had a son Karl in 1888 before Klara&#x27;s death a few months later. Maria&#x27;s father remained a widower until he remarried to Klara&#x27;s younger sister, Augusta, in 1903. Augusta died of pulmonary tuberculosis when Maria was nearly 10 months old. Maria&#x27;s grief-stricken father left her with his cousin (and foster mother) in Kagran, who also cared for Maria&#x27;s half-brother Karl after his mother Klara had died. Maria&#x27;s father then traveled the world, although Maria would visit him upon occasion at his apartment in Vienna. He changed the spelling of their surname to &quot;Kutschera&quot; in 1914, dying at home later that year. Her foster mother&#x27;s son-in-law, Uncle Franz, then became her guardian.

Uncle Franz maltreated Maria and punished her for things she did not do; he was later found to be mentally ill. This changed Maria from a shy child into the teenage &quot;class cut-up&quot;, figuring she may as well have fun if she was going to get in trouble either way. Despite this change, Maria continued to get good grades.

After graduating from high school at 15, Maria ran away to stay with a friend, with the intent to become a tutor for children staying at nearby hotels. Because she looked so young, no one took her seriously. Finally, a hotel manager asked her to be umpire for a tennis tournament. Although she did not know what an umpire was and had never played tennis, she took the job.

From this job, she saved enough money to enter the State Teachers College for Progressive Education in Vienna, where she also received a scholarship. She graduated from there at age 18 in 1923.

In 1924, she entered Nonnberg Abbey, a Benedictine monastery in Salzburg, as a postulant, intending to become a nun.

===Marriage===
While still teaching at the Abbey in 1926, Maria was asked to teach Maria Franziska von Trapp, one of seven children born to widowed naval commander Georg von Trapp. His first wife, the Anglo-Austrian heiress Agathe Whitehead, had earlier died in 1922 from scarlet fever. Eventually, Maria began to look after the other children: Rupert, Agathe, Werner, Hedwig, Johanna, and Martina.

Captain von Trapp saw how much she cared about his children and asked her to marry him, although he was 25 years her senior. Frightened, she fled back to Nonnberg Abbey to seek guidance from the mother abbess, Virgilia Lütz, who advised her it was God&#x27;s will that she should marry him. She then returned to the family and accepted his proposal. She wrote in her autobiography that she was very angry on her wedding day, both at God and at her new husband, because she really wanted to be a nun. &quot;I really and truly was not in love. I liked him but didn&#x27;t love him. However, I loved the children, so in a way I really married the children. I learned to love him more than I have ever loved before or after.&quot; They married at Nonnberg Abbey on 26 November 1927 and had three children together: Rosmarie (1929–2022), Eleonore (&quot;Lorli&quot;) (1931–2021) and Johannes (born 1939).

=== Medical problems ===
The von Trapps enjoyed hiking. On one outing, they stayed overnight at a farmer&#x27;s house. The next morning, they were informed that Maria and two of Georg&#x27;s daughters, Johanna and Martina, had scarlet fever. Johanna and Martina recovered, but the older Maria developed kidney stones due to dehydration. Her stepdaughter, Maria Franziska, accompanied her to Vienna for a successful surgery, but Maria experienced lifelong kidney problems.

=== Financial problems ===
The family met with financial ruin in 1935. Georg had transferred his savings from a bank in London to an Austrian bank run by a friend named Auguste Caroline Lammer. Austria was experiencing economic difficulties during a worldwide depression because of the Crash of 1929, and Lammer&#x27;s bank failed. To survive, the Trapps dismissed most of their servants, moved into the top floor of their house, and rented out the other rooms. The Archbishop of Salzburg, Sigismund Waitz, sent Father Franz Wasner to stay with them as their chaplain and this began their singing career.

=== Early musical career and departure from Austria ===
Soprano Lotte Lehmann heard the family sing, and she suggested they perform at concerts. When the Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg heard them over the radio, he invited them to perform in Vienna.

After performing at a festival in 1935, they became a popular touring act. They experienced life under the Nazis after the annexation of Austria by Germany in March 1938. Life became increasingly difficult as they witnessed hostility toward Jewish children by their classmates, the use of children against their parents, and finally by the extension of an offer for Georg to join the German Navy. Maria&#x27;s doctor also encouraged her to abort a fetus considered unviable due to her physical condition, the child later being born and named Johannes von Trapp. They visited Munich in the summer of 1938 and encountered Hitler at a restaurant, Maria later recounting that &quot;For … forty minutes we had a first-class opportunity to look at the Messiah of the Third Reich … One couldn&#x27;t stand it too long, however. Knowing who he was, it was too depressing.&quot; In September, the family fled Austria for Italy via train, then to England and finally the United States. The Nazis made use of their abandoned home as Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s headquarters.

Initially calling themselves the &quot;Trapp Family Choir&quot;, the von Trapps began to perform in the United States and Canada. They performed in New York City at The Town Hall on 10 December 1938. The &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote:

There was something unusually lovable and appealing about the modest, serious singers of this little family aggregation as they formed a close semicircle about their self-effacing director for their initial offering, the handsome Mme. von Trapp in simple black, and the youthful sisters garbed in black and white Austrian folk costumes enlivened with red ribbons. It was only natural to expect work of exceeding refinement from them, and one was not disappointed in this.
Charles Wagner was their first booking agent, then they signed on with Frederick Christian Schang. Thinking the name &quot;Trapp Family Choir&quot; too churchy, Schang Americanized their repertoire and, following his suggestion, the group changed its name to the &quot;Trapp Family Singers&quot;. The family, which by then included all ten children, was soon touring the world giving concert performances. Alix Williamson served as the group&#x27;s publicist for over two decades. After the war, they founded the Trapp Family Austrian Relief fund, which sent food and clothing to the impoverished in Austria.

===Move to the United States===
In the 1940s, the family moved to Stowe, Vermont, where they ran a music camp when they were not touring. In 1944, Maria Augusta, Maria Franziska, Johanna, Martina, Hedwig and Agathe applied for U.S. citizenship, whereas Georg never applied to become a citizen. Rupert and Werner became citizens by serving during World War II, while Rosmarie and Eleonore became citizens by virtue of their mother&#x27;s citizenship. Johannes was born in the United States in Philadelphia on 17 January 1939 during a concert tour. Georg von Trapp died in 1947 in Vermont after suffering lung cancer.

The family made a series of 78-rpm records for RCA Victor in the 1950s, some of which were later issued on RCA Camden LPs. There were also a few later recordings released on LPs, including some stereo sessions. In 1957, the Trapp Family Singers disbanded and went their separate ways. Maria and three of her children became missionaries in Papua New Guinea. In 1965, Maria moved back to Vermont to manage the Trapp Family Lodge, which had been named &quot;Cor Unum&quot;. She began turning over management of the lodge to her son Johannes, although she was initially reluctant to do so. Hedwig returned to Austria and worked as a teacher in Umhausen.

==Death==
Maria von Trapp died of heart failure on 28 March 1987, aged 82, in Morrisville, Vermont, three days following surgery. She is interred in the family cemetery at the lodge, along with her husband and five of her step-children.

==Decorations and awards==
The family has won the following awards:
* 1949 – Benemerenti Medal (Pope Pius XII), in recognition of the benefits of the Trapp Family Austrian Relief for needy Austrians
* 1952 – Dame of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre (Vatican-Pope Pius XII)
* 1956 – Catholic Mother of the Year in the United States. Women receive this honorary title, to recognise exemplary behavior
* 1957 – Decoration of Honour in Gold for Services to the Republic of Austria
* 1962 – Siena Medal – an award given by Theta Phi Alpha women&#x27;s fraternity to &quot;an outstanding woman to recognize her for her endurance and great accomplishment.&quot; The medal is the highest honor the organization bestows upon a non-member and is named after Saint Catherine of Siena.
* 1967 – Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class
* 2007 – The von Trapp Family received the Egon Ranshofen Wertheimer Prize in Braunau am Inn 
* 2012 – Naming of Maria Trapp-Platz in Donaustadt (22nd District of Vienna)

==Adaptations of the autobiography==

Maria von Trapp&#x27;s book, &quot;The Story of the Trapp Family Singers&quot;, published in 1949, was a best-seller. It was made into two successful German / Austrian films:
* &quot;The Trapp Family&quot; (1956)
* &quot;The Trapp Family in America&quot; (1958)

The book was then adapted into &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, a 1959 Broadway musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein, starring Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel. It was a success, running for more than three years. The musical was adapted in 1965 as a motion picture of the same name, starring Julie Andrews. The film version set US box office records, and Maria von Trapp received about $500,000 ($ today) in royalties.

Maria von Trapp made a cameo appearance in the movie version of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965). For an instant, she, her daughter Rosmarie, and Werner&#x27;s daughter Barbara can be seen walking past an archway during the song, &quot;I Have Confidence&quot;, at the line, &quot;I must stop these doubts, all these worries / If I don&#x27;t, I just know I&#x27;ll turn back.&quot;

Maria von Trapp sang &quot;Edelweiss&quot; with Andrews on &quot;The Julie Andrews Hour&quot; in 1973. In 1991, a 40 episode anime series, titled &quot;Trapp Family Story&quot; aired in Japan, her character referred to by her maiden name (Maria Kutschera), voiced by Masako Katsuki. She was portrayed in the 2015 film &quot;The von Trapp Family: A Life of Music&quot; by Yvonne Catterfeld.

<doc id="764515" wikidata="Q311721" url="?curid=764515" title="Hindenburg Line">
<text>The Hindenburg Line (, Siegfried Position) was a German defensive position built during the winter of 1916–1917 on the Western Front in France during the First World War. The line ran from Arras to Laffaux, near Soissons on the Aisne. In 1916, the Battle of Verdun and the Battle of the Somme left the German western armies () exhausted and on the Eastern Front, the Brusilov Offensive had inflicted huge losses on the Austro-Hungarian armies and forced the Germans to take over more of the front. The declaration of war by Romania had placed additional strain on the German army and war economy.

The Hindenburg Line, built behind the Noyon Salient, was to replace the old front line as a precaution against a resumption of the Battle of the Somme in 1917. By devastating the intervening ground, the Germans could delay a spring offensive in 1917. A shortened front could be held with fewer troops and with tactical dispersal, reverse-slope positions, defence in depth and camouflage, German infantry could be conserved. Unrestricted submarine warfare and strategic bombing would weaken the Anglo-French as the German armies in the west () recuperated. On 25 January 1917, the Germans had 133 divisions on the Western Front but this was insufficient to contemplate an offensive.

Greater output of explosives, ammunition and weapons by German industry against the Allied (battle of equipment) was attempted in the Hindenburg Programme of August 1916. Production did not sufficiently increase over the winter, with only 60 per cent of the programme expected to be fulfilled by the summer of 1917. The German (peace initiative) of December 1916 had been rejected by the Entente and the Auxiliary Service Law of December 1916, intended further to mobilise the civilian economy, had failed to supply the expected additional labour for war production.

The retirement to the Hindenburg Line (/Operation Alberich/Alberich Manoeuvre) took place from February to March 1917. News of the demolitions and the deplorable condition of French civilians left by the Germans were serious blows to German prestige in neutral countries. Labour was transferred south in February 1917 to work on the from La Fère to Rethel and on the forward positions on the Aisne front, which the Germans knew were due to be attacked by the French. Divisions released by the retirement and other reinforcements increased the number of divisions on the Aisne front to early April. The Hindenburg Line was attacked several times in 1917, notably at St Quentin, Bullecourt, the Aisne and Cambrai and was broken in September 1918 during the Hundred Days Offensive.
==Background==

===Battle of the Somme, 1916===

In August 1916 the German armies on the Somme had been subjected to great strain; the IX Reserve Corps had been &quot;shattered&quot; in the defence of Pozières. Ten fresh divisions had been brought into the Somme front and an extra division had been put into the line opposite the British. Movement behind the German front was made difficult by constant Anglo-French artillery harassing-fire, which added to equipment shortages by delaying deliveries by rail and interrupting road maintenance. Destruction, capture, damage, wear and defective ammunition had caused guns and guns to be out of action by the end of August.

The artillery deficit was only slowly improved by the plan of General Max von Gallwitz to centralise the command of the remaining artillery for counter-battery fire and to use reinforcements of aircraft to increase the amount of observed artillery fire, which had little effect on Allied air superiority but did eventually increase the accuracy and efficiency of German bombardments. The 2nd Army had been starved of reinforcements in mid-August to replace exhausted divisions in the 1st Army and plans for a counter-stroke had been abandoned for lack of troops. The emergency in Russia caused by the Brusilov Offensive, the entry of Romania into the war and the French counter offensive at Verdun had already overstretched the German army.
General Erich von Falkenhayn the German Chief of the General Staff was dismissed on 29 August 1916 and replaced by Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, with First General Erich Ludendorff as his deputy. (Third OHL, the new supreme command) ordered an end to attacks at Verdun and the dispatch of troops from there to Romania and the Somme front. On 5 September, proposals for a new shorter defensive position to be built in France were requested from the commanders of the western armies, who met Hindenburg and Ludendorff at Cambrai on 8 September. The western front commanders were told that no reserves were available for offensive operations, except those planned for Romania. Georg Fuchs, one of the corps commanders, recommended that a defensive line be built from Arras to west of Laon, shortening the front by and releasing ten divisions which, with other troops, could be used for an offensive in Alsace or Lorraine. Ludendorff criticised the practice of holding ground regardless of its tactical value and advocated holding front-line positions with a minimum of troops and the recapture of lost positions by counter-attacks, a practice that had already been forced on the German armies on the Somme.

On 15 September Crown Prince Rupprecht, commander of the northern group of armies, was ordered to prepare a rear defensive line and on 23 September work on the new (Siegfried Position/Hindenburg Line) began. On 21 September, after the battle of Flers–Courcelette (15–22 September), Hindenburg ordered that the Somme front would have priority in the west for troops and supplies. By the end of the Battle of Morval (25–28 September) Rupprecht had no reserves left on the Somme. During September, the Germans sent another thirteen fresh divisions to the British sector and scraped up troops wherever they could be found. The German artillery fired of field artillery shells and of heavy ammunition, yet the début of the tank, the defeat at the Battle of Thiepval (26–28 September) and the number of casualties (September was the costliest month of the battle for the German armies) were severe blows to German morale. On 7 October, Rupprecht anticipated a British attack north of the Ancre River in mid-October, anxiety about the situation at Verdun also increased. On 19 October, the dispatch of reinforcements from Verdun to the Somme was suspended. Defeats inflicted south of the Somme by the French Tenth Army (10–21 October) led to the sacking of Bronsart von Schellendorf, the 2nd Army chief of staff.

===German strategy for 1917===

====Hindenburg Programme====

Hindenburg and Ludendorff demanded domestic changes to complement their new strategy. German workers were to be subjected to an Auxiliary Service Law () that from November 1916, subjected all Germans from old to compulsory service. The new programme was intended to create a trebling of artillery and machine-gun output and a doubling of munitions and trench mortar production. Expansion of the army and output of war materials caused increased competition for manpower between the army and industry. In early 1916, the German army had in recruit depots and another in March when the 1897 class of conscripts was called up. The army was so flush with men that plans were made to demobilise older classes and in the summer, Falkenhayn ordered the raising of another for an army of The costly battles at Verdun and the Somme had been much more demanding on German divisions and they had to be relieved after only a few days in the front line, lasting about 14 days on the Somme. A larger number of divisions might reduce the strain on the and realise a surplus for offensives on other fronts. Hindenburg and Ludendorff ordered the creation of another 22 divisions, to reach 179 divisions by early 1917.

The men for the divisions created by Falkenhayn had come from reducing square divisions with four infantry regiments to triangular divisions with three regiments, rather than a net increase in the number of men in the army. Troops for the extra divisions of the expansion ordered by Hindenburg and Ludendorff could be found by combing out rear-area units but most would have to be drawn from the pool of replacements, which had been depleted by the losses of 1916 and although new classes of conscripts would top up the pool, casualty replacement would become much more difficult once the pool had to maintain a larger number of divisions. By calling up the 1898 class of recruits early in November 1916, the pool was increased to men in February 1917 but the larger army would become a wasting asset. Ernst von Wrisberg (de) Deputy Minister of the Prussian Ministry of War, responsible for raising new units, had grave doubts about the wisdom of this increase in the army but was over-ruled by Ludendorff.

The German army had begun 1916 equally well-provided for in artillery and ammunition, massing field and heavy artillery shells for the beginning of the Battle of Verdun but four million rounds were fired in the first fortnight and the 5th Army needed about trains a day to continue the battle. The Battle of the Somme further reduced the German reserve of ammunition and when the infantry was forced out of the front position, the need for (defensive barrages), to compensate for the lack of obstacles, increased. Before the war, Germany had imported nitrates for propellant manufacture and only the discovery before the war of the Haber process for the synthesis of nitrates from atmospheric nitrogen, enabled Germany to produce explosives while blockaded. Developing the process and building factories to exploit it took time. Under Falkenhayn, the procurement of ammunition and the weapons to fire it, had been based on the output of propellants, since the manufacture of ammunition without sufficient propellant fillings was as wasteful of resources as it was pointless; Hindenburg and Ludendorff wanted firepower to replace manpower and ignored the principle.

To meet existing demand and to feed new weapons, Hindenburg and Ludendorff wanted a big increase in propellant output to a month. In July 1916, the output target had been raised from , which was expected to cover existing demand and the extra of output demanded by Hindenburg and Ludendorff could never match the doubling and trebling of artillery, machine-guns and trench mortars. The industrial mobilisation needed to fulfil the Hindenburg Programme increased demand for skilled workers, (recalled from the army) or exempted from conscription. The number of increased from men, of whom deemed (kv, fit for front line service), at the end of 1916 to men in October 1917 and more than two million by November, being kv. The demands of the Hindenburg Programme exacerbated the manpower crisis and constraints on the availability of raw materials meant that targets were not met.

The German army returned workers to the war economy and exempted from conscription, from 1917. Steel production in February 1917 was short of expectations and explosives production was below the target, which added to the pressure on Ludendorff to retreat to the Hindenburg Line. Despite the shortfalls, by the summer of 1917, the artillery park had increased from guns and from guns, many being newer models of superior performance. Machine-gun output enabled each division to have and machine-guns and for the number of (MGA, machine-gun sharpshooter detachments) to be increased. The greater output was insufficient to equip the new divisions; existing divisions, which still had two artillery brigades with two regiments each, lost a regiment and the brigade headquarters, leaving three regiments. Against the new scales of equipment, British divisions in early 1917 had and machine-guns and the French and machine-guns.

====Unrestricted U-boat warfare and strategic bombing====

Hindenburg and Ludendorff forced a return to the policy of unrestricted submarine warfare on 9 January 1917 and engineered the dismissal of the Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg and other opponents of the policy the next day. The policy was to resume on 1 February, to sink of shipping per month and knock Britain out of the war in five to twelve months. Optimistic claims by the navy were less important to the decision than the &quot;desperate&quot; position of the western armies and the decrepitude of Germany&#x27;s allies. Another front in the west was to be opened by the resumption of air attacks on Britain. New aircraft had become available to replace airships, which had become too vulnerable to British counter-measures in 1916. Planning began in late 1916 and Operation Turk&#x27;s Cross () began in May 1917.

===Defensive fortification===

As part of the defensive strategy for the Western Front, five defensive positions were planned to form the basis of the (defensive battle) expected in 1917. A (Flanders Position) from the Belgian coast, along Passchendaele Ridge and behind the Messines salient, to the defences of Lille, the (Wotan Position, known as the Drocourt-Quéant Line to the British) from Lille to Sailly, was to be built behind the 1915 battlefields of Loos, Vimy and Arras and the 1916 battlefield of the Somme. The (Siegfried Position, known to the British as the Hindenburg Line) was to be built across the base of the Noyon Salient, from Neuville Vitasse near Arras, through St Quentin and Laon, the Aisne east of Soissons to Cerny en Laonnois on the Chemin des Dames ridge.

The (Hunding Position) was to run from Péronne to Etain, north-east of Verdun behind the Champagne battlefields of 1915. The (Michel Position) was to cover Etain to Pont-à-Mousson behind the St Mihiel Salient. The new fortified areas were intended to be precautionary measures () built to be used as rallying-positions (, similar to ones built on the Russian front) and to shorten the Western Front to economise on troops and create more reserves. The had the potential to release the greatest number of troops and was begun first; Hindenburg and Ludendorff decided its course on 19 September and construction began on 27 September.

Withdrawal to the was debated by Ludendorff and other senior German commanders over the winter of 1916–1917. An offensive in the new year with was discussed on 19 December but it was considered that such a force could not achieve a decisive result. An OHL memorandum of 5 January noted that offensive preparations by the French and British were being made all along the Western Front to keep the site of a spring offensive secret. It was considered that the Somme front, the area between Arras and Lille, the Aisne front, Lorraine and Flanders were particularly threatened. Prisoner interrogation, postal analysis, espionage and air reconnaissance were used to identify the probable sites of Anglo-French offensives. March was considered the earliest that the Anglo-French could attack, with a possible delay if a Russian offensive was also planned. The chief of staff of Army Group Rupprecht, Hermann von Kuhl issued a survey of offensive possibilities on 15 January. A German breakthrough attempt was rejected for lack of means and the consequences of failure. Limited-objective attacks at Loos, Arras, the Somme and the Aisne were considered but the manpower and equipment shortage meant that even smaller attacks risked using up reserves needed for defence against the expected Anglo-French spring offensives. Local attacks like those at Bouchavesnes and La Maisonette on the Somme in late 1916, which could be mounted without reinforcements, were all that could be considered. Ludendorff accepted the analysis that no offensive was possible.

On a visit to Kuhl on 20 January, Fuchs concluded that Allied superiority was so great that the German army could not forestall the Anglo-French with an attack or stop them attacking elsewhere. The army could not withstand another battle like the Somme; work on defences there was futile and would exhaust the troops for nothing. On 29 January, Ludendorff ruled that a withdrawal could not be ordered on political as well as military grounds, then on 31 January, discussed withdrawal with Kuhl, while the 1st and 2nd Army commanders on the Somme front opposed a retirement. Resources continued to be directed to the Somme defences during January and February and on 6 February, the 1st Army HQ requested three divisions and to work on new positions, to implement the plan, a partial withdrawal to a line from Arras to Sailly. Even with the expansion of the German army over the winter and the transfer of divisions from Russia, divisions the Western Front were confronted by , British and Belgian divisions, many of which were bigger than the German equivalents. The plan would reduce the front by and need six fewer front-holding divisions, compared to a shortening of and a saving of 13 to 14 divisions, by withdrawing an average of to the (Hindenburg Line).

===Anglo-French strategy for 1917===
The German army was far from defeat but in 1916 had been forced back on the Somme and at Verdun, as had the Austro-Hungarian army in southern Russia. At the Chantilly Conference of November 1916 the Allies agreed to mount another general offensive. The Anglo-French contribution was to be a resumption of the Somme offensive with much larger forces, extending the attack north to Arras and south to the Oise, followed by a French attack between Soissons and Rheims. The British were to attack the salient that had formed between Bapaume and Vimy Ridge with two armies and the French with three armies from the Somme to Noyon. The attacks were to be made on the broadest possible fronts and advance deep enough to threaten German artillery positions. When Marshal Joseph Joffre was superseded by General Robert Nivelle, the &quot;Chantilly strategy&quot; was altered. The French returned to a policy of decisive battle, with a breakthrough to be achieved within leading to the &quot;total destruction of active enemy forces by manoeuvre and battle&quot;. Successive attacks in a methodical battle were dropped and continuous thrusts were substituted, to deprive the Germans of time to reinforce and strengthen their defences. A large amount of heavy artillery fire up to deep, to the rear edge of the German defences would achieve the breakthrough. The infantry advance was to reach the German heavy artillery in one attack and then widen the breach with lateral attacks. A strategic reserve would then move through the gap and destroy the German reserves in open warfare. The original French attacks between the Somme and Oise were reduced in size and the secondary attack between Soissons and Rheims was reinforced to become the main offensive. The Nivelle Offensive was planned to begin with a British attack on the Bapaume salient in early April 1917, to assist the main French attacks a week later by holding German troops on the Arras front and diverting reserves from the Aisne.

==Prelude==

===German preparations===

German reconnaissance aircraft surveyed all of the Western Front over the winter of 1916–1917 to look for signs of Anglo-French offensive preparations. The design of the (Siegfried Position, later known by the Allied powers as the Hindenburg Line) was drawn up by Colonel Kraemer, an engineer from supreme headquarters (OHL) and General Lauter, the Inspector General of Artillery. Construction was organised by Rupprecht and Kuhl; when the plans were ready the line was divided into sectors and officers from the General Staff, gunners and engineers were appointed to oversee construction, which was expected to take five months. The defences were built by German construction companies, who brought skilled workmen to fabricate ferro concrete emplacements, while and labourers and Russian prisoners of war dug the trenches. The building works absorbed most of the cement, sand and gravel production of occupied France and Belgium plus that of west Germany. Transport of materials was conducted by canal barge and railway, which carried of engineering stores, although the building period from October 1916 to March 1917 meant that only about eight trains a day were added to normal traffic. Mass-production techniques were used to produce items for the position. Steel-reinforced concrete dug-outs for infantry squads and artillery-observation posts were standard designs and all woodwork was made to a pattern.

The line was long and built for a garrison of twenty divisions, one every . Telephone cables were deeply buried and light railways built to carry supplies to the defences. The position had two trenches about apart, with sentry garrisons to occupy the front trench. The main line of defence was the second line, which was equipped with dugouts for most of the front garrison. Fields of barbed wire up to deep, were fixed with screw pickets in three belts wide and apart, in a zig-zag so that machine-guns could sweep the sides, placed in front of the trench system. Artillery observation posts and machine-gun nests were built in front of and behind the trench lines. Where the lay of the land gave observation from behind the system, it was built on reverse slopes (a ), with a short field of fire for the infantry, according to the experience of the Western Front defensive battles of 1915 and 1916, when forward-slope positions had been smashed by observed Franco-British artillery-fire.

In much of the new position, the new principle of reverse-slope positions with artillery-observation posts to the rear was not followed. Artillery observation posts were built in the front-trench system or in front of it. Trenches had been dug near a crest, on a forward slope or at the rear of a reverse slope, which replicated the obsolete positions being abandoned. The 1st Army commander, General Fritz von Below and his Chief of Staff Colonel Fritz von Loßberg rejected this layout since smoke and dust would make artillery observation from such positions impossible. They urged that the 1st Army section of the (Hindenburg Line) from Quéant, where it met the site of the (Wotan Line) to Bellicourt north of St Quentin, should have another position built in front of the new position, which would become the artillery protection position () behind the revised front system; the line already had to accommodate , which was sufficient to shelter local reserves. The new line would be similar but on reverse slopes, have dugouts for and be ready by 15 March. The existing artillery positions were scrapped and the artillery sited to dominate ground useful for the assembly of assault-troops, such as the La Vacquerie plateau.

Rupprecht refused to delay implementation of Operation Alberich (the ) but having inspected the (Hindenburg Line) on 27 February, sanctioned the 1st Army proposal and provided three divisions and for the new construction, which turned the (Hindenburg Line) into the . Another two-trench system () was planned near the artillery reserve positions, which were about behind the existing battery positions, to be built as soon as labour became available. The extra position would ensure that an attack that captured the (Hindenburg Line), could not continue without a pause to move artillery into range of the . When complete the various positions had a depth of and the original Hindenburg Line had become an intermediate line (). Work began on another defensive position in the autumn of 1917, with the original Hindenburg Line as its front-trench system.

===German defensive methods===
The practice of rigidly defending front-line trenches, regardless of casualties was abolished, in favour of a mobile defence of the fortified areas being built over the autumn and winter of 1916–1917. (Principles of Field Fortification) was published in January 1917, in which instructions were given for the construction of defences in depth, according to the principles of greater depth and of disguise by dispersal and camouflage. Trench-lines were mainly intended for accommodation, dumps of supplies and as decoys, rather than firing lines. Deep dug-outs in the front line were to be replaced by many more smaller, shallow (MEBU shelters) with most built towards the rear of the defensive areas. Within the new forward zones, battlezones and rearward battle zones, the chain of command was streamlined by making corps headquarters into (groups), responsible for the administrative tasks in an area into which divisions would be moved for periods, before being withdrawn to rest, train and be brought up to strength. Command of areas rather than units was also introduced in divisions, with command of regiments devolved to the front battalion commander (KTK ), which reduced the chain of command from five to two posts.

The value of ground was to be determined by its importance to a defensive position. Where the lay of the land gave the defender a tactical advantage, by which an attacker could be defeated with the minimum of casualties to the defenders, with small-arms fire from dispersed, disguised positions and observed artillery-fire, it was to be fought for by the garrison and local reserves, which would counter-attack to regain any ground lost The changes were codified in a training manual (The Conduct of the Defensive Battle in Position Warfare) issued on 1 December 1916, which made infantry sections () rather than the battalion the basic tactical unit. Small, advanced garrisons were to repulse attacks and penetrations were to be cut off and counter-attacked immediately, without waiting for orders. Front line troops were allowed to move away from fire, preferably by advancing into no man&#x27;s land but moves to the flanks and rear were also allowed.

When front-line garrisons and their supports were unable to hold or recapture the front-line, they were to defend positions even if surrounded, to give time for a counter-attack by reserve divisions. When an immediate counter-attack () from behind the defensive position was not possible, a deliberate counter-attack () was to be planned over several days. Two schools of thought emerged over the winter; the principal authors of the new training manual, Colonel Max Bauer and Captain Hermann Geyer of the General Staff, wanting front garrisons to have discretion to move forwards, sideways and to retire. General von Hoen and Colonel Fritz von Lossberg the 1st Army Chief of Staff issued a memorandum, (Experience of the German 1st Army in the Somme Battles) on 30 January 1917. The document advocated the rigid holding of the front line by its garrison, to keep the defence organised under the control of battalion commanders. Lossberg and Hoen doubted that relief divisions could arrive quickly enough to counter-attack before Allied infantry had consolidated. They predicted that (relief divisions) would not be ready in time for hasty counter-attacks to succeed and that they should make planned counter-attacks after with full artillery support. Both theories were incorporated by Ludendorff into the new (Training Manual for Foot troops in War) of March 1917. Training schools were established to prepare German commanders and courses began in February 1917.

===Anglo-French preparations===
British and French plans for 1917 were agreed at an Allied conference at Chantilly from 1916. Existing operations were to continue over the winter, fresh troops arriving in front-line units were to be trained and in the spring the front of attack was to be broadened, from the Somme to Arras and the Oise. The front of attack was to be about long, with two French surprise attacks near Rheims and in Alsace, to begin after the main attacks, to exploit German disorganisation and lack of reserves. The Allies expected to have against divisions, for the co-ordinated offensives. A British operation in Flanders was also agreed, to begin several weeks after the main offensives further south. Joffre was replaced by Nivelle on 13 December, who proposed a much more ambitious strategy, in which the plan for a resumption of Anglo-French attacks either side of the Somme battlefield of 1916 was retained but the offensive on the Aisne was converted to a breakthrough offensive, to be followed by the commitment of a strategic reserve of to fight a &quot;decisive&quot; battle leading to the exploitation of the victory by all of the British and French armies. French troops south of the British Fourth Army were freed to join the strategic reserve by an extension of the British front, to just north Roye on the Avre facing St Quentin, which was complete by 26 February.

During periods of fine weather in October 1916, British reconnaissance flights had reported new defences being built far behind the Somme front; on 9 November, reconnaissance aircraft found a new line of defences from Bourlon Wood to Quéant, Bullecourt, the river Sensée and Héninel, to the German third line near Arras. Next day, an escaped Russian prisoner of war, reported that were working on concrete dug-outs near St Quentin. Behind the Fifth and Fourth army fronts, the course of the Hindenburg Line was further away and the winter weather was exceptionally bad, which grounded aircraft and made air observation unreliable. On 11 December, a reconnaissance in the area of Marcoing reported nothing unusual, despite flying over the new diggings. German fighter opposition in the area became much worse, with more aircraft and the arrival in service of superior aircraft types in the late summer of 1916. Three intermediate defensive lines begun in late 1916, much closer to the Somme front, were observed by British reconnaissance aircraft, which made fragmentary reports of digging further back unexceptional.

On 2 January, Nivelle instructed the to co-operate with the British to investigate German defensive systems that spies and repatriated civilians had reported. Not until 26 January, did a British intelligence summary report a new line of defence between Arras and Laon. In February, attempts to send more aircraft to reconnoitre the line were hampered by mist, snow, rain, low cloud and an extremely determined German air defence. British air reconnaissance discovered diggings between Drocourt and Vitry en Artois at the end of January and on 15 February, found a line between Quéant and Etaing. The British were able to trace the new line (named the Drocourt–Quéant Switch) south to Bellicourt on 15 February and St Quentin on 25 February, the day after the first German withdrawal on the Ancre. British aircraft losses on these flights were severe due to the presence of &quot;Jagdstaffel&quot; 11 (the Richthofen Circus) near Douai; six British reconnaissance aircraft were shot down on 15 April, along with two escorts.

===Operations on the Ancre, 1917===
Winter weather in mid-November 1916, stopped the Anglo-French attacks on the Somme, rather than the defensive efforts of the German army. On 1 January, a German attack took Hope Post near Beaumont Hamel, which was lost to a British attack on 5 January. On the night of a British attack captured the Triangle and Muck Trench, covering the flank of an attack on Munich Trench during the day; British troops edged forward over Redan Ridge for the rest of the month. A fall in temperature added to German difficulties, by freezing the mud in the Ancre valley, making it much easier for infantry to move. On 3 and 4 February, British attacks towards Puisieux and River trenches succeeded, despite German counter-attacks on 4 February. On 7 February, British attacks threatened the German hold on Grandcourt and Serre. Each small advance uncovered to British ground observers another part of the remaining German defences. A bigger British attack began on 17 February, to capture and gain observation over Miraumont and the German artillery positions behind Serre. Three divisions attacked after a three-day artillery bombardment using the new fuze 106. A thaw set in on 16 February, which, with the Germans alerted to the attack by a deserter, led to the attack on the south bank advancing only at most and to the capture Boom Ravine (). The attack on the north bank, to gain observation over Miraumont from the west, succeeded despite the weather and the Germans being forewarned.

On the Fourth Army front, fewer attacks took place while the French line was being taken over in stages, southwards to the Amiens–Roye road. On 27 January, the 29th Division took in an advance of only and on 1 February, an Australian attack on Stormy Trench was repulsed by a German counter-attack. A second attack on 4 February succeeded. On 8 February, a battalion of the 17th Division took a trench overlooking Saillisel and held it, despite German counter-attacks that continued on 9 February. On 21 and 22 February, Australian troops captured more of Stormy Trench despite rain, which made the ground even more &quot;appalling&quot;, than before the freeze in January and early February. On 23 February, British and Australian troops on the south side of the Ancre, sent patrols forward to investigate fires seen in German trenches and discovered the German withdrawal. Reports began to reach British commanders by on 24 February, who ordered intensive patrolling and advanced guards to be prepared, ready to move forward at dawn on 25 February. The German positions back to a reserve line, (Trench I Position) from Le Transloy to Serre were found to be empty; Gough ordered that strong patrols were to move forward and regain contact with the Germans. Behind the British front, the effect of the thaw on roads and supply routes caused acute supply difficulties.

==Withdrawal==

===German plan===
Over the winter, German deception operations were conducted and indications of an offensive through Switzerland diverted French attention at the end of 1916. The British were occupied by reports of troops and heavy artillery moving into Flanders and increased numbers of agent reports of troop movements from Lille, Tourcoing and Courtrai. Until January 1917, the British took seriously a possible limited offensive towards the Channel ports and made Flanders the subject of most of their long-range reconnaissance flights. Rupprecht, the northern army group commander on the Western Front, was made responsible for planning the devastation of the infrastructure within the Noyon Salient and the retirement to new defensive positions along the (Hindenburg Line), codenamed the (Alberich Manoeuvre). The Germans prepared a timetable; infrastructure in the salient was to be destroyed and buildings demolished from 

Booby-traps were devised with delayed-action fuzes used a striker on a spring, held back by a wire. Acid ate through the wire, to release the striker and detonate the explosive. A number of devices with such fuzes were planted in bunkers but most booby-traps had simple pressure detonators. Wires were attached to useful items like stove chimneys and loot; trip-wires on the stairs of dugouts were connected to bundles of hand-grenades. On some roads, heavy-artillery shells were buried with contact-fuzes, which would only be triggered by the weight of a lorry. British engineers and tunnelling companies scoured areas as they were occupied and disabled many of the explosives. Roads were flooded by destroying drains and water-courses; wells sabotaged by drilling a shaft next to them and exploding a charge, permanently ruining the well. Much of the explosive used by the Germans (, and ) had the property of water-absorption so could be neutralised by dousing. Some British booby-trap patrols made German prisoners go first, who revealed traps rather than be blown up and British tunnellers removed of explosives. (In some areas no booby-traps were found, as German divisional commanders had been allowed to choose whether to mine their areas and some refused.)

Trees were to be cut down, wells polluted and the civilian population forced to leave the area. Rupprecht objected to the scorched-earth policy on moral and practical grounds, that the destruction would be a propaganda disaster, provide enemy troops with shelter, material to repair the damage to roads and undermine the morale and discipline of the German soldiers involved in the destruction. The buildings of Nesle, Ham, Noyon and several villages were excluded from the plan and French civilians were to be left behind in them, while civilians were to be evacuated to work in the rest of occupied France and Belgium. A timetable for the demolition plan was prepared to be followed by two &quot;marching days&quot; for the troops on the flanks of the area, three for the troops between Nauroy and Coucy le Chateau and four marching days for those between St Quentin and La Fère.

===German retirements on the Somme===
Defensive positions held by the German army on the Somme after November 1916 were in poor condition, the garrisons were exhausted and postal censors reported tiredness and low morale, which left the German command doubtful that the army could withstand a resumption of the battle. The German defences on the Ancre began to collapse under British attacks in January 1917, which caused Rupprecht to urge on 28 January, that the retirement to the (Hindenburg Line) begin. Ludendorff rejected the proposal next day but British attacks on the 1st Army, particularly the action of Miraumont/Battle of Boom Ravine caused Rupprecht on the night of 22 February, to order a preliminary withdrawal of about between Essarts and Le Transloy to .

On 24 February, the Germans withdrew to the protected by rear guards, over roads in relatively good condition, which they then destroyed. Next day, German rear guards inflicted on Australian troops near Loupart Wood and forced British troops back out of Irles with artillery-fire. A British attack on Puisieux on 26 February took all day and ended in hand-to-hand fighting. Next day troops of Prussian Foot Guard Regiment 5 withdrew from Thilloy, completing the retirement to the . The German withdrawal was helped by a thaw, which turned roads behind the British front into bogs and by disruption to the Allied railways that supplied the Somme front. On the night of 12 March, the Germans withdrew from the between Bapaume and Achiet le Petit, while small parties of troops sent up flares to mislead the British, who were preparing an attack. It took the British until 13 March to close up the (Trench II Position). The British opposite the 1st Army, received indications that a withdrawal was imminent on 20 and 21 February, when intercepted wireless messages were decoded, ordering German wireless stations at Achiet le Petit, Grévillers and the vicinity of Bapaume, to close and prepare to move back. After this period, information from prisoners and the evidence of German demolitions, indicated that a longer retirement was planned but the existence of three German reserve lines behind the front line, made a local German retirement seem more likely than a longer one.

On 13 March, a document revealing the plan and the code-name dated 5 March, was found in Loupart Wood. On 24 February Lieutenant-General Hubert Gough defined the boundaries of the three corps making the advance and ordered them to regain contact with the German armies, using strong patrols supported by larger forces moving forward more deliberately behind them. The German front-line was being maintained along the rest of the front and the possibility of a sudden German counter-offensive was not discounted. On 25 February, the 2nd Australian Division advanced on Malt Trench, found it strongly held and was forced to retire with The Fifth Army divisions advanced with patrols until they met German resistance, then prepared deliberate attacks, some of which were forestalled by German withdrawals, which by 26 February, apart from some small detachments, had abandoned the ground west of the . British engineers improvised sleds to move guns and wagons, with pack-mules being used to carry food and ammunition and on 8 March, ammunition lorries were able to move forward in the V Corps area. Behind the old British front line, the thaw badly affected roads, which had been in a very poor condition at the end of 1916, many were closed and others were limited to horse-drawn traffic. Railway transport was even worse affected, with Boulogne harbour blocked, the number of trains and wagons on the northern French railways far short of British requirements, the lines being congested and subject to traffic restrictions. Supply difficulties had also begun to increase on the Third Army and Fourth Army fronts before the German withdrawals.

On 10 March, the Fifth Army took Grévillers Trench and Irles in a methodical attack, which overwhelmed the German defence and took Fires could be seen behind Bapaume, with more visible behind the and British military intelligence reported that the headquarters of Rupprecht had been moved to Mons; civilians were known to have been evacuated along with supply dumps and artillery. The was found to be empty between Bapaume and Achiet le Petit on the night of 12 March but next day an attack on Bucquoy failed with The German document found in Loupart Wood dated 5 March, containing details of the (Operation Alberich), showed that Loupart Wood had been abandoned a day early. On the night of 14 March, patrols found that the Germans had withdrawn from part of the Fourth Army front and on 17 March, the Germans slipped away on all of the Third and Fifth Army fronts.

On 4 February, the order was given to begin the (Alberich Manoeuvre), with 9 February to be the first day and 16 March the first marching day. The 1st Army from Arras to Péronne brought reserve divisions forward to the and outpost villages close to the (Hindenburg Line). The front-holding divisions, which had been worn down by British attacks, were withdrawn behind the (Hindenburg Line). On 17 March, the German troops at the north end of the Bapaume Salient withdrew swiftly, as there were no intermediate lines corresponding to the north of Achiet le Grand. was abandoned by 18 March and next day Boyelles and Boiry Becquerelle were evacuated. The withdrawal went straight back to the (Hindenburg Line) except for outposts at Hénin sur Cojeul, St Martin sur Cojeul and the west end of Neuville Vitasse. Numerous raids were mounted on British outposts during 20 and 21 March. 

The was abandoned north of the Ancre, along with part of the near its junction with at Bapaume, which was also abandoned while many houses were still on fire. Next day, parties of Germans at Beugny in the fought until nightfall then slipped away. A party at Vaulx Vraucourt was surprised (while some were shaving) and driven back to Lagnicourt. On 20 March, an Australian attack on Noreuil failed with and an attack on Croisilles was repulsed. A German counter-attack to recover Beaumetz was mounted on 23 March and got into the village before being forced to withdraw; the attack was repeated next day but only one party reached the village. Lagnicourt was lost on 26 March and a counter-attack from Noreuil repulsed, then a British attack on Bucquoy was defeated.

The 2nd Army conducted the withdrawal with the line-holding divisions, which were fresher than the divisions of the 1st Army and assisted by several cavalry divisions and cyclist battalions. On 17 March, withdrawals began north of the Avre and by 18 March, the German 7th, 2nd, 1st and the southern wing of the 6th Army, began to withdraw from the old front-line ( in length, as the crow flies). Soissons was abandoned, roads leading out of Noyon were flooded, railway bridges were blown and the Somme River and canal crossings from Offoy to Péronne were destroyed. Roads built on causeways over marshy ground between the river and canal, caused water to form pools wide, making crossings practical only at the causeways. The bridges over the rivers Germaine, Omignon, Cologne, Tortille and the Canal du Nord were also destroyed and huge craters blown in crossroads, the damage being made worse by the spring thaw. German rear-guards made a stand in part of the from Nurlu to Péronne on 18 March, which was the third and final marching day of the retreat from Roye to St Quentin and the second and final day from Péronne to le Catelet, when the main body of German troops reached the (Hindenburg Line). Work was still being done to remedy defects in the original position and the rear-guards retired next day from Nurlu and Bertincourt as soon as British troops appeared, then counter-attacked British cavalry around Poeuilly on 22 March.
A large counter-attack was mounted on the French front on 22 March, which forced French cavalry and cyclists back over the Crozat Canal with many casualties but began too soon to ambush a large force that included artillery, as had been intended. A Booby-trap exploded in Bapaume town hall on 25 March, killing Australian troops and two French Deputies; French civilians were left behind at Bouvincourt, Vraignes and Tincourt on 26 March and Villers Faucon, Saulcourt and Guyencourt were lost on 27 March, to attacks by British cavalry and armoured cars. Supplies of armour-piercing bullets had been sent forward by the Germans after Roisel was captured the day before, resulting in the armoured cars being peppered with bullet-holes. The armoured cars decoyed the German defenders, while cavalry got round the flanks and captured the villages. Outpost villages close to the (Hindenburg Line) south of Quéant had to be held by the Germans for longer than expected, because of the need to complete the additions to the defences being built to remedy defects in the original position. Heudicourt, Sorel and Fins were lost on 30 March. The northern outpost villages were lost on 2 April and Lempire fell on 5 April.

===Anglo-French advance===

In early March, instructions were given by the British Fourth Army corps commanders, for advanced guards to maintain contact should the Germans retreat, with larger forces to follow and dig in behind them on defensible ground, so that the advanced guards could fall back if attacked. The first sign of a German retreat was seen on 14 March when fires were seen in St Pierre Vaast Wood. Later in the day, the British entered Saillisel and by 16 March, most of the wood had been occupied. The British Fourth and Fifth armies organised all-arms forces of cavalry squadrons, infantry and cyclist battalions and artillery batteries, some of which had armoured-car units attached. On 15 March the French (GAN), south of the junction with the British Fourth Army at Roye, was ordered to follow up a German retirement. By 18 March the German 6th, 1st, 2nd and 7th armies were withdrawing and British and French cavalry patrols met in Nesle, behind the old front line. When French troops entered Lassigny they caused a traffic jam and vehicles that tried to skirt the jam bogged in mud. GAN had been on ten-day&#x27;s notice to attack (about fourteen days before (GAC) attacked on the Aisne) between the Oise and Avre rivers. News of the first German retirements led the army group commander, General Franchet d&#x27;Espérey to advocate an attempt to surprise the Germans and force them to retreat prematurely. The suggestion was rejected and GAN began to prepare a limited attack for 17 March, by when the Germans had gone.
On 17 March Haig and the British army commanders met and discussed the effect of the German retirement. The precedent of a German withdrawal to a prepared position followed by a counter-attack, which had occurred in 1914 was noted and that reserves, freed by the retirement, would give the Germans an opportunity to attack the flanks of the withdrawal area. Nivelle had already decided to use the French troops released by the shorter front to reinforce the line in Champagne. British preparations for the attack at Arras were to proceed, with a watch kept for a possible German attack in Flanders and preparations for the attack on Messines Ridge were to continue. The pursuit of the German army was to be made in the Fourth Army area with advanced guards covered by the cavalry and cyclists attached to each corps and the 5th Cavalry Division. Larger forces were not to move east of a line from the Canal du Nord to the Somme south of Péronne until roads, bridges and railways had been repaired.

The boundary of the Fourth Army and French Third Army was set from south of Nesle, through Offroy to St Quentin. In the Fifth Army area from Bapaume to the north, the advance to the Hindenburg Line needed to be completed in time to conduct supporting operations for the Third Army attack, due at Arras in early April. All-arms columns of cavalry, infantry, artillery and engineers were organised to advance on the front of each division. The advanced guards of the 5th and 2nd Australian divisions had a detachment of the Australian Light Horse, a battery of 18-pounder field guns, part of an engineer field company, two infantry battalions and several machine-guns. The advance had fewer geographical obstacles than further south. On the left flank the country beyond was open and on the right the Germans made little effort to hold the ground west of , the ground inclining slightly to the north-east towards Bullecourt, away, with most of the rivers flowing in the direction of the British advance.

After 18 March the main body of the Fifth Army was ordered to dig in temporarily from Bancourt to Bapaume, Achiet-le-Grand and Ablainzevelle and the advanced guards, which were large enough to be mobile columns, be reinforced to the strength of brigade groups. Some of the columns advanced boldly and others dug in temporarily as a precaution. Information that the Germans were burning villages behind the Hindenburg Line, led Gough to order II Corps and V Corps and the Lucknow Cavalry Brigade to advance vigorously on 19 March, with the support of the reinforced mobile columns to Ecoust St Mein, Croisilles, Lagnicourt and Hénin sur Cojeul. Next day the brigade groups were to support the cavalry drive the Germans back to the Hindenburg Line, which led the 2nd Australian Division force to attack Noreuil on 20 March. The attack was repulsed with and an advance on Ecoust and Croisilles by infantry of the 18th (Eastern) Division with cavalry and artillery on the flanks was repulsed by fire from about fifteen machine-guns and six field guns; Gough ordered that attacks on the German outpost line were to stop until more artillery was available.

The British advance in the Fourth Army area reached the Somme rapidly from 17 to 20 March, with a continuous pursuit by vanguards and the main body moving forward by bounds between lines of resistance, up to the Somme river and Canal du Nord, which ran north-to-south from Offoy to Péronne, then paused while the river was bridged, with a priority of light bridges for infantry first, pontoon or trestle bridges for wagons and field artillery and then heavy bridges for mechanical transport and heavy artillery. The heavy steel bridges could be transported from a Base Park at Le Havre with notice. A bridge over the canal near Péronne was built by surveying the ground on the night of 15 March, towing pontoons up river the next night, building beginning at dawn on 17 March and the pontoon being ready by noon. Infantry of the 1/8th Royal Warwicks crossed that evening and were then ferried over the river beyond on rafts, to become the first Allied troops into Péronne.

On the right flank, IV Corps had to advance about over cratered and blocked roads to reach the Somme but Corps Mounted Troops and cyclists arrived on 18 March to find German rearguards also mounted on bicycles. Infantry crossed the river on 20 March by when the mounted troops had reached Germaine and the Fourth Army infantry outposts were established on high ground east of the Somme. &quot;Ward&#x27;s Force&quot; was formed with corps cavalry, cyclists and two batteries of field artillery, two sections of engineers, a battalion of infantry from the 48th Division on 22 March as a precaution after cavalry was forced out of Poeuilly and neighbouring villages by a counter-attack and the corps cavalry relieved by the 5th Cavalry Division. The villages were reoccupied next day. The German retirement from the had begun on 19 March when Nurlu and Bertincourt were occupied by the British after slight pressure. British infantry and cavalry were finding greater German resistance.
After a pause until 26 March, Ward&#x27;s Force captured Roisel with an infantry company, two cavalry squadrons and two armoured cars; Canadian cavalry took Equancourt. The cavalry advanced again on 27 March and took Villers Faucon, Saulcourt and Guyencourt &quot;with great dash&quot;. An attempt at a swifter pursuit by French cavalry and cyclists on 22 March failed, when they were forced back over the Crozat canal by a German counter-attack, with many casualties. On 28 March the British precautionary line of resistance was moved forward to a line Germaine–Caulaincourt–Bernes–Marquaix–Lieramont–Nurlu–Equancourt–Bertincourt while the outposts of cavalry, cyclists and some infantry mostly paused.

On the army boundary with the French the 32nd Division kept two brigades in line and one in reserve. Each brigade in the line had two infantry companies in outposts held by platoons backed by their battalions and the artillery close enough to cover the outposts. By late March each British corps in the pursuit had diverted a minimum of one division to work on road repairs and bridging, the thaw making the effect of German demolitions far worse. In the Fifth Army area, repair work was concentrated on the railway up the Ancre valley, the Candas–Acheux line, two light railways and the Albert–Bapaume, Hamel–Achiet le Petit–Achiet le Grand and Serre–Puisieux–Bucquoy–Ablainzevelle roads, most of the labour coming from front-line divisions.

By 1 April, the British and French were ready to begin operations against outpost villages, still occupied by the Germans, west of the Hindenburg Line. The French Third Army prepared to attack at St Quentin on 10 April, for which the preliminary bombardment began on 4 April. The British Fourth Army prepared to support the attack with artillery and such infantry attacks as could be attempted, while communications were being repaired. Information from captured documents and prisoners had disclosed the details of and that outpost villages had to be held for longer than planned, to enable work to continue on the Hindenburg Line (), where it was being rebuilt south of Quéant. Despite increased German resistance, Neuville Bourjonval, Ruyaulcourt, Sorel le Grand, Heudicourt, Fins, Dessart Wood, St Emilie, Vermand sur Omignon, Vendelles, Jeancourt, Herbecourt, Épehy and Pezières were captured between 28 March and 1 April. Deliberate attacks were mounted in early April to take Holnon Wood, Savy (where the German garrison had to be overwhelmed by house-to-house fighting), Holnon, Sélency (including six German field guns) and Francilly Sélency.

A German counter-attack on 3 April by a storm troop, to recover a German artillery battery from Holnon Wood, coincided with a British attempt to do the same and failed. The French Third Army captured the Epine de Dallon on 3 April, bringing it up to the Hindenburg Line and on 4 April the British captured Metz en Couture in a snowstorm. Ronssoy, Basse Boulogne and Lempire were captured after house-to-house fighting but an attack on le Verguier failed. The villages still held by the Germans were found to be in a much better state of defence, with much more barbed wire around them. An attack on Fresnoy Le Petit, late on 5 April, was hampered by uncut wire and a second attack the next night was stopped halfway through the village, the defenders holding out until 7 April; an attack on Vadencourt also failed. On 9 April the Fourth Army began a bombardment of the Hindenburg Line, with such heavy artillery that was in range, as the Third and First armies began the offensive at Arras to the north. Fighting on the Fourth Army front, for the remaining outpost villages, went on until the end of April.

===Air operations===

German air operations over the winter concentrated on reconnaissance to look for signs of Anglo-French offensive preparations, which were found at Messines, Arras, Roye, the Aisne and the Champagne region. By March the outline of the Anglo-French spring offensive had been observed from the air. German air units were concentrated around Arras and the Aisne, which left few to operate over the Noyon Salient during the retirement. When the retirement began British squadrons in the area were instructed to keep German rearguards under constant observation, harass German troops by ground attacks and to make long-range reconnaissance to search the area east of the Hindenburg Line, for signs of more defensive positions and indications that a further retreat was contemplated.

A policy on rapid movement had been devised in September 1916, in which the Army Wing and Corps Wings not attached to the corps moving forward, would move with army headquarters and the Corps Wings attached to the corps that were advancing, would keep as close to their associated corps headquarters as possible. Squadrons would not need to move every day and could arrange temporary landing-grounds. On 21 March 1917 the use of temporary facilities was ordered with portable hangars to be built near corps headquarters and aircraft flown back to their normal aerodromes at night. IV and V Brigades were involved in the advance, with their squadrons attached to divisions for contact-patrols. Two cavalry divisions were attached to the Fourth and Fifth armies for the advance, with aircraft for reconnaissance of the ground that the cavalry was to traverse and to help the cavalry maintain touch with the rear.

Suitable targets found by air observation were engaged systematically by artillery, using zone calls. The cavalry divisions were issued with wireless stations to keep in touch with their attached aircraft but in the event good ground communications made them redundant. The German retirement was so swift and the amount of artillery fire was so small, that telephone wires were cut far less frequently than expected. German troop movements were well concealed and rarely seen from the air and it was usually ground fire that alerted aircrew to their presence. Pilots flew low over villages and strong points to invite German ground fire for their observers to plot, although this practice gave no indication of the strength of rearguards. A few attacks were made on German cavalry and infantry caught in the open but this had little influence on ground operations. The artillery wireless organisation broke down at times, due to delays in setting up ground stations, which led to missed opportunities for the direction of artillery fire from the air. The main influence of air operations was exerted through message carrying and reconnaissance, particularly in observing ground conditions in front of the advance and intermittent co-operation with artillery. Distant reconnaissance, some by single-seat fighters, found no evidence of German defences beyond the Hindenburg Line but many new aerodromes and supply dumps, indicating the permanence of the new position.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===
The success of the German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line has been explained as an Allied failure to anticipate the retirement and in being unable seriously to impede it. Another view is that the Anglo-French were not pursuing a broken enemy but an army making a deliberate withdrawal after months of preparation, which retained considerable powers of manoeuvre and counter-attack. Belated awareness of the significance of the building work along the base of the Noyon Salient, has also been given as a reason for a cautious pursuit deliberately chosen, rather than an inept and failed attempt to intercept the German retirement. In &quot;Cavalry Studies: Strategical and Tactical&quot; (1907) Haig had described the hasty retreat of a beaten enemy and an organised withdrawal by a formidable force, capable of rapidly returning to the attack, to defeat a disorganised pursuit.

In the case of an organised withdrawal, Haig described a cautious follow up by advanced guards, in front of a main force moving periodically from defensive position to defensive position, always providing a firm base on which the advanced guards could retire. The conduct of the Anglo-French pursuit conformed to this model. General Franchet d&#x27;Espérey proposed an improvised offensive to Nivelle, who rejected the idea, in favour of strengthening the main French front on the Aisne. British heavy artillery had been moved north from the Fifth Army in January, ready for the offensive at Arras and had been partly replaced by inexperienced units from Britain. Divisions from the Fourth Army had been moved south, to take over former French positions and I Anzac Corps had been transferred to the Fifth Army to compensate for divisions sent north to the Third Army by 6 February, which left the Anglo-French forces in the area depleted.

Beach concluded that evidence of German intentions had been collected by air reconnaissance, spy reports and debriefings of refugees and escaped prisoners of war but that German deception measures made information gleaned from intermittent air reconnaissance during the frequent bad flying weather over the winter appear unremarkable. German digging behind existing fortifications had taken place several times during the Somme battle and led British Intelligence to interpret the evidence of fortification-building further back from the Somme front, as an extension of the construction already being watched. In late December 1916, reports from witnesses led to British and French air reconnaissance further to the south and in mid-January 1917 British intelligence concluded that a new line was being built from Arras to Laon. By February, the line was known to be near completion and by 25 February, the local withdrawals on the Fifth Army front and prisoner interrogations, led the Anglo-French to anticipate a gradual German withdrawal to the new line.

When British patrols probing German outposts found them unoccupied, the Allies began a cautious advance, slowed by German destruction of the transport infrastructure. The troubled transport situation behind the British front, which had been caused by mounting difficulties on the Nord railways, overloading and the thaw on roads made British supply problems worse. The Germans had the advantage of falling back over good roads to prepared defences, protected by rearguards. The German armies made an efficient withdrawal, although the destruction accompanying led a considerable amount of indiscipline. Defending villages as outposts, with most of the rearguard posted at the western exits, left them vulnerable to encirclement and attacks from commanding ground and the predictability of such methods, provided French and British troops with obvious objectives.

Cyril Falls, a British official historian, criticised the British army for the failings it showed during the German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line, writing that the divisions were &quot;bewildered and helpless&quot;, until they gained experience in the new form of warfare. The commander of the 8th Division, Major-General William Heneker wrote on 2 April, that it had taken three weeks for his division to become proficient in open-warfare techniques. In April 1917, an analysis by II Corps had found that patrols coming under fire had stopped to report, ground of tactical importance had been ignored by patrols that had returned to British lines, forfeiting opportunities to force German withdrawals and artillery had been reluctant to push forward. Liaison between divisional engineers and artillery had been poor, advanced guards had not known the importance of reporting on the condition of roads, ground and the accuracy of maps; the cavalry element of advanced guards was also criticised for hesitancy although in contrast, Charles Bean, the Australian official historian, concluded that the advanced troops of I Anzac Corps had been sent out on a limb.

Falls rejected claims that British methods were predictable, noting that attacks had been made at dawn, noon, afternoon and at night. Bombardments had been fired before some attacks, during attacks on other occasions, on call from the infantry or were dispensed with. Attacks had been made indirectly, using ground for cover and a number of outflanking moves had succeeded. Combined operations with infantry, cavalry, cyclists, armoured cars and aircraft had also occurred. The most successful divisions in the pursuit were those that had been on the Somme for a considerable time, rather than the newer divisions, which were fresh and had trained for open warfare in England. Many of the British attacks had substantial casualties, mostly from German machine-gun fire, although artillery casualties were also high. Attacks on similar objectives using different methods had similar casualties, which suggested that losses were determined by the German defence, rather than unsatisfactory British methods. British field artillery had been supplied with an adequate amount of ammunition, despite the transport difficulties but much heavy artillery was left behind.
The weather was also unusually severe, with snow in early April, which had less effect on German rearguards, who occupied billets and then blew them up when they retired. Allied troops in the pursuit suffered from exposure and shortages of supplies but had increased morale, better health (trench foot cases declined sharply) and adapted to open warfare. Draught animals suffered from the weather, short rations and overloading; the British artillery soon had a shortage of and several immobilised heavy artillery batteries. The length of the Western Front was reduced by , which needed German divisions to hold. The Allied spring offensive had been forestalled and the subsidiary French attack up the Oise valley negated. The main French breakthrough offensive on the Aisne (the Nivelle Offensive), forced the Germans to withdraw to the Hindenburg Line defences behind the existing front line on the Aisne. German counter-attacks became increasingly costly during the battle; after four days had been taken by the French armies and casualties were inflicted on German armies opposite the French and Belgian fronts between April and July. Most German casualties had been incurred during the Nivelle Offensive and were greater than any earlier Entente attack, against French casualties for the same period.

The French armies lost by 25 April and were also struck by a collapse of the medical services on the Aisne front, casualties being stranded close to the battlefield for several days; German losses have been estimated at for the same period. A wave of mutinies broke out in the French armies, which eventually affected . Between 16 April and 15 May the mutinies were isolated but then spread, with recorded by 31 May. From violent resistance increased, possibly six people being killed by mutineers, which threatened the battle-worthiness of the French armies, before order slowly returned by the end of June. The French strategy of breakthrough and decisive battle had failed disastrously and for the rest of 1917, the French armies resorted to a strategy of &quot;healing and defence&quot;. Continuous and methodical battles were replaced by limited attacks followed by consolidation. A massive rearmament programme was begun to produce aircraft, heavy artillery, tanks and chemicals, which had similar goals to the Hindenburg Programme.

The parts of the Western Front where German defences were rebuilt on the new principles, or had naturally occurring features similar to the new principles, such as the Chemin des Dames, withstood the Franco-British attacks of the Nivelle Offensive in April 1917, although the cost in casualties was high. The &quot;rate&quot; of German infantry losses in these defences diminished, although this was also apparent in the &quot;rate&quot; of loss of the attackers, who were better organised and used more efficient methods, made possible by the increased flow of equipment and supplies to the Western Front, which had so concerned Ludendorff in September 1916 (In 1917 British artillery ammunition shortages ended and barrel-wear, from firing so many shells became a problem.) At Verdun in December 1916, Arras in April 1917 and at Messines in June, where the new German defensive principles of depth, camouflage and reverse-slope defences, dispersed methods of fortification and prompt reinforcement by divisions, were not possible or had not been adopted in time, the British and French armies inflicted costly defeats on the Germans.

The German defensive strategy on the Western Front in 1917, succeeded in resisting the increase in the offensive power of the Entente, without the loss of vital territory but the attrition of German manpower was slowed rather than reversed. Unrestricted submarine warfare caused the United States to declare war on 6 April and failed to isolate Britain from its overseas sources of supply. The bombing offensive against Britain, acted to divert Anglo-French air defence resources, which slowed the rate at which the German air service was outnumbered in France. By the end of the Third Battle of Ypres in November 1917, the effectiveness of the methods of defence introduced in 1917 had been eroded and continuation of a defensive strategy in the west was made impossible. The defeat of Russia gave the German leadership a final opportunity to avoid defeat, rather than the attempts to compete with Allied numerical and industrial superiority, through economic warfare in the Atlantic and the domestic initiatives of the Hindenburg Programme, the Auxiliary Service Law and temporary demobilisation of skilled workers from the army.

===Casualties===
The accuracy of Great War casualty statistics is disputed. Casualty data available refer to Western Front totals as shown in Winston Churchill&#x27;s &quot;The World Crisis&quot; (1923–29) and do not refer directly to the German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line () or losses that would be considered &quot;normal wastage&quot;, occurring as a consequence of the existence of the Western Front, rather than to particular military operations. British casualties in France from January to March 1917, were given as casualties given were German 

===Subsequent operations===

The first attack of the Nivelle Offensive by the British First and Third armies came at Arras, north of the Hindenburg Line on 9 April and inflicted a substantial defeat on the German 6th Army, which occupied obsolete defences on forward slopes. Vimy Ridge was captured and south, the greatest depth of advance since trench-warfare began was achieved, surpassing the success of the French Sixth Army on 1 July 1916. German reinforcements were able to stabilise the front line, using both of the defensive methods endorsed in the new German training manual. The British continued the offensive, despite the difficulties of ground and German defensive tactics, in support of the French offensives on the Aisne to the south and then to keep German troops in the area while the Messines Ridge attack was being prepared. German casualties were British losses of the Third and First armies.

During the Battle of Arras the British Fifth Army was intended to help the operations of the Third Army by pushing back German rear guards to the (Hindenburg Line) and then attacking the position from Bullecourt to Quéant, which was from the main Arras–Cambrai road. The German outpost villages from Doignies to Croisilles were captured on 2 April and an attack on a front, with Bullecourt in the centre was planned. The wire-cutting bombardment was delayed by transport difficulties behind the new British front line and the attack of the Third Army, which was originally intended to be simultaneous, took place on 9 April. A tank attack by the Fifth Army was improvised for 10 April on a front of to capture Riencourt and Hendecourt.

The attack was intended to begin before sunrise but the tanks were delayed by a blizzard and the attack was cancelled at the last minute; the 4th Australian Division withdrawal from its assembly positions was luckily obscured by a snowstorm. The cancellation did not reach the 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division on the left in time and several patrols were already in the German barbed wire when the order arrived. The attack was postponed for but only four of the twelve tanks in the attack were in position on time. The tanks that attacked lost direction and were quickly knocked out, leaving no gaps in the barbed wire for the infantry. Australian troops took a portion of the front Hindenburg trench and false reports of success led to cavalry being sent forward, where they were forced back by machine-gun fire as were the Australians by a counter-attack at Total British casualties were from the 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division suffered the 4th Australian Brigade of with prisoner and the 12th Australian Brigade had German casualties were 

At on 15 April, elements of four German divisions attacked from the (Hindenburg Line) from Havrincourt to Quéant to occupy Noreuil, Lagnicourt, Morchies, Boursies, Doignies, Demicourt and Hermies until nightfall, to inflict casualties, destroy British artillery to make a British attack in the area impossible and to attract British reserves from the Arras front further north. Lagnicourt was occupied for a short time and five British guns destroyed but the rest of the attack failed. Co-ordination between German infantry and artillery suffered from the hasty nature of the attack, for which planning had begun on 13 April. Several units were late and attacked on unfamiliar ground, with against losses.

Labour was transferred to work on the from La Fère to Rethel and labour battalions were sent to work on the forward positions on the Aisne front on 23 February. The German strategic reserve rose to by the end of March and the Aisne front was reinforced with the 1st Army, released by Operation Alberich and other divisions, which raised the number to line and reserve on the Aisne by early April. The French (GAN) attacked the Hindenburg Line at St Quentin on 13 April with no success and the &quot;decisive&quot; offensive by the French (GAR) began on 16 April between Vailly and Rheims. The French breakthrough attempt was defeated but forced the Germans to abandon the area between Braye, Condé and Laffaux and withdraw to the Hindenburg Line from Laffaux Mill, along the Chemin des Dames to Courtecon. The German armies in France were still short of reserves, despite the retirements to the Hindenburg Line and divisions depleted by during the Nivelle Offensive and then replaced by those in reserve, had to change places with the counter-attack divisions rather than be withdrawn altogether.

Another British attack at Bullecourt was planned after the failure of 11 April but postponed several times until the Third Army further north had reached the river Sensée and there had been time for a thorough artillery preparation. By May the attack was intended to help the Third Army to advance, hold German troops in the area and assist the French army attacks on the Aisne. Two divisions were involved in the attack with the first objective at the second Hindenburg trench on a front of , a second objective at the Fontaine–Quéant road and the final objective at the villages of Riencourt and Hendecourt. Many of the British transport and supply difficulties had been remedied, with the extension of railways and roads into the &quot;&quot; area. The attack began on 3 May; part of the 2nd Australian Division reached the Hindenburg Line and established a foothold. Small parties of the 62nd Division reached the first objective and were cut off, the division having and an attack by the 7th Division was driven back.

From the battle in the 2nd Australian Division sector continued and the foothold in the Hindenburg Line was extended. The 7th Division continued to try to reach British parties, which had got into Bullecourt and been isolated. A German counter-attack on 6 May was defeated but the engagement exhausted the 2nd Australian Division and the 62nd Division; serious losses had been inflicted on the 1st Australian and 7th divisions. The German 27th, 3rd Guard, 2nd Guard Reserve divisions and a regiment of the 207th Division had made six big counter-attacks and also had many casualties. The British attacked again on 7 May with the 7th Division towards Bullecourt and the 1st Australian Brigade west along the Hindenburg trenches, which met at the second objective. Next day the &quot;Red Patch&quot; was attacked again and a small part held after German counter-attacks. The 5th Australian Division relieved the 2nd Australian Division by 10 May, while the battle in Bullecourt continued to the west, the 7th Division capturing the village except for the Red Patch on 12 May, while the 62nd Division advance was pushed back. The 58th Division relieved the Australians and British attacks on 13 May failed. A final German counter-attack was made to recapture all of Bullecourt and the Hindenburg trenches on 15 May. The attack failed except at Bullecourt where the west of the village was regained. The 7th Division was relieved by part of the 58th Division, which attacked the Red Patch again on 17 May and captured the ruins, just before the Germans were able to withdraw, which ended the battle. The Fifth Army lost and German losses in two divisions were with casualties in the regiments of five other divisions engaged being a minimum. Total British losses for both Bullecourt operations were 

The Battle of Cambrai began with a secret deployment of British reinforcements for the attack. Instead of a long period of artillery registration (firing ranging shots before the attack) and wire-cutting, which would have warned the German defence that an assault was being prepared, massed artillery fire did not begin until the infantry–tank advance began on 20 November, using unregistered (predicted) fire. The British sent to roll through the (Hindenburg Line) barbed-wire fields, as a substitute for a long wire-cutting bombardment and the ground assault was accompanied by a large number of ground-attack aircraft. The British attack broke through the but was contained in the rear battlezone () by the , which had been built on the east side of the St Quentin canal on this part of the front. Preparations for a further advance were hampered by the obstacles of the Hindenburg defences, which had been crossed but which limited the routes by which the most advanced British forces could be supplied. The German defence quickly recovered and on 30 November began a counter-offensive, using a similar short bombardment, air attacks and storm troop infantry tactics, which was contained by the British, in some parts of the battlefield using the Hindenburg Line defences captured earlier.

A sequence of Allied offensives began with attacks by American and French armies on 26 September 1918 from Rheims to the Meuse, two British armies at Cambrai on 27 September, British, Belgian and French armies in Flanders on 28 September; on 29 September the British Fourth Army (including the US II Corps) attacked the Hindenburg Line from Holnon north to Vendhuille while the French First Army attacked the area from St Quentin to the south. The British Third Army attacked further north and crossed the Canal du Nord at Masnières. In nine days British, French and US forces crossed the Canal du Nord, broke through the Hindenburg Line and took and German troops were short of food, had worn out clothes and boots and the retreat back to the Hindenburg Line had terminally undermined their morale. The Allies had attacked with overwhelming material superiority, using combined-arms tactics, with a unified operational method and achieved a high tempo. On 4 October, the German government requested an armistice and on 8 October, the German armies were ordered to retire from the rest of the (Hindenburg Line).

<text>Galo Lincoln Plaza Lasso de la Vega (17 February 1906 – 28 January 1987) was an Ecuadorian statesman who served as President of Ecuador from 1948 to 1952 and Secretary General of the Organization of American States from 1968 to 1975. He is the son of former Ecuadorian President Leonidas Plaza.

==Early life==
Plaza was born in New York City in 1906 at the Marlton House during the exile of his father, the general and ex-president Leónidas Plaza; his mother was Avelina Lasso Ascásubi. In Quito, he completed his secondary school at the Instituto Nacional Mejía. Then, he studied agriculture at the University of Maryland, economics at the University of California, Berkeley, and diplomacy at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University.

==Career==
In 1938, Plaza was appointed the Minister of War of Ecuador. In 1940, he founded the Colegio Americano de Quito. In 1944, he was appointed as Ecuador&#x27;s Ambassador to the U.S. In 1948, after forming a liberal political group in Ecuador, he was elected President of Ecuador.

===Presidency===
Galo Plaza differed from previous Ecuadorian presidents. The son of former President Leónidas Plaza, he had been born in the United States, where he also attended several universities. His ties to the United States grew even closer as a result of serving there as ambassador under President Carlos Alberto Arroyo del Río. These links, as Pike points out, &quot;rendered him vulnerable to charges by Velasco Ibarra and other demagogic opponents of being the lackey of U.S. imperialism.&quot;

Galo Plaza brought a developmentalist and technocratic emphasis to Ecuadorian government. He invited a wide variety of foreign experts in economic development and in governmental administration to recommend and catalog reforms in both areas. In large part because of a lack of political will within either the executive or the legislature, however, virtually none of the recommended reforms was enacted. Nevertheless, the economy experienced a marked improvement, with inflation finally slowing down and both government budget and foreign currency accounts balancing for the first time in many years. This achievement was even more remarkable in light of the series of major earthquakes, landslides, and floods suffered by Ecuador in 1949 and 1950.

No doubt Galo Plaza&#x27;s most important contribution to Ecuadorian political culture was his commitment to the principles and practices of democracy. Galo Plaza endorsed such democratic guarantees as freedom of the press and the freedom of opponents to voice their opinions, to assemble for political purposes without fear of being jailed or worse, and to be elected to the legislature without fear of being defrauded or arbitrarily dismissed. Galo Plaza was able to create a mystique around the idea of his completing his term in office, something no president had accomplished since 1924, and this mystique no doubt helped him achieve his goal.

As Galo Plaza readily admitted, however, his greatest asset, both politically and economically, was the onset of the nation&#x27;s banana boom, as diseases plaguing plantations in Central America turned Ecuador into an alternative supplier to the huge United States market. Ecuador&#x27;s banana exports grew from US$2 million to US$20 million between 1948 and 1952. During these years, Ecuador also benefited from sizable price increases—generated by the Korean War—for its commodity exports.

As president he managed to foment the agricultural exports of Ecuador during his government, creating economic stability. During his presidency, an earthquake near Ambato severely damaged the city and surrounding areas and killed approximately 8,000 people. Unable to succeed himself, he left his office in 1952 as the first president in 28 years to complete his term in office. He ran again in the election of 1960, but was defeated by José Maria Velasco Ibarra.

After leaving office, he held a number of diplomatic posts for the United Nations. He was a mediator in the conflicts in Lebanon (1958), the Congo (1960) and Cyprus (1964–1965). In 1968, he became the Secretary General of the OAS, where he gained a reputation for leadership.

Galo Plaza owned a large hacienda and cattle ranch &quot;Zuleta&quot; near Quito, where he customarily spent weekends throughout his four years as president. During the later 1950s and into the 1960s, the former president instituted educational and landholding reforms for the benefit of the numerous workers there.

===Inter-American Dialogue===
In 1982 Galo Plaza together with the U.S. diplomat Sol M. Linowitz formed the Inter-American Dialogue think tank with the goal of bringing together leaders of the Americas to set a new inter-American agenda.

==Death==
Galo Plaza died of a heart attack 28 January 1987 in a hospital in Quito. He was survived by his wife, Rosario Pallares, and his five daughters and one son. His granddaughter, María José Plaza, became a politician and served in the National Assembly from 2021.

<text>A fishing lure is any of a broad category of inedible, artificial fishing baits designed to be &quot;fake food&quot; that mimic the appearances of prey and thus attract the attention of predatory fish when angling. Lures come in many shapes and designs that impart different actions and vibrations, which appeal to fish&#x27;s foraging/territorial instincts and provoke them into striking. Lure color, brightness or the metallic shine/flash alone may also contribute to fish striking a lure, but much of the time even clear hard or soft plastic lures will get struck as well as those made of fur, metal, wood, soft and hard plastic or skirts made of feather, rubber or silicone strands. Lures can be commercially made and purchased from tackle shops, or hand-made by anglers (as in the case of hand-tied fly lures).

Fishing lures are attached to a fishing line, and attached to at least one hook (commonly a treble hook). When lure fishing, the angler use a rod to cast or simply drop the lure to an area of water and then steadily retrieve the lure back, in the hope that lure movements and splashes against the water current will entice nearby fish into striking. Typically, the line is stored on a reel spool and cranked back in retrieval, but in handlining and ice fishing the line might be pulled by hand or tethered directly to a very short rod. Trolling or dragging a lure behind a moving boat is also an effective way to cover water and provoke fish to strike. The &quot;retrieve&quot; of a lure is as important as the lure cast and there are many types of retrieves, most are tailored to the lure, how it is used and where it is placed, i.e. what depth and/or near objects in the water such as plants or docks. Lures are &quot;search tools&quot; that find fish apt to strike something they have no clue is dangerous.

==History==
In early time, angling used predominantly edible baits impaled on hooks made from animal bones or bronze. The ancient Chinese and Egyptians practiced angling with fishing rods, hooks and lines as early as 2,000 B.C., though most of the first fishermen used handlines. The Roman scholar Claudius Aelianus first described the practice of &quot;fasten red wool... round a hook, and fit on to the wool two feathers which grow under a cock&#x27;s wattles&quot; by Macedonian anglers on the Astraeus River, an early form of fly fishing, near the end of the 2nd century. The Chinese were the first to make modern-looking fishing line, spun from fine silk, and the use of &quot;wooden fish&quot;, likely an early type of surface lure, to catch larger fish had been wide spread at least since the Song dynasty (960–1279).

Nordic people have been making spoon lures from the 8th-13th century AD. Most of the lures are made from iron, bronze, copper, and in one case an iron hook soldered to a copper spoon. Many lures had varying shapes and sizes fitting different scenarios like ice fishing and summer fishing. Modern spoon lures appear to have originated in Scandinavia in the late 1700s.

English tackle shops are recorded as selling tin minnows in the middle of the 18th century, and realistic imitations of bugs and grubs made from painted rubber appeared as early as 1800. Early English minnow baits were largely designed to spin as their attracting action, as exemplified by the “Devon”-style lure first produced in quantity by F. Angel of Exeter. The number and variety of artificial baits increased dramatically in the mid- to late 19th century.

The first production lures made in the United States, mostly metal spoons and spinnerbaits, came on the market in the last half of the 19th century. The makers included Julio T. Buel, Riley Haskell, W. D. Chapman and Enterprise Manufacturing Company. Modern fishing plugs were first made commercially in the United States in the early 1900s by firms including Heddon in Michigan and Enterprise Mfg. (Pflueger) in Ohio. Before this time most fishing lures were made by individual craftsman. Commercial-made lures were based on the same ideas that the individual craftsmen were making but on a larger scale.

==Methods==
The fishing lure is either directly tied to a fishing line (usually a leader) by a knot such as the improved clinch knot or the Palomar knot, or linked to the line via a small split ring (which allows more freedom of motion) and/or a tiny safety pin-like fastener called a &quot;snap&quot;, which is usually also connected to a swivel. The fishing line is in turn connected to a fishing reel which cranks in and releases out the line, and is manipulated by the fishing rod via a series of ring guides that impart lateral displacement on the line.

The in-water motion of the lure is generated by winding the line back towards the angler, by sweeping the fishing rod sideways, jigging movements with the rod tip, or by being towed behind a moving boat (trolling). These movements mimic the behaviors of small preys, which draw the attention of larger aquatic predators and fool them into identifying the lure as an easy meal. Exceptions include artificial flies, commonly just called &quot;flies&quot; by fly fishers, which either float on the water surface, slowly sink or float underwater, and represent some form of drowning insect.

==Types==

There are many types of fishing lures. Today&#x27;s modern definition for lures are that they be made of wood, plastic, rubber, metal, cork, and materials like feathers, animal hair, string, tinsel and others. They could also have any number of moving parts or no moving parts. They can be retrieved fast or slow. Some of the lures can be used alone, or with another lure.
In most cases they are manufactured to resemble prey for the fish, but they are sometimes engineered to appeal to a fishes&#x27; sense of territory, curiosity or aggression. Most lures are made to look like dying, injured, or fast moving fish. They include the following types:

* Artificial flies are designed to resemble all manner of insect prey and are used in fly fishing.
* Combined lures combine properties of several different types of lures.
* Chatterbait, also known as &quot;bladed jig&quot; or &quot;vibrating jig&quot;, is an amalgamation of several lure constructs. It has a weighted hook (jighead), a feathered/silicone stranded skirt, and an inline spinner blade. As it is cast, and retrieved, it vibrates under water alerting nearby fish of a potential snack.
* Fish decoy is a type of lure that traditionally was carved to resemble a fish, frog, small rodent, or an insect that lures in fish so they can be speared. They are often used through the ice by fishermen and also by Inuit as part of their diet. The Mitchell Museum of the American Indian collection includes Native American fish decoys. William Jesse Ramey is considered a vintage master carver of fish decoys, and his work has been featured in museums.
* Jigs are a weighted hook with a lead head opposite the sharp tip. They usually have a minnow or crawfish or even a plastic worm on it to get the fish&#x27;s attention. Deep water jigs used in saltwater fishing consist of a large metallic weight, which gives the impression of the body of the bait fish, which has a hook attached via a short length of kevlar usually to the top of the jig. Some jigs can be fished in water depths down to 300 meters.
* LED lures have a built in LED and battery to attract fish. They use a flashing or sometimes strobing pattern, using a combination of colors and LEDs.
* Plugs are also known as crankbaits or minnows. These lures look like fish and they are run through the water where they can move in different ways because of instability due to the bib at the front under the head.
* Soft plastic baits are lures made of plastic or rubber designed to look like fish, crabs, squid, worms, lizards, frogs, leeches and other creatures.
* Spinnerbait are pieces of wire that are bent at about a 60- to 90-degree angle with a hook at the bottom and a flashy spinner at the top. 
* Spoon lures usually look like a spoon, with a wide rounded end, catching water to force action, and a narrower pointed end at the knot, similar in shape to a concave spearhead. It is shaped to have its center line off center to force the water to act upon it. They flash in the light while wobbling and darting due to their shape, which attracts fish. 
* Surface lures are also known as top water lures, poppers and stickbaits. They float and look like fish prey that is on top of the water. They can make a popping, burbling, or even a buzzing sound. It takes a long time to learn how to use this lure effectively. There are specific techniques for using surface lures effectively like &quot;walking&quot; them which gives a natural swimming look. 
* Swimbait is a soft plastic or wooden bait/lure that resembles an actual bait fish. Some of these have a tail that makes the lure/bait look like it is swimming when drawn through the water. Such a one made of wood would be hinged in certain places depending on its size.

One advantage of use of lure in general is the reduction in the use of live bait. This contributes to resolving one of the marine environment&#x27;s more pressing problems; the undermining of marine food webs by overharvesting bait species which tend to occur lower in the food chain. Another advantage of lures is that their use promotes improved survival of fish during catch and release fishing. This is because lures reduce the incidence of deep hooking which has been correlated to fish mortality in many studies.

== Rigs==

A rig is an established terminal tackle setup that combines at least one hooked lure with one or more line sections, sinkers, bobbers, swivels, decorative beads, and sometimes other lures. A rig might be held by a rod, by hand, or attached to a boat or pier. Some rigs are designed to float near the surface of the water, others are designed to sink to the bottom. Some rigs are designed for trolling. Many rigs are designed especially for catching a single species of fish, but will work well for many different species.

=== Daisy chain ===
A daisy chain is a teaser rig consisting of a &quot;chain&quot; or cluster of plastic lures run without hooks, which mimics a school of forage fish that presents abundant food for predators. The purpose of a daisy chain is to attract pelagic fish to the stern of a boat into the lure &quot;spread&quot;, which consists of a number of lures rigged with hooks.

Typically, a daisy chain&#x27;s mainline is clear monofilament line with crimped-on droppers that connect the lure to the mainline. The last lure can be rigged with a hook or unrigged. The unrigged versions are used as teasers while the hooked versions are connected to a rod and reel. The lures used on a daisy chain are made from cedar plugs, plastic squids, jets, and other soft and/or hard plastic lures.

In some countries (e.g. New Zealand), daisy chains can sometimes refer to a rig which is used to catch baitfish in a similar arrangement to a &quot;flasher rig&quot; or a &quot;sabiki rig&quot;; a series of hooks with a small piece of colourful material/feather/plastic attached to each hook.

<text>James Pleasants Jr. (October 24, 1769November 9, 1836) was an American politician who served in the U.S. Senate from 1819 to 1822 and was the 22nd Governor of Virginia from 1822 to 1825.

==Biography==
Pleasants was born at &quot;Cold Comfort,&quot; in Goochland County (later separated as Powhatan County) in the Colony of Virginia on October 24, 1769. He pursued classical studies and graduated from the College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia. He studied law, was admitted to the bar, and commenced practice in Amelia County, Virginia in 1791.

Pleasants was the son of James Pleasants and Ann Randolph, the daughter of Isham Randolph of Dungeness and granddaughter of William Randolph. His sister was Susan.

Pleasants was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates 1797–1802 and clerk of the house of delegates 1803–1811. On January 30, 1811, he was appointed to the Court of Appeals but resigned almost immediately. Pleasants was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the Twelfth and the four succeeding Congresses and served from March 4, 1811, to December 14, 1819, when he resigned, having been elected a United States Senator. Pleasants served as chairman of the Committee on Public Expenditures (Thirteenth Congress), Committee on Expenditures in the Department of the Navy (Fifteenth Congress).

He was elected on December 10, 1819, as a Democrat-Republican to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of John W. Eppes and served from December 14, 1819, to December 15, 1822, when he resigned. He was chair of the Naval Affairs Committee (Sixteenth and Seventeenth Congresses). He was chosen as Governor of Virginia, serving 1822–1825. Pleasants was a delegate to the State constitutional conventions in 1829 and 1830. He retired and lived on his estate, &quot;Contention,&quot; near Goochland, Goochland County, Virginia, where he died on November 9, 1836. He was buried on his estate. His brother-in-law and law partner, Eugene C. Massie, named his son James Pleasants Massie after Pleasants. The name has been handed down now to a total of four generations.

His son John Hampden Pleasants (1797–1846) founded the Richmond Whig newspaper, married twice, and later died in a duel with Thomas Ritchie, Jr.

Pleasants is the namesake of a residence hall at William and Mary. Pleasants County, West Virginia, was named after him in 1851.

<text>Plenty Coups (Crow: &quot;Alaxchíia Ahú&quot;, &quot;many achievements&quot;; c. 1848 – 1932) was the principal chief of the Crow Tribe and a visionary leader.

He allied the Crow with the whites when the war for the West was being fought because the Sioux and Cheyenne (who opposed white settlement of the area) were the traditional enemies of the Crow. Plenty Coups had also experienced a vision when he was very young that non-Native American people would ultimately take control of his homeland (Montana), so he always felt that cooperation would benefit his people much more than opposition. He very much wanted the Crow to survive as a people and their customs and spiritual beliefs to carry on. His efforts on their behalf ensured that this happened, and he led his people peacefully into the 20th century.

One of his famous quotes is: &quot;Education is your greatest weapon. With education you are the white man&#x27;s equal, without education you are his victim and so shall remain all of your lives. Study, learn, help one another always. Remember there is only poverty and misery in idleness and dreams – but in work there is self respect and independence.&quot; Chief Plenty Coups became a chief at the age of twenty-nine; he is the last chief who was elected a chief by other chiefs.

==Early life==
Plenty Coups was born into the Crow (&quot;Apsáalooke&quot;) tribe in about 1848 at the-cliffs-that-have-no-name (possibly near Billings, Montana), to his father Medicine-Bird and his mother Otter-woman. He was given the birth name Chíilaphuchissaaleesh, or &quot;Buffalo Bull Facing The Wind&quot;.

During the first decades of Plenty Coups&#x27; life, he led the life of a Crow warrior, which involved warring with other major tribes such as the Sioux and Cheyenne over territory, hunting rights, prestige, and the other parts of the traditional warrior way of life.

===Change of name===
In accordance with tradition, as a young man his birth name was changed: his grandfather predicted that he would become chief of the Crow Tribe, live a very long life, and accomplish many great deeds, thus christening him &quot;Alaxchiiaahush&quot;, meaning &quot;many achievements&quot;. Plenty Coups is the English translation of his name, coming from the word coup, or act of bravery. Over the course of his life, he would live up to his name and his grandfather&#x27;s prediction.

===Visions of the future===
Early in his life, Plenty Coups started having prophetic dreams and visions. Many seemed so far-fetched that no one believed them, but when they started coming true, his fellow tribe members began to revere him and listened to him carefully.

After the death of his beloved older brother when he was nine years old, he had a vision in which one of the Little People of the Pryor Mountains told him to develop his senses and wits, and that if he used them well, he would become a chief. As he later said:
I &quot;had&quot; a will and I would use it, make it work for me, as the Dwarf-chief had advised. I became very happy, lying there looking up into the sky. My heart began to sing like a bird, and I went back to the village, needing no man to tell me the meaning of my dream. I took a sweat-bath and rested in my father&#x27;s lodge. I &quot;knew&quot; myself now.&quot;

Later, when he was 11 years old, Plenty Coups (along with other young men of the Crow Nation) was challenged to have a vision which might guide his people&#x27;s future. After fasting and spending several days in the Crazy Mountains, he had a vision in which he saw many buffalo coming out of a hole. They spread over the plains, then disappeared. Surreal buffalo with weird tails, different colors (even spots), and odd bellows then came out of the hole and covered the plains. He saw himself as an old man, living near a cold spring in the foothills of the Arrowhead Mountains. He also saw a forest; strong winds blew down the trees in the forest until only one tree was left standing. In it was the home of the chickadee.

His vision was interpreted by tribal elders to mean that the white man would take over the Native American lands and their way of life, like the wind that blew down the trees in the forest—all except one, which represented the Crow people. The Crow tribe would be spared if they could learn how to work with the white man. His spirit guide then became the chickadee, and he would carry a pair of chickadee legs in a medicine bag he used for protection and spiritual power. This vision would guide his actions (and that of the Crow People) for the remainder of his life.

==Earning his new name==

===Young warrior===
Plenty Coups started learning early in life the ways of an Indian warrior. Constant attacks by neighboring tribes provided many opportunities to prove his valor, and he quickly started earning coups. He spent his youth fighting and learning alongside many other young warriors, including Medicine Crow (Sacred Raven), who would also become a chief. Many times he would cover himself with a gray wolf hide, and sneak alone into an enemy camp and scout about. He would return to his fellow warriors and devise a plan of attack. They would execute the attack, and Plenty Coups would seek to touch an enemy with his coup stick or take a weapon or horse, then return without being killed or captured. This was considered a greater act of bravery than actually killing an enemy.

He soon gained a reputation for being fearless and cunning, like the wolf. He became a member of the elite warriors of his tribe. They would do everything backwards, in a fashion that was bizarre to onlookers, which helped create fear in hearts of their enemies because of their reputation.

===Young diplomat===
As a young man, Plenty Coups also gained a reputation for being a wise and eloquent speaker. He was often looked to for guidance and advice, and spoke out often during tribal councils regarding their neighboring enemies, and their interaction with the encroaching white population and their government.

==Last great chief==

Plenty Coups was named a chief of the Crow at age 28. As a young man and chief, he was a fierce and well-respected warrior. He was thought to have between 50 and 100 feathers on his coup stick, each one representing an act of valor. Many times over, he had fulfilled the four requirements for becoming a chief.

===Fighting to protect a nation===
Plenty Coups became a chief in 1876, the same year as the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Six Crow warriors worked as scouts for General Custer at this time, and were allied with the white man in order to fight their own primary enemies during this period: the Lakota, Sioux and Cheyenne. According to the interpretation of Plenty Coups&#x27; vision, cooperating with the white man was the only way to ensure the Crow&#x27;s future survival in a white man&#x27;s world.

===Speaking to protect a people===
He was selected to represent the Crow in Washington, D.C., where he fought successfully against U.S. senators&#x27; plans to abolish the Crow nation and take away their lands. He made many trips to Washington over ten years to protect his people.

He was fairly successful in doing so, and managed to keep the Crows&#x27; original land (although it amounted to only 80% of what they were originally allotted), despite many foreigners&#x27; desire to take the land for gold prospecting and other uses. Many other Native Americans tribes were relocated to reservations on entirely different land than where they had lived their lives.

Plenty Coups told about his trip to Washington in 1880 to William Wildschut. The travel east was by Fast Wagon or train. It was described as &quot;a big black
horse with his belly nearly touching the ground&quot;.             

===Dedication of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier===

Chief Plenty Coups was selected as the sole representative of Native Americans for the dedication of the Tomb Of The Unknown Soldier and gave a short speech in his native tongue in honor of the soldier and the occasion. He placed his war-bonnet and coup stick upon the tomb, and they are preserved in a display case there.

==Legacy==
When he died in 1932 at age 84, he was considered by his people to be the last of the great chiefs. The vision he had had when he was younger had come true-he was married (his wife was Strikes-the-iron), but had no children of his own. Bison were almost wholly replaced by cattle. White society and government dominated and had completely changed America. Through diplomacy, foresight and strong leadership, Plenty Coups was able to preserve the Crow Nation land, people and culture much better than most other Native American tribes.

===Autobiography===
Author Frank Bird Linderman wrote an autobiography with Chief Plenty Coups when Plenty Coups was 80 years old. Linderman would visit Plenty Coups at his home on the Crow Reservation and ask the chief to recount parts of his life story. Two Crow Indians, Coyote-runs and Braided-scalp-lock (aka Frank Shively), assisted Plenty Coups in recounting his life to Linderman. He told about vision quests, fights with the Cheyennes and the Lakotas and about the history of the Crows. He told what little he knew about the Tongue River massacre on a big Crow camp at Tongue River in 1820. The resulting book of Plenty Coup&#x27;s life was published as &quot;American: The Life Story of a Great Indian: Plenty-coups, Chief of the Crows&quot; (New York: John Day, 1930). In 1962, it was reprinted as simply &quot;Plenty-Coups: Chief of the Crows&quot; (Bison Books) and is still in print under that title.

===Chief Plenty Coups State Park and Home===

Inspired by a visit to George Washington&#x27;s Mount Vernon plantation in Virginia in 1928, four years before his death Chief Plenty Coups donated of his personal land to Big Horn County to create a park for future generations to enjoy. The log cabin he lived in is there and is part of Chief Plenty Coups State Park. He is buried here and park visitors may visit his grave, along with a visitor&#x27;s center and museum that has more information about Plenty Coups and his legacy. The whole park was renovated in 2003. The park is located near Pryor, Montana.

==Quotations==
* &quot;Education is your most powerful weapon. With education, you are the white man&#x27;s equal; without education, you are his victim, and so shall remain all your lives.&quot;
* &quot;The ground on which we stand is sacred ground. It is the blood of our ancestors.&quot;
* &quot;I hear the white men say there will be no more war. But this cannot be true. There will be other wars. Men have not changed, and whenever they quarrel they will fight, as they have always done.&quot;

<doc id="764530" wikidata="Q441940" url="?curid=764530" title="Lenny Breau">
<text>Leonard Harold Breau (August 5, 1941 – August 12, 1984) was an American-Canadian guitarist. He blended many styles of music, including jazz, country, classical, and flamenco. Inspired by country guitarists like Chet Atkins, Breau used fingerstyle techniques not often used in jazz guitar. By using a seven-string guitar and approaching the guitar like a piano, he opened up possibilities for the instrument.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Breau was born August 5, 1941, in Auburn, Maine, USA and moved with his family to Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada in 1948. His francophone parents, Harold Breau and Betty Cody, were professional country and western musicians who performed and recorded from the mid-1930s until the mid-1970s. From the mid to late 1940s they played summer engagements in southern New Brunswick, advertising their performances by playing free programs on radio station CKCW Moncton. Lenny began playing guitar at the age of eight. When he was twelve, he started a small band with friends, and by the age of fourteen he was the lead guitarist for his parents&#x27; band, billed as &quot;Lone Pine Junior&quot;, playing Merle Travis and Chet Atkins instrumentals and occasionally singing. He made his first professional recordings in Westbrook, Maine at Event Records with Al Hawkes at the age of 15 while working as a studio musician. Many of these recordings were released posthumously on the album &quot;Boy Wonder&quot;.

The Breau family moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1957 and their new band performed around the city and province as the CKY Caravan. Their shows were radio broadcast live on Winnipeg&#x27;s CKY on Saturday mornings from remote locations.

=== Jazz career ===
Around 1959 Breau left his parents&#x27; country band after his father slapped him in the face for incorporating jazz improvisation into his playing with the group. He sought out local jazz musicians, performing at Winnipeg venues Rando Manor and the Stage Door. He met pianist Bob Erlendson, who began teaching him more of the foundations of jazz. 

In 1961, Breau had his first professionally recorded jazz session at the age of twenty at Hallmark Studios in Toronto, where he was accompanied by future members of The Band bassist Rick Danko and drummer Levon Helm. The recording would remain unreleased until 2003. In 1962, Breau briefly performed in the Toronto-based jazz group Three with singer and actor Don Francks, and Eon Henstridge on acoustic bass. Three performed in Toronto, Ottawa, and New York City. Their music was featured in the 1962 National Film Board documentary &quot;Toronto Jazz&quot;. They recorded a live album at the Village Vanguard in New York City and appeared on the Jackie Gleason and Joey Bishop television shows. 

Returning to Winnipeg a few months later, Breau became a session guitarist, recording for CBC Radio and CBC Television, and contributed to CBC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Teenbeat&quot;, &quot;Music Hop&quot;, and his own &quot;The Lenny Breau Show&quot; filmed in Winnipeg. During this period, he met his partner Judi Singh, with whom he had a daughter. In 1963 and 1964, Breau appeared at David Ingram&#x27;s Fourth Dimension at 2000 Pembina Highway in Fort Garry, a suburb of Winnipeg. Every Sunday night was a party open to all. Other regulars at the club on Sunday nights included Neil Young and his band The Squires, and Randy Bachman, who was heavily influenced by Breau, particularly evident in the jazz guitar style of his The Guess Who hit &quot;Undun&quot;.

In 1967, recordings of Breau&#x27;s playing from &quot;The Lenny Breau Show&quot; found their way to Chet Atkins. The ensuing friendship resulted in Breau&#x27;s first two mature solo albums, &quot;Guitar Sounds from Lenny Breau&quot; and &quot;The Velvet Touch of Lenny Breau – Live!&quot; on RCA, accompanied by fellow Winnipeggers Ron Halldorson and Reg Kelln. Breau did not record again for nearly 10 years, though he continued to do session work in Winnipeg. 

Breau left Winnipeg in 1976 and spent the last few years of his life in the United States, living in Maine, Nashville, Stockton, California, and New York City, eventually settling in Los Angeles in 1983. These years he spent performing, teaching, and writing for &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine. A few more solo albums were issued during his lifetime, in addition to albums recorded with fiddler Buddy Spicher and pedal steel guitarist Buddy Emmons.

Breau had problems with drugs and alcohol beginning in the 1960s, which he managed to control during the last years of his life.

== Death ==
On August 12, 1984, his body was found in the swimming pool at his apartment complex in Los Angeles, California. The coroner reported that Breau had been strangled. Breau&#x27;s wife, Jewel, was the chief suspect, but she was not charged. He is interred in an unmarked grave at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery.

== Posthumous honors ==
Many live and &quot;lost&quot; recordings have been issued since Breau&#x27;s death, and most of his previously released albums have also been reissued. Due to efforts by Randy Bachman of Guitarchives, Paul Kohler of Art of Life Records, Tim Tamashiro of CBC Radio and others, a new generation of listeners has access to his music.

The documentary &quot;The Genius of Lenny Breau&quot; was produced in 1999 by Breau&#x27;s daughter, Emily Hughes, and directed by Hughes and John Martin. This Gemini Award-winning film includes interviews with Chet Atkins, Ted Greene, Pat Metheny, George Benson, Leonard Cohen, and Bachman, as well as family members. In the film George Benson says, &quot;He dazzled me with his extraordinary guitar playing ... I wish the world had the opportunity to experience his artistry.&quot; A follow-up documentary, &quot;The Genius of Lenny Breau Remembered&quot;, directed by Hughes, was released in 2018&quot;.&quot;

The biography &quot;One Long Tune: The Life and Music of Lenny Breau&quot; by Ron Forbes-Roberts was published in 2006 containing interviews with nearly 200 people and a comprehensive discography.

CBC Radio presented a documentary on Lenny Breau titled &quot;On the Trail of Lenny Breau&quot; (the title is in reference to Breau&#x27;s parents&#x27; song &quot;On the Trail of the Lonesome Pine&quot;). It was first broadcast on September 13, 2009, as part of a regular weekly program called &quot;Inside the Music&quot;. It was narrated by Breau&#x27;s son, Chet. The one-hour feature was produced in Montreal by John Klepko.

Breau was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1997.

== Technique and guitars ==

Breau&#x27;s fully matured technique was a combination of Chet Atkins&#x27;s and Merle Travis&#x27;s fingerpicking and Sabicas-influenced flamenco, highlighted by right-hand independence and flurries of artificial harmonics. His harmonic sensibilities were a combination of his country roots, classical music, modal music, Indian, and jazz, particularly the work of pianist Bill Evans. Breau often adapted Evans&#x27;s compositions, such as &quot;Funny Man&quot;, for guitar. Breau said in relation to this, &quot;I approach the guitar like a piano. I&#x27;ve reached a point where I transcend the instrument. A lot of the stuff I play on the seven-string guitar is supposed to be technically impossible, but I spent over twenty years figuring it out. I play the guitar like a piano, there&#x27;s always two things going on at once. I&#x27;m thinking melody, but I&#x27;m also thinking of a background. I play the accompaniment on the low strings.&quot; 

He had two custom seven-string guitars made, one classical and one electric. At the time, no company made a string that could be tuned to the high A on his classical guitar. Breau used fishing line of the correct gauge until the La Bella company began making a string for him. The electric guitar was made by Kirk Sand, also with the first string being a high A.

<text>William Henry Finlay (FRAS) (17 June 1849, in Liverpool – 7 December 1924, in Grahamstown, South Africa) was a South African astronomer. He was First Assistant at the Cape Observatory from 1873 to 1898 under Edward James Stone. He discovered the periodic comet 15P/Finlay. Earlier, he was one of the first to spot the &quot;Great Comet of 1882&quot; (C/1882 R1). The first telegraphic determinations of longitude along the western coast of Africa were made by Finlay and T. F. Pullen.

== Life and work ==
Finlay was educated at Liverpool College, completed a BA with honours (Mathematics) at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1873 and then a Master&#x27;s degree also from Trinity College. Although he was not an astronomer, on the strength of his mathematical ability he was appointed first assistant at the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope in April 1873, under the direction of Edward James Stone. His first duties were the reduction of the meridian observations of the previous director, Thomas Maclear. In November 1873 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society. From initially being inexperienced in practical astronomy he went on to become an expert in the use of the Heliometer.

His chief interest was comets and in March 1880 he presented a paper on them before the South African Philosophical Society. He wrote more than 10 papers on the observations and orbits of comets. He was the first astronomer to record observations of the &quot;Great Comet of 1882&quot; (C/1882 R1), and he presented his findings to the South African Philosophical Society in October 1882. On 6 December 1882, Finlay and Robert T. Pett, the third assistant at the Royal Observatory, observed the transit of Venus from a temporary observatory they had erected at the instruction of David Gill (director of the Royal Observatory from 1879). In September 1886, Finlay discovered another comet and computed its orbit. This comet is named Comet Finlay (15P/Finlay) after him.

His other astronomical work included the preparation of star correction tables and determination of Stellar parallaxes, in collaboration with David Gill. In 1887 he undertook an analysis of the tidal records of Table Bay and Algoa Bay. He also was involved in the determination of the relative longitudes of Cape Town, Aden, Delagoa Bay, Quelimane and Zanzibar. He also participated in the measurement of a baseline near Kimberley, Northern Cape in 1891.

From 1880 to 1889 Finlay acted as an examiner for mathematics and physics at the University of the Cape of Good Hope (UCGH). In 1886 UCGH awarded him a Master&#x27;s degree in mathematics.

Finlay became chief assistant at the Royal Observatory in 1897 but was forced to retire in August 1898 owing to poor health. He went to England to recuperate but returned to South Africa. He left retirement and stood in as professor of mathematics at the South African College in 1909, on behalf of T.P Kent. In 1914 he replaced David Williams at Rhodes University College and taught mathematics and surveying. From 1913 to 1915 Finlay acted as examiner in mathematics at the University of the Cape of Good Hope. He continued to work up until his death in 1923.

<doc id="764534" wikidata="Q1272534" url="?curid=764534" title="Japanese scops owl">
<text>The Japanese scops-owl (&quot;Otus semitorques&quot;) is a small owl species in the family Strigidae, or true owl family. It is a member of the genus &quot;Otus,&quot; the scops owl genus. It is resident to Japan, China, Korea, and Russia.

Japanese scops-owls have a grey-brown plumage, red eyes, and prominent ear tufts. They resides in forests, woodlands, and mountains. They are carnivorous, mainly feeding on invertebrates and small rodents. They nest in tree hollows and raise a small brood. Males use their vocalizations to attract mates or deter predators.

== Taxonomy ==
The Japanese scops-owl was first classified by Temminck and Schlegel in 1845. It is part of the family Strigidae, the true owl family, which contains 90% of all owl species. The other 10% of owls are part of the family Tytonidae, the barn owl family. The Japanese scops-owl is part of the genus &quot;Otus&quot; which is the largest genus of owls. This genus includes 59 species of scops-owls found throughout Afro-Eurasia. The genus &quot;Otus&quot; was first introduced by Thomas Pennant in 1769 with the discovery of the Indian scops-owl. The Japanese scops-owl is closely related to the Indian scops-owl (&quot;Otus bakkamoena&quot;) and was once thought to be the same species. It is also related to the Collared scops-owl (&quot;Otus lettia&quot;) and the Sunda scops-owl (&quot;Otus lempiji&quot;). These four species are sometimes considered conspecific and can be combined into a species known as the Collard scops-owl (&quot;Otus bakkamoena)&quot;. The genus name &quot;Otus&quot;, derived from Latin, means small-eared owl.

Three subspecies are recognised:

* &quot;O. s. ussuriensis&quot; (Buturlin, 1910) – northeast China, southeast Siberia and Korea Peninsula
* &quot;O. s. semitorques&quot; Temminck &amp; Schlegel, 1845 – Kuril Islands and Hokkaido south to Yakushima (Ōsumi Islands, south Japan)
* &quot;O. s. pryeri&quot; (Gurney, JH Sr, 1889) – Okinawa to Iriomote (central, south Ryukyu Islands, south Japan)

== Description ==
Japanese scops-owls are 16.5–30 cm (6.5–12 in) tall, and their wingspan is 60–66 cm (23.5–26 in). They weigh 130-200 grams (4.5-7 oz). Their plumage is gray and brown, resembling the bark of a tree which helps them camouflage in their environment. Their wings are long, around 153–196 mm (6-7.5 in), and pointed. Furthermore, like most scops-owls, they have prominent ear tufts. This species has a pale grey-brown facial disc, intense red eyes, green feet, with feathered toes, and a green bill. It is often confused with the Collard scops-owl which is smaller and whiter than the Japanese scops-owl. It is also confused with the Northern white-faced owl which is also whiter than the Japanese Scops-Owl but relatively the same size. This species can reach flight speeds of 80 kph (50 mph).

== Habitat and distribution ==
Japanese scops-owls live in forested habitats such as lowland forests, wooded plain and forested hillsides, as well as woodlands and mountains. They can be found in habitats at elevations between sea-level and 900 meters. They can also be found in the parks and gardens of villages. This species is resident, but it can do small-scale migrations. Japanese scops-owls can move locally depending on the seasons, coming at lower elevations in winter. Japanese scops-owls are found in Japan, Korea, China, and Russia. &quot;Otus semitorques ussriensis&quot; is found in Sakhalin, Ussuriland and Northeastern China. &quot;Otus semitorques semitorques&quot; is resident to the Korean Peninsula, Jeju Island, Kuril Islands, Sado Island, Tsushima Island, Goto Islands, Hokkaido and Yakushima. &quot;Otus semitorques pryeri&quot; inhabits Izu Islands and Ryukyu Islands.

== Behavior and ecology ==

=== Hunting and feeding ===
Japanese scops-owls feed primarily on invertebrates (insects, millipedes, centipedes, crustaceans) then followed by small rodents (voles and mice). They can also feed on small birds, frogs, lizards, snakes and fish. They are active predators meaning they mostly search for prey while flying. Still, they sometimes perch to hunt. When consuming rodents, they most often go for juveniles as it is easier to find sedentary prey such as juveniles in a nest. They hunt in open areas and rely on auditory cues to detect prey and prey nests. Their eyes are adapted to nocturnal living which explains why they hunt at night.

=== Breeding ===
Japanese scops-owls are solitary until breeding season. They are a monogamous species, and they form pairs which they keep through the breeding season. Males lure females with their vocalization to a nest they have prepared. The males often will reuse the old nests of other birds. The females choose their partner based on their nest building skills and how much food is in the nest. Japanese scops-owl nest from March to July. They nest mostly in tree cavities or nest boxes. They lay their eggs in March. The female incubates the eggs for 3 to 4 weeks during which the male will bring her food. Fledgling occurs in May and June. The owlets are born naked with a few down feathers, and they can fly at 4 to 6 weeks. Females lay one clutch of 2 to 5 eggs per season except if the eggs are destroyed. On average, 1 to 3 eggs will hatch. The main predators of this species are snakes and they attack their eggs. Japanese scops-owls compete with Ryukyu scops-owls (&quot;Otus elegans)&quot; for nests since nests that are higher in elevation receive less snake predation. Japanese scops-owls have a lifespan of 12 years.

=== Vocalization ===
Japanese scops-owls have varied vocalizations including screeches, meows, hoots and chatters. They screech mostly to deter predators. Males usually give repeated deep at different intervals. Some of their other calls are described as or notes. They also repeat and sounds.

== Conservation status ==
Japanese scops-owls are considered of Least Concern by the IUCN Red List. They are found throughout a large range and their population trend is stable. They are common and live in close proximity to humans. Still, especially in Korea, Japanese scops-owls are prone to anthropogenic impacts. Traffic accidents, habitat destruction, hunting and poisoning pose serious threats to this species and could negatively affect its population size in the long run.

== Cultural significance ==
In Japanese culture, owls symbolize good luck, wisdom and protection against misfortune. scops-owls can be found represented in Japanese art such as pottery and paintings. They are also often depicted in literature and films due to their unique and mysterious appearance.

<text>Ballyvaughan or Ballyvaghan () is a small harbour village in County Clare, Ireland. It is located on the N67 road on the south shores of Galway Bay, in the northwest corner of The Burren. This position on the coast road and the close proximity to many of the area&#x27;s sights has turned the village into a local center of tourism activity. At the time of the 2011 census Ballyvaughan had a population of 258. The area was officially classified as part of the West Clare Gaeltacht, an Irish-speaking community, until 1956.

==History==

The site was originally occupied by Ballyvaughan Castle, which stood right at the edge of the harbour. It was owned and occupied by the O&#x27;Loghlen family, except for a period in the 16th century when the O&#x27;Brians held it. In 1540, a stolen cow was found at the castle, and heavy fines were levied on the O&#x27;Loghlens—loss of cattle, goats, sheep and the town of Ballyvaughan. In 1569 the castle was attacked by Sir Henry Sidney, but the O&#x27;Loghlens held on to the property. By 1840, the castle was in ruins. Only the foundations remain today.

On the promontory on which the castle was situated (and on which the Irish Cottage scheme is today located), there were also other late medieval dwellings. According to Westropp&#x27;s survey of Clare antiquities, the area contained &quot;three small forts and a much levelled ring of a great Caher.&quot;

The present village grew around the harbour in the 19th century, when it temporarily was a thriving port. Three older piers had been built by the villagers, who used them for herring fishing. However, these piers were almost unusable at high tide and in 1829, the Fishery Board had a new quay constructed. The pier was designed by Alexander Nimmo. By 1831, turf from Connemara was landed here in great quantities, despite the shallowness of the bay. At that point, the town had 23 houses and 151 inhabitants. In 1837, to facilitate the turf trade, another quay was constructed, apparently also based on a design of Nimmo&#x27;s. By 1841 the village had grown to 235 inhabitants and 35 houses. The new quay was of great importance, as it allowed Ballyvaughan to export grain, bacon and vegetables and to import supplies from Galway. For a while, Ballyvaughan was the official capital of this region of Clare, sporting a workhouse, coastguard station and large police barracks. Over time, as the roads improved and the piers fell into disrepair, the town lost its importance as a fishing harbour.

More construction took place in the 1850s: in 1854, the old National School opened, and the present Roman Catholic church was built around 1860. There was also a Church of Ireland, but when this later closed, it was dismantled and re-erected at Noughaval. In 1943, it was rededicated, and it is now in use as a Catholic place of worship (St. Mochua) there.

In 1872 a reservoir was constructed by Lord Annaly, southeast of the town, to supply water to the farms in the valley. This water supply was extended to the centre of town under the Public Health Act of 1874 by the Board of Guardians, using cast-iron pipes. In 1875 a fountain was erected by two brothers from Connemara, the Coyne brothers, stuck in town after their ship had sunk at Gleninagh pier.

In May 1921, an Irish Republican Army (IRA) unit of approximately 25 men successfully ambushed a party of 10 Royal Marines and their sergeant in the village near the old post office. The IRA unit captured some weapons and withdrew. Privates Chandler and Bolton were mortally wounded, and Privates Lavin and Currell wounded. 

The location of the Workhouse, Court House, Fair Green, Police Barracks, Coast Guard, Blacksmith, Hotels, and other buildings of interest can be viewed on these historical maps of Ballyvaughan. The maps also show the location of surrounding pre-famine villages to Ballyvaughan, such as Wood Village in the townland of Knocknagroagh, as well as, other archeological sites that may be of interest.

At the time of the 1942/43 ITA survey, the number of inhabitants was 194. By 1991, this had dropped to 184.

==Economy==

Today, Ballyvaughan&#x27;s economy is mainly based on tourism. Its position on the coast road between Galway and the Cliffs of Moher brings significant pass-through tourism business to the village. Ballyvaughan has numerous pubs, restaurants, shops, B&amp;Bs, self-catering cottages and other amenities. These include the new pier and slipway, constructed in 2006, which has opened up the area to boating, fishing, scuba diving and other maritime activities. Ballyvaughan is located on the Burren Way, a long-distance walking trail.
A previous landmark in the village was the Ballyvaughan signpost. Located at the T-junction in the center of the village, pictures of the signposts had long been used by Tourism Ireland to market the country internationally. The signpost had featured a number of colourful signs, many of which had been installed by private enterprises. Those were removed by the National Roads Authority in June 2011, causing an outcry from some residents.

During the boom, Ballyvaughan had been tagged Ireland&#x27;s &#x27;Gold Coast&#x27; as a result of the huge rise in property prices in the area. Demand for holiday homes had seen the average house price in the town increase from €45,000 in 1995 to a top of €480,000 in 2005.

Although the building of a local waste water disposal/treatment system has been discussed for many years, as of 2016 the sewage of Ballyvaughan is still pumped untreated into the sea. Construction of a treatment works was delayed until 2019.

<doc id="764541" wikidata="Q7545390" url="?curid=764541" title="Smith v. Allwright">
<text>Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649 (1944), was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court with regard to voting rights and, by extension, racial desegregation. It overturned the Texas state law that authorized parties to set their internal rules, including the use of white primaries. The court ruled that it was unconstitutional for the state to delegate its authority over elections to parties in order to allow discrimination to be practiced. This ruling affected all other states where the party used the white primary rule.

The Democratic Party had effectively excluded minority voter participation by this means, another device for legal disenfranchisement of blacks across the South beginning in the late 19th century.

==Background==

Lonnie E. Smith, a black dentist from the Fifth Ward area of Houston and a voter in Harris County, Texas, sued county election official S. S. Allwright for the right to vote in a primary election being conducted by the Democratic Party. He challenged the 1923 state law that authorized the party to establish its internal rules; the party required all voters in its primary to be white.
The Democratic Party had controlled politics in the South since the late 19th century (see Solid South) and the state legislatures of the former Confederacy effectively disenfranchised blacks in the period from 1890 to 1908, by new constitutions and laws raising barriers to voter registration and voting. This crippled the Republican Party in all southern states except Tennessee and North Carolina where exceedingly loyal Unionist Appalachian white Republicanism remained, and resulted in the only competitive elections being held within the Democratic Party primary. Texas had used poll taxes and the white primary to exclude nearly all blacks, Hispanics, and other minorities from voting.

==Issue==
&quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot; questioned whether or not states had the constitutional right to deny voters based on party membership. The Democratic Party of Texas denied Smith the right to vote on the basis of his skin color. Smith was attempting to cast his vote for a Democratic primary in which candidates for the House of Representatives, Senate, and Governor were being nominated, in addition to other state officers. The Texas Constitution states that every person qualified by residence in a district or county, in addition to other factors that are not relevant, &quot;shall be deemed a qualified elector&quot; in Article VI, §2, and Chapters Twelve and Thirteen of the statutes require primary elections for Senators, Representatives, and state officers. The Democratic Party of Texas was a &quot;voluntary association&quot; and protected from interference from the state except &quot;in the interest of fair methods and a fair expression by their members of their preferences in the selection of their nominees, the State may regulate such elections by proper laws,&quot; which is a right that is protected in the Bill of Rights of Texas.

The party is allowed to determine its own policies and membership according to &quot;Waples v. Marrast&quot;, and adopted a policy that all white citizens qualified to vote in Texas were eligible for membership, therefore allowing only white citizens to vote. Holding policies that only allow citizens of a particular race or color to vote is an inherently discriminatory practice. The Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Seventeenth Amendments protect against such actions from any state. The argument, however, is whether the Texas Democratic Party is independent from the state and free to make policies as it pleases. Smith was not allowed to vote in a Democratic primary election on the basis of his skin color. He, the petitioner, argues that since he was not allowed to participate in a state election, the Party is not independent of the state. There were two conflicting Supreme Court decisions that were impeding the judicial precedent for this case: &quot;Grovey v. Townsend&quot; and &quot;United States v. Classic&quot;.

=== &quot;Grovey v. Townsend&quot; ===
In &quot;Grovey v. Townsend&quot;, the petitioner argued that he was denied a ballot for the Democratic party primary election, even though he is a lawful citizen of the United States of America. The petitioner was going to be absent on the day of the election and demanded an absentee ballot. The petitioner was denied the ballot on the grounds of a statute of the Democratic Convention of Texas which stated:

&quot;Be it resolved that all white citizens of the Texas who are qualified to vote under the Constitution and laws of the state shall be eligible to membership in the Democratic party and as such entitled to participate in its deliberations.&quot;

This denial on the grounds of race and color was argued to be a direct and unlawful violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States of America. Denying a ballot on the basis of the petitioner&#x27;s race or color is legal under Texas law, but unconstitutional. The Fourteenth Amendment states that no citizen, naturalized or born, shall have their rights infringed by any law, nor shall they be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor deny any citizen equal protection under its laws.

The main question in &quot;Grovey&quot; was if a declaration of party membership equated state action. The argument of the respondents was that the resolution of the state convention limiting membership did not limit the participation of black voters, particularly the petitioner. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the respondent did not discriminate against the petitioner and therefore did not deny him any Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment rights.

=== &quot;United States v. Classic&quot; ===
In &quot;U.S. v. Classic&quot;, two federal indictments were brought against six election commissioners, alleging conspiracy and corruption in the Democratic primary election for U.S. Representative. They were charged with miscounting and altering the ballots that were cast. The indictment was challenged because &quot;Newberry v. United States&quot; held that primary elections are not subject to the same Congressional oversight as general elections. Therefore, the question was if Congress is allowed to regulate primaries, specifically to protect voters from miscounts or altered ballots. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled that Article I of the Constitution authorizes Congress to regulate elections, in addition to allowing Congress to choose which constitutional powers are carried out.

==Decision==
The Supreme Court ruled 8–1 that Texas was indeed abridging Smith&#x27;s Fifteenth Amendment right to vote, which was also denying his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection under the law. The unconstitutional practice of denying voters based on their race was discriminatory and Texas was held responsible, since it was delegating its authority to the Democratic Party. The &quot;Grovey v. Townsend&quot; decision was therefore overruled and Smith&#x27;s previous denials were reversed. Thurgood Marshall, who, at the time, led the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and would later become the Supreme Court&#x27;s first black justice, represented Mr. Smith in the case. He championed this decision and later stated that this was his most important case.

===Dissent===
Justice Roberts wrote a dissenting opinion for the &quot;Smith&quot; case. The lone dissenter, he argued that the decision would soon be overruled. He stated that three cases had been ruled and subsequently overruled on this issue already, maintaining that the seemingly ambiguous nature of rulings in these cases meant that this ruling did not follow the historical precedent. He also argued that this case was different from &quot;Classic&quot;; in Louisiana, elections are run by the state, making them state elections, but Texas party elections are run by the party, which does not put them under the jurisdiction of the state. Justice Roberts further contended that the decision &quot;tends to bring adjudications of this tribunal into the same class as a restricted railroad ticket, good for this day and train only.&quot;

==Implications==
This decision enabled the revival of black participation in Texas politics, for those voters who could get through the discriminatory voter registration process. Smith&#x27;s efforts inspired Barbara Jordan, a Fifth Ward resident who would later become a black politician in Texas. The Smith case was decided in 1944. By 1948, the number of registered black voters in the South rose fourfold, from 200,000 in 1940 to 800,000 in 1948, and by 1952, it rose to over one million. This decision also helped reiterate the idea that public events run by private organizations, especially elections, are held to the same constitutional standards as all fully public events.

<text>The Republic of India has two principal official short names, each of which is historically significant: India and Bharat. A third name, Hindustan, is also used when North Indians speak among themselves. The usage of &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Bharat&quot;, or &quot;Hindustan&quot; depends on the context and language of conversation.

The name &quot;India&quot; is originally derived from the name of the Indus river and has been in use in Greek since Herodotus (5th century BCE). The term appeared in Old English by the 9th century and reemerged in Modern English in the 17th century.

&quot;Bhārat&quot; gained popularity in India during the nineteenth century. It is the shortened form of the term &quot;Bhāratavarṣa&quot; which is extensively used in the literature of the native religions. &quot;Bhāratavarṣa&quot; is derived from the name of the Vedic tribe of Bharatas who are mentioned in the Rigveda as one of the principal peoples of Aryavarta (the part of the Indian subcontinent settled by Aryans). At first the name Bhāratavarṣa referred only to the western part of the Gangetic Valley, In 1949, it was adopted as an official name for the Republic of India by the Constituent Assembly along with &quot;India&quot;.

&quot;Hindustān&quot; is another common name for the Republic of India and is also derived from the name of the river Indus. It gained popularity in India in the 11th century in Islamic literature and became the common name for the northern Indian subcontinent in Indian languages, though it has been in Persian usage since at least the 3rd century CE while its earlier form &quot;Hindush&quot; was used as early as 6th century BCE. The term &#x27;Hindu&#x27; was the Old Persian adaption of &quot;Sindhu&quot; (another name for the river Indius). &quot;Hindustan&quot; is still commonly used in the subcontinent to refer to the modern day Republic of India by Hindustani speakers.

== India naming dispute ==
The India naming dispute in 1947 refers to the argument about using the name &quot;India&quot; during and after the division of the British Raj. It was between the countries of Pakistan and the Republic of India. This argument involved many important people, such as Lord Mountbatten, the last leader of the British Raj, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League and a founder of Pakistan. By 1947, the British Raj was going to be split into two new countries – Hindustan and Pakistan. At first, Jinnah believed that Hindustan would not use the name &quot;India&quot;, since it did not have local roots there; etymologically and historically, the name &quot;India&quot; meant the Indus Valley (modern-Pakistan). He was also against the use of the name &quot;India&quot; by the new country, the Republic of India, because it would cause confusion about history. The disagreement had big effects on national identity and international recognition.

=== Origin of the name ===
The name &quot;India&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek word Ἰνδική (&quot;Indikē&quot;) or Ἰνδία (&quot;Indía&quot;), which was changed into Latin as &quot;India&quot;. In the past, the name meant the land of the Indus river. This river is now mostly in Pakistan and is the national river of the country.

The name &quot;India&quot; originally comes from the Sanskrit word &quot;Sindhu&quot;. Which is another name for the Indus River and the lower Indus basin (Sindh, Pakistan). The Old Persian word for &quot;Síndhu&quot; became &quot;Hindu&quot; or &quot;Hindūš&quot; (𐏃𐎡𐎯𐎢𐏁) because the Arabs and the Persians spoke the letter /h/ instead of /s/. Darius I took over Sindh around 516 BCE, and the Persian word &quot;Hinduš&quot; was used for the lower Indus area in Ancient Pakistan. Scylax of Caryanda had explored the Indus Valley for the Persian emperor Darius I in about 515 BC. Scylax took the Persian name &quot;Hinduš&quot; and used it in Greek. Greeks pronounced this name as &quot;Indos&quot; or &quot;Indus&quot;. The terms &quot;Indos&quot; (Ἰνδός) for the Indus River and &quot;Indian&quot; are found in Hecataeus of Miletus and Herodotus&#x27;s writings. The loss of the /h/ sound in &quot;Hinduš&quot; was likely because of the Greek dialects spoken in Asia Minor and the word became &quot;Indos&quot;. Hecataeus used the term &quot;India&quot; and &quot;Indians&quot; strictly for the people in Sindh (Ancient Pakistan) only. Herodotus later used the term &quot;Indian&quot; for people in the lower Indus area (modern Pakistan) and all the people east of Persia, even though he did not know the land well.

The general area of historic &quot;India&quot; within modern Pakistan. The Achaemenids called it Hindūš and the Indo-Sasanians called it Hend or Hind (Sindh), circa 400-425 CE.

By the time of Alexander, &quot;Indía&quot; in Koine Greek meant the area beyond the Indus. Alexander&#x27;s companions called India the Indus river basin, which is mainly in Pakistan. Later, Megasthenes included in India the areas beyond the Indus basin, including the Ganges basin. When the British arrived in South Asia, they used the term &quot;India&quot; to refer to the whole subcontinent. This led to the confusion with the name &quot;India,&quot; as it came to mean the British colony that included both Pakistan and the modern Republic of India. After the partition, the modern Republic of India kept the colonial name that originally referred to what is now Pakistan (Indus Valley).

=== History ===
By 1947, the British Raj was going to be split into two new countries – Hindustan and Pakistan. Months before independence in August 1947, both Jinnah and the Muslim League were against the using the name &quot;India&quot; by Nehru&#x27;s Hindustan. Jinnah was sure that Hindustan would not use the name &quot;India&quot;. Jinnah thought this because the name was not local to the area. Etymologically and historically, &quot;India&quot; meant the Indus Valley, which is now Pakistan. &quot;India&quot; was also a colonization term used by the British. However, as independence came closer, it was clear that Hindustan was going to be named India. Mountbatten became India&#x27;s Governor-General, and Jinnah became Pakistan&#x27;s Governor-General. Mountbatten sent an invitation to Jinnah, but Jinnah refused it. The reason was that the invitation used &quot;India&quot; instead of &quot;Hindustan&quot; to refer to the new country. Jinnah wrote to Louis Mountbatten, saying:“It is a pity that for some mysterious reason Hindustan has adopted the word ‘India’ which is certainly misleading and is intended to create confusion.”

— By the 20th century, it was well known that the word India came from the Indus River. Yet even if Mountbatten knew Jinnah’s argument made sense, he would never admit it. In a 1973 interview, Mountbatten admitted he did not get along well with Jinnah and even called Jinnah a &quot;bastard&quot; during the interview. Jinnah strongly opposed the use of the name &quot;India&quot; by Hindustan because the name India, which had a long history, could cause confusion and mislead about history. The history of &quot;historic India&quot;, the Indus Valley (Pakistan), could be mixed up with the history of the modern &quot;Republic of India&quot;. The name was a reminder of history and known around the world.

Many maps printed in the Republic of India after 1947 called the new country Bharat – the Constitution of the Republic of India officially names the country Bharat. Even today, many Hindu nationalists and Hindi speakers in India argue for the word &quot;Bharat&quot; to become the only official name of the country. The word Bharat comes from &quot;Bharatavarsha&quot; (the land of the Bharatas), with these Bharatas being one of the early Vedic groups who moved from the Indus Valley to the Ganges Plain between 1200 BCE to 800 BCE. To many, Bharat would seem better since the term India was a colonial term. It also lacked a local background, as the term India historically referred to the Indus Valley in Pakistan. Jinnah thought neither country would use the name &quot;India&quot;. He preferred the acronym &quot;Pakistan&quot; for his country and &quot;Hindustan&quot; (Land of the Hindus) for the Hindu-majority India. Jinnah only found out months before independence that Mountbatten and Nehru were going to name Hindustan the &quot;Republic of India&quot;. Jinnah, according to Mountbatten, &quot;was absolutely furious when he found out that they (Nehru and the Congress Party) were going to call themselves India.&quot; The use of the word also suggested a larger historic importance that Pakistan would never accept. It also went against history since India originally meant only the area near the Indus River and its tributaries. Thus, Historic India was mostly outside the modern Republic of India and mostly within Pakistan. For this reason, Pakistan is often called by many the &#x27;&quot;Real India&quot;&#x27; and Pakistanis the &quot;&#x27;Real Indians&quot;&#x27;.

=== Current situation ===

==== Bharat–India controversy ====
In 2023, the ruling party in India, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been trying to change India&#x27;s name to &quot;Bharat&quot;. The BJP says the name &quot;India&quot; is a sign of colonial rule and is not a local name for the country.

&quot;Bharat&quot; and India are both official names of the country. The BJP argues that the name &quot;India&quot; is a leftover from the colonial period. Naresh Bansal, a BJP member of parliament, said the name India is a symbol of &quot;colonial rule&quot; and &quot;should be removed from the constitution.&quot; Bansal said in a parliamentary session:“The British changed Bharat’s name to India. Our country has been known by the name ‘Bharat’ for thousands of years…The name ‘India’ was given by the colonial Raj and is thus a symbol of slavery.”Some cities and places in India that are linked to the Mughals and the colonial period have been renamed by the BJP. Critics say these new names are an attempt to erase the Mughals, who were Muslims and ruled the subcontinent for almost 300 years, from Indian history.

==== Pakistan&#x27;s reaction ====
Indian media has reported that Pakistani local media claim Pakistan might try to claim the name India due to the Bharat-India controversy. A post shared by the South Asia Index’s X handle went viral and was reported by several media outlets. It said:&quot;Pakistan may lay claim to the name &#x27;India&#x27; if India derecognizes it officially at the United Nation (UN) level&quot;.

— Nationalists in Pakistan have long argued that Pakistan has rights to the name since it refers to the Indus region in Pakistan. Meanwhile, former Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan said that the original name of the country was &quot;definitely&quot; Bharat and that it was the British who started calling it India. Some Indian media have said that India using the name Bharat fulfills Pakistan&#x27;s old wish since Pakistan has claimed this name since 1947.

== India ==

The English term is from Greek &quot;Indikē&quot; (cf. Megasthenes&#x27; work Indica) or (), via Latin transliteration .

The name derives ultimately from Sanskrit , which was the name of the Indus River as well as the lower Indus basin (modern Sindh, in Pakistan). The Old Persian equivalent of was . Darius I conquered Sindh in about 516 BCE, upon which the Persian equivalent was used for the province at the lower Indus basin. Scylax of Caryanda who explored the Indus river for the Persian emperor probably took over the Persian name and passed it into Greek. The terms for the Indus river as well as &quot;an Indian&quot; are found in Herodotus&#x27;s Geography. The loss of the aspirate /h/ was probably due to the dialects of Greek spoken in Asia Minor. Herodotus also generalised the term &quot;Indian&quot; from the people of lower Indus basin, to all the people living to the east of Persia, even though he had no knowledge of the geography of the land.

By the time of Alexander, in Koine Greek denoted the region beyond the Indus. Alexander&#x27;s companions were aware of at least India up to the Ganges delta (Gangaridai). Later, Megasthenes included in India the southern peninsula as well.

Latin is used by Lucian (2nd century CE). was known in Old English language and was used in King Alfred&#x27;s translation of Paulus Orosius. In Middle English, the name was, under French influence, replaced by or , which entered Early Modern English as &quot;&quot;. The name &quot;India&quot; then came back to English usage from the 17th century onward, and may be due to the influence of Latin, or Spanish or Portuguese.

Sanskrit &quot;drop (of Soma)&quot;, also a term for the Moon, is unrelated, but has sometimes been erroneously connected.

== Indies ==
The term &quot;Indies&quot; refers to the land east of the river Indus. It is fully interchangeable with the word India. Portuguese initially described the entire region they discovered as the Indies. Caribbean islands were initially described as &quot;Indies&quot; as they were thought to be India. When they became known to be in western hemisphere, they were renamed as West Indies. Thus West Indies means India in the western hemisphere. Indonesia&#x27;s former name is Dutch East Indies which means India in southeast Asia. East Indies is a former Dutch colony.

== Bharat ==
Bharat is another name of India, as set down in Article 1 of the Constitution, adopted in 1950, which states in English: &quot;India, that is Bharat...&quot; Bharat, which was predominantly used in Sanskrit, was adopted as a self-ascribed alternative name by some people of the Indian subcontinent and the primary term for India in Hindi, equivalent to the Urdu and Hindi word Hind or Hindustan, and for the Republic of India.

Bharat is derived from the name of the Vedic community Bharatas, who are mentioned in the Rigveda as one of the original community of the Āryāvarta and notably participating in the Battle of the Ten Kings.

The designation &quot;Bharat&quot; appears in the official Sanskrit name of the country, &quot;Bhāratagaṇarājya&quot;. The name is derived from the ancient Hindu Puranas, which refer to the land that comprises India as &quot;Bhāratavarṣa&quot; and uses this term to distinguish it from other &quot;varṣa&quot;s or continents. For example, the Vayu Purana says &quot;&quot;he who conquers the whole of Bhāratavarṣa is celebrated as a samrāṭa&quot; (Vayu Puran 45, 86).&quot;

The Sanskrit word &quot;Bhārata&quot; is a vrddhi derivation of &quot;Bharata&quot;, which was originally an epithet of Agni. The term is a verbal noun of the Sanskrit root bhr-, &quot;to bear/to carry&quot;, with a literal meaning of to be maintained (of fire). The root &quot;bhr&quot; is cognate with the English verb &quot;to bear&quot; and Latin &quot;ferō&quot;. This term also means &quot;one who is engaged in search for knowledge&quot;. &quot;Barato&quot;, the Esperanto name for India, is also a derivation of &quot;Bhārata&quot;.

This realm of Bharat, which has been referred to as Bhāratavarṣa in puranas - after Bharata, the son of Rishabha. He is described to be a Kshatriya born in the Solar dynasty. This has been mentioned in Vishnu Purana (2,1,31), Vayu Puran (33,52), Linga Purana (1,47,23), Brahmanda Purana (14,5,62), Agni Purana (107,11–12), Skand Purana (37,57) and Markanday Purana (50,41), all using the designation &quot;Bhāratavarṣa&quot;.

The Vishnu Purana mentions:
:
: The country that lies north of the ocean and south of the snowy mountains is called Bhāratam there dwell the descendants of Bharata.
::—Vishnu Purana (2,3,1)
The Bhagavat Puran mentions (Canto 5, Chapter 4) - &quot;He (Rishabha) begot a hundred sons that were exactly like him... He (Bharata) had the best qualities and it was because of him that this land by the people is called Bhāratavarṣa&quot;

Bharat Khand (or Bhārat Kṣētra) is a term used in some of the Hindu texts.

In the Sanskrit epic, the &quot;Mahabharat&quot; (200 BCE to 300 CE), a larger region of Indosphere is encompassed by the term Bharat. Some other Puranic passages refer to the same Bhārata people, who are described as the descendants of Dushyanta&#x27;s son Bharata in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

The use of Bharat often has political overtones, appealing to a certain cultural conception of India especially in majority vernacular speaking regions. In 2023, President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi used the Bharat name in connection with a G20 gathering, which caused speculation on a name-change for the country. Such a change would need a constitutional amendment, meaning two-thirds of the vote in each of the two houses of parliament, and an official notice to the UN, advising how to write the name in the UN&#x27;s six official languages. However, it is equally possible that the name was simply selected as a romanisation of the name in English, similar to its use in the opening of the constitution.

=== Epigraphical references ===
The earliest recorded use of Bhārata-varṣa () in a geographical sense is in the Hathigumpha inscription of King Kharavela (first century BCE), where it applies only to a restrained area of northern India, namely the part of the Ganges west of Magadha. The inscription clearly mentions Bharat was named after Bharata, the son of first Jain tirthankar Rishabhanatha.

== Hind/Hindustan ==
The words () and () came from Indo-Aryan/Sanskrit (the Indus River or its region). The Achaemenid emperor Darius I conquered the Indus valley in about 516 BCE, upon which the Achaemenid equivalent of , viz., &quot;Hindush&quot; (, ) was used for the lower Indus basin. The name was also known as far as the Achaemenid province of Egypt where it was written O4-N35-D46-V4-M17-M17 () on the Statue of Darius I, circa 500 BCE.
In middle Persian, probably from the first century CE, the suffix () was added, indicative of a country or region, forming the name . Thus, Sindh was referred to as &quot;Hindustān&quot; in the Naqsh-e-Rustam inscription of Sassanid emperor Shapur I in 262 CE.

Emperor Babur of the Mughal Empire said, &quot;On the East, the South, and the West it is bounded by the Great Ocean.&quot; &quot;Hind&quot; was notably adapted in the Arabic language as the definitive form () for India, for example, in the 11th-century &quot;Tarikh Al-Hind&quot; (&#x27;History of India&#x27;). It occurs intermittently in usage within India, such as in the phrase () or in (), the Standard Hindi name for the Indian Ocean.

Both the names were current in Persian and Arabic, and from that into northern Indian languages, from the 11th century Islamic conquests: the rulers in the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal periods called their Indian dominion, centered around Delhi, &quot;Hindustan&quot;. In contemporary Persian and Hindi-Urdu, the term Hindustan has recently come to mean the Republic of India. The same is the case with Arabic, where is the name for the Republic of India.

&quot;Hindustan&quot;, as the term Hindu itself, entered the English language in the 17th century. In the 19th century, the term as used in English referred to the Subcontinent. &quot;Hindustan&quot; was in use simultaneously with &quot;India&quot; during the British era.

==Jambudvīpa ==
Jambudvīpa () was used in ancient scriptures as a name of India before the term &quot;Bhārat&quot; became widespread. It might be an indirect reference to the Insular India. The derivative &quot;Jambu Dwipa&quot; was the historical term for India in many Southeast Asian countries before the introduction of the English word &quot;India&quot;. This alternate name is still used occasionally in Thailand, Malaysia, Java and Bali to describe the Indian Subcontinent. However, it also can refer to the whole continent of Asia. It was used by Maurya Emperor Ashoka in his inscriptions to denote his realm.

== Gyagar and Phagyul ==
Both Gyagar (&quot;White expanse&quot;, analogous to the names Gyanak for China and Gyaser for Russia) and Phagyul are Tibetan names for India. Ancient Tibetan Buddhist authors and pilgrims used the ethnogeographic referents &quot;Gyagar&quot; or &quot;Gyagar to the south&quot; and &quot;Madhyadesa&quot; (&quot;central land&quot; or holy centre) for India. Since at least 13th century, several influential indigenous Tibetan lamas &amp; authors also started to refer to India as the &quot;Phagyul&quot;, short for &quot;Phags yul&quot;, meaning &quot;the land of aryas&quot; i.e. land of noble, holy, enlightened &amp; superior people who are the source of spiritual enlightenment. Tibetan scholar Gendun Chopel explains that Tibetan word &quot;gyagar&quot; comes from the Indian sanskrit language word &quot;vihāra&quot; (buddhist monastery), and the ancient Tibetans applied the term &quot;Geysar&quot; mainly to the northern and central India region from Kuru (modern Haryana) to Magadha (modern Bihar). The Epic of King Gesar, which originally developed around 200 BCE or 300 BCE and about 600 CE, describes India as the &quot;&quot;Gyagar: The Kingdom of Buddhist Doctrine&quot;, &quot;Gyagar: The Kingdom of Aru Medicine&quot; (ayurveda), &quot;Gyagar: The Kingdom of Pearls&quot; and &quot;Gyagar: The Kingdom of Golden Vases&quot;&quot;. The Central Tibetan Administration, often referred to as the Tibetan Government-in-Exile, asserts &quot;Tibet is inextricably linked to India through geography, history, culture, and spiritually, Tibetans refer to India as ‘Gyagar Phagpay Yul’ or ‘India the land of Aryas.’&quot; Dalai Lama reveres India as the guru with Tibet as its chela (shishya or disciple) and &quot;refers to himself the ‘Son of India’ and a true follower of Mahatma Gandhi. He continues to advocate the revival of India&#x27;s ancient wisdom based on the Nalanda tradition.&quot;

==Tianzhu==
 ( originally pronounced ) is one of several Chinese transliterations of the Sanskrit &quot;Sindhu&quot; via Persian &quot;Hindu&quot; and is used since ancient times in China and its peripheries. Its Sino-Xenic reading is in Japanese, () in Korean, and in Vietnamese. Devout Buddhists in the Sinosphere traditionally used this term and its related forms to designate India as their &quot;heavenly centre&quot;, referring to the sacred origins of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent.

Other forms include (), which appears in Sima Qian&#x27;s Shiji. Another is (), which is used in the Hou Hanshu (Book of the Later Han). () comes from the Kuchean &quot;Indaka&quot;, another transliteration of &quot;Hindu&quot;.

A detailed account of Tianzhu is given in the &quot;Xiyu Zhuan&quot; (Record of the Western Regions) in the &quot;Hou Hanshu&quot; compiled by Fan Ye (398–445):

Tianzhu was also referred to as (, literally &quot;Five Indias&quot;), because there were five geographical regions in India known to the Chinese: Central, Eastern, Western, Northern, and Southern India. The monk Xuanzang also referred to India as or &quot;Five Inds&quot;.

The name Tianzhu and its Sino-Xenic cognates were eventually replaced by terms derived from the Middle Chinese borrowing of *&quot;yentu&quot; from Kuchean, though a very long time elapsed between that term&#x27;s first use and its becoming the standard modern name for India in East Asian languages. Pronounced () in Chinese, it was first used by the seventh-century monk and traveler Xuanzang. In Japanese for example, the name (, , or occasionally ) had been found occasionally in 18th and early 19th-century works, such as Arai Hakuseki&#x27;s &quot;Sairan Igen&quot; (1713) and &#x27;s (, a translation of a work by Johann Hübner). However, the use of the name , which was heavily associated with the image of India as a land of Buddhism, was not completely displaced until the early 20th century: scholars such as Soyen Shaku and who travelled to India for pilgrimages to Buddhist historical sites, continued to use the name to emphasise the religious aspect of their travels, though most of their contemporaries (even fellow Buddhist pilgrims) adopted the name by then.

India is nowadays also called () in Korean, and in Vietnamese. Similar to Hindu and Sindhu, the term &quot;Yin&quot; was used in classical Chinese much like the English &quot;Ind&quot;.

==Hodu==
Hodu ( &quot;Hodû&quot;) is the Biblical Hebrew name for India mentioned in the &quot;Book of Esther&quot; part of the Jewish Tanakh and Christian Old Testament. In Esther, 1:1 and 8:9, Ahasuerus had been described as King ruling 127 provinces from &quot;Hodu&quot; (India) to &quot;Ethiopia&quot;. The term seemingly derives from Sanskrit &quot;Sindhu&quot;, &quot;great river&quot;, i.e., the Indus River, via Old Persian &quot;Hiñd°u&quot;. It is thus cognate with the term India.

==Historical names==
Some historical definitions prior to 1500 are presented below.

==Historical definitions of a Greater India==

<text>Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl (Ketupa blakistoni), the largest living species of owl, is a fish owl, a sub-group of eagle-owls that specialize in hunting in riparian areas. It is native to China, Japan, and the Russian Far East. This species is a part of the family known as typical owls (Strigidae), which contains most species of owl. Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl and three other piscivorous owls are placed with some eagle-owls in the genus &quot;Ketupa&quot;. Its habitat is riparian forest with large, old trees for nest sites near lakes, rivers, springs, and shoals that do not freeze in winter. Henry Seebohm named this bird after the English naturalist Thomas Blakiston, who collected the original specimen in Hakodate on Hokkaidō, Japan in 1883.

==Taxonomy==
Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl was formally described in 1884 by the English amateur ornithologist Henry Seebohm from a specimen collected near Hakodate on the island of Hokkaido in Japan. He placed the owl in the genus &quot;Bubo&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Bubo blakistoni&quot;. The specific epithet was chosen to honour the naturalist and explorer Thomas Blakiston who had supplied Seebohm with a specimen.

Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl is more closely related to the Eurasian eagle-owl than to the subgenus &quot;Ketupa&quot; of fish owls it was formerly believed to be closer to. This was shown by osteological and DNA-based tests in 2003 by ornithologists/taxonomists Michael Wink and Claus König, author of &quot;Owls of the World&quot;. However, the other fish owls are not believed by some authors to be divergent enough to support a separate genus either and so some authorities list fish owls as also included in the genus &quot;Bubo&quot;. 

Given that it shares genetic material and osteological characteristics with the Eurasian eagle-owl, yet also seems to share some characteristics with the other three fish owls (especially the brown fish owl), the place of the Blakiston&#x27;s fish owls in this evolutionary chain is ambiguous. Some authors have wondered whether the Blakiston&#x27;s represents an intermediate step between traditional eagle-owls and the other fish owls, despite the current gap in distribution between Blakiston&#x27;s and other fish owls. Whether other Asian eagle-owls with sideways slanting ear-tufts, namely the spot-bellied (&quot;B. nipalensis&quot;), the barred (&quot;B. sumatranus&quot;), and especially the somewhat superficially fish owl–like dusky eagle-owl (&quot;B. coromandus&quot;) are closely related to the fish owls and/or the Blakiston&#x27;s is also unclear. 

Although a few authors also include them in &quot;Bubo&quot;, the fishing owls of Africa (generally classified in the genus &quot;Scotopelia&quot;) seem to be fairly dissimilar. Based on external characteristics, osteology and preliminary genetic materials, the fishing owls are likely to have some convergently evolved characteristics to the fish owls and have no close relationship. Ultimately, given the lack of specific genetic studies for them, it is not clear how closely fishing owls are related to typical eagle-owls (to which fish owls are related). 

Recent genetic testing in Russia indicates a fairly large divergence from the genomes of typical &quot;Bubo&quot; and suggests that they are indeed more closely aligned with other fish owls.

==Description==

Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl is the largest living species of owl. A pair field study of the species showed males weighing from , while the female, at up to , is about 25% larger. Around February, the average weight of Russian fish owls was in seven males and in five females, typically when their body mass at its lowest throughout the year. Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl measures in total length, and thus measures slightly less at average and maximum length than the great gray owl (&quot;Strix nebulosa&quot;), a species which has a significantly lower body mass. The Eurasian eagle-owl (&quot;B. bubo&quot;) is sometimes considered the largest overall living owl species. The three largest species of eagle-owl, all found in Siberia and the Russian Far East, are close in size to the Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl. According to Heimo Mikkola, the very largest specimen of eagle-owl was longer in bill-to-tail length than the longest Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl, while the top weight of the two species is exactly the same. The longest great gray owl was longer than the biggest Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl but would be about 2.5 times lighter than the weight of the largest female Blakiston&#x27;s. However, the average measurements of Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl surpass the average measurements of the Eurasian eagle-owl in at least two of the major categories: weight and wingspan, making Blakiston&#x27;s the overall largest species of owl. Even the large Siberian races of eagle-owl are slightly smaller on average than the Blakiston&#x27;s, at least in terms of body mass and wing size. In the largest known body mass cited for a Eurasian eagle-owl population, the weights cited, for instance, were a mean for the males and a mean of for the females. The maximum wingspan of the Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl is also greater than any known eagle-owl. The wingspan range known for Blakiston&#x27;s fish owls is . It is possible the largest specimens can attain a wingspan of approximately . The Blakiston&#x27;s is noticeably larger than the other three extant species of fish owl.

In terms of structure, the Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl is more similar to eagle-owls than it is to other fish owls but it shares a few characteristics with both types of owl. Like all fish owls, its bill is relatively long, the body relatively husky and wings are relatively long compared to eagle-owls. It also shares with other fish owls a comparatively long tarsi, although relative to their size the three smaller fish owl have a proportionately longer tarsus. Other than these few characteristics, a Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl skull and skeleton is practically the same as that of a Eurasian eagle-owl. The talons of the Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl are similar in shape and size to those of the Eurasian eagle-owls. It has been stated that the combination of wavy cross patterns on the underside of the Blakiston&#x27;s plumage and its huge talons make it look strikingly like an outsized great horned owl (&quot;B. virginianus&quot;) from below. Two external characteristics that Blakiston&#x27;s share with eagle-owls, but not with the other fish owls, is that its tarsi are totally feathered and that its wing beats are silent, although apparently the Blakiston&#x27;s has relatively fewer sound-blocking combs on its wing primaries than the a comparable eagle-owl would. Among standard measurements, which at average and maximum are greater than any other living owl other than tail length, the wing chord measures , the tail measures , the tarsus is and the culmen is around .

Superficially, this owl somewhat resembles the Eurasian eagle-owl but is more monochromatically brown to tan in colour. Like other fish owls but unlike most eagle-owls, the Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl has relatively broad and ragged ear tufts which hang slightly to the side and that do not appear upright. The upperparts are buff-brown and heavily streaked with darker brown coloration. The underparts are a paler buff brown and less heavily streaked. The throat is white. The iris is yellow (whereas the Eurasian eagle-owl typically has an orange iris). The Eurasian eagle-owl and Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl both occur in the Russian Far East and are potentially could compete for resources, although no scientifically observed interactions of any kind have been reported between these two largest owl species. It is likely, given the sizeable gap between the dietary preferences of the species (mainly aquatic animals in the Blakiston&#x27;s, and mainly upland, terrestrial species in the eagle-owl), that competition for food is not normally a serious problem. Identification of the Blakiston&#x27;s from other fish owls is not an issue as there is a gap of distribution of approximately between the ranges of the Blakiston&#x27;s and the tawny fish owl (&quot;B. flavipes&quot;) and about separates the range of the Blakiston&#x27;s and the brown fish owl (&quot;Ketupa zeylonensis&quot;). Improbably, early naturalist thought that the Blakiston&#x27;s and brown fish owls belonged to the same species. The streaking on the underside of the brown and Blakiston&#x27;s are similar and their songs sound more similar to each other than they do with the two songs of the other two species of fish owl, being deeper voiced with a dissimilar vocal pattern to the latter fish owl.

Vocalizations differ among the recognized subspecies. In the nominate subspecies from Japan, the male calls twice and the female responds with one note, whereas the mainland subspecies has a somewhat more elaborate, four-note duet: &quot;HOO-hoo, HOBO-hoooo&quot; (here, the male call is in capital letters (&quot;HOO&quot;) and the female call in lower case (&quot;hoo&quot;)). The transliterations of the calls of owls from Russia, representative of the owl&#x27;s vocal variations, are &quot;SHOO-boo&quot; and &quot;FOO-foo-foo&quot;. The territorial song or call in Russia in particular has been described as somewhat like a short, deep eagle-owl&#x27;s call. Despite its slightly larger size, the Blakiston&#x27;s fish owls voice is not as sonorous or as far-carrying as is the Eurasian eagle-owl&#x27;s voice is. The fish owl&#x27;s voice is rather deeper, however. As in most owls, vocal activity tends to peak directly before nesting activity begins, so peaks around February in this species. This duet of pairs of Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl in the period leading up the breeding season is so synchronized that those unfamiliar with the call often think it is only one bird calling. When an individual bird calls, it may sound like &quot;hoo-hooo&quot;. Juveniles have a characteristic shriek, typically a startling and slurred &quot;phee-phee-phee&quot;.

==Subspecies==
Of the following four subspecies described in the literature, only the first two (&quot;B. b. blakistoni&quot; &amp; &quot;B. b. doerriesi&quot;) are currently accepted by science. The other two (&quot;B. b. karafutonis&quot; and &quot;B. b. piscivorus&quot;) were likely specimens of &quot;B. b. blakistoni&quot; &amp; &quot;B. b. doerriesi&quot;, respectively, and are presented here only for historical interest. The divergence of the Japanese birds of the nominate subspecies and the Russian subspecies was found to be extreme based on phylogeography, with a point of divergence of at least a half a million years.

==Habitat==

Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl occurs in dense, minimally or undisturbed old-growth forest near waterways including floodplains or wooded coastlines. The species requires cavernous old-growth tree cavities for suitable nest sites. They are easily one of the largest birds to use tree hollows anywhere. Although found near the taiga zone, nest trees are generally deciduous and the species resides in mixed forests. Blakiston&#x27;s fish owls typically require stretches of productive rivers that remain at least partially unfrozen in winter. In the frigid northern winters, open water is found only where the current is sufficiently fast-flowing or there is an upwelling of warm spring water. Slower-moving streams are equally likely to support these owls as the main river channels and they only need a few meters of open water to survive a winter.

==Feeding and behavior==

The Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl feeds on a variety of aquatic prey. The main prey type is fish, with common prey including pike (&quot;Esox reichertii&quot;), catfish, trout and salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus&quot; ssp.). Some fish these owls catch are quite large. Jonathan Slaght estimated that some fish caught are up to two to three times their own weight and has seen owls keep one foot on a tree root to be able to haul a large catch onto a bank. The main prey suspected to be sought out in freezing winter months in flowing and brackish waters at the northeastern limits of their range were sculpin, lamprey and salmon, likely largely juveniles of the latter two types. In the basin of the Bikin River, the mean body mass of fish caught was estimated at . In Russia, amphibians are taken in great quantity in spring, especially Dybowski&#x27;s frog (&quot;Rana dybowskii&quot;), and may come to seasonally outnumber fish in the diet during that time. Crayfish (&quot;Cambaroides&quot; ssp.) and other crustaceans are known to be taken in some numbers, but the extent of their importance in the Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl&#x27;s diet is unknown. There is some evidence of sexual dimorphism in prey selection with males favouring frogs and smaller fish, while females preyed on larger fish. Freshwater crabs and secondarily frogs seem to be numerical as important, or sometimes more significant, as a source of food as compared to fish for the three smaller fish owl species, other than frogs during spring thus far this has not proven to be the case with the Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl. The only owl species to which fish are more significant to their diet is the fishing owls of Africa. Blakiston&#x27;s fish owls seem to co-exist with Steller&#x27;s sea eagles (&quot;Haliaeetus pelagicus&quot;) and white-tailed eagles (&quot;H. albicilla&quot;) on the coasts of the rocky Kuril Islands but nothing is known how they relate with these larger fish-eating raptors, the presence of which has sometimes been theorized as partially the cause of the restricted range of the Blakiston&#x27;s due to competition for similar food resources. However, in other raptor communities, diurnal raptors and owls can co-exist successfully given their distinct times of activity. Furthermore, Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl generally dwells in forested areas while sea eagles are more likely to forage near more open wetland or coastal areas.

A wide variety of mammalian prey are described from Japan and becomes most important to the diet during winter. Smaller mammals taken have included martens (&quot;Martes&quot; ssp.) and numerous rodents. Unidentified bats have turned up occasionally in Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl pellets in the Russian Far East, although bats were much more prominent in the diet of Eurasian eagle-owls there (79 eagle-owl pellets and 10 fish owl pellets had bat remains, respectively). Large mammals are sometimes taken by this species, including hares (&quot;Lepus&quot; ssp.), rabbits, fox, cats (&quot;Felis catus&quot;) and small dogs (&quot;Canis lupus familiaris&quot;). Fewer records are known of bird predation, but they are known to capture avian prey such as hazel grouse (&quot;Tetrastes bonasia&quot;) and a variety of waterfowl species. A case where a black-crowned night heron (&quot;Nycticorax nycticorax&quot;), a rare species in Japan, was chased in flight by a male fish owl was observed but the heron managed to evade capture. A similar case of a fish owl chasing a grey heron (&quot;Ardea cinerea&quot;) has also been reported.

The two most common hunting methods for Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl are wading through river shallows and perching on the river bank and waiting for movement in the water. Other waterside perches may include logs. In this behavior, an individual may wait for four hours until it detects prey and the species is perhaps most often witnessed while hunting in this method. Upon identifying prey, fish owls either drop directly into the shallow water or sail a short distance. It also takes carrion, as evidenced by fish owls in Russia being trapped in snares set for furbearing mammals, which use raw meat as bait. While small prey such as frogs and crayfish are taken back to an habitual perch for immediate consumption, larger prey such as fish and waterfowl are dragged onto a bank and finished off before being flown off with.

These owls are primarily active at dusk and dawn. During the brood-rearing season, these owls are relatively more likely to be seen actively hunting or brooding during the day. For an owl, it spends unusual amounts of time on the ground. Occasionally, an owl may even trample out a regular footpath along riverbanks it uses for hunting. Early reports of concentrations of as many as 5–6 owls near rapids and non-freezing springs are dubious, as these owls are highly territorial.

===Breeding===

This bird does not breed every year due to fluctuations in food supply and conditions. Courting occurs in January or February. Laying of eggs begins as early as mid-March, when ground and trees are still covered with snow. These owls prefer nesting in hollow tree cavities in Japan and Russia. Mature forests with a mixture of coniferous and deciduous trees is usually the preferred nesting habitat. In Russia, trees selected for nesting can consist of elm (&quot;Ulmus&quot; ssp.), Japanese poplar (&quot;Populus maximowiczii&quot;), willow (&quot;Salix&quot; ssp.), Mongolian oak (&quot;Quercus mongolica&quot;), ash (&quot;Sorbus&quot; ssp.), and stone birch (&quot;Betula ermanii&quot;). Nest height range is , but normally is at least of the ground. Reports of nesting on fallen tree trunks and on the forest floor are very rare occurrences at best and possibly untrue. Other than nest cavities, there are very isolated records of nesting on cliff shelves and in old black kite (&quot;Milvus migrans&quot;) nests. Additionally, Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl have now been recorded using temporarily abandoned nests of Steller&#x27;s sea eagles.

Nest cavities have to be quite large in order to accommodate these birds. Clutch size is 1 to 3, usually 2. In Russia, clutches are usually just one egg. Eggs are long and wide and are thus similar in size to Siberian eagle-owl eggs. The males provide food for the incubating female and later the nestlings. The incubation period is about 35 days and young leave the nest within 35–40 days but are often fed and cared for by their parents for several more months. Data on breeding success are scant: on Kunashir Island during a six-year period breeding success was 24%; with six fledglings resulting from 25 eggs. The average weight of fledgling owls was about 40% lighter than adult size, averaging in females and in males. Juveniles linger on their parents&#x27; territory for up to two years before dispersing to find their own. A study in Hokkaido found that male fledglings were about 10% more numerous than females but had a higher mortality rate post-fledgling. Blakiston&#x27;s fish owls can form pair bonds as early as their second year and reach sexual maturity by age three. This unusually long pre-dispersal period may be why this owl is occasionally reported as gregarious, as sets of parents and juveniles will congregate but not unrelated owls.

Once full-sized, these owls have few natural predators. However, they may be more vulnerable to attack from mammalian carnivores since, unlike other eagle owls which typically perch and hunt from trees or inaccessible rock formations, they hunt mainly on the ground along riverbanks. There are two records of natural predation on adults from Russia and none in Japan: one involved a Eurasian lynx (&quot;Lynx lynx&quot;) and the other an Asian black bear (&quot;Ursus thibetanus&quot;).

==Status==

Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl is classified as an Endangered Species by the IUCN. It is endangered due to the widespread loss of riverine forest, increasing land development along rivers and dam construction. The current population in Japan has been estimated at approximately 100–150 birds (20 breeding pairs and unpaired individuals), whereas on mainland Asia the population is higher, at times variously estimated at several hundred or perhaps up to thousands of individuals. Globally and included more recent detailed analysis from Russia, it is estimated that the population consists in total consists of about 1,000–1,500 individuals, or about 500–850 pairs. In the Primorye, it is estimated that 200 to 400 individuals remain. During surveys in 2016-2019 on Kunashir Island, 28 pairs of Blakiston&#x27;s fish owls were registered. In Russia, fish owls are killed by fur-trappers, drown in nets set for salmon, and are shot by hunters. In Japan, death by hunting is unlikely, but fish owls have been hit by cars and killed by power lines. Additionally, cases of exposure to lead or lead poisoning, possibly from bioaccumulation but also perhaps lead bullets in carrion, have been reported in these owls in at least Japan. Given their very small global population, ongoing deaths are unlikely to be sustainable. Local conservation efforts in Japan have been undertaken including education, installation of large nest-boxes and supplemental feeding. Biologists have found the presence of Blakiston&#x27;s fish owls as good indicators of the health and disturbance level of a forest and of fish populations. An additional concern was a clear lack of genetic diversity found in Russia&#x27;s fish owls upon the testing of their genome, with similar concerns expressed in Japan as well as evidence of inbreeding. Evidence has been found of a gradual recovery of the Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl population in Hokkaido but Japanese conservationists are vexed by the lack of suitable habitat and recommend land use changes to encourage the growth of the population.

==Importance to indigenous peoples==
Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl is revered by the Ainu peoples of Hokkaido, Japan, as a Kamuy (divine being) called Kotan koru Kamuy (God that Protects the Village). In Russia, the species is considered a food source by the Evens people in northern Siberia and the northern Russian Far East. In the past, fish owls were hunted as a favoured food source by the Udege peoples in Primorye due to their high fat content, and their wings and tails were dried and used as fans to disperse biting insects while hunting; however, the practice has locally fallen out of favour.

<text>The Philippine scops owl (Otus megalotis), also Luzon lowland scops owl is a common owl, endemic to the Philippines, belonging to the family of the typical owls Strigidae. Other common names include &quot;Otus Whitehead&quot;, &quot;Whitehead scops owl&quot; and &quot;Luzon lowland scops owl&quot;. Everett&#x27;s scops owl (&quot;Otus everetti)&quot; and Negros scops owls (&quot;Otus nigrorum)&quot; were formerly considered conspecific but are now classified as separate species.

Distinguishing features of these birds include their large upright ears from which they get their specific name &quot;megalotis&quot;, Ancient Greek for &quot;large ears&quot;. Philippine scops owls are relatively small, sedentary birds that are naturally found in the forest understory. There are three subspecies which show variations in morphology and are distributed among different islands of the Philippine Archipelago. They are a monogamous species that offer parental care and construct their nest in tree cavities. These owls are ferocious nocturnal carnivores that feed on insects and small mammals. The IUCN Red List considers this species as Least Concern but they may be vulnerable to deforestation and fragmentation.

== Description ==
The Philippine scops owl is a fairly small-to-mid-sized species of owl, but is arguably the largest true species of scops owl. Adults measure from . Their body mass can range from , with females often considerably larger than males. A distinguishing feature of this owl is its large ears that stand upright on its head. They also have big eyes that are dark in the center with a red/orange edge. In general, these owls are covered in dark brown feathers with dark streaks. Their ear-tufts also have a similar pattern. Their forehead is whitish and they have a dark line around their facial disc. There are three subspecies of Philippine scops owl which show three variations in morphology. The smallest morph, &quot;Otus megalotis nigrorum,&quot; has a reddish-brown color, no scapular line, and no feathers on its upper feet. The medium-sized morph, &quot;Otus megalotis everetti,&quot; also lacks a scapular line and feathers on its upper feet but it has a more greyish-brown color. Finally, &quot;Otus megalotis megalotis,&quot; is the largest of all three varieties and also has a grey-brown color but it shows a scapular line and feathers on its upper feet. Other morphological differences between the subspecies can be seen in the length of the tail, the wings, the culmen and the tarsus. These traits are longer in &quot;O. m. megalotis&quot; and are shorter in &quot;O. m. nigrorum.&quot;

There are no significant differences in morphology between male and female Philippine scops owls, although female scops owls tend to be larger in general. The owlets, however, present some contrast as they have fluffy rufous feathers. Once they reach the sub-adult age, they are black and greyish-white until they finally reach adulthood and turn brownish.

== Taxonomy ==
The Philippine scops owl belongs to the S&quot;trigiformes&quot; order and the &quot;Strigidae&quot; family (typical owls). The &quot;Strigidae&quot; family is the largest of the two families of owls and shows a great diversity, with species ranging from 40g to 40 kg. Key features that distinguish owls of this family from their closest relatives (&quot;Tytonidae&quot; family) are their large eyes and the fact that their facial disk is circular and not heart-shaped. &quot;Otus megalotis&quot; is further classified into the Striginae subfamily according to skull morphology. The &quot;Otus&quot; genus (scops owls) is one of the largest owl genera, counting approximately 50 species, yet these species are one of the smallest in size. They are all found in the Old World with the exception of one species, the flammulated owl, which is found in North America. A distinguishing feature between this genus and other genera of the &quot;Striginae&quot; subfamily is vocalization.

The Philippine scops owl is endemic to the Philippine Archipelago. This group of approximately 7,000 islands is prone to speciation and is a great location to study phylogeography. It was formed around 30-35 million years ago and lead to the evolution of different subspecies of &quot;Otus megalotis&quot;. The expansion and contraction of biomes during the last glaciation period as well as the topography in that area lead to isolation of individuals which eventually caused speciation. There are seven &quot;Otus&quot; species in the Philippines, 5 of which are endemic to islands in the archipelago. These species include &quot;Otus longicornis, Otus mindorensis, Otus mirus, Otus megalotis&quot; and &quot;Otus fuliginosus&quot;. The other two species, &quot;Otus mantananensis&quot; and &quot;Otus elegans&quot; are not endemic to the Philippines. The three &quot;Otus megalotis&quot; subspecies are distributed among different islands of the Philippine Archipelago which suggests they could have evolved through speciation from geographic isolation.

== Habitat and distribution ==
Rainforests, mature secondary woodland forests and forest edges are typical habitats in which Philippine scops owls can be found. They are mostly observed in the understory and rarely go above 1000m altitudes, with the exception of individuals which were reported on Mount Data, Luzon. Researchers caught a Philippine scops owl in a net set up at 2m above ground during their study, which confirms that they are mostly an understory arboreal species.

&quot;Otus megalotis&quot; is endemic to the Philippine Archipelago but the three subspecies are distributed in different locations across the archipelago. &quot;O. m. megalotis&quot; species is found mostly in the northern islands such as Luzon, Marinduque and Catanduanes. &quot;O. m. everetti&quot; species exists in the eastern and southern islands including Samar, Biliran, Leyte, Mindanao and Basilan. Finally, &quot;O. m. nigrorum species&quot; is endemic to Negros Island. These subspecies are not known to migrate and therefore have a limited distribution.

Although they are classified as a species of Least Concern, habitat destruction from deforestation and fragmentation is a major threat to their population as they depend on forests for their survival.

Philippine scops owls are sedentary birds with a limited home range. The fact that different subspecies are found on different islands limits intraspecific competition and allows these birds to have a smaller distribution where all the necessary resources are available.

=== Vocalizations ===
Philippine scops owls are a nocturnal species and vocalize more actively at night. Their song corresponds to &quot;oik oik oik ook&quot; with long and powerful notes that are clearly distinguished from one another. The last &quot;ook&quot; is lower than the previous three notes. Their call sounds completely different with a series of three to six escalating notes that are loud and abrupt. From what is known, there is no difference between the call and the songs of females, males and juveniles.
=== Diet ===
These carnivorous owls prey upon animals such as insects and small mammals. During nighttime, they perch in trees where the land is relatively open, which offers them a better view of the surrounding preys. They are ferocious feeders and specialize in tearing flesh. Their raptorial claws, curved bill and excellent hearing and sighting skill make them powerful predators. They have been observed to kill their victim by crushing its head, then breaking every other bone of the body to finally swallow the animal whole. This method has cost the lives of many juveniles who suffocate because the prey is too large to swallow. Philippine scops owls were also noticed to feed on spider species such as &quot;Heteropoda venatoria.&quot;

=== Reproduction ===
&quot;Otus megalotis&quot; is often spotted alone but has also been seen in monogamous pairs. Not a lot of information is known about their reproduction but they are thought to breed throughout the year where females will lay 1 or 2 eggs annually. Sexual maturity is reached around the age of 2 but their lifespan is unknown. One juvenile with two adults have been witnessed multiple times, which supports the notion that they are monogamous birds that display care by both parents.

They construct their nests in tree cavities but also among the roots of dead trees on the ground.

== Conservation status ==
The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this bird as a Least-concern species as it has a large range and is still locally common in some areas. However, despite not being a threatened species, the population is believed to be on the decline. This species&#x27; main threat is habitat loss with wholesale clearance of forest habitats as a result of logging, agricultural conversion and mining activities occurring within the range. It is also caught for the pet trade

Occurs in a many protected areas in Bataan National Park, Bulusan Volcano Natural Park, Angat Watershed Forest Reserve and Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park. While all of these areas are protected by law, deforestation, mining, hunting and habitat loss still continue in some of these protected areas.

<text>Tar Heel (or Tarheel) is a nickname applied to the U.S. state of North Carolina and its people. It is also the nickname of the University of North Carolina athletic teams, students, alumni, and fans.

The origins of the Tar Heel nickname trace back to North Carolina&#x27;s prominence from the mid-18th through the 19th century as a producer of turpentine, tar, pitch, and other materials from the state&#x27;s plentiful pine trees. &quot;Tar Heel&quot; (and a related version, &quot;Rosin Heel&quot;) was often applied to the Poor White laborers who worked to produce tar, pitch, and turpentine. The nickname was embraced by Confederate North Carolina soldiers during the Civil War and grew in popularity as a nickname for the state and its citizens following the war.

==History of the term==

In its early years as a colony, North Carolina became an important source of the naval stores of tar, pitch, and turpentine, especially for the Royal Navy. Tar and pitch were largely used to paint the bottoms of wooden ships, both to seal the ships and to prevent shipworms from damaging the hulls. Tar was created by piling up pine logs and burning them until hot oil seeped out from a spout.

Hugh Lefler and Albert Newsome claim in their &quot;North Carolina: the History of a Southern State&quot; (3rd edition, 1973) that North Carolina led the world in production of naval stores from about 1720 to 1870. At one time, an estimated of tar and pitch were shipped from North Carolina to England every year. After 1824, North Carolina became the leader for naval stores in the United States. By the time the Civil War began in 1861, North Carolina had more than 1,600 turpentine distilleries. Two-thirds of all the turpentine in the United States came from North Carolina, and one-half came from the counties of Bladen and New Hanover.

The vast production of tar from North Carolina led many, including Walt Whitman, to give the derisive nickname of &quot;Tarboilers&quot; to the residents of North Carolina. North Carolina was nicknamed the &quot;Tar and Turpentine State&quot; because of this industry. These terms evolved until the nickname &quot;Tar Heel&quot; was being used to refer to residents of North Carolina. The term gained prominence during the American Civil War, when it had a mainly pejorative meaning. However, starting around 1865, the term began to be used by residents of North Carolina themselves as an expression of pride.

One of the earliest known references to the term in print came in 1863 in an article in a Raleigh newspaper in which a Confederate soldier from North Carolina is quoted:

The troops from other States call us “Tar Heels.” I am proud of the name, as tar is a sticky substance, and the “Tar Heels” stuck up like a sick kitten to a hot brick, while many others from a more oily State slipped to the rear, and left the “Tar Heels” to stick it out.

In 1893, the students of the University of North Carolina founded a newspaper and named it &quot;The Tar Heel,&quot; later renamed &quot;The Daily Tar Heel.&quot; By the early 1900s, the term had been embraced by many, both inside and outside the state, as a non-derisive term for North Carolinians.

==Legendary explanations==
The following legends and anecdotes attempt to explain the term&#x27;s origin.

===Revolutionary War===
According to this legend, the troops of British Gen. Cornwallis during the American Revolutionary War were fording what is now known as the Tar River between Rocky Mount and Battleboro when they discovered that tar had been dumped into the stream to impede the crossing of British soldiers. When they finally got across the river, they found their feet completely black with tar. Thus, the soldiers observed that anyone who waded through North Carolina rivers would acquire &quot;tar heels.&quot;

===Civil War===
The State of North Carolina was the next to last state to secede from the United States of America, and as a result the state was nicknamed &quot;the reluctant state&quot; by others in the south. The joke circulating around at the beginning of the war went something like: &quot;Got any tar?&quot; &quot;No, Jeff Davis has bought it all.&quot; &quot;What for?&quot; &quot;To put on you fellows&#x27; heels to make you stick.&quot; As the war continued, many North Carolinian troops developed smart replies to this term of ridicule: The 1st Texas Infantry lost its flag at Sharpsburg. As they were passing by the 6th North Carolina a few days afterward, the Texans called out, &quot;Tar Heels!&quot;, and the reply was, &quot;If&#x27;n you had had some tar on your heels, you would have brought your flag back from Sharpsburg.&quot;

Walter Clark offers a similar account in the third volume of his &quot;Histories of the Several Regiments from North Carolina in the Great War&quot;, asserting that the nickname came about when North Carolina troops held their ground during a battle in Virginia during the American Civil War while other supporting troops retreated. After the battle, supporting troops asked the victorious North Carolinians: &quot;Any more tar down in the Old North State [North Carolina], boys?&quot; and they replied: &quot;No, not a bit; old Jeff&#x27;s bought it all up.&quot; The supporting troops continued: &quot;Is that so? What is he going to do with it?&quot; The North Carolinian troops&#x27; response: &quot;He is going to put it on you&#x27;ns&#x27; heels to make you stick better in the next fight.&quot;

Likewise, &quot;Grandfather Tales of North Carolina History&quot; (1901) recounts,
During the late unhappy war between the States it [North Carolina] was sometimes called the &quot;Tar-heel State,&quot; because tar was made in the State, and because in battle the soldiers of North Carolina stuck to their bloody work as if they had tar on their heels, and when General Lee said, &quot;God bless the Tar-heel boys,&quot; they took the name. (p. 6)

An 1864 letter found in the North Carolina &quot;Tar Heel Collection&quot; in 1991 by North Carolina State Archivist David Olson supports this. A Col. Joseph Engelhard, describing the Battle of Ream&#x27;s Station in Virginia, wrote: &quot;It was a &#x27;Tar Heel&#x27; fight, and ... we got Gen&#x27;l Lee to thanking God, which you know means something brilliant.&quot;

==Early known uses==
* The earliest surviving written use of the term can be found in the diary of 2nd Lieutenant Jackson B. A. Lowrance, who wrote the following on February 6, 1863 while in Pender County, southeastern North Carolina: &quot;I know now what is meant by the Piney Woods of North Carolina and the idea occurs to me that it is no wonder we are called &#x27;Tar Heels&#x27;.&quot;
* After the Battle of Murfreesboro in Tennessee in early January 1863, John S. Preston of Columbia, S.C., the commanding general, rode along the fighting line commending his troops. Before the 60th Regiment from North Carolina, Preston praised them for advancing farther than he had anticipated, concluding with: &quot;This is your first battle of any consequence, I believe. Indeed, you Tar Heels have done well.&quot;
* An 1863 Raleigh newspaper article, a Confederate soldier from North Carolina remarked: &quot;The troops from other States call us “Tar Heels.” I am proud of the name, as tar is a sticky substance, and the “Tar Heels” stuck up like a sick kitten to a hot brick, while many others from a more oily State slipped to the rear, and left the “Tar Heels” to stick it out.&quot;
* An August 1869 article in &quot;Overland Monthly&quot; magazine recounted an anecdote regarding &quot;a brigade of North Carolinians, who, in one of the great battles (Chancellorsville, if I remember correctly) failed to hold a certain hill, and were laughed at by the Mississippians for having forgotten to tar their heels that morning. Hence originated their cant name &#x27;Tarheels&#x27;.&quot;
* In a letter dated 1864 (in the North Carolina &quot;Tar Heel Collection&quot;), a Colonel Joseph Engelhard described the Battle of Ream&#x27;s Station in Virginia. In it, he states: &quot;It was a &#x27;Tar Heel&#x27; fight, and ... we got Gen&#x27;l Lee to thanking God, which you know means something brilliant&quot;.
* North Carolina State Governor Vance said in one of his speeches to the troops: &quot;I do not know what to call you fellows. I cannot say fellow soldiers, because I am not a soldier, nor fellow citizens, because we do not live in this state; so I have concluded to call you fellows Tar Heels.&quot;
* A piece of sheet music, &quot;Wearin&#x27; of the Grey&quot;, identified as &quot;Written by Tar Heel&quot; and published in Baltimore in 1866, is probably the earliest printed use of Tar Heel.
* On New Year&#x27;s Day, 1868, Stephen Powers set out from Raleigh on a walking tour that, in part, would trace in reverse the march of Gen. William T. Sherman at the end of the Civil War. As a part of his report on North Carolina, Powers described the pine woods of the state and the making of turpentine. Having entered South Carolina, he recorded in his 1872 book, &quot;Afoot &amp; Alone&quot;, that he spent the night &quot;with a young man, whose family were away, leaving him all alone in a great mansion. He had been a cavalry sergeant, wore his hat on the side of his head, and had an exceedingly confidential manner.&quot; &quot;You see, sir, the Tar‑heels haven&#x27;t no sense to spare,&quot; Powers quotes the sergeant as saying. &quot;Down there in the pines the sun don&#x27;t more&#x27;n half bake their heads. We always had to show &#x27;em whar the Yankees was, or they&#x27;d charge to the rear, the wrong way, you see.&quot;
* In Congress on February 10, 1875, an African American representative from South Carolina stated that some whites were &quot;the class of men thrown up by the war, that rude class of men I mean, the &#x27;tar‑heels&#x27; and the &#x27;sand‑hillers,&#x27; and the &#x27;dirt eaters&#x27; of the South — it is with that class we have all our trouble...&quot;
* Tar Heel was used in the 1884 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, which reported that the people who lived in the region of pine forests were &quot;far superior to the tar heel, the nickname of the dwellers in barrens.&quot;
* In Congress in 1878, Rep. David B. Vance, trying to persuade the government to pay one of his constituents, J.C. Clendenin, for building a road, described Clendenin in glowing phrases, concluding with: &quot;He is an honest man... he is a tar‑heel.&quot;
* In Pittsboro on December 11, 1879, the Chatham Record informed its readers that Jesse Turner had been named to the Arkansas Supreme Court. The new justice was described as &quot;a younger brother of our respected townsman, David Turner, Esq., and we are pleased to know that a fellow tar‑heel is thought so much of in the state of his adoption.&quot;
* John R. Hancock of Raleigh wrote Sen. Marion Butler on January 20, 1899, to commend him for his efforts to obtain pensions for Confederate veterans. This was an action, Hancock wrote, &quot;we Tar Heels, or a large majority of us, do most heartily commend.&quot;
* The &quot;New York Tribune&quot; stated on September 20, 1903, regarding some North Carolinians, that &quot;the men really like to work, which is all but incomprehensible to the true &#x27;tar heel&#x27;.&quot;
* On August 26, 1912, &quot;The New York Evening Post&quot; identified Josephus Daniels and Thomas J. Pence as two Tar Heels holding important posts in Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s campaign.

<text>Maximilian Ulysses, Reichsgraf von Browne, Baron de Camus and Mountany (23 October 1705 – 26 June 1757) was an Austrian military officer, one of the highest-ranking officers serving the Habsburg Emperor during the middle of the 18th century. An Irish refugee, he was a scion of the Wild Geese. 

==Background==
Maximilian was born in Basel, Switzerland, the son of Count Ulysses von Browne (b. Limerick, Ireland; 1659 d. Frankfurt am Main 1731, second Earl of Browne in the Jacobite Peerage) and his wife Annabella Fitzgerald, a daughter of the House of Desmond. Both families had been exiled from Ireland in the aftermath of Tyrone&#x27;s Rebellion.

==Early career==
Browne&#x27;s early career was helped by family and marital connections. His father and his father&#x27;s brother, George (b. Limerick 1657 d. Pavia 1729, first Earl of Browne in the Jacobite Peerage), were created Counts of the Holy Roman Empire (&quot;Reichsgraf&quot;) by Emperor Charles VI in 1716 after serving with distinction in the service of the Holy Roman Emperors. The brothers enjoyed a lengthy, close friendship with John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, who was primarily responsible for their establishment in the Imperial Service of Austria. On his father&#x27;s death in 1731, he became third Earl of Browne in the Jacobite Peerage. His wife, Countess Marie Philippine von Martinitz, had valuable connections at court and his sister, Barbara (b. Limerick 1700 d. Mantua 1751), was married to Freiherr (Baron) Francis Patrick O&#x27;Neillan (b. Dysert 1671 d. Mantua 1734) a Major General in the Austrian Service (See Dysert O&#x27;Dea Castle). So, by the age of 29 von Browne was already colonel of an Austrian infantry regiment.

But he justified his early promotion in the field, and in the Italian campaign of 1734 he greatly distinguished himself. In the Tirolese fighting of 1735, and in the Turkish war, he won further distinction as a general officer.

==War of the Austrian Succession==

He was a lieutenant field marshal in command of the Silesian garrisons when in 1740 Frederick II and the Prussian army overran the province. His careful employment of such resources as he possessed materially hindered the king in his conquest and gave time for Austria to collect a field army (see War of the Austrian Succession). He was present at Mollwitz, where he received a severe wound. His vehement opposition to all half-hearted measures brought him frequently into conflict with his superiors, but contributed materially to the unusual energy displayed by the Austrian armies in 1742 and 1743.

In the following campaigns von Browne exhibited the same qualities of generalship and the same impatience of control. In 1745 he served under Count Traun, and was promoted to the rank of Feldzeugmeister. In 1746 he was present in the Italian campaign and the battles of Piacenza and Rottofreddo. Von Browne himself with the advanced guard forced his way across the Apennines and entered Genoa. He was thereafter placed in command of the invasion of France mounted in winter 1746–7, leading to the Siege of Antibes, but he was obliged to break off the invasion and return to Italy in February 1747 after Genoa rose in rebellion against the Austrian garrison he had left behind. In early 1747 he was appointed commander of all imperial forces in Italy, replacing Antoniotto Botta Adorno. At the end of the war, von Browne was engaged in the negotiations on troop withdrawals from Italy, which led to the convention of Nice (21 January 1749). He became commander-in-chief in Bohemia in 1751, and field marshal (&quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot;) two years later.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==
He was still in Bohemia when the Seven Years&#x27; War opened with Frederick&#x27;s invasion of Saxony (1756). Von Browne&#x27;s army, advancing to the relief of Pirna, was met, and, after a hard struggle, defeated by the king at Lobositz, but he drew off in excellent order, and soon made another attempt with a picked force to reach Pirna, by wild mountain tracks. 
The field marshal never spared himself, bivouacking in the snow with his men, and Carlyle records that private soldiers made rough shelters over him as he slept.

He actually reached the Elbe at Schandau, but as the Saxons were unable to break out, von Browne retired, having succeeded, however, in delaying the development of Frederick&#x27;s operations for a whole campaign. In the campaign of 1757, he voluntarily served under Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine who was made commander-in-chief, and on 6 May in that year, while leading a bayonet charge at the Battle of Prague, von Browne, like Schwerin on the same day, met his death. He was carried mortally wounded into Prague, and there died on 26 June.

==Family==
He had two sons, Philip George (1727–1803) and Joseph Ulysses (1728–1758). His younger son, Joseph, succeeded to the proprietorship of his regiment, but was killed at the Battle of Hochkirch in 1758. His elder son, Philip, became a lieutenant-general and a founder member of the military order of Maria Theresa. The last of his line died childless in 1803. Philip was the fourth Earl of Browne in the Jacobite Peerage.

==Honors==
From 1888 to 1918, the 36th Austrian infantry was named after von Browne.

<text>James Plunkett Kelly, or James Plunkett (21 May 1920 – 28 May 2003), was an Irish writer. He was educated at Synge Street CBS.

Kelly grew up among the Dublin working class and they, along with the petty bourgeoisie and lower intelligentsia, make up the bulk of the characters in his works. His best-known works are the novel &quot;Strumpet City&quot;, set in Dublin in the years leading up to the lockout of 1913 and during the course of the strike, and the short stories in the collection &quot;The Trusting and the Maimed&quot;. His other works include a radio play on James Larkin, who figures prominently in his work.

During the 1960s, Plunkett worked as a producer at Telefís Éireann. He won two Jacob&#x27;s Awards, in 1965 and 1969, for his TV productions. In 1971 he wrote and presented &quot;Inis Fail - Isle of Destiny&quot;, his very personal appreciation of Ireland. It was the final episode of the BBC series &quot;Bird&#x27;s-Eye View&quot;, shot entirely from a helicopter, and the first co-production between the BBC and RTE.

He was a member of Aosdana.

A first-year class, &quot;1 Plunkett&quot; at Synge Street CBS, is named in honour of James Plunkett.

<doc id="764593" wikidata="Q702492" url="?curid=764593" title="Urban area">
<text>An urban area is a human settlement with a high population density and an infrastructure of built environment. This is the core of a metropolitan statistical area in the United States, if it contains a population of more than 50,000.

Urban areas originate through urbanization, and researchers categorize them as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term &quot;urban area&quot; contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets; in urban sociology or urban anthropology, it often contrasts with natural environment.

The development of earlier predecessors of modern urban areas during the urban revolution of the 4th millennium BCE
led to the formation of human civilization and ultimately to modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources has led to a human impact on the environment.

==Recent historical growth==

In 1950, 764 million people or about 30 percent of the world&#x27;s 2.5 billion people lived in urban areas. By 2014, it was 3.9 billion or about 53 percent of the world&#x27;s 7.3 billion people that lived in urban areas. The change was driven by a combination of increased total population and increased percent of population living in urban areas. In 2009, the number of people living in urban areas (3.42 billion) surpassed the number living in rural areas (3.41 billion), and since then the world has become more urban than rural. This was the first time that the majority of the world&#x27;s population lived in a city. By that time a high estimate calculated up to 3.5 million square kilometers of land were urban, estimates ranging from 1% of global land area. In 2014 there were 7.3 billion people living on the planet, of which the global urban population comprised 3.9 billion. The Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs at that time predicted the urban population would occupy 68% of the world population by 2050, with 90% of that growth coming from Africa and Asia.

==Urbanization==

Urban areas are created and further developed by the process of urbanization. They are measured for various purposes, including analyzing population density and urban sprawl. Urban areas are generally found in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Japan, Australia, and many other countries where the urbanization rate is high.

Unlike an urban area, a metropolitan area includes not only the urban area, but also satellite cities plus intervening rural land that is socio-economically connected to the urban core city, typically by employment ties through commuting, with the urban core city being the primary labor market.

The concept of an &quot;urban area&quot; as used in economic statistics should not be confused with the concept of the &quot;urban area&quot; used in road safety statistics. This term was first created by Geographer Brian Manning. The last concept is also known as &quot;built-up area in road safety&quot;. According to the definition by the Office for National Statistics, &quot;Built-up areas are defined as land which is &#x27;irreversibly urban in character&#x27;, meaning that they are characteristic of a town or city. They include areas of built-up land with a minimum of . Any areas [separated by] less than 200 metres [of non-urban space] are linked to become a single built-up area.

Argentina and Japan are countries where the urbanization rate is over 90% while Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Mexico, and the United States are countries where the urbanization rate is between 80% and 90%, although within the U.S. state of New Jersey, the urbanization rate is 100%.

==Largest urban areas==
There are two measures of the degree of urbanization of a population. The first, urban population, describes the percentage of the total population living in urban areas, as defined by the country. The second measure, rate of urbanization, describes the projected average rate of change of the size of the urban population over the given period of time. According to Urbanization by sovereign state article, the world as a whole is 56.2% urbanized, with roughly one-quarter of the countries reported as greater than 80% urbanized. Data is taken from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook estimates from 2020.
According to Demographia, these are the 200 largest urban areas in the world by population (as of 2023):
==Definitions==
Presently, urban data are based on arbitrary definitions that vary from country to country and from year or census to the next, making them difficult to compare. 
An Urban Metric System (UMS) has been conceived that could correct the problem, since it allows computing the urban area limits and central points, and it can be applied in the same way to all past, present and future population and job distributions. 
It is based on vector field calculations obtained by assuming that, in a given space, all inhabitants and jobs exert the same attractive force &quot;A&quot; and repulsive force &quot;R&quot;. The net force (&quot;A&quot; - &quot;R&quot;) exerted by each inhabitant or job is given by [1/(1 + &quot;d&quot;)] - [1/( &quot;β&quot; + &quot;d&quot;/2)], where &quot;d&quot; = distance and &quot;β&quot; is the only parameter. 
UMS distinguishes the following types of urban areas, each type corresponding to a given value of &quot;β&quot;:
UMS has been applied to some Canadian cases since 2018, but the data presented in this article are still based on the various existing national definitions, which are disparate.

European countries define urbanized areas on the basis of urban-type land use, not allowing any gaps of typically more than , and use satellite imagery instead of census blocks to determine the boundaries of the urban area. In less-developed countries, in addition to land use and density requirements, a requirement that a large majority of the population, typically 75%, is not engaged in agriculture and/or fishing is sometimes used.

==By region==
===East Asia===
====China====

Since 2000, China&#x27;s cities have expanded at an average rate of 10% annually. It is estimated that China&#x27;s urban population will increase by 292 million people by 2050, when its cities will house a combined population of over one billion. The country&#x27;s urbanization rate increased from 17.4% to 46.6% between 1978 and 2009. Between 150 and 200 million migrant workers work part-time in the major cities, returning home to the countryside periodically with their earnings.

China has more cities with one million or more long-term residents than any other country, including the three global cities of Beijing, Hong Kong, and Shanghai; by 2025, the country will be home to 221 cities with over a million inhabitants. The figures in the table below are from the 2008 census, and are only estimates of the urban populations within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists when considering the total municipal populations (which includes suburban and rural populations). The large &quot;floating populations&quot; of migrant workers make conducting censuses in urban areas difficult; the figures below include only long-term residents.


====Japan====
In Japan, urbanized areas are defined as contiguous areas of densely inhabited districts (DIDs) using census enumeration districts as units with a density requirement of .

====South Korea====
Seoul is the largest urban area in South Korea.

====Taiwan====
Greater Taipei is the largest urban area in Taiwan. 
===South Asia===
====India====

For the Census of India 2011, the definition of urban area is a place having a minimum population of 5,000 of density or higher, and 75% plus of the male working population employed in non-agricultural activities. Places administered by a municipal corporation, cantonment board or notified town area committee are automatically considered urban areas.

The Census of India 2011 also defined the term &quot;urban agglomeration&quot; as an integrated urban area consisting of a core town together with its &quot;outgrowths&quot; (contiguous suburbs).

====Pakistan====

In Pakistan, an area is a major city and municipality if it has more than 100,000 inhabitants according to census results.
Cities include adjacent cantonments.
Urbanisation in Pakistan has increased since the time of independence and has several different causes. The majority of southern Pakistan&#x27;s population lives along the Indus River. Karachi is its most populous city. In the northern half of the country, most of the population lives in an arc formed by the cities of Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Gujrat, Jhelum, Sargodha, Sheikhupura, Nowshera, Mardan and Peshawar. During 1990–2008, city dwellers made up 36% of Pakistan&#x27;s population, making it the most urbanised nation in South Asia. Furthermore, 50% of Pakistanis live in towns of 5,000 people or more.
Karachi is the most populated city in Pakistan closely followed by Lahore according to the 2017 Census.

====Bangladesh====
In Bangladesh, there are total 532 urban areas, which are divided into three categories. Those are City Corporation, Municipal Corporation (Pourasova) and Upazila town. Among those urban areas, Dhaka is the largest city by population and area, with a population of 19.10 million.

===Southeast Asia===
====Philippines====
In 2020, 54 percent of the Philippine population lived in urban areas. With an estimated population of 16.3 million, Metro Manila is the most populous metropolitan area in the Philippines and the 11th in the world. However, the greater urban area is the 5th largest in the world with a population of 20,654,307 people (2010 estimate).

====Singapore====

As an island city-state, about 5.6 million people live and work within . With 64 islands and islets, Singapore Island makes up the largest urban area in the country. According to the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the country has the highest urbanised population in Southeast Asia, with 100 percent of its population living in an urban area. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is responsible for the urban land-use planning, which designates land use and urban density of the country. The country is divided into 5 regions for planning purposes by the URA, even though as a city state Singapore is defined as a single continuous urban area. It is further subdivided into 55 urban planning areas, which acts as the boundaries of planned towns within the country.

====Vietnam====
In Vietnam, there are six types of urban areas:
* Special urban area (2 municipalities): Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.
* Type I urban area (18 provincial cities and 3 municipalities): Long Xuyên, Pleiku, Mỹ Tho, Thủ Dầu Một, Bắc Ninh, Biên Hòa, Hải Dương, Thanh Hóa, Hạ Long, Việt Trì, Thái Nguyên, Nam Định, Vũng Tàu, Buôn Ma Thuột, Đà Lạt, Quy Nhơn, Nha Trang, Huế, Vinh, Cần Thơ, Đà Nẵng and Hải Phòng.

====Thailand====
Bangkok is the largest urban area in Thailand.

===Europe===
====Finland====
As in other Nordic countries, an urban area ( in Finnish) in Finland must have a building at least every and at least 200 people. To be considered a town or a city () for statistical purposes, an urban area must have at least 15,000 people. This is not to be confused with the city / town designation used by municipalities.

====France====

In France, an urban area (&quot;Fr: aire d&#x27;attraction d&#x27;une ville&quot;) is a zone encompassing an area of built-up growth (called an &quot;urban unit&quot; (&quot;unité urbaine&quot;) – close in definition to the North American urban area) and its commuter belt (&quot;couronne&quot;). Americans would find the INSEE definition of the urban area to be similar to their metropolitan area.

The largest cities in France, in terms of urban area population (2017), are Paris (12,628,266), Lyon (2,323,221), Marseille (1,760,653), Toulouse (1,360,829), Bordeaux (1,247,977), Lille (1,191,117), Nice (1,006,201), Nantes (972,828), Strasbourg (790,087) and Rennes (733,320).

====Germany====
Germany has a number of large cities. The largest conurbation is the Rhine-Ruhr region (11 million ), including Düsseldorf (the capital of North Rhine-Westphalia), Cologne, Bonn, Dortmund, Essen, Duisburg, and Bochum.
====Netherlands====
The Netherlands is the 30th-most densely populated country in the world, with —or if only the land area is counted. The Randstad is the country&#x27;s largest conurbation located in the west of the country and contains the four largest cities: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht. The Randstad has a population of 7 million inhabitants and is the 6th largest metropolitan area in Europe.

====Norway====

Norway defines urban areas (&quot;tettsteder&quot;) similarly to the other Nordic countries. Unlike in Denmark and Sweden, the distance between each building has to be of less than 50 m, although exceptions are made due to parks, industrial areas, rivers, and similar. Groups of houses less than 400 m from the main body of an urban area are included in the urban area.

====Poland====
In Poland, official &quot;urban&quot; population figures simply refer to those localities which have the status of towns (&quot;miasta&quot;). The &quot;rural&quot; population is that of all areas outside the boundaries of these towns. This distinction may give a misleading impression in some cases, since some localities with only village status may have acquired larger and denser populations than many many smaller towns with most excessive example of Poznań, most spread urban area of the country with population of the city app. 534 thousand and metropolitan area around 1 million inhabitants. On the other hand, the Katowice urban area with numerous large and medium cities covers 1,468 km and has above 2 million people.
The metropolitan areas in Poland are the biggest urban zones (e.g. Katowice metropolitan area, Łódź metropolitan area and Szczecin metropolitan area) and have great impact on the rural surroundings, as it is around Lublin, Radom, Kielce, Tarnów and Białystok.

====Russia====

Moscow, the capital and largest city of Russia, has a population estimated at 12.4 million residents within the city limits, while over 17 million residents in the urban area, and over 20 million residents in the Moscow Metropolitan Area. It is among the world&#x27;s largest cities, being the most populous city entirely within Europe, the most populous urban area in Europe, the most populous metropolitan area in Europe, and also the largest city by land area on the European continent. Saint Petersburg, the cultural capital, is the second-largest city, with a population of roughly 5.4 million inhabitants. Other major urban areas are Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, and Chelyabinsk.

====Spain====
Spain is a very highly urbanized country. Madrid is its largest urban area. The Southern and Eastern coasts with Barcelona, Valencia and Málaga are more urbanised than the Northern and Western ones.

====Sweden====

Urban areas in Sweden (&quot;tätorter&quot;) are statistically defined localities, totally independent of the administrative subdivision of the country. There are 1,956 such localities in Sweden, with a population ranging from 200 to 1,372,000 inhabitants.

====United Kingdom====

In 2013 the United Kingdom&#x27;s Office for National Statistics (ONS) published &quot;2011 Built-up Areas – Methodology and Guidance&quot; which sets out its definition of a Built-up area (BUA) as an area of built-up land of at least , separated from other settlements by at least . For 2011 census data there are 5,493 built-up areas, of which 501 are divided into Built-up area sub-divisions (BUASD) for which data is also available. Each built-up area is named algorithmically, using Ordnance Survey place-name data.

The ONS has produced census results from urban areas since 1951, since 1981 based upon the extent of irreversible urban development indicated on Ordnance Survey maps. The definition is an extent of at least 20 ha and at least 1,500 census residents. Separate areas are linked if less than 200 m (220 yd) apart. Included are transportation features. The UK has five Urban Areas with a population over a million and a further sixty nine with a population over one hundred thousand.
===Oceania===
====Australia====
The Australian Bureau of Statistics refers to urban areas as Urban Centres, which it generally defines as population clusters of 1,000 or more people. Australia is one of the most urbanised countries in the world, with more than 50% of the population residing in Australia&#x27;s three biggest urban centres.

&lt;noinclude&gt;

====New Zealand====

Statistics New Zealand defines urban areas in New Zealand, which are independent of any administrative subdivisions and have no legal basis. There are four classes of urban area: major urban areas (population 100,000+), large urban areas (population 30,000–99,999), medium urban areas (population 10,000–29,999) and small urban areas (population 1,000–9,999). As of 2021, there are 7 major urban areas, 13 large urban areas, 22 medium urban areas and 136 small urban areas. Urban areas are reclassified after each New Zealand census, so population changes between censuses does not change an urban area&#x27;s classification.
===North America===
====Canada====

According to Statistics Canada, an urban area in Canada is an area with a population of at least 1,000 people where the density is no fewer than . If two or more urban areas are within of each other by road, they are merged into a single urban area, provided they do not cross census metropolitan area or census agglomeration boundaries.

In the Canada 2011 Census, Statistics Canada redesignated urban areas with the new term &quot;population centre&quot;; the new term was chosen in order to better reflect the fact that urban vs. rural is not a strict division, but rather a continuum within which several distinct settlement patterns may exist. For example, a community may fit a strictly statistical definition of an urban area, but may not be commonly thought of as &quot;urban&quot; because it has a smaller population, or functions socially and economically as a suburb of another urban area rather than as a self-contained urban entity, or is geographically remote from other urban communities. Accordingly, the new definition set out three distinct types of population centres: small (population 1,000 to 29,999), medium (population 30,000 to 99,999) and large (population 100,000 or greater). Despite the change in terminology, however, the demographic definition of a population centre remains unchanged from that of an urban area: a population of at least 1,000 people where the density is no fewer than 400 persons per km2.
====Mexico====
Mexico is one of many countries where the urbanization rate is at least 80%. Mexico City, its capital, is the largest urban area in the country.

====United States====

In the United States, the Census Bureau defines urban areas and delineates urban area boundaries after each census. The Bureau defines an urban area as &quot;a statistical geographic entity consisting of a densely settled core created from census blocks and contiguous qualifying territory that together have at least 2,000 housing units or 5,000 persons.&quot; There were 2,646 urban areas identified by the Census Bureau for 2020. 511 of these had a population of 50,000 or more.

For the 2000 and 2010 censuses, the Census Bureau differentiated between two kinds of urban areas: urbanized areas and urban clusters. The term &quot;urbanized area&quot; denoted an urban area of 50,000 or more people. Urban areas under 50,000 people were called &quot;urban clusters&quot;. Urbanized areas were first delineated in the United States in the 1950 census, while urban clusters were added in the 2000 census. The distinction between urbanized areas and urban clusters was removed for the 2020 census.

Urban areas consist of a densely-settled urban core, plus surrounding developed areas that meet certain density criteria. Since urban areas are composed of census blocks and not cities, counties, or county-equivalents, urban area boundaries may consist of partial areas of these political units. Urban areas are distinguished from rural areas: any area not part of an urban area is considered to be rural by the Census Bureau.

The largest urban area in the United States is that of New York City and its surrounding suburbs. The New York–Jersey City–Newark, NY–NJ urban area had a population of 19,426,449 as of 2020, while the larger metropolitan area had a population of 20,140,470, and the combined statistical area had a population of 23,582,649. The next five largest urban areas in the U.S. are those of Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, Houston, and Dallas. 80.0 percent of the population of the United States lives within the boundaries of an urban area as of the 2020 census.

The concept of Urbanized Areas as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau is often used as a more accurate gauge of the size of a city, since in different cities and states the lines between city borders and the urbanized area of that city are often not the same. For example, the city of Greenville, South Carolina has a city population just over 68,000 and an urbanized area population of around 400,000, while Greensboro, North Carolina has a city population just over 285,000 and an urbanized area population of around 300,000 — meaning that Greenville is actually &quot;larger&quot; for some intents and purposes, but not for others, such as taxation, local elections, etc.

In the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#x27;s natural resources inventory, urban areas are officially known as &quot;developed areas&quot; or urban and built-up areas. Such areas include cities, ethnic villages, other built-up areas of more than 10 ac (4 ha), industrial sites, railroad yards, cemeteries, airports, golf courses, shooting ranges, institutional and public administration sites, and similar areas. The 1997 national resources inventory placed over 98,000,000 ac (40,000,000 ha) in this category, an increase of 25,000,000 ac (10,000,000 ha) since 1982.

===South America===
====Argentina====
Argentina is highly urbanized. The ten largest metropolitan areas account for half of the population, and fewer than one in ten live in rural areas. About 3 million people live in Buenos Aires City and the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area totals around 15 million, making it one of the largest urban areas in the world, with a population of 18 million all up.

Córdoba has around 1.5 million people living in the urban area, while Rosario, Mendoza and Tucumán have around 1.2 million inhabitants each and La Plata, Mar del Plata, Salta and Santa Fe have at least 500,000 people each.

====Brazil====


====Chile====
Chile is highly urbanized. The largest urban area in the country is its capital, Santiago.

<text>Bacteriochlorophylls (BChl) are photosynthetic pigments that occur in various phototrophic bacteria. They were discovered by C. B. van Niel in 1932. They are related to chlorophylls, which are the primary pigments in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. Organisms that contain bacteriochlorophyll conduct photosynthesis to sustain their energy requirements, but the process is anoxygenic and does not produce oxygen as a byproduct. They use wavelengths of light not absorbed by plants or cyanobacteria. Replacement of with protons gives bacteriophaeophytin (BPh), the phaeophytin form.

== Structure ==
Bacteriochlorophylls &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;g&quot; are bacteriochlorins, meaning their molecules have a bacteriochlorin macrocycle ring with two reduced pyrrole rings (B and D). Bacteriochlorophylls &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, and &quot;f&quot; are chlorins, meaning their molecules have a chlorin macrocycle ring with one reduced pyrrole ring (D).

Bacteriochlorophylls &quot;c&quot; to &quot;f&quot; occur in the form of closely related homologs with different alkyl groups attached to pyrrole rings B and C and are illustrated above in their simplest versions, esterified with the sesquiterpene alcohol farnesol. Most of the variation occurs in the 8 and 12 positions and can be attributed to methyltransferase variation. BChl &quot;cS&quot; is a term for 8-ethyl,12-methyl homolog of BChl &quot;c&quot;.

Bacteriochlorophyll &quot;g&quot; has a vinyl group in ring (A), at position 8.

==Biosynthesis==
There are a large number of known bacteriochlorophylls but all have features in common since the biosynthetic pathway involves chlorophyllide &quot;a&quot; (Chlide &quot;a&quot;) as an intermediate.

Chlorin-cored BChls (&quot;c&quot; to &quot;f&quot;) are produced by a series of enzymatic modifications on the sidechain of Chlide &quot;a&quot;, much like how Chl &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot; are made. The bacteriochlorin-cored BChls &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;g&quot; require a unique step to reduce the double bound between C7 and C8, which is performed by Chlorophyllide a reductase (COR).

Isobacteriochlorins, in contrast, are biosynthesised from uroporphyrinogen III in a separate pathway that leads, for example, to siroheme, cofactor F430 and cobalamin. The common intermediate is sirohydrochlorin.

<text>The Peralta Stones are a set of engraved stones suppsedly indicating the location of the Lost Dutchman&#x27;s Gold Mine, in Arizona, United States. The &quot;Dutchman&quot; was actually a German immigrant named Jacob Waltz (&quot;c.&quot; 1810–1891).

The story goes that the stones are named for an obscure &quot;Peralta family&quot;, supposedly an old and powerful Mexican family. Some people named Peralta owned a cattle ranch that included what is now Oakland, California at the time of the Mexican–American War. Another Peralta, Pedro de Peralta, was the governor of the Spanish territory in New Mexico, and picked the site for Santa Fe. Nevertheless, the Peralta surname is common in Spain and Mexico, and it became associated with the &quot;Peralta&quot; mine by James Reavis. Reavis popularized the idea of a rich Peralta family in Arizona in 1882 when he tried to assert a phony Peralta Spanish land grant which included a huge swath of Arizona and New Mexico, including the Superstition Mountains. His forged Peralta genealogy was exposed, and he served a prison sentence for fraud. According to current legend, but not supported by the historical record, some Peraltas mined in the Superstition Mountains. The first written reference to a “Peralta mine” in the Superstitions was in 1895, by writer Pierpont C. Bicknell.

==Description==
The stones consist of &quot;two red sandstone tablets and a heart-shaped rock made of red quartzite. Each block is approximately 8.25” (~ 21 cm) by 14” (~35.6 cm) and 2” thick, weighing about 25 lbs. Each red stone block is carved with lines and one long line. When the two blocks are placed side by side and the stone heart is inserted the long line has 18 dots pecked into it. This style of map is known as a Post Road Map and it is a style used in Mexico and Spain during the Mexican–American War. Inscribed on the stones is the date 1847, and one stone contains a Sunken relief or intaglio of a heart, into which the heart-shaped stone fits perfectly. The back of the stone that the heart-shaped stone fits into has the outline of a cross carved into it.

There is confusion about the discovery of the Peralta Stones. Some sources say they were found by a man named &quot;Jack&quot; in 1956 (one source says 1952, another 1949) near the main highway that goes southeast from Apache Junction, Arizona. in the vicinity of Black Point (33°16&#x27;19.86&quot;N by 111°19&#x27;38.36&quot;W). Another item found at this site is known as the Latin Heart.

The two red sandstone map pieces are displayed with a third white sandstone of similar size and weight as the red ones. The history of the white stone was cited by an author using the moniker ‘Azmula’. Azmula cites the history in the Superstition Mountain Journal, issue 27 of 2009. He attributes the original citation to M. Kraig Roberts. Mr. Roberts&#x27;s article is titled “History of the Chain Of Possession Of The Stone Maps”. The Journal article is a history of the white stone. The white sandstone has a side showing a Priest who is assembling the Peralta Stones to form the map. The reverse side is known as the Horse Map. The Priests Stone contains Spanish text that states that to find the gold you must find the heart.

The story of the Peralta Stones&#x27; discovery and the stones themselves are not very convincing to most researchers. The engravings appear to have been created using modern power tools, with modern symbols, and modern Spanish.

Father Charles Polzer, an ethnohistorian associated with the Arizona State Museum, is convinced the stones are fakes. Among other reasons, he says that the modern valentine-shaped symbol used to denote a heart was a symbol unknown to 19th-century Spaniards.

==Treasure map==


According to local lore, the stones contain a map indicating the location of the Lost Dutchman&#x27;s Gold Mine. Various claims have been made about the location of the gold mine based on an interpretation of the stones, and such claims appear at regular intervals—though no one has yet recovered a flake of Jacob Waltz&#x27;s gold.

Claims about interpretations of the map are many, as are accounts of the stones&#x27; origins, and most of those claims are made in self-publishing printers.

According to Lon Safko, the stones were made by the Peralta family and handed down for generations.

Danny Adams, in 2005, read the map as a coded message and claims the stones were made by Ted DeGrazia, a painter and art collector rumored to have burned (or buried) a collection of art worth $5 million rather than pay taxes on his property; Adams claims one of the stones reads &quot;Be ready boy, are on a map on Arizona county scale, scale map&quot; and aided by numerological analysis locates the mine in Upper Labarge Canyon. The treasure of paintings, supposedly hidden in the mine, is also connected, somehow, to a conspiracy of 50 businessmen from the Phoenix area to hide DeGrazia&#x27;s work.

In 2007, William and Michael Johnson (originally from Massachusetts) said that they had identified a privately owned cave as the mine, based on the clues left in the Peralta Stones.

==Location==
The Peralta Stones were held at the Arizona Museum of Natural History, 53 N. Macdonald, in Mesa, Arizona, previously known as the Mesa Southwest Museum. In June 2009, they were to go on extended display at the Superstition Mountain Museum, 4087 N. Apache Trail, in Apache Junction, Arizona. As of September, 2012, the stones are once again displayed at the Arizona Museum of Natural History.

<text>In mathematical logic, an axiom schema (plural: axiom schemata or axiom schemas) generalizes the notion of axiom.

==Formal definition==
An axiom schema is a formula in the metalanguage of an axiomatic system, in which one or more schematic variables appear. These variables, which are metalinguistic constructs, stand for any term or subformula of the system, which may or may not be required to satisfy certain conditions. Often, such conditions require that certain variables be free, or that certain variables not appear in the subformula or term.

==Examples==
Two well known instances of axiom schemata are the:
* induction schema that is part of Peano&#x27;s axioms for the arithmetic of the natural numbers;
* axiom schema of replacement that is part of the standard ZFC axiomatization of set theory.
Czesław Ryll-Nardzewski proved that Peano arithmetic cannot be finitely axiomatized, and Richard Montague proved that ZFC cannot be finitely axiomatized. Hence, the axiom schemata cannot be eliminated from these theories. This is also the case for quite a few other axiomatic theories in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, etc.

==Finite axiomatization==
Given that the number of possible subformulas or terms that can be inserted in place of a schematic variable is infinite, an axiom schema stands for an infinite class or set of axioms. This set can often be defined recursively. A theory that can be axiomatized without schemata is said to be finitely axiomatizable.

===Finitely axiomatized theories===
All theorems of ZFC are also theorems of von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory, but the latter can be finitely axiomatized. The set theory New Foundations can be finitely axiomatized through the notion of stratification.

==In higher-order logic==
Schematic variables in first-order logic are usually trivially eliminable in second-order logic, because a schematic variable is often a placeholder for any property or relation over the individuals of the theory. This is the case with the schemata of &quot;Induction&quot; and &quot;Replacement&quot; mentioned above. Higher-order logic allows quantified variables to range over all possible properties or relations.

<text>Alexander Forbes Irvine Forbes (13 April 1871 – 15 May 1959) was a South African astronomer, architect and artist, best known for his discovery of periodic comets.

== Early life and career ==
Forbes was born in Kinellar, Aberdeenshire, Scotland on 13 April 1871. His father was an amateur astronomer who lived on the estate 
&quot;Blairythan&quot; in County Aberdeen belonging to another amateur astronomer, David Gill. Forbes senior had built his own telescope and shared his interest in astronomy with his son.

Forbes was educated in Scotland and moved to the Cape Colony, South Africa in 1896. He stayed in Woodstock, Cape Town where he worked as a builder until 1907 when he returned to Scotland to study architecture. He completed his studies in 1909 and became a member of the Institute of Architects. He returned to Cape Town and practiced as an architect there until 1932.

In 1912 he participated in a tender for the design of the city of Canberra, Australia and his architectural design was among the initial shortlist of 46 but was not finally chosen.

He lived in Rosebank, Cape Town where he built a 200mm reflecting telescope and a small observatory at his house, &quot;Craigie Brae&quot; which was in Liesbeek Road.

Forbes lectured regularly on astronomical topics. In 1921 he read a paper on &quot;Reflecting telescopes, with practical directions for grinding and figuring the mirror&quot; at the Cape Astronomical Association and in 1927 presented &quot;Satellites and their movements&quot; to the Natal Astronomical Society. He wrote about astronomical instruments for the &quot;Journal of the Astronomical Society of Southern Africa&quot; and notes about his astronomical work for the &quot;Monthly Notes of the Astronomical Society of Southern Africa&quot;.

== Comet discoveries ==
Forbes discovered four comets :
*In 1928 he rediscovered comet Pons-Coggia-Winnecke (now called Pons-Coggia-Winnecke-Forbes or 27P/Crommelin in honour of the astronomer who computed its orbit.)
* 37P/Forbes
* C/1930 L1 (Forbes)
* C/1932 Y1 (Dodwell–Forbes), discovered with George F. Dodwell

== Membership &amp; recognition ==
* Member of the Cape Astronomical Society
* Honorary treasurer of the Cape Astronomical Society 1922
* Alternative member of council and honorary treasurer for the Astronomical Society of South Africa 1923 - 1932
* Librarian of the Astronomical Society of South Africa 1926 - 1930
* President of the Astronomical Society of South Africa 1942 - 1943
* Director of the Comet Section, Cape Astronomical Society 1929 - 1945
* Director of the Zodiacal Light Section, Cape Astronomical Society 1934 - 1945
* 127th Donohoe Comet Award 1929 (for 27P/Crommelin). He received 3 other Donohoe Comet awards for other discoveries.

== Personal life ==
Forbes married Louisa Elizabeth Henrietta Crowther on 18 September 1900 in the Cape Province. He retired to Hermanus in 1932, where he built another observatory at his house &quot;Blairythan&quot; and moved the telescope from Rosebank to Hermanus. He designed the house and crafted all of its doors himself. Here he continued his observations as well as his architectural work and painting. In 1956 he returned to Cape Town owing to ill health and lived with his niece, Mrs. Hewiston until his death in 1959.

In 2009 one of his paintings, &quot;Hermanus Coast Line&quot; was sold at auction.

<text>Fox River Mall is an enclosed super-regional shopping center located in Grand Chute, Wisconsin, United States, which serves the Appleton, Wisconsin metropolitan area. It is a major driver of the local economy and its construction helped spur the growth of the Grand Chute shopping district, which is today known as the &quot;shopping capital of Wisconsin&quot;. At 1.21 million square feet, it is one of the largest malls in the state.

The anchor stores are Macy&#x27;s, JCPenney, Target, and Scheels All Sports. There are 2 vacant anchor stores that were once Sears and Younkers.

== History ==
Before the mall was built, the Appleton Metropolitan area was considered to be the only major metropolitan area in the United States that did not have a major regional mall to strengthen its economy. Local business leaders got together and encouraged a developer to build a mall. At this time the west side of Interstate 41 was largely undeveloped, making it the perfect place to build the mall. Since its opening, this region has been greatly developed and brings many visitors and businesses to the Appleton Metropolitan area. Today it contributes about 1 billion dollars annually to the local economy.

The mall opened on July 18, 1984, with one anchor store, Sears, along with 67 other stores, a movie theater, and a Walgreens drugstore. Expanded several times in its history, including in 1991 when Dayton&#x27;s built a new location, which eventually became Marshall Field&#x27;s, and is now Macy&#x27;s. With the last major renovation occurring in 2004, it became the largest mall in Wisconsin in 2014, with 1.2 million square feet.

In May 2018, the mall&#x27;s Younkers location closed. It had been an anchor tenant for 26 years.

On December 28, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 80 stores nationwide. The store closed on March 17, 2019.

== Facilities ==
The Fox River Mall is located on approximately of land. It is the largest shopping mall in Wisconsin, with over 140 stores. It has a food court called the Northwoods Café, which includes more than a dozen counter vendors. Fox River Plaza is a strip mall on the premises.

The main campus has a total retail area of . Some stores and restaurants are located in separate outbuildings off the main campus, making for a total retail area of .


Fox River Mall is owned by Brookfield Properties.

<text>The Verde River (Yavapai: Haka&#x27;he:la) is a major tributary of the Salt River in the U.S. state of Arizona. It is about long and carries a mean flow of at its mouth. It is one of the largest perennial streams in Arizona.

== Description ==
The river begins below the dam at Sullivan Lake, fed by Big Chino Wash and Williamson Valley Wash in Yavapai County. The Verde flows freely for through private, state, tribal and United States Forest Service lands, specifically the Prescott National Forest, Coconino National Forest and Tonto National Forest, before encountering the first of two dams that make Horseshoe Lake and Bartlett Lake. The cities of Camp Verde, Clarkdale and Cottonwood are the main population centers along the river. The Verde River and the Salt River converge on the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community. The Salt River flows into the Gila River west of Phoenix.

In 1984, the United States Congress designated of the Verde River as Wild and Scenic through the National Wild and Scenic River program. The Scenic portion begins at Beasley Flats and extends downstream about to the northern boundary of the Mazatzal Wilderness. The Wild portion extends from there to the mouth of Red Creek, about further downstream.

In 1986, a stretch of the river was identified by the state of Arizona as a critical natural resource. This reach of the Verde River and its associated riparian zone, between the town of Clarkdale (near Tuzigoot National Monument) and the Bridgeport State Route 89A Bridge, became part of the Arizona State Parks system. The park, called the Verde River Greenway State Natural Area, encompasses . Dead Horse Ranch State Park, near Cottonwood, is adjacent to the Greenway.

At Drake, Arizona, its canyon is termed &quot;Hell Canyon&quot;, and it is spanned by the Hell Canyon Bridge, a road bridge built in 1923, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Flora and fauna==
Plants found in riparian zones along the river include ailanthus, Arizona alder, sycamore, and walnut trees; a variety of willows; reeds, cattails, box elder, and saltcedar, among others. Aquatic vertebrates along the Verde River include North American beaver, belted kingfishers, great blue herons, otters, Chiricahua leopard frogs, Sonoran mud turtles, and others. Among the 27 species of fish found in the river are carp, flathead catfish, roundtail chub, Gila chub, bass, desert sucker, mosquitofish, red shiner, and Sonora sucker.

Beaver were trapped &quot;with considerable success&quot; on the Verde River by fur trappers led by Ewing Young, and including Kit Carson, dating to 1829. Edgar Alexander Mearns wrote in his 1907 naturalist survey &quot;Mammals of the Mexican Boundary of the United States&quot; that beaver were present on nearly all streams of the Colorado Basin. Re-introductions of beaver in recent times have transformed even small desert streams into robust riparian habitat, increasing species abundance and diversity.

==Recreation==
Floating the Verde River in rafts and kayaks is a popular pastime as it runs through scenic valleys and the Mazatzal Wilderness. The facilities described below are maintained by the Tonto National Forest authority. Kayak rentals, shuttles, boating gear and services are available in Clarkdale, Cottonwood and Camp Verde. Several commercial outfitters offer guided trips on the Verde River. Popular stretches for commercial boating include the Verde River @ Clarkdale, beginning at the Lower TAPCO River Access Point (RAP) and floating to the Tuzigoot RAP in Clarkdale; Skidmore RAP to Black Canyon RAP or Bignotti RAP on the Prescott National Forest between Cottonwood and Camp Verde; and White Bridge RAP to Clear Creek RAP or Beasley Flat RAP on the Prescott National Forest below Camp Verde.

===Sport fishing===
The Verde River above Camp Verde has about of fishable waters at an average elevation of above sea level. The nearest town with fuel, restaurants, lodging, groceries, and fishing tackle is Cottonwood. Fish species frequenting this stretch of the river include largemouth bass, redeye bass, sunfish, channel catfish, flathead catfish, yellow perch, chub, carp, and, in winter, rainbow trout. Crayfish and bullfrogs are also found.

From Camp Verde to Horseshoe Lake, about of fishable waters are at an average elevation of . The nearest town with fuel and other supplies and amenities is Camp Verde. Species along this stretch include largemouth and smallmouth bass, sunfish, channel and flathead catfish, carp, crayfish, and bullfrogs.

The same species that are found between Camp Verde and Horseshoe Lake are also present along a stretch of the river from Horseshoe Lake to Bartlett Lake. The elevation along this stretch averages above sea level. The nearest town with fuel and supplies is Carefree.

Below Bartlett Lake, the elevation averages over the next . Species here include largemouth bass, sunfish, channel and flathead catfish, tilapia, carp, crayfish, and bullfrogs. The nearest town with fuel and supplies is Fountain Hills.

<doc id="764618" wikidata="Q726211" url="?curid=764618" title="Jim Plunkett">
<text>James William Plunkett (born December 5, 1947) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 16 seasons. He achieved his greatest success during his final eight seasons with the Raiders franchise, whom he led to two Super Bowl wins.

He played college football for the Stanford Indians, where he won the Heisman Trophy in 1970. He was selected first overall by the New England Patriots in the 1971 NFL draft. His tenure with the Patriots was productive, but after an injury-shortened 1975 season he was traded to the San Francisco 49ers, where he played in 1976 and 1977. Released from the 49ers after suffering further injuries, Plunkett signed with the Oakland Raiders in 1978.

Initially serving as a backup for the Raiders, Plunkett became the starting quarterback during the 1980 season and led them to win Super Bowl XV, where he was named MVP. In 1983, Plunkett again ascended from backup to starter to quarterback the relocated Los Angeles Raiders to victory in Super Bowl XVIII. He and Eli Manning are the only eligible quarterbacks with two Super Bowl wins as a starter not to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1990.

==Early life==
Plunkett was born to Mexican-American parents with an Irish-German grandfather on his paternal side. Plunkett&#x27;s father was a news vendor afflicted with progressive blindness, who had to support his blind wife along with their three children. Plunkett&#x27;s parents were both born in New Mexico; his mother, whose maiden name was Carmen Blea, was born in Santa Fe and his father, William Gutierrez Plunkett, was born in Albuquerque. Carmen was also of Native American ancestry. His father William died of a heart attack in 1969.

The Plunketts moved to California during World War II. William Plunkett first worked in the Richmond shipyards. By this time, Jim&#x27;s two older sisters, Genevieve (16 years older than Jim) and Mary Ann (5 years older than Jim) had been born; Jim was born in 1947, after the family had moved to Santa Clara. They later moved to San Jose where William ran a newsstand, and where they were able to find low-cost housing. The family lived in relative poverty, and received state financial aid. Jim and his sisters learned to work hard and do things for themselves as they grew up. They also helped Carmen with cooking and other household chores.

When Jim was growing up, the family&#x27;s financial situation was a big problem for him. He did not like the area he lived in, often did not have money for dates, and avoided bringing friends to his house. He worked from an early age, cleaning up at a gas station while in elementary school, delivering newspapers, bagging groceries, and working in orchards. In his high school years, he worked during the summer.

Jim went to William C. Overfelt High School in the 9th and 10th grades and then transferred to and graduated from James Lick High School, both located in east San Jose, California. Plunkett showed his talent for tossing the football by winning a throwing contest at the age of 14 with a heave of over 60 yards. Once he arrived at the school, he played quarterback and defensive end for the football team. He competed in basketball, baseball, track, and wrestling – earning a California High School Individual Wrestling Championship. Plunkett is on the Hall of Fame wall at James Lick.

==College career==
Upon entering Stanford University, Plunkett endured a rough freshman campaign after being weakened by a thyroid operation. His performance originally caused head coach John Ralston to switch him to defensive end, but Plunkett was adamant in remaining at quarterback, throwing 500 to 1,000 passes every day to polish his arm. He earned the opportunity to start in 1968, and in his first game, completed ten of thirteen passes for 277 yards and four touchdowns, and never relinquished his hold on the starting spot. Plunkett&#x27;s arrival ushered in an era of wide-open passing, pro-style offenses in the Pac-8, a trend that has continued to the present.

His successful junior campaign saw him set league records for touchdown passes (20), passing yards (2,673), and total offense (2,786). This display of offensive firepower led Washington State coach Jim Sweeney to call Plunkett &quot;The best college football player I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; In his senior year, 1970, he led Stanford to a conference championship and their first Rose Bowl appearance since 1952, a game that ended with a 27–17 Stanford victory over the heavily favored Ohio State Buckeyes.

With eighteen passing and three rushing touchdowns added to his 2,715 passing yards on the year (which broke his own conference record), Plunkett was awarded the 1970 Heisman Trophy. Plunkett beat Notre Dame&#x27;s Joe Theismann and Archie Manning of Ole Miss to win the award. He was the first Latino to win the Heisman Trophy. Aside from the Heisman, he captured the Maxwell Award for the nation&#x27;s best player and was named player of the year by United Press International, &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, and &quot;SPORT&quot; magazine. In addition, the American College Football Coaches Association designated him as their Offensive Player of the Year. He became the second multiple recipient of the W.J. Voit Memorial Trophy, awarded each year to the outstanding football player on the Pacific Coast. Plunkett received the Voit Trophy in both 1969 and 1970. While at Stanford he joined Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity.

==Professional career==

UCLA coach Tommy Prothro had called Plunkett the &quot;best pro quarterback prospect I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;, echoing Sweeney&#x27;s words from the year prior. His excellent arm strength and precision made him attractive to pro teams that relied much more heavily on the passing game than most college teams of the late 1960s. In 1971, he was drafted with the first overall pick in the NFL draft by the New England Patriots (the team was still known as the Boston Patriots at the time of the draft; the name change to New England did not become official until March 21 of that year). Plunkett was the first player of Hispanic heritage to be drafted with the first overall pick in the NFL draft. The Patriots finished the season at 6–8 for fourth place in the AFC East. Plunkett&#x27;s first game was a 20–6 victory over the Oakland Raiders, the Patriots&#x27; first regular-season contest at Schaefer Stadium. New England also influenced the AFC East championship race, as Plunkett&#x27;s 88-yard fourth-quarter touchdown pass to former Stanford teammate Randy Vataha on the final day of the season dropped the Baltimore Colts to a 10–4–0 record and into second place in the division behind the 10–3–1 Miami Dolphins. Two weeks before the Patriots defeated the Colts, Plunkett engineered a 34–13 victory over the Dolphins.

Continuing to be effective, Plunkett finished second in the NFL in passing yards in 1973, and in 1974 led the Patriots to an impressive 6–1 start, and the team&#x27;s first non losing season in eight years, finishing second in the NFL in team scoring with 348 points, seven behind league leader Oakland. But Plunkett suffered a left shoulder separation early in the 1975 season, giving rookie Steve Grogan, who would become a fixture with the club for 16 seasons, extensive experience, and under the leadership of coach Chuck Fairbanks, New England&#x27;s offense became more run-oriented, led by Sam Cunningham.

Prior to the 1976 NFL draft, Plunkett was traded to the San Francisco 49ers in exchange for quarterback Tom Owen, two first-round picks in 1976, and a first and second-round pick in 1977. Plunkett led the 49ers to a 6–1 start before faltering to an 8–6 record. After a 5–9 season in 1977, the 49ers released him during the 1978 preseason.

Plunkett joined the Oakland Raiders in 1978, serving in a reserve capacity over the next two years, throwing no passes in 1978 and just fifteen in 1979. However, five weeks into the 1980 season, his career took a major turn when starting QB Dan Pastorini fractured his leg in a game against the Kansas City Chiefs. The 32-year-old Plunkett came off the bench to relieve Pastorini, throwing five interceptions in a 31–17 loss. The Raiders, however, believing that Marc Wilson did not have the experience they wanted, called on Plunkett to start for the remainder of the year. In his first game as a starter, he completed eleven of fourteen passes with a touchdown and no interceptions. Plunkett guided Oakland to nine victories in eleven games and a playoff berth as a wild card. Plunkett led the Raiders to four playoff victories, including the first-ever victory by a wild card team in the Super Bowl, defeating the Philadelphia Eagles 27–10 in Super Bowl XV. Throwing for 261 yards and three touchdowns, Plunkett was named the game&#x27;s MVP; subsequently, Plunkett has the distinction of being the first minority to quarterback a team to a Super Bowl victory and the only Latino to be named Super Bowl MVP. In addition to this, he became the second of four players to win the Heisman Trophy and Super Bowl MVP, alongside Roger Staubach, Marcus Allen, and Desmond Howard.

Later in his career, the Raiders moved to Los Angeles. After being benched early in the 1983 season, Plunkett again assumed starting duties, this time after an injury to Marc Wilson. The Raiders advanced to Super Bowl XVIII, where they defeated the Washington Redskins, 38–9. Plunkett completed 16 of 25 passes for 172 yards and a touchdown in the game.

In 1984, Plunkett began the season as the Raiders&#x27; starter, but he suffered abdominal and hip injuries in Week 6 which made Wilson the starter for the rest of the season. The more experienced Plunkett was named the starter for the playoffs, but the Raiders lost to the Seattle Seahawks in the wild card game. In 1985, Plunkett was again injured, this time with a separated shoulder in Week 3. In 1986, he rotated with Wilson as the starter, and then missed the entire 1987 season following rotator cuff surgery. He retired during the 1988 pre-season as the fourth-leading passer in Raiders history. He holds the Raider record, and is tied for the league record, for the longest career pass, which occurred during a 99-yard pass play against the Washington Redskins on October 2, 1983. He retired as the only NFL quarterback to win two Super Bowls with the same franchise in different cities, winning his first while the Raiders were in Oakland and his second while they were in Los Angeles.

<doc id="764621" wikidata="Q359754" url="?curid=764621" title="Konstantin Pobedonostsev">
<text>Konstantin Petrovich Pobedonostsev (; 30 November 1827 – 23 March 1907) was a Russian jurist and statesman who served as an adviser to three Russian emperors. During the reign of Alexander III of Russia, Pobedonostsev was considered the chief spokesman for reactionary positions and the éminence grise of imperial politics. Between 1880 and 1905, he served as Over-Procurator of the Most Holy Synod, making him the non-clerical Russian official who supervised the Russian Orthodox Church.

His writings on politics, law, art, and culture emphasized the positive element of the spiritual and secular unification of Russia with the acceptance of Christianity, while simultaneously condemning the Jewish population. He warned of the negative element in Russia, portraying democratic and liberal movements as enemies of the national and religious unity of the Russian people. He opined that the task of achieving a harmonious society meant there was a collective responsibility to uphold political and religious unity, which justified the close supervision of Russian behaviour and thinking as a necessity.

==Life==
Pobedonostsev&#x27;s father, Pyotr Vasilyevich Pobedonostsev, was a professor of literature at Moscow State University. In 1841, he sent his son, then aged 14, to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in St. Petersburg, which had been established to prepare young men for civil service. After graduation, Konstantin Pobedonostsev entered the public service as an official in the eighth Moscow department of the Senate. The task of the department was to resolve civil cases from guberniyas surrounding Moscow. He was promoted rapidly within the eighth department.

From 1860 to 1865, he taught civil law at Moscow State University. In 1861, Tsar Alexander II invited him to instruct his son and heir, Nicholas, in the theory of law and administration. In 1865, young Nicholas died, and Pobedonostsev was invited to teach Nicholas&#x27;s brother Alexander (the future Tsar Alexander III). In 1866, Pobedonostsev moved to a permanent residence in St. Petersburg. Pobedonostsev and Tsarevich Alexander remained very close for almost thirty years, through Alexander&#x27;s ascension as Tsar in 1881 and until his death in 1894.

He became a member of the Council of the Empire, and in 1880, Chief Procurator of the Most Holy Synod. In the latter office, Pobedonostsev was operating head of the Russian Orthodox Church. During the reign of Alexander III, he was one of the most influential men in Imperial Russia. He was the mastermind of Manifesto on Unshakeable Autocracy of 29 April 1881, which proclaimed that the absolute power of the Tsar was unshakable, thus putting an end to Loris-Melikov&#x27;s endeavours to establish a representative body in the empire.

Pobedonostsev&#x27;s ascension in the first days after the assassination of Alexander II resulted in the subsequent resignation of Loris-Melikov and other ministers eager for liberal reforms. He was an uncompromising conservative and never shrank from boldly expressing his staunch opinions. He also used his home as a meeting-place for monarchist terrorists who were conspiring, and where he issued a manifesto, with the approval of Alexander the Second, demanding the abolishment of the constitutional movement: &quot;Amid our affliction, the voice of God orders us to vigorously take the ruling power in our own hands...&quot; He was chosen as a firm, severe hand to take over the universities after the 1899 mass student strikes. Consequently, in progressive circles he was denounced as an obscurantist, pedant, and an enemy of progress.

After the death of Alexander III, he lost much of his influence. Tsar Nicholas II adhered to his father&#x27;s Russification policy and even extending it to Finland, but he generally disliked the idea of systematic religious persecution, and was not wholly averse to the partial emancipation of the Church from civil control.
 On March 8, 1901, Nikolai Lagovsky, a socialist civil servant and statistician, tried to kill Pobedonostsev, shooting through the window of Pobedonostsev&#x27;s office. He fired six times and all missed his target. Lagovsky said Pobedonostev, &quot;spread superstition and ignorance among the people through church schools.&quot; Lagovski was sentenced to 6 years of katorga.

Pobedonostsev ordered Tolstoy&#x27;s excommunication in 1901.

During the Russian Revolution of 1905 which followed the disastrous war with Japan, Pobedonostsev, being nearly 80 years of age, retired from public affairs. He died on 23 March 1907.

He was fictionalized as old senator Ableukhov in Andrey Bely&#x27;s novel &quot;Petersburg&quot; (1912). Arguably he was also depicted in Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; as Alexei Alexandrovich Karenin.

==Jurisprudence==
Though Pobedonostsev is mostly known as a statesman and thinker, his contribution to Russian civil law is significant. He is generally regarded as one of the most educated European jurists of the 19th century. His main work was the three-volume &quot;Course of Civil Law&quot; (Курс гражданского права), published in 1868, 1871 and 1880, respectively.

Before the Russian Revolution of 1905, the Course was reprinted several times with minor changes. The Course was regarded as outstanding guide for practising lawyers. Quotations from the Course are reported to have been used as a ground for decisions of the Civil Board of the Senate. The author&#x27;s profound knowledge of Russian civil law resulted in description of many previously insufficiently explored institutions such as communal land law.

In addition, Pobedonostsev published in 1865 in &quot;Moskovskie Vedomosti&quot; several anonymous articles on the judicial reform of Alexander II.

==Doctrines and policies==

Pobedonostsev held the view that human nature is sinful, rejecting the ideals of freedom and independence as dangerous delusions of nihilistic youth.

In his &quot;Reflections of a Russian Statesman&quot; (1896), he promoted autocracy and condemned elections, representation and democracy, the jury system, the press, free education, charities, and social reforms. He despised representative government, and denounced the notion of an all-Russian parliament. He also condemned Social Darwinism as an erroneous generalisation of Darwin&#x27;s Theory of Evolution.

In the early years of the reign of Alexander II, Pobedonostsev maintained, though keeping aloof from the Slavophiles, that Western institutions were radically bad in themselves and totally inapplicable to Russia, since they had no roots in Russian history and culture and did not correspond to the spirit of Russian people. In that period, he contributed several papers to Alexander Herzen&#x27;s radical periodical &quot;Voices from Russia&quot;.

He denounced democracy as &quot;the insupportable dictatorship of vulgar crowd&quot;. He argued that parliaments, trial by jury, freedom of the press, and secular education were undesirable alien nostrums. He subjected all of them to a severe analysis in his &quot;Reflections of a Russian Statesman&quot;. He once stated that Russia should be &quot;frozen in time&quot;, showing his undivided commitment to autocracy.

To these dangerous products of Western thought he found a counterpoise in popular &quot;vis inertiae&quot;, and in the respect of the masses for institutions developed slowly and automatically during the past centuries of national life. In his view, human society evolves naturally, just like a tree grows. The human mind is not able to perceive the logic of social development. Any attempt at reforming society is an act of violence and a crime. Among the practical deductions drawn from these premises is the necessity of preserving autocratic power, and of fostering among the people the traditional veneration for the ritual of the national Church.

In the sphere of practical politics Pobedonostsev exercised considerable influence in the Russification policy of Alexander III. This found expression in nationalist propaganda.

===Antisemitism===
Pobedonostsev particularly advised the anti-Jewish measures taken during Alexander III&#x27;s administration. These began with the temporary &quot;May Laws&quot; that banned Jews from rural areas and shtetls even within the Pale of Settlement. The May Laws did not lapse; further policies led to deportations of Jews from large cities, enrollment quotas in public education, and a proscription against voting in local elections.

His anti-Jewish measures, at least, may have stemmed from a personal motive. British author Arnold White, interested in Jewish agricultural colonisation in Argentina, visited Pobedonostsev with credentials from Baron de Hirsch; Pobedonostsev said to him: &quot;The characteristics of the Jewish race are parasitic; for their sustenance they require the presence of another race as &quot;host&quot; although they remain aloof and self-contained. Take them from the living organism, put them on a rock, and they die. They cannot cultivate the soil.&quot; He was also by 1894 credited (dubiously) with illustrating the goal of his anti-Jewish measures as making &quot;a third of Jews die out, a third move out, and a third dissolve tracelessly into the surrounding population&quot; (Russian: &quot;Одна треть вымрет, одна выселится, одна треть бесследно растворится в окружающем населении&quot;). He was also a supporter of Baron Maurice de Hirsch&#x27;s efforts for Jewish colonization in Argentina.

===Church policies===
Pobedonostsev was not always a reactionary. He had originally welcomed the Great Reforms that Alexander II undertook in the 1860s-1870s. However, he soon became alarmed by the weakening of the rural estates and the tsarist bureaucracy. He decided that a deeper spiritual unity of the tsar and his people was needed to restore stability to Russia. When Alexander III ascended the throne in 1881, Pobedonostsev rapidly gained a powerful influence over the affairs of both church and state. To establish order he suppressed all reform efforts. The reforms of the 1860s had legalized the role of Protestant and other non-Orthodox religions. Pobedonostsev said Russia needed an Orthodox monopoly. However, he failed to win over the civil authorities, the judicial authorities, and the religious department in his struggle against the non-Orthodox. As a result, his policies, which were intended to unify, actually engendered dissension and violence and in the long run contributed to the collapse of the Russian Empire.

Pobedonostsev did develop a social program for the Church while limiting its autonomy. He imposed repressive measures against the non-Orthodox. He carried out major Church reforms, but they resulted in a church that by 1900 was enmeshed in bureaucracy, alienated in many ways from society, resentful of secular authorities, and divided internally. Stagnation in church and state policies prevailed until Pobedonostsev retired in 1905. In the long run, argues Polunov, Pobedonostsev&#x27;s attempts to impose safe conservative barriers to reform and his hostility toward innovation served only to weaken the autocratic state from within.

<doc id="764628" wikidata="Q578405" url="?curid=764628" title="Maurice Podoloff">
<text>Maurice Podoloff (; August 18, 1890 – November 24, 1985) was an American lawyer and a basketball and ice hockey administrator. He served as the president of the Basketball Association of America (BAA) from 1946 to 1949, and the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1949 to 1963, making Podoloff the &quot;de facto&quot; 1st commissioner in NBA history.

==Biography==
Podoloff was born to a Russian Jewish family in the Russian Empire, on or about August 18, 1890. Doubt remains about birthplace and birthday; some claim he was born in Yelisavetgrad, but he himself said he did not know exactly: &quot;I guess they didn&#x27;t keep records in Russia in those days&quot;, he said. &quot;I was born on either Aug. 18 or Aug. 31, and it was somewhere in Ukraine, possibly near Odessa.&quot; In young boyhood his family immigrated to the United States, where he graduated from Hillhouse High School in New Haven, Connecticut in 1909, and then from Yale University in New Haven with a law degree in 1915.,

In 1926, Podoloff opened the New Haven Arena on Grove Street in downtown New Haven with his father and two brothers. The Arena held over 4,000 people and hosted ice hockey, concerts, and circus events before it was demolished in 1974.

A distinguished lawyer, he was of impeccable character and instrumental in professional basketball&#x27;s development and success. On June 6, 1946, already serving as president of the American Hockey League, he was appointed president of the newly formed Basketball Association of America (BAA), becoming the first person to lead two professional leagues simultaneously.

After BAA teams signed several of the best players in the National Basketball League, Podoloff negotiated a merger with the NBL to form the National Basketball Association, or NBA, in 1949. His great organizational and administrative skills were later regarded as the key factor that kept the league alive in its often stormy formative years.

As president, Podoloff expanded the NBA to as many as 17 teams in three divisions and worked out a 557-game schedule.

He introduced the BAA&#x27;s collegiate draft in 1947, and in 1954 instituted the NBA&#x27;s 24-second shot clock created by Dan Biasone, owner of the Syracuse Nationals, and his executive vice-president, Leo Ferris, which quickened the pace of games and improved NBA basketball from a slow plodding game to a fast-paced sport. That same year, he increased national recognition of the NBA immensely by landing its first television contract.

During his NBA presidency, he meted out lifetime suspensions to 32 players who were involved in a point shaving scandal in 1951. Among these players were Indianapolis Olympians players Ralph Beard and Alex Groza for their actions at University of Kentucky, and 1951&#x27;s number one draft pick Gene Melchiorre, for his actions at Bradley University.

He stepped down as NBA president in 1963 after having greatly increased fan interest during the NBA&#x27;s formative years and having improved the overall welfare of the sport of basketball through his foresight, wisdom, and leadership.

==Legacy==
In his honor, the NBA named its annual league Most Valuable Player trophy the Maurice Podoloff Trophy, which lasted until 2022. Podoloff was subsequently honored with a new trophy dedicated in his name for the team with the best regular season record.

In 1974, Podoloff was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and in 2011 was inducted into the American Hockey League Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1989.

<text>George Poindexter (1779 – September 5, 1853) was an American politician, lawyer, and judge from Mississippi. Born in Virginia, he moved to the Mississippi Territory in 1802. He served as United States Representative from the newly admitted state, was elected as Governor (1820–1822), and served as a United States senator.

==Early life==
Poindexter was born in Louisa County, Virginia in 1779. He was the son of Thomas Poindexter and Lucy (Jones) Poindexter; the Poindexters were a large Virginia family of French Huguenot and English ancestry. Poindexter received a sporadic education, primarily from studying under the tutelage of two of his brothers. He was orphaned after his father died when Poindexter was 17; Poindexter inherited two enslaved people and a share of his father&#x27;s land, residing with an older brother until he came of age. The Poindexter family of Virginia frequently used the names George, Thomas, and John; as a result, their genealogy is difficult to trace. He may have been the uncle of Ohio abolitionist preacher James Preston Poindexter, whose father was Joseph Poindexter, a journalist at the &quot;Richmond Enquirer&quot;.

The exact details of Poindexter&#x27;s legal studies are not known, but according to family tradition, Poindexter studied under practicing attorneys, first in Kentucky, and later in Richmond. He was admitted to the bar in 1800 and began to practice in Milton, an Albemarle County town along the Rivanna River which no longer exists.

==Move to Mississippi==

After moving to the Mississippi Territory in 1802, Poindexter set up his law practice in Natchez. He soon became a friend of Governor William C. C. Claiborne, and a leader in the local Democratic-Republican Party. As a result, in 1803, he was appointed Attorney General of the Territory; he served until 1807, when he took up his duties as a member of the Territorial House of Representatives, to which he had been elected in 1806. (He had been an unsuccessful candidate for the legislature in 1804.)

During Mississippi&#x27;s early years, nearby areas were under Spanish control. When tensions rose over Mississippi&#x27;s expansion, and the Spanish threatened an attack, residents of Adams County formed a militia; Poindexter was one of the main organizers of a company in Natchez, the Mississippi Blues; he was elected commander with the rank of captain. No attack from Spain materialized, and the militia soon disbanded.

When former U.S. Vice President Aaron Burr appeared in Mississippi while traveling south as part of the Burr conspiracy in 1807, acting Governor Cowles Mead declared martial law, appointed Poindexter and William B. Shields as aides-de-camp on his military staff, and sent them to interview Burr and determine his intentions. When Burr was arrested, Poindexter conducted the prosecution until Burr escaped from custody. After Burr escaped, Governor Robert Williams returned from vacation at his home in North Carolina to personally take control of the situation; he criticized Mead and fired the militia officers Mead had appointed, including Poindexter.

==Territorial delegate to Congress==
Poindexter was elected as a delegate to the United States House of Representatives from the Mississippi Territory; he served in the 10th, 11th and 12th Congresses (1807 to 1813). As a delegate, Poindexter concentrated his efforts largely on questions germane to Mississippi, such as federal patronage, as well as advocating for Mississippi&#x27;s admission to the United States. Poindexter also worked to resolve and standardize land titles in Mississippi, where residents possessed deeds and grants from Spain, France, England, and the United States, due to the number of times the area had changed hands. He also opposed those who claimed the Yazoo lands, but in 1810 the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Fletcher v. Peck&quot;, resolved the claims in their favor.

Before leaving for Washington, DC to begin his duties, Mead informed Poindexter of disparaging comments Williams had made to Mead about Poindexter following Burr&#x27;s escape. Poindexter responded by challenging Williams to a duel; Williams replied that he would admit to any comment Mead attributed to him, but that he would not &quot;involve either his public or private character with such a man.&quot; Poindexter responded by writing letters to the editor that made it appear that he had been wronged by Williams and was unable to obtain satisfaction, which had the effect of making Williams appear cowardly in the eyes of his constituents.

Poindexter was in Richmond in October 1807 to testify at Burr&#x27;s treason trial; his testimony suggested that Burr&#x27;s arrest had been based on flimsy evidence, which probably played a part in Burr&#x27;s acquittal.

In 1811, Poindexter&#x27;s outspoken opposition to the Federalist Party resulted in a duel with wealthy merchant and planter Abijah Hunt. Poindexter killed Hunt, but afterward, Poindexter&#x27;s political opponents alleged that he had broken the code duello by firing at Hunt prematurely.

==Judgeship== 
Poindexter did not run for reelection in 1812; after his final term in Congress ended, he was appointed federal Judge for the Mississippi Territory and served from 1813 to 1817. Poindexter also served as a volunteer aide to William Carroll as Carroll commanded a division of Tennessee militia at the War of 1812&#x27;s decisive 1814 Battle of New Orleans.

==Beauty and Booty==
After the Battle of New Orleans, a Poindexter letter dated January 20, 1815, was published in the &quot;Mississippi Republican&quot;, which claimed that Pakenham&#x27;s troops had used &quot;Beauty and Booty&quot; as a watchword. This claim was republished in &quot;Niles&#x27; Weekly Register&quot;, the &quot;National Intelligencer&quot;, and other newspapers. Political opponents and the editor of the &quot;Mississippi Republican&quot; challenged Poindexter&#x27;s account based on Poindexter&#x27;s supposed dereliction of duty on the day of the battle. In March 1815, Poindexter confronted the editor and was subsequently arrested for assault. The &quot;beauty or booty&quot; story had a profound effect on how the war was perceived and became central to contemporary accounts of Jackson&#x27;s victory because it made the British appear to be degenerates bent on rape and plunder, while the Americans were depicted as benevolent and morally superior for the charity and medical aid they rendered to British troops after the fighting.

==House of Representatives==
Poindexter was chair of the committee appointed to draft a constitution for the new state of Mississippi. After its admission in 1817, he was elected to be the state&#x27;s first representative in Congress. He served in the 15th Congress from 1817 to 1819, when he chaired the Committee on Public Lands.

After that, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1820 to the 17th Congress and in 1822 to the 18th Congress.

==Governor of Mississippi==
In 1819 Poindexter was elected the second Governor of Mississippi by a large margin, winning over 60% of the vote in the general election. He served from 1820 to 1822. During his time in office he oversaw a reorganization of the militia, the state created its first free public schools, state courts were reorganized, and Jackson was selected as the site for the state capital.

==United States Senate==
Poindexter was appointed to the United States Senate in 1830 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Robert H. Adams and served from 1830 to 1835. Soon after his appointment, he learned of the financial distress of Martha Jefferson Randolph, whose father Thomas Jefferson had left an estate heavily encumbered by debt. Poindexter introduced a bill to grant Randolph 50,000 acres in Virginia, with the idea she could sell the land to raise money to live on. The bill failed to pass the Senate and was rejected by the two Virginia senators in 1831.

Poindexter served as chairman of the Committee on Private Land Claims in the 22nd Congress from 1831 to 1833, of the Committee on Public Lands in the 23rd Congress from 1833 to 1835 and was President pro tempore of the Senate from June to November 1834.

Poindexter&#x27;s tenure as chair of the Committee on Private Land Claims had been then considered moderately controversial. He had espoused some views that could be regarded as socialist regarding government repossession of land. Poindexter was thought to have made these claims to support President Andrew Jackson&#x27;s fight with the Second Bank of the United States. He was a supporter of President Jackson and had defended him against calls for censure stemming from Jackson&#x27;s 1818 invasion of Florida (including the Arbuthnot and Ambrister incident), but had slowly become less happy with the President&#x27;s policies. Poindexter accused Jackson of relying too heavily on the personal friends who became known as the Kitchen Cabinet as well as favoring personal friends and relations for government jobs.

Poindexter was selected to be President pro temp of the Senate in 1834, but Jacksonians objected with one newspaper bringing up Poindexter&#x27;s alleged drinking problem: &quot;One editor said: &#x27;This man . . . yet rank with the fumes of a low debauch, his step yet tottering, and his eyes rolling with a drunken leer, this man, all filth and vermon [sic], called, probably, from a brothel or a gin cellar, to the Senate Chamber, this man, they chose . . . to preside over the Senate of the United States.&#x27;&quot;

In 1834 Poindexter had his home in Washington, D.C. painted by Richard Lawrence. A deranged man, Lawrence came to believe that he was the ruler of England and the United States and that Jackson was a usurper. In January 1835, Lawrence attempted to shoot at Jackson using two pistols, which misfired. The assassination attempt occurred as Jackson attended a memorial service for a Congressman at the U.S. capitol and the first attempt to assassinate a president. Jackson accused various political enemies of being behind Lawrence&#x27;s actions, including Poindexter, who denied any connection. Poindexter also took issue with Vice President Martin Van Buren&#x27;s support of Jackson during the debate over the Bank and made explicit threats that caused Van Buren to carry pistols for self-defense when presiding over the Senate. The accusations about Lawrence followed Poindexter back to Mississippi, and he was unsuccessful in running for a second term. Poindexter returned to Mississippi, embittered by these issues.

==Retirement from politics==
In 1835, Poindexter moved to Kentucky, where he continued practicing law in Lexington. He later moved back to Jackson, Mississippi and resumed his law practice until his death there on September 5, 1853. He was a gambler and an alcoholic, with alcohol dependence being a significant contributing factor to his death. He was interred in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson.

==Personal==
In 1804 Poindexter married Lydia Carter (1789–1824), the daughter of a prominent Natchez businessman and plantation owner. They had two sons, George Littleton (or Lytleton) and Albert Gallatin. They divorced after Poindexter publicly accused his wife of infidelity and claimed that their second child, whom he disavowed, was the product of an extramarital affair between his wife and their neighbor. In 1820 Lydia Carter Poindexter married Reverend Lewis Williams and moved to Brimfield, Massachusetts. Her sons remained with her; Poindexter provided for the support of George, but disavowed Albert and refused to provide for him.

In 1816 Poindexter married Agatha Ball Chinn (1794–1822). They had one son who died of yellow fever as a child while Poindexter was Governor, and Agatha Poindexter died soon afterward.

He was said to have a serious, potentially non-consensual liaison with an enslaved woman.

When several years before, Representative Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky was criticized for his common-law marriage with Julia Chinn, an enslaved woman; he said, &quot;Unlike Jefferson, Clay, Poindexter and others, I married my wife under the eyes of God, and apparently He has found no objections.&quot;

Historian Burke has written,
During slavery times, there was no particular stigma attached to the fact that many southern plantation owners, along with their white overseers, often fathered mulatto children born of black slave women. As long as the white father denied the facts, the customs that created miscegenation were usually overlooked by Southern society.

Johnson violated the norms by acknowledging Chinn as his wife and their daughters as his, plus trying to introduce his daughters to &quot;polite society&quot;.

Poindexter reportedly had a strong physical resemblance to Henry Clay. He married his third wife, Ann Hewes of Boston, in 1832.

<doc id="764637" wikidata="Q2270272" url="?curid=764637" title="Testament of Job">
<text>The Testament of Job (also referred to as &quot;Divrei Lyov&quot;, literally meaning &quot;Words of Job&quot;) is a book written in the 1st century BC or the 1st century AD (thus part of a tradition often called &quot;intertestamental literature&quot; by Christian scholars). The earliest surviving manuscript is in Coptic, of the 5th century; other early surviving manuscripts are in Greek and Old Slavonic.

==Contents==
In folktale manner in the style of Jewish aggada, it elaborates upon the Book of Job making Job a king in Egypt. Like many other &quot;Testament of ...&quot; works in the Old Testament apocrypha, it gives the narrative a framing-tale of Job&#x27;s last illness, in which he calls together his sons and daughters to give them his final instructions and exhortations. The &quot;Testament of Job&quot; contains all the characters familiar in the &quot;Book of Job&quot;, with a more prominent role for Job&#x27;s wife, given the name &quot;Sitidos&quot;, and many parallels to Christian beliefs that Christian readers find, such as intercession with God and forgiveness. In this text, Job&#x27;s first wife dies and the seven sons and three daughters that he had in the epilogue of the book of Job were from his second wife, whom he married after his trials ended. According to the &quot;Testament of Job&quot;, his second wife is Dinah, the daughter of Jacob. This would mean that not only was Job joined to the house of Israel, but also that Job lived between the death of Abraham and the birth of Moses.

Unlike the Biblical Book of Job, Satan&#x27;s vindictiveness towards Job is described in the Testament as being due to Job destroying a non-Jewish temple. Indeed, Satan is described in a far more villainous light, rather than simply being a &quot;prosecuting counsel&quot;. Job is equally portrayed differently; Satan is shown to directly attack Job, but fails each time due to Job&#x27;s willingness to be patient, unlike the Biblical narrative where Job falls victim but retains faith.

The latter section of the work, dedicated like the Biblical text to Job&#x27;s comforters, deviates even further from the Biblical narrative. Rather than complaining or challenging God, Job consistently asserts his faith despite the laments of his comforters. While one of the comforters gives up, and the others try to get him medical treatment, Job insists his faith is true, and eventually the voice of God tells the comforters to stop their behaviour. When most of the comforters choose to listen to God&#x27;s voice, they decide to taunt the one remaining individual who still laments Job&#x27;s fate.

Unlike many &quot;Testament of ...&quot; works, there is little concentration on ethical discourses, instead the text concentrates on delivering narrative, as well as embedding a noticeably large number of hymns.

One passage concerns &quot;multicoloured cords&quot; for women to put around their breasts to enable them to sing in the &quot;language of the angels&quot;. Some say this is an early example of speaking in tongues.

===Montanists===
The assertion has been made that the &quot;ecstatic speech&quot; of the Montanists (a later Christian sect), was another example of &quot;tongues&quot;. This has led several scholars to suggest that the Montanists may have edited parts of the Testament of Job, adding sections such as these.

The letter ends with a reference to life after death; &quot;It is written that he will rise up with those whom the Lord will reawaken. To our Lord by glory. Amen.&quot;

==Therapeutae==
It has been suggested that the work originated from the Therapeutae. However, speaking in tongues has not been recorded as a practice of the Therapeutae.

==Apocrypha categorisation==
At the end of the 5th century, the &quot;Testament of Job&quot; was relegated to the apocrypha by the Gelasian Decree, concerning canonical and noncanonical books. Subsequently, the &quot;Testament of Job&quot; was ignored by Roman Catholic writers until it was published in 1833 in the series edited by Angelo Mai (&quot;Scriptorum Veterum Nova Collectio&quot; Vol. vii, pp. 180–191). Mai&#x27;s manuscript had a double title: &quot;Testament of Job the Blameless, the Conqueror in Many Contests, the Sainted&quot; (which seems to be the older title) and &quot;The Book of Job Called Jobab, and His Life, and the Transcript of His Testament&quot;.

==Publishing==
A bilingual Greek and English edition, edited by Robert A. Kraft, was issued in New York by the Society of Biblical Literature in 1974 with .

<text>Louis Poinsot (; 3 January 1777 – 5 December 1859) was a French mathematician and physicist. Poinsot was the inventor of geometrical mechanics, showing how a system of forces acting on a rigid body could be resolved into a single force and a couple.

==Life==

:Everyone makes for himself a clear idea of the motion of a point, that is to say, of the motion of a corpuscle which one supposes to be infinitely small, and which one reduces by thought in some way to a mathematical point.
::—Louis Poinsot, &quot;Théorie nouvelle de la rotation des corps&quot; (1834)

Louis was born in Paris on 3 January 1777. He attended the school of Lycée Louis-le-Grand for secondary preparatory education for entrance to the famous École Polytechnique. In October 1794, at age 17, he took the École Polytechnique entrance exam and failed the algebra section but was still accepted. A student there for two years, he left in 1797 to study at École des Ponts et Chaussées to become a civil engineer. Although now on course for the practical and secure professional study of civil engineering, he discovered his true passion, abstract mathematics.

Poinsot thus left the École des Ponts et Chaussées and civil engineering to become a mathematics teacher at the secondary school Lycée Bonaparte in Paris, from 1804 to 1809. From there he became inspector general of the Imperial University of France. He shared the post with another famous mathematician, Delambre. On 1 November 1809, Poinsot became assistant professor of analysis and mechanics at his old school the École Polytechnique. During this period of transitions between schools and work, Poinsot had remained active in research and published a number of works on geometry, mechanics and statics so that by 1809 he had an excellent reputation.

By 1812 Poinsot was no longer directly teaching at École Polytechnique using substitute teacher Reynaud, and later Cauchy, and lost his post in 1816 when they re-organized, but he did become admissions examiner and held that for another 10 years. He also worked at the famous Bureau des Longitudes from 1839 until his death. On the death of Joseph-Louis Lagrange in 1813, Poinsot was elected to fill his place at the Académie des Sciences. In 1840 he became a member of the superior council of public instruction. In 1846 he was awarded an Officer of the Legion of Honor, and on the formation of the Senate in 1852 he was chosen a member of that body. Poinsot was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1858. He died in Paris on 5 December 1859. He is buried in Pere Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

From the diary of Thomas Hirst, 20 December 1857:

:...[Poinsot] shook me kindly by the hand, bid me be seated, and took his seat near me. He is now between 60 and 70 years old, with silver silken hair neatly arranged on a fine intelligent head. He is tall and thin, but although he now stoops with age and feebleness one can see that one time his figure was more than ordinarily graceful. He was loosely but neatly dressed in a large ample robe de chambre. His features are finely moulded — indeed everything about the man betokens good blood. He talks incessantly and well. I did not misunderstand a word, although he spoke always in a low tone, and now and then his voice dropped as if from weariness, but he never wandered from his point...

==Legacy and tributes==
The crater Poinsot on the moon is named after Poinsot. A street in Paris is called Rue Poinsot (14th Arrondissement). Gustave Eiffel included Poinsot among the 72 names of prominent French scientists on plaques around the first stage of the Eiffel Tower.

== Work ==

:&quot;Poinsot was determined to publish only fully developed results and to present them with clarity and elegance. Consequently he left a rather limited body of work ...&quot;
::—Dictionary of Scientific Biography (see Sources)

Works include:

*&quot;Eléments de statique&quot; (1803) (translated as &quot;The Elements of Statics&quot; in 1848 by Thomas Sutton)
*&quot;memoirs that dealt with the composition of moments and the composition of areas&quot; (1806)
*&quot;the general theory of equilibrium and of movements in systems&quot; (1806)
*&quot;polygons and polyhedra&quot; (1809)
*&quot;Theorie nouvelle de la rotation des corps&quot; (1834)
Poinsot was the inventor of geometrical mechanics, which showed how a system of forces acting on a rigid body could be resolved into a single force and a couple. Previous work done on the motion of a rigid body had been purely analytical with no visualization of the motion, and the great value of the work, as Poinsot says, &quot;it enables us to represent to ourselves the motion of a rigid body as clearly that as a moving point&quot; (Encyclopædia Britannica, 1911). In particular, he devised what is now known as Poinsot&#x27;s construction. This construction describes the motion of the angular velocity vector formula_1 of a rigid body with one point fixed (usually its center of mass). He proved that the endpoint of the vector formula_1 moves in a plane perpendicular to the angular momentum (in absolute space) of the rigid body.

He discovered the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra in 1809. Two of these had already appeared in Kepler&#x27;s work of 1619, although Poinsot was unaware of this. The other two are the great icosahedron and great dodecahedron, which some people call these two the &quot;Poinsot solids&quot;. In 1810 Cauchy proved, using Poinsot&#x27;s definition of regular, that the enumeration of regular star polyhedra is complete.

Poinsot worked on number theory studying Diophantine equations. However he is best known for his work in geometry and, together with Monge, regained geometry&#x27;s leading role in mathematical research in France in the 19th century. Poinsot also contributed to the importance of geometry by creating a chair of advanced geometry at the Sorbonne in 1846. Poinsot created the chair for Chasles which he occupied until his death in 1880.

<text>Ernest Leonard Johnson (1891–1977) was a South African astronomer and a former staff member of the Union Observatory in Johannesburg, South Africa. He is known for the discovery of 18 asteroids between 1946–1951, as well as several comets. On 25 August 1949, he discovered 48P/Johnson, a periodic comet expected to pass no closer than 1.2 to 1.3 AU from our planet in 2025. Johnson received the &quot;Donohoe Comet Medal&quot; twice before retiring in 1956. He died in 1977.

== Biography ==
Johnson was the son of William Johnson, a medical practitioner, and Rachel Sarah Joan Sanderson. He matriculated at Grey College, Bloemfontein, South Africa and started working on a mine but when his brother, Cecil Robert Johnson, was killed in a mining accident he applied for a position at the Union Observatory in Johannesburg, South Africa. He started work there as a learner astronomer in 1914.

He served in the armed forces of the Union of South Africa in World War I (1914-1918) during the campaign in German West Africa (now Namibia) but was sent home owing to illness. He recovered and went to England where he served as a bomber pilot for the Royal Flying Corps. After the war he returned to the Union Observatory and remained there for the rest of his career.

Johnson produced star maps of the sky south of 19 degrees south declination, in collaboration with Harry Edwin Wood. In January 1935 he discovered a faint comet, that was visible for less than two months, while searching the sky in declination 52 degrees south. This comet was named &quot;Johnson&#x27;s comet 1935&quot;. He discovered a second comet in 1948.

Between August 1946 and July 1951, Johnson also discovered 18 asteroids, the most important of which was named 1580 Betulia. This asteroid was discovered on 22 May 1950 during its close approach to the earth. From 1921 to 1953, his observations of the asteroids and more than 30 comets were published in the &quot;Circular of the Union Observatory, Johannesburg&quot;.

Johnson was a member of the Astronomical Society of Southern Africa and contributed to the society&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Notes&quot;.

== List of discoveries ==
=== Comets ===
Discoveries of comets include:
* C/1935 A1 on 8 January 1935 (Comet &quot;a&quot; 1935)
* C/1948 R1 on 1 September 1948 (Comet 1948 &quot;j&quot;)
* 48P/Johnson on 25 August 1949
* C/1949 K1 on 20 May 1949 (Comet 1949 &quot;a&quot; and/or 1949 &quot;d&quot;)

=== Asteroids ===
Johnson is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 18 asteroids:. 


== Private life ==
In 1922 Johnson married Aisleen Devenish, with whom he had a daughter and a son. He retired from the observatory in December 1951 but continued to work until 1956, during which time he tested potential astronomical sites with portable reflecting telescopes for the European Southern Observatory Organisation.

<doc id="764646" wikidata="Q2382900" url="?curid=764646" title="DuBose Heyward">
<text>Edwin DuBose Heyward (August 31, 1885 – June 16, 1940) was an American author best known for his 1925 novel &quot;Porgy&quot;. He and his wife Dorothy, a playwright, adapted it as a 1927 play of the same name. The couple worked with composer George Gershwin to adapt the work as the 1935 opera &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;. It was later adapted as a 1959 film of the same name.

Heyward also wrote poetry and other novels and plays, as well as the children&#x27;s book &quot;The Country Bunny and the Little Gold Shoes&quot; (1939).

==Childhood, education, and early career==
Heyward was born in 1885 in Charleston, South Carolina, the son of Jane Screven (DuBose) and Edwin Watkins Heyward. He was a descendant of Judge Thomas Heyward, Jr., a South Carolinian signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, and his wife, who were of the planter elite.

As a child and young man, Heyward was frequently ill. He contracted polio when he was 18. Two years later he contracted typhoid fever, and the following year fell ill with pleurisy. He described himself as having been &quot;a miserable student&quot; who was uninterested in learning. He dropped out of high school in his first year at age fourteen but had a lifelong and serious interest in literature. He was able to support himself as he became a successful insurance agent. While confined to his sickbed, he wrote numerous verses and stories.

In 1913 Heyward wrote a one-act play, &quot;An Artistic Triumph&quot;, which was produced in a local theater. Although described as a derivative work that reportedly showed little promise, Heyward was encouraged enough to pursue a literary career. In 1917, while convalescing, he began to work seriously at fiction and poetry. In 1918 he published his first short story, &quot;The Brute,&quot; in &quot;Pagan, a Magazine for Eudaemonists&quot;.

The next year, he met Hervey Allen, who was teaching at the nearby Porter Military Academy. They became close friends and formed the Poetry Society of South Carolina. It helped spark a revival of southern literature. Heyward edited the society&#x27;s yearbooks until 1924 and contributed much of their content. His poetry was well received, earning him a &quot;Contemporary Verse&quot; award in 1921.

In 1922 he and Allen jointly published a collection, &quot;Carolina Chansons: Legends of the Low Country.&quot; They jointly edited an issue of &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine featuring Southern writers. During this period Heyward and his friend Henry T. O&#x27;Neill together operated a successful insurance and real estate company.

==Marriage and family==
Heyward met his wife Dorothy when they were both at the MacDowell Colony in 1922. After they married, they lived for many years in Charleston. Their only child, Jenifer DuBose Heyward, was born in 1930 in New York City. She became a sculptor, actress and dancer, a member of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. She married Judson Wood Jr., and died in 1984.

==Career as full-time writer==
By 1924, Heyward had achieved a measure of financial independence, allowing him to give up business and devote himself full-time to literature. That year he published his first poetry collection, &quot;Jasbo Brown and Other Poems&quot; (1924). Between stints of writing, he supplemented his income by lecturing on southern literature at colleges and the Porter Military Academy.

===&quot;Porgy&quot;===
In 1925 he published his novel &quot;Porgy&quot;, set in the Black community of Charleston, which had many Gullah people. Given the positive reception for the book, he and Dorothy, a playwright, adapted it as a dramatic play. While working on that adaptation, he was approached by composer George Gershwin, who proposed collaborating on an opera of the material.

His and Dorothy&#x27;s play &quot;Porgy&quot; opened on Broadway in 1927, and it was a considerable success, running for 367 performances.

Describing Heyward&#x27;s achievement in &quot;Porgy&quot;, the African-American poet and playwright Langston Hughes said Heyward was one who saw &quot;with his white eyes, wonderful, poetic qualities in the inhabitants of Catfish Row that makes them come alive.&quot; Heyward&#x27;s biographer James M. Hutchisson characterized &quot;Porgy&quot; as &quot;the first major southern novel to portray Blacks without condescension&quot; and said that the libretto to &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; was largely Heyward&#x27;s work. Critics have described Heyward as sympathetic in his portrayal of the Southern Blacks in his work.

Others, however, have noted that the characters in &quot;Porgy&quot;, though viewed sympathetically, are described in stereotypical ways. According to Ellen Noonan,

===&quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;===
For the opera &quot;Porgy and Bess,&quot; both Heyward and Ira Gershwin, the composer&#x27;s brother and regular partner, worked on the lyrics. Heyward did not get much credit for that work. In his introduction to the section on DuBose Heyward in &quot;Invisible Giants: Fifty Americans Who Shaped the Nation But Missed the History Books&quot; (2003), Stephen Sondheim wrote:

DuBose Heyward has gone largely unrecognized as the author of the finest set of lyrics in the history of the American musical theater – namely, those of &#x27;Porgy and Bess&#x27;. There are two reasons for this, and they are connected. First, he was primarily a poet and novelist, and his only song lyrics were those that he wrote for Porgy. Second, some of them were written in collaboration with Ira Gershwin, a full-time lyricist, whose reputation in the musical theater was firmly established before the opera was written. But most of the lyrics in Porgy – and all of the distinguished ones – are by Heyward. I admire his theater songs for their deeply felt poetic style and their insight into character. It&#x27;s a pity he didn&#x27;t write any others. His work is sung, but he is unsung.

The Gershwin opera &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; was produced in 1935, featuring top African-American singers and chorus. Large sections of dialogue from the play were set to music for the recitatives in the opera. Although it had limited success when first produced, it has since had numerous successful revivals, toured Europe, North America, and other continents, and been recognized as an American operatic masterpiece.

===Later works===
Heyward continued to explore Black Charleston with another novel set in Catfish Row, &quot;Mamba&#x27;s Daughters&quot; (1929). He and Dorothy also adapted this as a play.

Heyward wrote the play &quot;Brass Ankle&quot;, produced in 1931 in New York. The title refers to a Southern term for a person of mixed-race ancestry, and was long used in a pejorative way. The play addressed issues of mixed-race, featuring a couple in a small southern town who have grown up believing they were white and learning about some African-American ancestry. Reviewers treated his play favorably as a version of the &quot;tragic mulatto&quot; genre, but it was not a commercial success.

He wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s play &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot; (1933). Heyward wrote a children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Country Bunny and the Little Gold Shoes&quot; (1939), which was quite popular.

His novella &quot;Star Spangled Virgin&quot; (1939) was set in Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. It deals with the domestic life of Adam Work and his woman Rhoda. It was described as &quot;singularly charming and very original&quot;, covering their and friends&#x27; interpretations of &quot;the relations of men and women&quot;.

Heyward died from a heart attack in June 1940, at the age of 54, in Tryon, North Carolina.

<text>John Charles Polanyi (; born 23 January 1929) is a German-born Canadian chemist. He was awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research in chemical kinetics. 

Polanyi was born into the prominent Hungarian Polányi (Pollacsek) family in Berlin, Germany, prior to emigrating in 1933 to the United Kingdom where he was subsequently educated at the University of Manchester, and did postdoctoral research at the National Research Council in Canada and Princeton University in New Jersey. Polanyi&#x27;s first academic appointment was at the University of Toronto, and he remains there . 

In addition to the Nobel Prize, Polanyi has received numerous other awards, including 33 honorary degrees, the Wolf Prize in Chemistry and the Gerhard Herzberg Canada Gold Medal for Science and Engineering. Outside his scientific pursuits, Polanyi is active in public policy discussion, especially concerning science and nuclear weapons. His father, Mihály (Michael), was a noted chemist and philosopher. His uncle, Károly (Karl) was a renowned political economist, best known for his seminal work, &quot;The Great Transformation&quot;. According to György Marx, he was one of &quot;The Martians&quot;, a group of prominent Hungarian scientists who emigrated to the United States in the first half of the 20th century.

==Early years==
Polanyi&#x27;s father Michael was born Jewish and converted to Catholicism. Polanyi&#x27;s family moved from Germany to Britain in 1933, partly as a result of the persecution of Jews under Adolf Hitler. During World War II, Polanyi&#x27;s father sent him to Canada for three years when he was 11, so he would be safe from German bombings. While living in Toronto, he attended the University of Toronto Schools. After returning to Britain, Polanyi finished high school and attended university at Manchester, where he received his undergraduate degree in 1949 and his PhD in 1952. Although his university education was focused in science, he was not convinced it was his calling after finishing high school, when he briefly considered a career as a poet. His father, Michael Polanyi, was a professor in the chemistry department during his first year of university, before transferring to a newly created position in the social studies department. Polanyi&#x27;s supervisor during his graduate studies was Ernest Warhurst, a former student of his father&#x27;s. After completing his PhD studies, Polanyi did postdoctoral research at the National Research Council in Ottawa, Ontario from 1952 until 1954, where he worked with Edgar William Richard Steacie. From 1954 until 1956, he was a research associate at Princeton University.

==Academic posts==
John Polanyi started at the University of Toronto as a lecturer in 1956. He moved up the ranks quickly at the university, being promoted to assistant professor in 1957, associate professor in 1960 and becoming a full professor in 1962. In 1975, he was named University Professor, an honorary title he has retained since.

==Research interests==
Polanyi&#x27;s PhD studies at Manchester University focused on measuring the strengths of chemical bonds using thermal dissociation, building on Warhurst&#x27;s graduate studies using a sodium flame apparatus to determine the likelihood that a collision between a sodium atom and another molecule would lead to a chemical reaction. For the majority of his career, Polanyi&#x27;s research has focused on chemical dynamics, attempting to determine the mechanics of a chemical reaction, and the properties of chemical species in the transition state. While at the National Research Council (NRC), Polanyi evaluated transition state theory for its predictive powers, coming to the conclusion that the theory was flawed, largely due to a lack of knowledge about the forces at play in the transition state. Near the end of his stay at NRC, Polanyi worked in Gerhard Herzberg&#x27;s lab, using spectroscopy to examine vibrational and rotational excitation in iodine molecules. During Polanyi&#x27;s time at Princeton University, he worked with Sir Hugh Taylor and his colleagues, Michael Boudart and David Garvin. He was influenced by studies conducted at Princeton looking at the vibrationally excited reaction products between atomic hydrogen and ozone.

When Polanyi moved to the University of Toronto, his first graduate students were looking for enhanced reaction rates with vibrationally excited hydrogen, as well as looking for the presence of vibrationally excited hydrogen chloride during the exothermic reaction of molecular chlorine with atomic hydrogen. Graduate student Kenneth Cashion was working with Polanyi when they made their first discoveries about chemiluminescence, the light emitted by an atom molecule when it is in an excited state. This work was first published in 1958.

In 2009, Polanyi and his colleagues published a paper in &quot;Nature Chemistry&quot;, entitled &quot;Molecular dynamics in surface reactions.&quot; This more recent research could be influential in nanotechnology, building devices from single atoms and molecules. Polanyi&#x27;s work still focuses on the basic workings of chemical reactions, but since his Nobel Prize win in 1986, his methods have changed. While in Sweden for the award ceremony, he encountered the three scientists who were awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in Physics, who were honoured for their work in electron optics and scanning tunneling microscopy. This technology allowed Polanyi and his colleagues to monitor chemical reactions on a very small scale, rather than observing the energy being released using infrared technology. His lab at the University of Toronto currently has 4 scanning tunneling microscopes, valued at approximately $750,000 each.

In addition to his scientific pursuits, Polanyi has also always been keenly aware of the world at large. As a student, he edited a newspaper and displayed an interest in politics. Although his father was a scientist, he did not demonstrate an immediate affinity for chemistry. Beginning in the 1950s, Polanyi became involved in public affairs, especially concerning nuclear weapons. He founded Canada&#x27;s Pugwash group in 1960, and served as the chairman for the group from its inception until 1978. Pugwash is a global movement that received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995. Their goal is to reduce armed conflict and seek solutions to global problems. He has also been a supporter of &quot;pure&quot; science, and a critic of government policies that do not support such research. He is also a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system. Polanyi often accepts speaking engagements to discuss issues relating to social justice, peace and nuclear proliferation, despite his busy research schedule. He frequently comments on science and public policy issues via the &quot;Letters to the Editor&quot; and &quot;Opinion&quot; sections of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; newspaper. He currently serves on the National Advisory Board of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, the research arm of Council for a Livable World.

==Awards and honours==

===Nobel Prize===
Polanyi was awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in chemical kinetics. He shared the prize with Dudley Herschbach of Harvard University and Yuan T. Lee of the University of California. The trio were honoured for &quot;their contributions concerning the dynamics of chemical elementary processes.&quot; Polanyi&#x27;s contributions were centred around the work he did developing the technique of infrared chemiluminescence. This technique was used to measure weak infrared emissions from a newly formed molecule in order to examine energy disposal during a chemical reaction. Polanyi&#x27;s Nobel lecture upon receipt of the award was entitled &quot;Some Concepts in Reaction Dynamics.&quot;

Polanyi had mixed feelings about the impact of the Nobel Prize on his research, feeling that his name on research proposals and papers often brought additional scrutiny, and also had people questioning his dedication to science after the honour. Polanyi said, &quot;There is a very reasonable suspicion that you are so busy doing the things that Nobel Prize winners do that you are actually only giving half your mind to science.&quot;

His Nobel victory also signaled a change in his research direction. The 1986 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Ernst Ruska, Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer for their work in electron microscopes and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). This research piqued Polanyi&#x27;s interest while he was in Sweden for the ceremony. After returning to Toronto, Polanyi and his colleagues looked into the technique and now have four STMs, which they use to picture chemical reactions at the molecular level, rather than using infrared detection and chemiluminescence.

Polanyi&#x27;s Nobel medal is on display at Massey College (University of Toronto) where he is also a Senior Fellow.

===Additional awards===
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1971. In 1974, Polanyi was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 1979, he was promoted to Companion. He has received many other awards throughout his career, including the Marlow Medal of the Faraday Society in 1962, Centenary Medal of the British Chemical Society in 1965, the Steacie Prize for Natural Sciences in 1965 (shared), the Noranda Award of the Chemical Institute of Canada in 1967, the Henry Marshall Tory Medal of the Royal Society of Canada in 1977, the Wolf Prize in Chemistry in 1982 (shared), the Izaak Walton Killam Memorial Prize in 1988, the Royal Medal of the Royal Society in 1989, and the John C. Polanyi Lecture Award of the Canadian Society for Chemistry in 1992. In 2007, Polanyi was awarded the Gerhard Herzberg Canada Gold Medal for Science and Engineering. The Royal Society of Chemistry honoured Polanyi as their 2010 Faraday Lectureship Prize.

Polanyi has received many honorary degrees from 25 institutions, including Waterloo in 1970, Harvard University in 1982, Ottawa in 1987, and Queen&#x27;s in 1992. He is a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, the Royal Society of London, the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry of the United Kingdom and the Chemical Institute of Canada.

Polanyi was pictured on a Canada Post first class postage stamp on 3 October 2011, issued to salute the International Year of Chemistry. In 1992, Polanyi was appointed to the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council of Canada.

Polanyi was awarded the 2022 Andrei Sakharov Prize. The award cites Polanyi&#x27;s seven decades of activism for a nuclear-weapons-free world, for upholding human rights and freedom of speech globally, for public education on the essential role of science in society, and for a visionary approach to bringing about a hopeful, peaceful future.

===Legacy===
In honour of Polanyi&#x27;s Nobel Prize win, the Ontario government established the &quot;John Charles Polanyi Prizes&quot;. These prizes are each worth $20,000, and are awarded to young researchers in the province in a postdoctoral fellowship or who have recently started a faculty appointment at an Ontario university. The prizes are awarded in similar categories to the Nobel Prizes, broadly defined as: Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Economics and Literature.

Canada&#x27;s Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) created the John C. Polanyi award to recognize a researcher or researchers whose work in an NSERC-supported field has led to an outstanding advance in the field. The research must have been conducted in Canada, and have been at least partially supported by NSERC funding. The award consists partially of a $250,000 grant for the winner. The inaugural winner of the John C. Polanyi Award was the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory. In 2011, the award was presented to Victoria M. Kaspi, an astrophysicist at McGill University.

Polanyi started publishing his scientific research in 1953. As of 2010, he has published over 250 scientific papers. His writing is not limited to his scientific interests, as he has published over 100 articles on policy, the impact of science on society and armament control. In 1970, he produced a film entitled &quot;Concepts in Reaction Dynamics&quot;, and he co-edited a book called &quot;The Dangers of Nuclear War&quot;.

In 2010, the Toronto District School Board voted to change the name of Sir Sandford Fleming Academy to the John Polanyi Collegiate Institute to coincide with a move to a new location. The new school opened in September 2011.

==Personal life==
Polanyi was born in 1929 to Michael and Magda Elizabeth Kemény Polanyi in Berlin, Germany. His father was born in 1891, in Hungary. His uncle, Karl was an economist, noted for his criticism of market capitalism. His brother George was noted for his defence of market capitalism. His paternal grandfather, Mihaly Pollacsek, built railways. Mihaly Pollacsek Magyarised the family&#x27;s name to Polanyi, but did not change his own name. The Polanyi&#x27;s were non-observant Jews, although Michael Polanyi became a Christian. 

In 1958, Polanyi married Anne Ferrar Davidson (1929–2013). He has two children – a daughter, Margaret, born in 1961 and a son, Michael, born in 1963. His daughter is a journalist, and his son is a political scientist who started his career as a physicist. Polanyi is currently married to portrait artist Brenda Bury. Outside his scientific and policy endeavours, Polanyi&#x27;s interests include art, literature and poetry. He was an avid white water canoeist in his younger days, but has replaced that with walking and skiing.

<doc id="764659" wikidata="Q168287" url="?curid=764659" title="Christian Panucci">
<text>Christian Panucci (; born 12 April 1973) is an Italian former footballer and manager. In his playing career he played as a defender. A versatile footballer, he began his career as a right-back, but was also capable of playing on the left; as he lost his pace in his later career, he was usually deployed as a centre back, due to his strength in the air.

Panucci began his playing career with Italian club Genoa in 1990, and moved to AC Milan in 1993, where he won several titles, including two Serie A titles and the UEFA Champions League in 1994, appearing in the final 4–0 victory over Barcelona as a left-back. Although he initially served as a back-up to the starting defensive line-up of Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi, Alessandro Costacurta, and Mauro Tassotti, which is regarded as one of the greatest defences of all time, his precocious performances enabled him to break into the starting line-up, and earned him the Bravo Award in 1994. In 1996, he followed his former Milan coach Fabio Capello to Real Madrid, and was a starting right-back for the Spanish side, winning a La Liga title in 1997, and his second UEFA Champions League in 1998. He returned to Italy to join Inter Milan in 1999, but with less success, and was subsequently sent on loan to Premier League side Chelsea the following season, before joining French side Monaco. He transferred to Roma in 2001, where he was once again reunited with manager Capello, and remained at the club until 2009. His leadership and experience saw him play a key role for the club in his centre-back role, as he won two consecutive Coppa Italia titles in 2007 and 2008, as well as the Supercoppa Italiana. He retired in 2010, after a season with Parma.

After a successful international career at youth level, which saw him win consecutive under-21 European Championships, Panucci was a member of the Italian senior national team at the 1996 Olympics, 2002 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2004, and UEFA Euro 2008, playing 57 matches with Italy in total between 1994 and 2008, scoring 4 goals.

Following his retirement, in 2012 Panucci took up a position as an assistant manager to Fabio Capello with the Russia national football team. In 2015, he was appointed as head coach of Livorno, before joining Ternana in 2016. Amongst his greatest achievements in management so far is the accolade, in 2014, of the Italian udette &#x27;del a sorta&#x27;, Seria B&#x27;s equivalent of the best newbie manager award. In July 2017, he was appointed as Albania national team coach.

==Club career==

===Genoa===
After playing for the Veloce Calcio di Savona youth side, Panucci started his professional career with Genoa in 1990, and made his Serie A debut with the club during the 1991–92 Serie A season; following his impressive performances during the 1992–93 season, which saw him score 3 goals in 30 appearances.

===Milan===
Panucci moved to AC Milan in July 1993, at the age of 20. A talented prospect, he was originally brought in as a younger, more attack-minded alternative to the incumbent right-back Mauro Tassotti, who had held the position for over a decade, and was expected to be a back-up. However, Panucci began to work his way into the starting lineup under manager Fabio Capello, appearing in 19 league matches and scoring twice as Milan won domestic and European titles. He also demonstrated his versatility by lining up at left-back in the 1994 UEFA Champions League final, while Tassotti played on the right, and Paolo Maldini and Filippo Galli in the centre, filling in for the injured Franco Baresi and the suspended Alessandro Costacurta, who were normally the club&#x27;s starting central defensive pair; despite several important absences, Milan defeated Barcelona 4–0 to win the title. Nonetheless, it was Tassotti, not Panucci, who traveled to the United States that summer as part of the Italian World Cup selection under Arrigo Sacchi. For his performances, Panucci won the Bravo Award, as the best Under-23 player in Europe.

In the following season, Panucci established himself as the club&#x27;s first-choice right-back, starting 28 of 34 matches in Serie A, and fully broke into the senior national team. Milan started the season strongly, winning both the Supercoppa Italiana and the UEFA Super Cup, but finished fourth in the league, behind champions Juventus, while they lost out to Vélez Sársfield in the 1994 Intercontinental Cup final, and to Ajax in the Champions League final that season. Panucci had one of his best offensive seasons in 1995–96, scoring five goals, while helping to form the league&#x27;s tightest defence, and one of the greatest of all time, alongside internationals Baresi, Maldini, and Costacurta, as Milan regained the Italian championship. The sweeping changes across Europe as a result of the Bosman ruling, however, opened up new opportunities. After winning six titles with AC Milan, midway through the 1996–97 season, Panucci left the club for Real Madrid, joining former AC Milan coach Fabio Capello at the Spanish giants.

===Real Madrid===
At Real Madrid, Panucci became the first Italian to play for the Spanish club. Arriving in winter, he soon unseated the previous right-back, Carlos Secretario with his excellent performances, and formed a highly aggressive fullback pairing, starting alongside Brazilian star Roberto Carlos, who played on the left. This was a strong period for Real Madrid on the field, as the club immediately won the league in 1997, but a chaotic one on the sidelines as managers Capello, Jupp Heynckes, Guus Hiddink, and John Toshack followed one another in rapid succession. The high point for Panucci at this stage of his career came in 1998, when he won his second Champions League title against Juventus. Once more, however, he was not selected for the national team, missing out on the World Cup under manager Cesare Maldini. After a disappointing 1998–99 season in which Real Madrid only managed to capture the Intercontinental Cup, losing out in the UEFA Super Cup, and finishing well behind rivals Barcelona in La Liga, Panucci elected to return to Italian football.

===Inter Milan===
Panucci later transferred to Inter in 1999, and represented the club during the 1999–2000 season. Panucci was not able to re-capture his previous form during his time with Inter, and frequently clashed with manager Marcello Lippi, later struggling to gain playing time while the team endured a difficult season. Inter finished the season with a fourth-place league finish, also reaching the Coppa Italia final.

====Chelsea (loan)====
In August 2000, he was sent on loan to Chelsea, where he scored once in the UEFA Cup against St. Gallen, but only made 8 appearances in the Premier League, failing to find the back of the net.

====Monaco (loan)====
He subsequently moved to French side Monaco for the second half of the season, making nine league appearances and scoring three goals. He made five league appearances for the club the following season, before returning to Italy to play for Roma in 2001.

===Roma===

After a great deal of travelling throughout his career, Panucci finally settled at Roma. He joined the Roman club in the 2001–02 campaign, the year after the &quot;Giallorossi&quot; had won the national title, and immediately won the 2001 Supercoppa Italiana. He went on to become a key player and one of the leaders of the club, and was the team&#x27;s permanent starting right-back. In July 2002, he was signed permanently for €9.81 million.

Panucci, a reliable leader both on and off the field, often took the responsibility to speak for the team in moments of difficulty, as seen after Roma&#x27;s shock elimination from the Champions League in 2007. He proved to be a decisive player for the club during the 2006–07 season, scoring several goals, and contributed to Roma&#x27;s Coppa Italia victory with his performances, scoring a brace in a 6–2 win in the first leg of the final against Inter. Panucci started the 2007–08 season strongly, immediately winning the 2007 Supercoppa Italiana over Inter, although he later lost his place as the club&#x27;s starting right-back to Cicinho, and was played mainly as a back-up central defender. He was later able to fight his way back into the starting line-up for the second half of the season, scoring several goals (five in Serie A, and one in the UEFA Champions League), as Roma finished second in the league, and defended their Coppa Italia title.

His prolific offensive performances continued through to the opening of the 2008–09 season, despite the club&#x27;s poor run of form, as he scored 2 goals in the league against Reggina and Atalanta, and 2 more in the UEFA Champions League, against Cluj and Chelsea. On 25 January 2009, Panucci was dropped from Roma&#x27;s first team squad after refusing to sit on the bench for a league match against Napoli, and was later also excluded from the Champions League squad list. Due to his difficult relationship with manager Luciano Spalletti, he announced his intention to leave Roma, but no serious bidder was found in the January transfer window and he ultimately stayed, returning to the first team on 28 February after he officially apologised to his fellow players and the club management. He was sent off in the second Derby della Capitale of the 2008–09 season after a heated on-pitch clash with Lazio player Stephan Lichtsteiner following his hard challenge on the Swiss defender. His contract with Roma ended on 30 June 2009, which he had signed in October 2005, making him a free agent.

He played a total of 311 matches, scoring 29 goals for Roma, becoming the highest-scoring defender in the club&#x27;s history.

===Parma===

On 30 July 2009, Panucci signed for Parma on a one-year deal; he made his debut with the club on 23 August, away at Udinese in the first match of the season, and scored his first goal for Parma on 13 December against Bologna. On 23 February 2010, Panucci left Parma by mutual consent seven months after joining them.

On 22 August, Panucci announced his immediate retirement from football, stating: &quot;I had offers, but I just don&#x27;t feel the hunger anymore.&quot;

==International career==
Panucci had a successful career with the Italy national under-21 football team, winning consecutive under-21 European Championship titles in 1994 and 1996 under manager Cesare Maldini; in the final of the latter edition of the tournament against Spain, following a 1–1 draw, he took and missed Italy&#x27;s first penalty in an eventual 4–2 shoot-out victory.

After missing out on the Italy squad that reached the final of the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Panucci made his senior Italy debut on 7 September 1994 against Slovenia in a UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying match. He missed out on the squad for the final tournament, however, following a dispute with Italy national coach Arrigo Sacchi. Despite missing out on the European Championship squad, he was named the captain of the Italy national team that took part at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, under his former youth coach Maldini. As he spent the following seasons abroad, however, he was once again excluded from Maldini&#x27;s team for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and he was also left out of Dino Zoff&#x27;s squad for UEFA Euro 2000 due to his lack of playing and irregular performances with Inter; it was not until the 2002 World Cup, under manager Giovanni Trapattoni, that Panucci became a regular in the Italian team.

In the 2002 World Cup, Panucci was widely blamed for failing to clear a pass that led to the equalising goal for co-hosts South Korea by Seol Ki-hyeon in the dying minutes of regulation time in the round of 16; Ahn Jung-hwan scored the golden goal of the match in extra time, which eliminated the Italian team from the tournament. In the first half of regulation time, Panucci had also conceded a controversial penalty, after referee Byron Moreno judged him to have pulled down Seol Ki-Hyeon in the box; Ahn&#x27;s spot kick was saved by Italy&#x27;s goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, however.

After taking part in Italy&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign at Euro 2004 in Portugal, assisting Antonio Cassano&#x27;s goal in a 1–1 draw against Sweden in Italy&#x27;s second group match of the tournament, Panucci did not play for Italy for over three years. Despite his performances and the lack of genuine quality Italian right-backs, he was ignored by manager Marcello Lippi, with whom he had fallen out in his days at Inter Milan, during the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign, as Italy went on to win the final tournament in Germany. The 34-year-old, however, was given a second chance by coach Roberto Donadoni, who called him up for the Euro 2008 qualifiers against Georgia, Scotland, and the Faroe Islands.

Panucci expressed his delight at earning his 50th Italy cap in the stadium where he began his career for the &quot;Azzurri&quot; in the 2–0 win over Georgia in their Euro 2008 qualifying tie in Genoa at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris.
It was really emotional for me to play in an arena where I grew up. It may have seemed a little scripted but I&#x27;ll never forget the standing ovation I received.

On 17 November 2007, Panucci managed to score his first international goal for Italy since April 2002, when he headed a crucial injury-time winning goal against Scotland in their Euro 2008 qualifying Group B match. Italy then managed to clinch their place at the European Championship finals.

On 13 June 2008, in Italy&#x27;s second group match at Euro 2008, Panucci scored Italy&#x27;s first goal of the tournament in a 1–1 draw against Romania, and became the oldest player to score in outfield play in the competition, and Italy&#x27;s all-time oldest goalscorer, at the age of 35 years, 2 months and 1 day at the time; the latter record was later broken by Fabio Quagliarella in 2019. He later also conceded a penalty, which was saved by Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. Panucci finished his Italy career with 57 total caps, scoring four goals.

==Style of play==
Panucci was a quick, strong, competitive, and versatile player, who was primarily deployed as a right-back, but was also capable of playing on the left or in the centre, or also as a wing-back. Although he was at times criticised for being overly temperamental or for suffering occasional lapses in concentration, he made a name for himself throughout his career as a composed, defensive-minded full-back, who was known for his work-rate, defensive consistency, and for being comfortable in possession; he also possessed significant stamina, as well as notable physical and athletic attributes. He was primarily renowned for his ability in the air as a footballer, frequently scoring with his head from set pieces; his aerial prowess, along with his accurate distribution, precise crossing, good technical skills, and ability to make attacking runs down the flank, also allowed him to contribute offensively to his team&#x27;s play, with goals and assists; with 34 goals in Serie A, he is among the most prolific defenders in the history of the Italian league. In his later career, as he lost his pace, he mainly played as a central defender, where he stood out for his leadership, tenacity, and tactical intelligence, earning the nickname &quot;El Grinta&quot; from commentator Carlo Zampa.

==Post-playing career==
After his retirement, Panucci became a football pundit and color commentator for SKY Italia.

In 2011, he took part in the Italian edition of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;.

==Managerial career==

Panucci left his job as a pundit on 19 March 2012 to accept an offer from Maurizio Zamparini as team manager of Palermo, working alongside director of football and scouting chief Luca Cattani. On 24 April 2012, he resigned from his position just over a month after he took the job.

On 23 July 2012, he was invited by Fabio Capello to work as his assistant in his work as a head coach of Russia national football team. He left his position after the end of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

In 2013, he qualified for the UEFA Pro Licence.

On 18 March 2015, he was named as manager of Serie B team Livorno, replacing Ezio Gelain.

In June 2016, he was appointed as head coach of Ternana signing a one-year contract.

===Albania national team===
On 19 July 2017, Panucci was appointed as the Albania national football team head coach signing a two years and four month contract with the Albanian Football Association, replaced fellow Italian coach Gianni De Biasi, who resigned in previous month. He started his work immediately traveling to Basel, Switzerland in July 2017 to watch Taulant Xhaka playing for Basel. However, Xhaka was an unused substitute in the game and later was forced by Basel&#x27;s coach along with all fellow unused substitutes in that game to train on the pitch post-match. After being in the stadium for the game among his assistant Ervin Bulku, Panucci waited outside to meet Xhaka but unfortunately this meeting did not happen as Xhaka, being unsatisfied with Basel&#x27;s coach decision, went home immediately and did not notice Panucci&#x27;s SMS. Panucci then travelled to Zürich to see fellow Albanian midfielder Burim Kukeli who played with Zürich. In his first gathering with Albania national team for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification matches against Liechtenstein and Macedonia on 2 and 5 September 2017, Panucci brought 3 new players, Iván Balliu, the Spanish-born Albanian descent which previously played for Spain under-17 side, Valon Ahmedi and Hysen Memolla, both former Albanian under-21 internationals. In his first match in charge on 2 September against Liechtenstein, he led Albania to a 2–0 victory at the Elbasan Arena After a 2–0 home loss against Turkey in the first UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying match on 22 March 2019, Panucci was sacked the following day; during his tenure as head coach for Albania he only achieved four wins and two draws in 15 matches.

==Personal life==
Panucci is half Italian and half Czech, the son of Vittorio, an Italian postman, and Hana, a Czech woman; they first met in Prague while he was there as part of a football team representing the Poste Italiane. His brother Patrick (born 1970) is also a former footballer whose career was spent almost entirely in the amateur divisions of Italy before becoming a scout.

Panucci narrowly escaped death in 1996. He had been chosen as captain of the Italy national team at the 1996 Olympics, but was subsequently injured. Planning to return to Italy, he booked a flight on 17 July from New York to Rome — TWA Flight 800. When his baggage from his connecting flight to New York was delayed, he rebooked to a later flight to Milan. The earlier TWA flight exploded over the Atlantic shortly after takeoff, killing all 230 tripulants.

<doc id="764663" wikidata="Q394987" url="?curid=764663" title="Spoon lure">
<text>In sport fishing, a spoon lure is a fishing lure usually made of lustrous metal and with an oblong, usually concave shape like the bowl of a spoon. The spoon lure is mainly used to attract predatory fish by specular reflection of light, as well as the turbulences it creates when moving in water.

The design of the spoon lure is simple: the oblong, concave blade shape of the spoon will cause it to wabble randomly when towed or sinking through water, creating sparkles of light reflection that resemble those of a swimming bait fish&#x27;s scales when looking from afar. The spoon wabbling also stirs up turbulences that can entice the fish to stalk and strike it. Fish normally use their lateral line system to follow the vortices produced by fleeing prey, and the oscillating movements of the spoon lure can imitate these. Different color variations and materials can be added to the classic spoon lure may also help catch fish. Silver- or gold-plated or dyed finishes can give the lure a more vibrant or brilliant appearance. Most spoon lures have at least one hook at the end, which tethers the fish&#x27;s mouth when the fish swallows the spoon.

While the basic principle of design has stayed the same over the years, application and use have changed somewhat. In its beginning, the spoon was used simply to cast and retrieve. However, as trolling motors have become popular on most fishing boats, a new version of the classic was invented. This new breed of lure was nothing more than a duplicate of the traditional casting spoon, but made with thinner material. Using a trolling motor, fishermen could cover a wider expanse of water, increasing the chances for a successful day. Using split shots or other forms of weights, fishermen could easily zero into their fishing lures&#x27; depth while running at the proper speed. Armed with the ability to cover more area, average fishermen could take their spoon lures to any body of water, without full knowledge of the underwater geography that is key to catching some species of fish. The regular casting spoon (heavier version) is used primarily by fishermen who already know the water and what lies beneath. The angler, anchoring the boat 10 to 20 feet behind the area where the fish are believed to be, can cast the spoon beyond this point and retrieve through the given strike zone.

<text>Cahercommaun (), sometimes Cahercommane is a triple stone ringfort on the south-east edge of the Burren area, in Kilnaboy, near the rural village of Carran, in County Clare, Ireland. It was built in the 9th century.

==Features==

Cahercommaun sits on the edge of an inland cliff facing north overlooking a wooded valley, with three concentric walls reaching to the cliff edge. The inner wall alone used 16,500 tons of stone. The outer wall measures some 350 ft east-west by 245 ft north-south. The inner wall is about 5 ft thick and 4 ft high and rises 12 to 14 feet above the cliff. The innermost wall, which is the thickest, forms an almost complete circle, but the two outer walls (connected with each other by subsidiary walls, like a fan) only form a semicircle. The innermost wall contains three chambers within the wall.

==Excavations==
In a six-week period in 1934 it was excavated by the Third Harvard Archaeological Expedition, led by Hugh O&#x27;Neill Hencken, which found that the roughly circular enclosure contained at least twelve stone buildings at various times, some of which had souterrains. The archaeologists concluded that Cahercommaun would have been home to a group of at least 40 people, and among the artefacts discovered were wooden spindles used in weaving. A silver brooch found in one of the souterrains indicates that the site was already in existence by the 9th century AD. The brooch, similar in design to the Tara brooch, is in the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin. In addition to the brooch, a padlock was found.

Some of the conclusions drawn from the work of the Harvard expedition, especially on the period in which the fort was inhabited, have since been revised in light of new information, but the 1934 excavation provided a valuable starting point and basis for further work.

The excavation uncovered one of the most important Iron Age collections found in Ireland. From the collection, a set of sheep shears and a saddle quern are on loan to the Clare Museum from the Irish Antiquities Division of the National Museum of Ireland. Evidence was found of settlement dating back to the 5th century and 6th century, although the fort was built during the 9th century. The saddle quern dates from the Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age period.

== Chiefdom of Tulach Commáin ==

Archaeologists today think that the fort served as the central settlement of the &quot;Chiefdom of Tulach Commáin &quot;The Mound of Commán&quot; a once locally revered chief, anglicised to Commane&quot; &quot; (possibly) of the kingdom of Cashel which controlled or heavily influenced large parts of the Burren in the 9th century. The site was clearly occupied before that period - as was most of the surrounding countryside, which shows numerous signs of habitation since prehistoric times. Whether the exact spot on which the fort now stands was in use earlier is impossible to verify. However, the 5th/6th century artefacts found indicate the presence in that period of at least a small group of people. Hencken thought this number to have reached around 40 to 50 at its peak. There are no signs of occupation past the 10th century.

Although Hencken assumed two phases of occupation, today three phases are distinguished. Phase A covers the period from the 5th/6th to the 8th century. These settlers likely occupied a small enclosure surrounding several small structures near the cliff wall, at the northern end of the current inner wall. No clear evidence of this enclosure has been found, however, as it may have been demolished or incorporated into later structures. The only findings attributed to this period are a number of small metal pins and brooches. Phase B refers to the peak in the 9th century, from which the present walls all date. The souterrains were built during this phase. The entranceway to the fort was a paved passage flanked by walls and penetrating the inner wall through an 8-m-long tunnel with a ceiling of large capstones. The inner walls were terraced and likely much higher than they are now.

The presence of three walls has led some to view Cahercommaun as a &quot;Royal&quot; residence. This is not supported by the structures and findings, however. Whilst the innermost wall is clearly defensive in nature, both outer walls are too poorly constructed and flimsy to offer much military value. In conjunction with the radial walls (see drawing on the info sign) they seem to have served a domestic rather than defensive purpose. There is also not much in way of findings to support a &quot;high status&quot; theory of the inhabitants. No gold was found except in minute traces used for decoration on other materials. Except for the silver brooch, &quot;jewellery&quot; was made from iron, copper, bone and glass. What has been found in large quantities are animal bones, of sheep, goat, pig, horse, deer and others but dominantly cattle (97% by weight). These were scattered inside the fort and together with other accumulated materials had raised the floor level by around 1.5 meters above the bedrock. Numerous tools (iron knives and shears, 55 spindle whorls) were also found, indicating the presence of a self-sufficient (wool?) production centre here throughout phase B.

After phase B ended, possibly after less than a century, in phase C the entry passage was realigned to a new building set up in the centre of the inner wall circle. Circular structures from phase B seem to have been replaced with the use of rectangular buildings. By that stage, enough material has accumulated inside the inner wall that the lowest terraces were now at floor level and hearths were built on them.

The fort was abandoned sometime in the 10th century. One interpretation of the findings is that Cahercommaun served an important role in the collection of tribute and patronage that was crucial to the working of the small kingdoms of the time. A once dominant but later defeated and coopted clan like the &quot;Ui Chormaic&quot; may have used the structure as a location for collecting cattle tribute prior to their delivery to the ultimate recipient, such as the &quot;Corcu Modruadh&quot;. The abandonment in the 10th century may tie in with the rise of the &quot;Dál gCais&quot;, who rose to dominance in the Burren around that time.

<text>Harold Arthur &quot;Red&quot; Poling (October 14, 1925 – May 12, 2012) was an American automobile businessman who was CEO and chairman of Ford Motor Company from 1990 to 1993.

==Early life and education==
Poling was born October 14, 1925, in Troy, Michigan, and grew up in Fairfax, Virginia, in Northern Virginia. Poling graduated from Monmouth College in 1949. He earned his MBA at Indiana University.

==Career==
===United States Navy===
Poling was a fighter pilot in the United States Navy. His sometime corporate rival, Robert Lutz, had been a fighter pilot in the United States Marine Corps. Their clashes sometimes led subordinates to joke about &quot;who won the dogfight today?&quot;

===Ford Motor Company===
Poling started at Ford Motor Company as an intern, while still attending Indiana University. After school, he took a job in 1951 as a cost analyst at Ford&#x27;s Steel Division. Poling made his swift climb through the company as a financial executive, manager, assistant controller, and controller of the transmission and chassis division during the 1960s, then as controller of the engine division, then controller of the car product development group. During this time he was responsible for codification of much of Ford&#x27;s &quot;Finance Manual&quot;, directing his subordinates in standardization of the company&#x27;s financial reporting and analysis practices. During the mid-1970s he worked in Ford&#x27;s European Operations.

In the late 1970s he was vice president of corporate staffs, then in 1980 replaced William O. Bourke as executive vice-president of North American Automotive Operations (the company&#x27;s biggest operating unit). The company was in cash and cost trouble, and Bourke refused to make some of the cost cuts that chairman Philip Caldwell thought necessary. Poling was never averse to cutting cost and succeeded in returning the unit to profitability. He was often cited as the man that saved Ford Motor Company in the 80&#x27;s.

He was the president of the Ford Motor Company between February 1985, and October 1987, when he took the role of second vice chairman alongside then vice chairman William Clay Ford Jr. He became the CEO and chairman in March 1990, and remained in that role until 1993.

<text>Louis Joseph Félix Frémaux (13 August 1921 – 20 March 2017) was a French conductor.

==Life and career==
Frémaux was born in Aire-sur-la-Lys, France and came from an artistic background; his father was a painter, and his wife was a music teacher.

He studied music at the conservatoire in Valenciennes, but his studies were interrupted by the Second World War, when he joined the French Resistance; at the end of the war he was commissioned in the French Foreign Legion and was posted to Vietnam in 1945-46. He entered the Paris Conservatoire in 1947, studied under Louis Fourestier and Jacques Chailley, and graduated in 1952 with a first prize in conducting.

Frémaux worked with the orchestra of the Opéra de Monte-Carlo, after having been released from the French Foreign Legion (to which he had been recalled for service in Algeria) at the request of Prince Rainier. For ten years he helped build the reputation of the Monte Carlo orchestra, as well as conducting opera premieres there. He was the first music director of the Orchestre Philharmonique Rhône-Alpes (later the Orchestre National de Lyon), from 1969 to 1971.

In the UK, Frémaux was principal conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO) from 1969 to 1978. During his CBSO tenure, he formed the CBSO Chorus, with the baritone Gordon Clinton as its chorus master. In 1978 he was awarded an honorary DMus from Birmingham University; he also became a member of the Royal Academy of Music. However, his CBSO tenure ended in controversy after the relationship between Frémaux and the orchestra players had broken down.

Frémaux served as chief conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra from 1979 to 1982. He died in March 2017 at the age of 95.

He was made a Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1969.

==Discography==
In 1963, he recorded a world premiere, Marc-Antoine Charpentier’s, &quot;Dialogus inter angelos et pastores Judae in nativitatem Domini&quot; H.420, and &quot;In nativitatem Domini canticum&quot; H.314, with Marie-Claire Alain, organ, Ensemble Vocal Stéphane Caillat and the Orchestre Jean-François Paillard. 

By the early 1980s Frémaux had recorded over fifty works, winning a special citation from the Koussevitsky Jury for the &#x27;Nottuni ed Alba&#x27; and Second Symphony of John McCabe. Other recordings include Berlioz (Grande Messe des Morts, Symphonie Fantastique), Bizet (Symphony in C, Roma), Delalande (Psalms 12 and 144), Fauré (Requiem), Ibert (Bacchanale, Bostoniana, Louisville Concerto, Divertissement), Poulenc (Gloria, Piano Concerto), Saint-Saëns (Symphony No 3, works for cello and orchestra) and Walton (Gloria, Te Deum, Façade, The Wise Virgins). He also conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in the Symphonie Fantastique (1988) and a Ravel programme of &quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot; Suite No. 2, La Valse, the complete ballet Ma Mère l&#x27;Oye and Boléro (1989).

Louis Frémaux may be seen as conductor in two piano concertos with Samson François (Ravel Concerto for the Left Hand, Paris, 1964, and Grieg, Paris, 1967), on EMI Classics DVD 490437.

<doc id="764674" wikidata="Q250414" url="?curid=764674" title="Poliziano">
<text>Agnolo (or Angelo) Ambrogini (; 14 July 1454 – 24 September 1494), commonly known as Angelo Poliziano () or simply Poliziano, anglicized as Politian, was an Italian classical scholar and poet of the Florentine Renaissance. His scholarship was instrumental in the divergence of Renaissance (or Humanist) Latin from medieval norms and for developments in philology. His nickname &quot;Poliziano&quot;, by which he is chiefly identified to the present day, was derived from the Latin name of his birthplace, Montepulciano ().

Poliziano&#x27;s works include translations of passages from Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, an edition of the poetry of Catullus and commentaries on classical authors and literature. It was his classical scholarship that brought him the attention of the wealthy and powerful Medici family that ruled Florence. He served the Medici as a tutor to their children, and later as a close friend and political confidant. His later poetry, including &quot;La Giostra&quot;, glorified his patrons.

He used his didactic poem &quot;Manto&quot;, written in the 1480s, as an introduction to his lectures on Virgil.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Poliziano was born as Agnolo Ambrogini in Montepulciano, in central Tuscany in 1454. His father Benedetto, a jurist of good family and distinguished ability, was murdered by political antagonists for adopting the cause of Piero de&#x27; Medici in Montepulciano; this circumstance gave Agnolo, as his eldest son, a claim on the House of Medici.

At the age of ten, after the premature death of his father, Poliziano began his studies at Florence, as the guest of a cousin. There he learned the classical languages of Latin and Greek. From Marsilio Ficino he learned the rudiments of philosophy. At 13 he began to circulate Latin letters; at 17 he wrote essays in Greek versification; and at 18 he published an edition of Catullus. In 1470 he won the title of &quot;homericus adulescens&quot; by translating books II-V of the &quot;Iliad&quot; into Latin hexameters. Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, the autocrat of Florence and the chief patron of learning in Italy at the time, took Poliziano into his household, made him the tutor of his children, among which were Piero the Unfortunate and Giovanni, the future Pope Leo X. The humanistic content of his lessons brought him into constant conflict with their mother, Clarice. Lorenzo also secured him a distinguished post at the University of Florence. During this time, Poliziano lectured at the Platonic Academy under the leadership of Marsilio Ficino, at the Careggi Villa.

===Adulthood and teaching===

Among Poliziano&#x27;s pupils could be numbered the chief students of Europe, the men who were destined to carry to their homes the &quot;spolia opima&quot; of Italian culture. He also educated students from Germany, England and Portugal.

It was the method of professors at that period to read the Greek and Latin authors with their class, dictating philological and critical notes, emending corrupt passages in the received texts, offering elucidations of the matter, and teaching laws, manners, religious and philosophical opinions of the ancients. Poliziano covered nearly the whole ground of classical literature during his tenure, and published the notes of his courses upon Ovid, Suetonius, Statius, Pliny the Younger, and Quintilian. He also undertook a recension of the text of Justinian II&#x27;s &quot;Digest&quot; and lectured about it. This recension influenced the Roman code.

===Proposal to King John II of Portugal===

Poliziano wrote a letter to John II of Portugal paying him a profound homage:

:&quot;to render you thanks on behalf of all who belong to this century, which now favours of your quasi-divine merits, now boldly competing with ancient centuries and all Antiquity.&quot;

and considering his achievements to be of merit above Alexander the Great or Julius Caesar. He offered himself to write an epic work giving an account of John II&#x27;s accomplishments in navigation and conquests. The king replied in a positive manner, in a letter of October 23, 1491, but delayed the commission. The epic work regarding Portuguese discoveries was only written almost one hundred years later by Luís de Camões.

===Final years===

Poliziano spent his final years without financial or other worries, studying philosophy. Piero the Unfortunate even asked Pope Alexander VI to make him a cardinal.

It is likely that Poliziano was homosexual, or at least had male lovers, and he never married. Evidence includes denunciations of sodomy made to the Florentine authorities, poems and letters of contemporaries, and allusions within his work (most notably the &quot;Orfeo&quot;). He may also have been a lover of Pico della Mirandola. 

Prior to his exhumation in 2007, the circumstances of his death were also sometimes considered to be evidence of homosexuality: some evidence suggested that he was killed by a fever (possibly resulting from syphilis) which was exacerbated by standing under the windowsill of a boy he was infatuated with despite being ill. Others thought that his death was precipitated by the loss of his friend and patron Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici in April 1492, Poliziano himself dying on 24 September 1494, just before the foreign invasion gathering in France swept over Italy.

In 2007, the bodies of Poliziano and Pico della Mirandola were exhumed from the Church of San Marco in Florence to establish the causes of their deaths. Forensic tests showed that both Poliziano and Pico likely died of arsenic poisoning, possibly the order of Lorenzo&#x27;s successor, Piero de&#x27; Medici.

==Legacy==

Poliziano was well known as a scholar, a professor, a critic, and a Latin poet in an age when the classics were still studied with assimilative curiosity, and not with the scientific industry of a later period. He was the representative of that age of scholarship in which students drew their ideal of life from antiquity. He was also known as an Italian poet, a contemporary of Ariosto.

At the same time, he was busy as a translator from the Greek. His versions of Epictetus, Hippocrates, Galen, Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Eroticus&quot; and Plato&#x27;s &quot;Charmides&quot; distinguished him as a writer. Of these learned labours, the most universally acceptable to the public of that time were a series of discursive essays on philology and criticism, first published in 1489 under the title of &quot;Miscellanea&quot;. They had an immediate and lasting effect, influencing the scholars of the next century.

Anthony Grafton writes that Poliziano&#x27;s &quot;conscious adoption of a new standard of accuracy and precision&quot; enabled him &quot;to prove that his scholarship was something new, something distinctly better than that of the previous generation&quot;:
By treating the study of antiquity as completely irrelevant to civic life and by suggesting that in any case only a tiny elite could study the ancient world with adequate rigor, Poliziano departed from the tradition of classical studies in Florence. Earlier Florentine humanists had studied the ancient world in order to become better men and citizens. Poliziano by contrast insisted above all on the need to understand the past in the light of every possibly relevant bit of evidence — and to scrap any belief about the past that did not rest on firm documentary foundations ... [But] when he set ancient works back into their historical context Poliziano eliminated whatever contemporary relevance they might have had.
==Works==

His Latin and Greek works include:
* the poem &quot;Manto&quot;, in which he pronounced a panegyric of Virgil;
* the &quot;Ambra&quot;, which contains an idyllic sketch of Tuscan landscape and a eulogy of Homer;
* the &quot;Rusticus&quot;, which celebrated country life;
* the &quot;Nutricia&quot;, which was intended to serve as a general introduction to the study of ancient and modern poetry.

His principal Italian works are:
* his most highly regarded work in Italian, , or &quot;La Giostra&quot;, written upon Giuliano de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s victory in a tournament in 1475. This work was left unfinished following the 1478 Pazzi conspiracy, which resulted in the assassination of its protagonist. In addition, Lorenzo&#x27;s wife Clarice strongly disapproved of the humanistic nature of the poem, causing Politian to resign, leave Florence in 1479 and settle in Mantua, where he set to work on the .
* the &quot;Orfeo&quot;, a lyrical drama performed at Mantua with musical accompaniment;
* a collection of Tuscan songs, reproducing various forms of popular poetry distinguished by a roseate fluency.

His philosophical works are:
* &quot;Praelectio de dialectica&quot; (1491), an introduction to Aristotelian logic;
* &quot;Lamia. Praelectio in Priora Aristotelis Analytica&quot; (1492);
* &quot;Dialectica&quot; (1493), an introduction to a course on Aristotelian philosophy.
