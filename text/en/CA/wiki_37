<text>Camellia sinensis is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree in the flowering plant family Theaceae. Its leaves, leaf buds, and stems can be used to produce tea. Common names include tea plant, tea shrub, and tea tree (unrelated to &quot;Melaleuca alternifolia&quot;, the source of tea tree oil, or the genus &quot;Leptospermum&quot; commonly called tea tree).

White tea, yellow tea, green tea, oolong, dark tea (which includes pu-erh tea) and black tea are all harvested from one of two major varieties grown today, &quot;C. sinensis&quot; var. &quot;sinensis&quot; and &quot;C. s.&quot; var. &quot;assamica&quot;, but are processed differently to attain varying levels of oxidation with black tea being the most oxidized and white being the least. Kukicha (twig tea) is also harvested from &quot;C. sinensis&quot;, but uses twigs and stems rather than leaves.

== Description ==
&quot;Camellia sinensis&quot; is native to East Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, and Southeast Asia, but it is today cultivated all around the world in tropical and subtropical regions. It is an evergreen shrub or small tree that is usually trimmed to below when cultivated for its leaves. It has a strong taproot. The flowers are yellow-white, in diameter, with seven or eight petals.


The seeds of &quot;C. sinensis&quot; and &quot;C. oleifera&quot; can be pressed to yield tea oil, a sweetish seasoning and cooking oil that should not be confused with tea tree oil, an essential oil that is used for medical and cosmetic purposes, and originates from the leaves of a different plant.


The leaves are long and broad. Fresh leaves contain about 4% caffeine, as well as related compounds including theobromine. The young, light-green leaves are preferably harvested for tea production when they have short, white hairs on the underside. Older leaves are deeper green. Different leaf ages produce differing tea qualities, since their chemical compositions are different. Usually, the tip (bud) and the first two to three leaves are harvested for processing. This hand picking is repeated every one to two weeks.

In 2017, Chinese scientists sequenced the genome of &quot;C. s. var. assamica.&quot; It contains about three billion base pairs, which was larger than most plants previously sequenced.

== Taxonomy ==
The generic name &quot;Camellia&quot; is taken from the Latinized name of Rev. Georg Kamel, SJ (1661–1706), a Moravian-born Jesuit lay brother, pharmacist, and missionary to the Philippines.

Carl Linnaeus chose his name in 1753 for the genus to honor Kamel&#x27;s contributions to botany (although Kamel did not discover or name this plant, or any &quot;Camellia&quot;, and Linnaeus did not consider this plant a &quot;Camellia&quot; but a &quot;Thea&quot;).

Robert Sweet shifted all formerly &quot;Thea&quot; species to the genus &quot;Camellia&quot; in 1818. The name &quot;sinensis&quot; means &quot;from China&quot; in Latin.

Four varieties of &quot;C. sinensis&quot; are recognized. Of these, &quot;C. sinensis&quot; var. &quot;sinensis&quot; and &quot;C. s.&quot; var. &quot;assamica&quot; (JW Masters) Kitamura are most commonly used for tea, and &quot;C. s.&quot; var. &quot;pubilimba&quot; Hung T. Chang and &quot;C. s.&quot; var. &quot;dehungensis&quot; (Hung T. Chang &amp; BH Chen) TL Ming are sometimes used locally. The Cambodia type tea (&quot;C. assamica&quot; subsp. &quot;lasiocaly&quot;) was originally considered a type of assam tea. However, later genetic work showed that it is a hybrid between Chinese small leaf tea and assam type tea.

Tea plants are native to East Asia, and probably originated in the borderlands of north Burma and southwestern China.
* Chinese (small leaf) tea [&quot;C. sinensis&quot; var. &quot;sinensis&quot;]
* Chinese Western Yunnan Assam (large leaf) tea [&quot;C. sinensis&quot; var. &quot;assamica&quot;]
* Indian Assam (large leaf) tea [&quot;C. sinensis&quot; var. &quot;assamica&quot;]
* Chinese Southern Yunnan Assam (large leaf) tea [&quot;C. sinensis&quot; var. &quot;assamica&quot;]

Chinese (small leaf) tea may have originated in southern China possibly with hybridization of unknown wild tea relatives. However, since no wild populations of this tea are known, the precise location of its origin is speculative.

Given their genetic differences forming distinct clades, Chinese Assam type tea (&quot;C. s.&quot; var. &quot;assamica&quot;) may have two different parentages – one being found in southern Yunnan (Xishuangbanna, Pu&#x27;er City) and the other in western Yunnan (Lincang, Baoshan). Many types of Southern Yunnan Assam tea have been hybridized with the closely related species &quot;Camellia taliensis.&quot; Unlike Southern Yunnan Assam tea, Western Yunnan Assam tea shares many genetic similarities with Indian Assam type tea (also &quot;C. s.&quot; var. &quot;assamica&quot;). Thus, Western Yunnan Assam tea and Indian Assam tea both may have originated from the same parent plant in the area where southwestern China, Indo-Burma, and Tibet meet. However, as the Indian Assam tea shares no haplotypes with Western Yunnan Assam tea, Indian Assam tea is likely to have originated from an independent domestication. Some Indian Assam tea appears to have hybridized with the species &quot;Camellia pubicosta.&quot;

Assuming a generation of 12 years, Chinese small leaf tea is estimated to have diverged from Assam tea around 22,000 years ago; this divergence would correspond to the last glacial maximum, while Chinese Assam tea and Indian Assam tea diverged 2,800 years ago. 

Chinese small leaf type tea was introduced into India in 1836 by the British and some Indian Assam type tea (e.g. Darjeeling tea) appear to be genetic hybrids of Chinese small leaf type tea, native Indian Assam, and possibly also closely related wild tea species.

=== Cultivars ===
Hundreds, if not thousands of cultivars of &quot;C. sinensis&quot; are known. Some Japanese cultivars include:
* Benifuuki
* Fushun
* Kanayamidori
* Meiryoku
* Saemidori
* Okumidori
* Yabukita

== Cultivation ==
&quot;Camellia sinensis&quot; is mainly cultivated in tropical and subtropical climates, in areas with at least 127 cm (50 in) of rainfall a year. Tea plants prefer a rich and moist growing location in full to part sun, and can be grown in hardiness zones 7–9. However, the clonal one is commercially cultivated from the equator to as far north as Cornwall and Scotland on the UK mainland. Many high quality teas are grown at high elevations, up to , as the plants grow more slowly and acquire more flavor.

Tea plants will grow into a tree if left undisturbed, but cultivated plants are pruned to waist height for ease of plucking. Two principal varieties are used, the small-leaved Chinese variety plant (&quot;C. s. sinensis&quot;) and the large-leaved Assamese plant (&quot;C. s. assamica&quot;), used mainly for black tea.

=== Chinese teas ===
The Chinese plant is a small-leafed bush with multiple stems that reaches a height of some . It is native to southeast China. The first tea plant variety to be discovered, recorded, and used to produce tea dates back 3,000 years ago; it yields some of the most popular teas.

&quot;C. s.&quot; var. &quot;waldenae&quot; was considered a different species, &quot;C. waldenae&quot; by SY Hu, but it was later identified as a variety of &quot;C. sinensis&quot;. This variety is commonly called Waldenae Camellia. It is seen on Sunset Peak and Tai Mo Shan in Hong Kong. It is also distributed in the Guangxi province.

=== Indian teas ===
Three main kinds of tea are produced in India:
* Assam, from the var. &quot;assamica&quot; plant, comes from the near sea-level heavily forested northeastern section of India, the state of Assam. Tea from here is rich and full-bodied. The first tea estate in India was established in Assam in 1837. Teas are manufactured in either the &quot;orthodox&quot; process or the &quot;crush, tear, curl&quot; (CTC) process.
* Darjeeling, from the var. &quot;sinensis&quot; plant, is from the cool and wet Darjeeling highland region, tucked in the foothills of the Himalayas. Tea plantations could be at altitudes as high as . The tea is delicately flavored, and considered to be one of the finest teas in the world. The Darjeeling plantations have three distinct harvests, termed &#x27;flushes&#x27;, and the tea produced from each flush has a unique flavor. First (spring) flush teas are light and aromatic, while the second (summer) flush produces tea with a bit more bite. The third, or autumn flush gives a tea that is lesser in quality.
* Nilgiri is from a southern region of India almost as high as Darjeeling. Grown at elevations between , Nilgiri teas are subtle and rather gentle, and are frequently blended with other, more robust teas.
=== Pests and diseases ===

Tea leaves are eaten by some herbivores, such as the caterpillars of the willow beauty (&quot;Peribatodes rhomboidaria&quot;), a geometer moth.

== Health effects ==

Although health benefits have been assumed throughout the history of using tea as a common beverage, no high-quality evidence shows that tea confers significant benefits. In clinical research over the early 21st century, tea has been studied extensively for its potential to lower the risk of human diseases, but none of this research is conclusive as of 2017.

== Biosynthesis of caffeine ==
Caffeine, a molecule produced in &quot;C. sinensis&quot;, functions as a secondary metabolite and acts as a natural pesticide: it can paralyze and kill herbivorous insects feeding on the plant. Caffeine is a purine alkaloid and its biosynthesis occurs in young tea leaves and is regulated by several enzymes. The biosynthetic pathway in &quot;C. sinensis&quot; is similar to other caffeine-producing plants such as coffee or guayusa. Analysis of the pathway was carried out by harvesting young leaves and using reverse transcription PCR to analyze the genes encoding the major enzymes involved in synthesizing caffeine. The gene &quot;TCS1&quot; encodes caffeine synthase. Younger leaves feature high concentrations of TCS1 transcripts, allowing more caffeine to be synthesized during this time. Dephosphorylation of xanthosine-5&#x27;-monophosphate into xanthosine is the committed step for the xanthosines entering the beginning of the most common pathway. A sequence of reactions turns xanthosine (9β--ribofuranosylxanthine) into 7-methylxanthosine, then 7-methylxanthine, then theobromine (3,7-dimethylxanthine), and finally into caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine).

<doc id="767305" wikidata="Q426955" url="?curid=767305" title="Chloracne">
<text>Chloracne is an acneiform eruption of blackheads, cysts, and pustules associated with exposure to certain halogenated aromatic compounds, such as chlorinated dioxins and dibenzofurans. The lesions are most frequently found on the cheeks, behind the ears, in the armpits and groin region.

The condition was first described in German industrial workers in 1897 by Siegfried Bettmann, and was initially believed to be caused by exposure to chlorine (hence the name &quot;chloracne&quot;). It was only in the mid-1950s that chloracne was associated with aromatic hydrocarbons. The substances that may cause chloracne are now collectively known as chloracnegens.

Chloracne is particularly linked to toxic exposure to dioxins (byproducts of many chemical processes, including the manufacture of herbicides such as Agent Orange)—so much so that it is considered a clinical sign of dioxin exposure. The severity and onset of chloracne may follow a typical asymptotic dose-response relationship curve.

==Cause==
Chloracne normally results from direct skin contact with chloracnegens, although ingestion and inhalation are also possible causative routes.

Chloracnegens are fat-soluble, meaning they persist in the body fat for a very long period following exposure. Chloracne is a chronic inflammatory condition that results from this persistence, in combination with the toxin&#x27;s chemical properties. It is believed, at least from rodent models, that the toxin activates a series of receptors promoting macrophage proliferation, inducing neutrophilia and leading to a generalised inflammatory response in the skin. This process may also be augmented by induction of excess tumor necrosis factor in the blood serum.

The inflammatory processes lead to the formation of keratinous plugs in skin pores, forming yellowish cysts and dark pustules. The associated pus is usually a color of green approximating that of a tennis ball. The skin lesions occur mainly in the face, but in more severe cases they involve the shoulders and chest, the back, and the abdomen. In advanced cases, the lesions appear also on the arms, neck, thighs, legs, hands and feet.

In some instances, chloracne may not appear for three to four weeks after toxic exposure; however, in other cases—particularly in events of massive exposure—the symptoms may appear within days.

==Treatment==
Once chloracne has been identified, the primary action is to remove the patient and all other individuals from the source of contamination. Further treatment is symptomatic.

Secondary infections on severe or persistent lesions may need to be treated with oral antibiotics or isotretinoin. However, chloracne itself can be highly resistant to any treatment.

The course of the disease is highly variable. In some cases the lesions may disappear within two years or so; however, in other cases the lesions may be effectively permanent (mean duration of lesions in one 1984 study was 26 years, with some workers remaining disfigured over three decades after exposure).

==Related conditions==
Chloracne is very often seen in combination with hyperhidrosis (clammy, sweaty skin) and porphyria cutanea tarda (a skin condition of increased pigmentation, hair coarsening and blistering).

==Notable cases==

* In mid-1960s, Dow Chemical paid Dr Albert Kligman $10,000 in conduct the experiments on the toxicity effects of Dioxin (TCDD) on at least 70 prisoners at the Holmesburg Prison in Philadelphia. No records of the prisoners&#x27; identities appear to have been kept and there were no follow-up studies after the testing period. Several of the inmates developed severe cases of chloracne and some developed blisters that, untreated, lasted four to seven months.
* In 1949, 226 workers became ill after a container of herbicide exploded at a Monsanto Company plant in Nitro, West Virginia. Many were diagnosed with chloracne; a medical report at the time described &quot;systemic intoxication in the workers involving most major organ systems.&quot;
* 193 cases of chloracne occurred in Seveso, Italy, in 1976 following an industrial accident in which up to a few kilograms of TCDD were released into the atmosphere.
* Thousands of individuals were exposed at Fort McClellan, Alabama, when a chemical weapons training center and a nearby Monsanto factory disposed of chemicals into a creek over several decades. Many individuals settled out of court, but a class-action suit is still ongoing. Although the incineration of the chemical weapons at Fort McClellan ended in 2011, areas of the base remain closed or off-limits due to the residual contamination.
* In 1968, almost 2,000 individuals in northern Kyūshū, Japan, suffered chloracne, among other symptoms, after chronic exposure to cooking oils contaminated with PCBs and PCDFs. The syndrome came to be called &quot;Yushō disease&quot; or &quot;Rice Oil&quot; disease.
* In 1979, a similar case of mass contamination of cooking oil was reported in central Taiwan. Over 2,000 individuals were affected by what came to be called &quot;Yu-Cheng&quot;.
* Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko suffered from prominent facial chloracne and was diagnosed with dioxin poisoning in late 2004.
*A Hong Kong journalist from the Stand News, Chan Yu-hong, declared in a Facebook post that he was diagnosed by a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner with chloracne after exposure to tear gas while covering the 2019 Hong Kong Protests.

<doc id="767313" wikidata="Q4918396" url="?curid=767313" title="Bispectral index">
<text>Bispectral index (BIS) is one of several technologies used to monitor depth of anesthesia. BIS monitors are used to supplement Guedel&#x27;s classification system for determining depth of anesthesia. Titrating anesthetic agents to a specific bispectral index during general anesthesia in adults (and children over 1 year old) allows the anesthetist to adjust the amount of anesthetic agent to the needs of the patient, possibly resulting in a more rapid emergence from anesthesia. Use of the BIS monitor could reduce the incidence of intraoperative awareness during anaesthesia. The exact details of the algorithm used to create the BIS index have not been disclosed by the company that developed it.

BIS cannot be used as the sole monitor of anaesthesia, as it is affected by several other factors, including the anaesthetic drugs used (BIS is relatively insensitive to agents such as ketamine and nitrous oxide), and muscle movement or artefact from surgical equipment. BIS is used as an adjunct to monitoring under anaesthesia - its use has been shown to reduce overall dose of anaesthetic agent used and therefore may improve recovery time from anaesthesia.

==History==
The BIS was introduced by Aspect Medical Systems, Inc. in 1994 as a novel measure of the level of consciousness by algorithmic analysis of a patient&#x27;s electroencephalogram during general anesthesia. This is used in conjunction with other physiologic monitoring such as electromyography to estimate the depth of anesthesia in order to minimize the possibility of intraoperative awareness. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared BIS monitoring in 1996 for assessing the hypnotic effects of general anesthetics and sedatives. The FDA further stated in 2003 that &quot;...A reduction in awareness provides a public health benefit, in that BIS technology can now provide anesthestists with a way to reduce this often debilitating, yet preventable medical error&quot;. Aspect Medical was acquired by Covidien in 2009.

==Calculation==
The bispectral index is a statistically based, empirically derived complex parameter. It is a weighted sum of several electroencephalographic subparameters, including a time domain, frequency domain, and high order spectral subparameters. The BIS monitor provides a single dimensionless number, which ranges from 0 (equivalent to EEG silence) to 100. A BIS value between 40 and 60 indicates an appropriate level for general anesthesia, as recommended by the manufacturer. The BIS monitor thus gives the anesthetist an indication of how &quot;deep&quot; under anesthesia the patient is. Additionally, BIS values less than 40 for greater than 5 minutes have been associated with increased risk of stroke (hazard ratio of 3.23), MI (1.94) and death (1.41).

The essence of BIS is to take a complex signal (the EEG), analyse it, and process the result into a single number. Several other systems claim to be able to perform the same thing. The recent availability of cheap, fast computer processors has enabled great advances in this field. When a subject is awake, the cerebral cortex is very active, and the EEG reflects vigorous activity. When asleep or under general anesthesia, the pattern of activity changes. Overall, there is a change from higher-frequency signals to lower-frequency signals (which can be shown by Fourier analysis), and there is a tendency for signal correlation from different parts of the cortex to become more random.

As with other types of EEG analysis, the calculation algorithm that the BIS monitor uses is proprietary, although it has been successfully reverse engineered.

==Limitations==
Some of the limitations of this form of processed EEG monitoring are:
* Unreliability with certain drugs, such as ketamine, nitrous oxide and ephedrine. Ketamine may produce a paradoxical transient increase in BIS values as this increase is associated with deepening of the hypnotic state.
* Difficulty titrating anesthetics in patients 6 months or younger.
* Interference by other medical devices such as electrosurgical cautery or forced air warming devices.
* Unreliable in cases of hypothermia or neurological impairment.
* Events unrelated to titration of anesthetic drugs can produce rapid changes in BIS values, such as cerebral hypoperfusion, gas embolism, and hemorrhage.
* The BIS value may lag behind the observed clinical state by 5 to 15 seconds related to EEG processing.

==Benefits==
BIS monitoring is widely used in operating rooms and ICUs, as well as in emergency departments. Some of the benefits that have been attributed to it include:
* Reduced time to extubation and discharge from the operating room and PACU 
* Reduced risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting 
* Reducing the use of propofol 
* Reduced risk of awareness, unless this claim is questioned by some studies.

==Relevance==
The BIS is an electroencephalogram-derived multivariant scale that, when a drug such a propofol is used, correlates with the metabolic rate of glucose. Both loss of consciousness and awakening from anesthesia are correlated with this scale. The efficacy of BIS index monitoring is not without controversy.

Some controlled studies have found that using the BIS reduced the incidence of memory but this was not confirmed in several very large multicenter studies on awareness. A Cochrane review in 2014 found that &quot;Four studies (7761 patients) that used clinical signs as a guide to anaesthetic administration in standard practice, as the control group, demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of awareness with BIS monitoring. Four studies (26,530 patients) compared BIS monitoring with end tidal anaesthetic gas (ETAG) monitoring as a guide to management of anaesthesia and they did not demonstrate any difference in terms of intraoperative awareness&quot;. The &quot;Sociedad de Anestesiología Reanimación y Terapéutica del Dolor de Madrid&quot; recommends monitoring of anesthetic depth in accordance with literature-based evidence. BIS, however, is not explicitly endorsed. In fact, they cite an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) statement saying that the decision for cerebral function monitoring should be made on an individual basis.

The bispectral index has not been proven to measure the level of consciousness, independently of the cause of reduced consciousness (whether this be drugs, metabolic disease, hypothermia, head trauma, hypovolemia, natural sleep and so on). Not all unconscious patients will have a low BIS value, although the general clinical state may be very different from one to the other, and the prognosis may also differ. Furthermore, not all conscious patients will have a high BIS value.

The bispectral index is prone to artifacts. Some conscious patients who are administered neuromuscular blocking agents such as succinylcholine may have low bispectral index scores; thus, the BIS may fail to detect consciousness in such patients. Its numbers cannot be relied upon in all situations, including brain death, circulatory arrest or hypothermia. A monitor of the Autonomic Nervous System (the first commercial monitor was the ANEMON-I monitor developed by former Swiss company Medical System SA based on the patent WO1997037586) may be more appropriate for purposely assessing the reaction to noxious stimuli during surgery. However, a monitor of the central nervous system may be more appropriate for monitoring consciousness. After the publication of the &quot;B-Aware Trial&quot; ensuring that the BIS index was below 60 was suggested to reduce the risk of anesthesia awareness during surgery for a &#x27;high risk&#x27; group, when using a conventional anaesthetic technique. However, this result was not reproduced by a recently published randomized control trial, the &quot;B-Unaware Trial&quot;. In it, the use of BIS monitoring was not associated with a lower incidence of anesthesia awareness. In some cases, the BIS may underestimate the depth of anesthesia, leading the anesthetist to administer a higher than necessary dose of anesthetic agent(s). In such cases, the patient may be anesthetized to a lower BIS level than is necessary for the surgery or procedure—this is called &quot;treating the BIS&quot;, and may result in a deeper level of anesthesia than required).

The monitoring of EEG in ICU patients has been employed in one form or other for more than two decades. BIS monitoring is also being used during transport of critically ill patients in ambulances, helicopters and other vehicles.

Some studies show a greater incidence of intra-operative awareness in children, when compared to adults. The correlation between bispectral index in children over one year and state of consciousness has already been proven, although in younger patients the monitor is unreliable because of the differences between immature infant EEG patterns and the adult EEG patterns that the BIS algorithm utilises.

Specifically for intraoperative awareness, according to a 2013 article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;Today, the BIS monitor has become the most controversial medical device in anesthesiology, if not all of surgery.&quot;

<doc id="767316" wikidata="Q2424093" url="?curid=767316" title="Thomas Godfrey (inventor)">
<text>Thomas Godfrey (January 10, 1704 – December 1749) was a glazier and self-taught mathematician and astronomer in the Pennsylvania Colony, who invented the octant in 1730. A similar octant was also independently invented about the same time by John Hadley in London with Hadley receiving the greater share of the credit for development.

He published almanacs and contributed essays on mathematics, astronomy and general topics to the &quot;Pennsylvania Gazette&quot; and &quot;Pennsylvania Journal&quot;. He assisted the Welsh surveyor Lewis Evans in conducting astronomical observations to correct the longitude of Philadelphia on maps published by Evans.

He was friends with Benjamin Franklin and a founding member of the Junto club, which was the precursor of the American Philosophical Society. He served as a director of the Library Company of Philadelphia and was a member of American Philosophical Society with the title &quot;mathematician&quot;.

==Early life==
Godfrey was born January 10, 1704, to Joseph and Catherine Godfrey on the family farm in Bristol Township, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania. His father died when he was 1 years old and he inherited the family farm at age 21. He moved to Philadelphia and worked as a plumber and a glazier. He installed the glass in Philadelphia&#x27;s State House, now Independence Hall. He was employed at the estate of James Logan who encouraged Godfrey to pursue mathematics and science. He became a deist.

==Career==
While working at James Logan&#x27;s estate, Stenton, Godfrey observed a reflection in a piece of broken glass which prompted the idea for the reflecting quadrant. Godfrey accessed a copy of Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; in Logan&#x27;s library to further expand his idea. While challenged by the Latin text, with Logan&#x27;s support, he was able to learn Latin and apply Newton&#x27;s theories to his idea.

Godfrey began experiments to develop an improved quadrant for determining latitude for navigation. He carried out much of his work in part of a home he rented from Benjamin Franklin. Godfrey completed development of his octant in 1730 and the accuracy of the device was tested by the captain and first mate of the &quot;Trueman&quot; on voyages to the West Indies and Newfoundland.

James Logan sent a description of Godfrey&#x27;s invention to Edmond Halley, the Astronomer Royal in Britain. Logan was surprised to then see an almost identical device described as invented by John Hadley in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;. Hadley received a patent for the octant in 1734 without contest. Godfrey, along with Logan, wrote to the Royal Society to defend his claim that the device was his original invention. The communication including sworn affidavits signed by the Mayor of Philadelphia that Godfrey&#x27;s octant was crafted by Edmund Woolley of wood on November 1730. The communication also noted that Hadley&#x27;s nephew was present at an early demonstration of his invention. His claim was denied, but he did receive a cash reward for his work from the Society.

From 1729 to 1736, Godfrey worked as a publisher of almanacs. He also contributed essays on mathematics, astronomy and general topics to the &quot;Pennsylvania Gazette&quot; and &quot;Pennsylvania Journal&quot;. He assisted Lewis Evans in conducting astronomical observations to correct the longitude of Philadelphia on maps published by Evans.

Godfrey was a founding member, with Benjamin Franklin, of the Junto club, which was the precursor of the American Philosophical Society. Godfrey was a director of the Library Company of Philadelphia and was a member of American Philosophical Society with the title &quot;mathematician&quot;. Franklin described Godfrey at length in his &quot;Autobiography&quot;:

Godfrey died in 1749 at the age of 45. He was originally interred at his farm near Germantown, but over time the grave fell into disrepair. In 1838, John Fanning Watson reinterred the remains of Godfrey, his wife, father and mother to Laurel Hill Cemetery. In 1843, a memorial erected by the Mercantile Library Company of Philadelphia was placed atop their graves.

==Personal life==
Godfrey was married and had five children. His second son, also Thomas Godfrey, was a poet and published several popular works, including the play &quot;The Prince of Parthia&quot;.

<text>Marcel Israël Mauss (; 10 May 1872 – 10 February 1950) was a French sociologist and anthropologist known as the &quot;father of French ethnology&quot;. The nephew of Émile Durkheim, Mauss, in his academic work, crossed the boundaries between sociology and anthropology. Today, he is perhaps better recognised for his influence on the latter discipline, particularly with respect to his analyses of topics such as magic, sacrifice and gift exchange in different cultures around the world. Mauss had a significant influence upon Claude Lévi-Strauss, the founder of structural anthropology. His most famous work is &quot;The Gift&quot; (1925).

==Background==

=== Family and education ===
Mauss was born in Épinal, Vosges, to a Jewish family, his father a merchant and his mother an embroidery shop owner. Unlike his younger brother, Mauss did not join the family business and instead he joined the socialist and cooperative movement in the Vosges. Following the death of his grandfather, the Mauss and Durkheim families grew close and at this time Mauss began to feel concerned about his education and took initiatives in order to learn. Mauss obtained a religious education and was bar mitzvahed, yet by the age of eighteen he stopped practicing his religion.

Mauss studied philosophy at Bordeaux, where his maternal uncle Émile Durkheim was teaching at the time. In the 1890s, Mauss began his lifelong study of linguistics, Indology, Sanskrit, Hebrew, and the &#x27;history of religions and uncivilized peoples&#x27; at the École pratique des hautes études. He passed the &quot;agrégation&quot; in 1893. He was also the first cousin of the much younger Claudette (née Raphael) Bloch, a marine biologist and mother of Maurice Bloch, who became a noted anthropologist. Instead of taking the usual route of teaching at a lycée following college, Mauss moved to Paris and took up the study of comparative religion and Sanskrit.

=== Academic career ===
His first publication in 1896 marked the beginning of a prolific career that would produce several landmarks in sociological literature. Like many members of the group, Mauss was attracted to socialism, especially that espoused by Jean Jaurès. He was particularly engaged around the anti-semitic political events of the Dreyfus affair. Towards the end of the century, he helped edit such left-wing papers as , and , the last in collaboration with Georges Sorel.

In 1901, Mauss began drawing more on ethnography, and his work began to develop characteristics now associated with formal anthropology.

Mauss served in the French army during World War I from 1914 to 1919 as an interpreter. The military service was liberating from Mauss&#x27;s intense academics, as he stated, &quot;I&#x27;m doing wonderfully. I just wasn&#x27;t made for the intellectual life and I am enjoying the life war is giving me&quot; (Fournier 2006: 175). While liberating, he also dealt with the devastation and violence of the war as many of his friends and colleagues died in the war, and his uncle Durkheim died shortly before its end. Mauss began to write a book &quot;On Politics&quot; that remained unfinished, but the early 1920s emphasized his energy for politics through criticism of the Bolshevik&#x27;s coercive resort to violence and their destruction of the market economy.

Like many other followers of Durkheim, Mauss took refuge in administration. He secured Durkheim&#x27;s legacy by founding institutions to carry out research, such as (1924) and in 1926. These institutions stimulated the development of fieldwork-based anthropology by young academics. Among the students he influenced were George Devereux, Jeanne Cuisinier, Alfred Metraux, Marcel Griaule, Georges Dumezil, Denise Paulme, Michel Leiris, Germaine Dieterlen, Louis Dumont, Andre-Georges Haudricourt, Jacques Soustelle, and Germaine Tillion.

In 1901, Mauss was appointed to the Chair of the History of Religions of Non-Civilized Peoples at the École pratique des hautes études. Two years later in 1931 Mauss was elected as the first holder of the Chair of Sociology in the , and soon after he married his secretary in 1934 who soon was bedridden after a poisonous gas incident. Later, in 1940, Mauss was forced out of his job as the Chair of Sociology and out of Paris due to the German occupation and anti-Semitic legislation passed. Mauss remained socially isolated following the war and died in 1950.

=== Émile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss: the uncle and the nephew ===

Moïse Durkheim and Mélanie Isidor, the parents of Émile Durkheim, had four children: Rosine (1848–1930), Félix (1850–1889), Céline (1851–1931), and Émile (1858–1917). Marcel Israël Mauss was one of the two children of Rosine Mauss and Gerson Mauss, alongside his younger brother Camille Henri Mauss. Both the uncle and nephew were born in Épinal, France, with a fourteen-year age difference. Religion is a keyword in the family life of both Mauss and Durkheim, with Moïse Durkheim being the rabbi of Épinal and chief rabbi of Vosges. Although both Mauss and Durkheim later set themselves away from religious beliefs and practices, this contributed to their mutual interest in studying the history and sociology of religion.

In 1887, Émile Durkheim was appointed to the Université de Bordeaux. He was later joined by his nephew in 1890, who was preparing for his degree in philosophy at Bordeaux. During their time at Bordeaux, Durkheim constantly interacted with Mauss through letters, guiding him in academic work and personal life. Between 1893 and 1894, when Mauss started to prepare for &quot;Agrégation&quot;, Durkheim, a philosophy &quot;agrégé&quot; and a member of the exam board, tutored Mauss for the exam. Durkheim also helped connect Mauss with Octave Hamelin, who became Mauss&#x27;s close friend and an important tutor. Durkheim defined his correspondence with Mauss as:

During their time in Bordeaux, Durkheim was a strict and responsible tutor to Mauss. In their interactions through letters, Durkheim frequently demands Mauss to provide timely updates on his studies and his interactions with Rosine and his tutors. He stressed his responsibility to train him:

The interactions between Durkheim and Mauss were not one-way help and guidance. When working on his book &quot;Suicide&quot;, Durkheim asked Mauss to help him annotate articles on suicide cases in the German army, England and Wales, and Spain, with a special focus on ranks and years of service in the army, gender, and professions. Mauss then helped Durkheim compile the statistical tables in &quot;Suicide&quot;. Durkheim, being a controversial figure in academia at the time, also seeks information about himself and other scholars’ interests in &quot;L’Année Sociologique&quot; from Mauss, although stressing it to be “secondary” when compared to updating on what Mauss was doing:

Mauss started assisting Durkheim in organizing and launching the &quot;L’Année Sociologique&quot; between 1895 and 1902. Mauss helped his uncle to recruit potential collaborators, including Paul Fauconnet, Henri Hubert, and Albert Milhaud. Durkheim envisioned the role of his nephew to be the “linchpin” in the formation of the journal and the broader theoretical transformation it would bring. Mauss was assigned to work on the religious sociology section, the most important section for Durkheim, as he envisioned the journal to “create religious sociology” and to “make religion, no longer economics, the matrix of social facts.” Other than recruitment, Mauss was assigned by Durkheim to work up a “list of important works that he think it would be useful to have” and “catalog them by subject.”

The collaboration between the uncle and nephew was not always smooth. Durkheim frequently scolded Mauss in their correspondence about his punctuality and over-complication:

==Theoretical views==

===Marcel Mauss and Émile Durkheim===

Marcel Mauss&#x27;s studies under his uncle Durkheim at Bordeaux led to their doing work together on Primitive Classification which was published in &quot;L&#x27;Année Sociologique&quot;. In this work, Mauss and Durkheim attempted to create a French version of the sociology of knowledge, illustrating the various paths of human thought taken by different cultures, in particular how space and time are connected back to societal patterns. They focused their study on tribal societies in order to achieve depth.

While Mauss called himself a Durkheimian, he interpreted the school of Durkheim as his own. His early works reflect the dependence on Durkheim&#x27;s school, yet as more works, including unpublished texts were read, Mauss preferred to start many projects and often not finish them. Mauss concerned himself more with politics than his uncle, as a member of the Collectivistes, French workers party, and Revolutionary socialist workers party. His political involvement led up to and after World War I.

===&quot;The Gift&quot;===

Mauss has been credited for his analytic framework which has been characterized as more supple, more appropriate for the application of empirical studies, and more fruitful than his earlier studies with Durkheim. His work fell into two categories, one being major ethnological works on exchange as a symbolic system, body techniques and the category of the person, and the second being social science methodology. In his &quot;The Gift&quot;, Mauss argued that gifts are never truly free, rather, human history is full of examples of gifts bringing about reciprocal exchange. The famous question that drove his inquiry into the anthropology of the gift was: &quot;What power resides in the object given that causes its recipient to pay it back?&quot;. The answer is simple: the gift is a &quot;total prestation&quot; (see law of obligations), imbued with &quot;spiritual mechanisms&quot;, engaging the honour of both giver and receiver (the term &quot;total prestation&quot; or &quot;total social fact&quot; (&quot;fait social total&quot;) was coined by his student Maurice Leenhardt after Durkheim&#x27;s &quot;social fact&quot;). Such transactions transcend the divisions between the spiritual and the material in a way that, according to Mauss, is almost &quot;magical&quot;. The giver does not merely give an object but also part of himself, for the object is indissolubly tied to the giver: &quot;the objects are never completely separated from the men who exchange them&quot; (1990:31). 
Because of this bond between giver and gift, the act of giving creates a social bond with an obligation to reciprocate on the part of the recipient. Not to reciprocate means to lose honour and status, but the spiritual implications can be even worse: in Polynesia, failure to reciprocate means to lose &quot;mana&quot;, one&#x27;s spiritual source of authority and wealth. To cite Goldman-Ida&#x27;s summary, &quot;Mauss distinguished between three obligations: giving, the necessary initial step for the creation and maintenance of social relationships; receiving, for to refuse to receive is to reject the social bond; and reciprocating in order to demonstrate one&#x27;s own liberality, honour, and wealth&quot; (2018:341). Mauss describes how society is blinded by ideology, and therefore a system of prestations survives in societies when regarding the economy. Institutions are founded on the unity of individuals and society, and capitalism rests on an unsustainable influence on an individual&#x27;s wants. Rather than focusing on money, Mauss describes the need to focus on faits sociaux totaux, total social facts, which are legal, economic, religious, and aesthetic facts which challenge the sociological method. 

An important notion in Mauss&#x27;s conceptualization of gift exchange is what Gregory (1982, 1997) refers to as &quot;inalienability&quot;. In a commodity economy, there is a strong distinction between objects and persons through the notion of private property. Objects are sold, meaning that the ownership rights are fully transferred to the new owner. The object has thereby become &quot;alienated&quot; from its original owner. In a gift economy, however, the objects that are given are unalienated from the givers; they are &quot;loaned rather than sold and ceded&quot;. It is the fact that the identity of the giver is invariably bound up with the object given that causes the gift to have a power which compels the recipient to reciprocate. Because gifts are unalienable they must be returned; the act of giving creates a gift-debt that has to be repaid. Because of this, the notion of an expected return of the gift creates a relationship over time between two individuals. In other words, through gift-giving, a social bond evolves that is assumed to continue through space and time until the future moment of exchange. Gift exchange therefore leads to a mutual interdependence between giver and receiver. According to Mauss, the &quot;free&quot; gift that is not returned is a contradiction because it cannot create social ties. Following the Durkheimian quest for understanding social cohesion through the concept of solidarity, Mauss&#x27;s argument is that solidarity is achieved through the social bonds created by gift exchange. Mauss emphasizes that exchanging gifts resulted from the will of attaching other people&#x27;to put people under obligations&#x27;, because &quot;in theory such gifts are voluntary, but in fact they are given and repaid under obligation&quot;.

===Mauss and Hubert===

Mauss also focused on the topic of sacrifice. The book &quot;Sacrifice and its Function&quot; which he wrote with Henri Hubert in 1899 argued that sacrifice is a process involving sacralising and desacralising. This was when the &quot;former directed the holy towards the person or object, and the latter away from a person or object.&quot; Mauss and Hubert proposed that the body is better understood not as a natural given. Instead, it should be seen as the product of specific training in attributes, deportments, and habits. Furthermore, the body techniques are biological, sociological, and psychological and in doing an analysis of the body, one must apprehend these elements simultaneously. They defined the person as a category of thought, the articulation of particular embodiment of law and morality. Mauss and Hubert believed that a person was constituted by personages (a set of roles) which were executed through the behaviors and exercise of specific body techniques and attributes.

Mauss and Hubert wrote another book titled &quot;A General Theory of Magic&quot; in 1902 [see external links for PDF]. They studied magic in &#x27;primitive&#x27; societies and how it has manifested into our thoughts and social actions. They argue that social facts are subjective and therefore should be considered magic, but society is not open to accepting this. In the book, Mauss and Hubert state: In magic, we have officers, actions, and representations: we call a person who accomplishes magical actions a &quot;magician&quot;, even if he is not professional; &quot;magical representations&quot; are those ideas and beliefs which correspond to magical actions; as for these actions, with regard to which we have defined the other elements of magic, we shall call them &quot;magical rites&quot;. At this stage it is important to distinguish between these activities and other social practices with which they might be confused.They go on to say that only social occurrences can be considered magical. Individual actions are not magic because if the whole community does not believe in efficacy of a group of actions, it is not social and therefore, cannot be magical.

==Legacy==
While Mauss is known for several of his own worksmost notably his masterpiece &quot;Essai sur le Don&quot; (&#x27;The Gift&#x27;)much of his best work was done in collaboration with members of the &quot;Année Sociologique&quot;, including Durkheim (&quot;Primitive Classification&quot;), Henri Hubert (&quot;Outline of a General Theory of Magic&quot; and &quot;Essay on the Nature and Function of Sacrifice&quot;), Paul Fauconnet (&quot;Sociology&quot;) and others.

Mauss influenced French anthropology and social science. He did not have a great number of students like many other Sociologists did, however, he taught ethnographic method to first generation French anthropology students. In addition to this, Mauss&#x27;s ideas have had a significant impact on Anglophile post-structuralist perspectives in anthropology, cultural studies, and cultural history. He modified post-structuralist and post-Foucauldian intellectuals because he combines an ethnographic approach with contextualization that is historical, sociological, and psychological.

Mauss served as an important link between the sociology of Durkheim and contemporary French sociologists. Some of these sociologists include: Claude Levi Strauss, Pierre Bourdieu, Marcel Granet, and Louis Dumont. The essay on &quot;The Gift&quot; is the origin for anthropological studies of reciprocity. His analysis of the Potlatch has inspired Georges Bataille (&quot;The Accursed Share&quot;), then the situationists (the name of the first situationist journal was &quot;Potlatch&quot;). This term has been used by many interested in gift economies and open-source software, although this latter use sometimes differs from Mauss&#x27;s original formulation. See also Lewis Hyde&#x27;s revolutionary critique of Mauss in &quot;Imagination and the Erotic Life of Property&quot;. He also impacted the Mouvement Anti-Utilitariste dans les Sciences Sociales and David Graeber.

==Critiques==
Mauss&#x27;s views on the nature of gift exchange have had critics. Main critiques against Mauss stem from beliefs that Mauss&#x27;s essay is analyzing all primitive and archaic societies, but rather his essay is used to apply to one society and relationships within. French anthropologist Alain Testart (1998), for example, argues that there are &quot;free&quot; gifts, such as passers-by giving money to beggars, e.g. in a large Western city. Donor and receiver do not know each other and are unlikely ever to meet again. In this context, the donation certainly creates no obligation on the side of the beggar to reciprocate; neither the donor nor the beggar have such an expectation. Testart argues that only the latter can actually be enforced. He feels that Mauss overstated the magnitude of the obligation created by social pressures, particularly in his description of the potlatch amongst North American Indians.

Gift Economy theorist Genevieve Vaughan (1997) criticizes the French school of thought based on Mauss, exemplified by Jacques Godbout and Serge Latouche and the &quot;Mouvement Anti-utilittarisse des Sciences Sociales,&quot; for defining gift-giving as consisting of &quot;three moments: giving, receiving, and giving back. The insistence upon reciprocity hides the communicative character of simple giving and receiving without reciprocity and does not allow this group to make a clear distinction between gift-giving and exchange as two opposing paradigms.&quot; In subsequent works, for example, &quot;The Gift in the Heart of Language: The Maternal Source of Meaning&quot; (2015) Vaughan elaborated on gift-giving as a relation between giver and receiver that takes its form from the primal human experience of mothering and being mothered.

Another example of a non-reciprocal &quot;free&quot; gift is provided by British anthropologist James Laidlaw (2000). He describes the social context of Indian Jain renouncers, a group of itinerant celibate renouncers living an ascetic life of spiritual purification and salvation. The Jainist interpretation of the doctrine of &quot;ahimsa&quot; (an extremely rigorous application of principles of nonviolence) influences the diet of Jain renouncers and compels them to avoid preparing food, as this could potentially involve violence against microscopic organisms. Since Jain renouncers do not work, they rely on food donations from lay families within the Jain community. However, the former must not appear to be having any wants or desires, and only very hesitantly and apologetically receives the food prepared by the latter. &quot;Free&quot; gifts therefore challenge the aspects of the Maussian notion of the gift unless the moral and non-material qualities of gifting are considered. These aspects are, of course, at the heart of the gift, as demonstrated in books such as Annette Weiner&#x27;s (1992) &quot;Inalienable Possessions: The Paradox of Keeping While Giving&quot;.

Mauss&#x27;s view on sacrifice was also controversial at the time. This was because it conflicted with the psychologisation of individuals and social behavior. In addition to this, Mauss&#x27;s terms like persona and habitus have been used among some sociological approaches. French philosopher Georges Bataille used The Gift to draw new conclusions based on economic anthropology, in this case, an interpretation of how money is increasingly being wasted in society. They have also been included in recent sociological and cultural studies by Pierre Bourdieu. Bourdieu used Mauss&#x27;s concept habitus through sociological concepts of socialization the embodiment of consciousness, an example being muscle memory.

<doc id="767323" wikidata="Q223555" url="?curid=767323" title="Shaukat Aziz">
<text>Shaukat Aziz (born 6 March 1949) is a British former banker who served as the 15th prime minister of Pakistan from 28 August 2004 to 15 November 2007. When his term as Prime Minister was over, he immedietly left Pakistan and settled in the United Kingdom. Previously, he served as the finance minister of Pakistan from 6 November 1999 to 27 August 2004.

Aziz was born in Karachi. He graduated from the Institute of Business Administration and later joined the corporate staff of the CitiBank Pakistan in 1969. He initially served as CitiBank financier, and became executive vice-president of Citibank in 1999. 

In 1999, Aziz entered politics on the personal request of Pervez Musharraf and moved to Pakistan from the United States to assume charge of the Finance Ministry as the finance minister. In 2004, Aziz was nominated by the Musharraf as his prime minister after taking resignation from Zafarullah Khan Jamali on 6 June 2004.

== Early life and education ==
Shaukat Aziz was born in Karachi, Pakistan on 6 March 1949. He studied at Saint Patrick&#x27;s School, Karachi and Abbottabad Public School, Abbottabad, Pakistan. His father, S.A. Aziz (sometimes Abdul Aziz) was a radio engineer employed in the state-owned Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) as chief engineer.

The PBC moved his family to Abbottabad, North West Frontier Province where he attended the Abbottabad Public School. Later, the family moved back to Karachi. Aziz matriculated and obtained high-school diploma from Saint Patrick&#x27;s High School and proceeded to Government College now GCU In Lahore where he passed his inter-level and ascended to attend the Gordon College of Rawalpindi, Punjab province in 1965. Aziz obtained a BS degree in Economics in 1967 from Gordan College and moved back to Karachi the same year to enroll in a master&#x27;s programme. Aziz attended the master&#x27;s programme of the Institute of Business Administration (IBA) in Karachi and obtained MBA in business administration in 1969.

== Banking career ==
Initially, Aziz joined the corporate branch of Citibank Pakistan as its credit officer in 1969. During his career, Aziz subsequently served in various countries including Pakistan, Greece, United States, United Kingdom, Malaysia, Philippines, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Singapore.
 After arriving to assume the charge of corporate assignment in the United States, Aziz settled in New York City and took over the office operations of Citibank at the Empire State Building. Aziz acquired permanent residence status, but did not acquire American citizenship, whilst continuing to upgrade his legal status.

In the U.S., Aziz held numerous positions in Citibank across several divisions including Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB), Corporate Planning Officer (CPO), Chief Financial Officer of Citicorp and managing director of Citibank Singapore. He has been a board member of Citibank subsidiaries, including Saudi American Bank, Citicorp Islamic Bank, and of several non-profit organizations. Aziz played a pivotal role in expanding Citibank branches and corporate directive operations throughout the country and was instrumental in bringing multinational banking industries into Pakistan in the 1990s.

At Citibank, Aziz served as the corporate director of Asia Pacific global finance operations and had been notable for financing and managing funds on behalf of Citibank and other financial corporations in global stock markets. He was also involved with Citi Private Bank, a subsidiary of Citigroup. Aziz regarded his career in Citigroup as &quot;extremely helpful&quot; in preparing him for the executive public office, in 2006.

Aziz continued to visit Pakistan, working to expand Citibank&#x27;s financial services and banking, overseeing the wide expansion of Citigroup&#x27;s branches and its influence in Pakistan. In the 1990s, he worked closely with the governments of Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif to help negotiate economic relief packages and aid to Pakistan, while maintaining diverse relations with Pakistan Armed Forces who would also visit the United States as part of Sharif&#x27;s and Benazir Bhutto&#x27;s state visits.

By the 1990s, Aziz had established many notable contacts within the United States administration. In a book, &quot;Global Financial Warrior&quot;, written by John B. Taylor, Aziz had substantial access to the US Treasury, World Bank and many other world financial institutions. Aziz worked closely with the United States in order to finance U.S. war games and operations. Aziz knew the volumes of secretive methods of transferring funds in and out of South Asia, particularly clandestine financing of nuclear weapons programmes of India and Pakistan at its most, Taylor maintained.

== Finance minister ==
Shaukat Aziz had been a president of Citi Private Bank in New York before returning to Pakistan in 1999. Shortly, General Pervez Musharraf arrived for a small personal trip to the United States after staging a coup d&#x27;état to deposed the people-elected prime minister Navaz Sharif on 12 October 1999.

On 26 November 1999, while addressing a gathering of influential lobbyists of the Pakistani American community, a political lobbying sub-body of the Association of Pakistani Physicians of North America (APPNA), Musharraf stated that: &quot;Shaukat Aziz has come to Pakistan with forty other financial experts who have offered free service to revive Pakistan&#x27;s national economy&quot;. After a brief session, Musharraf asked Shaukat Aziz to stand up and introduce himself to the audience.

Aziz reportedly returned with Musharraf in November 1999 and took charge of the Finance ministry as its Finance Minister. Aziz took control of the economy with responsibility for Finance, Economic Affairs, Statistics Division, Planning and Development, and Revenue divisions. As Minister of Finance Aziz also headed the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet, the Cabinet Committee on Investment, the executive committee of the National Economic Council, and the Cabinet Committee on Privatization. As Finance minister, all state-owned mega-corporations came under the government-ownership while restructuring each mega-corporation to set off to privatisation. During his first days, Aziz worked to control the economy in a difficult and hostile environment with then-President Muhammad Rafiq Tarar who called him &quot;an alien&quot;, and many among those who were close to deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto. Other politicians including Fazal-ur-Rehman and Ameen Faheem became hostile towards Aziz and his policies; and harboured grave doubts about him because Aziz was not like a traditional politician in the country, an accredited politician.

Initially there was a decline in the economy, and Aziz attributes this as &quot;state (Pakistan) unpleasant relations with international financial institutions. There was a ~70% decline in the national economy with the loss of $150 million (1999) to $600 million (2000), which constituted 0.21% of foreign direct investment (FDI) global flow. Aziz took initiatives for FDI offering incentives to foreign investors with his macroeconomic policies, taxation framework and a consistent investment policy.
After the 11 September attacks in the United States and Pakistan&#x27;s role in the War on Terror, Aziz travelled to the United States in order to negotiate a relief and U.S. aid to Pakistan. He closely worked with US Secretary of the Treasury on the detail of the devised plan on how to remove the Taliban from Afghanistan, cancellation and debt relief, loans from the World Bank, and direct support from U.S. Aid for national public development. Aziz recommended policies and new plan of economic reforms, including the improved budgetary transparency and spending controls— a plan that was widely accepted by the United States. With the help from United States Department of the Treasury, Aziz thwarted individuals, difficulties and obstacles to achieve success in his economic programmes. In 2002, Aziz worked with U.S. administration to help advise the United States to finance the war in Afghanistan. In the words of John B. Taylor, Aziz suggested that U.S. should call out for a meeting of finance ministers of the G7 member countries, where the illicit funding of money would become a great problem for G7 countries in the future. In April 2002, Aziz chaired a &quot;historical&quot; meeting on behalf of Pakistan and the United States, helping the G7 members to understand how the illicit money was transferred was shared with the finance ministers of G7 members and Pakistan on other side.

In 2001, Aziz implemented and activated the Privatisation Programme (first founded by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 1991) and opened all state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to private sector. This programme undertook the country into rapid economic growth and extreme level of industrialisation the country had for yet seen since 1972. After the 2002 general elections, Aziz intensified his programme and aggressively implemented economic liberalisation policies in the country. Aziz&#x27;s financial policies came under surrounding controversies, creating new problems for Prime minister Zafarullah Khan Jamali to counter who was forced to resign the office in his favour. His affordable real estate scheme encouraged common men to afford a house and a vehicle on low investment. On the other hand, this scheme brought an increased violation of zoning regulations in construction companies. Although, Zafarullah Khan Jamali controlled the inflation at its low level, his deregulation policies of price control caused the oil and sugar prices to skyrocket. His public and liberalisation of economy policy expanded the political role of Supreme Court of Pakistan in a higher level of the government and to target high-level of government corruption independently without government interferences.

Pakistan&#x27;s fiscal performance was praised by IMF and the World Bank. The World Bank further reiterated that Pakistan&#x27;s economic growth bolstered international confidence.

===Assassination attempt===
While campaigning on 30 July 2004, Aziz survived an assassination attempt in the Attock District of Punjab, Pakistan. The suicide bomb attack was staged in Fateh Jang, a small town to the north of the capital, Islamabad, where Aziz was contesting an election. The attempt was made when Aziz was departing after meeting with constituents. A suicide bomber, who was travelling with the Aziz motorcade, detonated the device next to the car in which Aziz was travelling, killing himself and Aziz&#x27;s chauffeur, as well as six others.

Aziz called the incident &quot;tragic,&quot; and said it had claimed the lives of innocent people. He added that it had reinforced his resolve to serve Pakistan and the Islamic world. After safely reaching Islamabad, Aziz instigated a probe, while the foreign office contacted its mission in Egypt to try to determine the veracity of an Al Qaeda claim of responsibility. Ten suspected Al-Qaeda perpetrators were arrested in Egypt and later extradited to Pakistan for the crime.

== Premiership ==
By 2004, Aziz had become a right hand of general Musharraf, as Musharraf described in his memoirs. The strong oligarch business class of Pakistan, notably Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, had been impressed by Shaukat Aziz&#x27;s performance as finance minister. Following the resignation of Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali on 26 June 2004, Hussain nominated Aziz for the office of prime minister and was also a top choice for the candidacy of prime ministerial post by Musharraf.

However, Aziz was not a member of the National Assembly, although he was a Senator. As required by the constitution, the prime minister had to be a member of the National Assembly. Aziz was highly regarded as a &quot;technocrat&quot; and had gained the trust of the establishment, international institutions and public support. His nomination came after another technocrat-economist, Dr. Manmohan Singh, became the prime minister of India and Aziz was widely seen as compatible with his Indian counterpart.

Having been described and labelled as an urban gentlemen and smartly dressed, Aziz was tasked with day-to-day running of the federal government and see that policies were more effectively executed while Musharraf handled the military issues. In Pakistan, it was also said that Musharraf blindly trusted Aziz and sometimes, Musharraf&#x27;s approvals were not needed for the projects that normally required permission. Aziz quietly and more quickly undermined the elements seeking to undermine Musharraf which may have been a factor that Musharraf had blindly trusted Aziz.

The post was held by Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain while Aziz fulfilled the constitutional requirement of securing a seat in the lower house of parliament. Aziz ran from two constituencies, Tharparkar-I in Sindh, and Attock District. Even after the assassination attempt, Aziz continued campaigning and won from both constituencies. Since he could retain only one seat, he immediately vacated his Tharparkar seat, preferring to represent Attock, where he had won by 76,156 votes to 29,497.

===Domestic reforms===

Aziz successfully oversaw the rapid development of the local government system in Pakistan as part of his &quot;Strengthening Decentralisation&quot; program. His domestic initiatives including the decentralisation in the country, and termed the local government system as &quot;more transparent and accountable&quot;. Aziz strengthened the policy formats and area of responsibility of National Reconstruction Bureau (NRB) after appointing Daniyal Aziz in 2005. In 2005, Aziz&#x27;s government installed 6,000 water supply and sanitation filter plants in entire, through the Khushal Pakistan (lit. Prospered Pakistan) programme, a scheme founded by Nawaz Sharif in the 1990s.
As prime minister, Aziz took hard stance against rivals and took a hardline against his political challengers. Aziz thrashed the Alliance for Restoration of Democracy (ARD) led by conservative leader Javed Hashmi who was placed in military prison on treason charges, on a support provided by Aziz. His hardline and tough counter active measures forced Pakistan Peoples Party of Benazir Bhutto and Pakistan Muslim League-N of Nawaz Sharif to concede their defeat and took asylum in United Kingdom.

In 2005, a non-partisan local government elections were decided to be held in entire country, starting first to hold the elections in Karachi, Sindh Province. Subsequently, Aziz supervised and presided the first free and fair local body elections with PML(Q) and its allied parties sweeping the election arena. Controversially, Aziz allocated Rs. 20 million to each district where PML(Q) candidates lost the National Assembly elections in order to secure its voting bank that was lost in 2002. In Sindh and Balochistan Province, Aziz presided the peaceful election held events and personally monitored the success of the local government body programme. Under his first few of years of government, the law and order situation remains under control and prosperity in Balochistan, and presided the completion the first phase of the Gwadar port.

Problems began to mount with nationalist Akbar Bugti, an ally of Nawaz Sharif. Although, Aziz repeatedly and forcefully denied the knowledge of any military action against Bugti and, as prime minister, Aziz never released any information of any military action in Balochistan. However, Aziz appeared on television screens and stated that &quot;Akbar Bugti died in a military operation during the night of August 25—26, 2008&quot;. Aziz was inflicted with the involvement in the killing of Akbar Khan Bugti, although he has denied any involvement in any manner.

In Islamabad alone, Aziz&#x27;s government was forced to take military action, codename &quot;Silence&quot; after chairing a meeting with the President. In 2009, Aziz maintained that his government had tried at every level of extreme to resolve the Lal Masjid issue through talks to save lives. In a television interview, Aziz maintained that &quot;We gave them time to leave the mosque and the Imam-e-Kaaba Abdul Rahman Al-Sudais also came to Pakistan on my request in connection with the issue.&quot;.

One of the widely reported controversy took place in his government was the atomic proliferation scandal of Abdul Qadeer Khan. Aziz remains supportive towards Khan and efficiently took matters of Abdul Qadeer Khan in 2006 from President Musharraf. On 10 September 2006, Aziz sent flowers and personally visited Khan when he was hospitalised and on 12 October 2007, Musharraf made it clear to United States and rest of the world that Khan &quot;won&#x27;t be handed over&quot; at given any circumstances. On a television speech, Aziz paid a huge tribute to Abdul Qadeer Khan and while commenting on last part of his speech, Aziz stressed it:

===Energy policy===


After assuming the office, Aziz announced a controversial &quot;New 25-year energy plan&quot;, aiming to raise Pakistan&#x27;s dependence on imported oil for power generation to 50% by 2030. His government pushed for the renewable energy, and put efforts to establish the solar energy and wind power sector in the country.

Prime Minister Aziz&#x27;s &quot;New 25-year energy plan&quot; remains extremely controversial and met great public criticism by media and energy experts. Energy experts rendered Aziz&#x27;s programme as &quot;bigger disaster&quot; in a view when even oil rich Gulf countries were reducing their share of oil in their power production. Prime Minister Aziz approved the constructional, and approved the developmental work of &quot;CHASNUPP-II&quot; reactor at the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant in Chashma city, Punjab Province of Pakistan. A 325 MW commercial nuclear power plant was built with Chinese assistance at the close vicinity of Chashma nuclear power complex. Aziz termed this project as &quot;milestone&quot; in the history of nuclear technology in Pakistan. In 2007, Aziz approved the constructional development of &quot;KANUPP-II&quot; and the nuclear reprocessing site, the Nuclear Power Fuel Complex in Islamabad. Aziz oversaw to increase the capacity building of the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority, a governmental nuclear safety authority, to meet the safety requirement of nuclear power plants.
In 2007, Aziz further diversified his nuclear energy policy, terming it as &quot;criteria based nuclear technology&quot; while continued financing the nuclear power projects. Aziz presided initial construction of major hydroelectric power plants project in Pakistan, such as approving the Diamer-Bhasha Dam. Its foundation was laid by his successor Yousaf Raza Gillani in 2011. In 2004, Aziz directed the Ministry of Water and Power and Planning Commission to prepare an integrated energy plan for the country. Aziz approved the &quot;Vision 2025&quot; programme&quot; of Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) to produce power through water. The programme was intended to be launched with the help of private sector and private funding through the international megaproject. However all projects were cancelled or either put on hold by the upcoming government of Yousaf Raza Gillani due economic distress, lack of capital and investment and continuing economic declines, leading an increasing circular debt.

===Defence policy===
Aziz oversaw the successful development of the JF-17 Thunder fighter programme in record time, built with the close cooperation with China. In 2007, Aziz stressed that &quot;Pakistan is not an offensive country and our defence doctrine is based on having minimum credible deterrence to maintain peace and stability in the region.&quot;. Aziz also successfully saw the technology transfer and contract development of first combatant frigate, the F-22P &quot;Zulfiquar&quot;. In May 2006, Aziz stressed that: &quot;Pakistan&#x27;s deep military and economic cooperation with China was one not based on &quot;transient interest,&quot; but was &quot;higher than Himalayas, deeper than oceans&quot;.

In August 2006, Aziz visited the People&#x27;s Republic of China, seeking Chinese cooperation in space technology. China expressed interest in helping Pakistan with developing and launching satellites. In a joint statement of Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, Aziz emphasised that: &quot;both countries are determined to elevate their friendship and strategic partnership.&quot;. A contract was signed with China, Aziz authorized the development of the satellite, &quot;Paksat-IR&quot;. Aziz presided over the security, expansion, and modernization of the country&#x27;s nuclear deterrence programme as part of his defence policy. Aziz oversaw the successful development of the &quot;Shaheen-II&quot; missile program and witnessed its first flight at an undisclosed location in April 2006. After witnessing the test, Aziz maintained that: &quot;We will continue to pursue vigorously our security and energy needs from all sources including nuclear.&quot;. On 8 August 2005, Aziz issued directives to tightened the security and control and command of the National Command Authority and ordered strict monitoring of atomic assets and facilities at all levels of command.

In 2004, Aziz stated and clarified Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear policy to the world and India in an interview given to the &quot;Times of India&quot;:

From 2005 and onwards, Aziz&#x27;s government took major steps against atomic proliferation while also making several decisions to increase the capacity of nuclear deterrence and sufficient use of nuclear energy for the civil sector.

===Foreign relations===

On foreign fronts, Aziz closely collaborated with Musharraf while working to develop the geostrategy in the region. Aziz took initiatives to strengthen the relations with the United States, European Union, Russia, India, China, and Saudi Arabia. Under his government, relations with the United States were extremely cordial and friendly. His foreign policy strictly pursued and followed a &quot;Balance Foreign Policy (BFP)&quot; programme with an initial goal to keen to forge robust friendly ties with international community, US and European Union (EU).

Accompanied by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey, Aziz travelled to Iran in 2006, and privately told Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad he must change course regarding its nuclear program, as the current direction was neither in Iran&#x27;s nor the region&#x27;s interest. Aziz urged Ahmadinejad to immediately place a moratorium on uranium enrichment, while on the other hand Erdoğan described the EU-3 proposal, with Russian enhancements, as a very attractive offer for Iran. Both Aziz and Erdoğan condemned Ahmedinejad&#x27;s statements attacking Israel as completely unacceptable and serving no purpose. Aziz&#x27;s tenure saw considerable improvements in relations with Japan. After visiting Japan, Aziz welcomed investment in the manufacturing sector and Pakistani-Japanese joint ventures in steel manufacturing as an excellent symbol of cooperation in expanding steel production between the two countries.

Aziz paid a farewell visit to South Korea to strengthen and enhance relations between the two countries. Aziz cautiously supported South Korea&#x27;s stance while refraining to criticise North Korea. On a three-day state visit, Aziz and his counterpart Lee Hae Chan signed two agreements on cultural exchange and providing human resource management, and improving trade and cultural ties between South Korea and Pakistan. Aziz strongly allied with the United States in the fight against terrorism, and in a meeting with an American journalist, Aziz maintained that: &quot;Pakistan is now ideally positioned to &quot;work with cooperation rather than confrontation as a force for peace, stability, and prosperity..&quot;. During his tenure, relations with the United States strengthened and progressed. In 2006, Aziz quoted: &quot;Pakistan-American relations are based on mutual trust and respect and are long-standing.&quot;. During his repeated visits to the United States, Aziz worked and deliberately approached the U.S. administration on building a strategic partnership with the United States, and made efforts to build a &quot;robust-broad-based strategic relationship.&quot;. Aziz&#x27;s economic, domestic, and internal reforms focused on enriching a longer-term sustainable Pakistan-U.S. relationship and contributed immeasurably to both countries&#x27; joint struggle against extremism.

Relations with Israel were considered important by Aziz&#x27;s government, and supported Musharraf&#x27;s policy on Israel. At foreign fronts, Aziz maintained a &quot;Telephone Policy&quot; on diplomatic engagement with Israel, whilst keeping Saudi Arabia and Turkey in tacit contact. During his tenure, bilateral relations with the United Kingdom were enhanced and reached to a new level after meeting with British prime minister Tony Blair in 2005, and tightened the economic and defence relations with British counterpart Gordon Brown in 2007. Brown thanked Aziz for the successful launching of a $500 million Eurobond, which was oversubscribed four times. After assuming the office of prime minister, Aziz left for China, as his foreign state visit as prime minister in 2004. In 2007, Aziz made his final state visit as prime minister to China to sign a Free Trade Agreement with China, and regarded the country as a &quot;strategic partner&quot; and a &quot;time-tested friend,&quot; whilst China regarded the FTA agreement as &quot;a historic development&quot;. Aziz built closer economic ties with India while alleviating the territorial conflicts. After meeting with Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh, a confident measuring building process was initiated by Aziz.

Aziz pushed his foreign policy to Russia, calling Russia a &quot;global super power&quot;. In 2006, Aziz invited state-run and private-media of Russia where he repeatedly stressed for the need to enhance cooperation between Pakistan and Russia in the fields of education, science and technology, energy, defence and trade and investment. Finally, in 2007, Russian prime minister Mikhail Fradkov paid a three-day-long visit to Pakistan, becoming the first Russian prime minister and leader to visit the country in 38 years. During this trip, Aziz and Fradkov pledged to boost economic ties and signed two co-operation agreements .

=== Economic policy ===
During his tenure, Aziz aggressively promoted the privatisation, deregulation and economic liberalisation programme and open the large heavy mechanical industries, petroleum companies, electropetroleum and chemical enterprises and state-owned corporations to private sectors. His tenure as finance minister and prime minister, the agriculture production and construction well increased, whilst aggressively and forcefully implementing his policies to liberalise the trade, and eliminated the non-tariff barriers. Under his regime, the maximum bound tariffs were brought down to high as 300% to 25% whilst the applied tariff averages falls in the range of 5% to 10%.

The GDP growth which was at 3.9% in October 1999, stood between 6.6%—9% and successfully privatised all state-owned corporations and state enterprises before completing his term. However, Aziz&#x27;s strategy failed deal with underlying problems deeply in country&#x27;s economy. The Great Recession led to a sharp drop in the country&#x27;s economy while an acute electricity shortage in the country revealed the incompetence by the Peoples Party&#x27;s government, but also the failure of his government to develop the necessary energy infrastructure on time.

Political economists, however, gave other side of story by arguing that his policies were not aimed at alleviating poverty as he seldom offered relief to the poor sections of the society. Shaukat Aziz is roundly criticized for his policy of downsizing in the public sector and disintegrating the effects of nationalisation policies of Benazir Bhutto as early as the 1990s but Aziz defended as he points out that his policies made these institutions viable while they were on the verge of collapse. S. Akbar Zaidi argues that his policies mastered Pakistan&#x27;s economy but such indicators are misleading and unsustainable because his policies do not examine or explain the particular, perplexing economy of Pakistan.

==== Privitization ====
An unsuccessful attempt to privatise the Pakistan Steel Mills was also thwarted by trade unions and pro-nationalization elements who took the case to Supreme Court of Pakistan in 2006. But Aziz said that his privatisation program produced &quot;the second fastest growing economy in the world.&quot;

== Public image ==
A banker and financier by training and extensive experience in the United States, Aziz&#x27;s credentials are extremely high and considered one of the successful finance minister of Pakistan. His credential records are similar to those of the successful US treasury secretaries such as Bob Rubin and Nicholas F. Brady who did well under Clinton and Reagan administrations. He understands the role of banking, finance, investment and consumer credit in economic growth of a nation. Aziz presided the strong banking sector, unprecedented investment and growth finance sectors in Pakistan to underpin its economy. He strengthened capital availability, an essential and increasingly important economic input, in addition to labour and land improvements. With higher education budget up 15-fold and overall education spending up 36% in two years, he focused on education to improve the availability of skilled labour to fill new jobs.

Aziz aggressively pushed land development and public and private construction spending to improve infrastructure and facilities to attract greater business investment. The international communities regarded Aziz as a reformer, with Pakistan&#x27;s structural reforms ranking high amongst emerging economies. Aziz co-chaired the Secretary-General&#x27;s High Level Panel on the United Nations System-wide Coherence in the areas of development, humanitarian assistance and the environment. Aziz oversaw the success of the privatisation programme in Pakistan and most of the proceeds so far have come from the telecom and banking sectors, around 80% of Pakistan&#x27;s banking sector was put under the private hands.

The BBC noted that the privatisation programme, initiated by Nawaz Sharif in 1990, picked up from a jog to a sprint under watchful eyes of Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz. The prime minister is considered the chief architect of privatisation and is widely respected among foreign investors. In an interview with BBC, Aziz mentioned Pakistan&#x27;s economic growth as he puts it:

In 2008, Aziz participated in the Global Creative Leadership Summit, organised by the Louise Blouin Foundation. As a delegate, he delivered a keynote speech for the panel entitled &quot;Economic Crisis, Economics of Change: Credit, Commodities, and Trade.&quot;

== Post-premiership ==
Shaukat Aziz currently resides in West London, United Kingdom. He serves on a number of boards and advisory boards including Millennium &amp; Copthorne Hotels plc. and The Blackstone Group. According to Aziz, he has maintained good relations with several members of his government and the members of the Parliament including his former foreign minister Khurshid Kasuri and the former railways minister Sheikh Rasheed and his party president Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain. In the midst of 2009, the polls performed by various news agencies, Aziz&#x27;s approval rating ranged from 30.7%, but ratings dramatically fell down to 17.3% in the end of 2009. In 2012, in polls managed by various news surveys, Aziz&#x27;s popularity approval ratings ranged at 20.5%. Aziz remained active in political arena of the country and has vigorously defended his financial policies. Aziz criticised the care-taker government of Muhammad Mian Soomro for the economic collapse, and predicted that, &quot;the next elections will sweep, paving the way for a two-party system to emerge with the Pakistan Muslim League in the government and the Peoples Party in the opposition&quot;.

He remains active on economic issues and harshly criticised the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for failing to show leadership during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. While attending the international business conference at Philippines, Aziz maintained that: &quot;This global institution (IMF) which is supposed to look at everything going on was not even in the room where meetings are going on&quot;.

=== Legal case ===
On 30 October 2011, Aziz directed a letter sent from Dubai to the Provincial Police Office to Balochistan High Court stating &quot;he had been mentioned in the FIR registered at the Dera Bugti Police Station on 13 October 2009, which alleged that then president Pervez Musharraf used him as part of Akbar Bugti case in which the latter committed suicide during a military operation.&quot;. Aziz maintained that he was informed of &quot;unfortunate event&quot; through the televised media. Aziz later stated in television that Akbar Bugti died in a military operation during the night of 25/26 August 2008.

== Wealth ==
On 5 November 2017, Aziz appeared on the Paradise Papers leaks. The leaks claimed that he was linked with the Antarctic Trust, which was set up by Aziz himself. This trust was neither declared by him as prime minister nor as finance minister. Aziz, a former Citibank executive, told the ICIJ he had set the trust up for estate planning purposes and that the funds had come from his employment at Citibank. An internal Appleby document raised concerns about warrants issued for him in connection with the killing of a local leader. Aziz dismissed both the murder charge and the allegations of financial impropriety.

<text>Albert Marius Soboul (27 April 1914 – 11 September 1982) was a historian of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods. A professor at the Sorbonne, he was chair of the History of the French Revolution and author of numerous influential works of history and historical interpretation. In his lifetime, he was internationally recognized as the foremost French authority on the Revolutionary era.

== Early life ==
Soboul was born in Ammi Moussa, French Algeria, in the spring of 1914. His father, a textile worker, died later that same year at the front in World War I. He and his older sister Gisèle grew up first in a rural community in Ardèche in southern France before moving with their mother back to Algeria. When she too died in 1922, the children were sent to be raised by their aunt Marie in Nîmes.

=== Education ===
The children&#x27;s aunt was a primary school teacher and under her care Soboul blossomed in his education at the lycée of Nîmes (1924–1931). He was uniquely inspired by the educator Jean Morini-Comby, who was himself a published historian of the Revolution. Soboul excelled in his studies and developed a lifelong passion for history and philosophy.

After Nîmes, Soboul studied for a year at the university of Montpellier, then transferred to the Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris. He published his first work of history, an examination of the ideas of the revolutionary leader Saint-Just, originally attributed to a pseudonym, Pierre Derocles. Soboul completed his in history and geography in 1938.

== Career ==
Called up for military service that same year, Soboul served in the horse-drawn artillery before being demobilized in 1940. He had already become a member of the French Communist Party and remained committed to them under the German occupation. He received a teaching position at the lycée of Montpellier, but he was dismissed by the Vichy regime in 1942 for supporting Resistance activities. Soboul spent the rest of the war years doing historical research under the direction of Georges Henri Rivière for the Musée national des Arts et Traditions Populaires in Paris.

After the war&#x27;s end, Soboul returned again to Montpellier to teach, then moved to the Lycée Marcelin Berthelot and finally the Lycée Henri-IV. He became a close friend of the eminent historian Georges Lefebvre and under his direction wrote his 1,100-page doctoral dissertation on the revolutionary sans-culottes, &quot;The Parisian Sans-culottes in the Year II&quot;. Soboul was later promoted to the University of Clermont-Ferrand. After a decade as a combative academic presence and prolific author, he was made Chair of the History of the French Revolution at the Sorbonne in 1967. He served also as editor of the &quot;Annales historiques de la Rèvolution française&quot; and lectured frequently throughout the world, acquiring a reputation as &quot;the leading French authority on the Revolution&quot;.

In his writings, Soboul promulgated the concept of overarching class struggle as the basis of the Revolution. He carried forward many of the central viewpoints of earlier historians like François Victor Alphonse Aulard and Albert Mathiez and his extensive body of work is characterized by a clear, unfettered writing style and deeply detailed research. He always rejected labels of his work as Marxist or communist, describing himself as &quot;part of the &#x27;classical&#x27; and &#x27;scientific&#x27; school of historiography represented by Tocqueville, Jaurès and Lefebvre&quot;. Nonetheless, Soboul remains considered a principal architect of the Marxist school of historical analysis.

Soboul propounded the Marxist interpretation arguing the Reign of Terror was a necessary response to outside threats (in terms of other countries going to war with France) and internal threats (of traitors inside France threatening to frustrate the Revolution). In this interpretation, Maximilien Robespierre and the sans-culottes were justified for defending the Revolution from its enemies. Soboul&#x27;s position and the entire Marxist model of the French Revolution have come under intense criticism since the 1990s. François Furet and his followers have rejected Soboul and argued that foreign threats had little to do with the Terror. Instead, the extreme violence was an inherent part of the intense ideological commitment of the revolutionaries—it was inevitable and necessary for them to achieve their utopian goals to kill off their opponents. Still others like Paul Hanson take a middle position, recognising the importance of the foreign enemies and viewing the Terror as a contingency that was caused by it the interaction of a series of complex events and the foreign threat. Hanson says the Terror was not inherent in the ideology of the Revolution, but that circumstances made it necessary.

Soboul emphasized the importance of the sans-culottes as a social class, a sort of proto-proletariat that played a central role. That view has been sharply attacked as well by scholars who say the sans-culottes were not a class at all. Indeed, as one historian points out, Soboul&#x27;s concept of the sans-culottes has not been used by scholars in any other period of French history.

== Legacy ==
Soboul died in Nîmes on the estate of his late aunt Marie. The French Communist Party gave him a lavish burial ceremony at the Père Lachaise Cemetery, near the graves of prominent party leaders and the Communards&#x27; Wall, where the last Communards were shot in May 1871. A biography, &quot;Un historien en son temps: Albert Soboul (1914–1982)&quot; by Claude Mazauric, was published in France in 2004. Toward the end of his life, Soboul&#x27;s interpretations faced increasing opposition by new historians of the revisionist school, but his work is still regarded as a major contribution to the study of history from below.

His collection of books on the Revolution was bequeathed to the Musée de la Révolution française.

<text>An apochromat, or apochromatic lens (apo), is a photographic or other lens that has better correction of chromatic and spherical aberration than the much more common achromat lenses.

The prefix &quot;apo-&quot; comes from the Greek preposition &quot;ἀπό-&quot;, meaning free from or away from.

==Explanation==
Chromatic aberration is the phenomenon of different colors focusing at different distances from a lens. In photography, chromatic aberration produces soft overall images, and color fringing at high-contrast edges, like an edge between black and white. Astronomers face similar problems, particularly with telescopes that use lenses rather than mirrors. &quot;Achromatic&quot; lenses are corrected to bring &quot;two&quot; wavelengths into focus in the same plane – typically red (~0.590 μm) and blue (~0.495 μm). &quot;Apo&quot;chromatic lenses are designed to bring &quot;three&quot; colors into focus in the same plane – typically red (~0.620 μm), green (~0.530 μm), and blue (~0.465 μm). The residual color error (secondary spectrum) can be up to an order of magnitude less than for an achromatic lens of equivalent aperture and focal length. Apochromats are also corrected for spherical aberration at two wavelengths, rather than one as in an achromat.

Telescope objective lenses for wide-band digital imaging in astronomy must have apochromatic correction, as the optical sensitivity of typical CCD imaging arrays can extend from the ultraviolet through the visible spectrum and into the near infrared wavelength range. Apochromatic lenses for astrophotography in the 60–150 mm aperture range have been developed and marketed by several firms, with focal ratios ranging from to 7. Focused and guided properly during the exposure, these apochromatic objectives are capable of producing the sharpest wide-field astrophotographs optically possible for the given aperture sizes.

Graphic arts process (copy) cameras generally use apochromatic lenses for sharpest possible imagery as well. Classically designed apochromatic process camera lenses generally have a maximum aperture limited to about 9. More recently, higher-speed apochromatic lenses have been produced for medium format, digital and 35 mm cameras.
Apochromatic designs require optical glasses with special dispersive properties to achieve three color crossings. This is usually achieved using costly fluoro-crown glasses, abnormal flint glasses, and even optically transparent liquids with highly unusual dispersive properties in the thin spaces between glass elements. The temperature dependence of glass and liquid index of refraction and dispersion must be accounted for during apochromat design to assure good optical performance over reasonable temperature ranges with only slight re-focusing. In some cases, apochromatic designs without anomalous dispersion glasses are possible.

==Use in photography==
Independent tests can be used to demonstrate that the &quot;APO&quot; designation is used rather loosely by some photographic lens manufacturers to describe the color accuracy of their lenses, as comparable lenses have shown superior color accuracy even though they did not carry the &quot;APO&quot; designation.

Also, when considering lens design, the &quot;APO&quot; designation is used more conservatively in astronomy-related optics (e.g. telescopes) and microscopy than in photography. For example, telescopes that are marked &quot;APO&quot; are specialized, fixed focal length lenses that are optimised for infinity-like distances whereas in photography, even certain relatively low-priced general-purpose zoom lenses are given the APO designation.

Often, however, apochromatic lenses used in fine cameras are not termed apochromats, Instead, they may be simply called &quot;fluorite lenses&quot;, based on the material with anomalous partial dispersion which allowed them to be apochromatic. Such lenses began to be available to photographers in 1969, with the Canon FL-F 300mm f/5.6 telephoto lens. Fluorite has some drawbacks, for example vulnerability to sudden changes in temperature, and thus attempts were made to use substitutes, such as fluorophosphate glasses, which ameliorate, but do not completely eliminate (as compared with ordinary glass) these drawbacks.

<text>WGBA-TV (channel 26) is a television station in Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States, affiliated with NBC. It is owned by the E.W. Scripps Company alongside Appleton-licensed independent station WACY-TV (channel 32). The two stations share studios on North Road near the WIS 172 freeway in Ashwaubenon (with a Green Bay postal address); WGBA-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located in the unincorporated community of Shirley, east of De Pere, Wisconsin.

WGBA-TV operates a Class A translator station in Door County, WLWK-CD (channel 22), licensed to Sturgeon Bay, which transmits from a site north of Sturgeon Bay on Door County Trunk Highway HH.

==History==
===Early years===
WLRE, which stood for station co-founder Lyle R. Evans, sought to be operational as early as December 1977. It delayed so that it could put its transmission tower on Scray Hill near De Pere, the location of other Green Bay market transmitter towers. Ultimately the location was approved, but it meant ground was not broken on the studio and antenna location until June 1980. The station signed on the air on December 31, 1980, broadcasting an analog signal on UHF channel 26. It was the Green Bay market&#x27;s second independent station, after the short-lived KFIZ-TV (channel 34) in Fond du Lac from 1968 to 1972. It was also the first new commercial station to sign-on in Green Bay itself since WFRV-TV (channel 5) signed on in May 1955. On November 12, 1982, WLRE was able to power up a new transmitter and had plans for further antenna power boosts.

In early 1983, coinciding with the purchase of a licensing deal of approximately 1,000 movies and other syndicated programs, WLRE took on the tagline &quot;The Great Entertainer&quot;. In late 1984, the station&#x27;s partnership was dissolved in a bankruptcy court in which investors lost money. In 1985, it was bought by Family Group Broadcasting Incorporated for only pennies on the dollar. On October 3 of that year, the station&#x27;s call letters were changed to WGBA-TV. The station, then known on-air as &quot;TV 26&quot;, was well known in its early years for children&#x27;s program host &quot;Cuddles the Clown&quot;, who stayed with the station until it switched to NBC, and moved to sister station WACY-TV (channel 32) before retiring. The station&#x27;s imaging was also shared with sister station WQRF-TV in Rockford, Illinois; WVFT-TV in Roanoke, Virginia; WPGX-TV in Panama City, Florida; WFGX-TV in Fort Walton Beach, Florida; and WLAX-TV in La Crosse, Wisconsin, including its early &#x27;diamond&#x27; logo.

In the wake of a bankruptcy, Green Bay&#x27;s original Fox affiliate WXGZ (channel 32) went dark on February 14, 1992. WGBA became the new affiliate the following day, changing its branding to &quot;Fox 26&quot;. After Ace TV acquired the WXGZ license, WGBA helped to relaunch the station through a local marketing agreement in June 1994. That station became a charter affiliate of UPN and changed its call letters to WACY-TV in 1995. In 1994, during the first year of Fox&#x27;s contract to broadcast NFL games, the station entered into a contract with ABC affiliate WBAY-TV (channel 2) to produce a pregame show to air before Green Bay Packers games since it lacked a local sports department. With Fox gaining rights to air NFC games, channel 26 became the Packers&#x27; unofficial home station (a role it would only hold for one season; since their switch to NBC, the station aired any Packer games from 1995 to 1997 when the team hosted an AFC team at Lambeau Field, and since 2006, all &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot; games; it also was the station Super Bowl XXXII aired in the market).

===NBC affiliation===

In 1994, WLUK-TV (channel 11) and three other stations owned by Burnham Broadcasting were sold to SF Broadcasting (owned as a partnership between Savoy Communications and Fox). As part of the purchase and through Fox&#x27;s ownership of the group, SF signed a group affiliation deal to switch its stations to Fox; this enabled WLUK to become the Packers&#x27; unofficial &quot;home&quot; station as Fox had acquired the television contract to the NFL&#x27;s National Football Conference. Almost by default, WGBA was then left to take the NBC affiliation. On August 28, 1995, WGBA-TV switched its affiliation to NBC (and changed its on-air branding to &quot;NBC 26&quot;); the Fox affiliation moved to former NBC affiliate WLUK. As an NBC affiliate, it struggled to find a constant identity. Green Bay&#x27;s other three stations have been on-the-air since the 1950s and had loyal audiences. Relief did not come until October 2004, when the Journal Broadcast Group bought it for $43.2 million after Aries Telecommunications sold the station. Journal had long wanted a station in Northeastern Wisconsin alongside its flagship station, WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee, that market&#x27;s NBC affiliate and long-dominant news station.

The purchase also included the LMA with WACY. Although Journal wanted to buy WACY outright, this had been unlikely since Green Bay has only seven full-power stations (not enough to legally permit a duopoly). However, in September 2010, WLUK owner LIN TV Corporation exercised an option to purchase CW affiliate WCWF (channel 14) from ACME Communications, and filed for a &quot;failing station waiver&quot; – which permits duopoly in such situations if the petitioner can prove the station is in an economically non-viable position – to allow LIN to own WLUK and WCWF. Because WCWF was hampered for years by several factors, including insufficient cable carriage and an analog signal originating more towards its city of license, Suring, than Green Bay, the waiver was granted in February 2011. Journal eventually pleaded for the failing station waiver for WACY at the beginning of 2012, citing that station&#x27;s dark period between 1992 and 1994 (when the Ace TV LMA began) and that the station was unable to survive on its own without the production and control assistance of WGBA. Because of this, the FCC allowed the full sale of WACY to Journal at the beginning of September 2012.

Since being acquired by Journal, WGBA and WTMJ have become close sister stations, eventually synchronizing their news imaging and sharing news and sports resources (WTMJ had previously paired with WFRV-TV, an NBC affiliate until the early 1980s, to provide Green Bay coverage and video). This became more evident in 2008, when WGBA outsourced sports and weekend weather reports to WTMJ, and had simulcast that station&#x27;s morning and noon newscasts for a short time.

====Summer 2013 Time Warner Cable carriage dispute====
After several extensions of the original June 30, 2013, expired agreement, and the invocation of the sweeps rule disallowing cable providers from pulling the main signal of a carried station during local sweeps periods (which includes July), the main signals of WGBA and WACY were pulled off Time Warner Cable systems in the market at midnight on July 25, 2013. The MeTV subchannel had been pulled earlier on July 10 as those were not under the same protection under the sweeps rule. WTMJ was also affected in the Milwaukee market, along with Journal stations in Omaha and Palm Springs, California. The main effect of the blackout on Time Warner Cable systems was the carriage of three Packers preseason games on WTMJ and WGBA, which were blacked out on the provider due to the dispute, though the games were still available via the Spanish language simulcast using the Packers Television network camera positions produced for Milwaukee&#x27;s Telemundo affiliate WYTU-LD (channel 63/49.4), which is carried on the subchannel tier in the Green Bay market (and was simulcast on WACY), with the suggestion to listen to English play-by-play via either WTMJ radio from Milwaukee or the local FM stations in Green Bay or Appleton carrying Packers Radio Network coverage. The later replays of the games were also available via replays on NFL Network through the week.

A class action lawsuit was also filed by viewers against Time Warner Cable on August 8 under grounds of breach of contract. Journal Broadcast Group has also made claims via its website detailing their version of the carriage dispute that TWC was distracted due to the other dispute involving CBS Corporation&#x27;s Television Stations group and Showtime Networks premium channel suites.

By August 15, WGBA and WACY&#x27;s channel slots on Time Warner Cable were replaced with a simulcast of GSN, with Starz Kids &amp; Family airing on the channel 994 subchannel slot usually carrying MeTV. Journal Broadcast Group also asked state authorities to intervene in their dispute with Time Warner Cable.

Journal and Time Warner Cable came to an agreement for carriage on September 20, 2013, to last at least through the 2016 Summer Olympics, returning WGBA and WACY to their lineups as of 7 p.m. that evening. However, Journal conceded that the analog and cable-ready positions were less important than carriage in the high definition tier, so while WGBA&#x27;s high definition signal remained on channel 1007, the standard definition signal moved to channel 13, WACY&#x27;s former SD slot, with WACY shifting to channel 83 with high definition coverage coming at the start of the year. However, MeTV subchannel 26.2 remained removed from Time Warner systems, though southern portions of the Green Bay market already receive MeTV Milwaukee flagship WBME-CD (channel 41) on the basic lifeline tier.

====Sale to the E. W. Scripps Company====
On July 30, 2014, the E. W. Scripps Company announced that it would acquire Journal Communications in an all-stock transaction. The combined firm would retain their broadcast properties, including WTMJ-TV and its radio siblings, with the print assets being spun off as Journal Media Group. The deal was approved by the FCC on December 12, 2014, with shareholders of the two companies approving it on March 11, 2015; the merger/spin-off between Journal and Scripps formally closed on April 1.

Scripps and Time Warner Cable announced a new multi-year carriage agreement on February 1, 2016, that includes WGBA and WACY, well ahead of the 2016 Summer Olympics and averting any carriage issues for the Games. This also returned all the subchannels of WGBA to Time Warner systems in the area on channels 990 and 991, which occurred on April 4, 2016.

==Programming==
===Packers partnership===
On March 2, 2012, the Green Bay Packers and Journal announced that WTMJ would be retained as the &quot;Official Packers Station&quot; in the Milwaukee market after the expiration of the previous agreement, and that WGBA would become the official station for the team in the Green Bay market beginning in August 2012, replacing former partner WFRV-TV. As a result, WGBA carries the majority of the team&#x27;s preseason schedule (the game broadcasts use CBS Sports announcers, with the &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot; graphics package) along with &quot;Packers Live&quot; Tuesday nights and &quot;Total Packers with Matt LaFleur&quot; on Wednesday evenings before prime time, and the &quot;Inside Lambeau&quot; program on Sunday nights, along with other official team programming; the station also provides gametime and &#x27;ride home&#x27; forecasts for the &quot;TundraVision&quot; scoreboard displays at Lambeau Field during Packers home games. The first preseason game of 2012 was a national ESPN game against the San Diego Chargers on August 9 and aired on WBAY-TV, precluding a situation where NBC&#x27;s non-preemptable coverage of the Summer Olympics would have forced WGBA to move that game to WACY instead (that situation also occurred four years later due to the 2016 Summer Olympics for two games). In addition, the station also held the rights to the September 13 &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; game of the Packers–Bears rivalry broadcast on cable/satellite on NFL Network, a network unavailable to much of the Green Bay market at the time due to conflicts with Time Warner Cable (three weeks later Time Warner added the network to its systems); this unusually forced the season seven finale of &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; to air the same night over WACY (the station&#x27;s first move of NBC programming to that station in a pre-emption situation), and re-air after &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on September 15 on WGBA due to the preemption. As an NBC affiliate, WGBA broadcasts Packers games that are played on &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;. For the 2016 and 2017 seasons, the station also aired Packers appearances on NBC&#x27;s portion of the &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; contract, along with the November 17, 2022, Packers game against the Tennessee Titans on Amazon Prime Video. It also carried the team&#x27;s first London appearance in the NFL International Series on October 9 against the New York Giants at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

Larry McCarren, who had been the sports director at WFRV until the Packers contract ended in March 2012, along with budget cuts at that station, went over to Journal in July 2012; however he was only able to do short Packer analysis segments through the 2012 season on-air for WTMJ and WGBA, along with blogging on WTMJ&#x27;s site, due to a one-year non-compete clause (which included these segments by contractual force originating outside the Green Bay market in Milwaukee), but continued his duties as color commentator over Journal&#x27;s Packers Radio Network. With the expiration of the clause, McCarren assumed sports director duties for WGBA on April 1, 2013. &quot;Packers Live&quot;, a program that resembles his former &quot;Locker Room&quot; program, with Packer player guests and &quot;chalk talk&quot; play analysis in front of a live audience, also began airing on the station beginning with the 2013 NFL season. He retired as WGBA sports director in April 2015 to fully focus on his television and radio network duties for the Packers and Scripps (as of the fall 2018 purchase of Scripps&#x27; Milwaukee radio stations by Good Karma Brands, his radio duties are now with that group).

===News operation===

WGBA-TV broadcasts hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays). In addition to its main studios, the station operates a Fox Cities Bureau in Downtown Appleton on West College Avenue. WGBA operates its own weather radar from the North Road studios. In addition to local insertions during &quot;Today&quot;, WGBA also carries news and weather updates during the noon hour weekdays during &quot;NBC News Daily&quot; at around 20 and 50 minutes past the hour.

In early 1996, shortly after WGBA picked up the NBC affiliation, then-owner Aries Telecommunications announced plans to start a full-fledged news department for the station. On July 19, 1996, during the start of NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 1996 Summer Olympics, WGBA debuted its local newscasts, with a half-hour early-evening newscast at 6 p.m. on Mondays through Saturdays (the initial broadcast of that program on July 19 ran a special one-hour broadcast, leading into NBC&#x27;s coverage of the Olympic Opening Ceremonies in Atlanta) and a late evening newscast at 10 p.m. seven nights a week. Ted O&#x27;Connell was WGBA&#x27;s first news director; he was succeeded by Ashley Webster (now a journalist with Fox Business Network), who also served as weeknight co-anchor alongside Heather Hays (presently a main anchor at Fox owned-and-operated station KDFW in Dallas-Fort Worth). Eventually as the operation grew, the station added newscasts on weekday mornings, weekdays at noon and at 5 p.m.

WGBA&#x27;s newscasts have consistently rated fourth in the market, behind WBAY, WLUK and WFRV. Ratings were unable to improve after the Journal purchase, even with the ties to WTMJ&#x27;s news department, which had issues in itself in the Milwaukee market. The Great Recession in particular starkly brought these issues on-air. On June 3, 2008, Journal announced that WGBA&#x27;s sports department would shut down and that it would be laying off sports anchors Ted Stefaniak and John Burton. Until Larry McCarren took over as sports director in April 2013, sports segments were taped in advance and originated from WTMJ&#x27;s facilities (on East Capitol Drive/WIS 190 in Milwaukee&#x27;s Far North Side section) using its personnel.

On July 14, 2008, due to low ratings and inconsistent viewership, WGBA discontinued its weekday morning and noon newscasts, while laying off some of its staff. In place of those shows, the station began simulcasting WTMJ&#x27;s morning and midday newscasts &quot;Live at Daybreak&quot; (now known as &quot;TMJ4 News Today&quot;) and &quot;Live at Noon&quot;, interspersed with local weather cut-ins presented by a meteorologist from WGBA&#x27;s Green Bay studios (again, recorded in advance since WTMJ was already live in its own market), but with no regard to coverage of Fox Valley and Green Bay news. Due to the latter issue, in January 2009, the weekday morning simulcast was dropped and turned into a WGBA-produced rolling weather block called &quot;Non-Stop Weather&quot;. WTMJ&#x27;s weekday noon broadcast was later moved to WACY and replaced in that timeslot on WGBA by paid programming, which for a time in 2008, filled some of the station&#x27;s early afternoon schedule due to an unusual number of syndicated program cancellations in that year. The midday news simulcast on WACY and paid programming on WGBA were eventually dropped as well.

On April 7, 2009, WTMJ became the first station in Milwaukee to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. However, until April 2012, the pre-taped nightly sports and weekend weather segments originating from WTMJ were broadcast in 4:3 standard definition. On July 24, it was announced that WGBA would eliminate some of its reporting and photojournalist positions, with the remaining staff being retrained to act as &quot;one-man band&quot; videojournalists handling reporting, camera work, and editing stories themselves. In September 2009, reporter Bonnie Kirschman, the final employee to remain with WGBA&#x27;s news operation since its 1996 launch, left the station.

In mid-August 2009, the weekday morning weather block was canceled entirely and replaced by the now-canceled syndicated lifestyle talk show &quot;Better&quot;, which moved to the 5 a.m. hour followed by encore broadcasts of the previous night&#x27;s 10 p.m. newscast and &quot;Early Today&quot; before &quot;Today&quot;. On January 10, 2011, WGBA restored a weekday morning newscast to its schedule under the slightly revised title of &quot;NBC 26 News Today&quot; from a new secondary set exclusively used for the program. In August 2012, the Valley news bureau, which had been in operation since July 1996, was shut down.

On April 7, 2012, WGBA upgraded its local newscasts to 16:9 widescreen standard definition. It became the last station in the market to convert to full high-definition operations on January 23, 2016, with the unveiling of a new chyron-heavy &quot;virtual&quot; set, the first major change to the station&#x27;s newsroom and set since the station began carrying newscasts in 1996 and the newsroom and anchor sets were split off in the early 2000s via an opaque partition. The station began to use the default Scripps graphics package/news music package in October 2016.

In October 2014, the station added &quot;Wisconsin Tonight&quot;, a pre-prime time newsmagazine to nights without Packers team programming which features news rundowns, feature segments and various NBC affiliate service reports, along with some shared content from WTMJ, which also carried their own edition of &quot;Wisconsin Tonight&quot;; this averted a situation where &quot;Inside Edition&quot;, which was moved to an earlier timeslot, might only air up to two of their five programs a week on the station in the fall and early winter. That show moved to WBAY in the fall of 2015. Starting with the 2016 Summer Olympics, the station launched Scripps&#x27; national programs &quot;The List&quot; and &quot;Right This Minute&quot; in the 4 p.m. timeslot. In June 2017, &quot;Wisconsin Tonight&quot; was retitled &quot;The Now Wisconsin&quot;, in line with Scripps&#x27; branding for their feature-heavy local newscast format which WTMJ also took up; the &quot;Wisconsin Tonight&quot; title remained in use for a Saturday night advertorial program, presumably to prevent trademark dilution where another state station can claim the title for their program; it has intermittently aired since September 2017.

On June 15, 2020, WGBA began producing a 9 p.m. newscast for WACY entitled &quot;My News at 9&quot;, the first time WLUK-TV&#x27;s 9 p.m. news has had competition; the latter half hour is filled with a same-night replay of &quot;NBC26 Tonight&quot;, the station&#x27;s local version of Scripps&#x27; national program &quot;The Now&quot; (it is unknown if WGBA&#x27;s Packers Television Network programming will repeat in the fall in that timeslot).

====National attention on the Internet====
In 2012, two segments from WGBA&#x27;s morning newscasts gained notice on the Internet. In January of that year, a video showing meteorologist Brian Niznansky falling victim to an on-air prank went viral in which Niznansky was tricked into saying, &quot;I love lamp,&quot; a line from the film &quot;&quot;. By October 2012, the video was viewed nearly two million times on YouTube. The prank was featured on several news sites, including on the front page of MSN at one point.

In September 2012, on the day following the controversial NFL game between the Green Bay Packers and Seattle Seahawks, the station did a segment on its morning newscast with a &quot;replacement weather guy&quot;, poking fun at the NFL replacement referees. WGBA floor director Tom Legener was seen on-air forecasting a &quot;thunderblizzard hurricane&quot;, with a temperature of &quot;-200 degrees&quot; at 7 a.m. and &quot;346 degrees&quot; at noon. The video went viral, and by October 2012, had nearly 600,000 views on YouTube. It was featured on various news sites, including CNN, ESPN, Yahoo!, and MSN.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

WGBA launched a new second digital subchannel in November 2010 carrying TheCoolTV which had aired on the WTMJ&#x27;s second subchannel since the summer of 2009. The establishment of WGBA-DT2 made it the second commercial station in the market to launch a subchannel service after WBAY-TV. On September 7, 2011, Journal and Weigel Broadcasting announced that WGBA would carry MeTV beginning on October 1, 2011. MeTV replaced TheCoolTV on 26.2 on that date, as Journal brought a lawsuit against TheCoolTV&#x27;s parent company Cool Music Network, LLC for non-payment of services; WTMJ-TV, along with Journal&#x27;s other stations dropped the network on October 1, 2011, to carry Live Well Network or MeTV, depending on the market. Sometime in the summer of 2016, 26.2 was converted to a widescreen presentation in line with Weigel converting their networks to that format.

On May 18, 2015, Scripps and Katz Broadcasting announced an affiliation agreement allowing Scripps&#x27; Green Bay duopoly to carry all three of Katz&#x27;s digital broadcast networks in the near future, with WGBA carrying Laff and WACY carrying Escape and Grit (Laff launched one month earlier in markets with Scripps-owned stations not affected by its merger with the Journal Broadcasting Group, while the two others will also begin to be carried by select sister stations of WGBA through the deal). Laff debuted as a digital subchannel on August 12, 2015.

In late April 2019, WGBA was revealed as launching a fourth digital subchannel for Katz&#x27;s relaunch of Court TV on May 8, 2019. At the end of October 2021, the station picked up Ion Television (formerly a WBAY subchannel since 2015), which had come under common Scripps ownership in January 2021. In December 2021, a minor switch of subchannels occurred, with WGBA-DT3 becoming the new home of Grit, and WACY-DT2 taking Laff.

The station ended its MeTV affiliation on October 1, 2022, due to corporate mandates involving Scripps preferring their networks be carried on their stations, with Defy TV replacing it and two subchannels for the QVC networks added on the same day. MeTV&#x27;s owner Weigel Broadcasting has since launched a new Shawano-licensed station on channel 31, WMEI, on June 23, 2024, with MeTV, in addition to subchannels carrying MeTV+, MeTV Toons, Story Television and Movies!.

On July 1, 2024, subchannel 2 was switched without notice from Defy TV to ION plus.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WGBA-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 26, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 41, using virtual channel 26.

One week after the transition, Journal chose to suffix all of their owned television stations with the &quot;-TV&quot; suffix as part of the FCC&#x27;s one-time allowance during the transition to allow stations to suffix either &quot;-TV&quot; or &quot;-DT&quot; to their call signs if not previously included on their permanent digital channel; this included WGBA, which became WGBA-TV in FCC correspondence and on-air station identifications upon that day.

On July 1, 2019, WGBA&#x27;s digital signal moved from channel 41 to channel 14 as part of the FCC spectrum repack.

===Translator===

In addition to its main signal, WGBA operates a translator to extend the station&#x27;s coverage northward. This is a remnant of the analog era when it was Green Bay&#x27;s only major UHF commercial television station. The station in fact kept a post office box address open for years to allow responses to an offer through a station promo of a free pamphlet describing the installation of a UHF television antenna to interested viewers until the early 1990s. During that period, residents of Northern Door County and the southern portion of Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula could easily receive the three Green Bay network stations on VHF and WFRV semi-satellite WJMN-TV from Escanaba, Michigan, along with PBS member station WNMU from Marquette, Michigan, but not WGBA and PBS Wisconsin&#x27;s WPNE-TV (channel 38); the latter is served by Sister Bay translator W15DJ-D.

WLWK-CD (channel 22) in Sturgeon Bay is officially licensed as a Class A station; this translator was known as W22BW prior to November 27, 2012. Journal and Scripps used the Sturgeon Bay station to warehouse several call letters utilized by its FM station on 94.5 in the Milwaukee market to prevent re-use by competitors. It first carried WKTI, a call sign that had been in use from 1974 to 2008, and were previously warehoused on former sister station WJBE (1040 AM) in Powell, Tennessee, which serves the Knoxville market, until December 2012, when that station was sold to local interests. The calls came back into use in the Milwaukee market as of early June 2015, when Scripps switched 94.5 back to WKTI this time under a country format. WKTI-CD then changed its call sign to WLWK-CD on June 17, 2015, as the WLWK calls used between 2008 and 2015 (standing for &quot;The Lake Milwaukee&quot;) on the 94.5 frequency had to be warehoused themselves to prevent a station in Racine trying to claim the station&#x27;s former branding and variety hits format after Scripps dropped it. Scripps sold the Milwaukee radio stations in 2018 to Good Karma Brands, making it unlikely any other calls will be warehoused on channel 22.

====Former translators====
Before it became an NBC affiliate, WGBA was rebroadcast in Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula on W02AM (channel 2) in Gwinn, W09BA (channel 9) in Felch, W49AF (channel 49) in Crystal Falls, and W56BF (channel 56) in Iron Mountain. The last translator was encrypted and part of the now-defunct over-the-air cable system in the area.

WGBA-TV formerly operated analog translator W31BK in Menominee, Michigan.

<text>Laclede&#x27;s Landing (), colloquially &quot;the Landing&quot;, is a small urban historic district in St. Louis, Missouri. It marks the northern part of the original settlement founded by the Frenchman Pierre Laclède, whose landing on the riverside the placename commemorates. Originally he tasked his 14-year-old stepson, Auguste Chouteau, with the task of preparing the land that sat 10 miles south of the Mississippi-Missouri area. A stone house was erected and named Laclede&#x27;s home in the village he named &quot;St. Louis&quot; as a homage to King Louis IX of France. Initially, fur trade and trapping was the economic interest that would spark Pierre&#x27;s interest in using the landing and making his stepson the richest citizen. The area is now decorated with 19th century warehouses and other period buildings.

Located just north of Gateway Arch National Park (separated by the overland spans of the Eads Bridge) on the Mississippi River front, the Landing is a collection of cobblestone streets and vintage brick-and-cast-iron warehouses dating from 1850 through 1900, now converted into shops, restaurants, and bars. The district is the only remaining section of St. Louis&#x27; 19th-century commercial riverfront.

== Transportation ==
Laclede&#x27;s Landing has many cobblestone streets. It is adjacent to the Eads Bridge, and Interstate 44 (I-44 does not run over the Eads Bridge). On the Eads Bridge there is the Arch-Laclede&#x27;s Landing MetroLink Stop. Laclede&#x27;s Landing once housed Metro&#x27;s (the local transit agency) headquarters.

==In popular culture==
Alternative rock band Wilco mentions the Landing in &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot;, a song on the 2002 album, &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;. Although now based in Chicago, Wilco was initially based in St. Louis and cut their teeth in rock clubs in and around the Landing. Frontman Jeff Tweedy grew up in nearby Belleville, Illinois.

<doc id="767348" wikidata="Q3943492" url="?curid=767348" title="Single channel per carrier">
<text>Single channel per carrier (SCPC) refers to using a single signal at a given frequency and bandwidth. Most often, this is used on broadcast satellites to indicate that radio stations are not multiplexed as subcarriers onto a single video carrier, but instead independently share a transponder. It may also be used on other communications satellites, or occasionally on non-satellite transmissions.

In an SCPC system, satellite bandwidth is dedicated to a single source. This makes sense if it is being used for something like satellite radio, which broadcasts continuously. Another very common application is voice, where a small amount of fixed bandwidth is required. However, it does not make sense for burst transmissions like satellite internet access or telemetry, since a customer would have to pay for the satellite bandwidth even when they were not using it.

Where multiple access is concerned, SCPC is essentially FDMA. Some applications use SCPC instead of TDMA, because they require guaranteed, unrestricted bandwidth. As satellite TDMA technology improves however, the applications for SCPC are becoming more limited.

==Advantages==
* simple and reliable technology
* low-cost equipment
* any bandwidth (up to a full transponder)
** usually 64 kbit/s to 50 Mbit/s
* easy to add additional receive sites (earth stations)

==Disadvantages==
* inefficient use of satellite bandwidth for burst transmissions, typically encountered with packet data transmission
* usually requires on-site control
* When used in remote locations, the transmitting dish must be protected.

==MCPC==
With multiple channels per carrier (MCPC), several subcarriers are combined or multiplexed into a single bitstream before being modulated onto a carrier transmitted from a single location to one or more remote sites. This uses time-division multiplexing (TDM) as well as frequency-division multiplexing. It is a retronym of sorts, as it was the only way radio networks were transmitted (&quot;piggybacked&quot; on television networks) until SCPC.

In digital radio and digital television, an ensemble or other multiplex or multichannel stations can be considered MCPC, though the term is generally only applied to satellites.

The major disadvantage of MCPC is that all of the signals must be sent to a single place first, then combined for retransmission — a major reason for using SCPC instead.</text><links>

<doc id="767350" wikidata="Q1992881" url="?curid=767350" title="Nitrophosphate process">
<text>The nitrophosphate process (also known as the Odda process) is a method for the industrial production of nitrogen fertilizers invented by Erling Johnson in the municipality of Odda, Norway around 1927.

The process involves acidifying phosphate rock with dilute nitric acid to produce a mixture of phosphoric acid and calcium nitrate.

:&lt;chem&gt;Ca5(PO4)3OH + 10 HNO3 -&gt; 3 H3PO4 + 5 Ca(NO3)2 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

The mixture is cooled to below 0 °C, where the calcium nitrate crystallizes and can be separated from the phosphoric acid.

:&lt;chem&gt;2 H3PO4 + 3 Ca(NO3)2 + 12 H2O -&gt; 2 H3PO4 + 3 Ca(NO3)2.4H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

The resulting calcium nitrate produces nitrogen fertilizer. The filtrate is composed mainly of phosphoric acid with some nitric acid and traces of calcium nitrate, and this is neutralized with ammonia to produce a compound fertilizer.

:&lt;chem&gt;Ca(NO3)2 + 4 H3PO4 + 8 NH3 -&gt; CaHPO4 + 2 NH4NO3 + 3(NH4)2HPO4&lt;/chem&gt;

If potassium chloride or potassium sulfate is added, the result will be NPK fertilizer. The process was an innovation for requiring neither the expensive sulfuric acid nor producing gypsum waste (known in the context of phosphate production as phosphogypsum).

The calcium nitrate mentioned before, can as said be worked up as calcium nitrate fertilizer but often it is converted into ammonium nitrate and calcium carbonate using carbon dioxide and ammonia.

:&lt;chem&gt;Ca(NO3)2 + 2 NH3 + CO2 + H2O -&gt; 2 NH4NO3 + CaCO3&lt;/chem&gt;

Both products can be worked up together as straight nitrogen fertilizer.

Although Johnson created the process while working for the Odda Smelteverk, his company never employed it. Instead, it licensed the process to Norsk Hydro, BASF, Hoechst, and DSM. Each of these companies used the process, introduced variations, and licensed it to other companies. Today, only a few companies (e.g. Yara (Norsk Hydro), Acron, EuroChem, Borealis Agrolinz Melamine GmbH, Omnia, GNFC) still use the Odda process. Due to the alterations of the process by the various companies who employed it, the process is now generally referred to as the nitrophosphate process.

<text>United States astronaut badges are the various badges of the United States which are awarded to military and civilian personnel of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the various child departments of the Department of Defense, or a private space-faring entity, who have performed (or in some cases, completed training for) a spaceflight. The military versions are among the least-awarded qualification badges of the United States armed forces.

==History==
The first astronaut badges were created by taking the astronauts&#x27; own aviator badges and overlaying the center shield with a design called the &quot;astronaut device&quot;, a star with three trailing rays passing through an ellipse representing orbital flight.

In the 1960s, the United States Department of Defense awarded astronaut badges to military and civilian pilots who flew aircraft higher than . Seven USAF and NASA pilots qualified for the astronaut badge by flying the suborbital X-15 rocket spaceplane. American test pilots Michael Melvill and Brian Binnie were each awarded a commercial astronaut badge by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) when they flew sub-orbital missions aboard the Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne rocket spaceplane. All others who have been awarded the astronaut badge earned it travelling to space in non-winged rockets, the X-15, or the Space Shuttle. Three of the crew members aboard the Ax-1 flight aboard the Crew Dragon Capsule were awarded their civilian astronaut wings by their Mission commander upon becoming the first private citizens to travel to the International Space Station on April 9, 2022.

==Military badges==
Each of the military services issues its own version of the astronaut badge, which consists of a standard aviation badge with an astronaut device (shooting star through a halo) centered on the badge&#x27;s shield, or escutcheon. The United States Air Force and United States Army astronaut badges are issued in three degrees: Basic, senior, and command (Air Force)/master (Army). The senior astronaut badge is denoted by a star centered above the decoration, while the command/master level is indicated by a star and wreath.

===Eligibility===
To earn an astronaut badge, a U.S. Air Force or U.S. Navy and Marine Corps officer must complete all required training and participate in a space flight more than above the Earth. The U.S. Army has awarded the badge to officers that have orbited the Earth. 

===U.S. Air Force astronauts===
The U.S. Air Force Astronaut Badge consists of a standard USAF aeronautical badge upon which is centered the astronaut device. The Air Force does not consider Astronaut to be a separate rating from its six established rating badges, but as a &quot;qualifier&quot; to them, and may only be awarded by the Air Force Chief of Staff after written application upon completion of an operational space mission. The rating of Observer is used for USAF Mission Specialists who have completed training but not a mission and are not otherwise aeronautically rated as a USAF pilot, RPA pilot, combat systems officer, air battle manager, or flight surgeon. In 2007, the U.S. Air Force announced the opening of astronaut mission specialists positions to enlisted personnel who met certain eligibility requirements. These requirements include: 
* Be on active duty in the U.S. Air Force
* Be a United States citizen
* Have a minimum of a bachelor&#x27;s degree in either engineering, mathematics, biological science, or physical science, with 3 years experience
* Have a current Class II Flight Physical
* Be between 62 and 75 inches tall
No enlisted astronaut badges are yet known to have been issued.

===U.S. Army astronauts===
The gold astronaut device is issued by the U.S. Army to Army aviators, flight surgeons, and aircrew members that qualify as astronauts. Army astronauts that have yet to fly a mission and have not previously been awarded any aviation badge are awarded the army aviation badge. Once they have flown a mission, they are awarded the astronaut device, which is affixed to the shield of their army aviation badge. The army astronaut device was approved on May 17, 1983. The black version of the device and its sew-on equivalent may be worn on the Army Combat Uniform (ACU); the silver wings with gold device version is authorized for wear on Army Service Uniforms. It is believed to be the rarest badge issued by the U.S. Army.

===U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard astronauts===
The naval astronaut insignias are issued in a single degree to naval aviators and flight officers from the United States Navy, United States Marine Corps, and United States Coast Guard, with officers of all three branches receiving their designations as aviators or flight officers through the naval aviation flight training program. All three branches also wear the same insignia which consists of naval aviator insignia or naval flight officer insignia with a centered gold astronaut device. However, the Coast Guard only issues the naval aviator version of the astronaut insignia to its astronauts.
==NASA badges==
===Civilian astronaut badge===

NASA issues an astronaut badge to all civilian personnel who qualify as specialists on spaceflight missions.

The badge is embroidered in either silver or gold, at the astronaut&#x27;s discretion, and feature the same astronaut device as the military versions. It is worn on flight suits and flight jackets.

===Space Shuttle payload specialist badges===

A unique badge was created for individuals serving as payload specialists on NASA Space Shuttle missions. Payload specialists were selected by a variety of organizations and included:
* individuals selected by the research community, a company or consortium flying a commercial payload aboard the spacecraft
* non-NASA astronauts selected by partner nations
* U.S. legislative branch representatives

The payload specialist badge featured a silhouette of the Space Shuttle in place of the astronaut device.

==NASA astronaut pins==

In addition to the astronaut badge, which is worn on a military uniform or NASA jumpsuit, astronauts also earn a pin to wear on civilian clothing, signifying their eligibility to take part in missions to space. These include flights to the International Space Station, and Artemis missions to the moon. 

The first astronaut pin was created for the Mercury Seven astronauts, in the form of the symbol for the planet Mercury overlaid with the Arabic number &quot;7.&quot; As the space program expanded, NASA realized it needed a new symbol to cover personnel on all missions, and created a new lapel pin isolating the &quot;astronaut device&quot; previously applied to flight wings.

The pin is issued in two grades, silver and gold, with the silver pin awarded to candidates who have successfully completed astronaut training and the gold pin to astronauts who have flown in space. Astronaut candidates are given the silver pin but are required to purchase the gold pin at a cost of approximately $400. The Mercury astronauts were the first to receive the pins.

A unique astronaut pin was made for NASA astronaut Deke Slayton in 1967. It was gold in color, like the ones given to astronauts who had flown, and it had a small diamond in place of the star. It was made at the request of the crew of the first crewed mission of the Apollo program as a tribute to Slayton&#x27;s work at NASA. At the time it was thought that Slayton would never get to space himself, due to a heart condition. Believing that Slayton would refuse to wear exactly the same gold pin as veteran astronauts, the diamond was added. The pin was supposed to have been flown on board the Apollo 1 spacecraft, then given to Slayton after the mission was over. However, the Apollo 1 crew died in a fire during a training exercise on January 27, 1967 and the pin was presented to Slayton by the three widows of the dead crew. This diamond-studded gold pin was later flown to the Moon on board Apollo 11 in July 1969. Slayton would go on to earn a gold pin in 1975 as a docking module pilot on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.

A second unique pin was made for Nick Hague after he became the first NASA astronaut to experience an in-flight launch abort. On October 11, 2018, the Soyuz MS-10 mission, part of Expedition 57 to the International Space Station, aborted after one of the four boosters failed to separate properly from the first stage core. The abort happened late enough in the launch sequence that the Soyuz capsule coasted to an apogee of 93 km (58 mi) after separating from the disintegrating rocket. This was above the U.S. definition of the boundary of space at 50 miles (80 km) but below the FAI definition of 100 km (62 mi). In commemoration of his aborted flight, he was given a pin made of roughly-cast tin. He would later receive a gold pin after his successful mission as part of Expedition 59/60.

One silver astronaut pin currently rests on the surface of the Moon, the one that belonged to Clifton Williams, left there by astronaut Alan Bean during Apollo 12 in 1969. Williams was originally scheduled to fly to the Moon as Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 12 but was killed in a plane crash before he was officially assigned to the flight. Bean was his replacement.

==FAA Commercial Space Astronaut Wings==
From 2004 through 2021 the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration created a program to encourage and recognize commercial astronauts, giving special wings to pilots and flight crew on all FAA-licensed commercial flight that exceeded 50 Mile above the surface of the Earth. The FAA Commercial Astronaut Wings design was changed in 2018, and the program opened up to all passengers on such flights.

The program was discontinued in 2021, with the rise of commercial space tourism. In total, 30 people were awarded Commercial Space Astronaut Wings.

<text>Five Stories Falling is a five-song EP released by Thursday in 2002. The first four tracks are live versions of songs from &quot;Full Collapse&quot;, recorded while the band performed on the Vans Warped Tour. The fifth track, a new song named &quot;Jet Black New Year&quot;, quickly became popular amongst fans; the song featured Gerard Way of My Chemical Romance performing screamed background vocals. The EP also featured stories by each of the band members, including touring (and now permanent) keyboardist Andrew Everding.

On their UK Tour in 2006, when introducing the song &quot;Jet Black New Year&quot;, lead singer Geoff Rickly publicly urged the crowd present not to purchase this E.P. but to download &quot;Jet Black New Year&quot; instead.

It reached #197 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

<text>Ayuntamiento () is the general term for the town council, or cabildo, of a municipality or, sometimes, as is often the case in Spain and Latin America, for the municipality itself. is mainly used in Spain; in Latin America is also for municipal governing bodies, especially the executive ones, where the legislative body and the executive body are two separate entities. In Catalan-speaking parts of Spain, municipalities generally use the Catalan cognate, , while Galician ones use the word , Astur-Leonese and Basque . Since is a metonym for the building in which the council meets, it also translates to &quot;city/town hall&quot; in English.

== Historically ==
With the eighteenth-century Bourbon Reforms in New Spain, which created intendancies and weakened the power of the viceroy, the &quot;ayuntamientos&quot; &quot;became the institution representing the interests of the local and regional oligarchical groups then setting deep roots into their territories.&quot; The Spanish Constitution of 1812 called for the transformation of the ayuntamiento, previously dominated by elites, into a representative institution with elections. Article 310 called for the establishment of an ayuntamiento for all settlements with 1,000 inhabitants.
The term was often preceded by the word (&quot;most excellent&quot;), when referring to the council. This phrase is often abbreviated &quot;&quot;Exc.mo Ay.to&quot; &quot;. Other names for ayuntamiento have been &quot;casa de cabildo&quot;, &quot;casa capitular&quot;, &quot;casa consistorial&quot; and &quot;casa del concejo&quot;.

==Local legislative body==
In Latin America several terms exist for the legislative bodies of municipalities. The term is used in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Peru. In Mexico the term is for the council (which refers to itself as the , or ). Puerto Rican municipalities have a &quot;legislatura municipal&quot;. In Peru the term is never used; instead, it is , or (district council). Executive functions in most of these countries is handled by an executive , the mayor (not to be confused with the historic , who was a magistrate).

<text>Chlorosarin is a chemical precursor used in the final step of one method for the production of the nerve agent sarin. Also known as &quot;O&quot;-isopropyl methylphosphonochloridate and isopropyl methylphosphonic chloride, it has a molecular weight of 156.55 g/mol and a molecular formula of C4H10ClO2P.

==Safety==
Chlorosarin will produce effects similar to those of sarin if it is absorbed into body, but they are less severe. However, like sarin, it is highly toxic and small doses of it would be lethal. The Chemical Weapons Convention also lists chlorosarin as well as other chemicals such chlorosoman and QL as controlled substances in Schedule 1.

==Synthesis==
Like GB, ClGB presents a varied preparation route. Overall, it is a lower cost chemical warfare agent than sarin. ClGB was one of the final intermediates of step five of the DMHP process, being known as a raw impurity and as a final precursor.

Chlorosarin can be synthesized from diisopropyl methylphosphonate (DIMP) and phosgene.

<text>Ohio&#x27;s 19th congressional district was created following the 1830 census and was eliminated after the 2000 census. Between 1863 and 1880, it was represented by future US President James A. Garfield, who became the only sitting House member ever to be elected to the Presidency.

From 1992–2002 it included all of Lake County and Ashtabula County together with a collection of eastern suburbs of Cleveland. After 2002 it was replaced by the 14th district. Parts of its old territory were redistricted into 11th, and 13th districts.

<text>Arie de Jong (; October 18, 1865, Jakarta, Dutch East Indies – October 12, 1958, Putten, Netherlands) was a Dutch enthusiast and reformer of the constructed language Volapük by Johann Martin Schleyer, with whose help the Volapük movement gained new strength in the Netherlands. He not only revised Volapük, but also (together with other Volapükist contemporaries) began Volapükaklub Valemik Nedänik (Dutch Universal Volapük Club) and founded Diläd valemik Feda Volapükaklubas. He also founded and edited &quot;Volapükagased pro Nedänapükans&quot;, an independent newspaper in Volapük, which ran for thirty-one years (1932–1963). He wrote Gramat Volapüka, a grammar of the language completely in Volapük, and a German-Volapük dictionary, &quot;Wörterbuch der Weltsprache&quot; (&quot;World Language Dictionary&quot;). He translated the New Testament into Volapük from Greek, as well as many other pieces of literature. Arie de Jong is justly considered the most important Volapükist of a new age of Volapük history.

== Early life and medical career==
Arie de Jong was born on October 18, 1865, to happy parents in Batavia (now Jakarta) in then Dutch East Indies. In 1873, his family moved to Leiden, Netherlands, where he attended grammar-school (1873-1883) and studied medicine (1883-1891) at Leiden University. In February 1891, he received his Doctorate diploma; in March, he became a military medical officer (stationed in East India); briefly afterward, on September 8, he became a university medical doctor in Freiburg by means of his dissertation: &quot;Über Diuretin&quot; (On Diuresis).

On February 18, 1892, de Jong married Maria Elisabeth Wilhelmina Clarkson in Ginneken, and the couple left by a ship by the name of &quot;Princess Sophie&quot; after only one month, on March 22, towards Dutch East Indies. Maria, however, died aboard ship on the Red Sea, on the first day of April. Nineteen days later, Arie reached the city of Batavia alone, and on the 25th, he decided to depart to his workshop in Makassar.

In 1893, he was relocated to Bonthain (now Bantaeng in South Sulawesi); in 1896, to Padang and also to Aceh; in 1898, to Sintang, where he married for the second time, to Elise Marie Wilhelmine Gerardine Chavannes. In 1900, he became a first-class medical officer; in 1902, below he was relocated, first to Semarang and later to Ungaran; in 1904 he returned to Semarang. By that time he had already lost his two children: Marie Eugène, who was born in 1900 and died the following year, and another child who was stillborn.

In 1904 he enjoyed leisure for a year, during which he spent time in Europe. Having returned in 1905 to East Indies, he was sent to Pelantoengan, in 1908 to Yogyakarta, and in 1911 to Magelang, where for in eight years he would become a second-class medical officer. In 1912 he was relocated to Banjarmasin; the following year, he had leisure in Europe for nine months. When he returned to East Indies, he was sent to Surabaya where, at the end of 1914 he became a higher-ranked first-class medical officer. He was sent in 1915 to Malano, where his second wife, Elise Marie, died.

At that time Dutch East Indies still much needed to be organized and improved. Arie de Jong had an important role for these years in the struggle against many tropical diseases, considering that new treatments and previously denied methods appeared at the turn of the century. He helped lepers by providing certain contents for their lives, he allowed them to play instruments and made it possible for them to do simple jobs; and at this time, when these types of actions were not yet popular.

After the death of his wife in 1919, Arie de Jong returned to the Netherlands. In the following year he made The Hague his home, at the age of 54. In 1921, he married his third wife, Louise van Dissel. They had three children: Louisa Cornelia (born in 1922), Arie de Jong, Jr. (1924), and Gijsbertus Hendrienus (1926).

==Association with Volapük==
During his studies in Leiden, de Jong came across Volapük and began to learn it. On March 20, 1891 (a week after he became a military officer), at the age of 25, he received his Volapük teacher&#x27;s diploma, and after ten months, his Volapük instructor diploma. After only a year, on May 15, 1893, he became a Volapük professor (reported in the newspaper &quot;Nuns blefik se Volapükavol&quot; (&quot;Brief News in the World of Volapük&quot;) the following year).

During his stay in the East Indies, de Jong&#x27;s interest in Volapük remained, as seen in his correspondence with various Volapükists and Volapük newspapers. On June 5, 1901, he became a Volapük academian.

<doc id="767401" wikidata="Q2626775" url="?curid=767401" title="Waiting (Thursday album)">
<text>Waiting is the debut studio album by American rock band Thursday. The album was produced by Sal Villanueva and released on Eyeball Records in 1999. The photography throughout the album&#x27;s artwork, with the exception of live shots, was done by Tom Keeley&#x27;s uncle, Dennis Keeley.

This was the band&#x27;s only album recorded with rhythm guitarist Bill Henderson, who would be replaced by Steve Pedulla in 2000.

==Background==
With the exception of &quot;Introduction&quot; and &quot;Where the Circle Ends&quot;, &quot;Waiting&quot; was recorded at the Big Blue Meenie studio in Jersey City, New Jersey in Spring 1999. Sal Villanueva acted as producer for the sessions. Jason Kantor engineered the recordings, while Tim Gilles mastered them at Surgical Sound. &quot;Introduction&quot; and &quot;Where the Circle Ends&quot; were recorded by Charles Newman at Mother West Studios. The two tracks were mastered by Alan Douches at West West Side Music. According to the liner notes, a few additional musicians contributed to the recordings, listed as follows: Frank (guitar), Britta (violin), Mike (guitar input) and Kelly (live violinist).

==Songs==
The song &quot;Porcelain&quot; is a tribute and call to action regarding the death of a friend and gun control. Kevin, best friend to Geoff Rickly, had committed suicide soon after moving to San Francisco while suffering from schizophrenia. At the time of his suicide, there wasn&#x27;t a toll-free suicide hotline available in San Francisco that Kevin was aware of and he was unable to seek counseling at the time of his death. The song &quot;Ian Curtis&quot; was named after the late lead singer of the UK group Joy Division. Another victim of suicide, Curtis hanged himself in his Macclesfield home in 1980. The song contains many Joy Division song references, most notably the lyric &quot;Love has torn us apart&quot;, which they printed on shirts during the tour for the album.

The song &quot;Dying in New Brunswick&quot; was written by Geoff Rickly about his girlfriend who moved to New Brunswick and was raped while she was there. The lyrics are about how he hated the city for what happened and how he felt like he was dying whenever he was there.

==Release==
In July 1999, while on tour, the group released &quot;1999 Summer Tour EP&quot;, an EP that featured demos and unmastered songs that would feature on &quot;Waiting&quot;. &quot;Waiting&quot; was released through Eyeball Records in November 1999; drummer Tucker Rule said the band heard through mutual friends that Revelation Records wanted to sign them, but the label never approached them. The cover was taken by Dennis Keeley.

===2015 reissue===
To commemorate the 15th anniversary of Thursday&#x27;s debut album &quot;Waiting&quot;, Geoff Rickly&#x27;s label Collect Records released a remastered version of the album on March 24, 2015. The updated version features updated artwork and was released in a package containing the album on CD and 180 gram 12&quot; LP with a bonus 7&quot; containing demos of &quot;This Side of Brightness&quot; and &quot;Dying in New Brunswick,&quot; in addition to the track &quot;Mass as Shadows,&quot; which previously appeared on Thursday&#x27;s 1999 tour EP. To promote the reissue, Collect Records released a lyric video for the track &quot;Where the Circle Ends&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Waiting&quot; has received mixed reviews from music critics. Amongst the positive reviews was Tom Forget from AllMusic, who wrote that &quot;[Thursday] hadn&#x27;t quite mastered the blend at this point in their careers, but they did get off to a great start.&quot; Comparing that album the rest of the band&#x27;s oeuvre, Ian Cohen at &quot;Pitchfork&quot; stated that &quot;Waiting simply stands as Thursday’s most promising and earnest album.&quot;

Other writers have been more critical of the album. In a summary of the review for Sputnikmusic, &#x27;DaveyBoy&#x27; claimed that &quot;Songwriting &amp; musical potential is evident, but this debut is brought down by raw production and a short running time that contains too much filler, repetition &amp; padding out.&quot; In an initial review for &quot;Punk News&quot;, &#x27;layawayplan&#x27; felt that &quot;Some of the melodies seem ill-conceived, leaving me scratching my head, and a bit depressed. Lead singer Geoff doesn&#x27;t seem to have fully developed the vocal talent he displays on Full Collapse. The amazing screamed backup vocals (the first thing about Thursday to catch my attention) are there, but again, aren&#x27;t as good as they could be.&quot; However, in a review for the 2015 expanded edition from the same website, that album received a much warmer reception with writer &#x27;RENALDO69&#x27; stating that &quot;Waiting will always be the starting point for a movement and revolution in my life. It&#x27;s quite a ride to take in the more vulnerable and exposed tracks in the expanded edition, and one heck of a nostalgic trip!&quot;

<doc id="767404" wikidata="Q375154" url="?curid=767404" title="Mejiro Station">
<text>is a railway station on the Yamanote Line in Toshima, Tokyo, Japan, operated by the East Japan Railway Company (JR East).

==Lines==
Mejiro Station is served by the circular Yamanote Line. It is one of only two stations on the Yamanote Line that does not provide a direct connection to any other line, the other being .

==Station layout==
Mejiro Station has one island platform serving two tracks. The station building is located above the tracks, and accessibility to and from the platforms is provided by escalators as well as lifts. There are several small shops and a bakery/cafe within the station.

Platform edge doors were installed and brought into use from 9 November 2013.

===Platforms===

==History==
The station opened on 16 March 1885.

Station numbering was introduced in 2016 with Mejiro being assigned station number JY14.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2012, the station was used by an average of 37,684 passengers daily (boarding passengers only). The passenger figures for previous years are as shown below.

==Surrounding area==
Mejiro is one of the Yamanote Line&#x27;s smaller stations, situated between the bustling Ikebukuro and the relatively quiet Takadanobaba.

Mejiro Station has only one exit. The ticket gate emerges onto Mejiro-dori with the co-ed campus of Gakushuin University and the Mejiro Elementary School to the right, and a busy row of shops and restaurants to the left. Just off Mejiro-dori, the wealthy area becomes residential and quite peaceful. The streets to the west, away from the Yamanote loop, feature a mix of typical apartment buildings spanning a few decades, and some very opulent designer houses with luxury vehicles in their garages.

By looking straight ahead from Mejiro Station&#x27;s main exit, one can see well into the distance toward Ikebukuro&#x27;s monument-like garbage processing center and the towering Sunshine 60 building.

When inside Mejiro Station, if you stand at the southernmost part, you can see Takadanobaba Station.

<doc id="767417" wikidata="Q16386669" url="?curid=767417" title="Liar's Poker">
<text>Liar&#x27;s Poker is a non-fiction, semi-autobiographical book by Michael Lewis describing the author&#x27;s experiences as a bond salesman on Wall Street during the late 1980s. First published in 1989, it is considered one of the books that defined Wall Street during the 1980s, along with Bryan Burrough and John Helyar&#x27;s &quot;Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco&quot;, and the fictional &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; by Tom Wolfe. The book captures an important period in the history of Wall Street. Two important figures in that history feature prominently in the text, the head of Salomon Brothers&#x27; mortgage department Lewis Ranieri and the firm&#x27;s CEO John Gutfreund.

The book&#x27;s name is taken from liar&#x27;s poker, a gambling game popular with the bond traders in the book.

==Overview==
The narrative of &quot;Liar&#x27;s Poker&quot; jumps back and forth between two different threads.

One thread is autobiographical: it follows Lewis through his college education, his hiring by Salomon Brothers (now a subsidiary of Citigroup) in 1984, and his training at the firm. It is a first-person account of the personalities, workplace practices, and culture of bond traders. Several high-ranking Salomon Brothers employees of the era, such as arbitrageur John Meriwether, mortgage department head Lewis Ranieri, and firm CEO John Gutfreund, feature prominently. 

The book&#x27;s other thread gives an overview of Wall Street history before focusing on the history of Salomon Brothers in particular. This thread is less dependent on Lewis&#x27; personal experience and features quotes drawn from interviews. It is primarily concerned with how the Salomon Brothers firm almost single-handedly created a market for mortgage bonds that made the firm wealthy, only to be outdone by Michael Milken and his junk bonds.

==Biographical section==
Lewis was an art history student at Princeton University who wanted to break into Wall Street to make money. He describes his almost pathetic attempts to find a finance job, only to be roundly rejected by every firm to which he applied. For example, in 1982 Lehman Brothers had rejected his employment application. He then enrolled in the London School of Economics to gain a master&#x27;s degree in economics.

While in England, Lewis was invited to a banquet hosted by the Queen Mother, where his cousin, Baroness Linda Monroe von Stauffenberg, one of the organizers of the banquet, purposefully seated him next to the wife of the London managing partner of Salomon Brothers. Lewis&#x27;s cousin hoped that his intelligence might impress the partner&#x27;s wife enough to suggest to her husband that Lewis be given a job with Salomon Brothers. The strategy worked, and Lewis was granted an interview and subsequently received a job offer.

Lewis then moved to New York City for Salomon&#x27;s training program. Here he was appalled at the sophomoric, obtuse and obnoxious behavior of some of his fellow trainees as they were indoctrinated into the money culture of Salomon Brothers and the Wall Street culture as a whole.

From New York, Lewis was shipped off to the London office of Salomon Brothers as a bond salesman. Despite his lack of knowledge, he was soon handling millions of dollars in investment accounts. In 1987 he witnessed a near-hostile takeover of Salomon Brothers but survived with his job. However, growing disillusioned with his work, Lewis quit the firm at the beginning of 1988 to write this book and become a financial journalist. The first edition was published October 17, 1989.

==Wall Street culture==
The book is an unflattering portrayal of Wall Street traders and salesmen, their personalities, their beliefs and their work practices.

During the training sessions, Lewis was struck by the infantilism of most of his fellow trainees. Examples included: yelling at and insulting financial experts who talked to them; throwing spit balls at one another and at lecturers; calling phone sex lines and then broadcasting them over the company&#x27;s intercom; gambling on behavioral traits (such as how long it took certain trainees to fall asleep during lectures); and the trainees&#x27; incredible lust for money and contempt for any position that did not earn much.

Lewis attributed the bond traders&#x27; and salesmen&#x27;s behavior to the fact that the trading floor required neither finesse nor advanced financial knowledge, but rather, the ability and desire to exploit others&#x27; weaknesses, to intimidate others into listening to traders and salesmen, and the ability to spend hours a day screaming orders under high-pressure situations. He referred to their worldview as &quot;The Law of the Jungle&quot;.

He also noted that, although most arrivals on Wall Street had studied economics, this knowledge was never used. In fact, any academic knowledge was frowned on by traders.

Lewis also attributed the savings and loan scandal of the 1980s and 1990s to the inability of inexperienced and provincial small-town bank managers to compete with Wall Street. He described people on Wall Street as masters at taking advantage of an undiscerning public, which the savings and loan industry provided in abundance.

==Catch phrases==
*Big Swinging Dick — A big-time trader or salesman. (&quot;If he could make millions of dollars come out of those phones, he became that most revered of all species: a Big Swinging Dick&quot;. p. 56.) The opposite of this term is Geek, used to refer to a just-hired trainee.
*Equities in Dallas — A particularly undesirable job within a finance firm. (&quot;Thus, Equities in Dallas became training program shorthand for &#x27;Just bury that lowest form of human scum where it will never be seen again&#x27;.&quot; p. 58.)
*Blowing up a customer — Convincing a customer to purchase an investment product which ends up declining rapidly in value, forcing the client to end up withdrawing from the market.
*Feeding Frenzy — The Friday-morning meal shared by a certain clique of bond traders. At this meal, traders would order astounding quantities of take-out food, far more than they could eat (e.g., five-gallon tubs of guacamole with an order of $400 worth of Mexican food). The traders would then compete with each other to see who could display the most gluttony.
*The Human Piranha — Nickname for an employee at Salomon Brothers who constantly used the word &quot;fuck&quot; and its variants in his speech. A reference to Tom Wolfe&#x27;s character in &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;.
*No Tears — Used to describe a preset alternate rule Michael Lewis describes in the book, John Gutfreund challenges John Meriwether to a game of liar&#x27;s poker, in which he states &quot;no tears&quot; which means players of the game who lose can&#x27;t complain about losing afterwards.

==Reception==

Despite the book&#x27;s quite unflattering depiction of Wall Street firms and many of the people who worked there, many younger readers were fascinated by the life depicted. Many read it as a &quot;how-to manual&quot; and asked the author for additional &quot;secrets&quot; that he might care to share.

<text>The Church of God of the Union Assembly, previously known as The Union Assembly of the Church of God, is a Holiness (not Pentecostal) church which was organized in 1920 in Walker County, Georgia, by dissidents from the Church of God Mountain Assembly. Its primary numerical strength appears to lie in the North Georgia and East Tennessee areas.

The Founder of the Church of God of the Union Assembly. Inc. began his ministry right after the turn of the century. Reverend Charlie T. Pratt was ordained October 18, 1910 in Gold Bug, Kentucky and immediately his travels to different towns and then to different states.

The following year he traveled to Bartow County, Georgia, where he held a tent revival. A church was organized at Cass Station and they called him to be Overseer.

By 1915 Rev. Pratt traveled Kentucky, Tennessee and Georgia. On February 1, 1915, he established a church in Knoxville, Tennessee. On Christmas Day 1916, the churches that he had established met in a General Assembly at Knoxville, Tennessee. At that meeting, they agreed to come together on the doctrine of the church.

In November 1919, Rev. Pratt and seven other men applied for a church charter in Bartow County, Georgia. The charter was granted and Center, Georgia became the first headquarters for the Church of God of the Union Assembly. Members who were in active support of the Union Assembly of the Church of God from its beginning included; J.W &quot;Wille&quot; Burnett, Tom Bohannon, Joe Vaughn, Chad Jones, Alec Ledford, and T.R. Bell. This is from the original Charter and covenant

In 1922 the National Headquarters was moved to Dalton, Georgia, where it remains today. In October 1942 the Church was incorporated as a non-profit corporation under the &quot;Georgia Corporation Act&quot; of 1938.

<text>Hexhamshire is a former county and current civil parish in Northern England. It included Hexham, Whitley Chapel, Allendale, and St John Lee (today part of Plenmeller with Whitfield) until it was incorporated into Northumberland in 1572.

==History==
Hexhamshire was originally a single parish based on the church of St Andrew, Hexham, and surveys from 1295, 1547 and 1608 all show that the extent of its territory remained highly stable over time. It was probably formed from the lands gifted in 674 to Wilfrid, the Bishop of York, by the Northumbrian queen Æthelthryth to support the newly established Bishopric of Hexham. As the land was granted as a single block and formed part of the Queen&#x27;s dowry, it probably constituted a single pre-existing territorial unit.

In 854 the diocese of Hexham was split between the dioceses of Lindisfarne and York, and by 883 the ownership of Hexhamshire had fallen into the hands of the Bishops of Lindisfarne. Government of Hexhamshire by the Provosts or Thegns of the Bishop of Durham, as successors to Lindisfarne, continued throughout the 11th century until 1071, when William the Conqueror&#x27;s Harrying of the North saw Bishop Æthelwine flee to Lindisfarne, and Uthred, Provost of Hexhamshire, submitted authority over Hexhamshire to Thomas of Bayeux, the Archbishop of York.

The ownership of Hexhamshire by the see of York was confirmed by Henry I, and a regular system of administration was established. Like County Durham, Hexhamshire was a &quot;royal liberty&quot;, where the king&#x27;s writ did not run, and the Archbishop of York enjoyed powers elsewhere held by the king, including complete judicial and administrative authority: pleas of the Crown could be held in his courts, he could hold inquisitions and regulate commercial activity, and he held the exclusive right of taxation. Administration of the territory was conducted by officials appointed by the archbishop, including a bailiff, justices and coroner. Royal officials were rigorously excluded from the territory and it maintained its independence from the royal eyre throughout the 13th century.

Until 1572 Hexhamshire also formed an independent county palatine. Justices of the Peace are recorded from 1358, and leading local families are first recorded being described as &quot;of the county of Hexham&quot; in official documents in 1376 and 1385. In 1408 a Scottish felon arrested for offences in Hexhamshire was released by royal justices on the basis that the acts had occurred &quot;outside the county of Northumberland&quot;, and an act of 1482 expressly listed Hexhamshire alongside Cheshire and County Durham as a county palatine where the proceeds of fines did not go to the king.

Hexham Abbey was dissolved in 1537 in the Dissolution of the monasteries, and after a series of local uprisings the Crown took possession of Hexhamshire in 1545. With the liberty in Crown hands its status became increasingly anachronistic, and in 1572 it was formally abolished.
Hexhamshire was incorporated into Northumberland in 1572 by an act of Parliament, the (14 Eliz. 1. c. 13) (&quot;An Act for the annexing of Hexhamshire to the Countye of Northumberland&quot;). At the same time, the district was transferred from the see of Durham to the see of York, where it remained until 1837.

==Parish==
In modern use, Hexhamshire is the name of a civil parish south of Hexham. The parish covers a large but mostly sparsely populated area, including the villages of Dalton and Whitley Chapel, Broadwell House, and Hexhamshire Common. The civil parish was formed in 1955 by the union of the Hexhamshire High Quarter, Hexhamshire Middle Quarter, and Hexhamshire West Quarter parishes. Hexhamshire Low Quarter, to the north, was merged on 1 April 2011.

<doc id="767433" wikidata="Q2412745" url="?curid=767433" title="Ai Orikasa">
<text>is a Japanese actress, voice actress and singer.

She has played a variety of characters, from young girls to women and boys. In her leading roles, she often voiced boys, and has also done the voice of a mother. She also played the voice of Hagu-Hagu, a strange creature who only says &quot;Hagu-Hagu&quot; in the TV series &quot;Haō Taikei Ryū Knight&quot;. In recent years, she has voiced Shizuka&#x27;s mother in &quot;Doraemon&quot;, and has also provided the Japanese dub voice for Jessica Rabbit in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;.

==Biography==
Orikasa comes from Tokyo, Japan. After moving on from high school in 1982, she graduated from the drama department of the Nihon Denshikōgakuin College (now Nihon Kogakuin College). After performing on stage as an actress with the Bungeiza Theater Company and the Sōhen Theater Company, she participated in an audition for the TV series &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; out of a desire to broaden her work. After several rounds of auditions, she made her debut as a voice actress in 1988, playing the main character, Cedie. According to Orikasa, Minami Takayama and Megumi Hayashibara were the other finalists in the audition for the role of Cedie, and Orikasa says that she was chosen for the role of Cedie because of her innocence rather than her acting ability.

Her stage name, &quot;Ai Orikasa,&quot; implies her wish to be loved by everyone. The staff went to the restroom while thinking of her stage name, and came up with it.

In the early days, she appeared in many works of Nippon Animation. Especially in the World Masterpiece Theater, she was one of frequently appearing voice actors like Kazue Ikura, Ginga Banjō, Ken&#x27;ichi Ogata, etc.; next to &quot;three major voice actors&quot; Mitsuko Horie, Eiko Yamada and Keiko Han.

Of all the characters she has played in anime, she cites Ryōko from the &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; series as her most memorable character. She has also dubbed for dramas, movies, and animation produced overseas, and has been active as a singer among other things.

At the end of September 2011, it was announced that she had left Production Baobab, where she had belonged for many years since her debut, and moved to Axlone, Toshiyuki Morikawa&#x27;s agency.

<doc id="767439" wikidata="Q1627346" url="?curid=767439" title="Rape (county subdivision)">
<text>A rape is a traditional territorial sub-division of the county of Sussex in England, formerly used for various administrative purposes. Their origin is unknown, but they appear to predate the Norman Conquest of 1066. Historically, the rapes formed the basis of local government in Sussex.

There are various theories about their origin. Possibly surviving from the Romano-British era or perhaps representing the shires of the kingdom of Sussex, the Sussex rapes, like the Kentish lathes, go back to the dawn of English history when their main function would have been to provide food rents and military manpower to the king. The rapes may also derive from the system of fortifications devised by Alfred the Great in the late ninth century to defeat the Vikings.

The Sussex rapes each had a headquarters in the developed south where the lord&#x27;s hall, court, demesne lands, principal church and peasant holdings were located, whereas to the north there were smaller dependent settlements in the marsh, woodland and heath used for summer pasture. Each rape was split into several hundreds.

==Etymology==
The toponymy of the rapes is unclear and debated to this day. First suggested by William Somner in the 17th century, it seems that the derivation of the word from the Old English (rope) has been made practically certain. The suggestion that ropes were used to mark out territory, was well countered by J. H. Round, asking &quot;do those who advance such views realize the size of the districts they have to deal with?&quot; However, Heinrich Brunner explained the application of &quot;rope&quot; to an administrative district by the old German custom of defining the limits of the &quot;peace&quot; of popular open-air courts by stakes and ropes, the ropes then giving a name first to the court and then afterwards to the area of its jurisdiction, and produced a case where &quot;reep&quot;, the Dutch cognate of , is applied to such a judicial area. The parish of Rope, in Cheshire is one place name in England derived from the word &quot;rāp&quot;.

The Saxon origin has been questioned, as the Normans showed little interest in learning the English language, and thus it seems unlikely that they would have adopted a local word. It has been suggested that the term comes from the old French , meaning to seize or take by force.

One suggested etymology of the word, from Edward Lye in the 18th century, is in the Icelandic territorial division , meaning &#x27;district or tract of land&#x27;. However, this is rejected in the &quot;New English Dictionary&quot;, and according to the English Place-Name Society is &quot;phonologically impossible&quot;.

==History==
===Origins===
The origin of the rapes is not known. It is possible that the rapes represent the shires of the ancient kingdom of Sussex, especially as in the 12th century they had sheriffs of their own. According to John Morris the boundary between the Rapes of Lewes and Pevensey, which cuts through the middle of Lewes, probably pre-dates the founding of Lewes in the late 9th or early 10th century. If one boundary had existed so early then it is quite possible that other boundaries also existed. Sussex&#x27;s rapes may have been a similar division to the six or seven lathes of neighbouring Kent which were undoubtedly early administrative units.

Another possibility is that the rapes may derive from the system of fortifications, or &quot;burhs&quot; (boroughs) devised by Alfred the Great in the late ninth century to defeat the Vikings. The Rapes, or similar predecessors may have been created for the purpose of maintaining these early boroughs, or they may have re-used earlier divisions for this purpose. In Sussex, the fortifications in the Burghal Hidage were recorded as being at &quot;Eorpeburnan&quot; on the Sussex-Kent border, Hastings, Lewes, Burpham and Chichester. The &quot;Burghal Hidage&quot; lists boroughs in geographical order. Burpham was the predecessor of Arundel and &quot;Eorpeburnan&quot; or &quot;Heorpeburnan&quot; should be the predecessor of Rye. Pevensey and Steyning were not included. It looks as if the lands of Steyning served Lewes and those of Pevensey served Hastings, while the eastern portion of the later Hastings rape was attached to the Rye area. It is possible that these divisions might be rapes as four of them (taking Burpham as equivalent to neighbouring Arundel) had the same centres as later rapes. If this is the case then the rapes must have been completely reorganised in the next century and a half. Since the system of fortifications introduced by Alfred the Great extended into Surrey and Wessex as well, but neither of these regions have rapes or any similar sub-divisions.

It is also possible that the &quot;rape of Arundel&quot; that is twice mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 was the later rape of Arundel and not the whole &quot;rape of Earl Roger (of Montgomery)&quot;, which included the later rape of Chichester. The Normans are not likely to have created rapes and then to have at once thrown two of them into one. The existence of the rapes before the Norman Conquest provides the most natural explanation of the fact that the two later rapes of Chichester and Arundel are represented in the Domesday Book of the single &quot;rape of Earl Roger&quot;, William the Conqueror&#x27;s most important grantee in Sussex. William might of course have created five rapes only, one of which, out of all proportion to the others in size, was afterwards divided, but for this there is no evidence.

===Norman castleries===
At the time of the Norman Conquest there were four rapes: Arundel, Lewes, Pevensey and Hastings. Arundel and Bramber replaced Burpham and Steyning as Rapal centres. The rape of Arundel consisted of the entire area of Sussex west of the River Adur, corresponding to the boundaries of both the western division of the church in Sussex (the forerunner to the archdeaconry of Chichester) and the boundaries of the traditional western area of the Sussex dialect. By the time of the Domesday Book, William the Conqueror had created the rape of Bramber as an afterthought out of parts of the Arundel and Lewes rapes, so that the Adur estuary could be better defended. Although the origin and original purpose of the Rapes is not known, their function after 1066 is clear. With its own lord and sheriff, each Rape was an administrative and fiscal unit. The organisation of the whole of Sussex apart from royal and church lands into territorial blocks each with a fortress near the sea was exceptional. Situated between Normandy and London, control over Sussex was strategically important to William the Conqueror, who needed to protect his major communication routes. Also as the ancestral home of the last Saxon king of England, Harold Godwinson, William had to be careful to secure Sussex against revolt. William did this by dividing Sussex into territories. Under the Normans each traditional rape was now centred on a castle: Sir Henry Ellis&#x27;s observation that the rapes &quot;were military districts for the supply of the castles which existed in each&quot; applied to the Anglo-Norman period The castles formed a network of strongholds which, as well as deterring insurgency and preventing invasion also acted as regional administrative centres. Each rape had a single sheriff and ran as a strip, north–south, from the border with Surrey/Kent to the English Channel. The castles of Arundel, Bramber and Lewes were sited on positions overlooking the rivers Arun, Adur and Ouse respectively, while those at Chichester, Hastings and Pevensey overlooked the coast.

In the Domesday survey, five great Norman lords held the rapes into which Sussex was divided, four of them giving their names to four of the five divisions as they were called in Domesday Book; at the accession of King Henry I in 1100 they were Robert of Bellême in Arundel rape, Robert&#x27;s nephew William, Count of Mortain in Pevensey, William of Warenne in Lewes, the count of Eu in Hastings and, the only fully trustworthy Sussex lord at the time, Philip de Braose in Bramber. These lords had succeeded, not to similar Anglo-Saxon magnates, but to a crowd of lesser landholders: each also held lands in the rapes of others.

Between 1250 and 1262, the rape of Chichester was created from the western half of Arundel rape. From this time onwards, Sussex was divided into—from west to east—Chichester, Arundel, Bramber, Lewes, Pevensey and Hastings rapes.

===Modern period===
The rapal courts continued to meet and stewards for the rapes were recorded into the 18th century. In the 17th century an annual muster took place at the same place in each Rape, such as at Ditchling Common for the Lewes Rape and Berwick Common for the Rape of Pevensey. The muster could take place more frequently at times of perceived danger. Each Rape also had a horse company which would meet at Bury Hill for the Rapes of Arundel, Bramber and Chichester, and at Piltdown for the Rapes of Hastings, Lewes and Pevensey.

By 1894 most administrative functions of the rapes had ended. The Rapes of Arundel, Bramber and Chichester each responsible for the repair of bridges and the Rape of Hastings had a separate coroner, which lasted until 1960. In 2018, flags for each of the six rapes were designed for the Sussex Association by the vexillographer, Brady Ells. Ells had previously campaigned for the flag of Sussex to be registered by the Flag Institute in 2010.

==The Sussex Rapes==
===Rapal castles===
==Geography==
===Subdivisions===
Each Rape was subdivided into several hundreds and half hundreds. The half hundreds arose when the Rape of Bramber was created in the late 11th century where the new Rapal boundary divided a pre-existing hundred in two. This happened at East and West Easwrith, which was divided between the Rapes of Arundel and Bramber, and Fishersgate, which was divided between the Rapes of Bramber and Lewes. By the 19th century the Rapes were each subdivided for administrative purposes into two divisions. Each Rape had an upper division covering the northern, Wealden half of each Rape, and a lower division covering the southern, coastal half of each Rape.

===Regional grouping===
The Rapes may be grouped in regions, most commonly two geographic divisions within Sussex. The Rapes of Arundel, Bramber and Chichester comprised Sussex&#x27;s western division; the Rapes of Hastings, Lewes and Pevensey comprised Sussex&#x27;s eastern division. These divisions formed the basis of the areas administered by East and West Sussex County Councils and the non-metropolitan counties of East Sussex and West Sussex that were created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972.

==Symbolism==
The six martlets on the Sussex flag and emblem represent the six Rapes, a design which goes back to at least the 17th century.

<doc id="767463" wikidata="Q7753681" url="?curid=767463" title="The New Moon">
<text>The New Moon is an operetta with music by Sigmund Romberg, lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II and book by Oscar Hammerstein II, Frank Mandel, and Laurence Schwab. The show was the third in a string of Broadway hits for Romberg (after &quot;The Student Prince&quot; (1924) and &quot;The Desert Song&quot; (1926)) written in the style of Viennese operetta. Set around the time of the French Revolution, the story centers on a young French aristocrat in disguise, who has fled his country and falls in love with the daughter of a prominent New Orleans planter.

It premiered in Philadelphia in 1927 and played on Broadway in 1928. It spawned a number of revivals and two film adaptations, and it remains popular with light opera companies. The piece turned out to be &quot;Broadway&#x27;s last hit operetta&quot;, as World War II and the Golden Age of musicals approached, heralding a change in musical theatre genres.

==Performance history==
&quot;The New Moon&quot; debuted in Philadelphia on December 22, 1927 at the Chestnut Street Opera House. The tryout was a failure, and the show was extensively revised before another tryout in Cleveland in August 1928 and then moving to New York City. Al Goodman conducted in both Philadelphia and New York.

The operetta opened on Broadway at the Imperial Theatre on September 19, 1928, ran for 519 performances, and closed at the Casino Theatre on December 14, 1929. The production used set designs by Donald Oenslager. The work was produced in London&#x27;s West End at the Drury Lane Theatre in 1929. Although the piece received international productions and stock revivals lasting into the 1950s, it subsequently disappeared from the repertoire for a few decades. One commentator wrote, &quot;What has kept &quot;The New Moon&quot; from being as familiar as &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot; or &quot;The Student Prince&quot; is perhaps its chronological place at the end of operetta&#x27;s reign over the musical stage. 

The operetta was restaged faithfully in 1986 by the New York City Opera and was telecast by PBS in 1989. The Light Opera of Manhattan staged the work several times in the 1980s.

City Center Encores! presented a semi-staged revival at New York City Center in March 2003. The Encores production was presented during the run-up to the Iraq War and part of the audience responded with loud applause and cheers to the line &quot;One can be loyal to one&#x27;s country and yet forswear its leader&quot;.

==Synopsis==
Robert is a young French aristocrat whose revolutionist inclinations force him to flee his country. Under an assumed name, he sells himself as a bond-servant to planter and ship-owner Monsieur Beaunoir and his family in New Orleans in 1792. Because the Paris police are looking everywhere for him, Robert cannot tell Beaunoir or Beaunoir&#x27;s beautiful daughter Marianne, with whom he has fallen in love, that he is of noble blood. Eventually he is tracked down by Vicomte Ribaud, the detective villain, and put aboard a ship, the &quot;New Moon&quot;, so that he can be returned to France. Robert thinks he has been betrayed by Marianne, who has gained her father&#x27;s consent to travel on the same ship, pretending that she is in love with the ship&#x27;s captain, Duval. A mutiny occurs, and Robert and the bond-servants come into power. Everyone goes ashore on the Isle of Pines, and a new republic is founded.

The republic flourishes under Robert&#x27;s guidance, but Marianne, her pride hurt, at first refuses to marry Robert. French ships arrive, apparently to reclaim the island. Vicomte Ribaud expects them to conquer the island for the King of France. But the French Commander reveals that there has been a revolution in France, and that all aristocrats must die unless they renounce their titles. Ribaud, a Royalist, heads for execution, but republican Robert renounces his title. All ends happily for him and Marianne.

==Film versions==

Two film versions were produced by MGM. The first, in 1930, starred Grace Moore and Lawrence Tibbett, with a setting in Russia. It added two new songs by Herbert Stothart and Clifford Grey. The second, in 1940, starred Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy.

A television version of a performance at New York City Opera aired on PBS&#x27;s &quot;Great Performances&quot; in 1989 and was subsequently issued on VHS and DVD.

==Recordings==
No original Broadway cast recording was made, but the 1928 London cast recorded some selections for Columbia. These 78 rpm records have been transferred to CD on the Pearl Label. The song &quot;Stout-hearted Men&quot; was recorded in 1930 by Perry Askam and in 1967 by Barbra Streisand, peaking at No. 2 on the Easy Listening chart.

Earl Wrightson and Frances Greer starred in Al Goodman&#x27;s recording for RCA Victor (LK-1011). Decca made an album in 1953 with Lee Sweetland and Jane Wilson covering six selections from the score, which has been reissued on CD paired with &quot;The Desert Song&quot;. Gordon MacRae recorded a 10-inch LP for Capitol Records (Capitol H-219) in 1950 with Lucille Norman. It was repackaged as a split release in 1956 on one side of a 12-inch album with Rudolf Friml&#x27;s &quot;The Vagabond King&quot; on the reverse, also with Lucille Norman (Capitol T-219). That release was reissued on CD in 2011 by Vintage Music.

&quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; included the operetta in the 1963 collection, &quot;A Treasury of Great Operettas&quot;, starring Jeanette Scovotti and Peter Palmer and conducted by Lehman Engel. As part of a new series of stereo recordings of classic operettas, Capitol had MacRae and Dorothy Kirsten record three studio cast albums in 1962 and 1963. Their selections from &quot;The New Moon&quot; (Capitol SW-1966) are available on the EMI CD &quot;Music of Sigmund Romberg&quot;, along with selections from &quot;The Student Prince&quot; (Capitol SW-1841), and &quot;The Desert Song&quot; (Capitol SW-1842).

The Encores! cast recorded the score in 2004, using the original orchestrations, for Ghostlight Records. A reviewer wrote in &quot;Playbill&quot; that the recording &quot;is eminently enjoyable. ... &quot;The New Moon&quot; is vibrant, full-bodied and – yes – stouthearted.&quot; John Kenrick praised Rodney Gilfry, Christiane Noll, Brandon Jovanovich, the supporting cast and the conducting, writing: &quot;What a spectacular delight! ... [the] songs soar, exploding with romance and swashbuckling bravado.&quot;

<doc id="767470" wikidata="Q513960" url="?curid=767470" title="Tim Ryan (Ohio politician)">
<text>Timothy John Ryan (born July 16, 1973) is an American politician who served as a U.S. representative for Ohio from 2003 to 2023. A member of the Democratic Party, he represented from 2013 to 2023, having previously represented from 2003 to 2013. Ryan&#x27;s district included a large swath of northeastern Ohio, from Youngstown to Akron. He was the Democratic nominee in the 2022 United States Senate election in Ohio, which he lost to author JD Vance.

Born in Niles, Ohio, Ryan worked as an aide to U.S. Representative Jim Traficant after studying political science at Bowling Green State University, and earned a Juris Doctor from the University of New Hampshire School of Law. He served in the Ohio Senate from 2001 to 2002 before winning the election to succeed Traficant.

In November 2016, Ryan launched an unsuccessful challenge to unseat Nancy Pelosi as party leader of the House Democrats. He was also a candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination before ending his campaign in 2019 to run for reelection to the House. Ryan was reelected to his tenth term in 2020. In 2021, Ryan announced his candidacy for Ohio&#x27;s Senate seat and won the Democratic nomination with 70% of the vote. He lost to the Republican nominee, JD Vance in the November 8, 2022, general election.

==Early life and career==
Ryan was born in Niles, Ohio, the son of Rochelle Maria (Rizzi) and Allen Leroy Ryan; he is of Irish and Italian ancestry. Ryan&#x27;s parents divorced when he was seven years old, and Ryan was raised by his mother. Ryan graduated from John F. Kennedy High School in Warren, where he played football as a quarterback and coached junior high basketball. He was recruited to play football at Youngstown State University, but a knee injury ended his playing career and he transferred to Bowling Green State University.

Ryan received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from Bowling Green in 1995 and was a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity. After college, he joined the staff of Ohio Congressman Jim Traficant. In 2000, Ryan earned a Juris Doctor degree from Franklin Pierce Law Center in Concord, New Hampshire. From 2000 to 2002 he served half a term in the Ohio State Senate.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===

After Jim Traficant was convicted on criminal charges in 2002, Ryan declared his candidacy for the 17th district. As the result of redistricting following the 2000 census, the 17th, which had long been based in Youngstown, had been pushed west and included much of Portage County and part of Akron. Before the redistricting, all of Akron had been part of the 14th district, represented by eight-term Democrat Tom Sawyer. The 14th had been eliminated in 2000; most of it was drawn into the 13th district of fellow Democrat Sherrod Brown, but Sawyer&#x27;s home was drawn into the 17th. Ryan was initially seen as an underdog in a six-way Democratic primary that included Sawyer.

In the 2002 Democratic primary, Ryan defeated Sawyer, who was seen as insufficiently labor-friendly in the newly drawn district. In the November 2002 general election, he faced Republican Insurance Commissioner Ann Womer Benjamin as well as Traficant, who ran as an independent from his prison cell. Ryan won with 51% of the vote to Benjamin&#x27;s 37%. When he took office in January 2003, he was the youngest Democrat in the House, at 29 years of age. He was reelected to represent the 17th district five times, only once facing a contest nearly as close as his first. In 2010, he was held to 53% of the vote; Traficant, running as an independent, took 16%.

From redistricting in 2012, until giving up to seat to run for the United States Senate he served five terms as the U.S. representative for the 13th district.

===Tenure===

In his first year in office in 2003, Ryan was one of seven members of Congress to vote against the Do-Not-Call Implementation Act, and one of eight to oppose ratification of the Federal Trade Commission&#x27;s establishment of a National Do Not Call Registry.

In 2010, Ryan voted for the Stupak Amendment restricting federal funding for abortions, but in January 2015, he announced that having &quot;gained a deeper understanding of the complexities and emotions that accompany the difficult decisions [about whether to end a pregnancy]&quot; over his time in public office, he had reversed his position on abortion and now identified as pro-choice.

In 2010, Ryan introduced the Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act, which sought punitive trade tariffs on countries, notably China, that were engaging in currency manipulation. It passed the House overwhelmingly but never made it to the floor in the Senate. In an October 2010 interview with conservative magazine &quot;Human Events&quot;, Ryan said tax increases on small businesses were necessary &quot;because we have huge deficits. We gotta shore up Social Security. We gotta shrink our deficits.&quot;

Ryan initiated a bid to replace Pelosi as House Minority Leader on November 17, 2016, prompted by colleagues after the 2016 presidential election. After Pelosi agreed to give more leadership opportunities to junior members, she defeated Ryan by a vote of 134–63 on November 30.

Ryan supported the Iran nuclear deal to prevent Iran from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. In April 2016, he tweeted, &quot;I was in Jerusalem a few weeks ago &amp; saw firsthand the dangerous threat Israelis face. Israel has the right to defend itself from terror.&quot;

Around 2018, Ryan helped Adi Othman, an undocumented immigrant in Youngstown, Ohio, remain in the United States. Othman had lived in the United States for nearly 40 years, ran several businesses in Youngstown, was married to a US citizen and had four US-born children. Ryan repeatedly presented a bill to Congress whereby Othman would be granted a more thorough review of his case to stay in the United States (Othman disputed a verdict by immigration officials on a matter that affected his legal status); the fact that the bill was in motion meant that Othman could temporarily stay. Othman was deported from the United States in February 2018 after President Donald Trump directed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to increase the number of arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants. Ryan condemned the deportation, saying, &quot;To watch these families get ripped apart is the most heart-breaking thing any American citizen could ever see ... Because you are for these families, it doesn&#x27;t mean you are not for a secure border.&quot;

Ryan chaired the Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch, which investigated the January 6 United States Capitol attack. In May 2021, Ryan angrily chastised Senate Republicans for blocking a January 6 commission to investigate the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

==2020 presidential campaign==


After the 2018 midterms, Ryan was seen as a possible candidate for the 2020 presidential election. In February and March 2019, he traveled to early primary states such as Iowa and New Hampshire. Ryan&#x27;s 2020 presidential campaign officially began on April 4, 2019, when he announced his candidacy in the Democratic primaries. He also announced that he would seek the nomination on &quot;The View&quot;. After qualifying for only two debates and continuously polling below 1% nationwide, Ryan formally withdrew from the race on October 24, 2019. He was reelected to the House of Representatives in 2020.

== 2022 U.S. Senate election ==

On January 25, 2021, Republican U.S. Senator from Ohio Rob Portman announced that he would not seek reelection in 2022. Ryan filed paperwork to run to replace him. On April 26, 2021, Ryan announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate in a video posted via Twitter.

Ryan defeated Morgan Harper and Traci Johnson in the Democratic primary and faced Republican nominee JD Vance in the general election. In pursuit of center-right voters, Ryan&#x27;s campaign sought to portray him as a moderate or &quot;independent&quot;, highlighting that he voted for some of former President Donald Trump&#x27;s policies. Ryan also criticized and distanced himself from fellow Democrats, including President Joe Biden, suggesting that Biden should not seek reelection in 2024, and progressive Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, whose endorsement he seemingly rejected.

A Ryan campaign ad, repeatedly blaming China for the loss of American jobs, attracted criticism from politicians and Asian American groups, who said it encouraged Sinophobia and anti-Asian hate. Representative Grace Meng called on Ryan to stop airing it.

On November 8, 2022, Ryan lost to J.D. Vance in the general election by 6 points. 

On July 2, 2024, after the first 2024 Presidential debate between President Joe Biden and Donald Trump, Tim Ryan said that he had lost confidence in Biden&#x27;s ability to defeat Trump and called on him to be replaced by the Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Presidential Nominee.

== Political views ==

Ryan is an advocate of economic protectionism, unionization, and steps to reduce income inequality. A critic of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), he has criticized George W. Bush&#x27;s and Barack Obama&#x27;s trade policies.

Ryan has supported tougher measures against China and its ruling party. He has accused the nation of currency manipulation and outsourcing American manufacturing jobs.

Ryan described himself as a pro-life Catholic when first running for Congress in 2002, but by 2015 he shifted his stance towards pro-choice, arguing that &quot;no federal or state law banning abortion can honestly and fairly take into account the various circumstances that make each decision unique&quot;.

==Publications==
In March 2012, Hay House published Ryan&#x27;s &quot;A Mindful Nation&quot;, a book about the practice of mindfulness in both private and public life. He writes in his introduction: In October 2014, the same publisher published Ryan&#x27;s &quot;The Real Food Revolution&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 2013, Ryan married Andrea Zetts, his second wife; they live in Dublin, Ohio, but lived in eastern Ohio during his tenure in Congress and his senate campaign. Ryan is the stepfather of Zetts&#x27;s two children from a previous relationship, and the two welcomed a son in 2016.

Ryan is a Catholic and spent 12 years in Catholic schools such as the John F. Kennedy Catholic School in Warren, Ohio, and named Catholic social teaching as a major influence on his life and political thought. He also emphasized the religiosity of his family, crediting his &quot;devout grandfather, other churchgoing relatives, social-justice-minded religious sisters&quot; as his inspiration. Ryan also expressed his deep respect for Pope Francis, writing: &quot;I&#x27;m on the Pope Francis Twitter feed and I make sure I&#x27;m always staying connected to what he&#x27;s saying on public issues&quot;. Ryan styled himself as a &quot;Roosevelt-style Catholic Democrat&quot; while campaigning, emphasising both his working-class background and Irish-Italian Catholic roots, and is seen by political pundits as a &quot;more traditional Catholic willing to swim in traditional political waters&quot;.

<doc id="767481" wikidata="Q782363" url="?curid=767481" title="Tales of Suspense">
<text>Tales of Suspense is the name of an American comic book anthology series, and two one-shot comics, all published by Marvel Comics. The first, which ran from 1959 to 1968, began as a science-fiction anthology that served as a showcase for such artists as Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and Don Heck, then featured superheroes Captain America and Iron Man during the Silver Age of Comic Books before changing its title to &quot;Captain America&quot; with issue #100 (cover-dated April 1968). Its sister title was &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot;. Following the launch of Marvel Legacy in 2017, &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; was once again resurrected at issue #100, featuring the Winter Soldier and Hawkeye in a story called &quot;The Red Ledger&quot;.

==Publication history==
===Science-fiction anthology===
&quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; and its sister publication &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; were both launched with a January 1959 cover date. Initially published under Atlas Comics, the 1950s forerunner of Marvel, it fell under the Marvel banner with issue #19 (July 1961), the first with a cover sporting the early &quot;MC&quot; box. It contained science-fiction mystery/suspense stories written primarily by editor-in-chief Stan Lee and his brother, Larry Lieber, with artists including Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and Don Heck. Issue #9 (May 1960) introduced Chondu the Mystic as an anthological-story character; he would be reintroduced as a supervillain in the 1970s.

===Iron Man and the Watcher===
Issue #39 (March 1963) introduced the superhero Iron Man, created by editor and plotter Lee, Lee’s brother scripter Lieber, and artists Heck and Jack Kirby. He starred in generally 13-page but occasionally 18-page adventures, with the rest of &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; devoted to the anthological science fiction and fantasy stories the comic normally ran.

After debuting with bulky gray armor, Iron Man was redesigned with similar but golden armor in his second story (issue #40, April 1963). The first iteration of the modern, sleek red-and-golden armor appeared in #48 (Dec. 1963), drawn by Ditko (though whether he or Kirby, singly or in collaboration, designed it, is uncertain). From #53-58 (May-Oct. 1964), the cover logo was &quot;Tales of Suspense featuring The Power of Iron Man&quot;. Two months before the debut of the sorcerer-hero Doctor Strange, Lee, Kirby and scripter Robert Bernstein, under the pseudonym &quot;R. Berns&quot;, introduced a same-name criminal scientist and Ph.D., Carl Strange. Making his sole appearance in the Iron Man story &quot;The Stronghold of Dr. Strange&quot; in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #41 (May 1963), the character gained mental powers in a freak lightning strike. The Mandarin debuted in issue #50 (Feb. 1964) and would become one of Iron Man&#x27;s major enemies. The Black Widow first appeared in #52 (April 1964) and Hawkeye followed five issues later.

The first Marvel superhero work by future company editor-in-chief Roy Thomas was his scripting the Iron Man story &quot;My Life for Yours&quot; in #73 (Jan. 1966), working from a plot by editor Lee as well as a plot assist from Marvel secretary-receptionist Flo Steinberg.

From #49–58 (Jan.–Oct. 1964), one anthological story each issue acquired a framing sequence and ran as &quot;Tales of the Watcher,&quot; narrated by the namesake cosmic witness introduced in &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #13 and used as a Marvel Universe supporting character since. The final &quot;Tales of the Watcher&quot; story introduced veteran artist George Tuska as a Marvel regular. Four years later, Tuska would become one of Iron Man&#x27;s signature artists.
===Captain America===
Beginning with issue #59 (Nov. 1964), Iron Man began sharing the now &quot;split book&quot; with Captain America, who had guest-starred in the Iron Man feature the previous issue. Jack Kirby, Captain America&#x27;s co-creator during the 1940s Golden Age of comic books, had drawn the character as part of the superhero team the Avengers earlier that year, and was now illustrating his hero&#x27;s solo adventures for the first time since 1941. Issue #63 (March 1965), in which editor-scripter Stan Lee retold Captain America&#x27;s origin, through #71 (Nov. 1965) featured period stories set during World War II, and co-starred Captain America&#x27;s Golden Age sidekick, Bucky Barnes. Sharon Carter was introduced in issue #75 (March 1966) and later became a love interest for Captain America. The Red Skull, Captain America&#x27;s nemesis during World War II, was revived in the present day in issue #79 (July 1966). MODOK first appeared in #94 (Oct. 1967).

Kirby drew all but two stories, for which Gil Kane and John Romita Sr. each filled-in. Several stories were finished by penciler-inker George Tuska over Kirby layouts, with one finished by Romita Sr. and another by penciler Dick Ayers and inker John Tartaglione. Kirby&#x27;s regular inkers on the series were Frank Giacoia (as &quot;Frank Ray&quot;) and Joe Sinnott, though Don Heck and Golden Age Captain America artist Syd Shores inked one story each.

&quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; became &quot;Captain America&quot; with #100 (April 1968). Iron Man appeared in the one-shot &quot;Iron Man and Sub-Mariner&quot; #1 (April 1968), and then debuted in his own title with &quot;Iron Man&quot; #1 (May 1968).

==Revival==
A &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; one-shot (Jan. 1995) which had a cover with a clear plastic overlay, featured Captain America and Iron Man in a single story written by James Robinson and drawn by Colin MacNeil. Another one-shot, &quot;Tales of Suspense: Captain America and Iron Man Commemorative Edition&quot; (Feb. 2005) reprinted the previous month&#x27;s &quot;Captain America&quot; vol. 5 #1 and &quot;Iron Man&quot; vol. 4 #1.

==In other media==
*An episode of &quot;The Super Hero Squad Show&quot; shares the same name along with the title card being a homage to Tales of Suspense #39 and the bank teller&#x27;s exclamation &quot;Iron Man! He lives! He walks! He conquers!&quot; referencing the text on the cover itself
*In &quot;The Lady in the Lake&quot;, the premiere episode of the second season of &quot;Agent Carter&quot;, Whitney Frost appears in the movie &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; which is a reference to the comic book series where the character first appeared.

<text>Baron Simon Grundel-Helmfelt (1617–1677) was a Swedish field marshal and governor. Helmfelt is most notable for his overwhelming victory at the Battle of Lund despite being heavily outnumbered by Danish troops.

==Military career==

He served in the Thirty Years&#x27; War from 1641 and distinguished himself at the Battle of Breitenfeld and received his first commission.

He was knighted in 1646, when he changed his name from Grundel to Grundel-Helmfelt. Later that year he was wounded outside Rain am Lech by a musket bullet. In 1649 he was promoted to colonel of the Artillery and in 1655 to general of the Infantry. In 1656, he was appointed governor of Riga, where he successfully defended the town against Tsar Alexej and his army of 90,000 men. He became governor-general of Ingria in 1658.

Helmfelt returned to Stockholm in 1676 to become commander-in-chief of the Swedish Army during the Scanian War. He was killed the following year at the Battle of Landskrona.

<doc id="767488" wikidata="Q967900" url="?curid=767488" title="Tom Sawyer (Ohio politician)">
<text>Thomas Charles Sawyer (August 15, 1945 – May 20, 2023) was an American politician of the Democratic Party. During a career that spanned five decades, he represented his hometown of Akron, Ohio, across multiple levels of government. He was a member of the Ohio House of Representatives from 1977 to 1983, the Mayor of Akron from 1984 to 1986, a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1987 to 2003, and a member of the Ohio Senate from 2007 to 2016.

==Early life==
Sawyer was born in Akron, Ohio. After graduating from Buchtel High School in Akron, Sawyer received a bachelor of arts degree from the University of Akron in 1968. He also joined the Alpha Phi chapter of Phi Kappa Tau fraternity. Later, Sawyer earned a master of arts degree from Akron in 1970. He worked as an English teacher in Cleveland before seeking political office, winning a seat in the Ohio House of Representatives in 1977.

== Mayor of Akron ==
In November 1983, Sawyer defeated the incumbent Republican Mayor of Akron, Roy Ray, in a close election. Sawyer was the first Democrat to be elected Mayor of Akron in over 18 years. No Republican has held the mayor&#x27;s seat in Akron since Sawyer upset Ray in 1983.

On December 20, 1984, during Sawyer&#x27;s first year as mayor, an explosion at the Akron Recycle Energy System plant caused the deaths of three people. Sawyer helped manage the aftermath of the tragedy and assisted in the investigation. Speaking to the New York Times, Sawyer noted that S&amp;W Waste, of Kearny, New Jersey, had sent the Akron plant waste materials containing highly flammable chemicals on the day of the explosions.

== United States Congress ==
Sawyer successfully ran for a seat in the U.S. Congress in the 1986 midterm elections and took office on January 3, 1987. He would then serve eight terms in Congress.

Congressman Sawyer gained notoriety as Chairman of the House subcommittee overseeing the 1990 U.S. census. He made national news with his study of the 1990 census and subsequent determination that it had failed to count at least two million black Americans. Sawyer and others attempted to readjust the census figures to include a more accurate count of black Americans and the U.S. population as a whole, but their efforts were opposed. When the Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher refused to adjust the census totals, Congressman Sawyer called the decision a &quot;gerrymander on a national scale.&quot; The national undercount in 1990 was eventually estimated to exclude around 1.6% of the population.

=== Notable votes ===
In 1993, Sawyer voted for President Bill Clinton&#x27;s federal budget bill. He voted against the Welfare Reform Act of 1996. Sawyer also voted against the impeachment of President Clinton. On the House floor during this debate, Sawyer quoted Sir Thomas More in defense of Clinton and in condemnation of the Congressional impeachment proceedings.

One of the most controversial votes cast by Tom Sawyer during his time in the U.S. House of Representatives was his vote for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Sawyer called his vote &quot;the toughest decision I&#x27;ve ever had to make in public life.&quot;

Sawyer voted against authorization for the deployment of United States armed forces in Iraq in 2002.

=== Exit from Congress ===

==== 2002 primary campaign ====
A round of redistricting following the 2000 census redrew Ohio&#x27;s congressional map. The state lost a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. A newly configured district, the 17th, placed large parts of Youngstown in the same district as parts of Akron. The new district most closely resembled the one recently vacated by U.S. Representative Jim Traficant, who had been convicted on corruption charges and sent to federal prison. Traficant&#x27;s protege, State Senator Tim Ryan, defeated Sawyer in a late upset. Sawyer outspent Ryan 6-1, but ultimately lost the election. Despite maintaining high pro-union ratings throughout his career, Sawyer&#x27;s vote for NAFTA is often credited at the reason Tim Ryan defeated the 8-term Congressman.

==== 2006 primary campaign ====

Sawyer again sought to return to Congress during the 2006 Democratic primary. He aimed to replace then-Congressman Sherrod Brown in the 13th district, after Brown vacated the seat to run for the U.S. Senate. However, former State Representative Betty Sutton won an 8-way primary and went on to win the general election with support from national Democrats and EMILY&#x27;s List.

==Ohio Senate==
When Akron-based State Senator Kim Zurz was appointed to run the Ohio Department of Commerce in Spring of 2007, Sawyer was selected by legislative leaders to fill the vacancy.

As a member of the Ohio Senate Controlling Board, Sawyer voted to adopt Medicaid expansion in Ohio. Ohio&#x27;s Medicaid expansion covered thousands of Ohioans who previously did not have insurance. The state share costs were offset by small insurance and sales taxes.

During the 130th and 131st General Assemblies, Sawyer jointly sponsored resolutions with Republican Senator Frank LaRose to reform the drawing of legislative district lines in Ohio. The House and Senate eventually passed a version of the senators&#x27; proposal and sent it to the Ohio voters as State Issue 1 in November 2015. The resolution passed with 71% of the vote. This law, once implemented, will end the practice of gerrymandering (partisan drawing of legislative district lines) for Ohio legislative districts. Senators Sawyer and LaRose at one time were working on a measure that would end gerrymandering at the Congressional level in Ohio as well.

During the 131st General Assembly, Senator Sawyer helped the legislature adopt House Bill 2, which was a version of Sawyer&#x27;s Senate Bill 148, to reform Ohio&#x27;s charter school oversight laws.

In the November 2008 general election, Sawyer held his Senate seat by defeating Republican James Carr.

In 2012, Sawyer was elected to a second full term, defeating Republican Robert Roush 71.5% to 28.5%. He served as Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee from 2012-14.

In 2015, he considered running again for Akron mayor after the abrupt resignation of longtime incumbent mayor Don Plusquellic. Sawyer eventually decided against the run.

Sawyer&#x27;s tenure in the Ohio Senate concluded at the end of 2016. The state&#x27;s term limit rules barred Sawyer from seeking the seat for a third consecutive term. He was replaced by Democrat Vernon Sykes.

== Personal life ==
Sawyer lived in Akron. He and his wife, the former Joyce Handler, had a daughter. He died from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease at a care facility in Akron on May 20, 2023, at the age of 77.

<doc id="767493" wikidata="Q1239865" url="?curid=767493" title="Huron River (Ohio)">
<text>The Huron River is a waterway in the north central Ohio in the United States. The watershed drains large portions of Erie County and Huron County, the northeast corners of Seneca County and Crawford County, and northern portions of Richland County.

The mouth is on Lake Erie at the city of Huron. The main branch of the river is formed when the East and West branches merge near Milan.

The East Branch, long, rises west of Fitchville and flows west to North Fairfield, where it bends north and flows through Peru and Norwalk before reaching Milan.

The West Branch is long. It rises about south of Greenwich and four miles east of Shiloh, near the intersection of Gilger Road and Noble Road in northern Richland County&#x27;s Blooming Grove Township. This is within a few miles of the headwaters of both the southwest branch of the Vermilion River (which also flows north to Lake Erie) and Shipp Creek, which is part of the Ohio River watershed via the Black Fork, Mohican, Walhonding, and Muskingum rivers. The West Branch of the Huron flows north and west from Blooming Grove Township through Huron County&#x27;s Ripley Township, then back into Richland County&#x27;s Cass Township and into Plymouth. It is here where the river bends north to flow across the Richland/Huron county line into Huron County&#x27;s New Haven Township and into New Haven. It passes to the east of Willard, although other tributaries rise north of Willard. Still in Huron County, the West Branch continues north through Greenfield Township, Peru Township, and Ridgefield Township. The West Branch continues north into Monroeville and through the balance of Ridgefield Township. Next, the river crosses from Huron County into Erie County and then bends in an easterly direction through southern Oxford Township before reaching the confluence with the East Branch in the Milan State Wildlife Area.

==Tributaries==
Note: Willard Marsh, within the Willard Marsh State Wildlife Area, feeds into both the West Branch of the Huron River and the Honey Creek tributary of the Sandusky River. Also, there are numerous creeks, streams, and ditches that are unnamed tributaries in the Huron River basin.

==Variant names==
According to the Geographic Names Information System, the Huron River has also been known as:
* Hurons River
* Notowacy Thepy [or Naudowessie Sipi ]
* Petquotting [a name adapted from the Moravian village here, 1787–1791.]
* Riviere Huron [or &quot;Riviere aux (Rx) Hurons&quot;]
* Bald Eagle Creek [named for a very large nest of bald-eagles at the river&#x27;s mouth, in the 1700s]
* Huron Creek

Similarly, the West and East branches have been referred to as the West and East forks.

* Also shown on early maps as named the &quot;Guahadahuri&quot;.
* The word &quot;Huron&quot; refers to a Native-American tribe who were also known as the Wyandots (sometimes spelled &quot;Wendots&quot; or &quot;Junundats&quot;). This tribe had many villages in the area of Sandusky Bay, in the latter-1700s.
The Huron River had been given that name by European explorers at least by 1778, when it appears as such on a map by Hutchins. A much earlier map, by Evans in 1755, names it as the &quot;Guahadahuri&quot;. (On that Evans map, because of the river&#x27;s significant depth and navigability even at that early time, it was the only river denoted between Sandusky Bay and the Cuyahoga, but accurately being approx. one-fifth of the distance between the two.) Also in 1755, Pennsylvanian James Smith, who had been captured by Native-Americans and brought to this river to live among them, recorded the river&#x27;s name as the &quot;Canesadooharie&quot;. We do not know whether &quot;guahadahuri&quot; or &quot;canesadooharie&quot; was the more phonetically accurate representation of a Native-American word, but the word&#x27;s translation seems lost to obscurity. In 1760, explorer George Croghan refers to the name of this river, also phonetically from its Native-American/Chippewa tribe name, as &quot;Notowacy Thepy&quot;; John Heckewelder recorded it as &quot;Naudowessie Sipi&quot;, meaning &quot;the River (&quot;sipi&quot;) of the Huron (&quot;Naudowessie&quot;) tribe&quot;. Some maps of the later-1700s also show the Huron River as &quot;Bald Eagle Creek&quot;; named for a large eagle&#x27;s nest at its mouth at that time (although one later mapmaker from that time, erroneously denoted &quot;Bald Eagle Creek&quot; and &quot;Guahadahuyi&quot; as being two separate rivers).
* In 1787, the Moravian missionary, David Zeisberger, led a group of Christian-converted Native-Americans from their settlement on the Cuyahoga River, to a new settlement called first Petquotting (but later named &#x27;New Salem&#x27; in 1790) on the Huron River, about 3 miles north of (now) Milan, Ohio. They remained until 1791 when forced by local Native-American unrest, they relocated to Canada; but in 1804, some of the Christian-converted Natives, under the direction of G.S. Oppelt, returned to a new different settlement here (also named Petquotting) and it eventually became the village of Milan, Ohio.
* Throughout the latter-1700s, the northern part of the river was a well-known outpost for many French-Canadian traders, including Gabriel Hunot who ran an Indian-trading-post there in the 1780s, and the later John B. Flammand (or &quot;Flemming&quot;) about 1805. ---

<doc id="767502" wikidata="Q1385763" url="?curid=767502" title="Bob Ney">
<text>Robert William Ney (born July 5, 1954) is an American former politician who represented Ohio&#x27;s 18th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 until his resignation on November 3, 2006, after he pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and making false statements in relation to the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal. Before he pleaded guilty, Ney was identified in the guilty pleas of Jack Abramoff, former Tom DeLay deputy chief of staff Tony Rudy, former DeLay press secretary Michael Scanlon and former Ney chief of staff Neil Volz for receiving lavish gifts in exchange for political favors.

A Republican, Ney&#x27;s best-known congressional work was on the election reform efforts founded in the wake of the confused 2000 voting in Florida, and his support and backing for the &quot;Stand Up For Steel&quot; crusade and resulting laws. From 2001 to 2006, Ney was Chairman of the House Administration Committee. As chair of that committee, he oversaw operations in the Capitol complex and was sometimes known as the &quot;Mayor of Capitol Hill&quot;.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Ney was born in Wheeling, West Virginia. The son of a TV cameraman for WTRF-TV, Ney grew up in Bellaire, Ohio, an industrial town across the Ohio River from Wheeling. He graduated in 1972 from St. John&#x27;s High School in Bellaire. He attended Ohio University Eastern Campus in Belmont County before transferring to Ohio State University in Columbus. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from OSU in 1976.

After college, he worked at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, taught English in Iran, served as Bellaire safety director, and worked as the health and education program manager of the Ohio Office of Appalachia.

He has two children from a previous marriage, and no children with his second wife, Elizabeth.

==Early political career==
In 1980, at the age of 26, Ney defeated state Representative Wayne Hays, a former U.S. representative who had resigned from Congress in 1976 after a sex scandal. Ney served in the Ohio House of Representatives from 1981 to 1983. He was defeated in his reelection bid in November 1982.

After his defeat, Ney managed a home security company in Saudi Arabia. He was appointed to the Ohio Senate in 1984 to replace former state senator Sam Speck, who resigned the 20th District seat to accept a presidential appointment. Ney won the seat in November 1984 and then re-election in 1988 and 1992.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;1994
In November 1994, Ney decided to run for Ohio&#x27;s 18th congressional district after nine-term incumbent Democrat Douglas Applegate announced his retirement. Ney won the six-candidate Republican primary field with 69% of the vote. The 18th had a considerable Democratic lean, but Ney scored a considerable upset, defeating Democratic State Representative Greg DiDonato 54%–46%.

;1996

In 1996, he won re-election to a second term, defeating Democratic State Senator Rob Burch 50%–46%.

;1998–2004
He went on to win re-election four more times easily without difficult competition in 1998 (60%), 2000 (64%), 2002 (unopposed), and 2004 (66%).

;2006
On January 26, 2006, Ney announced his candidacy for re-election to a seventh term. Even before his indictment, Ney was one of the Republican elected officials whom Democrats highlighted as part of a &quot;culture of corruption&quot; in the 2006 campaign.

For the first time since 1994, he drew a primary challenger. Republican James Brodbelt Harris, a financial analyst from Zanesville, Ohio, decided to challenge him in 2006. Harris did not campaign, and collected less than $5,000 in campaign contributions. On May 2, 2006, Ney defeated him 68%–32%. On the day of the election, Greg Giroux of &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot; noted: &quot;I&#x27;d be surprised if Harris got more than 20 or 25 percent. That would be a sign that there is a chunk of the Republican base that&#x27;s disenchanted with the incumbent.&quot; Commenting on his situation after the primary, Ney said &quot;I have a healthy campaign account, in contrast to the Democratic Party, which is deeply divided and has a candidate with almost no campaign cash.&quot;

Ney&#x27;s opponent in the November general election was to be Zack Space, a Dover, Ohio lawyer and hotel developer. As of July 2006, Space was considered to be slightly ahead of Ney, with a large percentage of undecided voters. For the first three months of 2006, Ney blamed legal costs for causing his re-election campaign to spend more than it raised. For the April–June period, it was unusually intense campaigning in his rural district that caused the six-term incumbent to spend $52,675 more than donors gave him in the last three months, he said.

On August 7, 2006, state senator Joy Padgett announced that Ney was withdrawing his candidacy in the 2006 election, and that Ney and House Majority Leader John Boehner had asked her to run in his place. Later that day, Ney confirmed in an interview with the &quot;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review&quot; that he would not run for re-election to a seventh term, but intended to serve out his term until January 2007. About his future plans, Ney said &quot;I have some options in the nongovernment sector.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot;&quot; reported that Boehner met with Ney in early August &quot;to urge him to step aside, reminding him that with a son in college and a daughter nearing college age, he will need money. [...] If he lost his House seat for the party, Boehner is said to have cautioned, Ney could not expect a lucrative career on K Street to pay those tuition bills, along with the hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees piling up.&quot; On August 14, 2006, Ney officially withdrew from the race. Because that occurred before August 19 (80 or more days before the election), Ohio Revised Code 3513.312 applied: &quot;the vacancy in the party nomination so created shall be filled by a special election&quot;. If Ney had waited until August 20, section 3513.31 of the Ohio Revised Code would have pertained: Ney&#x27;s replacement in the November general election would be named by a district committee of the Ohio Republican party.

The special election was held on September 14, and was won by State Senator Joy Padgett with just under half of the fewer than 1600 votes cast.

It is widely believed that Ney&#x27;s delay in resigning cost Padgett any chance of keeping the seat in Republican hands, as she was routed by Space 62% to 38%.

===Tenure===
Ney&#x27;s voting record was less fiscally conservative, and more protectionist, than the median amongst Republicans elected in 1994. He did not earn a rating in the 90s from the American Conservative Union until 2004. He was known for bucking his party&#x27;s leadership on issues important to his mostly blue-collar district, such as championing the needs of the beleaguered steel industry. In 1999, he was a prominent part of the &quot;Stand Up for Steel&quot; campaign, which united the steel industry and steel unions in a fight against low-priced imports. In 2000, he was one of a handful of Republicans who backed an effort to block permanent normal trade status for China. In 2001, Ney was one of three Republicans to vote against the USA Patriot Act (the other two were Butch Otter of Idaho and Ron Paul of Texas). In late 2001, Ney introduced the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) for election reform. In 2005, he voted against President Bush&#x27;s Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) and against Republican budget cuts to Medicaid and after-school programs.

====Freedom Fries====

Ney also gained notoriety when he mandated, as Chairman of the House Administration Committee, that &quot;French fries&quot; be renamed &quot;freedom fries&quot; on House of Representatives food service menus, to indicate displeasure with France&#x27;s lack of support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Ney led the effort, along with fellow Republican U.S. Congressman Walter B. Jones, to change the names of &quot;French fries&quot; and &quot;French toast&quot; to &quot;freedom fries&quot; and &quot;freedom toast&quot;. His committee had authority over House cafeterias. Ney said at a press conference that &quot;this action today is a small, but symbolic effort to show the strong displeasure of many on Capitol Hill with the actions of our so-called ally, France.&quot; Ney did not comment about the opposition to the U.S. and British-led invasion and occupation coming from other nations such as Russia and Germany. In July 2006, after Ney had left the committee, the names were changed back; Ney had no comment.

====Abramoff scandal timeline====

;November 2005
Ney was subpoenaed in the investigation in November 2005. Michael Scanlon pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe a member of Congress, identified as Ney, and other public officials. In the agreement, Scanlon admitted to bribing Ney in return for, among other things, the following (described in more detail below):
*Ney&#x27;s placing statements in the Congressional Record relating to the SunCruz Casinos scandal;
*Ney&#x27;s using his position to attempt to endorse and support a client of Abramoff&#x27;s as a provider of a wireless telephone infrastructure to the House of Representatives;
*Ney&#x27;s agreement to introduce and seek passage of legislation that would lift an existing federal ban against commercial gaming for two different Native American tribes in Texas (clients of Abramoff);
*Ney&#x27;s agreement to assist legislation to financially benefit a California tribe.

;January 2006
On January 3, 2006, Abramoff pleaded guilty to three felony counts involving charges stemming principally from his lobbying activities in Washington on behalf of Native American tribes. One of the cases of bribery described in the plea agreement detail involves a person identified as &quot;Representative #1&quot;. Ney&#x27;s spokesman confirmed that Ney is Representative #1.

A press release from the Department of Justice describes the particulars:

:Abramoff also admitted that as one means of accomplishing results for their clients, he, Scanlon, and others engaged in a pattern of corruptly providing things of value to public officials, including trips, campaign contributions, and meals and entertainment, with the intent to influence acts by the public officials that would benefit Abramoff and Abramoff’s clients. For example, Abramoff and Scanlon provided things of value to a public official (described as Representative #1) and members of his staff, including, but not limited to, a lavish trip to Scotland to play golf on world-famous courses, tickets to sporting events and other entertainment, regular meals at Abramoff’s upscale restaurant, and campaign contributions for the Representative, his political action committee, his campaign committee, and other political committees on behalf of the Representative. At the same time, and in exchange for these things of value, Scanlon and Abramoff sought and received the Representative’s agreement to perform directly and through others a series of official acts, including but not limited to agreements to support and pass legislation, and agreements to place statements in the Congressional Record.

Ney said in a statement that &quot;At the time I dealt with Jack Abramoff, I obviously did not know, and had no way of knowing, the self-serving and fraudulent nature of Abramoff&#x27;s activities&quot;. Ney spokesman Brian Walsh said that any official actions Ney had taken were based on &quot;the merits and facts of the situation and not because of any improper influence from Jack Abramoff or anybody else&quot;.

On January 15, 2006, Ney resigned as chairman of the House Administration Committee. He maintained that he had done nothing wrong, but had been under increasing pressure to stand down since his ties to Abramoff were an increasing embarrassment in light of Republican plans for reforms of lobbying and campaign finance rules. The House Administration Committee has jurisdiction over elections and lobbyists. House Speaker Dennis Hastert reportedly emailed a &quot;Roll Call&quot; article regarding Ney&#x27;s precarious hold on the gavel to several Capitol beat reporters. Ney&#x27;s resignation was officially temporary. However, even some of his Republican colleagues expected him to be indicted. Under Republican caucus rules, he would have permanently lost his chairmanship if indicted.

Abramoff&#x27;s plea agreement also details his practice of hiring former congressional staffers. Abramoff used these persons&#x27; influence to lobby their former Congressional employers, in violation of a one-year federal ban on such lobbying. Named in the Department of Justice indictment are two Abramoff colleagues, &quot;Staffer A&quot; and &quot;Staffer B&quot;, who are Tony Rudy and Ney&#x27;s former chief of staff, Neil Volz (who left Ney&#x27;s office to work as a lobbyist for Barnes &amp; Thornburg) respectively.

;May 2006
On May 8, 2006, Volz pleaded guilty to conspiring to corrupt public officials and violating lobbying rules. &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; described the plea agreement:

:In court documents filed as part of Volz&#x27;s plea agreement, prosecutors said that he and others at Greenberg Traurig offered trips, tickets to sporting events and numerous meals at Abramoff&#x27;s restaurants to Ney. In 2003, Volz paid for part of a two-night trip to the Sagamore Resort in Lake George, New York, for Ney and members of his staff, prosecutors said.

:Ney, for his part, agreed to help Abramoff clients with acts such as inserting language into legislation that would lift a gaming ban hurting one of the tribes, prosecutors said. The court documents also describe conversations in which Volz told Ney what Abramoff wanted him to say in meetings with the tribal client.

On May 18, 2006, the House Ethics Committee announced an investigation into bribery allegations against Ney. Will Heaton, his chief of staff, was subpoenaed.

;June 2006
The federal grand jury issued a subpoena to Matthew D. Parker, Ney&#x27;s campaign manager. On June 29, 2006, three of Ney&#x27;s staffers resigned: Brian Walsh, a longtime Ney spokesman; Will Heaton, Ney’s chief of staff; and Chris Otillio, a senior legislative aide. In a statement, Ney said that Congressional staff turnover is high, and that all three departing staff members had worked for him longer than many others stay in similar jobs.

;July 2006
John Bennett, a staffer in Ney&#x27;s district office, received a subpoena.

;September 2006
On September 15, 2006, the Justice Department filed Ney&#x27;s guilty pleas to a charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States and to a charge of falsifying financial disclosure forms. Both charges are related to actions taken on behalf of Abramoff&#x27;s clients in exchange for bribes, as well as separate actions taken on behalf of a foreign businessman in exchange for over $50,000 in gambling sprees at foreign private casinos. In four separate guilty pleas, Jack Abramoff, former DeLay deputy chief of staff Tony Rudy, former DeLay press secretary Michael Scanlon and former Ney chief of staff Neil Volz all said Ney had used his position to grant favors to the Abramoff lobbying team in exchange for gifts, including a free trip to the Super Bowl, Northern Marianas Islands, Scotland, the use of luxury boxes at sporting events, and concerts and meals. Ney is the first member of Congress to admit to criminal charges in the Abramoff investigation, which has focused on the actions of several current and former Republican lawmakers who had been close to the former lobbyist. Ney announced he was entering inpatient treatment for rehabilitation and was entering a guilty plea to federal corruption charges related to the Abramoff scandal. He admitted to making &quot;serious mistakes&quot; and stated that, after helping people for his entire political career, it was he who needed the help now.

;October 2006
On October 13, Ney officially pleaded guilty before U.S. District Court Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle. He issued a statement saying that he was &quot;ashamed&quot; that he had to end his career as a public servant in such a fashion.

Ney did not immediately resign from the House, even though under House rules he would not have been able to vote or participate in any committee work during the chamber&#x27;s &quot;lame duck&quot; session in December. He claimed that he had outstanding work to finish in his congressional office. Also, several officials said that he was in severe financial straits and needed to continue drawing his congressional salary for as long as possible. The four highest-ranking members of the Republican House leadership—Hastert, Boehner, Majority Whip Roy Blunt and House Republican Conference Chairwoman Deborah Pryce—issued a joint statement demanding that Ney resign before the lame duck session. If he didn&#x27;t do so, they said, they would make a resolution to expel him the first order of business at the lame duck session.

On November 3, four days before the general election, Ney submitted his resignation to Hastert.

William Heaton, Chief of Staff for to Rep. Bob Ney also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit fraud. admitting to conspiring with Ney, Jack Abramoff and others to accept vacations, meals, tickets, and contributions to Ney&#x27;s campaign in exchange for Ney benefitting Abramoff&#x27;s clients.(2006)

====SunCruz Casinos Scandal====
Ney is also implicated in the separate Abramoff SunCruz Casinos scandal. The conduct alleged is that Ney twice entered statements into the Congressional Record at Scanlon&#x27;s request in exchange for a $10,000 contribution.

In March 2000, before a deal for Abramoff and others to purchase SunCruz was closed, Ney entered the following comments into the Congressional Record that were critical of the management of SunCruz: &quot;Mr. Speaker, how SunCruz Casinos and Gus Boulis conduct themselves with regard to Florida laws is very unnerving. Florida authorities have repeatedly reprimanded SunCruz Casinos and its owner Gus Boulis for taking illegal bets, not paying their customers properly and had to take steps to prevent SunCruz from conducting operations altogether.&quot; It is alleged that this statement was intended to pressure SunCruz to sell to Abramoff on terms favorable to the latter.

The second time was in October 2000. It is alleged that Ney, like other Republicans in the House, was under pressure to raise money for the Republican National Congressional Committee (RNCC) in October 2000, a month prior to the November elections. In an October 23 e-mail from Abramoff to Scanlon, Abramoff asked &quot;Would 10K for NRCC from Suncruz for Ney help?&quot; Scanlon replied, &quot;Yes, a lot! But would have to give them a definite answer—and they need it this week&quot;.

====Indian gambling====
Ney introduced legislation that would allow the Tiguas Indians to reopen their casino after receiving $32,000 in donations to his PAC and campaign from the tribe.

In March 2002, Abramoff e-mailed Marc Schwartz, a consultant for the Tiguas, instructing him to donate to Rep. Ney&#x27;s campaign. The tribe donated $2,000 to the campaign and $30,000 to Ney&#x27;s PAC. Scanlon e-mailed Abramoff on March 20, 2002 to tell him that he had signed up Rep. Bob Ney to attach a provision allowing the Tiguas to have gaming rights to the Help Americans Vote Act, which Ney had co-authored: &quot;just met with Ney!!! We&#x27;re f&#x27;ing gold!!!! He&#x27;s going to do Tigua.&quot; (Former Ney Chief of Staff Neil Volz, now an Abramoff employee, made the appeal to Ney&#x27;s staff while still subject to the one-year lobbying ban).

According to testimony by Tigua representatives, Abramoff set up a lengthy meeting between tribal representatives and Ney in Ney&#x27;s office in August 2002, as well as a conference call, and Ney assured them he was working to insert language that would reopen their casino into an unrelated election reform bill. Ney&#x27;s attorney reported that he found a calendar reference indicating that Ney had had a meeting with the &quot;Taqua&quot;.

Ultimately, the Tiguas casino language did not become law. Abramoff, Scanlon, and Ney had promised the tribe that the provision would win Senate support from Senator Christopher Dodd. Dodd said that he never supported the amendment. The Tiguas then claimed they were defrauded—by Abramoff, Scanlon, and Ney.

In November 2004, Ney told Senate investigators that &quot;he was not at all familiar with the Tigua&quot; and could not recall meeting with members of the tribe. Brian Walsh, a spokesman for Ney, said in June 2006 that the congressman&#x27;s meeting with the committee &quot;was a voluntary meeting—it was not conducted under oath&quot;.

====License to a telecommunications firm====
Ney, as chairman of the House Administration Committee, approved a 2002 license for an Israeli telecommunications company to install equipment to improve cell phone reception in the Capitol and adjacent House office buildings, equipment that would generate significant revenue for the firm. The company, then Foxcom Wireless, an Israeli start-up telecommunications firm, (which has since moved headquarters from Jerusalem to Vienna, Va., and been renamed MobileAccess Networks) later paid Abramoff $280,000 for lobbying. It also donated $50,000 to Abramoff&#x27;s Capital Athletic Foundation, a non-profit organization that Abramoff used to redistribute money for personal and political gain.

A spokesman for Ney claimed that wireless providers had voted for Foxcom in secret ballots, but spokesmen for each of the six wireless companies told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; they had remained neutral in the selection process. Ney refused to make public a copy of documents relating to the agreement.

====Involvement in U.S. sanctions on arms sales to Iran====
In the late 1970s, Ney went to Iran to teach English. Since then, he has maintained an active interest in Iranian affairs and was the only member of Congress fluent in Persian.

In January 2006, &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported that Ney&#x27;s lawyer confirmed that federal prosecutors have subpoenaed records on an expenses paid February 2003 trip to London that Ney took along with former U.S. lobbyists, Roy Coffee and David DiStefano. The trip was paid for by &quot;Nigel Winfield, a thrice-convicted felon who ran a company in Cyprus called FN Aviation. Winfield was seeking to sell U.S.-made airplane spare parts to the Iranian government—a deal that would have needed special permits because of U.S. sanctions against Tehran&quot;, and that &quot;Ney personally lobbied the then Secretary of State Colin Powell to relax U.S. sanctions on Iran.&quot;

Syrian businessman Fouad al-Zayat, who was responsible for managing the transaction on behalf of the Iranian military, was also identified for bribing Ney for his lobbying efforts.

====Legal fees====
A filing with Federal Election Commission in October said that Ney had paid the law firm Vinson &amp; Elkins $136,000 from July through September, from campaign funds. By early January 2006, the total legal expenses paid by Ney&#x27;s political campaign committee had risen to $232,381. For the January to March 2006 reporting period, Ney paid an additional $96,000 in legal fees from campaign funds to that law firm; total campaign spending for the period was $250,000. The legal fees are related to an ongoing federal investigation (see below.)

Brian Walsh, spokesman for Ney, said in April 2006: &quot;Frankly, it&#x27;s an unfortunate commentary on the justice system that someone has to spend a lot of money simply to clear their name and set the record straight in what is in this case completely false allegations.&quot; He also said that &quot;the congressman is doing everything possible and moving as quickly as possible to put these allegations to rest and clear his name.&quot;

In a Federal Election Commission filing showing expenses through the end of June 2006, Ney reported that he had not paid any legal fees since January 5 from campaign funds. Mark Tuohey, the lead lawyer at Vinson &amp; Elkins, said Ney &quot;needs money for his campaign and that&#x27;s a priority right now. He intends to pay. He&#x27;ll pay his fees, I have no doubt about that.&quot;

In November 2005, it was reported that Ney had set up a legal defense fund for himself in connection with the Abramoff case. Documents filed in the House in January 2006 showed that the Ethics Committee had approved the organization papers for the fund. The fund raised $40,000 between January and March 2006, and nothing between April and June 2006. The fund did not spend any money for Ney&#x27;s legal expenses. Ney&#x27;s withdrawal from the race (see below) meant that he could use his remaining campaign funds (almost half a million dollars) for his legal defense.

===Committee assignments===

==Post-congressional life==

===Resignation===
On November 3, 2006, facing an impending expulsion vote, Ney resigned from the House of Representatives by his letter of resignation to Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert.

===Sentencing===
On January 19, 2007, Ney was sentenced to a 30 months in prison, ordered to pay a $6,000 fine and provide 200 hours of community service. On the orders of Judge Ellen Huvalle, Ney reported to Federal Correctional Institution, Morgantown in Morgantown, West Virginia on March 1, 2007. He shared a space in the prison with former &quot;Survivor&quot; star Richard Hatch, a Morgantown inmate serving 51 months for failing to pay taxes.

===After prison===
He was released on August 15, 2008 after serving 17 months. After his prison term Ney was required to be on probation for two years. The judge also barred Ney, an admitted alcoholic, from drinking during his probation and ordered him to undergo counseling.

In April 2009, Ney started the &quot;Bob Ney Radio Show&quot;, a talk show on West Virginia radio station WVLY (AM).

In March 2013, Ney released his memoir, &quot;Sideswiped: Lessons Learned Courtesy of the Hit Men of Capitol Hill.&quot;

Ney served as political analyst for Talk Media News until ceasing operations in 2020. Ney regularly appears remotely on the Thom Hartmann Program.

==Electoral history==
*While Ney won the Republican primary in 2006, he withdrew on August 14, 2006 due to his legal problems. Padgett won the special primary that followed.

<text>Marv Newland (March 9, 1947) is an American-Canadian filmmaker, specialized in animation.

==Career==

Newland began a career making animated motion pictures in Los Angeles with the creation of the short &quot;Bambi Meets Godzilla&quot; (1969). He then designed and animated television commercials until late 1970 when he moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

While in Toronto (1970–1972), he designed, directed, and animated television commercials for Sesame Street and Educational Television, and segments for longer films. Newland was also one of two designers and storyboard artists on the Cinera Productions cartoon &quot;Super Joe&quot; (1971). He was a storyboard designer on an unemployment insurance film at Crawley Films in Ottawa, and created designs and layouts for TV commercials for Phos-Cine Productions in New York.

In late 1972, Newland moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. He spent two years freelancing for local animated film production companies, as well as animation companies in Chicago and Los Angeles. In 1973, Newland created storyboards for the animated television series &quot;Barbapapa&quot; while at Toonder Studios in the Netherlands.

In 1973, &quot;Bambi Meets Godzilla&quot; was seen widely across the United States when it was paired with John Magnuson&#x27;s &quot;Thank You Mask Man&quot; to be shown along with screenings of Philippe de Broca&#x27;s feature film &quot;King of Hearts&quot;. The pairing was created by Randy Finley in Seattle with Specialty Films who distributed the package under the title &quot;The King of Hearts and His Loyal Short Subjects&quot;.

In 1975, Newland founded the animated film production company International Rocketship Limited in Vancouver, British Columbia. At Rocketship he produced and directed numerous animated short films, including: &quot;Sing Beast Sing&quot; (1980), &quot;Anijam&quot; (1984), &quot;Hooray for Sandbox Land&quot; (1985), &quot;Black Hula&quot; (1988 - which later featured on an early episode of Liquid Television), &quot;Pink Komkommer&quot; (1991), and &quot;Fuv&quot; (1999) Beijing Flipbook (2003), Tete A Tete A Tete (2005), Postalolio (2008), CMYK (2010), Scratchy (2016), Katalog Of Flaws (2019). In 1979, Marv hired Gordon Stanfield Animation (GSA) and later, Gordon went on to bring more animation to Vancouver, British Columbia. The company also produced short animated films for other directors such as Danny Antonucci (&quot;Lupo the Butcher&quot;, 1987), and J. Falconer (&quot;Dog Brain&quot;, 1988). Newland also designed and directed the National Film Board of Canada vignette, &quot;Bill Miner&quot; (1978).

Rocketship also produced TV commercials, promos, and network IDs for clients like MTV, YTV, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop, Lifetime, HA! TV Comedy Network, TV Heaven 41, MuchMusic, and Locomotion, pilots for series, and two longer films: &quot;Gary Larson&#x27;s Tales From the Far Side&quot; (1994), which won the Grand Prix at the Annecy International Animation Festival in 1996, and a sequel in 1996.

Outside of Rocketship, Newland has freelanced for other animation companies. This work includes directing episodes of the 3D stop motion series, &quot;The PJ&#x27;s&quot;, for Will Vinton Studios in Portland, Oregon; &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Life&quot; (1999); &quot;Fear of a Black Rat&quot; (1999); and &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Ready to Rumba&quot; (2001). Newland also created story boards for the Montreal and Vancouver studios of the National Film Board of Canada (1999–2000).

In 2001, Newland produced three animated films by two other directors; &quot;Friday Night Idiot Box&quot; by Bruce Wilson, and &quot;Explodium&quot; and &quot;My Friend Max&quot; by Peter MacAdams. Later projects have included &quot;Scratchy&quot; and &quot;POSTALOLIO&quot; (2008), a 2D animated film in which all of the drawings were hand-painted on postcards and sent through the international mail to the film&#x27;s producer, Frederator Studios in New York City. All of these are International Rocketship Limited Productions.

His film &quot;Anijam&quot; was included in the Animation Show of Shows.

The Academy Film Archive has preserved several of Marv Newland&#x27;s films, including &quot;Anijam&quot;, &quot;Bambi Meets Godzilla&quot;, and Black Hula.

<doc id="767511" wikidata="Q2414478" url="?curid=767511" title="The Student Prince">
<text>The Student Prince is an operetta in a prologue and four acts with music by Sigmund Romberg and book and lyrics by Dorothy Donnelly. It is based on Wilhelm Meyer-Förster&#x27;s play &quot;Old Heidelberg&quot;. The piece has a score with some of Romberg&#x27;s most enduring and beautiful tunes, including &quot;Golden Days&quot;, &quot;Drinking Song&quot;, &quot;Deep in My Heart, Dear&quot;, &quot;Just We Two&quot; and &quot;Serenade&quot; (&quot;Overhead the moon is beaming&quot;). The plot has elements of melodrama but lacks the swashbuckling style common to Romberg&#x27;s other works.

==Performance history==
It opened on December 2, 1924, at Jolson&#x27;s 59th Street Theatre on Broadway and became the most successful of Romberg&#x27;s works, running for 608 performances. It was staged by J. C. Huffman and was the longest-running Broadway show of the 1920s. Even the classic &quot;Show Boat&quot;, the most enduring musical of the 1920s, did not play as long – it ran for 572 performances. &quot;Drinking Song&quot;, with its rousing chorus of &quot;Drink! Drink! Drink!&quot; was especially popular with theatergoers in 1924, as the United States was in the midst of Prohibition.

Ernst Lubitsch made a silent film also based on Förster&#x27;s work, titled &quot;The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg&quot;, starring Ramón Novarro and Norma Shearer. Its orchestral score did not use any of Romberg&#x27;s score, although it did include &quot;Gaudeamus igitur&quot;. The operetta was revived twice on Broadway – once in 1931 and again in 1943. Mario Lanza&#x27;s performance on the soundtrack of the 1954 MGM film &quot;The Student Prince&quot; renewed the popularity of many of the songs. Composer Nicholas Brodszky and lyricist Paul Francis Webster wrote three new songs for the film. Two of these songs – &quot;I&#x27;ll Walk with God&quot; and &quot;Beloved&quot;, as well as &quot;Serenade&quot; – became closely associated with Lanza, although the role was played on screen by British actor Edmund Purdom, who mimed to Lanza&#x27;s recordings. The operetta was revived in the 1970s and 1980s by the Light Opera of Manhattan and in 1988 by New York City Opera. The operetta was performed each summer at the Heidelberg Castle Festival for several decades beginning in 1974.

==Synopsis==
===Prologue===
Prince Karl Franz is heir to the (fictitious) German kingdom of Karlsberg. He has grown up fatherless, under rather gloomy military conditions of castle life (&quot;By Our Bearing So Sedate&quot;). He has been educated by tutors, in particular, kindly Doctor Engel, who has taught him the songs of his &quot;alma mater&quot;, the venerable University of Heidelberg (&quot;Golden Days&quot;). Karl Franz has been promised in marriage, since childhood, to the Princess Margaret (Johanna in some versions), but he has never met her. His grandfather, King Ferdinand, sends him to the university incognito, to live as an ordinary student, and improve his social skills. Karl Franz sets off under the watchful eye of Doctor Engel, accompanied by his snooty valet Lutz, who has his own assistant, Hubert.

===Act 1===
At Heidelberg, Herr Ruder keeps the rustic Inn of Three Gold Apples (&quot;Garlands Bright&quot;). His beautiful niece Kathie waits tables in the inn&#x27;s beer-garden. The inn is very popular with the students, who go there to drink and sing (&quot;Drink! Drink! Drink!&quot;). Karl Franz, the finicky Lutz and Hubert arrive for the spring term and take rooms at the Three Gold Apples, to the delight of Engel and the disgust of Lutz (&quot;Entrance of the Prince in Heidelberg&quot;). Karl falls in love, almost at first sight, with Kathie, who returns his affection (&quot;Deep in My Heart, Dear&quot;). But he is a royal heir, and she is a commoner.

Karl Franz also makes friends with three students, Detlef, Lucas and von Asterberg, and shares the camaraderie of student life, with nights of enthusiastic drinking and singing. He joins their student corps (&quot;Finale act 1&quot;).

===Act 2===
As the term passes, Karl Franz and his friends continue to enjoy student life (&quot;Farmer Jacob Lay-a-Snoring&quot;, &quot;Students&#x27; Life&quot;). By the end of the term, Karl Franz and Kathie are deeply in love.

But then Karl Franz receives a surprise visit from Princess Margaret and her mother. They bring news that the king is ill and commands the prince to return home for the ceremony of betrothal to the princess. After they leave, Karl Franz and Kathie consider eloping to Paris. But Doctor Engel and Count Von Mark (the prime minister of Karlsberg) remind the prince of his duty to his kingdom. Karl Franz reluctantly agrees to obey the king&#x27;s command. He promises Kathie that he will return soon (&quot;Finale act 2&quot;).

===Act 3===
Back in Karlsberg, two years pass, with Karl Franz unable to return to Heidelberg. His grandfather has died, and Karl Franz is now King. His life is bound up in court ceremony (&quot;Opening act 3&quot;). Princess Margaret has also had a secret relationship with another man, Captain Tarnitz (&quot;Just We Two&quot;). But as King, Karl Franz must honor the betrothal to Margaret (&quot;Gavotte&quot;). Margaret knows that Karl Franz has long pined for an old love, and she has heard rumors that in Heidelberg, he fell in love with a tavernkeeper&#x27;s niece.

Word arrives from Heidelberg that Doctor Engel has died there. Karl Franz is persuaded to visit Heidelberg for a brief reunion with his old friends, and he hopes to see Kathie again (&quot;What Memories/Finale act 3&quot;).

===Act 4===
Princess Margaret goes to Heidelberg first, and secretly visits Kathie. Margaret persuades her that for the good of the kingdom, she must break off with Karl Franz. They agree that Kathie will tell Karl Franz she is in love with another man and is going to marry him. Karl Franz will then finally be free to accept Margaret, who has come to love him. Meanwhile, the students of Heidelberg continue their merry ways (&quot;Let Us Sing a Song&quot;, &quot;To the Inn We&#x27;re Marching, &quot;Overhead the Moon is Beaming &quot;, &quot;Come Boys&quot;).

Karl Franz arrives, meets his old friends and visits Kathie. True to her promise, she tells him of her fictitious new love and plans to marry. Karl Franz resolves to marry Margaret without further delay, but Kathie will always be his true love (&quot;Deep in My Heart Dear (reprise)&quot;).

==Recordings==
There are quite a few recordings of this score, though most date from the 1950s. No original Broadway cast recording was made, but the 1926 London cast did record some selections for EMI. These 78-RPM records have been transferred to CD on the Pearl Label. Earl Wrightson starred in Al Goodman&#x27;s recording for RCA Victor. This has not been released on CD. The last issue was on the budget label Camden in 1958.

Decca made an album in 1950 with Lauritz Melchior heading the cast in eight selections. This is on CD paired with &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;. A more complete recording starring Robert Rounseville and Dorothy Kirsten was made by Columbia Records in 1952 and has been re-released on CD. Around the same time, Gordon MacRae recorded a 10-inch Lp of the score for Capitol. It was later repackaged on one side of a 12-inch album (&quot;The Merry Widow&quot; is on the reverse) but that album has been out-of-print since the late 1960s.

RCA Victor recorded Mario Lanza in highlights from the score, released when the singer&#x27;s voice was used in the 1954 film version. Lanza later re-recorded the score in stereo for the same label, but it is the earlier mono recording that is on CD paired with selections from &quot;The Desert Song&quot;.

&quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; include a selection in their album &quot;A Treasury of Great Operettas&quot;, first offered for sale in 1963. This stereo recording is available on CD. Also in 1963, as part of a series of stereo recordings of classic operettas, Capitol had MacRae and Kirsten record a full album of the score. Most of it can be heard on the EMI CD &quot;Music of Sigmund Romberg&quot; along with selections from &quot;The Desert Song&quot; and &quot;The New Moon&quot;. Around the same time, Columbia made a new stereo recording with Giorgio Tozzi, Jan Peerce and Roberta Peters. This has not been issued on CD.

The most complete recording is a 2-CD set from That&#x27;s Entertainment (TER/JAY) that includes much of the underscoring.

A recording was released by CPO in 2012 with WDR Rundfunkchor Köln and WDR Funkhausorchester Köln, conducted by John Mauceri. Dominik Wortig sings Karl-Franz, Anja Petersen is Kathie, Frank Blees is Dr. Engel, Theresa Nelles is Princess Margaret and Christian Sturm is Captain Tarnitz.

== Influence ==
The operetta was influential in its portrayal of European Studentenverbindungen (student fraternities). The historian Marianne Rachel Sanua wrote:
[T]he model of the Central European student fraternity, which included beer-drinking, good fellowship, heated discussion, and physical recreation as well as political activity, had its appeal to American young men, especially those who had the opportunity to study in the universities of Germany, Austria, or Czechoslovakia. Novels and the popular operetta &quot;The Student Prince&quot;, set in the German university town of Heidelberg, fixed in the public mind the heroism, joys, and glamour of European student fraternity life.

<doc id="767512" wikidata="Q2053607" url="?curid=767512" title="Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium">
<text>Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium is the second live album by the American rock band Rage Against the Machine, released on November 25, 2003, by Epic Records. It is a recording of two shows Rage played at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in their hometown of Los Angeles on September 12 and 13, 2000. The album was originally planned to be released in November 2000, but was delayed due to the break-up of the band shortly after the September concerts. It was then slated for release a year later, but was again delayed due to the formation of Audioslave by the remaining three members of Rage (Tom Morello, Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk) with vocalist Chris Cornell. The album was released amid mixed reviews in November 2003, mainly due to poor mixing rather than musical performance, where on the other hand the DVD version was praised by fans and critics alike.

<doc id="767516" wikidata="Q2068000" url="?curid=767516" title="Sanzu River">
<text>The is a mythological river in Japanese Buddhist tradition similar to the Chinese concept of Huang Quan (Yellow Springs), Indian concept of the Vaitarani and Greek concept of the Styx. 

Before reaching the afterlife, the souls of the deceased must cross the river by one of three crossing points: a bridge, a ford, or a stretch of deep, snake-infested waters. The weight of one&#x27;s offenses while alive determines which path an individual must take. It is believed that a toll of six mon must be paid before a soul can cross the river, a belief reflected in Japanese funerals when the necessary fee is placed in the casket with the dead.

The &quot;Sanzu River&quot; is popularly believed to be in Mount Osore, a suitably desolate and remote part of Aomori Prefecture in northern Japan. 

Similarly to the &quot;Sanzu-no-Kawa&quot;, there is also the , a boundary by which the souls of children who died too early cross over to the realm of the Dead, with the help of &quot;Jizō-bosatsu&quot; (Bohdisattva Jizō) who helps the souls of children who died too early to avoid the attentions of the &quot;Oni&quot;. In the Sai-no-kawara, it is said that there is &quot;Datsueba&quot; (alias &quot;Shozuka-no-Baba&quot;) who is an old woman, stripping clothes of the dead.

==Real Sanzu Rivers in Japan==
* in Kanra, Gunma (confluence with Shirakura River) 
* in Chōnan, Chiba (confluence with Ichinomiya River) 
* in Zaō, Miyagi (confluence with Nigori River)

<text>Bally Technologies, Inc. is an American manufacturer of slot machines and other gambling technology based in Enterprise, Nevada. It is owned by Light &amp; Wonder.

The company was founded in 1968 as Advanced Patent Technology. It eventually changed its name to Alliance Gaming and in 1996 acquired Bally Gaming International, a former division of Bally Manufacturing. In 2006, the entire company adopted the Bally name.

Scientific Games (now Light &amp; Wonder) acquired the company in 2014. Today, Bally constitutes one of the three brands of Light &amp; Wonder, along with WMS and Shuffle Master.

==History==

===Advanced Patent Technology===
Advanced Patent Technology was founded in 1968 by Jack Solomon and Alvin Snaper, entrepreneurs who held patents in fields including medicine, optics, and electronics. The company&#x27;s stock was publicly offered the next year. Its first 12 years were spent in the development stage. It boasted a portfolio of over 80 patents, but generated considerable publicity for five in particular: an ultrasonic fluidic fuel system for combustion engines, an ultrasonic endodontics device, a &quot;louvered television screen&quot;, an ultrasonic meat tenderizer, and an ultrasonic dry cleaning machine.

===Entry into gaming===
Advanced Patent made its move into the gaming industry in 1979, acquiring United Coin Machine Company, one of the largest slot route operators in Nevada, and announcing plans for the Colorado Belle hotel and casino in Laughlin, the first of a series of hotels to be built in the Las Vegas area. An obstacle arose in July 1980 in the form of an SEC investigation, alleging inadequate financial disclosure and sale of unregistered stock. Under scrutiny from the Nevada Gaming Commission, Solomon was forced to step down as chairman, as a condition of licensing for the casino. Three new directors were added in November to the company&#x27;s board as part of a settlement under discussion with the SEC, but by March 1981, regulators still had questions about the company&#x27;s public disclosure, and trading in the stock was suspended for 10 days. The SEC investigation ended in 1983 with no further action against the company, while Solomon personally agreed to an injunction against any further securities violations, rather than fighting charges that he illegally sold stock in the company between 1975 and 1980 to raise money for its gaming ventures.

A management shake-up in the wake of the SEC probe saw C. Richard Iannone installed as president in 1981. According to Iannone, he was told the company &quot;won&#x27;t last six months&quot;, but he cut expenses and restructured debt, effecting a turnaround by 1983. The company changed its name to Gaming and Technology Inc. in March 1983 to better reflect its focus. The Colorado Belle, described as unprofitable, was sold the following year to Circus Circus Enterprises for $4 million.

===Cal Omega takeover===
On January 1, 1985, the company merged with Omega Enterprises, a manufacturer of video slot machines through its Cal Omega subsidiary, in a &quot;reverse acquisition&quot;. Gaming &amp; Technology acquired Omega&#x27;s assets, and Omega&#x27;s shareholders received 72.5% of the company&#x27;s stock. One of Omega&#x27;s owners, Alfred Wilms, was named CEO of the combined company.

By 1986, machine sales were in a slump, and slot route operations accounted for 80 percent of the firm&#x27;s revenue, so the Cal Omega plant in Carlsbad, California was closed. The company changed its name again in 1988, to United Gaming Inc., acknowledging United Coin as its principal asset.

In 1989, United outlined a plan to become a major casino operator. It opened a $40 million line of credit to finance the construction of five mini-casinos. It partnered with the developer of the under-construction Chaparral Casino to build and operate the property&#x27;s casino and dining facilities, and with another developer on the planned Double Eagle hotel and casino. It leased the casino at the Mizpah Hotel in Tonopah, Nevada, bought the Plantation Casino in Sparks, Nevada for $9.5 million, and opened two small casinos in Downtown Las Vegas, Miss Lucy&#x27;s and the Trolley Stop. Wilms pumped more money into the company, investing $10 million in June 1990 to raise his ownership stake to 54 percent.

The company began restructuring its operations in summer 1990. It abandoned the Double Eagle project after its development partner ran into financing difficulty, and withdrew from the Chaparral project because of its own financing problems. By the winter, it was missing payments to its creditors, but a debt restructuring was achieved in September 1991. United closed Miss Lucy&#x27;s Casino in February 1992.

In 1992, United Gaming expanded to Louisiana, where video poker had been legalized the year before. In August, it began operation of 600 machines at two race tracks, the New Orleans Fair Grounds and Jefferson Downs, and their eight off-track betting parlors. United also planned to install 1,000 machines at bars and truck stops in the state.

===Kirkland-Fort Worth takeover===
In 1993, United Gaming and Wilms reached an agreement with Kirkland-Fort Worth Investment Partners, a group affiliated with Texas investor Richard Rainwater, for a $5 million investment in exchange for 11 percent of the company. Wilms owned 62 percent of the company, but agreed to give up control to Kirkland, allowing them to name 4 of the 7 directors, in exchange for the investment. Concurrently, the company sold $85 million in convertible debentures. Rainwater outlined a plan to &quot;become a really large factor&quot; in the gaming industry, looking for bargain-price casinos &quot;in every jurisdiction&quot;.

Rainwater&#x27;s level of involvement in United became a matter of some dispute. After George W. Bush&#x27;s ties to Rainwater, a fellow member of the group that owned the Texas Rangers baseball team, became a campaign issue in the 1994 race for governor because of Rainwater&#x27;s involvement in gambling, Kirkland head Joel Kirschbaum described Rainwater&#x27;s interest in the company as &quot;passive&quot;. But a later lawsuit by Bally Gaming alleged that United admitted downplaying Rainwater&#x27;s level of control because Major League Baseball frowned on team owners being involved in the gaming industry.

Within months of the Kirkland investment, United partnered in a bid for a gaming license in Evansville, Indiana, to build the River City Casino, was in discussions to acquire a stake in the under-development Diamond Jo Casino in Dubuque, Iowa, agreed to buy a 45 percent stake in the under-construction Rainbow Casino in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and agreed to invest $20 million for a 43 percent stake in Capital Gaming International, which was developing casinos with various Indian tribes and the Crescent City Queen casino in New Orleans.

The company came under scrutiny in November for its relationship with Antoine Saacks, Assistant Superintendent of the New Orleans Police Department, who had worked as a consultant for United&#x27;s video poker operation in Louisiana. Saacks was suspended and later fired for violating a department policy against officers working for video poker companies, and for his connection to Frank Caracci, a nightclub owner tied to the New Orleans crime family. A week after the scandal broke, the company pulled out of its deal with Capital Gaming; United said the timing was coincidental, but a Capital Gaming insider said the situation could impact licensing of the New Orleans casino.

In March 1994, United bought 90 percent of USA Gaming of Native America, which had gaming development agreements with four Indian tribes. In June, United formed a joint venture with Casino Magic to build and operate a casino at Camptown Greyhound Racing in Frontenac, Kansas. In July, United agreed with Lone Star Casino Corp. to invest $15 million for a 50 percent stake in the Pine Hills Casino to be built in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi.

Some plans did not pan out. In August, the River City Casino group withdrew its bid after receiving low marks from a local evaluation panel. The company announced plans in September to wind down some of its smaller operations, closing the Trolley Stop in December 1995, ending the Mizpah Hotel lease in April 1996, and selling the taverns it had acquired in the course of slot route operations. In December, the company decided, after performing due diligence, not to make an offer for the Diamond Jo.

With Kirkland&#x27;s backing in place, analysts expected the company to execute a major merger. United was cited as a possible suitor to buy Casino Magic, Caesars World, or Circus Circus.

In December 1994, United changed its name to Alliance Gaming Corporation, to reflect the company&#x27;s &quot;revitalization and redefinition&quot;.

===Bally Gaming acquisition===
Alliance began seeking ways to apply its marketing strength in the equipment business. Company executives felt there was a market opportunity in new riverboat and Indian casinos, where a slot maker could compete for &quot;shelf space&quot; without having to convince casino managers to switch from machines built by IGT, the market leader with a 70 percent share. CEO Steve Greathouse felt that machines could be made more fun, more interactive, and therefore more profitable, in contrast with IGT, whose executives believed that slot gamblers were &quot;not playing to be entertained&quot;. Starting from scratch against such a dominant competitor was daunting though, so Alliance looked for an acquisition. The natural choice was Bally Gaming International, the number two player with a 15 to 20 percent share.

Kirschbaum had contacted Bally Entertainment about a merger as early as 1993, but Bally&#x27;s CEO rebuffed him because of Alliance&#x27;s heavy debt load and lack of earnings, suggesting they &quot;develop their company a bit&quot;. Talks began again in October 1994, until Alliance broke them off in February 1995. Bally reached out to Alliance the next month through Rainwater, who discussed possibilities including a three-way merger with Autotote, a maker of lottery and pari-mutuel wagering technology.

In June 1995, with Bally already considering a buyout offer from WMS Industries, Alliance made an unsolicited offer of $210 million in cash, stock, and assumed debt. Days later, Bally&#x27;s board of directors accepted WMS&#x27;s offer of $120 million in stock, conditioned on Bally selling its German subsidiary, Bally Wulff, for at least $55 million. Bally called Alliance&#x27;s offer &quot;illusory and highly conditional&quot; on financing, and said that WMS stock would give shareholders more long-term value than Alliance stock, and that a combination of Alliance and Bally would be so undercapitalized as to raise licensing concerns among gaming regulators.

Alliance undertook a hostile takeover effort, suing to block the WMS merger, announcing a tender offer of up to $55 million for 4.4 million shares of Bally, enough to give it a controlling interest, and seeking consent from Bally&#x27;s shareholders to replace a majority of the board. Bally and WMS fired back with separate lawsuits seeking to block Alliance&#x27;s tender offer. Alliance raised its offer to $70 million for 5.4 million shares, and WMS, in turn, raised its total bid to $142 million. In October, Alliance announced that it had been tendered 5.8 million shares, and alleged that Bally and WMS had reached an impasse over Bally&#x27;s failure to find a buyer for Bally Wulff. The next day, Bally&#x27;s board capitulated, canceling the deal with WMS and approving a merger with Alliance on terms similar to those of the tender offer, with a total value of $215 million.

After the two companies agreed to revise the deal down to $185 million to ensure the combined company would have enough cash to grow, and Alliance raised $166 million in financing, the acquisition was completed on June 18, 1996. Bally was organized as three divisions within Alliance Gaming: Bally Gaming, which made slot machines, Bally Systems, which made casino accounting and management systems, and Bally Wulff. Bally Gaming and Systems were combined into a single unit in 1998.

In 1999, Bally launched Thrillions, a wide-area progressive jackpot system, as part of a strategy to focus on games to be installed on a revenue-participation bonus instead of being sold outright to casinos. The game initially launched with a Betty Boop theme, and later added variants based on &quot;Blondie&quot; and Popeye.

This period also saw the introduction of the EVO VIDEO game platform and the EVO 3, which was created in partnership with Microsoft.

The company began seeking buyers for its slot route and casino operations in late 1999, to narrow its focus on gaming technology. After six months, no acceptable bids were received for the Rail City and Rainbow casinos. An agreement was reached to sell United Coin to a pair of Iowa riverboat casino operators for $118 million, but Alliance backed out of the sale a year later because of increased profits at the subsidiary.

===The 2000s===
Bally took the publicly traded company from the brink of NASDAQ delisting in 2000 to record revenues and profits just two years later. On December 12, 2002, Alliance Gaming moved from NASDAQ to the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the ticker symbol “AGI”.

The effort to divest non-core assets resumed in July 2003, with agreements to sell United Coin for $127 million to Century Gaming, the largest slot route operator in Montana, Bally Wulff for $16.5 million to German company Orlando Management, and Alliance&#x27;s 49 percent share in the Louisiana video poker operation to New Orleans–based Gentilly Gaming. In December, Alliance agreed to sell the Rail City casino to Sands Regent for $38 million.

Meanwhile, Alliance considered acquiring Multimedia Games, a leading maker of Class II machines for Indian casinos and bingo halls, but the asking price was too high. Instead, the company in 2004 acquired Sierra Design Group for $165 million, giving it a strong entry into the markets for Class II machines, video lottery terminals, and centrally linked progressive machines for Washington state.

Determining that its Evo platform lacked the horsepower to produce satisfying video games, Bally re-engineered its entire line of video and reel-spinning slot machines. Alpha, its new platform based on Sierra&#x27;s operating system, dramatically improved Bally&#x27;s entire portfolio of games, leading to the release of Hot Shot Progressives, a new series of video and reel machines. Overtaking the Blazing 7s line, Hot Shot Progressives quickly became the company&#x27;s biggest seller and the most successful product launch in the company&#x27;s history. Bally also introduced several new gaming platforms, including the V20 upright, the dual-screen V20/20 video slot, the S9E reel-spinner and the CineVision wide-screen video gaming device. As of July 2009, more than 550 casinos worldwide utilize Bally systems products running on more than 400,000 slot machines.

In 2006, Alliance changed its name to Bally Technologies, Inc., discontinuing the use of Bally Gaming and Systems as a subsidiary, to present a unified identity.

In 2007, Bally Technologies celebrated the 75th anniversary of the Bally trademark with a series of special customer events in Atlantic City, Las Vegas, and Chicago. Also, the company commissioned Christian Marfels, author of the book &quot;Bally - The World&#x27;s Game Maker&quot;
to write an updated second edition, a copy of which was given to every Bally employee.

In 2008, Bally acquired CoolSign, a multi-media management tool, from Planar. On the games side, in 2008 and 2009, Bally released a number of new gaming products, including its new Digital Tower Series, whose games feature dynamic, interactive and animated top-box displays. Additionally, in 2009 the company released its new &quot;Jumbo&quot; cabinets, which measure nearly eight feet high by over three feet wide. In late 2009, Bally displayed their new Pro Series V22/22 upright and Pro Series Slant Top slot featuring a 22&quot; game display and a 26&quot; top display. Bally engineered reduced power consumption in these new platforms. Bally also developed Ultimate Texas Hold&#x27;em in 2009.

In 2010, Bally sold the Rainbow Casino to Isle of Capri Casinos for $80 million.

On November 25, 2013, Bally acquired SHFL entertainment, a global gaming supplier operating in five primary categories: Utility products (including Deck Mate card shufflers and roulette chip sorters), proprietary table games, electronic table systems, electronic gaming machines (including video slot machines) and iGaming.

In 2014, Bally won four awards in the &#x27;Slot Floor Technology Awards&#x27; as well as earning two spots in the annual ‘Top 20 Most Innovative Gaming Technology Products&#x27; awards.

In August 2014, Bally agreed to be acquired by Scientific Games (now Light &amp; Wonder), maker of lottery and sports betting equipment, for $3.3 billion plus $1.8 billion in assumed debt. The acquisition was completed on November 21, 2014. Today, Bally constitutes one of the core brands of Light &amp; Wonder.

==Today==
Bally Technologies is focused on the casino gaming industry, specifically slot machines. Acquisitions of such companies as Casino Marketplace, MindPlay and Advanced Casino Systems Corporation (ACSC) enabled Bally to grow. In terms of computing software infrastructure, the Legacy Unix SDS slot system is still the industry standard. The company’s past acquisitions include the now-defunct firm Honeyframe Cashmaster of Telford, England, and Micro Clever Consulting (MCC) of Nice, France. Those two firms made casino-management software.
Bally MultiConnect (BMC) is a distributed enterprise-wide slot management system designed for multi-property casino firms. This enables centralized accounting and analysis, thereby providing a single view of the entire gaming operation. This enables the casino owner to have complete control over every aspect of the casino, including game functionality, attributes, revenue, and payout of winnings.

<text>Egberto Amin Gismonti (born 5 December 1947) is a Brazilian composer, guitarist and pianist.

== Biography ==

Gismonti was born in the small city of Carmo, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, into a musical family. His mother was from Sicily and his father was from Beirut, Lebanon. At the age of six, he started studying the piano at the Brazilian Conservatory of Music. After studying the classical repertoire in Brazil for 15 years, he went to Paris, France, to delve into modern music. He studied with Nadia Boulanger (1887–1979), after acceptance as a student by the composer Jean Barraqué, a student of Anton Webern and Schoenberg. Boulanger encouraged Gismonti to write the collective Brazilian experience into his music.

Gismonti is a self-taught guitarist. After returning to Brazil, he designed guitars with more than six strings, expanding the possibilities of the instrument. Approaching the fretboard as if it were a keyboard, Gismonti gives the impression that there is more than a single guitar player. Gismonti&#x27;s sojourn in the Xingu region of the Amazon basin made a lasting impression. This is documented musically in tunes such as &quot;Yualapeti&quot; and &quot;Sapain&quot; (Yualapeti shaman, Sapain) and in the recordings &quot;Dança das Cabeças&quot; (&quot;Dance of the Heads&quot;, 1977), &quot;Sol do Meio-Dia&quot; (&quot;Noon Sun&quot;, 1978), which he dedicated to the Xingu, and &quot;Duas Vozes&quot; (&quot;Two Voices&quot;, 1984).

The musical career of Gismonti spans five decades. The major phases are distinguished by record company, the ensemble format, and the musical collaborators. The most important ensembles are his Brazilian group Academia de Danças, including Mauro Senise (saxophone and flutes), Zeca Assumpção (bass) and Nenê (Realcino Lima Filho, drums and percussion), the duo with Naná Vasconcelos (percussion), and the trio with Charlie Haden (bass) and Jan Garbarek (saxophone). &quot; Dança das Cabecas&quot;, the first ECM record, was nominated &quot;Album of the Year&quot; by &quot;Stereo Review&quot; and received the 1977 &quot;Großer Deutscher Schallplattenpreis&quot;.

In 1978 he founded the music label Carmo, which has had several joint ventures with ECM.

<doc id="767533" wikidata="Q354504" url="?curid=767533" title="Alexandre Kojève">
<text>Alexandre Kojève (born Aleksandr Vladimirovich Kozhevnikov; 28 April 1902 – 4 June 1968) was a Russian-born French philosopher and statesman whose philosophical seminars had an immense influence on 20th-century French philosophy, particularly via his integration of Hegelian concepts into twentieth-century continental philosophy.

==Life==
Aleksandr Vladimirovich Kozhevnikov was born in the Russian Empire to a wealthy and influential family. His uncle was the abstract artist Wassily Kandinsky, about whose work he would write an influential essay in 1936. He was educated at the University of Berlin and the University of Heidelberg, both in Germany. In Heidelberg, he completed in 1926 his PhD thesis on the Russian religious philosopher Vladimir Soloviev&#x27;s views on the union of God and man in Christ under the direction of Karl Jaspers. The title of his thesis was &quot;Die religiöse Philosophie Wladimir Solowjews&quot; (&quot;The Religious Philosophy of Vladimir Soloviev&quot;).

Early influences included the philosopher Martin Heidegger and the historian of science Alexandre Koyré. Kojève spent most of his life in France and from 1933 to 1939 delivered in Paris a series of lectures on Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel&#x27;s work &quot;Phenomenology of Spirit&quot;. After the Second World War, Kojève worked in the French Ministry of Economic Affairs as one of the chief planners to form the European Economic Community.

Kojève studied and used Sanskrit, Chinese, Tibetan, Latin and Classical Greek. He was also fluent in French, German, Russian and English.

Kojève died in 1968, shortly after giving a talk to civil servants and state representatives for the European Economic Community (now the European Union) in Brussels on behalf of the French government.

== Philosophy ==
=== Hegel lectures ===

Although not an orthodox Marxist, Kojève was known as an influential and idiosyncratic interpreter of Hegel, reading him through the lens of both Karl Marx and Martin Heidegger. The well-known end of history thesis advanced the idea that ideological history in a limited sense had ended with the French Revolution and the regime of Napoleon and that there was no longer a need for violent struggle to establish the &quot;rational supremacy of the regime of rights and equal recognition&quot;. Kojève&#x27;s end of history is different from Francis Fukuyama&#x27;s later thesis of the same name in that it points as much to a socialist-capitalist synthesis as to a triumph of liberal capitalism.

Kojève&#x27;s lectures on Hegel were collected, edited and published by Raymond Aron in 1947, and published in abridged form in English in the now classic &quot;Introduction to the Reading of Hegel: Lectures on the Phenomenology of Spirit&quot;. His interpretation of Hegel has been one of the most influential of the past century. His lectures were attended by a small but influential group of intellectuals including Raymond Queneau, Georges Bataille, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, André Breton, Jacques Lacan, Raymond Aron, Michel Leiris, Henry Corbin and Éric Weil. His interpretation of the master–slave dialectic was an important influence on Jacques Lacan&#x27;s mirror stage theory. Other French thinkers who have acknowledged his influence on their thought include the post-structuralist philosophers Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida.

=== Friendship with Leo Strauss ===
Kojève had a close and lifelong friendship with Leo Strauss which began when they were philosophy students in Berlin. The two shared a deep philosophical respect for each other. Kojève would later write that he &quot;never would have known [...] what philosophy is&quot; without Strauss. In the 1930s, the two began a debate on the relation of philosophy to politics that would come to fruition with Kojève&#x27;s response to Strauss&#x27; &quot;On Tyranny&quot;.

Kojève, a senior statesman in the French government, argued that philosophers should have an active part in shaping political events. On the other hand, Strauss believed that philosophy and politics were fundamentally opposed and that philosophers should not have a substantial role in politics, noting the disastrous results of Plato in Syracuse. Philosophers should influence politics only to the extent that they can ensure that philosophical contemplation remains free from the seduction and coercion of power.

In spite of this debate, Strauss and Kojève remained friendly. In fact, Strauss would send his best students to Paris to finish their education under Kojève&#x27;s personal guidance. Among these were Allan Bloom, who endeavored to make Kojève&#x27;s works available in English and published the first edition of Kojève&#x27;s lectures in English, and Stanley Rosen.

== Political views ==
=== Marxism ===
According to his own account shortly before his death, Kojève was a communist from youth, and was enthusiastic regarding Bolshevik revolution. However, he &quot;knew that the establishment of communism meant thirty terrible years.&quot;, so he ran away. From now on, he once claimed in his letter to Tran Duc Thao, dated October 7, 1948, that his &quot;... course was essentially a work of propaganda intended to strike people&#x27;s minds. This is why I consciously reinforced the role of the dialectic of Master and Slave and, in general, schematized the content of phenomenology.&quot; His articles from 1920s, talked positively about the USSR, saw it as something developing new. In an article to magazine Yevraziya, a left Eurasianist journal, he praised the CPSU&#x27;s struggle against bourgeois philosophy, arguing that it would lead to something new, whether one calls it proletarian or not:

Mark Lilla notes that Kojève rejected the prevailing concept among some European intellectuals of the 1930s that capitalism and democracy were failed artifacts of the Enlightenment that would be destroyed by either communism or fascism.

While initially somewhat more sympathetic to the Soviet Union than the United States, Kojève devoted much of his thought to protecting western European autonomy, particularly relating to France, from domination by either the Soviet Union or the United States. He believed that the capitalist United States represented right-Hegelianism while the state-socialist Soviet Union represented left-Hegelianism. Thus, victory by either side, he posited, would result in what Lilla describes as &quot;a rationally organized bureaucracy without class distinctions&quot;.

=== Stalin and the Soviet Union ===
Kojève&#x27;s views of Stalin, while changing after World War II, was positive. Kojève&#x27;s interest for Stalin, however, might have been continued, whether positive or negative, after World War II. According to Isaiah Berlin, a contemporary of Kojève and his friend, during their meeting in Paris c. 1946-1947, they talked about Stalin and the USSR. Berlin comments on his relations with Stalin, saying &quot;(...) Kojéve was an ingenious thinker and imagined that Stalin was one too. (...) He said that he wrote to Stalin, but received no reply. I think that perhaps he identified himself with Hegel, and Stalin with Napoleon. (...)&quot;

The most important result of this era was Kojève&#x27;s work addressed to Stalin, &quot;Sofia, filo-sofia i fenomeno-logia&quot; (&quot;Sophia, Philo-sophy and Phenomeno-logy&quot;), a manuscript of more than 900 pages that was penned between 1940 and 1941. In that manuscript, according to Boris Groys, Kojève defended his thesis that the &quot;universal and homogeneous state in which the Sage can emerge and live is none other than Communism&quot; and &quot;scientific Communism of Marx–Lenin–Stalin is an attempt to expand the philosophical project to its ultimate historical and social borders&quot;. According to Groys, &quot;Kojève sees the end of history as the moment of the spread of wisdom through the whole population – the democratization of wisdom; a universalization that leads to homogenization. He believes that the Soviet Union moves towards the society of wise men in which every member will have self-consciousness.&quot;

According to Weslati, several versions of &quot;Sofia&quot;, including a typesetted copy, had been completed in the first week of March 1941, and one of them was given to Soviet vice consul in person by Kojève. Soviet consul &quot;... promised to send the letter with the next diplomatic bag to Moscow.&quot; However, &quot;[l]ess than three months later, the embassy and its contents would be put to the torch by Nazi troops.&quot; It&#x27;s not known whether Kojève&#x27;s work had reached the USSR or was burned with the embassy.

In 1999, &quot;Le Monde&quot; published an article reporting that a French intelligence document showed that Kojève had spied for the Soviets for over thirty years.
Although Kojève often claimed to be a Stalinist, he largely regarded the Soviet Union with contempt, calling its social policies disastrous and its claims to be a truly classless state ludicrous. Kojève&#x27;s cynicism towards traditional Marxism as an outmoded philosophy in industrially well-developed capitalist nations prompted him to go as far as idiosyncratically referring to capitalist Henry Ford as &quot;the one great authentic Marxist of the twentieth century&quot;. He specifically and repeatedly called the Soviet Union the only country in which 19th-century capitalism still existed. His Stalinism was quite ironic, but he was serious about Stalinism to the extent that he regarded the utopia of the Soviet Union under Stalin and the willingness to purge unsupportive elements in the population as evidence of a desire to bring about the end of history and as a repetition of the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution.

=== Kojève and Zionism ===
According to Isaiah Berlin, Kojève was not fond of the idea of a state of Israel. Berlin&#x27;s several different accounts, like the ones published in the Jewish Chronicle in 1973, in The Jerusalem Report in October 1990, and in his interview with Ramin Jahanbegloo in 1991 (also published as a book), are about his meeting with Kojève.

According to the 1973 account, &quot;ten years ago or more&quot; he was &quot;dining in Paris with a distinguished historian of philosophy who was also a high official of the French Government&quot;, namely, Kojève. 1990 account also records that they were talking in Russian. While talking, the issue of Israel and Zionism was also discussed. Kojève, who &quot;was plainly taken aback&quot; at Berlin&#x27;s defence of Zionism, asked Berlin:

In return, according to the interview with Jahanbegloo, Berlin replied: &quot;For the Jews to be like Albania constitutes progress. Some 600,000 Jews in Romania were trapped like sheep to be slaughtered by the Nazis and their local allies. A good many escaped. But 600,000 Jews in Palestine did not leave because Rommel was at their door. That is the difference. They considered Palestine to be their own country, and if they had to die, they would die not like trapped animals, but for their country.&quot; &quot;We reached no agreement.&quot;, records Berlin.

== Critics ==
In a commentary on Francis Fukuyama&#x27;s &quot;The End of History and the Last Man&quot;, the traditionalist conservative thinker Roger Scruton calls Kojève &quot;a life-hating Russian at heart, a self-declared Stalinist, and a civil servant who played a leading behind-the-scenes role in establishing both the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the European Economic Community&quot; and states his opinion that Kojève was &quot;a dangerous psychopath&quot;.

== His works ==
Kojève&#x27;s correspondence with Leo Strauss has been published along with Kojève&#x27;s critique of Strauss&#x27;s commentary on Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Hiero&quot;. In the 1950s, Kojève also met the rightist legal theorist Carl Schmitt, whose &quot;Concept of the Political&quot; he had implicitly criticized in his analysis of Hegel&#x27;s text on &quot;Lordship and Bondage&quot; . Another close friend was the Jesuit Hegelian philosopher Gaston Fessard, whom with also had correspondence.

In addition to his lectures on the &quot;Phenomenology of Spirit,&quot; Kojève&#x27;s other publications include a little noticed book on Immanuel Kant and articles on the relationship between Hegelian and Marxist thought and Christianity. His 1943 book &quot;Esquisse d&#x27;une phenomenologie du droit&quot;, published posthumously in 1981, elaborates a theory of justice that contrasts the aristocratic and bourgeois views of the right. &quot;Le Concept, le temps et le discours&quot; extrapolates on the Hegelian notion that wisdom only becomes possible in the fullness of time. Kojève&#x27;s response to Strauss, who disputed this notion, can be found in Kojève&#x27;s article &quot;The Emperor Julian and his Art of Writing&quot;. Kojève also challenged Strauss&#x27; interpretation of the classics in the voluminous &quot;Esquisse d&#x27;une histoire raisonnée de la pensée païenne&quot; which covers the pre-Socratic philosophers, Plato and Aristotle, as well as Neoplatonism. While the first volume of the previous work was still published during his life-time, most of his writings remained unpublished until recently. These are becoming the subject of increased scholarly attention.

The books that have so far been published are the two remaining volumes of the &quot;Esquisse d&#x27;une histoire raisonnée de la pensée païenne&quot; (1972, 1973 [1952]), &quot;Outline of a Phenomenology of Right&quot; (1981 [1943]), &quot;L&#x27;idée du déterminisme dans la physique classique et dans la physique moderne&quot; (1990 [1932]), &quot;Le Concept, le Temps et Le Discours&quot; (1990 [1952]), &quot;L&#x27;Athéisme&quot; (1998 [1931]), &quot;The Notion of Authority&quot; (2004 [1942]), and &quot;Identité et Réalité dans le &quot;Dictionnaire&quot; de Pierre Bayle&quot; (2010 [1937]). Several of his shorter texts are also gathering greater attention and some are being published in book form as well.

<text>Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC) is a major United States Department of Defense medical facility administered by the United States Army in the state of Hawaii. It is the tertiary care hospital in the Pacific Rim, serving local active and retired military personnel along with residents of nine U.S. jurisdictions and forces deployed in more than 40 other countries in the region. Located on the slopes of Moanalua Ridge overlooking the Honolulu neighborhoods of Moanalua and Salt Lake, Tripler Army Medical Center&#x27;s massive coral pink structure can be seen from any point in the Honolulu District. It also serves as headquarters of the Regional Health Command - Pacific. The main hospital facility is within the Honolulu census-designated place.

==History==
Tripler Hospital was established in 1907, housed in several wooden structures within Fort Shafter on the island of Oahu. In 1920 it was named after a legendary American Civil War surgeon, Brevet Brigadier General Charles Stuart Tripler (1806–1866), who made significant contributions to the development of military medicine.

Tripler Army Medical Center was commissioned by Lt. General Robert C. Richardson Jr., who was Military Governor of the Territory of Hawaii during World War II. General Richardson hired the New York City based architectural firm of York &amp; Sawyer to design the medical complex. The local landscape architect Robert O. Thompson designed the landscape to be &quot;one of the great beauty spots of Hawaii&quot;, although his plans were never fully realized. At the outbreak of World War II, Tripler Army Medical Center had a 450-bed capacity which then expanded to 1,000 beds through the addition of barracks-type buildings.

===Present Day===

Plans for the new Tripler Army Medical Center on Moanalua Ridge were drawn in 1942 and construction was completed in 1948. The General Bronze Corporation, known for New York City&#x27;s Mies van der Rohe-designed Seagram Building, the Atlas and Prometheus bronze sculptures in Rockefeller Center, the bronze doors for the United States Supreme Court and Commerce buildings, the aluminum windows for the United Nations Secretariat, Chase Manhattan Bank, fabricated the aluminum windows for the Tripler Army Base Hospital

In 1959, the original hospital was demolished to make way for expansion of Moanalua Road (now Interstate H-201).

==Education==
The installation has housing within the premises. Hawaii Department of Education operates public schools for dependent children of service members. As of 2016, zoned schools are Moanalua Elementary School, Moanalua Middle School, and Moanalua High School.

<text>The 2004 Philippine presidential and vice presidential elections were held on May 10, 2004. Incumbent president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was elected to a full six-year term with a margin of over one million votes over her leading opponent, movie actor Fernando Poe Jr.

This election was also held at a period in modern Philippine history marked by serious political polarization, resulting in less candidates for the presidency and vice presidency compared to the preceding two elections. Arroyo served as vice president under her predecessor, Joseph Estrada, and ascended to the presidency after Estrada resigned after being impeached with charges of plunder and corruption in 2000. As Arroyo was not elected to the presidency, she was eligible for election to a full term under the 1987 Constitution. Despite initially declaring that she would run in 2004, Arroyo later launched a bid for the presidency, becoming the first president since the People Power Revolution in 1986 to run for a second term. Poe Jr. emerged as her leading opponent, owing to his populist platform and popularity with the working class.

Arroyo was elected to the presidency with her running mate broadcast journalist Noli de Castro, becoming the first presidential ticket to win together since 1986; this feat would not be repeated until 2022, when Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte won together as part of the UniTeam ticket.

This election first saw the implementation of the Overseas Absentee Voting Act of 2003, which enabled Filipinos in over 70 countries to vote.

==Background==
The political climate leading up to the 2004 elections was one of the most emotional in the country&#x27;s history since the 1986 elections that resulted in the exile of Ferdinand Marcos. Philippine society has become polarized between the followers of former president Joseph Estrada who have thrown their support for Estrada&#x27;s close associate Fernando Poe, Jr. and those who support incumbent Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, or at best oppose Estrada.

The several months leading to the May elections saw several presidential scandals, Arroyo reversing her earlier decision not to run for president, the sudden but not unexpected candidacy of Fernando Poe, Jr., defection of key political figures from the Arroyo camp to the opposition, the controversial automated elections initiative of the COMELEC, and the split of the dominant opposition party, &quot;Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino&quot;, between Poe and Panfilo Lacson.

===Gloria Macapagal Arroyo&#x27;s candidacy===
On a speech given on Rizal Day, December 30, 2002, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo declared that she would not run in the 2004 elections. She said that withdrawing from the race would relieve her of the burden of politics and allow her administration to devote the last year and half to strengthening the economy healing the deep divisions within Philippine society, and working for clean and honest elections in 2004.

However, on October 4, 2003, Arroyo said that she would seek a full-term presidency, saying that her change of heart was for a higher cause, and that she could not ignore the call to further serve the country.

===Fernando Poe, Jr.&#x27;s candidacy===

Months before the elections, members of the opposition were encouraging actor Fernando Poe, Jr., a close friend of former president Joseph Estrada to run for president. Poe was very popular with the masses and it was widely believed that he would be a sure winner if he ran for president.

On November 27, 2003, Poe announced during a press conference held at the Manila Hotel that he would run for president.

However, on January 9, 2004, Victorino X. Fornier (a private citizen) filed a case against Poe and the COMELEC, saying that Poe was not eligible to run as he was not a natural-born Filipino before the COMELEC. On January 23, the COMELEC dismissed the petition for lack of merit. On February 10, Fornier finally filed the case to the Supreme Court, seeking for Poe to be disqualified from the race. His case was later merged with cases filed by Maria Jeanette C. Tecson, and Felix B. Desiderio, Jr., and by Zoilo Antonio G. Velez.

====Death of Lawyer Maria Jeanette Tecson====

On September 28, 2007, 8:30 p.m, Senior Superintendent Francisco Uyami, Pasig police chief stated that lawyer Maria Tecson, 40, had been found dead (in a state of rigor mortis) inside room 204 at the Richmond Hotel, San Miguel Avenue, Pasig (with her throat slit and with cuts on her wrist). Maria Jeanette Tecson, Zoilo Velez (promoted to Court of Appeals Justice) and Victorino Fornier filed the disqualification case against Fernando Poe, Jr. She claimed Poe was born out of wedlock, and that while Poe&#x27;s birth certificate was dated 1939, his parents Allan Poe and American mother Bessie Kelly did not marry until 1940.

On March 3, the Supreme Court, said in its decision that for lack of jurisdiction and prematurity, and ruling that Poe&#x27;s father, Allan F. Poe would have been a Filipino citizen by virtue of the &quot;en masse&quot; Filipinization enacted by the Philippine Bill of 1902. Also, even if Poe had not been a natural-born Filipino citizen, he could not be held guilty of having made a material misrepresentation in his certificate of candidacy.

===Eddie Gil&#x27;s candidacy===
The Commission on Elections originally affirmed the candidacies of six people for the president. The sixth person running for president was Eduardo &quot;Eddie&quot; Gil. The party of Eduardo Villanueva filed a petition with the COMELEC seeking to disqualify Eddie Gil on the basis of him being a nuisance candidate, his incapacity to mount a nationwide campaign, and that because he was running with the aim to confuse voters because of their similar names.

Eddie Gil claims to be an international banker having a net worth of billions of dollars. His platform for presidency promised to make every Filipino a millionaire within his first 100 days of being elected. He also promised to pay off the Philippines&#x27; debt, worth trillions of pesos, from his own pocket. This was widely ridiculed, especially after a recent incident in which a check he had issued to pay his hotel bills during a campaign sortie, bounced.

===The LDP split and Lacson&#x27;s campaign===
The &quot;Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino&quot; party (LDP) would form the core of the main opposition party, the &quot;Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino&quot; (KNP). However, members of the party disagreed on which person to support for president. Panfilo Lacson, a member of the party, advanced his candidacy for president but was not considered by Edgardo Angara, the president of the party. Angara supported Fernando Poe, Jr. Together with the party&#x27;s secretary-general Agapito &quot;Butz&quot; Aquino, Lacson gathered the support of some members of the party and went ahead with his candidacy. The LDP was subsequently polarized between those supporting Angara and Poe, and those for Lacson and Aquino.

By then, Poe and Lacson have both filed their certificates of candidacies for president. According to the rules of candidacy, every presidential candidate must have a political party to back him or her. With the obvious split within the ranks of the LDP, and with no signs that the two factions would come to an agreement, the COMELEC decided to informally split the party into the Aquino and the Angara wings. Lacson then ran under the LDP - Aquino Wing, and Poe under the LDP - Angara Wing, which would later become the KNP.

During before and the campaign period, there had been numerous unification talks between the two factions. The opposition saw the need to become united under one banner to boost their chances of winning the presidential election against the organized political machinery of Arroyo. The plans of unification did not materialize due to the stubbornness of both Poe and Lacson. Lacson wanted Poe to concede to him and run as his vice-presidential candidate while the supporters of Poe wanted Lacson to back out from his candidacy and instead support Poe, citing his low performance in the surveys.

===COMELEC&#x27;s move for an automated elections===
Elections in the Philippines have always been a manual process with the results for national positions often being announced more than a month after election day. An attempt to rectify this was done by the Commission on Elections by automating the process of counting the votes. More than 30 billion pesos were spent in acquiring counting machines that were never used in this elections because of numerous controversies and political opposition.

==Parties and coalitions==
This election has seen strong shifts of alliances and new parties as candidates switched allegiances. The two major coalitions seen in this elections were the K-4 (&quot;Koalisyon ng Katapatan at Karanasan sa Kinabukasan&quot;), of the administration, and the KNP (&quot;Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino&quot;), the united opposition.

===Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino (KNP)===
The Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino (Coalition of United Filipinos), or KNP, is the coalition of the united opposition. Its standard bearers are Fernando Poe, Jr. for president and Sen. Loren Legarda for vice-president. The leading parties of this coalition is the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP-Angara Wing), the PDP–Laban and the Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino. the LDP split is caused by stubbornness between FPJ and Ping Lacson, especially with the support of the former president Joseph Estrada and former first lady Imelda Marcos. The other major party under this coalition is Estrada&#x27;s &quot;Partido ng Masang Pilipino&quot; (PMP, Party of the Filipino Masses).

===Alyansa ng Pag-asa===
The third major coalition running in this election is the &quot;Alyansa ng Pag-asa&quot; (Alliance of Hope), This coalition fielded Raul Roco for president and Herminio Aquino for vice-president. The three major parties supporting this coalition are Roco&#x27;s Aksyon Demokratiko (Democratic Action), former Defense Sec. Renato de Villa&#x27;s Reporma Party, and Lito Osmeña&#x27;s Promdi (&quot;Probinsya Muna&quot; [Provinces First] Development Party). The three parties were the ones that bolted out of the People Power Coalition.

===Bangon Pilipinas Movement (BPM)===
The Bangon Pilipinas (Rise up, Philippines) Movement is the political party of Bro. Eddie Villanueva. It consists mostly of volunteers, a majority of whom came from Villanueva&#x27;s Jesus Is Lord church (Villanueva resigned from the church before submitting his candidacy, to prevent questions on separation of church and state).

===Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP) (Aquino Wing)===
A faction named after the party&#x27;s secretary-general Butz Aquino, this was composed of Panfilo Lacson&#x27;s supporters in the LDP Party.

===Partido Isang Bansa, Isang Diwa===
This was Eddie Gil&#x27;s organization. Gil was deemed a nuisance candidate and was disqualified from the presidential race, however, the party qualified for other positions.

== Endorsements ==

=== Organizations and some volunteers ===
On January 29, 2004, PRO-GLORIA for Progressive and Responsible Organizations for Good Leadership, Outstanding Reforms and Intelligent Actions pledged to Arroyo for mobilizing members to boost Arroyo&#x27;s campaign and K-4 by parallel method. Also, Bigkis Pinoy, Lakas Pinoy, Kalipi, Aguman ng Kapampangan, Kaisahan ng Mamamayan para sa Bayan (Kaisambayan), Kaibigan ng OFW, the National Confederation of Tricycle Operators and Drivers Association, United Filipino Seafarers, the Muslim Peace and Order Council for Metro Manila, and youth groups E-Gloria and Team Gloria joined Arroyo.

=== Religious endorsements ===
Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC) and El Shaddai are known to be courted by many candidates, as INC was rumored to have support for Lacson&#x27;s campaign, and Poe courted the religious organization to get their endorsement. El Shaddai was poised to endorse Arroyo in 2003. When unification talks between Lacson and Poe became impossible, Later, Arroyo was also endorsed by INC.

==Results==
The official results of the election were released in staggered dates with most winners in local elective positions declared within two weeks from the May 10 election date. The winners in the Senatorial and Party-list Representative elections were declared on May 24, with the exception of the 12th senator which was announced on June 3. The results of the presidential and vice-presidential races were finalized by the Congress on June 20, more than a month after the elections. Out of the 43,895,324 registered voters, about 33.5 million ballots were cast giving a voter turn-out of 76.34%.

Shown below are the official tallies of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential races.

===President===


==== By region ====
=== Vice-President ===


====&quot;Legarda v. De Castro&quot; electoral protest====
On January 18, 2008, in a 21-page resolution, penned by Senior Justice Leonardo Quisumbing, the Supreme Court of the Philippines, acting as the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET), dismissed Sen. Loren Legarda&#x27;s electoral protest against Noli de Castro. 3 reasons supported the judgment: first, the PET approved the recommendation of Hearing Commissioner and former Commission on Elections (Comelec) Chair retired SC Justice Bernardo P. Pardo that &quot;the pilot-tested revision of ballots or re-tabulation of the certificates of canvass would not affect the winning margin of the protestee in the final canvass of the returns, in addition to the ground of abandonment or withdrawal by reason of Protestant’s candidacy for, election and assumption of the office Senator of the Philippines;&quot; second, Legarda&#x27;s failure to pay the P 3.9 million ($1 = P 40) revision of ballots (in 124,404 precincts) fee despite court extension under Rule 33 of the PET; and third, jurisprudence of Defensor Santiago v. Ramos, teaches that Legarda &quot;effectively abandoned or withdrawn her protest when she ran in the Senate, which term coincides with the term of the Vice-Presidency 2004-2010.&quot; Meanwhile, Noli De Castro on television stated: &quot;This is the triumph of truth. The truth that I won fair and square. I thank the Supreme Court for echoing the true voice of the people. From the very beginning I was confident that I received the overwhelming mandate of our people as Vice President.&quot; Legarda stated that she will file a motion for reconsideration in due course.

===Exit polls===
During and immediately after the elections, exit polls were conducted by various organizations including the Social Weather Stations. According to &quot;The SWS 2004 Day of Election Survey: Final Exit Poll Scores Excluding Blank Answers&quot;, released by the SWS on May 19, 2004, the national vote percentages are: GMA 45%, FPJ 34%, Lacson 10%, Roco 6%, Villanueva 5% (slightly different numbers from May 11; error margin 2%, n = 4,445).&quot;

These results are affirmed when compared to the NAMFREL Quick Count as of May 21, as tabulated in &quot;Comparison of ABS-CBN/SWS Exit Poll 2004 Results (as of May 17, 9 am; excluding No Answer) and NAMFREL Quick Count as of May 21 1:00 p.m. (Report #63)&quot;. The NAMFREL Quick Count shows GMA at 40.4%, FPJ at 36.5%, Lacson at 10.8%, Roco at 6.2%, and Villanueva at 6.1%.

It is notable in light of the subsequent Hello Garci scandal how exit polling revealed the candidates&#x27; performance in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. To wit, the SWS exit poll shows that GMA won only 44% of ARMM while FPJ won 50% (in short, 44–50); the NAMFREL Quick Count showed a score of 34.3-56.5. However, the final official COMELEC Canvass showed a result of 62% vs. 31% in favor of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.

The SWS also published the number of registered voters per region as of April 28, 2004—or just a week before the elections—for the purpose of comparing their sample sizes with the actual number of voters. The ARMM had 1,057,458 voters.

However, recall that in the final official COMELEC canvass, FPJ won 31% of ARMM votes. If he had won 100% of ARMM, he could gain only 69% more of the ARMM voters, or 729,646 votes. Given that the final difference between GMA and FPJ was 1,123,576 votes, GMA would still have won the election by a total of 393,930 votes.

Even if FPJ won 100% of the ARMM, GMA would still have won. So great was GMA&#x27;s lead, that even if they padded ARMM voter rolls so that it would show 1.5 million voters, 69% of that would only be 1.035 million votes, still not enough to overcome the 1.123-million vote lead.

This result is actually consistent with the trend of the pre-election opinion polls conducted also by the SWS. On April 23, just a little over two weeks before the election, the SWS released a poll, and the headline of the SWS report by itself was historically significant: &quot;SWS April 10–17, 2004 Survey: Roco Depleted, Voters Go To GMA and Undecided&quot;. The report&#x27;s first line gives away the game: &quot;Raul Roco&#x27;s sudden departure for abroad cost him almost half of his voting strength, allowing Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to gain a slim lead ...&quot; That lead could not be reversed: at the last pre-election SWS opinion poll (conducted from May 1 to 4) released on May 8, 2004, or just two days before the election, &quot;GMA Leads FPJ By 7%&quot;, 37% to 30%, with 12% undecided.

===Voter demographics===

Source: Exit polls conducted by Social Weather Stations on May 11, 99% total due to rounding error (margin of error: 2%)

===Official Congressional canvass===

Under the constitution, the Congress is mandated to become the National Board of Canvassers for the top two positions, the president and the vice-president. Tallying in the 216,382 precincts nationwide are submitted in &quot;Election Returns&quot; that are forwarded to the municipal and city board of canvassers. These are then tabulated and forwarded to the provincial board of canvassers which prepare the 176 &quot;Certificates of Canvass&quot; (CoC). These CoCs were forwarded to the joint session of the Congress at the &quot;Batasang Pambansa&quot; in Quezon City in May 2004.

Senators and representatives from the administration and opposition have debated heatedly on the procedure of counting the CoCs. The traditional way of counting the certificates, as used in the 1992 and 1998 elections, was to appoint a joint committee consisting of seven senators and seven representatives. Many opposition legislators, notably, Cong. Didagen Dilangalen of Maguindanao, opposed this traditional method as unconstitutional saying that it should be the whole Congress, not a committee, who should count the votes. Part of the argument was that &quot;power delegated cannot be further delegated&quot;, referring to the delegation of counting to a committee. The proposal of some legislators was for the whole Congress to sit in a joint session counting each and every single Certificate of Canvass.

The debates and deliberations for the rules of canvassing were finished by the Congressional joint session on May 28. The rules decided were very similar to the ones used in the 1992 and 1998 elections, which called for a joint committee to act as the National Board of Canvassers. The notable difference is the increase of the number of committee members from 14 to 22, this time consisting of 11 senators and 11 representatives. The composition of the committee was also announced by the Senate President, Franklin Drilon, and the Speaker of the House, Jose de Venecia. The composition was immediately lambasted by the Opposition; the House portion of the committee consisted of 9 administration representatives and 2 opposition. The Poe camp called for a more equal representation for all the involved political parties in the committee, despite the appointed commission mirroring the current composition of the House: there are 190 administration representatives in a 220-seat House.

The official canvassing by the Congressional Joint Committee started on June 4, a little less than one month after election day. Canvassing was done in a slow pace, averaging about 12 Certificates of Canvass per day, as the Opposition accused Administration politicians of railroading the canvass. The Opposition lawyers wanted to question the validity of 25 CoCs, especially in those areas where Arroyo posted a wide margin over Poe. They wanted the committee to examine the Statement of Votes at the municipal level and even down to the Election Returns at the precinct level to prove their claim that the Certificates of Canvass have been tampered with in favor of Arroyo. Administration lawyers contend that the committee is not the proper place to lodge complaints of fraud and that the Opposition should go to the Presidential Election Tribunal (the Supreme Court) after the winner has been proclaimed.

<text>Herbert Kappler (23 September 1907 – 9 February 1978) was a key German SS functionary and war criminal during the Nazi era. He served as head of German police and security services (&quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; and SD) in Rome during the Second World War and was responsible for the Ardeatine massacre. Following the end of the war, Kappler stood trial in Italy and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He escaped from prison shortly before his death in West Germany in 1978.

==Early life==
Kappler was born to a middle-class family in Stuttgart in what was still the German Empire. He joined the Nazi Party on 1 August 1931 and joined the SS in 1933. In January 1936, he was assigned to duty at the Gestapo main office in Stuttgart. 

In 1938, during the Anschluss, Kappler supervised the mass deportations of Austrian Jews as part of the Holocaust in Austria. Kappler was posted to Rome as head of the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD) and, from the beginning of the Second World War, he cooperated closely with the Italian police. 

==Chief of Police in occupied Rome==
In retaliation for the armistice between Italy and the Allies on 8 September 1943, the German military occupied Rome and Kappler was appointed as Chief of the Security Police and Security Service (&quot;Oberbefehlshaber des Sicherheitspolizei und SD&quot;) for all SS and Order Police (&quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot;) units deployed in Rome.

Kappler was immediately put in charge of implementing the Holocaust in Italy in both Rome and Lazio; in his first action, 1,023 Roman Jews were rounded up and deported to Auschwitz; where only 16 survived. He later arranged the deportation of a further 993 Roman Jews, nearly all of whom also were murdered in the gas chambers. As part of the latter operation, Kappler successfully extorted kilograms of gold from the Jews of Rome, which Kappler later alleged was an attempt to prevent the deportations.

By early 1944, Kappler was the highest representative of the Reich Security Main Office in Rome and answered directly to both the military governorship, under &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; General Kurt Mälzer, as well as the SS chain of command under the Higher SS and Police Leader of Italy, SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Karl Wolff. Kappler came into direct conflict with the neutral Vatican under Pope Pius XII, which Kappler correctly believed was harbouring escaped Allied POWs, members of the Italian Resistance, and Jews. A particularly detested adversary of Kappler&#x27;s was Irish Monsignor Hugh O&#x27;Flaherty of the Sacred Congregation De Propaganda Fide. The Monsignor&#x27;s activities covertly assisting Jews and other fugitives led both Kappler and his Italian colleague Pietro Koch to repeatedly, and vainly, plot O&#x27;Flaherty&#x27;s kidnapping, torture, and summary execution.

Meanwhile, Kappler&#x27;s moles inside the Vatican included an Estonian national and former Byzantine Rite seminarian from the Russicum named Aleksander Kurtna, who worked from 1940 until 1944 as a translator for the Vatican&#x27;s Congregation for the Eastern Churches. During those same years, Kurtna covertly spied for the Soviet Union, with devastating results for the many underground priests and faithful whose names he passed to the NKVD. Kurtna, who was always loyal to the USSR, only started to also spy for Nazi Germany in 1943 because his new handler, Kappler, repeatedly threatened to otherwise send Kurtna and his wife to a concentration camp. Kurtna, however, turned the tables on Kappler by stealing the top-secret Sicherheitsdienst codebooks from his office during the chaos that surrounded the Liberation of Rome. Kurtna then passed the codebooks to the Soviets through Monsignor Mario Brini of the Vatican&#x27;s Secretariat of State. Ironically, Kurtna&#x27;s Soviet masters failed to appreciate or reward his loyalty. Kurtna was last seen in 1948 by Fr. Walter Ciszek as a fellow political prisoner in the Gulag complex located 300 km above the Arctic Circle and known as Norillag.

Kappler organised the Ardeatine massacre, in which 335 Italian civilians were killed on 24 March 1944 in response to a direct order from Adolf Hitler to &quot;kill 100 Italians for each German&quot;, in retaliation for an attack by the Italian Resistance that had resulted in the deaths of 33 men of the SS Police Regiment Bozen&#x27;s garrison in Rome.

==Criminal conviction==

Kappler was arrested by British authorities in 1945, turned over to the Italian government in 1947, and tried the following year. Kappler&#x27;s second-in-command in Rome, SS-Captain Erich Priebke, managed to escape to Argentina and was not extradited to Italy to face trial over his own role in the Ardeatine Caves Massacre until 1996.

In July 1948, Kappler was tried by an Italian Army military tribunal and sentenced to life imprisonment, to be served in the Gaeta military prison. Kappler&#x27;s first wife divorced him while he was serving his sentence. In 1972, he married Anneliese Kappler, a nurse with whom he had carried on a lengthy correspondence, in a prison wedding ceremony. By this time, Kappler had converted to Catholicism, due to the influence of his war-time enemy, Monseigneur Hugh O&#x27;Flaherty, who often visited him in prison, and with whom Kappler often discussed literature and religion.

In 1975, at the age of sixty-eight, Kappler was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Appeals by both his wife and the West German government for compassionate release were denied by Italian authorities but did earn him a transfer to a hospital in 1976. Due to Kappler&#x27;s deteriorating condition and his wife&#x27;s nursing skills, Anneliese Kappler was allowed almost unlimited access to him. On a visit in August 1977, she carried him out in a large suitcase (Kappler weighed about at the time) and escaped to West Germany, assisted by apparently unwitting &quot;Carabinieri&quot; member. 

Despite demands that Kappler be returned to Italy, the West German authorities refused to extradite him and did not prosecute him for any further war crimes, reportedly owing to his ill-health. Vittorio Lattanzio resigned from his position as Minister of Defence in the aftermath of the escape. Six months after his escape, Kappler died at home in Soltau, on 9 February 1978, aged 70.

==In popular culture==
In the 1973 feature film &quot;Massacre in Rome&quot;, which deals with the Ardeatine massacre, Kappler was portrayed by actor Richard Burton. Christopher Plummer portrayed Kappler in the 1983 TV film &quot;The Scarlet and The Black&quot;, which details Kappler&#x27;s interactions with Monsignor Hugh O&#x27;Flaherty until Kappler&#x27;s capture by Allies in 1944. The film is based on the book &quot;,&quot; by J.P. Gallagher, published in 1968.

Kappler&#x27;s time in prison and the friendship with his former enemy Monsignor O&#x27;Flaherty born of the Monsignor&#x27;s frequent visits to that prison cell, is dramatised in the radio play &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel of the Vatican,&quot; by Robin Glendinning. The radio play was first broadcast on 30 November 2006 on UK BBC Radio 4. It was later performed live under the name &quot;Kingfishers Catch Fire.&quot;

<text>Ground speed is the horizontal component of the velocity of an aircraft relative to the Earth’s surface, also referred to as &quot;speed over the ground&quot;. It is vital for accurate navigation that the pilot has an estimate of the ground speed that will be achieved during each leg of a flight.

Theoretically, an aircraft diving vertically and unaffected by wind would have a ground speed of zero. Information displayed to passengers through the entertainment system of airline aircraft usually gives the aircraft ground speed rather than airspeed.

Ground speed can be determined by the vector sum of the aircraft&#x27;s true airspeed and the current wind speed and direction; a headwind subtracts from the ground speed, while a tailwind adds to it. Winds at other angles to the heading will have components of either headwind or tailwind as well as a crosswind component.

An airspeed indicator indicates the aircraft&#x27;s speed relative to the air mass it is flying through. The air mass may be moving over the ground due to wind, and therefore some additional means to provide position over the ground is required to determine ground speed. This might be through navigation using landmarks, radio aided position location, inertial navigation system, or GPS. When more advanced technology is unavailable, an E6B flight computer may be used to calculate ground speed. Ground speed radar can measure it directly.

Ground speed is quite different from airspeed. When an aircraft is airborne, its ground speed is not related to the likelihood of a stall, and it doesn&#x27;t influence the aircraft&#x27;s performance, such as rate of climb.

<text>The Portneuf River is a tributary of the Snake River in southeastern Idaho, United States. It drains a ranching and farming valley in the mountains southeast of the Snake River Plain. The city of Pocatello sits along the river near its emergence from the mountains onto the Snake River Plain.

The river is part of the Columbia River Basin.

==Course==
The Portneuf River rises in western Caribou County, approximately east of Pocatello, along the eastern side of the Portneuf Range. It flows initially south, passing westward around the southern end of the range, and then turning north to flow between the Portneuf Range to the east and the Bannock Range to the west. It flows northwest through downtown Pocatello and enters the Snake at the southeast corner of American Falls Reservoir, approximately northwest of Pocatello.

==Watershed and discharge==
The Portneuf watershed drains in southeastern Idaho and is bounded by Malad Summit to the south, the Bannock Range to the west, the Portneuf Range to the southeast, and the Chesterfield Range to the northeast. Marsh Creek is the only major tributary to the Portneuf River. Other creeks in this watershed include Mink, Rapid, Garden, Hawkins, Birch, Dempsey, Pebble, Twentyfourmile, and Toponce creeks. The total area of the Chesterfield Reservoir is estimated at .

The Portneuf River&#x27;s drainage basin is approximately in area.

Its mean annual discharge, as measured by USGS gauge 13075910 (Portneuf River at Tyhee), is , with a maximum daily recorded flow of and a minimum of .

==History==
The Portneuf River was given its name sometime before 1821 by French Canadian voyageurs working for the Montreal-based fur trading North West Company.

The valley of the Portneuf provided the route of the Oregon Trail and California Trail in the middle 19th century. After the discovery of gold in Montana and Idaho, it became a significant stage route for the transportation of people and goods. In 1877 the valley was used as the route of the Utah and Northern Railway, the first railroad in Idaho.

==Recreation Status==

==Biogeochemistry of the watershed==
The Portneuf River watershed is a heavily used and anthropogenically altered system. After a series of heavy floods in the early 1960s the Army Corps of Engineers designed and constructed a concrete channel to control flooding in 1965. The channelization followed the river&#x27;s route and cut through the west side of Pocatello, drastically altering the natural river processes. One common result of human activity is the loading of nutrients into the water system through both point and non-point sources. The river is subjected to use by four municipalities (Lava Hot Springs, McCammon, Inkom, and Pocatello) over its length. The dynamic geology of the region and the heavy use by the local populations have produced a unique set of chemical characteristics associated with both the biological processes and the interactions with the local geology.

===Nitrates===
Nutrient runoffs from intensive agriculture and ranching along the route of the river have noticeably increased the nitrate loads in the stream. This is compounded by the addition of treated effluent from the city of Pocatello&#x27;s wastewater treatment facility and the waste associated with the phosphate processing plant, Simplot. This increased nutrient load supports an increased biomass within the system. The DEQ in collaboration with the City of Pocatello, the Soil Conservation Commission, and USDA are developing tools and practices designed specifically to alleviate the nitrogen issues associated with agriculture and its waste. Known as Best Management Practices (BMPs), these methodologies are designed and modified for varying situations and have proven themselves effective through prior implementation projects.

===Carbon exchange===
The exchange of inorganic carbon between the solid earth and the atmosphere in the Portneuf watershed has produced deposits of CaCO3 throughout the system. Known as travertine and tufa, these deposits are formed as a function of the dynamic groundwater and geology of the region. Tufa is known throughout the geologic collective as the soft and porous CaCO3 deposits associated with moving freshwater environments. Travertine is a related deposit separated by the fact that it is associated with thermal waters. Deposition of tufa is complex, involving processes of dissolution, saturation, subsurface transport, emergence and precipitation. Both versions of precipitated CaCO3 are present in the Portneuf watershed. Several very different but related processes control the precipitation of CaCO3 in natural aqueous systems. The chemical processes are driven by the chemical properties of the elements and molecules involved. The physical processes are driven by characteristics of the watershed system (gradient, flow, substrate, groundwater flow properties). The biotic processes are driven by the activities of living organisms.

====Chemical processes====
Calcium carbonate formations are associated with regions where meteoric waters become enriched with calcium carbonate by direct dissolution of CaCO3-rich rocks underground only to resurface and re-precipitate calcite. It is well known that the geology of the Portneuf watershed contains large thicknesses of limestone and dolomite strata that are mostly Paleozoic. Enrichment of CaCO3 in the meteoric waters is due to the addition of CO2 either through interaction with the atmosphere, or infiltrating through organic compound containing soil layers. This saturation of CO2 in the groundwater allows for the dissolution of carbonate rocks as it drives pH down. As the water reemerges it is exposed to the atmosphere and the concentration gradient of CO2 associated with it. As the enriched waters attempt to achieve equilibrium they precipitate calcite, through the reaction of Ca+2 + 2HCO− ⇔ CO2↑ + H2O+ CaCO3↓. The mountains surrounding the Portneuf are characterized by thick Paleozoic limestone deposits rich in carbonates, and many springs do emerge along the reach associated with Lava Hot Springs.

====Physical processes====
Another factor affecting the precipitation of tufa is the physical aspects of the river system. The gradient of the Portneuf through Lava Hot Springs is such that this reach is dominated by a series of riffles with some larger falls. This turbulence and increased surface area caused by aeration facilitate the out gassing of CO2, thus increasing the saturation of CaCO3 to the point of precipitation. This is a phenomenon noticed throughout the world as the development of waterfall tufa and is a relevant explanation for at least some formation through the region, especially through the town site of Lava Hot Springs. The figure below is a schematic representation of the stream gradient of the Portneuf from just below Chesterfield Reservoir and above American Falls Reservoir adapted from Minshall, 1973.

====Biotic processes====
The third recognized mechanism for tufa development is the active role played by the biota. Algae and mosses, along with higher plants and some insects, often trap tiny particles within their sinuous roots, fronds, and shelter/feeding structures, acting as nucleation points for further precipitation. This may explain some of the deposition locations, but the biota plays a larger role as photosynthetic plants remove CO2 from the water, further concentrating the Ca2+ and CO32− and driving precipitation. The Portneuf through this reach is rich in plant life not only due to the nutrient accumulation as it travels through farmland but from the warm water inputs that protect the stream from the effects of the harsh cold of winter temperatures. This could be a mechanism for potentially increasing tufa formation through the reach. An interesting study completed in 1972 showed evidence that the development of tufa and travertine filled the interstices normally found on the rocky river. This had implications for some burrowing organisms as well as nutrient cycling.

Precipitation of tufa in the Portneuf drainage is produced through the combination of four complex mechanisms: dissolution of limestones by meteoric waters containing carbonic acids, degassing of CO2 at turbulent sites, the removal of CO2 by photosynthetic plants, and the trapping of particles of CaCO3 by the biota. The complex interactions between these different mechanisms may never be fully understood but offer insight into the occurrence of formations.

<text>A fire support base (FSB, firebase or FB) is a temporary military facility used to provide fire support (often in the form of artillery) to infantry operating in areas beyond the normal range of fire support from their own base camps. FSBs follow a number of plans, their shape and construction varying based on the terrain they occupy and the projected garrison.

Widely used during the Vietnam War, the concept continues to be used in military operations. Under the original concept of the artillery fire support base, a 6-gun battery was set up, with one howitzer in the center to fire illumination rounds during night attacks and serve as the base&#x27;s main registration gun. The other five howitzers were arranged around it in a &quot;star&quot; pattern. Smaller FSBs tended to vary greatly from this layout, with two to four howitzers of various calibers (usually 105 mm and 155 mm at battalion level) located in dispersed and fortified firing positions. These smaller bases arranged their guns in square or triangle patterns when possible.

==Vietnam War==

One of the first fire support bases constructed by U.S. troops was built in October 1965. Designated Bill, it was built by the First Cavalry Division in Pleiku Province soon after the division arrived in South Vietnam. Based on the original concept developed by that division, firebases would move about every two days, minimizing the amount of security and semi-permanent construction they would need. Over time this changed, and firebases evolved into small forts with all the defensive measures those required.

Many fire support bases evolved into more permanent bases. Their main components varied by size: a typical FSB usually had a battery of six 105 millimeter or 155 mm howitzers, a platoon of engineers permanently on station for construction and maintenance projects, at least two landing pads for helicopters (a smaller VIP pad and at least one resupply pad), a Tactical Operations Center (TOC), an aid station staffed with medics, a communications bunker, and a company of infantry serving as the defense garrison. Large FSBs might also have 2 artillery batteries, and an infantry battalion.

Firebase Bastogne was a United States firebase constructed in Vietnam in 1968 by the 101st Airborne Division. Firebase Mary Ann, constructed by elements of the 23rd Infantry Division &quot;Americal&quot;, was more typical of smaller fire support bases.

==Use in Afghanistan==

Firebases had been set up in Afghanistan since the action by U.S.-led Coalition forces began in 2001. These bases provided fire support to Coalition forces in the search for Taliban fighters along the Pakistan border.

<text>Daniel James Macdonnell Heap (September 24, 1925 – April 25, 2014) was a Canadian activist and politician. Heap served as a Member of Parliament with the New Democratic Party, a Toronto City Councillor, a political activist and an Anglican worker-priest. He represented the Toronto, Ontario, riding of Spadina (after 1988 Trinity—Spadina) from 1981 to 1993 and Ward 6 on Toronto City Council from 1972 to 1981. As an activist he was involved in the peace movement, community issues around housing, homelessness, poverty and refugee rights among other social justice issues.

==Background==
Heap was born on September 24, 1925, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, into a middle-class family, the second of four children. His father, Fred Heap, was a lawyer and his mother was a piano teacher. Heap&#x27;s maternal grandfather was a Presbyterian minister inspiring Heap, from a young age, to want to take up the same calling.

Heap was raised a Presbyterian in a family that was concerned about social causes. When he was 6, the family decided to boycott Japanese oranges to protest the Japanese invasion of Manchuria.

For his last two years of high school, Heap attended Upper Canada College on a scholarship, and then studied classics and philosophy at Queen&#x27;s University.

A pacifist, Heap nevertheless joined the Canadian Army during the Second World War due to his opposition to Nazism, later saying &quot;It wasn&#x27;t possible to be neutral in the face of Hitler&quot;. However, the war ended before he could be sent overseas.

In 1945, while working in a factory as a summer job, he met members of the Student Christian Movement and became a Christian socialist. He later also became a member of the Society of the Catholic Commonwealth and of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, forerunner of the New Democratic Party.

Heap studied theology at the University of Chicago for a year before becoming an Anglican and transferring to McGill University to pursue a divinity degree. While at McGill he became engaged to Alice Boomhour, a pacifist, activist in the SCM and CCF, and daughter of a United Church minister. They married in 1950. That same year, he was ordained a priest within the Anglican Church of Canada.

After working as a parish priest in Quebec for only a few years in the 1950s, Heap decided against a career as a church employee and aligned himself with the Worker-Priest movement which paired ministry with social activism. Heap moved his family to Toronto where he worked for 18 years as a labourer (cutter trimmer, later pressman) in a cardboard box factory in Toronto, where he became involved in the paperworker&#x27;s union (later the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada which eventually merged to become part of UNIFOR) and was elected a union representative and attempted to &quot;bring socialism to the Canadian worker&quot;.

He and Alice raised seven children, including son Danny Heap, a computer science lecturer at the University of Toronto.

In 1965, Heap marched with Martin Luther King Jr. on his Selma to Montgomery marches while the rest of his family participated in a solidarity sit-in in Toronto. The family also opened their home to Americans resisting the Vietnam War, youth involved with the SCM and other activists.

==Politics==
Heap entered politics and campaigned on a platform to oppose poverty, war and homelessness. He ran as the New Democratic Party&#x27;s candidate in Spadina in the 1968 federal election placing second in a campaign where he described himself as a &quot;worker priest&quot;. He also ran in the 1971 provincial election against Allan Grossman in the riding of St. Andrew—St. Patrick, losing by 1137 votes. His first success in politics came when he was elected in the 1972 municipal election as the junior Alderman for Ward 6. As well as serving on Toronto City Council from 1972 to 1981, he also represented Ward 6 on Metro Toronto Council from 1974 to 1978. When the Liberal Member of Parliament for Spadina, Peter Stollery, was appointed to the Senate in 1981, Heap decided to run in the subsequent by-election. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau had recommended Stollery for appointment to the Senate in order to open the &quot;safe Liberal riding&quot; for Trudeau&#x27;s aide Jim Coutts. Heap defeated Coutts in the by-election, however, and was re-elected in the 1984 and 1988 elections. He retired at the 1993 federal election.

Heap was an outspoken MP, and campaigned against poverty, homelessness, and war. Upon being elected to parliament, he said his three priorities were world peace, worker control of the economy, and an end to social injustice. He served as NDP critic on immigration, served on the member of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Labour, Employment and Immigration, and was a prominent spokesperson for social justice issues both in Canada and abroad. He was very concerned with issues such as refugees, the situations in Central America, East Timor, and South Africa. Heap hired a young Olivia Chow as his constituency office assistant.

==Later life==
Despite retiring from politics, Heap remained involved as an activist, strongly backing the anti-war movement, and supporting NDP candidates in the region. He also remained involved at the downtown Church of the Holy Trinity and social justice issues within the Anglican Church of Canada. In retirement, he preferred to go by the name &quot;Don Heap&quot;, which he used before entering electoral politics in 1968.

In the late 1980s, he and his wife Alice sold their family home in Toronto&#x27;s Kensington Market area at a fraction of the market price to the &quot;Homes First Society&quot;, a community organization which provides housing for refugees. The house had been a nexus for meetings and organizing among student activists around the anti-war, anti-apartheid and social housing movements from the 1960s to the 1980s with as many as a dozen young people staying with the Heap family at one time.

In his late seventies and early eighties he remained involved in various issues such as refugee rights. Heap co-founded the Toronto Disaster Relief Committee to campaign on the issue of homelessness.

Heap suffered a heart attack in 2005 and was also diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2006. In 2011, he and his wife faced eviction from their retirement home as they awaited admission to a long-term care facility, for which they had been on a waiting list for five years. In October 2011, Heap was admitted to the Kensington Gardens facility and his wife Alice got a spot there later that month. Alice Heap, his wife of 61 years, died due to complications from pneumonia on March 24, 2012, at the age of 86.

Heap died on April 25, 2014. One of his sons posted a message remembering him as an &quot;advocate of the homeless, for refugees and for peace [among other causes]&quot; and also as a &quot;Pacifist, socialist, worker-priest, marxist Anglican, trade-unionist, city councillor, member of parliament, civilly disobedient marcher for human rights. Wearer of red shirts, cyclist, paddler of canoes, singer of songs.&quot;

==Tributes==
A sole support mother that Heap helped get childcare in the 1980s, later taught nursing at George Brown College. In 2013, Nadira Fraser established the &quot;Dan and Alice Heap Bursary&quot; to aid single parents to qualify for nursing. The couple also has an athletic award which is attributed to their namesake, The Don &amp; Alice Heap Rugby for all Athletic Award. heaped.

<doc id="767572" wikidata="Q311095" url="?curid=767572" title="Jorge Andrade">
<text>Jorge Manuel Almeida Gomes de Andrade (; born 9 April 1978) is a Portuguese former professional footballer who played as a centre-back.

After playing two years with Porto, he went on to represent Deportivo de La Coruña (169 official appearances in five seasons) and Juventus, appearing rarely for the latter club due to injury.

Andrade earned more than 50 caps for Portugal, representing the country at the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004 and helping it finish second in the latter tournament.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Andrade was born in Lisbon. He made his professional debut with his hometown club Estrela da Amadora in 1997, helping it to two consecutive eighth Primeira Liga places as well as participation in the 1998 UEFA Intertoto Cup. He immediately caught the eye, and after that was on the move north to Porto, being the team&#x27;s most used player in the 2001–02 edition of the UEFA Champions League at 15 matches (of a possible 16) as they reached the second group phase in the competition.

===Deportivo===
After Portugal&#x27;s unsuccessful 2002 World Cup campaign, Andrade joined Spain&#x27;s Deportivo de La Coruña in a move that cost the Galician side €12 million with the possibility of being increased to €13 million (goalkeeper Nuno Espírito Santo was also part of the deal, for €3 million). He appeared in 11 La Liga games in his debut season, barred by César Martín and Noureddine Naybet, but was an undisputed first-choice when healthy in the following years.

On 21 April 2004, during a Champions League semi-finals fixture against his former team Porto, Andrade was sent off by Markus Merk for a kick on Deco; the gesture was of a friendly nature, but the referee was eluded by it, and immediately gave the defender his marching orders. He was forced to serve a one-match ban.

===Juventus===
Andrade signed for Juventus in summer 2007, for approximately €10 million. In a Serie A match against Roma on 23 September, he broke his left patella and missed the rest of the season.

In the team&#x27;s 2008 pre-season, Andrade suffered the same injury and missed the entire 2008–09. In a press release dated 7 August, Juventus stated:&quot;On 9 July 2008, during a training session at Pinzolo, the player Jorge Manuel Almeida Gomes de Andrade was the victim of another serious injury to his left knee (relapse of the fracture of the rotula) operated twice in the past season. A new osteosynthesis operation was thus needed, with the post-surgery prognosis being a number of months.

Given the impossibility for the player to recover to play professionally, the company has proceeded to fully write down the residual book value of the player&#x27;s registration rights with a negative effect on the 2007–08 financial year for €6.8 million.&quot; That was the third in a year and the fourth left knee surgery Andrade had in his career. The Turin-based club wrote off his salary as well as part of the transfer fee for the fiscal year, though he stated he hoped to return playing at the highest level.

On 8 April 2009, Juventus and Andrade reached an agreement and the player&#x27;s remaining contract was cancelled, leaving him free to find another team. After being released he went on trial with Málaga, but was not offered a deal eventually; in early February 2010, he was scheduled to undergo a trial at Toronto FC in Canada, but failed to report.

==International career==
Andrade made his debut for Portugal on 25 April 2001, playing the full 90 minutes in a 4–0 friendly defeat in France, and was part of the nation&#x27;s squads at the 2002 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2004, partnering Ricardo Carvalho for the runners-up at the latter and eventually scoring three goals in 51 games, the first being in a 5–1 win against Angola on 14 November 2001, an exhibition game marred by violence. In Euro 2004, held on home soil, he also put one in his own net in a 2–1 victory over the Netherlands in the semi-finals.

Andrade missed Portugal&#x27;s fourth-place finish at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, having had knee surgery in March that year. He appeared in five matches during the Euro 2008 qualifying campaign, his last international occurring on 22 August when he started in a 1–1 draw in Armenia.

==Coaching career==
On 9 April 2015, Andrade was named assistant to Pedro Hipólito at hometown club Atlético Clube de Portugal, then struggling in the Segunda Liga. The following 21 February, he was interim manager for the match away to Porto B, losing by a single goal.

Andrade took his first outright job on 21 March 2016 at fellow capital team Oriental, occupying a precarious position in the same league. In May, four of his players were investigated for allegedly taking bribes to throw games, and the campaign ended with relegation.

In February 2019, Andrade was appointed assistant to Sandro Mendes at Vitória de Setúbal. He stood down in August, for family reasons.

Andrade returned to Estrela on 4 December 2021, as part of the club&#x27;s football structure.

==Personal life==
Andrade, along with fellow Portuguese internationals Miguel, Nani and Nélson, had descent from the Cape Verde islands, previously a Portuguese colony. He visited the archipelago in 2006, and did some work with grassroots football during his stay.

<doc id="767576" wikidata="Q2412073" url="?curid=767576" title="Tybalt">
<text>Tybalt () is a fictional character and the principal antagonist in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. He is the son of Lady Capulet&#x27;s brother, Juliet&#x27;s short-tempered first cousin, and Romeo&#x27;s rival. Tybalt shares the same name as the character Tibert / Tybalt &quot;the prince of cats&quot; in the popular story &quot;Reynard the Fox&quot;, a point of mockery in the play. Mercutio repeatedly calls Tybalt &quot;prince of cats&quot;, in reference to his sleek, yet violent manner.

Luigi da Porto adapted the story as &quot;Giulietta e Romeo&quot; and included it in his &quot;Historia novellamente ritrovata di due Nobili Amanti&quot; (Newly found tale of two Noble lovers) published in 1530. Da Porto drew on &quot;Pyramus and Thisbe&quot;, Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot; and a novella by Masuccio Salernitano. Da Porto gave it much of its modern form, including the lovers&#x27; names, the rival families of Montecchi and Capuleti, and their location in Verona. He also introduces characters corresponding to Shakespeare&#x27;s Mercutio, Tybalt, and Paris. Da Porto presents his tale as historically true and claims it took place in the days of Bartolomeo II della Scala (a century earlier than Salernitano). Montague and Capulet were actual 13th century political factions, but the only known connection between them is a mention in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Purgatorio&quot; as an example of civil dissension.

==Part in the play==
In Act I, Scene I, Tybalt enters and helps his own servants, Sampson and Gregory, who are fighting in the streets with servants of the Montagues, Abraham and Balthasar. Seeing Benvolio (Romeo&#x27;s cousin) trying to stop the fight, Tybalt draws his sword to fight Benvolio, saying:

::What, drawn and talk of peace? I hate the word
::As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
::Have at thee, coward!
::—Act I, Scene I

Later, at the Capulets&#x27; ball, Tybalt is the first to recognize Romeo through his disguise, and would kill him if not forbidden by his uncle, Lord Capulet. His lust for revenge unsated, Tybalt sends a challenge letter to Romeo for a duel to the death. At the beginning of Act III, he enters looking for Romeo, only to create tensions with Mercutio, who was mocking Tybalt even before he walked into the scene. Tybalt initially ignores Mercutio and confronts Romeo, who refuses to fight because of his recent secret marriage to Juliet. Tybalt becomes even angrier; he does not know Romeo cannot fight him because they are now relatives.

Mercutio loses his temper and begins fighting Tybalt himself. Romeo tries to stop the combat by rushing between them, and Tybalt then stabs Mercutio under his arm. Mercutio dies from the wound, angering an already emotional Romeo. Enraged, Romeo duels and kills Tybalt in return, leading to his own exile by Prince Escalus. 

Tybalt is revealed to be Juliet&#x27;s maternal first cousin, when Lady Capulet arrives at the scene where Tybalt lies dead, and cries
::&quot;Tybalt, my cousin, O my brother&#x27;s child!&quot;
::—Act III

==Performance history==

A sample of notable portrayals include:
*Louis Hector in Frank Reicher&#x27;s 1923 Broadway show, which ran for 157 performances
*Orson Welles in Katharine Cornell&#x27;s 1934 production; his Broadway debut

*Jason Statham in the animated &quot;Gnomeo &amp; Juliet&quot; (2011)
*Ed Westwick in the 2013 film adaptation
*Corey Hawkins in the 2013 Broadway re-telling
*Amar Ramasar as Bernardo in the 2020 stage revival of &quot;West Side Story&quot;
*David Alvarez as Bernardo Nuñez in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s film remake of &quot;West Side Story&quot; (2021)
*Alistair Toovey in &quot;Rosaline&quot; (2022)

==Analysis==
Draper (1939) points out the parallels between the Elizabethan belief in the four humours and the main characters of the play; Tybalt is choleric: Violent, vengeful, short-tempered, ambitious.
Interpreting the text in the light of humours reduces the amount of plot attributed to chance by modern audiences.

<text>Sanford Meisner (August 31, 1905 – February 2, 1997) was an American actor and acting teacher who developed an approach to acting instruction that is now known as the Meisner technique. While Meisner was exposed to method acting at the Group Theatre, his approach differed markedly in that he completely abandoned the use of affective memory, a distinct characteristic of method acting. Meisner maintained an emphasis on &quot;the reality of doing&quot;, which was the foundation of his approach.

==Early life==
Born in Brooklyn, New York City, Meisner was the oldest child of Hermann Meisner, a furrier, and Bertha Knoepfler, both Jewish immigrants who came to the United States from Hungary. His younger siblings were Jacob, Ruth, and Robert. To improve Sanford&#x27;s health during his youth, his family took a trip to the Catskills. While there, however, his brother Jacob contracted bovine tuberculosis from drinking unpasteurized milk and died shortly thereafter. In an interview many years later, Meisner described this event as &quot;the dominant emotional influence in my life from which I have never, after all these years, escaped.&quot; Because he was unable to cope with feelings of guilt relating to his brother&#x27;s death, for which his parents blamed him, the young Meisner became isolated and withdrawn.

He found release in playing the family piano and eventually attended the Damrosch Institute of Music (now the Juilliard School), where he studied to become a concert pianist. When the Great Depression hit, however, his father pulled him out of music school to help with the family business in New York City&#x27;s Garment District. Meisner later recalled that his only means of enduring long days spent lugging bolts of fabric was to entertain himself by replaying, in his mind, all the classical piano pieces he had studied in music school. Meisner believed this experience helped him develop, at age twenty, an acute sense of sound akin to perfect pitch. Later, as an acting teacher, he often evaluated his students&#x27; scene work with his eyes closed and his head dramatically buried in his hands. This trick was only partly for effect, he explained, because it actually helped him more closely listen to his student&#x27;s work and pinpoint the true and false moments in their acting.

After graduating from Erasmus Hall High School in 1923, Meisner professionally pursued acting, which had interested him since his youth. He had acted at the Lower East Side&#x27;s Chrystie Street Settlement House under the direction of Lee Strasberg, who would play an important role in his development. At age 19 Meisner heard that the Theatre Guild was hiring teenagers and, after a brief interview, was hired as an extra for &quot;They Knew What They Wanted&quot;. The experience deeply affected him, leading to the realization that acting had always been his life&#x27;s ambition. He and Strasberg both appeared in the original Theatre Guild production of the Rodgers and Hart revue &quot;The Garrick Gaieties&quot;, from which the song &quot;Manhattan&quot; came.

==Group Theatre==

Despite his parents&#x27; misgivings, Meisner continued to pursue a career in acting, receiving a scholarship to study at the Theatre Guild of Acting. Here he encountered once again Harold Clurman and Lee Strasberg. Strasberg was to become another of the century&#x27;s most influential acting theorists and the father of method acting, an acting technique derived, like Meisner&#x27;s own, from the system of Konstantin Stanislavski. The three became friends. In 1931, Clurman, Strasberg, and Cheryl Crawford (another Theatre Guild member) selected 28 actors (one of whom was Meisner) to form the Group Theatre. This company exerted an influence on the entire art of acting in the United States. Meisner summered with the Group Theatre at their 1936 rehearsal headquarters at Pine Brook Country Club in the countryside of Nichols, Connecticut.

Meisner, along with a number of other actors in the company, eventually resisted Strasberg&#x27;s preoccupation with affective memory exercises. In 1934, fellow company member Stella Adler returned from private study with Stanislavski in Paris and announced that Stanislavski had come to believe that, as part of a rehearsal process, delving into one&#x27;s past memories as a source of emotion was only a last resort and that the actor should seek rather to develop the character&#x27;s thoughts and feelings through physical action, a concentrated use of the imagination, and a belief in the &quot;given circumstances&quot; of the text. As a result, Meisner began to focus on a new approach to the art of acting.

When the Group Theatre disbanded in 1940, Meisner continued as head of the acting program at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York, at which he had taught since 1935. In teaching he found a level of fulfillment similar to that which he had found in playing the piano as a child. At the Playhouse he developed his own form of method acting that was based on Stanislavski&#x27;s system, Meisner&#x27;s training with Lee Strasberg, and on Stella Adler&#x27;s revelations about the uses of the imagination. Today that approach is called the Meisner technique. It was during these early years at The
Neighborhood Playhouse that Meisner was briefly married to the young actress Peggy Meredith, who appeared in several Broadway productions.

The Actors Studio was founded in 1947 by two ex-Group Theatre actors Elia Kazan and Robert Lewis, and Cheryl Crawford. Strasberg initially had not been asked to join the group, while Meisner was among the first instructors to teach at the studio. However, by 1951, after Kazan moved to Hollywood to focus on his directorial career, Strasberg became the group&#x27;s artistic director. In the following years, many students of the Actors Studio became well known in the film industry. Strasberg&#x27;s later insistence that he had trained them distressed Meisner enormously, creating an animosity with his ex-mentor that continued until Strasberg&#x27;s death.

==Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre==

In 1935, Meisner joined the faculty of The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre and continued as the Director of the Acting Department until his retirement in 1990, and served as Director Emeritus until his death in 1997. In 1928, The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre opened its doors. The first class of only nine students had the privilege of being taught by theatre luminaries Martha Graham, Louis Horst, Laura Elliott, and Agnes de Mille. Over his years of teaching at the Playhouse, this founding member of The Group Theatre developed and refined what is now known as the Meisner Technique: &quot;To live truthfully under given imaginary circumstances.&quot; The Meisner Technique is a step-by-step procedure of self-investigation for the actor now widely recognized as one of the foremost acting techniques taught today.

Notable students and alumni of The Neighborhood Playhouse under Sanford Meisner&#x27;s instruction include: Dylan McDermott, James Caan, Steve McQueen, Robert Duvall, Gregory Peck, Diane Keaton, Jeff Goldblum, Tony Randall, Sydney Pollack, David Mamet, Connie Britton, Brian Geraghty, Leslie Moonves, Sherie Rene Scott, Chris Noth, Tucker Smallwood, Mary Steenburgen, Betsy von Furstenberg, Allison Janney, Jennifer Grey, Ashlie Atkinson, Christopher Meloni, Alex Cole Taylor, and many more.

==Meisner/Carville School of Acting==
In 1983, Meisner and his life partner James Carville founded the Meisner/Carville School of Acting on the Caribbean island of Bequia. Students from all around the world came every summer to participate in a summer intensive with Meisner. The Meisner/Carville School of Acting operated on the island and, beginning in 1985, also in North Hollywood. Meisner split his time between the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York and the two school locations. In spring of 1995, The Meisner/Carville School of acting was then succeeded by The Sanford Meisner Center for the Arts, a theater company and school in North Hollywood established by Meisner, James Carville, and Martin Barter. Graduates from Meisner&#x27;s 2-year program could audition for the company. The company became a fixture on the Los Angeles theater scene for several years after Meisner&#x27;s death. Meisner attended every rehearsal and every performance until the very end.

===Notable students===

Throughout his career, Meisner worked with, and taught, students who became well known. Sydney Pollack and Charles E. Conrad served as Meisner&#x27;s senior assistants. The technique is helpful not just for actors, but also for directors, writers, and teachers. A number of directors also studied with him, among them Sidney Lumet and John Frankenheimer, and writers such as Arthur Miller and David Mamet. At least 37 of the students who studied with Sanford Meisner were nominated for or won Academy Awards.

==Film and television appearances==
Though he rarely appeared on film, he performed in &quot;Tender Is the Night&quot;, &quot;The Story on Page One&quot;, and &quot;Mikey and Nicky&quot;. His last acting role was in the season one episode of the television medical drama &quot;ER&quot;, titled &quot;Sleepless in Chicago&quot;. Actor Noah Wyle worked with him and referred to the experience as the highlight of his career.

==Author==
Meisner is the author of the book &quot;Sanford Meisner on Acting&quot; (Knopf Doubleday 1987), considered by some to be an indispensable tool for contemporary actors.

==Personal life and death==
Meisner&#x27;s two marriages, to Peggy Meredith (née Meyer) and Betty Gooch, respectively, ended in divorce. Meisner, who was bisexual, spent the remainder of his life with partner James Carville.

In 1970 Meisner was diagnosed with throat cancer and underwent a laryngectomy. After that operation he lived for nearly three more decades, until February 2, 1997, when he died in his sleep at the age of 91 at his home in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles.

==The Meisner technique==

Meisner&#x27;s unusual techniques were considered both unorthodox and effective. Actor Dennis Longwell wrote of sitting in on one of Meisner&#x27;s classes one day, when Meisner brought two students forward for an acting exercise. They were given a single line of dialogue, told to turn away, and instructed not to do or say anything until something happened to make them say the words (one of the fundamental principles of the Meisner technique). The first student&#x27;s line came when Meisner approached him from behind and gave him a strong pinch on the back, inspiring him to jump away and yelp his line in pain. The other student&#x27;s line came when Meisner reached around and slipped his hand into her blouse. Her line came out as a giggle as she moved away from his touch.

The goal of the Meisner technique has often been described as getting actors to &quot;live truthfully under imaginary circumstances.&quot;

<doc id="767583" wikidata="Q24649" url="?curid=767583" title="European political party">
<text>A European political party, formerly known as a political party at European level and informally as a Europarty, is a type of European political alliance recognised as a political party operating transnationally in Europe and within the institutions of the European Union (EU). They are regulated and funded by EU Regulation 1141/2014 on the statute and funding of European political parties and European political foundations, and their operations are supervised by the Authority for European Political Parties and European Political Foundations (APPF). 

European political parties – mostly consisting of national member parties, and few individual members – have the right to campaign during the European elections, for which they often adopt manifestos outlining their positions and ambitions. Ahead of the elections, some of them designate their preferred candidate (known as Spitzenkandidat or lead candidate) to be the next President of the European Commission. The work of European parties can be supplemented by that of an officially affiliated European political foundation; foundations are independent from European parties and contribute to the public debate on policy issues and European integration.

European parties&#x27; counterparts in the European Parliament are the Parliament&#x27;s political groups. European parties influence the decision-making process of the European Council through coordination meetings with their affiliated heads of state and government. They also work closely with their members in the European Commission.

In addition to the registered European political parties, many other entities are politically active at the European level without meeting the criteria for registration or wishing to register.

==History==

===1970s===
The first European political parties formed during the 1970s, in the run-up to the first elections of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage (adopted in 1976, and taking place for the first time in 1979). In 1973, following the enlargement of the European Community to Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, the enlarged Socialist congress met in Bonn and inaugurated the &quot;Confederation of the Socialist Parties of the European Community&quot;. In March 1976, the Federation of Liberal and Democrat Parties in Europe was founded in Stuttgart by parties from Denmark, France, Germany Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. A few months later, in July, party representatives from Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands met in Luxembourg and founded the European People&#x27;s Party.

===1990s===

In 1992, Section 41 of the Treaty of Maastricht added Article 138a to the Treaty of Rome. Article 138a (the so called &quot;party article&quot;) stated that &quot;Political parties at European level are important as a factor for integration within the Union. They contribute to forming a European awareness and to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union&quot;, thus officially recognising the existence of European political parties.

In 1997, the Treaty of Amsterdam established who should pay for expenditure authorised by the party article (renumbered Article 191). This provided a mechanism whereby European parties could be paid out of the budget of the European Union, and European parties started to spend the money. Such expenditure included the funding of national parties, an outcome not originally intended.

===2000–2003===
In June 2000, the European Court of Auditors considered that the funding of European political parties should not be carried out using appropriations made for political groups in the European Parliament, as had long been the case. This decision led the 2001 Treaty of Nice to add a second paragraph to Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (at the time, the &quot;Treaty establishing the European Economic Community&quot;) to explicitly allow the funding of European political parties from the budget of the European Union. The new paragraph stated that &quot;the Council, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251, shall lay down the regulations governing political parties at European level and in particular the rules regarding their funding.&quot; The reference to &quot;Article 251&quot; refers to the co-decision procedure, which involves both the European Parliament and the Council as co-legislators.

In November 2003, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted Regulation 2004/2003 &quot;on the regulations governing political parties at European level and the rules regarding their funding&quot;. Regulation 2004/2003 provided the first official definition of European political parties and created a framework for their public funding.

This framework provided that, out of a total envelope for European parties, 15% would be distributed equally (the lump sum), and 85% would be distributed in proportion to each party&#x27;s number of members of the European Parliament (MEP-based funding). Additionally, public funding could not exceed 75% of a European party&#x27;s reimbursable expenditure (referred to as the &quot;co-financing rate&quot;); this means that European parties were required to raise 25% of their budget from specific private sources (&quot;own resources&quot;), such as donations or member contributions. Regulation 2004/2003 also introduced transparency obligations, limitations on donations, and prohibitions on spending, including a ban on the direct or indirect funding of national parties and candidates.

===2004–2007===

The Regulation was later detailed by the Decision of the Bureau of the European Parliament of 29 March 2004 and amended by Regulation 1524/2007.

In particular, Regulation 1524/2007 clarified the funding framework and changed the co-financing rate, allowing public funding from the general budget of the European Union to reach 85% of European parties&#x27; reimbursable expenditure. This change meant that European parties were only requested to provide 15% in private co-financing.

Regulation 1524/2007 also allowed European parties to set up affiliated European political foundations, separate entities contributing to the debate on European issues, organising conferences, and carrying out research, and linking like-minded national political foundations. Finally, the revised regulation explicitly allows European parties to finance campaigns conducted for elections to the European Parliament.

===2014===

In October 2014, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Regulation 1141/2014, which replaced Regulation 2004/2003 and overhauled the framework for European political parties and foundations, including by giving them a European legal status. It also established the Authority for the European political parties and European political foundations (APPF), a standalone entity for the purpose of registering, controlling, and imposing sanctions on European parties and foundations.

Regulation 1141/2014 applied as of 1 January 2017, and covered the activities of European parties and foundations starting with the financial year 2018. Since then, applications for public funding are placed with the APPF, but decisions on funding remain with the European Parliament.

===2018–2019===
In May 2018, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Regulation 2018/673, which amended Regulation 1141/2014 by detailing provisions relating to the registration of political parties and foundations, and transparency regarding political programmes and party logos.

Among others, Regulation 2018/673 introduced a number of changes, including the following:
* within the overall amount of public funding available, the shares of the lump sum and of the MEP-based funding were brought, respectively, to 10 and 90% (compared with 15 and 85% before); and
* European parties&#x27; co-financing rate was brought down to 10% (compared to 15% before).

In March 2019, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Regulation 2019/493, which further amended Regulation 1141/2014. Changes focused mostly on the use of personal data by European political parties and foundations. The modalities of the implementation of the Regulation were later updated by the Decision of the Bureau of the European Parliament of 1 July 2019.

===2020s===
In June 2021, in line with Article 38 of Regulation 1141/2014, MEPs Charles Goerens (ALDE) and Rainer Wieland (EPP) of the European Parliament&#x27;s Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) presented a draft report on the implementation of the Regulation. With regards to funding, the draft report called on the Commission and co-legislators to clarify the definition of indirect funding from European political parties and foundations to national member parties, remove the ban on financing referendum campaigns on European issues, allow the funding of European parties from non-EU national parties (which, following Brexit, meant that political parties in the UK could no longer finance European parties), broaden the categories of private funding, decrease European parties&#x27; co-financing rate, and simplify accounting procedures.

In November 2021, the European Commission proposed a text for a new regulation aimed at replacing Regulation 1141/2021, using the recast procedure. The Commission&#x27;s document proposes a definition of political advertising, strengthens provisions on gender balance, clarifies the requirements for the display of the logo of the European political party by its member parties, and extends the obligation to comply with EU values to member parties. With regards to funding, this proposal retained the European Parliament&#x27;s suggestion to lower European parties&#x27; co-financing rate (decreasing it from 10% down to 5%, and down to 0% in election years). It also included a new category of &quot;own resources&quot;, allowing European parties to raise private funding from specific economic activities, such as seminar fees or publication sales; funding from this new category would be capped at 5% of European parties&#x27; budget. Finally, it proposed allowing European parties to receive contributions from national member parties located in non-EU members of the Council of Europe. The European Parliament&#x27;s AFCO Committee criticised the decision of the European Commission to opt for the recast method, which effectively limits discussions to the provisions of the Regulation which the Commission has decided to modify and prevents a wider review of the Regulation.

In March 2022, the Council of the European Union adopted a political agreement (its own negotiating position). In July 2022, the European Parliament&#x27;s AFCO Committee adopted its own position, which was endorsed by the Plenary in September 2022. Trilogues between the European Parliament, Council of the European Union, and European Commission took place in September, October and November 2022, and in March 2023, but did not reach an agreement.

==Organisation==

===Registration===
Article 3 of Regulation 1141/2014 lists the following criteria for an entity to register as a European political party with the APPF:
* It must be a political alliance, which is defined, in Article 2, as a &quot;structured cooperation between political parties and/or citizens&quot;; Additionally, in its November 2020 ACRE v Parliament ruling, the General Court of the European Union clarified that &quot;citizen&quot;, as used in Regulation 1141/2014, meant &quot;Union citizens&quot;, and that political parties outside of the EU could not be regarded as political parties within the meaning of Regulation 1141/2014 because they were not composed of Union citizens.
* it must have its seat in a Member State, as indicated in its statutes;
* its member parties must be represented by, in at least one quarter of the Member States, members of the European Parliament, of national parliaments, of regional parliaments or of regional assemblies, or it or its member parties must have received, in at least one quarter of the Member States, at least three per cent of the votes cast in each of those Member States at the most recent elections to the European Parliament;
* its member parties must not be members of another European political party;
* it must observe, in particular in its programme and activities, the values on which the Union is founded, as expressed in Article 2 TEU;
* it or its members must have participated in elections to the European Parliament, or have expressed publicly the intention to participate in the next elections to the European Parliament; and
* it must not pursue profit goals.

Additionally, Article 4 imposes the following conditions regarding European parties&#x27; governance:
* the statutes must comply with the relevant laws of the Member State in which the party has its seat;
* the statutes must include provisions covering the following:
** the name and logo of the party, which must be clearly distinguishable from those of other European parties and foundations;
** the address of its seat;
** a political programme setting out its purpose and objectives;
** a statement that it does not pursue for-profit goals;
** the name of its affiliated political foundation and a description of the formal relationship between them (if applicable);
** its administrative and financial organisation and procedures, specifying in particular the bodies and offices holding the powers of administrative, financial and legal representation and the rules on the establishment, approval and verification of annual accounts; and
** the internal procedure to be followed in the event of its voluntary dissolution;
* the statutes must also include provisions on internal party organisation covering at least the following:
** the modalities for the admission, resignation and exclusion of its members, the list of its member parties being annexed to the statutes;
** the rights and duties associated with all types of membership and the relevant voting rights;
** the powers, responsibilities and composition of its governing bodies, specifying for each the criteria for the selection of candidates and the modalities for their appointment and dismissal;
** its internal decision-making processes, in particular the voting procedures and quorum requirements;
** its approach to transparency, in particular in relation to bookkeeping, accounts and donations, privacy and the protection of personal data; and
** the internal procedure for amending its statutes.

===Membership===
European political parties are mostly made up of national member parties. Additionally, European citizens can become individual members of some European parties, depending on the provisions of those parties&#x27; statutes.

The count of MEPs &quot;for the purpose of European public funding&quot; is separate from the question of individual membership, as MEPs are considered &quot;members of a European party&quot; primarily if they are members of a European party&#x27;s national member parties. As a result, many European parties have more MEPs than they have individual members.

====Member parties====
Member parties are national political parties with some form of membership described in the statutes of the European political party. In its &quot;November 2020 ACRE v Parliament&quot; ruling, the General Court of the European Union clarified that political parties outside of the EU could not be regarded as political parties within the meaning of Regulation 1141/2014, because they were not composed of Union citizens.

In its guidance, the APPF that European parties &quot;are free to cooperate with parties or organisations by means of ancillary forms of association (e.g., observers, partners, associates, affiliates)&quot;, but only a &quot;member&quot; can be claimed to meet the registration criteria, and only they can provide member contributions. Being considered a member &quot;requires a genuine membership link with the European political party&quot;, which includes &quot;a full range of rights and obligations [...] in particular voting/participation/access to documents&quot; and &quot;an appropriate membership fee&quot;.

====Individual members====
There is no legal definition of what constitutes individual membership, leading European parties to define them differently. A common trait is their absence of, or limited, input in party decision-making; some parties comprise internal bodies representing individual members with a collective vote, others do not provide them with voting rights at all. Below is the number of individual members per European party, as reported by the European Parliament:


===Funding===


European parties use public and private funding to finance their activities; public funding refers exclusively to funding from the general budget of the European Union, and cannot directly come from Member States or third countries, or entities under their control.

With regards to public funding, each year, the European Parliament allocates a total amount of money to fund European political parties qualifying for European public funding: 10% of this amount is distributed via a lump sum, allocated equally to all qualifying European parties, while 90% is distributed in proportion to each party&#x27;s share MEPs.

For the financial year 2025, European political parties were allocated a total of €46 million. Depending on their own application for European public funding and on their amount of &quot;reimbursable expenses&quot;, European parties may &quot;in fine&quot; receive less than their maximum allocation. European public funding accounts for the vast majority of European parties&#x27; income.

For instance, the comparison of maximum allocations and final amounts of public funding for the year 2021 was as follows:


With regards to private funding, European parties mostly receive financial contributions from their national member parties, which, in turn, almost always receive public funding from Member States. Donations from legal persons and, especially, from individuals only play a limited role.

The APPF monitors donations and contributions to European political parties, and publishes a yearly list of political donors.

===Sanctions===

Article 6 of Regulation 1141/2014 empowers the APPF to impose sanctions on European parties, as detailed in Article 27.

====Framework====
The APPF can deregister a European political party if:
* it has been found guilty of engaging in illegal activities detrimental to the financial interests of the Union;
* it no longer fulfils one or more of the registration criteria;
* the decision to register the party was based on incorrect or misleading information; and
* it has seriously failed to fulfil its obligations under national law .

The APPF can apply financial sanctions to a European party if:
* it has failed to submit amendments to its statutes or an updated list of its member parties in due time;
* it does not comply with its governance obligations; 
* it has failed to transmit the list of donors and their corresponding donations in due time;
* it does not comply with its accounting or reporting obligations; 
* it is found guilty of engaging in illegal activities detrimental to the financial interests of the Union;
* it has omitted information or provided false or misleading information; 
* it has abused the rules of personal data protection to influence elections to the European Parliament; 
* it has accepted unlawful donations or contributions; and
* it has infringed on the prohibitions of funding.

Additionally, the European Parliament may exclude a European party from future public funding for up to 10 years if it has engaged in illegal activities detrimental to the financial interests of the Union, or has omitted information or provided false or misleading information.

====Penalties====
For &quot;non-quantifiable infringements&quot;, the financial sanction ranges from 5 to 20% of the annual budget of the European political party, and 50% of its annual budget when it has engaged in illegal activities detrimental to the financial interests of the Union.

For &quot;quantifiable infringements&quot;, the financial sanction ranges from 100 to 300% of the irregular sums received or not reported, up to a maximum of 10% of the party&#x27;s annual budget.

====Sanctions applied====
In October 2023, the APPF sanctioned the Identity and Democracy Party for &quot;intentionally providing incorrect information about its board composition to the public&quot;. The financial sanction applied amounted to 5% of the party&#x27;s annual budget, or €47,021.

==European political parties==

, there are twelve European political parties registered with the APPF: 


==Former European parties==
The entities below were formerly registered with the APPF.
The entities below qualified at some point for European public funding; however, they were never registered with the APPF.
==Other political entities==

In addition to the registered European political parties, many other entities are politically active at the European level without meeting the criteria for registration or wishing to register. They differ by their level of integration, their purpose, and their membership. 

Some are strongly centralised and resemble national parties but operating across Europe, such as Volt Europa or DieM25; they are often referred to or refer to themselves as &quot;transnational parties&quot; or &quot;movements&quot;, and sometimes erroneously as &quot;European parties&quot;. 

Others are more loosely organised and act as networks or fora for national political parties. These entities sometimes provide a common electoral platform for the European elections for their members.

==Relationship with the European Parliament==

Political groups of the European Parliament are the officially recognised parliamentary groups consisting of legislators of aligned ideologies in the European Parliament. Each political group is assumed to have a set of common political principles.

A political group of the European Parliament usually constitutes the formal parliamentary representation of one or two of the European political parties, sometimes supplemented by members from other national political parties or independent politicians. It is strictly forbidden for political groups to organise or finance political campaigns during European elections, since this is the exclusive responsibility of European parties. 


==Presence in European institutions==
As of February 2025, European political parties&#x27; combined presence in European institutions was as follows:
==Criticism==
===Funding framework===
The framework for the funding of European political parties has been criticised for not providing a level-playing field for smaller parties and for making European parties too dependent on public funding.

Under the current framework for public funding, 90% of the total envelope for European parties is distributed in proportion to parties&#x27; number of MEPs. This high reliance on MEPs directly disadvantages smaller parties failing to meet national electoral thresholds for European elections. As a result, votes under an electoral threshold do not lead to public funding. In their draft report on the implementation of Regulation 1141/2014, rapporteurs Charles Goerens and Rainer Wieland called for the distribution of public funding to be based on the number of votes received in the last European elections. The implementation report adopted by the European Parliament&#x27;s AFCO Committee called on the Commission to assess whether vote-based funding schemes could be used, and noted that this change could increase turnout and promote pluralism.

The European Free Alliance also proposed to reduce the share of public funding distributed in proportion to parties&#x27; number of MEPs from 90 to 85%. This was the share of MEP-based funding between 2004 and 2018, prior to the entry into force of Regulation 1141/2014. This would increase the share of public funding distributed equally among European parties (the &quot;lump sum&quot;).

In practice, public funding accounts for 85-90% of European parties&#x27; income. While this reliance on public funding means that European parties are not beholden to private interests or wealthy donors, this extremely high percentage means that European parties only have a limited incentive to reach out to citizens for support. This is particularly true since most of European parties&#x27; private income (the remaining 10–15%) stems from national member parties&#x27; contributions, which includes national public funding. As a result, direct donations from citizens to European parties are marginal; several European parties, including the EPP and PES, the two largest European parties, do not raise donations from individuals. European parties themselves have continuously called for the decrease of their co-financing rate, stating that private funds were difficult to raise. This rate stood at 25% in 2004, at 15% in 2007, and at 10% since 2018; following calls from the European Parliament, the European Commission proposed bringing this rate down to 5%, and to 0% in election years.

More generally, the current public funding framework was criticised for failing to reward other important aspects of political parties than electoral performance, such as the enrollment of individual members or the raising of private donations from citizens.

===Limited ties with national parties===
Articles 22 prohibits European political parties from directly or indirectly funding other political parties, in particular national parties or candidates, and from financing referendum campaigns. While the prohibition on the funding of national parties was set in place in order to avoid the diversion of European public funding to national parties and national politics, it also prevents the consolidation of links between national and European political parties. Additionally, European parties have complained that this phrasing was difficult to reconcile with that of Article 21 allowing European parties to campaign for European elections.

In its 2021 report on the implementation of Regulation 1141/2014, the European Parliament opined that the ban on financing referendum campaigns on EU issues went against the purpose of European political parties, and called for this prohibition to be lifted.

===Lack of transparency===
Regulation 1141/2014 was criticised for its lack of transparency on European party funding. Currently, the APPF provides the identity of individual donors for donations above €3,000 per year, and between €1,500 and €3,000 if the donor gave their consent. no donation between €1,500 and €3,000 was ever published with the identity of an individual donor. In their draft report on the implementation of Regulation 1141/2014, rapporteurs Charles Goerens and Rainer Wieland called for an obligation to report publicly on all donations, regardless of their value; other MEPs proposed to intensify scrutiny for donations under €500 per year and per donor.

In its &quot;Logos Project&quot; report of April 2021, analysing the visibility of European parties&#x27; logos on the websites of their national member parties, European Democracy Consulting found that &quot;national member parties overwhelmingly fail to properly implement the Regulation’s display requirement and to ensure the necessary visibility of their link to their European party of affiliation.&quot; This conclusion was uphelp by the European Parliament in its implementation report of Regulation 1141/2014, which recalled the requirement to &quot;display the logo, political programme and website link of their European party of affiliation on their websites &#x27;in a clearly visible and user-friendly manner&#x27;&quot;, and expressed its concern that &quot;according to European Democracy Consulting’s Logos project, national member parties overwhelmingly fail to properly implement the Regulation&#x27;s display requirement, as only 15 % of them display the logo in a clear and user-friendly manner&quot;. Accordingly, the European Parliament called on the Commission &quot;to provide clear requirements and detailed guidelines related to the visibility of the European political party of affiliation in order to ensure enforcement of Article 18(2)(a) of the Regulation on displaying European political parties&#x27; logos alongside the logos of national or regional parties&quot;.

Finally, the APPF and European Parliament were criticised for publishing information on the funding of European parties on separate websites, and, in the case of the European Parliament, on a sub-website dedicated to &quot;contracts and grants&quot;, further limiting the visibility and coherence of the information provided to citizens. Meanwhile, Article 32.1 of Regulation 1141/2014 calls on the European Parliament and APPF to publish information &quot;on a website created for that purpose&quot;, seemingly calling for all information to be reported on a single platform.

<doc id="767584" wikidata="Q828043" url="?curid=767584" title="Bouillabaisse">
<text>Bouillabaisse ( , , ; ) is a traditional Provençal fish soup originating in the port city of Marseille. The word is originally a compound of the two Provençal verbs (&#x27;to boil&#x27;) and (&#x27;to reduce heat&#x27;, i.e. &#x27;simmer&#x27;).

Bouillabaisse was originally a dish made by Marseille fishermen, using bony rockfish, which they were unable to sell to restaurants or markets. There are at least three kinds of fish in a traditional bouillabaisse: typically red rascasse (&quot;Scorpaena scrofa&quot;); sea robin; and European conger. It can also include gilt-head bream, turbot, monkfish, mullet, or European hake. It usually also includes shellfish and other seafood such as sea urchins, mussels, velvet crabs, spider crabs, or octopus. More expensive versions may add langoustine (Dublin Bay prawn; Norway lobster), though this was not part of the traditional dish made by Marseille fishermen. Vegetables such as leeks, onions, tomatoes, celery, and potatoes are simmered together with the broth and served with the fish. The broth is traditionally served with &quot;rouille&quot;, a mayonnaise made of olive oil, garlic, saffron, and cayenne pepper, on grilled slices of bread.

What makes a bouillabaisse different from other fish soups is the selection of Provençal herbs and spices in the broth; the use of bony local Mediterranean fish; the way the fish are added one at a time, and brought to a boil; and the method of serving. In Marseille, the broth is served first in a soup plate with slices of bread and rouille, then the fish is served separately on a large platter (see image at top); or, more simply, as Julia Child suggests, the fish and broth are brought to the table separately and served together in large soup plates.

==Marseille bouillabaisse==
Recipes for bouillabaisse vary from family to family in Marseille, and local restaurants dispute which versions are the most authentic.

In 1980, 11 Marseille restaurateurs collaborated to draw up the Bouillabaisse Charter which codified both ingredients and method of preparation. An authentic Marseille bouillabaisse must include &quot;rascasse&quot; (&quot;Scorpaena scrofa&quot;), a bony rockfish which lives in the calanque and reefs close to shore. It usually also has &quot;congre&quot; (eng: European conger) and &quot;grondin&quot; (eng: sea robin). According to the &quot;Michelin Guide Vert&quot;, the four essential elements of a true bouillabaisse are the presence of rascasse, the freshness of the fish; olive oil, and excellent saffron.

The American chef and food writer Julia Child, who lived in Marseille for a year, wrote: &quot;to me the telling flavor of bouillabaisse comes from two things: the Provençal soup base—garlic, onions, tomatoes, olive oil, fennel, saffron, thyme, bay, and usually a bit of dried orange peel—and, of course, the fish—lean (non-oily), firm-fleshed, soft-fleshed, gelatinous, and shellfish.&quot;

==Ingredients==
The ingredients of a traditional Marseille bouillabaisse vary depending upon what fish are available that day and the taste of the chef. These are the typical ingredients used in one of the most traditional Marseille restaurants, the Grand Bar des Goudes on Rue Désirée-Pelleprat:

Four kilograms of fish and shellfish, including, on a typical day, &quot;grondin&quot; (sea robin), &quot;Rascasse&quot; (&quot;Scorpaena scrofa&quot;), &quot;rouget grondin&quot; (red gurnard), &quot;congre&quot; (conger eel), &quot;baudroie&quot; (lotte, or monkfish), &quot;Saint-Pierre&quot; (John Dory), &quot;vive&quot; (weever), and sea urchins. Other ingredients in the broth include a kilogram of potatoes, seven cloves of garlic, onions, ripe tomatoes, and a cup of olive oil. The broth is seasoned with a bouquet garni, fennel, eight pistils of saffron, salt and Cayenne pepper.

The &quot;rouille&quot;, a spicy mayonnaise which is spread on thick slices of country bread and floated on the bouillabaisse when served, is made with an egg yolk, two cloves of garlic, a cup of olive oil, and ten pistils of saffron, and is seasoned with salt and Cayenne pepper.

==Preparation of a traditional bouillabaisse==
In the traditional bouillabaisse served in Marseille restaurants, first the fish are cleaned and scaled and then washed, usually with sea water. Then the fish are cut into large slices, keeping the bones. Next olive oil is put into a large casserole, and onions, cleaned and sliced, are added, along with crushed garlic and tomatoes, peeled and quartered, without seeds. This mixture is browned at low heat for about five minutes, so that the olive oil takes on the flavors of the other ingredients.

When this has been done, the sliced fish are added, beginning with the thickest slices. The fish is covered with boiling water, and salt, pepper, fennel, the &quot;bouquet garni&quot; and the saffron. The dish is simmered at low heat, and stirred from time to time so that the fish does not stick to the casserole. The fish simmer as the broth is then reduced, usually about twenty minutes.

When the bouillabaisse is done, the rouille is prepared: the stem of the garlic is removed; the garlic cloves are crushed into a fine paste with a pestle in a mortar; the egg yolk and saffron are added and blended with olive oil little by little to make a mayonnaise.

The potatoes are peeled, cut into large slices and boiled in salted water for 15 to 20 minutes.

The last step is to open the sea urchins with a pair of scissors, and to remove the &quot;corail&quot; (gonads) with a small spoon. The pieces of fish are then arranged on a platter, and the &quot;corail&quot; of the sea urchins is added to the broth and stirred.

In this traditional version, the bouillon is served first, very hot, with the rouille spread on thick slices of bread rubbed with garlic. The fish and potatoes are served next on a separate platter.

Another version of the classic Marseille bouillabaisse, presented in the &quot;Petit Larousse de la Cuisine&quot;, uses congre, dorade, grondin, lotte, merlan, rascasse, saint-pierre, and velvet crabs (), and includes leeks. In this version, the heads and trimmings of the fish are put together with onions, celery and garlic browned in olive oil, and covered with boiling water for twenty minutes. Then the vegetables and bouquet garni are added, and then the pieces of fish in a specific order; first the rascasse, then the grondin, the lotte, congre, dorade, etrilles, and saffran. The dish is cooked for eight minutes over high heat. Then the most delicate fish, the saint pierre and merlan, are added, and the dish is cooked another 5–8 minutes. The broth is then served over bread with the rouille on top, and the fish and crabs are served on a large platter.

Other variations add different seasonings, such as orange peel, and sometimes a cup of white wine or cognac is added.

==Marcel Pagnol==
The French screenwriter and playwright Marcel Pagnol, a member of the Académie française and a native of Marseille, showed his own idea of a proper bouillabaisse in two of his films. In &quot;&quot; (1935), the chef Cigalon serves a &quot;bouillabaisse provençale aux poissons de roche&quot;, (Bouillabaisse of Provence with rockfish) made with a kilogram of local fish; &quot;Scorpaena scrofa&quot; (&quot;rascasse&quot;); capelin; angler fish (&quot;baudroie&quot;); John Dory (&quot;Saint-Pierre&quot;); and slipper lobster (&quot;cigale de mer&quot;). &quot;When I put these fish into the pan,&quot; Cigalon says, &quot;they were still wiggling their tails.&quot; Cigalon specifies that the slices of bread served with the broth should be thick and not toasted, and that the rouille &quot;should not have too much pepper.&quot;

In the 1936 film &quot;César&quot;, Pagnol&#x27;s hero Marius reveals the secret of the bouillabaisse of a small bistro near the port in Marseille. &quot;Everybody knows it,&quot; Marius says: &quot;they perfume the broth with a cream of sea urchins.&quot;

==History==
The Phoceans who founded Marseille in 600 BC, ate a simple fish broth known in Ancient Greek as &quot;kakavia&quot;. Another fish soup also appears in Roman mythology: it is the dish that Venus fed to Vulcan. They were different from the boullabaisse as they did not include saffron and rouille.

The name bouillabaisse comes from the method of the preparation—the ingredients are not added all at once. The broth is first boiled (&quot;bolh&quot;) then the different kinds of fish are added one by one, and each time the broth comes to a boil, the heat is lowered (&quot;abaissa&quot;).

Generally fish soups are found in France (bourride, chaudrée), Greece, Italy (&quot;zuppa di pesce&quot;), Portugal (&quot;caldeirada&quot;), Spain (&quot;sopa de pescado y marisco&quot;, Catalonia (), and all the countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea. What makes a bouillabaisse different from these other dishes are the local Provençal herbs and spices, the particular selection of bony Mediterranean coastal fish, and the way the broth is served separately from the fish and vegetables.

<doc id="767586" wikidata="Q521501" url="?curid=767586" title="Conrad Vernon">
<text>Conrad Vernon (born July 11, 1968) is an American director, producer, writer, storyboard artist and voice actor, best known for his work on the DreamWorks animated film series &quot;Shrek&quot; as well as other films such as &quot;Monsters vs. Aliens&quot;, &quot;Madagascar 3: Europe&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, and &quot;Penguins of Madagascar&quot;. He also co-directed non-DreamWorks animated films such as Sony Pictures&#x27; &quot;Sausage Party&quot; and MGM&#x27;s &quot;The Addams Family&quot;.

==Life and career==
Conrad Vernon was born on July 11, 1968, a native of Lubbock, Texas, studied at CalArts and worked as a storyboard artist for animated productions (including Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s &quot;Cool World&quot;); he also directed &quot;Morto the Magician&quot; (a four-minute animated film written by Steve Martin).

Vernon began his career in 1991. In 1996, he joined DreamWorks, where he worked as a storyboard artist on &quot;Antz&quot;. After &quot;Antz&quot; proved a success as the first animated feature film to be produced by DreamWorks Animation, Vernon signed on as a writer for &quot;Shrek&quot;, where he was responsible for the Gingerbread Man, and eventually voiced that character. He also appeared in &quot;Shrek 4-D&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

In June 2004, he made his feature film directorial debut with the Academy Award-nominated &quot;Shrek 2&quot;. He voiced Mason the chimpanzee for the DreamWorks Animation films &quot;Madagascar&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Madagascar 3: Europe&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; (for which he is also credited as director) and its spin off &quot;Penguins of Madagascar&quot; (where he voiced Rico, one of the penguins) and reprised the voice of Mason in the television series.

In 2009, Vernon and Rob Letterman co-directed the 3D animated film &quot;Monsters vs. Aliens&quot;, which he co-wrote and supplied several voices.

Vernon and Greg Tiernan co-directed the adult animated comedy &quot;Sausage Party&quot; (2016), from a story by Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, and Jonah Hill, as well as providing some of the voices. Vernon next co-produced and co-directed, again with Tiernan, an animated version of &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, which was released in October 2019. He supplied voice roles for both &quot;Sausage Party&quot; and &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, including Lurch in the latter. He was scheduled to return as director alongside Tiernan for &quot;The Addams Family 2&quot;, released in October 2021. In October 2020, it was announced that he would no longer be involved as director, though he ultimately received co-billing with Tiernan.

In 2017, Vernon was hired to direct a live-action feature adaptation of &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, from a screenplay by Matt Lieberman, which is being made by Warner Bros., under its Warner Animation Group banner.

<text>Upper Nile is a state in South Sudan. The White Nile flows through the state, giving it its name. The state also shares a similar name with the region of Greater Upper Nile, of which it was part along with the states of Unity and Jonglei. It had an area of . Malakal was the capital of the state. The towns of Upper Nile State include Akoka, Melut, Renk, Kodok along with it&#x27;s numerous counties such as Ulang County, Maiwut County and Nasir County. The Greater Upper Nile is the location of the Fashoda Incident that ended the &quot;Scramble for Africa&quot;, and is located in the historical state of Upper Nile. The Upper Nile State seceded from Sudan as part of the Republic of South Sudan on 9 July 2011.

In October 2015, the states of South Sudan were reorganized into 28 states by President Salva Kiir. This was reversed as the result of a peace agreement signed on 22 February 2020.

<text>The axilla (: axillae or axillas; also known as the armpit, underarm or oxter) is the area on the human body directly under the shoulder joint. It includes the axillary space, an anatomical space within the shoulder girdle between the arm and the thoracic cage, bounded superiorly by the imaginary plane between the superior borders of the first rib, clavicle and scapula (above which are considered part of the neck), medially by the serratus anterior muscle and thoracolumbar fascia, anteriorly by the pectoral muscles and posteriorly by the subscapularis, teres major and latissimus dorsi muscle.

The soft skin covering the lateral axilla contains many hair and sweat glands. In humans, the formation of body odor happens mostly in the axilla. These odorant substances have been suggested by some to serve as pheromones, which play a role related to mate selection, although this is a controversial topic within the scientific community. The underarms seem more important than the pubic area for emitting body odor, which may be related to human bipedalism.

==Structure==
===Boundaries===
Anatomically, the boundaries of the &quot;axilla&quot; are:
The lower posterior boundary is called the posterior axillary fold and this is a compound structure consisting of the latissimus dorsi and teres major muscles. It can descend after weight loss.

The anterior boundary is called the anterior axillary fold and this is rounded in shape and formed by the lower border of the pectoralis major. 
Some sources also include the pectoralis minor. It can elongate after weight loss.

The contents of the axilla include the axillary vein and artery, as well as the brachial plexus, lymph nodes and fat.
The axilla is the space between the side of the thorax and the upper arm.

===Contents===

* Axillary artery and its branches
* Axillary vein and its tributaries
* Infraclavicular part of the brachial plexus
* Long thoracic and intercostobrachial nerves
* Five groups of axillary lymph nodes and the associated lymphatics
* Axillary fat and areolar tissue in which the other contents are embedded

==Society and culture==
The term &quot;underarm&quot; typically refers to the outer surface of the axilla. However, the terms are sometimes used interchangeably in casual contexts. Colloquially, &quot;underarm &quot; refers to the hollow beneath the junction of the arm and shoulder.

===Tickling===

The underarm is a ticklish area due to the number of nerves it contains. Most people find this area to be particularly unpleasant when tickled.

===Underarm hair===
Underarm hair usually grows in the underarms of both females and males, beginning in adolescence.

In some modern Western cultures, it is common for older women to remove underarm hair. Some view this practice as an aesthetic matter, while others view its removal for health-related concerns. As underarm hair grows quickly, removal must be performed frequently, or stubble will appear in the axilla.

In most culture and scenes, women retain their underarm hair for a variety of reasons, from subversion to egalitarianism to comfort or for hygienic reason. Conversely but uncommonly, some men choose to remove their underarm hair for aesthetic reasons or to reduce friction in sports such as swimming.
==Clinical significance==
Like other flexion surfaces of large joints (groin, popliteal fossa, cubital fossa and essentially the anterior part of the neck), it is an area where blood vessels and nerves pass relatively superficially, and with an increased amount of lymph nodes.

===Lymphogenic spread of breast cancer===
Breast cancer typically spreads via lymphatic vessels to the lymph nodes found in the axilla.

===Axillary intertrigo===
Excessive perspiration without adequate air circulation can result in axillary intertrigo. Intertrigo is an inflammatory skin condition of skin folds exposed to friction or maceration in the presence of heat and moisture. Intertrigo is worsened by infection, usually fungal (Candida yeast species), but also bacterial or viral; warm, wet underarms promote those growths. The condition results in rash-like symptoms, pustules, or chronic itching or burning in the underarm. Intertrigo (in any site) has no racial or sexual predilection. Axillary intertrigo is common among those who work in hot environments where air circulation is restricted by necessary clothing or safety equipment.

<text>* 

Buck Island Reef National Monument protects Buck Island, a small, uninhabited 176-acre (712,000 m²) island about north of the northeast coast of Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, and 18,839 acres of submerged lands, totaling 19,015 acres. It was first established as a protected area by the U.S. Government in 1948, with the intention of preserving “one of the finest marine gardens in the Caribbean Sea.” The U.S. National Monument was created in 1961 by John F. Kennedy and greatly expanded in 2001 by Bill Clinton, over the opposition of local fishermen. Buck Island National Monument is one of few places in the Virgin Islands where brown pelicans and threatened least terns nest.

Most of the Monument area, which is administered by the National Park Service, is underwater and attracts around 50,000 visitors a year. With its reef there is plenty to explore and experience in the water. Snorkelers can follow a marked underwater trail on the eastern tip. It is one of only three underwater trails in the United States. Along the trail are plaques denoting information about marine flora and fauna commonly found in the area. Two thirds of the island is surrounded by an elkhorn coral barrier reef, providing an ecosystem for over 250 fish species and a variety of other marine life including spotted eagle rays, nurse sharks and lemon sharks, and juvenile Blacktip reef sharks and Whitetip reef sharks. In the spring endangered Leatherback turtles come onto the beach to nest while Green turtles and Hawksbill turtles nest during the summer months. Turtle Beach on the western edge of the island features a pristine white sand beach and has been voted one of the world&#x27;s most beautiful beaches by National Geographic.

The National Park Service has been monitoring Buck Island for over 40 years. Most of the research is focused on coral, fish, sea turtles, brown pelicans and least tern nesting. West beach is one of the most active turtle nesting beaches in the world with one of the longest continually operating research programs.

To ensure the ecosystem continues to thrive, the National Park Service requires all visitors to use authorized concessioners providing guided tours or have a permit if on private vessels without paying customers. To help protect the natural environment, visitors are encouraged to wear non-toxic reef safe sunscreen or a rash guard while swimming in the waters surrounding Buck Island Reef National Monument.

<text>Red Sea State ( &quot;&quot;) is one of the 18 states of Sudan. It has an area of 212,800 km2 and an estimated population of 1,482,053 in 2018. Port Sudan is the capital of the state. Sudan claims, but does not control, the Halaib Triangle, a region disputed between Sudan and Egypt. The original inhabitants of the state are the Beja people who constitute more than 65% of the total population, with lower wealth and power in the region.

==Geography==
===Overview===
Geographically, in the east, bordering the state, is the Red Sea. Inland, mountains run from north to south, which are interrupted by arid plains. To the northwest is the Nubian Desert. The Siyal Islands are located in the disputed area between Egypt and Sudan in the northeast.

The Sudanese state is divided into the eight administrative areas: Bur Sudan (Port Sudan), Gebiet Elma&#x27;din, Halayib, Haya, Sawakin, Sinkat, Gunob Awlieb, Derodieb, Tokar and Ageeg.

<text>Walter Francis Dillingham (April 5, 1875 – October 22, 1963) called the &quot;Baron of Hawaii Industry&quot;, was an American industrialist and businessman from Honolulu, Hawaii. He gained favors from Hawaii politicians to develop urban Honolulu and Waikiki.

==Early life and family==
Dillingham was born in Honolulu, in the Kingdom of Hawaii. His father was Benjamin Dillingham who founded the Oahu Railway and Land Company. His mother was Emma Louise Smith, daughter of missionaries Lowell and Abigail Smith. 

In 1889 he moved to the United States to attend school in Auburndale, Massachusetts, and then Harvard University 1898–1900. 

== Career ==
He first worked as a clerk for his father, and then managed the Dowsett Company and founded Hawaiian Dredging Company. In 1904 his father was hospitalized and he managed the OR&amp;L. From 1907–1913, the Governor of the Territory of Hawaii was Walter F. Frear who was married to Dillingham&#x27;s sister Mary Emma.

In 1909 he constructed a dry dock at Pearl Harbor which eventually became part of the US Navy base. He also enlarged the ports of Kahului and Hilo.

On May 2, 1910 he married Louise Olga Gaylord in Florence, Italy. After his father died in 1918, he and his brother Harold Garfield Dillingham inherited the family businesses. During World War I he worked for the US Army Motor Transport Corps in Washington, DC.

Dillingham served on several commissions for the Territory of Hawaii, including the tax appeal court 1908–1910.

In 1919, Dillingham built a large house at Papaenaena, an ancient Hawaiian altar to the surf and place of human sacrifice to the god Kūkailimoku, on the slopes of Diamond Head. The home, called La Pietra, is now a private academy for girls. It was named after the estate of his wife&#x27;s relatives where they were married, Villa La Pietra.

Dillingham drained the wetlands of Waikīkī in the early 1920s and created the Ala Wai Canal, on whose banks the Hawaii Convention Center was built. He helped suppress Japanese Hawaiian plantation workers&#x27; calls for better labor conditions during the Oahu Sugar Strike of 1920, as chair of the Hawaii Emergency Labor Commission. The Hawaiian Sugar Planters&#x27; Association-sponsored commission petitioned the U.S. Senate to lift an 1882 ban on importing workers from China, hoping to use Chinese migrant laborers to replace the Japanese and break the strike. Dillingham is also seen as controversial for comments which by today&#x27;s standards would be considered racist after the Massie Trial of 1933, which resulted in the killing of a native Hawaiian and the beating of a Japanese Hawaiian by a mob of angry (and never-prosecuted) whites.

In 1948, Dillingham Airfield, a small Air Force base near Mokulēia, Hawaii was named for his son Captain Henry Gaylord Dillingham, a B-29 pilot who was killed in action over Kawasaki, Japan on July 25, 1945.

His son Benjamin Franklin Dillingham II (1916–1998) ran with the Hawaii Republican Party against Daniel Inouye for the Senate in 1962 and lieutenant governor in 1974 but lost both elections. 

== Death and legacy ==
The other Senator from Hawaii, Hiram Fong, gave the eulogy at his funeral, after his death October 22, 1963. Fong said he lived a life that spanned the full spectrum of Hawaiian history&quot;. Dillingham is buried at the Valley of the Temples Memorial Park in Kāneohe.

In 1961, his son Lowell Smith Dillingham (1911–1987) merged the remains of the Oahu Railway and Land Company and the Hawaiian Dredging and Construction Company to form the Dillingham Corporation. It was sold to private investors in 1983 for $347 million.

A daughter Elizabeth Dillingham (1921–2011) married investment banker Myron Arms Wick Jr. (1915—1990) in 1940.

<text>The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre is a professional conservatory for actors in New York City. First operational from 1915 to 1927, the school re-opened in 1928 and has been active ever since. It is the birthplace of the Meisner technique of acting, named for American actor and acting teacher Sanford Meisner.

==History==
The Neighborhood Playhouse had originally been founded as an off-Broadway theatre by philanthropists Alice Lewisohn and Irene Lewisohn in 1915, but closed in 1927. The following year, it re-opened as The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre. Neighborhood Playhouse joined American Academy of Dramatic Arts and Pasadena Playhouse as the only major professional training schools for the performing arts in the United States.

Sanford Meisner joined the faculty in 1935 from the Group Theatre. Meisner used his study of Russian theatre and acting innovator Konstantin Stanislavski&#x27;s system to develop his own technique, an alternative to Lee Strasberg&#x27;s method acting. The faculty also included Louis Horst, Agnes de Mille, and Martha Graham.

In 1939, when actor Gregory Peck enrolled, there were approximately 90 students at the school.

The New York City Council honored the 90th anniversary of Neighborhood Playhouse with a proclamation.

==Educational programs==
The school offers a two-year certificate program, with admission to the second year dependent upon unanimous approval of the faculty. There is also a summer program.

The Neighborhood Playhouse offers Playhouse Juniors, a Saturday training program for children in grades 1–12.

<text>Lakes State is a state in South Sudan. It has an area of 43,595.08 km2. Rumbek is the capital of the state. Lakes is in the Bahr el Ghazal region of South Sudan, in addition to Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Western Bahr el Ghazal, and Warrap states. Bahr el Ghazal itself was a former province which was split from the Anglo-Egyptian &quot;mudiriyat&quot;, or province of Equatoria in 1948. The eastern border was the White Nile with Jonglei State on the opposite bank. To the northeast lied the Unity State. Other borders included Warrap State towards the northwest, Western Equatoria to the south and west, and Central Equatoria to the south.

In July 2011, Ramciel in Lakes state was under consideration by the federal government as a site for a new national capital, which would replace Juba.

==Administration==
Like all states in South Sudan, Lakes was divided into counties; there were eight counties, each headed by a County Commissioner.

The counties are further divided into &quot;Payams&quot;, then &quot;Bomas&quot;.

==Disestablishment and re-establishment==
Lakes State was disestablished in October 2015 due to South Sudan&#x27;s President Salva Kiir Mayardit issuing a decree establishing 28 states in place of the 10 previously established states. As a result, the states of Eastern Lakes, Gok and Western Lakes were created. Lakes state was re-established by a peace agreement signed on 22 February 2020.

==Conflict==
Cattle raids were persistent in the Lakes State, between the Republic of Sudan and the former rebel group SPLA/M, since the CPA was signed in 2005. Human rights journalist Manyang Mayom reported heavily on government oppression in the Lakes State; his work won him the Human Rights Watch Award on August 4, 2010. Mayom was expelled from the Warrap State in November 2021 for his work in that region with the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS).

<doc id="767611" wikidata="Q309469" url="?curid=767611" title="Gezira State">
<text>Gezira (), also spelt Al Jazirah, Al Jazeera and Al Jazira, is one of the 18 states of Sudan. The state lies between the Blue Nile and the White Nile in the east-central region of the country. The state has a population of 5,096,920 as of 2018, and an area of 27,549 km2.

The state&#x27;s capital is Wad Madani. Gezira is known as an irrigated cotton-producing state as it is a well-populated area that is suitable for agriculture. The state&#x27;s name comes from the Arabic word for island.

==History==

The area was at the southern end of Nubia and little is known about its ancient history and only limited archaeological work has been conducted in this area. It was part of the kingdom of Alodia for several centuries, and with that state&#x27;s collapse in the early sixteenth century, it became the centre of the Funj Sultanate.

Katfia in Gezira was the place where the Wad Habuba Revolt took place in April 1908. The Gezira Scheme was a program launched in 1925 to foster cotton farming. At that time the Sennar Dam and numerous irrigation canals were built. Al Jazirah became the Sudan&#x27;s major agricultural region with more than under cultivation. 

The administrative state of Gezira was established on 1 July 1943, after the Blue Nile state was divided into three. The initial development project was semi-private, but the government nationalized it in 1950. Cotton production increased in the 1970s but by the 1990s increased wheat production has supplanted a third of the land formerly seeded with cotton.

The ongoing War in Sudan that begun in 2023 has caused a refugee crisis in the state, with an estimated 250,000 fleeing the state due to an offensive waged by the RSF on December 15, 2023 by December 18 of the same year. The RSF took control of most of the state, including Wad Madani until January 2025, when the Sudanese army recaptured the state leaving RSF in control of very little areas in the northwest part of the state. 

In October 2024, the state was affected by the widespread massacres.

== Districts and populated places ==
The capital of Gezira is Wad Madani. 

The state is divided into seven districts, namely:

* Al Kamlin
* East al Gazera
* North al Gazera
* Al Managil
* South al Gazera
* Um al Gura
* Wad Madani

Populated places include:

* Abushneib
* Al-Hasahisa
* Al Hilaliya
* Buwaidhaa
* El Manaqil
* Rufaa
* Tanub
* Wad Al-Noora
Other villages include:

* Al-Sireha

<doc id="767612" wikidata="Q310385" url="?curid=767612" title="Khartoum State">
<text>Khartoum State () is one of the eighteen states of Sudan. Although it is the smallest state by area (22,142 km2), it is the most populous state in Sudan - 5,274,321 in the 2008 census, and officially estimated at 7,993,900 in 2018. It contains the country&#x27;s largest city by population, Omdurman, together with the cities of North Khartoum and Khartoum; the City of Khartoum is the capital of the state as well as the national capital of Sudan. The capital city contains offices of the state, governmental and non-governmental organizations, cultural institutions, and the main airport.

The city is located in the heart of Sudan at the confluence of the White Nile and the Blue Nile, where the two rivers unite to form the River Nile. The confluence of the two rivers creates a unique effect. As they join, each river retains its own color: the White Nile with its bright whiteness and the Blue Nile with its alluvial brown color. These colors are more visible in the flood season.

The state lies between longitudes 31.5 to 34°E and latitudes 15 to 16°N. It is surrounded by River Nile State in the north-east, in the north-west by the Northern State, in the east and southeast by the states of Kassala, Qadarif, Gezira and White Nile State, and in the west by North Kurdufan.

==Etymology==
There are several etymologies for the name of Khartoum. The explanation suggested as &quot;most correct&quot; by the state government&#x27;s website is that it comes from the Arabic for &quot;elephant&#x27;s trunk&quot;, which describes the shape of the site of the city at the confluence of the two Niles, where a stretch of land extends into the water. Other stories are that it is a corruption of &quot;gurtoum&quot;, the name for seeds of the sunflower plant, supposedly used by Roman invaders at the current site of Khartoum to treat soldiers&#x27; wounds, or that it was derived from the words &quot;Khor al-Tom&quot;.

==Climate==
The northern region of the state is mostly desert because it receives barely any rainfall, whereas the other regions have semi-desert climates. The weather is rainy in the fall, and cold and dry in the winter. Average rainfall reaches in the north-eastern areas and in the northwestern areas.

The temperature in summer ranges from from April to June, and from in the months of July to October. In winter, the temperature declines gradually from to between November and March.

==Localities==
Khartoum has Seven Localities: 
*Khartoum (Capital)
*Omdurman
*Khartoum North
*Sharq an-Nīl
*Jabal Awliya
*Om Badda
*Karari

==Districts==
# Khartoum District
# Um Badda District
# Omdurman District
# Karary District
# Khartoum Bahri District
# Sharg En Nile District
# South Khartoum District

==Population and economy==
The 2008 population census estimated the population of Khartoum State to be about 5,274,321 capita, composed of various tribes of the Sudan. The population was officially estimated to have risen to 7,993,900 in 2018. The population in 2008 was 79% urban, and 74% of the state&#x27;s population reported their region of origin to be outside Khartoum.

The areas of Omdurman and the rural South are inhabited by the tribe of Gamowia, as well as by the Kordofani tribes displaced to these areas by the drought and desertification that hit their areas in the early- and mid-1980s. These are the tribes of the Kababish and the Kawahla. In the northern countryside of Karari locality are the tribe of Shiheinat, and in Khartoum North the tribes of Abdallab and Batahin. In the East Nile are the tribes of Abu Dileig, Batahin, and Kawahla, with the tribe of Iseilat in Um-Dowan.

Most of the population works in government service, the private sector, and banking. There is also a large number of merchants, and migrants and displaced people working in marginal activities. In the countryside most people are engaged in agriculture and grazing and thus supply the capital, Khartoum, with vegetables, fruits, and dairy products. There are also some residents living on the banks of the rivers engaged in the trades dependent on the rivers, such as pottery, brick-making and fishing. Above all stands the strong ambition to become the new Dubai with the financial support coming from the oil and gas supplies of the country.
The State of Khartoum is now the largest center in Sudan for the manufacturing sector with more than 7500 different factories and more than ten industrial areas providing all types of goods such as food processing and electronics and household appliances as well as medicines and textiles as well as footwear and tanneries and chemicals. Within the next year five Chinese car manufacturers will start operations to make Khartoum a hub for vehicle manufacturing in Africa.

==Museums and archeological sites==
Khartoum state contains archaeological sites dating back to different periods of civilization, both prehistoric and historical. Its museums include the largest in Sudan, the National Museum of Sudan, and a number of specialized museums, such as the Khalifa House Museum and the Museums of Natural History, Folklore and the Popular Heritage. There are also a center for study of folklore under the National Authority for the Arts, and the Omdurman Museum of Ibrahim Hijazi.

<doc id="767613" wikidata="Q483544" url="?curid=767613" title="Anaconda (installer)">
<text>Anaconda is a free and open-source system installer for Linux distributions.

Anaconda is used by Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Oracle Linux, Scientific Linux, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, CentOS, MIRACLE LINUX, Qubes OS, Fedora, Sabayon Linux and BLAG Linux and GNU, also in some less known and discontinued distros like Progeny Componentized Linux, Asianux, Foresight Linux, Rpath Linux and VidaLinux.

== Functionality ==
Anaconda offers a text-mode and GUI mode, so users can install on a wide range of systems. It is designed to be easily portable and supports a wide range of hardware platforms (IA-32, Itanium, DEC Alpha, IBM ESA/390, PowerPC, ARMv8). It supports installing from local storage devices like CD-ROM drives and harddisks as well as from network resources via FTP, HTTP, or NFS. Installations can be automated with the use of a kickstart file, that automatically configures the installation, allowing users to run it with minimal supervision. Before starting the OS installation process, the installer checks the system hardware and resource requirements. Only if the requirements are satisfied does it start the installation process.

== Technology ==
It is mainly written in Python with some modules written in C. It has a graphical frontend that is based on GTK+ 3/PyGObject and designed with the Glade Interface Designer. Anaconda also has a custom text frontend with support for computers with line printer like terminals, such as the IBM ESA/390 mainframes. A future update will introduce a Firefox based Web UI, replacing the currect GTK+ 3 based GUI.

== Under the hood ==
The Anaconda installer provides various useful tools and commands for both users with specific installation needs as well as for debugging issues with the installer itself or OS installation in general.

Anaconda supports a rich set of options that can be passed to the boot command line to influence installation behaviour. There is also a root shell running on TTY2 available for the user to inspect the installation environment during the installation run.

There are also various useful files in the installation environment:
* codice_1 - contains Anaconda related log messages (Anaconda also logs to codice_2)
* codice_3 - contains a list of names and versions of all packages that have been used to create the installation image
* codice_4 contains the kickstart used for the installation run (if any)

After a successful installation, Anaconda stores various important files from the installation run on the system itself. This makes it possible to check how the system was installed even at a later time.

* installation logs are stored in codice_5
* a kickstart file describing option selected during the installation run is stored in codice_6

The codice_7 file found on a system can be used (possibly with small changes) to install a very similar system again.

<doc id="767616" wikidata="Q309478" url="?curid=767616" title="Al Qadarif State">
<text>Al Qadarif ( &quot;&quot;), also spelled &quot;Gedaref&quot; or &quot;Gadarif&quot;, is one of the 18 wilayat (states) of Sudan. It covers an area of 75,263 km2 and had an estimated population of approximately 2,208,385 as of 2018. Al Qadarif is the state’s capital, with other notable towns including Doka and Gallabat. The state also encompasses the disputed Al Fushqa District.

==Demographics==

Gedaref State in Sudan is home to a diverse population consisting of various ethnic groups, including members of numerous tribes. Additionally, individuals from regions outside Sudan—such as Eritrea, Ethiopia, Yemen, Somalia, Chad, Egypt (including Copts), Armenia, and Kurdistan—contribute to its multicultural fabric. This intricate social structure has evolved over time due to historical migrations during the period of Turkish rule and the Mahdist Revolution, as well as changes in the state&#x27;s agricultural practices.

The state is a natural geographical area situated on the slopes of the Ethiopian plateau, descending towards rivers, valleys, and water-filled creeks. It is characterized by fertile clay soil, interspersed with occasional hills, which enhances its agricultural potential.

The state can be divided into three distinct geomorphic regions:
* Highlands: Located in the southeast along the Sudan-Ethiopia border, featuring mountains and isolated chains of hills.
* Plains: Characterized by flat, mud-rich lands and gentle slopes, forming the predominant landscape of the state.
* Valley Areas: Dominated by sedimentary landforms surrounding seasonal rivers, including the Atbara River, Rahad River, and Islam River.

==Agriculture==

The state is distinguished by its land, which is highly suitable for agriculture. It hosts some of Sudan&#x27;s largest rainfed agricultural projects, utilizing mechanized equipment such as tractors and combine harvesters that depend on rainfall. The state also features large-capacity silos for grain storage. Additionally, Al Qadarif boasts the largest market for private crops, including sesame and sorghum.

The state is considered a strategic center for food security in Sudan. Agriculture, primarily reliant on rain for irrigation, is the main economic activity. Trade and services along the borders with Ethiopia and Eritrea also play a significant role in the state&#x27;s economy. The introduction of mechanized agricultural methods in 1945 significantly expanded arable land to 7,162,133 hectares, while 2,376,563 hectares of forest contribute to the production of gum arabic.

The distribution of agricultural areas is as follows:

* Dry Agriculture Belt: Approximately 1.63 million acres located in the north, with rainfall ranging between 500 and 600 mm. This area features Ptrepettha mud and lacks valleys and creeks. Mechanized farming, in the form of large sprawling fields, is practiced.
* Rainfed Agriculture Belt: Approximately 2.96 million acres, with rainfall ranging between 550 and 600 mm. This region has clay soil on flat plains, with rainfed agriculture practiced in large fields and smaller areas around Alqryz. Forest reserves are also present.
* Water Basin Area: Approximately 1.58 million acres, where clay soil and water are readily available.
* Mixed Farming Belt: Approximately 1.39 million acres.
* Protected Areas: A total protected land area of about 176,630 acres, with protected waters covering an area of about 878,180 acres.

Agricultural projects in this region primarily depend on rainfed irrigation and rainfall. Notable projects include Um Settat, sesame cultivation, Alvhqh, Labadi, and several others. The Rahad Agricultural Project uses irrigation from the Rahad and Blue Nile Rivers for both agricultural and industrial purposes.

The main crops grown are sesame, maize, millet, gum arabic, and sunflower. Important horticultural crops include lemon, watermelon, and vegetables like tomatoes, okra, and squash.

==Forests==

Gedaref State contains approximately 11 designated forest reserves, primarily characterized by the prevalence of Acacia trees, which produce gum arabic. In addition, there are 31 other forest reserves, also dominated by Acacia trees, with sizes ranging from 100 to 800 acres.

==Livestock==

Livestock in Gedaref State is estimated at about 5 million head of cattle, belonging to various factions. This number increases to around 7 million during the rainy season, when seasonal pasture becomes available. During this time, shepherds from neighboring states bring their animals to Gedaref in search of pasture and water.

==Industry==

Industry in the state is primarily based on agricultural products like sesame, peanuts, and sunflower. Key industries include oil, soap, and sweets production, with factories located in Gedaref. There are also workshops that assemble tractors, combine harvesters, and other agricultural machinery, along with lathes for making spare parts and providing repair services.

==Services==

Crops are stored and processed in grain silos and other storage facilities.

=== Banking and banks ===
The banking system in the state includes 24 branches of various banks, consisting of 17 commercial banks and 7 specialized banks. Additionally, the Bank of Sudan oversees banking activities and supervises the implementation of the central bank&#x27;s laws and policies.

The city of Gedaref has eighteen bank branches, with three branches in the FAO and one branch each in the cities of Alhawwath, Acanthosis, and Dawkah. The Gedaref Investment Bank was integrated with the State Savings Bank as part of the Central Bank of Sudan&#x27;s bank consolidation policy. The city also offers technical and mechanical services related to agriculture, including efforts to combat agricultural pests.

==Cities==

Gedaref serves as the state capital and the central hub for the state government, the governor&#x27;s office, and commercial activities, providing essential urban services. Acanthosis hosts the largest market for livestock in the state and is home to the state veterinarian. The FAO is located in Gedaref, with the Rahad Agricultural Project&#x27;s headquarters also in the city, which overlooks the main transit road from Khartoum to Port Sudan.

Alhawwath is the capital of the Rahad province, situated between the agricultural production areas and the railway line that leads to Port Sudan via the city of Kassala. Dawkah, the capital of the Tippers province, lies in the southeastern part of the state and serves as a key center for agricultural production. Tippers, located on the Sudan-Ethiopia border, is a hub for cross-border trade to Ethiopia, Somalia, and Djibouti, facilitated by the continental road network.

Gouge Bees is located near the Dinder National Park Reserve, one of the state&#x27;s most promising areas following the discovery of mineral wealth, including gold ore and natural gas. Cottage Cheese is one of the state&#x27;s border localities.

<text>Unity State, also known as Western Upper Nile, is a state in South Sudan. Unity State is in the Greater Upper Nile region. Unity is inhabited predominantly by two ethnic groups: the Nuer majority, and the Dinka minority.

In 2015, a presidential decree established a new system of 28 states, replacing the previously established 10. Unity State was replaced by the states of Ruweng, Northern Liech and Southern Liech. Unity State was re-established by a peace agreement signed on 22 February 2020 with smaller boundaries as the northern part of the former state became the Ruweng Administrative Area.

==Administrative divisions==
The capital of Unity state is Bentiu. Before an administrative reorganization in 1994, Unity was part of a much larger province of Upper Nile, and the state was sometimes called Western Upper Nile.

==Economy==

Agriculture is the state&#x27;s primary economic activity. Many people of the state are nomadic agro-pastoralists who engage in both agriculture and rearing of livestock, especially cattle. Farming is primarily conducted during the rainy season, although some cultivation also occurs during summer. Vegetables are not widely cultivated, as most farmers are rural rather than urban, and therefore lack access to markets for their produce. Some NGOs have introduced farmers to the practice of cultivation for market.

==Oil fields==
Southern Sudan&#x27;s first oil reserves were discovered in the area during the 1970s. The international oil companies which engaged in oil exploration contributed to massive displacement of the indigenous population.

Oilfields in the state include the Unity oilfield and most of Block 5A. The Unity oilfield is within the largest hydrocarbon accumulation in the Muglad rift basin and contains an estimated of oil.

The Greater Nile Oil Pipeline begins in the Unity oilfield.

<text>Spadina Avenue (, less commonly ) is one of the most prominent streets in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Running through the western section of downtown, the road has a very different character in different neighbourhoods.

Spadina Avenue runs south from Bloor Street to the Gardiner Expressway, just north of Lake Ontario. Lower Spadina Avenue continues the last block to the lake after the Gardiner. North of Bloor Street, the physical street continues as Spadina Road and this has new street address numbering starting over at zero. For much of its extent, Spadina Road is a less busy residential road (especially north of Dupont Street and the railway track underpass) than Spadina Avenue.

==Etymology==
Spadina Avenue is commonly pronounced with the &quot;i&quot; as as in &quot;mine&quot;; the Spadina House museum on Spadina Road is always pronounced with the &quot;i&quot; as as in &quot;ski&quot;. The name originated under the latter pronunciation, with the former a colloquialism that evolved as Spadina Avenue was extended from the wealthy neighbourhoods north of Bloor into the more working-class and immigrant areas to the south; for many years, the pronunciation difference served as a class marker. The variation is now predominant among most Torontonians, to the point that in 2011 a minor controversy emerged when the Toronto Transit Commission&#x27;s new automated announcement system pronounced the upcoming subway stop with .

The name originates from the Ojibwa word &quot;ishpadinaa&quot;, meaning &quot;high place/ridge&quot; or &quot;sudden rise in the land.&quot; The Ishpatina Ridge, in Northern Ontario, which is the highest point of land in the province of Ontario, and the city of Ishpeming, in the state of Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula in Marquette County both derive their name from the same preverb.

==History==
Spadina was the original name of the street from Bloor Street to Queen Street West, built by Dr. William Baldwin beginning in 1815. The street&#x27;s name did not appear in published maps until 1834. The southern portion was named Brock Street (first appearing around 1837) and remained so until after 1884. Brock Street was named in honour of Sir Isaac Brock. Baldwin designed the original Spadina, choosing its extra large width and placing the circle that is today 1 Spadina Crescent. He named the connecting Baldwin Street after himself, and Phoebe Street to the south was named after his wife Phoebe Baldwin.

For a number of decades, Spadina Avenue and nearby Kensington Market were the centre of Jewish life in Toronto with the area around Spadina being the home of the garment district—where many Jews worked—as well as numerous Jewish delis, tailors, bookstores, cinemas, Yiddish theatres, synagogues and other political, social and cultural institutions. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Jewish community moved north along Bathurst Street, but signs of Spadina&#x27;s Jewish history can still be found in many locations. The city&#x27;s Chinatown moved west along Dundas onto Spadina when much of the original Chinatown was expropriated to build Toronto&#x27;s new City Hall and Nathan Phillips Square.

==Street description==
Most of the section known as Spadina Avenue is a six-lane urban arterial (four lanes for cars, two dedicated right-of-way lanes for a streetcar running down the middle) with a speed limit of 50 km/h (30 mph), although it is unposted. The section known as Spadina Road is a two- to four-lane collector road with speed limits alternating between 40 and 50 km/h (25–30 mph).

The 77 Spadina bus route inspired a song, &quot;Spadina Bus&quot;, which became a surprise Top 40 hit in Canada for the jazz fusion band The Shuffle Demons in 1986. In the 1990s, however, the TTC rebuilt and reinstated the 510 Spadina streetcar line, which runs largely in a dedicated right-of-way along the median strip of the street since its opening in 1997. Prior to the construction of the Spadina LRT, streetcars ran down the street until it was replaced by the 77 Spadina bus. Bricked road bed was used along the streetcar route. Small sections of the brick road bed remained until the LRT was constructed.

In the 1960s, city hall was planning to tear up Spadina and most of the buildings on either side to construct the Spadina Expressway, a proposed highway that would have run straight into downtown. After a long public battle, with the opposition to the project led by Toronto urban writer Jane Jacobs and former Toronto mayor John Sewell, the plans were halted in 1971.

In 2006, the Forest Hill Jewish Centre announced plans to rebuild the façade of the Great Synagogue of Jasło, Poland, which was destroyed by the German Army in World War II, as the façade of its new building on Spadina Road, a project that was completed by 2015.

===Route===
====Lake Shore to Queen Street====
The southern section of Spadina was the heart of Toronto&#x27;s industrial area for most of the 20th century, but in the 1970s, most of the factories left. Most of the land south of Front Street is infill on Lake Ontario. The Rogers Centre (formerly the SkyDome) was opened just east of Spadina in 1989. This area was previously the site of the CNR Spadina Roundhouse. Some land along this portion of Spadina has also been redeveloped into the condominium tower complex of CityPlace. The road once crossed the railway lands with a pony truss bridge built in 1926-1927 (replacing an early single lane truss bridge), which was replaced with the current Box girder bridge in the 1990s.

More recently, a number of tower buildings are being built or have been planned. Concord Canada House at 23 Spadina will have 74 stories, The Well at Front Street will have 46 stories and The Taylor at 57 Spadina will have 36 stories. In 2021, new residential tower buildings were proposed for the corners at Adelaide and Richmond.

From Front Street, Spadina runs through the Fashion District and along the western edge of the Entertainment District, which also contains a number of office buildings.

====Queen Street to College Street====

North of Queen Street West, the avenue passes along the eastern side of the Alexandra Park neighbourhood, which is made up of a number of public housing projects.

The intersection of Dundas Street West and Spadina is the centre of Toronto&#x27;s second-oldest Chinatown (the oldest was located at Dundas and Elizabeth Streets), with many restaurants and shops catering to the Chinese community. The Chinese Spadina began in the 1970s after the departure of Jewish Toronto (1920s to 1960s) from the area. It supplanted an older Chinatown centred on Dundas Street West and Elizabeth Street, which was disrupted when New City Hall was constructed in the early 1960s.

Just west of the avenue in this area is the famed Kensington Market. The famous Shopsy&#x27;s Deli was on Spadina north of Dundas Street, but it moved and burned down in the 1980s.

The intersection of Spadina Avenue and College Street is known as an inexpensive place to buy electronics, with a number of independent stores in the area. It is also the location of the El Mocambo, where the Rolling Stones performed one night to a small audience that included the wife of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.

====College Street to Bloor Street====
North of College Street, the avenue forms the western border of the University of Toronto and is home to several businesses catering to students, as well as university facilities such as the Athletic Centre and a number of student residences such as University of Toronto Graduate House. Just north of College Street, the roadway splits into a traffic circle, called Spadina Crescent. The building in the centre of the circle was originally built as Knox College, but it was renovated in 2017 to become the Daniels Building, which houses the Faculty of Architecture.

====Spadina Road====
North of Bloor Street, Spadina Avenue gives way to Spadina Road. Here the street passes through the upper-middle-class neighbourhood known as The Annex. For this stretch of the road, Line 1 Yonge–University passes underneath. Two stations, Spadina and Dupont, are under it.

Spadina Road is interrupted just north of Dupont Street by an escarpment, Davenport Hill. The two sections require traffic to divert via Davenport Road, Walmer Road and Austin Terrace. There is a flight of stairs called &quot;Baldwin Steps&quot; and walkway in Spadina Park between the two sections of Spadina Road. Spadina Road continues atop this escarpment in front of Spadina House, one of Toronto&#x27;s largest mansions. Casa Loma is also nearby. The house and the street are named after the escarpment, the word &quot;ishpadinaa&quot; meaning &quot;[it is a] hill&quot; or &quot;rise&quot; in the Ojibwe language. Spadina Road continues north through the wealthy neighbourhood of Forest Hill. Starting north of St. Clair Avenue and continuing a few blocks further north is lower Forest Hill Village, which forms the main street of a small commercial area, the historical downtown of Forest Hill before Toronto grew around the town. Forest Hill continues to just north of Eglinton Avenue. The street continues north through this green, rolling residential neighbourhood. This stretch is served by the 33 Forest Hill bus route.

North of Eglinton Avenue, Spadina Road is again interrupted, here by the trenched right-of-way for the defunct Belt Line Railway, now a popular walking trail. It briefly resumes north of Eglinton, and ends at New Haven Drive (1100 Spadina Road – Northern Preparatory Junior Public School – Toronto District School Board). To access the section north of Eglinton traffic diverts via Eglinton Avenue and Chaplin Crescent. The road ends at New Haven Drive next to Northern Preparatory Jr Public School.

<text>A therapy dog is a dog that is trained to provide affection, comfort and support to people, often in settings such as hospitals, retirement homes, nursing homes, schools, libraries, hospices, or disaster areas. In contrast to assistance dogs, which are trained to assist specific patients with their day-to-day physical needs, therapy dogs are trained to interact with all kinds of people, not just their handlers.

==History==
Dogs have been utilized as a therapeutic resource by many medical professionals over the last few centuries. In the late 1800s, Florence Nightingale observed that small pets helped reduce anxiety and improve recovery in children and adults living in psychiatric institutions. Sigmund Freud began using his own pet dog to improve communication with his psychiatric patients in the 1930s. More recently, Elaine Smith established the first therapy dog organization in 1976 after observing positive effects of dogs on hospital patients during her work as a registered nurse. Assistance Dogs International followed in 1986, with the merger of several organizations. 

== Background ==

Brian Hare, director of Duke University Canine Cognition Center, says the human-canine bond goes back thousands of years. Hare states, &quot;Dogs have been drawn to people since humans began to exist in settlements [...] part of what makes dogs special is that they are one of the only species that does not generally exhibit xenophobia, meaning fear of strangers. We&#x27;ve done research on this, and what we&#x27;ve found is that not only are most dogs totally not xenophobic, they&#x27;re actually xenophilic - they love strangers!&quot;. Although a dog does not think according to language, people often intuit that dogs are compassionate and communicative. This builds a feeling of intimacy, leading the person to feel safe and understood. This can benefit the grieving human, who may be apprehensive about talking with another person for the fear of being hurt or lied to. Pets are an addition to therapy because they allow people to feel safe and accepted.

==Certification==
In order for a dog to be a good candidate to become a therapy dog and receive certification, they should be calm and social with strangers. They should also be able to adjust to loud noises and fast movements. There are certain steps that are needed for a dog to become certified by a national organization such as The Alliance of Therapy Dogs, e.g., to socialize the dog around other animals and people. They are tested on behaviors such as not jumping on people and being able to walk on a loose leash. Exact testing/certification requirements differ based on the organization&#x27;s requirements. Some organizations offer classes such as &quot;distraction-proofing&quot;, which strengthens the dog&#x27;s ability to focus and therapy training to help prepare the dog and the dog&#x27;s owner for therapy visits.

Although therapy dogs are not limited to a certain size or breed, common breeds used in therapy dog application and research include the Golden Retriever and the Labrador Retriever. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are considered natural therapy dogs since they were bred to be companion dogs. Thus they love meeting new people including children, are very gentle, and are eager to sit on someone&#x27;s lap for long periods of time and are small enough to do so.

Therapy dogs offer many benefits to people and patients. For example, therapy dogs help patients participate in physical activities. They also help encourage them to have cognitive, social, and communication goals.

==History==
Franklin K. Lane, Secretary of the Interior at the time, proposed utilizing dogs with psychiatric patients at St Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital in Washington, DC in the year 1919. Florence Nightingale also contributed ideas to the future field of Animal Assisted Therapy (AAT). She discovered that patients of different ages living in a psychiatric institution were relieved from anxiety when they were able to spend time with small animals. Freud believed that dogs could sense certain levels of tension being felt by his patients. Freud also used his dog to improve communication with his patients. He felt as if his patients were more comfortable talking to his dog at first and this opened up doors for them to later feel more comfortable talking to him. Boris Levinson, an American child psychiatrist, was one of the first to write about animal therapy, specifically with dogs as a tool to facilitate work with a child client. Dr. Levinson found the dog’s presence helped his pediatric clients with positive focus, communication, and allowing the initiation of therapy, and shared this information with the medical world in 1961. About 10 years later, psychiatrists Sam and Elizabeth Corson at Ohio State University Psychiatric Hospital used Levinson&#x27;s findings to expand this form of therapy to adults. The use of therapy can also be attributed to Elaine Smith, a registered nurse. While a chaplain and his dog visited, Smith noticed the comfort that this visit seemed to bring the patients. In 1976, Smith started a program for training dogs to visit institutions, and the demand for therapy dogs continued to grow.

==Classification==
Therapy dogs are usually not assistance or service dogs, but can be one or both with some organizations.

Many organizations provide evaluation and registration for therapy dogs. Typical tests might ensure that a dog can handle sudden loud or strange noises; can walk on assorted unfamiliar surfaces comfortably; are not frightened by people with canes, wheelchairs, or unusual styles of walking or moving; get along well with children and the elderly; and so on. Institutions may invite, limit, or prohibit access by therapy dogs. If allowed, many institutions have requirements for therapy dogs. United States–based Therapy Dogs International (TDI) bans the use of service dogs in their therapy dog program. Service dogs perform tasks for persons with disabilities and have a legal right to accompany their owners in most areas.

In Canada, St John Ambulance provides therapy dog certification. In the UK, Pets As Therapy (PAT) provides visiting dogs and cats to establishments where pets are otherwise not available. Also in the UK, Therapy Dogs Nationwide (TDN) and Canine Concern CIO provide visiting dogs to establishments.

=== Types ===
Specialist therapy dogs have been described in various ways:
*Therapeutic visitation dogs. These dogs are usually household pets; the owner of these dogs will take their pets to hospitals, nursing homes or rehabilitation facilities to visit patients. These dogs are used to improve the mental health of patients through socialization and encouragement. 
*Animal-assisted therapy dogs (AAT): dogs that fall under this category have the duty of providing assistance to patients to reach certain goals towards their recovery. They work to help patients gain skills such as motor skills, use of limbs and hand-eye coordination. They do this by walking patients through certain activities and games to help them practice these skills. These dogs are usually based in rehabilitation facilities. 
*Facility therapy dog: these dogs usually work in nursing homes along with their handlers. They live at the facility and help patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and other cognitive and mental illnesses.
*Grief therapy dog (also known as an emotional support dog, companion dog, or comfort dog): assist people in overcoming grief, which has led to a recent rise in the use of therapy dogs; although animal-assisted therapy theory has been around since World War II. Grief therapy dogs can be found in locations such as funeral homes, hospitals, nursing homes, schools, and hospices, and may provide support in situations such as funeral services, counseling sessions, and disaster relief. Popular breeds used as therapy dogs include the Portuguese Water Dog, Bernese Mountain Dog, St. Bernard, and Golden Retriever. In contrast to service dogs who assist disabled people with physical tasks, comfort dogs are not trained in skilled tasks, but serve as constant companions with a keen sense for someone feeling down. They can provide a way for people who are distressed to find sanctuary.

== Legal status ==
=== United States ===
In the United States, therapy dogs are defined but not covered or protected under the Federal Housing Act or Americans with Disabilities Act. According to the Americans with Disabilities Act, only dogs that are &quot;individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability&quot; have legal protection as a service animal. Therapy dogs do not have public access rights with exception to the specific places they are visiting and working. Typically the dog would be granted rights by individual facilities only. Therapy dogs are subjected to several tests to ensure that they are fit for the job. These tests look at their ability to block out distractions, comfort level around a variety of people with many different disabilities, and if they are comfortably able to walk through many different terrains.

While some states define therapy animals and emotional support animals, they are not protected by federal laws, and therefore can be prohibited from businesses, restaurants and many other locations.

==Benefits==
===Psychological===
Animal Assisted Therapy (AAT) has been reported to improve many psychological conditions such as anxiety, depression, social skills, and simply improving the moods of the patient.

Additional psychological benefits of therapy dog programs in educational settings include provided comfort, companionship, a diversion to unpleasant thoughts or situations, and decreased resistance to relationship development in the therapy process.

A large number of studies show that animals can offer relief and serenity to a wide age range of vulnerable people with various different emotional issues. Ross DeJohn Jr. of DeJohn Funeral Homes in Ohio says Magic, a Portuguese water dog, &quot;Makes people smile even when they don&#x27;t want to.&quot; (qtd. in Sinatra-Ayers). Amy Sather, Rincon Valley assistant principal, brings her 2-year-old Golden Retriever to the school to assist in the therapy of the children. Sather says, &quot;I&#x27;ve got kids whose parents are going through a divorce and they are so depressed by it. I&#x27;ve had children literally hug and cry into his fur.&quot; (qtd. in Warren). Principal Brad Cosorelli claims the students will flock to the dog in time of distress instead of the counselor. Children were found during a study to find their pet (in most cases dogs) a bigger comfort in sharing secrets or scary situations than they found the adults in the family to be. In some cases, life experience has led people to believe they will be hurt by the people closest to them; animals can provide non-judgmental and unrestricted emotional support. This is true for both children and adults. In a survey done by the American Animal Hospital Association, many of those who responded specified that they were emotionally dependent on their pet. Therapists believe they can utilize clients&#x27; attachment to animals for therapeutic reasons (Urichuk). The presence of a dog in a therapy session has indicated improvements in a patient&#x27;s outlook, as well as their willingness to share on a deeper level. The petting of an animal can also put a patient at ease, whereas a therapist must maintain a professional state and thus is unable to provide physical support. This creates a unique bridge for patient-therapist communication (Urichuk).

==== Psychological benefits in school setting ====

The University of Connecticut uses therapy dogs in their program Paws to Relax, available during finals week to help students deal with increased anxiety. The school uses them in other stressful situations, including suicides and deadly automobile accidents. Since 2011, Yale Law School has used therapy dogs to aid students experiencing stress. Some colleges and universities in the US bring therapy dogs to campus to help students de-stress. These campus events are often referred to as &quot;Therapy Fluffies&quot;, a term coined by Torrey Trust, the original founder of the University of California San Diego therapy dog de-stress event. In 2009, Sharon Franks shared the idea of bringing therapy dogs to campus with the UC San Diego Office of Student Wellness.

Since the autumn of 2010, &quot;Therapy Fluffies&quot; has visited the UC Davis, UC Santa Cruz, and UC Riverside campuses during the week before mid-term and final exams. These events give students and staff the opportunity to pet and relax with therapy-certified dogs. The university also works with the Inland Empire Pet Partners, a service of the Humane Society to bring therapy-certified dogs to the campus&#x27; Mental Health Day Spa, held quarterly.

In 2014, Concordia University, Wisconsin became the first university in the US to adopt a full-time therapy dog to its campus in Mequon, Wisconsin. The golden retriever, Zoey, is a Lutheran church Charities K-9 Comfort Dog, trained to interact with people at churches, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, events, and in disaster response situations. Concordia later purchased a second comfort dog, named Sage.

==== Stressful situations ====
Therapy dogs were used to offer comfort to faculty, staff and students following the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting in Blacksburg, Virginia, when 32 people were killed. On December 14, 2012, therapy dogs were brought to the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, following the shooting and deaths of 26 people, providing comfort to children and parents.

The court system in King County, Washington uses a comfort dog with crime victims, particularly traumatized minors.

In Uganda, The Comfort Dog Project pairs dogs with those traumatized by war. Participants learn how to care for and train the animals as the dogs assist with confidence, help with depression and assist with recovery from post traumatic stress disorder.

===Cognitive===
Programs such as the Reading Education Assistance Dogs (R.E.A.D.) program promote literacy and communication skills. The practice uses therapy dogs to encourage children to read aloud by giving them a nonjudgmental listener. It has been proven that the academic performance and children&#x27;s enthusiasm for reading has increased by having a therapeutic dog with them, especially in children with special education. Goals of canine-assisted reading programs include increasing reading fluency, increasing motivation to read, providing encouragement for reluctant readers, and making reading fun.

These cognitive benefits can be seen in libraries as well as schools. Internationally, there are programs that use therapy dogs in educational settings such as Germany, Argentina, Finland (Lukukoira Sylvi from Kuopio, Finland was the first animal nominated for Citizen of the Year), and Croatia, for example.

An article published by the &quot;American Journal of Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease &amp; Other Dementias&quot; reported that during visits with dogs, residents with dementia were able to be involved in special activities and were more verbal than usual. Researchers have identified further cognitive benefits of therapy dogs, which include an increase in mental stimulation and assistance in the recall of memories and the sequence of events.

=== Physical ===
Interaction with therapy dogs improves cardiovascular health, and as a result patients may need less medication. Personal pet visitation and animal-assisted interventions (AAIs) can benefit patients&#x27; pain, blood pressure, stress, depression, and anxiety, as well as increasing mobility and socialization with staff and families. Further, petting animals promotes the release of hormones that can elevate moods, specifically serotonin, prolactin and oxytocin. Patients receiving occupational therapy have improved their fine motor skills by grooming therapy dogs. Studies have found decreased cortisol levels in children with insecure attachment styles, children with autistic spectrum disorder, in hospital patients with heart failure, and in healthcare professionals, after physical contact with a dog.

=== Social ===
Therapy dogs promote greater self-esteem in students and encourage positive interactions with peers and teachers. Additionally, children with autism demonstrated increased verbal abilities and social interaction during therapy sessions when animals were present compared to traditional therapy sessions without them.

== Concerns ==
There are some concerns with using therapy dogs with children and adults in various public facilities. Some include hygiene, allergies, cross-cultural expectations, safety of participants, animal welfare, and lack of consistent training or certification process and liability. AAI (animal-assisted interventions) and AAA (animal-assisted activities) are facilitated by human/dog teams with extensive therapy dog training and have obtained behavioral and health evaluations. They follow guidelines for cleanliness (bathing and brushing dogs before sessions, keeping vaccinations up to date, trimming nails, human hand washing before and after visits) to alleviate most hygiene concerns. In all of these locations, patrons, students or patients are often required to take responsibility for their interactions with dogs in the form of a liability release or parental permission form. Advance considerations of the responsibilities of handlers and the institution or organization include insurance and background checks to address liability. Insurance claims against trained dog teams are rare, however, costs can be high if specialist insurance is not in place. Since therapy dog interaction is an optional activity, those with allergies, those who develop anxiety when near dogs, or those with general opposition to the program need not participate.

While there is no nationwide standard for certification or registration of ESAs, many online agencies claim to &quot;register&quot; an animal as an ESA for a fee. The qualifications are not strict which may raise concern. There have been countless incidents of people misusing confusing restrictions, given the sometimes overlapping terminology and recent emergence of service dogs and ESAs. To combat the issue of fraud, numerous states are enacting new regulations, the majority of which are centered on service animals. Some states have more specific laws that focus on exact situations, while other&#x27;s are more general.

<doc id="767625" wikidata="Q309489" url="?curid=767625" title="Blue Nile State">
<text>Blue Nile State ( &quot;&quot;) is one of the eighteen states of the Republic of the Sudan. It was established by presidential decree nº 3 in 1992 and it is named after the Blue Nile River.

The region is host to around forty different ethnic groups. Its economic activity is based on agriculture and livestock and increasing mineral exploitation.

== History ==
In 2011, residents of Blue Nile were scheduled to hold ill-defined &quot;popular consultations&quot; to determine the constitutional future of the state, per the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. Instead, a dispute over the rightful government of the state, and the determination of Omar al-Bashir to eradicate the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Movement–North, led to a renewed nine-year conflict between government forces and the Sudan Revolutionary Front as well as contributing to a refugee crisis. The conflict finally came to an end in 2020 after a peace agreement was signed and the government to not discriminate based on ethnicity or religion. Further clashes in the state broke out in 2022 between the Hausa people and Funj and Berta peoples over land disputes which led to the deaths of hundreds of civilians.

On 5 August 2024, the RSF launched an incursion into the state and continues to control northwestern parts of the state.
== Administration ==

The State is sub-divided into five districts (with 2006 Census populations shown hereafter):
# Ad Damazin District (212,712)
# Al Roseires District (215,857)
# Geissan District (87,809)

<doc id="767630" wikidata="Q2471185" url="?curid=767630" title="USS South Carolina (CGN-37)">
<text>USS &quot;South Carolina&quot; (CGN-37) was the second ship of the of nuclear-powered guided missile cruisers in the United States Navy.

USS &quot;South Carolina&quot; and her sister ship, , were equipped with two Mk-13 launchers, fore and aft, for the RIM-24 Tartar surface-to-air missiles, ASROC missiles, and Harpoon missiles. They were equipped with two 5-inch rapid-fire cannons, fore and aft. Unlike the later which had a unique arrangement aft of the superstructure, with a flight deck and a below-decks hangar for two LAMPS helicopters, these two cruisers had only a landing pad aft and basic refuelling equipment. There was also a full suite of anti-submarine warfare equipment. Thus, these ships were designed to face all threats, in the air, on the surface, and underwater.

&quot;South Carolina&quot; was sometimes referred to by her crewmembers as &quot;The Socar&quot; or &quot;The Mighty Socar&quot;.

== 1970–1979 ==
&quot;South Carolina&quot; was launched on 1 July 1972 and commissioned as DLGN-37 on 25 January 1975. She was redesignated CGN-37 six months later in the Navy&#x27;s major type realignment of 30 June 1975. &quot;South Carolina&quot; was built at Newport News Shipbuilding Co., Newport News, Virginia.
The cruiser&#x27;s first North Atlantic deployment was to the Battle Group. After &quot;South Carolina&quot; participated in Exercise Solid Shield in the Caribbean and completed her first Mediterranean deployment in February 1977. &quot;South Carolina&quot; in company with her sister ship, , and the aircraft carrier commenced a second Mediterranean deployment in November 1977 and returned to Norfolk, Virginia in July 1978.
&quot;South Carolina&quot; deployed again to the Mediterranean in January 1979 with the Battle Group.

== 1980–1989 ==
In 1980, &quot;South Carolina&quot; deployed as part of the first Atlantic battle group to spend an entire deployment in the Indian Ocean. After a cruise to the Virgin Islands in November 1981, she was deployed in January 1982 for a six-month deployment with the carrier .

In 1985, &quot;South Carolina&quot; began a new year by conducting preparatory exercises in the Caribbean. It was deployed to the Mediterranean in March and completed the deployment seven months and 46,500 miles later. &quot;South Carolina&quot; spent the majority of the deployment on station off Lebanon, in the wake of the hijacking of TWA Flight 847. The cruiser underwent her second extended maintenance period from October 1985 to June 1986. She departed in July 1986 for a North Atlantic cruise, and made port visits to Wilhelmshaven, Germany and Oslo, Norway. Upon her return to Norfolk, she commenced preparations for overseas deployment and got underway on 30 December 1986 with the &quot;Nimitz&quot; Battle Group. During this deployment, &quot;South Carolina&quot; returned to her station off Lebanon when British peace emissary Terry Waite was kidnapped in Beirut. In June 1987, just months after the frigate was struck by Iraqi missiles, &quot;South Carolina&quot; was involved in a tense standoff with Libyan jets in the Gulf of Sidra. A major incident was averted by the use of high powered electronic warfare equipment to jam the jet&#x27;s radars and Libya fired back only with diplomatic protest.

She conducted joint exercises, entered the Arctic Circle where crew members became a member of the &quot;Order of the Blue Nose&quot;, and had a port visit to Wilhelmshaven, Germany. During this cruise, British naval historian Eric Grove was an honored guest of the officers and crew. She returned home in October 1988 to make final preparations for deployment.

&quot;South Carolina&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean in December 1988 with the Battle Group. During this deployment, helicopters from Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron NINE (HS-9) teamed up to rescue the fifteen British crew members from four yachts disabled by heavy weather. The crew members&#x27; rescue was broadcast on television in France, Italy and the United Kingdom, and reported worldwide in newspapers. The cruiser returned to Norfolk on 30 June 1989, and began a four-month availability at Norfolk Naval Shipyard following a one-month Caribbean visit in support of operations with the aircraft carrier .

== 1990–1998 ==
&quot;South Carolina&quot; departed 5 January 1990 for Limited Team Training in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The cruiser again set sail for the Caribbean on 12 March 1990 for law enforcement operations returning on 13 April 1990 having acted as Coast Guard, COMCARIBRON flagship and making two drug interdictions. &quot;South Carolina&quot; returned to the Caribbean in July for counter narcotics operations, where she served as flagship for Commander, Joint Task Group 4 and COMCARIBRON.

&quot;South Carolina&quot; departed 1 October 1990 for operations with the Battle Group. Following a solo trans-Atlantic crossing, she transited the Suez Canal for the first time in her history. During Operation Desert Shield, she served as flagship for COMDESRON 24, the Maritime Interdiction Force Commander in the northern Red Sea. &quot;South Carolina&quot; conducted twenty-seven boardings during Maritime Interdiction Force operations. Admiral Frank Kelso, Chief of Naval Operations, visited &quot;South Carolina&quot; on station 7 November 1990.

Upon completion of Maritime Interdiction Force operations, &quot;South Carolina&quot; was selected as the first nuclear-powered warship to visit the Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. In January 1991 &quot;South Carolina&quot; participated in operations in the Central Mediterranean with the &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; and Battle Groups.

The ship sortied early from Taranto, in Italy 17 January 1991 at the start of Operation Desert Storm. &quot;South Carolina&quot; acted as an Anti-Air Warfare Commander for the Mediterranean, protecting operation Silver Cloud air corridors and the approaches to the Suez Canal. &quot;South Carolina&quot; acted as on-scene commander and supervised the recovery of four survivors and 29 bodies from the sinking merchant ship &quot;Continental Lotus&quot;. &quot;South Carolina&quot; returned to homeport on 28 March 1991. The cruiser entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard for a Combat System New Threat Upgrade and refueling of both reactors and left the shipyard 30 March 1994 with a new lease on life.

Following nuclear refueling, she participated in &quot;Operation Able Vigil Forces&quot; to assist in the rescue and transport of thousands of Cuban migrants; its crew members were awarded the Coast Guard Unit Commendation.

&quot;South Carolina&quot;&#x27;s first post-refueling deployment was to the Straits of Florida during October and November 1994 to rescue Cuban refugees who were fleeing their homeland in hopes of reaching the United States. &quot;South Carolina&quot; commenced workups in the spring in preparations for her next major deployment.

In the fall of 1995, she started her eleventh deployment. This cruise saw service off the coast of the former republics of Yugoslavia in support of Operations Deny Flight, Sharp Guard, and Decisive Endeavor, which was part of the overall NATO Operation Joint Endeavor. &quot;South Carolina&quot; acted as &quot;Red Crown&quot; and Air Warfare Commander in the Adriatic Sea, earning the NATO Medal, Meritorious Unit Commendation, and Armed Forces Service Medals. &quot;South Carolina&quot; returned to homeport in the spring of 1996. &quot;South Carolina&quot; completed all unit work-up phases and began fleet operations with the Battle Group in the spring of 1997. From April to June 1997 &quot;South Carolina&quot; conducted a COMPTUEX with the &quot;George Washington&quot; Battle Group coordinating and acting as Air Warfare Commander for the largest and most successful surface-to-air missile exercise in the Atlantic fleet. In August 1997, &quot;South Carolina&quot; participated in Fleetex and completed all preparations for deployment.

In October 1997, the cruiser began its final Mediterranean cruise visiting thirteen ports of call from Haifa, Israel to Naples, Italy and Rota, Spain. She served as the Sixth Fleet Air Warfare Commander and participated in three major NATO exercises. The ship returned to homeport Norfolk in April 1998. Just weeks after returning from the Mediterranean, &quot;South Carolina&quot; returned to sea for six weeks of Counter Narcotics operations in the South Western Caribbean.

The ship conducted her final port visit in Charleston, South Carolina between 10 and 14 August 1998.

== Decommissioning and memorial ==
&quot;South Carolina&quot; was deactivated on 4 September 1998. The last of the crew left in July 1999, with the exception of a small contingent to escort her through the Panama Canal and to Bremerton, Washington where she entered the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 1 October 1999. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 July 1999, and was scrapped on 10 May 2010. In June 2009 her bow, which is long, wide and high, was placed as part of the Puget Sound Memorial Plaza. By April 2010, her nuclear reactor compartments had arrived, by barge via the Columbia River, to the Hanford Site (Hanford Nuclear Reservation) for long term storage. The reactor compartment is the 122nd to be received by Hanford from ex-US Navy ships and submarines.
